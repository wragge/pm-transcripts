EMBARGO: 9,30 P,.<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. E. G. WHITLAM, AT<br />
THE OFFICIAL OPENIN4G OF THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS OF<br />
THE GOOD NEIGHBOUR COUNCIL OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA, ADELAIDE TOWN<br />
HALL, SATURDAY, 13 JULY 1974<br />
TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO UNDER AN EARLIER LABOR GOVERNMENT<br />
THE GOOD 1NEIGHBOUR MOVEMENT IN AUSTRALIA WAS INAUGURATED.<br />
THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL WAS THE FIRST TO COME INTO FULL<br />
OPERATION AND WAS FOLLOWED IN CLOSE SUCCESSION BY COUNCILS<br />
IN OTHER STATES. THE MOVEMENT'S INAUGURATION CAME AT A TIME<br />
OF PROFOUND IMPORTANCE IN AUSTRALIA' S HISTORY. WE HAD NOT<br />
LONG EMBARKED ON THE GREATEST MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE INTO OUR<br />
COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE EVER SEEN. * AT THE SAME TIME, WE WERE JUST<br />
CREATING THE FIRST AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS. FOR IT IS A FACT<br />
OFTEN OVERLOOKED THAT THERE WERE No AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS UINTIL<br />
] 3L~ 9, THE ACT WIHICH ESTABLISHED AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP FOR<br />
THE FIRST TIME WAS INTRODUCED ON 30 SEPTEMBER 1948 INTO THE<br />
HOUSE op REPRESENTATIVES BY THE FIRST MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION,<br />
MIR. ARTHUR CALWELL. IT BECAME OPERATIVE IN 1949 AND THE FIRST<br />
MAN IN HISTORY TO BE AN AUSTRALIAN CITIZEN BY LAW WAS THE THEN<br />
PRIME MINISTER, MR. BEN CHIFLEY, WHO RECEIVED AUSTRALIAN<br />
CITIZENSHIP CERTIFICATE No. 1. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
THE COMBINATION OFIHESE TWO DEVELOPMENTS THE CREATION<br />
OF AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AND THE POST-WAR MIGRATION PROGRAM<br />
MAKE THE LATE 1940s A MAJOR WATERSHED IN OUR HISTORY, THEY EVEN<br />
INVOLVED A CERTAIN IRONY, THE FIRST DEVELOPMENT INVOLVED A FORMAL<br />
RECOGNITION THAT WE HAD ACHIEVED A SENSE OF OUR OWN IDENTITY,<br />
THE SECOND DEVELOPMENT COMMITTED US TO A COURSE THAT WOULD<br />
PROFOUNDLY INFLUENCE AND, IN MANY WAYS, CHANGE THAT IDENTITY, IN<br />
ONE OF HIS RARE PUBLIC APPEARANCES, PATRICK WHITE EARLIER THIS<br />
YEAR PRAISED THE HISTORIAN PROFESSOR MANNING CLARK, FOR SHOWING<br />
AUSTRALIANS THAT " WHAT WE WERE IS WHAT WE ARE", I WOULD SUGGEST<br />
THAT POST-WAR MIGRATION HAS MEANT THAT WHAT WE ARE AS A NATION<br />
IS INCREASINGLY BEING DETERMINED BY lWHERE WE AUSTRALIANS HAVE<br />
COME FROM, IN A QUITE LITERAL SENSE,<br />
SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF THE GOOD NEIGHBOUR MOVEMENT, WE<br />
HAVE INDEED BECOME A DIFFERENT NATION AND A DIFFERENT PEOPLE,<br />
THE INFLUX OF MORE THAN 3 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE POST-WAR PERIOD<br />
HAS MEANT THAT 20 PER CENT OF OUR PRESENT POPULATION WAS BORN<br />
OVERSEAS, TWENTY-FIVE PER CENT OF THE 6 MILLION CHILDREN BORN<br />
HERE SINCE WORLD WAR II BELONG TO FAMILIES IN WHICH ONE OR BOTH<br />
PARENTS WERE OVERSEAS-BORN, THE FORMER MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION,<br />
MR, AL GRASSBY, HAS GONE SO FAR AS TO SUGGEST THAT ONE-THIRD<br />
OF AUSTRALIA'S TOTAL POPULATION IS LINKED EITHER DIRECTLY BY<br />
BIRTH OR LESS DIRECTLY BY FAMILY OR MARRIAGE TO THE HISTORY,<br />
LANGUAGE, CULTURE AND TRADITIONS OF AN OVERSEAS COUNTRY, </p>
<p>-3-<br />
THE EFFECT OF MIGRATION ON AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT<br />
HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY DRAMATIC, THE 1971 CENSUS FIGURES, THE<br />
LATEST AVAILABLE, SHOW THAT 26 PER CENT OF OUR TOTAL WORK FORCE<br />
WAS BORN OVERSEAS, IN MANY KEY INDUSTRIES AND OCCUPATIONS THE<br />
MIGRANT ROLE HAS BEEN CRUCIAL, THE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION<br />
INDUSTRIES WHERE MIGRANTS HAVE PROVIDED ONE-THIRD OF THE WORK<br />
FORCE AND THE BUILDING MATERIALS INDUSTRIES FOR SOME OF<br />
WHICH THEY HAVE PROVIDED UP TO HALF THE WORK FORCE ARE GOOD<br />
EXAMPLES, THEIR IMPORTANCE HAS EXTENDED INTO THE MOST SKILLED<br />
AND PROFESSIONAL AREAS, THE 1971 CENSUS SHOWED, FOR EXAMPLE,<br />
THAT 30,5 PER CENT OF MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS AND DENTISTS IN<br />
AUSTRALIA AND 36,1 PER CENT OF CHEMISTS, PHYSICISTS, GEOLOGISTS<br />
AND OTHER PHYSICAL SCIENTISTS WERE OVERSEAS BORN,<br />
NOT THAT THE CONTRIBUTION OF NEWCOMERS HAS BEEN LIMITED<br />
TO THEIR LABOUR, ONE HAS ONLY TO LOOK AROUND AT THE CHANGING<br />
FACE OF AUSTRALIA TO SEE THE IMMENSE DIFFERENCE THEY HAVE MADE<br />
CULTURALLY, SOCIALLY AND POLITICALLY,<br />
IT IS, HOWEVER, AN UNPLEASANT TRUTH THAT MANY " OLD" AUSTRALIANS,<br />
WHILE REAPING THE BENEFITS OF THE NEW DIVERSITY OF OUR SOCIETY,<br />
HAVE TENDED TO LOOK ON MIGRANTS PRIMARILY AS A SOURCE OF LABOUR,<br />
AS A MEANS OF ECONOMIC EXPANSION, THE USE OF THE TERM " CANNON<br />
FODDER FOR OUR FACTORIES" HAS TOO OFTEN BEEN APPROPRIATE. IT IS<br />
NOT TRUE OF COURSE TO SUGGEST THAT AUSTRALIAN ATTITUDES HAVE BEEN<br />
DOMINATED BY UNRELIEVED RAPACITY, THE GOOD NEIGHBOUR MOVEMENT<br />
ALONE HAS SYMBOLISED A DIFFERENT, HEALTHIER ATTITUDE, </p>
<p>YOUR OWN COUNCIL IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA HAS, I AM TOLD, THROUGH<br />
ITS 2,000 OR MORE VOLUNTARY CONTACT WORKERS REACHED WITH A<br />
PERSONAL WELCOME 90 PER CENT OF ALL MIGRANTS TAKING UP<br />
INITIAL RESIDENCE IN THIS STATE, WITH THE ACTIVE AFFILIATION<br />
OF SOME 130 COMMUNITY ORGANISATIONS IT HAS HELPED MANY PEOPLE<br />
TO SETTLE IN THEIR NEW ENVIRONMENT,<br />
NEVERTHELESS, IT REMAINS TRUE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN<br />
SIGNIFICANT FAILURES IN OUR HANDLING OF THE PROBLEMS AND<br />
NEEDS OF OUR NEW SETTLERS, TAKE TIEIR EDUCATIONAL NEEDS,<br />
FOR EXAMPLE, A SURVEY OF SIXTY-THREE SCHOOLS OF HIGH MIGRANT<br />
DENSITY IN MELBOURNE LATE IN 1972 REVEALED SERIOUS INADEQUACIES<br />
IN BOTH ACCOMMODATION AND SUPPLY OF TEACHERS, THE REPORT SHOWED<br />
THAT ONLY ONE-THIRD OF MIGRANT CIHILDREN IN THE SIXTY-THREE<br />
SCHOOLS SURVEYED WHO WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH ENGLISH WERE<br />
ACTUALL RECEIVING ASSISTANCE AND, OF THIS ONE-THIRD, 40 PER<br />
CENT WERE NOT RECEIVING SUFFICIENT SPECIALISED TUITION, THE<br />
EFFECT OF THESE SHORTCOMINGS WILL BE TO SEVERELY LIMIT THE<br />
EDUCATIONAL AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO THESE CHILDREN,<br />
A SIMILAR PATTERN OF DISADVANTAGE EMERGESIF WE LOOK AT ANOTHER<br />
AREA, HEALTH INSURANCE, A SURVEY RELEASED IN JANUARY BY THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS SHO.! ED THAT ONLY 83., 3 PER CENT<br />
OF PEOPLE BORN OUTSIDE AUSTRALIA WERE COVERED BY HOSPITAL AND<br />
MEDICAL EXPENDITURE ASSISTANCE SCHEMES, COMPARED WITH 87,6 PER CENT<br />
OF THOSE BORN IN AUSTRALIA, OF PEOPLE WHO ARRIVED IN AUSTRALIA<br />
BETWEEN JANUARY 1971 AND AUGUST 1972, WHEN THE'SURVEY WAS<br />
CONDUCTED, ONLY 68 PER CENT WERE COVERED, MORE THAN 53,000<br />
GREEK MIGRANTS OR 37,5 PER CENT WERE UNPROTECTED; ABOUT<br />
52,000 ITALIAN MIGRANTS-OR 19,1 PER CENT WERE WITHOUT COVERAGE, </p>
<p>THIS KIND OF UNDERPRIVILEGE CAN BE FOUND IN MANY OTHER AREAS<br />
OF AUSTRALIAN LIFE,<br />
IT IS NO WONDER THEN THAT SO MANY MIGRANTS HAVE LEFT<br />
AUSTRALIA, IN 1972, FOR EXAMPLE, AUSTRALIA RECEIVED 112,468<br />
SETTLERS BUT IN THE SAME YEAR 33,172 FORMER SETTLERS LEFT<br />
THE COUNTRY, THIS SORT OF WASTAGE CLEARLY INDICATES THAT SOMETHING<br />
HAS BEEN DRASTICALLY WRONG WITH BOTH OUR RECRUITMENT OF MIGRANTS<br />
AND OUR TREATMENT OF THEM ONCE THEY ARE HERE,<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR INTRODUCED A NEW<br />
SYSTEM OF OVERCOMING THE RECRUITMENT PROBLEMS, WE HAVE<br />
ASSUMED THAT THE PEOPLE MOST LIKELY TO SETTLE HAPPILY AND<br />
PERMANENTLY IN AUSTRALIA ARE THOSE WHO ALREADY HAVE FRIENDS<br />
OR RELATIVES HERE OR WHO HAVE JOBS AWAITING THEM, FOR THIS<br />
REASON WE NOW GIVE OUR FIRST PRIORITY TO THE REUNITING OF FAMILIES -TO<br />
SPOUSES, DEPENDENT CHILDREN, AGED OR OTHERWISE DEPENDENT PARENTS<br />
AND FIANCEES, SPONSORED BY AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTS, OUR OTHER<br />
PRIORITIES HAVE BEEN FOR THE ADMISSION OF CLOSE NON-DEPENDENT<br />
BLOOD RELATIVES; MORE DISTANT RELATIVES AND FRIENDS; AND<br />
PEOPLE WITH OCCUPATIONS REQUIRED TO MEET SPECIFIC NATIONAL<br />
NEEDS, </p>
<p>-6-<br />
AT THE SAME TIME IN THE LAST 19, MONTHS WE HAVE INTRODUCED<br />
A NUMBER OF MEASURES TO MEET THE NEEDS AND ASPIRATIONS OF PEOPLE<br />
WHO HAVE ALREADY SETTLED IN AUSTRALIA, WE HAVE INTRODUCED<br />
PORTABILITY OF PENSION RIGHTS TO ENABLE ANY1ONE TO RECEIVE AGED,<br />
INVALID, WIDOWS'I OR WIVES PENSIONS IN ANY COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY<br />
CHOOSE TO LIVE. WE ARE ESTABLISHING A TELEPHONE INTERPRETER<br />
SERVICE IN OUR CAPITAL CITIES TO DEAL WITH REQUESTS FOR HELP<br />
AND GUIDANCE FROM MIGRANTS. WE ARE OPENING MIGRANT EDUCATION<br />
CENTRES IN OUR CAPITAL CITIES. WE HAVE APPOINTED 48 MIGRANT<br />
WELFARE OFFICERS TO WORK IN THE COMMUNITY AND IN SCHOOLS.<br />
WE HAVE INTRODUCED THE HOME TUTOR SCHEME WHICH IS AIMED AT<br />
REACHING MIGRANT WOMEN AT HOME, USING VOLUNTARY LANGUAGE TUTORS.<br />
IN 1973/ 74 WE ALLOCATED $ 8.2 MILLION FOR SPECIAL INSTRUCTION<br />
FOR MIGRANT CHILDREN IN STATE AND INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS, COMPARED<br />
WITH $ 5 MILLION IN THE PREVIOUS FINANCIAL YEAR. IAE HAVE<br />
INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO ENABLE ANYONE TO GAIN AUSTRALIAN<br />
CITIZENSHIP AFTER THREE YEARS RESIDENCE, IRRESPECTIVE OF<br />
NATIONAL ORIGINS. WE HAVE BANNED THE DEPORTATION OR THE<br />
CANCELLATION OF CITIZENSHIP OF ANY AUSTRALIAN CITIZEN. VIE<br />
HAVE ESTABLISHED TASK FORCES IN ALL-STATE CAPITALS TO IDENTIFY<br />
THE MOST URGENT SETTLEMENT PROBLEMS CONFRONTING MIGRANTS,<br />
WE HAVE RECEIVED A REPORT FROM A COMMUNITY RELATIONS COMMITTEE<br />
OF THE MIGRATION ADVISORY COUNCIL WHICH WE SET UP TO INQUIRE<br />
INTO DISCRIMINATION AGAINST MIGRANTS, EXPLOITATION OF MIGRANTS AND<br />
THEIR USE OF COMMUNITY SERVICES. THESE AND OTHER MEASURES HAVE<br />
BEEN PART OF THE PATTERN OF SEEKING TO ENSURE THAT MIGRANTS ENJOY<br />
FULL AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
MUCH REMAINS TO BE DONE IF WE ARE TO MEET OUR OBJECTIVES.<br />
WE ALSO NEED TO ENSURE THAT AS A GOVERNMENT OUR ORGANISATIONAL<br />
STRUCTURE IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE ONE. TO ENSURE JUST THAT<br />
WE HAVE IN FACT MOVED IN THE LAST MONTH TO MAKE SOME IMPORTANT<br />
ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES IN RELATION TO MIGRANTS AND MIGRATION,<br />
ON 11 JUNE I ANNOUNCED THE CREATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOUR<br />
AND IMMIGRATION. I ANNOUNCED THAT CERTAIN FUNCTIONS W1OULD BE<br />
TRANSFERRED FROM THE FORMER DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION TO OTHER<br />
DEPARTMENTS, SUCH As EDUCATION, SOCIAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN<br />
AFFAIRS. I KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF CRITICISMS OF THIS<br />
DECISION. MY GOOD FRIEND, MR. EVASIO COSTANZO, WROTE IN LA FIAMMA<br />
THAT LABOR HAD " KILLED IMMIGRATION" WITH THIS ACTION. THE<br />
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE GOOD NEIGHBOUR COU'NCIL OF SOUTH<br />
AUSTRALIA HAS ALSO WRITTEN TO ME TO OPPOSE THE MOVE, SO I WOULD<br />
LIKE TO EXPLAIN OUR REASONS FOR MAKING THE CHANGE AND TO TELL<br />
YOU WHY I BELIEVE IT WILL HELP MIGRANTS.<br />
THE CRITICISMS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE INVOLVE A NUMBER OF<br />
POINTS. ONE IS THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR A CENTRAL DEPARTMENT<br />
TO MEET THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF MIGRANTS. IT IS ARGUED THAT ANY<br />
FRAGMENTATION OF FUNCTIONS WILL LEAD TO INEFFICIENCY AND<br />
DE-HUMANISATION1 THE NEED FOR MIGRANTS TO HAVE A SINIGLE POINT<br />
OF CONTACT HAS BEEN STRESSED. FEARS HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED ABOUT<br />
THE LOSS OF EXPERTISE AND MORALE AMONG MIGRATION OFFICERS THAT<br />
MIGHT FLOW FROM THE DECISION. THERE HAVE BEEN STATEMENTS OF<br />
CONCERN FOR THE FUTURE OF COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN ACTIVITIES<br />
RELATED TO MIGRANTS, </p>
<p>-8-<br />
SOME OF THE 48 MIGRANT WELFARE OFFICERS APPOINTED LAST YEAR<br />
HAVE WRITTEN TO ME TO SAY THAT THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT<br />
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT THEIR FUNCTIONS ADEQUATELY<br />
AS A RESULT OF THE REORGANISATION, AN ARGUMENT HAS BEEN<br />
ADVANCED THAT, BY MERGING A LARGE PART OF THE OLD DEPARTMENT<br />
OF IMMIGRATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOUR, WE HAVE<br />
INDICATED THAT WE SEE MIGRATION MERELY AS A MATTER OF MANPOWER,<br />
THAT WE ARE GUILTY OF A KIND OF UP-DATED VERSION OF THE OLD<br />
" INDUSTRIAL CANNON FODDER" ATTITUDE, FINALLY, RUNNING THROUGH<br />
ALL OF THESE CRITICISMS IS AN ASSUMPTION THAT WE HAVE CEASED<br />
TO RECOGNISE THE SPECIAL NEEDS AND PROBLEMS OF OUR MIGRANT<br />
COMMUNITY, I CAN ASSERT THAT ALL OF THESE FEARS ARE UNFOUNDED,<br />
MORE THAN THAT, I ASSERT THAT MIGRANTS NILL BENEFIT FROM THE<br />
CHANGES AND THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WILL BE BETTER<br />
EQUIPPED TO MEET THEIR NEEDS, </p>
<p>-9-<br />
LET ME DEAL WITH THE FIRST GROUP OF CRITICISMS THAT HAVE<br />
BEEN LEVELLED AGAINST THE REORGANISATION, CONTRARY TO THE<br />
ARGUMENT THAT WE NEEDED TO RETAIN THE OLD DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION<br />
AS A CENTRALISED BODY, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT ITS CONTINUED<br />
EXISTENCE IN ITS PREVIOUS FORM WAS RESULTING IN OVER-CENTRALISATION,<br />
MR, GRASSBY POINTED OUT IN A REPORT TABLED IN THE HOUSE OF<br />
REPRESENTATIVES ON 11 OCTOBER LAST YEAR THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF<br />
IMMIGRATION HAD A TOTAL STAFF OF JUST OVER TWO THOUSAND TO DEAL<br />
WITH THE PROBLEMS OF MIGRANTS AS WELL AS HAVING THE<br />
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONTROL OF SOME 2,2 MILLION ARRIVALS<br />
IN AND DEPARTURES FROM AUSTRALIA ANNUALLY, THAT IS TWO<br />
THOUSAND PEOPLE OUT OF A TOTAL OF 257,00 COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC<br />
SERVANTS, IT WAS BECOMING IMPOSSIBLE FOR SUCH A RELATIVELY<br />
SMALL NUMBER OF MEN AND WOMEN TO DEAL WITH SUCH DIVERSE'MATTERS<br />
AS IMMIGRATION, EMIGRATION, SETTLEMENT, WELFARE, EDUCATION,<br />
CITIZENSHIP AND POPULATION, IN SAYING THIS I DO NOT MEAN<br />
TO CRITICISE THE OFFICIALS OF THE DEPARTMENT, THE DEPARTMENT<br />
SIMPLY DID NOT HAVE THE PHYSICAL OR FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO DEAL<br />
WITH ALL THESE MATTERS, IT ALSO NECESSARILY LACKED THE POWER<br />
TO PERFORM MANY OF THESE FUNCTIONS ADEQUATELY; SOCIAL SECURITY<br />
BENEFITS FOR MIGRANTS OR THE IN-SCHOOL EDUCATION OF MIGRANT<br />
CHILDREN WERE ESSENTIALLY FUNCTIONS OF OTHER DEPARTMENTS,<br />
YET MIGRANTS WERE ENCOURAGED-TO SEE THE DEPARTMENT AS THE<br />
DISPENSER OF GOVERNMENT BENEFITS,<br />
L </p>
<p>-gAAT<br />
THE SAME TIME, ALTHOUGH THEY HAD AT LEAST SOME<br />
OF THE RESPONSIBILITY, OTHER DEPARTMENTS DID NOT PAY SUFFICIENT<br />
ATTENTION TO DEVELOPING PROGRAMS FOR MIGRANTS, IT WAS<br />
TOO EASY TO FOB OFF MIGRANT QUESTIONS AS MATTERS FOR THE<br />
IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT, THIS APPLIED TO BOTH STATE AND<br />
FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS,<br />
THIS CONFUSION OF ROLES BECAME EVEN MORE INAPPROPRIATE<br />
WITH THE ADVENT OF THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT, ONE OF THE GREAT<br />
CHANGES TO WHICH WE HAVE BEEN COMMITTED SINCE COMING TO<br />
OFFICE 19 MONTHS AGO HAS BEEN TO INVOLVE THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT IN NEWl AREAS OF GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITY IN AUSTRALIA, </p>
<p>PREVIOUSLY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAD ADOPTED A VERY LIMITED<br />
ROLE IN SUCH AREAS AS EDUCATION AND URBAN AFFAIRS, IN THE FIELD<br />
OF SOCIAL SECURITY, IT ACTED LARGELY AS A MEANS OF GIVING<br />
PENSIONS AND OTHER WELFARE BENEFITS, IN ALL OF THESE AREAS<br />
ITS ROLE HAS NOW CHANGED RADICALLY, IN EDUCATION WE ARE<br />
SEEKING TO ELIMINATE AREAS OF DISADVANTAGE TO PROVIDE EQUAL<br />
OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL AUSTRALIAN CHILDREN, NOT JUST TO HAND OUT<br />
ARBITRARY PER CAPITA PAYMENTS, IN SOCIAL SECURITY, THROUGH THE<br />
SOCIAL WELFARE COMMISSION AND THE AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE PLAN, WE<br />
ARE TRYING TO ESTABLISH COMMUNITY WELFARE FACILITIES FOR ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS, IN SHORT WE HAVE MOVED INTO THE ROLE OF AN<br />
I U<br />
INITIATOR, AN ACTIVIST IN THESE FIELDS IN A WAY \ WHICH NO PREVIOUS<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAD DONE,<br />
IT IS ONLY LOGICAL THAT, IN LINE WITH THIS EXPANDED<br />
ROLE, THAT MIGRANT AFFAIRS SHOULD BE ACCEPTED AS COMING WITHIN<br />
THE PURVIEW OF THE RELEVANT AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS,<br />
IF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS TO TACKLE GENUINELY THE PROBLEMS OF<br />
THE DISADVANTAGED IN OUR SCHOOLS IT CANNOT IGNORE MIGRANT EDUCATION,<br />
IF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND THE SOCIAL WELFARE<br />
COMMISSION ARE TO RESTRUCTURE OUR WELFARE SYSTEM EFFECTIVELY<br />
THEY CANNOT IGNORE THE WELFARE NEEDS OF MIGRANTS, THE SOONER<br />
WE SEE MIGRANT NEEDS AS PART OF THE OVERALL NEEDS OF THE WHOLE<br />
COMMUNITY, THE SOONER THOSE NEEDS WILL BE MET BY THE BODIES WITHi<br />
THE APPROPRIATE STAFF, FACILITIES, FINANCES AND RESPONSIBILITIES, </p>
<p>-11-<br />
THIS IS NOT FRAGMENTATION, IT IS SPECIALISATION,<br />
THIS IS NOT INEFFICIENCY, THIS IS THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY<br />
IN WHICH TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS,<br />
THE EXPERTISE OF IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS WILL NOT BE LOST<br />
TO THE PUBLIC SERVICE OR, FOR THAT MATTER, TO MIGRANTS, THERE<br />
WILL REMAIN A SIGNIFICANT IMMIGRATION UNIT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT<br />
OF LABOUR AND IMMIGRATION, THIS WILL STILL SERVE AS AN ESTABLISHED<br />
CENTREOF CONTACT FOR MIGRANTS, THUS IF A MIGRANT IS UNSURE OF<br />
WHICH DEPARTMENT TO APPROACH WITH A PROBLEM HE WILL STILL BE ABLE<br />
TO USE THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOUR AND IMMIGRATION AS A FIRST POINT<br />
OF CONTACT, IF HIS PROBLEM IS A SPECIALISED ONE, THE OFFICERS<br />
OF THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT HE IS REFERRED TO<br />
THE RIGHT PERSON IN THE RIGHT SPECIALIST DEPARTMENT,<br />
A NUMBER OF OFFICERS OF THE OLD DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION<br />
WILL OF COURSE BE TRANSFERRED TO OTHER DEPARTMENTS, THE MIGRANT<br />
WELFARE OFFICERS, FOR EXAMPLE, WILL GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL<br />
SECURITY, THIS CERTAINLY DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY WILL BE<br />
SUBMERGED AND LOST WITHIN A BUREAUCRATIC MONOLITH, RATHER THEY<br />
WILL BE ABLE TO DRAW ON THE EXPERTISE AND MORE COMPREHENSIVE<br />
RESOURCES OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY DEPARTMENT INDEED THE MINISTER<br />
FOR SOCIAL SECURITY, MR, BILL HAYDEN, HAS ALREADY SAID THAT<br />
MIGRANT WELFARE SERVICES WILL BE GREATLY ENLARGED AND IMPROVED<br />
AS A RESULT OF THE REORGANISATION. </p>
<p>-12-<br />
WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF MIGRANTS WILL<br />
NOT BE LOST SIGHT OF IN THE SPECIALIST DEPARTMENTS, AS AN<br />
EARNEST OF OUR INTENTIONS, I CAN ANNOUNCE TONIGHT ONE RESULT<br />
OF DISCUSSIONS I HAVE HELD WITH THE MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITY,<br />
HE HAS AGREED THAT A PERSON INVOLVED IN MIGRANT WELFARE WILL BE<br />
APPOINTED TO THE SOCIAL WELFARE COMMISSION, THE APPOINTEE WILL<br />
PROVIDE A VITAL INFLUENCE ON POLICIES AND ACTIVITIES OF THE<br />
COMMISSION, IN KEEPING WITH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT<br />
THERE WILL BE NO LESSENING OF COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
ACTIVITIES IN THE FIELD OF MIGRATION, IF WE ARE TO SUCCEED<br />
IN OUR OBJECTIVE OF ENABLING PEOPLE TO SETTLE HAPPILY AND<br />
PERMANENTLY IN AUSTRALIA WE MUST HAVE THE SUPPORT OF COMMUNITY<br />
ORGANISATIONS, WE COULD NOT CONTINUE SUCH ENTERPRISES AS THE<br />
HOME TUTOR SCHEME WITHOUT THE AID OF VOLUNTEER WORKERS DRAWN<br />
FROM THE COMMUNITY,<br />
I TURN NOW TO THE CRITICISM THAT WE HAVE " KILLED IMMIGRATION"<br />
OR THAT WE NOW SEE IT MERELY AS A MATTER OF MANPOWER, OUR CRITICS<br />
ARE WRONG ON BOTH COUNTS, IF THIS WERE NOT SO WE WOULD HAVE<br />
ABANDONED OUR NEW SYSTEM OF FAMILY REUNION AT THE TIME OF<br />
REORGANISATION, WE HAVE NOT ABANDONED IT, AUSTRALIA WILL<br />
CONTINUE TO WELCOME MIGRANTS WHO -SATISFY THE HUMANE CRITERIA<br />
WHICH WE LAID DOWN LAST YEAR, WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT IT<br />
IS POINTLESS, INDEED DAMAGING, TO BRING LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE<br />
TO AUSTRALIA UNLESS THERE ARE JOBS FOR THEM, </p>
<p>-13-<br />
THE NEW DEPARTMENT OF LABOUR AND IMMIGRATION WILL HAVE THE<br />
EXPERTISE TO ENSURE THAT MIGRANTS CAN GAIN EMPLOYMENT,<br />
THE DAYS OF " CANNON FODDER" ARE PAST,<br />
MIGRANTS WILL ALSO BENEFIT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOUR<br />
AND IMMIGRATION'S NEW NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING SYSTEM,<br />
NEA, T, AS MR, CAMERON HAS CALLED IT WILL ENSURE THAT<br />
MIGRANTS, ALONG WITH OTHER AUSTRALIANS, WHO LOSE THEIR JOBS<br />
THROUGH TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES OR OTHER<br />
FACTORS CAN BE RETRAINED FOR OTHER SATISFYING JOBS,<br />
FINALLY I WANT TO ASSURE YOU OF THE GOVERNMENT'S CONTINUING<br />
COMMITMENT TO TWO VITAL GOALS: THE ABOLITION OF ALL FORMS OF<br />
DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF RACE, COLOUR OR CREED IN<br />
AUSTRALIA AND THE PROGRAM TO ENABLE THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY<br />
TO BENEFIT FROM THE RICH CULTURAL ANT) LINGUISTIC HERITAGE WE<br />
HAVE, THE MAN WHO BROUGHT THOSE COMMITMENTS TO LIFE WAS MR,<br />
AL GRASSBY, LAST SUNDAY I ANNOUNCED A NEW APPOINTMENT FOR<br />
HIM SO THAT HE COULD CONTINUE TO PURSUE THOSE GOALS,<br />
AS A SPECIAL CONSULTANT TO THE GOVERNMENT ON COMMUNITY RELATIONS<br />
MR, GRASSBY WILL CONTINUE TO BE KEENLY INVOLVED IN THE NEEDS<br />
AND ASPIRATIONS OF MIGRANTS, HIS INVOLVEMENT WILL BE FURTHER<br />
ENHANCED IF THE GOVERNMENT CAN SUCCEED WITH LEGISLATION TO<br />
ELIMINATE DISCRIMINATION, HE WOULD BE APPOINTED AS COMMISSIONER<br />
FOR COMMUNITY RELATIONS UNDER THAT LEGISLATION, </p>
<p>4 -14-<br />
HIS ROLE IN HELPING TO PRESERVE THE CULTURAL AND<br />
LINGUISTIC HERITAGE OF ALL AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS WILL BE<br />
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. WE DO NIOT WANT MIGRANTS TO FEEL<br />
THAT THEY HAVE TO ERASE THEIR OWN CHARACTERISTICS AND IMITATE<br />
AND ADOPT COMPLETELY T14E BEHAVIOUR OF EXISTING AUSTRALIAN<br />
SOCIETY. WE WANT TO SEE THAT SOCIETY ENRICHED BY THE CROSS<br />
FERTILISATION THAT WILL RESULT FROM MIGRANTS RETAINING THEIR<br />
OWN HERITAGE. THE OLD APPROACH OF INDIVIDUAL ASSIMILATION<br />
IS NO LONGER GOVERNMENT POLICY. WE ARE CONCERNED WITH THE<br />
INTEGRATION OF ETHNIC COMMUNITIES INTO THE BROADER<br />
AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY. By STRENGTHENING THOSE COMMUNITIES WE<br />
STRENGTHEN THE WHOLE SOCIETY.<br />
IHOPE THAT MY REMARKS TONIGHT WILL LAY TO REST FEARS<br />
WHICH HAVE BEEN AROUSED BY OUR RECENT ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES.<br />
INDEED I HOPE THAT MIGRANTS AND OTHER AUSTRALIANS WILL SEE<br />
THE ADVANTAGES THAT WILL FLOW FRGM THE REORGANISATION.<br />
IN THE FIELDS OF EDUCATION, SOCIAL WELFARE, H EALTH SERVICES,<br />
HOUSING AND ALL OTHER AREAS OF AUSTRALIAN LIFE WE ARE FIRMLY<br />
COMMITTED TO THE PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE AND EQUALITY FOR<br />
MIGRANTS, WE SEE THIS AS A JOB NOT JUST FOR ONE DEPARTMENT<br />
BUT FOR THE WHOLE GOVERNMENT AND, IN FACT, THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. </p>
