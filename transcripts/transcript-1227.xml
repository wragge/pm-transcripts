    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>FOR PRESS P. M. No. 10/ 1966</strong></p>
<p>With the consent of His Excellency the Governor-General, I announce that Senator Sir Shane Paltridge,Â Minister for Defence, has tendered his resignation as MinisterÂ and as Leader of the Government in the Senate.<br />As is well-known, Sir Shane has been very seriouslyÂ ill for some time. His medical advisers concur in theÂ decision which he has now made.Â </p>
<p>Shane Paltridge has been for ten years a reallyÂ magnificent Minister notably in Shipping and Transport,Â Civil Aviation, and befence. He has been a tireless worker,Â with a great grasp of principle as well as a mastery of<br />detail. His colleagues have extended to him their goodÂ wishes, and their appreciation of his high character,Â integrity, and ability. His services will be greatlyÂ missed.</p>
<p>CANBERRA,<br />19Â January, 1966</p>
