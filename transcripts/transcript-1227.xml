    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>FOR PRESS P. M. No. 10/ 1966</strong></p>
<p>With the consent of His Excellency the Governor-General, I announce that Senator Sir Shane Paltridge, Minister for Defence, has tendered his resignation as Minister and as Leader of the Government in the Senate.<br />As is well-known, Sir Shane has been very seriously ill for some time. His medical advisers concur in the decision which he has now made. </p>
<p>Shane Paltridge has been for ten years a really magnificent Minister notably in Shipping and Transport, Civil Aviation, and befence. He has been a tireless worker, with a great grasp of principle as well as a mastery of<br />detail. His colleagues have extended to him their good wishes, and their appreciation of his high character, integrity, and ability. His services will be greatly missed.</p>
<p>CANBERRA,<br />19 January, 1966</p>
