FOGR PRESS!' P. M. No. 19/ 1967<br />
TASMANIAN BUSHFIRES<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon.<br />
John McEwen<br />
We feel today for all Tasmanians, For the Commonweath<br />
Government, on my own personal behalf, and on behalf of the<br />
entire Australian community, 1 express deep distress and sorrow at the<br />
bushf ire disaster in Southern Tasmania, including in and around Hobart.<br />
I add particular feelings of sympathy for those who have been bereaved and<br />
also for those who have lost their homes, or their livelihood, or both.<br />
One immediate question. is, of course, relief<br />
of personal hardship and distress. The Ccmmonwealth Government will<br />
share the financial side of this work with the State Government. The<br />
Commonwealth would always do this in a disaster of this dimension.<br />
I have already taken steps to let the Premier of Tasmania know this.<br />
But in addition, we wish to give such other immediate<br />
practical help as we can. As soon as the fires were reported yesterday,<br />
Army personnel were made available for fire-fighting and other services,<br />
including emergency accommodation and xansport. Army assistance<br />
will continue to be available. Further, I am letting the Premier know that I am<br />
appointing the Minister for Air, Mr. Howson to take personal charge<br />
of Commonwealth arrangements for assistance to the Tasmanian authorities.<br />
HeI will be authorised to receive and co-ordinate requests and take action<br />
on behalf of the Commonwealth. He will be assisted in this by a group of<br />
officials from Commonwealth Departments and the Services.<br />
The arrangement to allot co-ordinating responsibilities<br />
to Mr. Howson does not change the understanding that Senator Henty, as<br />
a Tasmanian Member of the Commonwealth Government will, as a first<br />
personal priority, be in close touch with both the Tasmanian and Commonviealth<br />
authorities. This has been so since the news of the fires yesterday<br />
and will continue.<br />
