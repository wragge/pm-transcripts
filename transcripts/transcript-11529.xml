<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How did that go Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look, we had a very useful discussion. I haven't really got</p>
<p> anything to add to what I said to the representatives of the men and women</p>
<p> in Nambucca this morning. I am very sympathetic to their position. The</p>
<p> matter will be discussed in Cabinet on Tuesday. There's not only</p>
<p> the question of the entitlements but there's also the question of</p>
<p> assistance with retraining and we discussed that.</p>
<p>But we'll discuss it in full in Cabinet on Tuesday and we'll</p>
<p> make an announcement after that. But it was a good discussion. I am very</p>
<p> sympathetic. It's a very difficult situation and I understand that</p>
<p> they are going through a lot of hardship and the Government is very sensitive</p>
<p> to that. It's a small community, it's been a difficult industry,</p>
<p> there's been a lot of import competition and we'll be considering</p>
<p> it on Tuesday and I don't really have anything more to say.</p>
