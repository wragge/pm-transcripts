E. O. E. -PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW ON CARLETON-WALSH REPORT, 12 SEPTEMBER 1985<br />
WALSH: Prime Minister, the media and the commentators have<br />
hailed the election of Mr Howard as marking a new ez a matter of<br />
substance and not just the cosmetics in the Libei. Party. Do<br />
you see it that way? 7<br />
PM: Well, I think it is the start of a new era, but I wouldn't<br />
be hailing it, if I were the Liberals. We have now had the<br />
opportunity for a few days of seeing Mr Howard in action. And<br />
I don't wish to be churlish about this, but I probably have a<br />
better view of the Opposition benches than anyone else, and I<br />
would say the only happy face I have seen over there this week<br />
is a bloke called Andrew Sharpe Peacock.<br />
WALSH: But do you think over the next two years in the run-up<br />
to the next election, that Mr Howard will have a different<br />
agenda altogether than that from which Mr Peacock would have had?<br />
PM: It can't be altogether different. They are a very malleable<br />
group of people masquerading as a party, but there will be<br />
differences of emphasis. But the big question, Max, is how far<br />
will Mr Howard be able to in fact enunciate the policies in which<br />
he believes or in which he alleges he believes. Because you will<br />
recall that I spoke with you earlier this year, and with a number<br />
of others, and I said it fascinates me that the media concentrates<br />
upon the so-called divisions and ideological splits in the Labor<br />
Party. And you remember, I said to you that the splits the<br />
ideological factions and groupings in the Liberal Party are much<br />
more profound than they are in the Labor Party. And I am not<br />
being flippant about this. I think it is totally relevant to your<br />
question. It is by no means certain what policies Mr Howaard is<br />
going to be able to enunciate. He has certainly shown in one<br />
week a great degree of instant flexibility on positions, vide<br />
nuclear testing in the South Pacific, vide South Africa. In the<br />
area of privatisation he has an enormous range of opposition<br />
within his party to that, and not only within his own party,<br />
but gradually the National Party and its leader are going to<br />
summon up something equivalent to courage and come out and say<br />
they don't agree with Mr Howard. So it is not possible, Max,<br />
on the evidence that is available on the performance to this<br />
point and on an analysis of the deep divisions within the<br />
Pcry hzu2. ntthz. T41--nd t21.?-t-P<br />

<p>WALSH: Let me just turn t o your policies and the one to<br />
the fore at the moment is the question of interest rates.<br />
PM: Yes, it is up front.<br />
WALSH: If I could put it this way that it seems-to me from<br />
the statements that were in the Budget and from what you have<br />
said and the Reserve Bank has said, that the Government's<br />
policy and its advisers' policy is at this stage to run a firm<br />
monetary policy which means, in other words, keeping interest<br />
rates high, to support the dollar until the beneficial effects<br />
of depreciation start to bite. That is until the balance of<br />
payments figures start to look healthy. Would you agree with<br />
that as a broad brush approach?<br />
PM: I think that is a not unfair broad analysis. And you<br />
rightly put your finger, Max, upon the relationship between the<br />
exchange rate and interest rates. And we have had from the<br />
early part of this year to maintain, as you have said, a firm<br />
monetary policy because of our wish to sustain the dollar. Now,<br />
I believe that the beneficial effects of the devaluation are<br />
already starting to show. You will remember that in today's<br />
financial press there is a reference to the Victorian analysis<br />
of the way in which manufacturing industry there is starting to<br />
show the benefits of it. And may I just anecdotally put to you,<br />
Max, that a range of businessmen in manufacturing industry have<br />
asserted to me that they see very very favourable prospects now<br />
for going into markets that they couldn't previously contemplate.<br />
So I think your analysis, in broad terms, is right that we are<br />
going to see the beneficial effects of the devaluation. That<br />
will impinge upon our current account position. As that occurs<br />
it would be my assessment that the itlimate for favourable<br />
movements in interest rates will improve. I mean, we have done<br />
all the things that we should do in fiscal terms our Budget<br />
bringing down the deficit to beneath 5 billion, our arrangement<br />
with the States to contain their global li mits, all the things<br />
that Government can do to create the right environment in the<br />
market has been done. So I think your analysis is a fair one<br />
and I'm not in the business in these volatile circumstances of<br />
wanting to make dogmatic assertions. But I think it is fair to<br />
say with you that the environment, the general macro-environment<br />
should be such as to create legitimate grounds for hoping that<br />
the moves would be in the right direction.<br />
WALSH: Let me turn to industrial relations. And Mr Howard has<br />
identified Mudginberri as being a milestone in Australia's<br />
industrial relations.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
WALSH: Well it is in one respect because I don't think we<br />
have seen Section 45D used in quite the fashion it has bc-en<br />
us:. d on this occz-ion. In th rIc~ ~~ J~ l. you<br />
lcgjislation to try and aJSct) 1;__.. D rcm, thc<br />
Practices Act. Given the fact you have got a new Senate, will<br />
you be re-introducing this legislation? / 3 </p>
<p>PM: Well, on the evidence of the last time, it is all very<br />
well saying a new Senate, but the numbers are no different<br />
in any substance. Can I just make this point generally about<br />
Mudginberri. I said in the House today that you really have<br />
to put the question of Mudginberri in perspecti* VE. I add<br />
that I have said in respect of Mudginberri that I. don't believe<br />
that any of the parties to the dispute emerged with total credit.<br />
But I think what I said in the House today should be said to<br />
your viewers in response to your question. What the Opposition<br />
are looking at is a sea of industrial tranquillity, the lowest<br />
level of industrial disputation for seventeen years. This<br />
hasn't happened by accident. It has happened because this<br />
Government has adopted a policy of constructive co-operation<br />
with the trade union movement and with the business community.<br />
And that has brought this historically low level of industrial<br />
disputes. Now what these people who are so bereft of<br />
constructive economic policies are doing, is looking out, as I<br />
said, over this sea of tranquillity and putting this miserable<br />
confrontationist prism in their eye and say, look, let's where<br />
can we find a dispute. So they found Mudginberri. Now it's not<br />
a pleasant dispute. And that I acknowledge. And that's why<br />
Mr Willis and myself for some period of time have been trying to<br />
get it where it should be in the Arbitration Commission. And<br />
it would be my hope, Max, that through the processes of<br />
conciliation and arbitration, all the elements of this dispute<br />
can be dealt with in a way which will bring appropriate industrial<br />
peace in that matter.<br />
WALSH: Just let me turn to another sea of tranquillity, the<br />
Pacific. How do you feel about your fraternal socialist brother,<br />
President Mitterrand coming down to this part of the world?<br />
PM: I don't think it is helpful. And, I'm quite prepared to<br />
say that, not only now, but I have consistently criticised<br />
France and I am not going to mute my criticism because there<br />
is a government in France more of our political persuasion. If<br />
they are wrong, I will tell them. And they are wrong. Let's<br />
get down to the final point. The French can't have it both<br />
ways. They can't say to me, as they did in Paris when I<br />
directly confronted them on this issue, and say, look, t'&gt;. ere is<br />
nothing to worry about. It is safe. If it is safe, let them<br />
conduct their tests in metropolitan France. / 4 </p>
<p>WALSH: Right, let me now turn to South Africa: The latest reforms as<br />
put forward by President Botha do you think they have Any<br />
significance at all?<br />
PM: No, they are not of any significance. If by significance you mean<br />
will those reforms, and I would put that in the heaviest of inverted<br />
commas, they could only be regarded as of significance if you ignore<br />
the conclusion Max, that they can lead to a change in the substance<br />
of the abhorrence of apartheid. It is commonly accepted that they are<br />
not going to lead to that position. And indeed the result has been<br />
that President Reagan has moved far from the processes and principles<br />
of constructive engagement that had informed the Administration to<br />
this point of time. The European Community has similarly increased<br />
the strength of their position as has Canada. The evidence is clear<br />
Max, both in terms of the weighting down of the value of the Rand,<br />
the flight of capital from. South Africa, that the world is saying to<br />
South Africa that you are not behaving in way which we will regard<br />
as acceptable into the future. What I am trying to do, and the<br />
Government is formulating its policy accordinufj. Bill Hayden is doing<br />
this as our Foreign Minister and he is doing It with my full support,<br />
is to gradually build up, as far as Australia is concerned, the action<br />
that we take. We have closed down our trade post over there and we<br />
have taken other steps of which you are aware. We are moving ourselves<br />
in a position where we can do more and we will be going to the<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Bahamas next month trying<br />
to get the support of our Commonwealth colleages for agreement to<br />
further economic pressure. We will be moving from there into the<br />
United Nations with others to try and do that. So we are going to be<br />
part., with I may say, the principles of Malcolm Fraser on this,<br />
and he is impeccable on this issue, to step up the pressure, to<br />
increase, if you like, the size of the stick that the world has to<br />
show to South Africa ~ ut at the same time continuously plead' with the<br />
South African regime to say ' look we don't want the rest of the world<br />
to do those things, we want you to do it' because the inescapable<br />
truthMax, is this-that that regime and those policies cannot<br />
continue indefinitely into the future. If they proceed down that<br />
path without change there will be bloodshed of enormous and tragic<br />
dimensions. It is much better in everyone?~ interests that they should<br />
change. What they have talked about so far is not enough. </p>
<p>* WALSH: Prime Minister, if I could just'ask three fast domestic<br />
questions. PM: I will try and give you three fast answers.<br />
WALSH: The Australia Card, are you still. in favour of its<br />
introduction?<br />
PM: Yes, I believe the concept is right and I believe that) Max,<br />
for this reason. rhat there has been a clear identification that<br />
the introduction of a card would mean that the honest taxpayers<br />
of Australia, which is, of course, the overwhelming majority, would<br />
have available to them by way of the revenue so acquired, hundreds<br />
of millions of dollars which reduce the pressure upon the honest<br />
taxpayers of Australia. That's on the revenue side, on the outlay<br />
side we could also then have an instrument for avoiding the payment<br />
of social welfare payments in a fraudulent way. Now, I recognise<br />
the legitimate concerns that many people have and so I simply say<br />
on this that we will be discussing in the Cabinet the introduction<br />
of this as part of an overall package. but we are not going to be<br />
dogmatic about assertions on this. I will certainly listen to what<br />
others have to say. But in principle I believe it must be accepted<br />
as in Australia's interests.<br />
WALSH: The Bicentennial Authority, there has been some controversy<br />
this week about the departure of David Armstrong and the payment made<br />
to him. This has been done by the Bicentennial Authority but it is<br />
taxpayersimoney. I wonder are you thinking of restructuring that<br />
Authority at this stage?<br />
PM: What I have done is to have discussions with officers of the<br />
Authority and with the Chairman, Mr Reid. I have, frankly, raised with<br />
them some of the concerns that have been expressed by a number of<br />
people Mr McDonald but not him alone. Now we hope there can be<br />
improvement. In that process there has been a resignation to which<br />
you refer of the chief executive. I have indicated to Mr Reid that<br />
as Prime Minister I would like to have a considerable degree of<br />
involvement in the decision that is made to appoint a successor and<br />
may I add this that in a discussion that I have had with the Leader<br />
of the Opposition, I have indicated to him that I believe it<br />
appropriate that I should talk with him also. I want the Bicentennial<br />
to be bi-partisan and I say with full credit to John Howard that I<br />
believe that's his position. We don't want it to be a politica.<br />
-scrap heap so I will do everything I can to involve the opposition in<br />
this decision. I bel * ieve that a great deal of good work has been done.<br />
I believe we have grounds for looking forward to a magnificent year<br />
which will not be just celebrations in 1988 but the undertaking of<br />
projects of lasting benefit to Australia.<br />
WALSH: And what sort of flag should we have in 1988?<br />
PM: I am consistent about this. I am not pressing for a change of<br />
flag. I am saying Max, that I think it is appropriate for pecple to<br />
talk about this, to see if they want something else. But I understand,<br />
and I say this quite seriously, the very deep feeling that hundreds o<br />
thousands of my fel-low Australians have about the existing flaci.<br />
it is one of those things that the Australian community shou.-ci t~ iin.-;<br />
about, talk about in a relaxed and gradual fashion. And if ouzt Of a<br />
process it wa * s clear that there was a great majority of feeling that<br />
we wanted some different sort of identification then that is<br />
appropriate. I think that that is quite different from our National </p>
<p>Anthem. We moved very quickly to get ourselves a distinctive<br />
National Anthem because I for one found it repulsive when I was<br />
watching Olympics to see the Brits get up and win a medal and have<br />
' God Save the Queen' played and'then Australian athlete get up and<br />
win and have the same Anthem played. I think the flag is different.<br />
WALSH: Prime Minister, thanks very much.<br />
PM: Thank you very much Max. </p>
