The Head of Security's at it again: " Seven of my agents<br />
arrested two old-age pensioners selling Tribune in<br />
Victoria Road, Bellevue Hill. But you should have<br />
seen the ones that got away!" I am becoming a little<br />
alarmed. Things seem to be getting out of hand. No,<br />
Carolyn has stuck to her column to the end. " Doubtful<br />
but Patriotic" asked her a question: " I am going with<br />
a girl from Bondi who says she will marry me. But her<br />
girlfriend tells me we shouldn't have a baby until we<br />
reach California. Should I go?" Carolyn replied: " If<br />
you had a future, I would say this: in future listen to<br />
your girlfriend's girlfriend a damn sight earlier." ( A<br />
Chinese sentry has stationed himself outside the saloon<br />
bar.) Elsewhere in that great newspaper: A team of<br />
anthropologists have discovered a discrepancy in the<br />
Australian cephalic index. Nine professors of psychology<br />
have announced that at last Australia's Mother<br />
fixation is about to be sublimated, a finding hotly<br />
contested by a group of Collins Street obstetricians<br />
who argued that " it is very dangerous indeed for the<br />
umbilical cord to be suddenly snapped without the<br />
baby's considered consent." A well-known abortionist<br />
commented: " Babies are not all that necessary." The<br />
STOP PRESS carried a message of condolence from<br />
the King, his father, the Queen Grandmother, the<br />
Princess Aunts, and four former Governors-General<br />
on what they described as our " most unfortunate<br />
predicament". A group of Old Diggers, armed with broken beer<br />
bottles and crying " One Aussie's worth ten boongs",<br />
is rushing the Chinese sentry. They are all dead now.<br />
I have drunk four more schooners. The sentry has<br />
cleaned his submachine gun. The sun is setting over<br />
Black Mountain ( I think). I am not sure where I can<br />
file this story. The Rex-at-Canberra's personal flag is<br />
at half-mast ( I think: I don't seem to be seeing things<br />
too well). There is an aircraft circling overhead. Is<br />
this the end? No, by God, mates, it isn't! The Cabinet<br />
is up there in that aircraft and the Prime Minister is<br />
broadcasting. His voice is coming out loud and clear<br />
over the saloon bar radio ( interrupted from time to<br />
time by starting prices from Adelaide, which still remains<br />
free), yet cool, beautifully modulated, even confident:<br />
" His Majesty has personally sent me a message<br />
from the Britannia, at present cruising in the East<br />
Mediterranean, homeland of Benjamin Disraeli, swimming<br />
bath of the great Byron, deathbed of that even<br />
more deeply English poet, Rupert Brooke, area of our<br />
greatest battles in which we all took part, at least<br />
verbally.... His Majesty said: ' In order to honour our<br />
temporarily incommoded brothers across the Pacific,<br />
we have decided to confer upon you, their leader, the<br />
Order of the Garter.' On behalf of you all, I am on<br />
my way to receive that Order. If in this most British<br />
of all hours I may employ an Americanism: ' I shall<br />
return.'" We have all returned to our beer. The Chinese sentry<br />
is walking towards me. Strange. Summer Evening.<br />
Night now. Night, night. DOWN<br />
MEMORY LANE<br />
By Sir Robert Menzies<br />
This is an address given by the Prime Minister, to<br />
the National Press Luncheon Club at the Hotel<br />
Canberra, on September 14.<br />
TVE been misled and I've been misled by that deplor-<br />
Iable character, Maley. ( Laughter.) I understood<br />
Afrom him that today was my 30th anniversary. I am<br />
no doubt quite wrong, but there you are. But I thought<br />
it was I didn't look it up, and when I had people<br />
coming to see me earlier and saying " Many happy<br />
returns of the day", a somewhat fantastic wish, you<br />
will agree, I was still under the illusion that it was<br />
today, but now it's tomorrow. So I suppose I'll have to<br />
make a little speech and then make it retrospective to<br />
tomorrow, hoping that I survive so long.<br />
Now I was told that what you would like to hear, as<br />
briefly as possible, would be some retrospective views<br />
of affairs, people, since I came here first in 1934. Or as<br />
Ray Maley, with that exquisite capacity for an original<br />
phrase that characterises the Press, said to me-<br />
" Wandering Down Memory Lane". ( Laughter.)<br />
Well, I will first of all wander down it about Canberra<br />
itself because at that time, in 1934, Canberra had<br />
6000 people, and you could positively stroll around<br />
the whole, beat the bounds, in two hours with no difficulty.<br />
Now it's a large place and getting larger. In<br />
1934, it did not have municipal self-government, a<br />
state of affairs that still continues. ( Laughter.)<br />
Back in 1934, in the Lyons Government, we had a<br />
Budget I haven't had a chance of looking up the<br />
precise figures but I would say something of the<br />
order of Å 75 m. for the year, the Commonwealth<br />
Budget. 1, myself, in 1939, by a temporary but<br />
speedily corrected error, became Prime Minister and<br />
introduced the first Å 100 m. Budget. Happy days!<br />
( Laughter.) Even then, I have no doubt that some of<br />
the newspapers here represented complained of the<br />
gross extravagance of public expenditure and said that<br />
it ought to be cut down. We spent in a delirium of<br />
excitement in 1935-6-7, around that time, Å 15 m. a<br />
year on social services and it's now somewhere between<br />
Å 400 m. and Å 500 m. and is conceded by everybody to<br />
be grossly inadequate ( Laughter), but that was the<br />
position at that time.<br />
We had, in theory, an External Affairs Department.<br />
We didn't really have a department, we had a Minister<br />
for External Affairs, because George Pearce, about<br />
whom I will say something later on, was Minister for<br />
Defence and Minister for External Affairs. Instead of<br />
masses of young men and women who now have their<br />
being in the External Affairs Department and who are<br />
Sir Robert Menzies has been Prime Minister<br />
of Australia for the last 15 years. PROSPECT. No. 3, 1964 </p>
<p>fully aware of the fact that this is the last great<br />
opportunity to persuade every Chinese to buy a pair<br />
of sox, and hence once-for-all solve the grazing industry's<br />
problems?" The Minister replied that his officers<br />
had the matter well in hand, which was better than<br />
" still in the bush", he added wittily.<br />
Darwin fell the next day. This was denied in the<br />
Letter Columns the following day by " Five Experienced<br />
Punters" of Randwick on the interesting ground<br />
that the four-year-old gelding of that name had recently<br />
been put to stud. " Visiting Irish Bloodstock Owner"<br />
replied " I have learnt much about the virility of Australia's<br />
youth during my brief, but ( I hasten to add)<br />
extraordinarily pleasant visit to your shores. But I am<br />
mildly surprised to learn that even your geldings are<br />
sires." " Dinkum Aussie Sportsman" came back: " There<br />
are no Sires in Aussie, Sire; we're all mates here, and<br />
the sooner you realise that the sooner you'll become<br />
one of the mob. We're sick of foreigners anyway. It<br />
doesn't matter what a gee-gee is called. It's where she<br />
runs that matters." He was backed up by " Lifetime<br />
Horselover", who wrote: " I know Darwin's at stud. I<br />
saw him in the paddock behind Darb Munro's yesterday.<br />
I know Darb personally. When Ireland produces<br />
a Don Bradman, I'll listen to ' Irish Visitor'. Not till."<br />
Brisbane fell two days after that correspondence was<br />
closed by the Editor. A lonely fanatic distributed a<br />
pamphlet calling for national unity. The President of<br />
the Associated Chambers of Manufactures, in a<br />
spirited address demanding greater protection for Australian<br />
goods, attacked the pamphleteer for being<br />
unable to understand that the British way of life was<br />
based on free competition. The new Member for<br />
Wannon asked the Prime Minister why Portland, as<br />
fine a harbour as any in Australia, had been excluded<br />
from the itinerary of Chinese seaborne landings. The<br />
President of the Waterside Workers' Federation<br />
announced that his members would demand both dirt<br />
and danger money before unloading any Chinese.<br />
ToHE people were becoming slightly perplexed. And<br />
the Chief of the Australian Security Intelligence<br />
Organisation broke his accustomed silence<br />
to announce that 17 Chinese restaurateurs and 93<br />
university lecturers had been arrested in a recent dragnet.<br />
A mild protest by university students led to the<br />
setting up of a Royal Commission into Juvenile Delinquency.<br />
Unfortunately, it was never implemented: it<br />
was discovered that the whole Bench and Bar were<br />
debating " Australia's Contribution to the Development<br />
of International Law" at Jack Ruby College, Texas,<br />
and were now adopting the filibuster tactic with<br />
astonishing endurance.<br />
The Ladies' Committee of Melbourne's Cultural<br />
Centre held a charity ball to raise funds for the purchase<br />
of a yacht which set sail the next day for the<br />
U. S. A. carrying " items of central importance to Australia's<br />
cultural contribution to civilisation". A list of<br />
the main items was given to the Press: the Melbourne<br />
Cup, a bat used by Sir Donald Bradman, a complete<br />
set of Vogue ( Australian Edition), the poems of<br />
Mr. David Macnichol, Ben Chifley's pipe ( known to<br />
the Labour Movement as The Light over the Hill), a<br />
garter worn by Dame Nellie Melba, a recording of Miss Gladys Moncrieff in " The Maid of the Mountains",<br />
Ned Kelly's armour, " Chloe", the complete<br />
works of E. V. Timms and Mary Grant Bruce, and the<br />
semen of a famous fast bowler, two golfers, seven<br />
Bondi lifesavers, and three Melbourne Cup winners.<br />
Each donor received a signed recipe book from the<br />
Ladies' Committee at a public ceremony in the Melbourne<br />
Town Hall.<br />
The day before Sydney fell, the Anglican Bishop of<br />
Bushburg made the front page of all dailies: " Jesus<br />
Christ is the epitome of the English public school man<br />
at his best. He will not throw his wicket away because<br />
of a few Peking off-cutters. He is still there, our<br />
greatest opening batsman ever." The Catholic Bishop<br />
of Bushburg said at a Communion Breakfast: " Mr.<br />
Santamaria. must bear a heavy responsibility for this<br />
crisis. His overwrought warnings came much too early."<br />
Mr. Santamaria said something that was widely<br />
regarded in progressive circles as both arrogant and<br />
sinister. He said: " 1 tried to make a few points over<br />
the years. Perhaps if my name had been Jock Pagan<br />
I would have achieved a bit more."<br />
At this moment of supreme crisis people naturally<br />
tuned in to the last of Mr. Eric Baume's " This I<br />
Believe" sessions. " This I believe," he enunciated with<br />
panache and fruity gravity. " Today I want to say<br />
something truly I repeat that word ( I don't mind<br />
who is listening: I repeat that word). I am entitled to<br />
my views too. I want to say this: I want to say something<br />
truly yes, I know that ' Disgusted' of Whale<br />
Beach disagrees yes, disagrees with me and<br />
as the citizen of a democratic country with what can<br />
STILL be a great future ahead of it, he is fully...<br />
FULLY, I say entitled to disagree. I want to say<br />
just this. After all, I have very little time at my disposal.<br />
I want to say that the way in which the Whale<br />
Beach Council has treated its new bulldozer is simply<br />
disgraceful. Bulldozers are MACHINES. I don't like<br />
them myself. Yes, I am quite entitled to say that. I<br />
don't like them. They are loud. They make themselves<br />
heard MUCH TOO OFTEN. But they are ENTITLED<br />
to be heard. And so am I. Yes, I say this: so am I.<br />
THIS I BELIEVE."<br />
It is reliably reported that a battalion of Chinese<br />
paratroops has now landed safely at Canberra despite<br />
adverse weather reports. The purpose at the airport of<br />
the Diplomatic Wives' Oriental Tea Ceremony Group<br />
was apparently misunderstood by the Chinese soldiery<br />
during the first 35 minutes after their arrival, but Canberra<br />
Radio has just informed anxious members of<br />
the Department of External Affairs that " no misunderstanding<br />
whatsoever remains now".<br />
Which is, I suppose, a fair summary of our general<br />
situation as well. I am completing this despatch in the<br />
beer garden at the Hotel Rex-at-Canberra, where the<br />
regulars are helping a group of Methodist volunteers<br />
to learn how to drink beer. Mr. Barry Jones is answering<br />
a seemingly interminable number of questions about<br />
how " the boys" behaved during the fall of other Great<br />
Nations. Oh, dear, he has now collapsed under the<br />
weight of a middy, muttering darkly, " They'sh all took<br />
to the grog in the end."<br />
I have before me the last edition of a Sydney newspaper<br />
published under conditions of absolute freedom.<br />
PROSPECT, No. 3, 1964 </p>
<p>the masters of all the most subtle intricacies of the<br />
United Nations' procedure, so important for somebody,<br />
in those days, George Pearce, the Minister, " Hoddy"<br />
Hodgson he was the department, and there was<br />
the stenographer and she was the other part of the<br />
department. ( Laughter.) We had a High Commissioner<br />
in London. We had no other diplomatic representative<br />
anywhere in the world. Those were days of noble<br />
simplicity. Today, of course, as you know, we have<br />
High Commissioners and Ambassadors around the<br />
world and we have an External Affairs Department of a<br />
fully sophisticated kind, with all sorts of aspects of<br />
international affairs being dealt with. Very hard to<br />
believe that when I was first here in this very place, in<br />
this hotel, we had none of these things.<br />
IDON'T think we had any Trade Commissioners at<br />
that time. If we had, they existed in perhaps<br />
New Zealand and Canada, but we had no<br />
organised Trade Commissioner service of the kind that<br />
we now have. In other words, these were days of<br />
almost Spartan simplicity in administration. The complexities<br />
of international trade, the complexities of<br />
international affairs had not yet fully developed, they<br />
had not yet been complicated by all the explosive<br />
effects of the Second World War and those events that<br />
happened after the Second World War, and I think the<br />
result was, in those days, with fewer Ministers than we<br />
now have, it was found possible to have a certain<br />
amount of civilised leisure Ministers were well<br />
known to be seen on the late lamented golf course,<br />
playing golf. Indeed their fraternity with the heads of<br />
departments on the old Canberra golf course postponed<br />
the introduction of the lake for a long, long time.<br />
( Laughter.) Which reminds me that of course we had<br />
no lake. We had none of these things that we are now<br />
beginning to take for granted.<br />
Now I just said to you that there was a certain<br />
simplicity about life. That's quite true. If there was a<br />
conference in London, it was a conference between a<br />
limited number of people, all of whom understood each<br />
other. It had none of the complexities that have come<br />
with the new Commonwealth. Indeed, nobody in those<br />
days could have envisaged what was going to happen<br />
as colony after colony came to self-government and to<br />
independent statehood.<br />
Well, of course, inevitably, moving over 30 years,<br />
the complexity of matters to be dealt with by governments<br />
has expanded almost by geometrical progression.<br />
I can give evidence about this because I am the only<br />
extant creature who was a Prime Minister in 1939 and<br />
1940 and 1941 and who is still a Prime Minister in this<br />
year of grace. " Grace", I think, is the right word.<br />
( Laughter.) But, anyhow, I thought that I had plenty<br />
to do at that time and indeed I did. I worked seven<br />
days a week and there are only seven days in the week.<br />
I would say that the complexity and mass of matters<br />
coming across my table today is double or treble what<br />
it was at that time, 25 years ago. This goes for everything.<br />
The sturdy individualists in the country who resent<br />
any political interference apply for it every week. The<br />
manufacturers who oh, I must be careful because I<br />
have to speak to them this week sometime ( Laughter)<br />
PROSPECT, No. 3, 1964 what I will call the sturdy believers in private<br />
enterprise who think the Government ought to keep<br />
out of it are with us every week or with the Tariff<br />
Board every week or with something or other every<br />
week. There is hardly a section in the community today<br />
that doesn't in one breath protest its undying hostility<br />
to Government activity and in the next breath, pray<br />
for it.<br />
It isn't a wonderful or a remarkable or a regrettable<br />
thing that the number of Ministers has perhaps almost<br />
doubled since I first came to Canberra, it has been<br />
necessary and I venture to say that if the complexity<br />
of modern affairs and the demands made on governments<br />
both continue their pressure, there will be more<br />
Ministers and more Ministers in time to come, and a<br />
bigger and bigger Parliament in time to come.<br />
I mention it to you because I know it is not of your<br />
own malice but under the instructions that you will be<br />
given, or your successors will be given, that you must<br />
criticise every increase of any kind, and say that it is<br />
nonsense; that what the Government needs is fewer<br />
Ministers and not more. Well, all I can tell you is that<br />
if we had fewer there would be one interesting consequence,<br />
because if you reduced the number of Ministers<br />
and you thereby increased the responsibilities<br />
coming to each Minister, you would make him more<br />
and more dependent on his departmental officers. You<br />
have only to reduce the number of Ministers far<br />
enough to create ultimately a complete bureaucracy.<br />
It's worth thinking about.<br />
A Minister must have sufficient opportunity and<br />
time, if he is a seriously minded person, to master the<br />
problems of his department, and if he does, he will be<br />
able to place the proper value on the highly competent<br />
professional advice that he will get from his department.<br />
But if he is so pressed, always against the clock,<br />
that he just has to say, " Well, look, I haven't time to<br />
answer this problem, So-and-so, my departmental head,<br />
is a very wise and experienced fellow and he recommends<br />
so-and-so, I'll say Now this is worth<br />
thinking about. It is worth thinking about.<br />
CABINETS don't cost much. Really they don't if<br />
you look at the broad sweep of national affairs.<br />
I would sooner have too many than too few.<br />
The best kind of government arises when Ministers<br />
have enough energy and time to think about their own<br />
problems and to form views, and enough time to put<br />
the proper value on the advice they will get, as they<br />
will get it, from what in my opinion is one of the<br />
greatest civil services in the world. But we must have<br />
balance, and that's why, looking back over this time,<br />
I see an enormous increase in numbers and I believe<br />
that it's been justified.<br />
Well now, I must push on. I've said to myself for<br />
the last two or three days, " How does the standard of<br />
debate in the House compare now with what it was<br />
30 years ago?" Well, I think on the whole it's better.<br />
There are two reasons which make me interested to<br />
find myself admitting to myself that it is better. One is<br />
that there are two very good reasons why it should be<br />
w ors e.<br />
One reason is that people, constituents ( I have no<br />
complaint about my own; they have remarkable 17 </p>
<p>patience and endurance), but people, constituents, will<br />
write an enormous amount of correspondence to a<br />
member, a private Member of Parliament, and if he is<br />
going to answer them and deal with all the details that<br />
they want him to deal with and go to the various<br />
departments and get the necessary answers, then he's<br />
going to have a pretty small amount of time to sit<br />
down and do that good hard sweat and study that is<br />
necessary if anybody is going to make a considerable<br />
speech. TgHrEo wvsol ume of constituency work grows and<br />
every year because we are always having<br />
some new proposal, there is some new<br />
social service, there are some new changes in the rules<br />
of social services, there are changes in trade treaties,<br />
changes in the tariff schedules. There are masses of<br />
things of this kind, and on all of them, the member is<br />
going to be at the receiving end. Therefore, when I<br />
consider their constituency and correspondence and<br />
interviewing work, I would have expected, as a more or<br />
less detached observer, to find that the standard of<br />
debate had fallen since those more spacious and<br />
leisurely days when I first came to Canberra. Now, I<br />
am happy to say I don't think the standard of debate<br />
has fallen, on the whole. I can hear, I think, a higher<br />
percentage of thoughtful contributions to debate than I<br />
could have at that time.<br />
I was a bit nervous about broadcasting. Very<br />
nervous about it because broadcasting, of course,<br />
has one great advantage which all you gentlemen of<br />
the Press will understand perfectly. It does mean that<br />
if anybody cares to listen to you, he does know what<br />
you said. ( Laughter.) You understand me perfectly.<br />
But I gather that only about one or one and a half<br />
per cent of the people listen. That's, as a corrective<br />
factor, not perhaps as great as it might have been. But<br />
in the early days, I felt that it was almost ludicrous<br />
when the broadcasting came in and we had these things<br />
standing up you know, these microphones. Somebody<br />
described it as looking like the petrified forest.<br />
In those days, gentlemen, private members who sat<br />
round here, would be seen to be moving very anxiously<br />
to the nearest microphone when they were about to<br />
deliver a speech. There was then a non-technical theory<br />
that you had to be close to the wretched instrument to<br />
be heard by your constituents. And, indeed, some of<br />
you will remember that on one celebrated occasion,<br />
one member of happy memory was having a little<br />
difficulty with his upper denture in the course of making<br />
a speech. There was a certain clatter and occasionally<br />
a hissing and a certain amount of obscurity which<br />
produced, I regret to say, some laughter in the House.<br />
He said, " It's all right. It's my upper set. By the way,<br />
Doe. ( addressing his dentist who lived in some place<br />
500 miles away), by the way Doe., don't forget I've<br />
got an appointment with you on Saturday morning."<br />
( Laughter.) Well, there's another comment I'll make on that. I<br />
thought that broadcasting with this business of getting<br />
into line with the microphone would produce more and<br />
more set speeches and less and less debate. I think in<br />
the long run that hasn't happened. It did in the start.<br />
It was quite clear that it didn't matter what Jones, Brown or Robinson had said, Smith was going to say<br />
his piece into the nearest microphone and his constituents,<br />
as he hoped, would be listening to him and<br />
they would then understand. I think all that has rather<br />
died away. I think on the whole there is more debating<br />
in the true sense, more cut and thrust, more answering<br />
of arguments to and fro now than there was in the two<br />
or three years after broadcasting was introduced. And<br />
from that point of view, I think there is much to be<br />
thankful for.<br />
I would think, on the whole, the average level of<br />
debate, yes, has risen. There are many thoughtful<br />
speeches. I was tempted to think that might be due,<br />
particularly in recent years, to a rising level of educational<br />
attainment, until I remembered myself that<br />
formal education let's remember it has hardly<br />
ever been the test of distinction in the political field.<br />
George Pearce, about whom I will speak a little later,<br />
who was a very great Parliamentarian, was a bush<br />
carpenter. His formal education terminated, no doubt,<br />
when he was 13 or 14 years old. You can't go by that.<br />
Some people have talents and improve them all the<br />
way through their lives and some people have some<br />
talents and improve them early and neglect them later.<br />
The real test is whether a man has a continuing mental<br />
attack on the problems that he deals with. And from<br />
that point of view, I think that the debate which has<br />
improved, I think, has not improved solely because of<br />
formal education, though that's of great assistance, but<br />
has improved because it is increasingly seen how<br />
serious a matter the government of the country is.<br />
Now I wish I could say that I thought the standard<br />
of reporting had risen. I don't think it has, quite<br />
frankly. I remember saying to John Curtin, when he<br />
was Leader of the Opposition, " You know, John, you<br />
can speak, why do you read?" And he said, " Well, I<br />
am an old journalistic sweat, but you know, if I want to<br />
be reported, I must hand it out." Now, there is a bit of<br />
truth in this, isn't there? A bit of truth. A recent debate<br />
in the House that I listened to with great interest<br />
consisted of one speech that was read and a reply that<br />
was brilliant and destructive of the whole argument,<br />
but it was the first one that arrived. I don't think, if<br />
you will allow me to say so, that the standard of reporting<br />
has been maintained, and that is, I think, to a<br />
substantial extent, the responsibility of Ministers who<br />
read out Second Reading speeches and of other people<br />
who read out speeches in the course of debate and find<br />
it convenient to hand them over.<br />
The whole glory of Parliamentary debate is that it<br />
is debate, that it has cut and thrust and nobody ever<br />
produced any cut or thrust by the mere process of<br />
producing a piece of paper. This is the clash of minds.<br />
It is the debate which swerves from one side to the<br />
other under the pressure of events, which accommodates<br />
itself to a new argument, to a new thought. This<br />
is the most fascinating thing in the world.<br />
It is because of this, you know, that Winston, when<br />
the House of Commons was to be rebuilt after the<br />
War, said, " We will not have it any bigger. We will<br />
not have a House of Commons that can hold all the<br />
Members of the House of Commons." People,<br />
strangers to his way of thinking, thought, " Well, how<br />
crazy." But they did it, because the whole idea was<br />
PROSPECT, No. 3, 1964 </p>
<p>that if you have a place so vast and wide that all the<br />
intimacy of discussion disappears, you might as well<br />
have Parliamentary debate conducted by a series of<br />
essays printed and distributed and a division list at an<br />
appropriate time. The importance of Parliamentary<br />
debate is, I think, something, weUl, in my mind, it is<br />
something essential to the continuation of democracy.<br />
And that's why I am glad to say that I think, on the<br />
whole, the average level of debate is better now than<br />
it was when I came up here.<br />
' NTOW I've been going a long time perhaps I might<br />
just say a few words to you about some of<br />
' th ose who have been here and who are no<br />
longer alive. It would be impertinent of me to discuss<br />
the living. But there have been some very interesting<br />
people here and I have time only to mention four or<br />
five of them to you.<br />
There was Mr. Lyons himself, the first Prime<br />
Minister under whom I served. He had a bland<br />
manner. He had a genial manner. He was the perfect<br />
family man. This has great appeal in Australia, and<br />
very properly, but it is sometimes not realised that<br />
Lyons was a positively brilliant Parliamentarian. I<br />
don't think I ever knew a better. Let me explain to you<br />
what I mean.<br />
You fellows have all known, you've seen this. Question<br />
time, and So-and-so has got a curly one and unless<br />
a Minister knows what it is about, he may easily foozie<br />
it a little or he may be driven back into a series of<br />
requests to put it on the Notice Paper; this is a testing<br />
time, Question Time Without Notice. I remember on<br />
two or three occasions when I was his Attorney-<br />
General, going to Mr. Lyons and saying, " I just heard<br />
a vcry nasty question, a very difficult question is going<br />
to be put to you today. It is a rather complicated<br />
matter and there is no earthly reason why you should<br />
have heard of it." And he would say, " Well, no, I<br />
haven't, but do you know about it?" And I would say,<br />
" Yes, I've managed to." And he would say, " Well, sit<br />
down and tell me." Then I would explain this matter<br />
as best I could. And then I went away in my then<br />
youth and innocence, saying to myself. " I hope he<br />
remembers what I've told him." This was a stupid<br />
thought of mine because, sure enough, up came the<br />
question and, sure enough, up Lyons got and made a<br />
reply, so charming, so bland, so accommodating, which<br />
didn't answer a single point ( Laughter) that I had<br />
mentioned, that when he sat down, the questioner who<br />
had begun full of malice, would be seen smiling and<br />
saying, " Thank you very much." ( Laughter.) Now,<br />
this is not to be sneezed at. ( Laughter.)<br />
When they say a man is a great Parliamentarian, you<br />
must never just think that means he has been in<br />
Parliament a long time. It means that he knows every<br />
noise and every creak in the machinery and he understands<br />
the human beings who are in Parliament and is<br />
able to proceed without becoming involved in avoidable<br />
arguments or talking himself out of his own Bill.<br />
We've seen all these things happen, haven't we? I<br />
think that Joe Lyons was a great Parliamentarian. I<br />
learned a lot from watching him and listening to him.<br />
Not enough, but a lot.<br />
Well, then, the next man I want to mention is the<br />
late Mr. Scullin. Now, he was Prime Minister before<br />
PROSPECT, No. 3, 1964 I came here. He was Prime Minister from the end of<br />
1929 until the end of 1931, beginning of 1932, and I<br />
came here about this time in 1934, and when he had<br />
been defeated and when the United Australia Party<br />
came in, Scullin became the Leader of the Opposition<br />
as a former Prime Minister and he held that post for<br />
oh, I've forgotten two or three years perhaps.<br />
Then he announced he was retiring from it. I was<br />
staying in this hotel ( which then, of course, I hasten<br />
to say, was not as good as it is now) and so was he,<br />
and we walked down together to the House, and I<br />
said, " Sir, why are you retiring, or is that an impertinent<br />
question?" He said, " No. I don't mind telling you.<br />
You see, I had a short but very torrid time as a Prime<br />
Minister." ( He encountered the whole blast of the<br />
Depression.) " Well, I know what happens in the Prime<br />
Minister's Office. I know how many matters are the<br />
subject of despatches, of cables with other governments<br />
and other people and there are some things you<br />
would love to be able to talk about which you can't<br />
talk about because they are in a certain stage of<br />
negotiation. Now ( he said) the only man who ought to<br />
be the Leader of the Opposition is a fellow who has<br />
never had that responsibility so he can put all the<br />
embarrassing questions in the world. I can't and I won't<br />
because I know what is going on inside the Administration<br />
and so, I am disqualified by former office."<br />
IWAS very impressed by this, though I didn't<br />
follow the example ( Laughter) later on myself.<br />
This was completely illustrative of Jim Scullin.<br />
He was a very fine man. He was a man of<br />
sensitive honour and integrity. He was indeed. I don't<br />
think he was a very great thinker, if I may say so, with<br />
respect, you know. He wasn't one of the great statesmen<br />
in that sense, but he was a man of intelligence and<br />
activity and an acutely conscientious man, and I think<br />
that the Labour Party was indeed fortunate to have a<br />
man of his quality, even for this brief period in which<br />
it was in office in 1930 and 1931.<br />
Now, of course, no talk about these people would<br />
be complete without mentioning Billy Hughes. Well, I<br />
can't say too much about this because I saw Hughes<br />
only in his declining days 1934, well, he was never<br />
going to be Prime Minister again. He had a beautiful<br />
waspish wit which could be produced out of a blue<br />
sky in Cabinet, but quite frankly, his ideas were no<br />
longer constructive and his estimates of public opinion,<br />
an element to which he attached a great deal of<br />
importance, were not very frequently right. Now, I<br />
don't know. I am going to read Fitzharding's book on<br />
Billy with loving care because I would like to discover<br />
a few things about him. All I want to say is that in<br />
my time there was nothing about that he had to do or<br />
say which would exhibit more than a gleam of what he<br />
must have been at an earlier stage in his life. But his<br />
wit was devastating, and his use of his deafness,<br />
masterly. ( Laughter.)<br />
I remember on one occasion, for example, he<br />
brought up a proposition in the Lyons Government<br />
which was so hopeless that even the rest of us, in our<br />
ignorance, realised how hopeless it was; he didn't get a<br />
supporter. Everybody said " No" for a variety of<br />
reasons. Now in those days, those old days, we didn't </p>
<p>have a Secretary to the Cabinet, we didn't have Jack<br />
Bunting sitting around or somebody making notes. The<br />
Junior Honorary Minister we even had those at that<br />
time, illegally but the Junior Honorary Minister<br />
was supposed to retain some memory, and the Minister<br />
concerned would put his submission over and get the<br />
Prime Minister to say " approved". This was the<br />
record. I remember one day when Billy had brought<br />
up some proposition which was really too bad for<br />
words, you see ( Laughter), and we all picked it to<br />
pieces, but he had taken his little machine out of his<br />
ear and so at the end of it all, he picked up his submission<br />
and passed it over to Lyons and said, " Well,<br />
I take it you can sign this." ( Laughter.)<br />
ISAID something about George Pearce. You<br />
know, there was a great legend about Pearce.<br />
Because he had gone in almost at the same<br />
time as Billy, though from another State, because he<br />
had followed Billy's fortunes in crossing the floor of<br />
the House, the ' sadition was that George Pearce was a<br />
sort of Vicar of Bray. I would just like to tell you that<br />
in my opinion, speaking about Canberra, I have never<br />
sat in Cabinet with an abler man than George Pearce.<br />
This needs to be said in justice to his memory. He was<br />
a man of 6xtraordinary experience, of course, and he<br />
had great wisdom and he wasn't just somebody who<br />
could say, " Oh, well, you know, I remember." He<br />
would analyse a problem just like that, and having<br />
analysed it, he didn't leave all the loathesome bits and<br />
pieces on the table as so many people do, if they<br />
analyse a problem, but he always knew which one to<br />
pick out and say, " Well, now, that's the thing. That's<br />
the determining factor," and give you his reasons for it,<br />
and his influence on these matters was tremendous and<br />
not negative but positive at all times. Some day, justice<br />
will be done to George Pearce. As it is, I look back on<br />
my great good fortune to have sat in a Cabinet with<br />
him for three years, as one of the things in my life.<br />
Well, then, I have just time to mention quite briefly<br />
two men who deserve far more than some mention.<br />
One is John Curtin and one is Ben Chifley. I can speak<br />
a little about them because they have gone.<br />
Curtin and Chifley will never be understood until<br />
you realise that they were utterly different. I have<br />
never known two men more unlike. They were great<br />
friends, but two men more unlike I would never<br />
expect to see, because Curtin's instincts were towards<br />
a sort of broad philosophical approach to matters. He<br />
liked nothing better than to sit down and put his feet<br />
on the table and have a talk to you about something<br />
that didn't bear on the Bill before the House, but bore<br />
on the general philosophy of politics or indeed of the<br />
world. He was not the greatest speaker in the world,<br />
with great respect, because he leaned too much to long<br />
Latin endings which rather blurred the fine edge of his<br />
speech. But he was a very good speaker, of course,<br />
and would have been greater but for that. This was<br />
part of his makeup. He did have the kind of mind<br />
which liked to range over a wide variety of problems<br />
and if he had had the opportunity in his life of professing<br />
one of these subjects in a university, he would<br />
have done it with great distinction. He was, of course,<br />
a charming man, a delightful man, and a good friend. Chifley was just about the opposite because his mind<br />
didn't range over a wide variety of objects. He dealt<br />
with the economic problems and financial problems.<br />
He had had no preliminary training for them. He<br />
achieved a complete mastery of them. He didn't aspire<br />
to be a great speaker because his voice was against<br />
him, but he still spoke to the point, and he was a great<br />
man to be able to sit down with and discuss matters<br />
with. I would say that he had immense strength in a<br />
narrow field. Curtin's strength was distributed over a<br />
variety of fields. I think that if John Curtin hadn't had<br />
Ben Chifley as Treasurer, his Government might have<br />
fallen earlier or something else might have fallen out<br />
differently. Two utterly different men.<br />
Now, it is easy to say that Chifley well, he was<br />
an engine-driver and he lacked formal education. True<br />
enough, and yet, you know, one of the interesting<br />
things about that man was that I discovered over a<br />
period of years that he had what I thought, at any<br />
rate, an almost immaculate literary judgment. He read<br />
widely, his judgment was good, he could determine<br />
what was shoddy and what was not. It was an illuminating<br />
experience to sit with him on the Literary Fund,<br />
when from time to time we advised about publications<br />
and fellowships and the like. He had clear views,<br />
strong views; I thought tremendously informed and<br />
sound views on these matters and it was entirely to his<br />
credit that while I was thinking of some very periphrastic<br />
way of explaining this, you know, so as not<br />
to hurt anybody's feelings, he was quite capable of<br />
sitting up and saying. " Well, if you don't mind, Miss<br />
So-and-so, I think it's all bloody nonsense" ( Laughter),<br />
which shows the immense advantage in life of having<br />
for a time been an engine-driver and not a barrister.<br />
( Laughter.) So there they were, two different men. The Labour<br />
Party, if I may say so, has great reason to be thankful<br />
to them and I venture to say that each of them in his<br />
turn contributed to making this Parliament a place of<br />
some distinction. Let me say, gentlemen, it is a place of<br />
some distinction. It has had, over the whole of its<br />
history, a number of men of great distinction and we<br />
do well to recognise that. I get pleasure out of it as I<br />
look back over these 30 years. Indeed, as I look back<br />
over the 30 years and remember all the people who<br />
mattered, who emerged like that, I take leave to doubt<br />
whether I will have many happief memories at the end<br />
of my life than recalling them and the work that they<br />
did. Now available:<br />
