<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Good morning, sir.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Jeremy, good to be with you again.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Good to talk with you. I can't believe that all of these talks</p>
<p> with the Democrats have gone on and I see this morning that they're</p>
<p> now prepared to negotiate. What have they been doing up until now?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we've had a lot of talks and people are still talking.</p>
<p> And you'll excuse me, given that, for not wanting to go into</p>
<p> a lot of detail. Obviously the Democrats have some ideas on issues</p>
<p> in this package which are different from ours. And when you're</p>
<p> in a discussion or a negotiation of something like this you have to</p>
<p> try and see what common ground you can reach and have a look at that</p>
<p> against your own taxation principles. Now, it's difficult for</p>
<p> me to really say any more than that, Jeremy. We want tax reform. We</p>
<p> believe the country needs it.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>You've got a mandate for it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We got a mandate and we can't at the moment get it through the</p>
<p> Parliament because we had hoped that it might have been possible to</p>
<p> enlist the support of Senator Harradine and that did not prove possible.</p>
<p> We are now and have been for some days in discussions with the Australian</p>
<p> Democrats. Now, I respect the fact that on a number of issues they</p>
<p> are coming from a different point of view but in other areas we have</p>
<p> some common ground. And it's really a question in a process like</p>
<p> that of being patient and trying to see what common ground you can</p>
<p> reach and then asking yourself, well is that the sort of common ground</p>
<p> that is sufficiently consistent with our starting point to still be</p>
<p> able to say, well we have a plan, we have a package that we're</p>
<p> comfortable with. And I guess they're in the same situation.</p>
<p> Now, that happens in these positions and clearly our preference would</p>
<p> have been for the Parliament, the Senators, all of them, the Labor</p>
<p> and Democrat and so forth, to have said, well, even if we don't</p>
<p> like it, the public voted for it and we'll let it go through.</p>
<p> That would have been the sensible thing for the Labor Party to have</p>
<p> done but that hasn't happened and we're talking now. I can't</p>
<p> really say any more than that. I remain very committed to tax reform.</p>
<p> And you know how important a number of elements of the package are</p>
<p> to me  the reform of Commonwealth-State financial relations</p>
<p> and personal income tax cuts for middle Australia, I think that's</p>
<p> very important, and reforming the indirect tax system in a big way,</p>
<p> and a whole lot of things. And making sure that the bush is looked</p>
<p> after. These are goals. I understand, of course, that consistent with</p>
<p> some of that the Democrats also have goals.</p>
<p>Now, I may not agree with their policies, they don't agree with</p>
<p> mine, but you have to be pragmatic as well as idealistic and explore</p>
<p> the maximum extent to which you can find common ground and then examine</p>
<p> how that stacks up against your going in position. And they will be</p>
<p> doing and are doing the same thing. Now, that's the nature of</p>
<p> a negotiation. I have to say that I've found the negotiations</p>
<p> to be cordial and forthright. I find her a person who is good to deal</p>
<p> with. Her views on a lot of things are different from mine. I accept</p>
<p> and respect that. Clearly on a number of things she comes from a very</p>
<p> different position but I have found her very direct and candid in</p>
<p> the discussions and that's always useful. I don't find any</p>
<p> games being played in the discussions. It's a question of saying,</p>
<p> well, I want this and I'm not prepared to agree to that. Well,</p>
<p> you then move on and talk about something else. So, it's a long</p>
<p> process.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Yes, it seems to me that they're trying to get you to bargain</p>
<p> away Australia's future.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Jeremy, we took a package to the last election that we thought</p>
<p> was fair and balanced and progressive and very good for Australia.</p>
<p> And we obviously are not going to agree to something that destroys</p>
<p> the basic integrity of that package.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>So you are prepared to, if they want too much, walk away from that</p>
<p> tax?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, in any of these negotiations if you get to a point where</p>
<p> one side wants you to go a bridge too far then the negotiations stop.</p>
<p> Now, we are still talking. It is, has been, and it remains a very</p>
<p> complicated issue. I am a patient man but nobody's patience is</p>
<p> every inexhaustible but, as I say, we're still talking and we</p>
<p> continue to talk. And I've always been fairly cautious in the</p>
<p> views I've expressed about the possibility of getting support.</p>
<p> You may remember in relation to Senator Harradine. I only ever said</p>
<p> I was hopeful. I was never over-confident. And I just think you keep</p>
<p> trying and you keep talking and we are certainly doing that. And,</p>
<p> as I say, I've found them very constructive discussions and I</p>
<p> have found her a forthright, direct person with whom to deal and that's</p>
<p> very valuable.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Some are saying that you could do a handshake deal on it today, do</p>
<p> you think that's possible?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, Jeremy, I think all I can say is that talks go on and I hate</p>
<p> this  I'll take that back, you have a perfect right to</p>
<p> ask that question  but I would rather say no more than that.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Another headline I saw this morning was, I want more, says Harradine.'</p>
<p> Senator's demand for, what was is it, a billion dollars for the</p>
<p> extra bit of Telstra for sale?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, I saw that. I didn't listen to all the details of his press</p>
<p> conference but Brian Harradine, who along with Mal Colston, continues</p>
<p> to hold the balance of power in the Senate until the 30th</p>
<p> of June.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>But isn't that extortion?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he wouldn't see it that way. All of these things, in the</p>
<p> end, involve value judgements. We would like to privatise the whole</p>
<p> of Telstra. We took it to the people at the last election which, incidentally,</p>
<p> we won and we obviously are  if it has to be, we will privatise</p>
<p> the rest of Telstra in two bites. Our policy is, sell another 16 per</p>
<p> cent, then have a public inquiry as to whether all of the community</p>
<p> service obligations, particularly for the bush, are being delivered</p>
<p> and then, if you've done that sufficiently, then you go ahead</p>
<p> and sell the rest. Now, at the moment it looks very hard to see where</p>
<p> we're going to get the extra votes for selling the whole lot.</p>
<p> There's a possibility that we could get support to sell another</p>
<p> 16 per cent. And what Senator Harradine, as I understand it, is saying,</p>
<p> well, I don't really like this but I might go along with</p>
<p> it if I'm satisfied that out of the proceeds of the sale of Telstra</p>
<p> there are benefits provided to the community, particularly the community</p>
<p> I represent.'</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Yes, it just seems that the average Australian, I'm sure, it</p>
<p> would get up his nose or her nose to sort of see the way in which</p>
<p> Parliament seems to be run by a handful of people. It doesn't</p>
<p> seem like it's democrat and it must be enormously frustrating</p>
<p> for you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Jeremy, I would much have preferred to have had a majority in both</p>
<p> Houses of Parliament from the time I was elected Prime Minister but</p>
<p> I haven't and I've had to live with this situation.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>You've got to work with that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And you do have to work with it and the community expects you to try</p>
<p> and make it work. They don't expect you to sell-out on what you</p>
<p> really believe in and I won't be doing that on anything. But</p>
<p> they do expect you to try hard and see if you can reach in relation</p>
<p> to a number of things. You take industrial relations legislation.</p>
<p> We didn't get everything in '96 that we wanted but, gee,</p>
<p> the industrial relations scene in Australia now dramatically different</p>
<p> and better from what it was three years ago. So we got quite a lot.</p>
<p> We got the great bulk of what we wanted. Now, that is the approach</p>
<p> that I believe the community expects you to try and achieve. On some</p>
<p> issues you can achieve it. On other issues you can't. But I don't</p>
<p> see, under the present arrangement, any prospect that the current</p>
<p> situation in the Senate is going to dramatically alter. I think it</p>
<p> very difficult to see the Coalition, no matter how well it does in</p>
<p> general elections, having a majority in its own right in the Senate</p>
<p> under current arrangements. And this is partly a consequence of a</p>
<p> decision that was taken way back in 1984 by the Labor Party with the</p>
<p> support then of the National Party to increase the size of the Parliament</p>
<p> which made it necessary to elect 12 Senators from each State and half</p>
<p> of them retire every three years. And it's very hard for there to</p>
<p> be other than a three/three division on each occasion between, sort</p>
<p> of, the broad left hand side of politics and the broad right hand</p>
<p> side of politics.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Anything you can do to reform the Senate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, well look, those things are possible but they're not on my agenda</p>
<p> at present.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Yes, it just seems so strange that a States' house....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that was the original idea of it but we have a very rigid Constitution.</p>
<p> Now, the federal compact remember was about the smaller States agreeing</p>
<p> to enter the federation in return for guarantees they'd not be overwhelmed</p>
<p> by the population for preponderance in Sydney and Melbourne. So you</p>
<p> produced a single member House....single member constituencies</p>
<p> in the House of Reps on the basis of population and then a strict</p>
<p> division between the States. Now, that has been the federal compact</p>
<p> from the beginning. Where it's gone wrong is that the Senators have,</p>
<p> sort of, pushed aside the notion of a States' house. Now, anyway,</p>
<p> all I can tell you is, I mean, at the moment I am absorbed with taxation</p>
<p> discussions and so forth.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>I know. Let's go back to that. They are saying that what you are prepared</p>
<p> to offer, a GST free food, people earning more than $50,000 a year</p>
<p> to lose....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think you are reading from the front page of The Australian.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>I am, yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't want to, sort of, confirm or deny any of those stories.</p>
<p> Jeremy, I don't think I can and I don't wish to be impolite but it's</p>
<p> very difficult when you are continuing to talk to people, it's very</p>
<p> difficult to then, sort of, publicly respond to questions about those</p>
<p> discussions without the other side saying, well, you know, what's</p>
<p> he doing this for.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I do have to preserve the good faith of the discussions that have</p>
<p> been proceeding with the Democrats.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, out of left field, maybe it's right field, I don't</p>
<p> know. I heard this morning that there is just a possibility that the</p>
<p> compromise could be that you would offer a five per cent GST on absolutely</p>
<p> everything and that the sums would more or less work out. Can you</p>
<p> give me any indication whether that has crossed your mind?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, a lot of things have crossed my mind over the last couple</p>
<p> of years on this but look, I can't, I don't want to comment on that</p>
<p> either I am sorry.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Okay. The...an interesting thing I saw the other day, I think,</p>
<p> in the Financial Review about some sort of a loophole in the</p>
<p> superannuation scheme looking like leading the coffers of something</p>
<p> like a billion dollars. The Taxation Commissioner coming out and saying</p>
<p> that he was going to close all of this down retrospectively, how would</p>
<p> you react or the Government react to that retrospective action?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you can't retrospectively change the law without parliamentary</p>
<p> approval. I haven't read that story. Generally speaking we are opposed</p>
<p> to retrospective legislation. I have in the long distant past been</p>
<p> involved in some in relation to blatant tax avoidance schemes. I carried</p>
<p> quite a few scars from that experience back in the early 1980s but</p>
<p> I thought it was justified because people were rorting their fellow</p>
<p> citizens in the arrangements they entered into. But when you have</p>
<p> got something which is in the nature of a loophole then you could</p>
<p> have different circumstances. But quite frankly I haven't turned my</p>
<p> mind to that and beyond stating that principle it's hard for me to</p>
<p> say anymore. I'll have a look at that, I am glad you have drawn it</p>
<p> to my attention.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>There was a story around yesterday about a major breakthrough with</p>
<p> osteoporosis. What it is is a new drug that rebuilds bone density...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>...and we were talking to the Professor at a Repatriation Hospital</p>
<p> in Sydney, he said that he heard that I was talking to you today and</p>
<p> he said: you might ask the Prime Minister why it is that women are</p>
<p> given this drug tax free, or it comes to them on the free list, yet</p>
<p> men are not allowed to have it, they have to pay the full total, which</p>
<p> I think are quite high. The question is...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I will investigate that. I didn't know that. That's the second thing</p>
<p> I haven't known this morning, I am sorry.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>He was just calling for a little even-handedness...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's fair enough. I am very happy to have a look at that.</p>
<p> I might just say, if I can, you'll forgive the political commercial.</p>
<p> While we are on the subject of drugs and medical science I hope everybody</p>
<p> who is interested in this area knows that we have promised to double</p>
<p> the expenditure on health and medical research in this country as</p>
<p> one of the centrepieces of Peter Costello's Budget.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And we are very proud of the fact that we will be putting this country,</p>
<p> once again, very much at the forefront of medical science and research</p>
<p> because we really do have quite outstanding people. And you not only</p>
<p> have those advances of which you spoke but many of the other advances</p>
<p> in relation to arthritis and so forth are just terrific.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, did you catch up with this business in Melbourne where</p>
<p> Anne Peacock has been, or somebody tried to ban Anne Peacock from</p>
<p> joining the Liberal Party?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course I have read it. It is stupid. I mean, really. I mean, what</p>
<p> are they going on with, I mean, it is absolutely crazy. She is a first-class</p>
<p> person, she comes from a great Liberal family, she is married to a</p>
<p> great Liberal. But in her own right, which is the most important consideration,</p>
<p> she is an intelligent articulate person of impeccable character. I</p>
<p> mean, why on earth anybody would think they are serving any interests</p>
<p> by trying to keep her out or even delay her joining the party, I mean,</p>
<p> that's just, the stupidity of it absolutely amazes me.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>It sounds like a strange petty bureaucratic...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that sort of thing turns people off political movements. And</p>
<p> as far as I am concerned I don't want any of that nonsense in the</p>
<p> Liberal Party anywhere in Australia. Not just in Victoria but anywhere</p>
<p> in Australia. It really is absolute nonsense and I think the message</p>
<p> would have well and truly been received by now given the reactions...the</p>
<p> reaction that I have given and also I know the reaction of Jeff Kennett</p>
<p> and Peter Costello to senior Liberals in Victoria.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Demonstrations, I understand, will be held across the nation today</p>
<p> to protest the Federal Government's censorship laws, what's your feeling</p>
<p> on attempts...I don't even know if it's feasible to try and effectively</p>
<p> censor the Internet?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think we have an obligation to try. What the community wants is</p>
<p> protection of young people against certain material on the Internet.</p>
<p> I think that is absolutely defensible. I subscribe generally to the</p>
<p> theory that adults should be allowed to read, hear, and see, and view</p>
<p> whatever they choose to, of course. But there is an argument in relation</p>
<p> to children and there is no reason in-principle why that shouldn't</p>
<p> be extended to the Internet. And I think what the Government has done</p>
<p> in that area is absolutely defensible and the reactions of many are</p>
<p> completely, how should I put it, they're over the top. They are</p>
<p> basically seeking a society where you don't say enough is enough</p>
<p> in relation to anything. Now I don't hold that view. Certainly</p>
<p> when you're talking about children I certainly don't. And</p>
<p> I just cannot understand on ordinary common sense grounds believe</p>
<p> that the constant bombarding of young people with certain material</p>
<p> doesn't have an influence on their conduct. I mean I find it</p>
<p> impossible to believe that people who might otherwise be socially</p>
<p> vulnerable aren't influenced by constant and repetitive violence</p>
<p> on videos and on movies. I find it impossible [inaudible] otherwise.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>The video games must be.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It must. I mean it doesn't matter to kids who've got an</p>
<p> otherwise supportive and stable environment in which to live. But</p>
<p> those that haven't, I think it does further deepen their sense</p>
<p> of alienation and hostility towards the community. I'm not a</p>
<p> psychologist, I'm just another bloke I hope who has some understanding</p>
<p> of human behaviour and I will never be convinced otherwise, and I</p>
<p> think most Australians would feel the same way. Therefore you have</p>
<p> an obligation, however imperfectly you might deliver on it, to achieve</p>
<p> something in this area. And I say to those who are protesting against</p>
<p> it that you don't understand the mood of middle Australia on</p>
<p> this. You don't understand how deeply many parents feel about</p>
<p> it with some justification.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, just hang on for one second. Let me take one call</p>
<p> here. Roger from Williamstown. What would you like to say?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Jeremy, and Prime Minister.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Yes Roger.</p>
<p>Mr Howard, two points I'd like to make briefly here. The first</p>
<p> one being I keep hearing of talk of a mandate for a GST. Your Liberal-National</p>
<p> Coalition achieved 36% of the vote. Now that means that 64% voted</p>
<p> against it. That hardly equates to a mandate. Secondly I hear you</p>
<p> talk about reformation of the Senate. Will that be reformed in the</p>
<p> light manner to which our voting system was vandalised behind the</p>
<p> public's back last July? Thank you.</p>
