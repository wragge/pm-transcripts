    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we only have a limited amount of time, but I don';t have any introductory statement. If people have any questions they want to ask me, please go ahead.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What does the escape of Rohman al-Ghozi say about the Philippine police [inaudible] in terms of…</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well obviously it';s a setback and we';re all disappointed it';s happened. It';s a bit setback, but it is a domestic matter for the Filipinos to deal with. I';m not going to start passing judgements except to express the obvious that it';s a real setback. But it does underline the crucial importance of ongoing cooperation and the need for steady institution building in many of the countries in the region to reduce the likelihood of this sort of thing happening in the future.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Has Australia wasted its $5 million?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It looks as though they opened the door for them. Isn';t it a bit farcical?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Nigel, I';m not in charge of the jails in the Philippines and I really can';t answer that question. I';m not going to even try, and you know that courtesy and other things require that I respect the right of the Filipino authorities and their jurisdiction in this matter. Plainly it is a big setback and nobody is happy about it. I think the Filipino Ministers made that pretty clear to a number of you last night. But as to the detail of it, how it happened, who is responsible, what is going to occur – that is entirely in the domain of the Philippines. Alison asked me a question – is our money being wasted? I don';t believe it is, but obviously it';s only reasonable of Australia to seek to be fully informed when a proper investigation is conducted.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is it enough though - $5 million?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you know what these things are like Glenn. Nothing is ever enough. We have responsibilities for a lot of things and obviously it';s a valuable contribution.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>When were you informed of his escape and how?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I wasn';t informed until late yesterday afternoon. I';m not sure whether I didn';t learn about it on CNN.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>After the press conference?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes. Oh yes. I knew nothing about this at the press conference – nothing.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So what does that say though about the level of cooperation between intelligence agencies and governments? Indeed if you';re looking at Australia and the Philippines, when you have to find out about the escape of this country';s most prized terrorist captive on television.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don';t think it reflects in any way adversely on our police or our intelligence services. I want to say that immediately.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But by inference you';re suggesting…</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look Karen I';m not… I';m in another country. I am their guest and I am not going to make running remarks, easily made. I have greater responsibilities than others in these matters and I';m not going to make gratuitous remarks. I don';t know all of the circumstances and neither do you, and I don';t think anybody should be jumping to conclusions. I think we should all respect the responsibility of the Filipino authorities and let them investigate and let them in time have something to say. You asked me a direct question – did I know when I had the news conference? No. I don';t know who knew then, but I didn';t know and I don';t suspect any of the Australian agencies knew.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did President Arroyo say anything to you at the banquet last night?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, does the escape raise the threat level of further terrorist attacks, do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It';s too early to make a judgement on that Jim.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So have you had any briefing at all as to the consequences of this escape?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have not had any direct briefing on the consequences in that context.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think that Australian authorities should be looking at…</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can assure you that Australian authorities are always looking at travel advisories in the Philippines.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And do you think that it';s possible that they [inaudible] the level of warning?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>If there is a need to revise them, they will be revised.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what';s your response to the comments by the unofficial spokesman…</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The unofficial spokesman.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well that';s what…</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he doesn';t have a lot of credibility. He';s made these sort of statements before and I don';t intend to react to rhetoric of that kind.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you';re opening the new embassy here. Are you satisfied that our diplomats will be as safe as they can in it? I mean…</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, yes. The Ambassador looks very relaxed to me, very comfortable and relaxed. But it will not be… look, it';s not easy and I don';t think we should underestimate the responsibilities that our representatives have in areas of potential terrorism, but we have taken certain steps and we are satisfied, very satisfied, with the new arrangements. But I take the opportunity of recording my great respect and admiration for the job that our diplomats are doing in increasingly difficult circumstances. I think we should all be aware of that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] obviously means that the threat is still there.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well of course it is, of course it is. Nobody is suggesting the threat is not there. I mean, look we are living in a very difficult period in our history, especially in this region. This region is vulnerable to terrorism and the strength of Jemaah Islamiah and associated organizations should not be underestimated. And the breakout indicates that. It';s not just disappointing. It also indicates that. I mean, anybody who thinks that this terrorist thing is being exaggerated is kidding themselves. It';s not being exaggerated. It is quite serious and it is real, and the Australian community… I believe the Australian community does understand that. I think the Australian community is well aware of how real it is. But it';s important that we work as closely as we can with our friends, and we should do everything we can to build their agency capacity. And cooperation between our agencies is very important. And also an understanding of how critical intelligence services are. Intelligence services are vital. The fight against terrorism requires very strong and effective intelligence.</p>
<p>   JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, overnight the Indonesian authorities have increased the threat risk alert in Indonesia, especially around the capital and major government buildings. Does Australia agree with that assessment, and have we…</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it';s not a question for Australia to agree or disagree with an assessment made by another country, any more than it';s for other countries to agree or disagree with assessments we make. If there is any need for any change in the Australian assessment, then a change will be made.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Has there been any reassessment of …</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look I';ve been asleep overnight like the rest of you and I can';t answer that question.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister you appeared to be getting a bit of a briefing this morning on your walk.  Would you like to shed any light on that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I am briefed all the time Nigel.  It';s the only way I have any hope of keeping ahead of you blokes and even then I don';t always make it.  Good try.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Australia';s participation in President Bush';s anti-proliferation initiative.. what will that do to the risk of nuclear threat to Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the question of a nuclear threat to Australia is dependent upon a number of things.  It';s dependent essentially upon political motive and capacity. At the moment my understanding is that the countries that possess nuclear weapons and could deliver them to Australia are not likely to want to do so, and in fact most unlikely, certainly.  As far as North Korea is concerned well I don';t think North Korea has any functioning weaponry, if I can put it that way, that';s capable of delivering it.  Whether they might in the future develop something like that I don';t know.  As to whether saying your are prepared to take a stand against anything you';re increasing the risk of something happening in the future, well, history is replete with what happens to countries that imagine they buy immunity from running away from difficulty.</p>
<p>   JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister are you in a position today to give us any more details on initiative regarding Hicks and will the Australian government at the very least be represented at the military commission as an observer?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not in a position to say any more at present and that applies to both of those questions.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>In your discussion with the President yesterday did you raise any concerns or did you touch on the issue of entrenched corruption in the Philippines law enforcement agencies?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I didn';t use words to that effect no.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did you raise concerns?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We talked about a whole lot of things, but look Steve, there is an understanding I';m sure in this country of some of the challenges just as there is an understanding in other countries.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So did you talk about the need for, as you referred earlier, improvement of institutions…?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think the circumstances of the description I used in relation to the grant package indicated the need to build institutions.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will the AFP be involved in looking for this missing…?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don';t know.  We would get involved if we were asked, but I mean, we';re good, we';ve got a lot of resources but we don';t, we';re not involved in essentially domestic policing operations, but look, if the AFP were asked to provide help we would be willing to do so but I am not aware of that request but if we are asked we will do so, we are ready to help but we also respect the sovereignty of the government of the Philippines.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, on the Solomon Islands, will Australian soldiers deployed to the Solomon Islands be empowered to shoot to kill?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not going to, off the top of my head, try and interpret what their rules of engagement are particularly as they haven';t been settled by me.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So you haven';t cleared anything yet?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I haven';t Alison.  But what ever I clear will be the right thing in the circumstances.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And you';ll tell us about it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>If I am asked I will give a proper answer and a truthful answer as I always do.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, are you concerned about the Australian Magnesium Corporation losing its contract with Ford?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I haven';t been briefed on that.  That was not one of the subjects that I was briefed on this morning.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The federal government does have a fairly large ….</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, it does, but I haven';t been briefed on it Steve and I';m not going to say any more.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Looking forward to tomorrow can you just give us some outline of what you expect to be saying to the Japanese tomorrow?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Wait till will we get to Japan.  You don';t need anything on Japan.</p>
