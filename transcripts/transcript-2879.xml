3 April 1973<br />
MATERNTTY LEAVE<br />
Cabinet today decided that all pregnant officers<br />
and employees, irrespective of whether they are married or<br />
unmarried, and irrespective of whether they were pregnant<br />
or not when first employed by the Commonwealth, shall have<br />
the right to receive at least 12 weeks' maternity leave<br />
on full pay. This leave is to commence six weeks before the<br />
expected date of confinement and shall continue for six<br />
weeks after the date of confinement.<br />
Each permanent officer proceeding on leave of<br />
absence for maternity purposes, must be re-employed at the<br />
end of her period of leave ( which may extend to 52 weeks,<br />
inclusive of leave without pay) in her former position or<br />
in a position at a level as near as possible to the<br />
position held by the employee at the commencement of her<br />
maternity leave.<br />
Temporary employees returning from maternity<br />
leave shall be given preference of employment over any<br />
other person seeking employment with the Commonwealth.<br />
male employees will be provided with additional<br />
leave of one week with pay at the time of birth of a child<br />
where the employee requires the leave to take care of the<br />
mother and/ or children during the immediate post-natal days.<br />
Legislation will be introduced as soon as possible<br />
to extend the new provisions to all Australian Government<br />
employees. These benefits will apply from 1 January 1973.<br />
These benefits will not be dependent upon union<br />
membership. CANBERRA, A. C. T. </p>
