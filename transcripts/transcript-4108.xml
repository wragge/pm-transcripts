ELECTORAL TALK<br />
The interests of all Australians will be best served only<br />
if our rural communities are sound and thriving.<br />
Clearly, our national social and economic goals will be<br />
P'lso best advanced if our primary producers are working in<br />
a climate of stability and confidence.<br />
This week the Government received some good news about the<br />
Australian beef industry.<br />
After two long years of low prices, instability and sluggish<br />
demand, the cattle industry can now look confidently ahead<br />
to a period of strengthening prices and increased demand.<br />
As announced in the Parliament this week, the Government<br />
has negotiated with the United States for a starting quota<br />
of almost 8,000 tons more than we had in the previous year.<br />
With the shortfall we will receive during the year the quota<br />
will almost certainly exceed last year.<br />
The Japanese have also announced that they will accept<br />
4S, 000 tons in the current six months. This compares with the<br />
40,000 tons they took for the whole of 1975. The<br />
Government believes that the quota for the other half of<br />
the year will be even larger.<br />
The Japanese decision to announce quotas on. a six month basis<br />
is good news for the industry.<br />
There is little doubt that six monthly quotas will add a<br />
stability and predictability to the trade which has been<br />
missing since Japan reopened' its market to imports.-Since the<br />
market was reopened in June last year quota announcements<br />
were irregular and created planning difficulties for producers<br />
and exporters. That should now be overcome.<br />
Further, the Canadian Government have also removed the<br />
global quotas they had on meat imports. This should allow<br />
Australia to greatly exceed the 28,000 tons we sold to them<br />
last year. </p>
<p>The Soviet Union has also shown enrco'raging interest in<br />
making significant purchases. In fact, Lt has'recently<br />
brought 10,000 tons from New Zealand. We expect success<br />
in this area soon.<br />
There are maay smaller ma-. Lkets for beef particularly in<br />
countries such as Sweden, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Middle<br />
East which are also indicating greater interest in our<br />
beef. On the debit side, the European Econo mic Community still<br />
has a virtual embargo on imports. The Government, however,<br />
will continue to vigorously seek access to that important<br />
market. The figures released this week by the Bureau of Agricul. tural<br />
Economics put the state of the beef export industry in perspective0.<br />
The Bureau expects our export sales this year to top $ 507 million.<br />
This is a 57 percent increase over-the $ 323 million figure<br />
for last year.<br />
Suimming up, the beef industry in Australia can look to a<br />
brighter future mainly because of the efforts of our exporters,<br />
better market conditions and successful Government negotiation.<br />
The dairy industry, however, is still reeling from the highly<br />
unsympathetic attitude of the former Labor Government.<br />
The industry's grave problems which are particularly<br />
critical in Victoria have been made much worse by<br />
domestic production cost inflation. This inflation has reduced<br />
the rr'Pa~ ginal profitability of many thousands of Australian<br />
dairy, farmers.<br />
This cost inflation, together with the protracted slump in the<br />
world market for skim milk powder and casein has created<br />
severe liquidity problems for the dairy industry.<br />
In an effort to overcome this particular situation, I with<br />
my colleague, Ian Sinclair, have held talks with the State<br />
Governments about a scheme to put a floor into the market<br />
for exported dairy products.<br />
Tte Federal Government has offered each State the underwriting<br />
guarantee of $ 300 per tonne for skim milk powder. The<br />
Federal Government will contribute two thirds of this amount.<br />
Additionally, my Government will make available $ 2 million<br />
in cooperation with the States for dairy adjustment under<br />
rural reconstruction. This amount is on top of the $ 1. S million<br />
promised by the former administration for dairy adjustment.<br />
I believe there is a strong and continuing need for rural<br />
reconstruction. The Government intends to make sure that dairy farmers caught<br />
in the income squeeze are entitled to all the social welfare<br />
benefits to which every other Australian is entitled. </p>
<p>There are significant pockets in the dairy industry<br />
where the average family income is way below the average<br />
income in Australia.<br />
The Henderson report on poverty indicated significant<br />
areas of rural poverty. The Government has a commitment<br />
to attack poverty in the cities it has an equal commitment<br />
to . attack poverty where it exists in the countryside.<br />
It is clear that the dairy industry needs specialist assistance.<br />
To this end the Government has commissioned onc of Australia's,<br />
and the wvorld's,, most distinguished agricultural economists<br />
to report as soon as possible on future policy options for*<br />
the dairy industry.<br />
The economist is Sir John Crawford, the former head of the<br />
Department of Trade and the Department of Primary Industry,<br />
who is widely recognised for : his studies on the rural economy.<br />
We have asked Sir John to report to us as an Industries<br />
Assistance Coip. missioner on what additional steps can be<br />
taken to relieve the industry's problems.<br />
Finally, I want to make it clear that the Government sees<br />
both city and country dwellers as Australians with equal<br />
rights and equal opportunities.<br />
We. have been concerned with the divisions between the city<br />
and country provoked over the three years of Labor rule.<br />
This led to uncertainty amongst primary producers and<br />
contributed to the rural economic recessions.<br />
This Government will not allow that to happen again.<br />
