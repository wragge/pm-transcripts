    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was saddened today to learn of the death of much-loved playwright and author Gwenyth (Gwen) Meredith.</p>
<p>For a whole generation of Australians, listening to 'Blue Hills' was a daily pastime.</p>
<p>Gwen wrote every episode of 'Blue Hills', the long-running radio serial about rural life in Australia which ran on the ABC from 1949 to 1976.</p>
<p>'Blue Hills' told us stories of bush life that struck a sympathetic chord with Australians in all parts of the nation.</p>
<p>Gwen also authored the successful radio series 'The Lawsons' and published numerous books drawing on the Australian way of life.</p>
<p>In 1967 Gwen was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for her services to radio entertainment and was later made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for her services to the arts.</p>
<p>On behalf of Janette and myself and the Australian Government, I extend my condolences to Gwen's family and friends.  </p>
