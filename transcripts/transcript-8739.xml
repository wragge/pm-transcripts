TRANSCRIPT OF PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. PJ. KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
GATT ROUND SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 1992<br />
PM: A few of you have asked me for comments about the announcemenits over night or<br />
yesterday about the agreements between the United States and the European<br />
community on agricultuire and I'm quitc happy to amplify what I said yesterday<br />
and that is this is the best news for Australia in a decade, easily in terms of<br />
international trade. It allows for a completion, a successful conclusion of the<br />
Uruguay Round in the other aspects and it means in the first time in a decade we<br />
are able to see a reduction in price supports for domestic agricultural production,<br />
particularly in Europe and the United States. We'll see a very large reduction in<br />
export subsidics and a large reduction in export volumes, in practical terms about a<br />
36 per cent reduction in export volumes, about the same in the value of money<br />
spent on export subsidies,. You've often heard our opponents say of the<br />
Govermecnt that we've been too intcrested in niultilateralism, well this is<br />
multilateralism roaring, this is rnultilatcralism making a world statement that bilateral,<br />
that is, arrangements between two countries, can't possibly make and it's<br />
the first great break for Australian farmers in a decade. Our farmers are, of course,<br />
efficient, they don't require the subsidies others have had, they'vc had to sell into<br />
polluted markets and I'm pleased to be able to say that after six years of work on<br />
the part of everybody, but particularly the Australian Government will bring, I<br />
think, sanity to agriculture markets through the 1990s.<br />
J Isn't there still a risk though Prime Minister that the French are going to pull the<br />
plug on this because of the prcssure that they're coming Linder with their farmers?<br />
PM: They are under pressure but it's a matter of whether President Mitterand exercises a<br />
veto, we're told at this stage his inclination is not to but I'm also happy to say that<br />
the White House today complimented Australia in its Support for these<br />
arrangements, first of all in the establishnment of the Cairns Group, its leadership in<br />
the Cairns Group and the fact that Australia has been right at the front of every<br />
cheek by jowl negotiation over six years. So if we sce, as think we have now<br />
every prospect of seeing, a successful conclusion of this in Geneva as we bring the<br />
other things into the round likec rvices, trade in intellectual property rights etc., it </p>
<p>will set up for Australia and Australian farmers and Australian agriculturalists and<br />
the agriculturalists of the Third World who have been so often left out a much<br />
better international trading system in agriculture.<br />
J: How quickly would you expect the United States to wind back its use of EEP<br />
given that EEP is intended as retaliation against Europe?<br />
PM: Well it means that none of these things can grow, they'll actually be declining and<br />
therefore all these programs like EEP will go the way of all the other subsidies.<br />
J: Do you have any idea what this will mean in dollar terms for Australian farmers?<br />
PM: No, you can't quantify it in dollar terms but it just means that a 36 per cent<br />
reduction in export subsidies and volumes over six years, it means everything is<br />
heading the right way and in some of these reductions they just continuc after the<br />
six-year period is over. So it means that thc whole backdrop in trade in<br />
agricultural products world-wide will have changed for Australian farmers.<br />
J: On a related issue, talking about the White House, do you have any comment on<br />
the Clinton Administration's partiality to our system of<br />
PM: Apparently the Administration has shown some interest and some data has been<br />
collected on the Australian industrial relations system and by a number of<br />
Democrats on our health -system, on Medicare. You know Governor Dukakis was<br />
in Australia last year looking at this very thing. Hc spent two and a half months<br />
looking at the Australian health insurance -system. So I think there are elements of<br />
the Democratic Party and maybe the administration who think Australia can<br />
provide some structure or some framework on health and on enterprise agreements<br />
and it is, I think, thc nature of the enterprise agreements. is what they are interested<br />
in. T7hat is, how in a consultative structure we can get productivity change and<br />
workplace changc on a national basis.<br />
J: Do you think that Australia should follow US lead on the issue of homosexuality'<br />
in the Defence Forces?<br />
PM: Well that's a matter we've got to discuss ourselves. But in terms of issues of<br />
weight, the issue of weight here is overwhelmingly these sets of announcements in<br />
Europe which I think are going to be phenomenally good news for Australian<br />
farmers.<br />
J: Mr Keating, do you think they'll have any impact on Australia's attempt to get 3<br />
-per cent economic growth this year?<br />
PM: I think thcy'll be a great confidence boos ter to world confidence. There hasn't been<br />
that much leadership by the G7 countries in pulling the world out of the recession<br />
but I think this, which is the essence of leadership, will mnatter a great deal in </p>
<p>confidence levels and let mec say I think President Bush deserves a high note of<br />
congratulations here because I can't imagine any more important or sweeter note<br />
that he could end his presidency on than setting up an historic set of international<br />
arrangements in trade. When his presidency is completed this will go on for now<br />
forever as one of the very clcar achievements of his administration.<br />
1: Do you think this breakthrough could have an impact this financial year on the<br />
world economy?<br />
PM: No. But it will certainly have an impact on confidence and it will give all the right<br />
signals to all the people that produce agriculture and not only that but all these<br />
other things that will conmc with it trade in services, intellectual property rights,<br />
It's giving us a proper background, a proper world order to trading arrangements<br />
and hopefully it will do in agriculture and services what the so-called Kennedy<br />
Round did in goods in the 1960s. I mean this, brought to fruition will be an<br />
historic change.<br />
J: Mr Keating, on anothcr matter, will you be announcing revised Budget forecasts?<br />
PM: Michelle, that's something you should ask the Treasurer. I'm just not aware of<br />
exactly where he is on the forecasts at all, or where the Treasury is.<br />
J: Do you have any response to Dr Hewson's call for a series of debates on<br />
PM: I notice Dr Hewson is being advised by cvcrybody about selling the GST. I notice<br />
today we've got a group of Sydney luminaries telling him how he sho'uld-better<br />
market his product. Thbe problem is the product is no good. It's not that the<br />
marketing is no good. He has been to every city and every provincial city in the<br />
country talking about it now for a year, one could hardly say the sales effort hadn't<br />
been reasonably ambitious, but thc product is basically a dud, that's the problem.<br />
This always happens with political parties when they have, I think a remark you<br />
made, a very profound one Michelle over the weekend, that is, when political<br />
parties have trouble with policies they say they have a communication problem.<br />
The problem hcre is not the communication problem, the problem for the Liberal<br />
Party is the product ' is wrong for Australia. I notice that commentators like Ross<br />
Gittins and Max Walsh and others have said that Fightback, the GST, is no<br />
solution to Australia's problems in restoring growth whatever one might think<br />
about it in thc medium term. But even in the medium term, does anybody believe<br />
that a tax on the whole nation's food, clothing, goods, services to abolish payroll<br />
tax and reduce thc price of petrol is going to produce the new Australia. I mean<br />
does anybody think that reducing the price of petrol and removing payroll tax is<br />
going to, prcsto, produce a new country. TIs is what the Liberal Party has<br />
advertised this policy as and the fact is this is a very crude lix switch which takes<br />
money off one group of people and gives it to another and it's very disruptive. The<br />
problem the Liberals have is that the product is no goo~ d, not that the sales program </p>
<p>is no good. It wouldn't matter how good the sales program is, they're selling a dud,<br />
but they still believe in it.<br />
J: But Treasury secretary Tony Cole said it was good for exporters?<br />
PM: No he didn't. If you want to see what the Treasury had to say about this, read the<br />
Treasury analysis three-quarters of all families worse off, a 4 to 6 per cent affect<br />
on inflation, that is, putting our inflation rate back near double digits. This thing is<br />
a macro-economic disaster and tic it in with their industrial relations and you've<br />
got a full-blown disaster.<br />
ends </p>
