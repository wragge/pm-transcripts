e. g. FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 21/ 1959.<br />
DEPUTATION ON WAGES CLAIMS<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister, Rt. Hon. J. M~ wn M. P.<br />
The Acting Prime Minister Mr. McExwn, received a<br />
deputation this morning from the Australian Council of Trade Unionsq<br />
the High Council of Public Service Organisations, the Council of<br />
Professional Associations and the Australian Council of Salaried<br />
and Professional Associations.<br />
The deputation urged three things:<br />
First, that the Government should direct the Public<br />
Service Board to negotiate with the Organisations with a view at<br />
least to interim increases in remuneration pending the final<br />
decisions by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on the<br />
claims before it.<br />
Second, that the Government should agree to any<br />
decision by the Commission being given retro-active application.<br />
Third, that the Government should restore the<br />
independence that the Public Service Arbitrator possessed prior to<br />
195~ 2. Mr. McEwen explained to the the deputation that their<br />
first request touched a question of high policy which had been<br />
considered by the Government on a number of occasions. The truth<br />
was that the Commonwealth had responsibilities which went beyond<br />
those of an ordinary employer concerned to do justice to his<br />
employees. Of course, the Commonwealth wanted to see justice done<br />
to its employees. However, decisions that thie Commonwealth took<br />
had a far-reaching effect beyond its own employment. They bore<br />
upon the State Public Services and private industry.<br />
It was clear that whatever decisions were arrived at<br />
by the Commission on the many and varied issues raised by the<br />
claims before it, they could have a profound bearing on the future<br />
standards of remuneration of professional and " white collar"<br />
workers throughout Australia. Doubtless that was why the<br />
organisations had elected to take their claims to the Full Commission.<br />
Certainly the circumstances required that the decision<br />
on these issues should be taken by the supreme Commonwealth<br />
tribunal, and that they should not in any way be prejudged by<br />
action by the Commonwealth.<br />
Mr. McEwen pointed out that not dissimilar considerations<br />
applied with respect to the margins claims for industrial<br />
type employees. Mr. McEwen explained that nothing that he had said<br />
derogated from the Government's concern to see conciliation<br />
practised to the fuill. The Public Service Board had, in fact,<br />
often engaged in conciliation.<br />
Mr. McEwen was gratified to find that no one was<br />
alleging that such delays as had occurred in the hearing of the<br />
current cases could be ascribed to action on the part of the<br />
Commonwealth. He said the Government wanted the-. current . cases-to-.-.<br />
go ahead with the greatest expedition.."<br />
In reply -to suggestions that perhaps the Commission<br />
might be disposed to make an interim Award, Mr. McEwen said that<br />
if such an application were made to the Commission the Commonwealth<br />
would not automatically oppose it. It would carefully<br />
weigh the substance of the application and the whole of the<br />
circumstances and advance a responsible attitude to it. </p>
<p>" 4 </p>
<p>As to retro-activity, Mr. McEwen said he was aware<br />
there had been occasions when there had been agreement to backdating<br />
the application of an Award. If an application for retroactivity<br />
were made to the tribunal the Commonwealth would<br />
determine its attitude in the light of all relevant circumstances,<br />
Finally, Mr. McEwen observed that the decision taken<br />
by the Government in 1952 to provide for references and appeals<br />
to the Commission from the Public Service Arbitrator was a<br />
deliberate act of its policy in the field of industrial relations,<br />
