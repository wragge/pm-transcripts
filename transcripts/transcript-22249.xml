    <content><![CDATA[<p>I welcome the news that Jawad al-Maliki has been invited by the re-elected President of Iraq, Jalal Talabani, to form a government.</p>
<p>  This appears to have ended a political stalemate. The establishment of Iraq's first democratically chosen, full-term government will be a milestone in that country's hard march to a brighter and freer future.</p>
<p>  The domestic security position in Iraq makes it imperative that the Government now to be formed by Mr Maliki is one of national unity. Key positions must be occupied by Kurds and Sunni, as well as the Shi'ite majority.</p>
<p>  Only a government of national unity can provide the environment in which the process of reducing the current unacceptable level of internal violence can begin.</p>
<p>  The people of Iraq have, on three occasions, defied murderous intimidation to embrace the democratic process. The chosen representatives must now match the courage of the Iraqi people and give them the stable, accountable government they so desperately need.</p>
<p>  Australia remains strongly committed to a secure and democratic Iraq. Our nation will continue to assist in the security of that country until that task can be effectively discharged by the Iraqis themselves.</p>
