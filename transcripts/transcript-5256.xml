PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW AT FAIRBAIRN 12 FEBRUARY 1980<br />
Question Prime Minister will you stop an Olympic Gamnes teams going from<br />
Australia? Prime Minister<br />
I have said that I do not think that anyone in this country or any<br />
other will be withholding passports from athletes. But certainly<br />
we are seeking to persuade, and we will seek to persuade as hard<br />
as we can in relation to that. I have had a good deal to say about<br />
the Olympic Games over the last day or two in response to questions<br />
and I do not really want to add to it. But what I would like to do<br />
is to remind everyone that the issue is not the Olympic Games, the<br />
issue is the Soviet invasion and occupation of Afghanistan, a nonaligned<br />
country and one that had every right to believe that it<br />
would be allowed to work out its own future in its own way, making<br />
mistakes if it was going to. But that would have been their business.<br />
It had every right to believe that it would not be invaded by a<br />
large and overwhelmingly powerful neighbour. Now if the independence<br />
of countries is to be respected, we have to try and establish the<br />
circumstances where this kind of event cannot occur again. I have<br />
been encouraged by what I have seen in the United States where there<br />
is a sense of determination and a sense of unity of a kind which<br />
many people told me they had not seen since 1945. And I was also<br />
encouraged by what I found in Europe about the ultimate strength<br />
of the Atlantic Alliance and the determination that what has happened<br />
in Afghanistan will not be repeated. That determination was common<br />
to all the people I spoke to.<br />
Question Prime Minister, with respect on the Olympic Games again; you didn't<br />
answer my question.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No look at the moment there are discussions and people can become<br />
too preoccupied with an issue that is important and I'. have spoken<br />
strongly about it and if it is necessary will repeat what I have<br />
said. But I have also said that nobody is in the business that I<br />
know of, certainly not the United Kingdom, not Australia, not New<br />
Zealand, of withholding passports. Now there are questions of<br />
negotiations and discussions that are going on in relation to that<br />
and it is not necessary to say more about that at the moment. And<br />
it is easy,, and. I can understand it, because everyone has got a<br />
sympathy. Everyone would have preferred to have the circumstances<br />
in which the Games could go ahead as Games and not a political<br />
event and be. a significant sporting success. But the Soviets<br />
have politicised the Games they have said so in their own terms<br />
and I have used the quotes on more than one occasion and you will<br />
be by now familiar with them. But they say the awarding of the Games<br />
to Moscow is a mark of support for their foreign policy and that<br />
kind of statement, which has been propagated very widely in the<br />
Soviet Union, I would believe makes it difficult for -national<br />
olympic committees and for individual athletes. But again let us not<br />
be diverted into thinking that a discussion about what happened to<br />
the Olympic Games is the essence of the issue before the international<br />
community at the present time. It is not. The Soviet invasion of 2 </p>
<p>Afghanistan is the issue. The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan<br />
is the issue. and the increased tensions and dangers that come as<br />
a result of that.<br />
Question Surely we have got to do more than to show our displeasure<br />
at the Soviet action?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well we have done a great deal more.<br />
Question ( inaud)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well let us see what happens. I believe that we are in for a long<br />
haul, M colleague, Andrew Peacock said that it's not a return to<br />
the Cold-' ar and it is not. But it is not detente either. I do<br />
not know who will be coining the phrase or the words that will<br />
depict the new period that the world is entering. But it. will be<br />
a period for some time of increased tension and increased difficulty<br />
and that will impose increased costs on nations that are determined<br />
to preserve their national independence, the integrity-. and safety<br />
of their own people. And that ultimately is the most important<br />
and vital obligation on any government and especially on a democratic<br />
government.<br />
Question Will this mean defence cuts?<br />
Prime minister<br />
Well it certainly does not mean defence cuts. I would have thought<br />
and I have made it quite plain.. I have recalled for reports. The<br />
Defence Department and the Minister will be putting matters to us<br />
and there are increased obligations that we have already accepted in<br />
relation to the Indian Ocean. It is my belief that we-will need to<br />
be on a higher plateau in general defence capacity and preparedness.<br />
But the Government has finally to determine precisely what should be<br />
done. 000---</p>
