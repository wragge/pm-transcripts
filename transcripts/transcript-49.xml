COPY Minister for the Interior,<br />
Parliament House,<br />
Canberra, AOC. T.<br />
2 February, 1959.<br />
My dear Prime Minister, Knowing your keen personal interest in having the<br />
policy making core of the Defence and Service Departments located<br />
in Canberra at the earliest possible moment, I thought you w-ould<br />
like to know what progress has been made to date. This letter,<br />
therefore, describes in detail what has been achieved.<br />
In November 1956, Cabinet directed<br />
that the policy making' core of the Department of<br />
Defence and such other staff as would need to<br />
be associated with it in Canberra for policy<br />
making purposes should transfer to Canberra at<br />
the earliest possible date; and<br />
that planning be based on 450 500 being transferred<br />
initially, i. e. as soon as office accommodation was<br />
available in Block of the Administrative<br />
Building, and a further 600 about six months later.<br />
Subsequently a scheme to provide for the transfer<br />
Wof approximately 1,100 personnel over a period of one year from<br />
1st January, 1959 was submitted to and approved by Cabinet in<br />
February, 1957. Itthe same timae approval was given for a<br />
programme of works, including additional houses, schools, and<br />
associated engineering works, totalling an estimated X. 37.2m. to<br />
be spread over a period of five years from 1st July, 1957. This<br />
programme was designed not only to meet the needis of the transferees<br />
but also to meet the normal requirements of the rapidly expanding<br />
city. The prime task, however, was to effect the transfer of<br />
personnel of the Defence and Service Departments and I am pleased to<br />
be able to report that the first phase o' the movement has been<br />
Wsatisfactorily completed.<br />
According to figures 2urnish1-ed by the Depart-ment of<br />
Defence, 433 positions w-ere transferred i n the first group. Some<br />
of these, however, were vacant and the occupants of some other<br />
Wpositions declined to transfer. The actual numzber for whom<br />
accommodation had to be found totalled 372. including 47 United Kingdom<br />
and United States Liaison staffs. Approxi mately another 20 were<br />
accommodated at Fairbairn and Harman or obtai-ned private accommodation.<br />
The following shows the type of accommodation provided<br />
for the transferees Houses 208<br />
Flats 62<br />
Hostel bed 02<br />
372<br />
Despite this requirement it was possible during 1958<br />
to allocate to the ordinary waiting l. ist a total of 864 tenancies<br />
made up of 637 new houses and flats and 227 re-allocated vacancies.<br />
This compares with the previous best total of 759 during 1956, and<br />
the previous three-year average of 625. , Acccrdingly, far from<br />
suffering any loss because of the transfers, the need to accelerate<br />
the building programme to meet the transfers benefited those who<br />
were on the waiting list for houising.<br />
The need to provide such a large number of houses,<br />
flats and hostel beds, and at the samne time make some provision for </p>
<p>2.<br />
people already in Canberra who were waiting for housing,, presented<br />
quite a formidable task. A special unit was set up in the Department<br />
of the Interior to do the initial planning and programming and to<br />
co-ordinate the activities of the various agencies concerned in the<br />
overall development involved. Much credit is due to these officers,<br />
to the Department of Works, and over the latter half of last year,<br />
to the newly created National Capital Development Commission, for<br />
seeing the programme through and ensuring that requirements were met<br />
on time. It was a striking example of good planning and excellent<br />
team work between the various departmental agencies, backed up by<br />
close co-operation on the part of the contractors and men on the job.<br />
The actual movement of officers with their families,<br />
and of departmental papers and records, was also carried out very<br />
smoothly and the officers of the Department of Supply and the<br />
removalists are to be commended on the manner in which this largescale<br />
movement was organised and completed.<br />
The allocation of accommodation was carried out in<br />
Melbourne some three months prior to the move commenci-ng by officers<br />
Sof the Department of the Interior. Every officer being transferred<br />
Wwas interviewed and given a choice of house types, consistent with<br />
his family needs. As a result quite a number of officers have<br />
expressed their appreciation for the way in which they were treated.<br />
The Victorian Branch of the Administrative and Clerical Officers<br />
Association in their official journal, " Viewpoint" had this to say<br />
" Victorian ' Viewpointt ! wishes to add its<br />
congratulations to the officers from the Department<br />
of the Interior who carried out the allocation task<br />
in Melbourne with such patience, fairness and<br />
courtesy that every future tenant went away with<br />
complete satisfaction." 1<br />
The Secretary, Department of Defence, also expressed his thanks for<br />
the way the job was handled.<br />
As you know, additional schools, pre-school centres<br />
and mothercraft centres also formed an important part of the fiveyear<br />
construction programme. Some of these were required urgently<br />
to relieve the over-crowding that had occurred due to the rapid<br />
growth of Canberra over recent years, as well as to meet the<br />
increased requirements arising from the transfers. Since 1st July,<br />
1957, additional school accommodation has been provided as follows<br />
Class-athe Maximum~<br />

( Yi Portions only of these two schools have actually been taken<br />
over but the remainder will be available later in the year.)<br />
In addition, the first stage of alterations and<br />
additions to Telopea Park School to convert it to a full High<br />
School has been completed, giving 24 classrooms and 18 other rooms<br />
with a total capacity of 95' 0.<br />

The denominational schools have also increased their<br />
accommodation. The Roman Catholic Church has made extensions to<br />
St. Edmund's College providing additional classrooms and science<br />
laboratories, and a new secondary school for girls has been opened<br />
this year at Braddon providing accommodation for 4-i00.<br />
The Canberra Church of England Boys' Grammar School<br />
has built a block of new classrooms, assembly hall and ancillary<br />
accommodation, giving additional capacity of 120. The Girls'<br />
Grammar School has at present under construction a block of five<br />
classrooms, science laboratory and ancillary accommodation,<br />
As a result of the school. expansion programme the<br />
increased school population at the beginning of the school year has<br />
been absorbed without difficulty and the fu.-ther increase expected<br />
from the second moves to commence in July can also be absorbed,<br />
Three new pre-school centres and two mothercraft<br />
centres were also opened during 1958.<br />
Second move. The Defence Department has stated<br />
that it is anticipated 624i positions w-il l be transferred in the<br />
second move scheduled to commence in July next. Construction<br />
to meet the housing requirements of this group is proceeding.<br />
Individual needs are not yet knoivm but based on the pattern of<br />
types of accommodation sought by those in the first group, there<br />
appears to be little doubt at this stage that requirements can be<br />
met in time to permit of the second movement commriencing on<br />
__ schedule. ( Sgd. GORDON FREETH. </p>
