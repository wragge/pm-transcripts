<p>The Gillard Government will provide $5 million to Police Citizens Youth Clubs and Blue Light organisations across Australia as part of the $40 million National Crime Prevention Fund announced today.</p>
<p>Police Citizens Youth Clubs have a long and illustrious history in Australia.</p>
<p>They use a range of sporting, recreation and education programs to help young people to develop their skills, character and leadership.</p>
<p>The programs run by Police Citizens Youth Clubs have proven effective in reducing crime amongst young people by providing positive interactions with police, targeting local needs and building a sense of citizenship with the communities that they work.</p>
<p>Police Citizens Youth Clubs have been helping kids across Australia stay on the right track for three quarters of a century.</p>
<p>There are over 150 Police Citizens Youth Clubs and more than 250 Blue Light organisations across Australia. The linkages that exist between Police and young people in these communities stands Police Citizens Youth Clubs in good stead to target street and gang-related crime.</p>
<p>Police Citizens Youth Clubs have a long record in reducing and preventing crime amongst young people. These targeted funds will allow them to build on that and reach even more of Australia's youth.</p>
<p>Each Police Citizen Youth Club will be able to apply for grants of up to $300,000 for projects that target socio-economic disadvantage and crime amongst young people.</p>
<p>Police Citizens Youth Clubs will be invited to apply for these grants from the last week in April. </p>
