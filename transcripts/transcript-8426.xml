TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH HINCH, CANBERRA<br />
27 FEBRUARY 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
H: And tonight it's good evening live, as you can see<br />
behind me, from the marble foyer at Parliament House.<br />
We are here for a special broadcast tonight, to follow<br />
up the release last night of Prime Minister Keating's<br />
Economic Package, ' One Nation'. A package that he<br />
says, is the best hope to kick-start a sick economy out<br />
of a recession he once said, we had to have. A program<br />
he says will generate 800,000 jobs in the next 4 years.<br />
If, and the polls show it's a big the Australian<br />
voters elect a Keating Government at the next election.<br />
Tonight my special guest in the exclusive interview<br />
after a torrid and controversial day in this House, if<br />
we can ignore the bells, Prime Minister Paul Keating.<br />
That's coming up next. I'm Derryn Hinch.<br />
H: In this House this afternoon I heard you in full<br />
flight, I thought you might not have a voice by the<br />
time you got here tonight.<br />
PM: Oh no, just a cup of tea gets me going again.<br />
H: I should say, welcome to day one of the election<br />
campaign, shouldn't I?<br />
PM: Not really, I think that the Government took the view<br />
that the economy was not recovering quickly enough. We<br />
had to do something to try and induce, to put a<br />
stimulus in it, to get a recovery going and to do some<br />
sensible productive things while we are at it. Now,<br />
there is no doubt it will have some impact on the state<br />
of the parties, but an election is so far off that,<br />
it's far enough away not to be able to say what<br />
influence it can have.<br />
H: Well, after all these budgets, all the Mini-Budgets,<br />
the Summit, the J curves, whatever, why should the<br />
Australian people believe Paul Keating this time? </p>
<p>PM: Well look, the recession has marred what was a fairly<br />
unblemished record for growth and employment for the<br />
Government. From 1983 to 1990 we had very fast rates<br />
of growth and very fast rates of employment. But the<br />
recessicon has knocked that off. It means that we are<br />
now not growing fast enough to take up school leavers<br />
and other entrants to the workforce, but what we wish<br />
to do is: to go back to doing what we were doing in the<br />
that's growing Australia, pulling that employment<br />
out of the economy and finding jobs for people.<br />
H: Now, yout have said recently, that you regret using the<br />
expression, ' a recession that we had to have', and it<br />
has come to haunt you hasn't it?<br />
PM: Well, it: was a slow-down we had to have. You see, we<br />
were spending twice the capacity the economy could<br />
produce, so it was slow-down we had to have. When you<br />
knock 0.1 out of GDP, it is a recession. And the day<br />
that happened I said it was a recession we had to have.<br />
Now as the recession got deeper it seemed like an<br />
H: Cool, Callous<br />
PM: an uncaring thing to say. But it was really<br />
shorthand for the slow-down.<br />
H: When youL talk about the recession we had to have,<br />
initially you did not mean it, but did you think it?<br />
PM: It was aL slow-down we had to have. You see, we had,<br />
it's as simple as this, we had spending running at 9<br />
per cent: growth and we had product, the economy,<br />
running at 4. So 5 per cent was coming as imports, so<br />
we had t~ o take the 5 out. Now, if you can do it<br />
precisel~ y and take the 5 and none of the 4, you are<br />
set. But what happened we cut into production and<br />
that's cut into employment, that's where the recession<br />
comes.<br />
H: But your Government, you, the then Prime Minister<br />
Mr Hawke, kept saying there wasn't a recession, there<br />
would not be a recession. You went into an election<br />
saying there would not be a recession, and there was<br />
and you personally, whether it was right or wrong, you<br />
personally are blamed for it.<br />
PM: I know that, I think every Treasurer is. But there is<br />
a similar recession in the United States, Britain,<br />
France, Canada and they are all deeper than Australia.<br />
And I think the thing we did not figure upon was the<br />
big coll. apse in asset values world-wide. When the<br />
world-wide financial market system decided that low<br />
longer funds, asset values of properties, of stocks, as<br />
that dropped out of the system, we were bound to have,<br />
as it turned out, a recession. Now we thought here we </p>
<p>could avoid that, we could fine tune it down so it<br />
didn't quite happen, but it did happen.<br />
H: But you are the experts and Joe Blows like me, we all<br />
seem to know, and our bank managers certainly knew, and<br />
small businessmen seem to know and the guys whose home<br />
loans jumped when you lifted the ceiling, jumped to 18<br />
per cent, they seem to all know long before you did,<br />
that thiLs recession was hurting like hell all over<br />
Australia.<br />
PM: We knew it was hurting. We knew the slow-down would<br />
hurt, but it was whether it would cut into production<br />
and employment was the issue. And whether we could cut<br />
the excess spending out, but without cutting GDP,<br />
without cutting the economy. But the collapse in asset<br />
values, the fact that we actually pulled inflation.<br />
See, in the last two years Derryn, we have taken<br />
Australian inflation down from 7 per cent to 1 1/ 2. As<br />
that's come out, it's had quite traumatic effects<br />
inside the economy, that is the reliance upon property<br />
prices continue to rise, and all other asset prices.<br />
With that gone so was the confidence that you could buy<br />
an asset; and sit there do nothing and the rise in value<br />
went with it. So the banking industry decided not to<br />
keep funding these things and that's where basically,<br />
the dept~ h of the recession has come from.<br />
H: But also, apart from the non-funding, the interest<br />
rates went through the roof, and for a while there you<br />
did not mind that.<br />
PM: No, that: knocked the spending out. But remember this I<br />
knocked interest rates down, in January ' 90, over two<br />
years ago. It shouldn't have given us a recession of<br />
this depth. It's a combination of interest rates and<br />
the coll. apse of asset values, and the fall in<br />
inflation, of expectation.<br />
H: Does it scare you, we'll come and talk about jobs after<br />
a break, but does it scare you that you have this image<br />
as the grim reaper, because of the recession, because<br />
of the collapse of the small business especially,<br />
because of people out of work, how can you go on to win<br />
an election when you have that reputation?<br />
PM: Well, I will just make this point, that in the years<br />
that I wras Treasurer and including to this day, we<br />
producedt in Australia 1 1/ 2 million jobs. We actually<br />
produced 1.8 million and we lost 300,000 in the<br />
recession.<br />
H: How many of them were in the Public Service?<br />
PM: Virtually none. They were all private sector jobs,<br />
million. In the previous 7 years, under John Howard<br />
and John Hewson, that period, including their<br />
recessio'n, they created 350,000. That is, 1/ 5 of the </p>
<p>jobs that the policies associated with me created. But<br />
what I say is, don't look at our 1 year or 18 months,<br />
look at the whole 8 years.<br />
H: Unless you want the people out of work?<br />
PM: Well OK. People are entitled to take the bat to you if<br />
they are out of work. I accept that. But again, what<br />
I want to do is get into a recovery and get cracking<br />
again.<br />
H: Mr Prime Minister, we'll take a break and come back and<br />
talk about jobs from Parliament House.<br />
H: And back with the Prime Minister. Mr Prime Minister,<br />
800,00 jobs in 4 years. Got good headlines this<br />
morning, very ambitious and sounds great. But most of<br />
the 800 surely will be 3 years down the track when you<br />
may not be Prime Minister?<br />
PM: No, no, we would have about the first 150-200,000 in<br />
the first year.<br />
H: And therefore, 600-700,00 when you might not be Prime<br />
Minister?<br />
PM: Well, that's a possibility, but they will still be<br />
there, whatever the outcome of the election, they will<br />
still be there Derryn. I mean, the fact is, that these<br />
are not phenomenal. Employment and the production of<br />
the economy are very closely related. If the economy<br />
grows, employment grows. If we get the economic<br />
growth, the' employment comes through.<br />
H: What scares me about these figures is, you've ( lot in<br />
1996, 800,000 jobs, you say, that means 4 years from<br />
now, unemployment will still be over 7 per cent.<br />
That's your projection?<br />
PM: With a very high level of participation. Very high<br />
level of people looking for work.<br />
H: And of -those people, anybody who have been out of work,<br />
long term unemployed, unemployed for more than 12<br />
months, there could be between 300-400,000 of those in<br />
that number?<br />
PM: There could be good quarter of a million in that<br />
number. That's a lot.<br />
H: What worries me is that you and I, believe it or not,<br />
are exactly the same age virtually. We are 48, we've<br />
both got jobs at the moment. But what of the guys of<br />
our age who look in the shaving mirror in the morning<br />
and know they will never work again. What do you say<br />
to them? </p>
<p>PM: Well, I think that they will, because you see, the<br />
velocity... Let's take the late ' 80s, when we had<br />
unemployment down to 6 per cent, because the change is<br />
about 4 per cent, it is not 10, it's about 4 because we<br />
never ever got the below 6. But it's like a pool.<br />
People come into one end and go out the other. It is<br />
the time they spend in the pool of unemployment that<br />
matters. The velocity of movement through the pool,<br />
and if we can speed economic growth up, the movement<br />
through the pool, there still may be 9 or 10 per cent<br />
unemployment in the pool, but the time through it and<br />
out the other side is quicker. So that's what matters..<br />
If you can get the growth up, you can get the<br />
employment. And we should get growth of the order...<br />
Look, if we can't grow at 4 per cent a year Derryn,<br />
which is what I have got in these forecasts, we ought<br />
to give the game up, the whole lot of it.<br />
H: People are saying that you can't grow at 4 per cent.<br />
So what happens if you don't?<br />
PM: Well, we have always grown at 4 per cent through the<br />
anti we can grow again. If we can't run the<br />
Australian economy... You need 3 per cent a year to<br />
simply -take the new interest of the workforce uip, not<br />
to touch unemployment, just to take the new ones. You<br />
need 3 per cent growth. If we can't do 4, we should<br />
pack it in me, the bureaucracy, the Parliament, the<br />
lot of us.<br />
H: Would you?<br />
PM: Well, I mean the place can do 4. It should be able to<br />
do 5s. All of the countries around us can do 6, 7 and<br />
8 per cent a year growth. The reason we can't do<br />
better " than 4 is that we've had this lousy equipment<br />
stock from the ' 60s and ' 70s. We can't run faster than<br />
4 without spilling into imports. So what we are about<br />
now, is trying to run it at 4 and gather the capital<br />
stock back.<br />
H: Coming back to the credibility thing where back in the<br />
you said, ' hang on, we are setting our sails'.<br />
PM: But we dlid, we had more growth than they have ever<br />
seen. The trouble is it wasn't sustainable.<br />
H: Then you would have had about as much chance as setting<br />
your saiLls as Australia in the next Americas Cup?<br />
PM: But no, we did 4.2 on average. The previous 7 years<br />
was 1.8 on average. The last 7 or 8 years was 4.2 on<br />
average. It ran twice as fast. The problem is,. it was<br />
a spendiLng spree at the end. I mean, we had every<br />
punter, sort of buying property and shares and stocks<br />
and taking over companies. We never had the savings to<br />
go around and the Government said look, we can't go on </p>
<p>borrowing from the rest of the world, we have got to<br />
pull it all back to something we can live within.<br />
That's what it was about. Now, when we go out of this,<br />
what are we going to go out with? Low inflation, 1 1/ 2<br />
to 3 per ce ' nt. We are going to go back with a good<br />
profit position in companies, we are going to back with<br />
a good level of investment, with now a new tax regime<br />
which is also going to help investment and with it will<br />
come good employment.<br />
H: Let's move on to GST because I was in the House this<br />
afternoon and obviously, that is going to be the major<br />
issue you will stick to John Hewson over in the months<br />
ahead leading up to the election.<br />
PM: It is such a dull idea.<br />
H: Well, if it is such a dull idea, do you recall, back in<br />
1985 in the economic summit, that was your preferred<br />
option, 12 1/ 2 per cent wasn't it?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
H: You fought like tooth and nail for it.<br />
PM: I did.<br />
H: You got rolled and looked shocked when you got rolled,<br />
by the deals that where made. Do you know what you<br />
said about GST after that? At the press conference?<br />
Have a look at this for a few seconds.<br />
" It's a bit like Ben Hur. We've crossed a line<br />
with one wheel off".<br />
H: What's your campaign now?<br />
PM: Well, I will tell you what it is. The direct tax<br />
system the income tax system, was then like a bag.<br />
You've seen these bags of water which you see in the<br />
bush, it: was like a bag of water with holes in it. The<br />
holes were the tax avoidance that dripped all the water<br />
out of t~ he bag. So when governments get desperate and<br />
they can't fix their tax system, they say, look don't<br />
worry, we will get it when they spend it. So you pull<br />
a plastiLc bag under the bag, that's the GST. When the<br />
GST was refused to me, I fixed the holes in the bag. 1'<br />
made the Australian income tax system totally secure.<br />
It didn't need..<br />
H: So you now say the GST will now work?<br />
PM: It doesn't need another thing receptacle underneath it<br />
to collect it from<br />
H: I watched you in the House today, and you are saying,<br />
taxing the clothes on kids backs, taxing their food on </p>
<p>their table, and I recall in radio days criticiLsing you<br />
for using that exact same language.<br />
PM: But we h-ad massive compensations in that package. This<br />
is not true of this thing. And can I also say, in<br />
Italy for instance, Governments there couldn't run the<br />
tax system, it was just haemorrhaging away. So I said,<br />
' don't worry, let's not try and fix it, we will collect<br />
it when they spend it'. But in Australia we did fix<br />
it. In the<br />
H: Sorry Mr Prime Minister, it is live and we have got to<br />
put the plastic bag on the water, bush bag, we will<br />
take a break, we will be back.<br />
H: And back in Canberra live with the Prime Minister.<br />
PM: What I was saying before we went to our break Derryn,<br />
fringe benefits tax, capital gains, removing credit<br />
cards, free lunches, all those things plug the tax<br />
system. We ' made the direct tax system totally secure.<br />
So now, to build a consumption tax is simply to shift<br />
income around. It is not to repair the tax system.<br />
That's why now we don't need it. And it always had an<br />
inflation risk and the reason I was refused in the<br />
middle ' 80s is we could not guarantee wage reduction,<br />
that is, wage changes to get the inflation rate down<br />
and John Hewson can't get those wage agreements either.<br />
H: Alright, speaking of John Hewson, you don't personally<br />
like him do you?<br />
PM: Well, they're opponents, it is a professional matter.<br />
H: But you can, have professional matter, but you don't<br />
personally like him?<br />
PM: Well, I don't think he stands for much. He is sort of<br />
a boy from the wrong side of the tracks who has sort of:<br />
gone to the other party to look after the wealthy<br />
people : Ln this country. He has given up on his own<br />
people and I don't admire that, you see. I think if<br />
God has given you enough brains to do anything you<br />
should at least represent people that need help.<br />
H: Well, people around here today, some people on both<br />
sides, t~ ell me that you and Hewson are virtually<br />
obsessed with each other?<br />
PM: Oh, no, no, no. Well, he might be with me, I'm not<br />
with hima.<br />
H: Because watching you today, and some of the brawls<br />
earlier this week, it's like two school teachers<br />
brawling, while the school is burning down. </p>
<p>PM: Oh, no, no, no. I mean, last night I produced a<br />
statement of substance that changed the way Australia<br />
is. Look, all those great big things, rebuilding the<br />
railway lines, the ports, the roads, a new airline<br />
system for Australia. This is real reform.<br />
H: Yes, but the road recovery one worries me a bit,<br />
because we had this huge bicentennial roads campaign<br />
all over the country, it didn't stop the recession<br />
hitting us?<br />
PM: But the point I am making is, what we are about here,<br />
always been about here is reforming the place and<br />
making it better. Now the Parliament and theatre of<br />
the Parliament is part of all that. It is part of all<br />
that. People should not mistake the substance for the<br />
shadow. The substance will always be the changes. Bul:<br />
that's not to say that in the theatre of ideas, which<br />
is the Parliament, you won't have a joust about: ideas<br />
and about arguments.<br />
H: So a lot of it is just show-business.<br />
PM: No, no, it's about how you debate things out. It's how<br />
the psychological balance of politics changes. That's<br />
what the House<br />
H: Alright., today's effort, are you going to get a caning<br />
probably from a lot of people, especially royal. ists<br />
tomorrow, about your outburst today about the Brits,<br />
about people getting knighthoods, you really went full<br />
flight on that didn't you?<br />
PM: Well, I hate this sort attitude you still get from John<br />
Hewson and Howard and others, that we should be still<br />
sort of tied up with Britain and that we don't have own<br />
cultural identity and some way we are not as entitled<br />
to be as proud of where we stand independently in the<br />
world wiLthout this sort of connection. I mean this<br />
sort of foggysm held Australia back for generations.<br />
H: I eavesdropped on a couple of politicians in the lift<br />
today, -just after you had said that in full flight, and<br />
they saiLd, ' it is his Irish Catholic background'.<br />
PM: No, no, no. I can't stand that sort of pomp and<br />
nonsense and this idea. Both of them went on so<br />
anxiously on the radio after I addressed the Queen in<br />
here.<br />
H: The respect line got to you didn't it?<br />
PM: No, no, I thought it was said so much about them, that<br />
we should be sort of forelock tuggers, that I couldn't<br />
say to the Queen of Australia, that Australia had made<br />
its way independently in Britain and Europe. What a<br />
shocking thing for me to say. These people are from<br />
the tribe, the team, that gave us all of the Rip Van </p>
<p>Wrinkle years of the ' 50s and most of the ' 60s, and<br />
they are sort of still back at it.<br />
H: Are you a republican?<br />
PM: I think Australia will probably end up a republic at<br />
some point, but certainly not while I am Prime Minister<br />
of Australia.<br />
H: That could be next year?<br />
PM: I don't think it will. I think that as time goes on..<br />
H: No, I mean about you not being Prime Minister?<br />
PM: That's right, that's what I am saying. So this is a<br />
matter which has been, this debate has come on and of f<br />
and it will probably head that way.<br />
H: Would you like to see Australia a republic by the end<br />
of 2001?<br />
PM: I think that's a matter that should run its course in<br />
the public discussion, in public debate.<br />
H: How did you feel when the Fleet Street papers all said,<br />
' Hands off Cobber' and ' Hands orf Cobber' and<br />
PM: Well, you used to run a tabloid, you know what it is<br />
like. But I mean, I must say, the Sydney tabloids were<br />
a cut above those London ones.<br />
H: So is the New York Times compared to...<br />
PM: The New York Times is better, I know.<br />
H: I defended you actually on my program, when you put<br />
your arm around the Queen. It seemed to be just a<br />
guiding gesture.<br />
PM: Well, that's right. Because you see, we were zigzagging<br />
across a corridor, and there were people I knew<br />
that she knew, like Dame Patty Menzies, John Gorton,<br />
Gough Whitlam, I was moving here around to see people<br />
she knew and other people and she is engaged in<br />
conversation and there are people trying to crowd on<br />
her, so you are trying to both be guiding and<br />
protectiLve of her. And I thought it was a very nice<br />
morning for her. She seemed to enjoy herself<br />
immensely. And of course, she is right across all the<br />
issues. She is very well briefed and<br />
H: You were helped a bit by the fact that the Duchess of<br />
Kent was saying similar things in Queensland at the<br />
time.<br />
PM: The Queen is a very gracious, conversationalist and<br />
very we. 11 informed, very well informed. </p>
<p>H: We will take a break.<br />
H: And back live with the Prime Minister. Mr Prime<br />
Minister, Richard Nixon, I'm not comparing you to him,<br />
but Richard Nixon fought and scraped and clawed and<br />
plotted to get himself to the White House, and when he<br />
finally got there, it didn't quite sink in for a little<br />
while that he had made it. Did you have a feeling like<br />
that in the first few weeks of being Prime Minister,<br />
after the way you got the job?<br />
PM: Not really, but just trying to find where all the bits<br />
and pieces were. Where the weights were within the<br />
country, within the Government, how we could sort of<br />
put the two together. It took a while for me to find<br />
my way -around the job.<br />
H: But personally it did take you a while to find your way<br />
and say, I've made it, after all these years, I've made<br />
it.<br />
PM: No, not really. I have been that close to it for so<br />
long. ' rhe scales have long fallen from my eyes about<br />
it. So I didn't really have that, it was about saying,<br />
where is everything, what can we do here now. It was<br />
all that sort of thing.<br />
H: After being in the job for a month, or six weeks of it<br />
when it happened, were you surprised by the manner of<br />
Mr Hawke's departure and the way he did it on<br />
television?<br />
PM: Not really no. I thought there was an even chance Bob<br />
would quit and<br />
H: That way?<br />
PM: Well, it didn't matter. He announced it, then went on<br />
television, that didn't worry me.<br />
H: If you got beaten in the next election, and you<br />
resigned, would you take $ 10,000 from a TV show to<br />
announce it',<br />
PM: Probably not but that is not to reflect on him.<br />
H: Did it offend you?<br />
PM: No, no, I just probably would do it privately.<br />
H: Do you -talk?<br />
PM: Occasionally, we spoke the other day a bit. Yes.<br />
H: Is it friendly? </p>
<p>PM: Oh yes, yes, it is still friendly. Sure.<br />
H: I presume you talked when his wife was ill, something<br />
like that?<br />
PM: We are niot all over each other. But it is friendly, it<br />
is cordial.<br />
H: When YOU made the run, I would broadcast from there<br />
last year, you missed by the numbers. You knew you<br />
were not going to get the numbers that time, didn't<br />
you?<br />
PM: Yes, I dlid.<br />
H: So therefore, it wasn't the one shot you fired, it was<br />
your first shot?<br />
PM: I mean, I did by the end. I wasn't sure a bit earlier.<br />
I thought I'might have, but as they faded away I knew I<br />
wasn't going to win.<br />
H: By the t~ ime you walked into the room, you knew you<br />
wouldn't: win?<br />
PM: Yes, that's true.<br />
H: So it wasn't the one shot you said?<br />
PM: Oh yes it was. In the end, Bob did actually resign his<br />
position and I had not decided to challenge him, so it<br />
might well have been just the one shot, as it turns<br />
out.<br />
H: But you would have stuck around<br />
PM: Not for long. I will tell you this quite honestly, had<br />
Bob taken questions at the beginning of this week, I<br />
would not have stayed to have given the Labor Party or<br />
him any difficulty.<br />
H: Is that right?<br />
PM: Absolute-ly.<br />
H: If he would have stayed on, in this building for<br />
Question Time, you would have quit?<br />
PM: That was the end of me. That's it.<br />
H: Why?<br />
PM: Because I don't think it would have fair to himt or the<br />
Party and probably<br />
H: Would you have taken such a kick-in? </p>
<p>PM: No, no, just to have me around, it wouldn't have been<br />
fair to him. And I think it is probably the same<br />
reason in part he's decided to go, which I understand.<br />
H: So one of you had to go.<br />
PM: I think so. It got to the stage after 8 years, and it<br />
got to the point where either one of us was going to<br />
leave the place. Whoever had it, should have kept it<br />
by that stage, that is February.<br />
H: You said that you would have walked away?<br />
PM: Absolutely, I would have packed my bags and said, ' give<br />
my regards to Broadway', or something like that.<br />
H: That's a good note to go out on. Thanks for your time.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
