    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I met with the Prime Minister of Solomon Islands, the Hon Dr Derek Sikua MP in Canberra.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Sikua's visit is a welcome opportunity for Australia and Solomon Islands to re-establish a close and cooperative relationship.</p>
<p>Dr Sikua last week announced an ambitious agenda of domestic reform for the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>Today we discussed how Australia's development assistance could best reinforce these reforms especially in health, other public services and vocational education. There will be more detailed discussions between our two governments on this.</p>
<p>Dr Sikua invited me to visit the Solomon Islands later this year, which I accepted.</p>
<p>I look to forward strengthening the relationship between our two countries and building a prosperous and secure future for the people of Solomon Islands.  </p>
<p>Australia remains committed to supporting Solomon Islands in its efforts to achieve economic growth and stability. </p>
<p>I welcomed Dr Sikua's statements about the value of the bilateral relationship and the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI).</p>
<p>RAMSI is helping Solomon Islands achieve stability and security, good governance and economic reform and growth.</p>
<p>Australia has contributed some $1.3 billion to RAMSI since 2003. This also involves a substantial deployment of around 170 Australian Federal Police and State and Territory police supported by over 130 Australian Defence Force personnel.</p>
<p>Around 120 Australian civilian advisers are also working in and with the Solomon Islands public service. </p>
