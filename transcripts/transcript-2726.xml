PRIME MINISTER<br />
1972 FEDERAL ELECTION<br />
RESPECT FOR THE LAW<br />
Television Broadcast by the Prime Minister, the Rt.<br />
Hon. William McMahon, CH, MP.<br />
There is no issue which divides the Liberal and Labor<br />
Parties more than the issue of respect for the law.<br />
Our approach is quite clear. We believe that the laws<br />
of Australia as made by Parliament and upheld by the Courts must<br />
be respected and observed by everone. That is basic to the<br />
survival of our democratic society.<br />
I am sure the overwhelming majority of you support this<br />
view. You know as we know, that to reject the authority of the<br />
law is to advocate force as a substitute for lawful authority.<br />
We will never accept this.<br />
Labor leaders on the other hand hold opposite views. Many<br />
of them, including Mr Whitlam, have encouraged breaches of the law.<br />
In Victoria, they have endorsed a self-confessed law-breaker,<br />
Barrie Johnston, as a candidate for the elections. Mr Whitlam<br />
sought to justify his support of Johnston by claiming that<br />
draft-dodging is not a crime: An amazing proposition for one who<br />
seeks to be Prime Minister.<br />
By holding this view, Mr Whitlam is advocating that every<br />
citizen has a right to put his own value on the law; to obey<br />
those laws which suit him and to disobey those which do not; this<br />
is a condition of anarchy.<br />
The Liberal Party's attitude is clear. We will always<br />
defend the right of lawful protest and dissent. It is an essential<br />
element in the democratic process, and it must never be modified.<br />
But we believe there is only one way to change the law. That is<br />
by the will of '. he majority expressed through Parliament.<br />
Labor leaders are quick to react when violence and lawbreaking<br />
touch them. For years the Liberal Party has warned of the<br />
dangerous influence of communists in certain trade unions. We<br />
have condemned their militant tactics and their abuse of union power.<br />
But the response of the Labor Party has been a conspiracy of silence. / 2 </p>
<p>Labor has accused us of kicking the communist can. It<br />
took a physical assault on the respected union leader, John Ducker,<br />
the President of the New South Wales Branch of the Labor Party,<br />
for Labor leaders to admit that union violence might be a problem.<br />
Yet Mr Whitlam uttered not a word of protest when some<br />
building workers hammered down work done by apprentices at a High<br />
School in his own electorate.<br />
So strong is the power of the left wing militants in the<br />
Labor Party that it can silence the Leader of the Opposition,<br />
even when the rights of his own constituents are abused. What<br />
kind of double standard is this?<br />
There is no double standard in our attitude to these issues.<br />
We believe that the law should apply with equal force to everyone,<br />
unlike certain members of the Labor Party.<br />
We utterly reject the proposition that some people,<br />
particularly union militants, should be placed above the law.<br />
That is a dangerous concept and an incitement to anarchy.<br />
We shall always believe in the right of lawful protest and<br />
dissent. But my Government and my Party say that Parliamentary<br />
authority and respect for the law are the basis of our society.<br />
We stand fast by this concept and believe the great<br />
majority of you stand with us.<br />
