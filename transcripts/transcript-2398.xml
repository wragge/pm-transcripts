RAAFJUBILEE MEMORIAL<br />
Statement bPj the Prime Minister, Mr. William McMahon<br />
In Canberra tonight, at the Air Board dinner marking the 50th Anniversary<br />
of the Royal Australian Airforce, the Minister for Air, Senator Drake-Brockman,<br />
announced the winning design for a commemorative sculpture to stand in Anzac<br />
Parade, Canberra. The winning design for this RAAF jubilee Memorial was submitted<br />
by Mrs. Inge King, of Warrandyte, Victoria.<br />
The adjudicators for the comp. atition were<br />
* Sir William Dargie, CBE,<br />
Chairman of Commonwealth Art Advisory Board.<br />
* Mr. R. Boyd,<br />
Architect and Member of the National Capital<br />
Planning Committee.<br />
Mr. C. Last,<br />

Advisory Baord.<br />
Air Marshal Sir Colin Hannah, KBE, CB,<br />
Chief of the Air Staff.<br />
Mr. R. K. H. Johnson,<br />
First Assistant Commissioner, Civic Design and<br />
Architecture, National Capital Development<br />
Commission.<br />
The twenty five foot high, ground stainless steel sculpture which was<br />
up~ pimously selected by the adjudicators, consists of three vertical wing shapes<br />
sorrounding a symbolic flight image, mounted on a platform of polished black granite.<br />
The adjudicators in their report on the sculpture stated that it had<br />
monumental quality, expressed the idea of flight and had appropriate symbolism.<br />
The wing shapes symbolized spiritual and physical growth and the everlasting<br />
pq sibilities of greater achievement, at the same time representing a solemn monument.<br />
The ground stainless steel was deliberately chosen to emphasise lightness,<br />
strength and power.<br />
It is an eye-catching memorial and, in the impressive setting of Anzac<br />
Parade, will be a fitting tribute to the RAAF's first 50 years of distinguished service<br />
to the nation.<br />
