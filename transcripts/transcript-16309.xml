    <content><![CDATA[<p>It is with great sadness that I learned of the passing of Mr Ali Alatas. </p>
<p>Mr Alatas was a great friend of Australia and made an outstanding contribution to the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of meeting him on many occasions over the years.</p>
<p>Mr Alatas was Foreign Minister of Indonesia from 1988 to 1999, and his legacy can be clearly seen in the excellent relationship we enjoy with Indonesia today.</p>
<p>As Foreign Minister, he made a personal commitment to developing Indonesia's relationship with Australia.</p>
<p>He did this on the basis of strong, practical cooperation on issues of importance to both countries.</p>
<p>Mr Alatas contributed both vision and hard work to strengthening the political, economic and personal links between our two countries.</p>
<p>Fittingly in 1995 he was awarded an Honorary Award in the Order of Australia for service to Australia-Indonesia relations.</p>
<p>Mr Alatas also made an enormous contribution to the Asia-Pacific region including the Cambodia peace settlement, during which he co-chaired the Paris Peace Conference, the establishment of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) process and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), for regional security discussions.</p>
<p>He went on to serve with distinction as Indonesia's permanent representative to the United Nations and as an adviser to President Yudhoyono.</p>
<p>As a measure of the great regard in which he was held, Mr Alatas was appointed as a Commissioner on the Government's International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament.</p>
<p>In October I hosted a dinner for the Commissioners at Kirribilli and had the great pleasure of catching up again with Mr Alatas on that occasion.</p>
<p>Today we honour the memory of Mr Alatas and his significant contribution to developing and strengthening relations between our two countries. </p>
