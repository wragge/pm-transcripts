April 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
RADIO INTERVIEW 3AW WITH NEIL MITCHELL<br />
E O E<br />
MITCHELL: With me in the studio is the Prime Minister, Mr Howard. Good morning.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
How are you Neil, great to be back.<br />
MITCHELL:<br />
Thank you very much for coming in. Pauline Hanson, do you believe that she could<br />
have 25% support from the people of Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No I don't. That particular question said, would you consider voting for a Pauline<br />
Hanson candidate? That really is a nonsense question. The only question that really<br />
counts is, will you vote for somebody if an election were held today. So you can<br />
forget about the 25% but you can't forget about, say the 10% in The Bul/ efln poll but<br />
that doesn't surprise me at all. We are living at the moment in a time of tremendous<br />
change and upheaval and people feel uncertain. They feel insecure. They feel their<br />
lives are changing economically and socially. Their relationships are changing under<br />
pressure and when somebody comes along as she has done and offers simplistic<br />
solutions and a few scapegoats thrown in for good measure, it's easy to cream 6 or 8<br />
or 10 points in an opinion poll mid term. This phenomenon has happened all around<br />
the world. It happened on the right of the Republican party in America, it's happened<br />
in France. It happened to a degree in New Zealand, it's happened in a different way<br />
but nonetheless the trend is there in the United Kingdom and in Germany and I believe<br />
that that will disappear, that support will disappear once people realise that she doesn't<br />
have any superior answers but for a while it sounds attractive because you are saying,<br />
look, for example, she says stop foreign investment. The code of that is, if you had no </p>
<p>foreign investment then Australian jobs would be protected because foreigners make<br />
heartless decisions about Australian jobs.<br />
Heavens sake, in the last 24 hours we've had the biggest company in Australia, BHP,<br />
which is Australian owned, take a decision which sadly in a few years time will result<br />
in the loss of several thousand jobs in Newcastle and some hundreds of Jobs in other<br />
parts of Australia. Now that decision was taken for the same reason that a foreign<br />
company running an operation in Australia might take a decision that would result in<br />
the loss of Australian Jobs. So what's the automatic advantage for Australia. Now the<br />
point I'm simply making is it's easy to feed off unhappiness and insecurity in a time of<br />
change but ultimately, when you've got to offer a rational alternative and you can't<br />
offer it, then that support will recede.<br />
MITCHELL:<br />
Do you think they will be any sort of force at the next election? They're talking about<br />
a candidate in every seat. Even 10% ahead of the Democrats.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I remember in 1977 after the Australian Democrats were first launched, they were<br />
attracting in House of Representatives opinion polls, they were attracting 17 and 18%.<br />
I can remember the Joh for PM campaign, remember that?<br />
MITCHELL: Yes. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Got to 25% in one poll and this was voting...<br />
MITCHELL: Mind you, it did the Coalition a lot of damage.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Of course it did the Coalition, well it certainly did the Coalition a lot of damage but the<br />
point I make is that you have now people that look back with embarrassment, with<br />
complete embarrassment, saying for heaven's sake, how did that occur? Now to some<br />
extent it's exploiting that same sort of understandable.. I mean I sympathise with<br />
people who feel uneasy and insecure and some of the figures that she said are, you<br />
know, sort of half understandable in the sense that she expresses a resentment of many<br />
Australians and I have expressed it too, about the fact that for too long and for too<br />
often we're being told we're a bunch of racists and we ought to be ashamed of our<br />
past and that this country has achieved nothing and that it's been a long litany of sort<br />
of racism and sexism and imperial triumphalism, and there has been I believe in the<br />
Australian community a deep seated rejection of the politically correct and distorted </p>
<p>view of Australian history and I have played a major role myself in rejecting that very<br />
negative view of Australian history and to some extent, she's also tapping into that.<br />
But the point I make is..<br />
MITCHELL: something like cannibalism.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Even she was not prepared to defend that so why should I? Why should anybody else,<br />
and if she's not even prepared, I watched her exchange with Kerrie Anne Kennerley on<br />
that. Now if you say something in the political game, you've got to defend it. You<br />
can't walk away from it.<br />
MITCHELL:<br />
Do you think it is racially based though, her philosophy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't think the people who are superficially attracted to her are racist, no I don't. I<br />
think she is, look, she is articulating the fears and concerns and the sense of insecurity<br />
that many Australians feel at a time of change and instability. Now that is an<br />
undeniable fact of life at present and I have to as Prime Minister be honest enough to<br />
acknowledge that we are going through a time of change and readjustment<br />
economically, socially and personally and politically. Now it's easy to sort of finger<br />
the fact that people feel uneasy and unhappy. The next step is to say well, okay you've<br />
fingered the uncertainty. What are you going to do about it? Now I haven't heard<br />
from her. Indeed, I haven't heard from any of the other major players on the political<br />
scene other than the Coalition, any serious long term answers. I mean you can't solve<br />
every problem by having a national referendum on it.<br />
MITCHELL: She's certainly taken, well that's right, that's the other suggestion, national<br />
referendums on every issue. But she's certainly in the polls so far seems to be taking<br />
support from the conservatives. Will it be a factor for you in the election that you have<br />
to consider?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No I don't believe it will because it's, the election is not for another 15 or 18 months<br />
and the Australian public will want to know over the next few months, those people<br />
who have said they might consider voting for her will want to know what are her<br />
answers and you can't forever say, well look, there's something wrong with this and<br />
we're unhappy or insecure but don't ask me for an answer. Now I have the<br />
responsibility as Prime Minister of trying to deal on a day to day basis with these<br />
problems. I don't pretend to have all the answers. I haven't but I do think in the end </p>
<p>people will realise that rhetorical exploitation is one thing. A serious alternative is<br />
another. MITCHELL: I suppose I was just surprised. I see the Queensland Premier on AU~ today saying this<br />
movement could sweep the nation.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't agree with that and I think the Queensland Premier should read Australian<br />
political history. He shouldn't react to polls. I mean, I find this rather curious. Over<br />
the past few months I have watched commentators, not just yourself but others say<br />
that John Howard listens to the pollsters too often and reacts to polls. Now I can tell<br />
you this, I am not going to react to these polls this morning. They're not going to<br />
dictate the way I take decisions and I would counsel all of my colleagues on the<br />
Liberal and National Party side of politics to remember the passing phenomena of<br />
earlier years, to remember the transient appeal of the populist who pretends to<br />
articulate the concerns but has none of the answers. They've come and gone in the<br />
past and I believe that that will be the case with this particular phenomenon.<br />
MITCHELL: Mr Howard, you mentioned BLIP. Is the Government staying clear of it? Is there<br />
nothing the Government can do there?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well everybody has known for a long time including the unions, including the Labor<br />
Party, including the Government, that the long term fuiture of steel making in<br />
Newcastle, for example, was at the very least under a cloud. I have to say that the<br />
announcement yesterday and the decision to make that announcement yesterday was<br />
not communicated to the Government until the night before and I indicated to the<br />
Managing Director of BH-P that I was at the very least disappointed that the company<br />
had not given the Government of this country a few more days notice. Now I did<br />
know, along with all of those other people that there was a problem with long term<br />
steel making but the actual date, the timing of the announcement was not conveyed to<br />
us until the night before which I have got to say, I was somewhat disappointed about.<br />
Look, I don't pretend for a moment and nobody should pretend that governments can<br />
intervene and reverse commercial decisions of that kind. I am concerned, very deeply<br />
concerned about the psychological effect that this could have on the city of Newcastle<br />
and the Hunter Valley and other parts of Australia that would be affected. I will do<br />
everything I can to co-operate with the New South Wales Government and I hope to<br />
talk to the Premier of New South Wales later today. He's been trying to reach me this<br />
morning about joint Commonwealth-State plans for retraining. I would like to visit<br />
Newcastle in the very near future to talk to the civic and union and business leaders in<br />
that city not because I can bring gifts but because I want to demonstrate that I<br />
understand the psychological impact of this and there are some practical things that I </p>
<p>believe the Federal Government can do in the area of retraining and transition. Bear in<br />
mind that steel making in Newcastle won't cease for another couple of years.<br />
MITCHELL: Is it a one off? Is this the end of it? Are we seeing...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
For BHP?<br />
MITCHELL: Well BHP and more broadly. Are we going to see a spate of these sort of decisions<br />
now? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, decisions like this have been going on now for a lot of years. This is not the first<br />
one and this is going back to your earlier question. We are living in an era in which<br />
change of this type is occurring all around the world and it's easy for people who don't<br />
have the responsibilit y of responding to you and you say, look, this is terrible and we<br />
must protest against it. Now you've got to have an alternative. Now what we argue is<br />
that if you can make it more attractive for people to invest in businesses and industries<br />
where they will get a bigger return and can employ more people then you have to take<br />
all the steps you can to bring that about and BHiP will argue that this restructuring will<br />
improve its capacity internationally and will ensure its viability. Now it's hard for<br />
others to question that commercial judgement but equally as Prime Minister I have to<br />
say, the personal impact of this decision on the Hunter Valley, on the people of<br />
Newcastle is significant. I want those people to understand that the Federal<br />
Government knows that and within the bounds of realism we will do what we can to<br />
help. MITCHELL: Speaking of jobs, The Bulletin is reporting today that you are planning to cut 100 000<br />
public servants in three years. Is that right?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's news to me.<br />
MITCHELL: Amalgamating departments?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's news. </p>
<p>MITCHELL: Okay, they're suggesting it may be down to 50 000.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's nonsense.<br />
MITCHELL: Are there any cuts planned"<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We don't have.., amalgamating departments? I don't know where that's come from.<br />
You say, are there any cuts? Well we don't have any targets for a particular size of<br />
public service. We take decisions, some of them which involve redundancies, some<br />
involve out-sourcing. We are making a dramatic change to the job placement activities<br />
of the Commonwealth. We're forming a business enterprise to be owned by the<br />
Commonwealth to compete with private employment agencies to find people jobs, to<br />
replace the CES, a lot of those changes. But as for having some kind of target of " x"<br />
thousand public servants, no.<br />
MITCHELL: Aboriginal leaders, over Wik, are now threatening to organise a boycott of the<br />
Olympics, possible sanctions, trade sanctions. What's your reaction to that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well can I say to those Aboriginal leaders that every time you do that, you do your<br />
own cause immense damage because that sort of talk, that sort of threat is seen as<br />
contrary to the Australian national interest and no Australian, whatever their view on<br />
Wik, wants to see this country hurt, wants to see this country humiliated, wants to see<br />
the farm product of this country denigrated or boycotted and I say to the Aboriginal<br />
people, with the best will in the world, stop talking like that. Every time they open<br />
their mouths and they talk like that they lose further support within mainstream<br />
Australia. Now I say that as somebody who has tried very hard over the last few<br />
weeks in the face of some quite unreasonable criticism from my own side of politics<br />
and I repeat that quite unreasonable criticism.<br />
MITCHELL: that continues. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, to negotiate a fair outcome in an extraordinarily difficult situation and the<br />
Aboriginal leaders do not help themselves. They do themselves a grave and painful<br />
disservice by using language of that kind. It will get them nowhere, it will put them<br />
further behind the eight ball as far as Australian public opinion is concerned because it<br />
is unhelpful to Australia's interest and at the end of the day, that is all that counts.<br />
MITCHELL:<br />
What about your conservative colleagues? Are they on side or is there a backbench<br />
problem as we're told?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I will be talking to the backbench about this tomorrow and I believe that when<br />
the full ramifications of the plan are understood, reasonable men and women will see it<br />
as a fair outcome. It was inevitable after the Wik decision which went far beyond the<br />
expectations of everybody including the Aboriginal leaders, including the Aboriginal<br />
leaders, it was inevitable that we had to come back from Wik. Now it's a question of<br />
how far you came back from Wik. Now I have produced a plan that will give certainty<br />
to pastoralists. It does not involve blanket extinguishment of native title and I repeat<br />
to all of those farmers who may be listening to this programme and who wonder<br />
whether they won't be able to carry on their pastoral and farming activities of a normal<br />
kind without having to deal with the native title claimant, the answer is no, you won't<br />
have to deal with that claimant because under our proposal you will be able to carry on<br />
all of the expanded primary production and agricultural activities as contemplated<br />
under the definition in the tax act, and that is as wide as you can get, without having to<br />
deal with native title claimants.<br />
MITCHELL: The Deputy Prime Minister seemed to be saying in the press today that the states<br />
would get involved in effectively...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The states have always been involved...<br />
MITCHELL: Yes but effectively extinguishing native title over pastoral leases by turning them<br />
freehold. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No what Tim was saying, and it's right, is that our plan has always allowed for<br />
compulsory acquisition of native title in the same way that your title or my title can be </p>
<p>compulsorily acquired by a state government at the present time and providing proper<br />
compensation is paid. That's quite different from blanket extinguishment. It's a block<br />
by block, case by case consideration.<br />
MITCHELL: Mr Howard, you had a more than hour long meeting with Kerry Packer. What did he<br />
want? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well he wants the cross media laws changed and he's never been shy. Media barons<br />
are never shy when you talk to them. He has an uncomplicated view.<br />
MITCHELL:<br />
He wants Fairfax?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think he's said that publicly. He would like to, he would like to buy Fairfax and at<br />
the moment you've got a situation where the law says he can't because he owns<br />
Channel Nine and we're considering whether that law should be changed. We have a<br />
situation in Australia of course where 70 80% of the newspapers of this country are<br />
owned by foreign interests. I know Mr Murdoch's company has very deep roots in<br />
Australia, as does his family and I acknowledge that but the fact remains is that Mr<br />
Murdoch is no longer a citizen of Australia and therefore under the laws of Australia<br />
his company is classified as foreign. Anybody else could buy Fairfax at the present<br />
time who is not a foreigner and who doesn't own a television station but one of the<br />
interesting things about this debate is that I haven't seen anybody else come along. I<br />
mean, people periodically say to me, wouldn't it be good if such and such a company<br />
or such and such an arrangement could be reached whereby somebody else bought<br />
Fairfax. Well it's been possible for somebody else to buy Fairfax providing an<br />
agreement could be reached on the price. For years and the present law right at the<br />
moment allows people to buy Fairfax. I mean, I have people occasionally in the city of<br />
Melbourne saying to me, wouldn't it be a good thing if the Melbourne consortium<br />
could buy the Melbourne Age or something from...<br />
MITCHELL: Sounds like Jeff Kennett.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
From.., well, it wasn't Jeff Kennett, from Fairfax. Well the answer is, if Fairfax now is<br />
willing to sell it, that can happen but of course it hasn't. </p>
<p>MITCHELL: Is it desirable though to have, I suppose then you would have most of the media<br />
owned PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, you've got to make a choice. There's really three options. You can leave it as<br />
it is which is inherently unstable and the Fairfax share register is very unstable and you<br />
really don't have anybody running the company or alternatively, not in an identifiable<br />
way, I mean, that's not meant to be critical of the management but the fact is it's a<br />
pretty unstable situation. You can open it up completely and that is take off all of the<br />
restrictions, cross media and foreign and that could result in all of the media in<br />
Australia owned by foreign interests. I'm not saying it would but it could or<br />
alternatively you can relax the cross media rules which means that foreigners can't buy<br />
more but it would allow Mr Stokes or Mr Packer or anybody else in the future who<br />
also has television interests to buy the paper.<br />
Now there are arguments for and against. It doesn't all come down on the side of so<br />
called diversity. When you're talking about diversity, I mean, who is more influential?<br />
A columnist in the Melbourne Age or Neil Mitchell, a columnist in the Sydney<br />
Mor-ning Her-ald or John Laws, a columnist in the Courlir Mail or Ray Martin? This<br />
idea that family proprietorship is the sole embodiment of media domination is an<br />
outdated notion in Australia and it predates the influence of talkback radio, it really<br />
does. I think you blokes have a lot more influence and I think the journalists have a lot<br />
more influence than the press barons. I think since the mid 1970s the influence of<br />
press barons on the treatment of political news in Australia has been greatly<br />
exaggerated. MITCHELL:<br />
Was Kerry Packer persuasive?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, more or less than in the past. Can I just, on that point can I say that I have been<br />
critical of the cross media prohibitions dating back to 1987 and in 1987 Mr Packer said<br />
that he was going to vote Labor and I'm sure he did. Well I mean he said he did so,<br />
and he was very publicly associated with Bob Hawke. I don't regard Mr Packer as<br />
being somebody who has always associated himself with my side of politics nor would<br />
I imagine it in the future that he would necessarily always or whatever, associate<br />
himself with my side of politics. that's not the issue.<br />
MITCHELL: I think there's reason to suspect that previous media policies had been based on<br />
mateship and deals and political.. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I haven't made any deals and, I mean, look, if we end up changing the laws which<br />
enable Mr Packer to make a bid for John Fairfax, that will not be as a result of any deal<br />
and I simply point to the fact that at a time when Kerry Packer was saying he was<br />
going to support the Labor Party I was critical of the cross media prohibitions.<br />
MITCHELL:<br />
Mr Howard, when is Mal Colston going to be sorted out? That is irritating.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it is but I don't have the power to expel him from the Parliament and can I say, I<br />
don't think I should and I think it would be quite wrong if the Government party<br />
having the numbers could expel somebody. If we started doing that in the House of<br />
Representatives we would get into trouble. Now we have said that he ought to stand<br />
down as Deputy President. Whether he remains a Member of Parliament ought to be<br />
determined by the law. Like Carmen Lawrence, he is entitled to a presumption of<br />
innocence and it's very important, even when there's an avalanche of criticism, it Is<br />
very important that that principle be upheld. Now it's being investigated by the police.<br />
I have done what Kim Beazley and Gareth Evans 13 years ago didn't do and that is<br />
have this matter sent off to the Federal Police. Evans as Attorney General was advised<br />
by the head of his own Department to send this matter to the Federal Police and he<br />
negotiated a payback of the money and did not send it to the Federal Police yet he is<br />
now, along with his leader, who is also part of that exercise, they are both now<br />
criticising my handling of the matter.<br />
Now I have sent it to the police. I have said he should stand down as Deputy<br />
President. The Coalition's numbers would be there when the Senate resumes for him<br />
to be voted out of that position. I have said I won't accept his vote any more. I<br />
cannot do any more without violating some important principles of our legal system,<br />
namely the presumption of innocence.<br />
MITCHELL: Have you asked him to go?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Personally? I publicly said he should stand down as Deputy President. ( inaudible) I<br />
mean, I did it three weeks ago with the recantation by his former, or his current<br />
secretary, Mrs Smith, and her earlier statement.<br />
MITCHELL: But in allowing for that presumption of innocence he'd probably be better off out of<br />
the Senate, wouldn't he? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I tell you what, he wouldn't take the slightest bit of notice. I mean anybody who,<br />
I mean I don't think you understand that. I mean, I can't snap my fingers and say go.<br />
You know that. Kim Beazley knows that. The Australian public knows that. What I<br />
can do is all of the things I've enumerated and there's nothing more I can do. The<br />
processes of the law must take its course. It is obvious to me that if Mal Colston had<br />
not defected from the Labor Party, the Labor Party would not be pursuing, they're not<br />
pursuing this thing out of a sensitivity for the proprieties of the Senate. They're<br />
pursuing this because he reneged on the Labor Party. Now I understand that but let's<br />
not try and clothe their behaviour in some kind of high minded demonstration of<br />
supreme political principle.<br />
MITCHELL: Mr Howard, I know you need to get away. Just quickly, I toured the new casino<br />
complex this week and broadcast from down there. I know you are unable to attend<br />
the opening next week. You've got another commitment.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm attending a dinner in Sydney which is forming a branch of the Asia Society, the<br />
very prestigious Asia Society in Australia.<br />
MITCHELL: Do you still have concerns about what we describe here as the casino culture and what<br />
it would do to...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I haven't altered the view I expressed on your programme and I've expressed on<br />
other occasions, that the level of gambling has reached saturation point in this country.<br />
I'm not worried about people who can afford to gamble. We were probably talking<br />
about one of them a few minutes ago. I'm not worried about those people. They can<br />
afford to do it. I do worry about people who can't afford to do it. I worry about the<br />
impact of excessive gambling on small business and I can't honestly say other than<br />
that. I am not a wowser. If people want to gamble and they can afford to do so, well<br />
that's their business. That's not for me to say they shouldn't do it and I'm not saying<br />
that casinos should be made illegal but I am saying that we have reached that sort of<br />
saturation point in this country and that's a view that's quite widely shared in the<br />
community and you've got to try and strike a balance and if you don't say that, you're<br />
being dishonest but on the other hand you run the risk that people are going to say..<br />
MITCHELL: Are we in danger, there's a balance here with the size of what we're doing, do you<br />
believe? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't, I spend a lot of time in Melbourne and I don't want to personalise it and<br />
make it specific to one particular enterprise. It's one of those situation where you do<br />
have to try and strike a balance and walk a very difficult path between, on the one<br />
hand, expressing a concern you have but on the other hand not sort of embracing a<br />
prescriptive approach to behaviour. Now Governments normally shouldn't try and<br />
regulate personal conduct. I don't think they should try and do it at all. We face that<br />
difficult choice in relation to what I loosely call X rated videos. Now I find that sort of<br />
material distasteful.<br />
MITCHELL: Have you ever seen one.)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I have some, briefly, yes and I find it very, very distasteful but at the end of the day<br />
you've got to say to yourself, unless there is overwhelming evidence that watching<br />
those videos produces very anti social behaviour. You can't really tell adults what<br />
they should see and hear and read. I mean it's a, I don't think I've got a right to do<br />
that or you haven't got a right to do that. Nobody has and we are supposed to live in<br />
a democracy and they're the sort of difficult balances that you have to strike. Now if<br />
you've got overwhelming evidence that watching something like that produced very<br />
violent, very anti social conduct then that's another matter. Now it's a question of<br />
striking a balance and we think the balance had to stop short of the absolute<br />
prescription of those things. Whatever I might personally think of them and you're<br />
doing it in a sense with the same sorts of issues when you're dealing with something<br />
like Canberra. I mean, one school of thought says you just say nothing about it and<br />
you let it rip and you never say anything. Another school of thought is that you have<br />
to be very, very prescriptive and start telling people what to do. Now I'm not, I don't<br />
belong to that latter school. I don't think I have some kind of moral right to tell people<br />
how they should behave and I won't even try.<br />
MITCHELL: Of course if you have a look at our state budget today we're very much based on<br />
gambling. I suppose it would have to be.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we are, and people will legitimately argue that if those who can afford to gamble<br />
are going to gamble, why shouldn't they make a contribution to the rest of the<br />
community and that does have a point and I don't disagree with that but it's a question<br />
of how far you go, and without wanting to attack any particular business, I remain<br />
uncomfortably of the view that we have reached a, sort of a saturation point and I<br />
hope it doesn't go any higher. Now that will bring down on my head the criticism of<br />
some but I think a lot of people will agree with it. it's my view and I owe the<br />
Australian people at all times a candid expression of my view and that's it. </p>
<p>MITCHELL: Lloyd Williams suggested double the figures on the temporary casino when the new<br />
one opens. Extraordinary.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I've stated my view and I hope it is understood but it remains very much an area that<br />
concerns me.<br />
MITCHELL:<br />
Thank you very much for your time and thank you very much for coming to<br />
Melbourne for the launch later today of the Alannah and Madeline Foundation. We've<br />
had Walter Mikac and I know you've dealt with him...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I have, yes.<br />
MITCHELL: . since Port Arthur. He's an extraordinary man, achieving a great deal.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes he is an extraordinary man and he does personify the courage of all of those<br />
people and it's a great concept, the foundation. It's all about caring for the victims,<br />
particularly the children of violence and crime. I said the other day that I thought<br />
however aspirational it might be that the greatest memorial of the people who died at<br />
Port Arthur could be a resolve by the Australian community to put aside violence as a<br />
solution to dispute and a solution to problems, whether it's in the home or on the<br />
sporting field or in the pub, in the school yard, even in the radio studio I've<br />
occasionally seen a few, not in the civilised climes of 3AW I might say, but I think it is<br />
a fitting way, I think it's a tremendous foundation and I know 3AW has played a major<br />
role in sponsoring it and supporting it, It's greatly to the credit of the station and to<br />
you personally.<br />
MITCHELL: Thank you very much for your involvement and we will see you later in the day as it's<br />
officially launched. Thank you for your time.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Thank you. </p>
