April 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
SPEECH AT THE LAUNCH OF THE ALANNAH AND<br />
MADELINE FOUNDATION, MELBOURNE<br />
EE Thank you very much Neil, to you Walter, to Tim and Alicia O'Shane, to Jenny<br />
Mackin who is here today as the Shadow Minister in the Federal Parliament<br />
representing the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley. Can I say that the words that<br />
I will speak today I know have the endorsement of all three parties in Australia. This<br />
is not a party-political occasion and might I say that whatever was possible to have<br />
been done to make Australia a safer society after the events of the 28th April last year<br />
would not have been possible without the support of the Australian Labor Party and<br />
the Australian Democrats, as well as, of course, the Party that I have the privilege of<br />
leading.<br />
This is not only an important occasion and an inspiring occasion but it can also in a<br />
sense be a very happy occasion because it is an opportunity for us to express again the<br />
tremendous awe that we feel for the capacity of young children in our community to<br />
survive terrible tragedies and to rebuild their lives with the help of the people who love<br />
them most and we, of course, honour the establishment of a Foundation which<br />
remembers the tragic death of Alannah and Madeline and all the other people who lost<br />
their lives on that terrible afternoon.<br />
But in doing so we also celebrate the miracle of the survival of children and the central<br />
hope that they offer to the rest of us and I think Neil is right, that so often when<br />
tragedy hits a family, where there is a loss of a parent or a sibling or whether it's a<br />
dreadful accident or whatever the circumstances are, we sometimes, because of their<br />
inability to express their feelings, we sometimes fail to realise the traumatic impact that<br />
such events can have on children. And the Foundation that we honour today and the<br />
Foundation that we launch today will make a very practical contribution towards doing<br />
that. There are many ways in which a community, a society, can remember the victims<br />
of a tragedy. </p>
<p>I said the other day on the 28th, on Monday, and I'd like to repeat it to you this<br />
afternoon, I said that in many respects the greatest memorial we could as a nation<br />
create to the victims of the 28th of April last year was a renewed determination within<br />
our society to do all we could to eradicate different forms of violence in our midst<br />
whether it's violence in a public place or whether it's violence in a family or whether<br />
it's violence on the playing fields, whether it's violence in a pub or violence in any<br />
other social gathering. Too often the first instinct of too many people in our<br />
community is to solve an argument or to solve a dispute through resort to violence<br />
whether the use of physical violence or verbal violence. And I can't think of a more<br />
fitting memorial than a greater recognition by all Australians that violence is not an<br />
answer to any difference of opinion, particularly violence against the more vulnerable<br />
people in our community, including women and children.<br />
So I am really quite touched to be here today along with, I guess, the other 18 million<br />
Australians I admire tremendously, Walter, the great courage and the inspiration that<br />
you have represented to people in life circumstances. It's hard to say to put it that way<br />
but it's difficult for us who haven't been touched by such sadness and such loss to<br />
really take on board the enormity of it and the grace, the strength and the inspiration<br />
that you have shown and demonstrated is a tremendous example. It's a humbling<br />
example of the, I suppose the survival of the human spirit and I remember once talking<br />
to one of my colleagues who had lost his wife and two children in very sad<br />
circumstances and I said to him, how was it that you were able to survive, and he said,<br />
I survived because I knew that if I didn't keep going that that really was the end of it<br />
all. And I thought it was a tremendously eloquent yet simple way of expressing the<br />
human force that is inside somebody who is overtaken and overcome by such an<br />
enormous tragedy, and I can only say on behalf of all of your fellow Australians, we<br />
admire immensely and we are inspired greatly by people who demonstrate courage in<br />
such great personal adversity and it affects so many people. Many we don't know<br />
about, many we do know about and, of course, when it touches so directly as it did in<br />
the case of Tjandamarra O'Shane a little boy set upon in a most despicable and<br />
beastly circumstances, it does reach out and affect all of us and the spontaneous<br />
response of so many people to what happened to Ijandamarra and it is really<br />
something very encouraging about Australia.<br />
We're very fond sometimes of saying how poor we are and how mean we are and how<br />
we can never get too many things right and we get so many things wrong. I think the<br />
public response to what happened to Tjandamarra and just the outpouring of people<br />
who wanted to be part of saying: gee, can we help?, we are so upset about what<br />
happened, what can we do to make that little boy's life a little easier and a little<br />
happier? I think that's one of the sort of shining examples of the essential decency of<br />
Australians, the essential magnanimity of the Australian spirit that I have seen for a<br />
very, very long time.<br />
I am delighted Neil, to be the patron of the Alannah and Madeline Foundation. I am<br />
very happy to complement 3AW. I think many good things come out of the<br />
boardrooms at 3AW and I wouldn't be nearly as self-effacing as that. I want to<br />
congratulate the station for its public spirited support for this Foundation. I want to<br />
wish it well and most of all I want to complement the simple aspiration of the<br />
Foundation and that is to recognise the need for love and compassion and support of </p>
<p>children in particular who are the victims of crime and who are the victims of violence<br />
in our community. It is, of course, a pipedream, whoever imagined it, whatever our<br />
resolve and however well intentioned we are as a community that we can ever rid<br />
ourselves of violence and beastly behaviour but it's not a pipedream to imagine that we<br />
can from time to time in a community get together and make some contribution, not<br />
only monetary but also in terms of our time and our thoughts and our prayers and our<br />
understandings of the people who are the victims of that violence and today is a little<br />
example of that.<br />
You are the inspiration behind the former. Neil and his colleagues at 3AW have been<br />
the driving force. Tjandamarra symbolises the very predicament but also the hope and<br />
the inspiration, the hope and the encouragement of the young that the Foundation is<br />
designed to help and designed to encourage and I am so delighted to play a very small<br />
role in being patron of the Foundation, to convey the good wishes of all of my Federal<br />
Parliamentary colleagues from both sides of Parliament to the Foundation, and wish it<br />
well and to say on behalf of all Australians, there is nothing that quite touches our<br />
hearts more than the struggle and the optimism and the laughter and the outpouring of<br />
affection of a little child who suffered, but survived, and looks with hope in facing the<br />
future. Thank you. </p>
