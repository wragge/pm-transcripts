4,, U L,<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS NATIONAL PRESS CLUB 27 JUNE 1983<br />
PETER BOWERS: Mr Hawke, I wish to ask you about the decision<br />
taken by Mr Bowen to commit the two existing uranium miners to<br />
renew negotiations for new export contracts. The day before you<br />
left Australia sir, you said that that ministerial decision was<br />
in conformity with party policy on uranium. Will you now say<br />
which part of that extraordinarily complex new' policy permits the<br />
negotiation of new uranium contracts?<br />
PM: I will say in regard to that question Peter, that the<br />
decision to which you refer and the whole question of the<br />
application of the policy of the Australian Labor Party in regard<br />
to the mining and export of uranium will be considered in the<br />
near future within the councils of the Australian Labor Party,<br />
both at the Parliamentary and the organisational levels, and it<br />
is not appropriate in my understanding of the fact that that is<br />
going to take place and it is a discussion in which I will play a<br />
prominent part, that I go any further than that.<br />
TED KNEZ: Prime Minister, in an interview with Radio Australia<br />
last Tuesday, your Foreign Minister, Mr Hayden described<br />
Australia as having a certain innocence of view about regional<br />
and world affairs not unlike America up until the late 1930' s.<br />
He expressed confidence however that like the United States,<br />
Australia will mature quite rapidly. But at present is that<br />
innocence of view, which Mr Hayden spoke of, apparent in your<br />
party's stated policies on uranium, nuclear testing, Vietnam aid<br />
and East Timor? </p>
<p>2<br />
PM: No, I don't believe that it. reflects innocence. I indicated<br />
* in the speech that I made that I have a long association with a<br />
knowledge of this great Australian Labor Party. And one of the<br />
things that you will understand about this great party if you<br />
sudy it, is that it has been a party which has concerned itself<br />
with issues in the social and economic, political and<br />
international area in a way in which reflects passions and<br />
prejudices if you like, of a wide range of people. We are not<br />
some uniform monolithic party and in the processes of arriving at<br />
decisions there is a need, -there always has been and I suppose<br />
there is always likely to be in the future a need to accommodate<br />
differing emphases and differing points of view. And that tends<br />
to mean at times if you want to put it, there is no point in<br />
* running away from it, it tends to mean at times that there's a<br />
lack of specificity, or if you want to put it another way,<br />
there's a range of options which are put, which are there to<br />
accommodate that indisputable fact about the social democratic<br />
parties,, such as ours. I believe that there is sufficient<br />
goodwill and understanding within our great party and within the<br />
various emphases if you like, factions if you want to be more<br />
specific there is sufficient goodwill, ensure that in the days,<br />
the months and the many years ahead that there will be an<br />
appropriate relationship between statements of broad policy and<br />
the application and the timing of application of those policies.<br />
I am not fussed or phased by the publicity and the emphasis which<br />
has been given to this matter over recent times. I am quite<br />
confident and your question is particularly related to the<br />
foreign policy area, or more particularly to that area I am<br />
quite confident that there will be an appropriate relationship<br />
between the broad objectives of policy to which I alluded during<br />
my address. There will be an appropriate relationship between<br />
* those broad purposes of policy and the application of those<br />
policies by this Government. May I finally make the observation<br />
that I have had no closer working relationship with any minister,<br />
* than I have had with my Foreign Minister, Bill Hayden. And I<br />
believe that we are at one in our views about how the policies of<br />
the party will be applied in the terms that I have just put.<br />
JOHN SHORT: Prime Minister, given your statements today on the<br />
need to hold the 1983-84 Budget deficit at $ 8.5 billion how do<br />
you react to calls from some of your ministers, Labor Premiers,<br />
and Caucus members, for the Commonwealth to follow an even more<br />
expansionary economic policy next year and secondly given the<br />
costly proposals your spending Ministers want included in the<br />
August Budget, and calls from the Premiers for more Commonwealth<br />
funds at the Premiers conference this week how can you hold next<br />
year's deficit at your target figure without increasing income<br />
taxes? </p>
<p>3<br />
PM: Let me make two points which I think are relevant. Firstly,<br />
I think you will notice if you listened very closely to the words<br />
I used, and you can check them in the speech that I did not say,<br />
because if really after all I've got to leave something to the<br />
23rd August I did not say that our deficit will be $ 8.5 billion<br />
for 1983-84. I suggest you look at the text. But in saying that<br />
I don't want to in any sense suggest that that ball park is not<br />
the one I have in mind. The second point I make in response to<br />
your question, how do I respond to these observations by some of<br />
the people you've suggested. I respond with the degree of acute<br />
interest, that a Prime Minister should have in these expressions<br />
of points of view. I listen to them, I take note of them, I try<br />
as often as is possible to discern what is the line of<br />
intellectual reasoning if there is one attached to it so, that I<br />
can deal with the thought processes and the thinking. But I then<br />
at the end of the process say to myself, well I think I<br />
understand, economic arithmetic and I believe that we have to<br />
relate our objectives in the longer term to that arithmetic. I<br />
just want to conclude on that point, by saying as I said during<br />
my address that the essential thing in politics, I've always<br />
believed it and I reassert it now, that the essehtial thing is to<br />
get your time scale right. It is an absurdity in the extreme,<br />
particularly I suggest for a Labor Government in a country which<br />
has historically tended to be somewhat conservative, it is a<br />
mistake in the extreme, for a Labor Government to believe that<br />
it's going to be able to achieve in 12 months the objectives that<br />
are intrinsic in its election commitments and in its policy. And<br />
I repeat, I unequivocally said to the people of Australia in<br />
respect of the major issue of employment and unemployment, that<br />
we will arrest the explosion in unemployment, that during the<br />
term of our Government we will start to turn back the levels of<br />
unemployment and we will create half a million jobs. Now that<br />
was the commitment, it was a three year commitment and I am<br />
totally convinced that if we continue on track as we are, we will<br />
achieve what we promised. </p>
<p>TONY O'LEARY, Sydney Sun<br />
Q: Prime Minister, I wanted to ask you about superannuation.<br />
gince the Public Service, through advice from the<br />
Government, has had a crack at our superannuation and our<br />
lump sums, I wondered when the Government would be having<br />
a look at their scheme, which is widely regarded as highly<br />
generous and also I wanted to ask you whether you think<br />
it is appropriate for retired public servants to get a<br />
pension increase in line with the CPI on Saturday while the<br />
rest of us are all supposed to be enduring what is called<br />
a wages pause.<br />
PM: Well there is a thread running through there of let's<br />
drop the Public Service, and let me say, and I'll come to<br />
the specifics of your question, that I repudiate this<br />
concept which seems to be pretty widely spread in our<br />
community of let's bag our favourite target, the public<br />
service. I said two or three years ago in an address I<br />
gave to the International Public Service Association<br />
Conference in Singapore that its really about time<br />
we became a bit mature as a society and understood that<br />
if we are going to as a society achieve the sort of purposes<br />
that are necessary for our society to meet increasingly<br />
complex and difficult times, we ought to recognise that<br />
an efficient and dedicated public service is an indispensible<br />
instrument in the achievement of those purposes. I add<br />
to that, that doesn't mean that we just simply give public<br />
servants what they want, but I want to put on record my<br />
repudiation of this favourite game of * let's bag public<br />
servants. Having said that, I make the next point. I don't<br />
shed any tears in respect of what we did in regard to<br />
superannuation, and if you're talking about what's happened<br />
there I simply say this, that if in fact as a society you<br />
want this government to put itself in a responsible position<br />
where its able to undertake expansionary programs, as we<br />
did in regard to community employment and as we did in regard<br />
to public housing, as we did in regard to private housing,<br />
then the money, the capacity, has to come from somewhere.<br />
And in fact in respect of what we did in regard to pensions,<br />
in what we did in regard to superannuation, we started a move<br />
to make sure that those with the greatest capacity should<br />
make a greater contribution. In regard to the specifics of the<br />
Commonwealth Public Service superannuation schemes I haven't<br />
addressed my mind to it. I am more than relaxed if someone<br />
wants to put up some submission to me about it.<br />
V* Cl, I </p>
<p>MICHELLE GRATTAN, The Age<br />
Q: If Mr. Hayden's mission to Hanoi produces no progress,<br />
will the Government then consider resuming aid to Vietnam<br />
and, if so, when?<br />
PM: That question, if I may say so, Michelle, is based upon,<br />
I will put it as gently as I can, a less than adequate<br />
understanding of how foreign policy operates. If you<br />
believe that in matters as intricate and complex as the<br />
future of Indo-China that a decision, a definitive position,<br />
is going to arise at the end of one visit by Mr. Hayden<br />
at this point to Bangkok to engage in a dialogue with ASEAN<br />
Ministers and then his visit to Vietnam and Laos, then I<br />
simply have to say to you that that isn't the case. You<br />
can't say that consideration of these highly complex issues<br />
is going to be determined by that one visit. Mr. Hayden<br />
certainly doesn't-believe it and I don't believe it and I'm<br />
not going to say anything here or in the next few days<br />
which in any way can compromise the capacity of Bill Hayden<br />
to undertake the important mission on which he is engaged.<br />
It would be absolutely improper and counter-productive to<br />
his capacity to achieve anything in that difficult task if I<br />
were to answer that hypothetical question at this point in<br />
time, and I don.' t intend to.<br />
JOHN LOMBARD, Radio Australia<br />
Q: A couple of quick clarifications. Did President Mitterrand<br />
give you a firm date for the end of the French underground<br />
nuclear testing program in the Pacific? Did the New Zealand<br />
Prime Minister, Mr. Muldoon, give you the date he said he had<br />
been given by President Mitterrand and a more general question,<br />
in the light of the situation that's been repeated in East Timor and<br />
the fact that there is a reported ceasefire between the<br />
Fretilin and Indonesian Forces, do you believe that the Labor<br />
Party resolution of last July has any relevance or validity<br />
today? PM: The answer to your first question is no. The answer to<br />
your second question is yes and if I could add an observation<br />
in regard to what I think it necessary to say is because I'm<br />
put in a competitive bidding position then aren't I. I had a<br />
very useful discussion with President Mitterrand and I tend to<br />
think that his conversation with me'more accurately reflects what I<br />
understand to be the French position. I know that that is not<br />
going to precipitate war between Australia and New Zealand<br />
but, as always, truth must out. Now, in regard to the third<br />
question I believe that what has, as I said in my address, John, now<br />
publicly emerged for the first time is an obviously relevant<br />
consideration. I think you will appreciate that I am not in a<br />
position publicly to display the extent of my understanding of<br />
what is going on, but I have been not unaware of it for some<br />
time and I would think that, or let me put it this way for the<br />
purposes of exposition only, and it is not to be inferred </p>
<p>from what I say that I believe this is the immediate<br />
liklihood. For the purposes of discussion, let me put it<br />
this way if in fact there were to be a freely negotiated<br />
position in East Timor where the Fretilin Forces and the<br />
Indonesian authorities came to what was regarded by both<br />
sides as a workable and into the future arrangement, which<br />
was accepted by both sides, within the framework of East<br />
Timor remaining part of Indonesia, then, of course, that<br />
is relevant and an imperative consideration to be taken<br />
into account, not merely by the Australian Labor Party, but<br />
by anyone concerned with this issue.<br />
GAY DAVIDSON, Canberra Times<br />
Q: If I can bring you right back to Australia and mention<br />
Moore v. Doyle.<br />
PLM: Let's bring us right back. I know everyone is throbbing<br />
t o hear about Moore v. Doyle.<br />
DAVIDSON: In your Boyer lecture you described as there being<br />
different registration requirements under State and Federal<br />
industrial legislation and it meant that Federal<br />
unions must recognise the existence of three separate and<br />
distinct bodies, thats the Federal Union, the State branch and<br />
also the State registered union and you pointed out yourself<br />
that this-was a futile and alm~ ost endless ' source of conflict created<br />
for warring factions you referred to it as. an artificial situation.<br />
Now, Mr. Whitlam certainly attempted to do something about<br />
this. Mr. Cameron did. I believe that Mr. Wran did earlier<br />
in his Premiership. What do you intend doing and how and what<br />
priority will you-give it?<br />
PM: It has a high priority. I understand that work is being<br />
done within the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations<br />
under the Ministership of Ralph Willis on this issue I must<br />
say, Gay, I haven't received any recent report on it, but I<br />
understand that they are not merely working on it themselves,<br />
but that discussions are going on with the States, but I just<br />
simply haven't got any up to date information on that. Let me<br />
say this, I mean I go beyond the immediate answer to that<br />
question. I take the view, as I did at the time you mentioned<br />
as I had expressed before then, that one of the most fertile<br />
and annoying sources of industrial disputation arises because of the<br />
split jurisdiction-in this-field of industrial relations. In'<br />
no area of our experience has it been more evident than in the<br />
oil industry where the people particularly of N. S. W.<br />
periodically have been vastly inconvenienced by the attempt to<br />
play one jurisdiction off against the other and I think that<br />
the interests of Australia would, in fact, be served if the<br />
will of Neville Wran and of myself could be reached where the<br />
States could see that it was in their interests and the<br />
interests of their people to have in respect, and I'm not taking<br />
it beyond this, but in the area of industrial relations if we<br />
could have a situation where that possibility was eliminated.<br />

<p>CHRIS PETERS, New Zealand Press Association<br />
Q: Mr. Muldoon told this Club last week that the relationship<br />
between New Zealand and Australia had matured as the two<br />
nations grew away from Britain and established their own<br />
identities. With the different migration patterns both countries<br />
have altered their characteristics and therefore their values<br />
and outlooks on the world in-general and to each other in<br />
particular. In your address you gave emphasis on Australia's<br />
foreign policy more towards the North to Asia. Is there still<br />
a place in Australia's foreign policy for the ANZAC spirit?<br />
HOw do you believe the spirit has changed. In what ways is it<br />
relevant to the positions the two nations find themselves in and<br />
the directions they are going and how do you see this bond<br />
operating in the future?<br />
PM: Well, let me say that at the dinner which Mr. Muldoon hosted<br />
on Friday night I indicated that I believed that there was a<br />
bipartisan view in Australia that the strengthening of relations<br />
between Australia and New Zealand was inevitable and was in the<br />
best interests of the people of both countries and I attribute<br />
them as I am more than happy to do now to the work of the previous<br />
Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Anthony, and the work that he did in<br />
fashioning that agreement and it was a matter of ease for our<br />
government within a matter of days to confirm our intention to<br />
operate that agreement and in large part that was easy because<br />
Mr. Anthony had ensured in the processes of those discussions<br />
that the Trade Union Movement of Australia and the organised<br />
business community had the opportunity of being fully involved<br />
in the processes and we knew therefore that there was a widespread<br />
acceptance of what was involved in the CER agreement. Now, I simply<br />
repeat here, therefore, what I said then that I think those sorts<br />
of developments are inevitable. The only hiccups that can occur<br />
is if there is a tendency across the Tasman by the Prime Minister<br />
for perceived domestic political purposes to bag my Treasurer and<br />
he is getting on very dangerous ground if he does that.<br />
BARRIE CASSIDY, ABC News<br />
Q: Prime Minister, do you think Kim Hughes should have taken up<br />
your offer to play for Australia?<br />
PM: You couldn't have done bloody, worse, could you.<br />
STEWART SIMPSON, Business Review Weekly<br />
Q: In your speech today you noted on page 16 that our private<br />
investment next year is expected to represent only about 13.4% of<br />
GDP and you said that's more than 1 percentage point below the<br />
average of the last decade. In the light of this do you believe<br />
business has the capacity to pay a 3-4% wage increase in 1983<br />
without being at a cost to employment either existing or future?<br />
PM: Thanks Stewart, that I think is a simply important question.<br />
If you were living in a world of academics or disinterested public<br />
servants there is obviously a case that you could argue that it<br />
may be, according to certain assumptions, more, likely-that you<br />
7 * 1 71, </p>
<p>8.<br />
would get an increase in private investment if there were no<br />
increase in wages before the end of this year. Now, I stress,<br />
A though, so I'm not misrepresented, that I'm saying that its<br />
possible to argue that in some dessicated ideal, theoretical<br />
world. I believe that, of course, there are two things that<br />
you have to say about that. It's not quite as simple as saying<br />
in a situation like that that an increase in wages would<br />
represent an increase in cost to business and therefore that's<br />
the end of the discussion. You know that I've always said<br />
that when you are talking about wages you have to understand<br />
that they are both a cost and an income and that's got to<br />
remain a relevant part of your thinking. The second, and perhaps<br />
if you like more immediately relevant consideration is this,<br />
that we live in a world where, particularly in Australia, the<br />
concept of using your strength and your power to get what you<br />
: 1 chaans bteoe na dvfaonsctee reydo, u r poawrnt icpuelracrelivye db y ionutre repsotlsi tiics als oompeptohnienngt sw, hich<br />
its not to be regarded as surprising therefore that the trade<br />
union movement should have embraced that concept of using<br />
whatever power they have got to advance their perceived interests.<br />
Now, the great future of the period since 5 March and one of the<br />
great achievements of this government is that in a short period<br />
we have started to get both sides of industry to understand that<br />
its not the end of the road and it doesn't represent the<br />
exhaustion of your responsibility to stop the exercise at that<br />
point. In other words, following the Summit, I believe that<br />
business understood that it makes sense they don't say, look, if<br />
there is a 4% -increase in wages that adds to our costs, we'll<br />
get to the bottom line and say, well, we'd be better of f if there<br />
wasn't 4% and the other side of the coin I think that the trade<br />
unions have essentially understood that they don't exhaust their<br />
responsibility if they say look, we've lost 9.2% over this<br />
particular period and what we ought to have is that 9.2% plus<br />
2.2% for the March quarter 83 plus whatever the percentage is for<br />
the June quarter. They are not saying that. They are<br />
recognising that If they went-too far in their wage claims that<br />
could have a counter-productive effect, so I think that on the<br />
balance the business community are saying alright, we would<br />
probably prefer a no increase situation, but we, as responsible<br />
managers, have got to look down the track and that's what we've<br />
all got to do because the strength of the Prices and Incomes Accord<br />
and particularly the wages part of it is this, that if you left it<br />
just to the Adam Smith invisible hand concept that has been so<br />
embraced by people who haven't advanced in some 200 odd years if<br />
you left it to that at the present time, the way the invisible<br />
hand would work would be that there* would probably be-an increase on<br />
average of less than 3-4% in the economic circumstances confronting<br />
us now, but what you have got to look at is that you've got to get<br />
into place now in 1983 an operative and understood and accepted<br />
wages policy which is going to then operate in the expansionary<br />
phase of 1984 and beyond. And even looking at it from the point of<br />
view of the self interest of businessmen I think they overwhelmingly<br />
understand this, that if you get a modest increase in<br />
1983 in the latter part of 83 and accepted, as I believe it<br />
would be, by the ACTU, then their interests are going to be<br />
served as you go into expansion and as a negotiating capacity<br />
would increase in lots of areas of the economy, if the trade<br />
union movement have accepted restraint -as they would see it in<br />
1983 the interests of business are going to be served and the<br />
capacity for recovery are going to be increased in that expansionary<br />
period. </p>
<p>MAX WALSH, The Nine Network<br />
Q: One of the major events of your first hundred days in<br />
office was the rejection by the Senate of tax legislation<br />
involving a collection of some $ 350 million a year. Your<br />
Finance Minister, Mr. Dawkins, has suggested that not<br />
unequivocably that the Government won't re-introduce this in<br />
the August session. It has also been suggested that the<br />
legislation was drawn up hastily and there was some validity<br />
in the criticism levelled by the opposition of Senator<br />
Harradine against this. Could you tell us if the legislation<br />
will be re-introduced in the Budget session or do you accept<br />
that the cost benefit involved in this political cost<br />
benefit is not on and the legislation is no longer to use<br />
one of your expressions realistic or relevant?<br />
PM: No, I can't tell you that because no decision has been<br />
made. It is a matter still to be discussed. When it is I can't<br />
guarantee I will tell you either directly or on the Sunday<br />
program, but it will be announced.<br />
ANNE SUMMERS, Financial Review<br />
PM: The best questioner of them all.<br />
Q: A rather daunting framework with which to have to start. I'd<br />
like to return to the theme raised by Stewart Simpson and the<br />
level of wage increase which you and the Treasurer have argued<br />
would be desirable this year. How confident are you that the<br />
Arbitration Commission will see it your way given that the Union<br />
movement will be arguing for full catch-up and the employers<br />
will be arguing for none and how important is the achieving that 3-4%<br />
wage increase has beenfor maintaining a moderate balance of forces<br />
on-the ACTU executive as currently prevails.<br />
PM: Anne, let me say, first of all, obviously I don't know what<br />
the Arbitration Commission will do and nor will I attempt to<br />
find out. My hunch is, I suppose, having had some experience in<br />
the area, my hunch might be worth a bit more than others I<br />
tend to think that the Arbitration Commission and I say this in<br />
terms of having a knowledge of the way they have operated in<br />
the past and the judgement of things that I have said I tend to<br />
think that they would come out at about the sort of figure we<br />
are talking about. Now, we will certainly be arguing that, as I<br />
have said in the Parliament, that an increase of the order of<br />
3-4% is what is appropriate and any more than that would be<br />
damaging. Now, let me pick up another point in your question<br />
you talk about the ACTU's claim, but you will have noticed you<br />
will have noticed that there have been public statements by the<br />
ACTU and I think they are to be applauded for it, that in<br />
respect of parts of their claim which they put in the 9.2%<br />
that is not being pressed with any sense of immediate relevance.<br />
It's something which they say is appropriate to go on the<br />
back-burner and to be looked at in times of obvious economic<br />
recovery. Now, I applaud them for that and I say I believe that </p>
<p>the employers and the trade union movement would be able to<br />
live with the sort of increase that I and the government<br />
have talked about. I will complete my answer by saying in<br />
respect of that part of your question how important I regard<br />
this. I regard this as fundamentally important.<br />
ROB CHALMERS, Inside Canberra Newsletter<br />
Q: I would like to ask you a question about the Economic<br />
Planning Advisory Council which, of course, is of higher<br />
importance, and you emphasise this, than the Summit. You<br />
are taking the Chair of the Council yourself,-Sir, so it<br />
obviously is of higher importance. There has been some<br />
criticism in the business community that of the 17 members<br />
of the Council, only 4 of those representatives. will be<br />
the private enterprise section. I am including here the<br />
farmers. How would you answer that criticism that 4 out of<br />
17 is not great representation for the people that really<br />
have to enlarge the cake?<br />
PM: Let me just start off the answer by addressing myself to<br />
the last part of your question. That was purely Fraserian<br />
in its position that its only the businessmen who are involved<br />
enlarging the cake. Marvellous assumption. Then I really<br />
believe that workers have something to do with enlarging the<br />
cake. I know it's an heretical thoughE in some circles, but I<br />
do happen to believe it. I also happen to believe governments<br />
are also, by their decisions, going to determine in part what<br />
happens to the size and the quality of the cake. The<br />
substantive point is this that in terms of the composition of<br />
the Economic Planning Advisory Council it represents the outcome,<br />
not only of the discussions of the Summit, but detailed discussion<br />
with the trade unions and business organisations following the<br />
Summit and it represents an agreed position. Now, that means,<br />
obviously, that when you are talking about a thing as diverse as<br />
the business community, those purporting to speak for the<br />
business community say, well look, everyone will share our view,<br />
but the representativesto whom we spoke are satisfied with that<br />
size and composition of EPAC.<br />
BRIAN HILL, The Australian<br />
Q: My question is in two parts. Firsly, bearing in mind what<br />
you said earlier about the deficit and the Premier's Conference,<br />
are you going to tell us what specific arguments the Labor<br />
Premiers made to you yesterday at your meeting in Melbourne<br />
and what your response was and also, given the size of the<br />
projected United States deficit and our own deficit, is it still<br />
appropriate for senior government authorities, for example, the<br />
State Electricity Commissions, to be able to borrow outside the<br />
Loans Council?<br />
a IINZV,. 71 1. 1. </p>
<p>PM: In respect of the first question, hope certainly springs<br />
eternal, doesn't it. The answer obviously is yes, I could, but I won't<br />
Secondly-, in regard to the borrowing by the Electricity<br />
Authority outside the Loans Council operations, I think you<br />
will appreciate again, Brian, as that is going to be a matter<br />
discussed on Thursday and Friday, I really can't give you an<br />
answer on that, but let me make this broad point that I think<br />
that what we have seen in respect of the Electricityj Authorities<br />
generally speaking is that they have peaked in their<br />
borrowing. We would expect that that broadly would be the<br />
position. If, what we were looking at was a situation where you<br />
would expect another 132% increase in the borrowing program<br />
which we have just witnessed, then, that would create a<br />
different context.<br />
MIKE STEKETEE, Sydney Morning Herald<br />
Q: Mr. Hawke, I wonder if I could seek clarification of one<br />
aspect of your speech. When you have said there can be no<br />
foundation for sound relations between Papua New Guinea and<br />
Indonesia unless there are sound relations between Australia and<br />
Indonesia, were you suggesting that if you had taken a tougher<br />
stand on Timor then perhaps there could have been some<br />
implications for the security of Papua New Guinea?<br />
PM: No.<br />
HARRIS, Wellington journalist ( NZ)<br />
Q: In many curbside interviews last week, Prime Minister<br />
Muldoon indicated that there had been indeed a summit between<br />
the two trans Tasman leaders.<br />
PM4: T~ ere had been?<br />
Q: There had indeed been a leaders summit between the two<br />
trans-Tasman leaders and Mr. Muldoon took as many opportunities<br />
as he could to tell Australians and New Zealanders what went<br />
on in those meetings. Could you, Prime Minister, given an<br />
indication as to why you don't hold similar interviews and<br />
tell the nation the contents of those types of meetings?<br />
PM: Well, you're tempting me, aren't you? Well, let me as<br />
genially as I can, in the face of such diabolical provocation,<br />
observe with equanimity that Mr. Muldoon used the opportunity<br />
of the Parliament, his Parliament, because we wouldn't give<br />
him an opportunity in ours, the opportunity in his Parliament<br />
the other day of having a shot at the Hawke Labor Government<br />
and saying to the people of New Zealand that they shouldn't<br />
go for David Lange and the Labor Party there because they<br />
might do what we have done here and I think in these things it<br />
doesn't make much sense to reciprocate publicly. I have not<br />
left him unaware of what I think of this process of engaging<br />
for purposes of domestic political advantage in that sort of<br />
exercise. I take the view, as you may recall from what I said<br />
in the election campaign when questions were asked like this,<br />
I have certainly adhered to it absolutely since I have been in,<br />
s'<br />
I -i 17 1-11, </p>
<p>12.<br />
that it seems to me that once a people has elected a government<br />
and its leadership then you conduct your relationships with<br />
that leader whoever he or she may be on the basis that they<br />
are the representatives. I don't think you use discussions<br />
between leaders and particularly private discussions I don't<br />
think that the interests of your people are advanced if you<br />
use those private discussions for the purposes of partisan<br />
advantage. That's my strong feeling and I intend not to<br />
depart from that principle. </p>
