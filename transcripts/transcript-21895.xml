    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that Tasmania will receive more than $685,000 for additional work on the Longford Levee under the Australian Government's Regional Flood Mitigation Programme.</p>
<p>The funding will be matched by the Tasmanian Government and will be used to develop a levee system designed for a 100-year flood event.</p>
<p>This funding recognises the substantial benefits derived from effective flood protection works and measures.</p>
<p>The Longford Levee has already received $500,000 in funding under the Regional Flood Mitigation Programme since 2001. The 2005-06 contribution brings the total Australian Government commitment to the Longford Levee to $1,185,679.</p>
<p>Once completed, the Longford Levee system will help significantly reduce future property damage and losses and minimise the disruption to businesses and employment.</p>
<p>As we have seen in recent days, the impact of flooding on communities in Tasmania can be devastating and the social and economic hardships associated with flooding are felt in communities long after the initial clean-up has been completed.</p>
<p>The Australian Government introduced the Regional Flood Mitigation Programme to specifically target regional areas vulnerable to flooding.  The commitment by all three tiers of government to the Regional Flood Mitigation Programme represents a sound investment in the protection of the Australian public.</p>
<p>Flooding in Australia has an estimated annual cost of more than $370 million, quite apart from the distress to families and communities.</p>
<p>This money will go a long way towards protecting more lives, homes, businesses and essential services.</p>
<p>The Regional Flood Mitigation Programme assists State and Territory Governments and local agencies to implement priority, cost-effective flood mitigation measures.  The Programme is delivered through partnerships between all levels of government, with the Australian Government contributing up to one third of approved project costs and State and Territory Governments and local agencies meeting the balance.  </p>
