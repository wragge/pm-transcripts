FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 15 JULY 1982<br />
MR CAIN AND NUCLEAR SHIPS<br />
Mr Cain has renewed his opposition to the visits of nuclear<br />
armed or nuclear powered ships to Victorian ports. He<br />
admits that in doing this he is at odds with the decision of<br />
the recent ALP federal. conference. His renewed opposition<br />
to visits to Victoria by American naval ships needs to be<br />
seen against the background of the Victorian's ALP conference's<br />
decision for " The State Government to oppose within the<br />
l~ imits of its powers the entry of nuclear vessels into<br />
Victorian waters." Who can doubt that in opposing these<br />
visits Mr Cain is bowing to pressure from the Socialist Left<br />
forces within the Victorian ALP to get rid of ANZUS.<br />
In persisting with his opposition, Mr Cain is contradicting<br />
his own statement of 16 June that " It has never been<br />
Victoria's intention to intrude into the Federal Government's<br />
responsibilities for defence and foreign affairs." Mr Cain<br />
must now give an assurance that he will act upon these words<br />
and provide the appropriate services and facilities for<br />
the visit by USS Goidsborough and for other visits by<br />
American naval ships. The Commonwealth would expect<br />
Mr Cain to give instructions to the authorities of the<br />
Port of Melbcu4_ rne and other Victorian ports to co-operate<br />
with any such.-visits.<br />
There have been more than 500 visits to Australian ports<br />
by ships of the American, British and French navies over<br />
the past 10 -years. At the 31st ANZUS Council Meeting in<br />
Canberra on 22 June, Australia, New Zealand and the United<br />
States reconfirmed the importance of access by United States<br />
naval ships-to the ports of its treaty partners as a critical<br />
factor in sustaining the United States deterrent capacity<br />
and its ability to meet its responsibilities to its treat~ y<br />
partners and the Western Alliance. It is vital for such<br />
visits to continue without impediment and difficulties being<br />
placed in their way. </p>
