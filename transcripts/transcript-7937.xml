PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 2 MARCH 1990<br />
I have sent the following message to Prime Minister<br />
O Andreotti of Italy:<br />
Mr Dear Prime Minister<br />
On behalf of the Government and people of Australia may<br />
I say that the news of former President Pertini's death<br />
was received here with much sorrow.<br />
Dr Alessandro Pertini was one of the great<br />
humanitarians of our time and brought to his Presidency<br />
and long career as a democrat, politician and<br />
statesman, qualities which earned him the respect and<br />
admiration of the international community.<br />
He will be especially missed by his many fellow<br />
Italians who have settled in Australia. Sandro Pertini<br />
would have been proud of their outstanding contribution<br />
to the development of this country, because in so many<br />
ways they draw inspiration from the values for which he<br />
* fought and stood so firmly.<br />
BOB HAWKE </p>
