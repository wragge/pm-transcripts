F PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRE2SS 21 FEBRUARY 1977<br />
ADDRElSS AT THlE MELBOURNE~ STATE COLLEGE<br />
It is a pleasurO to have this opportunity to participate i'Llf<br />
vour oriecntation week at Melbourne State College. No doubt<br />
a large part of your time this weak will be sDent in orienting<br />
yourselves to the college cnvironmntto one another,, the<br />
coffee lounge, and the local pubs.<br />
This is also a time in whiCh you will bts beginning to orient<br />
yourselves more deeply towards politics. The tcrtiary education<br />
period i~ s charactcris tically the time in uhich students become<br />
more politically active and aware.<br />
Exposed to new facts and idaas, students become more sensitive<br />
to iflju5t ce and inequities and desire to change things, to<br />
reconstruct and create something. better, This is as it should be.<br />
There ar-e n * any things in our society that fequire reform, and<br />
sometimes radical change. Thegreat question facing -us as<br />
Australians is how these -reforms can be brought about. Today<br />
there ayre two different answers to this question. Two<br />
different approaches to the issue of -what sort of change is<br />
necessary and how it can bc achieved.<br />
These derivv from the Liberal and socialist streams of thought.<br />
I~ n Australa, broadly spea) ing, these streams are represented<br />
by the Liberal and the Labor Parties.<br />
Both of t-hese approaches to politics and society address theimselves<br />
-some common problems and to the problems of human needs, to<br />
material political and social inequ, lities. These approaches<br />
however differ as to how to best achieve a better society.<br />
The choice of approaclh is of the most basic importance the<br />
alternatives lead along increasingly divergent paths of<br />
differen~ t socieItes. At the core of socialist philospphy is the<br />
belief that the state should intervene in as many areas of social<br />
life a~ s possible. In this view the truth is seen as being inf<br />
the hane-' s of a few select individuals. Individuals who claim<br />
a special insight and believe they are entitled to irpose their<br />
\ iwon the peo-ple. They know what is best the people do not. </p>
<p>The -result of this belief is a major empiasis on state controlt,-<br />
ie ; ITtempt to create a cei-Ltralised politi.' cal authority that<br />
prog-ressively restrict individiuals choice and fcem. Ta<br />
creates larger and larg~ er bureau racies which. strive to regulate<br />
and control all aspects of social and political life.<br />
Some justify this concentration of power by claiming that it is<br />
necessary if the position of the disadvantaged is to be improved.<br />
Once we look at the results of socialism in practice, wie see that<br />
socialism all too often creates social and economic change which<br />
defeats the objectives socialism claims to pursue.<br />
Sociali sm translated into practice all too often not onily fails<br />
to improve the position of the disadvantaged, hut undermines -it.<br />
This I believe is the lesson that the three years of the Labor<br />
Government can teach us.<br />
As the Henderson Poverty report poinited, out, the inflation that<br />
Labor brought undermined the position of the disadvantaged:<br />
" In 1974-75" 1 the -peport says," it seems that. -inflation created<br />
poverty through unemployment but rapid inflation bas<br />
contributea to -P,' Overty in many other ways.. the basic<br />
* ieaonfor this is simple inflatioyi favours -the active and<br />
-iowerful: the position of poor people deteriorates"<br />
Theuinemployment that inflation caused ) iarmed the weaker sections<br />
t'hle ' coimmunity rost of all. The-re was a ihSii ivV gowth in the<br />
bureZiu cracy, and there was aii increase in the privileges of some<br />
vested interest groups.<br />
Powerful unions benefittedl from the Labor years wealker wor1~ ersthe<br />
less s)% illea, migrants, the. young had to pay by suffering<br />
umne p1oymien t.<br />
In the three years of LaborGovernMent Socialist Philosophy ! ihowed,<br />
itt could not not achieve the noble ideals some of its adherents<br />
believe in. ThNe nature of its failure have exacerbated som. e of<br />
the m~ ajor problems of Austral-an society. The problems of<br />
bureaucratic power, the problems of matc-riallv assistir"' g thea<br />
disadvantaged' which increasing their independenc and. ñ ree. OM<br />
from the states, the problem of protccting the individual. I<br />
Thil Liberal approach indentifiCs these problems as the r-i<br />
on , es fac-ing our society and provies the means of resrd% 1xing them-. ~' r<br />
essurtce of che lberal apprToach is that the goal_,; of Government<br />
ac-tion shotild be enhitirg the freedom of every-ndividual to<br />
achieve atcording to his personal ga ñ Idabilities.<br />
Liberalsim stands I-or xna) Fimumn rcedoin of choice fori-givi1ng the<br />
people the opportunity to purusc their own goals in their Ownl<br />
ways. It stands for freedom from anxiety and want fo r the<br />
provision of effective assistance to disadvantaged grcoups in our<br />
commnunity. Liberalism means diversit, tolerance aild respect<br />
for the Yiews of othe-rs the freedom to be differanz il to </p>
<p>Conform. Liberals recogniscd that -no g9roup of men can have a monopoly<br />
of wvisdom and that consequently power should be widely distributed<br />
in o-ur society.<br />
Sincec this Goverrnent has been in office, we have set about<br />
tranislatingethese commitments into practice. In the social<br />
wdlfare area. we have taken major steps to improve the -position of<br />
the disadvantaged members of our society and provide them with<br />
greater scope for choice in how to use tho assistance to best<br />
benefit themselves. * Just providing assistance in itself . is not<br />
enough. The form of ' assistance should be such that it<br />
inhcroases the independence of the disadvantaged from the agencies<br />
providing assistance.<br />
There can be no more significant teM. of a social welfare<br />
programme than whether it can answer affirmatively to questio<br />
does it improve the material position of the person reciieving<br />
the assistance? Does it improve his range of options and his<br />
capacity to deal with a complex society.? Does it improve his<br />
independence as a person or does it increase his dependence on<br />
wThat: the state wishes to provide?<br />
Our approach to social welfare is exemplified by the introduction<br />
of I-lie farily allowance scheme. The old system of tax deductions<br />
for children benefitted wealthy groups most of all and did not<br />
sufficiently benefit poor people. We abolished these<br />
tax deductions and institudd a-family allowance scheme which paid<br />
mone,. y directly to the mother. This substantially imrproved the<br />
pos: Ltion of over 300,000 poorer families who benefitted only<br />
paritially or not at all, from.: the previous system. And it<br />
did not add to bureaucratic overh cads, to bureacratic, power.<br />
Thepractice of Liberalism can also be seen in two experimental<br />
programmes. One concerns migrant resources centres, t; 1le other<br />
wel: Eare housing. In the area of ethnic affdirs, we arc<br />
participating in an experiment with two different types of migrant<br />
resources centres to see which is the more effective.<br />
In Melbourne the Government is contracting out the provision<br />
of s; ervices to an ethnic welfare group the Australitm Greek<br />
Welfare Society -which is-in close touch with the needs of migra<br />
1I-:' 3ydncy,, a reso -urce centre is being cstablished in which office<br />
ofComxnonwealth and State Dlepartments, ethnic voluntary groups<br />
and ethnic communities will all participate.<br />
Bothl centres use the resources and expertise which are available<br />
the I-ommunity's voluntary organisations.<br />
Because these organisations are in close touch with the community<br />
and because they are more informal and less highly st-ructured<br />
than is the public service, they can often deal with indiviaual<br />
problems-with greater sensitivity,. and effectiveness -than<br />
Government bureacracies.<br />
' Yhis Government intends to strengthen voluntary organisations<br />
even inorci n the future. In the area of housing for the disadvant,<br />
work has begun on a housing vol1cher scheme which pays a housing </p>
<p>It is the icecipient who decides how to use thc subsidy to meet<br />
his liousing needs not the bureaucracy. If the experiment,<br />
proves practical, it could well rcvolutionise the area of<br />
welfare housing. Both these schemes give power and choice to<br />
people thiey seek to provide effective assistance to those most.<br />
~ need and enhance the autoniony of the recipieh ts.<br />
It is very easy to provide a service that leaves no option for<br />
choice. OL. LT approach is to provide assistan~ ce where needed in<br />
a way that leaves room for choice and that incrcascs the di~-nitv<br />
and self-respect of the recipient.<br />
Our approach is in sharp contrast with the main thrust of<br />
Labor's approach of making people dependent on a service the<br />
Governmnent supplies where the recipient's only choice is to<br />
take it or leave it. The Government has also taken measures to<br />
iriprove the: biteaucracy's capacity to deal more sensitively and<br />
effectively with its clients. A number of changes have for example<br />
been mad e in the administration of the Department of Social<br />
L Security tco improve the Department's capacity to assist its<br />
clients.<br />
At a time when the power of Government and. private bureaucracies<br />
is threatening to intrude upon human 3ndviduals rights, this<br />
Cr. vernrment haus taken steps to protect individual rights.<br />
In the last. twelve months, the Ct~ wionwealth Attorney-General has<br />
embarked on a progranme of law reform designed to protect individtu<br />
and human -rights which is more extensive than any since<br />
Federation.<br />
The Administrative Appeals Tribunal has been established.<br />
The Ombudsman' Act has passed through Parliament and the first<br />
Om~ budsmian will be appointed soon.<br />
Bills will be introduced this Session to: establish a Humnan<br />
Rights Comm~ rission to promote human.. rights and ensure compliance<br />
of our law with the UN international Covenant on Civil and Politica&amp;<br />
Rights; promote freedom of information; implement the report<br />
of the Law Reform Commnission on Criminal Investigation an<br />
important advance in civil liberties for persons detai~ led for<br />
questioning, or arrested and charged with a Federal ciiminal<br />
offence.<br />
A number of' references have been made to the LaiqRcfo= f Commission<br />
incaIding references concerned the protection of privacy, the<br />
reform of laws on defamation, an investigation of the possibility<br />
_ of applying Aboriginal customary law in criminal matters to<br />
Aborigines living in the traditional mnanner.<br />
Reforms madec by the Government in other areas reflect the a~ uie<br />
approach. Aboriginal Land Rights Legislation for the Northern<br />
Territory has been passed. An improved bomne savings grant scheme<br />
for people buying theirfirst home as been introduced. Ned , al<br />
and hospita; l insurance has been reformed so that each citiz eyi<br />
can choose his orm level of insurance and insurer. Fraser Island<br />
has been protected, and those adversely affectdd by that decision<br />
have been compensated. An Industraial ' Relations Bureau will be<br />
establisheed to protect the rights of individual unionists and<br />
of the conuninity iI </p>
<p>We e increasing the p-rovision of day Care facilities<br />
to give tht7 children of jqorking mothers adequlate cUre.<br />
A-number of other Major rcfoTrjns have also been made which will<br />
render governments1mre rcsponsivc to their citizens. Tax<br />
indexat ion iS one of these. In the past Government~ s could<br />
be assured of significant yearly increases in taxation. reveiues<br />
because of inflation. The result was that they did ' not. have to*<br />
justify thitir programmes to the people; Tax indexation<br />
will prevent this occurring in the future.<br />
From-now on if Governments wantt to begin new programmes they<br />
will have to either discontinue old ones or raise taxes.<br />
In either case, the people of Australia will be in a better<br />
position to pass judgement on the actions of Governments and our<br />
democracy will be enhanced. Ouir Federalism reforms simnilarl~ y<br />
increase Governments' accountability to their citizems.<br />
Under these ' reformis state and local governments have been given<br />
acckess to a guaranteed proportion of income tax re'~ enues<br />
and a far greater degree of autonomy in how they will be used.<br />
Citizems will now be able to much more effcctively evaluate<br />
Governmerit's performance than when it was claimed financial<br />
resources did not go with constitutional responsibilit~ y.<br />
These reforms are only the beinrrning of our programnme to increase<br />
the power, freedom and opportunity of all Australians.<br />
But it should be realised that along with freedom and power goes<br />
a-considerable . esponsibility. In the case of tertiary<br />
studentS, this responsibility is oneof considerable magnitude-<br />
Te-rtiary students are given an opportunity because of there<br />
academic competence to engage in an extended period of<br />
reflection and learning. And the opportunity to gain<br />
qual ificat ions enhancing their career prospects and future<br />
financial rewards. These opportunities-, the financial -sifLCws of<br />
tertiary iflstituions, are provided by teh whole of the Australian<br />
population, not least by blue collar workers.<br />
one of the prime obligations which flows from this is to mnake<br />
a meaningful and constructive contribution to the process of<br />
intellectual debate in our society'. To rationally test<br />
alternative perspectives and. debate them. ' This indeed is one<br />
of the traditional responsibilitics of tertiary institutions<br />
to he the guardians of acadeic freedom.<br />
Therole of the tertiary instittuiofl as a critic of society has<br />
bbon supported for hundreds of years becauise people have rega-rded<br />
them as places where a aiversity of opinions can be held.<br />
Wht: re-people can speak freely and -openly. Mid where<br />
cal~ m and rational debate can bc conduct. d. </p>
<p>6.<br />
Unfortunately it is a fact that in recent times, academic<br />
freedom has been threatened.<br />
It is sometimes easier to mnale a speech on the Melbourne<br />
waterfront, before members of the Waterside Worlers<br />
Federation~ than it is to got a hearing on somne tertiary campuses.*<br />
The plain fact is that members of a union with. one of<br />
Australia's most radical traditional are more ready to listen<br />
to Lirgument and debate, than a minority of students who) believe<br />
that they have the right to suppress views different from their OW(<br />
If the views of this tiny mninority of students prevails then the<br />
academic freedom of tertia-ry institutions will have been<br />
undermined by their own members, and -much of the sympathy which<br />
thb wider community has for universities anid colleges winl<br />
be forfeited.<br />
. If Australia is to progress, if more effective reforms are<br />
to tbe made, then we must have a constant process of free<br />
an! d open, debate. Bringing about beneficial social chiange<br />
requires analysis and criticism. It requires the capacity to<br />
conceive of a better society and so th ' e hard slogging 1-4ork<br />
ncessary to realise it. It requires a fusion of idealism and<br />
-realism. I believe that the vast -majority of Australia's stuaexit.<br />
will want to participate in the vas, of reformiing our society.<br />
There is much work to be done. </p>
