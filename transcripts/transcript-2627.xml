WOO 0L<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, The Rt Hon. William McMahon, CHMP.<br />
The Government has agreed on the creation of a single wool<br />
marketing authority to be known as the Aus-tralian Wool Marketing<br />
Corporation, which will operate on a commercial basis.<br />
The functions of the Corporation will cover those currently<br />
specified in the Wool Industry Act and the Woo. Commission Act.<br />
The Government has also decided that the Corporation should<br />
have power to recommend to the Government from time to time chanqes<br />
which it considers to be necessary to control the marketing of thq<br />
whole clip. Before granting a pcwer of acquisition the Government would<br />
require a submission or submissions for consideration relating to a<br />
comprehensive acquisition scheme which is acceptable to the wool<br />
industry, the State Governments and -the Commonwealth.<br />
In any proposal submitted to the Government for acqulition,<br />
the Corporation would be required to submit * proposals substantially<br />
in accordance with the following financial safeguards<br />
A statutory requirement that the Corporation conduct its<br />
operations on a striCtly commercial basis.<br />
A statutory requirement that the deductions from sales<br />
proceeds made in arriving at net payments to growers<br />
shall be sufficient to meet all trading costs ( interest,<br />
( storage, handling, administration etc.), and to provide<br />
for the accumulation of reserve~ s ag~ ainst the contingency<br />
of losses being incurred. </p>
<p>A statutory provision that on the commencement of an<br />
acquisition scheme the existing Commonwealth commitment to<br />
meet * losses not covered by earlier surpluses shall not<br />
apply for the future elimination of Section 25( 5) ( b)<br />
of the Australian Wool Commission Act 1970).<br />
The amount, method and timing of payment which may be<br />
recommended by the Corporation to the Government for<br />
approval shall be subject to and above.<br />
A statutory requirement that the Corporation's policy<br />
on holding stocks of wool ( and hence its pricing policy)<br />
shall be determined in consultation with the Government.<br />
Mf The Corporation may with tha approval of the Government<br />
abolish the PAP scheme and recommend another scheme.<br />
It is the desire of the Government to ensure the retention<br />
in the marketing system of efficient commercial innovators where<br />
consistent with the overall objectives of efficient marketing.<br />
The Government has decided that for the year 1972/ 73 only<br />
the deficiency payments shall be the same as for the present season<br />
1971/ 72. The question of underwriting the industry by way of direct<br />
subsidy or otherwise has been dealt with as an issue separate and<br />
distinct from both market reform and acquisition.<br />
