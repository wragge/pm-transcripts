PRESS STATEMENT NO. 275<br />
June 1974<br />
BRITISH NUCLEAR WEAPONS TEST<br />
The Australian Government has repeatedly made<br />
clear its opposition to nuclear weapons testing by any<br />
country in any environment. In particular the Government<br />
has given its strong support to resolutions in the<br />
United Nations directed against nuclear weapons testing<br />
which is known to have been conducted systematically over<br />
the years by the United States and the Soviet Union. Very<br />
recently it has protested against French and Chinese nuclear<br />
weapons tests in the atmosphere. It has expressed its<br />
concern to the Indian Government about its recent<br />
underground test.<br />
The platform of the Australian Labor Party<br />
expressly opposses the development, proliferation, possession<br />
and use of nuclear weapons.<br />
The Australian Government is disappointed to<br />
learn therefore that the British Government has conducted<br />
a nuclear weapons test underground in the United States,<br />
after a long interval of nine years. This has occurred at<br />
a time when other recent developments have justifiably<br />
increased apprehension in the international community about<br />
the nuclear arms race.<br />
The Australian Government earnestly hopes that the<br />
forthcoming Summit talks between the Soviet Union and the<br />
United States will make real progress towards the ultimate<br />
objective of a complete ban on all nuclear weapons testing.<br />
