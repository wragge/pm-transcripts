Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced the 60 best and brightest university students from Australia and Asia to receive a Prime Minister's Australia Asia Award.  </p>
<p>The Prime Minister's Australia Asia Awards provide 40 scholarships annually to Australian university students, 20 at undergraduate level and 20 at postgraduate level. 20 scholarships are also awarded to the top international Endeavour Postgraduate Award scholars from Asia each year.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard congratulated the recipients of the Awards, saying they are offered to the best scholars, researchers and emerging leaders from Australia and participating economies in the Asia region, and recognise that the Award holders are the leaders of the future.</p>
<p>Australian recipients in the 2012 round represent institutions from six states and territories, undertaking study or research in a diverse range of fields including creative arts, biomedical engineering, psychology and marketing.</p>
<p>These high-achieving students have the opportunity to immerse themselves in the academic and social cultures of other countries by undertaking international study and work experience.</p>
<p>In 2012 Award holders can study in any of the following countries and regions to broaden their professional and personal horizons:</p>
<p> * 	India<br />
 * 	Indonesia<br />
 * 	Japan<br />
 * 	Malaysia<br />
 * 	The People's Republic of China (including Hong Kong and Macau SARs)<br />
 * 	Singapore<br />
 * 	Republic of Korea<br />
 * 	Taiwan<br />
 * 	Thailand<br />
 * 	Vietnam</p>
<p>The Prime Minister's Awards build deep and enduring education and professional links between Australia and Asia. They also provide an opportunity for Australian universities and the Australian Government to work in partnership to identify and reward high calibre scholars.</p>
<p>Recipients of the Awards can combine their study or research with an internship or work placement, developing internationally-aware, skilled future leaders who can compete and collaborate in a globalised market.</p>
<p>International education is Australia's third largest export industry and these Awards strengthen Australia's international education sector and enhance Australia's reputation as a quality education provider.</p>
<p>Australian recipients of the 2012 Prime Minister's Australia Asia Awards will be recognised at a Presentation Dinner at Parliament House on 7 December 2011.</p>
