FOR PRESS 24 NOVE~ MBER 1977<br />
A33DRPSS AT LUNCHEON IN BRISBANE<br />
It is great to be in an State where there is a determiration to<br />
grow, and deveop. t-b' State's vast natural resources, to secure<br />
lonsg lasting pros perity.<br />
Queenslarders can look forward to their future with confidence<br />
because this Commoniealth Government, together witCh your State<br />
Government have created the essential conditions in which this<br />
State can flourish.<br />
T'he fir: st requiremnent when we camre to office was to cut b~ ack inflatio<br />
which was stifliM* g developyme-)-t-To do this, tough decisions had<br />
to be m-ade. Firm control vas reqU'ired over government spending<br />
we had to reduce Labor'r-. extravagant defic-its Wo bad to bring<br />
to a St11op the xparision of the Commnonwealth bureaucracy.<br />
All this we prcnmised to do, and all this we have successfull~ y<br />
achived. NO~ Wrf~ ar is running at half of that -around 9 p. erce<br />
Because of our success in reducing inflation, interest rntes are<br />
now staztingt-o fall, and this is another significant indicator<br />
that r ecovery is wi. ijnderwa-y. Bec-ause of our success<br />
in ccontrolling goverment spending and streamlining the Australian<br />
Public Service we have manjaged to prov~ ide tax cuts for every<br />
PAustxal. ian.<br />
Our historic t'-ax reforrnis tax indexation and the reforms of the<br />
tax soalo which will come into force on FObruary 1 single<br />
out this goverrnnent as a great ref orming government., and a<br />
governrment which is determined to give individual Australians a<br />
say over how their own money is spent.<br />
Our two reforms of person. income tax have resulted ip enormous<br />
savings for taxpayers $ 3,300 million in two years._____<br />
I </p>
<p>In addition to this, we have iprovidedl business and rining. companies<br />
with the tax concessions necessary to get investment, exploration<br />
and development going again. At this very moment, $ 6,000 inillion<br />
projects are now undecr way or ready to go projects in mining,<br />
manufacturing, processing, construction anid retailing.<br />
Irhis is investment lqhich will create new jobs roal jobs whichn<br />
peopAle can _ keep.<br />
In February, ouir new tax cuts will stimulate consumier demand pom<br />
and with inflatioz n and interest rates continuing to fall, iunempamn<br />
will begin to decline and keep on steadily deolining.<br />
Our wide range of training schemeg, education progranunes and<br />
job assistance schemes for the unemployed and our upgrading<br />
of the Commonwealth BmpAoyment Service ensure that those<br />
genuinely looking for work have the skills necessary to grasp<br />
job opportunities as they arise.<br />
The prospects for 1978 are b-righter than many predicted not long<br />
ago it is clear that inflation will be ( own to between 6-8 percent<br />
by mid-1978, But all this the breakthbrough into prosperity<br />
and development which is ' upon us would be forfeited under<br />
Labox's policies. F'cr it1-is bc-yond douibt that the jeconornic programn<br />
offered by the Labour Party would bring that development and cirowth<br />
to a halt it would destroy the sound foondations Nye have laid.<br />
Labor's firsC problem ig that they cannot finally decide what their<br />
economic policey is. The confusion amongst Labor's multi-headed<br />
hydra of economic managers has now reached pore farcea.<br />
Labor's economic policies spelt out just one week ago, already<br />
have been contradicted or refuted in every major detail b<br />
Labor' s own etcnmc spokesmen.<br />
On Sunday morning Mr Whitlam began by saying that Labor woula<br />
merely postpone the tax cuts coming in on February 1. Sunday<br />
lunchtime he said " he had made a mistak~ e", that Labor would<br />
never bjring in those tax cots. Sunday afternoon he said tLax<br />
indeatin wold e ~ postponed" ' until income tax receipts<br />
rise sufficiently to offset the cost of payroll tax. By Sunday<br />
nigbt-he was sayinc4 perhaps held " expressed himself wrongly'K.<br />
Ivr Whitlain now says be would " expect"' full tax indexation<br />
sometime 2oon, but Mr Burford is checking it. Poor Dir Ffurford<br />
he had alreadly b) en thrOWn out ag Labor'S eConomic spokesman<br />
and now he had been set Scurryingq off to try to deal with Labor's<br />
great gaffe.<br />
But the impetuous Mr Hayden couldn't wait. Yesterday he said in<br />
Adelaide the definitive Labor policy was that tax cuts would be<br />
abandoned, and that there would be half tax indexation from 1 July.<br />
Nor could Mr Willis wait. lie said in Perth that Labor would<br />
bring in full tax indexation from 1 July. Where did all that<br />
leave poor fir Biurford still in Cairns tryi-ng to work it all out.<br />
He said: " Well I wouldn't know because I have ohly seen the<br />
Cairns Post this morning, and there is not a word about it in<br />
in the Cilirns Post. Fir H-urford said he would have a press<br />
conference later:<br />
" I will look at the media before I1 get to the press conference-,<br />
I'll make sure I know what has happened in the meanti-me." </p>
<p>ljovt we '-now how Labo-) r ocOnomic policy is made by the Shadiow<br />
Treasurer by consultinq th~ e papers.<br />
The second plank Of Labor's economic progranye ' is<br />
its waqes Policy. In his p'_ Olicy spceech-YX Vnitlarn commuitted<br />
Labor to " restore-integrity to the wage indexation guidelines."<br />
Triat ~ pehwas only hours oldl when Mr liayaen saA that meant<br />
support flor full wage inidexation.... but on'ly for people on less<br />
than average weekly earnings.<br />
fl3y Su-Inda-y Mr ' hitlcam war saying that Labor wanted fuil wage<br />
indexation flor everyone. Mr Mayden confessed he might be wrong:<br />
" I feel Vnm on shaky oproui-d," ha said,<br />
Hie said questions on waige indexation should b~ te irected to Fir Willis:;<br />
" I worh in the ecopomic area a demarcation problem".<br />
So rti-ch for Mr Hayden as an economic manager.<br />
If he believes wages polioy is outside the economic area, he<br />
-ertaiinly is an shak y ground.<br />
Mr-Wiiitlam % with hi~ s usual degree of frankness directed<br />
pTesg secretary to say " there was no contradiction ' between himself<br />
and kMa Hayden on wage andexation." Hie said:." We are committe( I<br />
-Lo rf~ i wage indexation, but no one has ever asked about the<br />
level at wh) icb f7ull -indexation would apply."<br />
? 4r Whjit~ am, the Cweenls ' oupnsel, must have devoted hours in coming<br />
up with an ex-lanation asz deceitful as that.<br />
There is now so much confusion on tax indexing and wage indexing<br />
the Pstrali) n public necd their ownr indcex to kerqp track.<br />
Thle central isslie of esqtate duty hag also slIown up th-e deep divisions'<br />
in Labo-cr ' Party r-a. nks. Fir Whitlan has bitterly attacked our<br />
p lan to relieve I-en-s of thousands of families the misery and<br />
burden of pa'ying dezAth duties. He was even so desperate that<br />
he usedl utterly false figures Anhis att-ack. Now Mr Hayden<br />
says hec supports the abolition of estatie duty, and bir Wran<br />
says he will follow our example and the fine example of the<br />
Queenslaind Govt-rimnent by ending state death duties too.<br />
Mr h'urfo-Td had the last word yesterday. He said the ALP could<br />
) lot responsibly make economnic decision5s seven months in advance of t<br />
1978 b~ udgjet. lie should have added that Lnbor would have trouble<br />
making responsible economic decisions after the budget or any<br />
other time for that matter..<br />
Labox. lz varicus progrannes to reduce unemploymentiir fllo<br />
errors and ~ ciqloop.-holes. They simply do not stand up to cloze<br />
examination. Let's look at z -11itlarm's proposal to t, bolish payroll<br />
tax. Mx Wh-Ltlan says lie can only abolish this tax on -companies<br />
by increa.-,: tg tLaxes on individunl Avstra' ians-. The plain fct<br />
is that Labor would have to abandon tax indexation as well<br />
as our Yebruazy tax reforms to pay for the abolition of<br />
payroll tax. The ending of payroll tax would lot effect<br />
unemployment. Mr Duns5tart pointed that out in September when, he<br />
stated: " The Government has already tried a payroll tax renmision<br />
Lchene and found that it does not create employment. H </p>
<p>4.<br />
Labor's wages polici-es wouldl enoouxage inuch higher wage<br />
rises, regardleSs of the economic dannage they iqht<br />
These wage rises would fuxther discourage eirnplovers<br />
f rojn takftg on m ore' labour, and woula put inf lation on<br />
way up again.<br />
' Yesterday a-survey-of Large -employers revealed that not o<br />
cornpany sux-veyed was prepaiced to . forecast any increane in. t~ hokr.-.<br />
own emnployme~ nt levels if payroll were abolished.<br />
The srvey-showed-that, on the'j orjtrary' emj~ loyers cons<br />
Labor's policy of full wagre indexation would inake the capri. I<br />
of business to create nciw jobs worse not better.<br />
Labor's scheme would hurt thbe -, elf-einpoye' and' many small<br />
businessmen who arc! already exe-mpt from payroll tax Ibut wY-ould)-.<br />
be lumb) ered with higher wage costs an6 higher personal tax<br />
commtmets. Well, if M4r whiltlamls Scheme Would fail to -redtice<br />
inflation, fail to help smnall business, fail to help the unemployed,<br />
what would it svcceed An doing: it would succeed in -ripping<br />
hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes fromn the Australian pueblic,<br />
just to satisfy Mr Whitlam's ill-conueived plans.<br />
To finan-ce his schemnes, Mr 1' bitljn would recall Parliament to<br />
repe, 11 tax indexatiob and our roforms of the tax scales.<br />
me would rip about $ 850 million out of the hands of the Pustralian<br />
Public this financial year -$ 19100 inillion next year more than<br />
6 a week-out of the hands of the Man) who earns $ 200 a week.<br />
ite would put this. money into the ) lands oi big a-r-J profitable<br />
copn. s inc: Luaing th-e nultinationals Mr ' Whitlam and hi; party<br />
have attacked day in ayid day out. Utah would get over $ 2 ill11ion<br />
a year; General tiotorsg would clet ar~ ou-nd $ 10 million.<br />
Labor ' s payroll tax scheive woul1d put-the States at Canberra's<br />
mercy. P14yr'o 1 tax m~ akes uip a third of thie revenue or the States.<br />
. If Labor got its, hlands oni it, Labor would have the States exactly<br />
where they want them, under thizeir thuvd).<br />
That would have one advantage for M'r Donstan it would leave ni-m mci<br />
tine to ge-t oni with his anti-uranilim Coxm-,, ercials and mnore time<br />
lirivatceiy to give every -_ ncouragameflt to viranum~ mining in his State<br />
Mr Dunstan has licensced a forn. ign. multinational com-, pany to C-xplore<br />
for uranium, not in some far off remote corner of -the State, but<br />
just 30 kilometres from Adelaide. B~ e . nust be telling<br />
his foreign company a very different story from that he puts ouL<br />
in his comm'ercials, because if he was sazyi,-g in private what<br />
he has been sayingl in public, that company would not. come withbin<br />
a thousand miles of South * Australia.<br />
The choice irn tlhis election is between the polic-y confu ion of<br />
Lab~ or and the known and effective strategy of the government.<br />
Between Labox's. po'liciieg of high taxe-s ancl high inflation and<br />
the Government's proven policies of cotting taxes and cutting ifa </p>
<p>The programme which the government has developed over the past<br />
two years ayid the -ncw in~ tiativeF. which I ann~ ounced on Mondaymeet<br />
Australia's needg. Several of the p) rogrammes I announced<br />
are of direot benefit to the city and suburbs; of Brisbane.<br />
Let me briefly mentionf a few.<br />
I do i-nct have to tell you about the deficienPcies in Drisbainels<br />
pubA. c transport, and6 the sad plight of the suburban commuter.<br />
We have decided' to continue and expand an existing programme<br />
by paying the States a total of $ 60 million a year for five<br />
years, to help improve the standnrds of our trains and bus services<br />
Voe have also decided to contribute some $ 70 ililion over five years.<br />
to upgrade critical sHections of ma-inline railways.. Por this<br />
modest outlay, many -intersttate services will be significantly<br />
improved.<br />
our new national water resources progra. mme will make available<br />
funds to improve city and country water supplies and such other<br />
vital projects as the mitigation of floods.<br />
We will help inner city areas3 by our enphasis on providing<br />
first class technical colleges. Some inner city colleges are of<br />
a standaret which simply is not acceptable to this gjovernment.<br />
They will be modernised or completely replaced.<br />
-vcryone will be hrelped b~ y itany of our other programies, FUch as<br />
tLLhe reduction of of f peak long di: 3tance telephone charges to<br />
pe~ rcent of the norminl rate.<br />
Perhaps most importantly for Brisbane, we have decided to give<br />
Brisbane the airport that the great State of Queensland dese~ jrve.<br />
Cons iderable progress has been made over the last two yearg<br />
in restoring Australia to economic health, towards<br />
making Australia a more juzt, and more equitable society.<br />
it's been hard work and there are still problems to be o-vercome.<br />
But we are now seeing the t.-a-ngible results of that work-<br />
Australia is ready to stride into a new era of prosp-erity and<br />
dcvclo pymeni:. The fundamental question which this election will<br />
decide is whether we will build on the achievements which we<br />
have made, or whether Labor will be a-. llowed to throw it away.<br />
With your help, we'll still be doing the job in 1978 and beyond. </p>
