United States' ports and Australian ports and Australian<br />
ports did not compare very well. So the overall figure<br />
got lost. There is no doubt that Australian industrial<br />
relations is one of the things which people take into account<br />
in determining what they want to do what they are going to<br />
do.-1 had something to say on Sunday over the wage claims<br />
pressing 1-ey6nd indexation.-Leave-aside philosophical<br />
. differences where there may be a few people who really do<br />
want to break the system and just look at it on anr historic4-<br />
basis. The arbitration commission in that system~ grew out of the<br />
most damaging strikes that is going back to the turn of the<br />
centurxy -and grew out of the view -that there has got to<br />
be a better way than just having employers and employees<br />

round about 10 percent which is more than the rate of inflation.,<br />
hen people talk about wage catch-up they need, to understand<br />
they are talking about something which follows the most massive<br />
growth in wages, well beyond Australia's real capacity to<br />
sustain the figure I have moSt quoted is over 50 percent<br />
in two years.. on hourly rates. I make these remarks<br />
in3 the * context of the Government nlot-having a role in.<br />
these things of . course we have but againsh the backgrounT<br />
that if we are to overcome these emiployment problems in<br />
Australia we have all got a role to play. Wie all need to<br />
ircognise that we have got a role it is within our capacity,<br />
working together, to do a great deal about it. It is<br />
also within our capacity, as a nation, to take the wrong<br />
policies in which case unemployment would remain too high.<br />
I don't believe the unions have recognised that they have<br />
a very real role. </p>
