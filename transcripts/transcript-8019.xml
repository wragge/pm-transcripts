PRIME MAINISTETRANSCRIPT<br />
OF DOORSTOP, JOHN CURTIN HOUSE, 4 MAY 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you agree that<br />
PM: Do I agree with what?<br />
JOURNALIST: That political advertising on television<br />
should be banned.<br />
PM: The only thing I'll say I agree to is that it should<br />
be discussed.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you support a referendum giving the<br />
Commonwealth more power over the environment?<br />
PM: Of course the Commonwealth should have more power<br />
but we have learnt about referenda that unless the<br />
Opposition are prepared to take a realistic and nonopportunistic<br />
stance on these issues they have very<br />
little chance of being carried. It might be a way to<br />
find out through discussion with the Opposition whether<br />
there is any sincerity about their new found interest in<br />
the environment.<br />
