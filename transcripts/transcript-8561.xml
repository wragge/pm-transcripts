PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH PETER KENNEDY, ABC RAD~ IO 29<br />
JUNE 1992<br />
E AND OE PROOF ONLY<br />
KENNEDY: Are you trying to frighten people into<br />
supporting the governmnent?<br />
PM: We had the federal director of the Liberal<br />
Party yesterday saying that people on unemployment benefits,<br />
after 9 months under a Liberal government they will be kicked<br />
of f un~ lye benefits, so somebody may 40 years of age<br />
with a wife and a couple of children will be stigmatised by<br />
them as being unemployed,, unworthy of government assistance<br />
after 9 months you are down to the voluntary agencies, and I<br />
made the point that if we run a country like that for a<br />
considerable period of time the social unrest it will produce<br />
will make it an outcome which this country has never seen<br />
before. That is you can't say to people sorry there is no<br />
sustenance and support for you, you are on your own, you are<br />
down to St Vincent de Paul or the Smith Family or the<br />
Salvation Army and that is the end of you. I mean that sort<br />
of spiteful policy is what I think will bring Australians<br />
socially unstuck.<br />
KENNEDY: But do you really think we have that record of<br />
social volatility, that emerged in Los Angeles for instance?<br />
PM: We have never had that sort of spitefulness in<br />
policy but can I just say, today Gerard Mtenzies, the director<br />
of the Anglican Community Services said on radio and he was<br />
asked by the questioner. Can I just pick up your word, he<br />
said you are using the word I think that the Liberal Party is<br />
abusing the agencies, that's the voluntary agencies and Mr<br />
Menzies said, well I think they are abusing the agencies. To<br />
think that we can come in and pick up their responsibility, I<br />
mean we do it of our own accord but to have to actually be<br />
demanded of us as in this policy I think is really quite<br />
unacceptable# and he goes on in a similar vein to may that </p>
<p>PM: ( cont'd) elsewhere in the interview. These are the<br />
policies that Dr Hewson is pushing and if anyone says look if<br />
you do that you will end up creating not only social misery<br />
but social strife his response then is that the Prime Minister<br />
is trying to scare you. What the Prime Minister is trying to<br />
do is just tell people what sort of spiteful policies Dr<br />
Hevson is actually presenting.<br />
KENNEDY: The key to all this is obviously employment<br />
isn't it, is jobs. If there are jobs for ordinary Australians<br />
then this problem won't occur.<br />
PM: Exactly, but to say that in both the cyclical<br />
impact of a recession and the unemployment which comes from it<br />
and the structural change going on in the economy and the<br />
unemployment that comes from that, to try and brand people as<br />
Mr Robb, the federal director of the Liberal Party did<br />
yesterday,, has some sort of people sponging on society not<br />
giving taxpayers a go as he put it and therefore just being<br />
wiped off all government support and sent to a voluntary<br />
agency, as Mr Menzies says quite clearly we couldn't possibly.<br />
See the Liberals have, they have got $ 50 million in there for<br />
the voluntary agencies and Mr Menzies said when you consider<br />
that the Anglican Church alone spends $ 100 million nationally<br />
and you mulitply that with all the other churches, you see<br />
million is really a drop in the ocean. This is the<br />
million that comes from the great soft heart of the Liberal<br />
Party, peanuts when they drive people into misery and poverty.<br />
KENNEDY: Let's look at the government's position and the<br />
government policy and this morning we read that the chief<br />
executive of BHPI John Prescott said One Nation was a failure,<br />
that the money had which had been designated for<br />
infrastructure projects for instance had not started flowing.<br />
PMI Well some of the railway work hasn't. I had<br />
lunch with the board of BHP last week and I made the remark<br />
myself that we had not succeeded yet in getting a green fields<br />
industrial relations agreement with the rail unions so as to<br />
facilitate the building of the standard gauge between<br />
Melbourne and Adelaide etc and we were trying to speed that up<br />
and I think what's happened is that, I think Mr Prescott<br />
repeated my own remark back to me. But the twist I think the<br />
media put on some of it, this is just a part of the One Nation<br />
package, what is also in One Nation is the tax changes for<br />
business and depreciation, the change to the airline system,<br />
the change in technical and further education, the adoption of<br />
a national electricity grid, all those things are proceeding,<br />
the national highways, the arterial ring roads, the one bit<br />
where we are now trying to break through is on this now<br />
industrial agreement for the -National Rail corporation which<br />
will mean that we can start pouring money into the system and<br />
developing these standard gauge rails and improving the Sydney<br />
Melbourne railway line etc. </p>
<p>KENNEDYs That's crucial isn't it f rom the point of view<br />
of employment and that really is the achilles heel so when do<br />
you think we will see a real improvement in employment and<br />
getting that jobless rate down?<br />
PM1 A large part of the One Nation spending has not<br />
been spent yet but it wasn't meant to be spent until the<br />
financial year 1992/ 93 which begins on 1 July, that soon. So<br />
the fact of the matter is that then we will start to see the<br />
One Nation spending coming through and that will help. But<br />
unemployment is a problem, it won't be dealt with easily or<br />
quickly, we never proposed that it would be but we want to<br />
have it trending in the right direction and we have got now<br />
interest rates have come off substantially, down to quite low<br />
levels, we have got the budget deficit playing its own role in<br />
supporting the economy, that is acting as a shock absorber,<br />
that is promoting spending and activity through the deficit<br />
and we have got these programs like one Nation coming on<br />
stream. KENNEDYi When we spoke 5 months ago here you had boen<br />
Prime Minister for I think six weeks and you were lagging the<br />
Opposition, the government was lagging the Opposition in the<br />
polls and your approval ratings were down. During that<br />
months both the government's position and your own position<br />
shot up, topped the Opposition and now it's moving down again<br />
according to the latest polls. That's a fair degree of<br />
volatility there how do you arrest that decline?<br />
PM3 I think it's the trend that matters Peter,<br />
these polls are taken every two weeks and the levels one can't<br />
rely upon the levels, it depends how they are taken, the<br />
quality of the material that is taken from them rather than<br />
just a production of raw numbers. So the trend is what i<br />
think we are interested in rather than the level and the trend<br />
has been okay for us, we have been picking up slowly across<br />
the course of the year. These are difficult times I don't for<br />
a second make light of that, it's not easy to at the one time<br />
be continuing micro economic change, changing the airline<br />
syst~ em, as I say trying to rebuil te national rail highway,-<br />
trying to change all these things, while at the same time<br />
dealing with the end of the recession and trying to deal with<br />
employment. KENNEDY&amp; You haven't got much time to do it in have you?<br />
PM: I have got the better part of 12 months and we<br />
believe the economy will be growing quite strongly through<br />
92/ 93. It's just a question about productivity, if<br />
productivity is higher rather than lower for a given level of<br />
production, it produces less growth in employment. if<br />
productivity is not so high therefore if more people are<br />
employed in the process that growth will produce higher levels<br />
of employment. So the quandry will be what, if we look at<br />
this in a year from now, what will have been the level of </p>
<p>PM: ( cont'd) productiivty on the way through. we will get<br />
the growth but exactly what level of employment we will get<br />
from the growth is the moot point.<br />
KENNEDY$ So it's a catch 22, we really need that<br />
efficiency to be able to compete internationally but in<br />
getting that efficiency it might not be reflected in<br />
significant reduction in unemployment.<br />
PM; That's right. We have got businesses now which<br />
are quite productive, they are going to produce more output<br />
but for a lower level of employment. So therefore to take<br />
employment up and unemployment down we have got to produce<br />
more growth, more output. Now I think the economy will<br />
produce quite a lot of output in this coming year but the<br />
little productivity equation in the middle will determine how<br />
many more people are in involved in that process and how much<br />
a given level of employment will produce in output by way of<br />
higher productivity.<br />
KENNEDY: So on that basis though it's going to be a hard<br />
slog to get that unemployment rate down, isn't it?<br />
PM: We do want a more efficient country, we want<br />
slimmed down efficient companies, we want them to be<br />
competitive but at the same time we don't want to see the<br />
product of that being higher levels of unemployment. We went<br />
to see that taken up in more employment which means you must<br />
have more output, therefore the economy must grow, and that's<br />
the point we keep making to the Liberal Party and Dr Hewson.<br />
You can't have an economy grow without inflation juping out<br />
of the box, without an incomes policy, without an Accord,<br />
without some basis of letting that growth be devoted to<br />
employment and not spilling over into wages and prices and so<br />
that's why we think with the Accord mechanism and the<br />
commitment from the unions that inflation will be held near<br />
our trading partners, we can let the economy grow and<br />
hopefully pull employment up.<br />
KENNEDY: on the point of employment you would be aware<br />
that one of your former ministers, Stewart West, said today<br />
that the government could not afford to be sanguine about<br />
employment and talked about Thatcherite policies and<br />
Thatcherite advice that you were getting on economic matters.<br />
PM: I am not sanguine about it and I don't think we<br />
are getting Thatcherite advice. The One Nation document was<br />
the essence of a Labor Party document, it was a building<br />
document, building on the traditional infrastructure of the<br />
public sector as I said in rail and road in other areas and<br />
while we are doing that we are trying to make the country more<br />
efficient. Now look what we are doing in training and youth<br />
policies they are the antithesis of Thatcherism. That is we<br />
are trying to train people back into the work force, we have<br />
now got these very high retention rates in schools, we have </p>
<p>PM: Ccont'd) now got this big throughput into universities,<br />
we are now trying to fix up technical and further education to<br />
take kids into a trained position in the workforce, those<br />
things are not Thatcherite they are the antithesis of<br />
Thatcherite. KENNEDY: with regard to youth, you met uepoe<br />
Iguth today and one of those young people told an ABC reporter<br />
t the talks had been in fact a failure. Is that your view<br />
of them?<br />
PMt I thought they were quite successful and I saw<br />
a report, I am not sure if it was the West Australian or the<br />
Advertiser of similar discussions I had yesterday with a group<br />
in Adelaide where the group were very praiseworthy of the<br />
nature of the discussion and my willingness to listen to their<br />
problems and take on board things and today we had a f irst<br />
class conversation. Mr Beazley was there, the Premier was<br />
there as were members of the business community and one<br />
listens to the problems and also the views that some young<br />
people are putting, how they practically find themselves, the<br />
circumstances they find themselves. Although today's group<br />
were not all unemployed some were at work, some were at<br />
university, some were at TAPE and some where unemployed and<br />
the people having most of their say today were actually at<br />
university. But last night the people I met were all<br />
unemployed and I came away with some very useful impressions.<br />
KENNEDY: The report that our reporter picked up was that<br />
while one of the people who attended, a girl, said that she<br />
was flattered that the Prime Minister wanted to talk to them<br />
that another opinion was that they didn't achieve very much.<br />
PM: I don't know what they call achieving very<br />
much. I said we are trying to get a breakthrough with entry<br />
level training wages for young people at this national meeting<br />
we are holding next month, because the problem is that I think<br />
we could have arrived at the position where we have priced a<br />
lot of young people out of the labour market and we are now<br />
trying to break through on that to get to a situation where<br />
young people can afford to be taken up by companies where the<br />
companies don't have to carry the cost of the training. The<br />
Commonwealth will carry the cost by extra places in technical<br />
and further education and other institutions but the employer<br />
carries the cost only of the non training component. Now such<br />
a breakthrough would be important but if anyone of the group<br />
there today were at university and feeling comfortable about<br />
their circumstances, maybe the unemployed ones are more<br />
interested in that than they were.<br />
KENNEDY: on another matter, you returned to the question<br />
of the Australian identity the other day. Why does the<br />
Australian identity need redefining in your view? </p>
<p>PM: Because if we go to the world uncertain about<br />
ourselves and ambiguous in our signals we won't have the<br />
response we ought to have to make a success of ourselves<br />
particularly in the Asia Pacific area and I think countries<br />
around us have taken the view does Australia want to deal with<br />
us, does it regard itself as a country of the Asia Pacific,<br />
doss it regard itself as a European country, does it see its<br />
ties with North America. These are the questions which I<br />
think are of ten put and part of the reticence of many of our<br />
close neighbours in dealing with this is they are not sure we<br />
want to deal with them. Now if we say we are a unique nation,<br />
we have got a continent to ourselves the oldest land mass on<br />
earth, it's made us different the kind of society we now have<br />
is different, it's unique, it's not European, it's not North<br />
American, it's Australian and we are happy to declare it and<br />
be unique and be part of this part of the world. That is an<br />
important I think economic change as well as an important<br />
social change.<br />
KENNEDY You started the debate on the flaa here on<br />
January 31, you were also talking about the oath of<br />
allegiance the other day and how that needed to be reworded in<br />
your view. What other things do you have in mind?<br />
PM1 I think the oahof aLlegallme is important<br />
that people actually, there-is a sort of a civic oath that<br />
people take, swear allegiance to Australia and it's values and<br />
I think that is important rather than to the head of state and<br />
that is psychologically important for themselves and the<br />
country. But I think that Australians are proud of<br />
themselves, they want to see themselves independently of<br />
independent spirit and attitude and I find it most<br />
particularly amongst young people. This morning at Perry<br />
Lakes stadium I met the country senior high schools, there<br />
were 3,000 kids there for a week of sport but the enthusiasm<br />
of them was to be seen to be believed and again in some of the<br />
young people I met at the youth fat project later, that's<br />
where our f uture is, it's with the kids who are now going<br />
through school into university who will take up the cudgels,<br />
take up the responsibility for this place and are proud of it.<br />
KENNEDY I wonder if the Australian identity is being<br />
diluted bymulticulturalism?<br />
PM: No, but I think we have to be careful that<br />
multiculturalism doesn't replace the old sort of imperial ties<br />
we had in the past, but rather be a binding thing in the new<br />
Australia. KENNEDY&amp; So no winding back on multiculturalism?<br />
PM: No but all of it's subordinate to a commitment<br />
to Australia and it shouldn't be a commuitments to other<br />
places, commitment to Australia and I think if that comes<br />
through clearly and it's come through most clearly with young </p>
<p>PM ( cont'd) people all this stuf f about paying sort of lip<br />
service to our sort of history and as important as that is but<br />
letting it have too much of an impact on the shape of it now,<br />
they are quite smart about this I think and they are quite<br />
determined to declare for Australia, to declare the place to<br />
be a unique place to be out there doing it around this part of<br />
the world and wanting to do it.<br />
KENNEDY: You started the f lag debate here at the end of<br />
January. PM$ We did indeed Peter.<br />
KENNEDY; What stage has it reached?<br />
PM: It's become an important debate, people are now<br />
focussing on it as they have never focussed before but I have<br />
said and I am quite happy to repeat that before we would<br />
contemplate any change to it we would have a plebiscite of<br />
some kind so people will have their say, the government won't<br />
be changing the thing without there being some very clear<br />
support for such a change and that manifesting itself by way<br />
of a vote of some kind. But there is no doubt we can't go on<br />
with a representational image of ourself with a flag of<br />
another country in our flag.<br />
KENNEDY: No early decision?<br />
PM: There will be a process and we have got to<br />
agree, we have got to talk about that but certainly we won't<br />
be seeking to do anything other than by giving the public a<br />
say. ENDS </p>
