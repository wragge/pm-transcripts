PROME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 22 APRIL 1979<br />
ADDRESS TO THE NATION<br />
Tonight I want to talk particularly to the working men and<br />
women of Australia. I want to talk to you about matters<br />
that affect all of us each day which are important for<br />
Australia. If we all play our cards right, Australia will move into<br />
the 1980' s with more faith with more confidence than<br />
any other Western nation. It can be a great decade of<br />
growth, of development, of new opportunities for all<br />
Australians, for our sons and our daughters, or we can " blow it".<br />
Economic recovery is with us. Confidence is much stronger<br />
than for years. Australian industry is more competitive.<br />
Businesses are investing more businesses are selling<br />
more here and overseas. Exports are up. Australian<br />
farms are doing well for the first time in many years.<br />
Australian industry is busier than it has been for a long<br />
while. It's starting to employ more people. If this process<br />
continues uninterrupted, Australia will have it made. Your<br />
Government's policies will be directed to seeing that this<br />
happens. Tonight I want to speak of attitudes and actions amongst a<br />
few of us that almost seem designed to sabotage economic<br />
recovery. Strikes, and bans and industrial disruption, are<br />
against your interest. They harm the striker, his firm.<br />
They harm the community. They harm you and your family.<br />
It's happened too much in recent weeks. We saw milk being<br />
tipped down the gutter because of the. Transport Workers<br />
Union. We saw the Postal Union holding up mail, the truckies<br />
blockading capital cities especially Sydney. We saw the<br />
air controllers delaying flights, and inconveniencing<br />
passengers all across Australia, and the strike by the paint<br />
industry employees causing loss of production and loss of<br />
wages. None of these actions was necessary. They were totally<br />
disruptive. They were selfish because they disregarded<br />
the hurt done to other people; to children who couldn't<br />
get milk, to working men and women who were stood down / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
because of shortages of supplies and who therefore lost wages.<br />
But it's not only selfish. So often strikes are.. fruitless<br />
and stupid.<br />
I've * already mentioned the strike in the paint industry.<br />
The strikers were out for about five weeks and in the end<br />
they went back to work and said " let the arbitration system<br />
decide". They could have said that right at the beginning,<br />
but instead they struck and lost up to $ 1,000 each in wages.<br />
They were asking for an extra $ 11 a week. Even if the paint<br />
workers had won, it could have taken them up to two years or<br />
even longer to catch up on the wages they lost when they were<br />
on strike.<br />
It is worth remembering though, that the union officials who<br />
initiate strikes often go on getting paid. Nobody else wins<br />
in strikes and it is precisely because nobody wins that we<br />
have an arbitration system the impartial umpire to enable<br />
us to resolve disputes without harming anyone. We need to<br />
give that umpire a fair go. When people in Government employment<br />
go on strike, use bans or go-slow rules to disrupt work and to<br />
harm other people in the community, we as a Government have<br />
already decided that our immediate reactions will be much tougher.<br />
The principle of " no work as directed, no pay" will be applied<br />
vigorously and stand down clauses will be implemented or<br />
applied when there is no work for people as a result of a<br />
strike. If companies give in to pressure outside the arbitration<br />
system, they will be inviting a Prices Justification Tribunal<br />
inquiry into their pricing policies. If essential supplies for<br />
other industries are held up, running the risk of further stand<br />
downs, those industries will be allowed to import under by-law.<br />
But wouldn't it be far better if this kind of Government action<br />
was totally unnecessary?<br />
What I am asking you to do is to help make the arbitration<br />
system work. It's in your hands in the * hands of the great<br />
majority of Australian working men and women. I haven't the<br />
slightest doubt that Australia's working men and women want<br />
to do a fair day's work for a fair day's pay; that Australia's<br />
working men and women know that unreasonable wage claims keep<br />
others out of jobs; know that industrial disputes threaten<br />
recovery and that they want none of that.<br />
Most Australian working men and women are in trade unions.<br />
It is for you to make your voice heard, to let the arbitration<br />
system work without threat, without bans without strikes.<br />
I ask you to do everything you can to prevent the few from<br />
disrupting whole industries with all the harm that follows<br />
for so many people. I ask you to do this because it is within<br />
your power. I ask you this because it is a major way in which<br />
you can help to keep the economic recovery going, because this<br />
is a major way in which you can help yourself, your family,<br />
your mates down the street. I ask you this because it's the<br />
best way to help Australia. </p>
