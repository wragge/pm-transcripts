PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH AT THE WHYLL WORKERS CLUB S<br />
1 NOVEMBER 1975<br />
engagement f or months past up at Port Augusta<br />
tomorrow morning. It's a diamond jubilee, an ecclesiastical<br />
diamond jubilee. And I get so few of these invitations I<br />
found it irresistable. So I though in the present situation<br />
I should spend a day on the way at Alice Springs and then, of<br />
course, we flew on here and I welcome very much the opportunity<br />
to drop in at the Club.<br />
There is perhaps a couple of things I might say to<br />
you. The situation that we have in the national Parliament is<br />
one to which you're very much accustomed in South Australia.<br />
Because there is no part of Australia which is so very much<br />
aware of the intrusions and the usurpations of an Upper House<br />
of Parliament as you are in South Australia. Because the<br />
Legislative Counrcil here for years has rejected legislation<br />
from the House of Assembly and for years has prevented<br />
South Australia having a decent, equal, fair electoral system.<br />
And Don Dunstan has suffered from this and Steele Hall suffered<br />
from this.. That is, anybody who wanted to bring about any<br />
reforms has suffered from the Upper House of South Australia.<br />
Now for three years that we've had a Labor Government<br />
in the Australian Parlia. ment, we've been suffering from the<br />
Senate, the Upper House there. And in the last three years<br />
the Senate has rejected more Bills than it had rejected in<br />
the previous 72 years of its existence. Fewer than 70 Bills<br />
were rejected from 1901 to the end of 1972 when we came in;<br />
and since then it's rejected over 90 Bills. Now it's come to<br />
a climax when the Senate has gone on strike over the Budget.<br />
It hasn't rejected the Budget Bills. But for three times on<br />
each of the three basic Bills it has carried a motion to defer<br />
the debate, to go on strike, as far as the Budget is concerned.<br />
And they are doing this partly because they know that if there<br />
is a vote on the Budget it would be carried.<br />
Mr Fraser's own Senators, some of the Liberals, have<br />
said they would not vote against the Budget; that was<br />
Senator Bessell of Tasmania said it on Four Corners last weekend<br />
and he also said that there were several others of the same<br />
mind. So if it came to a vote on the Budget it would be passed.<br />
Now the attempt t-hat is being made is to stand over<br />
the elected Government. Because in Australia as in British<br />
democracies all round the world, the Government is formed by the<br />
Party or Parties with a majority in the Lower House, the House<br />
of Commons or the House of Representatives. That's where the<br />
Prime Minister has to be; that's where the Treasurer must be.<br />
And, you know, the Senate in Australia now, is behaving as the<br />
House of Lords used to do before 1911. Just as Asquith in 1911<br />
broke the power of the House of Lords over Money Bills we now<br />
in Australia have to break the power of the Senate over Money<br />
Bills. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
As you know, in Britain the House of Lords can't hold<br />
up any Money Bill for more than three months. And it's never<br />
tried even to do that. And in Australia for the last 75 years<br />
the Constitution says that the Senate can't initiate Money Bills;<br />
it can't amend Money Bills; and all. it can do is make requests<br />
to amend them. And the House of Representatives may then,<br />
if it likes, make amendments. But this time the Senate hasn't<br />
rejected, it hasn't in fact even made requests. But what it is<br />
trying to do is to say that whenever a Government hasn't got a<br />
majority in the Senate, then the Senate can bring about an<br />
election for the House of Representatives.<br />
And they tried this in April last year and I then<br />
accepted the position, we had a double dissolution but for<br />
three months we were without a Parliament, it took so long to<br />
hold the election and to count the results. I'm not prepared<br />
to have another three months without a Parliament at this stage.<br />
I'm not prepared to say that the Government which has been twice<br />
elected, twice elected for a three year term is to be interrupted<br />
and brought to a halt and the whole system interrupted at the<br />
behest of tShe Senate. Because the Liberal and the Country Party,<br />
they haven't got a majority in the Senate, they had 165,000<br />
fewer votes last May for the Senate than we had, 165,000 votes<br />
more for Labor candidates for the Senate in May last year,<br />
than for the candidates for the Senate of all the other Parties<br />
in the Senate. And we ended up with 29 Senators; they ended<br />
up with 29 Senators and there were two Independents. One of<br />
the, Steele Hall, has remained pretty independent. The other<br />
one joined the Libe-rals. But they still haven't got a majority<br />
inm the Senate. We have a majority in the House of Representatives;<br />
we have a majority in the whole Parliament. The Joint Sitting<br />
showed that. We are entitled to govern. When we went to the<br />
people they elected us for three years; the other side have<br />
not accepted that. Never before in the 75 years that there's<br />
been an Australian ? Parliament has the Senate ever voted against<br />
a Money Bill. Althorgh again and again, 139 occasions, there<br />
have been Money BillIs passed by the Senate although the government<br />
of the day didn't have a majority of the Senate. Because if the<br />
Senate is evenly divided then the motion or Bill is not passed.<br />
Now it's on that technicality that they're relying. Although if<br />
it went to a vote there would be sufficient Liberal Senators to<br />
vote in favour of the Bill, for the money, the Budget and it<br />
would be passed. What's be'e-n happening is that Bjelke-Petersen, the<br />
Country Party Prem~ ier of Queensland, appointed an anti-Labor<br />
man a scab, Pat the Rat to succeed a Labor man. And if<br />
Senator Milliner '-ad still been alive he would, as he had always<br />
throughout his life of service in the Labor movement, have<br />
supported the Labor Par-ty. And the motion to defer the debate<br />
would have been defeated because there would have been as many<br />
people voting agars it as voting for it. But it's purely over<br />
a dead man's body as Steele Hall has put it, that this motion<br />
to defer the Budge-t, to go on strike in the Senate, has been<br />
carried. </p>
<p>A -3-<br />
Now I want to conclude on this: an area like this<br />
at the top of the Gulf, this Iron Triangle you depend very much<br />
on Australian Government employment, and Australian Government<br />
orders. Places like this would be hard up indeed if it were<br />
not the Australian National Railways; if it were not for the<br />
subsidies which are paid for the ships which are constructed<br />
in the largest shipbuilding yards in Australia, here in Whyalla,<br />
And you know better than most people in Australia what happens<br />
to your employment and to your amenities and to your prosperity<br />
if the, payments made by the Australian Government are interrupted<br />
or reduced. My Government has been the first one which has<br />
taken any interest in local amenities. Your Council here, has<br />
received money directly to spend as it sees fit. In the last<br />
two years it's in the Budget at the monent which is waiting<br />
to go through you've have assistance from the Australian<br />
Governmen-for sporting and cultural and educational facilities,<br />
such as no-previous Australian Government has ever paid.<br />
Let me give you some of the figures on that:<br />
Local Government here, the Whyalla City Council last year got<br />
$ 178,000 from the Australian Governmnent. In this year's<br />
Budget there's $ 210,000. The Australian Assistance Plan uptil<br />
24th of October so far-has $ 18,000, and that's the rate it<br />
will be getting for the rest of the year, if the Budget goes<br />
through. You've had a community recreation centre, $ 360,000<br />
from the Australian Government. And a supplementary grant of<br />
$ 40,000; you've had things for the lifesaving club; for the<br />
sew erage program $ 73,000; pensioner dwellings $ 105,000;<br />
the RED Scheme over half a million.<br />
Ladies and ilentlemen these are indications of what<br />
the Labor Government of Australia has been trying to do for areas<br />
like tais which no Drevious Australian Government has ever<br />
attem--, ed to do. oWe set out to do it. We want to make<br />
certaina that company tzw-ans, such as Whyalla or Port Augusta or<br />
Port Pinie, are assisr~ ed to provide the amenities which people<br />
want in their spare timne: education, culture, recreation<br />
and so on. No Austral-ian Government has ever done it before.<br />
Previous Governments afforded not to. Do you want a Liberal<br />
Government again to cut off all these things? You have your<br />
answer mate; you have your answer. The Australian people<br />
have twice elected an Australian Labor Party Government in Canberra.<br />
It's entitled to govern. And you can't have the usurpations,<br />
my Lord, of the Senate taking over from the elected government<br />
of Australia. Ladies and gentlemen, stand firm on this. So<br />
many people came to Australia because they thought that it was<br />
possible here to elect a government at a secret ballot to change<br />
the Government by peaceful means; their faith is being destroyed<br />
by these impatient, t:--ese unconstitutional, these greedy people<br />
in the Senate: the LIberal and Country Party. In an area like<br />
this in the next few months you will have an election for the<br />
Senate. Make certain-that once again you give a majority in<br />
this area, this State, 1 to the Labor Party candidate. </p>
