0 NEWS ITERVIEW WITH CHANNEL 9, MELBOURPNE,<br />
9 4ENBY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. JOHN GORTON 14 September 1969<br />
Q. What is your reaction, Mr. Prime Minister, to the<br />
demonstration outside?<br />
PM. Well, I think it was a perfectly peaceful and orderly<br />
gathering. There was no attempt to use any force, nothing of that kind.<br />
I think it would have been more interesting if their voices and their<br />
singing had been a little bit better, but that is the only criticism I<br />
would care to make:<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, in our " Today" programme on<br />
Channel 9 on Friday, the External Affairs Minister, Mr. Freeth,<br />
seemed to indicate that any close association with Russia wouldn't do<br />
Australia any good. You seem to have said the opposite to this.<br />
Could you clarify this?<br />
PM. You have got an awful lot of " seems" in there and I<br />
haven't seen the speech to which you refer. Frankly, I don't accept<br />
your interpretation of it and I would doubt very much if it seemed that<br />
way.<br />
Q. But you do agree there is confusion at the moment?<br />
PM. No. I don't. I admit there is misinterpretation of a<br />
perfectly simple speech. It's no different from speeches which have<br />
been made in the past but it has been misinterpreted in very, very<br />
odd ways indeed. There has been some suggestion that we would be<br />
happy to see a military presence or would be happy to join in some<br />
collective security pact or to see Russia join in some collective<br />
security pact. I want to make it perfectly clear that we realise better<br />
than anybody that the continuing aim of communism is imperialist<br />
domination of the world and we would regard it as dangerous for us if<br />
Russian military or naval bases were set up in that part of the world,<br />
but there has never been any slightest suggestion that we should enter<br />
into any kind of collective security pact with Russia. We would not<br />
look with any favour on Russia entering into a military security pact<br />
with countries to our North, but we would like to see the countries to<br />
our North enter into a security pact amongst themselves and help<br />
each other and if that were a common objective, then I would have no<br />
objection whatever to that. But that is quite different to any Russian<br />
military bases or military presence or Russian participation. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Q. Well this actually brings up two points the first, say,<br />
Russian ships in the Indian Ocean.<br />
PM. Well the Indian Ocean is an international ocean and ships<br />
have a right to go there. So far there has been no great incursion of<br />
Soviet ships into the Indian Ocean. If there were, they have a perfect<br />
right to be there and we couldn't stop them unless somebody suggested<br />
we should go to war with Russia or something like that, but should<br />
there be a build-up of Russian naval power in the Indian Ocean then<br />
we would obviously need to watch it as the United States have said they<br />
will be watching it.<br />
Q. On the economic side, you were saying if the countries<br />
to our North formed a pact this would be fine, but if Russia persisted.....<br />
PM. Now are you sure you are not getting a. little confused<br />
yourself. I said " A collective security pact of countries to our North"<br />
which means a general effort of trying to help themselves in all ways,<br />
including military ways as well. On the matter of providing economic<br />
assistance, we want to see the people of these countries given a better<br />
standard of living. That has always been our objective, the hope that<br />
they would get better administrations, their economies would build up<br />
and the benefit of those improved economies would spread throughout<br />
the people. That requires various kinds of economic assistance and<br />
we could certainly have no objection to such economic assistance being<br />
provided by the USSR, provided there were no strings attached,<br />
provided there was no great incursion of technicians or something<br />
else, but this is speaking purely of economic assistance. And that is<br />
our objective.<br />
Q. You don't believe that this is what could be described<br />
as a " soft line"<br />
PM. Good Heavens, no.<br />
Q. Is this what you believe your critics are suggesting is<br />
the " soft line"?<br />
PM. I don't know what they are suggesting except they seem<br />
to have completely distorted what in fact Mr. Freeth said and jumped<br />
to completely unwarranted conclusions about us being happy if there<br />
were military bases or a military presence or Russians entering into<br />
a pact there none of which is justified.<br />
Q. The coming election, Mr. Prime Minister. The<br />
Gallup polls are indicating that there is a substantial swing to the<br />
Labor Party. What is your reaction to this? / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
PM. The Gallup polls, I think, indicated a three per cent<br />
swing from the high point which would have been roughly the same as<br />
the 1966 elections. That is common. If you look at the history of the<br />
Gallup polls, it is common for them to come closer together during<br />
an election period or when an election is in the offing. Having said<br />
all that I am always happier with Gallup polls which I don't regard<br />
as utter authorities but I am always happier when they go for us<br />
rather than against us.<br />
Q. How do you feel about former Liberals standing against,<br />
for example, the Army Minister, Mr. Lynch?<br />
PM. I think there is a local problem there. Ever since MiL.<br />
Lynch has been elected, a certain group in the electorate has been<br />
strongly opposed to him personally and I think this has played a very<br />
large part.<br />
Q. I will have to use the word " seemed" again because I<br />
can only gauge this from outside reports that there is dissension<br />
within your own Party, that there is certain unhappiness with your<br />
leadership.<br />
PM. I don't believe there is. Are you basing your question<br />
on the meeting of 12 or 14 people at the North Sydney Branch which is<br />
one of the 25 Branches in the North Sydney electorate. You probably<br />
are. AnyIway it is absolutely ridiculous.<br />
Q. You don't consider some of these " fall-out" people are<br />
spurring others on?<br />
PM. Oh yes, I woulId think so, but I should imagine with<br />
very little success.<br />
Q. One other point which I haven't mentioned to you at all<br />
is the ACTU and the new leader of the ACTU. Do you have any<br />
comment at all about Mr. Bob Hawke's election?<br />
PM. Oh, I think we will have to wait to see what develops.<br />
Q. On this basis, do you believe, as some would say, that<br />
the position of President of the ACTLJ is almost as important in this<br />
country as the Prime Minister?<br />
PM. No, but I think it is a very important position. I don't<br />
think it is as powerful, but I think it is a very significant post. </p>
