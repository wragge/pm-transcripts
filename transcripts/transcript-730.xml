FOR PRESS P. M. No. A51961<br />
SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL'S RETIREMENT<br />
Statement b-y the Pring Ministers the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert<br />
The announcement that Sir Winston<br />
Churchill will not recontest his House of Commons<br />
seat is perhaps not entirely unexpected by those who<br />
know him. But when the period of his membership of<br />
the House terminates, it will be the end of a remarkable<br />
parliamentary era.<br />
Sir Winston has been essentially a great<br />
parliamentarian with a profound low of the House of<br />
Comons and many lively memories of the battles he has<br />
conducted in that foram. All round the world there<br />
will be hundreds of millions of people who will wish<br />
him a happy retirement, a retirement in which he can<br />
Justly recall that we all feel under an immense debt<br />
to him for his courage and leadership.<br />
CANBERRA, 2nd May, 1963. </p>
