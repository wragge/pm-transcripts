PREgMVI MNHSTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 4 May 1983<br />
In view of the success of the National Economic Summit and the<br />
Government's intention to establish the Economic Pl~ anning<br />
Advisory Council, the Government has decided to end the practice<br />
of holding formal pre-Budget consultations with major community,<br />
business and employee organisations.<br />
The Economic Planning Advisory Council ( EPAC) is intended to<br />
continue the process of consultation and information exchangebegun<br />
at the Summit, and to provide broad~ ly-based machinery for<br />
the development and exchange of views on economic policy and the<br />
medium and longer term economic outlook.<br />
It will enable more regular arnd informative discussions to be held<br />
than the existing arrangements in respect of pre-Budget<br />
consultations.<br />
A representative working party has been established to advise the<br />
Government on the appropriate form and function of EPAC.<br />
Details of the Government's decisions on these matters will be<br />
announced soon.<br />
As well as these formal arrangements for consultation, I expect<br />
informal discussions, including on a bilatocral basis, to be<br />
greatly increased under my Government.<br />
As I said at the Summit:<br />
" I say to you now on behalf of each one of my<br />
Ministers, that they stand ready to help you,<br />
irrespective of your industrial, political or<br />
social affiliation. Equally, their doors are<br />
open to each of you and I trust that in the<br />
days, weeks, months and years ahead you will<br />
take advantage of that unequivocal offer and<br />
statement. In the same way, with what I<br />
understand is your welcome permission, we will<br />
seek to do that'so that, in a direct sense, we<br />
may, as a Government and as individual.<br />
Ministers, continue to be able to draw upon<br />
your reserves of knowledge and experience that<br />
you have so freely and graciously made<br />
available to all of us during this week". </p>
<p>2.<br />
i However, these undertakings are not limited to Summit<br />
participants. The Government has a genuine commitment to consult and is keen<br />
to hear the views of groups and individuals in the conmmunity.<br />
I believe that the availability of my Ministers for informal<br />
consultation and the formal machinery we intend to establish<br />
make it unnecessary to continue with the pre-Budget consultations,<br />
which had proved less than fully satisfactory from all points of<br />
view. </p>
