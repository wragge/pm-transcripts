    <content><![CDATA[<p>PM: We're up here at Woori Yallock for the Grand Final of the Second Division of the Yarra Valley Mountain League. Kinglake are playing, and they're playing Olinda. Kinglake, as you might remember, was one of the towns really badly affected by the Victorian Bushfires.??</p>
<p>In fact, most of the towns in this league were affected in one way or another. The fact that Kinglake actually pulled themselves together, and decided as a community that come hell or high water they were going to have a team in this year's comp was fantastic. Secondly, the fact that they've actually got through to the Grand Final is extraordinary. Thirdly, the fact that here we are in the third quarter and it's more or less even stevens is beyond fantastic. ??</p>
<p>The community's really pulled together for this, and I'm the patron of the team, that's why I'm here.</p>
