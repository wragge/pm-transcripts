TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH KERRY O'BRIEN, LATELINE, ABC TV<br />
22 JUNE 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
KOB: Mr Keating, welcome to Lateline.<br />
PM: Thank you, Kerry.<br />
KOB: Whatever else we talk about tonight, I know it won't surprise you that intere -st rates<br />
comes first? You have repeated time after time in the past few months that none of<br />
the fundamentals in the Australian economy justify a rise in interest rates. But the<br />
bond markets continue to go mad, the bond rate is up from 6.5 per cent in February<br />
to nearly 10 * per cent today. How long can you resist that pressure with all of the<br />
psychological instability that it builds into the market place and into Australia's<br />
business community, and for Australian consumers for that matter?<br />
PM: Well I think it builds a bit into the market place, but I am not sure it builds that much<br />
in the business community. I think what has happened here has been triggered off<br />
by American activities. The United States federal funds rate got down to 3 per<br />
percentage points. At our lowest we are at four and three quarters. That is, one<br />
and three quarter percentage points above the Americans. They had their<br />
economy far more fully employed and there was pressure in the US financial<br />
markets to say, look, these rates are too low. Three or four moves by the US<br />
Federal Reserve Board brought them up.<br />
KOB: And they are expected to keep going up.<br />
PM: Well, I don't know about that. And, we are at four and three quarters, so our<br />
business lending rates, this very day, is somewhere between 6 and 9 per cent.<br />
That is, 6 to 6.5 per cent if you are in Bills, 9 per cent if you are getting reasonably<br />
preferred rates. Now, we are talking about an underlying rate of inflation of 2 per<br />
cent here, Kerry. So, that is a real rate of interest somewhere between 4.5 per cent<br />
and 7 per cent. Now, that is not low. This is not easy money. This is business<br />
lending, 4.5 to 7 per cent real. So, I think a few people in the markets should dwell<br />
on some of those facts and just remember those things.<br />
i </p>
<p>KOB: Yes, but they are not are they? I mean, they would know that, they would know<br />
that as well as you do. That doesn't seem to influence them at all.<br />
PM: They have taken the US scene as our own, and it is not our own. I mean the fact is<br />
we are doing much better on growth. One of the problems we always had in<br />
Australia is wage push inflation. Wage is growth, average weekly earning growth<br />
in the year to March was point 5 per cent, half of a per cent.<br />
KOB: Yes, but you see you have been trotting these figures out in one form or another for<br />
months. The message has been substantially the same. They are not taking any<br />
notice of you.<br />
PM: Kerry, you have got to go back a long time to remember a conjunction of these sort<br />
of circumstances. We have had inflation decelerating.<br />
KOB: I know. You know, they know. But the bond rate is still going up, they are still<br />
saying that they know you are going to have to increase interest rates by three<br />
quarters of a per cent to one per cent.<br />
PM: I mean, here's the Government, the labour market, the trade unions, the business<br />
community, everybody, has got inflation down statistically to one per cent, with an<br />
underlying rate of about two. Of all places we have got the financial market saying,<br />
oh, hang on, we think it might be 4 per cent or 5 per cent, and we are pricing our<br />
instruments accordingly. The problem with that sort of an approach, were the<br />
Government to simply say, " well that's right, don't take any notice of us or anyone<br />
else in the business community". The problem with all that is that it starts<br />
generating wage claims. People start saying, well hang on, if mortgage rates are<br />
rising, if the wage restraint I have given has been useless, if there is nothing in it<br />
for me but higher interest rates and higher costs let's go and claim it in the market<br />
place.<br />
KOB: So, you are saying that if interest rates do go up they could trigger another push for<br />
wages?<br />
PM: I am just saying you wouldn't want people in the bond markets, you are talking<br />
about bond market dealers. Now, these are people in super funds, managing a<br />
bond portfolio, probably somewhere between 25 and 40 years of age, maybe been<br />
through one economic down-turn, maybe, never really had any grip on inflation<br />
fighting as a concept, telling the Government, the ACTU, the trade unions, the<br />
business community, that they know better about inflation than we know.<br />
KOB: How long can you continue to stare the markets down?<br />
PM: Well, the Government, we, have made our position very clear. While the<br />
fundamentals are as we have them, then we don't see a need to shift short term<br />
rates. Now, as the recovery goes on, Kerry, and there is simply more growth and<br />
more investment and a bigger demand for funds, the price of money may rise. But<br />
that is not here yet. You have got to remember this, this is before the investment<br />
phase, the large investment phase. I mean, you have got people in markets<br />
wanting to lift interest rates actually before the investment comes. </p>
<p>KOB: Absolutely, and that is a problem in itself, isn't it? I mean, you say that the<br />
business community is not terribly fussed at this moment, but Ian Salmon, the head<br />
of the Business Council and also perhaps Australia's biggest investor expressing<br />
real concern about the implications of all of this right now. We hear Bert Evans<br />
representing the metal trades sector, an important sector, saying that this could<br />
have deleterious affects, so they are concerned. I mean, in terms of the<br />
psychological impact.<br />
PM: I am not saying that people mightn't be concerned about it, but the point is, facts<br />
are facts and a truth is a truth. Wages growth is half a percentage point for the<br />
year. I mean, you have got to back 30 to 35 years to find something like that.<br />
KOB: Do you believe that an increase is still months away?<br />
PM: Well, I'm not here to be giving you a calendar..<br />
KOB: You have gone to some degree in the past<br />
PM: Look, I am not here to be calibrating interest rate movements and timing versus<br />
activity. But I will just make this point, we have seen a substantial appreciation of<br />
the Australian dollar now over the last four or five months. And this again, what<br />
doesi it do? If does two things. It makes imports cheaper which makes a more<br />
competitive environment, and therefore keeps downward pressure on inflation. It<br />
takes some of the price surge out of commodity prices going to the primary export<br />
sector, it moderates growth, it moderates surges in income and it provides more<br />
price competition in the economy. This isn't a further bull point for inflation. That<br />
is, for low inflation. So, when you look at all those fundamentals they are looking<br />
pretty right.<br />
KOB:. Do you believe the reports that the Reserve Bank is becoming more concerned<br />
about protecting its credibility on the Fssue of controlling inflation? How does it get<br />
back ahead of the markets and convince them of its resolve to keep inflation under<br />
3 per cent, and that resolve is still strong without actually putting rates up?<br />
PM: I noticed some report yesterday, or today it might have been, saying that people in<br />
the bond markets are worried about the Government and the Reserve Banks<br />
resolve on inflation. Now, I am just saying to you, these are by and large people in<br />
the 25-30 age bracket.<br />
KOB: Their age bracket doesn't matter.<br />
PM: But these are people who have not been through two or three economic cycles.<br />
That's the point I am telling you.<br />
KOB: But that doesn't matter does it, if they are the people that are calling the shots?<br />
PM: I am telling you, about inflation, you have got to live through the surge in inflation in<br />
Australia in the ' 70s, that of very high inflation rates to understand what has<br />
happened here. There has been a break in inflationary expectations and we have<br />
seen a rapid deceleration in inflation. The Reserve Bank and the Government put<br />
cash rates up to 18 per cent for over 18 months. So, if that is not resolve, Kerry,<br />
what is it? What is resolve? Can I just say that we have just done another Accord, </p>
<p>another Accord, $ 8.00 for the bottom third of the workforce for the next two years,<br />
which is again consistent with that very low inflation rate.<br />
KOB: If business and consumer confidence clearly become affected by this, and if the<br />
instability is on-going, your hand will be forced won't it? Regardless of political<br />
problems?<br />
PM: Well I don't know. The point is we will see how activity goes. That's the point.<br />
That is, growth and investment and demand for funds, but we will always keep a<br />
weathered eye on inflation. That is, we will keep our low inflation objective always<br />
in place in operating monetary policy.<br />
KOB: Is it your anticipation at this stage that there will be no sign of heat on inflation, of<br />
undue heat in the economy for at least several months?<br />
PM: I can't see it anywhere.<br />
KOB: You don't expect it?<br />
PM: I can't see it.<br />
KOB: For months to come?<br />
PM: We keep getting national accounts data and every quarter wages growth<br />
moderates, inflation decelerates, you know. The Government has always, always<br />
got an eye on wage claims, always. And it will always keep an eye particularly in<br />
an upswing in the cycle.<br />
KOB: Politically it is a frustrating bind for you, isn't it? The Opposition has been harping<br />
about a rise for months. A rise at some time does seem inevitable. The minute<br />
that rates go up they rekindle the public's painful memories. That is, business<br />
memories and home owners memories of that awful spiral up to 18 per cent plus.<br />
And the minute they have gone up the speculation will start again, won't it, about<br />
the next rise after that? I don't know how you deal with that politically.<br />
PM: Well just cast yourself back three to four weeks. What was the Opposition saying,<br />
Mr Downer then as Shadow Treasurer, he was saying he couldn't believe the<br />
growth forecast in the Budget, they were too optimistic. Remember the attack on<br />
Budget night? That growth, there wasn't enough of it. The Government had<br />
overestimated the growth forecast and we needed more of it but we weren't going<br />
to get it. Now, we have got the growth, what's his line today? The growth doesn't<br />
matter, what his line today is is interest rates.<br />
KOB: At some stage interest rates are going to go up, and when they do you have got a<br />
political problem, and the minute they do the cycle starts again too.<br />
PM: Kerry, I can talk over you to, if you want me to.<br />
KOB: Yes, go for it.<br />
PM: The Opposition is just into opportunism, three weeks ago there is not enough<br />
growth and the Government has cooked the figures. </p>
<p>KOB: Yes, you said that.<br />
PM: When the national accounts come out at 5 per cent growth, there is now too much<br />
growth. They are barracking for the markets, the financial market, this narrow<br />
financial market, they are barracking for the market against the interests of the<br />
country. That's what Alexander Downer is doing.<br />
KOB: But you have still got a political problem which surely you must acknowledge that<br />
when interest rates do go up it will trigger very painful memories and it will also<br />
immediately they go up there will be another cycle of predictions about further<br />
rises.<br />
PM: But, Kerry, were interest rates to rise at any time, at any time, off a cash rate of<br />
around 5 per cent, you are drawing a very long bow to be talking about 5 per cent<br />
and 18, aren't you?<br />
KOB: Yes, but you are dealing with psychology as well aren't you? You are dealing with<br />
perceptions and you are dealing with memories, and they are painful memories.<br />
PM: At the moment, they are good memories. I mean, you have got low housing rates<br />
of interest.<br />
KOB: Although you say yourself the real interest rate is high?<br />
PM: But you have had a huge increase in disposable income from lower interest rates,<br />
and that's one of the reasons why we have seen a boom in housing starts.<br />
KOB: But you do acknowledge that real interest rates are high compared to other<br />
countries?<br />
PM: I say that real interest rates, there is no easy money in Australia, with real rates of<br />
interest at the figures I nominated earlier.<br />
KOB: I take it you are still confident of meeting those all important budget targets on<br />
business investment. How early and how strongly do you expect to see it flowing in<br />
the new financial year?<br />
PM: Well, the conditions have never been more propitious and what you find with these<br />
sorts of economic conditions the text books work. I mean, you get the investment<br />
and you can see it in the expectations data.<br />
KOB: But, we've been waiting and waiting and waiting and I know that the signs appear<br />
to be good, but how strongly and how early in the new financial year do you expect<br />
to see it flowing?<br />
PM: Well, I think the budget forecasts will be met. The thing about this recovery as the<br />
Treasury said in Statement Two, it's had a rolling nature. It started with<br />
government consumption, then private consumption, then housing and then<br />
investment. So, it has had a four phase roll in quality to it and I think that's fine. </p>
<p>KOB: But, have you got any sense of whether that's going to come as a great spurt or<br />
whether it's going to come in a kind of steady flow over the 12 months. I mean,<br />
what are the signs that you and the Treasury are going to be looking for to<br />
reassure yourselves that that business investment is going to be of the order that<br />
you want and so desperately need and what scope do you have for further action if,<br />
in fact, it doesn't appear to be coming in the way it should?<br />
PM: Well, we'll take the partial data which comes through monthly and we'll take the<br />
anecdotal evidence as it comes through and we'll see, I think, there investment<br />
reflecting the budget forecast.<br />
KOB: Debate continues about the issue of public sector infrastructure spending and the<br />
kind of infrastructure we have and should have and you know backwards the<br />
arguments that core public sector infrastructure feeds business investment<br />
because it assists private sector productivity as well as creating jobs. Yet, public<br />
sector infrastructure is at its lowest level since the war. It was 7.5 per cent of GDP<br />
in 1984-85, it's been declining ever since apart from the blip of ' One Nation'.* 1994-<br />
it's going to be down to 4.4 per cent of GDP. Haven't you got to arrest that<br />
decline and if you can't increase deficits, haven't you got to raise taxes to do so.<br />
PM: No. Well, the first point is this. In the 1980s Australia was caught in a classic<br />
squeeze of a sharp decline in national income coming from the worst commodity<br />
prices since the depression. That was the 1986 crash in the terms of trade which<br />
brought on the ' banana republic' stuff. We made a very rapid adjustment to fiscal<br />
policy to make a public sector contribution to national savings. If you have a<br />
savings problem as we had of that dimension, then, you can't have a gold plated<br />
infrastructure.<br />
KOB: True.<br />
PM: So, therefore, we cut our cloth accordingly.<br />
KOB: Without raising tax..<br />
PM: Now, the implication of your question is, well, maybe this will inhibit at some point<br />
national efficiency. Well, it might Kerry. It may have already, but that is the price<br />
you pay when your national income is down and your savings are not what they<br />
ought to be to cover your investments.<br />
KOB: It's also the price you pay when you continue on this path of lower taxes which both<br />
sides of politics in this country are continuing to walk down.<br />
PM: But, there's another part to this. There is another point I want to make to you and<br />
that is the Government has just now changed the tax treatment of infrastructure<br />
bonds. Now, I think, this will open up an opportunity for savings from the big public<br />
savings vehicles like the superannuation industry and particularly award<br />
superannuation to invest inP,-tfait is, optimal private sector provided public<br />
infrastructure. Now, I think, this is going to make a very large difference and you'll<br />
start seeing state governments starting to focus. I mean, you'll soon hear State<br />
Premiers and Treasurers starting to beat their chest about this project and that, it<br />
will be because of the Federal Government's policies in respect of these and<br />
tapping that great pool of savings which is now in award superannuation which, of </p>
<p>course, the Liberal Party has always opposed. That is, occupational<br />
superannuation for the workforce. A decade ago we had about $ 17 billion in super<br />
funds. We've now got over, I think, $ 330 billion and that money is looking for a<br />
home and some of it can look for a home in Australia in privately provided public<br />
infrastructure.<br />
KOB: And yet the unease continues within your own party about the levels of taxation<br />
and the levels of infrastructure that the Government should be funding and Duncan<br />
Kerr's comments, your Justice Minister, a Cabinet Minister ( sic) in Tasmania,<br />
recently underscored that yet again. Australia is now the lowest taxed country in<br />
the OECD the so called western world total revenues as a proportion of GDP<br />
were 27.8 per cent in 1986-87, they will be about 23.7 per cent in the next financial<br />
year, that means $ 16 billion decline next financial year $ 16 billion next year that<br />
you do not have. $ 5 billion more than your whole deficit. You now seem to be in a<br />
political straitjacket on taxes.<br />
PM: Yes, well, let me get the advert right, Kerry. This is a low tax government. Let me<br />
say proudly, this is a low tax government.<br />
KOB: To the point where you can<br />
PM: No, let me finish it. Lower tax than anything we have seen from the Coalition and a<br />
bit lower at the moment because of the loss of receipts coming from the recession<br />
and the impact of the recession.<br />
KOB: They'll go lower again because they are talking about various tax concessions on<br />
things like business exports and so on.<br />
PM: Who are?<br />
KOB: The Opposition.<br />
PM: Well, the Opposition has already got an $ 8 billion gap. I mean, here's Alexander<br />
Downer running around today saying " oh well, we need a tighter fiscal policy so we<br />
don't have these interest rates effects." I mean, the hide of him. And, he's out<br />
there with an $ 8 billion problem and he's been in the job three weeks. I mean, the<br />
Financial Review yesterday sketched out the $ 8 billion gap that he and Mr Costello<br />
already have.<br />
KOB: The point is<br />
PM: So, there's no point in making a reference to them. They are not going to be any<br />
help.<br />
KOB: All right, but you're both in a political straitjacket on taxes aren't you and it's a<br />
problem of your own making?<br />
PM: Look, Kerry, no, no.<br />
KOB: It's almost impossible for any political party in this country today to actually<br />
increase taxes substantially. </p>
<p>PM: Let me just make this clear to you. I believe this, that when public sector spending<br />
in the 1970s rose under Malcolm Fraser to nearly 31 per cent of GDP, under<br />
Malcolm Fraser and John Howard, and revenue rose accordingly, it dislocated<br />
private investment in this country. It dislocated employment and that's why in the<br />
first seven years after that government there was five times more employment<br />
growth than there was in the previous seven years Now, if the aim of the game is<br />
to get people into jobs and to make this place productive, principally that's got to go<br />
into private sector investment. I don't believe that a great, I mean, this sort of line<br />
which percolates around parts that are left in this country, that basically, they are<br />
now using the line ' we've got to be economically efficient, therefore, we'll go back<br />
to what we always believed having a huge, a large anyway, or a larger public<br />
sector is the way forward.'<br />
KOB: It includes people in your own Cabinet.<br />
PM: No, it does not include many people. That is the point.<br />
KOB: All right. Can we look now at industrial relations and the first big challenge that you<br />
nominated for this term of government was labour market reform. You initially<br />
pleased business and angered the unions with the goals that you and your Minister<br />
Laurie Brereton articulated. By the time your draft legislation became law, you'd<br />
made 140 amendments. The unions were happy and business was angry. Now<br />
you've made further changes, but will the package deliver the goods and how will<br />
you measure its success over the next year or so? What will your benchmarks be<br />
going to the electorate at the next election?<br />
PM: The number of private enterprise agreements. That is, the number of enterprise<br />
agreements in the private sector that are undertaken from the time the legislation<br />
was introduced until the election.<br />
KOB: Well, what about the quality of those agreements. You can wave around on a<br />
piece of paper any number of agreements, but how do you measure the quality of<br />
those agreements?<br />
PM: Well, I don't think you can just say that. I mean, here we are now talking about an<br />
$ 8 a week increase for those who can't access enterprise bargaining and we are<br />
talking about it for really, the bottom 20-25 per cent of the workforce. I mean, we<br />
are already in a position where the great bulk of the workforce is going to be<br />
adjusted by a flexible system of enterprise bargaining and award flexibility courtesy<br />
of this Government's changes with the ACTU. And, I think, as we see those<br />
proliferate and let me say, some of these State Governments that actually say " oh,<br />
hang on, our legislation is better for enterprise flexibility" look at the number<br />
already of enterprise agreements in the Federal jurisdiction under our legislation<br />
and, say, the number in Victoria or the number in New South Wales. I mean, they<br />
are infinitesimal.<br />
KOB: All right, but I come back to the quality and presumably your ultimate goal with all<br />
this is* in creased productivity. Now, labour market economists are talking about an<br />
expectation of p~ rqtuctivity in the next 12 months of something like 2 per cent.<br />
Surely your goal would have to be higher? </p>
<p>PM: But, what employment? I mean, what have we got at the moment 5 per cent GDP<br />
growth and roughly 3 per cent employment growth, or 3 and 1/ 4, so we've got 2 per<br />
cent productivity. If we want more people back in the workforce the standard<br />
measures of productivity are always going to drop, always going to drop. But,<br />
we've got a more fully employed country. So, what we want is..<br />
KOB: But, have you got a work force that is competitive, that is seeing boosts in exports<br />
PM: Well, with 1 per cent inflation I'd say that's right. With exports, despite the fact that<br />
we ye got 5 per cent growth, exports are out-pacing imports by 11.2 per cent to<br />
about 9.5 per cent. What you'll see, you made the point, will they be good<br />
agreements, if that's what you're saying?<br />
KOB: Yes.<br />
PM: Well, that's up to business isn't it? Business has been saying to the Government<br />
now for half a dozen years ' let's make the system more flexible'. And we are now<br />
saying..<br />
KOB: You say that's up to business..<br />
PM: It's up to business and their employees.<br />
KOB: You've got a report coming to you in the next couple of months from a task force<br />
which was tasked by your government with measuring the quality of Australian<br />
management. They've already issued enough interim reports for you to have a<br />
very clear picture of their views of Australian management. Their fundamental view<br />
of Australian management is that it is extremely poor, that it is archaic, that it is still<br />
operating in the 1950s, that it is too hierarchical, the quality of Australian<br />
management is poor. You're saying that you're trusting that management to deliver<br />
you quality enterprise agreements.<br />
PM: Well, so, what are you arguing?<br />
KOB: You're saying that you've got no way of measuring the quality of these agreements,<br />
it's up to management. And, yet, management, you're being told, is not good.<br />
PM: But, then I say, what are you arguing, we go back to a centralised wage fixing<br />
system?<br />
KOB: No, I'm asking you how you're going to measure, as the Government which wants<br />
to see these outcomes, how you're going to measure the quality of these<br />
agreements.<br />
PM: Kerry, look, opening this economy up, a decade ago has changed the face of<br />
Australia, including corporate Australia. The first wave of managers went very<br />
quickly.' The second wage of managers came on, tottered around the scene and<br />
the market cleaned them up. We're into the third wave now and there are some<br />
good people there. But, we will continue to take time to make this a more<br />
sophisticated management scene, in this country. But, I do believe that there is<br />
now a productivity culture out there in business where the good manager spots the </p>
<p>opportunity to lift productivity in the business and to split the higher earnings<br />
between profits and wages. Now, I think that's on and you can see it in the<br />
numbers and you can see it in the inflation rate and you can see it in the growth<br />
numbers.<br />
KOB: We are, of course, rapidly running out of time and I've got far too many things to<br />
talk about. On Telecom, I know you've said that Telecom is not on the<br />
Government's privat is ation agenda but do you also rule out beyond the next<br />
election the stripping of Telecom's non core assets? And, if, as Frank Blount, the<br />
head of Telecom says, Telecom's core business revenue is going to decline, how<br />
will Telecom fund its expansion overseas which is, presumably, the only way it can<br />
maintain its place amongst the world's major telecommunications carriers?<br />
PM: Well, as a general policy what we've done is set up a competitive environment for<br />
Telecom. We've established a second carrier Optus has now made substantial<br />
market inroads and one of the things we're doing over the next six to twelve<br />
months is looking at the future of telecommunications policy and where we go after<br />
1997 in terms of opening up. So, that's the model. The ownership of Telecom,<br />
therefore, isn't especially important other than that it's subject to the competitive<br />
disciplines of that particular competitive market place. Now, by and large that's<br />
been happening. We've seen a tremendous improvement in productivity, a very<br />
large decline in tariffs and, by and large, I think Telecom is finding it can fund itself,<br />
it's going in and it's making innovative deals around the place with various private<br />
sector organisations.<br />
KOB: So, its ownership is not important?<br />
PM: Well, I think in terms of whether you deliver better services at lower prices, what<br />
has been important is the absence of a competitive environment until the<br />
government's reforms...<br />
KOB: So, it doesn't matter if it's publicly owned or privately owned?<br />
PM: Not of its essence, no.<br />
KOB: Then why don't you sell it?<br />
PM: Well, it depends what environment the governement has chosen. The government<br />
has chosen to have Telecom in public ownership and to set up a competitive<br />
framework with a duopolist. Now, we are now considering where the duopoly goes<br />
after 1997.<br />
KOB: So, its future is a question mark?<br />
PM: Well, Telecom's future is a question mark in that environment. That is, can it be as<br />
certain of its future in that environment as it was before, say, 1990? Of course it<br />
can't. But in terms of its ownership, though, that's a different question again.<br />
KOB: So, the issue of whether this goveniment might ultimately sell off its non core assets<br />
is also an open question?<br />
PM: Oh, no, that's not an open question. I mean... </p>
<p>KOB: You would close off that option?<br />
PM: But it depends what a non core asset is. I mean, Telecom has made all sorts of<br />
corporate arrangements in the last year or two, so..<br />
KOB: Is it important for Telecom to stay together, as it is now?<br />
PM: Every last little tiny piece of it?<br />
KOB: We're not talking tiny pieces, the substantial elements?<br />
PM: No, every last piece of it? No, it's not. But, as an institution, yes.<br />
KOB: But, if it requires substantial capital funding...<br />
PM: From the Government?<br />
KOB: Capital funding per se.<br />
PM: It's not going to get it. It's not going to get it from the government.<br />
KOB: It's not going to get it from the government. Where does it get it, then?<br />
PM: No, it will be provided by Optus or somebody else. In other words, the market will<br />
fund the capital the market needs from some other source. In other words,<br />
Telecom will be able to grow at a rate where it can replenish its capital. If it can't<br />
grow quickly enough, it will be taken up by other contributors in the market place...<br />
In this case, Optus, the resellers of services and any future we've now got<br />
Dataphone in part, obviously, the capital requirements in the Australian<br />
telecommunications market are going to be taken up by other suppliers.<br />
KOB: Your comments to journalists in Paris about whether or not you've become bored<br />
-with politics, sick of the Opposition, sick of the media and so on have fan-nedspeculation<br />
that you've got an almost terminal problem of maintaining consistent<br />
interest and energy in politics. I wonder how you address that and perhaps you<br />
can tell us exactly what you did say?<br />
PM: Well, there were a dozen journalists there and only one of them took that view, so<br />
there you are.<br />
KOB: What were you saying?<br />
PM: We were in...<br />
KOB: It arose because journalists were pursuing, as I understand it, were pursuing the<br />
signals that they are hearing within the government ranks about concerns amongst<br />
some of your colleagues that you've been privately indicating to people that you<br />
are bored.<br />
PM: I've neves. privately indicated that and it never arose in that context at all. We were<br />
in the Australian Ambassador's residence and a little squad of journalists were </p>
<p>taking in the view of Paris and, of course, I got on to one of my subjects,<br />
architecture and what have you... and they, sort of, went along nicely from there.<br />
Kerry, look, I can't remember a time that has been, for me, better than recently.<br />
We won an election; the Opposition said we'd have a double dip recession and a<br />
depression; we've got five per cent economic growth; we've got one per cent<br />
inflation; we've put through a huge piece of cultural and property law with Mabo;<br />
we've now introduced a White Paper, which I think most Western governments<br />
would be proud of, to try and reform the labour market; we've made tremendous<br />
advances in our reach into Asia and also with APEC, the development of APEC<br />
which is developing further and will do in Indonesia in November this year; we've<br />
got the whole Council of Australian Governments agenda on competition policy...<br />
You know, I don't think I could have, if you had been writing the script back then in<br />
March 1993 I don't think it could have been better. And, perhaps I illustrated this<br />
best by my cracker night analogy in Brisbane recently...<br />
KOB: OK...<br />
PM: . Where I didn't think I sounded bored at all.<br />
KOB: There's a dangerous political acceptance...<br />
PM: Can I just interrupt you and say, though, that in the cracker night analogy, of<br />
course, I never even mentioned Alexander Downer, I never even gave him Tom<br />
Thumb status at the time.-<br />
KOB: Well, he snuk up on you, didn't he? There is a perception amongst some of your<br />
colleagues that you'll go some time in the next term. But, that, of course, does give<br />
the Opposition more scope their aura of instability coming up to the next election.<br />
Are you committed...<br />
PM: The Opposition developing their aura of instability? Let me just get...<br />
KOB: Are you committed to serving another full term after this one?<br />
PM: The answer is, I am. I am. But, the Opposition which has John Howard, Andrew<br />
Peacock, John Hewson, two deputy leaders, Peter Reith and the former deputy, all<br />
sitting on the front bench along with two other leaders and two fizzers, McLachlan<br />
and Bishop and they're talking about instability?<br />
KOB: Yes, but it's a new ball game with the Opposition now, isn't it? And, even though<br />
the poll figures that we've had in the past few weeks would reflect, to some extent,<br />
a honeymoon, that immediate sharp lift in their stocks and drop in yours, surely,<br />
was a strong knee jerk message from the electorate that a lot of people out there<br />
would still like to give you... They'd still like the luxury of giving you a kick in the<br />
teeth, figuratively, of course, that the only thing holding them back was their<br />
rejection of John Hewson's damaged leadership and that Alexander Downer is<br />
going to be a much tougher target for you to hit?<br />
PM: Do you really believe that, Kerry? Do you really believe that?<br />
KOB: Well, he's been doing pretty well so far. </p>
<p>13<br />
PM: Has he? I mean, he said he was for clean politics, his first utterance against me<br />
was that he wanted me to clean up my act...<br />
KOB: But this is your critique of him compared to public perception of him.<br />
PM: No, no, he jumped straight in to prostitution with MPs in Parliament and<br />
encouraged he became the Sultan of Sleaze within about two weeks. Then he<br />
said he was in favour of blocking off foreign investment in this country. Can you<br />
imagine it, with a current account deficit of $ 16 billion, with us going out to the rest<br />
of the world, he's opposed to us investing in other parts of the world. I mean, this is<br />
someone who was telling us a year earlier that we ought to open the flood gates<br />
and remove the Foreign Investment Review Board. I mean, this chap will say<br />
anything, anywhere.<br />
KOB: And you're not going to acknowledge...<br />
PM: If you think I've got a problem with that, Kerry, it's like hitting balls coming in slow<br />
motion.<br />
KOB: On the. republic, how long can you sustain the debate without saying anything new,<br />
without starting to come to grips with the substantial debate, I mean, where do you<br />
expect to take the debate between now and the next election?<br />
PM: I expect to take it to a referendum sometime between now and the year 2000,<br />
2001. That's where I said we'd take it, at the last election, that's where we will take<br />
it. And, all these people who want to run backwards there they were the other<br />
night, the monarchists, singing the song, the anthem of another country, including<br />
the leader of the National Party, God save the Queen, there he was, clinking his<br />
glass...<br />
KOB: Yes, but, this is still at the rhetoric end, isn't it? I mean, at some point you've got to<br />
develop your line on the republic to the next stage. When do you do that? How do<br />
you hold off from giving people a more substantial signal about where you want to<br />
go?<br />
PM: Well, what we're doing at the moment is considering the report which Mr Tumnbull<br />
and his committee prepared for us and for the public. We're wading through those<br />
issues and we're looking at, first of all, getting some testing of opinion and how and<br />
in what way our institutions ought to be shaped for Australia to become a republic.<br />
It will be very direct, well thought through, forensic, so don't have any doubt about<br />
that. But, again, all in good time.<br />
KOB: I'm jettisoning questions all over the place, here. Bob Hawke's book is due out in<br />
the next few months and I understand that he's already indicated semi privately that<br />
it includes material that could damage your prime ministership. I believe he<br />
recounts in the book his version of your private conversation with him after that...<br />
PM: He told Malcolm Fraser and Malcolm told me and he's told you and...<br />
KOB: . That he expects, according to Malcolm Fraser, that he expects that there will be<br />
material-n that book that will bring down your prime ministership. And, I believe,<br />
that he recounts in the book his version of that conversation that took place </p>
<p>between you and he after the famous Placido Domingo speech in which, he says,<br />
you referred to Australia as ' the arse end of the earth'. Did you say that, and if you<br />
did, what where you saying about your attitude and your commitment to Australia?<br />
PM: Kerry, I've been in public life, at the end of this year, 25 years. I've served 11 as a<br />
minister and over two as prime minister. I was amongst the group that changed<br />
Australia from the Rip van Winkle years of Menzies when Australia was shut up<br />
behind tariff barriers under do nothing Coalition governments, the government that<br />
gave Australia a future in the Asia-Pacific and has remodelled it as no one could<br />
have expected a decade ago. That's my commitment to Australia and if anybody<br />
doubts that I mean, I don't believe one can exercise that kind of energy and<br />
pride in this country and have any doubts about one's commitment to it.<br />
KOB: But, did you in that conversation refer to Australia as the arse end of the earth?<br />
PM: If Bob's got a book... Let's wait and see what his book says.<br />
KOB: The point is, if he makes that stick, if enough people in this country believe that you<br />
described Australia as the arse end of the earth do you acknowledge that that is,<br />
potentially, very damaging, politically, for you?<br />
PM: Kerry, I don't know what's in the book but I've always made it clear to my<br />
colleagues, when we're way out of the world trading milieu, away from the flux of<br />
the Northern Hemisphere, as an island continent in the South Pacific, we're always<br />
going to have to do better. I've always told them that, always.<br />
KOB: Well, we're well out of time, thanks very much for joining us.<br />
PM: Good.<br />
ends. </p>
