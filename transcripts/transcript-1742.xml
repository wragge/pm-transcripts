JAIA W<br />
PRIME MINISTER, MR. J. McE\ 7 N, MEETS WITH PRESS<br />
MR. McEVIEN: I wanted to see you yesterday, but pressure of events<br />
overtook me, so I'm seeing you now.<br />
First, I want now publicly to e-press through your media<br />
my deep regret at the loss of Mr. Holt and to say that I am sure<br />
this is a regret felt by every single Australian citizen and<br />
obviously deeply felt in much wider circles overseas.<br />
Mr. Holt, as you all knew, was a typical Australian. I<br />
think any one of us would be happy to be so described. He was at<br />
home with his fellows here in Australia and undoubtedly he was an<br />
equal with his contemporaries when he was overseas. Ae was a good man.<br />
He was a brave man. And he was a devoted man to his country. We<br />
have suffered a great loss.<br />
We extend our deep sympathy to Mrs. Holt and to the<br />
family. I have, of course, communicated this to Mrs. Holt.<br />
In thinking of her I want, in her deep distress to see<br />
that she is relieved as much as may be done of the practical problems<br />
that inevitably surround the wife of a great and distinouished man.<br />
I have told Mrs. Holt that I have directed, in view of he enormous<br />
correspondence in which she will be involved that secretarial<br />
assistance will be made available to her; tAat, at least in existing<br />
circumstances I want her to retain the use of a government car and<br />
driver-and I have told her that she should contemplate moving from<br />
the Lodge only at her om convenience.<br />
For myself, gentlemen I achieve this high office with<br />
no sense whatever of personal gratification. It's only in rare<br />
circumstances that a man could become Prime Minister and not be<br />
warmed and elated by the fact, but I am neither warmed nor elated by<br />
the circumstances that have unexpectedly precipitated me into this<br />
position. As I have already made it perfectly clear it is my<br />
intentionto hold the office only until the major party in the<br />
Coalition, the Liberal Party, shall have chosen for itself a new<br />
leader, and I will put myself at his disposal, and at the disposal<br />
of the Governor-General. I have already advised His Excellency of<br />
my attitude in this repbard and advised senior members of the Liberal<br />
Party. I've told the vernor-General it's my intention to step<br />
aside as soon as the Liberal Party has electe its leader.<br />
For the record, I want it to be quite clearly understood<br />
that I have not been commissioned by his Excellency subject'to an<br />
undertaking. His Excellency has commissioned me and I have, out<br />
of a sense of the correctness of things and my own sense of<br />
responsibility, advised him, as I have now advised you, of my<br />
intention. </p>
<p>2.<br />
I have advised His Excellency to swear in all the<br />
present Ministers in their present portfolios. I myself was<br />
re-sworn as Minister for Trade and Industry yesterday, as well as<br />
Prime Minister. Could I divert for just a couple of seconds to say<br />
there has been some co~ nment on the fact that no Liberal Ministers<br />
were present yesterday. I'm afraid this is entirely my<br />
responsibility. It had not been contemplated that any Ministers<br />
would be present at all And I just suddenly decided I would wish my<br />
Countrty Party colleagues, particularly my young men of whom I am so<br />
proud, to be present. I checked with the Dovernor-General that this<br />
would be acceptable and invited them to come along, and frankly<br />
confess I didn't give a thought to mv Liberal colleagues nor to my<br />
friend, Ceb Barnes, who was in the btilding and I didn't know.<br />
I just divert to say there's no ground for any speculation of<br />
anything in this. It is my intention in this position to adhere strictly<br />
to the policies of the Holt Government. There will be no new policy<br />
departures. On Friday the Memorial Service is arraned in Melbourne.<br />
Melbourne is itself an appropriate centre Mr. Holt s own city.<br />
Of course we contemplate Canberra, but tAere is no Anglican Church<br />
in Canberra with sufficient accommodation to hold the number of people<br />
who undoubtedly will wish to attend the Service.<br />
A number of very high-level personages will come to<br />
Australia from overseas for this occasion. Prince Charles will come.<br />
He will represent his mother, the Queen. He is the Heir to the Throne.<br />
This is a very eat gesture. Mr. Harold Wilsdn, the Prime Minister<br />
of Britain, withsufficient worries of his own, will come and<br />
Mr. Edward Heath, the Leader of the Op osition in Britain, will come.<br />
They will fly direct from London to Melbourne. It's my understanding<br />
they will arrive in Melbourne on Friday morning. We understand<br />
that their visit can only be a very short one, but I am moved I'm<br />
sure we are all moved that the Queen has so feelingly and so<br />
generously signified her owfn feelings by sending her son and Heir<br />
to the Throne to represent her. It symbolises in a most moving way<br />
the attachment of Australia to the Crown the Queen of Austra~ ia.<br />
Mr. Wilson and Mr. Heath also pay us and Mr. Holt a very<br />
reat tribute by their journey and their personal representation.<br />
s I said, they'leave Britain at a time of very great personal<br />
demands on them, and the journey is the longest of all of those who<br />
are coming; and I want to acknowledge their gesture now deeply and<br />
gratefully, and say that we will all look forward to meeting them.<br />
It is a tremendous and unprecedented gesture, I think,<br />
that the President of the United States should himself have decided<br />
instantly that he would come and show his respect for Mr. Holt and<br />
for Australia by coming personally. And this we attach tremendous<br />
importance to. </p>
<p>Mr. Holyoake, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, is<br />
coming. There are other Heads of States and high dignitaries whose<br />
names I will not attempt to enumerate now but which will be available.<br />
I just observe# gentlemen that this unprecedented<br />
journeying from all around the world to Australia is the ultimate<br />
tribute to Mr. Holt to the esteem in which he was held, and we will<br />
all recognise this.<br />
I believe myself that with the presence in Canberra ot<br />
in Melbourne of the President of the United States and Mr. Wilson,<br />
and other people we will no doubt I will myself have some<br />
conversations with thesei I have asked my Cabinet colleagues to be<br />
available in case it should be desired that there should Be a wider<br />
level of conferring. There is no thought in my mind, and I am sure<br />
no thought in the minds of any others, of what might be thought of<br />
as a conference between various people. I would expect that those<br />
who want to talk, as I myself will vant to talk,* with the dignitaries<br />
who will come here will have their conversations, but in no sense<br />
formal conferences. I believe that Mr. Holt himself would in circumstances<br />
of a similar nature, had he been involved, would himself have taken<br />
advantage of the opportunity.<br />
Yhen I spoke yesterday on the television to the nation,<br />
I spoke of various policy circumstances in which we are involved.<br />
The most serious and pressing of course, is our situation in Vietnam.<br />
And I say we will stand steadfast with our allies. We will share<br />
their efTorts and share their agony in this situation. Having said<br />
that, I now make it clear that we want peace, we will work for<br />
peace; but not for the peace of surrender to the aggressors of a<br />
small, brave free people. We will continue Mr. Ho t's work of<br />
coming to understanR the problems of all our Asian neighbours; and<br />
not less we will work to endeavour to have them understand us'<br />
to understand our willingdess to work and to help where possible,<br />
and to establish in the minds of our Asian friends and neighbours<br />
an understanding of the integrity of our own attitudes, of he<br />
Australian nation. I make it clear that in defence, our postures are<br />
entirely related to us working with like-minded people for a more<br />
stable world where all can live in peace and security and with a<br />
greater equality of living conditions.<br />
The Government will continue to work in the field of*<br />
international trade to et better and fairer trade opportunities,<br />
not only for ourselves but for others.<br />
And we will continue to devote ourselves to the policies<br />
in which Mr. Holt and myself were involved in the decisions of the<br />
last Cabinet meeting, his last Ccbinet meeting, to study the present<br />
serious problems of rural industries and proceed to devise po icies<br />
for their betterment. </p>
<p>There must be no interruption in the Australian national<br />
growth, and I will continue in whatever office I find myself to<br />
endeavour to make my contribution to the best of my ability to the<br />
securing of strong and stable government for Australia.<br />
And I conclude my statement? gentlemen, by saying I am<br />
confident in the strength of the Coalition.<br />
* 0009.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Mclven, are you prepared to say publicly, as you<br />
have apparently said privately, that you will not accept 111r. McMahon<br />
as a Prime Minister, as Leader of the Liberal Party?<br />
MR. McE VEN: Yes, I say to you that I have told Mr. McMahon that<br />
neither I nor my Country Party colleagues would be prepared to serve<br />
under him as Prime Minister. Mr. McMahon knows the reason. My<br />
senior Liberal Party colleagues not only know the reasons, but knew<br />
the reasons before Mr. Holt's death.<br />
QUESTION: Do you disclose the reasons?<br />
MR. McEWEN: No. No I will not. I had a tormenting problem for<br />
myself, knowing tha{ this was the attitude of myself and my Country<br />
Party colleagues, in deciding whether I should -isclose beTore the<br />
Liberal Party's election, at the cost of being accused of seeking to<br />
influence it? or, alternatively, not disclose my attitude and, it being<br />
what it is if Mr. McMahon were elected Leader of the Liberal Party,<br />
then undoubtedly produce a very serious national crisis by only at<br />
that time indicating that we could not work under his Prime<br />
Ministership. And T decided firmly in my mind that what I have dene<br />
is the correct course: that is? not to allow the Liberals to go to<br />
an election ignorant of the attitude of myself and my Country Party<br />
colleagues. I've said this gentlemen. We're two dais from a Memorial<br />
Service. WNe have the impending visit tomorrow of t~ e President of the<br />
United States. And I will not myself contribute any further to<br />
generating any atmosphere of controversy. I hope that you would all<br />
feel that it would be intolerable that in this atmosphere of mourning,<br />
in the atmosphere of the journey to this country of these great </p>
<p>personages, that they should find us quarrelling domestically.<br />
will answer no further questions on that subject.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. McEwen, do you expect in the immediate few weeks<br />
ahead to be making a decision on Sir Henry Bolte's tax proposals?<br />
MR. McE 7EN: Oh, well, this is a matter that will come up for<br />
Cabinet consideration. I can make no comment on that a this stage.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, the President will be in Canberra tomorrow, you say.<br />
Have you any thought of a general discussion with Cabinet with him<br />
on this thing, on the major issues that<br />
MR. McDVEN: I will, of course, meet the President on his arrival<br />
and I will consult him on his wishes. I've already said I have<br />
asked my Cabinet colleagues to hold themselves available if the<br />
President does wish that there should be discussions on that level.<br />
QUESTION: Are there any significant discussions, Sir, to which you<br />
will be inviting potential leaders of the Liberal Party to<br />
participate in Them so that they'll be kept informed?<br />
MR. McENVEN: Oh, of course of course. We have a standard of two<br />
levels of discussion of this nature. There is the level of the<br />
Cabinet'itself and the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee of the<br />
Cabinet, which I think is a committee of about seven Ministers as<br />
far as I remember in fact, Mr. Holt's appointed committee, and<br />
that would be my appointed committee.<br />
QUESTION: Because of the importance of the problems existing<br />
between Australia and Britain, will you seek discussions with<br />
Mr. Wilson while he's here?<br />
MR. McEVWEN: Again, I will of course, be meeting Mr. 7ilson on his<br />
arrival, and I would not force a discussion on Mr. Wilson, but </p>
<p>6.<br />
consult with him whether he himself would feel it would be fruitful<br />
for us to have discussions. I would be willing to do so.<br />
QUESTION ( Mr. Harold Cox)<br />
mornng? When do you go to Melbourne, Sir? Tomorrow or on Friday<br />
MR. McEVIEN: I have not quite decided that, Harold. I expect Prince<br />
Charles Mr. Wilson and-Mvr. Heath to arrive in Melbourne on Friday.<br />
I'll either go down Thursday night or early Friday morning.<br />
QUESTION: ero n Sir, would you expect to take an decisions during your<br />
Sproonthis rural industry consideration hat began with t&amp; last<br />
Cabinet?<br />
MR. McEWEN: Well, some decisions were taken at the last Cabinet and<br />
I of course, don't know with what urgency other ma~ tters will arise.<br />
TAere will be no changre of policy attitude and, if, against the<br />
policy attitude alreaay decided under Mr. Holt s Prime Ministership,<br />
some matter. comes up lor decision, no doubt we'll face it.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, have you decided yet when you'll call your first<br />
regular meeting of the Cabinet?<br />
MR. McEWEN: No, I haven't.<br />
QUESTION: Stanope? Where will you spend Christmas, Sir in Melbourne or<br />
MR. McEWJiET: I don't know. I think probably Canberra.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, I don't want to press you on this in view of what<br />
y ou ye said already but would the Country Party take any objection<br />
to any other Liberal Leader, Sir?<br />
MR. McEWEN: No N. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Mr. McEwen there has been a suggestion from, among<br />
others Senator Turnbull that the Liberal Party should ask you<br />
to continue in office. Would you be agreeable to doing so?<br />
MR. McEWEN: I'm afraid I'm not responsible for Senator Turnbull.<br />
QUESTION: You wouldn't be agreeable even if asked to, Sir?<br />
MR. McFEN: I don't answer hypothetical questions.<br />
QUESTION: Before your commission, Sir, it seemed that the position<br />
on shipping freights had reached a rather critical stage. Now<br />
we seem to put the Government in suspense for three weeks. Is this<br />
going to affect what you hoped to achieve on shipping freights?<br />
MR. McEWEN: Now don't be under any apprehension that the Government<br />
is in suspense for three weeks. The Government is as existent'-t<br />
today as ever E Government has been. If any matter of urgency and<br />
importance arises we'll face it and deal with it.<br />
QUESTION: Is this sufficiently urgent to be dealt with in the<br />
immediate future?<br />
MR. McEWEN: I think that the present issue on shipping freights can<br />
be handled probably at my own Departmental level.<br />
QUESTION: WVill you give a normal New Year message, do you think?<br />
MR. McETEN: I've had too many other thoughts on my mind. Yes, I'll<br />
give consideration to that.<br />
Thank you, gentlemen.<br />
Canberra, December, 1967. </p>
