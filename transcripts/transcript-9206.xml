PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, 600 LORIMER STREET, PORT MELBOURNE, MONDAY,<br />
2 MAY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, what sort of indication can Australia<br />
PM: Well, the White Paper which I will be introducing for the Government<br />
this week is one of the biggest things the Government will have<br />
undertaken in ten, going on eleven years. I might say it will do as I<br />
said we would do on election eve and that is not forget the<br />
unemployed; that is leave an arm out to pull them up with the rest of us<br />
so the recovery will be capable of being enjoyed by all Australians. Its<br />
principal features will be a commitment to the long-term unemployed,<br />
but it has many facets and another will be a commitment to the young<br />
people of Australia; a guarantee that they are trained for work and that<br />
the years of 15-19 are regarded as a period of vocational preparation.<br />
Other features will be an involvement, a capacity for greater<br />
involvement of the regions of this country in the national economy and<br />
further reforms to industry policy which will carry the reforms of the<br />
past decade even further.<br />
The White Paper is something that our opponents could neither<br />
conceive of nor deliver and it will paint very starkly the difference in<br />
social and economic policy of the government and its comprehension<br />
and the paucity of ideas and views on the conservative side of<br />
Australian politics.<br />
J: Will next weeks Budget contain any further incentives?<br />
PM: The Budget will consolidate the White Paper and will contain other<br />
changes, but they will be changes not related to the principal things<br />
the White Paper is focussed upon.<br />
J: What form will your commitment to long-term unemployed take? </p>
<p>PM: You will have to wait for them I think, but as you know we have had a<br />
green paper which we commissioned after the election that has<br />
reported. We then had consultations on the Green Paper, we've taken<br />
notice of those consultations; there has been a huge investment of<br />
ministerial work in this statement. As I say, it is one of the biggest<br />
things that we have done and I am quite sure you would be flat out<br />
finding the government of any other developed economy committing<br />
the ministerial and bureaucratic time that this has taken to produce.<br />
J: Do you think business will welcome it, that they will be happy with it?<br />
PM: We are not going to have the complement to the labour market from<br />
migration that we had in the last cycle. We cut the immigration intake<br />
a few years ago and as companies see their markets pick up as is the<br />
case here at this plant General Motors as companies start to grow<br />
and rehire labour they'll want to find a source of skilled and trained<br />
labour. We believe the best place that can come is from the pool of<br />
unemployed and particularly the pool of those long-term unemployed.<br />
J: What's your response to an internal DEET survey that is critical of<br />
labour market programs?<br />
PM: Well, this is a complete overhaul of labour market programs and will<br />
have a completely new framework for the delivery of labour market<br />
programs in the White Paper.<br />
J: So, is it possible this Budget and this statement together could be a<br />
good precursor to go to the polls early?<br />
PM: No the Liberals, they are that spooked these days. I mean, today's<br />
poIs again show the Government would clearly win an election<br />
except the Saulwick poll, but I contend that is mostly wrong. But, if you<br />
go to the Newspoll, Morgan, all the others, the Government is clearly<br />
in a strong position and it is simply because it has got the energy and<br />
the ideas. If there's one word will emerge or one observation will<br />
emerge from the reading of the White Paper document it will be<br />
energy. The enormous energy which the Government has committed<br />
to this task. And that I is why I believe that in recognition of that the<br />
energy and commitment and inclusiveness which the Government<br />
brings to the job of Government and policy making, I believe the<br />
Government is doing well in the polls. But that doesn't mean to say<br />
because we've got the drop on the Coalition that this is the time to<br />
leave off the tiller of Government. This is a time to push the changes<br />
home.<br />
J: Do you care to make a comment on Ayrton Senna's death today?<br />
PM: I didn't know about it, I've only just found out. I find that very sad<br />
because I think this fellow was a great champion. One of the great<br />
drivers of the post-War years, but of course participating in a very </p>
<p>dangerous sport. I think everybody who is in it understands that, but a<br />
champion is a champion and all of us are saddened when we see them<br />
go.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: That was the different times for post-War reconstruction. This is for<br />
the changes to an externally orientated economy that Ben Chifley<br />
wouldn't have conceived of in those years. That is, the level of<br />
sophistication in the Australian economy today as evidenced by what's<br />
happening here at General Motors and the paper which reflects the<br />
kind of economy and society we have, has the degree of<br />
sophistication, I think, Ben Chifley would have been very proud of had<br />
he been in a position of reading this White Paper.<br />
