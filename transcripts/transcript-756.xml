FOR PRESS P. M. No. 49/ 1963<br />
GRBY BY-EIECTION<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt, Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Grey has been regarded as a Labour stronghold,<br />
Even since the general election of 1961, many voters have<br />
been added to the roll in the industrial centres like Whyalla.<br />
In 1961, Labour had an absolute majority of 7,000 over the<br />
Liberal and DoL. Po candidates combined.<br />
We threw ourselves into the by-election campaign,<br />
hoping to reduce the absolute majority to 3 000 a result<br />
which would have shown considerable movement it party support.<br />
By the time the campaign finished, I found myself hoping<br />
that the absolute majority might fall to 2,000. Mr. Dyason<br />
was easily the best candidate in the field and making obvious<br />
headway. On the voting so far, it seems clear that the<br />
Labour absolate majority will fall to under 2,000, and this<br />
in a by-election. By-elections have a long history of<br />
tending to go against the Government in power.<br />
I notice that Mr. Calwell is whistling hard as<br />
he pretends to enjoy what he himself would call a Pyrrhic<br />
victory. So far as the votes have been counted, the byelection<br />
has given great encouragement to the Government,<br />
