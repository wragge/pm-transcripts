PRIME MINISTER CANBERRA<br />
To participants at the Longreach meeting<br />
Following the Hgh Court' s decision in the Wik case, the Federal<br />
Government has worked in liaison with State and Terrtory Governmnents<br />
and other interest groups, including the NEF, to put together a legislativ<br />
response to the difficulties created by that decision. A copy of the key<br />
elements of our plan is attached.<br />
The Coal ition Government is committed to providing certainty for primary<br />
producers. The following elements of the Government's package should<br />
be noted:<br />
9 Farmers and graziers will have the right to carry on all primary<br />
production activities without needing to deal with native title<br />
claimants. Indigenous people will not have any right to negotiate in<br />
relation to prunary production activities and decisions pursuant to, or<br />
incidental to, primary production-<br />
In relation to pastoral leases which confer exclusive possession, and in<br />
relation to agricultural leases where exclusive possession must have<br />
been intended because of the-nature of the use, there will be<br />
confirmation of full extinguishment of native title.<br />
* Access rights to pastoral leases for indigenous people who have not<br />
had their native title claims determined will only be available where<br />
they can demonstrate that they have current physical access<br />
arrangements with the pastoralist. le. we will respect the existing<br />
relationships whiuch have been established between pastoralists and<br />
indigenous people. </p>

Where native title is proven to exist on pastoral leases, States and<br />
Territories will be able to compulsorily acquire these rights under their<br />
general compulsory acquisition legislation, and pay compensation to<br />
determined native title holders.<br />
The Federal Government will provide 75% of any compensation in<br />
respect of the acquisition of any native title rights. The States and<br />
Territories will provide the balance of 25%. This will apply in respect<br />
of compensation for past and future actions. Pastoralists will not have<br />
to pay any compensation.<br />
Legal aid will be more readily available for pastoralist respondents to<br />
native title claims.<br />
The proper management and control of water by Federal, State and<br />
local goverments for the benefit of all Australians will be put beyond<br />
doubt. There will be a sunset clause legislated after which no new clains can<br />
be made under the Commonwealth's Native Title Act.<br />
The Government will undertake a comprehensive programme to develop<br />
and implement its approach, and will work towards the passage of<br />
legislation through the Parliament as quickly as possible.<br />
The Government's proposals will provide the certainty to pastoralists with<br />
regard to primary production which is absolutely necessary in the national<br />
interest. Yours sincerely<br />
Howard) Tim Fischer MP </p>

KEY LEGISLATIVE ELEMENTS OF THE PACKAGE<br />
1. Validaton of<br />
acts/ grants between<br />
1/ 11/ 94 and 23112196<br />
2. Confirmation of<br />
extinguishment of<br />
native title on<br />
6exclusive' tenures<br />
1 3. Provision of<br />
government services<br />
4. Native title and<br />
pastoral leases Legislative action will be taken to ensure that the validity of any acts<br />
or grants made in relation to non-vacant crown land in the period<br />
between passage of the Native Title Act and the Wik decision is put<br />
beyond doubt,<br />
States and Terrtories would be able to confirm that ' exclusive'<br />
tenures such as freehold, residential, commercial and public works<br />
in existence on or before 1 January 1994 extinguish native ble.<br />
Agricultural leases would also be covered to the extent that it can<br />
reasonably be said that by reason of the grant or the nature of the<br />
permitted use of the land, exclusive possession must have been<br />
intended. Any current or former pastoral lease conferring exclusive<br />
possession would also be included.<br />
Impediments to the provision of government services in relation to<br />
land on which native titde may exist would be removed.-<br />
As provided in the Wik decision, native title rights over current or<br />
former pastoral leases and any agricultural leases not covered<br />
under 2 above would be permanently extinguished to the extent that<br />
those rights are inconsistent with those of the pastoralist<br />
All activities pursuant to, or incidental to, ' primary production" would<br />
be allowed on pastoral leases ( ie the right to negotiate in relation to<br />
such activities would be completely removed), including farmstay<br />
tourism, even if native title exists, provided the dominant purpose of<br />
the use of the land is primary production. However, future<br />
government action such as the upgrading of title to perpetual or<br />
' exclusive' leases or freehold, would necessitate the acquisitor; of<br />
any native title rights proven to exist and the application of the<br />
regime described in 7 below ( except where this is unnecessary<br />
because the pastoralist has an existing legally enforceable right to<br />
upgrade). Where registered claimants can demonstrate that they currently<br />
have physical access to pastoral lease land, their continued access<br />
wRi be legislatively confirmed until the native title claim Is<br />
determined. This would not affect existing access rights established<br />
by state or territory legislation.<br />
For mining on vacant crown land there would be a higher<br />
registration test for claimants seeking the right to negotiate, no<br />
negotiations on exploraton, and only one right to negotiate per<br />
project As currently provided in the NTA, states and territories<br />
IThis will be based on the defnition in the Income Tax .4ssessment Act 1936, a copy of which is atached.<br />

7. Future government<br />
and commercial<br />
development On vacant crown land outside towns and cities there would be a<br />
higher registration test to access the right to negotiate, but the<br />
right to -negotiate would be removed in relation to the acquisition<br />
of native title rights for third parties for the purpose of<br />
government-type infrastructure. As currently provided in the<br />
NTA, states and territories would be able to put in place<br />
alternative regimes with similar right to negotiate provisions.<br />
For compulsory acquisition of native title rights on other ' nonexclusive'<br />
tenures such as current or former pastoral leasehold<br />
land and national parks, the right to negotiate would continue to<br />
apply in a state or territory unless and until that state or territory<br />
provided a statutory regime acceptable to the Commonwealth<br />
which included procedural rights at least equivalent to other<br />
parties with an interest in the land the holder of the pastoral<br />
lease) and compensation which can take account of the nature of<br />
co-existing native title rights ( where they are proven to exist).<br />
* The right to negotiate would be removed in relation to the<br />
acquisition of land for third parties-in towns and cities, although<br />
native title holders would gain the same procedural and<br />
compensation rights as other landholders.<br />
* Future actions for the management of any existing national park<br />
or forest reserve would be allowed.<br />
* A regime to authorise activities such as the taking of timber or<br />
gravel on pastoral leases, would be provided.<br />
The ability of governments to regulate and manage surface and<br />
subsurface water, off-shore resources and airspace, and the rights<br />
of those with Interests under any such regulatory or management<br />
regime would be put beyond doubt<br />
In relation to new and existing native title claims, there would be a<br />
higher registration test to access the right to negotiate,<br />
amendments to speed up handling of claims, and measures to<br />
encourage the States to manage claims within their own systems.<br />
A sunset clause within which new claims would have to be made<br />
would be introduced.<br />

would be able to put in place alternative regimes with similar right<br />
to negotiate provisions.<br />
For mining on other ' non-exclusive' tenures such as current or<br />
former pastoral leasehold land and national parks, the right to<br />
negotiate would continue to apply in a state or teritory unless<br />
and until that state or territory provided a statutory regime<br />
acceptable to the Commonwealth which included procedural<br />
rights at least equivalent to other parties with an interest in the<br />
land the holder of the pastoral lease) and compensation<br />
