SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. R. G.<br />
MENZIES, AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY, 16TH JNE 16o<br />
This is a proud day for mae. To one who has had a<br />
great deal to do with the recent expansion of Universities in<br />
Australia, and who is himself an Australian Graduate, an honour<br />
accorded by this famous foundation means more than can be<br />
readily expressed. To the political leader of the Australian nation it<br />
means even more. For on this day the most powelful country in<br />
the world offers a courtesy, so to speak, to another country,<br />
weak in numbers but strong in will, whose future is bound up<br />
with yours, the body of whose intellectual and spiritual character<br />
is part of a common inheritance.<br />
You have honoured me by asking me to speak. I would<br />
not wish to acknowledge that honour by offering you the common--<br />
places of that escapist piety of sentiment which characterises<br />
most after-dinner oratory. I shall not say that " we are<br />
cousins" because, for the most part, we most certainly are not;<br />
we get on much too well. I shall not say that we have the same<br />
kind of parliamentary democracy, because we have not; we in<br />
Australia live in a constant blur of good-natured bewilderment<br />
at some of the " oddities" of your own constitutional processes.<br />
But of course we do have great things in common; so<br />
great that if we avoid insanity in the English-speaking world,<br />
we shall always be friends and allies, To preserve this friendship,<br />
we are to face up to our tasks, accept our responsibilit~ cs<br />
with some favour or affection, no doubt, but without fear.<br />
Today, fear is our greatest enemy. So far, a century<br />
of the most brilliant scientific achievement, of growi ng political<br />
consciousness, and of material advancement, has been marred<br />
by fear, suspicion, and actual hatred, to a degree without<br />
modern precedent. Many have developed a fear of life and of its problems.<br />
so that the psychiatrists flourish like the green bay tree, Many<br />
of us have learned to fear our own unruly impulses and -the individuality<br />
which is our divine gift, and therefore seek the<br />
protection of conformity. If we seek to " Keep up with the<br />
Joneses", it is mostly because we want to be like the Joneses<br />
and avoid the accusation of being odd, or different, or conspicuous.<br />
' 4e fear to be unpopular. WIh en we do something we<br />
regard as generous or helpful, we are dismayed to find so muCh<br />
ingratitude. On quite a few occasions I have been asked by<br />
prominent Americans why the superb American International generosity<br />
of recent years has so frequently been received with such<br />
covert resentment or open hostility. My reply has always been<br />
that the world power of the British in the 19th century may well<br />
have inspired respect, but certainly did not purchase populariti-y.<br />
Power exacts its own reactions. Friendship cannot be bought,<br />
and great powor, however benevolently exercised, will always<br />
produce puzzling resentmentL-s. " Why should this rich nation have<br />
more than we have?".<br />
doe are frequently invited to fear the poten~ tial eneray-<br />
In destructive technology, we find him so clever, and forget<br />
that in the constructive sciences the contribution of thie free<br />
world is so much greater than his.<br />
ile rejoice in power, but we sometimes fear and misunderstand<br />
the responsibilities it brings. We are tempted to<br />
withdraw into ourselves to enjoy the fruits of our own labours,<br />
and to let the re3st of he world go by.<br />
This brings me to the point I wish to make today,. </p>

Tennyson, no so dernode among the young, once wrote a<br />
few lines which have been much misunderstood<br />
" We sa iled wheirever ships could sail,<br />
Je founded many a mighty state;<br />
Pray God our greatness may not fail<br />
For craven fear of being great!"<br />
This was no imperialist tub-thumping. It was brilliantly perceptive.<br />
It saw clearly that greatness imposes responsibilities:<br />
that power which is merely enjoyed is a menace, but that power<br />
with responsibility can be the salvation of the world.<br />
The great free powers are on trnlt today: none more<br />
so than the greatest of them, the United States of America. The<br />
way in which they survive this trial will depend upon how they<br />
rise to the splendid but awful responsibilities of power: how<br />
bravely they guard the inner liberties of man: how utterly they<br />
cast out fear: how clearly their light shines before men: how<br />
far they keep the feeling of adventure, and avoid the defensiveness<br />
of riches. A desire f~ or power seems natural in mankind. Among<br />
politicians it is thought to be endemic. But the great men and<br />
the great nations are those who, having achieved it, do not<br />
weakly recoil from it, afraid of leadership, or rejoice in power<br />
for its own sake and for the precarious comforts it brings.<br />
The twentieth century, which might so woll have been<br />
the golden century of civilisation, has been bedevilled by the<br />
lovers of power without responsibility. 4o do not denounce the<br />
infamous memory of Hitler because he g ained and exercised power.<br />
Much greater men than he gained and exercised power to defeat and<br />
destroy him. Hitler is infamous, as are the other malevolent<br />
dictators of our time, because with all his power he had no<br />
smallest sense of responsibility for the true g7ood of men and<br />
women. He obtained power, and became a monster.<br />
Today, the communist threat is the result of another<br />
and terrible misconception or denial of the duties of power. If<br />
the men who come and g7o as the controllers of the destiny of the<br />
Soviet Union were content to pursue their philosophy in their own<br />
land because they believed that their system, so alien to us,<br />
was the one to give peace and security and social justice and<br />
happiness to their own people, we might well wonder, but we<br />
would stand aside, on the principle of " live and let live", But<br />
when we see them as an aggressive force, aiming at the bending of<br />
hundreds of millions of free people to their own will, we know<br />
that we are again seeing the search for power without rospohsibility.<br />
The answer to power without responsibility is not power<br />
simpliciter, though some people are prepared to rest there. '! Get<br />
toug i" has an appeal, particularly if the slogan-makers can<br />
stigmatise those who would wish to negotiate as " appeasers". In<br />
a world such as we live in, power is essential, but it is not all.<br />
The truth, self-evident though it may be, is that the only answer<br />
to power witiaout responsibility is power with responsibility.<br />
It is not sufficient to say that tL-his is the truth. As<br />
usual, it is necessary to say what it moans.<br />
It is a matter of famous record that in this place<br />
George Marshall announced the groatest and most gonorous aid plan<br />
in history. But greater even than its generosity uas its intelligence.<br />
It was only a great power that could g7ive great aid<br />
to others, But the diving of that aid was an ackno,, wledgment of<br />
the responsibility that goes with power; a rusponsibility based<br />
upon an understanding of international facts and the true foundations<br />
of peace. </p>

Here we have g reat scope for the imagination. ' vie know<br />
that, on our side, the greatest of all wars was fought for<br />
freedom, 3ut this did not havc a purely selfish connotation.<br />
It did not mean freedom for those who alrcady enjoyed it; for<br />
Americans and British and Frenchman and Australians. It meant<br />
freedom for all mon, including those hundreds of millions in<br />
countries moving towards independence, for whom self-government<br />
is thne greatest of all adventures. vlhen you in your great way,<br />
and we in our small, tax yourselves and ourselves to help new<br />
nations, we are not just being more or less comfortably generous,<br />
and feeling -ood about it. Wde are rocognising. the one-ness of<br />
humanity, and the profound responsibilities of power and of<br />
possessions. It is not philanthropy, but wisdom, to accept the<br />
task of guiding and helping other nations and people, so that<br />
they may acquire not only the institutions of freedom, but,<br />
much more importantly, those rising standards of living and of<br />
thaought without n rhich free institutions will wither and decay.<br />
True, we may properly admit that we -rish to restrain the expansive<br />
move of communian. To this end, as in the case of SEATO we<br />
enter into military engagements and make military preparations.<br />
But these will fail unless, in those new nations which stand at<br />
risk, economic growth is stimulated, the development of the<br />
individual is pursued, and the communist powers find themselves<br />
increasingly confronted by communities resolved to accept no<br />
slavery of the mind.<br />
In the performance of our responsibilities, there is<br />
no time to be lost. Since 1945~ the hitherto little-known new<br />
world moves rapidly to a series of now nationhoods, Lor.-I at<br />
Africa, until recently a nest of colonies, where a score of new<br />
nations are coming to birth. Are we to be just kind to them,<br />
giving to them that which we feel we can comfortably afford, the<br />
" crumbs from the rich man's table", or will we see in their<br />
(: mergence a great challenge to the wisdom of western civilisation?<br />
Is there not a wise-self-interest to serve, not a narrow selfishness<br />
for self-protection, but a self-interest based upon the<br />
understanding that our own freedom is dependent upon the freedom<br />
of others: that we cannot havc peace and prosperity for ourselves<br />
alone? May I venture to remind you of one of the great economic<br />
phenomena of our time? It is that, nationally speaking, the<br />
gap between the ' haves" and the " have nets" is becoming greater.<br />
I believe that this is not true inside of our boundaries,<br />
where social responsibilities, e-xpressed in terms of schemes of<br />
social welfare and social justice, have led to a narrowing of<br />
the gap between riches and poverty. High and graduated taxatioi<br />
is, within reasonable limits and subject to legitimate grumbling,<br />
accepted. More and more, in our own place, we carry the burden<br />
of being our brother's keeper.<br />
But internationally, this, in spite of great efforts,<br />
is not by any means true, 4oe live in an ago of amazing technological<br />
groi.-th. Aided by the most superb technical skill, the<br />
great industrial countries make progre ss in an almost geometrical<br />
fashion. The luxury of yesterday becomes the mass-produced<br />
commonplace of tomorrow. And so, nationally speaking, and in<br />
the words of the old song, " 1the, rich get richier",. But what of<br />
the new nations, the relatively poor nations, with sketchy or<br />
primitive industries, with little technical skill and with, as<br />
yet, small facilities for increasing it? At best, their rate of<br />
material improvement is arithmetical, not geometric. So far from<br />
catching up they are, in relative terms, falling behind.<br />
This consideration, quite clear as it seems to me,<br />
must give us all furiously to think. In face of it, we cannot<br />
rationally decide to do less; we must do all that we can, even<br />
though it means we do a little less for ourselves, " Charity<br />
begins at home" is a cynical proverb, and, in this w,. orld, a<br />
false one. </p>
<p>I never come into the United States without feeling<br />
something of the pulse and drama of your strength and growth.<br />
Your resources are so boundless, your productive skill so boundless,<br />
your optimism ( that great driving forcc) so all-pervasive.<br />
Moro than any other country in the world yucould, in an economic<br />
sense, live to and by yourselves. Lnd yet your high destiny<br />
is to use your strength to ive light and leading and encouragement<br />
to the world. The measure of how you fulfil that destiny<br />
will be the measure of your greatness. You have accepted the<br />
greatest responsibilities in htuman history. In this famous<br />
place, the father ( or mother) of so many who have served in<br />
high places and have, in high or humble places, given leadership<br />
in the fields of the mind and the spirit, may I pray that year<br />
by year there will be more and more of your graduates who will<br />
persuade their follow-citizens, not only here but around the<br />
world, that, just as rights are less significant thaan duties, so<br />
is strength admirable only for the responsibilities it accepts<br />
and discharges. The free world and that gre at area of the world which<br />
longs to be free, look oyou with gratitude, but also with hope.<br />
It is an honour to be enrolled in your brotherhood, and a rare<br />
privilege to speak, not so much for myself, as for Australia,<br />
your young but determined friend. </p>
