JO lALZST: Your response to Andrew Peacock's statement<br />
that Peter Shack won't be Health Minister in a Peacock<br />
Government, if there is a Peacock Government.<br />
PX: Well it's a great abdication of leadership. There<br />
was Mr Peacock making the noises himself last year about<br />
the fact that the health policy was prepared and fully<br />
costed and all the details done. He vanted to have the<br />
glory then ot announcing these things and now that the<br />
promises that he made then have been revealed as a<br />
baseless misrepresentation. He's trying to sacrifice Xr<br />
Shack. The responsibility in leadership stops on the<br />
leadar's desk.<br />
ends<br />
