MR XCLACHLAN'S RESIGNATION<br />
The Member for Barker has paid the appropriate price for his<br />
gross impropriety. His actions reflected at best a failure<br />
to comprehend the culture and rights of Australian<br />
Aboriginal people, at worst a cynical disregard for them.<br />
The attempts to escape the implications of his actions in<br />
Parliament, beginning with his attack on the Minister for<br />
Aboriginal Affairs, only compounded his offence.<br />
Kv Howard can take no credit in this matter. He showed no<br />
more understanding of the significance of the stolen<br />
documents than Mr McLachlan did in using them so offensively<br />
in Parliament and elsewhere.<br />
His press release and letter to Mr McLachlan indicate that<br />
he still has not grasped the nature of the offence. In both<br />
he refers only to the " political sensitivity" of the matter,<br />
as if the hurt and offence it has caused Aboriginal people<br />
are of no consequence.<br />
It would be reasonable to conclude that while the member for<br />
Barker has run on his sword, neither he nor his leader<br />
understand the implications of the impropriety, and<br />
Australians particularly Aboriginal Australians could be<br />
forgiven for asking if the Coalition itself has any<br />
understanding of them.<br />
