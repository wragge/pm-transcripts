STATEMENT BY PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER<br />
FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ON DEPARTURE FOR VTSIT<br />
TO PAPUA NEW GUINEA AND INDONESIA<br />
The Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs,<br />
Mr Whitlan, said in Canberra today that he hoped his first visits<br />
to Papua New guinea and Indonesia as Prime Minister would serve to<br />
emphasise his Government's commitment to the evolution of a secure,<br />
united and friendly Papua New Guinea and to the consolidation and<br />
further strengthening of Australia's vital relationship with its<br />
nearest and largest neighbour, Indonesia.<br />
In a statement on his departure from Australia today,<br />
Mr Whitlam said that in Papua New Guinea he would be having talks<br />
with the Chief Minister, Mr Michael S'omare, and other Ministers.<br />
He would also visit Goroka where he would have discussions with the<br />
local council and attend the Goroka show.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the visit to Indonesia would be<br />
his eighth visit to that country, although his first since becoming<br />
Prime Minister. Mr Whitlam said that in Jakarta he was looking<br />
forward to frank and substantive personal exchanges of views with<br />
President Soeharto and with a number of other Ministers including<br />
the Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry, and the Minister<br />
for Foreign Affairs. While in Indonesia he would also address the </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Indonesian Parliament.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that since President Soeharto had<br />
visited Australia and his predecessor had visited Indonesia last<br />
year, the situations in the Asian region had undergone important<br />
changes. New Governments had come to office in Australia and<br />
New Zealand, a ceasefire was now operating in Viet-Nam, and<br />
active consideration was now being given to regional co-operation<br />
by the countries of South-East Asia and by Australia and New<br />
Zealand. Moreover, Indonesia and Australia had both recently<br />
become members of the Security Council.<br />
It would therefore be timely for him to discuss with<br />
President Soeharto and Indonesian Ministers both the new approach<br />
of his government to international affairs and the changed situation<br />
in the Asian region.<br />
Mr Whitlam added that Indonesia was the fifth most<br />
populous nation in the world and the only country with which<br />
Australia shared a boundary. A soundly based, close and lasting<br />
Australian-Indonesian relationship was therefore of paramount<br />
importance to both countries, now and in the future. He hoped<br />
his visit would contribute to the strengthening of this<br />
-relationship. Mr and Mrs Whitlam will be accompanied to Papua New<br />
Guinea by the Minister for External Territories, Mr Morrison,<br />
and Mrs Morrison, and to both Papua New Guinea and Indonesia by<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Sir Richard and Lady Kirby, Miss Cathy Whitlam and Mr Bruce<br />
Grant, and members of the Prime Minister's personal staff.<br />
Officials accompanying the Prime Minister are, from<br />
the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Secretary,<br />
Sir John Bunting, and Mr M. J. Wilson; and from the Department<br />
of Foreign Affairs, the Deputy Secretary, Mr K. C. O. Shann, and<br />
Mr R. A. Woolcott. The Prime Minister is expected to return to Australia<br />
on Sunday, 25 February. </p>
