FOR PRESS: P. Mlv. No. 46/ 1969<br />
REDUCTION IN U. S. FORCES IN VIETNAM<br />
Statement by the_ Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton C j<br />
It is necessary to draw a distinction between Ameni LIB<br />
force reductions made possible by an increase in size and fighting<br />
capacity of the South Vietnamese forces, and force reductions by both<br />
sides as a result of agreement with the North Vietnamese. We are now<br />
dealing only with the first of these.<br />
The United States decision to withdraw twenty-five<br />
thousand of the half million men they have in Vietnam was foreshadowed<br />
as a possibility in my report to the House of Representatives on 15 May<br />
this year. I then pointed out that if this happened it should be<br />
interpreted as a sign of strength because it would mean that the South<br />
Vietnamese had so strengthened their own forces that they could remove<br />
from the United States some of the heavy burden which that country has<br />
borne. I pointed out also that it would be a tragic mistake for<br />
North Vietnam, or anyone else, to interpret such a move as a prelude<br />
to a general withdrawal or any retreat by the United States from their<br />
determination to persevere until the attainment of the objec~ ive of the<br />
right of self-determination by the people of South Vietnam. I believe<br />
both these observations remain true.<br />
We must continue to hope for a peaceful settlement along<br />
the lines suggested by President Nixon's eight-point plan, and an opportuni<br />
opportunity for the South Vietnamese people freely to determine the kind<br />
of Government they want.<br />
It may be urged that Australia should at once also reduce<br />
its forces. I believe that would be a wrong thing to do. For one thing<br />
the Americans have greatly increased their forces since our contingent<br />
was committed and for another it would be a shabby thing, the Americans<br />
having built up the South Vietnamese forces to take some of the burden<br />
now borne by half a million Americans, for us to withdraw our own forces<br />
and to that degree impose a further burden or at least to that degree<br />
prevent a lessening of the burden borne by the United States.<br />
