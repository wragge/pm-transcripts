SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ASIA-PACIFIC PARLIAMENTARY FORUM<br />
CANBERRA 10 DECEMBER 1991<br />
I am very pleased that you have chosen Australia for the<br />
second preparatory meeting of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary<br />
Forum. It is fitting that you are meeting in our new<br />
national Parliament House, in our national capital. Both<br />
capital and building are symbolic of Australia's commitment<br />
to parliamentary democracy.<br />
The development of relations between our region's<br />
parliaments and parliamentarians, in my view, is crucial to<br />
the process of breaking down barriers between nations and of<br />
promoting mutual understanding and respect.<br />
As we approach the 21st century, it is vital for nations in<br />
the Asia-Pacific region to learn more of each others<br />
political values and systems, and to understand better the<br />
cultural bases from which they derive.<br />
I commend the organisers of this Forum for their initiative<br />
and farsightedness in bringing together such a distinguished<br />
group of parliamentarians.<br />
The parliamentary system, as instituted in one form or<br />
another by all countries represented here today, is<br />
essential not only for the enhancement of representative and<br />
participatory government, but for the promotion and<br />
preservation of political liberty itself.<br />
In the last few years, the world has witnessed a fundamental<br />
transformation of political life. Many countries are<br />
discovering or re-discovering the virtues and the benefits<br />
of representative government. Systems that have denied the<br />
importance or relevance of parliamentary institutions are<br />
slowly, or, in some cases dramatically, failing.<br />
Authoritarian and totalitarian systems in Europe, Africa,<br />
Latin America, and our own region are learning the art of<br />
give and take, and of that necessary compromise essential to<br />
a representative parliamentary system.<br />

<p>It is this philosophy of compromise which is the hallmark of<br />
limited government, the hallmark of a state where liberty is<br />
paramount. In this context, the establishment of the Asia-Pacific<br />
Parliamentary Forum is an important and positive step. it<br />
is a recognition that the region is becoming a major<br />
political and economic grouping of countries alongside<br />
Europe and the Americas.<br />
It is a recognition also that the increasing intensity of<br />
trade and investment in the region has political and social<br />
implications which demand the attention of legislators.<br />
The challenge for all of us is to improve the quality of<br />
life of our peoples, to create conditions conducive to<br />
growth and prosperity, and to maintain and enhance the<br />
security and stability of the region.<br />
The Forum provides us with an ideal opportunity to discuss<br />
and exchange information on the common challenges and<br />
problems which are confronting us all.<br />
Speaking for Australia', no element of our international<br />
policy over the coming years will be more important than<br />
maintaining and increasing the momentum of our growing<br />
enmeshmnent in the Asia-Pacific region. Our policies are<br />
geared towards this end, and the results are plain. In the<br />
economic area, fully 35 per cent of our total trade is now<br />
with North East Asia, and 8.7 per cent with South East Asia,<br />
while 55 per cent of our exports are bought by the countries<br />
of North East and South East Asia. This compares with 49<br />
per cent five years ago.<br />
By the end of the century, given the economic and political<br />
developments that are taking place, well over half of our<br />
trade will be with the region.<br />
Central to refocusing our regional perspective is the Asia-<br />
Pacific Economic Co-operation ( APEC) process. Initiated in<br />
Seoul in 1989, and carried forward over three ministerial<br />
meetings since then, it aims to promote a broad ranging<br />
regional dialogue which identifies and advances common<br />
economic interests.<br />
APEC is not designed to be an exclusive trading bloc, but<br />
rather a grouping which promotes the liberalisation of trade<br />
in the region. APEC provides a collective voice in broader<br />
forums such as the GATT negotiations, and a voice that<br />
speaks with authority. APEC provides a clear and practical<br />
example of an open and non-discriminatory trading system.<br />
In the political and security area, the end of the cold war,<br />
the increasing influence of multilateral institutions such<br />
as the United Nations, and the growth of international cooperation<br />
on a wide variety of issues, provides us now with<br />
an unprecedented opportunity to build a prosperous, just and<br />
secure Asia-Pacific region. : iTIT </p>
<p>3.<br />
The peace process in Cambodia, the gradual liberalisation<br />
taking place in Vietnam, Japan's development of a political<br />
role more in keeping with her economic importance; these<br />
developments and others are all positive steps leading<br />
towards regional stability and co-operation.<br />
The Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum will, I am sure,<br />
develop to become an integral part of these processes of<br />
integration and development with the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
I have, therefore, much pleasure in opening the second<br />
preparatory meeting of the Forum and I wish you well in your<br />
deliberations. I1 o </p>
