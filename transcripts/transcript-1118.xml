PR~ ESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE RT. HO5N. SIR ROBER~ T MENZIES AT P-ARLIAMEN<br />
HOUSE. CANEERRA. AT 3 P. M. ON 3RLD JUNE, 196i<br />
PRIME MINISTER You will have a few questions, gentlemen but~<br />
perhaps I ought to say something about the Premiers' Conference<br />
and the Loan Council because there may be a few things there<br />
that need a little clarifying. If you start with the revenue<br />
grants, under the arrangement that we ultimately worked out',.<br />
the position is this that in the current year t~ ie figure is<br />
calculated at œ C34+ O7M. and that will, under the arrangements<br />
we have now made, rise on the same assumptions. That is to<br />
say, on the basis that population increase and average wages<br />
increase resembles the period that is just concluded the<br />
last five years that would rise it is estimatqd,<br />
to œ 51OM. in 1969/ 70. That means that unless extraordinary<br />
circumstances arise and if they do these figures might well<br />
be increased the position would be expected to be that the<br />
payments to the States will rise each year over the preceding<br />
year by ( I will leave out the fractions for simplicity) œ 35M4.<br />
in 1965/ 6, by f29.9 ( call it œ P3014.) in 1966/ 7, by œ 32M. in<br />
1967/ 8, by œ E34M. in 1968/ 9, and by œ 371. in 1969/ 70.<br />
Now thle point to be remembered about this is<br />
that there are virtues from a State point of view in having a<br />
five-year term I think the last one was six, but this time<br />
we proposed five and that was ultimately agreed to. That means<br />
that over that period of five years, the States can plan ahead,<br />
knowing with some precision what they will be getting, year by<br />
year. I don't need to point out to you that the Commonwealth<br />
has no such assurance itself. Steeply rising defence expenditure,<br />
for example, which goes up in 1965/ 6 by something of the<br />
order of œ C80M., to œ C90M4. will, of course, put heavy burdens on<br />
the Budget, Any shortfall on the Loan market to meet the<br />
programme of works that was agreed on will of course involve<br />
burdens on the Budget. A good deal of delence expenaiture will<br />
be in the works field. That will add to the existing pressure:-<br />
on resources of men and materials pressure wi ch already is<br />
leading to bidding-up for scarce labour, particularly in the<br />
skilled field where there is a considerable shortage. Therefore<br />
the Commonwealth is left and I don't complain about this<br />
with problems affecting its normal expenditures and its fiscal<br />
policy and its defence policy which are all difficult but<br />
which we will have to cope with from year to year. f think it<br />
is worthwhile emphasising that because the position of the<br />
States has a measure of stability and assurance that our own<br />
position couldnft hope to have.<br />
As to the amounts, what we ivrre aiming at was<br />
to get a five years' agreement, This I think is very important<br />
for the reasons that I have just mentioned the States<br />
themselves like to know where they are, and I have had a lot<br />
of experience in these meetings now, going over many years, and<br />
each time there has been a discussion either about a period<br />
agreement or before that, from year to year there has been a<br />
little bit of what might be politely called bargaining. There<br />
is no novelty about it. Somebody finally says, " Yes I would<br />
like another quarter of a million, another half a million,"<br />
and everybody goes into the corner, and out comes the quartermillion<br />
or the half-million,<br />
Any addendum to what has been proposed, mark<br />
you, comes out of our Budget, not out of any other safe. And<br />
./ 2 </p>
<p>this has been done. For example in 1959, ( 1 wasn't here, I<br />
was out of the country but the current agreement just expiring<br />
was then worked out anA agreement was finally arrived at) the<br />
State of New South Wales and I think there was another State,<br />
received some extra grant. New South Wales secured a million<br />
on that occasion, This was part of the price of the securing<br />
of an agreement. Nobody complains about that, Nobody thinks<br />
it is extraordinary. I suppose it has affected every State from<br />
time to time over my period.<br />
This time Mr. Bolte didn't find himself able to<br />
agree to the five years' proposition. Mr. Askin had put up a<br />
proposal which modified the one that I had put and modified it<br />
in a way that was satisfactory to us and that secured the agreement<br />
of five States but Mr. Bolte wasn't able to agree to it<br />
and he made an argument which was worth consideration. He<br />
pointed out that when the 1959 agreement was made ultimately<br />
concluded New South Wales having obtained on that occasion the<br />
extra million, the difference in the per capita grant to his<br />
State, as compared with New South Wales was I think I am right<br />
in saying 9/ 7d,, but the precise figure doesn't matter. What<br />
he did point out was that by the effluxion of time and circumstances<br />
that gap had risen by so that the differential<br />
today was 13/ 7 don't hold me to the 9/ 7, but the difference<br />
was And we considered this because we were very anxious<br />
to get an agreement. If we didn't then one State at any rate<br />
would come up next year and say, " We want to reopen this<br />
argument. We are not bound by any agreement." Well that is<br />
no good to any of us. We do want to have some certainty over<br />
a period of years and so we had a look at it and decided that<br />
we could meet this position by giving an extra payment to Victoriaby<br />
the Commonwealth, not at the expense of any other State an<br />
extra payment which would reduce the gap by and therefore<br />
leave it as it was in 1959. We thought this was an equitable<br />
thing to do. I went in and stated this to the Premiers and<br />
Mr. Bolte said that under these circumstances he would be<br />
prepared to become a party to the agreement, so that in the<br />
result we have a five years' arrangement with all the States at<br />
the expense of what I think amounted to about œ-600,000 a year to<br />
Victoria. So that there is no novelty about this and really<br />
I can't see that there is any particular grievance, If' I ha<br />
been proposing to reduce what was going to another State, under<br />
provisions to which they had all agreed at that stage( they had<br />
all agreed), if I had said, " Well, I want to subtract something<br />
from you who have agreed, in order to secure an agreement by<br />
Victoria, that would have been something of a grievance. I<br />
didn't. I said, " We loave all your allocation untouched, the<br />
ones to which you have agreed, and we will add this out of our<br />
own funds in the case of Victoria." Well, I don't need to<br />
elaborate that. Those of you who have been familiar with<br />
Premiers' Conferences over a number of years will not be<br />
unfamiliar with these procedures and will not use offeasive<br />
words about them because they are quite normal.<br />
On the borrowing programme, we put forward a<br />
proposal which we ultimately modified, and that was that we<br />
decided that instead of holding the amount of the Loan Works<br />
Programme as it was last year, which obviously would involve the<br />
doing of a little less work because costs have risen, we decided<br />
to increase our proposal by œ C514. and this was accepted by all the<br />
States. This means, for example, that in the case of New South<br />
Wales, which I think has roughly 4+ 0 per cent., this might be<br />
oo .6 / 3<br />
2 -r </p>
<p>3<br />
worth œ 2M, But anyhow, the borrowing programme was increased by<br />
There was a proposa put up by New South Wales that it<br />
should be given, in the semi-government field, on which we were<br />
proposing a standstill, the right to get for the Grain<br />
Elevators Board, Of course that relates to wheat storage and<br />
is therefore of great significance. We at once indicated that<br />
we would support that. So that was added to the semi-government<br />
programme that we had indicated.<br />
There was another matter discussed in the Premiers'<br />
Conference that is perhaps worth a little explanation and that is<br />
this business of off-shore oil and gas. This is becoming an<br />
interesting topic because of the discovery of gas cff the<br />
Victorian coast and various enterprises have been seeking for and<br />
obtaining permits to search in these areas and the question, of<br />
course, inevitably has arisen between the 6ommonwealth and the<br />
States as to who has the jurisdiction. The States say that<br />
within the territorial limits which, being old-fashioned, we<br />
can call within the three-mile limit they have the sole jurisdiction.<br />
We dontt agree with that as a matter of law but we<br />
on the other hand assert that outside territorial limis and on<br />
the continental shelf which has a total area about twenty times<br />
the size of the terriiorial waters, the jurisdiction belongs to<br />
the Commonwealth. Now obviously you couldn't go on forever having a<br />
wrangle about Constitutional power because this becomes a rather<br />
important matter, People want to get on with the job and they<br />
want to know where they stand. So our proposal was that the<br />
Commonwealth and the States should agree to set up what I will<br />
call a joint operation on this matter, the actual administrative<br />
work being done in the States Mines Departments, under which we<br />
wouldn't argue about Constitutional power, but we would each<br />
reserve our Constitutional rights but we would agree that there<br />
should be a commnon administration, whether it was inside<br />
territorial waters or further out on the Continental shelf.<br />
The proposal that we had put before at Ministers' meetings was<br />
that under these circumstances if these became productive, if<br />
production was achieved, royalties should be shared fifty-fifty<br />
by the Commonwealth and the particular State off wuhose shores<br />
the find was made. That hadn't strictly been agreed to but we<br />
thought there was a chance it would be.<br />
There was another question left open. It is rather<br />
interesting, W! hen they grant permits to explore and the man gets<br />
one of these permits, when he explores and finds, then he has<br />
a particular area assigned to him which he can develop and that<br />
leaves all the other portions of the area ready for re-allocation.<br />
In the United States in particular this has become quite a<br />
valuable right in the government because oil or gas having been<br />
found, the remaining sections in the area are more valuable and<br />
people pay for them* We had originally, at the Ministers'<br />
meeting said that any proceeds of these sales should be divided<br />
fifty-fifty. When we met the other day, I said I had got the<br />
Cabinet to have a look at this and we were perfectly happy to<br />
adopt the attitude that if that happened the State itself would<br />
take the whole of the proceeds. We would make no claim to any<br />
proceeds on this reallocation but that we should have fiftyfifty<br />
on the royalties, production having come in. The States<br />
will aJ~ so, I may add, get the proceeds of licence fees that are<br />
paid. The one matter on which we come in is in the matter of<br />
royalties. Wlell, this offer was within a few minutes accepted<br />
by the States. This clarified the whole of the argument and<br />
4 0 0 e a </p>
<p>we anticipate now that agreements can be concluded and executed<br />
in the next few weeks. I urged the importance of time because<br />
you can't get enterprises to spend large sums of money unless<br />
they know they have some sort of title, some sort of protection,<br />
and they are not going to be caught up in an argument as to<br />
who is the landlord, as I might say. Well that is cleared up,<br />
That was a very useful matter,<br />
I think that is all I want to say by way of<br />
clarification on the Premiers. There is just one other thing<br />
I have just been reminded of. I am going away as you know and<br />
Mr. Hasluck will be away very shortly. Senator Gorton will<br />
be away leading one of these teams, and Mr. McEwen has agreed<br />
to act as Minister for External Affairs during our absence.<br />
Well now, any questions?<br />
QUESTION Have you thought Sir whether you will hold a<br />
Referendum later or earlier Lhan ihe six months? period?<br />
P. M. I haven't really worked that out. We will<br />
obviously have to present our measures In the Budget Session<br />
which I imagine will mean a referendum in the earlier part<br />
of next year.<br />
Q. Can you have it as late as that, Sir? Musn't it<br />
be not more than six months?<br />
P. M. Yes, it must, It depends on when it goes through.<br />
I mean, if we were able to bring it on early in the Budget<br />
Session*,*.<br />
Q4 I thought you put the Bill through last week.<br />
P. M. Oh1, no, In fact I am glad you mentioned that<br />
because it ought to be made clear that we have not yet<br />
drafted the amendment. There have been one or two points<br />
raised that we are considering, particularly on the aboriginal<br />
side. When we settle those matters and we present a bill,<br />
or bills whatever it may be, then of course the whole matter<br />
will be debated in the House, and we will have an eye on the<br />
timetable, because there is a limit within which you can put<br />
them, and we will have to observe that. But that will be to<br />
a large extent controlled by when we can bring it in and how<br />
long the Parliamentary debate can last.<br />
Q. It doesn't look like this year then, Sir?<br />
P. M. Well, look, don't hold me to it. I would have<br />
thought probably not. But it will certainly not be later than<br />
the earlier part of next year. It might be this year.<br />
I don't know,<br />
Q0 Sir Robert, can you give us an outline of the<br />
scope of the talks you propose having in Washington and<br />
London?<br />
P. M. I don't think I can. My experience of talks with<br />
the Heads of Government and so on is that you start off by<br />
saying, " This is what I am going to say." You end up by not<br />
saying it. You have to approach these talks in a rather more<br />
flexible manner than that. It is quite clear that in the<br />
United States I will have some talks about the financial<br />
position vis-a-vis Australia, the new rule. There may be one<br />
or two aspects of commodities that I may have to have some<br />
talks about. I am not clear yet, but I will be, and I have no<br />
*# eee. </p>
<p>P. M. doubt that the position in South-East Asia will also be very<br />
( Contd.) closely discussed. But you can never be dogmatic in advance<br />
about those things. The main thing is to go in knowing quite<br />
clearly in your own mind all the things that you would like<br />
to achieve if you could. Man proposes but Presidents<br />
dispose<br />
Q0 You expressed some sympathy the other day, Sir, at<br />
closer ties with New Zealand. Do you intend raising that<br />
with Mr. Holyoake?<br />
P. M. Oh, I don't know. That will no doubt crop up in<br />
London. But we have certain matters under examinationrow<br />
about exchanges of Members of Parliament and so on and I<br />
think it unlikely that I will be discussing the question of<br />
some trade arrangement sometimes falsely called a free<br />
trade area or something of the kind because that is a matter<br />
which is under most competent handling on behalf of the<br />
Government by the Minister for Trade. If I thought that<br />
had to be discussed in London I would have wanted to take<br />
him there. I am not anticipating that in London we will have<br />
any substantial trade discussions at all.<br />
Q. In his letter to you, the President invited you<br />
to raise at any time any specific American investment measures<br />
that were hurting Australia. Do you have any specific cases<br />
in mind to raise with him?<br />
I don't think so. I may tell you that I have been<br />
armed with a brief. It is here on the table and I will read<br />
it before I leave.<br />
Q. In London, Sir Robert, do you intend to see Mr.<br />
Callaghan and Mr. Brown as well as the Prime Minister?<br />
P. M. W4ell, it is the usual thing. I would expect to.<br />
Qo Mr. Holt has indicated that he feels perhaps the<br />
English situation, as far as the economy goes, is more<br />
important to Australia's immediate future than the American<br />
capital curb position.<br />
P. M. look, it is very hard to say much about that because<br />
I think I saw that there was some modification announced only<br />
in the last twenty-four hours. I'll catch up with those in<br />
London. I always do see the Chancellor of the Exchequer,<br />
whoever he may be, and Mr. Brown occupies a new and rather<br />
powerful position on the economic side. There is no doubt<br />
I will be seeing him. In fact I will be very surprised if<br />
both of them dontt participate on oacasions in the Prime<br />
Ministers! Conference meetings. Quite the usual thing.<br />
Q. Have you got a short list to take to The Queen on<br />
another matter, Sir?<br />
P. M. No. And if I had, I wouldn't announce it. Look,<br />
I'm gald you riased this matter. There is a great misconception<br />
about this business. Some chuckle-headed fellow in<br />
some English paper announced that we had been hawking this<br />
job around. I said something about this in the House. This<br />
is utter drivel. Even " The London Times" has got some<br />
nonsense that I have just been reading somewhere. This is<br />
not how it happens. I am a bit of a stickler on this<br />
business. I don't approach anybody until I have had a talk<br />
to The Queen. The Queen's position has to be respected in<br />
/ 6 </p>
<p>6-<br />
this matter. The Governor-General is her personal representative<br />
in this country, among other things, and I have in the<br />
past alw~ ays had a talk with her. We have discussed names.<br />
We have discussed qualifications. We have had an intimate<br />
talk about these matters, and in the long run I get to an<br />
agreement on this matter and it is then only that I say,<br />
" Well, now, I have Your Majesty's approval to approach Mr. X.<br />
or whoever it may be" l and that is the first time that anybody<br />
is ever approached at all. I have stuck to that rule this<br />
time, You can take it quite positively nobody has had the<br />
faintest approach made to him. I would regard that as a gross<br />
discourtesy.<br />
Q. Has the Cabinet any collective view on the question<br />
of whether it should be an Australian or a non-Australian,<br />
Sir?<br />
POM&amp; I think if the Cabinet has a view on anything, it<br />
will say so,<br />
Qo Well, may I ask you. Would you say so on behalf<br />
P. M. INo, I am not prepared to discuss that, Nor indeed<br />
are you to assume that I have some prejudice on that matter,<br />
because I haven't. I have never adopted the attitude that<br />
an Australian is excluded. I think we have produced as<br />
good a percentage of people of consequence in this country as<br />
any other country that I know, so that that question of<br />
prejudice is to be put on one side. I am only prejudiced<br />
against one thing and that is against me being Governor-<br />
General. ( Laughter)<br />
Q. Sir Robert~ will you be having any discussions in<br />
London about a possible visit by the Queen Mother next year?<br />
The South Australian Government have extended an invitation<br />
to her.<br />
P. M. Look, that matter will be dealt with at the<br />
appropriate time. You ask the Lord ivisyor of Adelaide that one,<br />
Q, It has been announced.<br />
P. M. Oh, 7 has it? Oh, well that's fine. Usually these<br />
matters are announced from the Palace. Anyhow I am not<br />
announcing anything. Anid after all if an invitation does<br />
go, it goes from me. It doesn't go from anybody else. I<br />
would remind you of that. I am announcing nothing.<br />
Q. Have you any engagements in Europe, Sir, or are<br />
your calls entirely in America and Britain?<br />
P. M. No, I will be in America for a few days Washington,<br />
New York for a couple of days. I aim at arriving in London<br />
about four days before the Conference begins in order to have<br />
the necessary preliminary talks and work and I think I will<br />
have to remain in London for a few days three or four days<br />
perhaps after the Conference ends, but I will then come home.<br />
Q41 That will bring you here early in July, won't it?<br />
P. M. Yes I think somewhere about the 9th I'm not sure<br />
what it is, Mu I have to be back in time to have these<br />
conferences that we have with the people in the industrial<br />
and trades union field and so on, and then we go on into<br />
our Budget discussions which I think will probably begin<br />
about the middle of July, so I can't be back much after the<br />
8th or 9th. / 7 </p>
<p>Q Sir, there is a vacancy in Cabinet at the moment.<br />
Can you say if this is to be filled in the near future?<br />
I expect it will be filled shortly after my retur'n.<br />
I noticed a fantastic story about this. Poor John McEvwer<br />
and I are always having a brawl about something, I gather,<br />
and we are having one about the Cabinet vacancy. Now this<br />
is just utter nonsense. When Harrie Wade died, the vacancy<br />
was filled by a Country Party Minister because the Country<br />
Party has its proportion in the Cabinet itself, and John<br />
McEwen and I had a talk about it at that time and I said,<br />
" Well, we needn't worry because the vacancy will be filled<br />
by the promotion of a Country Party Minister.~ There is no<br />
argument about that, otherwise you would be down to two in<br />
the Cabinet." t There has never been any argument about that<br />
at all. Then, both being of Scots derivation, we decided<br />
that we wouldn't rush into deciding who the one to be<br />
promoted should be because they are all fairly new. ' 4e<br />
would like to have a look-see, and we are having a look-see.<br />
Wie were reminding each other of it the other night, There<br />
is no argument about it. It will be a Country Party Minister.<br />
That's never been in doubt and McEwen and I hope we will have<br />
our judgment matured sufficiently by a little time after my<br />
return to come to a conclusion about it. It won't at any<br />
stage give rise to any differences of opinion,<br />
Q* Sir, is there any difference betueen you as to which<br />
Country Party Minister it should be?<br />
P. M. We haven't discussed that yet, I think I told you.<br />
We said we would wait so we could form our own opinion. I am<br />
not aware of any difference for the very good reason that we<br />
haventt discussed it, All we have done is to agree I<br />
confirmed it the other night having read a piece of nonsense<br />
in some paper that we would have to come to a conclusion<br />
on this before very long. I don't expect there will be any<br />
argument about it at all. I know the field but I don't know<br />
who the choice will be and I venture to think neither does<br />
he yet,<br />
Q. On the subject of arguments, Sir, Mr, McEwen has<br />
announced that he and Mr. Wheeler are deadlocked on the question<br />
of the secondary industry section in trade. Do you propose<br />
to break that deadlock?<br />
P. M. The position is that the Public Service Board has the<br />
authority to deal with promotions of this kind and we have<br />
decided that the Public Service Board's authority must be<br />
preserved. If a Cabinet began to give orders to the Public<br />
Service Board contrary to its own judgment on a matter of<br />
internal administration like that then you could say goodbye<br />
to the independence of the Civil Lervice and introduce<br />
political control, and the Cabinet believed that that is<br />
wrong, and therefore this is a matter, like all matters of<br />
this kind which has to be worked out between the Trade Department<br />
people and the Public Service Board. Every Department<br />
does this from time to time. At present they are not in a<br />
state of agreement but I hope they will be in due course because<br />
I think it is important that it should go ahead.<br />
Q. Sir, can you say anything about the replies from the<br />
companies that you wrote to about American investment in<br />
Australia? 09s a. / 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
P. M. No, except to say that we had replies from I think<br />
practically all of them and that they have without exception<br />
been very helpful and I have written to each of them and<br />
acknowledged that and the result of all this is under analysis<br />
in the Treasury.<br />
Q. The Treasury White Paper mentioned the replies last<br />
week, Sir.<br />
P. 14, Yes, well I don't propose, of course, nor would you<br />
ask me to say what these replies were. These replies are<br />
all made to us confidentially. We are asking about the<br />
particular activities of particular companies and what their<br />
plans are and all this, when I wrote I made it quite clear,<br />
would be regarded as confidential as far as they are<br />
concerned. We may draw certain general conclusions but it<br />
would never do to indicate the business of some particular<br />
company.<br />
Q* Can you say anything about the general conclusions<br />
to be drawn, Sir?<br />
P. 14. No, I can't. As I said, these matters are being<br />
analysed by the Treasury.<br />
QO Is there any way of ensuring that legislation gets<br />
more orderly and les8 hurried consideration than it had at the<br />
end of the last Parliamentary Session, Sir?<br />
P. M. I don't think there was anything unique about the<br />
end of the last Parliamentary Session. I have been in<br />
Parliament for thirty-six years or something and it has always<br />
been the same.<br />
Q9 Isn't it about time it was changed, Sir?<br />
P. M. Well, I said that thirty-six years ago. You know,<br />
you musn't underestimate the difficulties of this business.<br />
Our position in this place is really quite peculiar because<br />
we have these two Sassions in a year. I remember in the old<br />
days in Victoria the Sessions began in July. You had the<br />
whole of the six months to work out legislative proposals and<br />
for the draftsmen to do their work. We are rather short of<br />
dgroaodf tsdmreanft. s meDnr, a ftansdm enb eacraeu sen oto f toth eb e fapcict kethd ato fyfo ue vhearvye btuhseh,<br />
Autumn Session and then the Budget Session, we live 1r ~ je<br />
most constant pressure of Cabinet meetings and Cabiidtt e4ings.<br />
I was asking the other day for a few facts on that. It might<br />
amuse you to know that in this Parliamentary Session just<br />
ended,, taking that period from 16th February well, I start<br />
on 16h February. Parliament opened a little after that;<br />
we have had 25 Cabinet meetings we have had Cabinet meetings<br />
on 25 days, and in the course of those days, we have had 4+ Q<br />
sessions of Cabinet because we frequently meet at night when<br />
the House is sitting. The General Administrative Committee<br />
which is the other section of the Cabinet met about eight<br />
times, the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee met approximately<br />
half a dozen times, the Legislative Committee about a<br />
dozen times, and other Committees about fifteen times, I<br />
think it almost a record. Now all this involves constant<br />
pressure, and I quite agree with you, if we were living in a<br />
perfect world, we would hold up the meeting of Parliament<br />
until we had had all these meetings and discussed all these<br />
things and got a lot of precise instructions to the draftsmen.<br />

P. M. I think there would be a great deal of resentment if we held<br />
( Contd.) up the sitting of Parliament while all that went on, though<br />
no doubt it would contribute very powerfully to avoiding<br />
a last-moment rush. But you know, we musn't pretend to be<br />
too superior about these things. dhen you were a student,<br />
I bet you did more work in the last month of the year than<br />
you did in the whole of the previous eleven put together.<br />
Otherwise you were a remarkable exception.<br />
Q. Sir Robert, Mr. Brand has said that he has received<br />
a letter from you on the standard gauge rail project,<br />
P. M. Yes..<br />
Q. i wonder whether in those circumstances you would<br />
be prepared to releas4 the text of the letter.<br />
POM. No, no, I am not.<br />
Q. Alternatively, would you say something about the<br />
matters that are giving the Commonwealth some concern?<br />
P. M. No, I won't. I have sent a long and detailed letter<br />
to the Premier of Wjest Australia. I am not in the habit of<br />
publishing my letters to Premiers, particularly when they are<br />
on complex matters. I will get an answer in due course.<br />
W~ hether the matter will then be publishable or not, I don't<br />
know, but not now.<br />
Q. Sir Robert, you will have read last week that the<br />
Federal A. L. P. executives severely censured Senator Kennelly<br />
and Mr. Hawke for having put forward a proposal for making<br />
a deal with the D. L. P. Have you any comments to make?<br />
Pemel No, I don't like interfering in the neighbours'<br />
quarrel. Good luck to them whoever they are,<br />
Q. Sir, the Australian Government's note to the Soviet<br />
Union said the sending of an Australian battalion to South<br />
Vietnam was in no way contrary to international law. it<br />
didn't mention the SEATO treaty. Is there any reason for<br />
that?<br />
P. M. No. The SEATO treaty is part of our international<br />
law.<br />
Q. Sir, can you give any estimate on when the Government<br />
might be considering architect-s' submissions for the new<br />
Parliament building?<br />
P. M. Oh dear no. Oh, now, come. Didn't you know that<br />
I am proposing to set up a committee not to discuss the<br />
plan of the building but to discover what ought to be in<br />
it, what the requirements are, including the requirements of<br />
the Press, including the requirements of Private Members,<br />
including the requirements of Ministers, including the<br />
requirements of the staff, the Library all the things.<br />
You nan't start talking about architects or designs until<br />
you have determined what it is that is to be in the new<br />
building.<br />
Q. When do you think that will be determined? * 000060*/ 10 </p>
<p>10<br />
P. M. ' dell you are asking me about the speed with which<br />
a committee will act. 4e won't debate the setting up of the<br />
committee until we resume. I would think that it might<br />
very well take the better part of a year because it is a<br />
very complex matter. There are a lot of unsatisfactory<br />
things about a building like this, as you know and as I<br />
know. When we get to the stage of building a new Parliament<br />
House we will need to look to the future a bit, we will need<br />
to anticipate that there will be some expansion in due'course,<br />
as there must be in the numbers in Parliament as the<br />
population goes up, and there are a few things that have to<br />
be made quite clear. There ought to be some section, for<br />
exarple, in a new Parliment House which is the executive<br />
wing which is controlled by the Cabinet itself so that you<br />
don't have to go to the Speaker and say, " Please may I have<br />
a room, I am appointing a Minister." That ought to be<br />
a separate matter. But it must have, of course, easy and<br />
immediate access to the House. The accommodation for Private<br />
Members is really quite inadequate and I don't venture to<br />
speak for you but I would think that you have found that<br />
the Press accommodation in this building, with its p lacing<br />
and all that kind of thing, most unsatisfactory. All these<br />
things must be worked out properly so that when the Committee<br />
reports and its report is adopted that this is what the new<br />
building should contain, then you get to the stage of<br />
discussing how you are going to go about it, whether you are<br />
going to have a competition, an architectural competition<br />
with sails on the roof ( Laughter) or, you So the<br />
architects can remain a little easy on this aspect for a little<br />
time to come.<br />
QQ Have you noticed where Mr. Calwell and Mr. Wentworth<br />
seem to have joined forces in being angry over what they call<br />
the predetermination of the site?<br />
P. M. I am aware of that but I still believe that a great<br />
majority of the people on both sides of the House prefer the<br />
site which was announced seven years ago. I think so. It<br />
wouldn't be uncommon to find individuals disagreeing, naming<br />
no names.<br />
Q6 Do you think you will get the cost within the Opera<br />
House budget?<br />
P.. e -Jell, by Jove, I hope for less than that, yes. But<br />
you never I haven't a clue.<br />
Q. Sir Robert, could I ask you something about Jashington.<br />
When you go there, it has been suggested that perhaps<br />
Australia's economic intelligence out of Washington has not<br />
been what it might have been and perhaps we were warned a<br />
little too late of the American proposals in regard to the<br />
capital curbs and also both Mr. McEwen and Mr. Holt referred<br />
to the work of the American labbies in lead and zinc and sugar<br />
and wool. Will you be looking at this aspect of Australia's<br />
operations in Washington with the idea of enlivening it?<br />
P. M. If there is any defect in that field, I will no doubt<br />
discover it. I don't know. I have no predetermination on<br />
that matter. It may be, of course, that the President, like<br />
one or two other political leaders that I know of, makes hiown<br />
announcements Znd doesntt give notice of them a fortnight<br />
ahead. That's not uncommon.<br />
Sir Robert, do you plan to lead the Government at the<br />
next election?<br />
P. M. I dc. n't know. I don't know anything about my future.<br />
I have got to the stage where I do not ask to see the distant<br />
scene one step enough for me and the next step unfortunately<br />
is into the aeroplane to go on another of these journeys. </p>
