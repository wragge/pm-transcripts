I am pleased to announce that Dr Edward Fenech-Adami, Prime Minister of Malta, will be making an official visit to Canberra from 19 to 22 August, accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister Dr Lawrence Gonzi.  In addition to visiting Canberra, he will also travel to Sydney and Melbourne, meeting a wide cross-section of the Maltese community.<br />
Australia has a close friendship with Malta.  The Maltese community in Australia is the largest outside Malta, making a valuable contribution to our life as a nation.  Malta';s assistance to Australian troops in both world wars and our shared membership of the Commonwealth - in which we are both members of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group - reinforce these community ties.<br />
It will be a pleasure to welcome Dr Fenech-Adami to Australia so soon after the Coolum CHOGM meeting he attended earlier in the year.  Updating our bilateral social security arrangements will be one important topic in our discussions on 21 August, which I expect to cover a wide range of bilateral, regional and global issues.  </p>
