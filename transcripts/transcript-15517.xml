    <content><![CDATA[<p>Further to my announcement yesterday, I am pleased to advise that Commonwealth and state officials have identified a range of Australian expertise to be offered to Greek authorities to assist current firefighting operations in Greece.</p>
<p>The Australian expertise being offered includes two bushfire management officers (a high-level incident controller and a senior operations officer), a bushfire investigation officer, a forest fire behaviour expert and an aviation management expert.</p>
<p>Australian officials will work closely with Greek authorities to ensure Australia provides the most appropriate and useful support possible.</p>
<p>The thoughts of the Australian Government and all Australians remain with the people of Greece at this difficult time.</p>
