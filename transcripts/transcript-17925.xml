of Today we offer our most heartfelt thoughts to the family and friends of Lance Corporal Andrew Jones, following the news of the death of his killer.</p>
<p>Nothing can take away the grief that they carry but this is small measure of justice for his loss of life. The nation is thinking of you today.</p>
<p>Twenty-five year old Lance Corporal Jones' life was taken when he was tragically shot and killed at a Combat Outpost in the Chora Valley region on Monday 30 May 2011.</p>
<p>He will be remembered by his colleagues and the rest of the nation as a fine soldier and an excellent cook.</p>
<p>We know that both the Australian and Afghan soldiers working side by side in Uruzgan Province have been shocked and saddened by this incident.  </p>
<p>They have been as anxious as the rest of the nation, and while there is no joy in the death of Shafied Ullah, we hope this brings some resolution at this difficult time.</p>
<p>Australia remains committed to its mission of training the 4th Afghan National Army to take the lead for security in Uruzgan Province. </p>
