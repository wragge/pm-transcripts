FOCR PRESS: F. M. No. 29/ 1968<br />
P. M. G0. MOITOR DMiVRS' DispuTE,<br />
Stat~ menv by* the Prime Minti6tek followifng talks with Wi. Monk<br />
The Governknent expressed the view that the previous return<br />
to work of the APWU drivers was the result of an agreement which<br />
called for the placing of a case before thia Public Service Board, speedy<br />
hearing and decision on that case by the Public Service Board, and, in'<br />
the event of disagreement, subsequent arbitration.<br />
The Government had facilitated a speedy hearing and discussion<br />
by the Public Service Board, It understood that conferences had been<br />
held before the arbitrator, and that the Board was prepared now and<br />
had been for some time to proceed to a public hearing of the case<br />
before the arbitrator.<br />
The Government pointed out that It could not itself enter the<br />
area of wage fixing since this was done, In the event of disagreement<br />
between the Public Service Board and a public service union by the<br />
system of arbitration established by law.<br />
It hoped that this system of arbitration would be used and would<br />
ask the Public Service Board, as a party to the dispute, to ask the<br />
arbitrator to nominate dates for such public hearings as a matter of<br />
urgency. C2ANBER RA<br />
