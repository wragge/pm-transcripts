Prime Minister Julia Gillard today welcomed the appointment of George Wright as National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party.</p>
<p>George was elected unanimously by the National Executive this morning.</p>
<p>George brings with him a wealth of experience in the business sector, as a Federal Government adviser and as a senior official at the ACTU.</p>
<p>He has a proven track record as an effective campaigner, having run the Your Rights at Work campaign in 2006 and 2007, and has a long and demonstrated commitment to the Labor Party and its values.</p>
<p>George is well regarded by all sections of our Party and will ensure that Labor's 2013 election campaign draws on the best possible talent from across the community.</p>
<p>He will do a fantastic job building our Party base and prosecuting our case for key reforms such as tackling climate change, rolling out the National Broadband Network and building opportunity through education and participation.</p>
<p>We are a Party that strives to shape the future and George Wright, with the support of the Assistant National Secretary Nick Martin and the National Executive, will be instrumental to our cause. </p>
