    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the Opposition's offer must look more attractive</p>
<p>   to a GST surely to the battlers?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think every battler in Australia has got to ask himself or herself</p>
<p>   what would be the use of a personal tax cut from the Labor Party</p>
<p>   if it were more than eaten up in higher interest rates. And one</p>
<p>   of the indisputable facts, and this is not rhetoric, is that my</p>
<p>   Government has been the Party that has delivered the lowest housing</p>
<p>   interest rates this country has seen for 30 years. Mr Beazley had</p>
<p>   13 years. Housing interest rates went to 17% under his government,</p>
<p>   20.5% for small business. Under my Government, housing interest</p>
<p>   rates have fallen to the tune of $300 a month off the repayments</p>
<p>   for an average loan, and that is the equivalent of a pay rise of</p>
<p>   $100 a week for the average wage and salary earner. So, let me say</p>
<p>   right at the beginning to the taxpayers of Australia, a tax cut</p>
<p>   more than eaten up with an interest rate rise, and if Mr Beazley</p>
<p>   were to win the next election, interest rates would go up again.</p>
<p>   I mean, that's the biggest risk for the average Australian</p>
<p>   about a future Labor Government. This is not political assertion</p>
<p>   and rhetoric, this is fact. When we took over, interest rates were</p>
<p>   at this Himalayan level and over the last two-and-a-quarter years,</p>
<p>   they've fallen in the way that I've described.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But he's pledged to keep the Budget in the black and he's</p>
<p>   said that this measure will do everything....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>He said the Budget was in the black before the last election. I</p>
<p>   mean, you've got to look at what people do in Government, not</p>
<p>   what they say they will do if the public puts them back. Now the</p>
<p>   facts are clear. We are the party that has delivered the lowest</p>
<p>   interest rates in 30 years. He was the Finance Minister of a Government</p>
<p>   that delivered the highest interest rates in 30 years. Now, against</p>
<p>   that backdrop, the biggest risk of all of a future Labor Government</p>
<p>   is the way in which through their big spending approach and their</p>
<p>   high deficit approach they would once again plunge this country</p>
<p>   back into higher interest rates.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It would help all the voters, wouldn't it, if this shadow</p>
<p>   boxing would stop and you both put your cards on the table. When</p>
<p>   are we going to see your tax package and their tax package, and</p>
<p>   will there be enough time before an election to scrutinise them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There will be time for people to digest what is in our tax reform</p>
<p>   approach, plenty of time, and in any event, Mr Beazley has not really</p>
<p>   put anything on the table. I mean, all he really says is that he'd</p>
<p>   like to give a popular tax cut. Well, I mean, what Opposition leader</p>
<p>   wouldn't say that. What Opposition Leader wouldn't like</p>
<p>   to do that, but that has to be put against the ordinary reality</p>
<p>   of the impact of higher interest rates that would inevitably follow</p>
<p>   the election of a Beazley government on those tax cuts.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>He's said he'll show his if you show your's. I mean,</p>
<p>   when is it going to be out there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Matt, we have said all along that we will unveil our tax reform</p>
<p>   plan, and it will be comprehensive, it will be the logical next</p>
<p>   step in providing security, safety, and stability to the Australian</p>
<p>   economy in a sea of Asian economic turmoil, and all of our policies</p>
<p>   are against that background. All of our policies are about delivering</p>
<p>   safety, security and stability to the Australian economy in a very</p>
<p>   difficult regional economic environment and our tax reform plan</p>
<p>   is the next necessary element in providing that safety, security</p>
<p>   and stability.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And presumably a cut to Diesel Fuel Excise, we see?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm not going to get into specifics, but I can say to</p>
<p>   the people of rural Australia that when they see the total tax package,</p>
<p>   they will see it as a fair one, and unlike the policies of the former</p>
<p>   government that were brutally insensitive to men and women on the</p>
<p>   land in Australia, it will be a policy that rural Australians will</p>
<p>   like.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What about health, education, those kinds of things. I mean, we</p>
<p>   do have a problem with health don't we? The AMA says it's</p>
<p>   given up talking to Michael Wooldridge, it's focussing its</p>
<p>   attention on you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's not correct, that is not correct. I mean, let</p>
<p>   me say that Michael has done an outstanding job as Health Minister</p>
<p>   and under his leadership we've seen some remarkably innovative</p>
<p>   programmes. I mean, look at the lead that he's taken on child</p>
<p>   immunisation. When we became the Government, we had immunisation</p>
<p>   levels that were at third world standards. They were disgraceful,</p>
<p>   and we've done something about that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Health funds are still bleeding to death...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, health funds would have been in a far more parlous state,</p>
<p>   far more parlous state then they are now if we hadn't introduced</p>
<p>   our incentive. But that is one of those areas where no sensible</p>
<p>   government ever closes the book and says that you can never do more,</p>
<p>   you can never make further changes, but you've got to bear</p>
<p>   in mind that compared with the health systems of other developed</p>
<p>   countries, ours is still a remarkably good and remarkably strong</p>
<p>   one with very high quality health care, provided by our doctors,</p>
<p>   and by our hospitals, and by our other health professionals. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is part of the problem, as the Treasurer says, that people walk</p>
<p>   into a doctor's surgery expecting the service to be free when</p>
<p>   in fact the taxpayer is paying?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there are a combination of views that different people have</p>
<p>   on it and I'm not going to conduct a seminar on health policy,</p>
<p>   much and all as I respect the AM programme, I don't think it</p>
<p>   is quite the right environment for it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you are under some pressure in the Senate in terms</p>
<p>   of the GST for example. You've even indicated that if they</p>
<p>   knock it back as the Labor Party has certainly promised, that you'd</p>
<p>   be prepared to go to the polls a second time. Is that a real prospect?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't know about being under pressure. I mean, the</p>
<p>   obvious...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well, there's Telstra, there's GST....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The obvious thing Matt, is that despite the huge mandate we got</p>
<p>   at the last election, the Opposition parties in the Senate have</p>
<p>   been obstructionist and what the height of that obstruction was</p>
<p>   Mr Beazley's claim that even if at the next election we are</p>
<p>   returned along with a tax reform plan we take to that next election,</p>
<p>   then he - if he is leader of the Labor Party - will encourage the</p>
<p>   Labor Party to block any tax changes even though the people may</p>
<p>   have approved them. Now, the point I made then and I make again</p>
<p>   is that is the height of arrogance. I mean we are meant to have</p>
<p>   a democracy where if the people speak, politicians listen. There</p>
<p>   is one thing that the Labor Party didn't understand at the</p>
<p>   last election was that it had stopped listening to the Australian</p>
<p>   public. And it sounds as though it hasn't learnt anything from</p>
<p>   the last election. It still refuses to listen to the Australian</p>
<p>   public. I mean our view is that we've put a tax reform plan</p>
<p>   down and if we win the next election with that tax reform plan,</p>
<p>   we ought to be able to get it through the Parliament without obstruction</p>
<p>   from the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats or, indeed, any</p>
<p>   other minor parties who may be gathered along the way.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And if you don't get through with that or Telstra......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, we'll deal with that if and when it arises.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It's certainly possible though is it not?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Matt, what I'm drawing attention to is the arrogance of an</p>
<p>   Opposition Leader who says : "I don't care what the Australian</p>
<p>   people say, I will have my way whether they like it or not".</p>
<p>   Now that is political arrogance. That's the sort of arrogance</p>
<p>   that caused Paul Keating to suffer at the hands of the Australian</p>
<p>   people at the last election and Mr Beazley is repeating the Keating</p>
<p>   arrogance.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you agree with the idea of changing the tax mix, the prospect</p>
<p>   that social services is objecting to?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I agree with getting rid of an outdated, old-fashioned wholesale</p>
<p>   tax system that imposes a penalty on our exporters and makes them</p>
<p>   very uncompetitive with other countries. I believe in getting rid</p>
<p>   of other unfair elements of our tax system that penalise effort</p>
<p>   and hard work. I am not going to get into the intricacies of the</p>
<p>   plan that we will be bringing down except to assure you and your</p>
<p>   listeners that we are not going to introduce a plan that hurts poor</p>
<p>   people and we are certainly going to be very sensitive to the needs</p>
<p>   of the underprivileged in the plan that we bring down.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I notice the Maritime Union and Chris Corrigan were in talks over</p>
<p>   the weekend and last week. Does that surprise you, it certainly.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Nothing surprises me on the waterfront Matt.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Your redundancy package is still on the table is it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look, our position is as it has always been and that is that</p>
<p>   we want reform on the waterfront because that would be good for</p>
<p>   the Australian economy. We want to get rid of compulsory unionism</p>
<p>   on the waterfront because that is bad for the Australian economy</p>
<p>   and, as far as I am concerned, if plans emerge, understandings emerge</p>
<p>   that meet those criteria, then it's fine. I mean, we have never</p>
<p>   wanted as the end result the destruction of a union. We've</p>
<p>   never wanted people to lose their jobs but we have wanted a productive,</p>
<p>   competitive waterfront that is good for the Australian economy.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So if these talks result in some of the work being contracted out,</p>
<p>   you'd be happy?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not going to make any advance judgements on what might come</p>
<p>   out of the talks or whether those results meet the criteria that</p>
<p>   we've laid down. We've specified certain policy positions</p>
<p>   as a Government in relation to the redundancy payments and those</p>
<p>   policy positions remain. What is being discussed.....</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But the deadline was today was it not?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What is being discussed between Mr Coombs and Mr Corrigan is a</p>
<p>   matter for them. I'm not privy to those discussions and, quite</p>
<p>   frankly, it's appropriate that the parties to the dispute talk</p>
<p>   it out between themselves without the interference of the Government.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>A quick question before Indonesia. Do you have a media black list</p>
<p>   as it's been reported.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't have a media black list.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So you don't know anything about it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Matt, I mean I talk to you on a regular basis.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You talk to me, exactly.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I mean we have very civil exchanges don't we?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What about Indonesia, Prime Minister. President Habibie is somebody</p>
<p>   that you and everyone else thought was political Âdead-meat'</p>
<p>   last week, is now running the country. How long do you think he'll</p>
<p>   last and are you encouraged by this apparent opening up of the prisons?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, just before I talk about the opening up of the prisons, you</p>
<p>   made a few heroic assumptions in that question about Âdead-meat'</p>
<p>   and so forth. The line I took last week and the line I now take</p>
<p>   is that the Government of Indonesia is something for the people</p>
<p>   of Indonesia and not for the people of other countries to decide.</p>
<p>   I am encouraged by what I see in relation to the political prisoners</p>
<p>   but it's early days yet and whilst, on the basis of what has</p>
<p>   been reported and on the basis of what has occurred on the surface,</p>
<p>   it is better that political prisoners be treated in a liberal fashion</p>
<p>   than in a harsh fashion. It would be premature to jump to too many</p>
<p>   conclusions. We want to see more openness in Indonesia, we've</p>
<p>   made that clear all along. We recognise that that's not going</p>
<p>   to occur overnight. His prime responsibility is to restore stability</p>
<p>   to Indonesia, to ensure that international respect for the management</p>
<p>   of the Indonesian economy returns as soon as possible and along</p>
<p>   the road I also hope that there is more openness, more freedom and</p>
<p>   more capacity for people to speak their minds than there has been</p>
<p>   in the past. I think we would all welcome that. Now whether it comes,</p>
<p>   and at what pace it comes, is a matter for the Indonesian people.</p>
<p>   But we will always be on the side of urging the Government of Indonesia</p>
<p>   to open the place up, recognising that the culture there is different,</p>
<p>   and also recognising that countries don't appreciate hectoring</p>
<p>   from the sidelines. And one of the things I believe Australia has</p>
<p>   been able to do is to quietly get its point of view across. You</p>
<p>   always know in Indonesia where Australia stands in relation to something,</p>
<p>   but at the same time retain the channels of communication with the</p>
<p>   power authorities in Indonesia and the channels of communication</p>
<p>   with the Indonesian Government. I think that's the right and</p>
<p>   the most diplomatic way to handle it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>That being so, nonetheless, is it time even given that the Information</p>
<p>   Minister there now presided over the deaths of five Australian journalists</p>
<p>   in East Timor. Is it time for an act of self-determination in Timor,</p>
<p>   is it time for the Australian Government to go public?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we have said repeatedly and, indeed, the last time I was</p>
<p>   in Indonesia, this subject was raised again that we want movement</p>
<p>   by the Indonesians in relation to East Timor and it remains now</p>
<p>   a major irritant to the rest of the world and legitimately so. And</p>
<p>   it would obviously be to the increased reputation of the Indonesian<br />
   iously be to the increased reputation of the Indonesian</p>
<p>   Government. And it would obviously be well received if there were</p>
<p>   movements in that direction in East Timor.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, thanks for joining AM.</p>
