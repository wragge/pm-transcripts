PRIME MINISTER 70/ 92<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
The Prime Minister has sent the following message to H. E. Bernard Dowiyogo, MP:<br />
On behalf of the Government and people of Australia, I would like to express my sorrow<br />
at the news of the death of former President Hammer DeRoburt. By leading Nauru to full<br />
independence in 1968, and remaining President of your country for over two decades, he<br />
secured an important place in Nauru's and the region's history.<br />
I would like to express my condolences to you and the people of Nauru. Please convey<br />
my deepest sympathy to Mr DeRoburt's family.<br />
