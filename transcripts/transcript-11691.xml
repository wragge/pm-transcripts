<p>Your Majesty, your Royal Highness, my Ministerial and Parliamentary colleagues</p>
<p> and in particular the Leader of the Opposition Mr Kim Beazley, Your Excellencies,</p>
<p> ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>Your Majesty is no stranger to this building and to this Great Hall having</p>
<p> come here in 1988 to officially declare open the new Parliament of the</p>
<p> Commonwealth of Australia. Coming here today is a reminder of the great</p>
<p> heritage of parliamentary democracy that this country inherited from the</p>
<p> United Kingdom. Fashioned and developed according to the will and the</p>
<p> design of the Australian people to create a unique national institution</p>
<p> which represents the fulcrum of Australian democracy.</p>
<p>Parliamentary democracy in this country is lively, strong and robust.</p>
<p> It is not frequently realised that Australia is one of fewer than ten</p>
<p> nations in the world that has remained continuously democratic over the</p>
<p> last 100 years. Ma'am, the links between the Crown and the institution</p>
<p> of Parliament are well known by those who understand our history and the</p>
<p> history of the world. You come here as someone who knows Australia well,</p>
<p> who has a deep affection for this country. And whatever views people hold</p>
<p> on the flow of political events, the respect for your own personal dedication</p>
<p> to your role as a Constitutional Monarch, and your understanding of the</p>
<p> workings of our system of government and the workings of the system of</p>
<p> governments of all of the countries of the Commonwealth is one that is</p>
<p> very widely respected.</p>
<p>May I on behalf of all of the people of Australia and particularly today</p>
<p> on behalf of all of my fellow Parliamentarians, and those who are gathered</p>
<p> here in the Great Hall, say how very pleased we are to have you and the</p>
<p> Duke of Edinburgh with us again. We hope that the rest of your visit to</p>
<p> Australia is as happy and as enjoyable as it has been to date. You are</p>
<p> always Ma'am a welcome visitor to this country. And in that spirit</p>
<p> Ma'am I invite the Leader of the Opposition Mr Beazley to support</p>
<p> my remarks.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
