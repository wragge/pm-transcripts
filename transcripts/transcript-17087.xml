I acknowledge the First Australians on whose land we meet, and whose cultures we celebrate as among the oldest continuing cultures in human history.</p>
<p>It's an honour to join you on this sacred ground for the Australian Labor Party.</p>
<p>The site of past election campaign launches by Don Dunstan.</p>
<p>The man who represented Norwood in Parliament for more than a quarter of a century.</p>
<p>The man recognised as among the greatest Labor leaders and the greatest Australian Premiers.</p>
<p>The man who transformed South Australia - building a modern, sophisticated, confident and outward-looking South Australia that became a beacon for the nation.</p>
<p>Today, the bloke who started political life working for Don Dunstan, returns to the Norwood Town Hall.</p>
<p>As your leader.</p>
<p>As your Premier.</p>
<p>And seeking a fresh mandate from the people of South Australia.</p>
<p>Mike is Australia's most experienced Premier.</p>
<p>Mike Rann is an unapologetic champion for South Australia.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Mike is a leader who has delivered for South Australia.</p>
<p>With new industries.</p>
<p>New businesses.</p>
<p>New jobs for a new generation of South Australians.</p>
<p>In short a new vision for South Australia's future.</p>
<p>Friends, eight years ago, before Mike Rann became Premier, it was a different story for this state.</p>
<p>South Australia's unemployment rate was above the nation's average, at 7.2 per cent.</p>
<p>Kids were leaving to find jobs elsewhere.</p>
<p>And South Australians were worrying about their future.</p>
<p>Eight years later, things have changed.</p>
<p>Unemployment is just 4.4 per cent - well below (and no longer above) the nation's average.</p>
<p>The number of jobs in South Australia has grown by almost 20 per cent - as young people now stay rather than giving up and leaving the state.</p>
<p>And major projects are now coming to South Australia - not leaving South Australia, as in the past.</p>
<p>Friends, South Australia has experienced one of the greatest transformations of any state in the Federation.</p>
<p>And this is not an accident.</p>
<p>It's the result of Mike Rann, his cabinet and his government, working, working, working.</p>
<p>Providing strong leadership.</p>
<p>Providing responsible economic management.</p>
<p>And Mike always leading from the front.</p>
<p>But all this could be put at risk if an untested, ill-prepared and risky Liberal Party is allowed to slide back into power on March 20.</p>
<p>Friends, in the two years since the new Australian Government came to office nationally, we have built a strong partnership with the Rann Government.</p>
<p>Partnership is not a word.</p>
<p>Partnership is a fact.</p>
<p>Partnership investing in nation-building infrastructure.</p>
<p>A partnership in bringing the jobs and industries of the future to this great state.</p>
<p>And partnership in helping secure the future of South Australia's water supply.</p>
<p>From the day we established Infrastructure Australia, to set national priorities for infrastructure investment, Mike was the first Premier beating down my door.</p>
<p>And from the beginning, one thing was clear.</p>
<p>When Mike comes with an idea or proposal - it's never sloppy or half-baked.</p>
<p>It's worked out, thought through and carefully costed.</p>
<p>That's why South Australia's plans were among the first projects in the nation to be endorsed by Infrastructure Australia.</p>
<p>Since we came to office nationally, the Australian Government's investment in road and rail infrastructure in South Australia has increased by 264 per cent, compared to the Howard Government.</p>
<p>Like the Australian Government's $500 million investment in the South Road upgrade.</p>
<p>Almost $300 million for the electrification of Gawler rail line north.</p>
<p>$291 million to extend the Noarlunga rail line south down to Seaford.</p>
<p>$61 million investment million to extend the Adelaide O-Bahn road right into the heart of the city.</p>
<p>Our investment through the Local Government Reform Fund in four projects here in Adelaide - to develop new, innovative approaches to long-term city planning.</p>
<p>And let's never forget about our partnership on water.</p>
<p>Our investment of $328 million to double the capacity of Adelaide's desalination plant - powered by renewable energy - a plant capable of securing half of Adelaide's future water needs.</p>
<p>Do you know, the previous Federal government never invested a dollar in urban rail or urban water.</p>
<p>Not a single dollar.</p>
<p>That has now changed.</p>
<p>And changed fundamentally.</p>
<p>And if you want evidence of what partnership is all about - it's about real projects on the ground that would make a real different to the lives of working families.</p>
<p>I said before the transformation of South Australia has been profound.</p>
<p>And nowhere is this more evident than in the transformation of the South Australian economy.</p>
<p>An economy now diversifying into high-value industries and high-skilled jobs.</p>
<p>Transforming the economy from traditional manufacturing into high-tech manufacturing, major defence projects, renewable energy and advanced industries to support mining and information technology.</p>
<p>Industries that are driving the future growth of this economy.</p>
<p>And industries that are generating high-skilled, rewarding jobs for our kids today and for future generations.</p>
<p>Of course, little of this would have been possible had we stood idly by last year as economies around the world fell like nine pins.</p>
<p>As millions of workers in Europe and America lost their jobs - and still remain out of work.</p>
<p>Together with Mike's government, we decided to make a difference.</p>
<p>The Australian Government has made a $4.2 billion investment in South Australia through our nation-building infrastructure stimulus plan.</p>
<p>The result for the nation (and for South Australia) - among the major advanced economies.</p>
<p>The highest growth.</p>
<p>The second lowest unemployment rate.</p>
<p>The lowest debt.</p>
<p>The lowest deficits.</p>
<p>And the only one not to go into recession.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the last financial year South Australia grew by 1.4 per cent.</p>
<p>The second highest growth rate in the nation.</p>
<p>And a country mile ahead of the rest of the world.</p>
<p>And while the auto industry was collapsing around the world, we did it differently in Australia.</p>
<p>We did it differently in South Australia.</p>
<p>The Australian Government's $6.2 billion New Green Car Plan is securing future jobs and future opportunities for local car manufacturing.</p>
<p>Just over twelve months ago, I visited the heart of Australia's $7 billion automotive industry in Elizabeth to launch an all-new, fuel-efficient, low-emission small car - the result of a $149 million co-investment with Holden.</p>
<p>This is a great win for South Australian manufacturing.</p>
<p>For Australian manufacturing.</p>
<p>For family budgets.</p>
<p>And for the environment. </p>
<p>So you ask what partnership means.</p>
<p>It's not a slogan.</p>
<p>It's a reality.</p>
<p>And one that makes a real difference on the ground to the needs of working families.</p>
<p>We've increased our investment in health and hospitals here in South Australia by 43 per cent compared to the Howard Government.</p>
<p>We're investing in an education revolution, including $1.4 billion in the biggest school modernisation project ever seen in this state - spread across 789 schools.</p>
<p>And we're tackling the huge challenge of securing South Australia's future water supply.</p>
<p>For too long, this challenge was neglected both by the Commonwealth, the eastern states and previous governments of this state.</p>
<p>But now the challenge is being tackled head-on.</p>
<p>For the first time, the Australian Government has now committed over $1 billion to new water infrastructure projects in South Australia.</p>
<p>For the first time, we are also buying back water rights to restore our rivers to better health.</p>
<p>We have now secured the purchase of 797 gigalitres of water entitlements at a cost of $1.27 billion - despite strong opposition from the Liberals.</p>
<p>And for the first time, we have a Commonwealth Minister with national responsibility for the overall cap on the Murray Darling and a Basin-wide plan to give effect to that cap.</p>
<p>And that minister is a South Australian - Senator Penny Wong.</p>
<p>Nobody deserves more credit for the changes in national water policy than Mike Rann.</p>
<p>Mike has been unrelenting in demanding South Australia gets its fair share.</p>
<p>Just ask the Victorians.</p>
<p>Of course there's no quick fixes - we all know that.</p>
<p>South Australia's challenges with water shortages have been accumulating for well over a century.</p>
<p>But finally, there's real action underway.</p>
<p>So you ask what partnership means.</p>
<p>It means what we have done together in just two short years on the economy, on infrastructure, on schools, on hospitals and on water.</p>
<p>The absolute basics of what governments must be about.</p>
<p>Friends, Mike Rann is the bloke who's taken this state from being behind the pack.</p>
<p>And he's put South Australia out in front.</p>
<p>He's got plans for South Australia's future.</p>
<p>And deserves to be able to finish the job.</p>
<p>And as Prime Minister, I look forward to working with him to deliver for South Australia's future.</p>
<p>It's my pleasure to introduce to you my friend, the Premier of South Australia, Mike Rann. </p>
