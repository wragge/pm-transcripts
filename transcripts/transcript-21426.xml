    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister today committed Australian Government funding of up to $6.5 million towards the upgrade of local roads in the Ravensthorpe area in southern Western Australia.</p>
<p>  "The Australian Government has committed this funding because of the significant regional economic impact of the nickel mine project to the Ravensthorpe/Esperance region", he said.</p>
<p>He said, "These roads are integral to the operation of BHP Billiton's nickel mine operations there.</p>
<p>  The Prime Minister said that there would be 315 permanent direct jobs and 930 indirect jobs created once the mine is at full capacity.</p>
<p>  The local roads have been designated as roads of national importance and include:</p>
<p> Lee Road from the Hopetoun - Ravensthorpe Road to Jerdacuttup North Road</p>
<p> Jerdacuttup Road to the mine entrance</p>
<p> Tamarine Road from Jerdacuttup Road to Middle Road</p>
<p>"The Australian Government is committed to a residential work force for the mine, rather than a fly in - fly out operation.  A residential workforce will have greater long term benefits for the region", he said.</p>
<p>"Our commitment is conditional on BHP Billiton using a residential work force based in the Esperance, Ravensthorpe and Hopetoun region.", the Prime Minister said.</p>
<p>"As is normal practice with roads of national importance, the Australian Government expects a contribution from other befitting parties including local government, the WA Government and BHP Billiton."  </p>
