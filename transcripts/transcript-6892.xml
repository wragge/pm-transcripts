FOR MEDIA 18 April 1986<br />
I shall make a short visit to the Philippines at the conclusion<br />
of my visit to Japan and China for discussions with President<br />
Aquino on 26 May.<br />
I welcome very much this opportunity to make personal contact<br />
with Mrs Aquino and to reaffirm personally the Government's<br />
support for the new government in the Philippines. We place<br />
importance on our relations with the Philippines, a regional<br />
friend and partner.<br />
In my discussions with Mrs Aquino I intend to explore ways in<br />
which Australia can assist in the economic development of the<br />
Philippines and also to hear from Mrs Aquino of the policies and<br />
views of the new government.<br />
I shall depart from the Philippines to return to Australia on 26<br />
May. </p>
