CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIM4E MINISTER<br />
AAP 50th ANNIVERSARY DINNER SYDNEY 29 MAY 1985<br />
Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen<br />
It gives me great pleasure to be here tonight to join<br />
with you in celebrating AAP's 50th anniversary.<br />
Many people in the community, with the exception, of<br />
course, of those here tonight, know of AAP only from the<br />
letters at the end of a story appearing in a newspaper.<br />
It has been said that AAP, whoever he or she is, must be<br />
the hardest working Journalist around.<br />
The joke may be a familiar one to this audience but it<br />
serves to underscore the pervasiveness of AAP. Since<br />
its beginnings in 1935 AAP has developed into the<br />
leading disseminator of news and information in this<br />
country.<br />
But AAP's stature goes beyond the domestic scene. it<br />
plays an important role in communicating Australian<br />
developments and attitudes to the rest of the world.<br />
In part AAP's success is a reflection of the quality and<br />
level of service AAP has striven to provide. It has, in<br />
the fifty years of its life, remained true to the pledge<br />
of AAP's founders.<br />
A pledge to provide the Australian public with " the most<br />
accurate and most searching information of all world<br />
activities and thought without any tendency toward the<br />
exercise of political partisanship or bias".<br />
AAP's growth is also attributable to its adaptability.<br />
It has been over the fifty years of its existence, at<br />
the forefront of technological innovation. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The pen and the telegram of yesteryear have been<br />
replaced by sophisticated computer and microwave<br />
systems. The introduction of the domestic<br />
communications satellite system to this country later<br />
this year will present further opportunities for<br />
expansion. I understand that, true to its traditions,<br />
AAP is ready to grasp this new opportunity.<br />
As technology has changed, AAP has expanded the range of<br />
services it provides to the community and opened new<br />
markets for information services. The financial and<br />
business communities and even Prime Ministers are<br />
particularly well provided for with AAP's specially<br />
tailored services.<br />
Many of these services spring from advances in<br />
technology. This underscores the philosophy, clearly<br />
understood by all politicians, as well as A. AP, that all<br />
the information in the world is of little use if it<br />
can't-be communicated to the people who matter.<br />
This is the basis of the special role the media play in<br />
our society. The media is the link between those with<br />
the information and those to whom it needs to be<br />
communicated.<br />
This is a heavy responsibility and not one to be abused<br />
either by the media itself or by those who use it. In<br />
this regard, the kind of advertising which is currently<br />
being run by the Queensland Government on the Grant's<br />
Commission Report reflects very badly on that<br />
Government. The Queensland Government's advertising is obviously<br />
intended as a pre-match tactical manoeuvre leading up to<br />
the Premiers' Conference to condition the electorate to<br />
believe that Queensland is about to become some sort of<br />
victim of Canberra.<br />
The advertising is inaccurate. It is misleading. It is<br />
a cheap shot by the Queensland Government because they<br />
are trying to portray the authoritative recommendation<br />
of a non-partisan, quasi-judicial body as some kind of<br />
political vendetta. It is cheap and it is an insult to<br />
the members of the Grants Commission as well as to the<br />
intelligence of the Queensland public.<br />
The Grant's Commission finding about the payments which<br />
should be made to Queensland is not some figure<br />
confected by the Federal Government, plucked out of the<br />
air to punish Queensland becuase its Government is a<br />
different colour to ours. The Grant's Commission's<br />
Report is a result of exhaustive research and inquiry.<br />
It is based on the long experience of the commission<br />
members. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
And in case anyone might then suggest that the<br />
Commission has been stacked, let me just remind the<br />
Queensland Government about the makeup of the<br />
Commission the fact is that every member of the<br />
Commission was appointed by the Fraser Government.<br />
The Queensland Government's own advertising standards<br />
highlight the importance of the media getting its facts<br />
right. In the early days it was enough for newspapers and<br />
there were only newspapers then to report the facts<br />
and nothing else.<br />
Indeed, it would not be far wrong to say that a<br />
journalist would have been considered somewhat<br />
impertinent to have offered an opinion on these facts.<br />
But this is clearly no longer the case. Your public<br />
expects a great deal more of you now. The public still<br />
demands a high standard of propriety and fair and<br />
accurate coverage of events. They now also not only<br />
expect the news, but also expect analysis of it and<br />
expect it very quickly.<br />
Governments are sometimes accused of being too sensitive<br />
to critical reporting or analysis of decisions. My<br />
Government welcomes informed commentary and constructive<br />
criticism. But, like the public at large, we believe commentary<br />
should be well informed and well based. Analysis based<br />
on prejudice, poor research or a gross misunderstanding<br />
of the facts contributes neither to good Government or<br />
to the well being of the public.<br />
AAP plays a crucial role in ensuring that the media are<br />
in a position to provide this sort of service.<br />
Societies such as Australia rely on fair and<br />
professional * media. The public needs the service<br />
because people need to know as completely as possible<br />
what is going on. And Governments need the media to get<br />
their message, their policies across to the people.<br />
Both these roles are vital.<br />
Good Government demands that the electorate knows what<br />
the Government is dioing and why it is doing it.<br />
New technology is making an important contribution to<br />
that process. The launch of AUSSAT satellites<br />
represents a further major step in improving </p>
<p>-4-<br />
communications for all Australians.<br />
AUSSAT's network of satellite earth stations around<br />
Australia will enable it to provide fast and economical<br />
access to its services to all areas of Australia.<br />
This, along; with the other benefits of the satellite<br />
system, will ensure that all Australians will be better<br />
informed than ever before on all aspects of the news<br />
and particularly, I hope, the Government's policies.<br />
The core of our approach to Government has been our<br />
drive for a wealthier, more secure Australia, with high<br />
economic growth, low inflation and reduced unemployment.<br />
Only with such conditions can progress be made towards a<br />
more just and equitable society.<br />
Our approach has been based on a consistent, integrated<br />
package of fiscal and monetary policies underpinned by<br />
our prices and incomes policy defined in the Accord.<br />
These policies have been remarkable not only for their<br />
success, but for the consistency with which they have<br />
been applied since we came to office.<br />
We have gone to great lengths to ensure these policies<br />
have been clearly enunciated and understood. We began<br />
this process just over two years ago with the National<br />
Economic Summit. The Economic Planning Advisory Council<br />
which emerged out of the Economic Summit has a very<br />
broad base of representation, as does the Advisory<br />
Committee on Prices and Incomes.<br />
It has been our particular concern to ensure that those<br />
most affected by decisions of the Government have been<br />
given sufficient information to make proper assessments<br />
of the policy options available to the Government. In<br />
this we have appreciated the co-operation and goodwill<br />
of the media and of the press in particular to ensure<br />
that the facts are quickly disseminated.<br />
But words are not enough. Governments are judged<br />
ultimately on their record.. Judged by that yard stick,<br />
we can claim a remarkable track record of achievement:<br />
Australians rate of inflation has fallen markedly<br />
economic growth has been strong and a firm basis<br />
exists for balanced growth with the private sector<br />
playing an increasingly important role </p>
<p>unemployment has fallen to<br />
industrial disputation has fallen to very low<br />
levels.<br />
our achievements have been facilitated by the framework<br />
of the Accord which provides clear lines of<br />
communication between the parties to the agreement. it<br />
plays an important role in communicating information and<br />
points of view, ensuring that there is a proper<br />
appreciation of policy options available to Government.<br />
At the same time the Government, as custodian and<br />
representative of the interests of the community at<br />
large accepts the responsibility to take the final<br />
decisions, with the national interest being the<br />
paramount consideration.<br />
The recent depreciation of the dollar has thrown up a<br />
new challenge to the Accord. This challenge is to<br />
maximise the benefits to output and employment which a<br />
substantial real depreciation could bring, while<br />
ensuring that inflation is kept to the minimum.<br />
The right wages outcome is essential. It must involve a<br />
lesser real wage level during the adjustment period than<br />
would otherwise have applied.<br />
The options available to the Government include<br />
adjusting either through the planned national<br />
productivity case or discounting.<br />
As for any productivity increase, it is our view that<br />
the questions of the size, timing and phasing of any<br />
such increase should be deferred until the scope of the<br />
depreciation and the extent of its effect on the economy<br />
becomes apparent.<br />
The depreciation had little impact on the March quarter,<br />
and it will have little more on the June quarter. The<br />
real effects * on the consumer price index will flow<br />
through over a longer period. ' Against this background<br />
it is the Government's view that the wage indexation<br />
case should proceed as normal in September under present<br />
Principles.<br />
A major focus of our policies has been to put in place<br />
the conditions neclessary for sustained growth.<br />
The outlook for economic growth in coming years depends<br />
on achieving balanced growth with a strong private<br />
sector. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
An essential ingredient in the medium-term health of the<br />
economy is striking the right balance between claims on<br />
resources by the public and private sectors.<br />
There has been a tendency towards an increasing share of<br />
resources being claimed by Governments. This<br />
development partly reflects the severity of the last<br />
recession and the fiscal stimulus required to provide a<br />
kick-start to the recovery. It also reflects a longer<br />
term trend throughout most of the post-war period under<br />
both Conservative and Labor Governments.<br />
It is a simple fact that the larger the net claim on<br />
real resources by the public sector, the higher is the<br />
call on savings. But in circumstances where there is a<br />
pick up in private sector demand, higher pressures in<br />
financial markets are likely to put real pressure on<br />
interest rates.<br />
An increasing supplement to domestic savings from world<br />
financial markets would also be required; this would be<br />
directly reflected in a still larger current account<br />
deficit. Such developments would impact adversely on the outlook<br />
for sustainable strong economic growth. Mly Government<br />
is determined to avoid such developments.<br />
Fiscal policy objectives have been clearly stated in the<br />
fiscal Trilogy. The May Statement is the first step in<br />
the achievement of these objectives and I believe it has<br />
demonstrated our continuing commitment to responsible<br />
fiscal management and will have an ongoing impact on the<br />
deficit in future years.<br />
Indeed the Australian Labor Government will fulfill its<br />
commitment to achieve a substantial reduction in the<br />
1985-86 deficit.<br />
However, it should be obvious to all that restraint in<br />
public spending is not the sole responsibility of the<br />
Commonwealth. To be effective, it needs to extend to<br />
all levels of government, without exception.<br />
The efforts by the Government to date in achieving some<br />
hardwon reductions in government spending in the May<br />
Statement could be unwound if other levels of Government<br />
were simply to expand their activities without regard<br />
for the future neods of the economy as a whole.<br />
That would be unfortunate for all of us.<br />
The community as a whole, not just the Commonwealth<br />
Government, has an important stake in the goal of<br />
balanced sustained economic growth. For none is this </p>
<p>perhaps more important than it is for the States.<br />
At tomorrow's Premier's Conference we shall be calling<br />
on the States to make their contribution to achieving a<br />
significant and lasting reduction in the relative size<br />
of the claim of the public sector on the economy.<br />
Without their co-operation in containing the growth of<br />
the public sector, the prospect of securing a sustained<br />
national economic recovery would suffer a major setback.<br />
While some specific purpose grants to the States have<br />
already been decided, the bulk of Comonwealth/ State<br />
financial payments will be settled at the Premiers'<br />
Conference and Loan Council.<br />
A major concern is the size of the total pool of grants<br />
to be shared:<br />
in other words what increase in state funding over<br />
K 1984/ 85 is appropriate?<br />
A number of factors influence the Commonwealth's<br />
position in this crucial area. These include, in<br />
addition to the Government's firm and non-negotiable<br />
fiscal objectives:<br />
the fact that during 1983/ 84 the States were able<br />
to significantly increase expenditures in real<br />
terms whilst at the same time reducing their<br />
aggregate deficits<br />
S and again in 1984/ 85 have budgeted for a<br />
significant increase in expenditures;<br />
the fact that, with the rapid growth in outlays in<br />
recent years, assisted by the very strong growth in<br />
Commonwealth payments to the States, particularly<br />
over the last three years, the States' share of the<br />
. national resources in recent years has been at an<br />
all-time high;<br />
that economic recovery has benefitted the States,<br />
in particular has led to an expansion in their<br />
revenue bases in line with the general pickup in<br />
economic activity.<br />
The current tax sharing arrangements have been<br />
criticised in numerous quarters as an inappropriate<br />
basis for revenue sharing.<br />
It is clear that a share of the previous year's<br />
Commonwealth tax collections does not necessarily<br />
correspond to the appropriate level of funding of the<br />
States in the current year, especially in times of </p>
<p>-8-<br />
strong economic growth.<br />
In particular, there is no justification in the<br />
current economic circumstances for the very large<br />
increase in state tax sharing payments that would<br />
have resulted from a continuation of the current<br />
arrangements. Conversely, the Commonwealth has, in the past, had<br />
to resort to providing special revenue assistance<br />
to top-up tax sharing payments because of problems<br />
with the current arrangements.<br />
In this context, the Commonwealth has examined a range<br />
of alternatives in developing the position which will<br />
be put to the States tomorrow.<br />
I do not propose to go into details at this stage.<br />
Suffice to say that the Commonwealth expects the States<br />
also to adopt a disciplined approach to expenditure<br />
restraint. At the Federal level we have delivered<br />
substantially already.<br />
The Government is determined to continue progress in<br />
reducing the public sector borrowing requirement ( PSBR)<br />
there is every prospect that in 1984/ 85 the PSBR<br />
will come in at around 7% of GDP ( compared to 8% in<br />
1983/ 84).<br />
our aim in 1985/ 86 is to reduce the PSBR further.<br />
This will require firm control on both budget related<br />
and other borrowing programs at all levels of<br />
Government.<br />
A key agenda item for the Premiers' Conference, and for<br />
that matter the Budget outcome, is the renegotiation of<br />
the arrangements whereby the Commonwealth's general<br />
revenue assistance is shared between the States.<br />
There has been bipartisan support for the Commonwealth's<br />
support of the principle of fiscal equalisation.<br />
That is, the distribution of Commonwealth funding should<br />
be such as to allow each State to provide government<br />
services at standards not appreciably different than<br />
those of other States, without having to impose taxes<br />
and charges at levels appreciably different from the<br />
levels imposed by he other States.<br />
The Commonwealth firmly supports this principle.<br />
Such an approach is natural for a society which is<br />
concerned with fairness and equity. It gives the States </p>
<p>and the communities that they represent a " fair go".<br />
The recent Report of the Grants Commission indicates<br />
that a substantial realignment of the shares of some<br />
States is required esscntially to make up for the<br />
unduly favourable treatment received by one or two<br />
States under the previous arrangements. In fairness to<br />
other Australians we intend to ensure that the<br />
Commission's recommendations this time are properly<br />
implemented. In saying this, however, we will be concerned to ensure<br />
that any adjustments required to meet the objective of<br />
fiscal equalisation do not impose an unreasonable short<br />
term burden on individual States.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, the theme of much of this talk has<br />
been communication and the clarity of the message. it<br />
is crucial that the economic and fiscal considerations<br />
behind our actions be conveyed and understood by all<br />
Australians if the best outcome is to be achieved. That<br />
outcome would see the achievement of the conditions<br />
necessary for sustained economic growth at rates<br />
sufficient to restore prosperity to all Australians.<br />
What is done at this Premiers' Conference will have a<br />
major bearing on that objective. For our part we will<br />
be looking for the full co-operation and involvement of<br />
the States with the National task.<br />
I do not believe any Government, Federal or State, would<br />
want to be a party to any decisions at that Conference<br />
which were not in the best interests of all Australians.<br />
Certainly, for the Federal Government's'part as I said<br />
last weekend in Tasmania we will not allow the<br />
interest of any State to be trampled on. Wle will not<br />
allow the welfare of the people of any State or region<br />
or section to be disadvantaged.<br />
The economic welfare of Australia as a whole is at<br />
stake. The result we seek is one I am sure all<br />
Australians will welcome.<br />
Thank you. </p>
