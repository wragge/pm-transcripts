TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, AUSNUSIC TRAINING CENTRE,<br />
MELBOURNE 12 MAY 1989<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, did you lose your cool last night in<br />
Parliament? PM: I wasn't in Parliament last night.<br />
JOURNALIST: The ' recycled dunderhead' remark has been<br />
reported, do you have any thinking on that?<br />
PM: No, no, I don't have any regrets about a little bit of<br />
tough language. The fact is that we have a leader who is<br />
recylced but that's no reflection on Andrew, it's rather a<br />
reflection on the Liberal Party. He's been there and it's a<br />
reflection on the absence of a range of talent, there's<br />
no-one else that they can go to, they've got to go back to<br />
someone who's been there before and failed. I'm not trying<br />
to make a personal attack on Andrew, there's no point in<br />
doing that, but it does really involve a reflection on the<br />
very very shallow pool of talent in the conservative ranks<br />
in the Federal Parliament.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, it appears that the former<br />
Liberal leader Mr Howard is now destined to the backbench.<br />
Do you think that's an appropriate spot for him?<br />
PM: Well, it means that Mr Peacock is having a great deal<br />
of difficulty in getting his front bench together.<br />
Apparently they've been negotiating for some time, Mr Howard<br />
suggested two portfolios, one of two portfolios that he<br />
wanted, Mr Peacock wasn't prepared to give them to him. I<br />
think that is probably not a reflection of his judgement as<br />
to the lack of capacity of Mr Howard for either of those two<br />
portfolios but rather he's got a lot of bills out. I mean<br />
he owes a lot. You've got a situation where if you've<br />
promised 40 and there's only 30, you know 40 into 30 won't<br />
go and particularly if you've made some special promises.<br />
So I think that there is just simply no doubt that in any<br />
current Opposition front bench John Howard ought to be part<br />
of it. There's no way he oughtn't to be part of it. What<br />
is certain is that it will be less than their best front<br />
bench if he's not in it and that's quite clearly the case<br />
now. JOURNALIST: But doesn't it also give Mr Peacock a<br />
completely fresh start, a chance to start all over again? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: How can it's hardly a fresh start all over again when<br />
you're having a recycled leader. That's hardly a fresh<br />
start all over again is it? I mean it's the same players as<br />
before so how can it. Mr Peacock is the last person who can<br />
be having a completely fresh start. It just is<br />
indisputable. Wherever you are in the political spectrum<br />
it's indisputably true that the Opposition front bench is<br />
going to be less than at its optimum, whatever that level<br />
is, it's going to be less than its optimum if John Howard is<br />
not part. Why is John Howard not a part of it? Because<br />
Andrew Peacock refuses to give him one of the two portfolios<br />
that he wants.<br />
JOURNALIST: So do the events of this week give you the new<br />
opportunity for an early election?<br />
PM: That really is old hat. I was never going to call an<br />
early election. You know who it was that started the story<br />
of an early election? It was a bloke called John Howard.<br />
John Howard was a bloke who was talking about an early<br />
election. Why? Because he was frightened there was going<br />
to be a challenge to his leadership so he thought if he<br />
talked about an early election that would stave off a<br />
challenge to him. Now like in most things John Howard was<br />
involved in, he made a mess of it. Bob Hawke was not<br />
talking about an early election, Bob Hawke delivered the tax<br />
cuts as the delivery of a promise he made 12 months ago. So<br />
I don't know why you go on with this talk about an early<br />
election. The bloke who put the story around has just had<br />
his throat cut.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will Mr Peacock be more difficult to handle<br />
though as an opponent than John Howard?<br />
PM: No, I don't think so. I think it's obviously the case,<br />
I would expect it to be the case that Andrew will get a bit<br />
of a honeymoon from the electorate and in the polls. I mean<br />
that's always the case, you get a new bloke in, I would<br />
expect that to be the case but then he will have to face up<br />
to he's had to face up to it before the question of a)<br />
preparing policies, b) understanding them, c) being able to<br />
talk about all the details of those policies both within the<br />
Parliament and through the public gaze. We're confident<br />
that we've got the superior policies and the superior<br />
record.<br />
JOURNALIST: The souffle not only rose again, do you think<br />
it will fall again?<br />
PM: Oh well, that's Paul's, I mean Paul's got a copyright<br />
on that one. I think it was a pretty good line actually, I<br />
wished I'd thought of it myself. But it's Paul's and I<br />
don't want to intrude into that area of analogy. I'll leave<br />
the development of that to Paul. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think Mr Peacock got the better of you<br />
in that clash yesterday in Parliament?<br />
PM: No, what simply happened in the Parliament yesterday<br />
was he tried to make a big issue out of the fact that<br />
there'd been a slip that I'd made, eight per cent per annum<br />
that I'd apparently said, as though I'd meant it. Obviously<br />
it was eight per cent over the period since ' 83. All I can<br />
say now is as I said then, if he thinks that's a big deal,<br />
as I said, ' bung on boyo', because if that's the measure of<br />
the importance of your first question. The second one which<br />
didn't involve Mr Peacock, as I said, I simply made a<br />
mistake in terms of assuming that a particular item was in<br />
the $ 17 million that had been raised in the question by one<br />
of the Members and I readily conceded that it was mistaken.<br />
JOURNALIST: You don't think you overreacted<br />
PM: No, I mean you oughtn't to be around Parliament if you<br />
think what I said is something to be upset about. That was<br />
pretty tender stuff really.<br />
JOURNALIST: So what's Mr Peacock's future now?<br />
PM: Well he's got his second time around as Leader of the<br />
Opposition and if we are to believe what's in the paper<br />
and I'm always a little bit doubtful about believing<br />
everything I read in the press, I've been around a long time<br />
and they do make mistakes but if we are to believe what's<br />
in the press we're told that those who supported him said<br />
he's got it on two conditions. One, that he's got one shot,<br />
if he loses the next time, as he will, then he's finished<br />
and secondly which I thought was very strange people<br />
saying this that he's got to be non-controversial and lead<br />
an impecable public and private life. That's nonsense that<br />
sort of stuff, but they are the sort of conditions that were<br />
laid down. Nonsense.<br />
JOURNALIST: Who would you have preferred to face coming up<br />
to an election, Hawke or<br />
PM: Hawke?<br />
JOURNALIST: No, sorry not Hawke, Peacock or Howard?<br />
PM: I am quite relaxed about it, I really am. I suppose<br />
what you can say is this, that the people had sort of got<br />
used to John Howard and seemed to be giving a thumbs down.<br />
As I said before, I think that Andrew will get a little bit<br />
of a honeymoon. That's exactly what you'd expect so in that<br />
sense there'll be a bit of an advantage for the Opposition<br />
for a while. But there's a long time to go to the next<br />
election and the inadequacies of the Opposition will come<br />
through. This is not just a personality thing I'm talking<br />
about in regards to Andrew. What will be on issue is<br />
firstly the comparative record of this Government in our </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM ( cont): seven years in office and their absymal seven<br />
years, and secondly the question of policies and relevance<br />
of policies. We'll beat the hell out of them on both record<br />
and policies.<br />
JOURNALIST: So you're in a stronger position now than you<br />
were this time last week?<br />
PM: No, I think initially, as I say, there'll be a<br />
honeymoon period for Andrew Peacock and the opposition. I'd<br />
be very surprised if there wasn't a bit of a honeymoon. But<br />
you see the fundamentals haven't changed. The fundamentals<br />
simply are that this mob have been in Opposition for six<br />
years and they haven't got their policies out on<br />
fundamentals yet, like tax for instance. That reflects<br />
their incompetence, their laziness, their internal divisions<br />
and that's not going to change because they've swapped<br />
leaders and put back a bloke who's been there before.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, a Melbourne paper has the Liberals in<br />
an opinion poll well ahead of the Labor Party. Is that part<br />
of their honeymoon period too?<br />
PM: I would expect, I haven't seen this, is it out today is<br />
it? Whose is it, whose poll?<br />
JOURNALIST: It's a Herald poll.<br />
PM: It's a Herald poll is it. well I'm not entirely<br />
surprised. I've just been saying I expect them to get a bit<br />
of a honeymoon but that won't last long.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you prepared to debate with Andrew Peacock<br />
on your policies<br />
PM: Parliament that we do that, happening, I hope<br />
that he'll want to debate policies. I hope he'll give me<br />
the opportunity of debating his policies in the Parliament.<br />
But to have a debate about policies, about their policies,<br />
they've got to have some. So the sine qua none for having a<br />
debate with Andrew Peacock in the Parliament about his<br />
policies is that he gets them.<br />
JOURNALIST: what about a television debate Mr Hawke? Would<br />
you have a debate with him on national television?<br />
PM: What's this gimmick business of getting into television<br />
debates now? There's no election on.<br />
JOURNALIST: charisma factor that Mr Peacock's Do<br />
you feel threatened by that electorally?<br />
PM: No, not at all.<br />
ends </p>
