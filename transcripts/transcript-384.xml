P. M. No. 51/ 1_ 96.<br />
CONSUYER PRICE INDEX<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
Among the objectives of our mu~ ch discussed economic policy were<br />
The arresting of the run-down in our overseas balances and building them<br />
up to satisfactory levels. This has been successfully achieved, the<br />
reduction in imports in recent months being notable.<br />
The halting of the inflationary boom. Today's announcement of the<br />
Consumer Price Index figures demonstrates the success so far of our antiinflationary<br />
measures. The figures released today for the six capitals<br />
show that in 1960 up to and including the September quarter, the rises in<br />
the Index were 1.8% and each of these being a quarterly<br />
figure. Since the announcement of the measures of last November this<br />
increase has steadily fallen until now it has turned into a reduction.<br />
The three quarterly figures of 1961 are 0.6% and This puts<br />
into graphic form the steady success of our measures in the battle<br />
against inflditon. The news should be received with pleasure by all<br />
Australians who feel that the battle against inflation is a battle for<br />
the financial security of urdinary men and women.<br />
I am informed, as a matter of interest, that in this last quarter the<br />
overall movement of the Consumer Price Index was much the 3ame as would have<br />
been shiown by the old Series Index.<br />
CANBER. RA October, 19,61. </p>
