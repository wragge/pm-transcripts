-J PRIME MINISTER THURSDAY, 18 OCTOBER 1979<br />
From the Press Office SUMMARY OF ABC'S<br />
Mother . Theresa, who has working amongst the poor and sick in<br />
India for 50 years, has won the Nobel Peace Prize.<br />
The row over the controversial amendments to the Conciliation'<br />
and Arbitration took a new turn in Sydney last night. when the<br />
Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr. Street, met with the<br />
President of the Arbitration commission, Sir John Moore, to<br />
discuss the Commission's reservations about the changes.<br />
Report<br />
The hastily convened meeting last night was the result of an<br />
earlier meeting between Sir John Moore and representatives of the<br />
Commissioners and 8 Deputy Presidents. The meeting followed<br />
revelations that the Association of Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Commissioners had voted unanimously to telex the minister,<br />
Mr. Street, to inform him of their reservations about the<br />
legislation. Late yesterday afternoon Sir John Moore in a brief<br />
statement said that as a result of informal discussions about the<br />
consultative provisions of the amendments it had been decided<br />
that he, as President, should seek an opportunity to discuss<br />
the matter with the Minister. Mr.* Street has made it quite clear<br />
that the-. proper channels for any complaints go through Sir John,<br />
and it is significant that he moved so quickly to meet with him.<br />
Already Opposition Leader Bill Hayden has attacked the Government<br />
for continuing with the legislation in the face of judicial<br />
opposition. He said that Mr. Fraser can no longer ignore the<br />
reality that his Government ' is in direct conflict with the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. He added that now that<br />
the President, Sir John Moore, had intervened it was an u nprecedented<br />
situation which the Prime Minister could not dismiss.<br />
Last night Mr. Street's office refused to comment on the details<br />
of the meeting with Sir John, but it is understood that Mr. Street<br />
will report directly to the Prime Minister before reporting<br />
to the Parliament.<br />
While Mr. Street was meeting with Sir John in Sydney, the<br />
Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Lionel Bowen, accused the<br />
Minister of misleading the Parliament over circulation of the<br />
controversial Staples' letter which was last night tabled in<br />
Hansard by former Labor Minister Clyde Cameron. For the last<br />
two days Mr. Street has been closely questioned by the Opposition<br />
about the exact circumstances which led to his office selectively<br />
distributing copies to members of the Press Gallery after the<br />
existence of the letter had been revealed on our evening current<br />
affairs programme The Opposition wanted to know if<br />
Mr. Street as Minister had authorised the-release of the document<br />
to discredit Mr. Justice Staples. Yesterday in the House<br />
Mr. Street admitted that his staff had distributed copies, but he<br />
said only after they checked with the staff of the " PM" programme<br />
to confirm that they had a copy of the letter. Mr. Street said<br />
that because of the " 1PM" story the Staples letter had then<br />
become a matter of public record. As was stated on the " PM"<br />
programme last night, at the time the story went to air " PM" did<br />
not have a copy of that letter. However, they had sighted the<br />
copy and been able to confirm its authenticity. </p>

Af ter the broadcast, our Canberra of fice was approached by<br />
a member of Mr. Street's staff ana a member of the Canberra<br />
Press Gallery for a copy of the letter. They were told that<br />
we did not have a copy, but that we were seeking to obtain one<br />
to enable us to quote directly from it for a report to be<br />
broadcast the following morning on this programme.. At no stage<br />
did our Canberra office inform Mr. Street's office that a copy<br />
was in our possession, and no contact was made to our Melbourne'<br />
office from where the broadcast eminated, to establish whether<br />
a copy was being held there. Last night we approached Mr. Street's<br />
office for a reaction but we were told he had no comment.<br />
" AM" has learnt that a paper to be presented to the State Council<br />
of. the Liberal Party in South Australia next week includes a<br />
suggestion that candidates standing for office in union elections<br />
should have their political party affiliations alongside their<br />
name on the ballot paper.<br />
There will be no public transport in Victoria for the next<br />
48 hours. The State Transport Minister, Mr. McClelland,<br />
has warned the unions involved that they needn't think of<br />
returning to work at the weekend to pick up their penalty rates.<br />
He has denied that this would mean a lock-out of employees, but<br />
the situation is confused. There are no clear instructions from<br />
VicRail or the Tramways Board about weekend work at the end of<br />
the strike. Interview . with Jim Fraser of the Australian Railways'<br />
Union. Concern over the worsening oil crisis around the world is<br />
mounting in the United States. From Washington there are reports<br />
of a series of co-ordinated nationwide protests. One demonstration<br />
was on Capitol Hill where about 500 people gathered to condemn<br />
the leap in the price of petroleum.<br />
A survey conducted by the psychology department at Queensland<br />
University has produced evidence linking constant traffic noise<br />
in the home environment to ill health.<br />
Britain today outlined proposals which would.-establish the first<br />
British administration in Salisbury since Rhodesia unilaterally<br />
declared independence 14 years ago. The British Foreign Secretary<br />
proposed the appointment of a British Governor with civilian,<br />
military and police advisers supervising elections and legal<br />
independence when he met with the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe Rhodesia<br />
at Lancaster House. -The Patriotic Front, which has refused to<br />
acdept the first stage of the constitutional proposals was not<br />
present. Even if Mr. Mugabe and Mr. Nkomo do rejoin the talks<br />
it appears that white farmers in Rhodesia won't accept terms of<br />
compensation fund for land reforms. Interview with Vice-President<br />
of National Farmer's Union in Salisbury.<br />
There is a lot of speculation in Moscow at the moment about a<br />
shift in Russian policy towards the Middle East, following a visit<br />
to*. the Soviet Union by the Syrian President. The Soviet President<br />
has not met with the Syrian President leading to rumours that<br />
his health has worsened. </p>

In 1951 the CIA was considering using foreigners for dangerous<br />
