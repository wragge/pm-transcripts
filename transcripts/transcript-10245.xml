17 February 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ADDRESS AT OFFICIAL LUNCHEON<br />
PARLIAMENT BUILDINGS<br />
WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND<br />
E O E<br />
Well, thank you very much Prime Minister; to Mrs Bolger; to Mr Winston Peters, the<br />
Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand; to Helen Clark, the Leader of the Opposition;<br />
your Eminence; other distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It is a very special pleasure for me to be here today. Jim Bolger and I have known<br />
each other for a long time. He was, in fact, the first leader of an overseas country to<br />
speak to me after the change of government in Australia. And we've met on a number<br />
of occasions, first in Australia and subsequently at two overseas gatherings since the<br />
change of government in my country.<br />
And I want to echo everything that Jim had to say about the easy naturalness of the<br />
relationship between our two countries, our two peoples and our two societies.<br />
There are very deep and intricate bonds of history and tradition and culture and shared<br />
experience and common values which bring our two countries together. It is not, of<br />
course, a relationship embedded entirely in nostalgia and in the past. In fact, what<br />
gives the relationship added moment in the 1990s is that it is a modern, contemporary<br />
relationship built upon the shared interests of the two countries in the Asia-Pacific<br />
region, a recognition that we have to work together in that region if we are to realise<br />
our full potential. And also our common experiences over the past decade with<br />
economic reform.<br />
As the Prime Minister of New Zealand said, both of our societies and economies have<br />
something of a history in tariff barriers and industry protection. The idea that you<br />
could build fortress economies, secure against the competitive incursions of the rest of<br />
the world, now those illusions have been swept away in both Australia and New<br />
Zealand. And there are many people in Australia who admire greatly the strides </p>
<p>towards opening up the New Zealand economy which have occurred over the last<br />
or 15 years. And New Zealand richly deserves the reputation that it earned from many<br />
around the world as being something of a role model of necessary economic reform<br />
against the background of very great challenge and very great difficulty.<br />
I have followed that change with great interest. Some might say that we are now, in<br />
Australia, beginning to implement some of the reforms that were implemented in New<br />
Zealand in the 1980s. Whilst that may not be an entirely fair observation to make, it is<br />
fair to say that in one crucial area in which I've taken a very deep interest over a long<br />
period of time that is industrial relations reform we passed legislation through our<br />
Parliament at the end of last year which largely implemented the policy that we took to<br />
the last election. And whilst it is dissimilar from your legislation in some respects, the<br />
central thrust of giving more authority to employers and employees at the workplace<br />
level to make their own bargains, getting rid of compulsory unionism, restoring<br />
effective secondary boycott legislation, allowing the emergence of enterprise unions,<br />
all of those things are very similar to what you have implemented.<br />
And, of course, it's not only in economics that things have changed. For the first time<br />
ever in the history of Australian and New Zealand sporting contests, the Bledislo Cup<br />
will not be played at Ballimore or the Sydney sports stadium, it will be played at the<br />
Melbourne Cricket Ground. And that in itself holds outs the tantalising prospect that<br />
the world record crowd to watching a rugby union encounter between two great rugby<br />
playing nations will in fact be established in the home and the birth place of Australian<br />
Rules football. It is one of those I mean, bear in the mind that they have the world<br />
record rugby league crowd, which was 87 000 in the match between Australia and<br />
Great Britain. So, things have changed also on the sporting field.<br />
The Prime Minister mentioned our shared interest in the Asia-Pacific region. The<br />
world has changed very much so far as our associations are concerned. Australia sees<br />
her economic future very much bound up with the most dynamic economic part of the<br />
world. And the commitment of my Government is just as deep and just as genuine and<br />
just as Intense as the commitment of the Hawke and Keating Government's and indeed<br />
the Fraser Government before that towards deepening our relationships with the<br />
nations of the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
But as I've frequently said since becoming Australian Prime Minister, we do not need<br />
to choose between our history and our geography. And there is nothing in the<br />
necessity and the desirability of our close association with the nations of the Asia-<br />
Pacific region that dictates for a moment that we should lessen those ties between<br />
Australia and the nations of Europe and the nations of North America which continue<br />
to be of such relevance, not only in a culture and historical sense but also in an<br />
economic and a trade sense.<br />
We do, in Australia, place a very significant emphasis on what I call the defence<br />
investment. In our first budget, against the background of having to make cuts in<br />
other areas, we quarantined the defence budget from any expenditure cuts. And that<br />
same approach will apply to our forthcoming budget which will be brought down in<br />
May. We regard that strong investment in defence as being a very important element<br />
of the influence that we can project in the region. It is also an important concomitant </p>
<p>to the association between Australia and the United States, an association which at all<br />
levels has been very greatly strengthened and reinvigorated since the change of<br />
government. I share the Prime Minister's remarks about the importance of the CDR relationship<br />
between Australia and New Zealand. It is a relationship which imposes obligations on<br />
both of us.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, the most important thing about our relationship is, of course,<br />
the values and beliefs that as societies we share in common. Australia and New<br />
Zealand are two of only eight nations which have been continuously democratic for the<br />
whole of the 20th Century. And that in itself is a remarkable tribute to our two<br />
societies and it is a remarkable tribute to the foresight of those who put together the<br />
constitutional instruments that govern our two societies. And it is a reminder that as<br />
we face the world together, not always agreeing on everything but fundamentally<br />
sharing the same goals and the same objectives, that we do so from the vantage point<br />
of having been reliably informed democracies for a very long period of time.<br />
Our problems domestically are very similar. Our opportunities domestically and<br />
internationally are also very similar. And the links that bind us together at a people-topeople<br />
level are of course too numerous even to begin to mention at a gathering such<br />
as this.<br />
I want to say, Jim, I have enjoyed the opportunity of spending many hours talking to<br />
you in an informal and relaxed fashion about the problems and the challenges of<br />
contemporary government in our two countries. In the international exchanges<br />
between leaders of countries there is nothing more valuable than the chance in a<br />
relaxed and informal fashion to talk at length, as both of us did on Saturday night,<br />
about the challenges of the Native Title legislation in Australia and the experience of<br />
New Zealand in a comparable area. Of course the historical and legal basis of the<br />
relationship between the indigenous people of New Zealand and the rest of the New<br />
Zealand community is different from the relationship historically and legally between<br />
the indigenous people of Australia and the rest of the Australian community. But that<br />
doesn't alter the fact that in my country I'm seeking an outcome that delivers two<br />
things; it delivers justice and it delivers predicability and certainty to all of those who<br />
are involved. And I've found both in that area and the many other areas that we have<br />
touched upon a great source of advice and shared experiences from the discussions<br />
that we have held.<br />
So in all of those ways it has been for me, Mr Prime Minister, a very valuable<br />
experience. Of course as a amateur political scientist as well as a practicing politician,<br />
I observe with some interest your new political system. I will continue to observe it<br />
with immense interest because it does represent a very interesting and significant<br />
departure, but nonetheless one that the New Zealand people have embraced and one<br />
which I know those who participate in the system will use and exercise in the way in<br />
which it should be. And I think all of us can gain inevitably from the experience of<br />
others. I don't contemplate such a change in Australia. But then we have States and<br />
we have a Federal Senate. So we have our own sort of differences already without<br />
taking upon ourselves other differences. But whatever the method of delivering the </p>
<p>democratic will of the New Zealand people is or whatever delivering the democratic<br />
will of the Australian people may be, nothing can alter the fact that we are ongoing and<br />
thorough going democracies in the best sense of the word.<br />
But most importantly for this occasion I bring you the good wishes, the very warm<br />
good wishes, of the Australian people to this gathering. It is the most natural thing in<br />
the world for Australians and New Zealanders to be friendly. It has an easy informal<br />
intimacy, the relationship between Australia and New Zealand. But as Dr Johnson<br />
bade us to do, we should always keep our friendship whether they are at a personal<br />
level or at a national level, we should always keep our friendships in good repair. We<br />
should never take a natural alliance for granted. We should never presume to draw<br />
upon the stored good will of past common experiences to maintain momentum<br />
indefinitely into the future. We should always find new ways of expressing the<br />
affection we have for each other without in any way demeaning the old and traditional<br />
affiliations. And I think that is what we are doing in our relationship, particularly in the<br />
shared experience of learning effectively to compete in a globalised world economy,<br />
learning to take on the best of the rest of the world and to hold our own and learning<br />
to share the experiences that competitive endeavour brings.<br />
And to you, Jim and Joan, may I personally thank you very warmly for the great<br />
hospitality that you've extended to me and to my Party. We have enjoyed it greatly.<br />
And we shall take back to Australia some very pleasant recollections of the past couple<br />
of days. It has been immensely enjoyable. And I hope it has made a small contribution<br />
to further strengthening the already deep ties of association and affection between our<br />
two countries and our two societies. Thank you. </p>
