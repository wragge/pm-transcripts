EMBARGO: 7.00 p. m.<br />
PRIM MUTAINISTE<br />
FOR PRESS 11 DECEMBER 1977<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
I would like to thank the people of Australia for the confidence<br />
they have -shown in my Government. They have shown that<br />
confidence because the Government has operated as a team.<br />
Nobody could have been a better lieutenant than Doug. Anthony, the<br />
Deputy Prime Minister.<br />
. All the members of the team have worked with a common purpose,<br />
a common objective and a common wish -and that is to serve<br />
Australia and overcome-the economic problems that Australia faces,.<br />
I also believe that the depth of the vote is attributable<br />
to the capacity of the Australian people to judge the merit of<br />
policies even though difficult decisions are involved.<br />
I-would like to repeat something I said two years ago,-. the<br />
purpose-of my Government is to govern for all the people of Australia<br />
wherever they may be, whatever walk of life, whatever job they<br />
undertake, whether they are third, or fourth, or fifth generation<br />
Australians, or whether they have recently come here from<br />
_ other lands.,<br />
The purpose of my Government is to govern with fairness and<br />
justice for all groups, for all people. I renew that pledge.<br />
We still have substantial economic problems to overcome.<br />
In the three years ahead I have not the slightest doubt that<br />
* Australians-working together will be able to overcome those problems.<br />
But. I also want to' commit my-Government to another objectiveto-:<br />
reach orut beyond the bounds of politics, to seek to emphasise<br />
* those . things that ought to unite all Australians in common purposes,<br />
and in common objectives, emphasising those matters which<br />
make Australia a great nation.<br />
If we can do that we can lessen the divisions between us and increase<br />
the sense of national identity and common purpose.<br />
Finishing the task of overcoming Australia's economic problems and<br />
reaching out for that much wider objective are the two major<br />
objectives before us. o../ 2 </p>
<p>At the same time we will continue to seek to remove areas of<br />
disadvantage in Australia, to enhance individual liberty and<br />
to seek justice for all Australians.<br />
I commit my Government for the<br />
these objectives. next three years to work towards -ML </p>
