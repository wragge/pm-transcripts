    <content><![CDATA[<p>Pacific Commonwealth Leaders meeting in Auckland, New Zealand, on the occasion of the Pacific Islands Forum, noted their grave concern at the situation in Zimbabwe, in particular continuing serious human rights abuses and the worsening economic crisis affecting its people.</p>
<p>They recognised with appreciation the determined efforts of the members of the Commonwealth Troika on Zimbabwe and of the Secretary-General to engage the Government of Zimbabwe in constructive dialogue.</p>
<p>Leaders noted with deep regret that the Secretary-General's March 2003 report to the Commonwealth Troika could detect no progress by Zimbabwe on the issues set out in the Marlborough House Statement of 19 March 2002. They further registered strong disappointment that their own 2002 call for the rule of law to be restored in Zimbabwe, for political dialogue to be resumed, and for political violence to be brought to an end remained unheeded.</p>
<p>Pacific Commonwealth Leaders asserted the right of the people of Zimbabwe, consistent with Commonwealth democratic values and human rights standards, to live in peace, security and prosperity, ruled by a government of their own free choice. They called upon the Commonwealth to continue to work diligently with all parties to achieve the restoration of democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Recognising the critical need for genuine land reform in Zimbabwe, they repeated their call for land resettlement to be implemented in a transparent, equitable and sustainable manner in collaboration with the UNDP, consistent with previous commitments.</p>
<p>They noted that the Abuja CHOGM in December 2003 would permit an objective discussion of Zimbabwe's current suspension from the Councils of the Commonwealth, including further action that may be required to address the deteriorating situation. Leaders considered that concrete and practical responses by the Zimbabwe authorities, as called for by the Commonwealth, were urgently required by the suffering people of Zimbabwe. Such responses were also essential prerequisites for any return by Zimbabwe to full membership of the organisation and respect for its core values.</p>
