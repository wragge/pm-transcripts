    <content><![CDATA[<p>I will travel to Jakarta on March 7 to attend the first Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) Leaders’ Summit to discuss economic growth, regional stability and the importance of countering violent extremism in the Indian Ocean region.</p>
<p>We have a fundamental interest in ensuring economic development in the Indian Ocean region and enhancing dialogue on shared security challenges.</p>
<p>Australia, a founding IORA member 20 years ago, is committed to playing our part in improving regional networks to help build the future security and prosperity of the region.</p>
<p>I welcome Indonesia’s proposal for an IORA Concord – a statement of our shared values and objectives, including a commitment to international law and promoting regional economic growth.</p>
<p>While I am in Jakarta I will also meet with Australian delegates to Indonesia Australia Business Week, which showcases the business opportunities Indonesia presents. I am a strong supporter of building the trade and economic relationship between Australia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>This visit also coincides with the 10th anniversary of the Garuda plane crash in Yogyakarta in March 2007, in which five Australians died. We remember them, and the other victims of the crash, and offer our continued condolences to their families and friends.</p>
