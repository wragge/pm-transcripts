DJAKARTA<br />
SPEECH GIVEN BY PRESIDENT SUHARTO AT STATE<br />
DINNER IN HONOUR OF THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME<br />
MINISTER, MR. JOHN GORTON 13 JUNE 1968<br />
Your Excellency Mr. Prime Minister and Mrs. Gorton, Your Excellencies,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen:-May 1, on behalf of the Government and the people of Indonesia,<br />
once again express our pleasure and appreciation for Your Excellency's<br />
acceptance of our invitation to visit Indonesia. This constitutes one of the<br />
most important visits to us, for Australia is one of Indonesia's closest<br />
neighbours. Our very close geographical propinquity makes it one of the most<br />
significant aspects for the future development of our two nations.<br />
Indeed, during the past few years the relations between our two<br />
countries were not at their best and at certain periods it was even quite clouded.<br />
However, right now we thank God Almighty those days have passed. We are<br />
now entering a new period and a hopeful future. It has now become our mutual<br />
responsibility to give substance to the future; something that is beneficial to<br />
our common inter ests which we should realize jointly as far as possible and<br />
on the basis of equality.<br />
National independence and the peoples' sovereignty are basic<br />
principles to which we fully adhere. We maintain and at the same time apply<br />
these principles in our attitude towards other nations in the world. Therefore,<br />
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity from Sabang to Merauke<br />
are for the Indonesian people matters of principle. In order to realize those<br />
principles the Indonesian people have fought for hundreds of years sacrificing<br />
all they could offer. The fight for freedom has culminated in the proclamation<br />
of our independence, but our struggle had still to be continued years after. Up<br />
to the present moment, the Indonesian people have still to endure the<br />
consequences of their sacrifice in the effort to achieve their territorial integrity.<br />
One of them is the people's plight in the economic field. We are therefore<br />
determined to defend whatever we have achieved painfully. Despite the burning<br />
spirit of our nationalism, the pantja sila, which is the basic Indonesian<br />
philosophy, will guarantee that it remains a sound one. Nationalism based on<br />
pantja sila will stem the greed for territorial expansion.<br />
To the Indonesian people, independence, sovereignty and<br />
territorial integrity are very important principles; they do not only constitute<br />
our rights and honour, but they also serve as one of the important instruments<br />
for nation building in its broadest sense. I am confident that the Australian<br />
people will understand what I have just said, as they did when the Indonesian<br />
people fought to uphold and maintain their independence in 1945, which they<br />
fully supported, and to which they rendered their concrete assistance. For<br />
all this, on this occasion, the Indonesian people once again wish to express<br />
their high est appreciation and profound gratitude.<br />
Much has happened since the Indonesian people achieved<br />
independence and many changes have occurred in the world and around our<br />
territory. After going through various stages of developments and serious<br />
ordeals, the Indonesian people have now regained their genuine ideals of<br />
independence and we are doing our utmost to substantiate that independence<br />
with the welfare of the people. In our effort to give substance to our<br />
independence by way of reconstruction, we are aware of the necessity to<br />
maintain stability in South East Asia. This stability is to be based upon the<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>principles of national independence and the people's sovereignty by which<br />
genuine good-neighbour policy can be established.<br />
In this wo rid, that still contains greed to influence other nations'<br />
internal affairs which in some instances were conducted by force of arms we<br />
also realize the necessity of a physical defence capable of protecting the Indonesian<br />
nation and our country's integrity. However, the Indonesian people believe that<br />
the means for defence, which are decisive and at the same time advantageous,<br />
are the conviction in its own national identity and the standard of prosperity of<br />
its people. In my opinion, such a good neighbour policy is sufficiently realistic<br />
and will always serve as a basis for the Indonesian nation in conducting its<br />
co-operation with friendly countriesi in particular with those in our immediate<br />
neighbourhood. We highly esteem the fact that recently Australia has paid a great<br />
deal of attention to problems encountered by the developing South East Asian<br />
nations, and in particular Indonesia. The developments that have occurred in<br />
Indonesia and the new outlook that has come about in the minds of the Australian<br />
people, to my belief, reflect a very favourable situation for our two nations.<br />
Let us maintain this very favourable atmosphere and transform it into a more<br />
concrete and effective mould. This mutual friendship and co-operation beneficial<br />
to our two nations, will certainly be significant not only for Australian and<br />
Indonesia, but also for the sake of this region's stability and the more so it<br />
will positively contribute to the peace in the world. I pray that my hopes will<br />
become a reality in the not too distant future.<br />
Finally, may I invite Your Excellency, Your Excellencies,<br />
ladies and gentlemen to raise your glasses and to toast to the health of Her<br />
Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, and also the health of Your Excellency, the Prime<br />
Minister, Mrs. Gorton, and the distinguished members of the Prime Minister's<br />
party. Thank you. </p>
