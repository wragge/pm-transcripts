AU -L7 t<br />
FOR PRESS 31 DECEMBER 1978<br />
NEW YEAR'S MESSAGE<br />
On Christmas Day I left Australia to discuss world trade and<br />
economic issues with the leaders of a diverse group of prominent<br />
developed and developing nations from North America, South America,<br />
Europe, Africa and the Caribbean.<br />
The meeting was convened by the Prime Minister of Jamaica,<br />
Mr Michael Manley, a leading figure in the Commonwealth and<br />
of the developing nations.<br />
It was also attended by Chancellor Schmidt of the Federal Republic<br />
of Germany; President Obansanjo of Nigeria, Africa's largest<br />
nation; Pierre Trudeau, Prime M4inister of Canada; President Peres<br />
of Venezuela; and Prime Minister Nordli of Norway, a country at<br />
the forefront of Official Development Assistance for the<br />
developing world.<br />
The leaders of this diverse, yet broadly representative group<br />
of nations met because of the need to depart from the rigid<br />
structure so common now in international discussion. We wanted<br />
to discuss openly and plainly the international economic problems<br />
of our time how to achieve a greater rate of progress for the<br />
developing countries, how to tackle the issue of market growth,<br />
how to ensure greater access to markets and how to stabilize<br />
international commodity trade upon which most of the developing<br />
world depend for thelir livelihood and well-being.<br />
These areas concern Australia. While we are a relatively<br />
advanced industrial nation we have much interest in common<br />
with the developing world.<br />
We are a member of a developing region. We share with many<br />
developing nations the fact that we are a significant exporter<br />
of commodities.<br />
All of us are significantly affected by the level and grow,% th of<br />
world trade.<br />
The Jamaica meeting might well have been the first at which<br />
leaders of representative developed and developing nations informally<br />
addressed themselves to world economic problems. / 2 </p>
<p>Significantly, they first and foremost jointly recognized in<br />
the clearest possible terms that inflation was the common<br />
enemy and that even greater efforts needed to be made to<br />
overcome its corrosive effects.<br />
All our experiences bore out the fact that inflation undermined<br />
investment and consumer confidence and directly increased<br />
unemployment.<br />
We were particularly concerned that inflation reduces the growth<br />
of domestic markets and hinders expansion of world trade.<br />
Further, it generates domestic pressures for increased protection,<br />
further reducing trade and access to markets. Inflation limits<br />
expansion of world trade which is so sorely needed if world<br />
economic recovery is to be assured and poverty throughout the<br />
world is to be reduced.<br />
Discussions at Jamaica clearly brought out the interdependence<br />
between the economic health of the advanced industrial nations<br />
and the opportunities for increased growth in the developing<br />
world. All the leaders at Jamaica agreed that if greater progress is<br />
to be made in improving access to markets, if we are to generate<br />
new market growth and if we are to raise the standard of living<br />
throughout the world we must vigorously combat inflation, both<br />
nationally and internationally.<br />
We also examined at length the methods by which further progress<br />
could be made in the establishment of a Common Fund designed<br />
to stabilize prices in commodities, and the prospects for a<br />
successful and balanced outcome to the MTN.<br />
Further, we gave attention to improving international financial<br />
institutions, particularly those designed to assist developing<br />
nations in protecting their balance of payments situations from<br />
significant falls in commodity prices.<br />
This was not a negotiating conference. We met to discuss matters<br />
informally. Consequently, there was no commitment to rigid<br />
pre-conceived positions.<br />
There was an exploration and exchange of ideas and an increase<br />
of understanding between the diverse countries represented at<br />
the conference.<br />
Even though some highly sensitive issues were raised they were<br />
always discussed openly and with tolerance.<br />
All the government leaders felt the meeting was highly successful<br />
and that it would be beneficial for other groups of developed<br />
and developing nations to meet in a similar way to exchange views<br />
and to achieve a better understanding of problems. / 3<br />
2 </p>
<p>3<br />
Negotiations on a Common Fund will be resumed at a United Nations<br />
conference in March 1979, and I am confident that the Jamaica<br />
meeting will enable all of us to contribute better to a<br />
successful resolution of outstanding Common Fund issues.<br />
The Jamaica meeting was an encouraging note on which to end 1978.<br />
It demonstrated political leaders' tolerance, understanding and<br />
willingness to go beyond politics and promote interest common<br />
to all mankind.<br />
I am certain that all Australians will join me in hoping that<br />
this approach will be carried in to the new year.<br />
Some people believe that knocking is part of the Australian<br />
tradition. Today, we are faced with national and international issues which<br />
are of 3reat moral and priactical significance. If we set<br />
aside politics and work together we can advance our nation's<br />
welfare and c-etribute greatly to the resolution of international<br />
issues of fundamental importance. 000---</p>
