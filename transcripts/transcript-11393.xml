<p> taxation reform, trade liberalisation, Supermarket to Asia</p>
<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>Well thank you very much Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen. I'm</p>
<p> very happy to be here this morning to talk to you about a number of</p>
<p> things, most particularly of course to congratulate the industry on</p>
<p> the progress made over the last year, to remark upon its enormous</p>
<p> contribution to the Australian economy, and also to thank it very</p>
<p> warmly for the constructive forward looking attitude it's adopted</p>
<p> towards reform causes in this country over the last few years, and</p>
<p> not the least taxation reform, a subject to which I will return in</p>
<p> a few moments.</p>
<p>This gathering takes place at a time when on any measure the Australian</p>
<p> economy is performing exceptionally well. Without, I hope, displaying</p>
<p> any complacency or hubris it is fair to say that right at the moment</p>
<p> we have the best economic conditions for about 30 years. We are seen</p>
<p> as a strong economy in our region. We are seen as an economy that</p>
<p> has developed strong effective and transparent financial institutions</p>
<p> which have stood us in good stead in the wake of the Asian economic</p>
<p> downturn. We have been able to look that downturn in the face and</p>
<p> stare it down. We do have our lowest inflation and interest rate levels</p>
<p> since the late 1960s.</p>
<p>There is a sense in which the Australian economy has got it together</p>
<p> like no other period that I've lived through in the period that</p>
<p> I've been in public life. And that has not been through any accident.</p>
<p> It has been the result of reforms undertaken in earlier years. And</p>
<p> it's a very important message we keep in mind right at the moment.</p>
<p> Today's economic strength is the product of yesterday's</p>
<p> economic reform. Tomorrow's economic strength will be ours if</p>
<p> we undertake reforms today. The idea that you can ever rest on your</p>
<p> oars, the idea that you can ever say well, "she'll be right</p>
<p> mate, it's good enough now, we don't need to do anymore"</p>
<p> - that is a very foolish notion.</p>
<p>And just as three years ago when I became Prime Minister there was</p>
<p> a sense in this community, in Australia, that when you looked at the</p>
<p> Asian-Pacific region it was almost a rich man's club and Australia</p>
<p> was almost knocking on the door seeking admission. I had businessmen</p>
<p> saying to me Â you know, you should model the Australian economy</p>
<p> on some of the economies in Asia. You should intervene more the way</p>
<p> they do. I even had some people seriously advocate the Malaysian model</p>
<p> of business intervention as the way to go. And that was quite a strong</p>
<p> mood in sections of the Australian business community a couple of</p>
<p> years ago. I used to get a lot of lectures about it. You don't</p>
<p> do enough. You ought to copy what's happening in the region.</p>
<p>I don't think anybody would give me that advice now. And the</p>
<p> reason why they wouldn't give that advice now is that we were</p>
<p> prepared to undertake some reforms and we got our position very strong.</p>
<p> We got that budget back into balance; we made a lot of other changes;</p>
<p> we updated our financial sector reforms; we made big changes to industrial</p>
<p> relations. In fact the changes made to industrial relations were much</p>
<p> greater than they were ever given credit for by many of our opponents</p>
<p> in the Opposition or in the media. And those changes to industrial</p>
<p> relations have laid the foundation for higher levels of productivity</p>
<p> in Australia at the moment. Australian workers are better off now</p>
<p> than they've been for 20 years. And they're better off for</p>
<p> two reasons. Their interest rates are lower. That means their mortgage</p>
<p> bills are $320 a month less than what they were three years ago. $320</p>
<p> a month on average and that's a huge cut in anybody's housing</p>
<p> mortgage bill. And their real wages have gone up.</p>
<p>That's the basis of the consumer prosperity in this country at</p>
<p> the moment. That is why consumer sales are strong, because Australian</p>
<p> workers have got money in their pockets because of those two developments.</p>
<p> Now that hasn't happened by accident. But it won't continue</p>
<p> forever if we don't make other economic reforms. If we just say</p>
<p> well, we've done enough, it will continue. It won't continue</p>
<p> because Asia will resurge. The competitors will return. They'll</p>
<p> pull themselves up off the mat and they'll start fighting again</p>
<p> and we'll have to be in there bigger and better and more effective</p>
<p> than them in the future.</p>
<p>Economic performance is not a retrospection. Economic performance</p>
<p> is about beating the fellow in the same race as you at any given time.</p>
<p> And that is the lesson that Australia has to always understand. And</p>
<p> that's why we committed ourselves to industrial relations reform,</p>
<p> to economic reform. It is why we've committed ourselves to the</p>
<p> cause of taxation reform. And I was reflecting this morning on the</p>
<p> five principles that the Government set itself back in August of 1997,</p>
<p> almost two years ago, when we began in earnest the journey towards</p>
<p> giving Australia a 21st century taxation system.</p>
<p>We said a number of things. First and foremost we said that there</p>
<p> would be no overall rise in the burden of taxation under our proposal.</p>
<p> And there has not been. The second thing we said was that there should</p>
<p> be major personal income tax cuts, particularly for Australians with</p>
<p> the responsibilities of raising children. And our package delivers</p>
<p> that. A core element of our package was the promise made to middle</p>
<p> Australia, middle Australia bringing up children. The backbone of</p>
<p> our society. The people who are part of the aspirational element of</p>
<p> the Australian community that is so important to our well being. And</p>
<p> these are people earning $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 a year. They're</p>
<p> not wealthy. That's not wealthy. That's just a modest degree</p>
<p> of success with the hope of doing better. And that's very much</p>
<p> part of the Australian psyche. And they deserve recognition and they</p>
<p> deserve reward and that's why one of the key elements of our</p>
<p> package was that you could say that 80% of Australian taxpayers would</p>
<p> be on a top marginal rate of no more than 30 cents in the dollar.</p>
<p> And I think that's a pretty good goal to offer to middle Australia.</p>
<p> Not wealthy Australia, middle Australia, which is most of us, which</p>
<p> is the backbone of our community.</p>
<p>We also committed ourselves to fundamental reform of the Commonwealth-State</p>
<p> financial understanding which has been a farce for 50 years. The annual</p>
<p> Premiers' conference in this city is one of the great farces</p>
<p> of Australian politics. Right on message the Premiers arrive, Labor</p>
<p> and Liberal alike. And they say the dirty rotten Federal Government</p>
<p> won't give us enough money. And if they don't get what they</p>
<p> want they go out the door and say we'll have to sack nurses and</p>
<p> teachers and police because the Federal Government won't give</p>
<p> us enough money. Well this Federal Government wants to give them more.</p>
<p> But the people who are supposed to represent them in the Senate at</p>
<p> the moment are sort of, we're not quite sure whether they're</p>
<p> going to let us give the State more. We're working on it, but</p>
<p> we're not quite sure they're going to do that.</p>
<p>But a key of this plan, a key of this plan is to allow a new charter</p>
<p> of CommonwealthÂState financial relations. And for the first</p>
<p> time in 50 years we have offered an end to the farce. We have offered</p>
<p> a system that will allow State revenues to grow in a way they can't</p>
<p> grow under the present formula. Because under our plan the States</p>
<p> will get every last dollar of the GST revenue, and that over time</p>
<p> will grow faster than would the funds going to the States under the</p>
<p> current funding arrangement. Now that is an offer that no other group</p>
<p> of States has ever been made. And that is why Labor and Liberal alike,</p>
<p> they queued up, although a couple of them had a couple of them had</p>
<p> a few party political disclaimers like my colleague Bob Carr who said,</p>
<p> you know Prime Minister, I don't believe in any of this but where</p>
<p> do I sign. And he signed up because it's a good deal for his</p>
<p> State. And Peter Beattie signed up, and Jeff Kennett signed up. They</p>
<p> all signed up because it's a very good deal for their State.</p>
<p>One of the things that really perplexes and amazes me about this whole</p>
<p> debate, it has from the very beginning and still does to this day,</p>
<p> is that some of the fiercest critics of our plan are people from the</p>
<p> welfare sector, are people from ACOSS. And what they will stubbornly</p>
<p> refuse to accept and understand is that if you guarantee a rise in</p>
<p> State revenues over time, you guarantee a rise in the money available</p>
<p> to pay for hospitals, and schools, and roads, and community services</p>
<p> at a State level. If this plan falls over the States will have less</p>
<p> money in the future to pay for welfare. Let me say that again, if</p>
<p> this plan falls over in future the States will have less money to</p>
<p> look after the poor.</p>
<p>And yet some of the strongest critics of this plan are people who</p>
<p> hold themselves out as the guardians of the poor. Well, on this issue</p>
<p> they are not serving the poor of Australia well. There's no other</p>
<p> way that we can guarantee a rising revenue base for welfare in this</p>
<p> country without fundamental taxation reform. And if the opportunity</p>
<p> is lost then the poor in the long run will suffer proportionately</p>
<p> more than many others in the community. And I believe that very strongly</p>
<p> and it's one of the reasons why we are so very strongly committed.</p>
<p> And you can't have it any other way. You can't, on the one</p>
<p> hand, say you are interested long-term in the position of the poor</p>
<p> and yet prevent a mechanism that will underwrite rising revenues for</p>
<p> them.</p>
<p>Now, we all believe in a compassionate society. We believe in a society</p>
<p> that offers people incentive through lower taxes if they work harder</p>
<p> and earn more. That's the aspirational side of it. And we all</p>
<p> believe in that. My Party believes in it. It believes in it passionately.</p>
<p> You can't have an Australian society unless you reward the achievers</p>
<p> and you encourage people to lift themselves from an income of $25,000</p>
<p> to $50,000 without going into a higher tax bracket. Imagine the impact</p>
<p> of that on the work aspirations of our young adult children. You say,</p>
<p> well, you can move ahead like that without going into a higher tax</p>
<p> bracket. That's the aspirational side of it. But there's</p>
<p> also a compassionate side of it. And that compassionate of it says</p>
<p> that there are some in the community who need help. And there are</p>
<p> also services in the community that are needed. We all need police</p>
<p> services. We need government schools. We need people to have choice.</p>
<p> If they want to send their kids to government schools which are funded</p>
<p> by the States, those States need revenue. And the problem is that</p>
<p> those revenue sources are shrinking and you've got to find an</p>
<p> alternative and the only alternative is taxation reform and a broad-based,</p>
<p> indirect tax. It's a very stark choice and I just hope that it</p>
<p> is a choice that is fully understood by the entire Australian community.</p>
<p>We also said, when I announced that taxation plan, that we believed</p>
<p> in providing compensation and assistance under the package for those</p>
<p> who needed help and, of course, we have very, very significantly provided</p>
<p> for that. And, of course, the final thing we committed ourselves and</p>
<p> of which I've dwelt for a few moments is that we committed ourselves</p>
<p> to the introduction of a broad-based, indirect tax - a GST, to replace</p>
<p> some or all of the existing indirect taxes. And that, of course, is</p>
<p> precisely what our plan has sought to do.</p>
<p>We fought an election on that plan. We won an election on that plan.</p>
<p> And we are urging the Australian Parliament to support that plan because</p>
<p> we believe it is in the long-term interests of the country. And we</p>
<p> believe it is important that the country have the political and institutional</p>
<p> courage to embrace ongoing reform. Because we are where we are now</p>
<p> and we are strong as we are now because we reformed in earlier years.</p>
<p> And a similar gathering in five years time if we haven't embraced</p>
<p> tax reform, we'll look back and say, wasn't that a failure</p>
<p> of nerve and a betrayal of the national interest on our leaders that</p>
<p> they didn't embrace taxation reform when they had the opportunity</p>
<p> to do so. It won't easily come again this opportunity.</p>
<p>We've been at it as a community, debating tax reform, for almost</p>
<p> as long as I've been in Parliament. We've been going on</p>
<p> the current reform for almost two years and it's undergone the</p>
<p> most exhaustive debate, the most exhaustive examination and analysis.</p>
<p> And all the resources of the Federal Treasury have been poured into</p>
<p> it and it's been the subject of a debate from one end of the</p>
<p> country to the other. And sooner or later and I believe inevitably</p>
<p> of course sooner that we have to make a decision. And if the decision</p>
<p> is that we turn our back on reform the nation will be the poorer,</p>
<p> the loser, and that will become apparent fairly rapidly. And many</p>
<p> of those in whose name objections have been raised against this package</p>
<p> will suffer more as a consequence than they are allowed or led to</p>
<p> believe by many of the people who choose to speak on their behalf.</p>
<p>You may gather from those remarks that I'm rather committed to</p>
<p> the cause of taxation reform. I am because I think it is good for</p>
<p> Australia. And that is why the Government, from myself down, remains</p>
<p> very committed to taxation reform. But we are dealing with a system</p>
<p> that doesn't automatically let you through the checkout even</p>
<p> though you've completed the purchase.</p>
<p>But, ladies and gentlemen, can I just say one or two other things</p>
<p> unrelated to the issue of taxation reform. And that really goes very</p>
<p> much to your own industry and the contribution that it makes to the</p>
<p> Australian economy. The very great capacity that it has to grow over</p>
<p> the years ahead. The contribution that it's made to the image,</p>
<p> the clean green image, of this country. The contribution that it's</p>
<p> made to the positive and favourable impressions that people have of</p>
<p> the lifestyle of the Australian community.</p>
<p>I know that trade liberalisation is very important to many sections</p>
<p> of your industry. And one of the very first things that I did as Prime</p>
<p> Minister was establish the Supermarket to Asia Council, which I chair</p>
<p> on a regular basis. And that Supermarket to Asia Council was designed</p>
<p> to promote, in a holistic way, the favourable image of Australia as</p>
<p> a great source of food of all types and of all stages of preparation</p>
<p> to the nations of the Asian Pacific region recognising that despite</p>
<p> the interruption by the downturn in Asia there is an enormous purchasing</p>
<p> capacity in that region. And we're contributing another $14 million</p>
<p> in the 1999 budget which includes a new $9.2 million food and fibre</p>
<p> supply chain to help our food industry respond to new export opportunities.</p>
<p> And we have contributed almost $100 million in additional funding</p>
<p> since coming to government for quarantine to protect our clean green</p>
<p> reputation and to boost our food exports.</p>
<p>But part of the responsibility we have as a government is to continue</p>
<p> to press for trade liberalisation. It still remains monumentally unacceptable</p>
<p> to me as Prime Minister of Australia that agricultural exports remain</p>
<p> punished and discriminated against in major world markets. It is disturbing</p>
<p> in the extreme, for example, that there should be talk by the United</p>
<p> States' administration of imposing some kind of quota on the</p>
<p> import of Australian and New Zealand lamb in the United States. It</p>
<p> is a bit rich to get generic lectures from the American administration</p>
<p> about free trade and the glories thereof. And yet you could have such</p>
<p> a crude, old-fashioned, protective device as an import quota on Australian</p>
<p> and New Zealand lamb. It rivals the crude, protectionist effects of</p>
<p> the American Jones Act under which it's against American</p>
<p> law for ships whose keels have not been made in the United States</p>
<p> to ply the coast of the United States of America. And it's a</p>
<p> reminder that it's still a tough world out there for small countries</p>
<p> like Australia that have got to work together with other like-minded</p>
<p> countries in the Cairns group to expand the opportunities and to expand</p>
<p> the horizons for our exporters. But we continue to do that and Tim</p>
<p> Fischer as the Trade Minister is indefatigable in his efforts to expand</p>
<p> our trade opportunities and our trade horizons.</p>
<p>That's just another reminder that even though we're doing</p>
<p> fairly well at the moment economically you've got to keep fighting,</p>
<p> you've got to keep finding new ways of getting new markets. You</p>
<p> never rest. You never go to sleep on either reform or trying to find</p>
<p> a new market or trying to remove an existing inhibition or an existing</p>
<p> barrier because once you go to sleep on the watch somebody else sneaks</p>
<p> past you. And that has been our experience in the past. You find it</p>
<p> as the experience you have in your own economic and business circumstances.</p>
<p>But, ladies and gentlemen, overall conditions are strong. The general</p>
<p> business outlook in Australia is bright. Consumers are spending. Businessmen</p>
<p> and women are investing. People are taking risks, and that's</p>
<p> necessary. You have a government that is committed to reform. You</p>
<p> have a government that believes in the benefits of reform, not in</p>
<p> reform as an end in itself. You reform in order to deliver a stronger,</p>
<p> better economy and that has always been the goal and the objective</p>
<p> of our reform. But can I thank you for inviting me and can I declare</p>
<p> the meetings of this Council open.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
