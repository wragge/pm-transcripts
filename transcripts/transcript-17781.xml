Prime Minister Julia Gillard today met with His Excellency Mr Jia Qinglin, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.</p>
<p>The talks between the Prime Minister and Chairman Jia focused on Australia's comprehensive and constructive relationship with China and explored areas where the potential exists to enhance our strong cooperation.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and the Chairman discussed our shared commitment to working closely on regional and global challenges such as the global economic recovery and climate change. </p>
<p>They also talked about the many great opportunities in our $90 billion trading relationship.</p>
<p>After their meeting, the two witnessed the signing of four agreements to further expand the strong cooperation between Australia and China in education, people-to - people links, trade, resources and financial services.</p>
<p>The agreements were:</p>
<p> * 	A bilateral Arrangement on Higher Education and Qualifications Recognition to provide guidance for the recognition of each other's qualification for further study. This will support student, academic and professional mobility between China and Australia by facilitating mutual recognition of higher education degrees and qualifications, making it easier for students to pursue academic studies in eachother's countries.<br />
 * 	A bilateral Memorandum of Understanding on Establishing a China-Australia Forum to formalise existing arrangements for an informal, high-level dialogue that will bring together senior figures from government, business and academia to consider the entirety of the bilateral relationship and generate ideas that will help guide relations into the future.<br />
 * 	A commercial handover agreement to finalise Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Group's acquisition of the Sydney-based manufacturer and wholesaler of specialised underground coal mining equipment, Valley Longwall International Pty Ltd.<br />
 * 	A general cooperation agreement between EXIM Bank of China and Westpac Banking Corporation to promote close cooperation that builds on the respective market strengths of each company, particularly in natural resources and agriculture.</p>
<p>Chairman Jia's visit to Australia from 5 to 10 April 2011 takes in Perth, Canberra, Brisbane and Sydney. </p>
