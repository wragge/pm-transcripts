PROPOSALS FOR TASMANIAN EMPLOYMENT CREATION CONSEQUENT ON<br />
CESSATION OF THE GORDON-BELOW-FRANKLIN SCHEME<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke,-said today he<br />
advised the Tasmanian Premier, Mr Gray, on 12 October 1984<br />
of a number of projects nominated by the Commonwealth to<br />
be funded from the remaining amount of $ 9 million being<br />
provided by the Commonwealth for employment creation in<br />
Tasmania consequent upon the cessation of the<br />
Gordon-below-Franklin scheme. The Memorandum of<br />
Understanding signed by the Prime Minister and the Premier<br />
on 26 June 1984 provides for additional expenditure on<br />
employment generating on projects nominated by either<br />
Government and approved by the other.<br />
Mr Hawke said that the following projects, nominated by<br />
the Commonwealth under these arrangements, will both<br />
create much needed employment in Tasmania and provide<br />
worthwhile longer-term benefits to the people of Tasmania:<br />
Provision of community amenities on public housing<br />
estates and youth accommodation in major urban centres<br />
at a cost of about $ 1 million.<br />
Af" L6<br />
VW/ 1 I A le" </p>
<p>Additional Commonwealth funding would be provided for<br />
construction of neighbourhood houses or a combination<br />
of neighbourhood houses and community health centres<br />
on public housing estates at locations such as<br />
Mornington, Warrane, Goodwood and Chigwell. Funding<br />
would also be provided for construction of<br />
semi-self-contained accommodation for young'people in.<br />
the larger urban centres.<br />
In addition to providing immediate employment<br />
opportunities, these projects would provide much<br />
needed facilities for people seeking public housing<br />
and for young people in need of accommodation.<br />
Conservation and restoration of selected Commonwealth<br />
and other historic buildings and sites in Tasmania.<br />
The Commonwealth would carry out conservation and<br />
restoration works on a number of historic Commonwealth<br />
buildings, for example, the Customs House,<br />
Beaumaris House and Anglesea Barracks in Hobart, and<br />
the Ross and Campbelltown post offices, and also<br />
provide funds to the State for similar works on other<br />
historic buildings and sites throughout Tasmania which.<br />
are of heritage significance. one important project<br />
under consideration is the construction of a by-pass<br />
road and site fencing at the Port. Arthur historic site<br />
to avoid accidental traffic damage . to buildings and to<br />
lessen the potential for vandalism.<br />
F t-,-rY ~ r-. r </p>
<p>This proposal, involving Commonwealth funding of about<br />
$ 3 million, would provide employment for Tasmanians<br />
with a wide range of skills and contribute<br />
significantly to preserving Tasmania's heritage and to<br />
the further enhancement of Tasmania as a tourist<br />
destination. Construction of the Dunn Street Building, as an<br />
extension to the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery.<br />
This would provide urgently needed space for<br />
zoological and botanical collections and laboratories<br />
and other sections of the Museum. The Commonwealth is<br />
prepared to contribute $ 4 million towards the cost of<br />
constructing the building.<br />
Launceston sewerage and drainage improvements.<br />
The Commonwealth is prepared to contribute<br />
approximately $ 4 million for sewerage and drainage<br />
improvements fin Launceston, provided agreement can be<br />
reached with the Tasmanian Government and the<br />
Launceston City Council on an appropriate program of<br />
works and on shared funding arrangements to ensure<br />
that those works can be completed.-<br />
Provision of ABC television services to r emote or<br />
underserved communities. r~ I </p>
<p>This project would involve expenditure by the<br />
Commonwealth of about $ 1 million on the provision of<br />
translators to relay ABC-TV services to a number of<br />
Tasmanian localities where, due to their very<br />
difficult terrain, TV services are either unavailable<br />
or seriously inadequate. In the absence of this<br />
initiative, it is unlikely that these communities<br />
would receive such services until sometime after<br />
1986-87. Communities which may be considered for<br />
extension of services under this proposal could<br />
include New Norfolk, Maydena, Geeveston, Cygnet,<br />
Tarraleah and Triabunna. However, the final list of<br />
communities would need to be determined following<br />
further study in the coming weeks.<br />
While the total value of the Commonwealth's proposals<br />
exceeds the remaining amount of $ 9 million for employment<br />
creating purposes, the arrangements set out in the<br />
Memorandum of Understanding provide for consultations<br />
between the Commonwealth and Tasmanian Government for the<br />
purpose of agreeing on the allocation of the available<br />
funds to those projects which offer the greatest benefits<br />
to the people of Tasmania.<br />
Mr Hawke noted in this regard that the employment projects<br />
nominated by the Commonwealth would span many different<br />
regions and localities in Tasmania and-would'therefore<br />
provide employment opportunities and longer-term social<br />
and economic benefits to a wide range of Tasmanian people. </p>
<p>Mr Hawke also noted that he had advised Premier Gray on<br />
October 1984 that the Commonwealth had agreed to<br />
allocate a further $ 3 million for the development of<br />
Hobart Airport from the funds being provided by the<br />
Commonwealth for employment creation following the<br />
cessation of the Gordon-below-Franklin scheme. This<br />
brings to $ 6 million the amount allocated for the<br />
development of Hobart Airport under these arrangements and<br />
will enable fully laden Boeing 747-200 aircraft to operate<br />
direct services between Hobart and Singapore and Hobart<br />
and Auckland. </p>
