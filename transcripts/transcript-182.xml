PRICE OF SUGAR<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister, Rt. Hon. J-McEwen<br />
The Acting Prime Msinister, Mr. McEwen, announced<br />
today that the Commonwealth Government had closely studied the<br />
case submitted by the Premier of Queensland, Mr. Nicklin, on<br />
behalf of his Government and the su-, ar industry for an increase<br />
in the domestic price of sugar.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that the Commonwealth Goveriient had<br />
agreed that--. the Sugar Agreement should be amended to increase the<br />
wholesale price of refined sugar by an amount equivalent<br />
to an increase in the retail price of ld. lb.;<br />
this would make the new retail price lld. lb. in'<br />
capital cities;<br />
having in mind the probl ems of the canning fruit<br />
industry and the link of almost 30 years between it<br />
and the sugar industry, the domestic sugar rebates<br />
should be increased from 0 to : C5. 0. 0. per<br />
ton<br />
the Sugar Agreement-' should be amended to empower the<br />
Export Sugar Committee to vary option rates for export<br />
sugar rebate in accordance with the alteration in the<br />
wholesale sugar price and in the domestic rebate<br />
rate.<br />
Mvr. McEwen said that these three amendments would<br />
operate during the remaining period of the Sugar Agreement<br />
1956/ 61. The price increases would operate from Monday, 16th<br />
May, and the introduction of the changed rates of rebates would<br />
operate from 1st June.<br />
Mr. Nicklin had concurred in these proposals.<br />
Mr. McEwen added that as thie present Sugar Agreement<br />
would expire in August, 1961, and as renewal of the agreement<br />
would require a prior examination of the industry, the Government<br />
had decided that in due course a committee of inquiry would<br />
be appointed similar to the 1952 Sugar Industry Committee to<br />
investigate the circumstances of the sugar and fruit industries<br />
and their relationship with a view to preparation of a report<br />
before the end of the period of the present agreement.<br />
