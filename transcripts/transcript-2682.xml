REDISTRIBUTION OF STATES INTO ELECTORAL DIVISIONS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. William McMahon, CH, MP,<br />
in the House of Renresentatives 23 September 1972<br />
I desire to inform the House that as required by the<br />
Representation Act 1905-1964, the Chief Electoral Officer has<br />
ascertained the numbers of the people of the Commonwealth and the<br />
numbers of the people of the several States consequent upon the taking<br />
of the Census on 30 June 1971. Copies of the Chief Electoral Officer's<br />
certificate specifying the said numbers have been tabled.<br />
Pursuant to Sections 9 and 10 of the Representation Act, the<br />
Chief Electoral Officer has determined the number of members of the<br />
House of Representatiaves to be chosen for the several. States. As a<br />
result of that determination the representation for Western Australia<br />
will be increased by one member as from the first general election<br />
held after that State has been redistributed into electoral divisions.<br />
Section 25 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act provides as<br />
follows-A re-distribution of any State into divisions<br />
shall be made in the manner hereinbefore provided<br />
whenever directed by the Governor-General by<br />
proclamation. Such proclamation may be made<br />
whenever an alteration is made in the number<br />
of members of the House of Representatives<br />
to be elected for the State; and<br />
whenever in one-fourth of the divisions of<br />
the State the number of the electors differs<br />
from a quota ascertained in the manner provided<br />
in this nart to a greater extent than<br />
one-fifth more or one-fifth less; and<br />
at such other times as the Governor-General<br />
thinks fit.<br />
It will be noted that Western Australia qualifies for a<br />
redistribution under the provisions of Section </p>
<p>2.<br />
The Chief Electoral Officer has advised the Government that<br />
there is not now sufficient time to give effect to a redistribution<br />
of any State before the forthcoming House of Representatives elections.<br />
Nevertheless,-the Government believes that it has an obligation to<br />
set in motion the machinery for a redistribution of Western Australia<br />
so as to ensure that that State gains its entitlement of an extra<br />
member from-the beginning of the 29th. Parliament. The Government<br />
therefore proposes to recommend to the Governor-General the appointment<br />
of distribution commissioners for Western Australia.<br />
Although there has been some shift of population in the<br />
other States, there is no requirement at ' present for a redistribution<br />
in any State other than Western Australia and consideration in respect<br />
of those States will be deferred for the time being. </p>
