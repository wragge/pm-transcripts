<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>[Tape begins]... to New Zealand. These are important talks and</p>
<p> we had a most useful series of discussions yesterday. We covered many,</p>
<p> many issues. From my point of view it was very valuable to both cement</p>
<p> in the importance of 25 years of CER and it's really now the</p>
<p> time to see what CER can do in an outward looking sense and we had</p>
<p> a very useful discussion on free-trade opportunities both possibly</p>
<p> with the US, possibly South America, but both I think are very interested</p>
<p> in new opportunities and perhaps that's the next phase for CER.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard did security come up?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Oh yes, security always comes up, particularly in the region. And</p>
<p> we had quite a long discussion about East Timor and a very productive</p>
<p> discussion, I think we have a very similar view on East Timor. We</p>
<p> also of course talked about Bougainville where New Zealand has done</p>
<p> a first class job in a leadership role. There's still more to</p>
<p> be done there, and of course in a general sense it came up.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did you reach any conclusion on East Timor and sending in perhaps</p>
<p> peace keeping forces?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Well it's premature to be talking about peacekeeping forces.</p>
<p> We of course are arguing that the best outcome in the short-term is</p>
<p> a phased movement towards independence, preferably a period of autonomy</p>
<p> within Indonesia, so to be talking about peacekeeping forces at this</p>
<p> time is quite premature. Obviously Australia will play a major role</p>
<p> in the future of East Timor but we want to encourage the Indonesians</p>
<p> and the people of East Timor to reach an understanding and an outcome</p>
<p> that is going to provide the maximum economic and social stability</p>
<p> in that territory.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did you speak about the possibility, or potential, for joint operations</p>
<p> on aid or is it too early for East Timor?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>I think we recognise that Australia will play a significant role,</p>
<p> and New Zealand obviously is willing to play her part as well. I mean</p>
<p> the extent of that is a matter for New Zealanders to talk about, but</p>
<p> once again to be talking about the detail of a situation assuming</p>
<p> a certain outcome that we are arguing should be delayed, at the very</p>
<p> least, and perhaps not occur at all is inappropriate.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So that's the united position of Australia and New Zealand if</p>
<p> that is the outcome .....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>We would look to Australia. Obviously Australia is very close to Timor.</p>
<p> New Zealanders feel very strongly about this and would want to assist</p>
<p> in an appropriate way. I certainly have made it clear to the Prime</p>
<p> Minister that if there are obvious issues that emerge through the</p>
<p> Australian leadership role in Timor in association with Indonesia,</p>
<p> they would only have to approach us. But we would be looking to Australia</p>
<p> to give us advice on where they think we could most usefully assist.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, given your concerns, Australia's concerns about the</p>
<p> state of readiness and technology of the New Zealand defence force,</p>
<p> do you think New Zealand's peace-keeping role in East Timor will</p>
<p> be one that you can rely on?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>I don't talk about decisions made by New Zealand about her defence</p>
<p> capability. That's a matter for New Zealand. I don't assert</p>
<p> the premise of your question.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have you applied, nevertheless, Prime Minister, any gentle pressure</p>
<p> regarding the third frigate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>We talked in a very constructive way about these things, but decisions</p>
<p> on New Zealand defence are a matter for New Zealand.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>New Zealand's taken some very significant decisions in relation</p>
<p> to defence in the last two years. Our government's very proud</p>
<p> of the fact that we have found our way clear to recommit to (inaudible).</p>
<p> The Prime Minister's acknowledged that they are significant for</p>
<p> a small economy that does want to play its role in the region. And</p>
<p> we had a useful discussion but there was no pressure from Australia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mrs Shipley, did the question of frigates come up at all, and are</p>
<p> you firmly resolved that there'll be no more frigates purchased?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>The government's position was that we have frigates that have</p>
<p> got a useful life until 2006. There is no necessity for us to make</p>
<p> final decisions until 2002. Our government when we considered this</p>
<p> last year decided we would invest in F16s not in frigates at this</p>
<p> stage, and the minister concerned was instructed to look internationally,</p>
<p> as well as to Australia, over the next two or three years as to what</p>
<p> our options are. And that's where the position stands and obviously</p>
<p> it is something that will be considered at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mrs Shipley did you talk about the referendum in November in Australia,</p>
<p> and do you think that the referendum on independence, that result,</p>
<p> will have an impact in New Zealand?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>We only talked about it passing, it was a significant discussion.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>It's not a referendum about independence. I thought Australia</p>
<p> became independent a long time ago.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mrs Shipley, you mentioned or alluded to some sort of extension of</p>
<p> CER or relationship with CER with the United States and South America.</p>
<p> Would you flesh that out for us?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>Well the thing with both countries, well certainly from our own point</p>
<p> of view, I think the opportunities that CER have offered both economies</p>
<p> have been very significant and when you have two populations that</p>
<p> have been able to trade effectively together to almost the full extent,</p>
<p> then the next step is to think creatively. We've both had a number</p>
<p> of visitors from South America in the last twelve months and they've</p>
<p> openly talked about CER and the MERCUSOR Group for example, exploring</p>
<p> opportunities, and perhaps that is the next step for CER, to get the</p>
<p> quantum leap that we saw we received in the early stages of this trading</p>
<p> agreement.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard do you have some comment on that, some extension?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Certainly that was discussed and I take the view in all of these areas</p>
<p> that you should always be willing to be outward looking. The goal</p>
<p> has to be for countries like New Zealand and Australia ever freer</p>
<p> trade because we have more to gain from that than we do from standing</p>
<p> still or going backwards. And every opportunity there is to expand</p>
<p> the horizons of freer trade we should grab.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Gerry Adams arrives in Australia this evening. How comfortable are</p>
<p> you with him being in the country?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>I don't mind, it's a free country. We have lots of people</p>
<p> coming to Australia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You won't reconsider your decision not to meet with him?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And you're not concerned that...well, do you think that his</p>
<p> visit will be a peaceful one, you don't think it will cause any</p>
<p> trouble?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>I'm sure it will be a peaceful one. He's been allowed into</p>
<p> Australia and we've made a decision to give him a visa and I'm</p>
<p> sure it will be peaceful.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, the Sunday Observer says that the British Government spent</p>
<p> $10 million on investigating dumping nuclear waste in Australia. Has</p>
<p> the Australian Government had any talks with Britain about that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Who says this?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The Sunday Observer in London.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>In New Zealand?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>In London.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Oh in London. Oh, I see. No, I haven't read that. I haven't</p>
<p> seen the clips yet.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Has the Australian Government had any talks with Britain on this issue?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>I'm not aware of them. Not in recent times, not that I've</p>
<p> been involved in, no.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, you seem to have had very much a tourist day today, so</p>
<p> far, seeing the sights. Why have you done that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Why? Because it's a beautiful country, that's why. I'd</p>
<p> be crazy to come here and not wander around and have a look at this</p>
<p> beautiful place. I've never been to Queenstown before. But in</p>
<p> case you think we're slacking, within an hour of arriving we</p>
<p> sat down and had a formal talk, on a Saturday afternoon, for an hour-and-a-half,</p>
<p> two hours. We had further discussions over dinner. We've continued</p>
<p> to talk in the back of the car about all manner of political things</p>
<p> and we'll go on talking over dinner. And then up to Wellington</p>
<p> this afternoon and I've got a dinner at the High Commissioner's</p>
<p> home with a large number of members of the New Zealand Cabinet. So</p>
<p> a pretty full-on weekend.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>We are having a very fortunate and very extensive access to the Prime</p>
<p> Minister. I don't think there's a minister in my Cabinet</p>
<p> that's not getting a chance to speak to him where they feel they</p>
<p> need to and we cannot complain at all about that access.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Was an Open Skies policy discussed between the both of you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>The Open Skies issue is something that's ongoing and we understand</p>
<p> that there are issues in Australia that need to be sorted out. It's</p>
<p> something that I think over time there's an opportunity for us</p>
<p> and we'll work on that in a progressive way.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, what are those Australian issues please?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>What are those Australian issues on what?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Open Skies policy.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Well, we've had a brief touch on it and we're going to have</p>
<p> a further discussion tomorrow.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, are there any particular issues you'll raise with</p>
<p> the New Zealand Cabinet members that you're meeting this evening?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Well, the ones you would normally raise in an intense bilateral exchange.</p>
<p> I mean, the importance of CER, the joint interest we have in maintaining</p>
<p> the momentum of APEC, a number of the things Mrs Shipley mentioned</p>
<p> in relation to the future horizons of CER. There are one or two Â</p>
<p> I'm pleased to say we're moving towards a good outcome in</p>
<p> relation to the broadcasting issue under CER and there are one or</p>
<p> two things to be progressed on the social security and child support</p>
<p> front. But overall it's a very stable bilateral relationship</p>
<p> but you must keep friendships in good repair and that's why you</p>
<p> have regular discussions and you involve people at a very high level.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Has there been any discussion, Prime Ministers, on the question of</p>
<p> trans-Tasman migration flows?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>Not at all I don't think.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>No, I don't think we've actually talked about that, no.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did you bring up Australia's refusal to allow New Zealand apples</p>
<p> into the country?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>That hasn't been discussed.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>No, it hasn't come up.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is there a [inaudible] to formally approach the US on a free trade</p>
<p> agreement, is that the extension on your earlier comments on...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>We haven't, I mean, we have talked about the issue generally</p>
<p> and the terms that Mrs Shipley outlined a few minutes ago. These sorts</p>
<p> of things have an ongoing life. They don't involve, sort of,</p>
<p> a start and a finish. We have a general goal of expanding the horizons</p>
<p> of freer trade to our mutual benefit and when opportunities arise</p>
<p> you take advantage of those opportunities.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>I would think this year the main effort will go into establishing</p>
<p> a broad-based world trade round. I think both New Zealand and Australia</p>
<p> will benefit enormously if we can succeed in a WTO round that is extremely</p>
<p> broad and strongly based. APEC does give us a good opportunity, I</p>
<p> think, to establish a strong platform and I was very much appreciative</p>
<p> of Prime Minister Howard's enthusiasm for trying to secure that</p>
<p> across the APEC group. That will be a major project for us this year</p>
<p> to try and be, at the end of the year, as far forward as we can be</p>
<p> with APEC countries solidly committed to a broad-based round.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mrs Shipley, can I just ask you - I know you're involved in the</p>
<p> bilaterals but domestically the business with Murray McCully and the</p>
<p> Tourism Board, this isn't going away - are you concerned about</p>
<p> the revelations that there have been from those meetings about Mr</p>
<p> McCully's directions to the board?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>Well they are matters before the Audit Officer and I think we should</p>
<p> wait until that report is completed?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But are you concerned that so much has actually come out?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>Well, there is a lot there. I think the Auditor-General is very capable</p>
<p> of weighing that up. I have absolute faith in him as an officer. He's</p>
<p> got a very good record in investigating things fairly. The Minister</p>
<p> has made it very clear that if there is anything adverse in those</p>
<p> reports he will offer his resignation and I don't think we can</p>
<p> ask more than that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Who was going to do the interpreting of that...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>I don't intend to speculate further on this. We should wait for</p>
<p> the report.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, given that Australia is going through the process</p>
<p> of reconciliation with the Aboriginal people, have you had any discussion</p>
<p> with Mrs Shipley about treaty negotiations here with the Maori people?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Well no, that hasn't come up. I think you're aware that</p>
<p> the push for reconciliation in Australia does not embrace the nation</p>
<p> of a treaty. I think you know the reasons for that. I wouldn't</p>
<p> be surprised if in the course of the next 24 hours that general issue</p>
<p> is discussed but so far, no.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mrs Shipley, you said yesterday that you and Mr Howard would be discussing</p>
<p> the matter of drugs. Has Mr Howard persuaded you that a get tough</p>
<p> on drugs policy is the way to go in New Zealand as well?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>He doesn't need to persuade me. I am not one who favours decriminalisation</p>
<p> or going soft on this issue. I can't for the life of me see that</p>
<p> by being permissive you actually assist anyone. But I have had a valuable</p>
<p> opportunity to speak to the Prime Minister on both the access issues</p>
<p> that Australia has dealt with and also the treatment issues and the</p>
<p> education issues and we've shared, I guess, strategies and experiences.</p>
<p> It's one that I think we should keep working on together because</p>
<p> both being island countries it is an ongoing challenge for governments</p>
<p> to try and manage this issue. And it does such terrible damage and</p>
<p> is so life limiting in terms of potential but I think it's something</p>
<p> we do need to continue to focus on actively.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have you spoken about the potential for drugs to cross the Tasman</p>
<p> from New Zealand to Australia and vice versa and have there been any</p>
<p> decisions or recommendations on...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>At this stage it's really just been a very open discussion on</p>
<p> approach. But we are certainly, I think, interested in collaborating</p>
<p> to see that if any issues do emerge that we can learn from each other</p>
<p> or assist each other. I'm sure we would be the first to do just</p>
<p> that. It is a big issue.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Approach to treatment or approach to border control.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>The three Â treatment, border control and education.[Ends]</p>
