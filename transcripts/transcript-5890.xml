) AUSTAI L&amp;<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY AUGUST 17 1982<br />
CONDOLENCE MOTION FOR CHARLES EDWARD GRIFFITHS<br />
I move, " that this House expresses its deep regret at the death<br />
on 17 may of Charles Edward Griffiths, a Member of this House<br />
for the Division of Shortland from 1949 to 1972, places on<br />
record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public<br />
service and tenders its sympathy to his family in their<br />
bereavement". All Members will be saddened to learn of the death of one<br />
of our former colleagues, Charles Griffiths. Charles Griffiths<br />
was born on 26 June 1903 at Jesmond in New South Wales.<br />
He was educated at the Bribbaree Public School. Upon leaving<br />
school, Charles Griffiths joined the New South Wales Railway.<br />
He became actively involved in union affairs, and was in turn<br />
an organiser and State councillor of the Australian Railways<br />
Union and from 1940 1952, State Secretary of that union.<br />
He was first elected to this House at the general election<br />
of 1949 for the newly created seat of Shortland. In his<br />
maiden speech to this House on 28 February 1950, he spoke<br />
of the great sacrifices made by the working people of<br />
Australia to aid the war effort and the evil influence of<br />
communism which he believed could be defeated if people<br />
could look to a secure economic future, free from poverty.<br />
Charles Griffiths served as a member of the Printing Committee<br />
from 1951 to 1954, and was a member of the Parliamentary<br />
Standing Committee on Public Works from 1959 to 1966. He was<br />
a member of the Australian delegation to the 9th Session of<br />
the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1964 and in 1966<br />
was a member of a Parliamentary delegation to South Asia.<br />
In 1969, he was a member of the Parliamentary mission which<br />
visited Hong Kong, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan.<br />
At the general election of 1972, he retired from this Parliament.<br />
On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia,<br />
I extend my sympathy to his widow Jess and his family in<br />
their bereavement. </p>
