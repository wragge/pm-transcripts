ELECTORAL TALK<br />
I want to report to you tonight about my visit to<br />
Japan and China.<br />
: The-visit was most important for Australia. it was<br />
most important for all Australians.<br />
I want to stress-. that the visit was the Government's first<br />
major international visit.<br />
It was planned that way for one special reason. My<br />
Government places particular emphasis on our relations<br />
with both Japan and China and with other countries in the<br />
South East Asian region.<br />
We had two main objectives.<br />
First we wanted to strengthen the Government to Government<br />
relationships w-ith Japan and China. We wanted to involve<br />
ourselves directly with their leaders and discuss problems,<br />
discuss areas of agreement and develop a first hand understanding.<br />
Second,. we wanted to further develop and extend our trade<br />
relationships and our cultural and our social understanding.<br />
Let there be no doubt we achieved these objectives.<br />
The Government's relations with Japan and China are now stronger<br />
than ever. We spoke frankly we listened to frank views.<br />
Out of these discussions has come a greater respect for<br />
Australia as a nation.<br />
We achieved a great deal of goodwill towards Australia.<br />
At a grass roots level, we gained much that will benefit<br />
this nation for decades ahead.<br />
In Japan, I signed a Treaty that will materially strengthen<br />
our economic relations and add real two-way stability to our<br />
trade with Japan.<br />
It is worth noting that Australia has no such agreement with<br />
any other country. That alone is surely a measure of how we<br />
regard our links. / 2 </p>
<p>In Japan we also spent many hours talking with the<br />
Prime Minister of Japan about the need for stability<br />
in our joint trade efforts.<br />
In fact, I believe these discussions were some of the most<br />
crucial and most significant of the entire tour.<br />
Our trade relations with Japan means a great deal to Australia<br />
and to the way in which we all live.<br />
Some nineteen years ago, under the initiative of Sir<br />
Robert Menzies,, Australia signed wvhat was called a<br />
commercial agreement. Since then trade between us has<br />
increased by 15 times. Today Japan is our major trading<br />
partner. Our meetings with the Prime Minister and his trade officials<br />
confirmed -that-both countries want stability and predictability<br />
in trade relations.<br />
Australian companies and Japanese companies can plan and<br />
develop trade between each other knowing'a that both<br />
Governments will encourage their efforts.<br />
In other areas of course our relations with Japan are of<br />
absolute importance.<br />
Clearly, Japan will play a great role in the future of<br />
Asia and the Pacific basis region. Japan will play a<br />
crucial part in preserving stability and development in our region.<br />
Japan is of course aware that Australia will play an important<br />
and re-sponsible'. part in reaching this goal. E<br />
I want to now focus on the achievements in China.<br />
We went ' to * China one of the greatest powers in the world,<br />
and with a population of 800 million to look and to learn.<br />
We also went so that the Chinese leaders could get a first hand<br />
insight of how we see world developments affecting us in<br />
Australia. On both counts the visit was an unqualified success.<br />
i am very pleased to be able to report that relations betwieen<br />
Australia and China have never been stronger.<br />
We have developed a very solid basis for a long term period<br />
of respect and mutual understanding.<br />
This then was our finest achievement in China.<br />
This understanding is not something one can pick up and<br />
add a signature to.<br />
It is something however that is going to benefit generations<br />
o f Australians. 3 </p>
<p>We cannot and did not expect rapid results from<br />
our visit to China. We did not expect or work forformal<br />
trade agreements and the like.<br />
Building relations requires patience, persistence and<br />
understanding. This especially applies to a country<br />
whose history, culture and political structure is so<br />
different to our own.<br />
In China, however,, we were pleased to gain-an assurance<br />
that they would not allow Party to Party relations and<br />
that means communist party to communist party to affect<br />
the relationship between-Governments. That has particular<br />
importance to countries in which insurgency has been<br />
taking place.<br />
That was a very clear statement and one which has real<br />
significance to Australia and to our neighbours.<br />
President Marcos of the Philippines for one has no<br />
doubt of the importance of that assurance from China.<br />
He has told me that it will give the ASEAN countries<br />
f urther reassurances. I<br />
Some commentators mainly those who remained in Australiaclaimed<br />
that by developing our relations with China we are aligning<br />
ourselves against Soviet Russia.<br />
This claim is completely without foundation.<br />
We believe that good relations with Soviet Russia are important<br />
to Aus-tralia.<br />
The Government has ahd messages during the last few days<br />
that plainly indicate that Soviet Russia wants a friendly<br />
relationship to continue with Australia. They also<br />
demonstrated this with a very wrarm welcome given to Mr<br />
Nixon, the Minister for Transport, in the last few days.<br />
I have no doubt that we will continue to have a good working<br />
relationship with Russia.<br />
Overall, the visit to Japan and China has achieved a great deal<br />
for Australia.<br />
Our relations with both countries are stronger than ever;<br />
we made great advances in economic and trade matters with Japan;<br />
we gained intimate knowledge of the thinking of Chinese leaders;<br />
and we clearly and frankly put our position on events that affect<br />
the people of Australia.<br />
This all means that Australia will be better able to take its<br />
place as a responsible and meaningful influence in the growth and<br />
development of our own region. 000000000 </p>
