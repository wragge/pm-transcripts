<p>FULWOOD:</p>
<p>Good morning to you Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hello Annie, nice to be on your programme.</p>
<p>FULWOOD:</p>
<p>Thank you. Mr Howard, universal criticism is what I see today. Does</p>
<p> that worry you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. It's criticism from what I might call the commentators and</p>
<p> some of the elites. I think the Australian public's reaction</p>
<p> is both different and of course more important. And that reaction</p>
<p> so far has been somewhat different from that of many of the commentators.</p>
<p>FULWOOD:</p>
<p>But nevertheless the commentators many have some influence. Do you</p>
<p> consider that they have some influence over...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we'll wait and see. The nature of something like this is</p>
<p> that you can never satisfy everybody. This is the first time in a</p>
<p> hundred years that anybody's attempted to write a preamble to</p>
<p> the Australian Constitution and therefore it was bound to be criticised</p>
<p> by a lot of people.</p>
<p>FULWOOD:</p>
<p>Yes, on the mateship issue certainly, a great deal of criticism that</p>
<p> you may well have alienated half the population, the women.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't believe that. That's a very narrow, petty, short</p>
<p> sighted point of view. There may have been a blokey origin of Âmateship',</p>
<p> but it has acquired a hallowed place in the Australian experience</p>
<p> and Australian life. And it doesn't just mean friendship between</p>
<p> men. It means helping each other in adversity. It means dragging bodies</p>
<p> out of train wrecks and from the rubble of collapsed ski lodges. It</p>
<p> means that general spirit of volunteerism and self help which Australians</p>
<p> are famous for helping each other in adversity.</p>
<p>FULWOOD:</p>
<p>One commentator did say that one line, just using the word Âcustodianship'</p>
<p> and recognising may well have helped you with the progress of this</p>
<p> through Parliament by getting the Aboriginal people on side and of</p>
<p> course Labor and the Democrats.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well without talking about one particular word which we shouldn't</p>
<p> get hung up about, you've got to remember the other side of it.</p>
<p> If you go too far in order to placate special interest groups you</p>
<p> might start losing the majority of the mainstream of the Australian</p>
<p> community. What I put in there about the indigenous people is truthful,</p>
<p> it's historical, it is dignified, it is sensitive, but it is</p>
<p> not going to raise the hackles of other sections of the Australian</p>
<p> community.</p>
<p>FULWOOD:</p>
<p>Is it a swipe at political correctness though all the same?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the thing dealing with Aborigines, no of course it's not.</p>
<p> The thing I think you're referring to is a quite proper statement</p>
<p> to the affect that people should not have their liberty and their</p>
<p> dignity in anyway infringed by passing fashions.</p>
<p>FULWOOD:</p>
<p>Yeah, perhaps I as suggesting you're having a bit each way on</p>
<p> that all the same.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't think I am. I mean what is wrong with saying that</p>
<p> people's liberty and the dignity they have under the law should</p>
<p> not be infringed by prejudice, or fashion, or ideology. I think that</p>
<p> is a very proper and correct and dignified statement that people's</p>
<p> liberties and their dignity is something that should not be interfered</p>
<p> with by those sorts of things. I mean all Australians would support</p>
<p> that.</p>
<p>FULWOOD:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, Kim Beazley says you've broken Aboriginal hearts by</p>
<p> not including custodianship.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't believe that. I mean that is just a very knee-jerk</p>
<p> negative thing. Kim is in danger of becoming a spoiler. He's</p>
<p> against everything. I mean whether you consult him, or consult the</p>
<p> people or not. I mean I consulted the Australian people on our GST</p>
<p> and he's against that. I've prepared this draft preamble.</p>
<p> He's against that. He's against everything.</p>
<p>FULWOOD:</p>
<p>I actually wonder though, in the original draft were you more generous</p>
<p> to indigenous people? ÂStewardship' I understand was a word</p>
<p> that was going to be in there.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there was the original draft that Les Murray put up. It had Âstewardship</p>
<p> of their lands' in it. Now that was open to two criticisms. From</p>
<p> the indigenous side there may have been argument that by using Âtheir</p>
<p> land' we were putting a very narrow interpretation of land as</p>
<p> established under native title processes and therefore was being too</p>
<p> clever by half. And then on the other hand others might argue that</p>
<p> it was reopening the whole native title issue.</p>
<p>FULWOOD:</p>
<p>Yeah, were you rolled in Cabinet on that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no. Quite the reverse. I in fact made the change.</p>
<p>FULWOOD:</p>
<p>What about the simplicity of the language is another matter that's</p>
<p> been raised. ÂWe are free to hold our beliefs'....I've</p>
<p> just lost the word at the moment. But you know.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are free to be proud of our country and our heritage. Well that</p>
<p> is self-evident. There are some people who aren't proud of their</p>
<p> country. Now if we are a truly democratic society we should have admitted</p>
<p> that possibility. I'm proud of Australia. You are. Most Australians</p>
<p> are. But you have to, in an egalitarian democratic society admit of</p>
<p> that possibility.</p>
<p>FULWOOD:</p>
<p>Nevertheless it's a Constitution as we say and not a song or</p>
<p> a poem isn't it. So shouldn't the substance be greater than</p>
<p> song words and poetic words?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, but the substance should be true. You are free on occasions to</p>
<p> be ashamed of something this country may do. So am I. So that's</p>
<p> all I'm saying. And it's a statement of the obvious.</p>
<p>FULWOOD:</p>
<p>So Mr Howard, if it doesn't get through then, passing through</p>
<p> the Senate, what happens then? Do you re-write and re-submit?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I've said that I would like people to make comment and I've</p>
<p> asked the leader of the Australian Democrats and the Opposition et</p>
<p> cetera to make comment by the 30th of April and I'll</p>
<p> have a look at their comments. I'm not going to go back to the</p>
<p> drawing board and I'm not going to sit down and negotiate it</p>
<p> through a committee. But I will have a look at the comments that people</p>
<p> make and if there are sensible suggestions that can be incorporated</p>
<p> without doing violence to what I've set out to do, and the Government</p>
<p> set to do, well we'll have a look at that. But we're not</p>
<p> going to engage in some kind of wholesale bargaining about it. And</p>
<p> then the final document will be put up to the Senate and we'll</p>
<p> then see what happens. But are the Australian Democrats and the Australian</p>
<p> Labor Party really going to vote and campaign against a document that</p>
<p> for the first time in a hundred years actually acknowledges the historic</p>
<p> place of the indigenous people in Australian life, and acknowledges</p>
<p> that we respect their continuing culture? Are they going to vote against</p>
<p> a declaration of the basic beliefs of the Australian community. I</p>
<p> mean that in the end is what has to be decided. But I will listen</p>
<p> to what people have got to say.</p>
<p>FULWOOD:</p>
<p>I'm sure that pleases them. Further to other matters on the agenda</p>
<p> Mr Howard. The Telstra bill withdrawn for now. What's going on?</p>
<p> Are there deals being done behind closed doors?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That never happens. That never happens.</p>
<p>FULWOOD:</p>
<p>I don't believe you Mr Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's just not on. It's just not on at the moment. Look our</p>
<p> position's clear. We want to sell the whole of Telstra to the</p>
<p> Australian public. We want to wipe out Australia's government</p>
<p> debt. We want Australia to be the greatest share owning democracy</p>
<p> in the world and the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats and</p>
<p> others are standing in the way of that at the present time. Now we'll</p>
<p> push ahead and I hope we can get another 16% at least, and I hope</p>
<p> in the end we'll get the other 51%. Now when exactly it comes</p>
<p> back again depends on the Senate schedule. We haven't abandoned</p>
<p> that goal.</p>
<p>FULWOOD:</p>
<p>All right Mr Howard, yes. One more thing, Jamie Packer overnight back-flipped</p>
<p> as it were. He believes we should lift restrictions on foreign ownership</p>
<p> of Australian media in the national interest. What do you think of</p>
<p> that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there's been no change of Government policy. As you will</p>
<p> understand we don't change Government policy according to the</p>
<p> views of individual media proprietors be they Mr Packer, or Mr Murdoch,</p>
<p> or Mr Stokes, or indeed anybody else.</p>
<p>FULWOOD:</p>
<p>Could we fall behind though if we don't?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Annie, this has been debated at great length in the past. I have</p>
<p> been one of the strongest critics over the years of the existing media</p>
<p> laws. But when we had a look at it a couple years ago there was a</p>
<p> lot of opposition. In the Coalition, from the Democrats, the Labor</p>
<p> Party and others, and I've got more important fish to fry than</p>
<p> to re-ignite that particular issue.</p>
<p>FULWOOD:</p>
<p> All right Mr Howard. We thank you for your time here on 11AM.</p>
<p> We appreciate you joining us.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
