April 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ADDRESS TO THE AUSTRALIAN SCOUT MOVEMENT<br />
LAUNCH OF NEW NATIONAL LOGO<br />
E O E<br />
Thank you very much Chief Commissioner and all scouts and guides and rovers and<br />
venturers and everybody. It is a great privilege for me to be associated with the launch of<br />
what is a modern Australian version of a traditional emblem that has worldwide<br />
recognition and world wide acclaim. What I like about it is that you know instincitively<br />
what it is but it has an Australian flavour about it which perhaps it didn't have before.<br />
And as the commissioner said it reminds us of the twin affections of members of the scouts<br />
and that is the commitment to a great world wide movement and also a commitment to<br />
Australia. The Scouts over the years have done tremendous work in nurturing and<br />
developing and encouraging and inspiring young Australians and in fact young people all<br />
over the world. It is one of the greatest young people's organisations that has ever been<br />
devised and it owes a lot to its founder Baden Powell and it of course owes a lot to people<br />
like Commissioner Wells and others who have devoted their lives to the cause of<br />
developing a spirit of self esteem and commitment and care for the environment and care<br />
for others amongst the members of the scouts. And I'm delighted although a little<br />
belatedly though I'm sorry, because of other things, to be associated with this and I want<br />
to thank you for the privelege of being here and I want to thank the scout movement and<br />
all aspects of it for the contribution that its made to Australia and the contribution that its<br />
made to character building amonst young people. </p>
<p>I like the new logo. I think it is distinctively Australian yet it also unmistakeably tells you<br />
that the Scouts of Australia are part of a world wide scouting movement. Congratulations<br />
and all good wishes for the scouts of Australia in the years ahead. </p>
