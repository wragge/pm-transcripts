    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>P. M. No. 115/1966</strong></p>
<p>I regret Mr. Calwell's statement.</p>
<p>I am sure that most Australians have welcomed as I didÂ the President's friendly message with its warm assurance of continuingÂ American association with us as we face challenges to peace and freedomÂ in Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is customary not unusual as Mr. Calwell would suggestÂ for Heads of Government to send messages of good wishes to other HeadsÂ of Government as they are newly-elected or confirmed in office.</p>
<p>Australians will not be unmindful of the fact that the messageÂ came from an ally with whom we are actively associated both in militaryÂ operations and in our common pursuit of the Goals of Freedom as definedÂ at the recent Manila Conference.</p>
<p>The message came from a man who so short a time ago wasÂ in Australia as an honoured guest, and reflects his high regard for thisÂ country and his personal friendship with me.</p>
<p>CANBERRA,<br />29th November, 1966</p>
