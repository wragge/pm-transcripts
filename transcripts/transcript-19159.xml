<p>Clean-up and recovery grants of up to $15,000 are now available for primary producers in areas severely affected by flooding in New South Wales.</p>
<p>This assistance, available under Category C of the jointly funded Federal/State Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA), will initially apply to primary producers in Clarence Valley and Coffs Harbour. The Commonwealth and New South Wales Governments will continue to assess the impact of the floods on other areas to see if this assistance should be activated elsewhere.</p>
<p>The assistance is designed to help with the economic impacts that these devastating floods have had on local farms.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government today also announced that it will provide additional Commonwealth support for employees, small businesses and farmers who have lost income as a direct result of the floods crisis.</p>
<p>The Disaster Income Recovery Subsidy is a fortnightly Commonwealth payment of up to the maximum rate of existing Newstart Allowance for a period of 13 weeks.  The subsidy will be available to those in Clarence Valley and Coffs Harbour who have experienced a loss of income as a direct result of the flooding and are not currently receiving, or eligible for, any other income support payment.</p>
<p>The floodwaters and storms have hit people's livelihoods and made it difficult for people to continue their everyday lives - including going to work or operating their small businesses.</p>
<p>These activations are in addition to the range of support already available, including personal hardship and distress assistance, loans to primary producers and small businesses, assistance with essential public asset restoration and freight subsidies for primary producers.</p>
<p>There are now 27 local government areas eligible for various types of assistance across New South Wales following flooding and severe weather in January and February this year, including:</p>
<p> * 	Ballina, Bellingen, Byron, Camden, Clarence Valley, Coffs Harbour, Glen Innes Severn, Gloucester, Great Lakes, Greater Taree, Hawkesbury, Inverell, Kempsey, Kiama, Kyogle, Lismore, Lithgow, Moree Plains, Nambucca, Port Macquarie-Hastings, Randwick, Richmond Valley, Shoalhaven, Tenterfield, Tweed, Upper Hunter, Walcha.</p>
<p>Primary producers in the flood affected areas should contact the NSW Rural Assistance Authority on 1800 678 593 to see if they are eligible for the grant.</p>
