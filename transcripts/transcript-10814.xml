    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce today a comprehensive $270 million package</p>
<p> of measures to enhance the care of older people in the community,</p>
<p> and provide greater recognition and support for carers within Australian</p>
<p> society.</p>
<p>The measures will assist elderly Australians remain in their homes</p>
<p> if they choose to and provide better support for carers.</p>
<p>The vast majority of frail older people wish to continue living in</p>
<p> their own homes, cared for day to day by others.</p>
<p>We will spend $270 million over the next four years to assist the</p>
<p> aged achieve this outcome, and improve support for carers in their</p>
<p> vital role.</p>
<p>The package, to begin immediately, includes:</p>
<p>* The number of Community Aged Care Packages to be expanded by 3,900,</p>
<p> at a cost of $92 million over the next four years. Together with growth</p>
<p> under existing programmes, this will more than double the number of</p>
<p> people assisted to 22,000. The packages will also be able to cater</p>
<p> for people with more complex care needs, including nursing care.</p>
<p>* Continence assistance will be increased at a cost of $15 million</p>
<p> to make it easier for older people to manage at home and avoid unwanted</p>
<p> admission to residential care.</p>
<p>* The successful Carer Respite Centres initiative announced in the</p>
<p> 1996 Budget to be expanded from 58 to 73 at a cost of $30 million.</p>
<p> An extra $10 million will also be available for additional respite</p>
<p> care places for people with dementia.</p>
<p>* About 8,000 people aged 65 years or more currently care for adult</p>
<p> children with a profound disability. Many of these have been carers</p>
<p> for 40 years or more. We will spend an extra $15 million over four</p>
<p> years on accommodation services for this group through the Commonwealth/State</p>
<p> Disability Agreement.</p>
<p>* Income support for carers will be reformed with eligibility for</p>
<p> the Domiciliary Nursing Care Benefit expanded at a cost of $91 million.</p>
<p> This builds on an already announced 28% increase in the rate of benefit</p>
<p> to take effect from 1 July 1998.</p>
<p>* Funding for aged care assessment will be indexed to growth in the</p>
<p> older population to enable people to access care appropriate to their</p>
<p> needs at a cost of $13.7 million.</p>
