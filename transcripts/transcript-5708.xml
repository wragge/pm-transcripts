E[ fiBA. PGO:<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 6 DECEMBER 1981<br />
OPENING OF THE CAMPANIA CLUB<br />
I am delighted to be at the Campania Club for this official<br />
opening because these new headquarters are a significant<br />
expression of multicultural Australia, and a tribute to<br />
the efforts and vision of the club and its members.<br />
I will say something in a a moment about the achievement<br />
which these new headquarters represent, but beforeI come to<br />
that, let me just say that the activities of-this club, and<br />
others like it, enrich the life of the nation as a whole<br />
and contribute to a better and more diverse Australia.<br />
Multiculturalism has taken decisive strides ahead in the last<br />
few years, c6pecially since the Government's total acceptance<br />
of the Galbaily'Report three years ago, and as I said in the<br />
inaugural4address on multiculturalism less than a week ago,<br />
the Government stands fully committed to the continued<br />
advancement of multiculturalism in Australia. There is<br />
obviously a great deal still to be done,' and the Government<br />
is very well aware of this. But it is a great achievement<br />
of this enttire nation that, at a time when many other countries<br />
are still trying to size up the challenge of cultural diversity,<br />
Australia has broken through. And we are all increasingly<br />
aware that the prospects which lie ahead as a result of that<br />
breakthr ugh are exciting as well as challenging, and I<br />
have no doubt that we will move ahead much more strongly as<br />
a nation because of it.<br />
There is something else that I would like to say because at<br />
this moment, while we are celebrating this wonderful new club,<br />
with all the benefits and facilities it provides, our minds<br />
cannot help turning to the appalling earthquake last year in<br />
Southern Italy. That tragedy is something which nobody here<br />
will ever forget, for it was a disaster of massive proportions,<br />
and it affected a considerable number of people here in a<br />
very direct way indeed, in many cases through the death or<br />
injury of friends or family.<br />
I would like again to express the sympathy which we all feel<br />
for those who suffered loss. But while none of us will forget<br />
the tragedy, neither will we forget the magnificent response / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
throughout Australia to the appeal which was immediately<br />
launched. All Australians responded to that appeal, not just<br />
-Austra~ liansof Italian origin, and not just the Government,<br />
because the tragedy affected us all, as members of one nation.<br />
As everybody knows, $ 4.4 million was raised in the appeal,<br />
$ 600,000 of it in South Australia, and it is extremely pleasing<br />
that this money is already being put to practical use and<br />
translated into valuable, concrete projects in Italy.<br />
It is particularly memorable that a kindergarten and an<br />
elderly people's home are in fact due to be opened tomorrow<br />
in the township of Campagna, and the conjunction between that<br />
event and the event we are celebrating here today will no<br />
doubt remain in many of our minds as a symbolic landmark in<br />
Australian-Italian relationships.<br />
Funds from the eathquake appeal have also been allocated for an<br />
elderly people's home in Baronissi, and for a day hospital<br />
in CavaDei Tirreni. Beyond that, four further projects in<br />
four other towns are being considered, and the National Committee<br />
for the Southern Italian Earthquake Appeal will in fact meet<br />
tomorrow right here at the Campania Club to decide on further<br />
allocations of appeal funds.<br />
This club obviously played an active role in the appeal. It is<br />
not surprising that your President, Mr John Di Fede, is a<br />
distinguishea member of that Committee, and I understand he<br />
will be reporting at tomorrow's meeting on progress in terms<br />
of reconstruction in Southern Italy. , That report will be a<br />
matter of g1reat interest, and if the progress in terms of<br />
reconstruction there comes anywhere near the progress in termns<br />
of construction here as represented by these new premises,<br />
then the report will be an impressive one indeed.<br />
I understand that the Camnpania Club was established in 1975,<br />
and these headquarters represent a remarkable achievement<br />
on the part of the Club and its members. Nobody knows better<br />
than you that buildings such as these do not come into existenc; e<br />
by chance5 or simply through spending money. They have come into<br />
existence-because a group of men and women had a vision of<br />
something worth doing, and because this vision was backed by<br />
the will and dedication to make it a reality.<br />
The members of this club willingly joined together. I understand<br />
that many of them put their own efforts directly into the building<br />
work, and without this contribution, the facilities now enjoyed<br />
here by club members and their families would surely never have<br />
been possible. This Club is a fine example of a theme which<br />
runs through Australian history, the theme of people rising<br />
to meet a challenge, and enhancing the life of the whole<br />
community through their achievement. I have no doubt that this<br />
Club, in these premises, will make that kind of contribution. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
It is not surprising in Australia in the 1980s that membership<br />
of this Club is by no means confined to Australians of Italian<br />
Sorigi~ 7--alth6ugh obviously the great majority of club members<br />
do share that particular bond. But in any case the benefits<br />
that will be gained from these new facilities will extend beyond<br />
the enjoyment of members, for through clubs such as this,<br />
Australians can reach out to other parts of the world, we<br />
can reach back to our origins and maintain our cultural<br />
inheritance, and we can reach forward to the future, to project<br />
the way of life we seek for our children. That is a goal<br />
which we-all share, and a commitment we must pursue<br />
unswervingly. I congratulate the Club for what it has achieved, and for what<br />
it will continue to do for the life of Australia. And while<br />
it is not quite time yet for me to perform the opening<br />
ceremony, I am looking forward very much to declaring these<br />
new headquarters open in a few minutes. </p>
