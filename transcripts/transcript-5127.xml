PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA FRIDAY 24 AUGUST.. V979:<br />
ADDRESS TO NSW STATE CONVENTION<br />
Thank you very much f or that welcome. I believe that the<br />
Liberal Party over recent months has been too much on the<br />
defensive and it's time we put that behind us because there<br />
is no need for it.<br />
We only have to look at what has been achieved over the<br />
last three and a half years, the damage that had been done to<br />
Australia much greater and more serious I think than anyone<br />
understood at the time, and see where this country has come.<br />
With a record held high in the international arena, with an<br />
economy which is the envy of most developed nations, despite<br />
the problems we still have, the Australian economy and what<br />
we have achieved is the envy of North America and the envy<br />
of many countries in Europe. If they can note that, I think<br />
it is time that Australians began to have some pride in their<br />
own country and where Australia is going.<br />
We need to look at what we've done. The Budget has strengthened<br />
the economic health of this country. It will encourage growth<br />
and development and it meets the Liberal Party's commitment<br />
to continuing social reform.<br />
Our economic strategy has been vindicated, because there has<br />
been a great deal of international praise for Australia' s<br />
steadfastness and success.<br />
The OECD compliments Australia's economic policy. They recognise<br />
the competitiveness of Australian industry which is going out<br />
and getting markets right around the world. A few years ago<br />
that just wasn't possible.<br />
The GATT report, in its last annual document, noted that<br />
Australia is the only country to succeed in achieving improvement<br />
in international competitive positions over the last few<br />
years. That, I believe, is high praise indeed.<br />
It is worth noting that private foreign inv estment last year<br />
was the best since 1971-72 and in the June Quarter alone, there<br />
was $ 1,400 million of prospective new investment approved by<br />
the Foreign Investment Review Board: 285 proposals approved<br />
in less than 20 days of proposals and only 2 proposals rejected.<br />
That again is a vote of overseas confidence in this country.<br />
I think it is time that Australians themselves showed more<br />
confidence in Australia, more confidence in themselves and<br />
where we are going. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Inflation is much less than it was, despite renewed pressures<br />
within this country. 17 per cent to about 9 per cent at the<br />
present time. We need to understand that our competitive<br />
position is improving because Australia's inflation is under.<br />
most of our trading partners, under North America, under most<br />
countries in Europe, and the margin in Australia's favour is<br />
increasing. There are things that are worth noting; that when<br />
Labor took office inflation was about 5 per cent that is in<br />
1972, the end of it, and that then was below the OECD average,<br />
it was under the Liberal/ National Country Party Government. We<br />
had performed better than most countries overseas. But during<br />
their term they took Australia to an inflation of 17 per cent,<br />
points above the OECD average. Now, up to the last six<br />
months, Australia's inflation of about 9 per cent is nearly<br />
3 points below the OECD average. So whatever the world<br />
inflationary pressures are, Australia has coped with those<br />
pressures better than most countries.<br />
I think it is worth noting, or asking ourselves, has the Labor<br />
Party really changed. Is the quiet Bill Hayden different from<br />
Whitlam's flamboyancy. It is not the people but the pol4ics<br />
we need to look at. The policies which were revealed at the<br />
Labor Conference in Adelaide show that it is Mr. Whitlam all<br />
over again.<br />
If we can remember back to 1972 we will remember what pains<br />
Mr. Whitlam went to to show moderation, to show reason, to show<br />
commonsense in the development and explanation of policies.<br />
But once an election was won, where was reason, where was<br />
moderation, where was commonsense. It was madness unleashed<br />
on the Aust%-ralian community. And what has happened in the<br />
years since? They then had a policy of destroying the Senate.<br />
They still have a policy of destroying the Senate. Reducing<br />
the Senate's powers so that it could never protect the States,<br />
and the small States in particular. They will have a policy<br />
of making it a simple majority to alter the Australian<br />
constitution, again, denying any protection to the smaller<br />
States, establishing the circumstance where N. S. W. and Victoria<br />
alone could the constitutional face of Australia. That is<br />
Whitlam, all over again.<br />
The Labor Party say they can work with the union movement.<br />
Mr. Whitlam of course did and what happened? They lost six<br />
billion man days in one year alone. Two and a half or three<br />
times the average time lost, despite the discontent and the<br />
industrial trouble of the last few months, under Tony Street's<br />
administration. I think they can work with the unions just<br />
about as well as Mr. Hayden can work with Bob Hawke. And you<br />
know how well that is.<br />
The first time Mr. Hayden the first opportunity he had to<br />
show how well he could work with Mr. Hawke, he dumped<br />
Mr. Hawke with the Socialist Left. Why we don't know. But<br />
if he is going to put himself captive to the Socialist Left over<br />
one weekend in Adelaide, then what would he ever do in Government?<br />
It would be a risk that Australians would never dare take. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
They have made it quite plain they are going abolish every<br />
law that would place any restraint on any trade union.<br />
Trade unions, often bad enough as it is, but they would have<br />
no legal restraint upon them and would be able to do anything<br />
in the name of industrial action. We only have to read the<br />
resolutions they passed, the policies they confirmed, to know<br />
that policy is binding on every member of the Australian<br />
Labor Party.<br />
They would take unions above the law. I suspect that there are<br />
one or two of you who wouldn't really approve of doing that.<br />
If we look at the economy an interventionist role again.<br />
Planning allocations of resources by Government and not by<br />
private enterprise. Maximisation of Government intervention%<br />
There was<br />
no recognition that too much Government expenditure adds to<br />
inflation. There were literally dozens of proposals costing<br />
money, costing your taxpayer's funds.<br />
They did it in 1972. 1 think we need to understand when they<br />
say are they going to spend your taxpayer's dollars they<br />
really mean it. That is one Labor promise you can take for<br />
granted that they wouldn't break.<br />
They are going to an Australian Hydrocarbon Corporation to go<br />
looking for oil, investing your dollars. They wouldn't even<br />
know where to look. They want to establish a national<br />
investment fund, with your taxpayer's dollars. And a national<br />
superannuation scheme that we couldn't afford. A no-fault<br />
compensation scheme that we couldn't afford. And a national<br />
newspaper because sometimes the daily papers don't print what<br />
they like to see. I must admit they don't always print what<br />
I would like to see either. But I don't want to have my own<br />
newspaper to make up for the balance. I would sooner taken my<br />
risks with free enterprise newspapers.<br />
They have so little faith at being able to raise money from<br />
proper sources for their political campaigns, even though some<br />
of their supporters the communist unions like AMSWU, have<br />
an annual income of $ 8 million or $ 10 million a year, but they<br />
want to use your taxpayer's funds to pay for election expenses.<br />
I don't think that is reasonable.<br />
They want to abolish staff ceilings on the Commonwealth Public<br />
Service and unleash the massive growth of the bureacracy once<br />
again. That is Whitlam all over again.<br />
What do they want to do about taxes? There was promise that<br />
Mr. Whitlam kept explicitly and absolutely: he said he wouldpay<br />
for the rest of his programs through inflation. Nobody really<br />
believed him. I can remember trying to make something-of that<br />
in 1972. You might think that is a long while ago, but is only about<br />
a third of the time I have been in the Parliament. But they did<br />
pay for their promises through inflation, and inflation which<br />
wreaked great havoc on the Australian people. If they say they<br />
are going to do that again, I think we ought to believe them. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
It is worth noting that taxes grew in three years of Labor<br />
by 125 per cent as a result of that. They proposed a capital<br />
gains tax. They found that too difficult. Mr. Hayden says<br />
it is not too difficult for him and he is going to do it.<br />
But he also says he wants a wealth tax on the wealth of the<br />
whole nation. Think of farmers who have an average profitability<br />
sometimes of about 2 per cent, and from the nature of things<br />
with drought and sometimes low prices, no profitability at all,<br />
but they still have to pay that wealth tax, profits or not.<br />
Again, that is Mr. Whitlam all over again.<br />
One of the great achievements of this Government over the<br />
last two to three years has been to negotiate a painstaking<br />
agreement_ with all States National Party, Liberal and<br />
Labor to resolve finally and forever the argument that came<br />
after the Seas and Submerged Lands Act and the High Court<br />
decision which gave jurisdiction from the Commonwealth and<br />
upset a traditional view of that particular matter. We could<br />
have exerted Commonwealth power, but we believed that was<br />
an arena in particular, because there had been traditional<br />
State interests, where we ought to work in co-operation with<br />
the States and not just take the view " the power is ours,<br />
therefore, we are going to use it". We believed we should<br />
share that power. That Governments should work in co-operation.<br />
We have agreed on mining and fisheries and all matters<br />
offshore, and it is a sensible one, giving State<br />
territorial rights out of the three-mile limit instead of just<br />
to the low-water mark and all the rest. Legislation will be<br />
introduced into the Parliament at the end of this session.-<br />
certainly passed not later than the Autumn session.<br />
But what will Labor do? Assert total Commowealth supremacy<br />
offshore, upset all the agreements with the States, and<br />
move their own Federal bureacracy out into the administration<br />
of mining and all the rest offshore. Again, total centralisation<br />
of power in Canberra. Whitlam all over again.<br />
But then they are going to intervene to take action to prevent<br />
the continuance of activities of trans-national corporations.<br />
To then,, that's just -a large company with some people or<br />
som~ e parts of 4t coming from, overseas, that. are, against the<br />
interests of the Australian public..'<br />
They are also going<br />
to establish a body to spy on those organisations. What are<br />
they going to do with the information? Give it to the trade<br />
unions, the domestic trade unions and the international trade<br />
unions. Under these circumstances, how much foreign investment<br />
would be left? How many great resource projects would proceed?<br />
I don't believe any of them would. They would stop development<br />
dead in its tracks. That also is Mr. Whitlam all over again.<br />
They would reneg on uranium contracts and keep uranium<br />
in the ground. They would have a resource tax and make<br />
enterprises unprofitable. That is Whitlam., or Labor Party,<br />
all over again. </p>
<p>In other areas, and this is of course where the argument<br />
with Mr. Hawke came in, they have no economic policy at all.<br />
Mr. Hayden--the great economic Messiah, the Treasurer who<br />
had the most irresponsible Budget of all time, the Treasurer<br />
who devised the plan during the supply crisis to make the<br />
trading banks of Australia pay for the bills of Government.<br />
How many of us remember that? In my office I've got copies<br />
of the documents and the certificates that they were falsely<br />
and unconstitutionally and illegally going to use. It is<br />
Mr. Hayden who devised that plan and perpetrated it.<br />
But he has no economic policy. There is no mention of<br />
inflation and the importance of' combatting inflation in their<br />
policy, in their platform. No recognition of the wages<br />
problem. Would you like me to read their economic policy<br />
to see if you can understand it. " With the understanding and<br />
co-operation of the trade union movement, development of<br />
economic policy which would encompass wages, incomes, non-wages<br />
incomes, the social wage, taxation reform and elimiation of<br />
tax avoidance, and which will achieve a more equitable<br />
distribution of our national wealth and income, wit ' h the<br />
commitment to the maintenance of real wages by quarterly<br />
adjustments and the passing on of the benif its of the increases<br />
in productivity". Even Mr. Wran called it a hotch-potch.<br />
Mr. Hawke,' in always a bit plainer in what he says, called it<br />
a gutless sell-out to the Left. It is a meaningless policy.<br />
It is a non-policy.<br />
This policy would spell the death-knell of this country.<br />
It is our duty as Liberals to make sure that people understand<br />
this. To make sure that they understand that the cloak of<br />
moderation is just the same hiding an animal that has not<br />
changed. But it can't change because it is an organisation that<br />
has been captive of the Socialist Left for years and it is still is.<br />
But also as Liberals we have a responsibility<br />
to see that people can understand what we have achieved.<br />
To see what we have done. To make sure that they can understand<br />
the basis and the purpose of our policies and where we intend<br />
to take Australia through the next decade.<br />
The Budget I believe is a good one. Because . it maintains the<br />
streng-th of our anti-inflationary policies. I haven't heard<br />
anyone say, and I'm glad they haven't, that they want a Budget<br />
more anti-inflationary than this one, because no objective is<br />
more important for the economic well-being of this nation.<br />
The deficit is down. But also within that responsible overall<br />
framework we have been able to provide responsible and<br />
sensible concessions for business, to take new initiatives in<br />
that area and also to reassert the Liberal Party's pre-eminence<br />
as a Party of social reform and make significant advances in<br />
that area also. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
With the economy, the Budget builds on existing achievements.<br />
But it also responds to new pressures and dangers coming from<br />
the increase in oil prices and increase in beef prices.<br />
We haven't just sat down and said: " Look, overseas effects'<br />
are difficult. There is nothing we can do about it". We<br />
have responded to those events as we should. I don't think<br />
Jo1bn Howard liked introducing that mini-Budget much. I<br />
certainly didn't like the publicity that led up to the first<br />
two weeks before it. I haven't particularly liked the<br />
publidity over the last three months. But with our<br />
responsibility to the people of Australia, our first<br />
responsibility even if it meant some cost to ourselves<br />
was to govern this country responsibly. If that meant we<br />
had to trim our sales because of changing economic<br />
circumstances, then so be it. We had to do it. I can just<br />
imagine the kind of publicity we would have had if we had<br />
done nothing in May. People would have said. there are new<br />
inflationary pressures, the Government has done nothing about<br />
it. The economy is out of control. They won't be able to<br />
reassert themselves. They haven't said that, because they<br />
know we took the responsible path as we should.<br />
We have restrained Government expenditure again in this Budget.<br />
There are still rigid ceilings on the Public Service and they<br />
will remain. If the recruiting programs of Labor had stayed<br />
in place, there would have been 70,000 additional Public<br />
Servants, all doing some work and all costing an awful lot<br />
to provide programs for them to administer. It is the first<br />
time in the history of Australia, as I believe, that the<br />
Public Service has been reduced -in size by something over<br />
considerably over 10,000 and held, was kept down, to that<br />
reduced size for a period of years.<br />
I know that my most distinguished predecessor at one stage<br />
reduced 10,000 people from the Public Service but within ten<br />
months they were all back in the Public Service and a few more<br />
besides. We have shown more continuing determination than that. Since<br />
1975-76, Government expenditure has been virtually held in<br />
real terms.<br />
Because there has been a little argument about how much<br />
expenditure restraint there has been, let me refer to the<br />
figures John Howard used in his Budget speech. In the three<br />
years before 1972, real expenditure by the Commonwealth grew<br />
by 4 3/ 4 per cent a year. In real terms. That I think was a<br />
bit much in restrospect. In the three years of Labor it<br />
grew by over 10 per cent in real terms. That I am certain<br />
was much too much, as we all know. In the last three years<br />
it has grown by 1 per cent or less a year. A very great deal<br />
of restraint indeed. It is the first time, I believe, that<br />
Commonwealth expenditures have been held, certainly constant,<br />
over a considerable period. / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
That is all the more noted, when you understand that there<br />
have been some areas of expenditure where we have had to<br />
provide more funds and where I am certain you would have<br />
wanted us to provide more funds. How many of us understand<br />
that in 1968 there were 176 welfare recipients for every<br />
1,000 people in the workforce. Now, for a variety of reasons,<br />
because returned men from the last World War many of them<br />
are turning 60 and are eligible for the Service Pension<br />
because in any case we have an ageing population, there are<br />
more people of pensionable age. There are now 100 more.<br />
276 welfare recipients for every 1,000 people in the workforce.<br />
But I haven't heard anyone point to expenditure restraint<br />
saving we should deny pensions to repatriation people. I<br />
haven't heard anyone saying that we should extend the pension<br />
age for women. * I haven't heard anyone saying we should reapply<br />
the means test for people over 70. 1 haven't heard anyone<br />
saying that we should reduce the general level of pensions<br />
to people who are old and who have worked for this nation in<br />
the pas-t. I don't believe there is anyone here who would say it.<br />
There is an inexorable demand for additional funds in<br />
that area. An equally strong demand for additional funds in<br />
defence. Each year we have provided more in real terms. This<br />
year $ 281 million more and that is a very considerable increase.<br />
Under Labor, they averaged 7 per cent of the defence budget<br />
on defence equipment. They were using up the defence forces.<br />
They were using up defence infrastructure. we have build that<br />
up considerably to over 15 per cent of the vote going on<br />
equipment not yet enough, but much better than it was.<br />
Under Labor,. manpower was taking 60 per cent of the total vote.<br />
We have dropped that back to nearly 50 per cent, so that more<br />
funds are going really to improve and advance the quality of<br />
Australia's defence. That is a good thing.<br />
Partly as a result of other economic policies, there have<br />
been one or two real breakthroughs within the defence area.<br />
I can remember two years ago Jim Killen bringing a submission<br />
( 3 to Cabinet to award a major shipping contract to a French firm<br />
$ 70 million or $ 80 million. And we all said, after looking<br />
at it " look, can't we give. an Australian firm, Australian<br />
corporation, one small opportunity to tender for this contract..<br />
Does it have to go overseas".<br />
So we went back to Australian<br />
industry. Yesterday Jim Killen announced the successful<br />
tender, Vicker Is Cockatoo Docks, and did we have to give any<br />
did we have to provide any subsidy? No, because they<br />
quoted under the French contract. In other words, for a highly<br />
sophisticated piece of defence equipment costing about $ 70 million<br />
an Australian concern has been able to beat the world. Isn't<br />
it time we started having a little pride in what Australia can<br />
perform, instead of knocking Australia at every opportunity as<br />
so much of this community seems to do. </p>
<p>-8<br />
As we believe there has been a great demand for additional<br />
sums to support industry, that also has been provided.<br />
Because of increased demands on the Budget in areas such as<br />
social welfare, which I know is a favourite one for people<br />
to say cut expenditure but they don't like it very muchwhen<br />
you say precisely where. Greater demands from social<br />
welfare, greater demands from defence, a greater requirement<br />
to support industry so that jobs can be provided in a real way,<br />
the expenditure restraint that we have encompassed is all the<br />
more remarkable.<br />
This Budget reduces the deficit substantially indeed, from<br />
nearly $ 3,500 mil-lion to under $ 2,200 million.<br />
That is a reduction of 3.4 per cent of gross domestic product<br />
to 1.9 per cent of gross domestic product.. Now, I took out some<br />
figures and compared that with what's happening in North America<br />
and Europe and that is a much lower percentage of the gross<br />
domestic product, or deficit, or the gross domestic product<br />
than in Japan or Germany, the United Kingdom or Canada or<br />
many other advanced western countries. It is a tremendous<br />
achievement. It means that this is really is an anti-inflationary<br />
Budget. It means that Australia can look with pride at what<br />
this Budget achieves in that particular area.<br />
The domestic deficit is down more than half to a little under<br />
$ 900 million. This . means a further downward pressure on<br />
inflation. It strengthens the Australia dollar. Remember how<br />
Mr. Hayden was trying to knock our policies, undermine confidence<br />
in the Australian dollar. That sort of comment today would<br />
be laughed out of court, because our policies have led to a<br />
continuing strengthening of the dollar on international markets<br />
and greater and greater investment-from overseas as confidence<br />
in our policies grows.<br />
This is all creating conditions for continuing business<br />
expansion. We have reduced taxes. The surcharge comes off on December 1.<br />
C If there is anyone who thinks that tax cut is a hoax, why don't<br />
they Just write out a check and send the tax cut back to the<br />
Treasury and see how they like that. I am sure we can find<br />
some arrangement so that Treasury can receive it. But from<br />
the 1st of December $ 4.45 a week for a person on average<br />
weekly earnings. John Howard said in May that we couldn't<br />
take of the surcharge and restore indexation at one time. We<br />
do remain committed to the re-establishment of tax indexation.<br />
That is taking all factors into account. We can be helped in<br />
that if there is a degree of restraint in the decisions of<br />
the Arbitration Commission. over the last day or two one or<br />
two people have tried to say as incomes go up, taxes will go up<br />
and that is wrong. But it is not a very novel idea. I think<br />
when people get an increase in their wages, an increase in<br />
their incomes, they know they are going to have to pay tax<br />
on that increase. To suggest that they shouldn't be paying<br />
tax on their increase, and that there is some kind of hoax or<br />
fraud involved in that, is the greatest piece of humbug that<br />
I have ever heard of. </p>
<p>9-<br />
But the truth of the matter is that for every additional<br />
dollar earned, as a result of taking that surcharge of f,<br />
taxpayers will pay less tax on those additional dollars than<br />
they~ would have payed if the surcharge stayed on. People<br />
can argue that they would sooner have tax indexation and<br />
the surcharge off. That is fair enough. It's a legitimate<br />
argument. They can argue that the tax cuts should have been<br />
greater, and that is a legitimate argument. They can argue<br />
about economic responsibility. But they can't argue that<br />
what was done wasn't plain and straighforward and easily<br />
understood.<br />
The Budget embodies special policies for business, for the<br />
rural community. It advances our energy policy further.<br />
For the business community there are new initiatives designed<br />
to encourage the development of more efficient and exportorientated<br />
and competive industries. I am sorry for the<br />
technical term, but Division 7 tax, the retention allowance<br />
first lifted from 50% to 60% in an earlier budget, now lifted<br />
to 70%. That will be a great help for small business people.<br />
Export expansiLon grants have been greatly increased from<br />
million to $ 170 million one Budget to the next. There was some<br />
backlog in the past, but the program has been much successful<br />
than we dreamt of because Australian firms have been much<br />
more successful than we believed in getting out into export<br />
markets. That is an expenditure that I think the Treasurer<br />
won't cry about, because it indicates the success of Australian<br />
industry and if they are going to be selling that way it means<br />
they are going to be employing more people in the process.<br />
Industrial research and development grants are up significantl. y.<br />
Export market development grants are also growing very greatly.<br />
There are some people who have been claiming that we have no<br />
policy for employment. I think that is about the falsest thing<br />
of all. We certainly don't want a program which leads to<br />
false ideas, to phony jobs. The Labor Party were having a<br />
RED scheme and it didn't work, and even they abandoned it.<br />
False jobs destroy -confidence. They waste funds and could lead<br />
to less overall employment than would otherwise occur.<br />
Our policies for a stronger private sector result in policies<br />
for jobs. Low inflation enables firms to compete and to sell<br />
and therefore they need people to work. The research and<br />
development programs in industry enable new products to be<br />
built and that provides jobs. Export incentives obviously<br />
provide jobs. As firms export more, produce more, they need to<br />
employ more. I.<br />
The great infrastructure program an initiative of this<br />
Government enabling the States to borrow overseas to support<br />
major resource projects, in coal loaders and electricity<br />
generation and many other things, all of that provides jobs.<br />
Nearly $ 500 million dollars alone in this one year, will be<br />
borrowed overseas to support major infrastructure developments<br />
backing up the investment programs in Australia's great capital<br />
resources and all of that provides jobs. </p>
<p>10<br />
The investment allowance, the training programs, the amendments<br />
to the Industries Assistance Commission in which. we said they<br />
ought to take into account the social<br />
and employment consequences of their decisions. I don't know<br />
that they always do it as much as we would like, but we have.<br />
put it into the act, and that is a program for jobs. All of<br />
this is because of our concern for employment. But real<br />
employment that will last, provide rewarding work for people<br />
and add to the wealth and the strength of this nation.<br />
I think our help to small business is particularly important<br />
because as I said earlier, the United States' experience has<br />
shown firms employing 20 people or less generated66 per cent<br />
of all new jobs in the United States between 1960 and 1976.<br />
If that can happen there it can happen also in Australia.<br />
We support employment by getting this country moving. Creating<br />
a.. climate for private investment and enterprise. In coal<br />
alone, there are announced projects worth $ 2 billion. In bauxite<br />
and alu-minium there are announced programs of a further $ 2 billion.<br />
Under mining and manufacturing investment, under the surveys<br />
of the Department of Industry and Commerce, total $ 12 billion<br />
of firmly committed projects or projects in the final feasibility<br />
stage. W. D. Scott had a detailed survey and they said the<br />
figure was nearly $ 30,000 million of major investment ready to<br />
go over the next five years. That is their survey $ 30,000 million.'<br />
I don't back it up. I just state the figure for what it is<br />
worth. It is absurd to suggest that the Government is not<br />
concerned with jobs, it is not concerned with employment,<br />
I would believe that we are more concerned than many others<br />
because we are prepared to stay with policies that are real<br />
instead of being prepared to erect a shop window that doesn't<br />
really mean anything very much at all. That might give a false<br />
hope and a false expectation. We are not prepared to indulge<br />
in that kind of deception.<br />
For the rural community, special depreciation allowance has<br />
reappeared for the storage of grain, and hay and fodder.<br />
The national water resource program expands by 25 per cent this<br />
year. Our energy programs are designed to achieve conservation,<br />
alternative sources of energy, greater exploration and<br />
development. Import pricing of oil is a vital ingredient<br />
in pursuit of those three objectives. But we also encourage<br />
the use of gas, a greater use of coal. The Budget continues<br />
that path; special investment and write-off policies for<br />
the conversion of industrial heating equipment. We are going<br />
to provide the same incentives to exploration onshore as we<br />
have been providing offshore to make ourselves more self-sufficient<br />
if that is possible. / 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
our expenditure restraint has been stringent, but I believe<br />
fair. We haven't lost sight of social reform and the needs<br />
of people less well off in the Australian community.<br />
Family allowances will remain one of the major social reforms<br />
of all time. It was this Government that indexed pensions.'<br />
In the last three years, 15,000 beds and places have been<br />
provided, homes for aged people in our population. Over the<br />
last two Budgets record sums have been provided under the<br />
Handicapped Person's Assistance Act, to given handicapped<br />
people a better deal than I believe they have ever had before<br />
from the Australian community.<br />
The Budget builds on what we have done in the past. Because<br />
inflation is higher than we were advised at the time of<br />
the last Budget, indexed pensions and benefits will again be<br />
indexed twice-yearly and not once a year. There will be<br />
increased income support for those eligible for fringe<br />
benefits. Again, helping many of the lower income people<br />
in the community. Eligibility for pensioner health benefit<br />
cards are being extended to single parent beneficiaries.<br />
There have been many advances and changes in repatriation<br />
benefits for returned servicemen.<br />
The Budget builds on the strength of the economy. It responds<br />
to dangers that there are in the present situation. It is<br />
clear that Australia is living in a difficult and an economic<br />
terms, a som-tewhat dangerous world. Inflation is rising in<br />
North America and in much of Europe. Because of that I believe<br />
world trade is going to remain sluggish. In the last seven<br />
or eight years it has grown by only about 4 per cent a year.<br />
In the preceding 20 years it grew by 9 per cent a year.<br />
In t,-hose figures alone we find much of the reason for<br />
higher unemployment in North America , in Europe, and in<br />
advanced developed countries.<br />
I don't think there is going to be much change in that, because<br />
under policies being pursued in North America, being pursued<br />
in Europe, inflation will remain too high and<br />
therefore growth in world trade too low.<br />
That doesn't mean however, that we need to be gloomy about<br />
Australia's future, because if we continue on our present path,<br />
keep our inflation ratebelow that of many other major countries,<br />
it is Australian industries that will become more competitive,<br />
it is Australian industries that will capture better markets<br />
and more markets in Australia and overseas. Then again, if<br />
we continue to capitalise on the great resources within this<br />
nation, in energy and in minerals, we can attract to Australia<br />
investment of a kind which is not available to many other countries.<br />
Even countries with the same resources often don't have the<br />
political stability or the economic commonsense or the<br />
attractiveness as a reliable supplier of this nation. / 12 </p>
<p>12<br />
Therefore, because we possess great natural resources,<br />
because we are an energy supplier, because we have policies<br />
that bear down on inflation, because we are attractive<br />
to foreign investment and devise policies which deliberately<br />
seek to attract people from overseas, we can expect to<br />
get in Australia greater economic activity, greater<br />
movement within our economy than might otherwise occur.<br />
That means I think, that even if the world trading is<br />
difficult in the years ahead, if we run our own ship<br />
properly, if we keep a tight control over our own expenditure,<br />
and keep inflation below that of major countries overseas,<br />
we can look after Australia and get through a difficult time<br />
much, better than most other countries.<br />
If we can have pride in our own achievements, pride in what<br />
has happened within this economy, a confidence in ourselves<br />
as many people overseas are plainly showing confidence in<br />
Australia, voting with their dollars the confidence in Australia,<br />
then the 1980s can indeed be a good period for Australia.<br />
There are many things I think we can do. I believe that much<br />
too often we find people within Australia who knock this<br />
nation, who say we can't do it, that other people can do it<br />
better. I have given one example of a ship that we can build<br />
better than anyone else for less money than anyone else. There<br />
are many other examples. We produce world-class cars, but<br />
how many people still want to buy the car with the foreign<br />
label on it, because they think it might be better and they<br />
will pay three or four times the price, Why can't we have<br />
pride in what we do ourselves and what we build ourselves<br />
through the skills of our own people.<br />
It is up to us as Liberals, all of us, to know what we have<br />
achieved in controlling inflation, in our energy policies,<br />
in our taxation reforms, in our support to business, in our<br />
social reform. We need to make sure that everyone else knows<br />
about this. We can't expect necessarily to have all the<br />
things that we've done on the front pages of the newspapers,<br />
because it is only bad news that is news. The good news we<br />
will have to spread abroad ourselves.<br />
The successes we have had have been hard won. Do you think we<br />
likedmaking the decisions in May not to remove the<br />
tax surcharge. But we had to do it because it was necessary.<br />
It has been taken now off in this Budget, now that the economy<br />
can afford it. Our first obligation is to keep Australia on<br />
the road to economic recovery and we will meet that obligation.<br />
Even it that means a degree of unpopularity in the short term.<br />
Because we are not a short-term Government, full of short-term<br />
ideas which will shortchange the Australian people.<br />
We. are a Government responsibility and stability, committed<br />
to doing what has to be done to advance Australia; comitted to<br />
our own Liberal philosphy of free enterprise, of independence<br />
of the human spirit, of encouragement to individial initiative,<br />
and of care for those who really need assistance from the<br />
community, from Government. / 13 </p>
<p>13<br />
The Budget maintains economic progress. It is a Budget<br />
for lowering taxes. It is a Budget of smaller Government,<br />
of increased incentive, of an increased role for private<br />
enterprise and initiative. It reaffirms-the national<br />
Liberal initiative in social reforms. It is a Budget<br />
to -proclaim it is a Budget to sell-, * it* is a Budget<br />
as I believe, for all Australians. 000---</p>
