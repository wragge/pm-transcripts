STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, HON P. J. KEATING NMP<br />
A NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS<br />
SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES<br />
The Governmnent has agreed to implement a national strategy aimecd for the adoption of<br />
new information and communications services and technologies the so-called<br />
' information superhighway'.<br />
These new service~ s and technologies will change the way wc live, work and play.<br />
Their effect on our businesses, our schools and universities, our hospitals, our<br />
governments, and many other aspects of our daily lives, will be profound.<br />
We have the opportunity to plan for a fairer, healthier, better educated and more<br />
productive ' information society, through a managed and consultative approach to the<br />
use of information and communications services and technologies.<br />
In building a national strategy, we wilt draw on a number of recent expert<br />
investigations into Information and communications services and technologies such as<br />
the Broadband Services Expert Group, the Australian Science and Technology Council<br />
review of the provision of Tnternet services in Australia, and an independent revicw of<br />
the Commonwealth's acquisition and use of information technology.<br />
The best way to address the issues raised by these reports is thr-ough a coordinated and<br />
whole-of-government approach, particularly in the areas of formation of national<br />
policy, the Government's own use of technologies, and industi-y development.<br />
To achieve this, we will establish an Ad Hoc Committee of Cabinet, which I will chair,<br />
which will consider the development of a national strategy on information and<br />
communications networks and services.<br />
We will also establish a high level policy body within goverinment, reporting to the Ad<br />
Hoc Committee of Cabinet through the Minister for Communications and thc Arts.<br />
This body will provide advice on broad national policy issucs, and also identify matters<br />
for discussion by governmnent, industry and the community.<br />
At the June 1994 meeting or the Prime Minister's Science and Engineering Council,<br />
many of these reports were discussed, and significant national issues raised. Building<br />
on these discussions, I have establishcd the National Information Services Council<br />
under the auspices of this peak body. </p>
<p>The National Information Services Council will be a high level discussion forum for<br />
broad policy issues, providing industry and conununity input into the Government's<br />
consideration of the issues.<br />
An important part of any national strategy will be addressing the Government's own<br />
use of communications services and technologies, We have decided to establish a<br />
Government Information Services Policy Board to coordinate a user-driven whole-ofgovernment<br />
approach to the Government's use of these important services and<br />
networks. This Board will be chaired by a new position of Chief Government<br />
Information Officer in the Finance portfolio, and supported by an Office of<br />
Governincnt Information Technology.<br />
We are also considering ways in which we can stimulate the use of information and<br />
communications services and technologies in various sectors of the economy including<br />
industry, education, employment, social services and other areas. We have agreed<br />
that: We will pursue the use of information and communications technologies to<br />
deliver government services to business, foster the development of information<br />
technology and telecommunications industries in Australia, and explore ways of<br />
ensuring we have an effective science base.<br />
We will explore ways of networking schools and TAFEs, and of making<br />
available educational services and content on public access networks.<br />
We will develop the usc of networks to improve the delivery of social and<br />
employment services to Australians, and as commuunication tools for<br />
communities. We will encourage best practice in the use of information and<br />
communications services and technologies in government, and as part of this<br />
press forward with the staged implementation of electronic commerce by<br />
Commonwealth agencies.<br />
Thesc activities are a beginning. Clearly, much more will need to be done.<br />
We have agreed that, over the next year, we will consider further the various issues<br />
relating to industry, social services, education, research, regulations, access, privacy,<br />
security and a wide range of other factors affecting the uptake of the new information<br />
and communications services and technologies.<br />
We aim to address these issues in a systematic way, and put in place, by the cnd of this<br />
year, processes and policies which will provide the leadership and framework for<br />
moving into the next century.<br />
