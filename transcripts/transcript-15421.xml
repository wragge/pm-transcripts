    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Harper and I have agreed today to enhance our cooperation on climate change and energy.  We want to contribute to effective global solutions that ensure secure, affordable supplies of energy and support economic growth.</p>
<p>As major energy producers, Australia and Canada have a significant stake in a comprehensive global approach to climate change.  We believe there should be international consensus on a long-term global emissions reduction goal, to which all major economies should contribute.  We have welcomed the APEC Leaders' Sydney Declaration on Climate Change, Energy Security and Clean Development as a significant step forward.  We will participate in the US-sponsored meeting of major economies later this month.  We will support the launch of negotiations on a post-2012 agreement at the UN Climate Change Conference in Indonesia in December.</p>
<p>Australia and Canada will continue our cooperation on international partnerships to reduce emissions and promote energy security, particularly through the development and deployment of zero- and low-emission technologies.  I have welcomed Prime Minister Harper's interest in Canada joining the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate.  Canada's status as a major producer and exporter of energy and clean energy technologies makes it a natural candidate for the Partnership. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Harper and I have agreed that forestry and, in particular, reducing emissions from deforestation, is critical to addressing climate change.  We have agreed on the need for effective international action to enhance the management, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests. </p>
<p>Australia and Canada share around half the world's reserves and production of uranium.  We have therefore discussed the contribution Australia and Canada can make in developing the safe and secure use of nuclear energy, and the contribution it can make to both energy and climate security.</p>
<p>Recognising the importance of action on climate change and energy, Prime Minister Harper and I have agreed to convene a climate and energy session in the Australia-Canada dialogue, pursue further cooperation on clean energy technologies, jointly promote sustainable forest management and collaborate on advanced nuclear technologies.</p>
