    <content><![CDATA[<p>Good evening, in the last three months, the global financial crisis has deteriorated dramatically.</p>
<p>We now face a global economic recession - with a massive impact on jobs right across the world.</p>
<p>What began with unrestrained greed on Wall Street has now spread across every economy in the world.</p>
<p>For Australia this reality has also hit home. Six of our ten major trading partners are now in recession.</p>
<p>Our biggest trading partner, China, has had its growth forecasts halved in the last year.</p>
<p>Australia faces a stark choice.</p>
<p>Act now to reduce the impact on the economy, families and jobs.</p>
<p>Or fold your arms and allow the free market to run its course.</p>
<p>The policy of this government is to act and to act decisively.</p>
<p>Today we have launched a massive nation-building plan to support jobs and small businesses in the short term and to build schools, energy efficient housing and roads for the long term.</p>
<p>The centre piece of the Plan is the largest single school modernisation program in Australia's history.</p>
<p>We will fund a new 21st century school library, multipurpose hall, or classroom modernisation for each of Australia's 7,400 primary schools.</p>
<p>We will also provide funding for new science labs or language centres for 500 secondary schools.</p>
<p>We will provide grants of up to $200,000 for individual school communities to fund much-needed maintenance.</p>
<p>Second, the Government will install ceiling insulation in up to 2.7 million Australian homes  -  with the aim of having insulation in every Australian owner/occupier house  -  good for the environment and good for jobs.</p>
<p>Third, we will fund the largest ever single investment in housing by building more than 20,000 new community and defence homes to help keep our tradesmen and women employed.</p>
<p>Fourth, we will act to support households bearing the brunt of the crisis by stimulating the economy now by paying $950 one-off tax bonuses to low and middle income families, singles, students, drought affected farmers and single income families.</p>
<p>Fifth, for small business we will deliver a 30 cent in every dollar investment tax break for the immediate period ahead.</p>
<p>In this plan, we are investing in the future and investing also to support Australian jobs.</p>
<p>Because of the global recession the Government will go into temporary deficit and once the global economy recovers, act to restore our budget to surplus.</p>
<p>That's the responsible course of action for the nation.</p>
<p>I recognise that a temporary deficit may not be popular.</p>
<p>But that is the global reality we face with virtually all Governments now in deficit.</p>
<p>I cannot remove the impact of the global recession on Australian jobs.</p>
<p>But by Government action we can reduce it.</p>
<p>I have absolute confidence that this strategy, combined with the great underlying strengths of the Australian economy and people, will see our nation through this crisis.</p>
<p>I thank you for listening.</p>
<p>A video of this speech is also available.</p>
