JAUSTRALIA<br />
FOR MEDIA 15 DECEMBER 1987<br />
At the invitation of the Governor-General, Her Majesty Queen<br />
Beatrix and His Royal Highness Prince Claus of the<br />
Netherlands will make a State Visit to Australia from 24<br />
October to 5 November 1988.<br />
The Queen and Prince Claus are expected to visit Canberra,<br />
Tasmania, South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales.<br />
This visit is particularly apt in our Bicentennial year<br />
because of the historical links between Australia and the<br />
Netherlands, and the participation by the Netherlands in our<br />
national celebrations. It will also serve to enhance the<br />
warm relations existing between our two countries. 003427 </p>
