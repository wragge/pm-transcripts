TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
16 MARCH 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I would like to begin by saying that the High Court decision is an historic<br />
decision a great decision for the Aboriginal community of this country, and<br />
a huge endorsement of the policies of this Labor Government, in respect of<br />
the Native Title Act. It means that, as a consequence of this matter being<br />
decided once and for all that, as a consequence of this Government's<br />
legislation, more will have been done in the last two years than was done in<br />
the last 200 years to guarantee justice for Aboriginal people in terms of their<br />
access to land, with land coming to them as an inherent right, rather than<br />
simply a statute right delivered by some Parliament. It also endorsed fully the<br />
Commonwealth approach to protecting Native Title recognising it, protecting<br />
it and ensuring that workable process exists for land management across<br />
every State and territory. It found that the whole of the West Australian Act<br />
was inoperative and Inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act, and<br />
thereby invalid. The West Australian Act failed because it was racially<br />
discriminatory, that is, it failed because it was inconsistent with the Racial<br />
Discrimination Act. The West Australian Government has no choice now but<br />
to fall into line with the High Court decision, and again I remind people that as<br />
I did in Western Australia a couple of weeks ago, that there has now been<br />
some 8000 grants of interest in land been issued by the Western Australian<br />
Government, a large proportion of which are probably invalid. I have pointed<br />
that out I wrote to the Premier 18 months ago thereabouts telling him that<br />
a continuation of grants of interest in this way was probably Invalid, and now<br />
that has been proven to be the case. The only thing I would say is, the<br />
Commonwealth is, nevertheless, prepared to work with Western Australia to<br />
ensure that issues arising from this decision are addressed cooperatively, and<br />
already we have had preliminary talks at Ministerial level with the Court<br />
Government. But can I say that this reaves a real question for the Federal Coalition it is<br />
impossible for the Federal Coalition to maintain its stated opposition to a </p>
<p>TEL: 16. Mar. 95 18: 19 No. 01<br />
2<br />
balanced approach to the Native Title Legislation. Now you know the<br />
Government has got now two pieces of law into place the Native Title Act<br />
and the Land Fund. The Native Title Act gives Aboriginal people the right to<br />
access to land where they can establish a traditional connection with the land<br />
-a right which has existed before European settlement. Where those rights<br />
have been extinguished, and where Aboriginal people are desirous of reestablishing<br />
that connection with the land, the Land Fund gives them the<br />
possibility of buying that land and making it. These are always the two parts<br />
of the Act, and again I just make the point that I have made to you often we<br />
get progress in this country by victories, by wins. The Native Title Act, and<br />
the Government's Insistence upon It in the Parliament against the<br />
intransigencies of the Senate, was a victory for the Aboriginal people and for<br />
the Government, and so too was the case with the Land Fund which was,<br />
upon its return to the House of Representatives, an unacceptable piece of<br />
proposed legislation. And the Government then introduced it again for the<br />
second time, and the Coalition decided they could not obstruct any further.<br />
It's because of our insistence that the Aboriginal people have now got these<br />
two pieces of legislation into place, but the stated policy of the Federal<br />
Opposition at this point articulated last by Mr Downer -is that he would<br />
consider the repeal of the Native Title Act upon coming to Government. Now<br />
John Howard has made it very clear that he will repeal the Land Fund<br />
provisions when he comes to Government. He now must say where he stands<br />
on the Native Title Act. Do they continue to take the view the wrong and<br />
misguided view that a right of Aboriginal people inherent in the Common<br />
Law, a right which has existed now since before European settlement should<br />
be denied them, and we go back to some sort or statutory provision for the<br />
basis of land? Because what the High Court made very clear, was that the<br />
Western Australian legislation took away these inherent rights, and<br />
substituted a very minimum statutory right, and the taking away of these<br />
inherent rights and the replacement with a minimum statutory right, was not<br />
only contrary to the Racial Discrimination Act, but morally was bankrupt, and<br />
now is the case for John Howard to say where he stands. Is he going to<br />
repeal the Native Title Act, as he says he will repeal the Land Fund Act, or<br />
change it beyond recognition? Or are they finally going to say there ought to<br />
be some justice for Aboriginal people that they are entitled to land which was<br />
theirs as the High Court has said since before European settlement? Are<br />
they finally going to come to terms with the oldest Australians the people<br />
who inhabited this continent before any of the rest of us arrived, and desist<br />
from this sort of view they have that seems to permeate all of their attitudes,<br />
and that is that any inherent right to land for Aboriginal people, runs against<br />
their grain? This is the test for them a test of principle.<br />
I might just complete my remarks by saying that the High Court found 7 to 0<br />
7-nil that the West Australian Act failed because It was Inconsistent with the<br />
racial Discimination Act. It has not only endorsed the Law, It has endorsed<br />
the policy adopted by the Government, and as a consequence, for the first<br />
time In the history of European settlement of this country, Aboriginal people<br />
have now got an Inherent right to land in this country. 8 P. 02/ 10i </p>
<p>TEL 3<br />
J: Prime Minister, are you prepared to talk to the Court Government on the basis<br />
of your original offer that is, including compensation etc even though the<br />
deadline passed in December?<br />
PM: The original offer which we made for compensation and carrying the costs<br />
stands. But it doesn't stand for grants of interest made after the cut-off date<br />
the ones which were done against the Commonwealth law, and against advice<br />
from me.<br />
J: When is that date?<br />
PM: Well you go and look that up I haven't got it in my head right now.<br />
J: Is it still possible.... would it still be possible for the West Australian<br />
Government to attempt to obstruct the workings of the Native Title Tribunals In<br />
some way, and if you think it is, is there anything the Commonwealth<br />
Government can do about it?<br />
PM: It would be very wilful obstruction, It's obstructing against the operation of a<br />
piece of law firstly agreed by both houses of the Commonwealth parliament,<br />
adopted by all of the States of Australia bar Western Australia, against now<br />
an express decision of the High Court, and a very clear one: 7 to zero, 7 to<br />
nothing. At what point does the Western Australian Government feel it has<br />
any legitimacy in its view, and capitulate to what Is very clear national<br />
sentiment of this issue?<br />
J: So, back to the cut-off date you were just talking about would you the<br />
Western Australians might be disadvantaged because of that...<br />
PM: Only by Richard Court...<br />
J: isit fair to disadvantage them because of the actions of their Premier?<br />
PM: This is the advice I gave Richard Court I said on 6PR on Perth, so I am<br />
telling you, " there is a lot of villainy here on the part of the West Australian<br />
Government, and a lot of wilful villainy putting the interests of Western<br />
Australians, and Western Australian businesses, at risk by granting interest in<br />
land which is ultra vires of the Commonwealth Act of Parliament, agreed to by<br />
every other state bar Western Australia". Now, the Western Australian<br />
Government the Premier went out of his way to issue these grants of<br />
interest against the Commonwealth Act under the shadow of what he thought<br />
would be a successful appeal. But against the advice of my letter to him -I<br />
wrote to him, saying don't do this. You must start thinking of the private<br />
interests of Western Australians and not your interests.<br />
J: Isn't he entitled to have his day in court?<br />
PM: He's had his dlay in court, and lost. But, while he was having it, he was<br />
issuing grants of interest, against the law. And, he was told so.<br />

J: So, you're own legislation, the Brandy case which was handed down by the<br />
High Court recently, means that the Native Tribunal can't actually make<br />
binding decisions. Are you going to fix that?<br />
PM: Well, look, at some point, some of the procedural issues In the law, the<br />
Commonwealth will look at but not to the principles. Some of the<br />
procedural issues, but not to the principles.<br />
J: Will that be done this year?<br />
PM: I don't know. I think we need more time to see how the Act is working.<br />
J: Mr Keating, Jeff Kennett today challenged you to adopt the German<br />
presidential system. Would you like to see....<br />
PM: Jeff's becoming a republican is he?<br />
J: . No, he said he was still a monarchist but, he said he would favour the<br />
German system.<br />
PM: He's confused isn't he, poor old Jeffrey.<br />
J: Would you like to see a system where he got a say in who was head of state?<br />
PM:-Let him put his hand up as an Australian and say the Australian head of state<br />
should be an Australian person when he says that he can have a<br />
conversation with me, but, if he wanders around with some sort of attitude<br />
which says that we should still be borrowing the monarchy of another country<br />
but, then, want to be taken seriously in the debate.... no, thank you.<br />
J: He said aspects of the German system appeal to him. He's obviously shifting<br />
ground...<br />
PM: Is he, well, like the rest of us, let him make a shift and we'll see how far he's<br />
shifted.<br />
J: Are you attracted to Sir Zelman Cowan's suggestion of using the selection of<br />
the next Governor General as a test case...?<br />
PM: I haven't thought about the next Governor General, the next Governor<br />
General's position, but, it does make one very clear point; I thought Sir<br />
Zelman's remarks made one very clear point, at the moment, the prerogative<br />
to appoint the Governor General rests with the Government and, fairly<br />
exclusively, with the Prime Minister. And, that's never been the case under<br />
any other option discussed by me, that is, in the future. In other words, at the<br />
moment, the Prime Minister has the right to propose to Her Majesty who the<br />
next person should be. So, all of these people going around saying, well, the </p>
<p>TEL<br />
Prime Minister wants to hang on to this... in fact, the Prime Minister is giving<br />
this away, obviously.<br />
J: How fast do you think the economy is slowing, has the need for tighter Budget<br />
and interest rate policy eased since the end of last year<br />
PM: I think the economy has slowed somewhat, I'm not sure how much. I don't<br />
think that diminishes the case for being vigilant on policy.<br />
J: Has the case for tightening before the Budget diminished from the point of<br />
view of those who are arguing that it is still over heating?<br />
PM: Well, the Government has made it.. The Treasurer spoke, I thought,<br />
eloquently, at the time, about the need for an appropriate stance on fiscal and<br />
monetary policy and I don't see anything that has happened since that should<br />
change that.<br />
J: Is the Government indulgent and complacent?<br />
P M: I don't think it is, but, again, if Gary Gray had issued those things in a press<br />
statement it wouldn't have even been reported in the Sydney Morning Herald.<br />
The fact that it gets front page lead is a commentary about the news<br />
judgement of the Herald.<br />
J: Prime Minister, John Howard, from what he is saying, is obviously not going to<br />
tell Mr Mctachlan to give back the documents, they're just going to leave it to<br />
McLachlan and his legal team, apparently. What does this say about<br />
PM. Well, I thought his interview, this morning, on John Laws, was extraordinary.<br />
It demonstrates a completely dishonest approach, it says he was party to the<br />
whole tactic in the House. He, as you say, hasn't returned the documents, the<br />
question Is, why does he wIsh to hang on to the documents. He, I would have<br />
thought, had a duty to give us a full list of the recipients of the documents and<br />
a categoric assurance that only one copy was made of the so called ' womens'<br />
document'. He has done none of these things.<br />
But, some of the pieces of the transcript, I thought, were unbelievable. He<br />
says and this is the blatant approach, the glibness, the belief that glib<br />
remarks dressed up in long sentences can somehow obscure what he Is<br />
saying such things as:<br />
" Did you go to the Opposition parliamentary tactics committee<br />
about it? ( JH) Oh, It was discussed among a number of us, yes.<br />
And, did they agree at that meeting, that it should be used?<br />

<p>T E L: 1 Mar 5 1&amp;: I9 NO 18 P. O06i1O<br />
6<br />
( JH) Oh, Ian had the authority to ask questions, there's no<br />
argument about that.<br />
And, then he goes on to say:<br />
( JH) " But, I don't feel at least, a bit apologetic about that.<br />
Now, understand what he is saying, there. He's saying: " we discussed the<br />
parliamentary tactic, I understood that Ian McLachlan was intending to<br />
mislead the House of Representatives, and I was party to its misleading".<br />
This is my point, Ian McLachlan resigned because he misled the House, John<br />
Howard knew he was going to mislead the House and was party to It,<br />
therefore, it follows, logically, doesn't it, that he should resign, too. And, I<br />
include the tactic, agreed also, was the throwing of the womens' document<br />
across the Chamber which must have been discussed in the tactics<br />
committee which he agreed to, as well. And then he says, of course, he's<br />
completely sensitive to Aboriginal people. He goes on to say and I thought<br />
that this was exceptionally breathtaking:<br />
( JH) " No, Ithink there is enormous difference between a gratuitous<br />
invasion of privacy of a third party and coming upon some documents<br />
which are involved in a highly controversial dispute."<br />
This is not a highly controversial dispute, this is a regal case. This Is a legal<br />
case, these are legal documents. But, he's saying that because they are<br />
disputed, it is a free-for-all. And, then, Laws is saying:<br />
" I wouldn't use it"<br />
and Howard says:<br />
' You wouldn't use It?"<br />
and he ( Laws) said:<br />
" Well, I'd have to work it out but I think it is a very bad thing."<br />
" So you say you wouldn't use it", says Howard.<br />
( JH) " Well, let's not be too moralistic about it."<br />
No let's not John ( Howard), lets not be moralistic at all. it's incredible, this<br />
stuff. And, then he said:<br />
( JH) " I think Ian McLachlan behaved correctly and I defend<br />
him." Can you believe that? I mean, the gall of it. </p>
<p>TEL: 16 . M ar. 951: 1 NO. 018 P. 07/ 10<br />
7<br />
you endorse the actions?<br />
( JH) Well, yes, I do."<br />
In other words, he endorsed the misleading of Parliament.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PMV: That Robert Tickner was not the photocopier and the source of dissemination<br />
of the information. He knew that, at the time, when the questions were being<br />
asked. And, he's going on today, this day:<br />
( JH) " I think Ian McLachlan behaved correctly and I defend<br />
him. So, you endorse his actions?<br />
( JH) Well, yes, I do."<br />
J, Mr Keating, going back to the native title...<br />
PMV: Can I just make a couple of other points before I do. He said.-<br />
( JH) ' There were questions asked about it but the nature of<br />
these discussions about any of these questions Is, you always<br />
have to-ing and fro-ing and then the decision is made. I accept<br />
the fact, and I have never disputed it, that I authorised the<br />
asking of those questions.<br />
I believe he told some of you that he wasn't involved in the tactics<br />
committee. ( JH) And I have never disputed it".<br />
You see, the glib... Is it any wonder Bill O'Reilly, the former tax<br />
commissioner, had trouble with him? Is it any wonder, when I lined up as<br />
Treasurer in 1983, desperate for some decent law, desperate for some<br />
integrity in the law, they looked to this government to clean up the tax system.<br />
Then he says:<br />
( JH) And I have never disputed that I authorised the<br />
askingof those questions, I don't try and shift the responsibility<br />
of the blame on to anybody else."<br />
In other words, he's now virtuous, you see. He is now virtuous. And let me<br />
just make a couple of other points I made abroad. He talks about the right of<br />
parliamentarians to represent a constituent. But, Mr McLachlan's obligations<br />
were to his Aboriginal constituents as well as what he might have seen to be<br />
the obligations to the constituent involved in the Hindmarsh court case. How </p>
<p>TEL: 16.1-Har. 95 j : 19 NO-018 P. 08/ 10<br />
8<br />
come his obligations to a constituent were only an obligation to the<br />
protagonist in the Hindmarsh Bridge case. And then, I made the point, and I<br />
make it again, here, neither Mr Howard nor Mr McLachlan were solicitors for<br />
the protagonists in the Hindmarsh Bridge case. They had no obligations to<br />
give them documents. None. Not as a regal obligation, not as their legal<br />
representatives. And, as their constituents, the protagonists had no more<br />
right to support from them than the Aboriginal people had right to protection<br />
from them. So, I think Mr Howard should be returning the documents, giving<br />
us these assurances about who received the documents and, remember, we<br />
are now having a discussion about an envelope which was in another<br />
envelope which was in a box. There are eight kilos of documents.<br />
J: Mr Keating, would you support Mr Tickner's letter to the Aboriginal<br />
communities call for them to jump into the debate?<br />
P M. Well, I was abroad when he wrote it but, the thing is, what he has said I don't<br />
have it with me is that and he wrote it before Ian McLachlIan resigned<br />
J: Do you support Mr Tickner's letter to the Aboriginal communities calling for<br />
them to jump into the dilemma?<br />
PM: Well, I was abroad when he wrote it. But the thing is what he said I don't<br />
have it with me what he said was and he wrote it before Ian McLachlan<br />
resigned, remember this, this was when at the height of their dishonour they<br />
had these documents and had opened them and disseminated them, he wrote<br />
to the Aboriginal communities telling them and saying that they should take<br />
whatever action they think is appropriate with the Coalition. Hardly an<br />
outrageous thing to do. But you see, our friend the wordsmith, Mr Howard, is<br />
out there and he thinks this is something you can jump on to but you always<br />
know with Howard, let him talk and he will dig himself into a deeper hole like<br />
he has done again today on John Laws.<br />
J. Mr Keating, near the end of the judgment today, the Justices conceded that<br />
there was practical difficulty in administering the legislation of Western<br />
Australia because of its size and, I guess, the amount of unalienated Crown<br />
Land. Just wondering, are you prepared to sort of accept with Western<br />
Australia there might be some special circumstances which the<br />
Commonwealth would take into account when negotiating with Western<br />
Australia in applying the Federal Act?<br />
PM: I have said that we will deal cooperatively with Western Australia and I have<br />
said that now for 18 months and we have already had preliminary talks at<br />
ministerial level. I don't want to give you a line which makes it other than<br />
completely clear that the Western Australian Act is held to be wholly invalid<br />
and inoperative because it was racially discriminatory and counter to the<br />
Racial Discrimination Act. That is the key news point. The associated news<br />
point is at last Aboriginal people have had justice in respect of land. The </p>
<p>TEL: 16. tlar., 95 18: 19 NO. 018 P. 09/ 10<br />
9<br />
ancillary point is that we will cooperate with Western Australia but we will not<br />
excuse Western Australia for wilful breeches of the Commonwealth law.<br />
J: Do you think there are any grounds for Western Australia claiming some<br />
special circumstances that make it distinct from.?<br />
PM: No. Other than to try and make it work. But not special in terms of the way<br />
the law applies.<br />
J: Prime Minister, are you saying that with Ian McLachlan giving the documents<br />
to his white constituents and not to his black constituents that that is a racist<br />
act?<br />
PM: No, you are saying that. What I am saying is that the notion that he felt an<br />
obligation to . Mr Howard would argue that MP's are all the time called upon to<br />
look after their constituent's interests. This is one of the weak and<br />
unprincipled areas of defence that Mr Howard had out last week. I am just<br />
making the point. How do they distinguish between their obligations to the<br />
Aboriginal constituents and to the protagonists of the Hindmarsh bridge case.<br />
If it is an obligation to a constituent, to which constituent? If not an obligation<br />
to all constituents.<br />
J: Well, they say, of course, that the protagonists in this case was the<br />
Commonwealth not the Aboriginal....<br />
PM: And they are Commonwealth Members of Parliament. As well you would have<br />
thought there would have been some identification with the interests of the<br />
Commonwealth seeing as they are desperate to become the Government of<br />
the Commonwealth, you would have thought at least the justice of the<br />
Commonwealth position in this. These were the documents of a court case<br />
being returned to the Commonwealth. This argument that Howard goes on<br />
with talking about the matter being a matter of dispute therefore, if it is a<br />
matter of dispute you can throw anyone's documents around. The fact that it<br />
is a legal matter and that now these documents have been published to other<br />
people who can now mount another appeal with these documents means that<br />
the rights of Aboriginal people have been transgressed here.<br />
J: ( inaudible) inclined to use legal action to get the documents back?<br />
PM: There is no reason why Mr Howard should keep the documents. What is he<br />
doing hanging on to the documents? What Is the game plan? Are there<br />
things there that he thinks the rest of the world should not see or we should<br />
not know about? Why does he not return the documents?<br />
J: Mr Keating, at what point will you make good the threat of legal action? How<br />
long does he have to hold on to them?<br />
PM: There was no threat of a legal action, as far as I know. </p>
<p>TEL f 1 Mar 1i: b 19 110uñ 01<br />
J: Is there any legal recourse open to the Government, Mr Keating?<br />
IPM: There may well be but I have had no advice of it. There is a simple point<br />
hI-1*. Mi, I I'z'VO1' J * hvuId 91Ve LtiQ dci'Uont~ oc Dut thii rcater po'int i-3, of<br />
course, what he has done today is to admit out of his own mouth that he knew<br />
Ian McLachlan was going to mislead the Parliament and he was party to the<br />
misleading.<br />
J: You have been hammering Mr Howard and yet his poll rate keeps going up?<br />
P M: Well, he has had a reasonable run for the period he has been leader but so<br />
did Mr Downer and so did [ Dr Hewson]. Last night my Press Secretary, Tony<br />
Melville, was at the airport and he was telling me that journalists waiting for<br />
me to land were talking about Howard and someone said, jocularly, there was<br />
no point asking Howard any questions, he has got no policy positions.<br />
Everyone sort of nodded in agreement. But that is right, isn't it? Here we are<br />
today, I am here announcing a decision by the High Court of Australia<br />
endorsing 7 to 0, a piece of legislation, probably one of the most far-reaching<br />
pieces of legislation acted since Federation. The week before I left to go<br />
abroad we had a huge victory in the Coalition's capitulation on the Land Fund.<br />
I can go around Europe talking about 6 per cent GDP growth and 2 per cent<br />
inflation and 4 per cent productivity growth and 3 3/ 4 per cent employment<br />
growth, no other Head of Government in the western world and the OECD<br />
area can do the same. The Government stands for things. The Government<br />
represents things. John Howard's policy Is to make himself so small a target<br />
as to be not noticed but then to be lauded as some sort of new-age person. I<br />
am only repeating now lines I have been through here before. He left<br />
Australia as an industrial graveyard in 1983. He left it to me amongst others<br />
to clean it up and make it into the modern, sophisticated, externally oriented<br />
country it now is. He should have been drummed out of the regiment, out of<br />
public life after 1982. The fact that he is the only leader they have after they<br />
twice passed over him with Hewson and then Downer, ought to be ringing<br />
bells in people's minds. But the media always wants a contest and are<br />
prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt. I have told you a week or so<br />
ago he would not change. I used the analogy of being in the calypso shirt<br />
saying " It's not me, it's not really me, I am not the same one" and he is doing it<br />
again today. And you have got to understand this about him. He never<br />
represented anything, he was always completely indecisive and I know, as I<br />
did as Treasurer, go back through the economy and the tax system, where his<br />
integrity stood. This is only further confirmation of it, this shabby affair of a<br />
week or two ago. So, the Australian people will come to acknowledge these<br />
things but winning elections in this country is never easy. One of the good<br />
things of Australian public life is you have always got to go out and earn it and<br />
I think we will earn it. But there should not be free rides for him either from<br />
anywhere, including, of course and most especially, the Sydney Morning<br />
Herald.<br />
