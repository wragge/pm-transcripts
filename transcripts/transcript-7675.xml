TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, TARAWA AIRPORT, KIRIBATI, 9<br />
JULY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST; Prime Minister, can you tell us, what's your<br />
interest driftnet fishing and what can the Forum do<br />
about it?<br />
PM: I think it really is a disaster for the region.<br />
Essentially what it is doing is taking a yield which is more<br />
than sustainable. In other words, if they keep taking a<br />
yield like this they'll eventually, and eventually not being<br />
a very long time, they'll wipe out the basic resource. For<br />
these, for so many of these small island states, this is<br />
virtually their only resource. Now the second part of your<br />
question, what can the Forum do about it? Well, I certainly<br />
intend to try and make it a major issue here and we will, I<br />
hope, adopt a resolution here which will be effective in<br />
regard to the activities of the Forum island states<br />
themselves, but I hope it will be a start then to trying to<br />
get universal action to ban this form~ of fishing which is,<br />
as I say, dangerous in terms of economics but also in<br />
environmental terms because it doesn't only take out fish.<br />
JOURNALIST: specific prescription of what that<br />
resolution might be like?<br />
PM: Well, no. I just don't land here and tell you<br />
before I talk to the people that I want to be talking with<br />
what's in the resolution. I've got some ideas about what it<br />
shoul4l contain, but I will be discussing this with the Forum<br />
leaders immediately tonight at the dinner.<br />
JOURNALIST: How much pressure can the Forum bring on<br />
countries like Japan and Taiwan?<br />
PM: Well, what is certain is that the Forum as a whole can<br />
do more than the individual countries can do, but I've had<br />
the opportunity of raising this matter in the last few weeks<br />
with the large powers that I've been talking with France<br />
and Britain and Germany and the United States and I got<br />
very positive reactions from them to this issue. So I think<br />
that from the Forum here we'll be able to start </p>
<p>an international push to get sense to prevail because there<br />
can be no sense in unregulated activities which have the<br />
nets 50 kilometres or more long just being dragged through<br />
the ocean taking everything in their paths and, as I say,<br />
wiping out in a relatively short time the basic resource of<br />
these countries as well as taking up into these nets birds,<br />
whales, all sorts of things as well a-s wiping out the<br />
fundamental resource. That is something that is not<br />
acceptable, I believe.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are nations which sell their fishing rights,<br />
like Kiribati, on side?<br />
P14: Well, we have had a recent meeting of Forum Fisheries<br />
Agency and my I've been reading in the plane coming out<br />
here, there is a fairly universal concern about this. There<br />
ought to be.<br />
JOURNALIST: What are you going to discuss with Mr Lange at<br />
your talks?<br />
PH: Well again, I think I'll do the discussion with him<br />
there rather than here if you don't mind.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you going to argue, try and convince him<br />
again not to institute the nuclear ships ban?<br />
PM: he doesn't need to see me at breakfast tomorrow to<br />
know what I feel about that. I've told him ad nauseam. I<br />
don't think he'll be wasting time by me going over that. He<br />
knows what my position is on that.<br />
JOURNALIST: He said here today that he will be talking to<br />
you about the New Zealand Anzac ship purchase. What are you<br />
going to say to him?<br />
PM: What I've been saying before, that he ought to buy four<br />
of them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, constitutional progress has still<br />
been slow in Fiji. Do you think there will be some<br />
discussion here or will it be glossed over at the Forum?<br />
PM: I don't think it will be a matter specifically on the<br />
Forum,. there might be some corridor discussion about it.<br />
JOURNALIST: What are the other important issues at this<br />
Forum?<br />
PH: Well, I think there's the general economic issues,<br />
trade issues and environmental issues in general. You'll<br />
remember at the last Forum I made the offer which was<br />
accepted with a considerable degree of pleasure that we<br />
, would finance the creation of monitoring stations in the </p>
<p>3.<br />
region here to look at what's happening to ocean levels and<br />
so on and I'll have something more specific and useful to<br />
say to them about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have we now reached the point where we should<br />
have a more permanent home for the Forum, that small<br />
countries like Kiribati have been over-tested in hosting<br />
PM: Come on, you've just arrived. I'm-sure by the time you<br />
finish here you'll be wanting to hold the next one here.<br />
ends </p>
