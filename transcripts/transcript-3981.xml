PRIME MINISTER<br />
( COMPLAINTS TO THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL)<br />
The Governor-General has made it known that certain complaints<br />
that were directed to him have been referred to me for advice.<br />
The complaints concern guidelines and the terms under which<br />
the present Government is operating up to the election.<br />
I have already made it plain that I have full confidence in<br />
Permanent Heads and that I believe they would not convey to<br />
their Departments any request that they believed to be outside<br />
the guidelines. But I also believe it appropriate that a<br />
procedure be established which will enable me to advise the<br />
Governor-General properly concerning complaints or petitions<br />
that might be directed to him.<br />
Therefore, such matters as are referred to His Excellency will<br />
be referred by me to the Chairman of the Public Service Board,<br />
and the Secretary of my Department, who would consult with the<br />
Head of the Department concerned. They would report to me and<br />
if necessary, I would consult with the Minister and advice<br />
would be forwarded to the Governor-General.<br />
.1 repeat that the undertaking that I have given to the<br />
. Governor-General ( that my Government will act as a Caretaker-<br />
Government until a general election is held) is to be<br />
strictly and scrupulously applied and any doubts that a Minister<br />
mayhave as to conduct in particular circumstances, should be<br />
discussed with his Permanent Head, the Chairman of the Public<br />
Service Board./ or with the Head of my Department. If these<br />
doubts remain, no action is to be taken until the matter is<br />
raised directly with me as Prime Minister.<br />
