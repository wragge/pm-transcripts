FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 67/ 1968<br />
VIETNAM MEDAL<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Queen has approved the Royal Warrant and design for<br />
the Vietnam Medal. In announcing this today the Prime Minister said that it was<br />
fitting that on the first occasion that Australia and New Zealand had designed<br />
a medal to recognise the operational service for members of their Defence<br />
Forces, both countries should again be fighting together helping to preserve<br />
national independence and freedom.<br />
The medal will be circular and, in keeping with all service<br />
medals, will have the Queen's portrait on the obverse. The reverse will<br />
have " Viet Nam" inscribed above a symbolic representation of the ideological<br />
war in Vietnam, depicting the figure of man in the centre of the medal<br />
standing between spherical shapes.<br />
The design, a departure from customary medal designs, was<br />
the work of the well-known Melbourne medallist Andor Messaros.<br />
The n-e dal is to be manufactured in Australia by the Royal<br />
Australian Mint6 Members of the Australian and New Zealand Armed Forces<br />
who render service in operations in Vietnam are eligible for the medal.<br />
Accredited members of approved Australian and New Zealand philanthropic<br />
organisations attached to those forces may also qualify for the award.<br />
CANBERRA 21 June 1968<br />
Background: In 1966, The Queen signified her willingness to approve the<br />
institution of the Vietnam Medal for award to Australian and New Zealand<br />
Forces who have served in Vietnam. The late Prime Minister announced<br />
this to the House of Representatives on 8 March 1966.<br />
Since the First Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment,<br />
returned to Australia on 8 June 1966, those qualified to receive the Medal<br />
have been wearing the ribbon which includes the colours traditionally<br />
symbolic of the three Services and also red and yellow which are the<br />
national colours of the Government of the Republic of Vietnam. </p>
