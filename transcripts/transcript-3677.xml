J~ AUSTRI A A<br />
PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO 482<br />
4 April 1975<br />
JOINT PRESS STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. WHITLAM<br />
AND THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN PREMIER, MR DUNSTAN<br />
The Australian and South Australian Governments<br />
have agreed on the terms for the transfer to the Australian<br />
Government of the non-metropolitan rail systems of South<br />
Australia. They have also agreed that South Australia will<br />
now cease to be claimant State before the Grants Commission.<br />
The announcements were made jointly today by the<br />
Prime. Minister, Mr Whitlam, and the South Australian<br />
Premier, Mr Dunstan. The agreements were concluded at discussions in<br />
Sydney on Wednesday between Mr Whitlam, Mr D~ unstan, the<br />
Australian Treasurer, Dr. Cairns, and the Australian<br />
Minister for Transport, Mr Jones.<br />
The Prime Minister and Premier emphasised that<br />
all employees of the S. A. Railways will be employed in<br />
either the'State on' Australian Railways service and that<br />
the terms and conditions of employment would be no less<br />
favourable than those presently applied.<br />
The Australian Government will assume<br />
responsibility for the financial operation of the country<br />
and inter-State systems.<br />
It will also assume the burden of the appropriate<br />
portion of the railways deficit as from 1 July 1974.<br />
The metropolitan rail system will remain<br />
the property of South Australia and will be operated by the<br />
State Transport Authority.<br />
There will be a cash adjustment involving a<br />
substantial payment to the Soueh Australian Government<br />
this financial year, and an appropriate adjustment to<br />
the level of financial assistance grants in future years. / 2 </p>

The agreement to transfer the South Australian<br />
non-metropolitan railways resulted from the offer contained<br />
in the Prime Minister's Policy Speech of November 1972<br />
for the Australian Government to accept responsibility<br />
for the railways of any State.<br />
" This agreement is a most significant event<br />
in the development of Australian railways and represents<br />
the first major step towards the creation of a truly<br />
national railway system," the Prime Minister and the Premier<br />
said. " This agreement will benefit South-Australia and<br />
Australian as a whole by enabling integration of Australian<br />
National Railways and S. A. R. systems; encouraging greater<br />
through-running of trains; fostering uniform purchasing and design<br />
programs enabling the better utilisation of capital funds; and<br />
removing unnecessary duplication between two of Australia's<br />
major railways. The decision to transfer only the non-metropolitan<br />
portion of the South Australian railways resulted from<br />
the recognition of the need to coordinate all Adelaide's<br />
urban transport modes under a single authority. However,<br />
the major freight terminals, and key freight and country<br />
lines inthe metropolitan area necessary for the efficient<br />
operation of inter-State and country trains will be<br />
transferred to the Australian Government. Where lines are<br />
jointly used by urgan and non-urban trains these lines will<br />
remain.. with the State but running rights will be granted<br />
to non -urban trains.<br />
