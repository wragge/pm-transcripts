THE HON. JON IOWARD MP<br />
DOORSTOP INTERVIEW -BALLARAT<br />
E<br />
PRIME MNISTER:<br />
Have you got any questiis?<br />
JRNLST: Mr Howard, do you think ( inaudible)?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Fabulous news because it's good for small. business, it's good for jobs, it's good for<br />
investment, it's good for families, particularly for. Austraian home buyers, all around,<br />
absolutely fabulous news.<br />
JRNLST: Is it good for a place Ballarat though that's got an unemployment level that's above the<br />
national average?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes it is because what it will do is produce aneven better climate for investment in<br />
small business. The key to reducing unemploment in Australia remains a growing<br />
small business sector and we have done many things to improve the small business<br />
climate. Low inflation, the interest rate cuts we've had, the new unfair dismissal laws<br />
that are removing the intimidatory aspects of the former law, the capital gains tax<br />
concessions, all of these things are building a better small business environment and that<br />
is particularly good for regional areas like Ballarat 30/ 81/ 97 11: 47 Pg: 7 </p>
<p>Fax from J~ IJST:<br />
couivo now to a further intorst rate Imu somnewhei, down the rm= k?<br />
PRINM NSTEL.<br />
I don't want to speculate about interet rates. We've -hed three cuts. Obviously if<br />
inlation stays down, tha?' s pood, big Pm, t ot going to get into this businass of; it's not<br />
rgt for me or the Tresm toe xtt busicess of spculating about future levels of<br />
interest rates but what we now have is a return to the low inflationary envirmmcat of<br />
the early 1970s and in the longer tegM indee in the mediu tarm that is tmendous<br />
news for the whole Australian commaurity.<br />
JRNL$ T:<br />
What = r the implications oftli budge bl'bw out going to be?<br />
PRIME. MINISTER:-<br />
I thinik you will find tha we will onoc again do the right thing y the Australian people.<br />
We will. get fte balance rig&amp; betweq g" thz id; of wnnmeay cexediture and<br />
equally protecting the, leaving intact the social securiy Safty net<br />
JRNLST: When will we be getting the tax cuts thro* gh<br />
PRE UMSTEL.<br />
Look, I don't bave aqydiing to add to whai Pdae Costello said yestrtday. Don t even try<br />
it<br />
JENUST: Surely anty increase in, employment just ini the small business sector is not going to fix<br />
the figure substantially. What else is there?<br />
PRIM NMITER.<br />
Over t= m Flaur, it is the only dhing that w ill slg~ cantly reduce unemployment<br />
becaus the big employer in the. Austlz tommity in the long term is te small<br />
business sector because it will grow mmr rapidly. Ifs no subject to the same<br />
downsizing as the larger corporatons and having a vigorous, sufficiently well<br />
deregulated small business sector is tremendously -important for fiture emaployment<br />
growth. But it will take time, it really will. I mean, if the former Govenment had 13<br />
yarm and left us with an umemployment raz of 8.5% and its importinant in the absuvd<br />
for them to be banging the tablc after only: 11 months and saying, why is it still 8-SO%?<br />
HOW ridiculous. HOW impatiuiet. Faoxm 30/ 01/ 97 11: 47 Pg: 8 </p>
<p>I Fax from JRNLST: Are you prepared to put any figure on what level you could reduce it to and when?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
NoIdon'tdealin those sorts of fi Ideal inasteadyresolve to redue<br />
unemployment over a period of time.<br />
JRNLST:<br />
Will this run iwno a honor budget as Gareth Evans said?<br />
PRME MINISTER<br />
No no. Gareth Eva= s is grasping for words., Hejust flailing around with a line. I<br />
mean, they were the mob that left us with he problems.<br />
JRNLST: How difficult is it going to be to get $ 3 billion wettb of cuts through the budgpt?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we shifted Si-8 billion in latbdgtW we will do the right thhxg byt<br />
Australian commmity. We will get * e balance ight We will be mong but fair once<br />
agaimn<br />
JANLST: Can you guarantee that thee will be no farther welfte cuts?<br />
PRIME M[ NISTER:<br />
Peter Costello gave a guarantee yesterday in relation to the social security safety net?<br />
JRNLST: Should the overnmat have kwwn aboul the Wugot blow out?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We did know about it and we revealed it yCsteaY. What happened ws that there was<br />
an estimating error made by the Treasuny acd the Auralian Taxation Offie. I'm not<br />
critcising them for that. Thse tinprae imprci. You're dealing with $ 130 billion<br />
in revenue and you're out in one year by $ 1.6 billion. It's repevttble but we've revealed<br />
the situation and we're setting about ixing it. 38/ 81/ 97 11: 47 Pg: 9 </p>
<p>Fax frpom JRNLST: Do you see a double dissolution if the Senate rejects the changes to migrants?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I like the idea of parliaments running their full term but I ought to say this, that there's<br />
very strong support in the Australian community for the measure to impose a two year<br />
waiting period on benefits for new migrants, very strong support in the Australian<br />
community for that measure. It's a fair measure. We're giving new arrivals fair warning<br />
of it and I think it's the sort of measure the Senate ought to pass without further delay.<br />
JRNLST: Will you go as far as to call a double dissolution?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, I don't deal in empty threats. I want to serve three years. I don't think the<br />
Australian public wants another election. The Australian public is fed up with early<br />
elections. The Australian public votes the Government for three years. They like it to<br />
run their three years.<br />
JRNLST: Do you think the Australian public though wants to see something done about<br />
unemployment in the short term? You keep referring to the long term. What about the<br />
short term?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think everybody would like to abolish unemploymcnt overnight but it's not real life to<br />
think that that's going to happen. When you've been in office for only 11 months and<br />
you've inherited an economy which a previous government mishandled for 13 years, it is<br />
quite ridiculous of that former government to then bang the table and say, why do we<br />
still have unemployment? It will take time. It will take time for some of the measures<br />
that we have already introduced to have a beneficial effect but you can't gainsay the fact<br />
that we've had three cuts in interest rates. We have an historically low level of inflation.<br />
We've introduced capital gains tax relief We've fixed the unfair dismissal law. We've<br />
faed industrial relations. All of these things will produce a more benign climate over<br />
time for small business and people must understand that it does take some time but<br />
when these measures fully bite, they will have a beneficial effect on employment.<br />
JRNLST: How will we fix the estimation errors? 380/ 1/ 97 11: 47 Pg: </p>
<p>Fax from 308/ 1/ 97 11: 47 Pg: 11<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You can never be certain that an estimate proves to be exactly right. You will get every<br />
single budget, no budget has ever come in completely on target, ever, in the history of<br />
Australia, ever completely on target. You can never be certain. people are only human<br />
and they make the estimates on the best information available and ifts happened with<br />
former governments, it's happening with this Government and it will happen with future<br />
governments, and there's no good my pretending, or anybody pretending that you can't<br />
avoid these things but it's $ 1.6 billion out of about $ 130 $ 140 billion of revenue.<br />
JRNLST:<br />
I believe that Cabinet discussed the High Court's Wik decision yesterday. Was there<br />
any developments in that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't discuss the contents of Cabinet discussions. Thank you.<br />
