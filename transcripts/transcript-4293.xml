FOR PRESS 17 DECEMBER 1976<br />
PUBLIC SERVICE TRANSFERS TO CANBERRA<br />
The Commonwealth Government has approved the transfer to<br />
Canberra of some 440 Public Service and Defence Service'<br />
positions in 1977 and 1978. The transfers will continue the<br />
consolidation in Canberra of the policy advising elements Of<br />
Commonwealth Government departments currently located i~ n<br />
Melbourne. A small number of other positions will be transferred<br />
from Sydney and Adelaide in the interests of increased<br />
administrative efficiency. Apart from an overall increase in<br />
the efficiency of government administration the transfers<br />
will also lead to reduced government expenditure on travel and<br />
communication costs in the longer term.<br />
The transfers of staff to Canberra will help ease growth pressures<br />
in the capital cities, especially in the central business<br />
district of Melbourne, and at the same time provide a stimulus<br />
to the construction and service industries in Canberra..<br />
The transfers underline the strength of the Cominonweal-ih Governmentt:<br />
commitment to Canberra as the Seat of Government.<br />
In accordance with the commitment previously given to staff<br />
organisations, the Public Servants affected will receive at least<br />
12 months notice of transfer.<br />

in Melbourne<br />
