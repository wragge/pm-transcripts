CHRI2TC.. URCH, NEW Z'ALATD<br />
4TH FEBRUARY, 1967<br />
Text of Speech by Mr. Holt<br />
Mr. Smith Prime Minister, Your Excellencies, Mr.<br />
Mayor, Distinguishes Juests, Ladies and Jentlemen:<br />
I hope thit Mr. Smith will not get too far away from<br />
me because I may need an interpreter from what he has been<br />
telling me. However I found at Riccarton this afternoon that<br />
they understood the language of my money and I have since<br />
suspected that this was a conspiracy coo ed up by Keith Holyoake<br />
who had been presented to me as a keen judge of equine form, witfi<br />
the Canterbury Jockey Club in order to redress to some modest<br />
degree at any rate, the gap in your balance of payments. I can<br />
assure you that since I arrived in this country the economic position<br />
of Few Lealand has improved appreciably: in fact, I have a little<br />
problem to sort out o settlement of an obligation to the Chairman<br />
of the Club ard my own High Commissioner as resources dwindled as<br />
the afternoon went on. Bit this very happy * athering is<br />
redressing the balance of the day for me. I began most<br />
auspiciously in that, havin h'id the sort of weaher that one<br />
expects in ! ellington, I cuame hopefully to the South. I was not<br />
aware, frankly, Lr. Sith, thAt as makin a little history in<br />
doing so, and in coming with my charmin wife, my decorative wife,<br />
who as you see is my own secret weapon as I was hus able to<br />
describe 1Madam Ky, out it is very grtifying to le-trn that I am<br />
the first Australian Prime Minister to have visited the South.<br />
Right Hon. Keith Holyoake ( inaudible).<br />
Right Hon. Harold Holt Well, I was coming to that. You see,<br />
we have in Can. erra a distinui shed representative of your<br />
country. . e also h' ve a distinguished representative of the<br />
United States. You Iknow your own representative very well<br />
Luke Hazlett. The American, Ed Clrk, may not os so well mknown<br />
to you, but Ed comes from Texas, and ie ha-ive always argued that<br />
Ed was a Texan first an American second and an AustrAlian third.<br />
Now Luke, I think, is a mainlander of tAe South first, a New<br />
Zealander second, and an Australian third. If Keith Holyoake will<br />
only leave him with us a little longer I might be aule to r. iove him<br />
up in the placinks. It is for us a deliyhtful prospect to have this time<br />
with you. It is a very long ime ago although in retrospect it<br />
does not seem so long this is one ot the oenalties of the aging<br />
process, tht the years seem to gallop as you get older but it<br />
is 16 years since I w. ts first in your country, and havin. r carried<br />
out the duties for which I was sent here by my JovernmenY as the<br />
Head of the Australian Delegation to the Commonwealth Parliamentary<br />
Conference, I was given the opportunity by your Government to see<br />
something of the economy and the beauties othe Forth of New<br />
6ealand: and so, when the arrangements were . eing made for this<br />
visit I said " Now, I have read a lot and heard a lot about te'.<br />
spleniid grandeur and beauty of the South of Few Z ealand.<br />
ellington is a ' must' thit's where we conduct the official<br />
business but I must see something of the South", and so here we<br />
are, and the larger part of our journeyings through New Zealand / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
will be carried out in this very beautiful southern part of your<br />
country. Je are. looking forward to that very much and delighted<br />
to find that -the weather is being kind to us.<br />
Now, Lir. Smith one of the agreeable surprises of the<br />
day and I have referred already to some of the disagreeable<br />
surprises: I don't suppose there's a Form Juide attached to the<br />
back of the document you have presented to me and as for the other<br />
gift which I certainly appreciate and regard is an honour and a<br />
compliment: I don't quite know what the perquisites are attached<br />
to it, but my wife, eing a realist as women generally are and<br />
naturally cautious as most women proved to be, said Does this<br />
mean that we have to get married again?" I would like elaboration<br />
on that point from you before this function concludes. But this<br />
gathering was, as I say, a very agreeaole surprise. W'; hen I found<br />
had oeen invited to come alorn and talk to the Chamber of<br />
Commerce, or meet the Chamber of Commerce, I had a picture in my<br />
mind of a sort of 3oard Room and a table in which a lot of rather<br />
stuffy characters including myself sat round together and<br />
discussed the state of the world and the Nation, and there it was<br />
with suitable lubrication, of course, as befits these occasions,<br />
but I found that I came into what apeared, on the surface anyhow,<br />
to ue a very convivial gathering, and if I can only stop myself<br />
in time we will all be aule to oe convivial a'ain together. That<br />
is not easy, as some of my colleagues will tell you. Jut in my<br />
own country we have, I think, worked out a very satisfactory<br />
relationship with Organisations such as your own. As a Jovernment<br />
and it is part of our philosophy of Jovernment we believe that<br />
the good of the Nation will be cest advanced if there is teamwork<br />
between those who have the responsibility of Government and those<br />
who conduct the Organisations representative of great sections of<br />
Industry whether it is manufacturers<br />
Right Hon. Keith Holyoake ( inaudible).<br />
Right Hon. Harold Holt IKeoiwt, h , you hve enjoyed not only<br />
a very handsome election win, but I Inow how well you are regarded<br />
by Industry and Commerce in your own country. Jut in mind, we<br />
have worked this out iappily together. It was not al. vays a happy<br />
situation, out the machinery we have evolved developed out of some<br />
of the economic problems we had early in the 1960' s, and we felt<br />
that in order to ensure that the " overnment was acting in the<br />
knowledge of the views held by Industry, we do arrange to meet<br />
representative 
before the first Session of the Parliament, and before the dudet<br />
Session of the Parliament, and Chambers of ! Manufacturers, Chamuers<br />
of Commerce, representatives of the Banks, of the primary producer<br />
organisations, come along and get into discussion with us. '. e<br />
invite the trade unions, too and they have preferred to meet us<br />
separately rather than with the others, ' rd at least on those two<br />
periods in the year we are told quite frankly and in the presence<br />
of each other and this Keith, I assure you has proved an advantage,<br />
because we had found that there w-is a disposition for the<br />
manufacturer to put his story quite vehemently to us and the<br />
representative of the primary industries to put his story quite<br />
vehemently to us, separately, not in the presence of each oth r, but<br />
it is amazing how the process of sitting around together and knowing<br />
that there was a critical voice ready to pick up aything that might<br />
seem an exaggerated view or an unreasonably presented view of<br />
economic circumstances or of tariff policies, and matters of that<br />
sort, has produced a much more useful concensus of thought inside<br />
the representative organisations, and I have been told hat by some<br />
of their spokesmen that this was the greatest value, really, that<br />
they have got out of these gatherings that they have heard the<br />
other fellow's point of view and they have been aole to take that<br />
into account in their own planning. So I just say in passing that<br />
we value the Organisations representative of Industry, of Commerce,<br />
of Primary Production, of our financial institutions, and we confer<br />
regularly with them, and I am sure that out of this teamwork of a<br />
relative v informal kind we have had more realistic and more<br />
effective national policies. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
But I wasn't here today just to speak on those matters.<br />
That strikes one again most forcibly coming to this country is<br />
that however much we may speak of how like each other we are<br />
how many things we have in common, our joint membership of that<br />
great Ahzac tradition which has meant so much to the people of<br />
ooth countries with Anzac Day the most solemn day of commemoration<br />
in the national calendar it is only when you get amongst the<br />
people of the other country that it comes home t you with full<br />
impact just how alike you are in your thinking perhans not<br />
entirely in your speech, althoughwe do not detect these things<br />
this may oe more apnarent to you but really an Australian coming to<br />
New iealand, or a Iew Zealander coming to Australia, finds himself at<br />
home. I have been struck even in this gathering here this evening<br />
with the number of people who have come from Australia, and I have in<br />
Australia many friends who have come to settle and to work with us<br />
in our country. Some of our most distinguished men Sir Frederick<br />
;. hite, Sir Douglas Copland, and there are scores of them that if<br />
time permitted one could mention. And it is only when this impact<br />
hits you tl; ai: you start thinking it out. You know, we are closer<br />
in Canberra to you than we are to our own people in Perth and the<br />
people of Perth, although they are with us on the mainland, there<br />
is a great area of desert in patches oetween us nd them: between<br />
us and you there is a great area of sea, uut we are closer physically<br />
in point of time, in point of journeying. And now that I have<br />
discovered this, as I should have discovered it lone ago, I am going<br />
to see to it that my own visits and those of my M inisters are more<br />
frequent. I hope those of your Frime Minister and of his colleagues<br />
will be more frequent. As I said at our luncheon yesterday, to give<br />
some evidence of our desire to brin. our relations closer and to<br />
work more closely together on matters of mutual concern, ' we do<br />
provide that any of our Parliamentari. ns are free to go and visit<br />
few Zealand at our Jovernment's expense, because w'e believe that this<br />
is of value to us, and we hope that it will be of value to you.<br />
Now r. Smith, you spoke of the opportunities the challenges,<br />
that we have to ether in relation to the regions to the north of our<br />
countries. I suppose in my own there are some parts of Australia,<br />
perhaps many Australians, who are more acutely conscious of this<br />
by the mere circumstance of geography: we are right close within<br />
lying distance, minutes almost, o a people 100,000,000 strong<br />
in Indonesia restless, with a revolutionary philosophy, but with<br />
great resources which in time we hope will be effectively develoned.<br />
I can illustrate for you the feeling of some of our people when I<br />
say that it is literally closer from Darw. in to Saigon than it is, say,<br />
from Brisuane to Perth, and we are vry conscious, and become<br />
increasingly so as events move more dynamically in those parts of<br />
the world, of our involvement geogrphically economically, from<br />
the security point of view and in a variety of other ways, and I<br />
know that your Prime Linister is very conscious of this. Je were<br />
together at Manilh. . e subscribed together to the Declaration and<br />
the joals of Freedom in M. arnila, and we believe that our two countries<br />
have the opportunity oy virtue of our economic capacities, by the<br />
standards we have been aule to build in our two countries, by the<br />
warmth of friendship which exists, radiating out to us from them to<br />
exercise an influence, to be of some help, and, small though we<br />
are to have a significant place in the scheme of things not onl<br />
in this area, but towards the peace and proress of the -world. And<br />
because we have the stimulation : and inspiraion of those goals,<br />
there is a warmth and strength in our partnership which derives not<br />
merely from our close kinship, uut a feeling that we have a destiny<br />
to share together in the years which lie ahead. I hope that my own<br />
visit here will help to promote those oo, ctives and will be tangiole<br />
evidence that there is a warmth of friendship and of good will in my<br />
own country for yours, that there is a resolve that our two countries<br />
shall work together in harmony and close co-operation for the<br />
objectives that we have in common.<br />
Thank you very much from M'rs. Holt and myself for this very<br />
warm and friendly welcome you have given us here in Christchurch<br />
this evening. </p>
