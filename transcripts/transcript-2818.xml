SPEECH DELIVERED BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM,<br />
At a Dinner attended by the Government of Papua New Guinea.<br />
PORT MORESBY 18 February 1973<br />
Mr Chief Minister, I suppose one would be less<br />
than human if one did not feel some measure of gratification<br />
at the recent changes in our personal and political situations:<br />
all I need say, Chief Minister, is that we have both come a<br />
long way from the lounge of the Sepik Hotel at Wewak in<br />
January 1970, when we were both virtually under seige and<br />
when we were both deemed in certain quarters to be committing<br />
political suicide by daring to talk about early independence<br />
for Papua New Guinea.<br />
I may say, Chief Minister, thatthe courage and<br />
foresight you showed in those years marked you as a coming<br />
man and as a genuine leader of your people. It is a deep<br />
personal pleasure to me as well as a matter of great pride<br />
that you and I shall be working together in the coming years<br />
in the great work of creating a new nation in the South<br />
Pacific, this nation of Papua New Guinea.<br />
In the whole of modern history there is only a<br />
select band of men and women to whom such a task has been<br />
entrusted, and you Chief Minister, have joined with lustre<br />
and honour the chosen few who have led their people to<br />
nationhood. In the few short years since 1970 when even<br />
self-govenrment, much less independence, was scarcely to be<br />
mentioned in polite circles, Papua New Guinea had a piece of<br />
unexpected good fortune. I refer to the appointment of Andrew<br />
Peacock as the Australian Minister for External Territories.<br />
I am glad, here, to pay my public tribute tL-o him and his work,<br />
as I have in Australia. I have been lable to appoint an<br />
admirable successor in Bill Morrison who, one way and another,<br />
has had a remarkeable record in working himself out of a job<br />
and that, of course, is the duty of the Minister for External<br />
Territories. I was never a believer in the idea that the<br />
Australian political parties should adopt thfroughout the early<br />
a bipartisan approach on the future of Papua New Guinea.<br />
I am convinced that the attempt to do so did great harm in<br />
those years. Too often, Australian apathy, Australian arrogance,<br />
Australian indifference masqueraded as a national consensus.<br />
Nevertheless, what was a disadvantage in the ' 60' s could well<br />
be an advantage in the mid ' 70' s as Papua New Guinea emerges<br />
towards independence. Andrew Peacock did go a long way towards<br />
restoring the consensus a genuine, progressive, concerned<br />
consensus, not the phoney consensus of the<br />
There are now three great areas of agreement among<br />
the Australian political parties about Papua New Guinea's future.<br />
The first is that a timetable for self-government and independence<br />
must be set, and that essential elements for the timing of the<br />
decision are the views and wishes of the House of Assembly. / 2 </p>
<p>As the Chief Minister and Mr Peacock agreed,<br />
resolutions of the House on important issues should be by<br />
recorded vote and by a substantial majority representative<br />
of the nation as a whole. My Government reaffirms that<br />
position. I cannot stress too often that the decision for<br />
independence is not only a decision about Papua New Guinea.<br />
It is about Australia and Australia's view of her own proper<br />
role in the world. Australia is no longer willing to be the<br />
ruler of a colony. And my Government is determined to divest<br />
itself of that role in the lifetime of the present Australian<br />
Parliament. The second area of firm agreement is that<br />
Australia's aid to Papua New Guinea will continue after<br />
independence. You will recall, Chief Minister, that in<br />
my visits in 1970 and 1971,1 made the most solemn pledges<br />
to your people on this matter. The pledges that I made to<br />
your people ae as binding upon me, my Party and my Government<br />
as any undertaking I have given to my own people in seeking<br />
their support. I am acutely aware of the fact that if I had<br />
not given these undertakings in 1970 and in 1971, the cause<br />
of independence could never have made its spectacular progress<br />
in the past three years. I repeat thzt-undertaking now.<br />
The Australian Government has decided to give the<br />
Papua New Guinea Government an assurance of continuing aid over<br />
the period of the three year Improvement Program beginning in<br />
1974/ 75. The detailed arrangements to give effect to this<br />
assurance will be formulated in connection with the preparation<br />
of the Improvement Program. These arrangements will, of course,<br />
need to provide for review during the period of the Program as<br />
necessary in the light of changing circumstances.<br />
Papua New Guinea will have the first call on our<br />
substantially increased foreign aid programme. We shall be<br />
working with the Papua New Guinea Government through a specific<br />
and guaranteed ' programme.<br />
The third area of complete agreement between the<br />
Australian political parties is that it is Australia's duty<br />
and responsibility to hand over to the Central Government and<br />
the House of Assembly a united Papua New Guinea.<br />
My Government's policy, and it was the policy of<br />
the late Government, is to hand over our remaining powers to<br />
a national and representative government, freely elected by<br />
the people of the whole of Papua New Guinea and able to<br />
represent the wishes of the majority of the people. Relations<br />
between our two countries will be conducted through the National<br />
Government in Canberra and the Central Government of Papua New<br />
Guinea. Australian aid will be allocated solely through the<br />
Central Government. / 3 </p>
<p>On 20 December 1971 the United Nations General<br />
Assembly, by resolution, urged Australia to discourage separatist<br />
movements and to ensure that the unity of Papua New Guinea is<br />
preserved throughout tne period leading up to independence.<br />
On 14 December last year the General Assembly again reaffirmed<br />
" the importance of ensuring the preservation of unity."<br />
I know we cannot underestimate the difficulties in<br />
maintaining unity. I know the strength of tribal and regional<br />
feelings. These ties and loyalties are themselves valuable<br />
an essential ingredient in the life and culture of the nation.<br />
But if Papua New Guinea is to survive, if it is to progress, if<br />
it is to find an honourable and honoured place among the nations<br />
of the world, if it is to have an effective voice in the affairs<br />
of our region, then the Central 6overnment and the House of<br />
Assembly must have sufficient powers over the whole nation to plan<br />
for the nation and to speak for the nation.<br />
I hope you won't think it patronising of me to<br />
remind you that Australia herself a federation of states<br />
has problems in dealing with national matters. For example,<br />
you will know the difficulties and delays we have met in<br />
carrying out our determination to negotiate between our two<br />
countries in the Torres Strait. Even in a country as developed<br />
and sophisticated as Australia, one hears from time to time<br />
rumbings and mumblings about secession. But it is folly for<br />
anybody to believe that any section of Papua New Guinea would<br />
serve its interests by going it alone. For it would truly mean<br />
going it alone. Soon I shall be leaving for a visit to our great<br />
neighbour, Indonesia. It's worthwhile reflecting that that<br />
country has faced similar problems of diversity of cultures<br />
and customs and suspicion from time to time of the Central<br />
Governm1~ ent. But Indonesia is an example of one of the<br />
outstanding facts of the post-colonial era. Newly independent<br />
countries in Asia and Africa have made extraordinary exertions<br />
to maintain the integrity of the borders inherited from their<br />
colonial rulers. For such countries those borders are regarded<br />
as the very foundation of the legitimacy of their government,<br />
as the very guarantee and symbol of their independence, and of<br />
their nationhood. It must be so with Papua New Guinea.<br />
The members of this Government and the members of<br />
the House of Assembly have, as I have said, a tremendous and<br />
difficult task ahead. But it is a task of great honour and<br />
privilege to be in truth the founding fathers of your nation.<br />
You are writing a great page in your nation's<br />
history. In Australia you have an assured friend and I believe<br />
we shall forge a true partnership to the great advantage of<br />
both our countries and for the welfare of both our peoples. </p>
