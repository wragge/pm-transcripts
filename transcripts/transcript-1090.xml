LUNCHTIME RALL1, LIBERAL r'A1LTY OF N. S. W.<br />
SYDN'EY TO' 4N HALL. SYDNEY APRIL, 196 j<br />
Speech by the-Prime-Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Askin, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
I am delighted to find Mr. Askin in such robust form.<br />
I said to him outside before we came in that I didn't have any<br />
reason to believe that he would be defeated by his enemies.<br />
What sometimes happens in our party is that one is defeated by<br />
one's friends. Half-hearted people.<br />
The first thing I want to do is to urge all of you to<br />
be whole-htearted. That will be the way to achieve victory.<br />
( Hear, hear) ( Applause)<br />
My mind goes back, of course, a good way in the history<br />
of the Liberal Party because I had the great honour of beginning<br />
it as Leader of the Opposition in 19' 44, and at that time I had<br />
some hopes, of course, that with hard work, co-ordination of our<br />
ideas, a revision of our policy, the accumulation of fresh ideas<br />
and fresh drive we might win in due course. Well, we werent<br />
successful in 1 I don't think that anybody imagined that<br />
starting from as far back as we were we were going to win in 194+ 6.<br />
We won a seat or two, And immediately ( do you remember? some of<br />
the older of you may) the cry arose, a muted cry, the sort of cry<br />
you hear in the corner of a club room " You will never win with<br />
Menzies" ( Iaugnter) This became qui~ e a slogan, very encouraging<br />
to me as Leader of the Opposition. ( Laughter)<br />
In a reverse kind of way it did encourage me because<br />
it annoyed me so much that I didn't let up for years thereafter.<br />
And although " you couldn't win with Menzies" I suppose there are<br />
some people who have said, " You can't win wih Askin". But we<br />
did win and we have won seven consecutive elections since that<br />
time. pplause) And this to a major extent due to the fact that<br />
we have had inside our party the most fabulous loyalty-a loyalty<br />
that has encouraged us, that has enabled us to ride oui periods<br />
of unpopularity4 We've gone through thesb periods and we: have<br />
gone through them successfully because we have had 1he complete<br />
fidelity of our own people.<br />
Now I think, Sir, that this period, the last twelve or<br />
fifteen years in Australia is the most exciting period in our<br />
history in the most exciting country in the world. ( Applause)<br />
Let me repeat that to you: The most exciting country in the<br />
world. It is part of my task in Canberra and in other parts of<br />
the world to encounter people of significance and influence in<br />
other countries and inevitably they will be heard saying tome,<br />
tYou know, Australia is a tremendously exciting country. We,<br />
ourselves, are taking an interest in it, We ( if they are in'the<br />
financial world) are encouraging our people to invest in Australia"<br />
because there is no country in the world that offers such an<br />
exciting prospect of growth as " Vhis country of ours,<br />
Now let us be proud of that because it is true.<br />
Anybody who moves around Australia wouldn't need to have any<br />
evidence of the facts that I have mentioned. Mr. Askin has just<br />
mentioned the population. It is very interesting to recall that i<br />
since 194Ã± 9 I will just take one example the number of dwelling<br />
units in Australia has gone up from 1,970,000 to 3,262,000.<br />
Indeed it would be fair to say that most of the houses in Australia / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
today have been built in our time. This is a tremendously<br />
interesting factor and, of course, on all the material sides<br />
black coal, ingot stee, all the area under crop in the country,<br />
the increase in the sheep population all these things have been<br />
going on, with their little variations, of course, from time to<br />
time because life is like that, but in the end result they adAi up<br />
to the most remarkable period of development that you or I have<br />
ever seen anywhere. Now this is a matter that only needs totbe<br />
mentioned, I donst need to elaborate it to you, but I just want<br />
to add one observation if I may.<br />
All this, and many other things that I don't need to<br />
quote to you, have been going on during the period of office of<br />
a Federal Liberal and Country Party administration at Canberra.<br />
( Applause) Now, I am perfectly certain that when this statement<br />
comes to be analysed, I will be told by our political opponents,<br />
" Well but do you claim the credit for it? Do you think you did<br />
it?" 1 And of course the answer is that I don't think I did it, but<br />
I do think that the economic and financial policies of my govern.<br />
ment have created a climate in which this could happen and did<br />
ha ppen.<br />
0 This is tlhe fact of the matter and in case somebody says<br />
that is a little boastful, I want to remind you that at the last<br />
State election in New South Wales, the then State Premier stated<br />
categorically that the Commonwealth Government has had the main<br />
responsibility for economic conditions. ( Laughter) Now he can't<br />
have it both ways, or he couldn't have had the matter both ways.<br />
If we have had, and he is quite right, the main responsibility<br />
for economic conditions, then I think that our policies may be<br />
taken to have contributed in a material way to the results that<br />
I have been referring to.<br />
Of course I know why the Premier said it, After many,<br />
many years, I have a rough working knowledge of Premiers, I see<br />
them with some regularity and I know they are never, professionally<br />
quite satisfied. That's all right. But in thte last<br />
election here we were unpopular. We had almost lost the 1961<br />
" eWleelclt, i ont hearned yZohue reafreo. r e Tihte waCsonm'mto nwae ablatd h iGdoeav, e rnhme entth, o ugthhits, to say,<br />
government that has practically lost your confidence, it has had<br />
the responsibility and look what a mess it has made of it."<br />
This was the whole sermon on that occasion. All right, I accept<br />
it. Let Mr. Renshaw repeat that the Commonwealth Government has<br />
the main responsibility for economic conditions and then Mr,<br />
Askin and all of you will be able to point out that if that is<br />
so then this responsibility has been discharged magnificently for<br />
a long, long time. ( Applause)<br />
ourselves NwowV ~ Mtrh. e reC hahaisr mabne, e n Is utchhi nka idte griese woorft hawchhiileev emaesnkti ngin<br />
Australia, a degree of political success in Australia, and so<br />
high a degree in the National Parliament of continuity of office<br />
for our side, It might be worthwhile asking ourselves why.<br />
Well, of course, from our point of view we have based ourselves<br />
on the encouragement of private initiative and enterprise.<br />
We have put into operation the most novel and effective series<br />
of social service provisions that this country has ever had since<br />
the old-age pension was first invented at the beginning of the<br />
century and, of course we have set out, above all things and<br />
particularly of late io help to create an educated democracy.<br />
Now these have been Zhe driving elements in what we have been<br />
doing. But Labor, what has Labor been doing? What is the cause<br />
of this failure by Labor? And I say Labor because Labor is the<br />
one thing all Over Australia. I know the Labor Government here ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
is occasionally casting itself for the role of a Right Wing Party<br />
while its principal Federal representative from this State publicly<br />
announces his'steady translation to a position near the Left Wing<br />
if not actually on its tip, so there is a little bit of jiggerypokery<br />
going on here, But we know, don't we, that the Labor<br />
Party is the same all over Australia. It has to be because when<br />
it s outside rulers meet, they lay down rules of policy and of<br />
actlon which are just as binding on the New South Wales Labor<br />
Goverr~ ment as they are on any private member of the Labor Party<br />
in the Federal Parliament. This is under their establishment.<br />
And the result is that one is entitled to treat the Labor Party as<br />
being the one thing all over Australia in Federal, in State, in<br />
whatever it may be.<br />
Now, Sir, everybody knows that the Labor Party has fallen<br />
increasingly into the clutches of the extremists. You don't need<br />
to know very much about the inside of politics to know how true<br />
that is. Union after union has been infiltrated by communists<br />
and communists have been coming into office promoting discord and<br />
trouble. The Left Wing a term to which I see somebody objectsbut<br />
the Left Wing at Canberra develops more and more its position<br />
as the spokesman of Labor on foreign affairs. We hear them time<br />
after time after time and we hear what they have to say about the<br />
United States of America and American policy, because the Left<br />
Wing of the Labor Party hates America and hates everything that<br />
the Amtericans do, When I came in here this morning, there were<br />
a lot of earnest workers holding up placards. This, of course,<br />
is very largely an attack on the United States. I know it is<br />
supposed to be an attack on my Government, but everything the<br />
United States does on behalf of the free world is condemned by<br />
the Left Wing of the Labor Party and you are much better informed<br />
than I am if you know or can guarantee that the Left Wing of the<br />
Labor Party won't be in complete charge of it inside the next<br />
few years. The second thing about Labor is that it has lost the<br />
capacity for evolving new ideas because, of course, it has to<br />
rely on others to produce them and to tell them what they are to<br />
do. Mr. Askin made a remark about-this which struck me as<br />
profoundly true. They are not producing new ideas. When did they<br />
last produce? Ever since they set themselves up as the Socialist<br />
Party, the socialisation of the means of production, distribution<br />
and exchange etc., have they ever produced anything new? The<br />
truth is that they are the reactionaries in politics in this<br />
country. They are living on the past, they are living on a little<br />
stock of ideas that was established thirty years agro and which<br />
they have been turning over ever since until it has got<br />
frightfully shop-soiled.<br />
We have been the party that has produced the new ideas,<br />
You consider what has been going on in the field of export<br />
development in the field of rural industry, in the field of<br />
education, In the field of national development, in the field of<br />
international relationships, and international movements of<br />
money and balances of payments. We have been the initiators.<br />
I can't recall a solitary initiation on the part of my opponents<br />
for many years.<br />
Now, a party that has lost the capacity for evolving new<br />
ideas ought really to have a look at itself. We did fifteen<br />
years ago. We came to the conclusion that we would have to run<br />
through our stock of ideas and add to them and produce a platform<br />
and a policy that would look forward and would have appeal to the<br />
people of Austral a and in particular that would have appeal to<br />
00 0 0 </p>
<p>the younger people of Australia to whom the future belongs.<br />
( Applause) I was involving the Labour Party in a severe criticism<br />
and saying that they were reactionary and out of date, and of<br />
course they are, as out of date as socialism and that is about<br />
as reactionary and out of date as any doctrine you have ever<br />
heard of, but they still believe in it, they still hang on to it,<br />
they still thinkc that this has some appeal to young Australian<br />
men and women whom they underestimate shockingly. They seem to<br />
treat the young people in Australia as if all they wanted to do<br />
was to manage to live long enough to be paid something by the<br />
government ( Laughter) ( Applause) and they are not like that, I<br />
assure you. All the young Australian men and women whom I know are<br />
keen, intelligent anxious to stand on their own feet and anxious<br />
to carve out a future and you have a few million people in a<br />
country like ours anxious to carve out a future, anxious to get<br />
on with the job, anxious to engage in some adventure and I will<br />
guarantee the development of the country without a moment's<br />
hesitation. It is individuals, millions of them, encouraged<br />
to develop their talents, encouraged to engage in enterprise for<br />
risk and for reward have enough of them and you will have a<br />
country that is growing and growing until I am able to say with<br />
complete truth that it is the most exciting country in the world.<br />
You know " Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive<br />
But to be young was very heaven" ( Applause)<br />
Those are fine words and worth recalling.<br />
There is another aspect of this. I don't propose to<br />
go through all the details, of course, because that would take<br />
much too long, but I do want to say something to you about our<br />
revolutionary approach to the problem of education. People very<br />
soon forget the Commonwealth didn't have any direct responsibilities<br />
in relation, for example, to university education. It was<br />
my own Government that made the first little tentative grant to<br />
the universities. It was my own Government that established the<br />
Murray Committee whose report was the beginning of a revolution<br />
in the university world and we adopted every last recommendation<br />
in that report, and then we established a Universities Commission.<br />
We established a body to report on tertiary education. We had<br />
a.. special committee on teaching hospitals.<br />
We have covered an enormous amount of ground in the<br />
tertiary field and the result is that whereas fifteen years ago<br />
the Budget item would be about Å 114, in the triennium that is<br />
beginning now it will be more like Å 30M, and you, of course,<br />
pay it, but ii has been under our policies that these things<br />
have occurred. Go around the universities, go and see the<br />
buildings going up, see the rapidly increasing number of prospective<br />
undergraduates who can get in and get a university training<br />
and give themselves a new chance in life. Have a look at these<br />
universities, old and new, and you will find them seething with<br />
activity, growing almost daily under your eyes. ( Applause)<br />
And why? I venture to say with complete confidence<br />
because of the revolutionary approach mal. e to these<br />
matters by my own Government, a Liberal administration, Liberal<br />
thought. This has been the beginning of a new era in tertiary<br />
education in Australia, and it was initiated by us. Now remember<br />
that and remember, as I do myself, with some pride, a go ~ 0 </p>
<p>Well then, our last initiation on this matter was in<br />
respect of secondary schools and technical schools. it is<br />
already rapidly being forgotten that as a result of the policy I<br />
put before the people at the last election of which they warmly<br />
approved, the money that we spoke of, a year for technical<br />
schools, has already been taken up and will continue to be provided<br />
for years into the future. This has put the States into a po * sition<br />
ofI I think a very proper advantage in that they are able to do<br />
more in building and equipment in technical schools to meet the<br />
growing demand for technical training and knowledge in Australia.<br />
Then we made our famous, and I believe contentious,<br />
provision providing for science blocks and science equipment in<br />
secondary schools ( Applause) meaning by that secondary schools of<br />
all types, State, independent, most of the independent being church<br />
schools. ( InterJector " Shamel") Shame? It would have been a<br />
shame to refuse them. What sort of a shame would it have been if<br />
the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, having decided to<br />
help with science training in secondary schools, said, " Only State<br />
secondary schools are to get this money. Those of you who have<br />
had the enterprise or the particular desires to have your children<br />
in other types of secondary school, you get nothing, although we<br />
are the trustees for all the taxpayers in Australia." That would<br />
have been a shame. ( Applause)<br />
This is an item it is not a big item intrinsically<br />
but has opened many doors and I am delighted with it because<br />
think that it is helping io open up a new frontier in Australia,<br />
You know, we can go along in the orthodox fashion and treat<br />
education as following what I will call the orthodox routine lines,<br />
the kind of thing that many of us have been through but what is<br />
needed today in this age, in this young country, wizh so much<br />
resource to be developed, so many challenging things to be coped<br />
wh, what is needed is a higher degree, among other things, of<br />
technical, scientific, technological training than we have ever<br />
had before. This is elementary.<br />
This is a technical age. The development in the<br />
twentieth century has been, of course, ph~ enomenal, and here we are<br />
in Australia, made up of a people of high average intelligence and<br />
capacity for acquiring knowledge, with a very advanced standard of<br />
living, with great advantages, and we have around us in the world<br />
countries which are for various historical reasons and others,<br />
backward countries who need help, whose population is pressing all<br />
the time on their resources who are confronted every now and then<br />
by the literal problem of siarvation, and they must be enabled,<br />
they must be helped to develop along scientific lines their own<br />
capacity to produce things for themselves. It is quite wrong to<br />
4suppose they ought to be put in a position of living on somebody<br />
else's kindness forever, They have to be encouraged to produce<br />
things of their own in the problems of agriculture in the<br />
problems of depasturing stock in the problems of factories, and<br />
therefore we, as a donor country, under the Colombo Plan, have<br />
ourselves an obligation to develop to the utmost our own capacity<br />
for producing scientific and technological skill. ( Applause)<br />
I went out, Sir, to Bathurst the other day to open a<br />
science block at a sxhool, a school which had had a science master<br />
many many years ago who was a pioneer in applied science, He<br />
must have been a very very remarkable man. Sent the first wireless<br />
messages across land from the school, did a great deal of<br />
scientific work in X-Ray, with the most primitive appliances,<br />
and today there is a magnificent science block thanks to this<br />
policy, this revolutionary policy, with fine equipment so that<br />
9 o* e/ 6 </p>
<p>6-<br />
on the basis of a wonderful tradition which these boys have<br />
inherited, they will be able to equip themselves to be pioneers<br />
of a new growth of knowledge. Very appropriate to say that in<br />
Bathurst? 2 because Bathurst after all was the new frontier itself,<br />
geographically that was opened up by Blaxland and Wentworth and<br />
the great explorers. This opened up a new physical conception<br />
of Australia. It converted Australia almost in a stroke from<br />
being just a limited penal settlement perched on the coast to<br />
being the country that it has now become. And I said to these<br />
boys, just as these great men had sought out new frontiers and<br />
had discovered them, so they, themselves, would be the pioneers.<br />
This is so much the kind of thing that we Liberals<br />
ought to belieie in most passionately, that pioneering is not<br />
dead that pioneering has to be encouraged, that all pioneers<br />
don't need to be looking around with big beards on and wearing<br />
bowyangs. This is an antiquated idea. We can all be pioneers<br />
and the more talented we are, the more we can pioneer great<br />
movements, great things, great bodies of knowledge, a capacity<br />
to accept growing responsibility and therefore I point out to<br />
you that this being our spirit, this being our approach the<br />
Labor Party is beginning to discover, I think rather Mae that<br />
their chronic talk about a depression or about referring to the<br />
people as the proletariat I haven't yet met a chap down the<br />
street who liked being called one of the proletariat but dont<br />
let on to the Labor Party, I hope they will still continue to<br />
use this rather fabulous expression.<br />
Now, ladies and gentlemen, as time marches on, I just<br />
want to turn quite hastily to the great problem of defence and<br />
foreign policy because Mr. Askin had some sersi. ble things to say<br />
about it. True, we the Commonwealth, have the primary responsibility<br />
in a sense you might say the total responsibility for<br />
conducting affairs relating to defence and foreign policy, but<br />
whether we do it well or badly will determine the future security<br />
and well-being of all voters in all elections for all Houses of<br />
Parliament. This is one of those problems on which an unhealthy<br />
attitude in a State Government could easily bring about difficulties<br />
in the carrying out of a Federal policy.<br />
If there is one thing on whicha we all ought to be<br />
able to stand clear and together, it is the defence and security<br />
of the country which in turn involves the foreign policy of the<br />
country, how we deal with other nations. Now on this, of course,<br />
as you know, Labor is hopelessly divided. Half the speeches made<br />
on the other side of the House are busy explaining how wickedly<br />
wrong the Americans are. The other half adopt the view which<br />
is much more like our own and that is that if we are to view<br />
our security in the broad, we might as well not on~ ly pay attention<br />
to what we evolve inside our own country but to our relationships<br />
with those countries upon whose help, mark you, in a great crisis<br />
we would have to depend. ( Applause)<br />
Now, let us apply that to the present state of affairs.<br />
We have just, not long ago, initiated an expanded defence<br />
programme which far exceeds anything that anybody would have<br />
thought about a couple of years ago. It is going to involve<br />
great national and individual burdens. I think it has the warm<br />
support of the people of Australia but I am not so sure that the<br />
support will be unbroken when we finally begin to pick up the<br />
bill and see how we are going to pay for it. I don't know how<br />
yet, we haven't got to that stage. e~** e9*/ 7 </p>
<p>7<br />
But this is a colossal task, and it is a task which<br />
involves to a ansiderable extent purchasing equipment in other<br />
countries and it therefore involves to that extent drawing upon<br />
our overseas reserves and therefore it has a direct relationship<br />
to our balance of payments problem which we have from year to<br />
year. And, ladies and gentlemen, when I hear my opponents<br />
at Canberra throwing cold water on capital coming into Australia<br />
I wonder whether they have the faintest idea as to, where we woull<br />
be if we didn't have capital coming into Australia.<br />
Does anybody suppose thateleven million people,<br />
admittedly the best in the world I'm prepared to concede that<br />
point ( cheers, applause) but does anybody suppose that eleven<br />
million people with a continent the size of the United States of<br />
America and with resources, many of which as yet are quite<br />
untouched, can develop all the capital it wants for itself out<br />
of its own individual savings? Really, nobody in his five wits<br />
would pretend that for one moment, and therefore we can either<br />
slow down our progress, slow down our increasing population by<br />
cutting down on immigration or we can welcome overseas capital<br />
to enable all our resources to be put to work and our development<br />
' to continue. I don't know where the Labor Party supposes we ought<br />
to get the capital we need. ( Interjector " What about Mr,<br />
McEwen, he doesn't agree with Mr. McEwen agrees entirely<br />
with what I am saying. I stated the policy of my Government on<br />
this matter in my last policy speech and it represented the<br />
unanimous views of Mr. McEwen, Mr. Holt and myself. My view is<br />
that the Labor Party's policy would do more to damage national<br />
growth and development in Australia than any other thing that I<br />
can think of, ( Interjector :" What about the aborigines?") Isn't<br />
it wonderful? Do you know why I take such pride in the educational<br />
programme? Because I am hoping that after a generation or two<br />
it will produce people who won't have such a passion for changing<br />
the subject when they are losing an argument. ( Applause)<br />
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I mentioned something<br />
about defence, I ncw want to say a few words about foreign<br />
policy. I want to know to what extent Laibor really challenges,<br />
effectively challenges, our foreign policy, I don~ t quite<br />
understand it because the other day the Leader of the Opposition<br />
in Canberra said there was no hope of a bi-partisan policy<br />
because nobody could agree with the Government's policy and<br />
therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I am at a loss to know what<br />
Labor's policy is.<br />
All I know is that it isn't ours according to Mr.<br />
Calwell and then of course, somebody comes up and says ( to<br />
interjector) thai we didn't have one. In one of the long winter<br />
evenings, one of you young fellows must come along and have a<br />
word with me and explain the policy of the Labor Party on foreign<br />
affairs because it would have all the charms of novelty.<br />
( Laughter) Our policy is well known. We have a strong view<br />
which I think most people in Australia share that the security<br />
of South East Asia against communist attack Is of enormous<br />
importance not only to the countries affected directly but to<br />
ourselves In this part of the world. ( Applause) And therefore<br />
we bave engaged ourselves in a variety of directions.<br />
In the first place, we entered into my own<br />
Government entered into the ANZUS pact with the United States<br />
and with New Zealand and under that we have a great cloak of<br />
vesee / 8 </p>
<p>protection under certain circumstances cast over us by the<br />
United States of America. We entered into the South East<br />
Asian Treaty, a treaty in which we are partners with Pakistan,<br />
with Thailand, with the Philippines, with Great Britain, with<br />
the United Statesl with France, with New Zealand. Under this<br />
treaty, we have al undertaken to do what we can to protect<br />
certain protocol countries, as they have been called, against<br />
communist attack and one of them is South Vietnam, so there<br />
we are4 South Vietnam one of the countries in effect assured<br />
of our support under this treaty, provided she was willing or<br />
prepared to ask us to come in because that was a condition<br />
right through. Well she asked the United States of America, she<br />
asked us, We are there, in a very small way, because we have<br />
major commitments at this moment in and around Malaysia but<br />
we are -there, we are contributing. The United States Is there<br />
in a very substantial way with large forces of all arms and with<br />
supplies and all the equipment that is needed to resist the<br />
communist aggression. Now ladies and gentlemen, we are told<br />
that the United States ought not to be there. In other words,<br />
we are told that South Vietnam ought to be abandoned that the<br />
communists from the north, the Vietminh, should be allowed to<br />
come down and join up with these Vietcong pockets of communists<br />
in the south and establish South Vietnam as a communist country,<br />
a communist country ultimately dominated by the most aggressive<br />
form of communism which is Chinese comirunism today*<br />
Now, ladies and gentlemen what would happen then?<br />
See, America is out. America has listened to the words of'the<br />
boys outside and they go home. ( Interjector " Were they<br />
communists?") I daresay, I thought their labels looked like<br />
it, didn't you? ( Applause) But I wouldn't know , Ididn't<br />
recognise any of them personally. ( Laughter) But, ladies anid<br />
gentlemen, let us assume this " America Go Home. America Keep<br />
Out. America Don't Have Any More To Do With This Business."<br />
So Vietnam falls, What happens to Thailand? You have only to<br />
look at the map when you go home. What happens to Thailand with<br />
that long exposed communist frontier that would develop? What<br />
happens to Malaya? What happens to Malaysia caught between two<br />
fires? From a point of view of ordinary commonsense and of'<br />
instinct of self-preservation, I can't understand how anybody<br />
could say that the Americans ought to go out.<br />
Let me put it in another way to you. Why are the<br />
Americans there? ( Interjector " For profit") " For profit"<br />
says some goat. ( Laughter) They are making a tremendous profit<br />
out of being in South Vietnam; it is costing them thousands of<br />
millions of dollars and they get nothing back. If that is profit<br />
well you have introduced a new word to the dictionary, that jis all<br />
I can say. ( Applause) It is easily summarised, ladies and gentlemen. They<br />
are not there for money. They are spending money, vast sums.<br />
They are not there in order to avoid exposing their own people<br />
to risk because they have thousands of their own troops at risk<br />
every day. They are not there because they have enormous business<br />
interests in South Vietnam. Anybody who knows anything about<br />
the economics of that country would know how absurd this is.<br />
0000 0 0/ 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
Well why are they there? If they are not there<br />
serving any selfish American interest, and that is quite<br />
demonstrable then they must be there and I believe they<br />
are there because this is, in the finest sense of the word,<br />
an altruistic effort on behalf of free people wherever they<br />
live. ( Applause) Sir, I am delighted to know that when my friend,<br />
Mr. Askin, becomes Premier ( Applause) and his colleagues become<br />
Ministers we will enjoy the support of people who on these<br />
great matters have no ambiguities in their mind and no hesitations<br />
in their souls. So my last word to you, because my time is up,<br />
my last word to you, ladies and gentlemen is Go on in<br />
strength, go on with confidence, go on with enthusiasm and you<br />
will, beyond all question, win on May 1st. </p>
