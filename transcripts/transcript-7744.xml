    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER<br />EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />OPENING DINNER<br />GOVERNMENT-INDUSTRY CONFERENCE<br />AGAINST CHEMICAL WEAPONS<br />CANBERRA 18 SEPTEMBER 1989<br />Excellencies Distinguished guests<br />Parliamentary Colleagues<br />Ladies and Gentlemen<br />Three quarters of a century ago, the nations of the world<br />were plunged into the first truly global conflict.<br />The trauma, brutality and horror of that war are still<br />scorched into the collective memory of us all.<br />Not least among the barbarisms that man inflicted on his<br />fellow man in that first world war was the widespread use of<br />poison gas a weapon so destructive and indiscriminate in<br />its effect that those who used it could not prevent troops<br />of their own side let alone civilians being caught in<br />the poisonous clouds.<br />Australia, then a very young nation, contributed its men and<br />money unstintingly to the battles being fought, for the most<br />part, on the other side of the globe.<br />Thousands of Australian soldiers died due to the effects of<br />poison gas. Thousands more returned home with damaged lungs<br />to endure, and not to enjoy, the peace for which they had<br />fought.<br />The horrors of the chemical battlefields of World War 1 led<br />the world community to express its outright rejection of<br />chemical warfare in the 1925 Geneva protocol. That treaty<br />recently reaffirmed by 149 nations earlier this year in<br />Paris remains today the fundamental embodiment of the<br />world's norms and restraints against chemical warfare.<br />1878</p>
<p>But in recent years the world community has been appalled by<br />the fact that despite the Geneva protocol, the unthinkable<br />has again happened: large scale use of chemical weapons has<br />recurred in our own time.<br />So it is essential that we complete the work of our<br />forebears. We must ban not merely the use but also the very<br />existence of chemical weapons.<br />That, delegates and friends, is what has brought you all<br />this way to Canberra: the desire for a permanent and secure<br />remedy in the form of a chemical weapons convention.<br />This gathering is an historic one a world first.<br />It represents an effort to give new impetus in this long<br />saga. It represents a genuine endeavour to eliminate for the first<br />time on a multilateral basis an entire class of existing<br />weapons. And in recognition of the sweeping nature of that effort, it<br />is the first time that a major industrial group has been<br />called on in its entirety to participate in the disarmament<br />process. Let me take this opportunity formally to welcome the<br />representatives of the nearly 70 Governments present for<br />this conference, and to welcome with equal warmth the<br />representatives of the chemical industry, whose involvement<br />will be so vital to the proper design and implementation of<br />a completed Chemical Weapons Convention.<br />Together, the participation of governments and industry is a<br />tremendous encouragement that the work our negotiators are<br />undertaking in Geneva can and will be brought to a<br />successful resolution.<br />Let me say at the outset that Australia is a proud host of<br />this conference and an unashamedly enthusiastic supporter<br />of the proposed convention.<br />Nor do we come as recent converts to the cause.<br />We have, we say with pride, been active in the forums of the<br />world not least in the Conference on Disarmament on this<br />and other disarmament issues.<br />we have of course forsworn any recourse to chemical weapons<br />and encourage others to do likewise.<br />Only last month, here in Canberra, officials from 22 nations<br />of the Asia-Pacific region attended, a seminar to discuss the<br />details of the proposed convention and its ramifications and<br />strategic benefits for our region. 1879</p>
<p>That seminar emerged from a proposal I launched last year to<br />develop a regional initiative on chemical weapons to<br />support at the regional level the efforts being made at<br />Geneva. The Australian Government has also worked closely with our<br />own chemical industry for many years, in the knowledge that<br />drawing industry into the processes of formulating and<br />implementing policy is the only effective way towards a<br />chemical weapons ban.<br />Our experience of conducting trial inspections of chemical<br />plants is one practical example of how cooperation with<br />industry can jointly advance understanding of the technical<br />issues awaiting resolution in the Convention.<br />So we host this conference thoroughly cognisant of the<br />complexities involved in this issue but let me hasten to<br />add, realistically optimistic that these complexities can be<br />resolved.<br />Delegates and friends<br />The prospect of a complete and lasting ban on chemical<br />weapons is indeed a compelling one.<br />we have before us the chance to terminate this grotesque<br />misapplication of the fruits of chemical science.<br />This would not only have inestimable value as a milestone in<br />its own right; it would also be a tremendous demonstration,<br />in the worldwide search for more comprehensive arms control<br />and disarmament, of what can be achieved with goodwill,<br />energy and patience.<br />Let each disarmament task be undertaken with the appropriate<br />tools; let the nexus between this conference and the forums<br />of nuclear disarmament be the bridge of greater confidence<br />and trust that we can provide by the successful achievement<br />of complete and verified chemical disarmament.<br />It would be a tragedy if any nation stood back from this<br />convention through misunderstanding of its aims and<br />requirements, or if any nation withheld adherence because it<br />wrongly felt the convention was in some way inimical to its<br />interests. Delegates No industry can operate in a moral vacuum, nor can its<br />activities be insulated from the broader concerns of the<br />society it serves and in which it finds its markets.<br />There is increasingly a feeling tha ' t industries must be held<br />to account for the effects of their, operations most<br />clearly evident of course in rising community concern about<br />the environment.<br />1880</p>
<p>The presence of so many distinguished leaders of the<br />chemical industry at this conference amply demonstrates that<br />in this vital industry you are taking your responsibilities<br />seriously and acting upon them.<br />Because of course the chemical industry has nothing to fear,<br />and much to gain, from the successful conclusion of a<br />chemicals weapons convention.<br />A chemical weapons convention,' will not be inimical to the<br />interests of the industry. It will not hamper legitimate<br />trade in chemicals or the flow of chemical technology.<br />Exactly the opposite is true: a convention with credible<br />verification will provide a vital safeguard, allowing the<br />industry to manufacture and trade freely and confidently for<br />any legitimate civil purpose.<br />In the absence of a convention, the chances of legitimate<br />activities being placed under clouds of suspicion of<br />unreasoning fears being experienced about chemical<br />technology of honest traders being discriminated against<br />are much higher. I<br />Central to the idea of a chemical weapons convention is true<br />and visible even-handedness. So in this conference, we must<br />act on the understanding that a solution that does not draw<br />on a consensus of all interested parties, and that is not<br />carefully crafted with all their concerns in mind, is, in<br />the long term, no solution at all.<br />The challenge and the inspiration of this issue is that we<br />must all work together. The nature of the task is that as<br />equal partners, we will work towards a goal which will make<br />us all equal beneficiaries.<br />The progress in Geneva gives us great hope and confidence<br />that there is at hand an effective and comprehensive<br />solution to the abhorrent threat posed by chemical weapons.<br />The Australian Government is convinced that the<br />international community has before it a real opportunity to<br />rid the world entirely of these weapons.<br />We are determined to do what we can to capture that<br />opportunity. My friends, when we look from this parliamentary building<br />across the lake we see on the other shore the Australian War<br />memorial, wherein are inscribed the names of all those who<br />gave their lives in battle for this nation.<br />Among them are those thousands of names of the victims of<br />chemical weapons of the First World. War.<br />many other nations have suffered even more grievously than<br />we, and more recently than we, from the scourge of this<br />repellent form of weaponry. 1881</p>
<p>We must ensure there are no more victims of chemical<br />warfare. We must ensure there are no more chemical weapons.<br />In conclusion, may I thank you all again, representatives of<br />industry and government, for your presence and for your<br />commitment to this important task and process on behalf of<br />all mankind.<br />1882</p>
