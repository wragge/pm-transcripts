    <content><![CDATA[<p>Obviously, footy fans right around Australia woke up to terrible news this morning. It was a dreadful, dreadful, dreadful tragedy.</p>
<p>Phil Walsh began his AFL career here in Hamilton. He was a very well-known and very well respected local from a very large and very well respected local family.</p>
<p>There is a pall over Hamilton, there is a pall over AFL more generally today and, like Dan, I certainly would want to extend my deepest condolences to his family, to his friends, to his colleagues and perhaps we might just pause for a moment or two of silence.</p>
<p>Thanks very much ladies and gentlemen.</p>
