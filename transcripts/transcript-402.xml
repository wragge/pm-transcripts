P. M. No. 58/ l96l<br />
OPPOSITION ELECTION PROMISES ANALYSED<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
I take first the specific proposals made by Mr.<br />
Calwell proposals on which he has made estimates of cost and<br />
put beside them the departmental estimates. Calwell Departmental<br />
: Cn. Å iu.<br />
Social Servi -es 93. 83.5 223.<br />
Heal'-h and Medical Benefits 30 33<br />
Housilg 5 15-25<br />
Local Government and Full<br />
Petrol Tax 14.5 19<br />
Smaller proposals 10 11<br />
152.5 161.5 311.5<br />
The higher figure reflects the estimated cost of<br />
complete abolition of the means test for age<br />
pension purposes.<br />
But this is only part of the story.<br />
Mr. Calwell's Education proposals<br />
will cost<br />
His Sales Tax proposals will cost<br />
His proposal to allow travelling costs<br />
as income-tax deductions will cost Å 28.5m.<br />
The new totals are, at this point<br />
Calwell Å 152.5m. Departmental Å 24Qm.-Å 39Om.<br />
The story does not end even there.<br />
It is clear that there are other very large items<br />
involved in Mr. Calwell's Policy Speech. For example, if<br />
proper estimates are made, establishment of a Conservation<br />
Authority for Northern Developmnt similar to the Snowy<br />
Mountains Authority may involve Å 25m. a year.<br />
The proposal to charter ships for international trade<br />
is equally clearly one which could not be performed except by<br />
the outlay of many millions.<br />
The vagueness of so many of his proposals makes cost<br />
calculation very difficult. How much will it cost to give, as<br />
he says, assistance to manufacturers to re-equip with the<br />
latest machinery? An initial depreciation allowance at the<br />
rate of 40% would cost annually some Å 70m. The introduction<br />
of investment allowances at the rate of 20% would cost about<br />
per year. How much to extend the Colombo Plan? How much to<br />
establish an Export Credit Bank? How much to establish a<br />
Commonwealth Insurance Corporation in the field cf external<br />
trade? Mr. Calwell gives no answer to these and many other<br />
questions. </p>
<p>2.<br />
It is clear from objective calculations that the<br />
estimates he offers are far removed from the facts. I said in<br />
Adelaide that the total costs would be of the order of Å E300n.<br />
That was an underestimate. I am satisfied that to give effect<br />
to the promises he has so freely made would cost the Australian<br />
people considerably more than this figure and that these costs<br />
could only be met either by widespread and severe increases in<br />
taxation, or by a most inflationary call upon Central Bank<br />
Credit. Everything that I have set out is, of course, over<br />
and above the normal and inevitable annual increase in<br />
Commonwealth expenditure on such items as Financial Assistance<br />
Grants to the States,' Commonwealth aid for roads, and Social<br />
Services, including health and medical benefits.<br />
This year the increases in Social Service and health<br />
and medical payments due solely to population growth will.<br />
amount to about Å l15m, Financial Assistance Grants to the States<br />
and aid fo-roads this year will increase by about Å C28m.<br />
W~ hatever government is in office will have to meet<br />
such increased expenditures as these.<br />
Mr. Calwell's promises are therefore additional.<br />
CANBERRA, November, 1961.<br />
