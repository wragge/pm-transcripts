EMBARGO: 7 mlSL 1<br />
QUEENSLAND BROADCAST NO. 1/ 4<br />
MEDIBANK ( 2)<br />
SUNDAY 22 JUNE 1975<br />
I SPOKE TO YOU ABOUT MEDIBANK IN THE VERY<br />
FIRST OF THESE BROADCASTS I GAVE THREE MONTHS AGO.<br />
I WANT TO RETURN TO THE SUBJECT THIS WEEK BECAUSE OF<br />
THE INCREDIBLE MUDDLE IN WHICH THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT<br />
NOW FINDS ITSELF THROUGH ITS EFFORTS TO SABOTAGE THE<br />
SCHEME. IT'S NOW LIKELY THAT QUEENSLAND WILL BE THE ONLY<br />
STATE PREPARED TO DENY ITS CITIZENS THE BENEFITS OF THE<br />
HOSPITAL SIDE OF MEDIBANK -THE ONLY STATE TO HOLD OUT.<br />
YOU SHOULD BE QUITE CLEAR IN YOUR MINDS<br />
THAT WHATEVER THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT MAY OR MAY NOT<br />
DO AND THEY'IVE HAD MANY MONTHS TO MAKE UP THEIR MINDS-<br />
* THE MEDICAL SIDE OF MEDIBANK WILL START AS PLANNED ON<br />
TUESDAY WEEK, FROM THAT DAY ON, EVERY AUSTRALIAN, EVERY<br />
QUEENSLANDER, WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY INSURED FREE OF CHARGE,<br />
FOR ALL MEDICAL TREATMENT. ALL OF US NOW HAVE OUR<br />
MEDIBANK CARDS. PEOPLE WILL PAY NOTHING FOR THEIR<br />
MEDICAL INSURANCE TO COVER DOCTORS'I BILLS,, IF THE DOCTOR<br />
SENDS HIS BILL TO MEDIBANK, PATIENTS WILL PAY NOTHING FOR<br />
THE DOCTOR'IS SERVICES. THAT'S GOING AHEAD AS PLANNED.<br />
IT IS ONE OF THE VERY GREAT SOCIAL REFORMS UNDER THIS<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENT. s/@ 2 </p>
<p>WHAT IS AT STAKE IN QUEENSLAND IS THE HOSPITAL<br />
SIDE OF MEDIBANK, Now I KNOW THAT QUEENSLAND ALREADY<br />
HAS FREE PUBLIC HOSPITALS, THANKS TO A PREVIOUS STATE<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENTS BUT THAT'S NO REASON WHY QUEENSLANDERS<br />
SHOULD BE DENIED THE EXTRA MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN REVENUE,<br />
THE EXTRA RANGE OF SERVICES AND OTHER BENEFITS THAT WOULD<br />
COME FROM FULL PARTICIPATION IN THE MEDIBANK ARRANGEMENTS.<br />
ONLY THIS WEEK, IN ADELAIDE, I SIGNED WITH THE<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIAN PREMIER. MR DUNSTAN, THE AGREEMENT<br />
MAKING-SOUTH AUSTRALIA THE FIRST FULL PARTICIPANT IN THE<br />
MEDIBANK SCHEME. I SIGNED A SIMILAR AGREEMENT WITH0<br />
TASMANIA. THESE AGREEMENTS MEAN THAT NOT ONLY WILL<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIANS AND TASMANIANS BE ENTITLED TO FREE<br />
TREATMENT IN '&amp; TA1 HOSPITAL WARDS; THEY'LL BE GETTING<br />
FREE OUTPATIENT SERVICES AND LOWER HOSPITAL CHARGES FOR<br />
INTERMEDIATE AND PRIVATE WARDS. ON TOP OF THAT, PRIVATE<br />
HOSPITALS NOT JUST PUBLIC HOSPITALS WILL BE GETTING<br />
A BETTER DEAL; ANOTHER $ 16 A DAY FOR EVERY PATIENT IN<br />
THEIR CARE, FOR THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT THERE'LL0<br />
BE A SAVING OF $ 28 MILLION A YEAR MONEY WHICH THE STATE<br />
CAN SPEND IN ANY AREA OF ITS RESPONSIBILITY ON BETTER<br />
HOSPITAL EQUIPMENT OR MORE HOSPITAL STAFF, OR ON OTHER<br />
THINGS THE PEOPLE NEED, LIKE SCHOOLS, RAILWAYS, ROADS, HOUSING. </p>
<p>3.<br />
THERE'LL BE SIMILAR BENEFITS FOR EVERY<br />
OTHER STATE THAT JOINS. THERE'LL BE SIMILAR BENEFITS<br />
FOR QUEENSLAND IF QUEENSLAND JOINS. YOU'LL HAVE NOTICED<br />
THAT SOME OF THE STATES THAT WERE HOLDING OUT<br />
PUTTING UP ALL SORTS OF UNACCEPTABLELAST-MINUTE.<br />
CONDITIONS, CONDITIONS INTENDED TO DESTROY THE WHOLE<br />
CONCEPT OF A FREE HOSPITAL SERVICE -ARE NOW ANXIOUS TO<br />
COME IN. WELL, GOOD-LUCK TO THEM -BETTER LATE<br />
THAN NEVER. BUT REMEMBER: FOR EVERY DAY THAT QUEENSLAND<br />
STAYS OUT, FOR EVERY DAY THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT<br />
DITHERS AND ARGUES, THE QUEENSLAND PEOPLE WILL PAY<br />
HEAVILY. IF THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT FAILS TO JOIN MEDIBANK<br />
THEY'ILL BE SACRIFICING AN EXTRA $ 50 MILLION A YEAR IN<br />
REVENUE FROM THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT. i1/ 4 </p>
<p>YOU'D WONDER HOW ANY STATE COULD JUSTIFY SUCH AN<br />
ATTITUDE, IN THE PAST FEW DAYS WE HAVE HEARD THE PREMIERS<br />
CRYING FOR MORE MONEY. WHY DON'T THEY USE THE MONEY WE<br />
OFFER THEM? WHY LET THIS OBSESSION WITH STATE RIGHTS<br />
STAND IN THE WAY OF THE PEOPLE'IS NEEDS? THE FACT IS THAT<br />
WE GAVE THE STATES A VERY FAIR FINANCIAL DEAL AT THE<br />
PREMIERS' CONFERENCE THIS WEEK. UNDER TLEGISATIO THA EILTO<br />
PASSED FIVE YEARS AGO, THE STATES WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTITLED<br />
TO $ 2997 MILLION NEXT FINANCIAL YEAR; THEY WILL IN FACT BE<br />
GETTING $ 3220 MILLION. THEY WILL HAVE 36 PERCENT MORE<br />
MONEY TO SPEND IN REVENUES IN THE COMING YEAR THAN IN THE<br />
YEAR JUST ENDING. QUEENSLAND' S GRANTS HAVE INCREASED<br />
FROM $ 414 MILLION THIS YEAR TO $ 564 MILLION NEXT YEAR.<br />
AND IF QUEENSLAND JOINED THE HOSPITAL SIDE OF MEDIBANK,<br />
THE STATE WOULD GET AN EVEN BETTER DEAL WITH<br />
HOSPITAL PATIENTS THE FIRST TO BENEFIT. DON DUNSTAN IS<br />
A BONNY FIGHTER FOR HIS STATE, BUT HE DOESN'T GO ALONG0<br />
WITH THIS STATE RIGHTS NONSENSE. HE'S JUST CALLED AN<br />
ELECTION IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA OVER ANOTHER ISSUE INVOLVING<br />
FINANCIAL AID FOR HIS STATE THE ISSUE OF RAILWAYS. HE'S<br />
NOT PREPARED TO ALLOW A HANDFUL OF CONSERVATIVES IN THE UPPER<br />
HOUSE TO BLOCK WHAT HE CALLS THE BEST FINANCIAL DEAL IN<br />
THE STATE'S HISTORY." NOR IS HE PREPARED TO REJECT THE<br />
BENEFITS OF MEDIBANK, </p>
<p>I THROUGHOUT THIS MEDIBANK ARGUMENT YOU<br />
HEAR A GREAT DEAL OF NONSENSE ABOUT MY GOVERNMENT WANTING<br />
TO TAKE OVER THE RUNNING OF STATE HOSPITALS, WE DON'T.<br />
WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS RESTORE IN EVERY STATE THE<br />
FREE HOSPITALS THAT EXISTED YEARS AGO, THERE WAS A TIME<br />
WHEN EVERY STATE HAD FREE HOSPITALS BECAUSE THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH AND STATE GOVERNMENTS WERE SHARING THE<br />
COST, THAT WAS THE RESULT OF AGREEMENTS WITH THE STATES<br />
MADE BY THE CHIFLEY LABOR GOVERNMENT IN 1947, THOSE<br />
AGREEMENTS WERE BROKEN OFF IN THE 1950' s BY THE MENZIES<br />
GOVERNMENT, WHEN THERE WAS A COUNTRY PARTY MINISTER<br />
FOR HEALTH. THE TRAGEDY IS THAT SOME LIBERAL AND<br />
COUNTRY PARTY POLITICIANS ARE STILL TRYING TO BLOCK<br />
THIS SIMPLE, NECESSARY MEASURE, THEY'VE DESTROYED<br />
ONE FREE HOSPITAL SCHEME. WE MUSTN'T LET THEM<br />
DESTROY THIS ONE. </p>
<p>IT'S PLAIN TO SEE THAT MR BJELKE-PETERSEN<br />
IS COMPLETELY AT ODDS WITH HIS TREASURER, HIS<br />
JUSTICE MINISTER AND HIS HEALTH MINISTER OVER MEDIBANK.<br />
HIS MINISTERS CAN SEE QUITE CLEARLY WHAT MEDIBANK WILL<br />
MEAN , IN TERMS OF REAL BENEFITS FOR QUEENSLAND. THEY SEE<br />
NOTHING SINISTER IN THE DEAL, NO HIDDEN STRINGS. THEY'RE<br />
BEING MUCH MORE REALISTIC ABOUT THIS THAN THE PREMIER,<br />
IT'S NOT SO LONG SINCE MR BJELKE-PETERSEN WAS FLYING TO<br />
PERTH TO PATCH UP A SQUABBLE BETWEEN THE COALITION<br />
PARTNERS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA, BEFORE THAT HE WAS<br />
TRYING TO ESTABLISH THE COALITION IN TASMANIA. IT'S 0<br />
ABOUT TIME HE SET HIS OWN HOUSE IN ORDER. IT'S A<br />
GREAT PITY HE CAN'T SETTLE THE SQUABBLE IN HIS OWN<br />
COALITION A DISPUTE WHICH WILL PROVE VERY COSTLY AND<br />
DAMAGING TO QUEENSLAND IF THE COUNTRY PARTY GETS ITS<br />
WAY IN CABINET AND THE BENEFITS OF MEDIBANK ARE<br />
DENIED TO THE QUEENSLAND PEOPLE, 0 </p>
