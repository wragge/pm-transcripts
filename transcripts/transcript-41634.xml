    <content><![CDATA[<p>Ramadan is a significant and blessed time for Muslim communities around the world, who gather to commemorate the revelation of the Quran, and commit to achieving greater restraint, self-sacrifice and compassion.</p>
<p>As Australian Muslims observe the fasting month, I hope you find peace and fulfilment in the sacred traditions, and strength in the knowledge that your brothers and sisters throughout the world are sharing in these with you.</p>
<p>Australians are fortunate to live in the most successful multicultural country in the world, where we are free to express our cultural and religious beliefs, and to nurture faith from one generation to the next.</p>
<p>The shared commitment of all our citizens to our values of mutual respect, friendship, inclusion, rule of law and peace is what lies at the heart of our success.</p>
<p>Australian Muslims have made a significant contribution to building our vibrant multicultural society. I wish all those observing this holy month a blessed and peaceful Ramadan.</p>
<p>Ramadan Mubarak!</p>
