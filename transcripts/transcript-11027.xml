<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>Prime Minister, can we ask you about the national coal strike?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Yes. Iâm very sympathetic to the situation of the Oakdale miners, and the Government is working very hard to try and find a fair and workable solution to that issue. But nothing is gained by strikes and I worry that strikes might weaken overseas buyer confidence in the Australian coal industry and that doesnât help anybody, particularly coal miners. But we are sympathetic to the Oakdale problem but itâs not an easy one because everything has a long term precedent. Youâve got to remember that this was a consequence of the coal mine going broke because of market forces, not because of anything the Government did. Itâs not the Governmentâs fault the mine went broke but we do understand the sense of grievance that the miners have. I understand that very much and we are working hard to find a fair and workable solution. And that is taking a little time but we are working hard on it and itâs not fair to categorise the Governmentâs response as one of indifference. Itâs not indifferent. Itâs sympathetic. But I donât know that having a strike is helpful to the cause of the coal miners. Thank you.</p>
