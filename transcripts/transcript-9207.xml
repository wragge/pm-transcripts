STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
AUSTRALIA FESTIVAL AT THE KENNEDY CENTER, WASHINGTON, DC<br />
I welcome the announcement today by the John F. Kennedy Center for the<br />
Performing Arts in Washington that it intends to hold an Australia Festival<br />
between October 9 and 16 this year.<br />
The week-long festival, featuring many of our best known performance artists,<br />
will promote Australia as a vibrant, creative society with a rich and unique<br />
cultural life.<br />
This can only enhance our image in the US, and help us understand each<br />
other better.<br />
The Kennedy Center's five theatres will showcase a wide cross-section of<br />
Australian talent including the Australian Ballet, Tjapukai Dance Theatre,<br />
Circus Oz and The Chamber Made Opera." Australian films will also be on<br />
display.<br />
The benefits flowing to Australia from the festival will be of great value. By<br />
giving Americans a glimpse of an Australia they seldom see, it will promote<br />
tourism, cultural trade and the exchange of creative ideas.<br />
I am particularly pleased that Aboriginal Australians will play such a key part<br />
in the schedule of performance. The Tjapukai Dance Theatre and the<br />
popular band Yothu Yindi will awaken Americans to the diversity of modern<br />
Australia and its remarkatle indigenous influences.<br />
The Australian Government will provide sponsorship for the Festival, with<br />
details in next week's Federal Budget.<br />
