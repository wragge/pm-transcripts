EMBARGO: _ 12.3Opm ALST<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 14 JANUARY 1983<br />
THE WAGE PAUSE PROGRAM<br />
The Government has decided on the allocation of the $ 300<br />
million it expects to save under the Wage Pause Program.<br />
In addition to the $ 100 million for welfare housing<br />
announced in December, $ 100 million will be provided for<br />
assistance to the young unemployed and $ 100 million to<br />
assist older unemployed and others disadvantaged in the<br />
labour market.<br />
The Wage Pause Program is framed in such a way as to<br />
provide maximum flexibility for each State and Territory<br />
to take account of its own problems and programs. It is<br />
intended that State and Territory initiatives for<br />
employment-generation and to assist youth would be<br />
considered for support under the umbrella of the Wage<br />
Pause Program.<br />
The youth element of the Program is intended to provide<br />
assistance to unemployed young people by offering them an<br />
opportunity to work on worthwhile community projects<br />
rather than being unemployed.<br />
The construction of capital works and other employment<br />
generating projects, funded from the remaining $ loom will<br />
assist the older unemployed, and others disavantaged in<br />
the labour market. This group will also be helped from<br />
the $ loom welfare housing package to a greater extent than<br />
will the young.<br />
Projects funded under the Wage Pause Program, through the<br />
States' allocations, would be run by organisations such as<br />
local councils, State authorities and voluntary<br />
organisations. Typical projects could include:<br />
National Parks and Wildlife activities;<br />
Conservation and environmental projects;<br />
National Heritage;<br />
Fo rest ry;<br />
Prevention of soil erosion;<br />
Local improvement projects.<br />
Projects should provide additional work and be of<br />
lasting value to the community. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
In writing to the Premiers and Chief Minister today, I<br />
have suggested that there be a meeting in Canberra next<br />
week of Federal and State Ministers to consider the<br />
Commonwealth's proposals. The Ministers would<br />
constitute a Committee to oversee the Wage Pause<br />
Program, under the Chairmanship of the Minister for<br />
Employment and Industrial Relations.<br />
Funds will be allocated between the States and the<br />
Territories on the basis of the recently released<br />
population statistics. on that basis, the $ 1O0m for<br />
each of the two new elements of the Program would be<br />
allocated as follows:<br />
N. S. W. 34.96<br />
Vic. 26.33<br />
Old 15.95<br />
S. A. 8.77<br />
W. A. 8.79<br />
Tas. 2.83<br />
N. T. 0.84<br />
A. C. T. 1.52<br />
The allocations recently announced for the welfare<br />
housing element will remain unchanged.<br />
The text of my letter to the Premiers is attached.<br />
My colleagues and I are anxious that the community<br />
receive benefits from the wage pause as soon as<br />
possible. Decisions will be finalised as soon as<br />
Commonwealth and State Ministers meet and money will be<br />
made availlable immediately after that.<br />
our wage pause savings can work for us. They will<br />
provide new work. Jobs which may otherwise have been<br />
lost may be saved.<br />
Savings made by the States and the Territories and in<br />
the private sector from the wage pause will have similar<br />
even greater -benefits.<br />
The community's widespread support for the pause has<br />
been most welcome. It should not be long before the<br />
benefits are apparent.<br />
Let us all support the pause for the sake of those who<br />
are out of work. o00000000o---</p>
<p>WAGES PAUSE PROGRAM ELEMENT FOR THE OLDER UNEMPLOYED<br />
AND DISADVANTAGED<br />
Funds provided by the Commonwealth are to be allocated<br />
to State and local government activities under the<br />
following guidelines:<br />
projects are to be worthwhile, meeting community<br />
needs and offering long-term benefits;<br />
projects are to have have high labour content and<br />
high Australian content;<br />
projects are to be commenced as soon as<br />
practicable, noting the Commonwealth's intention<br />
that assistance will terminate at end 1983;<br />
preference is to be given to projects in areas of<br />
high: unemployment;<br />
consideration is to be given to projects which<br />
create employment opportunities for unemployed<br />
women; employment on projects is to be additional to the<br />
level of employment in assisted organisations<br />
preceding introduction of the Wages Pause Program<br />
with projects not otherwise being assisted under<br />
existing Commonwealth or State programs;<br />
workers are to be recruited wherever possible<br />
through the CES, which would give priority to the<br />
placement of the long-term unemployed and other<br />
disadvantaged groups;<br />
employment is to be for a minimum of four months,<br />
and under award conditions for the occupations<br />
involved;<br />
projects are to have the maximum involvement of<br />
apprentices, with-out-of-trade apprentices to be<br />
taken on wherever possible;<br />
the Commonwealth contribution to projects is to be<br />
clearly indicated at the time of announcement and<br />
in subsequent project identification. </p>
<p>WAGE PAUSE PROGRAM YOUTH ELEMENT<br />
PROPOSED GUIDELINES<br />
Objective The objective of the scheme is to provide<br />
assistance to unemployed young people by offering<br />
them an opportunity to work on worthwhile community<br />
projects rather than being unemployed.<br />
Types of Projects<br />
The projects funded through the States' allocations<br />
would be managed by organisations such as local<br />
councils, State authorities and voluntary<br />
organisations. Projects should provide additional<br />
work and be of lasting value to the community.<br />
Typical projects would include:<br />
National Parks and Wildlife activies;<br />
Conservation and environmental projects;<br />
National Heritage;<br />
Forestry; Prevention of soil erosion;<br />
Local improvement projects.<br />
Existing or projected State youth employment<br />
programs could be included under the umbrella of<br />
this element.<br />
Eligibility The scheme would be open to young people under the<br />
age of around 25 years. Priority would be given to<br />
placing the longer term unemployed into the scheme<br />
through the direct involvement of the Commonwealth<br />
Employment Service as the referral agency. Because<br />
of the nature of likely projects, it will also be<br />
necessary to place more qualified people in<br />
supervisory positions. These supervisors need not<br />
be unemployed prior to entering the scheme.<br />
Remuneration Participants would receive a weekly remuneration<br />
set at an appropriate rate above the unemployment<br />
benefit rate for, single people.<br />
Duration of Participation<br />
Participants would be expected to enter the scheme<br />
on a full-time basis and for a period of at least<br />
three months, though desirably participation would<br />
be longer. The scheme therefore obliges young </p>
<p>2.<br />
people to enter with a sense of commitment to the<br />
project on which they are going to be working.<br />
Administration of the Scheme<br />
Funds would be allocated to States according to<br />
population. It would be expected that State<br />
Governments would call for proposals from their<br />
departments and authorities, local government and<br />
voluntary and community organisations and they<br />
would be responsible for approving projects and<br />
monitoring schemes. They will be given maximum<br />
flexibility to model the schemes in the light of<br />
particular State needs.<br />
