PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 16 AUGUST 1978<br />
INTERVIEW WITH VINCE SMITH, 2UE<br />
( Questions are not on tape)<br />
Question: Prime Minister:<br />
Well, I can guarantee one thing. If inflation and interest<br />
rates don't come down, you will never have economic recovery<br />
and unemployment will stay high or get worse and I would<br />
guarantee that absolutely and you've only got to look at<br />
what's happened in country after country overseas which have<br />
prematurely given up the fight against inflation. I heard<br />
you saying a moment ago that you thought it was a gloomy<br />
Budget. Well I don't think it is for one minute because<br />
most Australians know quite well that the services Governments<br />
provide have to be paid for and if we are not honest about<br />
it and aren't prepared to tax people for what we are providing<br />
by way of services or benefits or pensions or whatever, then<br />
the only other way of doing it, is basically by going to the<br />
printing press and we all know that that leads to more<br />
inflation.<br />
Question: Prime Minister:<br />
Well let me respond to that for a moment. The Budget papers<br />
indicate a rate of inflation, and it's a Treasury estimate,<br />
not ours and that might give it more credibility in some<br />
people's minds because it is a technical estimate, of 5 percent<br />
by June or earlier. Now, at that time, there are going to<br />
be very few major countries that have an inflation rate lower<br />
than ours. The United States certainly won't, Canada certainly<br />
won't, Germany will be below us, Japan probably will, but<br />
Britain and France and Italy will be significantly above our<br />
rate of inflation. Now that means that Australia starts to<br />
become more competitive, all Australian industry starts to<br />
become more competitive, not only in our own market but also overseas-<br />
and if our industry becomes more competitive that is<br />
good for jobs. But the other side of that inflation story<br />
is interest rates and there has been applause over the last<br />
three or four months in the movement downward in interest<br />
rates because people were waiting to see the Budget, but of<br />
all the criticisms I have noted this morning nobody has said that<br />
this Budget won't help in the fight against inflation, they<br />
all admit that it will and they also admit that it will help in<br />
the effort to get interest rates down. I have used these<br />
figures before but for the average young couple borrowing<br />
to build or buy their home at say $ 20,000, $ 25,000, a two<br />
percent fall in interest rates is ten dollars a week. A fall<br />
in interest rates is assistance to every business, every small<br />
business and if you want to talk about a stimulus to the<br />
Australian economy so that there will be more activity, too many<br />
people say well if there is a stimulus that means the Government's<br />
got to spend more, the Government's got to do more. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Prime Minister: ( continued)<br />
I just don't agree with that at all because I think that<br />
the best stimulus this economy can possibly have is by getting<br />
inflation down to that goal, objective, of 5 percent and at<br />
the same time getting interest rates down.<br />
Question: Prime Minister:<br />
But you're missing the point again you see, and people just<br />
don't see it. You seem to think, or other people seem to<br />
think that you can have less unemployment if a Government<br />
spends more money. Our predecessors showed when they<br />
increased Government expenditure 46 percent in one year,<br />
when unemployment rose by 200,000 in that very year and that<br />
was because of inflation and because of the damage done<br />
to the economy. Now, in circumstances in which we are in,<br />
the best stimulus you can give to an economy is to get<br />
inflation down and interest rates down and if that happens,<br />
then you are going to get businesses with one proviso that<br />
I will come to in a moment, employing more people and<br />
undertaking greater activity. I don't believe for one moment<br />
that the answer to our problems is to try and get more people<br />
on the Government payroll.<br />
Question: Prime Minister:<br />
The people in jobs are going to have money and any suggestion<br />
that they are not is just sheer nonsense. Let's take a<br />
levy, a Medibank levy, payer who won't have to pay the levy<br />
after a little while. He is going to be significantly better<br />
of and if he wanted to ensure up to the Medibank Standard Rate<br />
that would cost him significantly less than the levy.<br />
Certainly I know that beer and cigarettes are going to go up<br />
but they are only going to go back to the real level that they<br />
would have been in excise terms of three or four years ago<br />
and again, if you look at petrol, sure the price of petrol is<br />
going to go up, but when people come to buy a new car they<br />
will save, depending upon the price of the car, but $ 6,000 or<br />
$ 7,000, about $ 500. Now that $ 500 will pay for many many years<br />
the additional cost of the petrol as a result of these moves.<br />
Let me just make the point again, it's not shortage of cash in<br />
this economy because you've only got to look at the way the<br />
savings banks have been attracting larger and larger funds.<br />
Question: Prime Minister:<br />
And they've not been getting out into the community because<br />
inflation has been too high, and interest rates have been<br />
too high. It is not a shortage of cash. You get inflation<br />
dlown, interest rates down. . Surely you would agree that if<br />
the interest burden of building a new home was cut by $ 10 a week<br />
that is going to be significant in helping to get the home building<br />
industry healthy, isn't it. Well? A 2% fall in interest rates<br />
for home purchasers does mean $ 10 a week for the person on 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Prime Minister: ( continued)<br />
an average loan. All right, we haven't got there yet, but<br />
the permanent building societies have reduced their rates<br />
half a percent and this Budget, as everone agrees, will assist<br />
in the movement downward for interest rates further and what<br />
we want is a steady and sustained move down and we will achieve<br />
it, especially as we get nearer that inflation rate of<br />
percent. And then the savings to that home purchaser become<br />
not an objective on the horizon, they become a reality and<br />
that then starts to mean more homes being built and more jobs<br />
in the building industry. It's so easy to fudge these<br />
problems. It's so easy to pretend the difficulties in the<br />
economy don't exist. It is too easy for Governments just to<br />
spend more money and not tax for it. But the truth, and<br />
I believe that the people of Australia will respect the<br />
honesty of John Howard's Budget.<br />
Question: Prime Minister:<br />
Good heavens, no. The local oil companies have had their<br />
returns kept down to very low levels and that had inhibited<br />
oil search in this country. Under our predecessors oil<br />
search ceased. It is starting to build up again because they<br />
are getting a greater return but overwhelmingly the only way<br />
to get oil to world parity and at the same time for the<br />
community to get the benefit of it as the commnunity will be,<br />
is to do it in the way we have and you've got to understand<br />
also that the oil that we you know we're not completely<br />
self-sufficient in oil. A good deal of oil already comes<br />
in and we've got to pay world parity price for that and<br />
this is not just a measure to raise extra revenue, it's also<br />
a measure to get a proper allocation of resources. I don't<br />
think that people would want us to get into the problems<br />
that the United States' economy is facing quite specifically<br />
because they haven't got an energy policy and as consequence<br />
of that they've got an oil bill that is quite unrealistically<br />
high. Question: Prime Minister:<br />
Two things on that. If you've got any particular proposal<br />
for tax avoidance or any of your listeners have, that they<br />
think we are not pursuing, then I am quite certain the<br />
Treasurer would like to look at that and over the last six<br />
to nine months this Government has done more about cutting<br />
off, stopping, tax avoidance loopholes than I think any other<br />
Government in history. We'll continue with that path, but<br />
you've got to look at the need for additional tax, I think,<br />
against the circumstances in which it came about. At this<br />
time last year tax, underestimated tax refunds by $ 350 million<br />
and they overestimated the tax that would be collected from<br />
non-PAYE taxpapers by $ 400 million. That significantly lowered<br />
the tax base for the starting point of this year and if that<br />
hadn't occurred, the tax surcharge which will run out at the<br />
end of June, 1979, would not have been I think that would not<br />
have been necessary. </p>
<p>-4<br />
Question: Prime Minister:<br />
Well,' that's a great offence to the Treasury and tax officials<br />
that provided them. They would provide figures to the best<br />
of their technical knowledge and expertise and I agree that<br />
there were significant mistakes in the estimates last year<br />
but to suggest officials of the very high reputation of<br />
Tax and Treasury would do that for a political purpose, I think<br />
is a great slur on the character and integrity of public<br />
servants forwhom I've got the highest respect.<br />
Question: Prime Minister:<br />
No,, I don't think we can, because we don't know what the<br />
Arbitration Commission is going to do and one of the things<br />
the Government has said very plainly is if,-wuage increases<br />
are to continue at too high a rate, unemployment will stay<br />
too high. It's worth noting that average weekly earnings<br />
to the twelve months to June increased by more than the<br />
Consumer Price Index and that's worth noting. That was following<br />
a period in which average weekly earnings in the metal industry,<br />
for example, have exploded by over 50% in a two-year period<br />
and we were in a position in which wages had grown so much,<br />
and profits had fallen so much that industry just became<br />
unprofitable. Now we've got to get back to a situation of<br />
greater profitability for industry and that's the way real jobs<br />
will be provided in Australia. We can be assisted in that<br />
if there is some degree of restraint in wage decisions and<br />
we spelt out in the Budget very clearly the link between wages<br />
that are too high and unemployment and the people who are<br />
putting the case for increased wages need to understand that<br />
they've got one of two choices between them. They can argue<br />
for ever higher wages for those who are now in jobs, at the<br />
expense of those out of jobs; or they can show some restraint<br />
in additional wage claims and assist in the general national<br />
objective of reducing the number of unemployed.<br />
Question:<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Whether sack is the right word or not I would doubt because<br />
the control over staff ceilings we've achieved by wastage and<br />
resignations and we would propose to achieve our staff ceiling<br />
objectives in those ways. But again, there is not going to<br />
be any restraint or commonsense in this country if the totality<br />
of the Commonwealth Public Service and all the State Public<br />
Servants and the Governments in charge of them say look, it<br />
doesn't matter what wages are, because no matter how much they<br />
go up, the Government will have to pay the wages, it will have<br />
to go on expanding the Public Service and will have to either<br />
tax the general community more to meet that bill or print the<br />
money to meet that bill. Now, its time everyone understood<br />
that that is an utterly irresponsible attitude. </p>
<p>Question: Prime Minister:<br />
No, I think you're jumping to conclusions in that because<br />
I'd reject what you've just said. Medibank was a concept<br />
in relation to universal health care; universal health care<br />
and a more efficient and stream,, lined form remains and albeit<br />
at les-s direct costs to the average citizen. Medibank was<br />
nothing more than a concept of universal health care. Now<br />
you need to compare Medibank with what was there before when<br />
you had a voluntary system which wasn't universal but which<br />
did cover 93% and 94% of the total Australian community and<br />
are you going to say to me that Medibank, as a name, is the<br />
Health Services Commission and the Commonwealth Employees, what<br />
do you mean by Medibank? Isn't it universal health care?<br />
Question: Prime Minister:<br />
Yes, but this is at a base of the Government.' s involvement<br />
for every citizen and that concept has not altered.<br />
Question: Prime Minister:<br />
There is universal health care for every person in this<br />
community. The Government provides a basic level of health<br />
care for every person, whether they take out insurance or<br />
not. Question: Prime Minister:<br />
On the pension adjustments, the reasons for that are very<br />
plain indeed. When you have inflation running at 15, 16 or<br />
17% as it was when we came into office, six monthly adjustments<br />
were certainly necessary to maintain equity for pensioners.<br />
Now with inflation running at seven or eight percent and heading<br />
towards that five percent, annual adjustment will leave the<br />
pensioner much better off than he would have been with six<br />
monthly adjustments and inflation running at two or three<br />
times the present rate. Our commitment to pensioners is<br />
very clear and we protect them but it needs to be understood<br />
that the reduction of inflation protects pensioners just as<br />
it protects and assists all other sectors including the business<br />
section of the Australian community. And what was your<br />
third point?<br />
Question: / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
And we have brought taxes down. We brought taxes down on<br />
the first of February to the extent of $ 1.4 billion in a full<br />
year and together of course with $ 350 million from the first<br />
of this year for half indexation. Now, the additional taxes<br />
of $ 560 m~ illion still leave very very substantial benefits<br />
in the hands of all taxpayers. Its legislation that does run<br />
out at the end of this year. It would not have got into this<br />
position if the estimates of refunds which I mentioned earlier,<br />
and the estimates of collections from non-PAYE taxpayers had<br />
not been wrong at the time of the last Budget. Let me just<br />
make one other point about this. One of the advantages of<br />
the tax system we've introduced, and the tax indexation, is<br />
that we said it would keep Governments honest. Instead of<br />
be ing able to get more real revenue out of the people of<br />
Australia through the hidden processes of inflation pushing<br />
people into higher tax brackets, if Governments believed they<br />
needed more revenue they would have to tax for it<br />
and introduce legislation to do it and then justify it to<br />
the people of. Australia. So, the fact that we have had to<br />
collect extra funds this year through that surcharge is a<br />
demonstration of what we always said about tax indexation;<br />
it has forced us to bring in legislation and it has forced us<br />
to argue and justify it and I believe that is as it should be.<br />
Question:.. Prime Minister:<br />
It will be written into the legislation. that it expires.<br />
That's how we intend to introduce it. It will automatically<br />
expire at the stated time.<br />
Question:.. Prime Minister:<br />
No, it can't. We've had very significant success in getting<br />
inflation down. There has also been very significant success<br />
in getting stability back into the economy although still too<br />
great a movement in increases in wages. There has not been as<br />
much movement yet as we would have liked in a return to the<br />
profit share and obviously not as much movement in employment<br />
position as we would like, but I think that is very significantly<br />
related to the level of wages that are still too high. Now we<br />
are starting to get more investment in this country and in the<br />
end of the last financial year we were attracting investment<br />
from overseas again for the first time in many years and I think<br />
local'investors are also showing more confidence. Against that<br />
background, I believe that we can state that against the position<br />
we found it when inflation was 16-17% when we came into office<br />
and a. situation of no confidence whatsoever throughout the<br />
community, that there have been very considerable advances made. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
Prime Minister: ( continued)<br />
I would like to use an example that I've used to demonstrate<br />
the position before. It's very easy to wreck an ocean liner<br />
by running, it onto some rocks. You can do that in a matter<br />
of a few minutes,, but to repair that ocean liner, to get it<br />
set sailing fair again on the high seas, takes a very long<br />
while and when you damage, almost destroy, an economy utterly,<br />
it takes a very long while to put it right, especially when<br />
there are factors such as those under the influence of the<br />
Arbitration Commission which the Government can only affect<br />
very indirectly.<br />
Question:.. Prime Minister:<br />
I believe that the outlook is changing for many sectors of<br />
the Australian community and changing very much for the better<br />
and I also believe that there are many sectors of the Australian<br />
economy that already feel that they are a part of a<br />
prosperous community. All people have got a role to play in<br />
that and they've got a need to be responsible, to understand<br />
the Government can only provide, in terms of services, what<br />
Governments are prepared to tax the people to pay for, otherwise<br />
Government becomes irresponsible and if the people accept<br />
that, they tht-mselves are irresponsible. I believe that the<br />
generality of the policies that the Government has followed<br />
are understood by the Australian community, maybe much better<br />
understood than some of the headlines you get in the newspapers.<br />
Question: Prime Minister:<br />
I was making the point that I think many sections of the<br />
Australian community already believe that they are in that<br />
position. Not all, obviously, and not those who are unemployed<br />
and who want work but we'are going to see an increase in<br />
investment, we are going to see an increase in overseas and<br />
Australia as a great supplier'of natural resources while the trading<br />
world is going to be facing very considerable difficulties<br />
I think for quite some years ahead, Australia under this<br />
Government's policies will be well placed to take advantage<br />
of whatever trading opportunties come, whatever investment<br />
opportunities come and also well placed to withstand the<br />
difficulties of world trade. The reasons for that are<br />
that we are a resource supplier and the world needs; resources<br />
and to the extent that we have inflation under the world<br />
average, under that of other countries, to the extent that<br />
we offer stability in Government and in policy, we will attract<br />
more than our fair share of resource development and that will<br />
create jobs and activity, throughout many parts of Australia.<br />
