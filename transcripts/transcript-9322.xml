TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYNEHAM, 7: 30 REPORT, 19 AUGUST 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PL: Let's set the scene by going back to the start of this day. When you<br />
arrived at the new Parliament House here in Darwin, what was at stake<br />
did you think then?<br />
PM: Well, I think, what was at stake was the whole notion of ca-operation in<br />
a real sense In the Federation. That's what was at stake. Because, I<br />
think, there was a chance here today, and I think we've seized it, to<br />
see that all Australians come out winners, but the notion that we might<br />
fall and that these large areas of the States enterprises, in electricity,<br />
in gas, In water, in rail were not to be opened to competition means<br />
that it would ultimately stultify the long run recovery and we just<br />
needed to get a win.<br />
PL: So, if these State monopolies, like electricity for example, open<br />
themselves to competition, what does that do for Australia as a whole<br />
and how do I know about it in the end, how do I feel?<br />
PM: Well, I think, it is very much like the Commonwealth's reforms In<br />
telecommunications. You can see the competition now between<br />
Telecom and Optus. People can see a quite dramatic reduction in<br />
telephone call charges. That will be as obvious in electricity, in water,<br />
in gas and businesses, competitive businesses get the opportunity of<br />
cheaper supplies and therefore they are more competitive. They get<br />
an edge over someone else somewhere else in the world.<br />
PL: So, I get smaller bills perhaps as a consumer, a business gets smaller<br />
bills can compete with other companies overseas better.<br />
PM: And, we maximise our advantages. For instance, there is a coal seam<br />
all down the east coast of Australia. That is a national asset. That is a<br />
national comparative advantage. We've got gas throughout the<br />
Commonwealth, this is another natural comparative advantage. We<br />
want to employ, I mean, Australians all of us we need everything on </p>
<p>the line to keep ourselves competitive and we need to employ all these<br />
advantages and we simply couldn't while ever they were locked up in<br />
monopolies. So, this is a win for the whole Australian nation, not just<br />
for the Commonwealth and the States and the State governments and<br />
the Premiers et cetera. but mast importantly, for all Australians.<br />
PL: But, the battle here in Darwin today between you, the Premiers and the<br />
Chief Ministers has been based on the fact that they say they are out<br />
of pocket by all this because they lose the monopoly dividends that<br />
they have become so comfortable with.<br />
PM: Yes, well, they are in a sense, some of them are on the drip of profits<br />
that come out of these electricity and water and gas authorities and<br />
they wonder how their budgets will run without them. But, just as the<br />
Commonwealth Government, this Labor Government, has cut tariffs in<br />
the 1980s and 1990s and had a massive loss in customs duty, we've<br />
picked it up In a more active economy, a more efficient economy. And,<br />
the fact is, if we do pro-competitive things, the natural economic<br />
system works for you and States will end up, I don't think, with a very<br />
great loss of revenue at all.<br />
PL: But, they said their opening gambit was that you would be $ 5 billion<br />
better off at the Commonwealth level.<br />
PM: Well, I think, we very quickly dispensed with that and as you know,<br />
there was a lot of intransigence at this meeting until lunch time, but I<br />
think, the important thing is that it is all credit here to the Premiers and<br />
the Chief Ministers who took the longer view, the larger view, the<br />
bigger view, the national view. I think, all of us coming together means<br />
that we have secured a benefit for the whole country and for all<br />
Australians and that is the key point.<br />
PL: Now, you have agreed in this meeting which you at one stage today<br />
described as ' insufferably polite', you have agreed that you will try to<br />
work out what the gains to the Commonwealth are as a result of this<br />
new competitive spirit and give the States some share of It.<br />
PM: That's right. We are saying there Is obviously going to be some<br />
benefit to the Commonwealth. It won't be as much as the States think<br />
it will or have said it would, but we have agreed to assess it and we<br />
have agreed to share it with them In the event that they sign up to<br />
extending the Trade Practices Act to States authorities and to other<br />
pro-competitive changes as encompassed in the Hilmer Report.<br />
PL: And, meanwhile, you'll bring in legislation into the Parliament which<br />
you will show to everybody and not enact until there is a lot of<br />
community discussion. </p>
<p>PM: That's right. We will then table draft legislation and circulate draft<br />
legislation to the States, to business, to consumer groups..<br />
PL: This year?<br />
PM: this year probably and over Christmas and into next year for the<br />
February meeting of the Council of Australian Governments. So, by<br />
the time we get there we ought to be able to agree more about the<br />
parameters of funds and how we should split them, we've had a<br />
chance to work over the legislation to see a pro-competitive regime<br />
come In on July 1 in that year that's next year.<br />
PL: Now, not all States have agreed to all things have they?<br />
PM: No, no. Some have agreed to the core things, others not.<br />
PL: What happens if a State tries to stand out of all this?<br />
PM: Well, can I just say this Paul, the Commonwealth had a chance to,<br />
because of Its constitutional power, could for a very large part of this<br />
go it alone.<br />
PL: What legislate forcefully?<br />
PM: Legislate, use its constitutional power under the corporations power to<br />
legislate, but I think, it is important that this is done co-operatively and<br />
I wanted It done co-operatively. I mean, one of the Premiers said to<br />
me today, I don't know how you sit there with so much patience. Well,<br />
I'll set there until midnight if I have to to get a result and if we inch the<br />
debate along the road, inch by inch, if you pick up converts and you<br />
know, people who support you along the way<br />
PL: The Keating cart rumbles on?<br />
PM: Well, It's a change Isn't It? I mean one of my jobs, Premiers jobs, is to<br />
introduce changes and get them successfully executed.<br />
PL: And, this talk of perhaps a national dividend in total of around the<br />
billion a year mark by the end of this decade, is that a fairy tale?<br />
PM: I think that is, but that is from all micro-economic reform, not just that<br />
which we are thinking about today, that is from the ' changes to<br />
telecommunications, to ports and wharves. to ailines et cetera. But,<br />
even then, I think, it is a little over stated. But, the fact Is, there wAil be<br />
. I mean, this Is the last nut to crack. In the competitive breezes in<br />
this country which started in the 1980s when we removed the<br />
exchange controls, when we started knocking the tariff wall down,<br />
we've really now got some really we've got low inflation, we are a<br />
very competitive country now. One of the last bastions of resistance to </p>
<p>4<br />
competition were the States authorities and so we want this recovery<br />
in the 1990s to keep on going and when we get to those supply bottle<br />
necks like we did in the 1 980s, we don't want to see it spill Into imports<br />
and that Is why we've just got to get a better supply, a better response<br />
from the supply side of the economy. That is, from industry, from the<br />
States industries. That Is what this is about.<br />
PL: And, what's In place today now, this agreement to go ahead and the<br />
draft legislation coming in, that's not going to come unglued?<br />
PM: Well, I don't think so. I mean, we had a crack at It in February In<br />
Hobart. We got the States to agree in principle. In May we put some<br />
money on the table at the Premiers Conference to give them a much<br />
better financial formula. We've come back now and got the agreement<br />
of most of them to the core principles. I don't think some of the others<br />
can stand out. You know, once I think this legislation is drafted, there<br />
is popular community acceptance for It and we meet our commitment<br />
on sharing the income with the States, I think, we'll end up with a<br />
uniform result.<br />
PL: Prime Minister, thanks for your time.<br />
PM: Thank you very much.<br />
