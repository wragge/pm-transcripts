P RI ME ITNIL Z s~ S ro2" WA -i IY7 AC<br />
QUESTION: Could yo-u just rurt throu. rh why we are hiere,<br />
why you are here, why is. Aust::, Alia representedl?<br />
PRIME 1MINTST27R: It ou uite a -eay. There h* ave been<br />
proposals for the tbime of a Cornsmon Fund around.<br />
for quite some time, aid this was, a sigrif. 1. cant matter on the<br />
agenda of the Coirmonealth ) 1ecads of Govjerni-. ent Meeting In<br />
London. At that meeting 1 nrpoe -1' there should be a<br />
Commonwealth. technical rou to tLr n d'i_ whtwol<br />
be possible and was not :: os5ibie bec-ause there were wide<br />
differences of opi; nio-. n in tho requests of the Group 77 and<br />
and the B-Group countrics. ; oat tChat meeting the Commonwealth<br />
Technical Working Group wa; established Stewart Harris<br />
was the Australian rers: tiieon that. That lead to a<br />
report which was discuss, 72-t~ iie Coinmonwealth. Ministerial<br />
Meeting. Before that thcr2 1, d been the Corraonwealth Regional<br />
Meeting in Sydney where TAuf-Jtreiia announced a position on<br />
the Common Fund which was:. diifferent to that of the B-Group<br />
countries from the poini-of t'he view-of the Group 77 it was<br />
a significant adva.-nce, bas,: d on Aust ral ia's ow., n experience<br />
with conunodlity arrangemel-t;, land b;: ased on w-hat wie believed<br />
to be reasonabl~ e. We also ibclieve that if the Group 77 and<br />
B-Group countries remain stuck in -their o,. m paddocks, and<br />
nobody showed any sia : n of mo-Vement, ard the two groups<br />
might be in negotiations, b,. ut they certainly olouldn't<br />
get to any agreement ther; Ihad to be movement.<br />
The sort of positioa -that Australia. had adopted then got<br />
quite widespread support at a later~ .1Airisterial. M eeting,<br />
held, I think in A-pril aft'.: r the Con, onwealth Regional<br />
Meeting in Sydney.<br />
Meanwhile a negotiating conference ha(. been held which<br />
ended in failure, arnd as -you 1-now, anc-. ther negotiating conference<br />
on the Common Fund has more recently ee held which<br />
did indicate a quite signi-Ecant d-: ecree of. movement<br />
from the B-Group countries s* onc-m'-vement in the Group of 77<br />
but not necessarily a great de_, al. Out of that, I think<br />
the last meeting, there was the prospect of an agreement of<br />
some future meeting, but still some quite significant<br />
points of difference, and m'aybe so-me nroints5 of difference<br />
of philosophy about what people think. the Common Fund mi ght<br />
or might not do. It is starting to get t~ o the stage where<br />
people can talk more specifically about the areas and see<br />
if there are ways of resolvi,..: them.<br />
At the Conuronwealth M', etinis, Manley had expressed concern about<br />
these particular issues. At the begd.-nning of this year<br />
nearly 12 months originally proposed a meeting, arm that<br />
proposal arose out of discussions he had with Helmut Schmidt<br />
designed to get some developinq countries together in an<br />
informal and unstructured viay to try and see ways through.<br />
problems associated with the Comm~ ron Fun~ d and at the same<br />
time, some other issues that thJe that are regarded as<br />
important in the general north--south dialogue. </p>
<p>Australia's concern Ls think, on the one ha-dto try<br />
arnd see that a reasonab) le Eoair tra-de i-n co. rw. idities<br />
is established. We ( 3o jf rnm our ezperience in.<br />

In terms of thne general interest of trading nations, there<br />

developing countries can advance their own d evelomet Programmes<br />

I think Australia asked or I wa~ s~ z to come to<br />
this meeting as I was -zoc co to the meeting which didn't<br />
take place last May, b~ ca-@ of the conce-cn and interest that<br />
Australia had show.-n ma thi p rtcular to.-i, I th nk because<br />

<p>from any advantage of the so-called freer access to<br />
trade or markets the Common Fund discussion take place<br />
in a different form, UNCTAD and whatever. But if it<br />
wasto end up an advantage to those three major industrial<br />
groups, and if the diffferences which are starting to be<br />
narrowed, but still remain in Common Fund negotiations aren-' t,<br />
resolved by the time you get the major discussions at UNCTAD<br />
five in Manila which is in % lay, that could plainly be in those<br />
circumstances a very difficult forum and understandably<br />
so. Again, it is in the interests of all of us, I think, to<br />
not only try to make sure that the MTN does end up broader<br />
based, but also to make progress on the other issues.<br />
QUESTION: Early this year I think it was Strauss said that the<br />
Americans would walk away from those talks, his phrase<br />
a final agreement which did not include agriculture"<br />
Do you feel that if it goes as you are forecasting<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not forecasting and don't write it<br />
as a forecast please I am saying it is a danger.<br />
Until you see the final package you are not going to be able<br />
to assess what the result wil1l be. It always has been a<br />
danger, untilthe final package is determined it will. remain a<br />
danger. QUESTION: Do you think the Americans have down?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It is too early to say because what I have<br />
said is not a forecast. So far as Australia is concerned<br />
the negotiations the European negotiations relating to NTN,<br />
American negotiations relating to tUN, and Japanese, in some<br />
of those areas I have not doubt we will make progress no<br />
doubt at all. The extent to which the United States will<br />
throw her weight behind the need to include agriculture<br />
in the final result of rIrPN has yet to be proved and<br />
demonstrated. I know they have done a great deal and Strauss<br />
has spoken pretty trojantly on the issue*, but it ' is the<br />
result that will be the testing ground. The result could<br />
be adequate, and I have not the slightest doubt that the<br />
United States-will have to throw her own negotiating, strength,<br />
behind trade in agriculture in which the United States is<br />
not intimately involved, or intimately concerned. There are<br />
some commodities which the United States is intimately concerned,<br />
and clearly she will throw her negotiating weight and strength<br />
behind those things. For there to be adequate progress in the<br />
other areas the United States will also have to throw her<br />
weight behind the freeing of trade in other commodities.<br />
QUESTION: So the trend in which things are going at the moment..<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Don't make an assumption that the United States<br />
is not doing that, because the assurances they have given Australia<br />
are very real and very strong. The assurances are from you<br />
have mentioned Wolfe, but I think in a personal letter to me<br />
the President himself has given the same assurances.<br />
Against that, I think everyone knows the European Community can<br />
be fairly firm in their views.<br />
QUESTION: Assurances </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: ' The assurance is that the United States<br />
will not regard the t WN a success unless it is broad based<br />
and unless agriculture is included.<br />
QUESTION: What do you mean? Do you mean that Europe will . make<br />
some changes in its subsidy arrangements for agriculture, is<br />
that or are you talking about beef exports to Japan<br />
a series of bi-lateral mieetinqs? What exactly are our<br />
proposals of the beef and dairy products, and access to the<br />
markets for them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: In terms of the beef, Lindsay Duthie<br />
could give you a run down on that if you wanted it.<br />
The two main areas in which Australia is concerned are<br />
obviously in terms of marke-t access, but also in terms of<br />
export subsidies.<br />
QUESTION: Would you be talking with Hierr Schmidt while you<br />
are here about access for beef. products to the EEC?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Not, in this conference, no. I have no<br />
doubt there will be some discussions outside the conference,<br />
but I wouldn't be intending to raise any bi-lateral matters<br />
at the conference<br />
QUESTION: But outside?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Outside there will be some discussions, I have<br />
got no doubt.<br />
QUESTION: Are you saying then that the success of the M7rN<br />
from Australia's point of view then really depends on<br />
how tough the American<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I -think it depends on the United States<br />
negotiating strength, yes I do.<br />
QUESTION: What we get out of MVN?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Not just Australia, there would be many countries<br />
involved.<br />
QUESTION: But Australia's own position?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, but I am not talking about it from a<br />
bi-lateral point of view when I say that.<br />
QUESTION: This communication~ from the President was a recent<br />
one was it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It was a letter throughout the course of this<br />
last year I haven't got the date of it.<br />
QUESTION: I was just wondering about the context of the letter<br />
was it the same time that StrauIss was saying<br />
PRIME MINISTER: They have all said it. It's been published<br />
too, -the substance of it war, published. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Did you mention wool or did I.?<br />
PRIM4E MINISTER: I didn'lt mention any particular commodity.<br />
Wool is not a problemn with ' Europe so izuch.<br />
QUESTION: I thought you mic ht have meant an arrangement with the<br />
US. PRIME MINISTER: The known threat to our exports on a continuing<br />
basis, apart from market access to Europe, comes from<br />
a continuation of high export subsidies. That is the main<br />
threat to our trade.<br />
QUESTION: But there is nothing going to happen on that in the<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There are export subsidy codes, we have<br />
yet to find out what those codes finally say.<br />
QUESr ION: But even if we still have the codes there is<br />
still an inmmenise amount of bi-lateral dealings isn't there on<br />
the arrangements betw., een Europe, Japan and the US<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There is a good deal of bi-lateral discussions,<br />
all within the MTrN context.<br />
QUESTION: What you are really saying is that the trend at the<br />
negotiations is such that there is a danger that there may not<br />
be major concessions on agriculture that's.. particularly<br />
to flow from the intragience o-f the EEC, doesn't it?<br />
PRIME MINIST'ER: I think that is a fair statement, but it's<br />
not a new statement, it has always been there. I am not<br />
making the danger now as something greater than it was a month<br />
ago, or two or three or four months ago please -don't lose<br />
the reason why I am making this comment. I make the comment<br />
to emphasise the importance of making advances on matters that<br />
are of interest to the developing world. If you get<br />
agricultural commodities not getting much benefit out of<br />
this round of MTN discussions, it then does become something<br />
of significant benefit to the extent that it is a benefit<br />
it is a benefit for North America, Europe and Japan and that<br />
leaves many countries and the developing world in particular<br />
with the feeling of exclusion. That, again, just emphasises<br />
the importance of making progress in other forums. The other<br />
forum of most relevance to all of that is UNCTAD and the<br />
Common Fund negotiation.<br />
QUESTION:.. importance of the A merican's position, the strength<br />
of their negotiations.. reemphasise the agricultural positions<br />
in connection with the VlN?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wouldn't want this directly attributed to<br />
me at the moment, but one of the points I will be making is the<br />
importance of making sure that the iWN result is broad based.<br />
I think the argumrents in support of that are very strong ones. </p>
<p>I don't want you writing directly what I am going to be<br />
saying to President Carter when I see him so don't put<br />
that part<br />
QUESTION: What sort of time frame do yo-u see nowa on a resolution<br />
of the IVC N?<br />
PRIME M4INISTER: I understand people are talking about next<br />
March or April, but last April/ May they were talking about<br />
Jiily 15, and then they were talking about December the<br />
something or other. I am a little but sceptical about closing<br />
dates there is a great dea. of negotiation still to go on.<br />
QUESTION: Just on this point of attribution, we can " expect"<br />
that you will be making..<br />
PRIM E MINISTER: I would sooner you mnade it as remote as<br />
possible. QUESTION: ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You can expect that from what I have said in the<br />
past, or whatever. That has been the argument we have used<br />
the industrial tariff proposal is fairly im~ minent, if you<br />
are looking for something that is going to give an expansion<br />
to markets, a boos-t to world trade, you have got to go beyond<br />
that. That is one argum,, ent; the other argument is<br />
the geographic argument, in which the industrial tariff proposal<br />
alone too many countries are basically to benefit.<br />
It is a two-fold argument,, I made the views publicly often enough.<br />
QUESTION: You met Mr Manley this morning, could you tell us what<br />
you discussed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We wanted to exchange views on the format<br />
of the discussion, and the informality that there would be<br />
and had a brief discussion about the nature of the agenda and<br />
the format and order of that and we had some discussion on the<br />
Common Fund issue.<br />
QUESTION: Have you met any of the other Heads of Government<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, not yet.<br />
QUESTION: tonight<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Could be, but I am not quite sure what their<br />
movements are.<br />
QUESTION: Is Andrew Peacock here yet?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think hie is driving from the airport he<br />
should be here any time.<br />
QUEST'ION: Hlow long did you meet. Mr Manley for?<br />
PRIME MINISrER: About an hour. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Do you envisage in these discussion you will be<br />
playing a bridging role -for Australia between<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not envisaging any particular role for-<br />
Australia I have given the reasons why I think Australia<br />
was asked, and that is all on the record in a sense.<br />
I just have to see how the discussion goes, i think.<br />
QUEST'ION: I was just wondering how the proposals of the<br />
Grou-B and Group 77 could be brought closer together?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It is a cuestion of analysing the differences,<br />
and in this area it is important in a sense to analyse<br />
the purposes that people have in mind. One of the things<br />
that I think emerged in the last negotiating conference is<br />
that there maybe a conflict of philosophy If you want something<br />
which will help to stabilise prices on a commnercial viable<br />
basis that is one thing, but if you want a device which is<br />
going to result in the north-south ter-minology of a massive<br />
transfer of resources that seems to be a different<br />
sort of operation. There appear areas where matters need to<br />
be defined the secondl window operations haven't been defined.<br />
It's not surprising that people might be reluctant<br />
to finance second window operations if -they don't know<br />
what the purposes are Australia said it is prepared to<br />
finance second windows but we have attached our own<br />
definition to it,' to give an example of what we think would<br />
be responsible.<br />
QUESTION: Will you be tossing up some proposals which<br />
conceivably might bring the two sides closer together?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We have been and I think other people have<br />
to have been looking at the results of the negotiating<br />
conferences to see what the areas of difference are and<br />
what the options might be fore overcoming some of them.<br />
In some of the areas there might be several ways of overcoming<br />
the difference. In other areas you can get a more precise<br />
def inition of what is inLendei, what is in mind that in<br />
itself mighlt help to remove differences, or to remove concerns.<br />
QUEST'ION: Prime Minister, we are taking part in negotiations<br />
related to the MvTtN on new wheat arrangements. What proposals<br />
will we be putting forward for linking a new wheat agreement<br />
to a Common Fund?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know that we have put forward any,<br />
but to get to the details of that, I would ask Lindsay Duthie.<br />
QUESTIION: Have you named an amount that Australia is willing<br />
to contribute to start off the Common Fund?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, not yet, I don't -think it has got to<br />
that stage. </p>
<p>9<br />
SIDE 1 ENDS<br />
PRIME MINISTER There was an obligation to see what can<br />
be done to help them. I believe the Conference can play an<br />
useful role in helpinq them. May be defined in the minds<br />
of the participants at any rate, the ways in which the<br />
difficulties the remain to be overcome.<br />
QUESTION You don't seem to be, you know, really enthusiastic about<br />
this. PRIME MINISTER<br />
It's not a question of lack of enthusiasm, it's a question of<br />
reing cautious about somebody writing the great results,<br />
great decisions are going to be prominent. It's not that sort<br />
of conference. It's not a negotiating conference which is<br />
going to make decisions. There is nobody who can make<br />
decisions for the B group countries, there is nobody here who<br />
can make decisions for the group 77. But it is possible to<br />
Ahave people from different perspectives and different points<br />
of view. It's defining the issues and searching their own<br />
minds for a solution which may or may not be acceptable to<br />
other people. Now, if you can do that an advance has been<br />
made and there will be a great chance that the next negotiating<br />
conference thereby will be successful.<br />
QUEST ION<br />
Would you say there would be any chance ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINIa ER<br />
None at all.<br />
QUESTION ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINIT ER<br />
Well, we have got about 4 days to go yet.<br />
QUESTION ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINI ' ER I thought you said this calendar year.<br />
QUESTION No. </p>
<p>10<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I would have hoped so.<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTER: I think there will be a very great deal of<br />
disappointment and even bitterness. UNCTAD in Manila<br />
which Allan Griffiths reminds me will be held about May, if<br />
there can't be some agreement by then.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, I think it was in June that<br />
Mr Anthony and yourself announced Australia's response to<br />
the MrN ( inaudible) of the 14 per cent cut of tariff. We<br />
believe propositions that you or Mr Anthony put forward<br />
had a number of conditions attached to it. Could you tell<br />
me whether that offer is being changed?<br />
PRIME MINIST ER:<br />
QUESTION: Whether its being adhered to or whether its being<br />
accepted. What's the status of that in the KCN?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, it stands. In some areas countries<br />
would want us to Approve an offer and in other areas we would<br />
believe that in any sense of response to the kind that would<br />
enable that offer to stand. But, at the moment, it stands.<br />
And we hope that the response ultimately will be such that<br />
will enable it.<br />
QUESTION: Is it more likely to be withdrawn than improved?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That depends on response from other countries.<br />
QUESTION: ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You can't judge that clearly. But that will<br />
be one of the matters before us over the next two or three<br />
months. QUESTION: Does a lot of the disagreement on the Comnmon Fund<br />
boil down really to the size of Fund operations?<br />
PRIME MINIISTER: No, I think there are a number of areas.<br />
It must be very hard to write this stuff because it is technical.<br />
And hard to get, you know off the record, who are the<br />
mystics Sorry, where were we?<br />
QUESTION: You were saying it's hard to write.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I think it is, because its technical<br />
stuff, first window, second window. What's does that mean to<br />
us? The bloke in the street but there are some disagreements<br />
about the amount that will go into the market stabilising<br />
operations. </p>

PRIME IMI NS1' E R ( Contd) That' the first window.<br />
There arc? some who want a di~ r-ect link betw-een the first<br />

we are not prepared to put r11oney i-nto the second,.%, infdow operations,<br />

about second window-. s purposc; ar undK, 22_ ind. But it ought_ to<br />
be possible lto get down, and say, wel. 1 alrighlt, let's define<br />
the purpose. s of the second window operations. Is it research<br />
and prormotion? Does i~ t jo 1be-ond that.? Ancd the people ., ho<br />
are genuine about it there ought to be some thrincgs h-ich it<br />

So, one of the ddiil'fr-einrce nces hich mright be of<br />
