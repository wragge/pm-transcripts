    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.............................................</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>We're joined in the studio this morning by the Prime Minister</p>
<p>   of Australia, John Howard. Good morning Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, very nice to be with you again.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>You've had a busy round already, haven't you, last night,</p>
<p>   with meetings with Bill Gates.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, and the big announcement on Sunday, that Australians will</p>
<p>   be able to buy the remaining two thirds of Telstra. Gates is an</p>
<p>   interesting figure.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>You could have knocked that off... you could have done that deal</p>
<p>   last night.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, you could have except that the mums and dads wouldn't</p>
<p>   have got a look in if I had have done a deal with him so I didn't.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Is it true that you brought forward this Telstra announcement, that</p>
<p>   you wanted to make this release some time in April but you brought</p>
<p>   it forward for the conference?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no that's not true. I have been thinking for a few weeks</p>
<p>   that it would be a good idea to announce that Australians could</p>
<p>   buy the remaining two thirds and I decided late last week that it</p>
<p>   would be a good idea to do it at the weekend. It was the right forum,</p>
<p>   the right atmosphere and it has been very well received, not only</p>
<p>   by the media but more importantly, by the Australian public.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Unfortunately now the media, Prime Minister, is printing headlines</p>
<p>   such as "election race on for PM", cynical souls that</p>
<p>   they are.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They are indeed. Why do you do it?</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>I've got no idea why they do it because if you look at it,</p>
<p>   we've been talking about whether there's going to be an</p>
<p>   election for about the last six months, six or eight months and</p>
<p>   I guess a lot of Australians would say, hang on, we just had one,</p>
<p>   didn't we...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's right. That's not my fault. As far as I am concerned,</p>
<p>   I would be very happy if we went the full three years and the only</p>
<p>   thing that will stop us going the full three years is the necessity</p>
<p>   to have a double dissolution if some important legislation can't</p>
<p>   be got through the Senate.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Such as?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Such as the native title legislation, for example. Possibly indeed</p>
<p>   the legislation on Telstra. It depends how speedily it is dealt</p>
<p>   with by the Senate.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>So you would reject any sort of media speculation that says this</p>
<p>   is, the release of this Telstra policy is putting yourself right</p>
<p>   in election mode?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No it's not. It's obviously a good policy and it's</p>
<p>   a conjunction of good policy and naturally, responding to the aspirations</p>
<p>   of the people. People have demonstrated by their response to the</p>
<p>   first one third sale that they like the idea of spreading ownership.</p>
<p>   We've got 600 000 Australians for the first time in their lives</p>
<p>   who bought shares in that float.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>That's a terrific figure.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>92 per cent of the workers at Telstra, despite what the union says.</p>
<p>   The union might get up and say it's a shocking thing but 92</p>
<p>   per cent of the union members voted with their dollars to buy shares</p>
<p>   in the company.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Did you run this through some polling before you...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, we did not. We did not run it through polling and I make that</p>
<p>   point. The decision was based on good policy and my own instinct</p>
<p>   that it's something that the Australian public would support.</p>
<p>   The other point I do want to make is that on this occasion, as in</p>
<p>   the past, there will be a special deal for Telstra employees. I</p>
<p>   want to make that clear that just as in the first one third sale,</p>
<p>   the employees got a special deal. I can say to those employees again</p>
<p>   today on behalf of the Government that when we float off the remaining</p>
<p>   two thirds, once again the workers of Telstra will get a special</p>
<p>   deal.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>The workers who work at Telstra now or the workers that are working</p>
<p>   at Telstra at the time that the float is on?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the people who will be employed at the time the float is</p>
<p>   on.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Without everybody getting too excited, this Telstra bill would have</p>
<p>   to be rejected twice by the Senate, would it not?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>To be a double dissolution trigger? Yes, yes it would. Now I am</p>
<p>   not looking for that to happen. I just hope that the Senate will</p>
<p>   pass it and I am optimistic. I am a positive bloke. I will assume</p>
<p>   that they are going to pass it because it makes such overwhelming</p>
<p>   good sense.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Did you have other representations from another phone company at</p>
<p>   the Liberal Conference with regard to a major shareholder in Optus,</p>
<p>   and does this indicate to us that maybe the Optus float will be</p>
<p>   brought forward?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is a matter for Optus. I don't govern that. Did</p>
<p>   I have representations? Well I certainly met the Managing Director</p>
<p>   of that company. I met him at breakfast on Saturday morning but</p>
<p>   I certainly didn't discuss this issue with him. I didn't</p>
<p>   discuss this issue with any people in the corporate world before</p>
<p>   I made the announcement. I discussed it with my colleagues and I</p>
<p>   spoke to Senator Harradine a few minutes before I made the announcement.</p>
<p>   I certainly didn't canvass it with any of Telstra's rivals</p>
<p>   or competitors. That wouldn't have been proper.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>You must have been busy, with all the lobbying going on at that</p>
<p>   conference though? Didn't you not have an hour's quiet</p>
<p>   chat with Lachlan Murdoch?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I did. He was there. He came to see me and had a talk to me</p>
<p>   about matters relating to digital television and so forth.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Then you had chats....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Can I say, there is always a lot of mystery seen by some people</p>
<p>   in the media when a Prime Minister talks to a media proprietor.</p>
<p>   I don't disguise the fact that from time to time I will talk</p>
<p>   to Kerry Packer or Rupert Murdoch or the head of Fairfax, Bob Muscat,</p>
<p>   and others. Of course I talk to them on a regular basis, but not</p>
<p>   all that regular, from time to time. When they have a desire to</p>
<p>   talk to me I will do so. There's nothing sinister about that.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>How does the Editor of the Camberwell Progress Press go when he</p>
<p>   tries to get through to you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I actually talk to a lot of them when I go around the country.</p>
<p>   For example, I will be going into Fran Bailey's electorate</p>
<p>   of McEwen tomorrow and I will certainly spend time talking to local</p>
<p>   newspapers there. I make a particular point whenever I visit country</p>
<p>   or regional Australia of talking to local newspaper editors. I think</p>
<p>   that is part of the process.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>You must feel like the prettiest girl at the ball at the moment</p>
<p>   because there was Lachlan Murdoch last weekend and Kerry and his</p>
<p>   business partner in digital television, Bill Gates. Did they sidle</p>
<p>   up for a bit of a chat, did they want a dance last night?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I wouldn't quite put it like that but the conversation was</p>
<p>   animated and amiable.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>And was it about the subject of digital television at all?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Only fleetingly last night, fleetingly. It got a mention.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Is there a dollar in this for us as taxpayers?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What's this?</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>This digital television?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think there's better programming.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>But is there a dollar in it for us? Would the Government sell,</p>
<p>   are you going to sell it or are you...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We've got to decide how we're going to do that. There</p>
<p>   are various aspects to it. There's broadcasting and data casting</p>
<p>   and so forth. I think the decision that we will ultimately make</p>
<p>   will be one that is a fair, balanced one that does take account</p>
<p>   of the public interest as well as recognising that in relation to</p>
<p>   digital television there are costs involved and there are other</p>
<p>   policies to be met and honoured but we will get the decision in</p>
<p>   the right focus.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Tell us, you have managed with, well not you, but with the Cheryl</p>
<p>   Kernot episode of late last week and now Telstra, the Senator Parer</p>
<p>   issue seems to have disappeared at least for the short term. Leaving</p>
<p>   aside the issues of debating, whether he did the wrong thing, all</p>
<p>   that sort of stuff, at the end of the day, do you, with these Ministers</p>
<p>   feel a bit let down personally? You know, when you shut the door</p>
<p>   of The Lodge at night, do you ever ring up a Senator Parer and say,</p>
<p>   look, what do you think you are doing? Me, I've got to go out</p>
<p>   in the trenches again and defend you up hill and down dale. What</p>
<p>   are you doing owning coal shares as a Resources Minister? Do you</p>
<p>   ever feel let down by these people?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well certainly, I can't answer that question without it being</p>
<p>   seen in the context of Warwick Parer. I don't feel let down</p>
<p>   by him. I don't believe he has done anything wrong. I know</p>
<p>   him very well. I know all my Ministers well but I have known Warwick</p>
<p>   particularly well for a number of years. He's been a very successful</p>
<p>   businessman. He knows the resources industry better than any person</p>
<p>   in Parliament, better than any person in Parliament, therefore I</p>
<p>   think he ought to be the Minister for Resources. I think most of</p>
<p>   your listeners would think that's a damn good idea as well.</p>
<p>   I don't feel let down by him because I don't think he</p>
<p>   did anything wrong. I don't believe there's any conflict</p>
<p>   of interest so in his case the answer is no. Are you saying to me</p>
<p>   that over the time that I have been Prime Minister I haven't</p>
<p>   had frustrations about anything? Of course I have but not on that.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Do you feel let down by the other seven that you had to retire from</p>
<p>   their positions?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look, that's history now, history.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>You were a solicitor. I was once before I decided to go straight,</p>
<p>   I was one. I read the Guidelines and I can hold them upside down</p>
<p>   and sideways and try and read through a bit of paper even backwards</p>
<p>   and I still don't see how Senator Parer has complied with the</p>
<p>   Guidelines?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But at the end of the day they are guidelines, they are not a death</p>
<p>   sentence and you do have to look at the totality of his behaviour</p>
<p>   and there was no actual conflict of interest. Nobody has been able</p>
<p>   to say Warwick Parer made a decision that advantaged a company in</p>
<p>   which he or his family had a direct or indirect interest and as</p>
<p>   a result of that, he was enriched. Nobody has been able to ... and</p>
<p>   if they had been able to do that, that's a different matter.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Let's take a break, if you don't mind, Prime Minister.</p>
<p>   When we come back in just a moment we might address the old subject</p>
<p>   of tax and GST.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Please do.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, tax.. You want to reform taxation.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We do. We want to make it a fairer system.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>And are you offering us, when we discuss taxes we always think that</p>
<p>   last time tax came up on the agenda the country was offered a tax</p>
<p>   and anybody who wants to offer you a new tax seems like they're</p>
<p>   crazy.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We're going to offer people a fairer taxation arrangement.</p>
<p>   We obviously have to look at the introduction of a broad based indirect</p>
<p>   tax which would replace existing indirect taxes. Part of the deal</p>
<p>   would be a reduction in personal income tax with a particular emphasis</p>
<p>   on reducing income tax on families. We want to make the tax system</p>
<p>   in Australia one that encourages Australian companies to export</p>
<p>   more and invest. One of the weaknesses of the present system is</p>
<p>   that it really penalises exporters.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>You are going to set yourself the target, are you not, of selling</p>
<p>   this to the Australian people. I am guessing what is inside your</p>
<p>   mind. You are going to say, what happened last time, but a different</p>
<p>   bloke is in charge this time, it is going to happen this time. We</p>
<p>   are going to make it happen. Can we just, this is not an ambush</p>
<p>   but can we ask you to put on your headphones. We just want to play</p>
<p>   you something you might recognise from a few years back. It involves</p>
<p>   Mike Willesee and Dr John Hewson. Do you want to have a listen to</p>
<p>   this.</p>
<p>WILLESEE:</p>
<p>Can I just ask you a simple question as an example of this. If</p>
<p>   I buy a birthday cake from a cake shop and GST is in place, do I</p>
<p>   pay more or less for that birthday cake?</p>
<p>HEWSON:</p>
<p>It will depend whether cakes today in that shop are subject to</p>
<p>   sales tax or they're not.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Just because somebody else does it, Prime Minister, we want to be</p>
<p>   the first kids on the block here today with you on this St Patrick's</p>
<p>   Day, we want to be the first, we are going to fire the first cake</p>
<p>   of this election campaign. There you go, a cake-frosted GST. How</p>
<p>   do you cut the cake?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am going to cut the cake in a way that gives all Australians except</p>
<p>   the cheats a bigger slice. That is how I am going to cut it. All</p>
<p>   Australians except the cheats will get a bigger slice of my tax</p>
<p>   cut cake.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Do you set yourself a challenge, as proud as you are and as political</p>
<p>   an animal as you are, which is not meant as an insult, have you</p>
<p>   set yourself a challenge in your head. No. I am going to do it properly.</p>
<p>   I am going to sell this policy properly.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I certainly have. And I am.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>So you will look at those mistakes of Â93 and say, well, cakes</p>
<p>   and so forth I am not falling for?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not going to spend too much time looking at Â93 because</p>
<p>   that's five years ago and one shouldn't assume that what</p>
<p>   I am going to put forward is the same as what John Hewson put forward.</p>
<p>   We haven't finally decided what we are going to put forward.</p>
<p>   We're working on it and no final decisions have been taken</p>
<p>   although we have done an enormous amount of work, but nobody should</p>
<p>   start comparing what we're proposing with what was proposed</p>
<p>   in the past. I am very committed to taxation reform. The Australian</p>
<p>   public sees the present system as unfair and increasingly unworkable</p>
<p>   and they want the Government to have a go. The Labor Party just</p>
<p>   wants to knock it and stop it and block it and impede it. Now that's</p>
<p>   a very negative backward looking attitude. Mr Beazley opposes every</p>
<p>   single thing I talk about.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>How many cakes are you going to see between now and October?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't eat them very often and I don't think you will</p>
<p>   see too many.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>You've got no quarrel with October then?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No particular meaning with October but don't indulge yourself</p>
<p>   in trick questions. I mean, Gary Gray says it's the fourth</p>
<p>   of July so you're saying it's October, are you?</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Speaking of the fourth of July, the Gulf War, now when are these</p>
<p>   chaps of ours coming home. There are only so many short black coffees</p>
<p>   they can drink.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they will come home when we make the decision that it's</p>
<p>   no longer in the interests of maintaining pressure on Saddam Hussein</p>
<p>   for them to remain there. It's too early yet. I hope they're</p>
<p>   not there and they won't be there indefinitely but they were</p>
<p>   sent there as part of an allied effort to put pressure on him and</p>
<p>   it appears thus far to have worked and to have worked magnificently.</p>
<p>   There's no doubt that he would never have buckled if he has</p>
<p>   buckled, and we don't know that for sure yet. He would never</p>
<p>   have buckled if there hadn't been the threat that force would</p>
<p>   be used. And it was the determination of the Americans and the British</p>
<p>   and ourselves and others that have forced him at least at this stage</p>
<p>   to allow something that he was previously refusing.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>We old cynics in the media, you don't think there might be</p>
<p>   a bit of an itchy finger on the trigger in the United States at</p>
<p>   the moment given the problems the President of the United States</p>
<p>   is having with all his lovers coming out and talking about him?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can't fault his handling of this issue. He has behaved correctly</p>
<p>   and strongly and the American leadership on this issue is what has</p>
<p>   made it possible for the inspections to resume and if ultimately,</p>
<p>   it leads to the discovery of weapons of mass destruction and their</p>
<p>   destruction, then it will have been principally because of what</p>
<p>   the Americans and what President Clinton has done, so the answer</p>
<p>   is no.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>What do you think when you've got a cup of tea in your hand</p>
<p>   and you've got the slippers on at 10.30 and you watch the late</p>
<p>   news and the latest revelations come out about the President? </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't really want to...</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Do you think to yourself, at least I am answering questions about</p>
<p>   Senator Parer's coal shares, I'm not having the Grand</p>
<p>   Jury come around and visit...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>My own dealings with Bill Clinton have been highly professional.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Do you feel embarrassed for him?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I regard him as a very competent President and a very successful</p>
<p>   politician The question of personal issues is not one that I care</p>
<p>   to comment on in any way. I really don't. I just don't</p>
<p>   want to get into that, I'm not interested in it. I don't think</p>
<p>   the private lives of politicians have got any face in public debate.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>If you were seeing him at the moment, would you mention it in conversation</p>
<p>   briefly, say look, I'm sorry you're having your problems?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not seeing him at the moment. Good try, but I just don't</p>
<p>   want to comment on that.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Tell us, there has been speculation for a fair old while about</p>
<p>   the nature of your relationship with Jeff Kennett as to how well</p>
<p>   you get on. Could I put it this way. If you were in a balloon with</p>
<p>   Pauline Hanson and Jeff Kennett and you started to lose altitude,</p>
<p>   who would go out first?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It wouldn't be Jeff. </p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>He is heavier than Pauline. Assume he's had a haircut. Do you</p>
<p>   get on, I mean..</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, there's always a bit of banter between I guess Federal</p>
<p>   and State Liberal leaders. We had some differences in the past.</p>
<p>   People know that but I have found, particularly over the last year</p>
<p>   that we worked together very well. I saw him last night. He was</p>
<p>   at the Gates dinner, the World Economic Forum dinner here in Melbourne</p>
<p>   and Jeff and I have got a good working relationship. We've</p>
<p>   got some style differences. Neither of us try to disguise that and</p>
<p>   there's no point in doing so but we both want similar goals.</p>
<p>   His views on most political issues in fact are much closer to mine</p>
<p>   than the views of some other Liberal leaders around the country.</p>
<p>   He has similar views about small business and fixing up the industrial</p>
<p>   relations system and the role of Government in the community. His</p>
<p>   sporting pursuits are a little different from mine but not dramatically</p>
<p>   so.</p>
<p> PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Is this the first time, you mentioned Gates just then, is this the</p>
<p>   first time a world business leader has been invited to address a</p>
<p>   Cabinet meeting as such, and why is he addressing Cabinet?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's certainly not the first time a business leader has. There's</p>
<p>   a bit of mythology about that. Past governments of which I have</p>
<p>   been a member often sat, Cabinet sub committees have had large groups</p>
<p>   of Australian businessmen in the Cabinet room for discussions. The</p>
<p>   Hawke and Keating Governments did that. There's nothing really</p>
<p>   new about it. I don't think there's, you know, we should</p>
<p>   adopt this sort of sacrosanct attitude to a meeting of Cabinet.</p>
<p>   If there is somebody who has got something relevant to say about</p>
<p>   Australia's future or the world's future and it's</p>
<p>   appropriate that that person talk to the Prime Minister and the</p>
<p>   members of a Cabinet, then that person ought to be invited in. I</p>
