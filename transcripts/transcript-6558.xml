CEDA LUNCHEON PERTH 19 NOVEMBER 1984<br />
WHEN AUSTRALIANS GO TO THE POLLS ON I DECEMBER THEY WILL<br />
CHOOSE THEIR GOVERNMENT FOR THE NEXT 3 YEARS. THEY WILL<br />
ALSO DECIDE TWO CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT REFERENDUMS.<br />
THOSE REFERENDUMS ARE OF PROFOUND SIGNIFICANCE FOR<br />
AUSTRALIANS IN ALL WALKS OF LIFE.<br />
CEDA's INTEREST IN THESE MATTERS HAS BEEN OF LONG-STANDING.<br />
INDEED, CHERYL SAUNDERS RECENT PUBLICATION " THE REFERENDUMS,<br />
1984"' PUBLISHED AS PART OF THE CEDA STUDIES SERIES IS A<br />
VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE ISSUES<br />
INVOLVED.<br />
BOTH PROPOSALS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE SIMULTANEOUS<br />
ELECTIONS ( OR TERMS OF SENATORS) AND INTERCHANGE OF POWERS<br />
ARE IMPORTANT STEPS TOWARDS BETTER GOVERNMENT IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
THE SIMULTANEOUS ELECTIONS PROPOSAL WILL<br />
BRING BETTER GOVERNMENT BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF ELECTIONS.<br />
IN THE LAST 20 YEARS WE HAVE HAD TWELVE FEDERAL ELECTIONS,-OF<br />
WHICH THREE HAVE BEEN HALF-SENATE ELECTIONS. THE ADDITIONAL<br />
COST OF A HALF-SENATE ELECTION IN CURRENT TERMS is $ 19.2 MILLION. a / 2@ </p>
<p>THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SIMULTANEOUS ELECTIONS WILL SAVE<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN TAXPAYER A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY. IT WILL<br />
ALSO REDUCE THE DISRUPTION TO BUSINESS AND THE COMMUNITY<br />
GENERALLY CAUSED BY TOO FREQUENT ELECTIONS THAT MEANS<br />
SIMPLY, BETTER GOVERNMENT.<br />
BUT THE REFERENDUM QUESTION ON WHICH I WISH TO FOCUS TODAY<br />
IS THE INTERCHANGE OF POWERS PROPOSAL, WHICH WILL ENABLE THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH AND STATES VOLUNTARILY TO REFER POWERS TO EACH<br />
OTHER. THIS PROPOSAL, IF PASSED, WILL HAVE POTENTIALLY VERY<br />
SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS FOR BUSINESS, LATER IN THIS SPEECHI<br />
WILL ADDRESS THESE BENEFITS AT SOME LENGTH,<br />
BUT BEFORE DOING SO I WISH TO MAKE SOME GENERAL OBSERVATIONS<br />
ABOUT THE OPPOSITION's POSITION ON THESE REFERENDUMS.<br />
THESE TWO REFERENDUM PROPOSALS ARE BEING PUT TO THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
PEOPLE BY A FEDERAL LABOR GOVERNMENT. THEY ARE BEING OPPOSED<br />
BY THE OPPOSITION, UNDER MR PEACOCK AND MR SINCLAIR.<br />
YET AS IT HAPPENS THESE REFERENDUM PROPOSALS ARE AS MUCH<br />
OPPOSITION PROPOSALS As GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS.<br />
THE OPPOSITION PARTIES HAVE PREVIOUSLY SUPPORTED THESE PROPOSALS<br />
CONSISTENTLY BOTH IN OPPOSITION AND IN GOVERNMENT. YET NOW<br />
THEY HAVE DECIDED TO CHANGE TOTALLY THEIR POSITION FOR THEIR<br />
OWN SHORT TERM POLITICAL REAS") ONS. </p>
<p>CONSIDER, FIRST, THE SIMULTANEOUS ELECTIONS PROPOSAL.<br />
THE FRASER GOVERNMENT ITSELF PUT THIS PROPOSAL TO THE<br />
PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA IN 1977. MR PEACOCK AND MR SINCLAIR<br />
SUPPORTED THE SIMULTANEOUS ELECTIONS REFERENDUM WHEN IT<br />
WAS PUT TO THE PEOPLE IN 1977,<br />
THEN DURING THE 1983 ELECTION CAMPAIGN MR FRASER, AS<br />
PRIME MINISTER, GAVE AN UNEQUIVOCAL PROMISE TO PUT A<br />
REFERENDUM FOR SIMULTANEOUS ELECTIONS IN HIS NEXT TERM<br />
OF GOVERNMENT,<br />
SO THAT WAS THE OPPOSITION'S POSITION IN GOVERNMENT. IN<br />
OPPOSITION, UNDER MR PEACOCK AND MR SINCLAIR, THEY MAINTAINED<br />
THAT POSITION UNTIL VERY RECENTLY.<br />
LAST YEAR THE OPPOSITION SUPPORTED IN PARLIAMENT BOTH THE<br />
SIMULTANEOUS ELECTIONS PROPOSAL AND THE INTERCHANGE OF<br />
POWERS PROPOSAL, WHICH WERE TWO OF FIVE REFERENDUMS THE<br />
GOVERNMENT WAS THEN PROPOSING. THEY SUPPORTED THEM AND<br />
THEY VOTED FOR THEM. BUT NOT ONLY THAT, MR PEACOCK HIMSELF<br />
SPOKE IN GLOWING TERMS OF THE MERITS OF BOTH THESE PROPOSALS.<br />
SPEAKING IN PARLIAMENT ON 20 OCTOBER LAST YEAR MR PEACOCK SAID:<br />
", THE OPPOSITION SUPPORTS THESE BILLS WE BELIEVE<br />
THEY WILL CONTRIBUTE TO BETTER WORKING OF THIS PARLIAMENT<br />
AND OF THE GOENET a/ 4s </p>
<p>HE STATED: " ALL THE PROPOSALS ARE USEFUL! INDEED SOME ARE VERY<br />
NECESSARY. IF CARRIED, THE CHANGES WILL HELP TO<br />
ENSURE THAT THE CONSTITUTION [ S MODERN AND RELEVANT<br />
To AUSTRALIA'S NEEDS<br />
BUT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO PUT THESE<br />
TWO PROPOSALS TO THE PEOPLE ON THE SAME DAY AS THE ELECTION?<br />
MR PEACOCK AND MR SINCLAIR DECIDED IT WAS POLITICALLY<br />
CONVENIENT TO OPPOSE THE PROPOSALS.<br />
Now CONSIDER THE OPPOSITION'S POSITION, SPECIFICALLY ON THE<br />
INTERCHANGE OF POWERS PROPOSAL.<br />
THIS PROPOSAL WAS FIRST PUT FORWARD BY THE VICTORIAN LIBERAL<br />
( HAMER) GOVERNMENT AT THE 1973 CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION.<br />
THE OPPOSITION HAVE SUPPORTED THE PROPOSAL EVER SINCE THE<br />
1973 CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION UNTIL NOW,<br />
SHADOW ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SENATOR DURACK, IN MAY 1983 SAID OF<br />
THIS PROPOSAL ON BEHALF OF THE OPPOSITION: </p>
<p>" IT HAD AS FAR AS I COULD SEF, INANIMOUS SUPPORT AT<br />
im: AUh LJIDE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION AND IT SFFMS<br />
A UShIUL FACILITY TO HAVE IN TIHE CONSTITUTION".<br />
EVEN SIR JOH BJELKE-PETERSEN RAISED NO OBJECTION WHEN THE<br />
PROPOSAL WAS DISCUSSED AT THE ADELAIDE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION<br />
LAST YEAR. AND, INCIDENTALLY, SENATOR BJELKE-PETERSEN VOTED<br />
FOR THE PROPOSAL IN PARLIAMENT,<br />
So THE SITUATION IS THIS. THE OPPOSITION WHEN THEY WERE IN<br />
GOVERNMENT THEMSELVES PUT THE SIMULTANEOUS ELECTIONS<br />
REFERENDUM TO THE PEOPLE IN 1977 AND CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED<br />
IT EVER SINCE. THEY PROMISED IT IN THE 1983 ELECTION CAMPAIGN.<br />
THE OPPOSITION THEMSELVES ORIGINATED THE INTERCHANGE OF<br />
POWERS PROPOSAL AND HAVE CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED IT EVER SINCE.<br />
MR PEACOCK SPOKE IN GLOWING TERMS ABOUT BOTH PROPOSALS IN<br />
1983 AND THE OPPOSITION UNDER MR PEACOCK SUPPORTED BOTH<br />
PROPOSALS AND VOTED FOR THEM IN PARLIAMENT.<br />
BUT THEN WHEN THIS GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO PUT THE PROPOSALS<br />
TO THE PEOPLE ON THE SAME DAY AS AN ELECTION MR PEACOCK AND<br />
MR SINCLAIR SUDDENLYCRANGED THEIR MINDS. THEY DECIDED IT WAS'NT<br />
POLITICALLY CONVENIENT TO MAINTAIN THEIR LONG-HELD POSITION.<br />
THEY DECIDED THERE WAS SOME SHORT TERM POLITICAL GAIN TO BE<br />
HAD IN OPPOSING THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE SAKE OF OPPOSING, SO<br />
THEY TOTALLY REVERSED THEIR POSITION A FEW MONTHS AGO DESPITE<br />
THEIR OWN FIRMLY HELD AND PUBLICLY STATED CONVICTION THAT BOTH<br />
THESE PROPOSALS WERE IN THE INTERESTS OF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE.<br />
WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS PUT THEMSELVE. FIRST'AND PUT AUSTRALIA LAST, </p>
<p>I'VE HAD CAUSE TO DESCRIBE THIS OPPOSITION AS THE MOST<br />
NEGATIVE OPPOSITION IN LIVING MEMORY AND THIS OPPOSITION<br />
LEADER AS THE MOST NEGATIVE OPPOSITION LEADER 114 LIVING<br />
MEMORY, IN VIEW OF THEIR BEHAVIOUR ON THESE REFERENDUM<br />
PROPOSALS I THINK YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO REASONABLE STANDARDS<br />
OF CONSISTENCY AND HONESTY FROM THEIR POLITICAL LEADERS.<br />
AND THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAS JUST AS MUCH OF AN INTEREST IN<br />
THIS AS THE REST OF~ AUSTRALIA. THE OPPOSITION HAVE NOT<br />
DISPLAYED THOSE STANDARDS ON THESE REFERENDUM PROPOSALS.<br />
IN VOTING ON THE REFERENDUMS THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE WILL<br />
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT PROPOSALS WHOSE MERITS ARE<br />
IN FACT CLEAR TO BOTH SIDES OF POLITICS. BUT THEY WILL<br />
ALSO IIAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THFY'VF HAT) ENOUGH OF<br />
OPPOSITION' FOR THE SAKE OF OPPOSITION AND THAT THEY EXPECT<br />
REASONABLE STANDARDS. OF CONSISTENCY FROM THEIR POLITICAL LEADERS&amp;<br />
I NOW TURN SPECIFICALLY TO THE INTERCHANGE OF POWERS PROPOSAL<br />
AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. THIS PROPOSAL<br />
HAS SPFCIAL-RELEVANCE( TO THE ISSUE OF BUSINESS REGULATION.<br />
IN DELIVERING MY PARTY'S POLICY SPEECH LAST WEEK, I SAID<br />
THAT THE RECONSTRUCTION OF AUSTRALIA NEEDS THE SYSTEMATIC<br />
REMOVAL OF UNNECESSARY INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL IMPEDIMENTS<br />
TO APPLYING OUR NATIONAL RESOURCES TO THEIR MOST PRODUCTIVE USES. 7' s </p>
<p>IUNDERTOOK THEN THAT OVER THE TERM OF THE NEXT PARLIAMENT<br />
WE WILL REMOVE LEGISLATION AND REGULATION WHICH IS DAMAGING<br />
TO BUSINESS AND EMPLOYMENT EXPANSION, AND WHICH IS NOT<br />
JUSTIFIED AS AN EFFICIENT MEANS OF PROMOTING ECONOMIC AND<br />
SOCIAL OBJECTIVES,<br />
EXAMPLES OF BUSINESS REGULATION LEADING TO ECONOMIC<br />
INEFFICIENCY REQUIRE LITTLE ELABORATION TO A GROUP SUCH AS<br />
THIS. DIFFERING REQUIREMENTS FOR PACKAGING, FOR EXAMPLE,<br />
ADD GREATER COSTS TO BUSINESS AND THE CONSUMER WITHOUT<br />
SUBSTANTIALLY ENHANCING PRODUCT QUALITY OR CONSUMER PROTECTION.<br />
AGAIN, IN THE BUILDING AND CONSTRUICTION INDUSTRY, THERE ARE<br />
PROBLEMS CAUSED BY DIFFERENT TESTING REQUIREMENTS AND<br />
STANDARDS OF APPROVALl<br />
THERE ARE OTHER PROBLEMS. SUCH AS THAT OF OVERLAP BETWEEN<br />
STATE FEDERAL LAW LEADING TO UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION OF<br />
FUNCTIONS. A WELL-KNOWN EXAMPLE OF THIS, WHICH CAME TO<br />
PROMINENCE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, IS THE OPERATION IN SOME<br />
STATES OF DUAL COMMONWEALTH AND STATE MEAT INSPECTION SYSTEMS,<br />
CONVERSCLYo LEGIGLATIVC C14ANGES AT CITtICR STATE OR FEDERAL<br />
LEVEL CAN RESULT IN PROBLEMS OF GAPS IN REGULATORY COVERAGF<br />
WHICH BENEFIT NEITHER BUSINESS OR CONSUMER.<br />
IWISH TO TALK ABOUT THE SOLUTIONS TOWARD WHICH WE WILL BE<br />
WORKING TOGETHER AFTER DECEMBER I AND THE MECHANISMS WE NEED<br />
TO ACHIEVE THOSE SOLUTIONS, 6 / 8. </p>
<p>FIRST, IN SEPTEMBER, IN AN ADDRESS TO THE BUSINESS COUNCIL,<br />
I ANNOUNCED AN INVITATION TO BUSINESS GROUPS AND TO THE ACTU<br />
TO WORK WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ON PRIORITIES IN THE<br />
REFORM OF BUSINESS REGULATION.<br />
EARLY LASI MONIH, WITH A NUMBER OF KEY MINISTERS, I MET<br />
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BUSINESS COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA, THE<br />
CONFEDERATION OF AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY, THE AUSTRALIAN CHAMBER<br />
OF COMMERCE, THE NATIONAL FARMERS FEDERATION AND THE ACTU<br />
AND ASKED THEM TO IDENTIFY CONCRETE AREAS WHERE REGULATION<br />
WAS NOT COST-EFFICIENT OR BENEFICIAL.<br />
THE UNDERTAKING I HAVE GIVEN IS CLEAR<br />
" WE WILL EXAMINE CRITICALLY THE WHOLE RANGE OF<br />
BUSINESS REGULATION, MOST IMPORTANTLY WITH A VIEW<br />
TO ASSESSING ITS CONTRIBUTION TO LONG-TERM GROWTH<br />
PERFORMANCE. WE WILL MAINTAIN REGULATION WHICH, UPON CAREFUL<br />
ANALYSIS, CLEARLY PROMOTES ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY,<br />
OR WHICH IS CLEARLY AN EFFECTIVE MEANS OF ACHIEVING<br />
MORE EQUITABLE INCOME DISTRIBUTION.<br />
AND WE WILL ABANDON REGULATION WHICH FAILS THESE<br />
TESTS". </p>
<p>OUR SECOND INITIATIVE WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE FIRST WEEKS OF SITTING<br />
OF THE NEW PARLIAMENT. My GOVERNMENT WILL ESTABLISH AN<br />
ALL-PARTY PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE, TO BE CALLED THE JOINT<br />
STANDING COMMITTEE FOR BUSINESS AFFAIRS, THIS WILL HAVE A<br />
COMPREHENSIVE BRIEF TO EXAMINE EXISTING AREAS OF REGULATION<br />
AND PROPOSALS FOR FUTURE LEGISLATION AFFECTING BUSINESS,<br />
OUR THIRD INITIATIVE, AND MY MAJOR REASON-FOR BEING HERE<br />
TODAY, IS TO REMIND YOU OF THE CENTRAL IMPORTANCE TO US ALL<br />
OF THE INTERCHANGE OF POWERS REFERENDUM. THIS MEASURE<br />
OFFERS US A VITAL MECHANISM FOR THE STATES AND COMMONWEALTH<br />
TO FIND THE RIGHT TIER OF GOVERNMENT AT WHICH THE RIGHT KIND<br />
OF REGULATION SHOULD OCCUR.<br />
ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS OF BUSINESS REGULATION OF THE<br />
KIND I HAVE OUTLINED HAVE FOUNDERED IN THE PAST ON AN<br />
UNDERSTANDABLE RELUCTANCE ON THE PART OF STATE GOVERNMENTS<br />
TO DISCUSS THE REFERRAL OF POWERS WITHIN A CONSTITUTIONAL<br />
FRAMEWORK WHICH PERMITS SUCH REFERRAL ON A ONE-WAY BASIS<br />
ONLY THAT IS FROM THE STATES TO THE COMMONWEALTH. THE<br />
PASSAGE OF THIS REFERENDUM WILL PERMIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A<br />
NEW SPIRIT OF CO-OPERALTION IN FEDERAL/ STATE RELATIONS IN<br />
TACKLING THE PROBLEM OF BUSINESS REGULATION.<br />
THE INTERCHANGE OF POWERS PROPOSAL DOES THIS BY ENABLING THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH TO REFER THESE EXCLUSIVE LAW-MAKING POWERS TO<br />
THE STATES AND BY CLARIFYING THE TERMS ON WHICH THE STATES<br />
CAN REFER POWERS TO THE COMMONWEALTH. </p>
<p>IT ALLOWS THE STATES TO PUT CONDITIONS AND TIME CONSTRAINTS<br />
ON ANY POWERS REFERRED TO THE COMMONWEALTHi AND ALLOWS THE<br />
STATES TO CONTINUE TO EXERCISE THEIR OWN POWERS AND TO<br />
REVOKE THE REFERENCE OF POWER, AND VICE VERSA.<br />
AS THE PREMIER,, MR BURKE, HAS SAID PREVIOUSLY, THE<br />
INTERCHANGE PROPU5AL ' MAKES A LOT OF SENSE". EQUALLY<br />
IMPORTANT FOR THE STATES IS TIIC rACT TlIAT NOTHhING CAN DC<br />
FORCED ON ANY STATE.<br />
IN STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS REFERENDUM, I EMPHASISE<br />
AGAIN THAT IT SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT,<br />
INDEED.-I CAN-DO NO BETTER THAN TO QUOTE THE WORDS OF<br />
DICK HAMER, THEN LIBERAL PREMIER OF VICTORIA, IN MOVING<br />
THE INTERCHANGE OF POWERS PROPOSAL AT THE HOBART CONSTITUTIONAL<br />
CONVENTION IN 1976.<br />
HE SAID: " IN THIS MOTION THE CONVENTION HAS ITS GREATEST<br />
SINGLE CHANCE OF ACHiEVING A REALLY IMPORTANT CHANGE IN THE<br />
CONSTITUTION, WHICH WILL AT ONE STROKE GIVE IT A FLEXIBILITY<br />
AND RESPONSIVENESS IT DOES NOT YET HAVE, AND AN ABILITY TO<br />
DEAL WITH SITUATIONS AS THEY ARISE, WITHOUT ANY OF THE<br />
PARTNERS FEDERAL OR STATE SURRENDERING ANY OF THE POWERS<br />
OR DISCRETIONS THEY NOW HAVE".<br />
THE PASSAGE OF THE INTERCHANGE OF POWERS PROPOSAL ON<br />
DECEMBER 1 WILL ALLOW JOINT ACTION BY COMMONWEALTH AND STATES<br />
ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS AND IN A CO-OPERATIVE SPIRIT. ./ 11. </p>
<p>THERE ARE A . NUMBER OF AREAS CRYING OUT FOR SOLUTION, WHICH<br />
CAN BE HELPED BY THE INTERCHANGE PROPOSAL AND THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S REVIEW OF REGULATION6<br />
THE FIRST AREA IS COMPANY LAW AND BUSINESS LAW IN GENERAL.<br />
DESPITE A GREAT DEAL OF COMMITTED WORK BY THE STATE. S AND<br />
COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENTS OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS, THE<br />
CO-OPERATIVE COMPANIES SCHEME SEEMS TO BE VIEWED BY THE<br />
PEOPLE IN IT BUSINESSES AND THEIR ADVISERS AS IN NEED<br />
OF RE-EVALUATION AND SIMPLIFICATION.<br />
THE INTERCHANGE OF POWERS PROPOSAL WOULD MEAN THAT THERE<br />
COULD BE GREATER RATIONALISATION OF OUR INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS<br />
SYSTEMS TO THE BENEFIT OF UNIONISTS AND INDUSTRY GENERALLY.<br />
THE PROBLEMS OF DUAL REGISTRATION OF UNIONS IN FEDERAL AND<br />
STATE JURISDICTIONS COULD BE OVERCOME BY DEVISING A SINGLE<br />
SYSTEM OF REGISTRATION FOR BOTH JURISDICTIONS$<br />
THE INTERCHANGE PROPOSAL WOULD ALSO MEAN THAT, WHERE A STATE<br />
WAS IN AGREEMENT, GAPS COULD BE FILLED IN FEDERAL LAW<br />
RELATING TO COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS INSURANCE.<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT. HAS THIS YEAR STREAMLINED AND<br />
CLARIFIED THE LAW WHICH GOVERNS-INSURANCE CONTRACTS,<br />
HOWEVER, TO EXTEND THE LAW TO -ALL INSURANCE COMPANIES AND<br />
OFFICES IN THE COUNTRY REQUIRES JOINT LEGISLATION BY BOTH<br />
STATE AND COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTS&amp; 12. </p>
<p>AS A FINAL EXAMPLE, THE INTERCHANGE PROPOSAL WOULD ENABLE<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE STATES TO TAKE STEPS TO ACHIEVE AN<br />
INTEGRATED COURT SYSTEMi THEREBY OVERCOMING JURISDICTIONAL<br />
UNCERTAINTIES IN A NUMBER OF AREAS,<br />
MOST OF THE COMMONWEALTH'S POWERS ARE CONCURRENT, THE PROPOSAL<br />
WILL HAVE NO APPLICATION. TO THESE SINCE THE STATES RETAIN<br />
THE SAME POWERS TO LEGISLATE SUBJECT ONLY TO ANY OVERRIDING<br />
COMMONWEALTH LEGISLATION. ONE OF THE FEW EXCLUSIVE<br />
COMMONWEALTH POWERS AND THE ONE WHICH HAS ATTRACTED SOME<br />
INTEREST IS THE POWER TO IMPOSE EXCISE DUTIES. THE OFFICIAL<br />
' NO' CASE MAINTAINS THAT THIS ' IS THE REAL REASON FOR THE<br />
PROPOSAL BEING PUT FORWARD. NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM<br />
THE TRUTH.<br />
THE OPPOSITION, CONSISTENT WITH THE NEGATIVE AND OPPORTUNISTIC<br />
APPROACH THEY HAVE TAKEN THROUGHOUT THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN,<br />
HAVE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT A MAJOR REASON FOR THIS REFERENDUM<br />
PROPOSAL IS TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE COMMONWEALTH TO<br />
TRANSFER TAXING POWERS TO THE STATES,-AND TO HONOUR ITS<br />
COMMITMENT. NOT TO RAISE THE OVERALL TAX BURDEN.<br />
THIS IS BLATANT RUBBISH. THE REASONS FOR'SUPPORTING THE<br />
REFERENDUM HAVE ALREADY BEEN OUTLINED. IF STATES WISH TO<br />
RAISE TAXES, OR INDEED TO REDUCE TAXES, THEY DO NOT REQUIRE<br />
THE INTERCHANGE POWERS. WHAT A. POSITIVE OUTCOME ON THIS<br />
REFERENDUM WOULD PERMIT IS A GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN OUR<br />
CONSTITUTIONAL FISCAL ARRANGEMENTS IF THE STATES THEMSELVES,<br />
REPEAT THEMSELVES, PUT FORWARD PARTICULAR PROPOSALS IN REGARD<br />
TO TAXATION. </p>
<p>IT IS SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, FOR THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
TO FORCE THE STATES TO CHANGE THEIR TAXING ARRANGEMENTS<br />
OR THE LEVEL OF TAXES IMPOSED.<br />
IN THIS TIME OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY, WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT<br />
OPPORTUNITY, AS WELL AS A GREAT NEED, TO RE-DOUBLE OUR<br />
EFFORTS TO REFORM POLICY AND INSTITUTIONS IN MANY AREAS.<br />
IMPORTANT TO LONG TERM ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE.<br />
THE GREAT TASK OF REVIEWING THE GREAT VOLUME O'F LAWS AND<br />
REGULATIONS AFFECTING BUSINESS WHICH HAVE ACCUMULATED OVER<br />
THE PAST 84 YEARS OF THE AUSTRALIAN FEDERATION HAS ALREADY<br />
BEGUN. IN THE PERIOD AHEAD WE WILL BE WORKING WITH A WIDE<br />
RANGE OF BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY GROUPS TO REMOVE UNNECESSARY<br />
INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL OBSTACLES TO NATIONAL ECONOMIC<br />
RECONSTRUCTION.<br />
THE CHALLENGE IS CONSIDERABLE. IT IS NOT A JOB FOR ONE LEVEL<br />
OF GOVERNMENT ALONE. IT IS ONE ON WHICH WE MUST ALL PULL<br />
TOGETHER. EVERY MECHANISM WHICH WE CAN HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL<br />
TO ASSIST US IN REVIEWING REGULATION IS IMPORTANT.<br />
THE INTERCHANGE OF POWERS PROPOSAL IS THEREFORE CENTRAL TO<br />
THIS PROCESS. IT CAN PROVIDE THE MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH<br />
FEDERAL-STATE CO-OPERATION IN SIMPLIFYING BUSINESS REGULATION<br />
CAN OCCUR.<br />
I COMMEND THE REFERENDUM PROPOSALS TO YOU. </p>
