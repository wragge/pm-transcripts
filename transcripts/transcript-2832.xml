3" II A1.1 A d PRESS STATEMENT<br />
February 1973<br />
PAPUA NEW GUINEA-INDONESIA<br />
My visit to Papua New Guinea and Indonesia has achieved two<br />
purposes. It has enabled me to renew my close personal contacts<br />
with the leaders of Australia's nearest neighbours. It has<br />
enabled me, for the first time since the election of the new<br />
Government, to explain personally the new policies and directions<br />
my Government will follow in its international relations, and to<br />
hear the views of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea on issues of mutual<br />
concern. My visit was in keeping with the four basic commitments of an<br />
Australian foreign policy which I enunciated in my policy speech.<br />
These commitments are, firstly, to Australia's own securuty;<br />
secondly, to a secure, stable and united Papua New Guinea; -Chirdly,<br />
to develop closer relations with our nearest neighbour, Indonesia;<br />
and fourthly, to promote the peace and prosperity of our<br />
neighbourhood. In Papua New Guinea I emphasised Australia's determination<br />
to see Papua New Guinea achieve independence within the life of the<br />
present Australian Parliament. This determination is well understood<br />
and widely accepted. Papua New Guinea's problems will not be removed<br />
by delaying or fearing independence. They will only he removed by<br />
embracing it.<br />
The striking difference between Papua New Guinea now and two<br />
or three years ago is that all parties now accept the inevitabili-.<br />
of independence and are working actively towards it. Arguments zii: out<br />
timing or method there may be, but arguments about aims and princpies<br />
have disappeared. In Papua New Guinea the tide has turned, and it<br />
has turned in favour of change. There can be no stopping this process<br />
now. Australia has a continuing and enduring role to play in<br />
assisting the progress and prosperity of Papua New Guinea. One of<br />
the aims of my talks was to stress that Australia's commitment to<br />
Papua New Guinea would last well beyond the achievement of<br />
independence. We are needed in Papua New Guinea and will be neecdd<br />
for a long time to come. We shall not fail the trust that the people<br />
have placed in us. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
My other aim in Papua New Guinea was to stress the need<br />
for national unity. I made it clear that a secure and prosperous<br />
independent nation would be established only through the unity<br />
of many different tribal, cultural, regional and linguistic<br />
elements. Our aid will be channelled through a national gcvernment<br />
in Port M~ oresby. Our dealings with Papua New Guinea will be<br />
between the national Government in Canberra and the national<br />
Government of a united, independent Papua New Guinea. There is<br />
no future, there is no hope, in fragmentation and parochialism.<br />
In Indonesia, I believe I established a closer personal<br />
contact-with President Soeharto. It is of great importance that<br />
the leaders of Australia and Indonesia should be on the friendliest<br />
terms. I was touched by the President's warmth and hospitality.<br />
I wanted to explain to President Soeharto the new more self-reliant<br />
and independent Australian approach to its foreign relations and<br />
assure him personally that these changes would not affect the<br />
continuing process of strengthening Australia-Indonesian relations.<br />
I was impressed by the great differences between Australia<br />
and Indonesia. But our history and our geography have combined<br />
to give our two countries the unique oppogrtujnity to_ bridge these<br />
differe7_ nces. we have an exciting opportunity to set -an' e'xaipJe;<br />
to see that two such different societies can form a constructive<br />
and mutually advantageous relationship of cordiality and real<br />
and lasting value.<br />
I did not go to Indonesia with any blueprint or firm plans<br />
for a future regiona. organisation. Australia has no wish to<br />
impose her views on her friends and neighbours. I had frank and<br />
useful discussions on the future of the Asian region with<br />
President Soeharto and his ministers. I found that fundamentally<br />
the Indonesian and Australian Governments have very simil. ar views<br />
about the future of the Asian and Pacific region. I was gratified<br />
that President Soeharto welcomed our interest in the evolution of<br />
a more broadly based and representative regional forum. If such<br />
a forum is achieved it will be through close and detailed<br />
negotiations..-with Indonesia and all other interested nations in<br />
the South-East Asia region.<br />
