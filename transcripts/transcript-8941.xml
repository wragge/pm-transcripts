PRIM MIPISTE<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
IDGELL BIRDS EYE POTATO PROCESSING PLANT<br />
ULVERSTONE, 23 AUGUST 1993<br />
I'm very pleased to be here in Ulverstone.<br />
Some mainland Australians are inclined to think of<br />
Tasmania as coming along behind the rest of the countryas<br />
a beautiful billabong cut off from the mainstream of<br />
the rest of Australia.<br />
But in fact as we learned on the evening of March 13-<br />
in many ways Tasmania leads the way.<br />
For some time now Tasmania has had some of the model<br />
export industries of Australia innovative, premium<br />
quality industries of the kind which Australia can and<br />
must have to succeed in the modern world.<br />
There are tremendous prospects for Australian industry in<br />
the nineties and beyond, and no sector of industry has<br />
greater prospects than the food industry.<br />
Today I am here to congratulate the people at this plant<br />
for their initiative.<br />
I am also here to urge everyone in the-food industry to<br />
get behind the program being developed h_ j my colleagues,<br />
Simon Crean and Alan Griffiths, and the 1Agri-Food Council<br />
to treble the level of food exports-.-high quality clean<br />
food exports by the ye~ i -2000.<br />
McKinsey and Company have estimated that by the end of<br />
the decade the food market in East and South East Asia<br />
will be worth in excess of $ 200 billion per annum. </p>
<p>we in Australia are very well placed to take advantage of<br />
this growth: for the first time in our history we have<br />
the advantage of proximity to our major markets;. we have<br />
a highly efficient agricultural sector; we have enormous<br />
agricultural capacity; we have a much better<br />
understanding of what is needed to succeed in Asia<br />
better marketing, better delivery, better product.<br />
And, crucially, we also have the elements which make this<br />
plant such an exciting reality we have innovative food<br />
processors and a union movement which is behind<br />
Australian industry, including the food industry.<br />
It is a measure of the collective spirit driving the<br />
initiative an6 a clear indication of its potential<br />
strength thatiwe have on the Agri-Food Council, along<br />
with the leading manufacturers, Martin Ferguson from the<br />
ACTU, the CSIRO and the National Farmers Federation.<br />
Above all, it demonstrates a mutual understanding of the<br />
economic imperatives facing Australia the economic and<br />
social imperatives: our national wealth depends on our<br />
ability to export, and on this also depends our ability<br />
to create jobs. Exports and jobs go hand in hand.<br />
we're inclined to talk ourselves down in Australia<br />
we're inclined to underestimate both our chances and our<br />
ability to grasp them.<br />
I don't underestimate them. I think the best chance<br />
Australia has ever had awaits us in the Asia-Pacific<br />
and, indeed, in the rest of the world.<br />
And I think we have changed so dramatically in the last<br />
decade there can be no question of our ability to<br />
succeed. I could read you out a lot of figures which prove beyond<br />
doubt that we are much more competitive than we were a<br />
decade or even five years ago.<br />
I could statistically demonstrate how the economy is<br />
changing in size and shape, and changing as we need it to<br />
change. I could provide all the evidence needed to convince a<br />
reasonable person that, despite our problems and -despite<br />
the legions of naysayers in the press and among some<br />
elements of the business community, we Australians have<br />
good reason to be very confident about the future and<br />
equally good reason to be proud of how far in recent<br />
years we have come.<br />
Yet I think the best evidence I can produce today is this<br />
project itself. 1199 </p>
<p>3<br />
For it is in many ways a model of the change which is<br />
occurring around Australia now and which will secure our<br />
future. It is a model for its vision and for its execution. The<br />
vision is of Australian food exports to Asia. The<br />
execution is through cooperation and World Best Practice.<br />
The redevelopment of the Ulverstone Factory has been<br />
assisted by both the Commonwealth and the State<br />
government. The Commonwealth provided $ 620,000 to assist training and<br />
re-training of employees and a best practice program.<br />
State Government support has included assistance with<br />
acquiring the site and a workplace reform program.<br />
This was useful strategic help, but the driving force, of<br />
course, has come from a company with sufficient faith and<br />
vision not to say resources to invest $ 30 million in<br />
making the plant the most modern and efficient in the<br />
world. The project has required a shared vision a shared<br />
belief. It has required the company and the unions to come to<br />
fundamental agreement.<br />
The Company signed the Agri-Food Council Memorandum of<br />
Understanding on workplace reform and introduced<br />
innovative workplace agreements which among other<br />
things allow the plant to stay open 24 hours a day,<br />
seven days a week, processing 220,000 tonnes of potatoes<br />
a year.<br />
I understand the next step along the road to securing<br />
significant export market in Asia is to increase the<br />
supply of potatoes at a competitive price.<br />
When Simon Crean and I were in Mackay in March this year<br />
launching Labor's rural policy statement, we said that we<br />
would be introducing a world best practi. ce scheme for<br />
farmers.<br />
With the allocation of $ 11.2 million in the Budget we<br />
have now delivered on that election commitment.<br />
The world best practice program will1 help get the<br />
linkages between production and processing working more<br />
efficiently. Because we do not expect growers to carry the burden of<br />
this alone, we will be making grants available to_<br />
industries seeking to improve these linkages acrcss the<br />
whole of the rural sector. </p>
<p>Today I am pleased to announce that the first proj~ ct to<br />
be supported under that program will be a farm best<br />
practice program for vegetable growers in Tasmania.<br />
As I said, Tasmania is very often in the lead.<br />
Due to the initiative of the Agri-Food Council and, in<br />
particular, the Minister, Simon Crean, Tasmanian potato<br />
growers and processors are going to work together in a<br />
three year program of farm best practice with the aim of<br />
lowering production costs and increasing yields by at<br />
least 20 per cent.<br />
The program wili involve a joint investment of about<br />
$ 800,000 over the next three years, with contributions<br />
from both the Conunonwealth and State governments and from<br />
processors. It is a very practical operation: by working in small<br />
discussion groups, farmers will identify the obstacles to<br />
higher yields on a paddock by paddock basis.<br />
This is a good program for the industry and for Tasmania.<br />
It is a good project for Tasmanian farmers.<br />
But more than that it is a good model for the way we in<br />
Australia can and must work to guarantee the nation's<br />
economic future to create jobs and to realise our<br />
potential as never before.<br />
It is a model because it is inclusive, cooperative,<br />
clever it speaks of the recognition that in the markets<br />
of Asia lies so much of our future prosperity and so many<br />
of our jobs.<br />
But the people I want to congratulate today are the<br />
people who made this plant possible and who are<br />
continuing to work towards its success.<br />
The management, the staff and the growers whose vision,<br />
belief and energy are giving Ulverstone a great new<br />
future and playing their part in doing the same for their<br />
country. 1201 </p>
