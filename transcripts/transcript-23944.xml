    <content><![CDATA[<p>Benjamin Roberts-Smith VC MG will be the new Chair of the National Australia Day Council.</p>
<p>He is Australiaâs most highly decorated soldier, awarded Australiaâs highest military honour for bravery in wartime, the Victoria Cross, and the Medal for Gallantry, for his service during the war in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Since his retirement from the Army, Ben has continued to serve his community, including as Deputy Chair of the Prime Ministerâs Advisory Council on Veteransâ Mental Health.</p>
<p>This is a fitting way for Ben to continue his exemplary service to the nation. As Chair of the National Australia Council, he will help to inspire national pride and lead the communityâs celebrations of Australia Day.</p>
<p>He follows another outstanding Australian, cricket legend Mr Adam Gilchrist AM. I thank Adam for his service over the last six years. Adam successfully led the National Australia Day Council, encouraging all Australians to reflect on the meaning of Australia Day and being Australian.</p>
