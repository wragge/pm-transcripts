<p>PM: Itâs great to be back in the Blue Mountains with our terrific local candidate Susan Templeman.</p>
<p>Susan Templeman is a first-class local candidate, and I've been up here with her before â how long ago was that?</p>
<p>TEMPLEMAN: October last year.</p>
<p>PM: October last year, and neither of us has aged a bit since then.</p>
<p>TEMPLEMAN: Not at all!</p>
<p>PM: But she is extraordinary, 22 years a local, dedicated to this community, and itâs a community to which the Australian Labor government has delivered a lot.</p>
<p>I've just been through some of the things that we've done here. In the schools of this area, 35 primary schools I think in the federal electorate of Macquarie, and we have injected more than $55 million into new libraries, new multipurpose facilities, new classrooms and the rest.</p>
<p>Then when you look at TAFE and trades, and I saw a guy before, heâs an electrician, they're always looking for people coming through. We have built in this area four new trades training centres.</p>
<p>And this is terrific, servicing â the Penrith Valley trades training, McCarthy College trade training, and when I was up here last time, I went up to St Columbaâs School and met some of the kids who are using some of those facilities.</p>
<p>But on top of that thereâs a whole bunch of folk up here who are now making use of more university places.</p>
<p>Did you know this? Since we were elected five or six years ago, there are now 190,000 more Australian kids at universities than there were before.</p>
<p>Because we took a policy decision which said if you are able, on merit to get into university, Australia should give you a place to be in university.</p>
<p>And as a result of that, 190,000 more young Australians are now at university who werenât there only five or six years ago. I think thatâs a great Labor achievement.</p>
<p>So whether itâs schools, or whether itâs trades training centres, or whether itâs universities, weâre out there making a difference for peoplesâ lives, and thatâs why weâve got to continue the work weâve set out to do.</p>
<p>And one of the areas weâre going to continue to set out that work is through our new national Better Schools Plan.</p>
<p>And that is for better futures for our kids. And this is a very large investment into the future of our schools. Itâs needs-based funding, it lifts the standards of our teachers.</p>
<p>It also ensures that weâre offering quality curriculum to our kids because we want every kid to make the most of their lives and then give back as much as they can to Australia.</p>
<p>One final thing about our local candidate here. She has a whole lot of guts and determination.</p>
<p>She is out there in the community working hard, and what Iâd say to all you good local people is when you get to the next election, I want Susan Templeman as the next Member for Macquarie.</p>
<p>TEMPLEMAN: This is a fabulous community and weâre really honoured that the Prime Minister has come here on his first weekend as PM in this term.</p>
<p>So we welcome him, a big cheer to welcome Kevin! And we look forward to having you back many more times.</p>
<p>PM: I will be. Now does anyone else have a question for me.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Do we have an election date yet?</p>
<p>PM: Consistent with Australiaâs Constitution, we will determine that based on all the necessary criteria and weâll act according to the Constitution.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the government of Australia continues and I'm the Prime Minister of that government, and weâve got more things to do.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Will you raise the prospect of Tony Abbott starting a war with Indonesia when you meet with President Yudhoyono?</p>
<p>PM: What I said, very simply, was this. Mr Abbott has to answer two questions. He says that he will send the boats back to Indonesia.</p>
<p>Number one question, what will he do when a boat sinks? Number two, what will he do if he pushes a boat back, and the Indonesian naval forces push it back in our direction, because their policy is they will not take boats back?</p>
<p>These are two questions for Mr Abbott to answer, and I just say if he doesnât answer those two questions, heâs not fair dinkum about his policy.</p>
<p>Remember, this bloke is saying that â heâs already written his victory speech, heâs said to everyone that â he says heâs going to be Prime Minister in several monthsâ time.</p>
<p>Well on top of that heâs got a very basic question to ask about this policy.</p>
<p>Number one, what happens if a boat sinks, and number two, what happens if the Indonesians push the boat back?</p>
<p>He hasnât answered either of those things, so either itâs a fair dinkum policy, or itâs simply codswallop to try and win some votes.</p>
<p>Next question.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Do you regret those comments?</p>
<p>PM: I stand by everything I said, including the fact that my responsibility as Prime Minister is to ensure we have a first-class relationship with 250 million people in Indonesia, a country which constitutes our most important neighbour.</p>
<p>Any others before I go?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: How buoyed are you by the poll?</p>
<p>PM: Well I think weâre doing okay but weâve got a long, long way to go, and having said that folks, weâve got to zip because I've got to head back into Sydney.</p>
<p>Thanks folks.</p>
