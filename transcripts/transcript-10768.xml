<p>JRNLST:</p>
<p>You've offered to fund a High Court challenge against the Wik</p>
<p> plan. Will this stop the critics, do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well this is the circuit breaker that can see this matter resolved</p>
<p> in an honourable way.</p>
<p>What we're saying is, let the court decide. The Senate should</p>
<p> pass the bill. If it is challenged, as I am sure it will be, then</p>
<p> the Government will fund that challenge and moreover, we will approach</p>
<p> the High Court in the normal way and ask the Court to expedite its</p>
<p> hearing.</p>
<p>Now this is the honourable way out and I do hope earnestly that Mr</p>
<p> Beazley seizes the moment and says yes, this is a way in which the</p>
<p> court can resolve the matter because much of the Labor Party's</p>
<p> criticism of our legislation has been on the basis that it might be</p>
<p> unconstitutional and we are prepared of course to allow that to be</p>
<p> determined and we will ask that it be determined as quickly as possible.</p>
<p> The Australian people want this matter resolved. This is the honourable</p>
<p> way of resolving it. I now say to Mr Beazley, you should seize this</p>
<p> opportunity to have this matter honourably resolved.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
