<p>E&amp;OE................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the two business surveys today suggesting confidence is on the way up. Do you see that as a sign the economy is recovering from the GST downturn?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there was only ever a very temporary interruption with strong growth, largely in one sector, that was the housing sector, and we are recovering from that interruption and I'm optimistic, very optimistic indeed about future growth. Many people think Australia's economy will grow more strongly next year than the economy of any industrialised nation in the world. But I'm very confident and this is another survey which demonstrates how wrong it was of Mr Beazley and Mr Crean to talk the Australian economy down.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How much weight can you put on these two surveys today? Is it a long term guarantee?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't just rely on surveys. I rely on actuality and the clear signs are that growth is coming back, employment is still strong, people are investing, interest rates are low, inflation is low, people have got confidence. And these surveys are consistent with that confidence and they go in the face of the doomsday talk of the Labor Party.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you're ahead in Aston. Time to pop the champagne cork yet?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. I don't claim victory until all votes are counted. There are still several thousand votes to come and although the lead is greater now than it was yesterday I won't breathe easily until every last vote has been counted so I'm not claiming victory yet.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How much confidence do the current trends give you though?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'd rather be whatever it is, 480 to 500 ahead than 480 to 500 behind. But look it's not over yet and I'm simply not prepared to make any premature claims. But I hope Chris Pearce makes it. He'll be a terrific member if he does.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard do you support Grant Tambling [inaudible]?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's an organisational matter but I can say this, that he's a very good parliamentary secretary and he's worked hard for the Territory as a Senator.</p>
