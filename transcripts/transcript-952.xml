PRAISE FOR DRIVE TO HELP HANDICAPPED<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister he R. H n. obert Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, has sent a<br />
special message commending the ona-week " Employ the Handicapped"<br />
campaign which starts today.<br />
The Prime Minister said<br />
" in a rapidly developing country like , ustralia<br />
with a need to use all its manpower, it is particularly<br />
shortsighted to pass over tens of thousands of pLysically<br />
handicapped men and ioraen who could, if given an opportunity,<br />
make a definite contribution to the welfare of the<br />
community. Charity does not enter tiie picture when I speak<br />
of employing the handicapped. Thousands of handicapped<br />
Australians prove daily that without special privileges<br />
they can hold full-time jobs.<br />
Last year the Commonwealth Employment Service<br />
found jobs for 10,300 physically handicapped people, while<br />
from 19+ 8 to 1964 the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service<br />
prepared for full-time employment more than 17,000 allegedly<br />
' hopeless invalids'<br />
The comm unity gained many millions of pounds<br />
eamnnpuloaylmlyen tt', h rorautghhe rp lathcainn g ketehpesineg Autisetmra loina npse nisnio ngsa infrfouml the<br />
public purse. Yet there remain at least 300 000 Australians<br />
who still receive repatriation or social service benefits<br />
for disabilities. Of these some 125,000 suffer permanent<br />
disabilities and are regarded as unemployable for life.<br />
I reject this view. I am convinced that we cannot<br />
afford to waste the abilities of our citizens simply because<br />
they are not physically perfect.<br />
This week the Junior Chambers of Comnierce will<br />
promote the employment of physically handicapped Australians<br />
through their ' Employ the -Handicapped' campaign. I commend<br />
this contribution to economic welfare and social progress."<br />
