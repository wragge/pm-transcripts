FOR PRESS 17 JUNE 1979<br />
THE WEST AUSTRALIAN STRIKE<br />
Australia faces the possibility of a national strike towards the<br />
end of this week and of bans being placed on Western Australia<br />
that would isolate it from the rest of this country.<br />
Whatever the issue, that degree of destruction,. of damange and of<br />
harm to the nation cannot be justified.<br />
I ask all trade unionists and their leaders in the trade union<br />
movement, to think very carefully before they participate in a<br />
national stoppage before they participate in wider bans which<br />
could damage their own industries, their own livelihood, their<br />
own families and the national economy.<br />
We need to understand that Sir Charles Court has said that the<br />
p'rvisions of his'own Police Act will be reviewed.<br />
We rne-aed to understand that while the case will come before a<br />
court next Thursday it is unlikely to be finally dealt with on<br />
that daie. If the normal course of events is followed, a decision<br />
in the case will be deferred for some time. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
We should also have in mind that there is a certainty of debate<br />
on this issue in the West Australian Parliament, when it resumes<br />
towjards the end of July.<br />
I am aware that the West Australian Government is reviewing<br />
its industrial laws. It may well be reviewing the adequacy<br />
of the protections needed for its tribunals against disruption.<br />
The West Australian Government may wish to consider the<br />
Commonwealth Government's experience in this area.<br />
Against that total background, a national dispute and the<br />
possibility of bans against Western Australia become all the<br />
harder to justify.<br />
I am certain that a great majority of Australian working men<br />
and women do not want disruption, difficulty and conflict.<br />
The price they pay in wages lost is very great indeed and in<br />
many disputes wages lost are never regained.<br />
Australia is'mving forwards s'trongly in ec6nomic recovery..<br />
i is the task of all of us to build on that, to strengthen<br />
this nation, to increase our productivity, to cxport mrore., to<br />
take a pride in ourselves, and in-what we do, so that we can<br />
overcome our problems and difficul. ties. / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
The Au tralian economy at the present time is delicately<br />
balanced. Great economic progress has been made and the<br />
economy is moving forward. But that is something we all<br />
need to work on. It can so easily be destroyed by industrial.<br />
disruption, by harmful and damaging disputes. It is in all<br />
our interests to put conflict and disputation aside. This<br />
is a time when we need to think of Australia first, to make<br />
quite sure that our actions contribute to the well-being<br />
of this country, and to make sure that they do not damage it.<br />
In addition, I ask all trade unionists to keep in balance the<br />
nature of the dispute and the potential consequences of great<br />
ha'_ to the whole nation.<br />
Processes of the law have still to be followed. We don't know<br />
what the result of those processes will be. We need to weigh<br />
the enormous harm to Australia as the result of a national<br />
dispute, or as the result of bans placed on trade and commerce<br />
and communication with Western Australia, against the<br />
nature of the dispute itself, and its origins.<br />
Aga-inst the background of the review of its laws promised by<br />
the West Australian Government, I ask everyone to put aside<br />
disruption and to stand back and examine the issues quietly<br />
and thoughtfully. That is the way we can advance Austra. ia.<br />
