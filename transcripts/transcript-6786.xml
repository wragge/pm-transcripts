FOR MIEDIA 18 NOVEMBER 1985<br />
The Federal Government has appointed Mr Jim Kirk, AO, as Chairman<br />
of the Australian Bicentennial Authority.<br />
Mr Kirk will take up his appointment immediately.<br />
; rhe Government is delighted that Mr Kirk has agreed to accept the<br />
position.<br />
. Mr Kirk brings to the Authority a wealth of experience in the<br />
business community both in Australia and overseas. Mr Kirk, the<br />
former Chairman and Chief Executive of Esso Australia Ltd, is a<br />
leading Australian who has had a long and distinguished career in<br />
the development of the Australian oil industry.<br />
The Minister Assisting on Bicentennial matters, Mr Cohen, and I<br />
look forward to a close and rewarding relationship with the new<br />
Chairman. Mr Kirk will, in the near future, be considering the appointment<br />
of a new Chief Executive of the Australian Bicentennial<br />
Authority. I have discussed Mr Kirk's appointment with the Leader of the<br />
Opposition, Mr Howard, and he has given his full support to the<br />
decision.<br />
All Australians can look forward with confidentce'to the future<br />
and to the development of a program of diverse celebrations to be<br />
enjoyed by everyone in the community in 1988.<br />
I would also like to express the Government's appreciation to<br />
Mr John Utz, AO, for the valuable contribution he made to the<br />
Authority during his period as interim Chairman. </p>
