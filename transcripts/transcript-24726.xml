    <content><![CDATA[<p>Ever since becoming a Member of Parliament, I have tried to get out of the office so that people can tell me about their lives and about the issues they face.</p>
<p>So, this week, I will be visiting Indigenous communities in the Torres Strait and on the tip of Cape York.</p>
<p>It will be the first visit by a Prime Minister to this region in 18 years.</p>
<p>I will be visiting some areas that no Prime Minister has ever been to and on this trip Iâll be joined by Ministers and by senior officials.</p>
<p>Before the last election, I promised to spend a week every year absorbed in the real life of Indigenous communities because I want to see for myself the challenges facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.</p>
<p>I know that every community is different.</p>
<p>But the foundations of success are the same: itâs getting kids to school, adults into work, and making communities safe.</p>
<p>That is where we must focus if we are to make meaningful progress.</p>
<p>We are a great country but we wonât be everything we can be until Indigenous people are participating fully in our national life.</p>
<p>So I do look forward to spending this week in the Torres Strait and the tip of Cape York and to working with Indigenous people on the practical things; the practical things that we can do to help improve their lives.</p>
