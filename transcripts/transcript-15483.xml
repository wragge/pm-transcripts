    <content><![CDATA[<p>It gives me great pleasure to offer my congratulations to the Matildas on reaching the quarter finals of the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup in China.</p>
<p>To reach the final eight in the biggest women's soccer tournament in the world is a significant achievement and shows the increasing quality and competitiveness of Australian soccer on the world stage.</p>
<p>Following their win against Ghana and a draw against group favourites Norway, the Matildas were magnificent in scoring a late goal to secure a draw against Canada.  They demonstrated the grit and determination that Australians admire in their sportsmen and women. </p>
<p>Soccer in Australia continues to grow in popularity.  The performance of the Matildas in this World Cup will only build on this growth.  </p>
<p>The Australian Government is determined to ensure that our national teams have a strong base from which to go forward.  Our recent decision to provide $16 million to Football Federation Australia builds on our earlier support and will not only assist our national teams but will help to consolidate and further grow this great game in Australia.</p>
<p>I join with all Australians in wishing the Matildas all the very best for their next game against Brazil.  </p>
