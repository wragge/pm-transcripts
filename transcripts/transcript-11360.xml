<p>Well, thank you very much Mr Stewart for those very kind words of</p>
<p> introduction. To my ministerial and parliamentary colleagues, your</p>
<p> Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>It is my pleasure again to address this annual dinner and I hope in</p>
<p> so doing demonstrate in a small way the commitment of the Government</p>
<p> to the resource sector. I must say tonight that I did have a conflict</p>
<p> of interest because as often happens to Prime Ministers and to many</p>
<p> of us in this room we receive competing invitations for the evening.</p>
<p> And I have to say to you that I passed up the opportunity of the Australian</p>
<p> premiere of Star Wars tonight to attend this dinner. But I</p>
<p> am nonetheless delighted to be amongst you and to share a few thoughts</p>
<p> with you not only about the Government's attitude towards your industry</p>
<p> but also the vision we have for the future economic strength and the</p>
<p> economic competitiveness of the Australian nation.</p>
<p>This dinner, of course, takes place on the evening of a day in which</p>
<p> we have for the eighth quarter in a row recorded a year on year growth</p>
<p> rate of more than four per cent. And for the first time in Australia's</p>
<p> economic history I understand we have recorded the sixth consecutive</p>
<p> quarter in which the growth rate has been more than one per cent.</p>
<p> And one does have to go back to the late 1960s a period of which,</p>
<p> of course, which saw some very frenetic activity in the mining industry</p>
<p> to find a period when the general economic growth of the Australian</p>
<p> nation was as robust as it is today.</p>
<p>But I think the growth of today and the growth in this era which Dr</p>
<p> Ross Garnaut, an economic adviser to one of my predecessor's Bob Hawke</p>
<p> whose presence I acknowledge here tonight, I think the economic growth</p>
<p> of the current period which Ross Garnaut said recently at a conference</p>
<p> in Melbourne perhaps represented the third great era of Australian</p>
<p> economic growth since federation.</p>
<p>I think there are some characteristics and some features of the growth</p>
<p> we are now enjoying which make it even stronger and more potentially</p>
<p> durable than that of the late 1960s. It is coming off most importantly</p>
<p> a period of sustained economic reform. It is also occurring in circumstances</p>
<p> where we have reason to believe that we may have come much further</p>
<p> in breaking down that great challenge which has bedevilled the Australian</p>
<p> economy for so long and that is to remove the speed limits on growth.</p>
<p> Because as you rightly said in your introduction, Mr President, the</p>
<p> aim of sustained economic growth is to reduce unemployment to generate</p>
<p> more jobs because of the social contribution that development will</p>
<p> make. And it is true that economic policy and social policy complement</p>
<p> each other.</p>
<p>Economic achievement is not an end in itself, it is a means to producing</p>
<p> a happier, more stable and more cohesive Australian community. The</p>
<p> economic strength of today importantly, as I have said on a number</p>
<p> of occasions and I repeat tonight, is not accidental, it is the product</p>
<p> of economic reform undertaken in preceding years. And just as today's</p>
<p> strength and today's general prosperity is a product of yesterday's</p>
<p> reforms so it is that tomorrow's strength and tomorrow's wealth will</p>
<p> be the product of today's reform. And naturally into that context</p>
<p> I say that if we are to secure a continuation of the growth that we</p>
<p> enjoy today, if we are in five years at an equivalent dinner to be</p>
<p> able to look at a still very strong and stridently growing Australian</p>
<p> economy we will need, as the Chairman exhorted us to do, we will need</p>
<p> today to embrace further fundamental reform.</p>
<p>And that is why the Government has persisted so long and so hard and</p>
<p> so tenaciously in the area of taxation reform. We have needed to reform</p>
<p> the Australian Taxation System for the last 20 or 30 years and every</p>
<p> serious player on the Australian political scene, Labor, Liberal or</p>
<p> indeed any other party has in his or her heart and mind recognised</p>
<p> that reality. And that is why we took taxation reform to the people</p>
<p> at the last election. It is why we persisted in negotiating with the</p>
<p> Australian Democrats when it became apparent that the totality of</p>
<p> our package would not be passed by the Australian Senate. And that</p>
<p> is why I was very pleased to say that a package that delivered 85</p>
<p> per cent of what we put to the Australian people was a huge reform</p>
<p> and a huge improvement on the existing taxation system. Amongst other</p>
<p> things the plans that will, I believe, pass the Australian Parliament</p>
<p> in a few weeks will significantly reduce the cost of Australian exports.</p>
<p> The package will also provide additional benefits through reduced</p>
<p> cost of fuel both on rail, off road and elsewhere of enormous benefit</p>
<p> to the mining industry of Australia.</p>
<p>But importantly the changes will also inject a great deal of additional</p>
<p> incentive into the activities of 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers.</p>
<p> And we should remind ourselves at a dinner of this kind that 80 per</p>
<p> cent of our fellow Australians earn less than $50,000 a year and therefore</p>
<p> if we are to reach out and touch them with reforms that we make we</p>
<p> must bear that statistic in mind.</p>
<p>These reforms will produce the biggest single reduction in the input</p>
<p> costs of business of any reform ever carried out to Australia's taxation</p>
<p> system. The reforms will also fundamentally restructure the architecture</p>
<p> of the Commonwealth/State financial covenant. Something that has needed</p>
<p> reform and change and this also has been recognised on both sides</p>
<p> of politics for a very long period of time. We as a Government are</p>
<p> very committed to serious economic debate and serious economic reform.</p>
<p> We believe that governments are elected to change things for the better.</p>
<p> We believe that on occasions governments are elected to take risks</p>
<p> for the long-term national interests and for the long-term benefit</p>
<p> of the Australian economy. We put down a comprehensive plan, we believe</p>
<p> it to be the best plan on offer for Australia's future. If there is</p>
<p> an alternative plan for the reform of the Australian taxation system</p>
<p> then we'd be happy to have a look at it and to debate it. But it certainly</p>
<p> won't be found inside cans of soup or bags of lettuce.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it is not only in the area of taxation reform</p>
<p> but it's also in a number of other very important areas where I believe</p>
<p> the reform agenda has worked very successfully and very effectively</p>
<p> for the national interest. I am very proud of the industrial relations</p>
<p> changes that the Coalition Government has carried out. And I know</p>
<p> that those changes have been very widely applauded in your industry.</p>
<p> Of the many policy debates that I have been involved in over the years</p>
<p> none have I indulged more vigorously and more enthusiastically than</p>
<p> the cause of industrial relations reform. And I believe over the years</p>
<p> the community has begun to see the value of a less centralised industrial</p>
<p> relations system. An industrial relations system that encourages the</p>
<p> making of bargains at an enterprise level. An industrial relations</p>
<p> system of that kind is particularly well suited for large sections</p>
<p> of your industry.</p>
<p>I am also, I think, appropriately noting the importance for the economy</p>
<p> generally and also for your industry of the changes to the Australian</p>
<p> waterfront that were hard fought, were heavily criticised but persisted</p>
<p> in to his very great credit by my Minister, Peter Reith. And those</p>
<p> changes over time will render very significant economic benefits to</p>
<p> the Australian community.</p>
<p>Can I say to you, Mr Chairman, that I do understand that despite the</p>
<p> general strength of the Australian economy and despite the fact that</p>
<p> in generic terms the Australian economy is stronger than it has been</p>
<p> for more than 30 years, I do understand the particular challenges</p>
<p> of your industry. I do understand the depressed state of world commodity</p>
<p> prices. I understand the fierce competition in which your industry</p>
<p> operates. I also understand the ongoing significance and importance</p>
<p> of your industry to wealth generation in this country. And although</p>
<p> it is properly part of the economic goals and objectives of the Government</p>
<p> that I lead that we embrace the importance of new industries, that</p>
<p> we understand the employment contribution that information technology</p>
<p> industries, for example, can make, we will never as a Government lose</p>
<p> sight of the importance to the Australian economy of your industry.</p>
<p>We will never lose sight of the steady contribution that the various</p>
<p> sectors of the minerals industry make to annual wealth generation.</p>
<p> Without your contribution to the export income of this nation we would</p>
<p> not be able to sustain the high standard of living that most Australians</p>
<p> enjoy. And I hope you might agree that in the time that we have been</p>
<p> in Government we have pursued a policy of a very strong commitment</p>
<p> indeed to exploration and generally to the development of the mining</p>
<p> industry. We have thrown away such things as the very outmoded and</p>
<p> foolish three mine uranium policy that we inherited in 1996. We have</p>
<p> continued to propound the view that it is possible to have a vigorous</p>
<p> mining industry which properly cares for and respects the environment</p>
<p> of this country, that it is possible to strike a balance between your</p>
<p> industry and the environment. And I do applaud the willingness of</p>
<p> so many of your members to discharge the social obligations that you</p>
<p> have not only to our environment but also as your Chairman mentioned</p>
<p> the position of the indigenous people of our country. And it is a</p>
<p> fact that some of the best examples of the willingness of Australians</p>
<p> to help the indigenous people of this country are to be found in the</p>
<p> mining industry. And I only wish that some of the good news stories</p>
<p> that can be found in relation to the activity of your members, I only</p>
<p> wish that those good news stories were more widely propounded and</p>
<p> circulated throughout the Australian community.</p>
<p>So can I say to you, Mr Chairman, and ladies and gentlemen, that it</p>
<p> is again a great pleasure to be amongst you. I understand very well</p>
<p> the relative difficulties through which your industry is passing at</p>
<p> the present time. I understand that over the past few years you have</p>
<p> had to grapple not only with depressed commodity prices you have also</p>
<p> had to battle with the uncertainty created by the native title legislation.</p>
<p> That after a very long period of negotiation which directly involved</p>
<p> the leadership of your industry I hope that we have achieved certainly</p>
<p> at a Commonwealth level although much still remains to be done at</p>
<p> a State level, I hope we have enjoyed and brought about and achieved</p>
<p> an arrangement and an understanding that will provide a lasting basis</p>
<p> for a sensible balancing of the rights of development of industry</p>
<p> both mining and pastoral, the environment and the indigenous people.</p>
<p>You are quintessentially risk takers, entrepreneurs and wealth generators.</p>
<p> No country can achieve durable economic strength without having a</p>
<p> large number of its citizens who are prepared to embrace and indulge</p>
<p> those pursuits. On behalf of the Government I thank your industry</p>
<p> for the contribution that it makes to the wealth of our country, to</p>
<p> the strength of our country. The contribution it makes to its exports,</p>
<p> the jobs of the Australians that it provides and I can assure you</p>
<p> that the Coalition will remain a firm and understanding and committed</p>
<p> friend of your industry and will continue to understand and be sympathetic</p>
<p> to your difficulties. Thank you.</p>
