COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. W. McMAHON, M. P.<br />
Prime Ministers<br />
ON<br />
Report of the Commonwealth Administrative<br />
Review Committee<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
i[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 14 October 1971]<br />
Mr McMAHON ( Lowe-Prime Minister)<br />
( 1 1.30)--For the information of honourable<br />
members I present the report of<br />
the Commonwealth Administrative Review<br />
Committee. The Committee was composed<br />
of a group of eminent Australian lawyers.<br />
It was charged with recommending to the<br />
Government the procedures by which<br />
administrative decisions could be reviewed<br />
either in law or on their merits. The members<br />
of the Committee were: Mr Justice<br />
Kerr, a member of the Commonwealth<br />
Industrial Court, as Chairman; Mr Justice<br />
Mason, who was farst appointed to the<br />
Committee in his capacity at the time as<br />
the Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth<br />
and who continued lo be a member of<br />
the Committee following his appointment<br />
in 1969 as a Judge of Appeal of the<br />
Supreme Court of New South Wales; Mr<br />
R. J. Ellicott, who joined the Committee<br />
on his appointment as Solicitor-<br />
General of the Commonwealth on 15th May<br />
1969; and Professor J. Whitmore, presently<br />
Dean of the Faculty of Law in -the Australian<br />
National University and an acknowledged<br />
authority on administrative law.<br />
The report is a valuable contribution to<br />
Australian study of the subject of<br />
administrative review. It reflects the considerable<br />
expertise and industry which the members of the Committee brought to their<br />
task. A glance at the chapter headings of the<br />
report will serve to indicate the breadth<br />
of the Committee's consideration of the<br />
matters referred to it. The report canvasses<br />
the problems associated with the review<br />
of administrative decisions. Against the<br />
background of experience in some overseas<br />
countries, it discusses the efficacy of<br />
traditional means of redress of grievances,<br />
including by representations by members<br />
of the Parliament. It notes the steps taken<br />
by -the Parliament itself in particular<br />
statutes -to provide for review of the decisions<br />
of administrative tribunals. It examines<br />
the adequacy of the traditional review<br />
procedures through the courts by the prerogative<br />
writs of mandamus, prohibition<br />
and certiorari. The Committee has concluded<br />
that a Commonwealth administrative<br />
court should be established to provide a<br />
means for judicial review of the decisions<br />
of Commonwealth Ministers, officials and<br />
administrative bodies. The jurisdiction of<br />
the court would be limited to judicial<br />
review on legal grounds. Alongside the<br />
court would be established an administrative<br />
review tribunal. The tribunal wou~ d,<br />
in appropriate cases, review on the merits<br />
the exercise of administrative discretions<br />
under Commonwealth statutes and reguladons. </p>
<p>In addition, the report outlines a proposal<br />
for an administrative review council. The<br />
council would be charged with supervising<br />
the procedures of administrative tribuals,<br />
and with making recommendations as to the<br />
administrative discretions to be reviewed on<br />
their merits by the tribunal. The tribunal<br />
would be assisted by a general counsel for<br />
grievances and a small research staff. The<br />
general counsel for grievances would be a<br />
member of the council and have a right of<br />
audience before both the Commonwealth<br />
administrative court and the administrative<br />
review tribunal. It can be seen that the<br />
Committee has produced a report wh.*' zh<br />
sets out in an informed and elegant fashion<br />
a comprehensive structure for administrative<br />
review. Even from this summary honourable<br />
members will appreciate that the report will<br />
require considerable study. We have decided<br />
to make it available at this stage in order<br />
to promote informed and considered discussion<br />
in the Parliament and in public,<br />
academic and professional circles.<br />
The Government has not had an<br />
opportunity to consider the report in detail.<br />
But we have decided that immediate action<br />
on 2 fronts is appropriate. A group of 3<br />
people will be appointed to examine existing<br />
administrative discretions under Commonwealth<br />
statutes and regulations and to advise<br />
the Government as to those in respect of<br />
which it considers a review on the merits<br />
should be provided. This study of needs will<br />
proceed immediately, and ahead of any<br />
decisions about further aspects of the<br />
report. We intend that the group to study<br />
and make recommendations on the review<br />
of administrative discretions under statute<br />
and regulations will be constituted at a high<br />
level. It will include perhaps one member<br />
of the Committee whose report is now<br />
being tabled, a very senior and experienced<br />
public servant or ex-public servant and<br />
perhaps one other with wide experience in<br />
the legal, political or administrative fields.<br />
In the light of the recommendations from<br />
the group and of responses from those<br />
interested in the report now tabled, the<br />
Government will be able to determine in<br />
detail what additional arrangements for<br />
administrative review may be necessary.<br />
In addition, the Government has decided<br />
to ask the Attorney-General ( Senator<br />
Greenwood) to institute a review of the<br />
prerogative writ procedures available in the courts. We accept the comment of the<br />
Committee that the legal grounds on which<br />
remedies can at present be obtained are<br />
limited and often complicated. The<br />
Attorney-General's review of remedies available<br />
in the courts will take place concurrently<br />
with the study I have mentioned<br />
of the existing range of administrative<br />
discretions under statute or regulation. This<br />
review should also lead to recommendations<br />
which the Government will consider. The<br />
Government believes that these two<br />
immediate decisions relating to the report<br />
of the Commonwealth Administrativie<br />
review committee will be taken as a<br />
tangible demonstration of the significance it<br />
attaches to the protection of the rights of<br />
individuals at a time when governments<br />
exercise extensive powers on their behalf.<br />
I think it appropriate to add at this stage<br />
2 comments. The first is that this report<br />
should be of particular concern to members<br />
of the Parliament. They themselves have a<br />
significant role in the review and criticism<br />
of the administrative processes. It is important<br />
that their own role be regarded as<br />
central and that any steps taken in response<br />
to the report should have this in mind. My<br />
second comment relates to the possibility<br />
of these reforms causing delays in the<br />
administrative process. The Government,<br />
and the Commonwealth Service, are often<br />
criticised for delays that occur in administration.<br />
In large part, these are due to the<br />
need for co-ordination and for clearance to<br />
ensure that all aspects of any particular<br />
matter are fully considered. It must be<br />
recognised that any substantial extension of<br />
institutions and procedures for the formal<br />
review of administrative action will in the<br />
nature of things add materially both to the<br />
time taken in the administrative process<br />
and to the costs it entails. I need not<br />
remind honourable members that speed and<br />
efficiency in the conduct of Government<br />
business are important both for the<br />
Government itself and for those who rely<br />
on decisions of the Government. I believe<br />
honourable members will welcome the<br />
report and the action the Government<br />
proposes to take. I commend the report to<br />
the House for consideration. I present the<br />
following paper:<br />
