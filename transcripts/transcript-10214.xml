23 January 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
DOORSTOP YOUNG AUSTRALIAN OF THE YEAR AWARDS<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE CANBERRA<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Well what do you think this says for Aboriginal people in Australia? Nova talked<br />
about being an inspiration for her people and for white Australians as well.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think she's an inspiration to all'young Australians. She displayed qualities of tenacity<br />
and perseverance, I congratulate her. It was a very competitive field and the most<br />
impressive thing of all to me was the vast array of talent amongst young Australian<br />
achievers in so many walks of life, not just the sporting fields and the swimming pools<br />
but also in the laboratories, in small business, caring for the environment, people<br />
overcoming massive physical disabilities. It really was very cheering and an occasion<br />
full of great hope and I congratulate her immensely on a great award and I think it will<br />
be a great source of encouragement and pride not only to Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander people but also to all young Australians. Thank you.<br />
