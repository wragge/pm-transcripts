Following is the ' ext of a 1. etter which I wrote<br />
on 3rd Au~ gust to the Honourable SiLr Thomas P" Layford,<br />
Premier of South Australia 9 on the subject of standardization<br />
of the raiiigay betwMeen Port Pirie and Broken Hill<br />
" Dear Sir Thomas, In your letter of 2nd April, 1 962 you invited<br />
the Commonwealthi to consi. der approlving under the<br />
Railway S4tan'qardizatien Agreement of-1949,-a programme_<br />
of conversion to standard gauge of the permanent way<br />
betwie,-n Port Pirie and iBroken Hill. You estimated<br />
that tis o~ rogrammeq including ncoiling stock, would<br />
costl-some f-17 million or Å“-20 milIlion, and suggested<br />
that the expenditure be spread ov er several years,<br />
This is quite a sizable project, and th-ougha<br />
we dr) o of course ac-cept the desirability of a standard<br />
gauge line frcom Fort Pixie to Broken Hill, we have had<br />
to measure the finsncisl commitment in-v olvd against<br />
our gen~ eral. budgetary position present and prospective,<br />
and against our1 other commitm-ants in respect-of major<br />
works projects in the States, par-ticularly in the<br />
field of rail ty. ansporbt, Here we have feltE we had to<br />
pay special attention, in present circumstances, to<br />
improvements in rail facilities whicha will permit a<br />
significant increase in eyport earnings or a major<br />
development of national resouirces.<br />
My Cabinet colleagues and I have considered<br />
closely, inj theD light of' these circumstances, your<br />
request that th" e Commoniwealtn should provi4de the<br />
finance to cnrry out the conversion to standard. gauge<br />
of the permanent -way in, -the Petorborough Division,<br />
But we do not see our w., ay to corhmit funds at present<br />
for this projectQ, W-e are faced with a very large<br />
deficit in the cu-r-rent year, and must tUake account of<br />
this and of othter inescapablo demands on ou,) r taxation<br />
and other revenue. i in this and thle coming two or three<br />
years'But you will of couirse appreciate that our<br />
present decision does not imp+. ly any definitivo rejection<br />
of the Port Pirie-Broken Hll conve,, rsion work,, We<br />
do intenOd to look again a~ t your present pr'oposal as<br />
and when work en other railway projects to Whi! ch we<br />
are financially commnit, 1ted i-s furvthier Ladvance-+ d..<br />
Mearw hi le xwe-share with yKou the hoeand<br />
belief thlat your acceptance of cur offer of finance<br />
up to -Li ,25,000 for thea piirch-, ase of diesel engines and<br />
oro wagons and their use on this route will not only<br />
reduce the cost of transporctation in this area, but<br />
will also benefit the, Scutht J! hUstLriian Railway,, s and the<br />
pooplo Of Your State0 Yourvs sincerely,<br />
