Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai have today signed a long-term partnership between Australia and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>This Comprehensive Long-Term Partnership is a clear demonstration of Australia's long-term commitment to supporting Afghanistan's security, development and governance following transition.  </p>
<p>The Partnership was signed by Prime Minister Gillard and President Karzai at a bilateral meeting in Chicago today.</p>
<p>Under the Partnership, Australia will</p>
<p> * 	Work with Afghanistan to combat transnational threats such as terrorism, narcotics and people smuggling;<br />
 * 	Support Afghanistan's security after 2014;<br />
 * 	Support Afghanistan's development, including through an increased aid program;<br />
 * 	Encourage business and investment links;<br />
 * 	Cooperate on migration issues; and<br />
 * 	Foster people-to-people links and help preserve Afghanistan's cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Through the Partnership, Australia will also work with the Government of Afghanistan to build the capacity of government and national institutions to promote and protect human rights.</p>
<p>A Joint Commission will be established to review implementation of the Partnership and to provide a forum for regular dialogue on issues of shared strategic interest.</p>
<p>The Partnership will give confidence to the people of Afghanistan that Australia will stand side by side with Afghanistan beyond the end of transition in 2014.</p>
<p>The nature of Australia's engagement in Afghanistan will change after transition, but Australia's commitment to Afghanistan's stability and development will endure.  </p>
