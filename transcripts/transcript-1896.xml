FOR PRESS: P. K No. 68/ 1968O<br />
DEATH OF SIR NEIL O'SULLIVAN<br />
Tribute by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
I was deeply saddened to learn of the death today of my<br />
old friend and colleague, Sir Neil O'Sullivan, I recall with warmth my<br />
association with him in the Senate where he served as Government Leader<br />
for nine years. He demonstrated ability and energy during his sixteen<br />
years as a Senator, and will be remembered with affection for his long<br />
and distinguished service to Australia.<br />
He was a strong peirsonality and one of the most popular<br />
men in the Parliament. His death will be a great loss to his family and his large<br />
circle of friends. I extend deep sympathy to Lady O'Sullivan and her two<br />
sons. A State funeral will be held in Brisbane.<br />
