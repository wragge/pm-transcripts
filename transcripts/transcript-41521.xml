    <content><![CDATA[<p>I have agreed to extend the reporting date for the Religious Freedom Review to 18 May, 2018. This follows a written request by the Expert Panel, chaired by the Hon. Philip Ruddock.</p>
<p>The response from individuals and organisations has been unprecedented â€“ with more than 16,000 public submissions received. In light of the volume of submissions, I have agreed to this extension to ensure that the Panel has adequate time to carefully consider the issues raised.</p>
<p>While it was anticipated that the original deadline of 31 March would be met, the number of submissions has made this impossible.</p>
<p>I would like to thank the Expert Panel for its work. I look forward to receiving the final report by 18 May, 2018.</p>
