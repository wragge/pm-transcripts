<p>Well, thank you very much, Dr Calvert, to Jackie Kelly, Senator Faulkner,</p>
<p> Mr Michael Knight, the Chairman of SOCOG, Phil Coles, Brett Chivers,</p>
<p> other very distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>It is a particular pleasure for me to be here today to announce and</p>
<p> launch the Oceania leg of the Olympic torch for the Games of the year</p>
<p> 2000. As you all know, next to the Olympic rings, the Olympic torch</p>
<p> is the most evocative and noticeable and memorable of all of the Olympic</p>
<p> symbols.</p>
<p>In the modern era of the Olympics the flame was first used during</p>
<p> the Los Angeles Games in 1932. And in May 2000 the great tradition</p>
<p> will be continued when a flame will be kindled by the rays of the</p>
<p> sun at a special ceremony in Olympia in Greece and will be carried</p>
<p> by as many means of transport as possible through the world and ending</p>
<p> at the opening of the Games in Sydney in the year 2000. And importantly,</p>
<p> for the purposes of today's gathering, on the way to Sydney the</p>
<p> torch will visit the Olympic nations of Oceania. And the staging of</p>
<p> the Oceania leg of the relay is a massive undertaking involving the</p>
<p> co-operation of the Commonwealth, SOCOG and the national Olympic committees</p>
<p> of each of the participating nations.</p>
<p>At the South Pacific Forum in Rarotonga on the 17th of</p>
<p> September last year I announced that the Australian Government would</p>
<p> fully underwrite the cost of carrying the torch through the Pacific</p>
<p> island nations. And this recognised that the Olympic Games of 2000</p>
<p> would not only be an Australia-wide event but would also be an event</p>
<p> for the Oceania region. And just as we want the torch relay in Australia</p>
<p> to touch the broadest cross-section of the Australian community and</p>
<p> the Australian experience, so too do we want to showcase the lives</p>
<p> of our near neighbours of the region and help reveal to the world</p>
<p> a little more the rich history and culture of the Oceania region and</p>
<p> its people.</p>
<p>Sport is central to the lives of Australians and also to the lives</p>
<p> of people who live in the Oceania region. And the inclusion of the</p>
<p> nations of the region in the torch relay is a particular recognition</p>
<p> of this.</p>
<p>The torch will travel through many nations in the region with which</p>
<p> Australia has a strong history of sporting links. And they include</p>
<p> Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Samoa and the Solomon Islands. And Australia's</p>
<p> links with many parts of the region of course extend beyond sport.</p>
<p> There are links anchored in history, in war, in geography and which</p>
<p> are sustained today by the many people-to-people links.</p>
<p>In Papua New Guinea celebrations will include an opportunity for community</p>
<p> involvement by the people of Kokoda near Port Moresby. And I am particularly</p>
<p> pleased that the route will take the torch to Ower's Corner on</p>
<p> the Kokoda Trail itself.</p>
<p>The Oceania leg finishes in New Zealand with which of course we have</p>
<p> long-standing and very vigorous sporting as well as trade, cultural</p>
<p> and personal ties. The extension of the torch relay to the Oceania</p>
<p> region gives a much greater number of people the chance to have contact</p>
<p> with the Games of 2000.</p>
<p>Another of the great opportunities and challenges of hosting the Olympic</p>
<p> Games is the attention it brings to the host nation or to the host</p>
<p> region. And each nation in our region will have a special opportunity</p>
<p> to provide a particular insight to the lives of their people.</p>
<p>The torch relay and, of course, the Olympic Games themselves provide</p>
<p> a great lead into the Centenary of Federation celebrations in the</p>
<p> year 2001 as the relay itself will visit some of the places where</p>
<p> the foundation stones of the Australian federation were laid. Corowa,</p>
<p> Bathurst and Tenterfield are just some of the places where major events</p>
<p> occurred as part of the monumental march towards the federation of</p>
<p> the then Australian colonies into the nation of Australia.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Games of 2000 in Sydney will certainly be</p>
<p> a great event for all Australians. As someone who completed his leaving</p>
<p> certificate in 1956 at the same time as the staging of the first Olympic</p>
<p> Games in Australia in Melbourne in that particular year, I have special</p>
<p> memories of that year and I can remember the excitement that existed</p>
<p> throughout our country when the torch arrived and as the people competing</p>
<p> in the Games gathered.</p>
<p>Sydney will do Australia proud. I have no doubt that the Games in</p>
<p> Sydney in the year 2000 will be an outstanding success. I have no</p>
<p> doubt that the Games will be an opportunity for the great strengths</p>
<p> and the great qualities of the Australian way of life to be showcased</p>
<p> to the world. I have no doubt that all Australians in the lead up</p>
<p> to the Games will come together in a united, concerted effort to ensure</p>
<p> the success of the Games and to tell the world what a wonderful country</p>
<p> we are, to remind the world of our remarkable achievements of tolerance</p>
<p> and progress and liberty. And, importantly, they will also be an opportunity</p>
<p> to tell the world of the diversity and the vibrance of the region</p>
<p> in which Australia lives and of the very deep commitment that Australia</p>
<p> has to the welfare of the nations of the Oceania region. It therefore</p>
<p> gives me very great pleasure to launch the Oceania route of the Olympic</p>
<p> torch relay.</p>
