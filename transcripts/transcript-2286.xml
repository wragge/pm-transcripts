FCR PRESS: 91 1970<br />
INAUGURATION OF TOURIST DEVELOPMENT WEEEK<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorto-<br />
I welcome the opportunity of inaugurating Australia's firot TouriLt<br />
Development Week, and I congratulate the Tourist Ministers' Council oselecting<br />
' Keep Australia Beautiful' as the theme for the first such weeck.<br />
A concerted effort by all States and Territories to draw attenticn to<br />
pollution, and the despoiling of our environment, is one of the most ; ractical<br />
ways in whichTourist Ministers can protect and promote Australia's growing<br />
touri t industry. No one, and least of all our overseas visitors, wants to see polluted<br />
beaches and rivers or littered roadsides and parks. We promote Australia<br />
abroad as a fresh open country of blue skies and clean beaches. These are<br />
great natural advantages. The time to preserve them is now, when the cost,<br />
though high, is manageable.<br />
I hope that the range of activities planned for Tourist Development<br />
Week will help to bring home to every citizen that keeping Australia beautiful<br />
is a community responsibility. It a widespread and sustained commu-nity spirit<br />
of this kind can be generated it will not only malke our towns and cities n-much<br />
more pleasant places, but at the same time will do much to assist the development<br />
of one of Australia's most important industries.<br />
On the inauguration of this first Tourist Development Week, I want to<br />
join with all the States and Territories in making a special appeal to all<br />
Australians to involve themselves personally in the theme ' Keep Australia<br />
Beautiful'. CANBERRA<br />
