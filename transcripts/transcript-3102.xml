FRItMARY I14DUSTRY<br />
RURAL POLICY<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr E. G. Whitlam, and the Minister for<br />
Primary Industry, Senator K. S. Wriedt, today announced the Australian<br />
Government's decision to hold an inquiry into all aspects of rural<br />
policy in Australia. The inquiry will be conducted by a working<br />
group consisting of:<br />
Sir John Crawford, formerly Secretary of the Department<br />
of Trade and Director of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics;<br />
Dr S. F. Harris, Deputy Secretary, Department of Overseas Trade<br />
and formerly Director of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics;<br />
Prof. F. H. Gruen, Consultant to the Prime Minister's Department<br />
and Professor of Economics at the Australian National University;<br />
Mr N. D. Honan, Director, Bureau of Agricultural Economics.<br />
Dr Harris will be convenor for the group.<br />
Sir John Crawford's membership is on the basis that he will<br />
give what help to the group that his earlier commitments will allow.<br />
His unmatched qualities and background in the field of rural policy<br />
will however be available to the group.<br />
The working group will be able to draw on the resources<br />
-of the Departmtent of Primary Industry, the Bureau of Agricultural<br />
Economics, Department of Overseas Trade, the Bureau of Census and<br />
Statistics and other Government offices during its examination. The<br />
Group will welcome submissions from farm organisations, other interested<br />
bodies and the public. Submissions should be directed through the<br />
Secretary, Department of Primary Industry.<br />
In making the announcement, Senator Wriedt and the Prime<br />
Minister emphasised that the decision to call for an inquiry was<br />
based on two major considerations. First, there was not place in the<br />
economy for a rural policy that was not both equitable for primary </p>
<p>-2-<br />
producers and economically sound. Second, there has been no<br />
Government sponsored report on overall rural policy since the<br />
publication of " Agricultural Production: Aims and Policies" by the<br />
former Department of Commerce and Agriculture in 1952, over 20 years<br />
ago. The present Government wishes to avoid ad hoc decisions<br />
that might appear to some to be politically attractive at the time,<br />
but which in fact might offer no long term security or real benefits<br />
to the genuine primary producer. The Government needed a basis of<br />
expert advice on which to formulate economically sound and socially<br />
equitable measures that would help the resident farm family.<br />
It also saw a need for a rural policy that recognised<br />
that large and important sections of the rural community are not<br />
themselves engaged in farming although the prosperity of many did<br />
depend on the health of the primary industries.<br />
The working group would draft, for consideration by the<br />
Government, a " Green Paper" on Rural Policy, incorporating aspescts<br />
from present Australian Government policies such as selective<br />
decentralisation, conservation, rural reconstruction and long-term<br />
international commodity agreements. It would also attempt to integrate<br />
these and other factors into a set of principles upon which future<br />
policies could be built.<br />
It is anticipated that the Green Paper will be published<br />
by Government authority but without formal approval. In that form,<br />
it would be debated in Cabinet, in Parliament, and in the community<br />
generally particularly in the rural sector. These debates will<br />
assist the Australian Government to create a more viable rural<br />
sector in the Australian economy.<br />
The Australian Government anticipates receiving the working<br />
group's report by April 1974.<br />
