AUS8T RA1IA . L<br />
FOR MEDIA 18 July 1983<br />
I have today received the attached letter from the<br />
Attorney-General. </p>
<p>SENATOR THE HON. GARETBi EVANS ATTORNEY-GENERAL<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
CANBERRA A. CT. 2600<br />
18 July 2.983 GE: BP<br />
The Hon Hawke, AC, MP,<br />
Prime Minister,<br />
Parliament House,<br />
Canberra ACT 2600<br />
Dear Prime Minister,<br />
I refer to your request to me last Thursday, 14 July 1983,<br />
for my opinion as to whether the conversation on the<br />
evening of 21 April 1983 of the then Special Minister of<br />
State with Mr E. J. Walsh may have involved an offence<br />
under the Crimes Act 1914, that question having been<br />
raised with you last Thursday morning by counsel appearing<br />
for the Commonwealth before the Hope Royal Commission.<br />
On the evidence available to me at this stage, the<br />
possibility cannot be excluded that Mr Young contravened<br />
sub-section 79( 3) of the Crimes Act ( attached). I do not<br />
believe that, as the expression " Commonwealth officer" now<br />
appears in the Act, sub-section 70( 1) has any application<br />
to the situation, and no other provision in the Crimes Act<br />
appears relevant.<br />
However, the evidence available to me at this stage<br />
consists only of Mr Young's statement to you on 14 July<br />
and the statement attributed to Mr Walsh in the weekend<br />
media ( both referred to in Mr McHugh QC's statement to the<br />
Hope Royal Commission today) together with my own direct<br />
knowledge of the circumstances of the ministerial meetings<br />
on 20-21 April. It is impossible for me to give any<br />
concluded opinion as to whether criminal proceedings could<br />
lie in this matter until more information as to the<br />
detailed content of Mr Young's conversation with Mr Walsh<br />
has come to light. For all practical purposes, that will<br />
not occur until the relevant witnesses have given their<br />
testimony before the Royal Commission.<br />
If, after further evidence is to hand, I should conclude<br />
that criminal proceedings could lie, a further question<br />
will arise, as it always does in criminal proceedings, as<br />
to whether, in the light of Provable facts and the whole<br />
of the surrounding circumstances, the public interest<br />
requires that the prosecution should be instituted. I<br />
shall have regard in this respect to the guidelines tabled<br />
in the Parliament in December 1982, Prosecution Policy of<br />
the Commonwealth, by the Hon. Neil Brown QC on behalf of<br />
the then Attorney-General, Senator Peter Durack QC. </p>
<p>I add that the Second Law officer, the Solicitor-General<br />
Sir Maurice Byers QC, has at my request joined me in the<br />
examination of this matter, and he concurs in the views<br />
expressed above.<br />
GARETH EVANS </p>
<p>CRIMES ACT 1914, SUB-SECTIO11 79( 3)<br />
79.( 3) If a person communicates prescribed information,<br />
to a person, other thana<br />
person to whom he is authorized to<br />
communicate it; or<br />
a person to whom it is, in the interest of<br />
the Commonwealth or a part of the Queen's<br />
domninions, his dutyv to communicate it,<br />
or permits a person, other than a person referred to in<br />
paragraph or to have access to it, he shall be<br />
guilty of an offence.<br />
Penalty: Imprisonment for two years.<br />
" Prescribed information" is defined in sub-section 79<br />
which reads, in relevant part, as follows:<br />
79. For the purposes of this section information is<br />
prescribed information in relation to a person, if the<br />
person has it in his possession or control and<br />
he has made or obtained it owing to his<br />
position as a person<br />
( ii) who holdis . office under the Queen;<br />
and by reason of its nature or the<br />
circumstances under which it was made or<br />
obtained by him or for any other reason, it is<br />
his duty to treat it as secret. </p>
