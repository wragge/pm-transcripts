NATIONAL JROADCAST fO. 4<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. HAROLD HOLT<br />
Much has been said in this election campaign about<br />
Australia's security. You know there is a wide gulf of<br />
difference uetween the policies of the Government on defence<br />
and those of the Opposition. Mr. Calwell leads a Party which<br />
so reduced Australia's defence expenditure in the post-war<br />
years that its last Budget that of 1949/ 50 provided only<br />
1,116 million for our total defence bill. The vote for defence<br />
had been slashed year by year from 1945/ 46 onwards.<br />
Our Budget provision this year is $ 1,000 million,<br />
six times that of the last year of Labor rule. We don't<br />
regard even this substantial expenditure as making Australia<br />
self-sufficient in defence nor has that been our intention.<br />
We have known we would have little scope for other desirable<br />
objectives if the Defence bill were to go too high. Ve have<br />
wished to maintain a vigorous development policy while, at the<br />
same time, acting to keep the nation secure.<br />
' e have strengthened Australia's security by joining<br />
under the SEATO and ANZUS Treaties with allies who have the<br />
same determination to resist communist aggression as ourselves.<br />
In recent years geography and circumstance have made<br />
Australia part of the Asian scene. Our trade with Asia has<br />
grown rapidly. It now takes more than 30 per cent of our<br />
exports against half that percentage a few years ago. Our<br />
exports to Asia in 1958/ 59 were $ 368 million. In 1965/ 66<br />
they were 8856 million.<br />
Ve signed a trade treaty with Japan in 1957 this<br />
treaty incidentally was strongly opposed by the Labor Party<br />
in the Parliament. In the followin-year we exported $ 204<br />
million worth of goods to that country. This had risen to<br />
471 million in 1965/ 66.<br />
Australia has joined in the group of nine Asian and<br />
South Pacific countries known as ASPIC, formed to further<br />
each other's interests. We rank among the largest contributors<br />
to the capital of the Asian Development Bank.<br />
Recently I led the Australian delegation to the<br />
Conference in anila of the seven nations who have joined<br />
in resisting Communist aggression in South Vietnam. This<br />
historic meeting was not a council of war, it was a council<br />
for peace and freedom. It devoted itself to ways and means<br />
of achieving a just and enduring settlement of the conflict<br />
in embattled Vietnam. 7e adopted Joals of Freedom expressed<br />
in the following terms:-<br />
" WIe the seven nations gathered in Manila,<br />
declare our unity, our resolve and our purpose<br />
in seeking together the goals of freedom in<br />
Vietnam and in the Asian and Pacific areas.<br />
They are:<br />
1. To be free from aggression.<br />
2. To conquer hunger, illiteracy and disease. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
To build a region of security, order<br />
and progress.<br />
4. To seek reconciliation and peace<br />
throughout Asia and the Pacific."<br />
These are our goals. They are the goals of peacemakers,<br />
not warmongers, and those who Yathered in Manila<br />
with us are the allies that the Labor Party proposes we<br />
should walk out on.<br />
I believe Australia has an important contribution<br />
to make to the security and prosperity of the free countries<br />
of Asia. W" e have great benefits to gain from our friendly<br />
trade and association with them.<br />
We would destroy that bright prospect, perhaps beyond<br />
repair if Australia was to follow the course recommended to<br />
us by the Australian Labor Party.<br />
( This talk will be broadcast by the A. B. C. National<br />
Network at 7.15 p. m. Friday, 18th November, 1966) </p>
