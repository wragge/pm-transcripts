PRIME MINISTER' S SPEECH AT THE SANDGA'TE BOWLING CLUB,<br />
BRISBANE, 3 OCTOBER 1975<br />
Well, ladies and gentlemen, it was some months<br />
ago that Denis Murphy wrote to me and said will you<br />
launch my book on T. J. Ryan? I want to make that plain<br />
from the outset because this visit was arranged a long<br />
time ago in principle;, the date wasn't necessarily<br />
set Some people will be cynical enough to think<br />
that I mnight1--be here f or some political purpose. I resent<br />
that sort of insinuation( interjection: he's not here<br />
tonight). I'm very glad to be here at the Sandgate Bowls<br />
Club because I've never been on this side of the lagoon.<br />
I would have lost count of all the times I've been'right<br />
round it and looked across, and at last I've made it.<br />
And I thank the presidents very much for. being so gracious<br />
to me, but to all of you. These are excellent premises,<br />
and I can compliment you on the way you look after your<br />
members and guests. Thank you very much indeed.<br />
Now, I've been with Denis Murphy with various<br />
audiences over the last few years at the Homestead the<br />
only time, I want to make it plain to you I ever. go<br />
to the Homestead is to make speeches; I wouldn't go for<br />
any other purpose. On this occasion, of course, it's<br />
entirely a social and literary occasion. I love<br />
li * terary lunches and academic dinners. So naturally<br />
I brought along, I got leave to come f rom Fred Daly,<br />
because we've been in Parliament for over 22 years now,<br />
next month I think it'll be 23 years in my case<br />
but it's 31 years in his he's the father of the<br />
Parliament and he treats us all as wayward children.<br />
Those on our side, of course,. we instinctively love himari-<br />
d those on the other side do as they're told. It has<br />
warm--. ed my heart to see the way you've responded when his<br />
nat:-e was mentioned anybody that can equal Clem and<br />
Sylvia Jones in applause is doing pretty well.<br />
I'm here tonight not to support Denis Murphy<br />
as a candidate,. and he has been an outstanding candidate,<br />
but to support him as an author. I regard him as one of<br />
the finest young men in Australia. He qualified himself<br />
to be a university lecturer by his own efforts he didn't<br />
have a silver spoon, as they say, or whatever it is<br />
and in Queensland you need a pretty long spoon. But he<br />
qualified himself in a very competitive field and I<br />
don't know where he finds the time to conduct so many other<br />
activities. He' s written several books; they are excellent<br />
books. The Department of History in the University of<br />
Queensland is outstanding in Australia because of its<br />
concern with Australian history. You know, whenI used to<br />
go to university, people would be a bit inclined to say that<br />
Australian history wasn't really a subject that you could<br />
learn at university. But the University of Queensland has<br />
disproved that. Arind there's another field where I think the<br />
University of * Queensland Press is outstanding.' More than<br />
any other publisher in Australia it publishes Australian<br />
verse. Now we have some good history here and we write<br />
some good verse. We have very good politicians in the<br />
British de-mocratic tradition. I mean from time to time, I'm not </p>
<p>saying that they're all..<br />
But of course: I always remember the good times, I talk<br />
about the best. And there have beenL soine very good ones.<br />
And also the verse, and the literat[_ ure we produce in<br />
Australia is equal to any produced anywhere in the<br />
English-speaking world. We ought to be pleased.<br />
I am very happy to be at the launching of another<br />
publication of the University of Queensland Press.<br />
You'll notice that I'm using ' press'; I'm praising the<br />
press in a very specialised sense.<br />
Now Denis Murphy has had a most interesting<br />
and admirable subject for this biography. Whatever they<br />
might say about the reception that the press in the wider<br />
sense gives the Australian Labor Party there's no<br />
question the way historians regard it,~ because everybody<br />
who writes about Australian politics this century,<br />
writes about it in the context of what the Labor Party<br />
has done or has aimed to do. If one looks to the past,<br />
everybody, whatever his politics, would acknowledge<br />
that the Labor party has been the creative and dynamic<br />
force in Australian public life. Now people don't<br />
necessarily believe it at any particular time they<br />
didn't believe it when it was happening in the past.<br />
But when it'S been achieved, when the, look back, they<br />
all say, that is., there is nothing when people look at<br />
Australian politics, which-: they identify with anti-Labor<br />
politicians, or anti-Labor Governments. It's all been<br />
in terms of what Labor politicians or Labor governments<br />
have done. One of the charming things, reading Ryan"<br />
is the way that in the second decade of this century all the<br />
things were said about his government and about himself,<br />
which are said by his successors today. All the terms<br />
of abuse were already being used disloyal, treacherous,<br />
treasonable, anti-monarch, and disloyal, everything like<br />
this. The only phrase of all the ont-s which are used<br />
about us now which was, which is with all the terms which<br />
are used about us now, were all used in T. J. Ryan's day.<br />
The only one that they used to use about him which we,<br />
never copped was the word ' bolshevik'. But otherwise the<br />
terms of abuse are precisely the same; it's most comforting<br />
Those were the days when in Queensland the Premiers , in stead<br />
of just standing off and hurling abuse , decided to go and<br />
get into the action themselves. And two of Queensland's<br />
Premiers-the ablest of them this century, Ryan and Theodore<br />
went into the House of Representatives. Ryan died at<br />
there is no question that if he'd lived a normal 20 years<br />
or even more that you would have expected him to have in<br />
Parliament he would have been Prime Minister of Australia.<br />
Now Theodore went in in a bad time, bad economic time,<br />
universal depression throughout the world. But everybody<br />
now acknowledges that Theodore was way ahead of his time;<br />
he was the only person who was a Chancellor or a Treasurer<br />
who read Keynes and all those people that were; I mean we've<br />
gone beyond Keynes now,. but he was* way ahead, the rigours of the<br />
depression would have been very much less if they'd been a<br />
few more people that had heeded Theodore, the former Premier of<br />
Queensland, who became Federal Treasurer. These were very great<br />
men, and of course, previously Griffith and so on in the last </p>
<p>century were very great men, Premiers of Queensland who<br />
went into Federal af fairs. GriffEith, of course, was a<br />
Minister and then in the High Court, t~ he first Chief<br />
Justice, and a very great one; great Premier, great<br />
literary man too, incidentally, and first Chief Justice.<br />
You've done some great things in this State, but you've<br />
done them in so far as you've identified with Australia<br />
as a whole. I've never believed that Queenslanders were<br />
different from the rest of Australia; where you're good<br />
it's because you're Australians too.<br />
And perhaps I might be forgiven if I made one<br />
particular illustration of what I mean there, because<br />
the week before last the arrangements had been made here<br />
in Brisbane, in the Administrative Offices -the Premier<br />
was there, and a few other Premiers, and I myself and<br />
somebody on behalf of the Opposition in the Federal<br />
Parliament -we were all there and we agreed that we would<br />
meet in Melbourne the week before last, you know last<br />
week; Wednesday, Thursday, Friday last week, Clem Jones,<br />
the Premier, the Leader of the Opposition all of us were<br />
to be down there. This was all arranged in June; it was<br />
to be a Constitutional Convention and suddenly, right at<br />
the end, it was decided up here that you wouldn't go,<br />
and the reason was because at the Constitutional Convention<br />
we were going to talk about local government, It was<br />
on the agenda, arnd it was on the agenda because when the<br />
Convention was first suggested back in 1972, there was a<br />
House of Representatives election imminent and we said<br />
that we would have a Convention but only on condition<br />
that local government was represented at it as well.<br />
Because these days it would be absurd to look at the<br />
Constitutional arrangements in Australia and think that<br />
they were matters solely for the Federal Government and the<br />
State Governments. There are many things that the local<br />
government bodies in Australia need to do; if they don't<br />
do them, or if they can't do them well enough, then our<br />
com. munity suffers. So we insisted that local government be<br />
on the agenda, that was decided at the Sydney Convention, of course,<br />
two years ago and it was again to be on the agenda for<br />
Melbourne last week. And because it was there , the Liberal<br />
Premiers and the Country Party Premier wouldn't go; they<br />
didn't want to be seen to vote against the interests of<br />
local government. But my Government believes that it is<br />
important that that sphere of government also be mentioned<br />
in the Constitution and that local government be given the<br />
wherewithall, be given the opportunity, to do the things<br />
that need to be done on a regional, or local or community basis.<br />
Well~ that's why they didn't turn up, at the Convention.<br />
But they were all gathered, the absentees, on the other<br />
side of the road; -they were all in-Melbourne. They gathered<br />
on the other side of the road and they issued a statement<br />
on federalism. The significance is that it was a statement<br />
on taxation and you in Queensland will realise the implications<br />
of that statement because the core of it is to abandon uniform<br />
taxation and to say that everywhere in Australia you will pay<br />
two lots of tax one lot of income tax to the Federal </p>
<p>Government, and the other lot of income tax Ito the<br />
State Government. ( Inter-jection: " Fraser's folly")<br />
Well, I appreciate the phraseology I said that<br />
everywhere in Australia you'd pay two lots of taxthat's<br />
rnotright, in Canberra they'll only pay one lot,<br />
they'll only be paying the Federal'tax, and they'll get<br />
out of the other tax entirely, and the reason for that<br />
is that the Federal Parliament can only impose taxes on<br />
condition that those taxes are equal throughout Australia.<br />
That is. the Federal Parliament couldn't pass a special<br />
tax for" Canberra to bring it up to what any of the<br />
other States were paying. So if you have two lots of<br />
income tax, the Federal one and the State one,-the<br />
people in Canberra will be overjoyed. When I retire<br />
I'll go to live there along, the road, admittedly, but<br />
it'd be a good place to retire, because I wouldn't have to<br />
pay that second tax. But I don't think the people will cop<br />
it because Queenslanders still will recall in many cases,<br />
and those Who don't remember it will easily find it out,<br />
and read about it, that in the days in Australia, that is<br />
until 1942, when there was Federal income tax, and also in<br />
every State a State income tax the taxes in Queensland<br />
were higher than in any other part~ of Australia, and it<br />
was because of that that so many people invested, and<br />
employed and went to live in the southern States. And<br />
Queensland's industries have never caught up because of<br />
that tax. Queensland being an extensive State, a State<br />
which has to have schools, and hospitals and other public<br />
services throughout this very large area, the second<br />
largest State in Australia -but only a third in populationthey<br />
had to pay more to get Government services for people<br />
anywhere where they lived in the State. By contrast<br />
in Victoria, a compact State, the smallest of the mainland<br />
States, the second largest in population of the<br />
Australian States, their tax was lowest, because you don't<br />
have to spread Government services over such a large area.<br />
There are many more people able to use every centre of<br />
Government service. So in those days, two taxes: Queenslanders<br />
paid the highest tax in Australia, and they had to do that,<br />
and even then couldn't get,... one must admit,-as good schools,<br />
for instance, as were provided in the other States. Now<br />
that is the core of this policy of federalism, bringing a<br />
double tax system, instead of a uniform tax system, and the<br />
comparison is made with Canada. Now I'm damn glad the<br />
comparison has been made, because it's very easy for people<br />
to see what the population of the Canadian provinces is, and<br />
what the tax rates in the Canadian provinces is. And<br />
the most populous, the most prosperous provinces in Canada.<br />
Ontario, British Colombia,... they pay, they charge the lowest<br />
provincial income tax; and the smallest, in population, or<br />
the-largest in area, the poorest of the States, you know to<br />
put it bluntlyof the provinces there, they pay the highest<br />
taxes. Now this is just the wrong way you'd want to have it.<br />
It ought to be possible for us as one nation to see that<br />
whatever a person does, wherever he lives, governments<br />
provide the things which governments have to provide of<br />
equal standard. If you go to a new place you shouldn't"<br />
have to wait until your family has grown up or has left<br />
the district before standards in that district become good enough. </p>
<p>If you live in a run-down area you shouldn't have to<br />
bear, unaided, the replenishment or the improvment, the<br />
replacement of the standards for the things which<br />
gJovernments -have to provide. It's important that as one<br />
nation we should see that wherever Australians live they<br />
are able to get as good schools, as good hospitals, or<br />
as good public services as Australians get anywhere else.<br />
' The only way to do that is to pool the resources of the<br />
nation and have themi spent where they are needed * most.<br />
Now, it's true enough, people say, say about the United<br />
States; there are State income taxes there; but you<br />
look at the United States. It's very eVenly developed.<br />
There are as many people on the Wiest coast in California<br />
as on the East coast in New York. There are as many<br />
people up in the north, say in Illinois, as there are<br />
down in the sou * th, such as in Texas. It's equally<br />
taxable, it's equally prosperous. There are patches<br />
which are much less prosperous but north and south, east<br />
and west, the place is very even. But you look in<br />
Australia, it's in the south-eastern part, the part say,<br />
Melbourne and Sydney, or if you like to stretch it,<br />
from Adelaide to Brisbane and the part down below that<br />
lineuduch is the prosperous part. The rest of Queensland<br />
or South Australia, or Western Australia or New South<br />
Wales is very much more expensive to run. Now the core<br />
of what the Liberals are putting to the people now should be<br />
seen~ by the people. And I don't believe they'll have a<br />
bar of it. I've always said~ when there was an election,<br />
or when one was in the offing, and the Liberals had to be<br />
precise, people would' see the catches. It's no use just<br />
abusing us because of unemployment, or inflation. Sure<br />
the-v'Ie bad; but there'Is no country in Europe or North<br />
Ainerica where they,, aren't just as bad. They're much worse<br />
than when we came in, but they're much worse in all those<br />
other countries than they were three years ago you can't<br />
bl-e us alone; you don't blame Nixon for that alone;.<br />
or Ford or Wilson or Schmidt or Pompidou or Giscard d'Estaingor<br />
Franco. It happens everywhere in the West, everywhere.<br />
And of course our opponents may parry by saying well we did<br />
it; things are crook, and every political party in opposition<br />
says it about the government in every country in the west,<br />
one has to admit that. If we were in opposition I think<br />
we'd be ' itaking out a very. good claim against the government.<br />
When you have to face the people there has to be an<br />
alternative put, and there can be no doubt that when they<br />
start in our O? position to specify-what they would do if they<br />
were given the chance you'll see the catch. And I don't<br />
believe that anybody in Queensland would want to go back to<br />
the stage of double ta * xation, because it's only the Liberal<br />
Party in Sydney and Melbourne that has sold this policy<br />
to the Federal leaders. You'll notice, Gordon Chalk, he's<br />
very unenthusiastic about it; so's Kevin Cairns -the first<br />
time I've ever mentioned him on a platform. But<br />
I don't propose to tal= k anything about platforms or policies.<br />
It's once they sta-rt being precise, you can see the catch.<br />
Then they were talkin-g about tax indexation a month ago.<br />
Hocw would you have ax indexation on State income taxes as well </p>
<p>as Federal income taxes; what could the Federal people<br />
do about tax indexation on the State income tax?<br />
Now some people say that there will be in a few weeks,<br />
a couple of months, an election. All I can say to you is<br />
that before the end of June next year there will be<br />
an election, at least, for half the Senate, there must<br />
be. Now the Senators who are there and were elected<br />
to go up to the end of next June, they will . be there until<br />
the end of next June; whenever there is an election for<br />
half the Senate the new Senators to replace them would not<br />
take office until the 1 July. But the interesting thing<br />
is that at the moment it is a flawed Senate, or as Jim Killen says,<br />
a tainted Senate. There are two people there; I don't<br />
know who owns them, but they don t belong to us. But<br />
they succeeded people who the people elected as members<br />
of the Labor Party. And let's remember, back at the last<br />
elections in May last year, not only was there a very<br />
large majority of voters for the Labor Party in the House<br />
of Representatives we've a comfortable majority there,<br />
but the Labor candidates for the Senate got more votes<br />
than did the candidates of the Liberal Party, the<br />
Country Party, the Liberal Movement, the-D. L. P. remember<br />
the all of them combined, every party combined,<br />
got fewer votes than we got in the Senate. But we haven't<br />
got a majority of members in it, and to get things through<br />
the Senate you have to get a majority. If the Senate<br />
is evenly divided the thing doesn't go through. Now in<br />
those circumstances, of course, it would be absurd for a<br />
Senate not to pass legislation we put up. Now some people<br />
say that the Senate will reject the Budget. Well if that<br />
took place) it would be very interesting to fight a<br />
campaign on what sort of Budget they would put instead.<br />
It's not the Senate's job to reject Budgets; they can't<br />
initiate money bills, the Constitution says so; they<br />
Scan't amend money bills, the Constitution says so.<br />
The Victorian Constitution says that the Upper House can<br />
reject money bills, the Australian Constitution doesn't<br />
use that word at all, so some of the comparisons made down<br />
there have no validity in our situation. Now, I musn't<br />
K speculate any further, because I don't,. you know, I want<br />
to catch people with their pants down. It's an attitude<br />
which appeals to people that boarded at the best schools.<br />
If there was an election on the grounds that the Senate had<br />
rejected the Budget. then the election would turn around what<br />
sort of Budget woil; the Senate have passed? What sort of<br />
Budget would the Liberals want? And that would be very<br />
intriguing to find out. Because I don't believe that it is<br />
possible in the circum. stances applying in Australia or in<br />
comparable countries today to bring down a better Budget<br />
than Queensland's Bill Hayden introduced. If I may draw<br />
a comparison, he's a person very much like Denis Murphy; a<br />
person who, without any inherited advantages, has qualified<br />
himself superbly for an important role in this community,<br />
and instead of just looking after his own selfish interests,<br />
looks after the community and serves it with might and main. </p>
