SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE MON P J KEATING MP<br />
AT THE PRESENITATION OF THE BRW-ALCATEL BUSINESS AWARDS<br />
PARK LANE HOTEL<br />
SYDNEY, 10 DECEMBER 1992<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I am very pleased to be able to join in celebrating the<br />
achievements of some of Australia's finest enterprises and<br />
entrepreneurs. So often we hear the doomsayers rattling around, the<br />
jeremiabs projecting their own pessimism and self-loathing<br />
on to the rest of the Country.<br />
it is good to be as I often ami among people who by their<br />
actions prove the opposite.<br />
To re-mint an old conservative phrase, there is a silent<br />
majority in Australia a silent majority of ders out<br />
there.<br />
Men and women who are going about the business of businesslooking<br />
for opportunities, changing where change is needed,<br />
adapting, developing and, in difficult times, succeeding.<br />
It is a pleasure to have the chance to congratulate them.<br />
We need their success. We need their example.<br />
in Australia it's always a tough audience.<br />
In sport, art and business it's the same the gloom<br />
merchants are perched there like crows with the words<br />
III told you Sol'-already formed in their mouths.<br />
it's the Hanrahan syndrome -the " we'll 811 be rooned"<br />
syndrome. But they are a minority. And, anyway, it's not so much in<br />
their natures as in their Interests to be pessimists.<br />

in fact, in my experience, the great majority of Australians<br />
are much more forgiving, much more realistic, and have much<br />
more faith in themselves and their country.<br />
And I think they have good reason to.<br />
In the past decade Australians have recognised the need for<br />
dramatic change, and they have had the imagination and the<br />
will to make it. They continue to.<br />
They have also recognised the need for continuity of<br />
decent values, of the bases of equity and fairness.<br />
That to me is proof of common sense, and the best possible<br />
assurance of the future of Australia.<br />
My typical Australian is a mixture of common sense and<br />
flair. The stoic and the bold.<br />
That seems to define most of our legendary figures from<br />
Ned Kelly to Allan Border.<br />
it might even define Bob Gottliebsen.<br />
it defines most of the successful business people I speak<br />
to.<br />
And, in all likelihood, it defines the people we are here to<br />
congratulate tonight.<br />
Being the people they are, of course, none of them will be<br />
resting on their laurels.<br />
There are many opportunities out there for innovative-. firms.<br />
many rewards to be had.<br />
And you can be sure that these rewards will be a11 the<br />
greater as the overall economy grows.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The recession has been deep and the recovery slower than we<br />
would have liked.<br />
We have not been helped by events overseas.<br />
We can take eome satisfaction from the fact that, at 2.1<br />
per cent in the year to September, we have one of the<br />
fastest-growth rates in the OECD.<br />
However, we all know that this is not fast enough to bring<br />
unemployment down.<br />
We must reduce unemployment. </p>
<p>T1EL0: . Dec. 92 17: 44 No. 043 P. 03/ 10<br />

We must do it to bring an and to the hardship which the<br />
unemployed are suffering.<br />
we must do it to restore to them the opportunities which<br />
Australia should offer.<br />
And we must do it because people are our most valuable<br />
resource. The health of our economy depends on reducing the number of<br />
unemployed. The only way is. faster growth.<br />
Growth of around 4 per cent or so will bring unempl~ oyment<br />
down. It is also quite achievable.<br />
Over the past year or so the Government has taken a number<br />
of steps to strengthen growth interest rates have been<br />
lowered substantially and there has been direct stimulus<br />
from the One Nation Statement, the Youth Statement and the<br />
Budget. These initiatives have clearly boosted demand and output.<br />
Lower interest rates have been central to the 12 per cent<br />
increase in dwelling investment over the past year.<br />
Public sector demand-has been running ahead of demand in the<br />
private sector, notwithstanding the contraction we have seen<br />
in some of the States' budgets.<br />
So the Government's strategy of providing stimulus is<br />
working. But recovery has been held back by a weak international<br />
economy and the low levels of business investment.<br />
It is important that we understand what has been depressing<br />
business investment, because that is the key to further<br />
economic expans ion.<br />
Fundamentally, it has been the result of the efforts of many<br />
corporations and financial enterprises to reduce debt levels<br />
and establish stronger balance sheets after the excesses of<br />
the late 1980s.<br />
This has been a necessary and very difficult process.<br />
The corporate sector embarked upon an exercise of cutting<br />
costs and reducing debt.<br />
TEL </p>
<p>T1E0L:. Dec. 92 17: 44 No. 043 P. 04/ 10<br />
4<br />
The banks tightened their lending guide-lines and have<br />
concentrated more on their traditional business.<br />
The result has been less business investment and, for those<br />
businesses which want to grow, more stringent tests to meet<br />
before they can get the necessary finance.<br />
Slower economic recovery has been the cost.<br />
The process of debt restructuring is continuing.<br />
But I think it is now clear that the major hurdles are<br />
behind us.<br />
The profit share has held up despite the recession, while<br />
lower interest rates have seen interest payments by the<br />
corporate sector almost halved over the past two years.<br />
As a result, the corporate sector has had the means to<br />
reduce their debt levels.<br />
In fact, corporate debt/ equity ratios have been falling for<br />
the past three years and, apart from a few notable<br />
exceptions, appear to be at relatively healthy levels<br />
overall. The receiverhip business has tailed off while banks' new<br />
non-performing loans have declined sharply.<br />
The total stock of these non-performing loans has recently<br />
begun to turn down.<br />
All these are significant signs of health being restored to<br />
corporate and financial sector balance sheets.<br />
Progress has been slow, but increasingly over the past few<br />
months, it appears that business is increasingly looking for<br />
new opportunities.<br />
I notice the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan<br />
Greenspan, noted similar developments in the United States<br />
recently. He said that " the credit crunch which has been so<br />
debilitating to economic performance over the past two or<br />
three years has shown no evidence of worsening in recent<br />
months and may finally be retreating. At least this is the<br />
implication of some stirring in'the loan markets in recent<br />
weeks", he said.<br />
And in Australia business confidence has been picking up,<br />
arnd the credit ag~ regatesi hae been growing again as new<br />
buslness has begun to outweigh repayments.<br />
TEL: </p>
<p>TEL: 10. Dec. 92 17: 44 No. 043 P. 05/ 1(<br />
Today's unemployment figures were again disappointing veryI<br />
disappointing but there are some grounds for believing<br />
that the pick-up in vacancies indicates the start of an<br />
improved labour market ahead.<br />
indeed, as the debt is reduced, businesses are increasingly<br />
focusing on the positive factors that are there<br />
the lowest inflation rates in the developed world<br />
low interest rates<br />
productivity up around 3 per cent over the past year<br />
good underlying profits levels that will improve further<br />
as volumies increase<br />
very favourable international competitiveness<br />
continued wage restraint<br />
and, one hopes, continued very low levels of industrial<br />
disputation.<br />
Coming on top of the stimulus from the public sector that<br />
will continue for some time, these factors give us good<br />
reason to expect the economic recovery to strengthen.<br />
Of course, growth in Australia will be constrained by the<br />
weak international environment we face, but we can look to<br />
the future with greater confidence.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
We can be more confident about the future, but at the same<br />
time we have to-learn from the past.<br />
A central lesson has been the desirability of banks<br />
establishing close relationships with their customers.<br />
Lending will always be less risky if the lender has a more<br />
complete understanding of the viability of a proposal.*<br />
Moreover, lending has to be based much more on an assessment<br />
of the likely cash flow of a proposition than on the<br />
availability of security.<br />
Financial -Institutions can no longer rely on property values<br />
underpinning loans if they ever could.<br />
The major banks assure me that they have recognised these<br />
needs and have shifted their 3. ending rules accordingly. </p>
<p>TEL: 10. Dec. 92 17: 44 No. 043 P. 06/ 10<br />
6<br />
They tell me they are providing extra training for lending<br />
officers so they are better able to evaluate risk and the<br />
potential of proposals.<br />
Cash flow lending, they say, will be the norm in the<br />
practice of Australian bank lending.<br />
And the banks will, I believe, more aggressively try to<br />
expand their lending under these more disciplined credit<br />
standards. Still, I believe we should go further with the development<br />
of relationship banking.<br />
It is the export of services and elaborately transformed<br />
manufactured goods that have grown so rapidly over the past<br />
years.<br />
These have relied on our strengths in innovation, research<br />
and training.<br />
A great many of the new, successful exporters are small to<br />
medium size firms who are out to establish niche markets<br />
especially export markets.<br />
our future depends on being able to build on these successes<br />
-and that means our future depends in no small way on our<br />
banks. As Australians increasingly develop innovative products and<br />
seek to sell them into new markets, banks will have to<br />
improve their skills and capacities of evaluation.<br />
it is obvious that evaluating the quality of new proposals<br />
will be a challenge.<br />
There is risk associated with new product lines which may<br />
take a number of years to come on stream.<br />
There is risk associated with developing new export markets.<br />
There is risk associated with lending to young firms that<br />
are growing with new ideas.<br />
But these are risks that banks will have to be able to<br />
assess. This is the future they simply must embrace.<br />
And it is where, after all, the rewards are going to be.<br />
Where returns are likely to be rewarding, they are risks<br />
they will have to undertake. </p>
<p>T1E0L:. Dec. 92 17: 44 No. 043 P. 07/ 10<br />
7<br />
It is not just in the interests of the overall economy that<br />
adequate finance should be forthcoming for worthwhile<br />
propositions. So long as they are able to properly assess the likely risk<br />
and return, it can also be very much in the interests of the<br />
institutions concerned.<br />
An important element in the success of the Japanese and<br />
German economies has been the very close relationship their<br />
banks have had with business.<br />
Of course the German and Japanese banking systemis have been<br />
more regulated than our own, and there are many features of<br />
their system we should not try to duplicate.<br />
But the ready access to finance for good projects which<br />
their businesses have is something we must work at getting<br />
here. Poorly appraised risk-taking is the last thing our lending<br />
institutions should engage in. My argument is that they<br />
must do more to develop their evaluation and monitoring<br />
skills.<br />
How this is done will be up to the institutions concerned.<br />
it may mean providing more finance for export business<br />
through regional centres, rather than through individual<br />
branches which tend to be the first port of call for many<br />
small and medium-sized businesses.<br />
it may involve developing clusters of skills in technology<br />
or engineering, or in providing management and financial<br />
advice for small businesses.<br />
From this, expertise in evaluating ventures in new areas<br />
could be established.<br />
of course, these ideas are not new banks have already<br />
taken some action along these lines.<br />
But through whatever means the individual institutions may<br />
choose, I believe it is very desirable for us to go further<br />
down this path.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
-Through the-Commonwealth* Development Bank the Government has<br />
played a direct role in trying to ensure that suitable<br />
finance is available to a dynamic sector of the economy that<br />
often has difficulty raising funds I mean the Wmall<br />
business sector. TEL </p>
<p>TEL: 10. Dec. 92 17: 44 No. 043 P. 08/ 10<br />
Over the years, the Commonwealth Development Bank has<br />
fulfilled a limited buit -very useful role supplying loans and<br />
some limited equity finance f or small business, including<br />
farmers. Because it is required to lend only to businesses who are<br />
unable to obtain sufficient finance through other channels,<br />
the CDB operates at the riskier end of the market.<br />
This means it attracts loan applications which it cannot<br />
approve. Nevertheless it still approves many projects which<br />
would not otherwise be financed.<br />
Although it made a 1088 in the more difficult Circumstances<br />
of 1991-92, it has recorded respectable rates of return down<br />
the years.<br />
It has done this despite its concentration on small risky<br />
loans that tend to involve high overheads.<br />
The reason for this relative success has been the COB's<br />
ability to establish expertise in evaluating and managing<br />
its loans, an expertise that is built on both a detailed<br />
knowledge of the sector itself and a close working<br />
relationship with the businesses concerned.<br />
So the Commonwealth Development Bank has performed that<br />
specialised role.<br />
But the CDB grew up in the more regulated system of the<br />
past. with the removal of interest ceilings, other banks have<br />
expanded further into small business and rural areas, and<br />
the CDB's lending has tended to be pushed further towards<br />
the realms of risk.<br />
It is important that the Development Bank is able to<br />
continue to fulfil its special role, and to do so in a<br />
manner that is consistent with the Commonwealth Bank making<br />
a commercial rate of return.<br />
Accordingly, the Board of the Commonwealth Bank is reviewing<br />
the operation of the CD5 and its special charter to ensure<br />
that it remains in a position to lend to the small business<br />
and rural sectors.<br />
This lending will continue to be based primarily on the<br />
interest irihecrelt-of' a proposal rather than the value of<br />
any security offered. </p>
<p>T1EL0:. Dec. 92 17: 44 No. 043 P. 09/ 10<br />

in addition, the Government is prepared to Consider with the<br />
Commonwealth Bank's Board whether there is a need for any<br />
financial support that may be required by -expanded lending<br />
opportunities. The CDB will always remain in a niche in the market, but a<br />
very important niche.<br />
I am confident that it will continue to fulfil its role and<br />
that it is well placed to grow.<br />
Indeed, I hope that Its characteristic reliance on<br />
soecialist skills and close involvement with its customers<br />
will be emulated by other financial institutions.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
our financial institutions must play 8 dynamic role as<br />
economic recovery strengthens.<br />
They will be a vital player as Australia continues to make<br />
inroads into world markets.<br />
Closer relationships between banks and their customers will<br />
help to ensure that Australian business can meet the<br />
challenges and grow.<br />
At the same time, it will help banks' profitability and<br />
ensure that the experience of the past few years is not<br />
repeated. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
i hardly need to say to you that I think Australia is on the<br />
right path. I<br />
We are now more outwardly oriented. we are more efficient.<br />
We are more flexible.<br />
We think in ways we never thought before about excellence,<br />
about exports, about Asia and the Pacific, about enterprise<br />
bargaining.<br />
We are exporting things we never dreamt of making a decade<br />
ago, and we're exporting them to places we never imagined<br />
could be markets.<br />
There has been an attitudinal change of profound dimensions<br />
kind of -cultural change which was absolutely essential<br />
to our success.<br />
we have generated, as I said, other essential preconditions<br />
like low inflation, and an acceptance among wage earners<br />
that profits need to be adequate.<br />
TEL: </p>
<p>TEL: 10. Dec. 92 17: 44 No. 043 P. 10/ l1<br />
We have made a number of the essential microeconomic reforms<br />
in telecommunications, aviation, the wharves.<br />
We will continue the process. Let no one imagine that<br />
because we have done these things we don't intend to do more<br />
or that more is not being done now.<br />
what we have achieved has not been easy.<br />
It is not easy to make structural changes and continue to<br />
hold the social fabric together.<br />
But in my view it is essential to do it that way.<br />
Not just because it is more decent though that is a<br />
sufficient condition but also because it is more<br />
efficient. The economic transformation of Australia is not a Sprint for<br />
speedy squibs: it needs stamina and we will get to the<br />
line quicker and in better shape if we maintain and build<br />
our momentum and hold body and soul together all the way.<br />
We have learned that economic change demands cultural<br />
change. It has social consequences.<br />
There are no ways around this. And there is no better way<br />
to go than by taking all sections of the community with us.<br />
We are now reforming the labour market on these principles<br />
of cooperation and mutual agreement on goals.<br />
The 550 enterprise agreements have been built on that<br />
cultural change I talked about.<br />
They are the tangible manifestation of new Australian<br />
attitudes and common goals.<br />
They are built on that sort of realistic faith in ourselves<br />
and each other, on that mixture of common sense and<br />
imagination I talked about earlier.<br />
it is on that, I am convinced, that we will build the<br />
recovery.<br />
And I daresay that is what the success of tonight's honoured<br />
guests was substantially built on.<br />
I congratulate you all.<br />
Thank you for having me. </p>
