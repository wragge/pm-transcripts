This has be-a tmofgreatecnmchrsi: fratle-<br />
From the boom conditions of 1973/ 74, prices in the cattleyards<br />
have fallen disastxously from 93 cents -per-kilogrrami in September;.<br />
1973 to as little as9 24 cents per kilogram ina January 1975. Since-J<br />
then, prices have improved marqinally but they-remain far below-therecord<br />
1973 prices.<br />
While prices have been depressed, farm costs ave risen dramnaticailly.-<br />
In each of the three Labor years, farm costa far -outstr ipped thegenexal'rise<br />
in the Consumer Price. Index. In 1974-75, farm costs<br />
rose over<br />
* Beef producers' nett proceeds have fallen alarmingly in money-terms..<br />
rM real terms the situation is even worse; and-beef producers have<br />
also -been hard bit by continuous industrial disruption 1 limited<br />
access to our most important overseas beef markets, a prolonged<br />
drop in export prices made worse by d-rought conditions ina the..<br />
United-States causing local stock to -flood United States markets,<br />
and by a. cattle suirplus in Australia creating low. prices. fbr<br />

rural. comamity-could not be healed-overnight.<br />
The Labor Government not only produced record inflation it<br />
directly.. attacked the rural communty Tfith the Coombs. Task Force<br />
report as their bible, they withdrew conczession. after concession-<br />
They-abolished tax concessions, abolished the superphospbate bountyand<br />
tried to reduce the wool reserve price by 50 cents a pound-,<br />
They-imposed new imposts suich as the 14eat Insp0ecdion Charge.<br />
They failed to give local government and rural roads the-financial<br />
support so clearly required&amp;'<br />
Labor's attitude was completely summed up by Mr.-Whitlam when be.,<br />

too o~ ten ignored, 6nd it-is time. that theF dif ficulties thatbeef.<br />
i'oroducers face are realistically-reoognised.__ ,/ many </p>
<p>2<br />
M'any people have recognised and been responsive~ to the problems<br />
of disadvantage i-n-cities, but all too often people have been<br />
unknowing and uncaring about the problems, the . disadvantaqes and<br />
financial dif ficulty that exist. in the. farming omuity.<br />
Since coming to office, we have acted to secure the long. term<br />
viability of our rural industries, to secure-their ability to<br />
play a significant. role in Australia's development.. We are<br />
determined to redtess the inequities. and the antd--ural bias and*<br />
distortion of Labor's policies-we are determined to make sutre.<br />
that t-here is an equitable shari-ag of the burdens -in the fight<br />
against inflation. In thi.-task, we have been greatly assisted<br />
by constant submissions and representation% from Libexal and<br />
NatioDal Count-ry-: Party hack-bencbers, -anfommaur't<br />
Orgntoss In-less than two-years we: have developed -a -comprehensive. and<br />
constructive programme of assistance-for the whole rural cOwinUity;.<br />
and specific assistance to, neet. the most urqent needs of induztries. fp~<br />
I would* like to talk-briefly about what has been done for the rural.<br />
conmnity as-, a whole. Our griaatest. contribution to rural' producers<br />
has been to reduce the . inf lation rate. When we came to of fice,<br />
inflation as masured by -the CTI adjusted: for 1Medib.-ank was<br />
running at 16.7%. * At the end of June it 10.-2t. This year,-<br />
the Bureau -of . I. gricultural P). conomicsestimates that farm costs<br />
% Y111 rise by less than 10% for the first time since 1972..<br />
The Government has introduced a whole-range ofitaxation-measures<br />
which greatly benefit primary producers. We have acted to protect<br />
primary prodlucers from paying unduly high rates of tax because of<br />
sharp fluctuations in theirdincome. Last year ' we introduced<br />
_ income equal isation deposits, and we. indexed * tax -so ' that no-one:<br />
was pushed. into higher brackets just because of inflation.<br />
Tbis year we dramatcally reduced and simplified those scalea<br />
with the result that every taxpayer is better off; anciwe reformed<br />
the tax averaging scheme,. lrimary proaucers whilpay-tax at<br />
the rate applicable to their average income, or their actual.<br />
i~ ncome for the. year, whichever is lower.<br />
This baars sharp contriast to the so-called Hayden-tax reforms of<br />
1975, which m~ eant that farm3ers in many cases paid more. tax.. than.. a<br />
wage earner on the -swme average income. The Raydlen ' reforms'<br />

Substantially. more funds bave-been given to local: governmnent and<br />
for rural roads.. ~ The Government has reintroduced: the superphospbate<br />
bounty. which Labor abolished, and retained the<br />
nitrogenous fertiliser subsidy which the. TAC w~ anted to have<br />
abolished. We have introduced a new. rural . adjustment, scheme<br />
and consistently given assistAnce with drought a-nd other natural.<br />
disaster relief.<br />
We are conraitted-to the establishment of a National Rural Bank I<br />
wo ncrease priunary prodiucers access to Tunas to refinance their.<br />
debts on a more satisfactory long-term basis. Leqialation. to<br />
establish the D3ank will be introduced as soon as possible this<br />
Oession.<br />
lie have also made strenuous and successful efforts to increase<br />
market access. Negotiations, in Japan in. April, . led to -a<br />
decision by the japanese Government not to reduce beef quotas<br />
as had been-thrvoatened, and wL-arparsuinq -negotiation s.. with<br />
INS a. resuxlt<br />

maket is up-on last-year. K<br />
We have als~ o t-Jcn up with the ) nBC at thie highest lev-el the need<br />
to increase our access to European markets.-Thei European<br />
Coimunity of* 260 million people accounts for 40%: of the world~ s<br />
trade. Aos. recant-ly as 1960,. 40t of our extortq -went to European.<br />
markets. That proportion has been, reduced to 14%-not because<br />
of inefficiency by:-our producers, but to a large extent~ because<br />
of the BB~ C's restrictiv~ e policies. As a result of discussions I<br />
had in Europe last June, the European Commission has agreed to'a.<br />
series * of bilateral trade discussions, and the Minister for-<br />
Special. Trade Negotiations,. John ' Howard,. is currently. engaged<br />
in those discussi~ ons.<br />
in . addition to the measures. for the-. whole rural comrmunity, we<br />
have taken rimerous initiatives to help particular rural<br />
industries w-ool, wheat, sugar, fruit and dairyIng . to. name<br />
a few.<br />
For the. beef i-ndustry, we quickly aboliubhed the Labor-inspired:<br />

There is one-other-matter ofvtlinterest to beef producers / that </p>
<p>that I would like to talk about brief ly -industrial relations.<br />
This Government is absolutealy determined that the law shall apply<br />
in the area of industrial relations. No commn-ity can tolerate<br />
a situation where one area is exempt from the law -this Goverrment<br />
and thie Australian community certainly will not tolerate it. 0<br />
Since we were elected,? we have passed the secret ballot legislation i.<br />
we Promised. We have established the. Industrial Rltions Bureau.<br />
lie have wiiended the Trade Practices Act to ban damagilig secondary,<br />
boycotts. We have legislated to give the Governinent the necessary<br />
powers7 to suspend, dismiss and stand down Coimnwealth employees in<br />
particular circumtancer,. Our indlustrial policy has had considerable<br />
success.-in+ the first six imonths of this year, Australia has bad-the lowestS<br />
level of Industrial disputes, and the lea-st'number of working days.<br />
lest during this decade'.<br />
Because of our secret ballot legislation, xmions-are inaking greater<br />
use of the electoral office to rwi their elections. In the twelve<br />
inoitts since the legislation was introauced, there were 244 such<br />
applications. The Arbitration lnspecto); ate has found evidzence of<br />
recent breaches of the law-by two unions, the Amalgaxnated 1. jetal<br />
Wor3 ers, and Shipwrights Union, and thie Builders Labourers -Pederation+.<br />
If the Industrial' lieg9istrar confirms that breaches have+ occurred<br />
new elections -fully. conforming with.. -the Act-. will-be-hialdi-or-the<br />
unions concerned will face prosecution.<br />
Despite'ttheseimprovements, there are+ ntill' Problems -in iprat<br />
areas.-You-. krsow the Problems union-diisputes are Ft-ill causinq the<br />

export of chilled beef f rom Brisbane . was-brought to a halt.<br />
earlier this year because of a demarcation dispute. 1-t is%-<br />

On-: one. day alone 52, containers of -chilled beef .' iorth over amillion<br />
