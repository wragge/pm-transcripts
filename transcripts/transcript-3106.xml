21 December 1973<br />
AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL FOR THE ARTSGRANTS<br />
FOR CRAFTSMEN<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, has approved grants<br />
totalling $ 199,481 for the crafts.<br />
The grants, which cover all States, were recommended<br />
by the Crafts Board of the Australian Council for the Arts.<br />
The Chairman of the Crafts Board, Mrs. Marea Gazzard,<br />
said that the grants were an expression of the Government's<br />
interest in the crafts as a means of enriching the quality<br />
of life for a broad range of people.<br />
Mrs. Gazzard said that the growth of the crafts in<br />
recent years has been remarkable, especially in the involvement<br />
of young people, who found satisfaction in the use of traditional<br />
skills as an alternative to a mechanized way of life.<br />
On the other hand, good craftsmanship was the basis of<br />
good industrial design, which was vital to Australia's<br />
export industry. other countries had invested heavily in<br />
building design skills, and Australia was just beginning to<br />
realise their potential.<br />
Among the grants is one of $ 6,000 to Greg Smallman of<br />
Newcastle, a classical guitar maker. Formerly a motor<br />
mechanic, his concert guitars have been described by leading<br />
musical authorities as " equal to the best in the world".<br />
Working under difficulties including a lack of air-conditioning<br />
for his small workshop, he has nevertheless produced instruments<br />
eagerly sought by leading players. one of his guitars will be<br />
presented to Alirio Diaz, the celebrated concert guitarist, when<br />
he tours Australia in February.<br />
