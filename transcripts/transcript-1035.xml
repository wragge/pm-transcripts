For Press: P. M. No. 1/ l. 965<br />
' JITHDRA4IAi OF INDONLiSIA FROM UNITED NATIONS<br />
Statement by the Actinjg Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon~ j. Jc1ewe,.<br />
The Acting Prime Minister, Mr. MoEwen, said in<br />
Canberra today that the whole world would be disappointed that<br />
the President of Indonesia, having withdrawn from the United<br />
Nations, should now denounce this organisation.<br />
Mr. McEwen said the United Nations was the hope<br />
on which most of humanity pinned its faith for the progressive<br />
development of processes to prevent war.<br />
" The world looks to the United Nations to aid those<br />
nations and communities whose freedom is incomplete and whose<br />
resources are undeveloped. It is a main hope of those people<br />
who exist on lower than adequate standards," Mr. McEwen said.<br />
The Acting Prime Minister said it would be no<br />
contribution to engage in recriminations.<br />
" The Principles and purposes of the U. N. Charter<br />
enshrine not only recognised principles of international<br />
conduct but the aspirations of mankind for a better and a<br />
peaceful life. I am sure that most people would hope that<br />
Indonesia will act in accordance with those principles and<br />
purposes," Mr. McEwen said.<br />
CANBERRA, 8th January, 1965. </p>
