PRIME MINISTER 7/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
APPOINTMENT OF DEPARTMENTAL SECRETARIES<br />
Mr Graham Evans AO, Secretary to the Department of Transport, will shortly be<br />
retiring after twenty-seven years in the Public Service. I would like to acknowledge<br />
his outstanding work at senior management levels across the Service.<br />
Faced with difficult administrative challenges, Mr Evans successfully led the<br />
Department of Transport and Communications and more recently the Department of<br />
Transport through the implementation of major legislative and administrative changes<br />
which were an essential part of the Government's microeconomic reform agenda. The<br />
substantial record of achievement in the transport and communications sector over the<br />
past seven years is a measure of the effectiveness of that leadership.<br />
Mr Evans has been in his current position for almost seven years, which is well in<br />
excess of the period after which a departmental Secretary would normally be expected<br />
to transfer to another department. While it was not possible at this time to offer him a<br />
suitable alternative position of departmental Secretary, the Government would like Mr<br />
Evans to continue his distinguished contribution to the public sector in this country.<br />
Accordingly, he is to be appointed to the Board of Australia Post. I wish him success<br />
in his new endeavours.<br />
The Government has decided on some changes to departmental Secretary<br />
arrangements, and I will shortly be recommending these to the Governor-General, to<br />
take effect from 20 February 1995.<br />
The new Secretary to the Department of Transport will be Mr Peter Core, currently<br />
Secretary to the Department of Industrial Relations. Mr Core will be replaced in the<br />
Department of Industrial Relations by Dr David Rosalky, who was appointed Secretary<br />
of the ACT Chief Minister's Department in 1994. He served as ACT Under Treasurer<br />
from 1992. Dr Rosalky previously held senior posts in the Commonwealth, including<br />
in my Department and the Department of Finance.<br />
I wish them both well in their appointments.<br />
CANBERRA 13 February 1995 </p>
