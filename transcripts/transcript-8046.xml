PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 29 JUNE 1990<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE MINISTER<br />
FOR COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH, MR HOWE<br />
The Federal Government has today presented National and<br />
State Awards recognising contributions made by employers<br />
to employing people with disabilities.<br />
The Prime Minister's Employer of the Year Awards were<br />
established by the Federal Government to recognise<br />
employers who have provided outstanding employment and<br />
training opportunities for people with disabilities.<br />
The National Awards were presented to Pheonix Printing,<br />
of Windsor, Brisbane, and to the Brisbane City Council.<br />
We commend both for their commitment to the employment of<br />
people with disabilities in their organisations.<br />
The winners and the service providers are to be<br />
congratulated for providing opportunities to people with<br />
disabilities to help them attain their goals of a real<br />
job for real pay.<br />
All of the nominated employers played an important role<br />
in giving people with disabilities a fair go, and set an<br />
excellent example for other employers to follow.<br />
The nominated industries have taken advantage of the<br />
Government opportunities for their enterprises by<br />
employing people with disabilities through<br />
Commonwealth-funded programs.<br />
Pheonix Printing ably demonstrated the belief that<br />
individuals have differing levels of capabilities, and<br />
that people regarded as having a disability have the<br />
right to work for award rates of pay in a job of their<br />
choice. Phoenix Printing employs two people with disabilities on<br />
award wages and provides excellent conditions of<br />
employment. The Brisbane City Council presently employs three people<br />
with disabilities. The Council has ensured full<br />
integration of people with disabilities into the Council<br />
work environment and has placed no restriction on the<br />
type of work they perform. </p>
<p>Thirteen plaques were also presented to State winners.<br />
