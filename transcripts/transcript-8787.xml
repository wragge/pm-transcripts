PRIME MINISTER 5/ 93<br />
STATEMENT BY THlE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
MR FISCHER AND THE MABO JUDGEMENT<br />
Thc remarks made by the Leader of the National Party on Western Australian radio<br />
yesterday so distort the known realitics of thc Mabo Judgement, Australian history and the<br />
contemporary ambitions of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, one is obliged to<br />
conclude that Mr Fischer may have intended themi as an incitement to fear and resentment.<br />
Eleven days into the United Nations International Ycar of the World's Indigenous Pcople<br />
this is Mr Fischer's contribution.<br />
Mr Fischer knows that there is no serious attempt on the part of Aboriginal Australians to<br />
re-claim all of Australia, nor any desire to thrcatcn vital national industries, and he should<br />
havc made that clear to the interviewer who suggested it.<br />
Mr Fischer also knows that there is no " guilt industry" in Australia, and to suggest one<br />
exists is a slur on the dccnt conccrn, loyalty and good will of the vast majority of<br />
Australians. As I said in December in our effort to find fair, rational and just solutions to this historic<br />
problem, guilt is not a constnictivc emot ion. But a recognition of historic wrongs and<br />
continuing injustice is not guilt. A desire to see justice done and an abiding care for this<br />
country and its people is not guilt. The belief that the good name of Australia should<br />
rnot he sullied by prejudice and discrimination is not guilt.<br />
Rather, these arc sentiments which will advance Australia's cause and raise the hopes and<br />
self-estcem of all of us.<br />
Mr. Sattler's attitudes arc his own business, hut a national lcader like MY Fischer should<br />
never have conspired in supporting and disseminating them.<br />
In this International Year of the World's Indigcnous People, and in this decade when<br />
Australia secks reconciliation with the first Australians, he. should withdraw them.<br />
It is equally to he hoped that the Coalition Leader, Dr Ilewson, will totally dissociate thc<br />
Opposition from the views expressed by Mr Fischer, especially given Mr Fischer's<br />
assertion that his Liberal colleagues will " go all the way" with his views.<br />
