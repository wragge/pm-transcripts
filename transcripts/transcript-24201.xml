    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>Have you had any update on the position regarding the Bali Nine?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>We are at the eleventh hour, but even at this late stage, we are maximising our representations to the Indonesian Government. What we are asking of Indonesia is what Indonesia asks of other countries when its citizens are on death row, and if itâs right for Indonesia to ask and expect some kind of clemency, itâs surely right for us to ask and expect some kind of clemency.</p>
<p>Yes, these two young Australians have done a very bad thing. They deserve jail time â they donât deserve to die.</p>
