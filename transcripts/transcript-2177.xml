FOR PRESS P. M. No. 23/ 1970<br />
MR TRUDEAUS VISIT<br />
The Prime Minister warmly welcomed Mr Trudeau's<br />
announcement that he would visit Australia before going to Japan for<br />
Canada' s National Day at Expo 70 on May 27th.<br />
Mr Gorton said that Mr Trudeau had known since they<br />
first met at the Prime Ministers' Conference a year ago that Australia<br />
would be more than delighted to welcome him at any time he could come<br />
and talk to us. Mr Trudeau's visit was tangible evidence of Canada's<br />
keen and growing interest in even closer ties with other Commonwealth<br />
countries in the Pacific. The Government was looking forward to<br />
discussions with the Prime Minister of Canada on many important<br />
matters of mutual interest in the region.<br />
Mr Trudeau is expected to arrive in the middle of May<br />
and to spend about five days here.<br />
