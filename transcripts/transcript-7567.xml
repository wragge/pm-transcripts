Transcript of Interview with Howard Sattler, 6PR Sattler rile<br />
13th April, 1989<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
Sattler: Well on July lot Australian households will be awash with new<br />
money, $ 5.7 billion of it as tax cuts announced by Treasurer Paul<br />
Keating last night begin to flow through pay packets. Family<br />
allowances and dependent rebates will go up, pensioners will be able to<br />
earn more tax free money than they have been at the moment, go and get<br />
a f ew little jobs or if Lhey have got investments Lhey woI t be hit by<br />
the taxman. The Government hopes that its new found gratuitousness<br />
will make you thankful, I amn sure it does, so much so that you will<br />
vote for it at the federal election, that has to be held in about the<br />
next 12 months or so. Well we are about to f ind out if you have been<br />
won over by last night's mini-Budget, with me is my guest Prime<br />
Minister, Bob Hawks. Good morning Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Good morning Howard.<br />
Sattlera My calculations and forgive me if they are a bit awry are<br />
that you personally, you and your wife will be about $ 22 a week better<br />
off after t.. h tax cuts. What are you going to do with your money?<br />
PM Well I am fortunate Howard,, I can probably save mine, but I know<br />
that others can't. But it's very interesting that you should raise<br />
that, I think I actually get a bit more, it might be in the order of<br />
$ 26 a week. It is very interesting to compare the shape of my tax<br />
package which means that people like myself and John Howard don't get<br />
very much, that it is concentrated in the middle with him. I mean we<br />
have been waiting like we have been waiting for Halley's Comet for<br />
their tax policy, so the only thing you can do is look at their last<br />
package in ' 87. Now under the Howard package then, I would have got a<br />
straight $ 156 a week tax cut , joward's approach in ' 87, under mine $ 26.<br />
In other words what we are doing Howard, is deliver to the lower and<br />
middle income where the need is greatest.<br />
Battleri The reason I ask you what you are going to do with it is<br />
because I don't believe you want Australians who are going to get the<br />
increases to just run out and spend it all, you'd want them to save a<br />
bit surely? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: Yes that's part of it and I am very thankful for you asking that<br />
question. There are two things, obviously Howard there are going to be<br />
some of your listeners who are going to need to spend some of their tax<br />
cuts and what they get in increased family allowances and I understand<br />
that'. But I hope that as far as it's possible they will save,, but<br />
there is a second point that I would like to make and I hople I can get<br />
your support for this Howard, that the extent that your 11 steners are<br />
going to spend their tax cuts and the wage increases they get and the<br />
increase in family allowances I plead with them as far as it is humanly<br />
possible to spend on Australian made goods. Because that's the way<br />
Howard that your listeners can become involved in getting what we want<br />
and what they want, the best for Australia. I mean we believe that<br />
they are entitled to this increased income, but we don't want to get a<br />
flood of imports with it, so let's all of us Just consciously think<br />
every time we make a spending decision, let's buy Australian.<br />
Sattlers Well you won't have to do any encouraging to get me on side<br />
for that, because I have alway. believed that that ought to be the way.<br />
But wit~ h the savings, I would have thought pethaps you would have<br />
' ceorhnasipdse redm askoimnge , fuinrtthroerd uecnicnogu rasgoemme entta xt oc opnucte stshioe nsm oonzeay sainv inthges bbaannkk<br />
4epos its.<br />
PM No this question has been looked at all around the world and when<br />
you look at this sort of thing, you have got to look at the other side<br />
as to what you do in regard to the side of income where people pay<br />
interest charges in terms of acquiring the income. It is a very<br />
complex thing and basically no country in the world essentially has<br />
gone to this sort of approach.<br />
Sattlers Well Andrew Peacock said they're looking at it?<br />
PM# Mr Peacock says they are looking at it. I mean isn't it<br />
marvellous what Mr Peacock is looking at. You know the main thing that<br />
Mr Peacock is looking at at the moment is the numbers certainly, but<br />
they are not economic numbers, he has got 34 votes at the moment<br />
against Mr Howard, he wants~ to get up to 41 before he launches a<br />
challenge in the next few weeks. They are the numbers that he is<br />
looking at. Look, when we came into office and they left<br />
Sofice, look at what they left'us and left Australia. A top rate of<br />
cents -in the dollar, the bottom rate was 30 cents in the dollar, they<br />
left us double digit inflation, double digit unemployment, I mean they<br />
had seven years there where they could have shown the people what they<br />
are going to do. And even now, even now they haven't got a tax policy<br />
and the only wages policy that they have got now Howard is the same<br />
one which blew the country apart. in other words, throw it open, let<br />
it be open slather and we'd have a 16 17% wages explosion again like<br />
we had in 1981. X mean they've been there, done it wrecked the economy<br />
once and got exagtly the same lack of policies now and say give us a<br />
chance to knock you around again.<br />
Sattler: I know you were talking to journalists very late last night<br />
in Parliament House, they are the arch cynics, the people who inhabit<br />
the galley over in Canberra, how did they react to the package?<br />
PM Well a mixed reaction, it was basically fairly favorable. I<br />
think the fairest way of saying it is that they were saying well look<br />
Hawke and Keating have kept their promise and that's good, it is<br />
politically sound, they say there is perhaps some economic risk in it.<br />
But if you look at the papers today basically I think it is a f airly<br />
f air coverage they have given us. I have got no complaint about the<br />
media's treatment of it. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Sattler: Our correspondent said it seemed to him there was an<br />
indication that you had given up on trying to bring down interest rates<br />
in the short term?<br />
PM: No* Look I have said before last night Howard, that interest<br />
rates have to stay high f or some time. I don't want to burden your<br />
listeners with a whole range of statistics, but I will just make this<br />
point. In this last 12 months consumption in Australia has increased<br />
by about that l~ e not just personal cnsumption, but that takes in<br />
investment expenditure and all that type of thing and our production<br />
has increased by so the gap is imports. Now we can't just keep on<br />
with that level of activity and sucking in that level of imports. So<br />
we can't make f iscal policy any tighter, we are not going to cut back<br />
on expenditures any more. We have got real reductions in Commonwealth<br />
outlays. We can't therefore in the fiscal area get tougher and<br />
tighter. we can't get tighter in the wages area otherwise it would<br />
Just explode. So that just leaves monetary policy. I mean Howard I<br />
think you know and every one of your listeners with whom I have got the<br />
pleasure of talking to through you, everyone of them know that whatever<br />
they might think about Bob Hawke they don't think he is an idiot. Now<br />
Bob Hawke would be an idiot if he had interest rates higher for one day<br />
Slonger than was necessary. I want interest rates to be lower, but I<br />
Wknow I would be letting the country down if at this stage I had lower<br />
interest rates. we have just got to get the level of activity down<br />
somewhat s0 that we are not sucking in so many imports and I go<br />
back to my first point Howard. Your listeners can become part of<br />
running the Australian economy for the better if they make decisions,<br />
purchasing decisions which are in favour of buying Australian.<br />
Sattlers You could orchestrate lower interest rates couldn't you if<br />
you wanted to?<br />
PM And I am not going to do it, not going to do it because it would<br />
be the worst thing possible for this country at the moment because if<br />
you deliberately orchestrated a reduction in interest rates now that<br />
would lift the level of activity, lift the level of consumption, lift<br />
the level of imports and then you'd just blow the economy apart.<br />
Sattlers Is the announcement last night timed to win us over for long<br />
enough so the majority of us wvii vote for you at the next election. I<br />
mean how close is the next election after last night's statement?<br />
PM: You will have heard me on ' AM' this morning. I have said no<br />
election this year. Just let me go to this point, it is very important<br />
and I know your listeners are interested in this. I made them the<br />
promise in the middle of 1988, 1 said on July 1 1989 I'll deliver you<br />
tax cuts, provided that in 1988/ 89 in this period between then and now<br />
the wage outcomes have been reasonable and that we can negotiate a<br />
reasonable outcome for next year. Now they have been reasonable in<br />
this period since I made that promise in the middle of last year, we<br />
negotiated a reasonable outcome for this, so I am delivering on a<br />
specific promise that I made to the Australian people 12 months ago.<br />
Now what would be saying if I said now, I am not going to keep that<br />
promise, I mean Johnny Howard and the rest of the cynics would be<br />
saying oh look Hiawkey promised this, he is going to give it to you on<br />
the lst July, he hasn't delivered. I am delivering on a promise made<br />
12 months ago, the election is not on this year, the election is quite<br />
a way away.<br />
Battler: What about the other promise about no child living in poverty<br />
in Australia by 1990. Paul Keating now reckons that he has brought<br />
that forward 6 months. Are you fair dinkun? </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM1 Yes of course I am f air dinkum. It was accepted by the social<br />
welfare industry) the people with whom we discussed thie, that the way<br />
in which we produced the situation I promised which was that there'll<br />
be no financial need for a kid to live in poverty, was that the<br />
allowances that families would get) the low income families would get<br />
would be a percentage of the married pension rate. That is it would be<br />
for the upper age bracket of the kids and 15% for the lower age<br />
bracket of the kids. Now by the increases that we have made now to the<br />
family allowance and the family allowance supplement we have reached<br />
those percentages agreed upon with the welfare industry, reached them<br />
this year ahead of target.<br />
Sattlers All right, well what are we going to do about all those kids<br />
still living in the streets in poverty?<br />
PM: Well as I have explained, it is a pretty miserable sort of approach<br />
which says Hawke has brought in what is recognised in this country and<br />
around the world as the moot historic delivery of a promise to give the<br />
financial capacity to eliminate poverty which has benefitted millions<br />
of kids in this country and it has involved expenditures of<br />
unprecedented proportions) to say all right Hawke has done all that,<br />
provided the money, but there are some kids living in poverty. Because<br />
Hawke never said, Hawke never said that I can control every domestic<br />
situation, + hat I can create a situation where a kid and his parents<br />
are not going to break up and the kid is going to run away f rom home.<br />
I mean do we want that sort of society where I can command and control<br />
every household? ' The only thing I can do and,* which I have delivered my<br />
promise is that we will provide to every f amily that amount of money<br />
which will mean that there is no financial need for any child to live<br />
in poverty. I have delivered on that promise now absolutely. Now In<br />
regard to those who through a variety of domestic situations leave home<br />
are in the street, now that is something that together we of the<br />
Commonwealth and the States have to address. Wde have got the Burdekin<br />
Report that came out a couple of months ago, now we are working on<br />
that,. we have from our paint of view -since we have been in of fice had<br />
a very substantial increase in the amount of funding for refuges,&amp; a very<br />
substantial increase in funding from the order of about 15 million upto<br />
about 60 I think the figure is, I mean it is a very substantial<br />
increase. I offered at the end of last year another $ 40 million to the<br />
States for increased funding in co-operation with them to meet<br />
W homelessness situations. We'll do all that we can in co-operation with<br />
the States to meet that particular problem, but no reasonable person<br />
thinks that Bob Hawke or any other Prime Minister for that matter can<br />
control every domestic situation.<br />
Sattler: The Premiers are heading of f to Canberra in a months time,<br />
they're not going to get too much joy, I don't think there will be too<br />
much money on offer to them will there?<br />
PM: No and they have got to play their part. We have slashed off now<br />
another $ 360 million of f our expenditures and we are going to ask them<br />
to pay the same, because they are the ones that with us get the benefit<br />
of the lower wage outcomes. All this package is calculated to get<br />
lower wage outcomes than would otherwise be the case and if we get that~<br />
as we willp the States and Local Govt benefit, so they have got to make"<br />
a contribution.<br />
Sattler: Prime Minister our listeners want-to talk to you this. morning<br />
on the day after the night before about the mini-Budget or tax-wage<br />
package announced last night, call it what you will, i am sure you'd be<br />
happy to get some reaction from them? </p>
<p>PM: Sure, love to.<br />
Sattlers 221 1233 is. the number if want to speak with the Prime<br />
Minister. He is happy to speak with you for a few more minutes that he<br />
is on the line and you can tell him what you think of the package<br />
announced last night. We will take a short break and back with you and<br />
him in a moment Taking talkback on this morning after the<br />
announcement last night of a new wages-tax package for Australians and<br />
we have got Prime Minister Bob Hawke and he is taking your calls.<br />
First is Clem, hello Clem.<br />
Caller: Good morning, good morning Mr Hawke.<br />
PM Good morning.<br />
Caller: Thanks for what you have done for the pensioners.<br />
PMe Thanks mate.<br />
Callers But what I want to talk to you about now are the f orgotten<br />
pensioners in the Budget.<br />
0PM: Who are they Clem?<br />
Caller; According to the Social Security Review towards the national<br />
retirement incomes policy, there are approximately a 1,800,000 aged and<br />
service pensioners, of which 13.5% have no other income and in addition<br />
there are other pensioners who have other income ranging from si to<br />
who don ' t have to pay any tax. zIn all I assess there would be at least<br />
300,000 pensioners who receive no benefit from the tax deal. You have<br />
repeatedly said that any benefits should be channeled to those<br />
pensioners most in need, well you must agree that these pensioners that<br />
I am talking about are the needy ones. Will you take this up with Brian<br />
Howe and Paul Xeating with a view to paying these pensioners a special<br />
income supplement to compensate the tax benefits gained by the more<br />
affluent pensioners?<br />
PM: Clem let me, I appreciate what you have said, let me just say one<br />
of the two things that we did last night will benefit all pensioners.<br />
I mean you have referred to the fact that we have moved to relieve the<br />
* tax burden on that income up to $ 40 which pensioners can currently earn<br />
Swithout losing any of their pension and we are going to make that tax<br />
free, now your point you are making is that there are some that don't<br />
get any income. Now let me say the second thing of course that we did<br />
last night benefits them and that is by bringing forward the operation<br />
date. You remember that in 1986 we put in the 6 weeks delay and<br />
pensioners were very good in co-operating about that as a result of the<br />
decision we made last night Clem, we not only going to make up that 6<br />
weeks, bring forward the time of adjustment after the CPI comes out,<br />
but also bring it f orward by another 6 weeks so that by September of<br />
next year all pensioners will be getting the adjustment 12 weeks<br />
earlier than they now get it. Anid that benefits all pensioners, but I<br />
would have to just remind you Clem that the things that we have done in<br />
the area of the pension since we have been in which has been directed<br />
particularly to those in the category that you talk about which don't<br />
get this extra income, don't earn this extra income, I mean we have<br />
made sure there have been significant increases in rent assistance, we<br />
have introduced a carer' s pension a remote area allowance and of course<br />
we have adjusted pension rates for inflation so that in fact in the<br />
period we have been in office the real purchasing power of the pension<br />
has increase by just under 8% against what our predecessors did of<br />
having reduced the real purchasing power. </p>
<p>PM: cont... So we have got in mind the area of pensioners that you<br />
talk about.<br />
Battler: Okay next caller on the line is Mervyn. Hello Mervyn?<br />
Caller 2: Good morning~ how axis you.<br />
Sattler: The Prime Minister is listening.<br />
PM: Good morning Mervyn.<br />
Caller 2: Good morning Bob. Bob I didn't hear or didn't see any<br />
mention in any reports I have seen about us poor unemployed people.<br />
What's in it for us Bob, what have you done, what's happening for us?<br />
We have all got our home mortgage rates, we've still got our shire<br />
rates, we still got electricity and water rates*..<br />
Sattler: Okay Miervyn he has got a lot of people waiting on the line,<br />
can you just let him answer?<br />
PM: Well Mervyn the first thing that I can say in respectAthe<br />
unemployed in this country, what we have done is to reduce the numbers<br />
of them drastically. I mean when we came to office in 1983 the level of<br />
Sunemployment was over 1O% ArWe have drastically reduced that by creating<br />
1.3 million jobs. In other words, the level and rate of unemployment<br />
as a result of the policies that I and my colleagues have introduced<br />
has been drastically reduced. But we haven't then said well okay bad<br />
luck for those who are unemployed, we have significantly increased the<br />
benefits for those who are genuinely unemployed, there has been a<br />
significant increase both in the money payments and the associated<br />
benefits, but the important thing Mervyn in respect of the unemployed<br />
right at this time is that we pursued policies which are going to mean<br />
that we can continue to create jobs. Now, quite simply~ what had to be<br />
done there was to have a tax deal which the workers would accept as a<br />
substitute for wage increases so that they would get increases in their<br />
income but not in a way which was going to be super -inflationary and<br />
create unemployment. So the best thing that we can do for the<br />
unemployed is to make sure that we create more jobs..<br />
Caller2: When you are 57 years old, there is not a great deal of<br />
opportunity there, been retrenched and you are 58 years old what are<br />
you going to do?<br />
PM: Well Mervyn the things that we are doing is in there as to very<br />
significantly increase the. amount of money that we have put into<br />
training programmues and retraining programmes to make sure that those<br />
who unfortunately have been retrenched from one job have more<br />
opportunities for training and retraining to fit themselves for other<br />
positions. We've just massively increased in real terms the amount o<br />
funding that's gone into training programmes of that sort and 1I,<br />
sympathise that there are still some legitimately like yourselves who<br />
in no sense can be called dole bludger or anything like that, that want<br />
a job. All I can say mate is that we have created jobs in the period<br />
that we have been in office four times faster than Fraser and Howard<br />
when they were in bef ore us and we are creating them twice as fast as<br />
the rest of the world. Trhe big thing is to go on creating more jobs<br />
and to have these training progranmes ard retraining programmes which<br />
are going to give people like you the best sort of opportunities. Could<br />
I make this personal suggestion, I don't know whether you have done it,<br />
I guess you may have, but please go to the CES or your Social Security<br />
office and get the details of the training programmes that are<br />
available to help people like yourself, because there is a range of<br />
them which you may not be aware of. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
Sattler: All right Prime Minister, thank you very much for being with<br />
us today and taking some of those talkback calls, I hope I have asked<br />
most of the questions that people wanted to and we will look forward to<br />
your company when you get across here in Perth pretty shortly.<br />
PM As always Howard it is a pleasure to talk with you and through you<br />
to your listeners, thank you very much. </p>
