BRIFING FOR HEADS OF BITREAUX,<br />
PARLIAMENTARY PRESS GALLERY,<br />
CANBERRA 1 APRIL, 1968<br />
PRIME MINISTER : You have all had copies of the statement, so there is<br />
no point in r~ eading it over to you, so here I am. What would you<br />
like to ask about it?<br />
Q : Can you tell us what lay behind the President's<br />
statement. Any official or unofficial advice as to why he made<br />
this decision?<br />
PM: Nothing other than would appear on the surface of it<br />
that hie does hope that this will lead Hanoi to start entering into<br />
peace negotiations.<br />
Q. is there anything to indicate that Hanoi might?<br />
PM4. Nothing that I have seen, but It Is after all, quite a<br />
gesture on the part of the United States.<br />
Q. At what stage were you informed, Sir, of the US plans<br />
for de-escalation?<br />
PM: Yesterday.<br />
Q. After you returned from New Zealand.<br />
PM: Yes. They were trying to get In touch with New Zealand<br />
but they missed me.<br />
Q. Did you see a full draft of this speech yesterday, Sir?<br />
PM: No, the State Department just sent out all the significant<br />
points that were to be covered but not the draft of the speech. No.<br />
Q. Did that include his decision not to seek re-election?<br />
PM: Nc.<br />
Q. You learnt of this today?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
Q. V/ hat is your reaction to that, Sir?<br />
PM:. Well I have got a brief statement that I have written<br />
out, but it is not yet typed, but I could have it typed and circulated.<br />
Here it is " I do ' not think it proper to comment on the decision<br />
taken by President Johnson not to seek re-election, other than<br />
to say that we In Australia will always remember with gratitude<br />
the warmth and special consideration which he has shown to us<br />
during his Presidency. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
PM ( Contd.) " He has had to bear Immense burdens and make<br />
momentaus decisions and carry the responsibility for<br />
those decisions and I believe he has made them<br />
on the basis of what he sincerely believed to be right,<br />
and to the ultimate benefit of freedom inside the United<br />
States and outside that country. He Is a greata."<br />
Q. You are satisfied, Mr Prime Minister, that this<br />
decision will hold and he won't go back on It?<br />
PM: On reading the words that he used, it seems to me<br />
that they come as close as It is possible to come to the words<br />
the previous American President used who was It Sherman, I<br />
think " IJw on't run, and if I am elected, I won't serve". It<br />
seemed to me that<br />
Q. It's final?<br />
PM: Well, I can only go on the words that he used, but<br />
they seemed to me to be very final words<br />
Q. Except for the reason he gave. The one reason<br />
I heard he gave was that he was so busy conduct Ing the war in<br />
Viet Nam that he didn't have time to run an election campaign,<br />
which did seem to leave the door open a little bit for a draught.<br />
( Interjection) He said at a press conference afterwards It was<br />
on our four o'clock news that the decision was Irrevocable.<br />
PM: I can't comment other than on the words that he<br />
used and they seem to me to be perfectly finite words.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, in your statement, you point<br />
out where this statement of President Johnson's is consistent with<br />
past American statements. In fact, this Is an entirely different<br />
break In policy as far as we are concerned. ' They have virtually<br />
unconditionally elected to cease the bombing. Did this particular<br />
move catch you by surprise or were you expecting It fromn the<br />
political winds?<br />
PM: Now, let's analyse a little what you say bef ore I<br />
answer it, if you don't mind....<br />
Q. To put it more simply, Sir, were you advised in<br />
advance of this major change of policy?<br />
PM: I was told yesterday of the points that were covered<br />
In the President's speech of today. If you will have read the text<br />
of the President's speech, he presents this as an advance on his<br />
San Antonio speech. In the San Antonio speech, he aid " We are<br />
prepared to stop the bombing of North Viet Nam as soon as we<br />
have an Indication that North Viet Nam will enter into negotiations<br />
as a result"'. He has gone further than that, one step further than<br />
that by now saying, " Well, we will stop the bombing of most of<br />
North Viet Nam, even though we haven't got a previous indication<br />
that Hanoi will enter Into peace negotiations, but we call on Ho<br />
Chi Minh to respond to this, and we call on the Go-Chairmen to<br />
ask Hanoi to respond to it. It is a further step. ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Q. You wouldn't call it a major change, then?<br />
PM: Well, I can only present to you the position as it Is<br />
offered to Hanoi In the initial statement: " We will stop bombing<br />
altogether as soon as you give us an Indication that if we do, we<br />
will enter Into ngtais. Then that statement shortly<br />
afterwards is expanded by another statement saying, " Of course, if<br />
we do this aud we expect to enter into peace negotiations, we don't<br />
expect the North to take military advantage of It in a great build-up."<br />
But It would be reasonable to expect them to maintain the forces they<br />
have got there. This is a further step forward In that he is now not<br />
ceasing bombing, but ceasing bombing on a considerable are....<br />
Q. Less ruthless, shall we say?<br />
PM: Well, it Is closer to the battle area and more designed<br />
obviously to hinder flows of men and materials directly to the North<br />
where the fighting Is taking place. B ut he Is taking that extra step.<br />
Q. He also says, Sir, just to sort of get back to this:<br />
YThis is the first step in a series of de-escalating the<br />
PM: He says It may be the first step in a series of<br />
de-escalations<br />
Q. We don't have the full text....<br />
PM: 9. and he hopes it will be the first step.<br />
Q. But it Is a step towards de-escalatlono This is the<br />
Important break I was talking about. There have been a series of<br />
escalations military escalations and this Is the first positive and<br />
recognisable military de-escalation as distinct from statements of<br />
what we would do or could do. They are actually doing soiiierhing.<br />
Did that particular act Ion take you by surprise?<br />
PM: You are claiming that previous bombing pauses which<br />
have taken place are not to be described as de-escalatlons because<br />
you know that America has stopped previously, and you wouldn't<br />
regard that as being a de-escalation?<br />
Q. They didn't call It that at the time.<br />
PM: No, but they did stop it. I think you should read the<br />
actual text of the statement which Is that he hopes that this will lead<br />
to rapid peace talks and that they in turn will lead to increased<br />
de-escalation.<br />
Q : On this point this is " Iffy" of course If nothing<br />
happened quickly, would you want the bombing to start again, because<br />
you say " We must all hope that this response is forthcoming quickly"<br />
PM: W ell we hope -the response Is forthcoming quickly<br />
because we hope that the peace talks will begin which Is what we<br />
constantly wanted.<br />
Q. If nothing happens? o. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
PM: Well, I wouldn't know.<br />
Q. Will this make any difference to the talks ANZUS<br />
and SEATO are having?<br />
PM: I would think not. I would think it would have no<br />
bearing on them at all.<br />
Q. Sir, have you had any impression from America<br />
that if this doesn't lead to de-escalation, it doesn't work out the<br />
way the President hoped, it will resume bombing?<br />
PM: I have only got the text of the President's speech<br />
and the points which waere covered, and they don't extend into that<br />
area.<br />
Q. Sir, the request in the past to be kept informed of<br />
any major change in policy in Viet Nam and the fact that your two<br />
Ministers on Tuesday and Thursday were obviously placed in the<br />
position that they went right on a linb, on the thing, are there<br />
going to be any approaches that we be Informed of these things In<br />
the future?<br />
PM: Well, I think we have consitnl made it clear,<br />
Indeed as late as the Governor-General's S peech, where it was<br />
said in unequivocal language that we would support any moves Which<br />
were designed to lead to the opening of peace talks, and we expect<br />
those peace talks to lead to a real peace which, Indeed, Is clear.<br />
By " peace", I ne an a just and enduring peace, and self-determination<br />
for the Vietnamese a real peace Indeed, the President's<br />
statement this time indicates that thisis what Is being desired, and<br />
not something which he describes in his statement as a fake peace.<br />
Well we have consistently indicated that we wouild support those<br />
kinds of moves, and I think this is a move along that path.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, doesn't it seem that the close<br />
consultation that we have always been told this Government has with<br />
the American Government wasn't in evidence this time?<br />
PM: I told you when we were informed of the points<br />
which were to be covered in the American speech, they weren't<br />
discussed with us before that time; but as I have pointed out, we<br />
have made It perfectly clear that we were prepared to support<br />
efforts to reach a genuine peace. This Is a step further than the<br />
San Antonio speech. It is a step further. The San Antonio spoech<br />
was speaking of ceasing bomibing altogether, which I think you<br />
mentioned. This one mentions ceasing bom-bing In the highly<br />
populated areas, the food-producing areas, but retains it on the<br />
approaches to the military field, and It Is therefore a cessation<br />
of bombing on significant areas of Viet Nam well, I have put<br />
it in this statement.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, are you likely to discuss this<br />
directl. y by telephone or any other way with Mr Johnson to get<br />
to his reasoning? You have indicated you only have the text<br />
of his speech as we have probably had It. </p>
<p>Me Yes, well...<br />
Q. I thought you would probably want to know the reasons<br />
behinL_.<br />
PM: Well the reasoning behind It, I think, appears quite<br />
clearly in the speech itself. He does hope that this will lead to a<br />
reaction from Hanoi, and that it will lead to the opening of peace<br />
talks. He expresses in his speech the hope that he will get a<br />
reaction from Hanoi in response to this gesture and that then the<br />
question could be open for discussion as to whether the areas that<br />
were being still to be bombed for military purposes could be.<br />
also taken away from bombing, provided certain arrangements were<br />
made. And this is the de-escalation of which you were talking...<br />
Q. Do you feel there is a necessity to ring him or to<br />
get our Ambassador in Washington to give you a background report<br />
or briefing on this?<br />
PM: WNell I don't think it is necessary because I think the<br />
indication is there. When the State Department people told me the<br />
points that were to be covered, they indicated to me that this was<br />
a hope in the hope that this sort of thing would follow.<br />
Q. I presume you will discuss it with Dean Rusk during<br />
your talks with him later in the week, anyway?<br />
PM: I wouldn't necessarily say that I would or that I<br />
wouldn't. I will be discussing a whole range of matters with Dean<br />
Rusk.<br />
Q. You will have some background material from our<br />
Embassy in Washington, Sir, won't you, be fore tomorrow's<br />
Parliament?<br />
PM: Well, we have had some background material from<br />
Waller. You can't go much further, I don't think, than what I have<br />
told you. That is the background material and the background thinking<br />
to it.<br />
Q. What about the President's health? Do you know<br />
anything about that?<br />
PM: No, but Waller's views were the same as mine<br />
there was a question I was asked earlier as to the definiteness of<br />
this announcement of not standing and Waller's views were that<br />
he believed It was quite definite. Since then, there has been another<br />
thing I understand.<br />
Q. Sir, there are two alternatives in this either the<br />
North Vietnamese have indicated something or the Americans have<br />
made a definite change. You have indicated that this is a new step.<br />
PM: I indicated they had gone one step further. Yes.<br />
Q. It's about six weeks since I think Mr Rusk finally<br />
rejected the last Vietnamese statement. / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PM: I don't jkpci' which cone you are talking about, John.<br />
! tes abo. ur six weeks. Now, what is the newv factor as<br />
You see it in the la oix weeks which has influenced the President to<br />
mako thim, ._, iic we see as a new step?<br />
PM: I'm sorry, John, I don't know the statement of Rusk that<br />
you are talking about, but It was, I think, last August that the San<br />
Antonio srneech was<br />
Q. Yes, then late in December, the North Vietnamese<br />
Foreign Minister said something -If you stop bombing, we'll talk.<br />
PM: Did he?<br />
Q. And it took until 14th February to investigate it and say<br />
that It wasn't bona fide. Now, in the six weeks since, we have a new<br />
factor to make a new step?<br />
PM: I don't have any information I haven't been given any<br />
by the Ext ernal Affairs Department that the North Vietnamese have<br />
ever made the statement You stop bombing and we will talk.<br />
Rather I thought the statements had been Unless bombing Is stopped,<br />
we won't talk.<br />
Q. Sir, you have indicated that you are quite happy with this.<br />
Some of your Ministers in the past have strongly opposed any such move<br />
on the grounds as recently as last Thursday, the Defence<br />
Minister, Mr Fairhall, talking about bombing North Viet Nam at large<br />
said that the only thing that made North Viet Nam as a whole different<br />
from the demilitarized zone or Laos and Cambodia which were safe<br />
havens for the North Viet Nam troops, was the bombing at large of<br />
North Viet Nam Have you discussed this with them? Are their<br />
feelings still the same? Are they still opposed to this?<br />
PM: I haven't discussed the statement with Mr Fairhall.<br />
If you look at practically everything I have said on this matter, either<br />
in the Higgins by-election or in radio and television appearances, " Four<br />
Corners" and things of this kind, or indeed again, in the Governor-<br />
General's speech, or in New Zealand, you will see a consistent thread,<br />
I think, that we don't to destroy North Viet Nam, we don't want to<br />
destroy the North Vietnamese Government. We see the value of bombing<br />
as to try and hamper and hinder the flow of troops and materials from the<br />
North to the South and this Is the significance we attach to it. Well that<br />
again, as this statement indicates, is now going to be sought to be done<br />
by bombing a smaller area than it was before. That Is still designed to<br />
try to prevent and we never claimed it did prevent but to make it<br />
difficult, to hamper the flow of men and materials, while at the same time<br />
freeing the large areas further north from the danger of attack in<br />
the hope that that will lead to a postive response from Hanoi. Then it<br />
could go step by step If that happened. I think that was the reasoning<br />
behind it.<br />
Q. Sir, could you tell me, since you were Informed yesterday,<br />
which Ministers have you discu.-sed this with? Have you talked to Mr<br />
Has luck? / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
PM: Well, I have been in cable communication with Mr Has luck<br />
In New Zealand. I had a word with Gordon Preeth, the acting Minister<br />
bere, and with a number of officials, and with the Deputy Prime Minister.<br />
Q. Have you spoken to any other Prime Ministers like Mr<br />
Holyoake?<br />
PM: No.<br />
Q. Sir, how soon do you expect a positive response from<br />
Hanoi? ' What would you call a reasonable thing?<br />
PM: I couldn't guess. I wouldn't guess.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister how big do you see this move?<br />
PM: I think it ought to be able to be regarded a~ s a real test<br />
of whether North Viet Nam Is prepared to start talking or not.<br />
Q. Would you go further than that?<br />
PM: I think that Is a pretty big thing, Isn't It?<br />
Q. Do you think there have been steps to peace on an equal<br />
scale?<br />
PM: I think perhaps that this is the greatest concession the<br />
Americans have made. There have been concessions, but following on<br />
from the thing held out at San Antonio, and the President's speech itself,<br />
when you read It all in with the 3San Antonio one, this is a further concession<br />
than was offered In the San Antonio speech.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, could you illuminate the section of<br />
the President's statement on troops? Could you call his attitude now one<br />
of having a holding operation?<br />
PM: No, I don't think I would. I think he has indicated a resolve<br />
to continue the struggle, and indeed, a resolve to build up the South<br />
Vietnamese armed forces, and expect them with the equipment which the<br />
United 2tates will provide, to take an even bigger part to provide some<br />
reinforcements from the United S0tates Itself, and to continue the struggle<br />
I have forgotten the words he used, but the resolve is completely unweakened.<br />
Q. This is directly related to the Tet offensive?<br />
PM: I have seen no Indication of It. I car only tell you what<br />
I have been told and what I believe to be the reason behind it. I think<br />
the reason behind It Is All right. We will make this further concession.<br />
We will go this extra mile.<br />
Q. Do you think the New Hampshire primaries may have had<br />
anything to do with it?<br />
PM: W1-ell, would they have anything to do with it if he wasn't<br />
go to stand for President again? </p>
<p>~ 0-<br />
Q. Does this leave you in the position that you need to<br />
clarify your thinking on the thing. Obviously, yourp. consbsted of a<br />
series of impressions as you have told us today.<br />
PM: My thinking of a series of impressions on what?<br />
Q. On his official statement and the slight background<br />
given to you by the S" tate Department. Will this speed up any intention<br />
on your part to go to the States to talk with him and his authorities?<br />
Or will you rely on Mr Rusk here?<br />
PM: Well, I will be talking to Mr Rusk here. I was proposing<br />
to go to the States quite soon for a rush trip, but they will be engaged In<br />
all kinds ofi various political activities. Now that President Johnson has<br />
indicated that he will not be standing again, I will have to consider whether<br />
It might not better to do it later.<br />
Q: Could you indicate when you say'soon Sir, what your<br />
original plans were?<br />
PM: 6 Well, they were pretty tentative.<br />
Q. You will wait for a new President, then?<br />
PM: W~ ell, this Is the sort of thing I said I would have to take<br />
into consideration. I want to think about it.<br />
Q. Otherwise it could be a trip which<br />
PM: Well, there are all sorts of considerations<br />
Q. In view of the fact that this very latest step was taken<br />
without consultation with the Australian Government, despite assurances<br />
we had in 1966 after the Honolulu Conference, can we take this as<br />
official acknowledgment now that the war has passed out of our hands<br />
without even going through the pretence of Influencing the course of the<br />
war here?<br />
PM: Well, I suppose anybody is at liberty to take arythi ng<br />
at any time in any way they like. Are you asking me the way i take it<br />
or you asking me the way you can takce it?<br />
Q. The Government.<br />
PM: Well, let me make these points. This is not anything<br />
which in any way requires any increased contributions from Austrdflia.<br />
This Is not something which requires Australia to make some additional<br />
effort at all. In those kind of circumstances, I have no doubt whatever<br />
that full consultations would take place. I don't expect them to take<br />
place In other circumstances.. . If anyone wants to interpret that....<br />
This is a further attempt and a further step to see whether they can<br />
bring about talks while continuing the struggle in South Viet Nam, wl-e ther<br />
they can bring about talks leading to a genuine peace. 7! e have<br />
consistently said that we would support such attempts. / 9 </p>
<p>Q. Have we said what we think is a genuine peace?<br />
PM: Yes, we have. I can't remember the words, but a just<br />
and enduring peace that really gives the people of South Viet Nam the<br />
opportunity to make freedom cf choice. That Is it by and large. You<br />
will find this firm statement in the Governor-General's Speech, I think<br />
Q. On this point of consultation Mr Prime Minister, are<br />
you then satisfied with the lack of consultation and warning that the<br />
Australian Government was given?<br />
PM: I thought I had answered that before in the last question,<br />
Indicating that we would support moves leading towards it ( peace). In<br />
the Governor-General's Speech, we said we seek a just and lasting<br />
peace based on those objectives. I will read you the whole passage,<br />
because It ties In with something you said, Frank<br />
" My Government believes that the South Vietnamese<br />
people should retain the elementary right to determine their own<br />
future In their own way and will, besides the effective military<br />
assistance It is rendering to this end, continue to provide economic<br />
and civil aid 10 South Viet H'. am.<br />
In doing this, my Government desires neither the<br />
destruction of North Viet Nam, nor the overthrow of the Government<br />
of North Viet Nam but merely the cessation of aggression against<br />
the people of South Viet Nam so that those people may, by the<br />
exercise of a franchise they have shown they know how to exercise<br />
even under the most difficult and dangerous circumstances, choose<br />
their own form of government. We seek a just and lasting peace<br />
based on these objectives. We have supported and will support<br />
every effort for negotiation of such a peace.<br />
Q. Even In the better conditions of peace, as we state them,<br />
what are the pre-conditions as you see them for. peace. talks? What are<br />
the pre-conditions before we get Into talks? Are there any?<br />
PM: Well, I Imagine a pre-condition Is that the Government<br />
of North Viet Nam indicates that they are prepared to enter into peace<br />
talks.<br />
Q. A cease-fire?<br />
PM: This seems to be the objective, doesn't it? I mean, this<br />
Is the objective, to enter Into peace talks. This has been, all the time.<br />
The United States has been saying, " W. ell, we'll try this. W. e'll try<br />
that to see whether It results in an indication that the North Vietnamese<br />
will begin to talk" Not necessarily before the fighting finishes, but<br />
begin to<br />
Q. The diplomatic pressure Is obviously on them now. There<br />
will be some sort of an answer, apparently. If we presume there will<br />
be some sort of an answer, I am looking for a minimum pre-condition<br />
that we would regard as acceptable. Just a willingness to enter talks?<br />
PM: Well, this is what.....<br />
Q. Will we be taking any diplomatic Initiative to urge Britain<br />
to follow the Fresident's request to call a meeting, to get moving? ./ 1G<br />
C'. </p>
<p>10<br />
PM: To call Britain and. Russia to get on to Ho Chi Minh?<br />
Q. Are we going to press Britain along on this?<br />
PM: I wouldn't comment on that at this stage.<br />
Q. V/ hat is the difference between this bombing pause and the<br />
previous bombing pause? This has been presented as a dramatic move by<br />
the US. It has been presented In rather dramatic circumstances with<br />
rather dramatic surrounds. But Is it essentially any different from the<br />
previous bombing pauses?<br />
PM: Well, I think one has to make on's own mind up about this,<br />
but previously, there have been sort of bombing pauses this is not presented<br />
as a bombing pause essentially but there have been bombing pauses in<br />
the sort of hope that we would see what happened. Now, the -next step was<br />
that the President I am sorry to go over the same ground again made<br />
the San Antonio speech in which he said, " We'll stop bombing if youwill<br />
start talking and not take great military advantage of our stopping bombing"<br />
and that didn't seem to elicit any response. Then a number of people around<br />
h the world said, " W~ ell, give it a go anyway. Stop the bombing and we think<br />
they will probably talk if you do. Give them an opportunity to talk. They<br />
said they wouldn't talkc if you didn't. This is a stopping of bombing except<br />
for the direct military support which Is needed. Well, as I said before, It<br />
will test whether this does lead to indications of their willingness to enter<br />
Into talks.<br />
Q. This also has an element of tick-tacking involved in it. " We'll<br />
do this and we expect some gesture on your part and we will do something<br />
else. This wasn't apparent In the earlier bombing pauses.<br />
PM: This word " tick-tacking" what do you rre an by that? I think It Is<br />
a sort of indication. All right. Here's a real gesture. Does it elicit<br />
any response? If it elicits a res-ponse, then we can talk about the next<br />
step downwards, at the same time as we are talking about how to achieve<br />
a just and enduring peace. The whole thing, I think, is now waiting to<br />
see what sort of a response it elicits.<br />
Q. just on this point of consultations, Sir. Is the point you are making<br />
because we have said we support any steps towards peace, there Is no need<br />
for the United . States to come to us and say " We are going to do this because<br />
we see this as a step towards peace"?<br />
PM: W~ ell, I was endeavouring to indicate that the United Statep<br />
in relation to all the things we have said about supporting ste-ps towards<br />
peace and supporting the previous San Antonio speech of the President,<br />
might have thought it was essential fcr long-term prior consultations had<br />
there been any alteration the other way, had there been any alteration in<br />
continuing their resolve on the ground in South Viet Nam, altering their<br />
approach there, which there is no indication of at all.<br />
Q. It is-just that in the reassessment that went on, one would have thought<br />
they would have said to the other nations fighting " What are your views<br />
as to the conduct of the war and how It is going?" before they made the<br />
unilateral decision. </p>
<p>11i<br />
Q. Particularly in the light of the fact that our Government, the<br />
Australian Government hes; ccfte* nr1v elsme. di that one of the motives<br />
in bombing was co save Australian lives.<br />
PM: Well, the bombing Is still going on in the areas where there is<br />
a military build-up put it this way, the bottlenecks, the trails along<br />
which men and munitions have been flowing down to the south, and that<br />
Is why the same approach you have just said, quite properly, is the<br />
Australian Government's approach, is why the American President said<br />
" I couldn't In all conscience prevent that part of the bombing" because It<br />
would tend to help our people being killed.<br />
Q. Sir, in the last paragraph of yq 1i~ ment today you talked about<br />
not leaving allied troops at too great a fsdvantage. s' hsa diso<br />
that the cessation that is being allowed will do just that?<br />
PM: V1111 do just what?<br />
Q. Leave our troops at some disadvantage...<br />
PM: Oh. You read out my statement which said this is not leaving our<br />
troops at too great~ isadvant age and then suggested my statement was<br />
saying it did just that, that it did leave them at too great a military<br />
disadvantage. It doesn't. But clearly there would be some military loss<br />
because you are not bombing arms factories, barracks and roads and<br />
bridges further north, so there would be some diminution of the effort<br />
in that direction, and that, I think, Indicates that this Is a real gesture<br />
on the part of the United States.<br />
Q. ' Would it seem, Sir, if this gesture does succeed, even more Australian<br />
lives will be saved?<br />
PM: You mean if it moves step by step long term, and you reach the<br />
logical goal of having a real peace which gives them a chance, well you<br />
don't have people killed when you reach a real peace.<br />
Q. You don't see it in any way what the Americans have done about<br />
bombing as a public admission that their bombing policy has failed?<br />
PM: I don't think it is a public admission at all. I think it Is a genuine<br />
attempt, as the President has said, to make this move in the hope that it<br />
will lead to Hanoi entering into these talks whereas previously and this<br />
is the significant change that we'Ve been talking about, he has said we<br />
would like an indication of entering Into peace talks Iefore we make the<br />
next move. Now that is a significant change Indeed.<br />
Q. Do you propose a debate on any straement you might make on this<br />
to the House?<br />
PM: I don't believe I would be proposing a debate. I will probably make<br />
a statement to Parliament, but then it is open to debate....<br />
Q. You will make a further statement tomorrow?<br />
PM: I think ! ha t would be the reasonable thing to do.<br />
Q. Thie way will then be open for the Opposition to reply? </p>
<p>It 12<br />
PM: Well, there could be a debate on this. Yes.<br />
Q. Has the Foreign Affairs debate finished?<br />
PM: Well, I have been away. I haven't caught up with it. W~ e only<br />
got back yesterday afternoon. I had to do a little work yesterday after<br />
we got back and I haven't had time to get round to<br />
Q. It was adjourned, Sir, on the motion of Mr Giles.<br />
Q: VWill you have an early Cabinet meeting to present this to Cabinet?<br />
PM: W~ ell, we will be having a Cabinet tomorrow in the normal way,<br />
but what this would call for is not a Cabinet discussion?<br />
Q. Sir, personally, do you feel optimistic about the outcome of<br />
this<br />
PM: Oh, I am not going to speculate on the future. Sorry, I just can't<br />
speculate on this one.<br />
Q. Can you say anything now about the Fill? Remember you were<br />
asked yesterday and you said<br />
PM: No, I'm sorry I can't. But Mr Fairhall is coming up here. He<br />
Will probably be able to say something about it. He has indicated to me<br />
that he will be getting reports from the United States authorities on<br />
whatever it was that happened. Nobody seems to be quite sure yet what<br />
it was. Thank you. </p>
