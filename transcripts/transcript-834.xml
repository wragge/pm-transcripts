18th October. 1961<br />
Speech by the Prime Ministers th~ Rt. Hon. -Sir Robert&amp; Meze<br />
Well Sir, I am bound to say that this is a<br />
singularly unbalanced audience. If I look at that part of it.<br />
I have to turn my back on the others, so I will address mysell<br />
to a most dubious collection of Parliamentary colleagues in front<br />
of me. I am bound to say that I envy my colleague the Minister.<br />
He has publicly stated that he has a split personality. All I want<br />
to tell him is that that will come in mighty handy if he is ever<br />
charged with ~ pmicide. There is another thing that just struck me since<br />
I arrived and sat down and that is that there is a cunning arrangement<br />
on the 3hop just across the alleyway here. I suppose it was<br />
put there by intelligent anticipation to remind us all that there<br />
is an election coming on because I can see nothing but references<br />
to pies, whether they're in the sky or not I dcnlt know and<br />
cakes, and this, I think, is a stimulating thing for all of us<br />
to see. I am sorry that my Parliamentary colleagues have their<br />
backs to it. The third thing I want to say is that for some<br />
inscrutable reason I have had to open quite a number of buildings<br />
in my time and I have always been warned, " Now be very careful<br />
to declare it open because otherwise it won't be open." Well my<br />
Job today is purely retrospective because it is open, and it Is<br />
in use and they're all working, so I suppose, Gordon, what I do<br />
is to declare it retrospectively open, and so I do.<br />
One of the interesting things about this building<br />
is that up to now a variety of Commonwealth Departments have been<br />
installed in what, 12 or 13 or 11+ different places in the city<br />
and this, of courseg is the largest city in Au-stralia and a<br />
tremendously important one and from the point of view of the<br />
public convenience, of getting in touch with Departments, people<br />
who want to see one Department and perhaps want to see two or three,<br />
it is a wonderful thing to have them concentrated in this fashion<br />
in one building in the very heart of the city and therefore this<br />
is, not only from the point of view of the Commonwealth, but from<br />
the point of view of the citizens of this place, a very'happy<br />
event. It is a formidable addition to the city of Sydney and<br />
St is a formidable addition to the convenience and well-being of<br />
he people who live here. Therefore this is a notable event.<br />
Now my colleague made a glancing reference just<br />
now to " civil servants". I have always got into the habit of<br />
calling them " civil servants" and I am told I ought to say<br />
" iPublic servants". Anyhow I will continue to call them " civil<br />
servants". You knowt I am so 00ld and de crepit a s everybody<br />
knows nowadays, that I can remember a time when it was rather a<br />
point of honour in any club, or places where men meet together,<br />
to make some rather adverse comments on these wretched civil<br />
servants, the bureaucrats, and yet whenever I come to one of these<br />
gatherings where businessmen of great eminence are to be seen, I<br />
see former civil servants who are now most eminent in private<br />
enterprise and in general business very well regarded and much<br />
sought after, and I think it is quite true that all this silly<br />
old prejudice has gone. I remember many years ago an amusing<br />
friend of mine saying to me " You know there is one thing you<br />
must always remember about Lhe civil service, it provides a level,<br />
a level of ability and competence below which no Government can<br />
sensibly fall." Now you think about thatq that has a world of<br />
oeosooeoe/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
truth in it. It is not the function of the civil service to<br />
govern the country, It is the function of the civil service to<br />
contribute all it has in talent and study and experience in giving<br />
effect to the Policies of the country which are hammered out by<br />
people elected by the electors of the country, and therefore, the<br />
function of tt~ e civil servant is a very high and responsible one,<br />
a very objective one and speaking as one who has been a Minister<br />
for , oh, more years Lhan the locusts have eaten, and Prime<br />
Minister for far more years than one or two of my friends here<br />
would desire, I want to say that nobody could be more indebted<br />
than I am to the high standards of the great work of the civil<br />
service and indeed nobody could be more indebted to them than<br />
the people who engage in production and selling, commerce and<br />
transportation, in this country, because every day they have some<br />
occasion to have some contact with them.<br />
Somebody once coined a phrase; it is now quite<br />
shop-soiled. He said with all the air of novelty " What we want<br />
is more business in Government and less GovernmenZ in business."<br />
This is one of those delightful cliches that is to be regarded<br />
now, as I think, something of a curio, because my experience not<br />
a brief one, has been that for the most part, when people gel<br />
into difficulty, when they have some problem which affects the<br />
future of their own enterprises something happens and some<br />
politician is put in receipt of their views on the matter and<br />
some Government or other is asked -to do something about it. So<br />
that, let's face up to it, w-i have reached a stage of life in<br />
Australia in which the whole essence of life is that there should<br />
be not hostility between public administration and private business<br />
but the utmost of co-operation between the two; the utmost of<br />
mutual Lunderstanding between the two and I assure you that in<br />
dealing with the civil service, and Lhis goes for civil servants<br />
wherever they may' be, Commonwealth or State in Australia, you're<br />
dealing with a mass of people, the ovexwt-L-ming bulk of whom are<br />
honest, objective, public-spirited people and here in this<br />
building we will have concentrated a very great number of them.<br />
The only other thing I would like to say to you<br />
because a lot of men here are very distinguished in private business,<br />
in seats of learning and in other aspects of the community and<br />
it is this: " We have a constant danger of adopting what might be<br />
called " false dichotomy". Everything is black or it is white.<br />
If you are on my side in politics perhaps you think I am pretty<br />
good; nothing to be said against me. Well I say that with<br />
modified rapture. If you're against me then of course, there is<br />
nothing good to be said for me. I am all black. Whereas, of<br />
course, the trouble is that we, most of us, are grey some of us<br />
in the hair but all of us in our attributes and qualifications.<br />
We are neither black nor white, we are just ordinary people and<br />
therefore we have something to be said for us and something to<br />
be said against us. This is fair enough, but one of the choices<br />
that we seem to have been offered in the past is this. It is<br />
said that some expenditures in the country, those administered<br />
by public departments are in the public sector and others are in<br />
the private sector. This is one of those jargon-like phrases that<br />
economists delight to invent it is the public sector or the<br />
private sector, Gentlemen, I venture to say with all my belief in<br />
the expansion of genuine personal and private enterprise in this<br />
country I wnture to say that it just could not happen without<br />
the public expenditure that goes on to a very large extent and<br />
at great expense in this country. What are these things that<br />
are administered by some people in this building and by some<br />
people who are engaged in public affairs the provision of<br />
0 S 0 0 * 0 ./ 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
water, the provision of power, the provision of light, or roads,<br />
of schools all these things which provide the very foundation<br />
on which normal enterprise may build and be strong, and therefore,<br />
I beg of you, put all these false conflicts on one side. W~ e in<br />
Australia are a very considerable nation* We can be a much more<br />
considerable nation as time goes on. WIe will become that the<br />
more rapidly and the more surely if we understand that is is not<br />
one man against another, it is all men together for this coun~ try,<br />
that co-operation is much more important than hostility. Of<br />
course there will be some hostilities, not necessarily personal<br />
hostilities political hostilities of the first kind arise from<br />
differences in points of view and that is very good. That's the<br />
democratic process but don't line up the ordinary citi: en against<br />
government or ordinary business against the civil service administrators,<br />
because tUhis is the right way to produce the wrong<br />
results. This task that we all have is a task of co-operating,<br />
not dependently, not subserviently, but with full vigour full<br />
capacity to express our own views, but in the long run, t<br />
co-operate for the achievement of the great national result and<br />
therefore don't let us have a feeling that a civil servant Is a<br />
curious fellow, detached and almost monastic, except for his<br />
alleged devotion to idleness. Don't let us fall into the error<br />
of pursuing that kind of idea, and don't let us fall into the<br />
error of thinking that wnaat Governments do in works in development,<br />
in the nation, is irrelevant to what must be Aone by<br />
thousands of other people, to build on those foundations to put<br />
them to effective use and thereby to improve the production, the<br />
distribution the commercial activities of the country, the<br />
tran'sport aciivities of the country, so that we may have more and<br />
more people, more 3nd~ more to do, and more and more real power<br />
in our own country, Ncw, I am sorry to take up your time by getting<br />
rather " into the pulpit" on this matter, but to tell you the<br />
truth, I have looked around here and I have seen so many of you<br />
before, I have tried to remember what I said to you last time<br />
and, mercifully, I can't, and I know anyhow you have all come<br />
along here, not to have a look at me, but to have a talk with<br />
each other, have a crack at both sides in the political contest<br />
and, with a little bit of luck, though I don't trust my Minister,<br />
have a drink at the end.<br />
I retrospectively declare the building open0 </p>
