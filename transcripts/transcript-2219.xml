COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
VIETNAM<br />
( Mfiisterial Statement)<br />
( From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 22 April 1970]<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
-by leave-Since 1965, Australian ground<br />
formations have been engaged with our<br />
allies in resisting armed attack on the Government<br />
of South Vietnam. Since that time,<br />
the question of whether Australian forces<br />
should have helped resist that attack has<br />
been debated in Australia. This Government,<br />
as previous governments, has<br />
approached this question in the spirit which<br />
was crystallised in one sentence by the right<br />
honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr<br />
Gaiwell) when he was Leader of the Opposition.<br />
That sentence is:<br />
The overriding issue which this Parliament has<br />
to deal with at all times must be<br />
judged by this one crucial test: What best pro.<br />
motes our national security, what best guarantees<br />
our national survival.<br />
The Government believes that judged on<br />
this standard, our engagement in Vietnam<br />
is right and that it does best promote our<br />
national security, and we believe that for<br />
these reasons: It is surely incontrovertible<br />
that in Vietnam aggression is taking place<br />
and is being resisted. It is surely incontrovertible<br />
that the war there is only being<br />
sustained because large numbers of troops<br />
from North Vietnam are constantly dispatched<br />
to invade and subjugate the South,<br />
15004/ 70 and that if that troop flow stopped the war<br />
would stop. Resistance to such aggression<br />
does best promote our national security,<br />
because we must strive to ensure that history<br />
is not repeated and that invasion and<br />
aggression is not allowed to be successful.<br />
For if it is successful, then the short span<br />
of history through which many of us in this<br />
chamber have lived shows that once<br />
successful, it is repeated and repeated until<br />
it becomes insufferable and has to be<br />
stopped-but stopped at a cost in blood<br />
and treasure infinitely greater than would<br />
have been the case had it been stopped at<br />
its initiation.<br />
Surely something of what happened in<br />
the last generation can be taken as experience<br />
by the present one. We saw Fascist<br />
and Nazi aggression raging unchecked and<br />
subjecting one small country after another<br />
to conquest until it had to be stopped-at<br />
the cost of a world war-which need not<br />
have happened had the aggression been<br />
stopped at its beginning. I thought that these<br />
lessons, which, let us never forget are of<br />
more import to small nations than to large,<br />
had been learned. Because for some years<br />
after the close of the Second World War,<br />
resolute action was taken to resist and<br />
defeat subversion in Malaya as it then was. </p>
<p>This took some 12 long years or moreyears<br />
when civilians were murdered by<br />
terrorists-when bands of guerillas with<br />
grenades and Sten guns sought to overthrow<br />
by force a government the people<br />
in Malaya wanted. Australians were there,<br />
with British and local forces, resisting that<br />
aggression. We were told then-and the<br />
words are strikingly familiar today: ' Australians<br />
should not be in Malaya. The war<br />
will go on forever. It cannot be won'. But<br />
it was won. That aggression was not successful<br />
and Australia's national security was best<br />
promoted because of that lack of success.<br />
Then we saw aggression in Korea. We<br />
saw the people of the North sweep across<br />
the frontiers of the South in armed formations.<br />
Because the prevention of aggression,<br />
then, was the basic concept of the United<br />
Nations, we saw United Nations forces<br />
moving to defeat that aggression. Australians<br />
were there. And the aggression was<br />
defeated. And Australian national security<br />
was best promoted because it was defeated.<br />
We saw, and the principle is the same,<br />
Malaysia threatened during the confrontation<br />
and armed incursions into Malaysian<br />
territory. Australia helped to repel this<br />
aggression. And our national interest was<br />
best served by this. And then we saw the<br />
pattern repeated in Vietnam. It is Communist<br />
aggression there as it was in Korea<br />
and Malaya, but the source of the aggression-<br />
significant though it may be-is not<br />
as significant as the fact that it was<br />
aggression. For the Government believes<br />
that if small nations are to survive and<br />
prosper, then aggression from whatever<br />
source-whether it is inspired by Communism,<br />
Fascism or old fashioned<br />
nationalism-must not be allowed to<br />
succeed. The one consistent thread of principlethat<br />
small nations are best rendered secure<br />
if other small nations are not allowed to be<br />
overrun-has distinguished our policv<br />
through the post-war years. That is why<br />
we are in Vietnam, and that we should be<br />
there is a proposition supported by three<br />
of the significant political parties in Australia<br />
and opposed by one-the Labor<br />
Party. I put it to the House that Australian<br />
security is bound up with seeing that<br />
aggression does not succeed. I put it to the<br />
House that it is immoral to launch<br />
aggression but not immoral to resist it. This is a proposition which has been twisted<br />
and turned inside out by those who cry<br />
that this is an immoral war. So it is-but<br />
the immorality is in those who began it,<br />
who continue to invade, who will not<br />
negotiate for peace, who are bent on conquest<br />
and nothing but conquest.<br />
We have said that successful invasion of<br />
South Vietnam by the North would lead to<br />
further attempts at conquest in Laos, in<br />
Cambodia, and on the frontiers of Thailand.<br />
This was scouted and denied by those in<br />
the ranks of the Opposition who support the<br />
case of the invaders. But the history of<br />
recent days shows, I submit, how dangerously<br />
wrong they were. Sir, I have thought<br />
it necessary to speak of this background<br />
in discussing the latest decisions on our<br />
participation in Vietnam. It was and is right<br />
for us to help to stem aggression. It was and<br />
is in our national interest-and that of all<br />
small nations-for aggression to be<br />
defeated. It is in our interest to help to<br />
secure by negotiation peace with selfdetermination<br />
for the people of South Vietnam.<br />
And in the meanwhile, while the<br />
invader will not negotiate, it is right to help<br />
resist him. Against this background, I speak<br />
to the House of the Government's decision.<br />
Following a review of the situation in<br />
Vietnam which led to the earlier<br />
United States decisions to reduce the level<br />
of its forces by 115,000 by the middle of<br />
this month, President Nixon yesterday<br />
announced his decision to introduce a new<br />
and long range programme of United States<br />
troop reductions involving the withdrawal<br />
of 150,000 men over the next 12 months.<br />
On 16th December last I announced the<br />
Government's decision that when the<br />
military situation in Vietnam permitted a<br />
further substantial withdrawal of allied<br />
troops, then somne Australian units would<br />
be included in the numbers scheduled for<br />
withdrawal. Since then we have, with South<br />
Vietnam and the other allies, continued to<br />
keep developments and prospects in Vietnam<br />
under close study. The Communist<br />
side maintains its intransigence and continues<br />
to set its face against a negotiated<br />
settlement. There is no progress to report<br />
as regards peace talks.<br />
As the President has stated, there has<br />
been some overall decline in enemy force<br />
levels in South Vietnam in the last few<br />
months, though their actions in Laos and </p>
<p>Cambodia must give us all cause for concern.<br />
The development that gives<br />
encouragement is the progress in what has<br />
been called ' Vietnamisation'-the movement<br />
towards South Vietnamese selfreliance.<br />
We see one result of this in the<br />
progressive reduction of allied forces. But<br />
it must be understood that ' Vietnamisation'<br />
means much more than the assumption by<br />
South Vietnamese forces of a greater share<br />
of the combat burden. Behind it lies a<br />
massive programme of expanding and<br />
modernising those forces. And behind that<br />
again is the progressive assumption by<br />
South Vietnam of the responsibility for all<br />
aspects of the war-a war fought across<br />
the widest fronts, embracing a complexity<br />
of military, political, psychological, social<br />
and economic factors. In all these areas<br />
much still remains to be done by South<br />
Vietnam, assisted by its allies across a wide<br />
civil and military spectrum. Yet progress<br />
has been such that important qualitative<br />
changes are being made, and will continue<br />
to be made, in regard to the assistance<br />
required by and given to the Government<br />
of South Vietnam in pursuit of the objective<br />
shared over the years by that Government<br />
and its allies.<br />
I reiterate that that objective is to<br />
establish the circumstances in which South<br />
Vietnam can determine its own future without<br />
fear. There can be no thought of<br />
abandoning that objective by a precipitate<br />
withdrawal of allied forces. But in continuing<br />
to give assistance to South Vietnam,<br />
our intention will be to take account of<br />
their own growing strength and to strike the<br />
most appropriate balance between an Australian<br />
military contribution and other<br />
forms of Australian assistance to Vietnam:<br />
We are mindful particularly that the process<br />
of ' Vietnamisation' obtains no less in<br />
Phuoc Tuy Province than in other parts of<br />
Vietnam and that it is both desirable and<br />
feasible for Australia to undertake, as the<br />
circumstances permit, qualitative changes in<br />
the shape of our overall contribution<br />
towards the goal we seek.<br />
Accordingly, I now announce to the<br />
House that after consultation in recent<br />
weeks with the governments of Vietnam and<br />
the United States, who understand and<br />
accept our approach, the Government has<br />
decided that one Australian infantry<br />
battalion and some supporting personnel will be withdrawn from South Vietnam.<br />
This reduction to our force in Vietnam will<br />
be effected by withdrawing, without replacement,<br />
the 8th Battalion, Royal Australian<br />
Regiment, which at present is scheduled to<br />
complete its tour of duty in November next.<br />
This will require a modification of the role<br />
at present played by our forces--a modification<br />
made feasible by the forces of Vietnamisation<br />
and national acceptance of<br />
responsibility by the Vietnamese themselves<br />
in Phuoc Tuy.<br />
But let no-one say that because there is<br />
a modification of the role we play therefore<br />
we should play no role at all. Reducing our<br />
forces because the Vietnamese are able to<br />
assume more responsibility is one thing.<br />
Totally removing our forces before the<br />
Vietnamese are able to accept full responsibility<br />
for replacing them is quite another.<br />
The timing of the battalion's departure<br />
from Vietnam remains to be determined. It<br />
will be governed by general circumstances<br />
within the area in which Australian forces<br />
are operating and by the progress of Australian<br />
projects to assist the growth of<br />
greater capability in the South Vietnamese<br />
forces, and I shall touch on those later.<br />
Whether or not the battalion's departure<br />
may be brought forward from the November<br />
date will depend on developments in<br />
these fields.<br />
After the initial withdrawal, should the<br />
progress of pacification and Vietnamisation<br />
succeed as the President hopes and believes<br />
that it will, then at some stage during the<br />
12-month period, we will consider phasing<br />
additional troops into the planned withdrawal.<br />
But the future situation is so uncertain<br />
and the future strategical situation<br />
so unpredictable that it is impossible to be<br />
any more definite than this. In co-operation<br />
with the Government of South Vietnam, in<br />
pursuit of our basic objectives, we are<br />
actively examining further ways in which<br />
we can contribute to the growth in South<br />
Vietnamese self-reliance.<br />
Following consultations with the Vietnamese<br />
Government, we have decided to<br />
provide a number of small mobile Army<br />
teams, totalling some 130 men, to work<br />
with the regional and popular forces in<br />
Phuoc Tuy province. The teams will have<br />
a liaison and training function and will<br />
operate on a pattern similar to that<br />
developed by some members of our existing </p>
<p>Army Advisory Training Group, which will<br />
continue its work. We are also developing<br />
a further proposal that Australia provide<br />
instructors and other assistance to a South<br />
Vietnamese training centre for junior leaders<br />
-leaders of the popular forces and regional<br />
forces-planned for establishment on the<br />
site which will be vacated by the Australian<br />
battalion to be withdrawn from Vietnam.<br />
It is envisaged that courses at this centre,<br />
which would accommodate 400 to 500<br />
students at a time, would give particular<br />
attention to instruction in methods of jungle<br />
warfare which have been developed by<br />
Australian forces. studies now being made of other forms of<br />
assistance which might be offered to Vietnam.<br />
Sir, I am glad to be able to tell the<br />
House and the people of Australia that the<br />
situation has been reached when withdrawal<br />
of some Australian forces can be made.<br />
I would be yet happier when all Australian<br />
forces could be withdrawn, provided that<br />
our object is in no way endangered. And<br />
I believe that history will show that Australia<br />
in Vietnam was right, as she was<br />
right in the other instances of which I have<br />
spoken, not to stand idly by and refuse to<br />
lift a finger to help a small country attacked<br />
from without. For whenever one small<br />
In addition, Cabinet will give urgent country loses its freedom let us not ask for<br />
attention to the results of comprehensive whom the bell tolls; it tolls for all.<br />
