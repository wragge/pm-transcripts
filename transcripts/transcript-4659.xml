PRESS INTERVIEW WITH PRIME MINISTER, SYDNEY. 25 March 1978<br />
QUESTION: Mr Fraser, what do you say to Mr Bjelke-Petersen' s<br />
claim that your Government is pursuing apartheid policies in<br />
the Northern Territory?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think it is complete nonsense. Everyone in<br />
Australia, I am quite certain, knows that it is nonsense. For<br />
a long while in the past there were very patronistic policies<br />
in relation to the Aborigines. White faces went around saying<br />
" This is what is good for you". The Federal Government has<br />
long believed that Aboriginal people should have as much right<br />
as anyone else to determine their own future to do it in the<br />
manner that they think is best for thems * elves. That is what<br />
it is all about. And the legislation Ian Viner has envisaged<br />
would give the Aboriginal people of Araukun and Mornington<br />
Island that right.<br />
QUESTION: The Premier says you have tried to divide Queensland<br />
into black and white states.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is just fanciful. It is nonsense.<br />
QUESTION: Where do you stand now in regard to the Aboriginal<br />
reserves in Queensland?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Exactly where Ian Viner indicated a few days<br />
ago. As you know the Uniting Church has been involved in<br />
Araukun and Mornington Island for a very very long while, and<br />
suddenly the Queensland Government says the Uniting Church is<br />
to move out and at the same time the State Department is going<br />
to take over. While this was against the wishes of the Church,<br />
it was against the wishes of Araukun and Mornington Island.<br />
And so we will be using our powers under the Constitution to<br />
enable the people to determine their own futures. </p>
