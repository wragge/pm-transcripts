    <content><![CDATA[<p>1 November 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
DOORSTOP FIVE DOCK<br />
SYDNEY<br />
JOURNALIST: The big concern isn't red tape, it's that the economy's at a stand still. What can you<br />
say to them to tell them when it's going to improve?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it's both the red tape and in some areas activity is lower than we would like, but<br />
it's patchy. There are some areas in the service industries that are doing very well.<br />
It's less buoyant in manufacturing. Mast of the economic forecasts suggest a Stronger<br />
level of activity next year. .1 have no doubt that some of the past reductions in interest<br />
rates, as they flow through, will help. And the benefit of the commu-unity having seen<br />
the Government produce a strong but fair budget and the knowledge that some of the<br />
other major reforms of the Government are comning through, such as industrial<br />
relations, all of those together over time will create a stronger climate, The other th ing<br />
working very much in favour of an improvement in activity is the relative strength of<br />
major overseas economies. The United States economy is in good strength. The<br />
Japanese economy is stronger and growing better, and the prospects are stronger than<br />
in the many other forecasts suggested a few months ago. And of course our own<br />
immediate region continues to grow very strongly. So you've really got a quartet of'<br />
optimism. You've got strong overseas situations, low inflation, low wages growth and<br />
an acceleration of the Government's own reform agenda. I think all of those together<br />
will create a generally more favourable climate. Thank you.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
But the confidence isn't there. You say over time, what are you going to do to kickstart<br />
it sooner<br />

<p>PRIMIE MINISTER:<br />
I don't accept, I don't accept that there is a widespread lack of confidence. I<br />
acknowledge that in some areas activity is not as great as people would like. And<br />
there's no gimmicky kick-start. Government's that engage in gimmicky kick-starts are<br />
always bound to disappointment and so are the people who think they may benefit<br />
from it, What you can do is lay proper foundations by attacking fundamentals, and<br />
we've done that. We've done that with the Budget, we're doing it with industrial<br />
relations reform and at a micro level we are doing it in relation to small business<br />
deregulation. JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible) . interest rates?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Lower official interests rates is a matter for the Reserve Bank, it's not a matter for me.<br />
I'm naturally pleased that in the household sector there are reductions in interest rates<br />
occurring $ 104.00 a mionth is the extent to which average home-buyers are better off<br />
in the last seven months but what happens at the official level is a matter for the<br />
Reserve Bank of Australia. 2<br />
