6 PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY OCTObER 25 1982<br />
ADDRESS TO THE CONFERENCE OF<br />
AUSTRALASIAN OBUDSMEN<br />
Thank you very much for the invitation to o. pe, this Sixth Conference of<br />
Australasian and Pacific Ombudsmen. We all have things other<br />
than our interest in Ombudsmen in which we share in common.<br />
We all share part of the Westminster system, and<br />
perhaps sometimes our critics don't understand the extent<br />
to which the system has evolved over the years, the extent<br />
to which it has grown and adapted to changing circumstances.<br />
There is no one particular thing which is the Westm-inster<br />
system because the practice has changed. and the institution<br />
has changed and evolved over the years. If somebody were<br />
sitting down to try and describe the Westminster system<br />
today, and you were comparing that with what the same person<br />
might have written, say, 50 years ago, the changes would be<br />
remarkable indeed?<br />
The development of the institution of Ombudsman is a very<br />
good example of the way in which The system grows, the<br />
way in which it expands, and the way in which it responds<br />
to different and emerging needs. Government in recent times<br />
has become increasingly complex and sometimes harder to<br />
understand. It often seems to be more impersonal. T'he role<br />
of government itself has expanded. Programaes of government<br />
are more pervasive and departments are larger. In these<br />
circumstances it is so easy for governments or for departments<br />
to become less responsive to individuals than they once were,<br />
and we need to always have in mind that government is not just<br />
for the powerful, it is not just for the organised, for people<br />
who know-how to get access to see leaders within a department,<br />
-or to see Ministers or even a Prime Minister. Government also<br />
needs to be pre-eminently for average citizens and for those<br />
who may not know how to get access to positions or to people<br />
who can influence events.<br />
The government, plainly, needs to be for everyone. It needs<br />
to be for the weak, and unless it is, we don't have established,<br />
a fair society. Now, the institution of the Ombudsman and the<br />
development of other administrative changes. are enormously<br />
important against this background, because so many of the<br />
changes that have been introduced in recent years, are designed<br />
to make sure that government, administration does remain<br />
sensitive to the needs, to the requirements or average<br />
citizens, and so many of the changes are designed to make<br />
sure that average citizens and not just the powerful can get </p>
<p>/ utu=-nen -2-<br />
justice to establish means and mechanisms which will enable<br />
them to get proper redress.<br />
In many ways, the institution of Ombudsman does make sure<br />
that government is responsible, accountable and fair. It does<br />
much to protect the rights of citizens. Professor Richardson<br />
mentioned Sweden as the home of Ombudsmen the early part of<br />
the last century, 1809, 1810. New Zealand I am told was the<br />
first of this particular conference to enshrine the institution<br />
of the Ombudsman. In 1977 of course, the first Cormmonwealth<br />
Ombudsman was appointed in a federal system, but now, like<br />
so many things, it is catching and there are eight Ombudsmen<br />
within this federal system.<br />
The contribution of the Commonwealth Ombudsman has been<br />
significant since the foundation in 1977. There were some<br />
who suggested that it would detract from Ministerial<br />
accountability, that it would get in the way of departments,<br />
sometimes it might have, and sor,,-eti.. es it should have. There<br />
are some who suggested that it would only be doing what<br />
doing what members of Parliament should be doing if they<br />
were adequately looking after the needs and requirements of<br />
their own constituents.<br />
Well, the task has been filled without prejudice to the role<br />
of Members of Parliament, and it certainly hasn't got in the<br />
way of Minister-ial responsibill-y. .1believe it is making<br />
departments more sensitive to the needs of their own people.<br />
I doubt very much if you would have the circumstances now<br />
as I did I won't say in which department -when there are<br />
complaints, you get a letter drafted in reply which says<br />
that the complaint has been examined and that there is no<br />
substance to it, with no argument, no explanation, nothing.<br />
That fact that that could ever occur I think emphasises the<br />
need for the institution of the Ombudsman.<br />
The institution helps government administration to be<br />
responsible, to be adaptive and to be sensitive, again,<br />
to the needs of average citizens. In Australia the nunber<br />
of enquiries have increased quite considerably. In 1981,<br />
there were about 11,500 oral enquiries, and nearly 3,000<br />
written enquiries, a significant increase over the year before.<br />
I don't think that should be surprising. I suppose at some<br />
point the number of enquiries will level off, but as more<br />
people understand that the institution is there, that it is<br />
there to be used, that if they believe they are suffering<br />
some wrong or injustice,-then they should seek redress.<br />
The number of enquiries indicates a growing acceptance<br />
by the public and the importance of the institution is<br />
also recognised by Members of Parliament. It complements<br />
their responsibilities. It can help to investigate constituents'<br />
complaints. I sometimes use the Ombudsman and see what comes<br />
up with the answer quicker the Ombudsman or normal departmental<br />
enquiries. I am not going to give the answer, but it would be<br />
an interesting one in relation to certain departments. It is<br />
a game that is sometimes worth playing if enquiries take too<br />
long in the making. </p>
<p>uflioua: 3man 3<br />
The complaints that are put before the Ombudsman, can clearly<br />
point to weaknesses within administration. Sometimes as I<br />
have indicated, it can conflict with administration. Sometimes<br />
there can be a change or a difference in interpretation between<br />
the Ombudsman and elements of the Public Service. I think in the<br />
early days, that was only natural, but in Australia, the<br />
institution has been established well, with the minimum of<br />
fuss, with the minimum of friction with departments, and<br />
overwhelmingly I believe that departments have co-operated<br />
with the institution and all have benefited as a consequence.<br />
It is normal, as you would well know, for problems to be<br />
resolved by consultation and by discussion, but the Governiment<br />
does have a continuing commitment -1-o reform. There is. an<br />
Ombudsman AL-endment Bill which was introduced in September<br />
which gives legislative backing to the informal enquiries<br />
of the Ombudsman to a situation so that oral complaints can<br />
be properly resolved so that there. will be a greater advisory<br />
discretion on the part of the Ombudsman and also to establish<br />
a souder-satutory b-ase ' or co-opcoration with State Ombudsmen.<br />
This is obviously of great importance within a federal system.<br />
In addition of course, we are establishing the Commonwealth<br />
Ombudsman also as the Defence Force Ombudsman. That . is a<br />
significant advance, a significant extension of the role of<br />
the Ombudsman in this country.<br />
We need to have in mind,' that while the Ombudsman is a very<br />
significant administrative advance against the background<br />
which I have mentioned of a larger and more comnplex administration,<br />
to guard against the dangers of insensitivity and remoteness,<br />
there are also other administrativc-changes which I think,<br />
have been of great importance. The Administrative Appeals<br />
Tribunal, the Administrative Decisions Judiciary Review Act,<br />
and they both work in their own environment and their own<br />
areas of responsibility. Collectively, they work with the<br />
Ombudsman to help individuals and to help protect the rights<br />
of individuals within Australia. When looking at administrative<br />
reform it is necessary to look at these three areas i. n. a sense,<br />
as one, because they complement each other and they are driving<br />
in the same direction, although with clear and defined, and<br />
very often quite separate areas of responsibility.<br />
In addition there is the freedom of information legislation<br />
which I know the whole Public Service is looking forward to<br />
with a great sense of joy and elation, but to provide some<br />
right of access to documents again, the right to enable<br />
citizens to be informed with obviously important exceptions,<br />
and hopefully to assist in making government more comprehensible<br />
and enabling some of the aspects of government to be open to<br />
greater public scrutiny. There are going to be other consequences<br />
of that change, of course. Our Ministers are suddenly being<br />
jumped with bits of paper which they never knew existed at<br />
Question Time, and how they -respond to them is something<br />
that Ministers themselves are going to have -to work out. It is<br />
also worth noting that freedom of information legislation is<br />
not the answer to all requests for information. I don't think<br />
one of those telephone book-thick sets of papers that John Howard<br />
tabled the other day would have got through if you had applied<br />
a freedo. m of information test. So, some : things being tabled </p>
<p>Ombudtsmen still will depend on the attitudes of governmrents rather than<br />
on the law itself.<br />
The community is responding to t1-hese reforms. Growing use is<br />
made of legislation. There is some criticisIM Of it of course.<br />
There will always be the constant argument that some want a<br />
faster pace of change, but for others, it has all happened<br />
too quickly, and a government's role in this is to steer<br />
a steady course, and not to put upon a complex administration<br />
a pace of change which puts unnecessary strains on the<br />
administration itself. We do need to understand, all of us,<br />
that the amount of work put upon the Public Service as a<br />
result of these administrative changes and as a result of<br />
the freedom of information legislation, is collectivel. y<br />
enormous and adds quite significantly to the staffing<br />
requirements of all departments.<br />
But there is still work to be done. The Review of Commonwealth<br />
Administration which I establishe-d a few w'. eekj-s ago is looking<br />
at other areas of the Public Service. We all know that<br />
there have been some areas where the delivery of services on<br />
the ground have broiken down, and there is no need, again to<br />
identify the areas. But I have the view that the service and<br />
the modes and mechanisms of operation of the service woul. d<br />
have developed in quieter and -more peaceful times when there<br />
weren't the stresses and the strains on the service as there<br />
have been on recent times. For examp~ le, 20 years ago, would<br />
any of us have believed that any entrepreneur, any businessman,<br />
no matter how disreputable, would conceive ofE a meat substitution<br />
operaticn that could run the risk1-of destroying Australia's<br />
entire export market for meat? Now, there is an attitude<br />
of people, of challenge, on the meat inspection service which<br />
nobody believed could arise. I think it would have been beyond<br />
our understanding, beyond our comprehension of 20 years ago<br />
to think th at that substitution scandal could have occurred<br />
with the consequences that might have been. It was only the<br />
swiftest action by the Department, by the Minister and by<br />
many people right throughout the Commonwealth that enabled<br />
Australia to retrieve a reputation. All of that was done<br />
very quickly. When they knew the danger, the Department<br />
responded magnificently. That was made very plain by the<br />
Royal Commission report, But so-mehow or other, we need tLo<br />
be able to get within the minds of people who want to challenge<br />
the system and chop off the opportunities before they arise,<br />
and that is the best way to protect administration.<br />
So the Review of Commonwealth Administration that John Reid<br />
is pursuing is not trying to look for faults, it is not trying<br />
to see what has gone wrong in one area or another, what it is<br />
seeking to do is see whether the service and the second division<br />
in particular, has available to it the management tools, the<br />
techniques, the equipment and the support that is necessary<br />
to not drag along behind the private sector and those elements<br />
of the private sector that would challenge proper administration,<br />
but rather to enable the Public Service to be so far ahead.<br />
Whether that is in relation to taxation or meat inspection or<br />
Customs or Narcotics Bureaux, 1 think the objective must be a<br />
thoroughly desirable one, and it is important that this k11ind of<br />
examination of the service be made. </p>
<p>It is something that wasn't done by the Royal Commission,<br />
by Dr Coombes. It is something that hasn't been done by<br />
any of the examinations of the service over recent times.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, the public h'as a perfect right to<br />
expect good and solid administration, and in all cases,<br />
to expect honest administration. We need to understand<br />
that government adiministration is larger and more complex<br />
than it ever was. That puts a challenge on all of uspeople<br />
within the Public Service, within government,<br />
the Ombudsmen, the institution of Ombudsman-because<br />
they all have a role to play in making Isure that the<br />
general public get what they have a right to, and what<br />
they deserve.<br />
I think the institution of the ombudsman has contributed<br />
very significantly over recent years to better administration<br />
in the particular areas where it has operated so effectively<br />
and as I believe, so efficiently.. I am sure that nothing.<br />
but good can come of the discussions that you will be holding<br />
over the next four or five days, because we are living in<br />
an evolving, changing situation. We are never going to be<br />
in a position in which all reforms are done and the world<br />
is perfect and there will be nothing for somebody,, else to do,<br />
because there will be challenges id difficulties and<br />
there will be a need for change as new challenges emerge.<br />
There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that a conference<br />
of this kind can help in unfolding, giving us some prior<br />
notice of what those challenges might be, of how governments<br />
should react. If there is a need for a change in law, then<br />
what ought it to be? If there is going to be a greater<br />
challenge on the institution of Ombudsman, then you of this<br />
conference will have a good opportunity to define what the<br />
future might hold.<br />
I wish you well, and have great pleasure in declaring this<br />
conference open.<br />
