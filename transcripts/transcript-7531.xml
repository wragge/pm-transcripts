PRIME MINISTER<br />
11k'fi-XCRLP-k OF IlEIRVIEW WITH QUERTN DEMOSTMR 1.30 REPoRT,<br />
1o M4ARCH 1~ 9<br />
i~ 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
DEMPSTER: Priime Minister a siciiv imprcvement on the<br />
current account deficit. Yiour -i-action please.<br />
VM: ia~ p icased i: hat 11-nas come i~ i Oi Leower end -of the<br />
.; anqe of E--Xectatioris Quentin. titpcrts are down which we<br />
w-, ant to see.. But there's nit room for roornpiacency.<br />
DEMPSTER: Do yiju s~ tand by yvour oredict lun In the ' Western<br />
Australi-an election that interc! ast rater will cone. downYA.<br />
Yes I was asked a ques tion to which the ans%-7er was<br />
obvious. I was asked " would interest rates come Jown before<br />
the end of the Year?"'. The ans~ er was yes anid it'ts z; till the<br />
answer. DEMP-: TFR: Well You can guarantee they'll be dow -n by the time<br />
your colleague, Wayne Goss, faces the people or Queensland in<br />
November?<br />
PM: Well what will happen to interest rates will be a<br />
function of the success ol our policy in lowering off the<br />
level of demand to reduce the demand for J., qports but at a<br />
level which will. still keep economic a-ctiv'ity going and<br />
employmenl.. if it works out as .1 expect it vili Ithn<br />
by that staae they'll be coming doi.. n b-ut I don't make<br />
immediate projections abouit it. lIt's tcot hel~ pful to anyone.<br />
DEMPSTER: Airiaht. Are the tax cuts still right tor July?.-<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
DEMP'STER: ; s Australia [ acing a recession?<br />
PM: No.<br />
DEMPSTER: A recent survey by Blue Chip Economic Indicators<br />
in the United States shows that 659 of ' Leading UJS economists<br />
beiieve a3 LS recession to be Imminent but most forecasts<br />
tagettinq the last quarter of 1989 and the first quarter of<br />
1990. It that is so Australia won't be able to avoid<br />
recession will we? </p>
<p>PM: I don't accept the accuracy of those assessments and<br />
indeed Quentin if you and I would sit here now and review the<br />
forecasts of economists, bot~ h international and Australia as<br />
to wohat was going to happen in the future you would show a<br />
picture of chaos. They very rarely get it right, and are<br />
well paid for not getting it right I might say. I have a<br />
reasonable degree of confidence the United States economy is<br />
going to keep going in 1989 at a reasonable head of steam and<br />
into 1990. What we've got to remember is -that the world has<br />
a vested interest in the United States economy going well and<br />
the rest of the world has shown a preparedness to co-operate<br />
with the United States. I think the critical issue Quentin<br />
in regard to the United States economy, is President Bush<br />
going to be prepared to take the sorts of decisions not<br />
fundamentally drastic decisions but get the debt position<br />
going the right way. I think the evidence is that he's<br />
prepared to do that.<br />
DEMPSTER: Why are you dithering on privatisation?<br />
PM: I'm not dithering on privatisation. The processes are<br />
under way in the Party to look at this. I've given a gentle<br />
indication I think it's a pretty important issue.<br />
DEMPSTER: Well it was on the agenda last year and off the<br />
agenda and now it's on again.<br />
PM: It hasn't been off the agenda. As a result of the<br />
initiatives that I took last year I think we got a decision<br />
by the Conference to establish these committees. I just<br />
wanted to let them know I think it's a pretty important issue<br />
they're dealing with.<br />
DEMPSTER: Well we're used to action in Queensland not just<br />
namby pamby it it's in the national Interest now, why<br />
not do it now?<br />
PM: Well I'm glad you make the point. The difference<br />
between my Government and what's happening in Queensland I<br />
operate in a democracy.<br />
DEMPSTER: Well that may be so but why not do it now if it's<br />
in the national interest?<br />
PM: I haven't got the power just to say, " bang" like that,<br />
as to what will happen. I'm serious in making a point about<br />
it. It's a democracy.<br />
DEMPSTER: I thought you were a statesman. You lead, the<br />
others will follow?<br />
PM: Yes but we do have a democracy. I cannot just say,<br />
" 1this is what will happen". T mean that's what characterised<br />
Queensland for a long time and look at the price you pay. </p>
<p>DEMPSTER: Couldn't you use the prest. Ige of the Prime<br />
Ministership, get the nervous nellies into the Lodge, give<br />
them tea and scones and twist their little arms?<br />
PM: I don't operate like thdt. I mean there might be some<br />
tea arnd for those who want something stronger, they might<br />
have some of that, but I'm quite happy with the way the<br />
processes are going.<br />
DEMPSTER: Will you be helping Wayne Goss by campaigning in<br />
Queensland in the forthcoming State election?<br />
PM: Well he's been kind enough to indicate that he regards<br />
me as an asset and I'd like to be up here. Let me say this,<br />
as you know because w.. e've known one another a long time<br />
I've got a longstanding love affaii with Queensland. And<br />
probably I've spent more time in Queensland, relatively<br />
speaking, than just about any other State. And I'll be here<br />
if he wants me and I'd certainly like to be here.<br />
DEM4PSTER: Can you give M4r Goss an assurance that you won't<br />
call an election before the scheduled November State<br />
elect ion?<br />
PM: That's very unlikely, very unlikely, very unlikely.<br />
DEMPSTER: Prime Minister, how much more of our prime<br />
coastal and rural land must we sell off to overseas?<br />
PM: Well of course the question of how much land within a<br />
State is sold off to overseas interests is a matter<br />
essentially for the States. But let me make this point and<br />
I say it directly to all moy friends here in Queensland<br />
which I hope really is everyone because they mightn't all<br />
agree with me but I hope they regard me as a friend, I regard<br />
them as friends but let me say this to the people of<br />
Queensland. The worst thing that we as the current<br />
generation of Australians with a responsibility for the<br />
future the worst thing we can do is to become<br />
nationalistic, xenophobic people who say we don't want<br />
foreign investment, particularly if we direct it at any one<br />
country. This country needs foreign investment, because we<br />
need it to develop the country and, most particularly we need<br />
it to increase those areas of strength,...... the<br />
manufacturing industry and in tourism..<br />
DEMPSTER: But it's into the property, it's beach front<br />
real estate and prime rural land.<br />
PM: But let me say this in regard to tourism. That's our<br />
biggest growing industry and the future of this country<br />
depends upon development which is going to provide jobs and<br />
income. Now that doesn't mean.. </p>
<p>DEMPSTER: But they buy the the Japanese particularl. y<br />
are buying the resorts, say, and they're repatriating the<br />
profit. They're one off sales and they're repatriating the<br />
profits, to back home.<br />
PM: If you want to get sue into an anti-Japanese campaign<br />
you've got the wrong bloke. Let me say this quite clearly.<br />
As far as Japan is concerned. it's our most important trading<br />
partner and that trade that very substantial trade, the<br />
two-way trade that we have with Japan is fundamentally<br />
important to the strength of this economy. And so both on<br />
economic grounds and moral grounds you are not going to find<br />
this Prime Minister discriminating against one nation<br />
DEMPSTER: So on foreign investment, in short, you won't<br />
stop. PM: No, I was just going to make the point if you would've<br />
allowed me, you'ye got to make the political distinction. We<br />
do have a Foreign Investment Review Board and we will invoke<br />
the national interest. Loo'k at the other day, for instance.<br />
Keating stopped a two hundred million dollar foreign<br />
investment aupplication, it happened to be from the Japanese,<br />
it wasn't because it was from the Japanese, in regard to a<br />
development in Sydney, because he said that was<br />
environmentally unacceptable. The difference between us and<br />
the Tories is this that we favour having a Foreign<br />
Investment Review B~ oard which will invoke the national<br />
interest. We've done it. Howard and the National Party say<br />
no Foreign Investment Review Board, " twe'll abolish it just<br />
, Free for all". Now that's the distinction. We will protect<br />
the national interests by having the appropriate institution.<br />
W~ e've demonstrated that. Our opponents won't.<br />
DEMPSTER: Prime Minister, thank you.<br />
PM: Thanks very much. </p>
