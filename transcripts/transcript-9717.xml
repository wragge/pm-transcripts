T1EL7: . Fiug. 95 21: 16 No. 022 PSTATEMENT<br />
BY THE P&amp; jfE MINISTER, THE HON PJ KEATING MP<br />
TED WHITTEN<br />
If you grew up In Sydney In the fifties and sixties you didn't hear much about<br />
Australian Rules but you heard about Ted Whitten.<br />
His fame went much further than Victoria. He was a great footballer but he<br />
was more than that he was a true working class hero.<br />
His character and courage made him an inspiration in Footscray and the west<br />
of Melbourne and a legend among football lovers everywhere.<br />
The world of Australian football has suffered a great loss with his death and<br />
3o has Footscray and Victoria.<br />
On behalf of the Government I extend my sincere sympathies to Ted's family<br />
and friends.<br />
