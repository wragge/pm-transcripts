TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
AND THE MINISTER FOR EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING, THE HON SIMON<br />
CREAN MP, PRESS CONFERENCE, FRANKSTON CULTURAL CENTRE, FRANKSTON,<br />
29 JANUARY 1996<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Thanks very much for coming along. What we have done here today with Young<br />
Australia is, again, another extension of the policies and the commitment we have had<br />
to the unemployed, the long term unemployed and the young unemployed. You may<br />
recall I said at the time of the last election that we wouldn't be leaving the unemployed<br />
behind. You know what happens in societies, that people who are particularly long<br />
term unemployed tend to drift towards the outer edges of the pool of unemployed<br />
persons and as the economy starts producing new jobs, the people who take them are<br />
the new entrants to the Labor force school leavers, migrants et cetera. So, these<br />
people in some countries are just completely sidelined, they are cast aside, they don't<br />
get their training back, they don't get their skills back, of course, they never get their<br />
esteem back, they don't have any experience so they stay unemployed.<br />
In the last 12 months we have had the biggest fall in unemployment on record and as I<br />
made clear and Simon Crean made clear today, we are now seeing unemployment<br />
amongst 15 to 19 year olds drop to 88,000 that is 88,000 of the age group of young<br />
people 15 to 19 which is 1 .3 million.<br />
In our initiative today in Young Australia, what we are doing is looking at the application<br />
of resources and new resources and fine tuning some of the programs we have had<br />
and trying to make some existing ones stronger. And what we are saying is that by the<br />
tumn of the century we should be at a position where every 15 to 19 year old will have<br />
the opportunity of a job or an education or training place. You know that with youth<br />
training initiatives in Working Nation, we have tried to get this focussed now on young<br />
people in years 11 and 12 looking at what they might do in the work force and getting<br />
some vocational training while they are in years 11 and 12. The Jobs Pathway<br />
Guarantee under which year 12 school leavers will have successfully completed<br />
vocational subjects while at school, will get a guaranteed job within three months of<br />
leaving and we will expand that by 12,000 placements per year in 1997/ 98.<br />
Perhaps I might just finish my remarks and invite Simon to open his. That is, that<br />
again this is a further commitment which the Govemnment has been working up now for<br />
months to focus another program of roughly $ 200 million towards this particular<br />
problem of young people and their job opportunities and seeking to get that<br />
unemployment rate down amongst young people 15 to 19 and much better streaming<br />
out of years 11 and 12 into work. Simon and I had the pleasure of launching the Youth<br />
Training Initiative in NSW about a year ago and we are starting to really see now,<br />
employers starting to find young people in years 11 and 12 and getting them vocational<br />
experience so that they can know that there is a career path for them. In fact, a couple<br />
of major companies have come our way actually now with shortages of skills in some<br />
places, looking in years 11 and 12 to get young people interested, give them some<br />
vocational training and get them started. </p>
<p>So, this is part of the general view the Government has had. That for those of the age<br />
of between 15 and 19, there is a period of vocational preparation and you know that<br />
when we took office, only three in ten young Australians completed year 12. This year<br />
it is around eight in ten. We have taken the number of university places from 320,000<br />
to 560,000 and we have now invested $ 1.5 billion into vocational education through the<br />
Australian National Training Authority and through our grouping arrangements with the<br />
States in TAFE. So, building the TAFE system up so that it can sit beside the<br />
universities as an alternative system and at the same time strengthening the<br />
traineeships where on the job training marks out a career path, plus the case<br />
management and all of the other things which have come with Working Nation and<br />
these changes mean that for the group 15 to 19 the transformation is quite profound<br />
compared to a decade ago when I might say, the last Coalition Government was quite<br />
happy to leave only three young people in ten completing secondary school. Any<br />
claims that they thought they might have had to a clever country, how can you have a<br />
clever country when seven out of ten young people didn't even complete secondary<br />
school? This is why all of this has been important, we think, for the transformation of Australian<br />
education and the opportunities for young people in that important age group of<br />
preparation 15 to 19. 1 will invite Simon to add to my remarks.<br />
SC: Thanks very much. I think that one thing that should be said that we have both been<br />
able to do that most countries can't do is to combine labour market programs with<br />
education programs and we have that ability because they are under one portfolio in<br />
this country. The Jobs Pathway guarantee in essence is no more than linking an<br />
existing labour market program with programs being offered through schools. But, by<br />
linking them, we can meet the question that many young people ask, will the training<br />
lead to a job. Many of the initiatives that we have announced tries to address that<br />
question, by a more effective linkage between what they do in schools, getting<br />
employers more committed to giving direction about what schools should provide and<br />
at the same time making a commitment to take them on. We have opened up the<br />
options by which employers can now employ. So, between the ABTS pathway, the<br />
Jobs Pathway guarantee, the part time traineeships and structured traineeships<br />
employers in this country now have the ability to take on someone on a regular basis in<br />
their employment for between one hour or full time a week. It is a huge flexibility that<br />
we are offering employers, so it is not just new options for young people enabling them<br />
to pursue their interests in a number of vocations that they have a passion about, be it<br />
the environment, the arts media entertainment, those sorts of areas. It is also about<br />
offering and encouraging wider choice and opportunity on the part of employers.<br />
The other point that I would make is that I have heard John Howard saying that his<br />
solution is that you free up small business and that creates the employment. Of the<br />
740,000 jobs created under this Government 70 per cent have been created by small<br />
business. Traineeships; now demanded by small business didn't exist before Working<br />
Nation, we set a target for Victoria of 1000 trainees in small business traineeships, it is<br />
now 1500. There have been 200 new traineeships; in this area already this year. So, lI<br />
believe we have got the product right, it is the reason why the demand for traineeships<br />
now is at record levels. We have a commitment in this document, not only to the<br />
34,000 traineeships that businesses will take on this financial year, but to build on that<br />
thereafter. You will see a little table in one of the press releases that indicates where<br />
that extra 17,000 traineeships might come from and they are all industry. They are all<br />
jobs which before Working Nation, simply didn't have a traineeship.<br />
You have heard Cindy today, she is one of many examples. Look at the statistics, 83<br />
per cent of people that go through a traineeship get a job. It is one of the most<br />
successful labour market programs, but it has not been widely enough available. It<br />
hasn't covered the industries in which the job growth has occurred and it hasn't been<br />
integrated back into the school area.<br />
Another salutary point, I think, is that if you look at the participation rates, there has<br />
been a slight drop in the participation rates in secondary school. I think this is a bit of a<br />
problem for us because it would appear that young people are seeking to chance their<br />
armn in the labour market because they see the opportunity has grown. But we know </p>
<p>the chances of being unemployed are twice as high for people who don't have the year<br />
12 equivalent qualifications than for someone who does. That is the reason why we<br />
simply have to make school much more relevant in providing options to young people<br />
to prepare themselves for the work place and these pathways go in that direction.<br />
Again, these initiatives aren't just about encouraging young people to take on vocations<br />
as employees, again, we have a major new initiative called Youth Enterprise Scheme<br />
the YES program which encourages them to set up in small business. I believe, that<br />
if there is a demand for small business skills, then it is clearly in evidence by the<br />
trainesships that we should be using the schools to more effectively prepare people to<br />
start their own business.<br />
I am confident that with the initiatives we have taken to date, the building on those<br />
initiatives that these programs represent, that the guarantees that we are making that<br />
by the turn of the century every 15 to 19 year old will have the opportunity of an offer in<br />
employment, in training or in education. That if we can get these initiatives together,<br />
we will achieve a target of five per cent unemployment for unemployed people seeking<br />
full time work. Again, it is our preparedness to set the targets, to back them with<br />
resources, to show that the programs have been worked and built upon, that<br />
distinguishes us in a very significant way from the Opposition.<br />
J: Prime Minister, you have identified your speech as the most important policy of the<br />
campaign what do you see as the other defining issues of the campaign?<br />
PM: I think the defining issues are the fact that we maintain a cooperative environment in<br />
Australia. That in the labour market where we have seen high productivity growth and<br />
low inflation and high employment growth, that that model of cooperation, of good<br />
spiritedness remains. That means commitments to people by the Government to run<br />
the economy faster than it otherwise would: to produce more employment than it<br />
otherwise would in return for a sensible wage outcomes and commitments to the<br />
unemployed. That is the model that my colleagues have worked on now for over a<br />
decade. It is a model that has given Australia 40 per cent more competitiveness than it<br />
had a decade ago. It has given us three times the rate of employment growth as their<br />
was under the Liberal's and it has given us twice the rate of economic growth. The<br />
commitment today is a commitment to social cohesion, it is a commitment to Australia<br />
moving on together, that one group will not be left out. The last group we want to see<br />
left out is young people.<br />
J: Are you promising with this commitment to create the precondition for negligible youth<br />
unemployment by the turn of the century?<br />
PM: What we are trying to do<br />
J: and if so ( inaudible)..<br />
PM: We are the only people in the business. You don't hear the Liberal Party talking about<br />
targets for unemployment. We are the people who are saying we want to get all those<br />
in the labour market looking for work down to around five per cent by the turn of the<br />
century. That is what we are about and that is why we put Working Nation into play.<br />
You will remember the assault Alexander Downer made on it, he said it was a waste of<br />
money and it was the exact fulfilment of an election commitment, not to leave the<br />
unemployed behind. As a consequence, with the job growth and the targeting of these<br />
programs and the case management, we have now got, I think and Simon may correct<br />
me, but I think we have got now 580,000 people who were this year case managed.<br />
that is 580,000 Australians younger and older Australians who were individually<br />
spoken to and with, who were part of a smaller group who were case managed back<br />
into training and work.<br />
It is that sort of commitment that has come from the Government, from the Labor Party<br />
that believes in the breadth of the Australian family. That is, we move on together, we<br />
take jobs together and if anyone falls off the trolley, we get them back onto it. That is<br />
what Working Nation is about. That is what these policies are about. </p>
<p>J: ( inaudible) is it simply an election pledge and if it is an election pledge, why are<br />
departmental staff being used and taxpayers funds..<br />
PM: This is something we have been developing for a long time and if the election had<br />
been called next weekend it would be a policy statement of the Government's like the<br />
environment statement was last week.<br />
J: So you see nothing wrong?<br />
PM: Well, the Parliament isn't prorogued until 6: 00pm this evening and no doubt you have<br />
had the Liberal's whispering that in your ear. Let me just say here we are trying to look<br />
after young Australians when Peter Costello is saying he will put criminal prosecutions<br />
against the Secretary of the Department of Employment, Education and Training for<br />
daring to facilitate the development of such a policy. It would be a lovely little<br />
government Mr Howard's government with his Shadow Treasurer threatening criminal<br />
prosecutions on the Secretary of department introducing the youth program,<br />
threatening artists yesterday in the Sunday Age, threatening the Australia Council.<br />
This is the nice, cuddly, warm, sweet government we would see.<br />
J: $ 171 million mentioned here is to be redirected from existing resources can you tell<br />
us what sort of existing programs might the Government..<br />
SC: $ 171 million is the combination of Working Nation programs for the next two years<br />
because it has only got two more financial years to run after this. Labor market<br />
programs in the forward estimates for the years thereafter and they ANTA funding in<br />
relation to the ASTF. So, this is money that is in the system. The ANTA funding, by<br />
the way, from an index growth which we allocate to national programs of<br />
significance. This is where we have highlighted it. It does not detract from the other<br />
growth funds that we are committed to provide to States provided they maintain their<br />
effort. So that is where the $ 171 million comes from.<br />
J: Sorry, there was one acronym there I missed.<br />
SC: ASTF, the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation, which is the body that has<br />
responsibility for the 15,000 places which was three times what the Working Nation<br />
target is. VECCI and the MTIA have committed themselves in New South Wales and<br />
Victoria to helping secure something like 5,000 of those. So this is a body which we<br />
have directly funded because we have tried to put pressure on the States to lift their<br />
game in terms of delivering vocational subjects on a broader scale in schools.<br />
We still expect them to do that and this statement clearly puts the pressure on them.<br />
But one of the leverages that we have had is this extra funding through the ASTF. The<br />
additional funding that we are committing today will enable workplace coordinators to<br />
be attached through schools to find the placements that business is looking for on the<br />
basis of delivering the training that business wants.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you have set your 5 per cent target for youth unemployment, which seems<br />
like quite an ambitious target. Are you saying there is no inherent difference between<br />
the youth labour market and the adult labour market which can contribute to youth<br />
unemployment being naturally somewhat higher?<br />
PM: I think there may be. The obvious one is lack of any work experience. People 15 to 19<br />
are joining the labour market for the first time and I might add just bear in mind that 3/ 4<br />
million of them, in that group, face a new employer every year in the group 15 to 24<br />
3/ 4 million and, of course, under the Coalition, even under their stated policy, they<br />
would have no award protections whatsoever. They would have to go out and<br />
negotiate with an employer all by their lonesome and take what comes.<br />
J: Also, they sometimes want to change jobs more.<br />
PM: That is right.<br />
J: And that will remain surely? </p>
<p>PM: That is right. They will want to change jobs more. It is what is called frictional<br />
unemployment people between jobs. But the main thing is to try and deal with the<br />
group and in the most substantial way what we have sought to do is to increase<br />
dramatically the completion rates in secondary school which, as I have said, has gone<br />
from three in ten to just under eight in ten today. And in that way we have set young<br />
people up better than they would have been set up in days gone by.<br />
J: Mr Keating, who are these big profitable companies who aren't pulling their weight in<br />
terms of youth traineeships?<br />
PM: Well there are stacks of companies who, if they did what some other companies have<br />
done, we would be making very large inroads into unemployment amongst this group<br />
of young people and not only that providing, you know, a group to source employment<br />
from for meeting the needs of these companies. And, of course, under the<br />
government's policies we help them as well.<br />
So it is just really a matter of trying to get companies interested in the traineeships.<br />
We have got many already interested and we have made substantial inroads already.<br />
But we need more. If we could double it, we would make a very big difference.<br />
J: Are you prepared to name the ones who you think are not doing their bit?<br />
PM: Oh well what is the point in that. I mean go and get me the Business Council list and<br />
do you want me to tick them off for you? I might meet you on the footpath later and go<br />
through that.<br />
J: Prime Minister, this Labor campaign is built around leadership your leadership in<br />
particular that makes you pretty important. Can you now give us a guarantee, in that<br />
context, that you will stay on for a full term if you are re-elected?<br />
PM: Look, Glenn, I have been in public life for 26 years. I am in my 27th year. I have been<br />
asked this question by journalists all the way through. In 1980, will you be staying after<br />
we lost the 1980 election and at other times. My commitment is to another term of<br />
office and beyond.<br />
But I do want to see a continuing change of personnel in the government and I said the<br />
other day, it is worth repeating, in 1983 the average age of the Labor Ministry was 47.<br />
13 years later it is still 47. It is 47 because there has been such a turnover of people<br />
and a lot of younger Ministers joining the Ministry. And so it is had the energy that that<br />
displacement brings you and it has had, I think, also the long straight lines of logic and<br />
policy directions coming from the leadership myself included and the experience<br />
which has come from senior Ministers who have been involved.<br />
I mean Simon joined the Ministry as formerly President of the ACTU and not long<br />
thereafter the Cabinet. So we have always added to the stock of our common<br />
knowledge and our experience and that is why the government is so focussed and has<br />
been so effective. I mean this government has changed Australia from an industrial<br />
backwater essentially going nowhere, industrial archaeology, rust-belt industries, no<br />
linkages to Asia, falling employment, double digit unemployment and double digit<br />
inflation. That is where we were. Look at it today. It is a transformation, a massive<br />
transformation that has come by one thing leadership.<br />
J: Another personal term in office, are you saying, Mr Keating?<br />
PM: Well I don't have a shadow, Michelle. There is no one else there. I am not Dorian<br />
Gray with a picture. I mean who jumps out of the frame and does it for me.<br />
J: Mr Keating, the Coalition often charges that the whole youth training and the numbers<br />
that you put forward of those training that smoke and mirrors, it is about hiding the<br />
unemployed. Youth groups too say that they are not trying instant training without the<br />
guarantee of a job. I mean if you are talking about offering companies access to<br />
schemes that will allow up to one hour training week. I mean what use is that to young </p>
<p>people and what is your guarantee to young people in terms of full time training leading<br />
to full time work?<br />
SC: In terms of offering the one hour a week to an employer, we wouldn't expect that that is<br />
the limit of the commitment to the young person. You will see in this set of initiatives<br />
that we have expanded funding for group training companies. I happen to believe<br />
group training companies have a major ongoing role to play. They are already<br />
interested in contracting for the eight pilots under the Jobs Pathway Guarantee.<br />
But, essentially, what you do through a group training company is the company<br />
becomes the employer. So a small business looking for flexibility to suit seasonable<br />
patterns or, you know, weekly requirements doesn't actually do the employing, it<br />
contracts from the group training -company. The group training company's<br />
responsibility is to pay the award base rate of pay, to access the subsidies where they<br />
are available and to deliver training. So what we are trying to do is to match up again<br />
that structure that is group training to deliver the linkages. So that whilst we are<br />
offering employers the ability to employ someone for as little as one hour a week, the<br />
person who would be employed through the group training company would be<br />
employed full time through a traineeship.<br />
J: Prime Minister, there was a young unemployed person quoted in The Age this morning,<br />
I think, prior to this launch saying that they had never experienced a Liberal<br />
government, so they might give them a go. Does that loss of political memory worry<br />
you and how do you counter it?<br />
PM: Well they will give them a go by junking Working Nation for a start because Mr Costello<br />
said that he would cut the commitments under Working Nation. They will give them a<br />
go by, as Mr Howard said in 1992, one of the reasons why over 30 per cent of our<br />
young people are out of work is because youth wages in this country are too high.<br />
They will give them a go by 3/ 4 million of them every year facing an employer for the<br />
first time and having to fend for themselves without the protections of the award<br />
system or the Arbitration Commission. That is the sort of go they will get.<br />
They would very quickly find out what a harsh little world Mr Howard has in store for<br />
them and that is why, I think, when these issues have come under focus at very<br />
elections people always think twice. The thing about the Liberals is they have opposed<br />
this style of Australia for years a cooperative model where people are brought in, an<br />
inclusive model.<br />
They have taken the view that it is basically a survival of the fittest operation is the best<br />
one. And the commitments like we are making in Working Nation to training, to case<br />
management, to traineeships, they regard as so much dross along the way, which can<br />
be cut away for a neater budgetary outcome. They simply don't have the<br />
compassionate commitment to those who are unemployed and particularly the young<br />
people and we have seen that right through the period.<br />
J: Do you accept that the young people are being attracted to some of the minor parties,<br />
to the Green parties, those kind of special interest parties that are appealing to the<br />
young?<br />
PM: Well some are I think. But, again, as I said the other day on the big issues. Just take<br />
those two big issues of last week. The environment. It is only a party of government<br />
that is going to change the environment. You know before Christmas we put away six<br />
million hectares of forest in Deferred Forest Areas. It must be the biggest policy<br />
undertaking of its kind in any country of the world. Last week, we announced<br />
commitments to a National Reserve System, even buying back those bits of private<br />
land which are important to those Reserve Systems. Putting further commitments into<br />
the Murray-Darling system. Dealing with degradation of the landscape and salinity.<br />
These things can not be done by Independents and the only party in Australia<br />
interested and committed to that course of action is the Labor Party. It has been the<br />
only one. </p>
<p>7<br />
Take nuclear weapons. Alexander Downer said it was a stunt when I announced the<br />
Canberra Commission for the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons. There are 50,000<br />
nuclear warheads lying around those arsenals in the world rotting. We say that nuclear<br />
weapons are no longer a viable military option and that they don't serve a viable<br />
strategic purpose and we are better without them, that the world is safer without them.<br />
Those initiatives can only be undertaken by a government and that is why, I think<br />
while some young people may look at Independents in the end they will come back to<br />
the party which does care about the issues they care about and that is a better world, a<br />
safer world, a more secure world, a cleaner world, a better environment to live in and a<br />
premium on their own importance through employment etc.<br />
J: It would seem though that the polls aren't going your way. So all these initiatives that<br />
you have announced in the past few months are not washing with the electorate. How<br />
are you going to turn that around?<br />
PM: But are they working?<br />
J: Well they are not being..<br />
PM: But have they got intrinsic worth and value like today's? Of course they do. Of course<br />
they do and I mean we have seen this phenomena after elections have been called in<br />
the past where the poll has shifted against the government. Well that just means we<br />
have got to work in the course of the campaign to tell our story and to get the<br />
differences up closely.<br />
At this stage, I can't even get Mr Howard into a debate. He won't be in the debate next<br />
Sunday. He is saying, " look, I will debate the Prime Minister anywhere". Andrew Robb<br />
says, " I won't make the arrangements." He says, " I will debate the Prime Minister<br />
anywhere". Andrew Robb says, " I won't make the arrangements". They don't want to<br />
debate and basically what they are now saying is I am saying, look, let's have a<br />
debate next Sunday with the national broadcaster as we have had in every election<br />
campaign since one can remember. And they are now making these points of<br />
technical objection about who it might be. Well I don't care who it is as long as it is<br />
nominated by the national broadcaster.<br />
So the fact of the matter is that until the Liberal Party faces up to the fact that it can't<br />
hide all the way, it has tried to run past the media now for a year and that it can't hide,<br />
that it has got to expose its philosophy and that will be exposed best under scrutiny and<br />
in debate and when these things happen I think we will have reasonable opportunities<br />
to not only put our policies but put our arguments too.<br />
J: inaudible].. where do you think you are going to have to work hardest, which<br />
States?<br />
PM: Oh I just think overall, Peter. It is a national media so overall.<br />
J: Yesterday you spoke about economic commentators being a bit cavalier about the<br />
choice because the economy is in good shape. Do you believe that the biggest threat<br />
to the government is a view in the electorate that things are pretty good and that it is a<br />
safe time to make a choice?<br />
PM: Well it will just all fall away. It will just all fall away. The whole cooperative model will<br />
fall away, the inflation rate will get away from us, the competitiveness will get away<br />
from us, the wage market would be chaotic again, the labour market and..<br />
J: Do you acknowledge that attitude and is it the biggest problem for the government?<br />
PM: Well I am saying I think it is more an attitude of mind amongst commentators than it is<br />
in the community. That is, they have always been very careful, the Australian<br />
community, and reasonably so. When it comes to policies of importance that affect<br />
them and who runs the national government of Australia, affects them very closely. </p>
<p>8<br />
So all of the great reformation of the economy, the social policies, the big block<br />
changes like Medicare, or the participation in education, or cooperation in the labour<br />
market, or the leap into Asia, the linkages to the bilateral and multilateral linkages in<br />
Asia, all the things that are going to give us jobs and growth and security in the future,<br />
they are going to think about who manages those.<br />
J: Prime Minister, this morning John Howard has pledged to cap movements at<br />
Kingsford-Smith at 80 movements per hour, to extend the noise proofing program and<br />
also to have an EIS for Badgerys Creek, effectively putting that off further. Isn't that<br />
going to make it harder for you to hold onto seats, like Lowe and also places like<br />
Macarthur as well?<br />
PM: Well he is worried about his seat in Bennelong. He has been worried about it all along.<br />
Here he is, he is leading a national election campaign and what is he worred about, his<br />
own seat of Bennelong. He wants to cut Kingsford-Smith's capacity by 40 per cent, the<br />
gateway to Australia, the principal airport, the airport upon which our tourism industry<br />
depends. He wants to cut it back and he wants to cut it back by opening up traffic on<br />
the east/ west runway and over those electorates of Barton and Watson and<br />
Kingsford-Smith so that he can relieve what he sees to be the traffic coming over his<br />
own electorate.<br />
Bearing in mind, that he was all the time at the government to build the third runway.<br />
Over and over again saying it was an absence of political courage that the government<br />

the first to run away from it.<br />
He talks about microeconomic change, he talks about the brave new world of<br />
microeconomic change under him. The biggest micro change in air transportation in<br />
Australia is that third runway and the first time he runs into electoral pressure, he<br />
abandons it.<br />
J: Prime Minister, what is in this for people from non-English speaking backgrounds in<br />
your Young Australia policy?<br />
PM: Well, generally, those who are disadvantaged come more obviously under the eye of<br />
case managers. But many young Australians of that period, of course, have been bom<br />
here and they have picked up the language. It is only with young people of that age<br />
group who have come as migrants, or some may have some very obvious language<br />
disabilities, in which case we have all the English language training courses. But, by<br />
and large, it is the case managment, the fact that we have got one person dealing with<br />
a limited number of people, getting to know them and understand them, being the most<br />
important element of the Job Compact we announced with Working Nation and with<br />
these policies too.<br />
