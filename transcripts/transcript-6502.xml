    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>15 OctoberÂ 1984</strong></p>
<p>On Budget night the Ministers for Social Security, Health,Â and Veterans' Affairs, announced a new home and communityÂ care program, which will provide a more comprehensive rangeÂ of intergrated home and community care services targettedÂ primarily at the frail aged and younger disabled people.</p>
<p>It it proposed that the new program be cost-shared with theÂ States and Territories. An additional $ 10 million has beenÂ provided in the 1984-85 Budget to be available on an unmatchedÂ basis from January 1, 1985 to those States and TerritoriesÂ which have reached agreements with the Commonwealth. SubjectÂ to these agreements the Commonwealth's contribution to the newÂ program will be more than $ 300 million over the first three years.</p>
<p>In order to advance the discussions as quickly as possible,Â a high-level team has been established, headed by Mr E. Visbord,Â a Deputy Secretary in my Department. The team's task willÂ be to seek to arrive at draft agreements with the states onÂ the financial arrangements which are required to put the newÂ program in place. I have written to the State Premiers and theÂ Chief Minister of the Northern Territory seeking theirÂ assistance in expediting these negotiations.</p>
<p>The negotiating team will conduct these financial negotiationsÂ with the States during the forthcoming Federal election periodÂ and will report to the incoming Government in December.</p>
<p>I envisage that following the election, detailed discussionsÂ on the composition of the program and administrative arrangementsÂ will be conducted by the responsible Minister. This willÂ include consultations with service providers and users.Â Arrangements for these consultations will be announced by the Â appropriate Minister in the incoming Government. The finalÂ shape of the program will not be determined until theseÂ consultations have occurred.</p>
<p>Arrangements are also being made at this time to give effectÂ to a program to provide home help for veterans which wasÂ also announced on Budget night.</p>
