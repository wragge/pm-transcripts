    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Turnbull Government today declared the March 2018 Tathra bushfires (Bega Valley Shire of New South Wales) a disaster for the purposes of establishing Australian disaster relief funds.</p>
<p>Following a request for help to the Prime Minister from Senator Jim Molan and the Mayor of Bega Valley, Kristy McBain, the Government has acted swiftly to allow new funds and qualifying existing funds established for the relief of people affected by the Tathra fires to receive tax deductible donations.</p>
<p>Tathra has suffered devastating property loss and damage. A large clean-up operation will be required to help the residents rebuild their community.</p>
<p>The Turnbull Government is determined to help.</p>
<p>Funds will need to apply for formal endorsement. The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission and the Australian Taxation Office are available to assist funds with this process.</p>
<p>Donations to Australian disaster relief funds established to provide relief in the aftermath of the 2018 Tathra bushfires will be tax deductible for a period of two years from 18 March 2018.</p>
<p>Further information on establishing an Australian disaster relief fund is available at <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au">www.ato.gov.au</a> or by calling 1300 130 248.</p>
