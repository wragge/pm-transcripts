SPEECH B3Y THE PRIME MI1NISTER AT THE OPENING OF THE<br />
ANTARCTIC DIVISION HEADQUARTERS KINGSTON, HOBART<br />
Your Royal Highness, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,<br />
it gives me great pleasure to be in Kingston today to join<br />
in welcoming his Royal Highness to this part of Australia and<br />
to participate in this official opening of the new headquarters<br />
of our major Antarctic Research Agency.<br />
Tasmania is becoming the focal point of Australia's Antarctic<br />
endeavours and an international centre as well. The complex<br />
to be opened today has been built at a cost of $ 8.9 million.<br />
Parliament approved the proposal in October 1977 and it has<br />
beon finished well ahead of schedule by a local Hobart firm,<br />
and has already won a design award for architectural excellence.<br />
All -the functions of Antarctic Division are now located in a<br />
single building and a t tal of 107* staff will use the building<br />
incl. uding expeditioners. And I might say that while it is a<br />
research support centre for the Antarctic expeditions, special<br />
provision has been made for an historical display area to be<br />
open to the public for exhibits associated with Australia's~<br />
Antarctic activities.<br />
There are many advantages to be gained from bringing our<br />
Antarctic and related endeavours -together and especially from<br />
doing so in Tasmania, which is relatively close, and where the<br />
snowfields and wilderness areas provide ideal training grounds<br />
for staff. The Australian Maritime College in Launceston was<br />
opened last year and it is, as is well known, the " practical<br />
seamanship and fisheries training centre". Hundreds of Australian<br />
seafarers will receive both basic and specialised training at<br />
that College. Then there is the new marine science complel:, which<br />
is to be the headquarters of the CSTRO Divisions of Fisheries<br />
and Oceanography.<br />
It reflects the Government's decision to devote substantial<br />
resources -to marine science.<br />
The Marine Centre is exnected to be fully operational within<br />
five years it will have a new multi-purpose oceanographic<br />
vessel and tenders closed for this vessel last month. The<br />
secretariat of the international commission established by the<br />
convention on conservation of Antarct-ic marine living resources<br />
will be located in Hobart. </p>
<p>The concentration of these Antarctic. and marine research<br />
activities in Tasmania will encourage co-operation between the<br />
people involved and contribute more to the effective<br />
functioning of all the agencies. More than this, Tasmania will<br />
increasingly become a world centre in all these fields.<br />
Australia's Antarctic territory is an immense area almost as<br />
large as the Australian continent itself. Australia has a<br />
long arid proud record of concerned stewardship over our<br />
Antarctic territory it is a fragile as well as a hostileenvironmuent.<br />
Both science and bitter experience have helped<br />
human beings to survive in the Antarctic. It is my hope that<br />
it will only be science and not bitter experience that will<br />
help human beings to understand and manage the resources of the<br />
Antarctic. To this end, we have committed ourselves to increasing<br />
and updating the facilities at all Australian Antarctic stations<br />
Casey, Davis and Mawson. The resulting program will be<br />
implemented over a ten year period at a cost of over $ 58 million.<br />
We are pursuing a balanced program of research in Antarctica.<br />
The Antarctic Research Policy Advisory Committee, set up in<br />
1979 comprises top level industrial and academic research<br />
interests, together with relevant departments as observers.<br />
This Cormmittee has completed a report of priorities, and many<br />
of its eighteen recommendations have already been implemented<br />
by the Government. In particular, the Government has accepted<br />
the notion of developing the Antarctic Division as a. centre of<br />
excellence in southern ocean marine biology. In 1980-81<br />
$ 1.2 million was provided for the first stage of this program.<br />
Australia's official involvement in Antarctic goes back to<br />
1899, when a Tasmanian scientist, Louis Bernacchi, was a<br />
member of the first expedition to winter there. And then there<br />
were the great Australasian scientific expeditions led by<br />
Sir Douglas Mawson, in 1911, and again in 1929 to 1931. In<br />
1936, the Australian Antarctic Territory was proclaimed, and<br />
in 1959 the Antarctic Treaty was established, In 1947, the<br />
Government established the Australian National Antarctic Resea:_+ ch<br />
Expeditions ( ANARE) which have been co-ordinated and supported<br />
by the Antarctic Division.<br />
Our commitment has been to scientific research and to exploration.<br />
Research activity has been directed towards a basic understanding<br />
of the Antarctic environment, and the relationslhips betwe. n it<br />
and the global environment. Particular studies 1-ave been made<br />
of phenomena which are peculiar to the area such as changes in<br />
the earth's magnetic field. Research has also been done on the<br />
marine living resources of the southern ocean and the<br />
environmental effects of their possible exploitation. Year<br />
round meteorological observations are part of the informati'on<br />
used in daily weather forecasts for Australia and the Southern<br />
Hemisphere. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
We have sought to gain a better understanding of the Antarctic,<br />
and to play a useful and constructive part in managing that<br />
environment.<br />
Australia's Antarctic Division is now part of the Australian<br />
legend; In 35 years, it has made enormous contribution to man's<br />
knowledge and experience of Antarctica.<br />
Australia is proud of the tradition that has been established,<br />
and that will no doubt be continued in this new headquarters.<br />
