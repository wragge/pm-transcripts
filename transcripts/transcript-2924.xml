ACCOMMODATION FOR SPECIAL MIGRANT CLASSES IN SCHOOLS<br />
The Australian Government will provide funds under<br />
the Child Migrant Education Program to help State and<br />
independent schools provide emergency accommodation where<br />
this is necessary to allow adequate special migrant instruction<br />
to take place. This reverses a decision of the previous Government<br />
to exclude the provision of accommodation from the Commonwealth<br />
program. Cabinet today approved a submission from the Minister<br />
for Education, Mr Beasley, and the Minister for Immigration,<br />
Mr Grassby. These funds will be additional to those already being<br />
provided to pay the salaries of the necessary additional<br />
teachers and to purchase special language teaching equipment<br />
for this program.<br />
A recent survey in schools of high migrant density in<br />
Melbourne revealed serious inadequacies in the conditions under<br />
which some migrant children are receiving special English<br />
instruction and which are precluding a substantial proportion<br />
from receiving any special instruction at: all. Only 20 per cent<br />
of migrant children who needed special language instruction<br />
were getting it. Lack of suitable accommodation was identified<br />
as a major deficiency.<br />
The additional funds for accommodation purposes will be<br />
provided over the two year period 1973/ 74 and 1974/ 75. The<br />
Government will then review the position.<br />
Consultations will be arranged without delay with State<br />
and independent school authorities to define their needs in detail. </p>
