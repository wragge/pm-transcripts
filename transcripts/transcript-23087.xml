    <content><![CDATA[<p>Mr Rudd was Prime Minister of our country, not once, but twice and I salute him on this night of his farewell to the parliament.</p>
<p>Whatever disagreements my colleagues and I have had with Mr Rudd, we will always honour what he achieved on the day of the National Apology.Â  Ancient wrongs were addressed that day.Â  It was a great moment in our countryâs history and it happened because of him.</p>
<p>I am glad that Mr Rudd has said that he intends to continue this commitment to Indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>While Mr Rudd will no longer continue as a parliamentarian, I have every confidence that he will continue to serve our country and the values that he has always believed in.</p>
<p>13 November 2013</p>
