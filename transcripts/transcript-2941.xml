SECOND READING SPEECH BY THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER, THE HONOURABLE E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.<br />
PRIVY COUNCIL APPEALS ABOLITION BILL 1973<br />
PRIVY COUNCIL ( APPEALS FROM THE HIGH COURT) BILL 1973<br />
Mr Speaker, I informed the House on 1 May of my talks<br />
in London, just after Easter, with the British Prime Minister,<br />
Foreign Secretary, Lord Chancellor and Attorney-General regarding<br />
the abolition of appeals from Australia to the Privy Council.<br />
I gave the House the reason for the Government's policy<br />
on this question. The reason is obvious and sound. It is that<br />
the High Court of Australia must become the highest court of the<br />
land in all matters pertaining to Australia and to the legal<br />
rights and obligations, in Australia, of its citizens. That<br />
state of affairs should long since have been attained. The present<br />
position is utterly anomalous.<br />
Recent reports have come to my notice that the States<br />
are proposing to petition the Queen to refer certain seabed<br />
questions to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council under<br />
an Imperial statute of 1833. ThAt such action can be contemplated<br />
serves only to underline what I am saying. It is no longer<br />
appropriate that any possibility should still remain of any<br />
government in Australia taking legal questions to, or of<br />
Australian citizens litigating their differences before, the<br />
courts of another country.<br />
The course embarked upon in 1968 by the Government of that<br />
time, with the support of the Australian Labor Party, when the<br />
Government introduced the legislation contained in the Privy<br />
Council ( Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968 for the </p>
<p>2<br />
purpose of limiting appeals from the High Court to the Privy<br />
Council, should now be brought to its logical conclusion,<br />
a conclusion which we at that time advocated in supporting the<br />
Bill. The introduction of the Bills that the House is now<br />
asked to consider takes the next and final step in that<br />
direction. Mr. Speaker, when I spoke in the House on 1 May<br />
I foreshadowed that the Government would follow the course<br />
of introducing legislation requesting and consenting to the<br />
enactment of British legislation abolishing appeals to the<br />
Privy Council from State Supreme Courts in State matters.<br />
I said that the enactment of such legislation by the<br />
Australian Parliament would provide the opportunity, if so<br />
desired, for a challenge to be made to the validity of the<br />
legislation. If there were to be no challenge within a<br />
reasonable period, or if the validity of the legislation is<br />
upheld under challenge, the Australian Government would<br />
expect that fte British Government would introduce into the<br />
British Parliament the legislation requested and consented<br />
to by the Australian Government and Parliament.<br />
The first of the Bills that I now present and<br />
describe to the House is the Privy Council Appeals Abolition<br />
Bill. The Bill is based both upon the Australian Constitution<br />
and the Statute of Westminster. </p>
<p>3<br />
The Bill has a two-fold operation. First, clauses<br />
4 to 7 are what I may call self-operating provisions. That is<br />
to say, they will operate of their own force by virtue of the<br />
powers vested in the Australian Parliament. Secondly,<br />
clause 8 requests the United Kingdom Parliament to enact<br />
legislation in the terms of the Bill scheduled to the Act.<br />
Both sets of provisions are directed to the same end, namely,<br />
to bar appeals to the Privy Council from Australian courts<br />
other than the High Court and to bar the reference to the<br />
Privy Council of matters not being appeals from courts, that<br />
arise in or in relation to Australia.<br />
The provisions which I have described as self-operating<br />
have been included in the Bill on the basis that the Australian<br />
Parliament, as well as requesting and consenting to the United<br />
Kingdom legislation on this matter, should assert all powers<br />
open to it to achieve the same result.<br />
Clauses 4 and 6( 1) of the Bill are directed to the<br />
abolition of appeals from Australian courts other than the<br />
High Court. Clauses 5 and 6( 2) are directed to ensuring that<br />
Australian matters that are not appeals from courts shall not be<br />
referred to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. These<br />
clauses are intended to exclude resort to the Privy Council in<br />
cases of the kind that the States, according to reports,<br />
presently have under consideration.<br />
The schedule to the Bill contains the terms of<br />
the legislation which we would expect the British Government<br />
to introduce in the British Parliament. Clauses 2, 3 and 4 </p>
<p>4-<br />
are to the same effect as the clauses in our own Bill that I have<br />
just described to the House.<br />
In connection with the petition on seabed matters<br />
which the States are reported to be contemplating, I should<br />
inform the House that I have sent a message to the British Prime<br />
Minister. The substance of that message is that the Australian<br />
Government considers it would not be appropriate for Her<br />
Majesty to refer any such petition to the Judicial Committee.<br />
I made the point to the British Prime Minister that<br />
the provisions of section 4 of the Judicial Committee Act 1833,<br />
under which the States apparently propose to petition Her<br />
Majesty, will be included among the provisions that will be<br />
repealed when the British Parliament enacts its legislation on<br />
the request and consent of this Parliament. I added that this<br />
Parliament already has under consideration the Seas and<br />
Submerged Lands Bill which, when passed, will provide opportunity,<br />
if it is desired, for all relevant seabed questions to be<br />
determined by the High Court. The possibility of there being<br />
two streams of authority must be avoided. The proper forum for<br />
the determination of these important questions of Australian<br />
constitutional law is the High Court of Australia.<br />
Mr Sppaker, the second Bill is the Privy Council<br />
( Appeals from the High Court) Bill. This Bill completes, so<br />
far as the High Court is concerned, what the Privy Council<br />
( Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968 commenced. </p>
<p>5<br />
The Act of 1968 abolished appeals to the Privy Council<br />
from the High Court in all matters except purely State matters and<br />
the so-called inter se questions.<br />
The Constitution itself excludes appeals in respect<br />
of inter se questions excepting upon the grant of a certificate<br />
by the High Court. The High Court has granted only one<br />
certificate and that in 1912. For all practical purposes<br />
there is no appeal to the Privy Council from the High Court<br />
in respect of inter se questions.<br />
As to appeals to the Privy Council from the High<br />
Court in State matters, the Australian Labor Party moved an<br />
amendment to the Bill of 1968 to remove altogether the right<br />
of appeal to the Privy Council from the High Court. The<br />
amendment was not accepted. What I have referred to as the<br />
second Bill completes the process that the Australian Labor<br />
Party would have liked to have seen completed when legislation<br />
was before the Parliament five years ago.<br />
Mr Speaker, I believe that by passing this Bill<br />
the Australian Parliament will demonstrate its view that<br />
the Australian courts can and should exercise the final<br />
judicial authority in this land. We all know that in the<br />
High Court we have a Bench whose learning and authority is<br />
respected wherever English law runs.<br />
I commend the two Bills to the House. </p>
