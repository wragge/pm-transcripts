    <content><![CDATA[<p>HE President Dr Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono telephoned me this afternoon to explain that, because of the recent earthquake in Sumatra, he would now be unable to proceed with his plans to visit Australia on Thursday and Friday this week.  He proposed a short postponement until early next week.</p>
<p>I expressed my sympathy for the plight of the victims of this latest natural disaster.  We readily understood the need for the President to be in Indonesia at this time.</p>
<p>I advised the President that Australia stood ready to assist with practical help.  I offered to make available the Australian medical facilities on HMAS Kanimbla and two C-130 aircraft to provide aero-medical capabilities and other support.  Foreign Minister Alexander Downer has announced AusAID has initially made available $1 million to address the immediate needs of those affected.</p>
<p>We look forward to welcoming the President and his party to Australia next week.</p>
