FOR MEDIA 7 AUGUST 1990<br />
I respect the dignity with which John Cain announced his<br />
decision to resign the Premiership of Victoria.<br />
In that announcement he referred to the fact that some<br />
mistakes had been made in Government. This should not be<br />
allowed to detract from his remarkably positive record of<br />
achievement as Premier for more than eight years.<br />
In that period Victoria led Australia in the creation of<br />
jobs and the reduction of unemployment. John Cain as<br />
Premier also demonstrated a particular concern for the<br />
more disadvantaged members of society.<br />
I wish him well in the future. </p>
