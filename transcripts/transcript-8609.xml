EARLY START TO PORT OF BRISBANE RAIL LINK<br />
Brisbane will become a major sea freight transfer centre serving much of eastern<br />
Australia and the South Pacific within five years, Prime Minister Paul Keating predicted<br />
today. Mr Keating's statement was backed by Federal Land Transport Minister, Bob Brown,<br />
who said tbat a major study had estimated that a standard gauge rail link to the Port of<br />
Brisbane would generate new business employing 3100 people and would inject more<br />
than $ 224 million into the Queensland economy over 10 years.<br />
Mr Keating and Mr Brown were commenting on the Federal Government's decision to<br />
release $ 30 million of One Nation money immediately as a Commonwealth contribution<br />
to the 21 km link from the Port at Fisherman Islands to the existing standard gauge<br />
railway line at Dutton Park.<br />
The new National Rail Corporation will contribute $ 10 million to the project, with the<br />
Queensland Government meeting the remainder of the $ 90 million estimated cost.<br />
Mr Keating and Mr Brown said the Commonwealth contribution was conditional upon<br />
the link meeting stringent environmental standards.<br />
The Commonwealth would also allocate $ 9 million as an initial payment towards the $ 82<br />
million upgrading of the Brisbane-Sydney railway line. The One Nation money will be<br />
used to replace several bridges and place new sleepers along deficient sections of the<br />
standard gauge track in Northern New South Wales. Proposals would be submitted soon<br />
for the remainder of the $ 82 million earmarked for this corridor.<br />
' The aim of this spending is to encourage shipping lines wanting to minimise steaming<br />
times and shorten costly port delays to choose Brisbane as a regular stopover,<br />
particularly if goods can be transferred interstate by a more efficient Australian rail<br />
freight network. / 2<br />

The Port of Brisbane rail link will connect Brisbane directly into a rail grid running to all<br />
mainland state capitals, while improvements on the Brisbane-Sydney line will reduce rail<br />
travelling time to about 16 hours, the same time as road transport takes to make the<br />
journey', Mr Keating and Mr Brown said.<br />
' Ukely national benefits include increased speed and reliability of freight transfer, lower<br />
costs to freight forwarders and consumers and greater competitiveness in Australia's<br />
trade-exposed sectors through the major ports.<br />
' At present, the port is served by a Queensland Rail narrow gauge freight line. Interstate<br />
freight traffic to or from the port. must be trans-shipped to or from the standard gauge<br />
line the Acacia Ridge goods yards using either road or narrow gauge rail.<br />
This is an inefficient method of operation, as interstate freight transported by rail beyond<br />
Brisbane must be double-handled'.<br />
Mr Keating and Mr Brown said the One Nation investment in the Brisbane-Sydney rail<br />
corridor and Port of Brisbane link would increase rail's share of the transportation task<br />
down the New South Wales coast from 35 per cent to 45 per cent.<br />
The Dutton Park-Fisherman Islands standard gauge link is planned to follow an existing<br />
suburban rail corridor through Brisbane's southern suburbs. Construction is expected to<br />
generate employment for about 750 people in 1992-93 and 1993-94. The line is<br />
expected to be completed in 1995.<br />
