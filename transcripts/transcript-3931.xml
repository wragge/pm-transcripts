    <content><![CDATA[<p>THE CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS -Â SUNDAY 19 OCTOBER 1975</p>
<p>The House of Representatives passed the basic Budget BillsÂ ten days ago. This week they came before the Senate. There theÂ Liberal and Country Party Senators combined to carry anÂ amendment that th e Bills should not be debated by the Senate.Â until I had called an election.</p>
<p>You will notice that the Opposition Senators didn't rejectÂ the Budget Bills, this has never happened before in Australia.Â They knew that it would not only be unprincipled and unprecedentedÂ but monstrousÂ to reject the Budget Bills. That's not the functionÂ of the Senate.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, their blackmailing me by sayingÂ Sthat-unless I call an election, then the taxpayers money can'tÂ Â be spent by the Australian Government to pay Public Servants,Â and soldiers, and Medibank, and students, and aged persons homesÂ o all these commitments.</p>
<p>Now I will not yield to this blackmail. This week theÂ House of Representatives again reaffirmed its confidence in myÂ Government.</p>
<p>There are two Houses of the Federal Parliament, the GovernrmentÂ is that Party or Parties with a majority in the House ofÂ Representatives. There can't be a Prime Minister or a TreasurerÂ in the Senate. It is not the Senate's function to decide whoÂ shall be the Government of Australia.</p>
<p>There can't be an election for the House of Representatives Â unless the Government advises the Governor-General to issue theÂ writs. As long as I have a majority in the House of Representatives.Â <br />I will not advise the Governor-General to issue writs for a HouseÂ of Representatives election at the behest of the Senate..</p>
<p>Now this amendment which the Opposition carried in theÂ Senate was done in reprehensible circumstances. This is notÂ the same Senate as was elected in May last year. At that electionÂ the Labor candidates secured more votes than the cand-idates of allÂ other Parties combined. The Labor Party secured 29 Senators, theÂ Liberal and Country Parties secured 29 Senators.. There were twoÂ independents.</p>
<p>Now the Labor Party has only 27 Senators. Two vacanciesÂ occurred in the Labor ranks and two State Governments in breachÂ of a convention which has been followed in every State Parliament,Â by both sides of politics for the last quarter of a century; non-Labor Senators were appointed to take the place of the formerÂ Labor Senators. If Senator Milliner of Queensland, had not diedÂ a few months ago, then this amendment would not have been carried.Â This is a bogus Senate, a tainted Senate. And the amendment wasÂ carried in the cruel, but telling wordsÂ of Senator Steele Hall:Â " Let it be remembered that the Opposition succeeded only becauseÂ a Labor Senator died. They did it over a dead man's corpse."</p>
<p>The principle for which we are ' fighting is this: thatÂ a Government with a majority in the House of RepresentativesÂ is entitled to govern. A Budget can only be initiated or amendedÂ in the House of Representatives; not in the Senate. I am thinkingÂ in this issue, not merely of the fortunes of my own Government,Â which previously~ halfway through its first term~ had to have aÂ premature election; which is now being threatened by the OppositionÂ again halfway through its second term. I am thinking not only ofÂ the fortunes of my own Government, I'm thinking of ParliamentaryÂ democracy in Australia. If I yield on this issue then no futureÂ Australian Governmrent can every be secure in the face of a SenateÂ where it does not have a majority. It could every six months,Â every time the Budget comes up, every time the Autumrn Supply BillsÂ -come UP, be threatened by the Senate where it doesn't have aÂ majority.</p>
<p>Now in previous years the Government has often not hadÂ a majority in the Senate. But never previously, before myÂ Government,Â has the Senate threatened the Government with aÂ majority in the House of Representatives. There is a greatÂ issue at stake in this matter. The Opposition knows that thereÂ are feelings of disquite among its ranks. In the GovernmentÂ we are staunch, we will stand firm by the proper principles ofÂ Parliamentary democracy in Australia.</p>
