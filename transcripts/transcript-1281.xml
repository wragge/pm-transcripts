SETT'ING PZ THM F( W3NATION STONE<br />
OF THE N4ATIONAL LIBRAY CANBERRA 66/ 085<br />
31st March 1366<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister.-Mr. Harold Holt<br />
As you have been told by Mr. Anthony, I shall<br />
shortly have the privilege of introducing to you the best<br />
known man in Australia. I shall be asking him then to<br />
perform a task for which I think he has had more practice<br />
than any other man I could name-in the public life of this,<br />
or any other country; and those two facts alone as I<br />
give them to you indicate the significance of the occasion<br />
for us and of the part of leadership and wise guidance which<br />
Sir Robert has himself played in relation to the building<br />
behind us. 3 e is fortunate, I think he would agree, at least<br />
in this respect, that most people who lay a foundation stone<br />
have to go through a long and rather uncomfortable period<br />
of waiting as the weeds build up around it and the time<br />
marches on before there is much visible sign of achievement<br />
imposed upon the stone which has been laid.<br />
But here we see a building well advanced along the<br />
road to completion and already signifying to us in its lines<br />
the distinction which Mr. Anthony has referred to so<br />
eloquently as he has addressed us in the course of his own<br />
speech. I know that there are many people to whom thanks<br />
and tribute should be paid on an occasion such as this,<br />
and I shall mention them in a minute or so. But, Sir<br />
Robert who has had such a leading part to play in the<br />
development of this beautiful Australian capital which in<br />
every year that passes unfolds itself in greater beauty<br />
and distinction for the observer he would be interested<br />
to know that not only is the N~ ational Library project quite<br />
obviously so well advanced but another great interest of<br />
his was advanced a stagc further this week when I received.<br />
from Sir Daryl Lindsay as Chairman of the Advisory Committee,<br />
the report on the proposed National ZArt Gallery for the<br />
N'ational Capital. Sir Robert had a large part to play in the<br />
decision to establish here a National Art Gallery and to<br />
set up tiic Committee which would do the preliminary thinking<br />
on that matter for us.<br />
vie all know, ladies and gentlemen, that a building<br />
such as we find behind us or you, in front of you does<br />
not just happen and my colleague the Minister for the<br />
Interior has told you something of the planning and toil<br />
which has gone to make it.<br />
lHe has also paid proper tribute to those involved<br />
and I would like to add the thanks of the Government to him<br />
because he has had a very active part to play in the overall<br />
project; and to Mr. overall ( no pun intended-by that<br />
previous reference to Mr. Overall and to all those </p>
<p>associated with them in What clearly will be a notable and<br />
enduring addition in what is already a very handsome Capital<br />
City. The building will allow the library to bring<br />
together for the first time in Australia a collection of<br />
more than a million volumes and its vast collections of maps,<br />
manuscripts, pictures and films, this will make it possible<br />
for these great resources to be put to their best use.<br />
The Government has appreciated the difficulty of providing<br />
a satisfactory service from the past and present widely<br />
separated temporary buildings and it is grateful to the staff<br />
of the National Library for their dedicated services in<br />
these circumstances. I would like to add a word on what the building<br />
means to the Government and to the Nation. It marks the<br />
fulfilment of processes which~ began with the first Australian<br />
Prime Minister in 1901, and which have had the warm support<br />
of successive governments and parliaments since that time.<br />
I mention the Parliament because, of course, the<br />
National Library grew out of the Parliamentary Library, and<br />
until separation of the two libraries was begun in 1961, the<br />
National Library was developed by the presiding officers of<br />
Parliament and the Parliamentary Librarians of the day.<br />
They were advised by successive Library Committees representing<br />
both Houses of the Parliament and all parties in the Parliament.<br />
I recall with pleasure I had the privilege of serving as a<br />
back-bench member of Parliament on the Library Commtittee in<br />
earlier years. Special recognition is due to my Colleague,<br />
Senator the Hon. Sir Alister McMullin, President of the<br />
Senate who presided over the Library Committee from 1956-1961,<br />
this was during a period of great development and has smoothed<br />
the process of separation since.<br />
The growth of the National Library has been further<br />
accelerated since its act of 1960 under the guidance of the<br />
Council of ninu members with the National Librarian as thieir<br />
Executive Officer. The Govrernment is grateful to these men<br />
and women of wide and varied experience from throughout.*<br />
Australia who have given their services freely in the national<br />
interest. Their Chairman, Sir Archie Grenfell Price, well<br />
known to most of you present as a scholar; is recalled by<br />
me as a very valued parliamentary colleague during some of<br />
the years of War.<br />
The National Library Act of 1960 was a recognition<br />
by the Government and Parliament that a strong National Library<br />
was essential to the research and inquiry neoded to support<br />
Australia's unprecedented National growth. It will<br />
supplement what has been done by Government and others for<br />
universities and research workers generally. As Sir Robert<br />
said when introducing it, the Act did not create a new<br />
institution but would define the functions and role of an<br />
institution which would increasingly play a National role<br />
of the greatest importance similar to that of the great<br />
National Libraries in other countries. </p>
<p>4V It is perhaps significant that the countries<br />
which have shown the greatest development in this century<br />
are those with the greatest collections of Library material<br />
for research. United States is, of course, perhaps the<br />
most notable example to which our own National Library<br />
owes a great deal.<br />
What should the Australian people expect of their<br />
National. Library It is the, place whiere they should hope to find<br />
the most detailed information about their own cbuntry and<br />
the most important facts and opinions about-other countries,<br />
and especially about those with which our future is likely<br />
to be closely linked. The National. Library is assembling<br />
the records of the past, as well as those which will<br />
reflcZ, current activities. For we cannot-understand the<br />
present or plan for the future without a knowledge of the<br />
past. This is especially important where Australians in<br />
relation to themselves and in thcir growing association with<br />
other countries whose civilizations are so mucil older than<br />
our own. It is well to remember that these older civilizations<br />
include our Asian neighbours and therefore the Library is<br />
actively collecting material in many A sian languages as well<br />
as in English and European languages.<br />
All this will be of great value to the Parliament,<br />
to the Departments of Government, to the Universities and to<br />
research and enquiry where ever it takes place. Through<br />
teleprinter links and inter-Library loans and new communications<br />
of the future, the resources of the Library will bewaailablo,<br />
as they should be, to Australian people everywhere.<br />
And before I turn to my task of calling on Sir<br />
Robert may I on behalf of the Australian Government and indeed<br />
I believe I can say on behalf of the Australian people, pay<br />
a special tribute of thanks to Mr. Harold White who has given<br />
such distinguished service to the Library through so many<br />
years. He has become if not a Canberra institution<br />
certainly in our eyes a Parliamentary institution in his own<br />
right and I speak in warm terms of the gratitude which we<br />
Members of the Parliament, whether in Government or in<br />
Opposition, or whatever individual status may be, foel for<br />
Mr. Harold White and through him for the very able staff<br />
which assists him so pleasantly and agreeably in the service<br />
of the parliament as well.<br />
Now I have earlier paid some quite inadequate<br />
tributc to the role of leadership and guidancQ exercisud by<br />
Sir Robert M4enzies through his record tcrm of leadership as<br />
the Prime Minister of this country.<br />
It is therefore, I am sure everyone will ngree,<br />
entirely appropriate that the Foundation Stone of this<br />
building should be set by him and that he should be today<br />
looked to as the loading figure in a celebration which will<br />
be long remembercd in Canberra and which will by virtue of tho<br />
distinction of the building which it touches and the purposes<br />
which that building serves, mark as one of the more_ notable<br />
days in tho development of Australia's National capital.<br />
I ask Sir Robert Mvenzies if he will lay the<br />
Foundation Stone of the National Library. </p>
