MENZIES, AT THE OFFICIAL OPENING OF THE NATIONAL<br />
HEART FL7q-DATION CAIPAIGN AT CANBEIRA, ON 28TH<br />
" FRL, 1 ,61<br />
Sir, Your Grace, Your Excellency and gentlemen:<br />
I think I ought to begin by telling you two things that<br />
have entered my mind very powerfully, first, since I read the<br />
literature that was circulated; and second, since I came here<br />
tonight. Here is my friend, Warren McDonald, a great<br />
Australian, presiding over this appeal and saying to you quite<br />
modestly, ? I want œ l millions". What in reality he -ants is<br />
œ 2j millions: And this relresents a complete contradiction pf my<br />
earlier and more respectable life as a Barrister. Because when<br />
we wanted, on behalf of our client, œ 1U, 000., we always asked for<br />
œ 2,000. He is revdrsing the process.<br />
And the other preliminary observation is that when. I<br />
read the book of the words, because having inveigled me into:<br />
doing this task some time ago they then sent me masses of what<br />
I believe is loosely called " literature" ( Laughter) and it had<br />
hearts all over it, I read the rules to be observed to avoid<br />
being a heart subject. I want to begin by confessing to you<br />
that I have violated them all. You are not to be overweight.<br />
( Laughter) Well, now, thank you, thank you so much for not<br />
having laughed louder. ( Laughter) You are not to smoke too<br />
much, whereas every time, and it doesn't happen too frequently,<br />
that I am offered a good cigar, I smoke it, at once. And third,<br />
you are to take regular exorcise. The only exercise that I ever<br />
got cohsists of getting up out of my chair in my office and<br />
going out into ry private secretary's office to kick up a<br />
frightful uproar because something hasn't been done. But in<br />
spite of that I hope to run for a year or two longer. ( Applause)<br />
Oh, I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have let this have even the<br />
merest hint of political significance. I hope to run for<br />
another nine months. ( Laughter)<br />
But my interest in this problem, my particular<br />
interest in what is being done now, arose when some day<br />
somebody brought into me a rather self-effacing, but very famous<br />
man Dr. Paul Dudley White. ( Applause) Having got tired of<br />
curing President Eisenhower he decided to have a look at me.<br />
And he came in to see me. I learned more about the<br />
possibilities of a Heart Foundation from him in one hour than I<br />
think I might have learned by reading blue books and white<br />
papers sounds rFther like Seidlitz powders, doesn't it?<br />
( Laughter) for a long, long time. He introduced me to a new<br />
outlook on this matter. All I want to say to you tonight is<br />
something about my new outlook on this matter, because I<br />
believe I was going to say I hope but I believe that the<br />
Appeal that is being launched tonight will produce a responsive<br />
chord in almuost every human being in this country.<br />
I remember saying to the Doctor, " Well, of course when<br />
I was a boy" which as my opponents would say is an incredibly<br />
long time ago " and somebody was reported to have had a little<br />
heart trouble, that somebody wtas put aside ' ell he's had a<br />
little heart trouble' and he lay low, as yo i might say, and<br />
was treated quietly." It was understood that he must not be<br />
disturbed. Finally he almost frittered away his life because it<br />
was understood that nothing must be done to disturb it. And I<br />
said to him to our most distinguished visitor, " Is that true<br />
any longer?" and he said, with that easy manner that a thin<br />
man adopts when advising a thick one, " No, no, this is all quite<br />
wrong. What happens is that if a nan has a little coronary<br />
trouble good or bad as the case may be he rests until this </p>
<p>particular lesion is corrected. Then if he has been in the<br />
habit of playing golf, he plays golf; if he has been in the<br />
habit of walking, he walks; if he has been in the habit of<br />
stepping in smartly to the division lists with the bells ringing,<br />
he steps in smartly ( Laughter) and registers his vote. He is not<br />
to be encouraged to gallop upstairs. dut subject to that let him<br />
live a normal life and "' here is no reason why he shouldn4t live<br />
for 25 years". Now thatt I thought, was a most illuminating<br />
observation by Dr. Paul 4hiue.<br />
Then when I was approached first about this matter and,<br />
as I have been unkindly reminded, made a speech about it, about<br />
two years ago was it? Anyhow my office produced it the other<br />
day. At the time I thought it was terrible; and reading back on<br />
it I thought " Jolly good, jolly good". Then it was, I think,<br />
that I began to understand a few things, a few things that I hope<br />
everybody in Australia will understand.<br />
We have been accustomed to talking about, and indeed<br />
doing something about certain major diseases. For example, what<br />
we in this country have done about tuberculosis in th3 last<br />
years is, I believe, almost fabulous. We have been as people<br />
devoting as we think, a good deal of money, but as the great and<br />
devoted experts in this field know, an immense amount of genius<br />
and spirit and enthusiasm and skill to getting rid of certain<br />
great complaints. Yet perhaps until this Foundation was mooted<br />
we had never realised that although all of us some day will die,<br />
because our heart ceases to beat, the fact is that more than half<br />
of the deaths in Australia still occur from some disease of the<br />
heart. And of those I'm no expert but of those I should<br />
imagine quite a perceptible percentage are deaths ol people who<br />
need not die, who need not become invalids, who need not be<br />
treated as something odd, to be carefully respected on the<br />
sidelines. If only we could discover the causes of heart trouble,<br />
the proper treatment of heart trouble, the right way in which to<br />
make people who have some heart trouble understand that they are<br />
not out, but that they are still, under proper conditions, in the<br />
full stream of life.<br />
This, I think, is a tremendous adventure in medical<br />
science. And like all other groat advanturos in scientific work<br />
it is not just to be loft to Governments because Government<br />
departments there are many famous heads of Department here<br />
tonight can do a great deal. But when you attack an enormous<br />
problem of this kind, then, as the people expect to have the<br />
benefit, so the people must rally around and say " Lie are going to<br />
have a hand in achieving this thing."<br />
This is what I call, Sir, the " new wisdom". In my days<br />
as a boy I so well remember as I have reminded you, " Poor old<br />
chap", they used to say " hels had a heart attack, and therefore<br />
he's out". And now the whole concentration of the greatest<br />
cardiac experts in the world is not on smoothing the passing of<br />
the man who has had a heart attack, but in bringing him back<br />
into the full stream of life and to his full usefulness as a<br />
citizen. This is really, when you think about it, one of the<br />
greatest efforts at human reconstruction that has occurred in our<br />
time. That is one of the reasons why I am here.<br />
Now, Sir, like nest of you I have my own feelings of<br />
respect and of affection for medical men. I know it pleases the<br />
doctors to make disagreeable remarks about the lawvyers nothing<br />
to the disagreeable remarks that the lawyers have made about the<br />
doctors under suitable circuimstances. But when we got right<br />
down home it's true, isn't it, that we all have a remarkable<br />
feeling of confidence and trust in the medical man who looks<br />
after us, who advises us, who treats us. This is a marvellous<br />
and noble profession. </p>
<p>0 3.<br />
But it isn't all a matter of looking at today's doctor<br />
and saying, " Well, of course, he owes his skill to his own<br />
genius". He may have no more genius than his father who was a<br />
doctor before him. But if he knows more, if he has greater<br />
skill, it is because things have been happening outside the<br />
immediate practice of medicine that have enriched his<br />
experience, enriched his knowledge, enriched his own technique.<br />
Therefore, Sir, the truth is, in each generation,<br />
that medical men, and we may all be thankful for it, are better<br />
equipped than their fathers. And if they aro better equipped<br />
it isn't because they are necessarily more able than their<br />
fathers I've never laboured under that error it's because<br />
research, investigation, experiment have increased knowledge and<br />
skill in the new generation. Never let us forget that. Seventy<br />
per cent of what did you say? œ 1 millions, œ 2 millions,<br />
œ 2 millions, œ 3 millions that may be raised by this appeal<br />
of it is to go to research. Now research is not a matter of<br />
some man sitting down and having a brilliant inspiration and<br />
writing it down on a piece of paper. Research, properly<br />
considered in this world, is a matter of infinite pains, of<br />
patient seeking, of patient recording of knowledge; it is<br />
something that I am afraid most of us have never understood. We<br />
think that research means suddenly having a bright idea. It<br />
doesn't mean that, except in one case out of a hundred thousand.<br />
If we are to have research into these matters, if we are to<br />
discover the impact of certain physical conditions on the heart,<br />
then clearly this will take years of work maybe months of work<br />
in some aspects, years of work in others. It will require the<br />
concentrated and organised labour of devoted and skilful people.<br />
And so be it that the research be great, and the results be<br />
great, shall we, or other people, in a few years' time meet<br />
together and say: " This development of research into the<br />
conditions of the heart was one of the greatest things to<br />
happen in Australia". Now, Sir, that provokes me to say just one other thing.<br />
We live, as I am constantly reminded, in a new world. And I am<br />
constantly reminded, and no doubt, quite justly, that I am an<br />
old-fashioned person. This is the " space age" and we are<br />
invited to tremble, or applaud, as the case may be, at the<br />
researches into space by clover modern men who know all about<br />
propellants, who know all about putting rockets into orbit, and<br />
monkeys into orbit, and men into orbit. This is no doubt<br />
spectacular and magnificent. But I will still say this to you,<br />
that from the point of view of the welfare of human beings, men<br />
and women and children, the greatest researches and the greatest<br />
discoveries in this century have not been in space, but on this<br />
earth. ( Applause) When I an invited to quake because somebody has<br />
launched a sputnik or a man or something my mind runs back to the<br />
undoubted fact that in this century, so otheruise mangled by the<br />
villainy of people, the greatest things that have helped mankind,<br />
that have prolonged life, that have aided human happiness, have<br />
been made by those people who have worked on the probleos of<br />
health. My mind runs to the surgeons, the great developments<br />
in surgery, the narvellous developnents among physicians, the<br />
rarvellous, the miraculous work of the bio-chenists, the work of<br />
the physiologists. Add then all up and you will find as I an<br />
prepared to assert, that the simple truth is that of all the<br />
people who gaze up occasionally and look at a sputnik in the<br />
sky, quite a considerable number wouldn't be there to see it,<br />
if it were not for the nagnificent work of medical research in<br />
this century. ( Applause) </p>
<p>Those, Sir, I believe, have been the greatest benefits<br />
to mankind in our time. s I am not disposed to believe that all<br />
work is done and we must now turn to another, I believe that the<br />
Heart Foundation in this country enriched by the experience o<br />
our colleagues in the United States of America, will probably<br />
produce in 0the next generation a ri~ volution in this fiel~ d,<br />
compared to which the launching of rockets the putting up of<br />
things that go into orbit, will in the ultimate judgment of a<br />
just and wise mankind, be as nothing.<br />
The last thing that I want to say to you is this:<br />
This is our problem. I read the material that was sent to me<br />
and I was delighted to find a passage from old John Donne I<br />
wonder how many people can write English today as he wrote it<br />
and I remind you of it:<br />
" Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in<br />
Mankind; And therefore never send to know for whom<br />
the bell tolls; It tolls for thee".<br />
Now this I think is the key note of this matter ' never send<br />
to know lor whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee'. This is<br />
our human problem. If, as a result of this appeal, to which I<br />
hope every man woman and child in Australia will respond, if,<br />
as a result of this appeal great things are done in this vast<br />
field of medical know'ledge and the prolongation of human life<br />
and of human health, then$ Sir 7 I would say that tonight we have<br />
begun a great and humane exercise, not for one, but for all<br />
the most remarkable essay in brothurhood that we have known in<br />
our time. ( Applause) </p>
