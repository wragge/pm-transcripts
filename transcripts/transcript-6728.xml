E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF iNTERVIEW WITH MIKE WILLESEE 19 SEPTEMBER 1985<br />
WILLESEE: It's been a long time coming, but the Federal<br />
Government's promised reforms of our tax system are finally<br />
on the table Prime Minister, thank you for coming.<br />
PM: My pleasure, M1ike.<br />
WILLESEE: Today was the long awaited tax reform statement,<br />
but there was a tension of a kind if I can divert for a moment<br />
given to you defending yourself on the half million dollar<br />
payout for Mr Armstrong, the former head of the Dr Armstrong,<br />
the former head of the Bicentennial Authority. You appeared<br />
to be in your defence in parliament today, angry and upset.<br />
Why?<br />
PM: Well I was angry, Mvike. I don't know about upset. Angry<br />
because from the beginning of this Government we took the view<br />
that we had inherited a Bicentennial Authority legislative structure<br />
and personnel which was entirely the creation of our opponents.<br />
We don't think that that structure is the ideal one, but we<br />
made a deliberate decision, Mike, that because of the importance<br />
of the planning for, and the ultimate celebrations of our Bicentenary<br />
in 1988 it was not appropriate to make any attack upon this,<br />
but to try and make it work. Now, they deliberately created<br />
a situation in which the government and the parliament has no<br />
control over the operation of the Authority. The responsibility<br />
for decisions within the Bicentennial Authority are with the<br />
Authority itself. And in the situation where the government<br />
and parliament has been denied authority over the way hundreds<br />
of millions of dollars are expended, it struck us as being entirely<br />
hypocritical that a great issue was being made of an amount<br />
of money which was, in comparison to the hundreds of millions<br />
of dollars, small. Now, in my handling of this, therefore,<br />
after my discussions with Mr Reid, I had deliberatly handled<br />
it in a way which was going to create the least amount of disputation<br />
trying to create public fracas that could divert the attention,<br />
the involvement of the whole political community and the community<br />
as a whole, in this issue. We have nothing to hide, and indeed<br />
I said to the Leader of the Opposition, not only here will I<br />
talk to you, but I specifically arranged for the Leader of the<br />
Opposition to see Mr Reid so that he could be fully informed<br />
of everything that had happened. Now, against the concentrated<br />
attempts that we have made since we have been in office, to<br />
work within the parameters of lack of control and involvement<br />
of the government, created] by our predecessors, within those<br />
p~ r4mi created by our opponents, we have tried to do the<br />
right thing. Anid now, you are, having this politicisation of<br />
this issue. Now, that is wily was disappointed and angry. </p>
<p>WILLESEE: Prime Minister, I want-, to ( jtonto tax now, so I<br />
will try and deal with this quickly.<br />
PM: Did you mislead Parliament at any time over this matter?<br />
PM: I have never misled the Parliament or the people on this<br />
issue. The statement of 11 September is a totally accurate<br />
statement. WILLESEE: ( inaudible) err on the side of generosity in<br />
getting rid of Dr Armstrong.<br />
PM: What I said was this. I said that I believed, on the all<br />
evidence available to me, that a change in the chief executive<br />
position was appropriate. Now I said in those circumstances,<br />
Michael, quite straight-forwardly, that here was a position<br />
where he had to go, in our judgement. We couldn't have thbcapacity<br />
to do it. And to meet that situation, I said, all<br />
his entitlements should be, we believe, met. And in creating<br />
a situation where a man who expected to be there for another<br />
six years was going, that he should err on the side of generosity,<br />
in those circumstances. Now, what I was told, Mike, was that<br />
to buy out a contract that was six years to run, at a fairly<br />
high salary, that would mean a settlement of 400,000 plus.<br />
Now in fact, my concern that developed was in regard to that<br />
amounti'Nal emerged. * t was not specified in terms of six times<br />
that annual salary, but came to be expressed in a different<br />
way. And so I have raised the question with the Chairman of<br />
the Authority as to whether there is any inappropriateness in<br />
the way that has been done, whether there is any suggestion<br />
of tax minimisation or avoidance. Now, I am awaiting a reply<br />
from the Chairman on that issue. And once we have received<br />
that reply we will deal with it., as is appropriate in those<br />
circumstances. WILLESEE: tax payers, it must be very hard for a normal<br />
taxpayer to understand somebody who is perceived to be not the<br />
right man for the job, getting half a million dollars, I suppose,<br />
to go.<br />
PM: I'm sorry, I don't follow your question. What are you<br />
saying?<br />
WLJLLE7S=: It'S going to be very hard for the average taxpayer to<br />
understand how a man who is perceived to be not good enough<br />
for the job to be given half a million dollars to go.<br />
PM: What I'm saying, Mike. It was in a sitruation where, under<br />
the legislation created by our predecessors it was not a question<br />
of the government saying, you go. The Authority under the Act,<br />
and under the articles of association of that company established<br />
by our predecessors, the decision and the responsibility for<br />
removing an employee anid the conditions of that removal, are<br />
with the Chairman and the B~ oard. Now, what f'm saying is that,<br />
in those circumstances, the Chairman put to me that that would<br />
involve a buying out of* the contra-: ct. arid that represented something<br />
like six times the annual salary, t-. o buy it out. And with the<br />
associated long service leave and aninua. I leave provisions. </p>
<p>3.<br />
WILLESEE: ( inaudible).<br />
PM: Yes he has my support. I have asked, Mike, for a response<br />
from him as to whether the deal, which was in fact negotiated,<br />
in terms that were different from what he initially suggested<br />
to me, whether there has been any inappropriateness in the way<br />
that has now been done in regard to tax. Now, I have got to<br />
wait until I get that reply. If the reply is satisfactory,<br />
then of course there is no problem in that respect. If it is<br />
not satisfactory, we will have to deal with it at that point,<br />
but it is totally unfair to Mr Reid, or to anyone else to make<br />
pre-judgements at this stage until I get his reply.<br />
WILLESEE: Prime Minister, on the tax reform. </p>
<p>WILLESEE: Prime Minister today we have your tax reform package.<br />
Is this the reform you wanted?<br />
PM: Clearly, Michael, the Government's preferred position was<br />
option C, the more preferred one. But let me say this. You will<br />
recall that I said from the beginning, which goes back to the<br />
last election campaign. The reform package we ultimately wanted<br />
was one which satisfied all the principles which included a broad<br />
community support for the package. And quite clearly the option C eleme~ nt<br />
of the package that we put to the people didn't get that required<br />
support. Now we therefore attempted to bring in a comprehensive<br />
reform package which meets the broad principles that we set.<br />
We believe that we have done that.<br />
WILLESEE: inaudible<br />
PM: Well, I have already answered that question. I said at the end<br />
of last year there were nine principles. The ninth principle was<br />
that the package proposed had to have broad community support. The<br />
option C preferred package clearly did not have that. That is not<br />
being forced into a compromise. It was reacting to our own stated<br />
principle. WILLESEE: PM: No. On the contrarythere was no other way I would think<br />
in which you have got such an express and clear, unequivocal<br />
expression of the broad community position. We have got that<br />
and we have responded to it.<br />
WILLESEE: You have already had a mandate to govern?<br />
PM: Well that is true. And the mandate to govern that we asked<br />
the people for on tax was according to nine principles. We<br />
operated precisely according to that mandate.<br />
WILLES EE: inaudible<br />
In the future no Australian will have to pay more than half his<br />
or her income in taxation. That is still a lot isn't it.<br />
PM: Well, let me say this. It is also a lot that is demanded of<br />
government in respect of government expenditures. They demand<br />
properly, high and increasing levels of aefence expenditure.<br />
They demand and in appropriate terms increasing levels of<br />
expenditure on education. A whole range of goods and services<br />
that can only be provided by government. What we have done is<br />
to impose upon ourselves a constriction, a restraint that has<br />
never been imposed before. In other words, bringing down taxes<br />
in this historic way. WE have said to the people now we are<br />
not going to allow the deficit to blow out by now undertaking<br />
expenditures of government in a wild and extravagent way. The<br />
important point is that all the tax revenue that we are getting<br />
from these measures is going not to the government but going back<br />
to the taxpayers. Let me just add. We could get taxes down<br />
further if we cut out, I mean if I decided that it was silly<br />
to have the level of defence expenditure that we have now,<br />
we could reduce taxes, have less defence. We could have less<br />
roads. We could have less education. We could have all those<br />
things. What we have done more that,-any other government is to<br />
cut out unnecessary government expenditures. We have got the </p>
<p>PM cont: lowest level of growth now for six years. We are cutting<br />
back the deficit by more than half of what we inherited.<br />
WILLESEE: I understand why you have instituted a capital gains<br />
tax. But how do you reconcile that politically with your election<br />
promise when you first sought the Prime Ministership?<br />
PM: That was in 1983 and in that first government it was not<br />
done. We totally adhered to that promise. We went to the people<br />
at the next election at the end of 1984 saying that we would look<br />
at the whole tax system comprehensively. There was no attempt to<br />
say to the people of Australia in that last election that in looking<br />
at the whole tax system we wouldn't be looking at the possibility<br />
of capital gains. After all there has been an election since<br />
March of 1983.<br />
WILLESEE: I appreciate that<br />
I would like to recall a clip from your policy<br />
PM: Well you can if you want to take up time that way, but it<br />
is a waste of time because that was in 1983 in regard to the life<br />
of that next parliament. That promise was totally kept. At the<br />
next election I put it on the table that capital gains tax would<br />
be on the table in the total tax review. So you show it if you<br />
wish, but it is irrelevant.<br />
WILLESSE: PM: Sure. let me make it beyond even all their powers of<br />
misrepresentation and distortion there will be no<br />
new capital gains tax."<br />
WILLESEE: Prime Minister, why I wanted to show stated<br />
was so emphatic, you were happy about it.<br />
PM: I was absolutely emphatic about it. It was the appropriate<br />
statement to be made in the 1983 election. There had been so much<br />
misrepresentation by our opponents about this issue. And to have<br />
a certainty in the minds of the Australian people about the things<br />
that we were going to do in our first government to turn this<br />
economy around to rescue it from the worst recession in 50 years.<br />
That certainty had to be introduced. We governed completely<br />
according to that mandate and turned this economy around completely.<br />
We have moved it from the worst recession in 50 years to the best<br />
growing economy in the western world. Then I went to the people,<br />
having done that, at the end of 1984, and I said now I am coming to<br />
you again. We have done so many things, what we have got to tackle<br />
now is tax reform. And I said to the people, and they gave me<br />
another mandate, I said in tackling tax reform we will be looking<br />
at the whole range of issues including capital gains tax. Now they<br />
knew that and I got the mandate on that basis.<br />
WILLESEE: in 1983 when you said that so emphatically, you were<br />
talking about three years of government?<br />
PM: I was talking about that term of government. In fact, I went<br />
to the people in 1984. Now, Michael let's not muck around about<br />
this. Are you saying that because I said that in 1983 and then<br />
I went to the people again in the next election talking about my </p>
<p>PM cant: next term of government and said unequivocally that all the<br />
tax issues, including capital gains tax, will be on the table. That<br />
going to the people then for that new mandate I am now bound by<br />
something I said before. Are you saying that?<br />
WILLESEE: I am asking you how you changed your mind from such<br />
an emphatic statement<br />
PM: I will say it for~ fourth time Michael. We seem always to<br />
get into this problem with you. I will say it for the fourth<br />
time. I went to the people again in 184 after having discharged<br />
my mandate brilliantly successfully in terms of turning the<br />
economy around with my Government, I said now we have done those<br />
things, we have done all those things. We have made a number<br />
of decisions. Now I am coming to you and saying I want another<br />
mandate. And in that mandate I want a mandate to look at the<br />
totality of tax reform. Now I have told you that four times.<br />
I will say it a fifth time if you like.<br />
WILLESEE: inaudible<br />
PM: Good.<br />
WILLESEE: no longer such things as a tax free lunch. What<br />
about parliamentarians allowances?<br />
PM: Parliamentarians will be subject to the same rules as the<br />
private sector.<br />
WILLESEE: inaudible.<br />
PM: What we mean is that in regard to their cash allowances they<br />
will be taxed in the hands of the recipients, of the members of<br />
Parliament.<br />
WILLESEE: inaudible<br />
PM: Well it means very substantially that the very high levels<br />
of allowances that have been paid and not been subject to tax<br />
will now be subject to tax. At the same time, the same rate and<br />
the same conditions as everyone else. And it is appropriate that<br />
that should happen. And you would have followed the press, you have<br />
seen that there has been some concern about it to the credit of<br />
the members of Parliament. And let me say I don't say it as<br />
Government members, I would believe that Opposition members would<br />
take the same view. If you are going to have tax reform it is<br />
appropriate that it apply across the board. And I think all<br />
members of Parliament, to their credit, will take that view.<br />
WILLESEE: Members of Parliament of course get tens of thousands<br />
of dollars a year in what has been tax-free allowances, do they<br />
now have to justify that?<br />
PM: Yes, they will require substantiation. There will no longer<br />
be a situation, Michael, where it is just there and it is not taxed.<br />
To the extent that they have expenses associated with the discharge<br />
of their duties and they wish to claim on those then they will, as<br />
in the private sector have to substantiate. The same rule for them<br />
as for the private sector. </p>
<p>WILLESEE: inaudible<br />
PM: Well, if you come up here and ou want to take out an MP<br />
and you from your meagre resources want to pay for the lunch,<br />
then they will be able to have it with you. If they want to<br />
reciprocate for reasons which they regard as appropriate,<br />
entertainment allowances will not be claimable, but if there<br />
are other expenses of office which they believe are attributable<br />
to the discharge of their office other than entertainment.<br />
Entertainment will not be claimable by anyone. Then they will<br />
have to do that the same as anyone else.<br />
WILLESEE: inaudible<br />
PM: Well, if equity applies, Mike Willesee should because he is<br />
infinitely richer than the Prime Minister.<br />
WILLESEE: inaudible<br />
PM: Would you like a bet?<br />
WILLESEE: Thank you for your time.<br />
PM: Thank you very much Michael.<br />
