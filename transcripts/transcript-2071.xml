FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 51/ 1969<br />
FLOREY MEMORIAL FUND<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Commonwealth Government is to make a<br />
contribution of $ 10, 000 to the fund which is being established<br />
to perpetuate the memory of Lord Florey.<br />
The Florey Memorial Fund is being sponsored<br />
jointly by the Councils of the Royal Society and the Australian<br />
National University, with appeals in Australia and Britain.<br />
It is proposed that the memorial should take<br />
the form of post-doctoral visiting fellowships between Australia<br />
and the United Kingdom, to be known as Florey Fellowships.<br />
The awards will be made for investigation in the biomedical<br />
sciences in fields related to Florey's own work.<br />
Lord Florey, who was born in Adelaide in 1898,<br />
will be best remembered for his pioneering research in the<br />
production and use of Penicillin, for which he shared the Nobel<br />
Prize for Physiology and Medicine in 1945. Lord Florey was<br />
President of the Royal Society from 1960-65 and Chancellor of<br />
the Australian National University from 1965 until his death in<br />
1968. Although Lord Florey spent most of his working life in<br />
England he took a great interest In science in Australia, in<br />
particular in the establishment of the Australian National<br />
University. It is fitting, therefore, that the memorial to Lord<br />
Florey should be in the form of scholarships to enable an<br />
interchange of young scholars between Australia and the United<br />
Kingdom. CANBERRA 17 June 1969 </p>
