PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL 12. O1AM 1 OCTOBER 1994<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
RECOGNITION OF PALAUIAN INDEPENDENCE<br />
I am pleased to announce that the Australian Government has extended<br />
formal recognition to the Republic of Pa -lau following implementation of its<br />
Compact of Free Associati-on with the United States.<br />
Palau becomes the latest independent state in the Pacific and I look forward<br />
to the development of close links between our two countries.<br />
I also welcome Palau's intention to join the South Pacific Forum and I hope<br />
we can co-operate closely in the Forum and-in other regional organisations.<br />
Australia will be represented at the Palau independence celebrations on 1<br />
October by the Honourable Ben Humphreys MP. We will be establishing<br />
formal diplomatic relations with Palau as soon as possible.<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government and people I offer my warm<br />
congratulations to President Kuniwo Nakamura and all Palauans at this<br />
historic moment.---<br />
CANBERRA 1 OCTOBER 1994 </p>
