TRANSCRIPT OF 7.30 REPORT INTERVIEW WITH THE PRIME<br />
MINISTER, THE HON. P J KEATING, M. P.<br />
ABC TELEVISION'S 7.30 REPORT<br />
FRIDAY 25 FEBRUARY, 1994<br />
PL: Prime Minister, welcome to the program.<br />
PM: Thank you, Paul.<br />
PL: Now, this buzzword here in Hobart today, competition<br />
policy, exactly what does that mean?<br />
PH: Well, it's trying to expose to all competitive<br />
forces and the Trade Practices Act those parts which<br />
have formerly been protected, such as state<br />
electricity authorities, water authorities, rail and<br />
unincorporated business enterprises.<br />
PL: So, we're really talking about a big change in the<br />
way our economy works, are we?<br />
PM: It's a very large policy matter and the adoption<br />
today of the principles of these competitive changes<br />
is a very large, economy-wide change.<br />
PL: Are we talking about the professions as well,<br />
medicine, law, that sort of thing?<br />
PM: We're talking about the legal profession, we're<br />
talking about some professions, not necessarily all,<br />
but, now, the Trade Practices Act already applies to<br />
many. But, because the Commonwealth can only<br />
legislate in respect of corporations we need state<br />
legislation for unincorporated people. And, then,<br />
of course, the other area in which the Commonwealth<br />
needs the support of the states is in the state<br />
government business enterprises such as electricity,<br />
water, rail etcetera.<br />
PL: Now, what are the gains in here for the community?<br />
If we really get a lot more competitive and get rid<br />
of a lot of these monopolies and really open the<br />
thing up, how do we benefit and by how much? </p>
<p>PK: Well, at the moment a lot of the electricity<br />
tariffs, for instance, accrue to the electricity<br />
commissions, electricity authorities or they go in<br />
state budgets so they don't accrue. You have reforms<br />
but the benefits never go back to the consumer or<br />
rarely go fully back to the consumer.<br />
PL: And if I'm running a factory I'm, in effect, paying<br />
a sort of hidden tax in higher energy charges?<br />
PM: Exactly, so what we're saying is if we really want<br />
to kick along in the nineties, if we've done all the<br />
things in the eighties, in the labour market, in the<br />
general product markets of this country... we've<br />
now got a huge boost to exports but we'll run up<br />
against competitive problems by not getting these<br />
barriers down. Now, there's only one way to get<br />
them down and that's cooperatively. And that's<br />
basically what has happened here today. It's a very<br />
big outcome with the Commonwealth and the states all<br />
agreeing that we should be accepting these<br />
principles and working on joint legislation up to<br />
the next August meeting of the Council of Australian<br />
Governments.<br />
PL: Of course, many state governments are rather hooked<br />
on the revenue stream they get from these nice cosy<br />
little state monopolies, aren't they?<br />
PM: They are, but just as we, the Commonwealth, have<br />
lost the better part of $ 600-$ 700 million a year now<br />
by reduced customs duty because we've long ago now<br />
brought the tariff wall down. Just as we've paid<br />
money for structural adjustment by buying out<br />
employment on the waterfront and other things<br />
there's probably well over a billion dollars every<br />
year now that we spend on structural adjustment<br />
we've lost the revenue, so the states will have to<br />
lose the revenue too.<br />
PL: Yes, but they don't like that idea, do they?<br />
PM: No, they don't. They want part of the<br />
discussion today was them saying, look, we'll reform<br />
in a sense, if you pay for it. And we were saying,<br />
well, hang on, hang on, hang on, there's going to be<br />
a great benefit for you, in your state, by more<br />
employment, more activity in reforming. But, if<br />
there's a peculiar transfer to the Commonwealth in<br />
some of these things we'll consider some<br />
reimbursement. So, we're saying, " Look, we can't<br />
buy the reform for you, you're going to have to do<br />
some of this yourselves. But, when you do it you'll<br />
find just as we did, in telecommunications,<br />
we've done the reform and what's happened? Phone<br />
charges have gone down and services have come up.<br />
The same will happen to you, you'll end up in a<br />
better state, dare I say it, in a happier state." </p>
<p>PL: So, in future this freeing up, this competitive<br />
regime, will mean if I want to start producing gas<br />
and pumping it into a national grid, I'll have<br />
access to these monopolies will I, to electricity?<br />
PM: Yes. For a start you'll have access, you'll have<br />
fair, competitive rules and there won't be the<br />
capacity to draw down what's called, in the jargon,<br />
monopoly rents. In other words the monopolists<br />
won't be able to charge what they like and then give<br />
it to a state government budget or keep it in their<br />
reserves. With competition, prices will fall and<br />
the public will end up with cheaper electricity,<br />
business will end up with cheaper electricity,<br />
cheaper water and, generally, cheaper inputs. And,<br />
our economy can't really maintain the<br />
competitiveness with Asia unless we have the whole<br />
all of the sectors of Australia. Not just<br />
the corporate sector or the Commonwealth, but all of<br />
the sectors dropping these barriers to competition.<br />
PL: And, some of the premiers have suggested that if<br />
you're fair dinkum about real competition you've got<br />
to have another look at industrial relations?<br />
PM: Well, what I have said during the day is this<br />
product market reform will always precede labour<br />
market reform. If you look at the motor car<br />
industry, if we hadn't lowered tariffs on motor cars<br />
you wouldn't have seen the productivity changes at<br />
Ford or General Motors or Mitsubishi or Toyota.<br />
Because they faced lower tariffs and a more<br />
competitive environment they just had to change.<br />
So, the employees and the unions changed with them<br />
but if there is no pressure to change the labour<br />
market reform is just theoretical.<br />
PL: Yes, but if you have closed shops for example, that<br />
doesn't sound too competitive. I don't think<br />
they're talking about screwing wages down but we<br />
have got a bit of a cosy situation still, haven't<br />
we, with unions in the workplace?<br />
PM: Well, they dropped this item on the agenda today.<br />
They didn't want to press ahead with it. I'm<br />
talking about the conservative premiers, they didn't<br />
want to press ahead with it. I think the main thing<br />
is, I said this week that Australia has to have a<br />
cooperative relationship between the Commonwealth<br />
and-thfe states. Through cooperation much can be<br />
done, already a lot has been done. Now, I think<br />
it's fair to say there wouldn't be too many federal<br />
systems where you could sit down as today say in<br />
Canada or in Germany or in the United States and<br />
get the heads of governments to agree to open their<br />
government business enterprises that is, </p>
<p>expose them to competitive forces as in the rest of<br />
the economy.<br />
PL: Especially not over a three hour lunch.<br />
PM: So, this is an effective device, COAG, but, of<br />
course, what underpins it is, essentially,<br />
cooperation.<br />
PL: On another matter, Prime Minister, Mrs Kelly. How<br />
much more damage can the government sustain on this?<br />
PM: Well, again, it just highlights the point doesn't<br />
it? I mean, here's the government looking at trying<br />
to open up sectors of the economy which have been<br />
closed for all of this century to competitive forces<br />
and what are the opposition doing, chasing around<br />
$ 11,000s from being paid to pipe bands in band<br />
halls...<br />
PL: But, that's what's in the headlines, that's what's<br />
hurting the government.<br />
PM: Yes, but it demonstrates, I think, the difference<br />
between the government which is going all the time<br />
for the main, big policy changes and an opposition<br />
which has got no policy, basically trying to track<br />
down a minister not because of any fraud or any<br />
corruption, because they admit that because they<br />
just don't like the way she administers it.<br />
PL: Well, some would say at two to one on Labor<br />
marginals they had a right to not like the way she<br />
administered it.<br />
PM: Well, most Labor marginals are always in deprived<br />
areas. So, netball courts and basketball courts to<br />
the small organisations of amateur sports clubs... I<br />
mean, after all, this is small money being paid to<br />
amateur sports clubs. Its almost the...<br />
PL: It's two to one, shouldn't she have just fudged it a<br />
bit more than that?<br />
PM: It borders on the essence of civic virtue.<br />
PL: But this borders on the essence of using taxpayers<br />
money to try and win an election.<br />
PM: And here's John Hewson at the Cairns University<br />
saying, I Will1,-wi-thout the Vice Chancellors giving<br />
him any support, without the higher education<br />
authorities giving him any support, saying, oh yes,<br />
I'll give you $ 30 million for a new campus ~ because<br />
it might help us win the seat. It's aliright for<br />
John Hewson to promise $ 30 million. And when asked<br />
by a journalist, Dr Hewson how did you evaluate this<br />
million? Like, was there a whiteboard? He </p>
<p>said, on his fingers, three times ten,<br />
contemptuously. Now, in other words, there's a rule<br />
for John Hewson but the same rule doesn't apply to<br />
Mrs Kelly.<br />
PL: Well, how long are you prepared to hang tough for<br />
Ros Kelly?<br />
PM: Well, there's a House of Representatives report<br />
following the Auditor-General's examinatiif-b-f this<br />
program and that House of Representatives committee<br />
will report next week. And I'll see what that<br />
report says. We have a committee to look at these<br />
things, it has and I'll be taking...<br />
PL: And you'll weigh that report on its merits?<br />
PM: I'll look at the report, absolutely. I have to,<br />
don't I and of course I will.<br />
PL: Yes, but Mrs Kelly's a colleague, a longstanding<br />
friend and you've got the government's face at<br />
stake, haven't you?<br />
PM: But, remember this, I have never minded the notion<br />
that ministers lose their place in the government<br />
because there's been impropriety or there's been<br />
some fraud or something of that matter. There is<br />
nothing of that kind, here. What there is, is<br />
constant attacks by an opposition without any<br />
policies over what they think are allocations which<br />
run against them.<br />
PL: But you will have a look at this report next week<br />
and you will weigh it up on its merits?<br />
PM: I said in Parliament yesterday that this report is<br />
to be presented, it's a House of Representatives<br />
report on which the Government has a majority so, of<br />
course, I'll be looking at the report to see what<br />
they say.<br />
PL: Thanks for your time.<br />
PM: Thankyou.<br />
Ends. </p>
