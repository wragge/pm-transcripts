FOR MEDIA 19 February 1988<br />
I have agreed to convene a meeting shortly of<br />
representatives of the Business Council of Australia, the<br />
Confederation of Australian Industry, the Australian Council<br />
of Professions, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and a<br />
representative of the small business sector.<br />
The proposal to call the meeting arose out of today's<br />
discussion at EPAC of prices and incomes policy, which<br />
highlighted growth in executive remuneration very much<br />
faster than the growth of average weekly earnings over<br />
recent years.<br />
Prima facie this is inconsistent with the general principle<br />
agreed at the National Economic Summit Conference of April<br />
1983 and reaffirmed today that restraint in income claims is<br />
required to secure sustained growth in jobs and living<br />
standards, and that such restraint should be exercised<br />
universally. This meeting is intended to explore the causes of this<br />
development and to examine what can be done to encourage<br />
appropriate restraint in this area.<br />
Representatives of these groups have indicated their<br />
willingness to attend such a meeting. 004504 </p>
