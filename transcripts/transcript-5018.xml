PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 9 APRIL 1979<br />
PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED ON " NATIONWIDE", A. B. C. TV,<br />
ON TRUCKIES' DISPUTE<br />
Interview with Ted Stevens preceded interview.<br />
Ques tion:<br />
Prime Minister, you heard Ted Stevens say they want " the lot".<br />
What is your reaction?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I don't think anyone in the Australian commrunity can demand<br />
to be paid just what he himself believes he is worth. Now*<br />
whether that applies to you or to anyone else, or to me, it<br />
is just not going to work that way. We'd send the nation<br />
bankrupt. Question: What is the Commonwealth going to do?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
These blokes in the industry have had a problem and State Ministers<br />
meeting with Peter Nixon and themselves on Saturday, basically<br />
agreed to a number of measures which would go a long way<br />
towards overcoming it. The States indicated that the road<br />
maintenance charge would be of f; that they are going to look<br />
at leasing arrangements and licensing arrangements, finance,<br />
restrictive trade practices, better arnd fairer charging<br />
arrangments, competition from State railways a number of<br />
areas Governments have committed themselves, and the<br />
State Governments because they are the ones involved, to try<br />
to meet a number of the problems. Now whatever the merits of<br />
the particular case, it can't be solved by people blockading<br />
Australia's roads, trying to starve out the city of Sydney and<br />
causing immeasurable hardship to families, causing people to<br />
be stood down. Now it is basically a State problem at this<br />
point. State-police are involved. The State authorities have<br />
the general responsibility to keep Australia's highways open.<br />
They would have a capacity to move vehicles. Mr. Wran introduced<br />
special legislation which would give him, one might almost<br />
say Draconian powers.<br />
Ques tion:<br />
But there have been reports, Prime Minister, that you are ready<br />
to use the Army. Now can we find out what stage the Commonwealth<br />
is at? / 2 </p>
<p>Prime Minister:<br />
Yes, certainly we can, but let me just make the point that<br />
the general responsibility is the States'. There. are the<br />
State police who've got responsibilities for keeping highways<br />
open,.. for keeping traffic moving. The relationship of the<br />
truck'drivers is basically a relationship with State Governments,<br />
much more so than it is with the Federal Government and on<br />
that interview that was, I think, plain, for everyone to see.<br />
Now, we'vye said that if a State asks the Commonwealth to help<br />
and says " look, we can't undertake fully ourselves, we are<br />
deficient in resources", that we can well provide technical<br />
people engineers, mechanics, drivers that would enable<br />
trucks to be moved off the highways to the side of the road into<br />
a paddock where they could be impounded by the State authorities,<br />
the State police. There would have to be a request from a<br />
State Government and the State Government at the same time would<br />
have to make it perfectly plain that their own police force would<br />
provide whatever protection was necessary.<br />
Question: Are you saying that you feel that this is in fact what should<br />
happen that Commonwealth people, Army I suppose would be<br />
involved, should move in to move these trucks?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Let's not make too much of the point " Army" or defence service<br />
or Service personnel. We are talking of people who in fact<br />
would be mechanics to get trucks started; drivers; people<br />
with low loaders or tractors who could pull trucks that could<br />
not be started so that the sinews of commerce, the highways,<br />
could be opened. They are the sorts of people that we could<br />
supply if the States themselves thought they were unable to do so..<br />
The primary responsibility for maintaining law and order is<br />
the States and I have not seen any suggestion that that is beyond<br />
the capacity of the State police whether it is N. S. W. or any<br />
other State.<br />
Question: The Premier of N. S. W. has hinted that you could have indeed<br />
exacerbated the situation. He has said that it is the wrong<br />
time to make the sort of suggestions that you are making now,<br />
when he is very near, as he sees it, to resolving the dispute.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think the States need to know what the Commonwealth is prepared<br />
to do. We have surveyed the resources available to us today<br />
and I don't really think that Mr. Wran can stay with that<br />
particular comment because right at the beginning of this dispute,<br />
instead of talking with the truck drivers he pushed quite<br />
Draconian legislation through the State Parliament which would<br />
give him power to have a $ 1,000 fine, to confiscate trucks.--<br />
nobody knows under what terms and conditions they could be<br />
returned to the drivers and I think if anything flamed the<br />
dispute it was that particular action, when at that point, 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Prime Minister: ( continued)<br />
at the beginning of the dispute, it should havfe keen<br />
consultation, negotiation, but that wasn't Mr. Wran's<br />
first step.<br />
_ question:<br />
If I could just bring you back to the point that you've<br />
been making that it's really up to a State to look after this,<br />
to the States generally to look after this, what then do you<br />
think of the role of your Transport Minister, Mr. Nixon for<br />
intervening when he did and indeed he has been pretty<br />
trenchantly criticised.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Obviously States criticise a Commonwealth Minister if there is<br />
a State problem. That's the normal course of events.<br />
Question: He would have seemed to have put you up for $ 60 million would<br />
be not, by his comments that.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
That's an old comment, an old attitude, and it ought to be<br />
understood that the States over the last three years have all<br />
reduced taxation in a number of areas very very substantially<br />
indeed. It has not, to this point, been on the States' order<br />
of priorities to reduce or to abolish the road maintenance tax.<br />
Question: Mr. Nixon's statements didn't embarrass you at all?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, not at all. Of course not. There is no reason why they<br />
should because if this particular tax had been in the States'<br />
order of priorities for abolition they could have done it.<br />
They didn't. They had abolished other taxes instead over the<br />
last three years. In addition to that, of course, it is open<br />
to the States if they are only prepared to agree amongst themselves<br />
to have some kind of uniform licensing fee which gets away<br />
from the difficulties of the road maintenance tax but which at<br />
the same time would return the States' revenue.<br />
Question: You are buying into this dispute now after it has been running<br />
for a week. One wonders indeed whether you would have allowed<br />
the States' highways and the nation's highways to be blocked up<br />
so heavily indeed, if it had been unionists who had been<br />
involved. 4 </p>
<p>4-<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
A number of disputes are basically State disputes and the<br />
Commonwealth doesn't always get involved in those. Generally<br />
it stays out of them. There have been a numbe9 inh N. S. W.<br />
in particular which have just been a matter between the State<br />
and employees, trade unions, in N. S. W.<br />
Question: The truckies in N. S. W. have been watching you thus far<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Yes, I know, but if I could just finish answering the question;<br />
I think that the Commonwealth's position has been a very plain<br />
one. We don't want anyone to be denied the right to arbitration.<br />
We don't want anyone to be denied the right to have a fair go<br />
for whatever cause or complaint they've got, but whether it is<br />
the Transport Worker's Union or whether it is the truckies in<br />
this particular dispute, they've got no right to stop milk getting<br />
to families in Melbourne and Sydney, no right to keep hospitals<br />
short of fresh. food, no right to cause immeasurable hardship<br />
and harm to people who get stood down because there is now work<br />
for them to do at their normal workplaces and factories. Whether<br />
it is the Transport Worker's Union, who was condemned roundly<br />
by the Government some days ago, or the truckies at the moment,<br />
so far as that goes the principle is the same. Now whatever<br />
the merits we might feel about a number of the points that the<br />
truck drivers have put forward to State Governments, that doesn't<br />
avoid the fact that the tactics that are being used are wrong;<br />
are causing grievous harm and if they continue that will only<br />
multiply many times over the next few days.<br />
( REPORT FROM SITE OF TRUCKIES' BLOCKADES)<br />
Question: Prime Minister, you've heard that they don't seem to believe<br />
that they are getting their message across, that the public<br />
understand them. Do you feel any sympathy for them. I mean,<br />
would you like to work an 80-hour week for less than the<br />
basic wage?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think I said, when we were talking earlier, that there are<br />
very real difficulties in a number of the things that the<br />
truck drivers have put forward. That was recognised last<br />
Saturday by the State Transport Ministers when they met. A<br />
number of things, as I am advised by Peter Nixon, were basically<br />
agreed. I think it would be a good idea, since a number of<br />
truckies are watching this, to if I could emphasise that<br />
one, that the road maintenance charges will be replaced and<br />
two, that the road limits for the 38 tonne limit doesn't apply;<br />
it will apply, and that has been an important matter for a<br />
number of them, as I am advised. It was also agreed that urgent </p>
<p>Prime Minister: ( continued)<br />
action should be taken to improve the overall position with<br />
respect to freight rates of the owner-drivers -There have<br />
been problems there with cut throat competition amongst<br />
thems eIlves and I think sometimes also some unfair competition<br />
with State Railways systems.<br />
Question:<br />
When you say that State road tax, Prime Minister, is going to<br />
be taken away, you said initially that there was no way<br />
that you would pick up the tab for this.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, we're not going to. That's a matter that the States have<br />
decided. And they have decided that. That was their decision.<br />
But in addition to that, in terms of being able to charge a<br />
reasonable rate we have indicated that we will look at the<br />
Trade Practices Act and also, another point, to enable an<br />
arbitration type system to be established covering ownmer-drivers'<br />
freight rates and conditions and a licensing scheme for<br />
interstate hauliers which might well greatly improve the system<br />
and stop the industry being over-trucked as we were told earlier<br />
tonight that it was; one final point, a road haulier's<br />
advisory service, it was also agreed that should be established.<br />
Now, they've got those points through to State Ministers, as<br />
I am advised by Peter Nixon. That's basically what the States<br />
have agreed to; that package of proposals. Now, why therefore,<br />
is it necessary to continue with blockades in N. S. W, in Adelaide<br />
and wherever else they might be. If milk and eggs get through<br />
to hospitals there is a question of the average family in<br />
the suburbs, there is also the question of people who get stood<br />
down in factories because they can't get the raw materials<br />
to keep that factory going.<br />
Question: The Commonwealth then seems to be basically leaving this up<br />
to the truckies' good nature...<br />
Prime Minis ter:<br />
Well, it's basically a matter for the States; also, as I said<br />
earlier, to do what they can to get the highways open. I know<br />
the States could do that if they wanted to. So far they have<br />
not moved. If the States say " this is beyond us", say that<br />
to the Commonwealth: "' this is beyond us, we want some technical<br />
help from you so that we can move vehicles", then the Commonwealth<br />
is prepared to assist.<br />
I think just one last point, I said the Commonwealth is prepared<br />
to assist but that is in terms of technical people, mechanics,<br />
who can move vehicles. We have never at any time suggested that<br />
the capacity of State police forces is inadequate and I am<br />
certain that it is not. 000---</p>
