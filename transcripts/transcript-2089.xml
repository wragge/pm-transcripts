THE MOON LANDING: PRIME MINISTER'S COMMENTS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton, visited Honeysuckle<br />
Creek early this morning to watch the Tracking Station making its final<br />
preparations to take over a key phase of communications with the Apollo<br />
astronauts. He spent about 45 minutes at the Station, during which he<br />
was taken on a tour of inspection by the Director, Mr. Tom Reid. He was<br />
later briefed on aspects of the Mission by Mr. Reid, Mr. Willson H.<br />
Hunter, NASA's Senior Scientific Representative in Australia, Mr. A. S.<br />
Cooley, the Secretary of the Department of Supply and Mr. L. F. Bott,<br />
Deputy Secretary of the Department of Supply.<br />
Before leaving Honeysuckle Creek to return to his office at<br />
Parliament House, Mr. Gorton paid tribute to the United States and the<br />
astronauts:-" THIS, THE FIRST LANDING OF MAN ON THE<br />
MOON, IS A SUCCESS WHICH EXCITES THE WONDER AND<br />
ADMIRATION OF US ALL. THE UNITED STATES HAS ACHIEVED<br />
A GREAT AND PEACEFUL TRIUMPH FOR MANIKIND GENERALLY.<br />
ALL AUSTRALIANS CONGRATULATE THE<br />
UNITED STATES, THE THREE ASTRONAUTS, NEIL ARMSTRONG,<br />
EDWIN ALDRIN AND MICHAEL COLLINS, THES N1ATIONAL<br />
AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION AND THOSE<br />
PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD WHO HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED<br />
WITH THIS APOLLO MISSION. AUSTRALIA IS PROUD TO BE<br />
PLAYING A PART IN THIS ADVENTURE THROUGH ITS TRACKING<br />
STATIONS, THROUGH THE PARKES RADIO TELESCOPE AND<br />
THROUGH OTHER FACILITIES. THIS MOON LANDING WILL<br />
BEGIN A NEW ERA IN SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND<br />
IT DEMONSTRATES IN THE MOST DRAMATIC WAY WHAT MAN<br />
CAN DO BY THE APPLICATION OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY<br />
FOR PEACEFUL USES.<br />
WE MARVEL AT THE HIGH COURAGE AND THE<br />
SKILL OF THE ASTRONAUTS AND AT THE SCIENTIFIC<br />
GENIUS WHICH MADE THIS ADVENTURE POSSIBLE. THESE<br />
ASTRONAUTS HAVE DARED DANGEROUSLY AND SUCCESSFULLY<br />
AND THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT MAN'S URGE TO GO ALWAYS<br />
A LITTLE FURTHER, TO EXPLORE AND KNOW THE PREVIOUSLY<br />
UNKNOWN, TO STRIVE, TO SEEK, TO FIND AND NOT TO YIELD.<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
THERE IS NO TIME MORE MEMORABLE THAN<br />
A FIRST TIME, NO TRIUMPH GREATER THAN ONE SOUGHT<br />
AND ACHIEVED IN PEACE AND THE WORLD IS THE RICHER<br />
BECAUSE OF THIS EPIC JOURNEY.<br />
TO THME MEN ON THE MOON, WE SAY:-<br />
' THANK GODSPEED.....<br />
AND A SAFE RETURN HOME.'" o<br />
Following is the transcript of a brief interview with the<br />
Prime Minister at Honeysuckle Creek:-<br />
Q. Prime Minister, as a former fighter pilot yourself, only<br />
twenty-five years ago you were flying Hurricanes what<br />
did they do 350 miles an hour?<br />
PM. Well, that's what they used to say in the papers but in<br />
point of fact they used to cruise at about 180. They<br />
would do 350 for about 30 seconds before the engines<br />
blew up:<br />
Q. Could you possibly imagine at that time that you would<br />
see a man on the moon in 25 years' time?<br />
PM. I suppose that I could have imagined it myself but this<br />
was because I was a devotee of science fiction and it<br />
didn't seem impossible that man would go further and<br />
further into space. But one couldn't do other than have<br />
faith, that it would happen.<br />
Q. We wiere not allowed to take a sound camera into the<br />
tracking station for technical reasons. What did you<br />
say to the staff of the tracking station here at Honeysuckle<br />
Creek?<br />
PM. Well, I asked them what all the wriggly green lines<br />
were and what the various noises coming out of bits<br />
and pieces of the equipment were, and got answers<br />
which I wouldn't pretend thoroughly to understand. I<br />
think perhaps the best way of saying what I felt when 1<br />
was in there was that I was blinded by science.<br />
The Prime Minister has sent this personal message to<br />
President Nixon1 ( via our Ambassador in Washington):-/ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
" THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAS<br />
TODAY MADE HISTORY.<br />
I SEND YOU, ON BEHALF OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE, OUR WARM CONGRATULATIONS<br />
ON THE SUCCESSFUL FIRST LANDING OF MEN ON THE<br />
MOON. WE HAVE GREAT ADMIRATION FOR THE<br />
COURAGE, SELF-DISCIPLINE AND SKILLS OF YOUR<br />
ASTRONAUTS AND SALUTE ALL THOSE WHO HAVE<br />
CONTRIBUTED TO THIS GREAT, PEACEFUL ACHIEVEMENT.<br />
A NEW ERA HAS BEGUN IN SPACE SCIENCE<br />
AND SPACE TECHNOLOGY AND WE WISH YOU EVERY<br />
SUCCESS WITH THE NEXT STAGE.<br />
TO NEIL ARMSTRONG, EDWIN ALDRIN AND<br />
MICHAEL COLLINS WE SAY:-<br />
' GODSPEED AND A SAFE JOURNEY HOME.'<br />
Mr. Gorton, who spent the day preparing for the<br />
pre-Budget Cabinet meetings beginning tomorrow, watched the historic<br />
first step on to the moon on a television set in his office.<br />
