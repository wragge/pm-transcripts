PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHRISTMAS MESSAGE<br />
It is from the Christmas story that the spiritual strength of so many<br />
Australians derives.<br />
Christmas is a time for family and friends to come together. For most of<br />
us it will be a time of plenty and a time for celebration. We will renew<br />
links with the past and look forward to another eventful and fulfilling year.<br />
But as we celebrate we should spare a thought for those who are less able<br />
to fuilly enjoy the spirit of Christmas.<br />
At times we may take it for granted that Australia is indeed the Lucky<br />
Country. But even in the Lucky Country tragedy can strike with<br />
unexpected brutality and force. Port Arthur was one such event during the<br />
year which shook the nation to its foundations. But in the wake of such<br />
tragedy we came together as a nation to reduce the opportunity for such<br />
incidents in the future.<br />
At Christmas it is worth remembering the qualities that set Australia apart<br />
as a nation. The tolerance, understanding and freedom that are the<br />
hallmarks of our society are all elements which should be recognised and<br />
nurtured as special qualities which must be preserved and never taken for<br />
granted. Christmas is a time to reflect on the great benefits of living in<br />
such an environment and of the need to preserve such qualities for future<br />
generations through co-operation and vigilance.<br />
My wife and children join me in wishing all Australians a Merry<br />
Christmas. </p>
