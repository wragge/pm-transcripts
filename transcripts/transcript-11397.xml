<p>Well, thank you very much. To Kim Beazley the Leader of the Opposition,</p>
<p> to Steve Waugh and the victorious Australian Cricket Team, to many</p>
<p> others - first time I've had all of you cheering for me - but ladies</p>
<p> and gentlemen it is a tremendous pleasure tonight to have everybody</p>
<p> along and I want to particularly welcome the members of the Australian</p>
<p> Women's Cricket Team who are amongst us as our special guests as well.</p>
<p>Tonight is one of those rare occasions where the guns of political</p>
<p> battle are stilled, that everybody, irrespective of their differences</p>
<p> of opinion on other issues, come together to pay tribute to a remarkable</p>
<p> sporting achievement. To pay tribute to a group of men who have demonstrated</p>
<p> their tremendous capacity on the sporting field, have brought immense</p>
<p> pleasure and immense delight and immense national pride to all Australians.</p>
<p> And the performance, Steve, of you and your colleagues to win seven</p>
<p> in a row, the third and second last of those two being amongst the</p>
<p> most exciting one-day cricket matches that I think any of us have</p>
<p> ever witnessed, I think it is fair to say that these sleep deprivation</p>
<p> syndrome of members of Parliament and of their staff and indeed millions</p>
<p> of Australians all around the country was very intense indeed.</p>
<p>Australia is a great sports loving nation, Australia is a great cricket</p>
<p> loving nation. And cricket in a way unites all of us like no other</p>
<p> sport because it is in every sense of the word our true national sport.</p>
<p> And to you, Steve, in particular tremendous credit is due. You followed</p>
<p> two very fine Australian Captains, you experienced, along with your</p>
<p> colleagues during the early stages of the World Cup tournament, you</p>
<p> experienced a tremendous degree of criticism from some sections of</p>
<p> the press. There were many people who at various stages were willing</p>
<p> to say that Australia was not going to make the semi-finals let alone</p>
<p> the finals let alone take out the trophy. But you persevered and you</p>
<p> yourself with that marvellous 123 - one of the best if not the greatest</p>
<p> one-day innings that I have ever seen. You kept your cool in remarkably</p>
<p> difficult circumstances. You showed tremendous grit, tremendous leadership</p>
<p> and when we think of the true Aussie spirit and the true Aussie grit</p>
<p> many Australians will instinctively think of your personal performance</p>
<p> in that particular match. And, of course, one doesn't have the time</p>
<p> to talk about all of the individual performances but collectively</p>
<p> the team has done us proud.</p>
<p>And to all of you can I say that nothing has quite brought such sporting</p>
<p> joy to a sporting nation as much as did your victory. And the reception</p>
<p> that you have received in Melbourne, in Sydney today, the reception</p>
<p> that I saw a number of you receive at Stadium Australia on Saturday</p>
<p> night before the rugby test between England and Australia, the gathering</p>
<p> here tonight which brings together Members and Senators, Ministers,</p>
<p> Shadow Ministers, Prime Minister, Opposition Leader, staff and most</p>
<p> importantly of all the cricket loving youngsters of the parliamentary</p>
<p> family. And because every time we do well on the sporting field, every</p>
<p> time we do well on the cricket field we build something that is most</p>
<p> important to all of us who are cricket lovers and that is a renewed</p>
<p> enthusiasm for the greatest sport of all amongst the young people</p>
<p> of Australia. And that is what your victory has done more than anything</p>
<p> else, it has brought fresh enthusiasm and pride and love of this wonderful</p>
<p> game to the young people of Australia. And can I say of all the gifts</p>
<p> and of all the pleasure that you have given to the people of Australia</p>
<p> I think the most important thing you have done is once again to enthuse</p>
<p> and re-enthuse and re-ignite the passion of young Australians to the</p>
<p> great and noble game of cricket.</p>
<p>Can I say on behalf of the Government, on behalf of the people of</p>
<p> Australia and I know my sentiments will be echoed by my colleague</p>
<p> Kim Beazley in a few moments, thank you very much for what you have</p>
<p> done, you deserve tremendous credit. I hope you and your families</p>
<p> now have the opportunity of a bit of a break before you join the fray</p>
<p> again but you really have done us proud. You are a tremendous group</p>
<p> of sportsmen and you have brought a great deal of joy and a great</p>
<p> deal of pleasure to all Australians. Thank you very much.</p>
