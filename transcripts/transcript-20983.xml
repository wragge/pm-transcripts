    <content><![CDATA[<p>Reginald Murray Williams was a legendary Australian who from humble beginnings launched a successful business that became a household name throughout the nation.</p>
<p>Driven by his love of our country, "R.M." was a passionate advocate for rural and regional Australia, with his pioneering efforts contributing to the settlement and growth of country areas.</p>
<p>He was a shining example of the spirit of the great Australian adventurer, rising from the adversity of the Great Depression to write his name into history as a bush craftsman and generous sponsor of outback ethic and culture.</p>
<p>In particular, one of his great ambitions was to establish the Stockman's Hall of Fame which he helped bring about at Longreach in 1988.</p>
<p>Born in 1908 at Belalie North, near the Flinders Ranges, his early childhood was spent in remote South Australia.</p>
<p>He took up a range of occupations, working as a lime burner in the Victorian Mallee, a prospector in the Western Australian goldfields and on a surveying team in remote areas of South Australia and Western Australia.</p>
<p> Like many in the bush, he struggled to make a living during the Great Depression.</p>
<p>It was during these early years that "R.M." began to design and make boots, saddlery, and other bush equipment for use on remote stations.</p>
<p>He quickly built a reputation for crafting high quality leather and bush products many of which, including the famous Drizabone, are sold as outdoor and fashion accessories throughout the world.</p>
<p> From these humble and industrious beginnings, his business grew into a successful global company acknowledged across Australia as a national icon.</p>
<p>  "R.M." will be greatly missed. I offer my sincerest condolences to his family and many friends.  </p>
