    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australians are so proud of you. Proud of your discipline, professionalism and preparedness to put your lives on the line.</p>
<p>For us.</p>
<p>You keep us safe in a dangerous world. You defend our freedom.</p>
<p>And you do so in an entirely modern way with the technology and science of 2015.</p>
<p>But with the same values of mateship and patriotism as your ANZAC forebears of 1915.</p>
<p>This Christmas we thank you, the men and women of the ADF, and especially those of you who are serving abroad – around the world, in the deserts and skies of Iraq, the high hills of Afghanistan or the high seas – away from your family and loved ones.</p>
<p>Christmas is a joyful time when we catch up with friends and family we see too rarely in our busy lives. But it is also a poignant time when absences are most keenly felt, especially those who have died in Australia's service.</p>
<p>We honour their sacrifice. We renew our pledge to support their families just as we pledge to support our veterans.</p>
<p>In this ANZAC centenary year we do not forget that the best way to honour the diggers of 1915 is to support the servicemen and women, and the veterans of 2015.</p>
<p>The ADF has more than 2,200 servicemen and women deployed overseas from Africa to the Middle East to the Pacific.     </p>
<p>The Army's Task Group Taji oversaw the first two graduations of Iraqi soldiers in June and November, with approximately 4,200 troops trained or being trained to assist the ongoing nation-building effort in Iraq and in taking the fight to Daesh. Our special forces likewise are assisting their Iraqi counterparts.  And our Air Force have six FA-18s and other aircraft involved in missions in that theatre. These operations are ably supported by our people in the Middle East and back here in Australia.</p>
<p>This year saw a new phase in your important work in Afghanistan, with the start of Operation Highroad, advising and mentoring Afghan National Defence and Security Forces.</p>
<p>And our Navy has been deployed, including to the Gulf where it has aided efforts to counter terrorism and piracy in the region – seizing billions of dollars’ worth of illegal drugs.</p>
<p>Shortly after World War One, Lieutenant-General Sir John Monash said in a Christmas message to our returned troops:</p>
<p>"You diggers have learnt during the war the value of comradeship, self-sacrifice, mutual trust between your leaders and yourselves, and how to labour in a common cause. These are lessons you have purchased dearly.  It is up to you and me ... [to] never to forget these lessons."</p>
<p>So, wherever you are serving, thank you again for your continuing service, and on behalf of Lucy and our family and all Australians wish you all a very Happy Christmas and good fortune for 2016.</p>
