PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 10 DECEMBER 1990<br />
JOINT STATEMENT WITH THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND<br />
TREASURER, PAUL KEATING<br />
We have today had a long and constructive conversation in<br />
which Paul conveyed he had intended no offence nor implied<br />
any challenge t~ o me in his remarks last Friday night.<br />
The Treasurer apologised for any harm his remarks caused.<br />
I said to him that I intended to remain through this term as<br />
leader of the Party and wished to see him continue as Deputy<br />
Prime Minister and Treasurer.<br />
Paul confirmed that he totally concurred with this course.<br />
We confirmed ou~ r commitment to continue together to pursue<br />
the creation of' a more competitive economy with lower levels<br />
of inflation and to expose the inadequacies and dangers of<br />
the Opposition's regressive prescriptions. </p>
