EXTRACT PRIME MINISTER AT GOLDEN WEST T. V.-<br />
18 October 1984<br />
JOURNALIST: *. public debate with Mr Peacock your attitude<br />
an that. the attitude. What I've said earlier on that Mr Peacock's<br />
behaviour over recent months has been so appalling, the making of<br />
false charges, the embracing of the tactic of smear and Innuendo<br />
and insinuation totally baseless. It's not one that's made me<br />
feel that I should with him. But I've said, at least alluded(?),<br />
we'll probably debate with him. But you see I debate with him all.<br />
the time in the parliment.<br />
JOURNALIST: But it's a little bit-different isn't It?<br />
On the contrary It's easier debating outside the Parliament.<br />
It's much easier and I have no worries about debating Mr Peacock.<br />
That's not the point, one wonders whether I should . with him reeally<br />
But I believe that it It's appropriate that at some stage during<br />
the campaign I should have a debate with him. I look forward to<br />
it because, as I say, I've nothing to worry about. Owr policies<br />
a" o better. they ' ve worked better than the I<br />
previous Government's,.<br />
the record of the Liberal and the National Parties in Goverm~ ent and<br />
in opposition is absolutely appalling. It's recognised by the people'<br />
to be so. I'm quite happy about It. As I say we'll work It out<br />
Just when and how we'll do-it. </p>
