<p>We contracted out the provision of services to a migrant<br />welfare group in Melbourne and the experiment looks like<br />being an outstanding success. We are conducting an extensive<br />information campaign through the ethnic press to inform migrants<br />of their rights regarding Government services available to them.<br />And we have appointed the Ghlbally Enquiry into Post-Arrival<br />Services for Migrants, which will, I believe, lead to dramatic<br />new -, programmes-for migrants in this country. Recently, We have<br />announced a further $ 2.3 million for the migrant education<br />programme, which includes funds for intensive English language<br />courses during the December-January v4acation period using<br />excess capacity in language laboratories which might otherwise<br />lie dormant during the vacation period. This idea arose out of<br />the work of the Galbally Review.....<br />As we promised, all our policies are designed to increase<br />individual choice, to allow all Australians to make more<br />important decisions affecting their... own. 1Ives..<br />our taxticuts have allowed Australians m~ ore say over how their<br />:. own bard-earned-income is spent. -Government policies-. to assist<br />abrgnlconuunities have been re -oriented to give first<br />priority-to aborigines participating in running their owrL<br />programues; and of course our reforms of Meclibank, which are<br />n~ ow widely popular and widely accepted, have restored freedom<br />of. choice in health insurance-..<br />As we promised, we have reversed those Labor policies which<br />discriminated agaiyist the rural community. Far more money is<br />given to local govermrent and to rural roads. Income<br />. equalisation-deposits-and tax averaging have greatly helped to-<br />.!: Maintain incom~ es of rural producers during ~ a difficult period of.<br />* depressed markets, rising costs, and now a terrible drought.<br />Our recent package of assistance to the cattle industry and our<br />decision to establish an Australian Rural Bank clearly demonstrate<br />our determination to ensure the continued viability of o-ur rural<br />industries.<br />One group in our coimunity that has been through a most difficult<br />period and which we have actcd to help and will continue to<br />assist is the small businessman. The tax concessions we have<br />introduced have greatly helped small buainess particularly the<br />trading stock evaluation adjustment, the easing of division 7 tax<br />and the cuts in personal income tax. We realised that a mAjor<br />-problem facing the s= 11l businessman was-his diffIculty in<br />obtaining adequate funds to finance-growth and expansion.<br />3-ecause-of this, we have recently introduced a package of<br />measures to. make f inance more readily available to small business.<br />Ladies and gentlemen, a start has been made. Much of what we<br />undertook in 1975. has, already been. fulfilled. We can proudly<br />assert no Government has in just two years-legislated more<br />thoroughly to reform our society, to bring about the recovery<br />of our-economy. No Government has d mnstrated such a real<br />concern for individual rights. / But</p>
<p>IP.. opi3 4<br />7-<br />But much more remains to be done, and we cannot afford to<br />relax one-moment: in our. fight to keep inflation moving<br />further-: downwards, in our determination to get Australia<br />on the move Again..-<br />Only a Libetial.. Governzoent. has the policies, the ministers and<br />the wia1l tomake. Australia the great country we all know it<br />can be. I know that you will all take., up my irvitationand<br />challenge to work with me and my fellow Liberal M. P.&amp;-in<br />ensuring,-: the-triumphant return of a Liberal.-Government on<br />.4.<br />t X.'</p>
