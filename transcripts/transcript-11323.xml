    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much, to General Hartley, to Mr Owen Campbell, all</p>
<p> of the other members of the mission, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>Janette and I are particularly privileged to have the opportunity</p>
<p> of being here today in this marvellous and very historic military</p>
<p> surrounding, Victoria Barracks, to formally, on behalf of the Government</p>
<p> and through it the Australian people, to wish the Sandakan Mission</p>
<p> well, to say a few words about the importance of a nation honouring</p>
<p> and remembering those who made our freedom possible and to express</p>
<p> good wishes to all of those in the pilgrimage. And to say how delighted</p>
<p> we are that this is an opportunity, although it commemorates a tragic,</p>
<p> a terribly tragic event, how delighted we are that it's an opportunity</p>
<p> for old friends and old comrades and their families to come together</p>
<p> for a few days and to reflect upon the tremendous privilege it is</p>
<p> to live in Australia as we come towards the end of this century.</p>
<p>There are many things that have been written about Sandakan and there</p>
<p> are many things that can be said about it. It was, like so many events</p>
<p> in a terrible war, an awful tragedy. There was an added poignancy</p>
<p> about it because so many of those terrible events took place within</p>
<p> a bare few weeks of the end of hostilities in World War II. And the</p>
<p> suffering of the men who endured those terrible deeds is, to the present</p>
<p> generation of Australians, hard to envisage and hard to understand,</p>
<p> just as the suffering of those who died on the Burma-Thailand Railway</p>
<p> and, indeed, of any Australians who died defending this country in</p>
<p> all the wars in which we have been involved.</p>
<p>It is one of the more encouraging signs of our national life but as</p>
<p> we come towards the end of this century there is a growing instinct</p>
<p> and a growing desire on the part of all generations of Australians,</p>
<p> and most particularly younger Australians, to remember those events</p>
<p> that have made our present life possible - to give thanks to those</p>
<p> people who laid down their lives to make Australia free. And there</p>
<p> is a greater reverence and a greater respect as the years go by for</p>
<p> those men and those women for what they did and for what those deeds</p>
<p> represented. And whereas 50 years ago there were sometimes arguments</p>
<p> about the place of ANZAC Day in our life, as every year goes by it</p>
<p> becomes more hallowed and more revered and increasingly it is seen</p>
<p> in the eyes of all Australians as holding a special significance beyond</p>
<p> any other day in our national life.</p>
<p>And I want to say to all of the men and women who were so involved</p>
<p> in the events that you will remember over the days ahead that a grateful</p>
<p> nation will never forget your contribution. They will always remember</p>
<p> that without that contribution we would not enjoy the incredible freedom</p>
<p> and the great prosperity and the great privilege of living in Australia</p>
<p> today.</p>
<p>As I wandered around today I've renewed acquaintanceships and</p>
<p> friendships with a number of the returned servicemen who are going</p>
<p> on the mission, some of which, in my own journey through life I've</p>
<p> come into contact with in other circumstances. I think of Alan Loxton</p>
<p> who tried to teach me the vagaries of criminal law at Sydney University</p>
<p> in 1957, of Jim Millner who I've met on many occasions around</p>
<p> the city of Sydney. And I understand that in Father Rogers we have</p>
<p> the sole surviving chaplain now of the 8th Division of</p>
<p> the Australian Army in World War II. And one could tell a special</p>
<p> personal story about every member of this mission and most particularly</p>
<p> of course, Mr Campbell, who has a very special place in the membership</p>
<p> of this gathering.</p>
<p>This is not a mission that celebrates the triumphalism that some people</p>
<p> wrongly associate with military victory. It's a mission that</p>
<p> remembers, it's a mission that expresses gratitude and it's</p>
<p> a mission that says on behalf of a grateful nation how indebted we</p>
<p> are to the people who suffered and died. But it's also a reminder</p>
<p> to us that life has gone on and it's a reminder to us that out</p>
<p> of the terrible bitterness and the slaughter and the evil of World</p>
<p> War II Australia, since then, has forged new relationships, new friendships</p>
<p> and a new future with the people of the Asian Pacific region.</p>
<p>We are entitled to always, and we must always remember, the injustices</p>
<p> of war. We should never shrink from the historical truth of how war</p>
<p> began and we should never ever yield in our determination to remember</p>
<p> the deeds and the sacrifices of the men and women who died in war.</p>
<p> But the best way in which we can do that and the best way that we</p>
<p> can honour them is of course to build a lasting peace and secure relationships</p>
<p> with the nations of our region.</p>
<p>Can I say on behalf of the Government how immensely proud we are of</p>
<p> the men and women of our armed services today, very much in the news</p>
<p> over the last 48 hours and properly so. They are very much the equal</p>
<p> of the task that continues to be upon them as they have been in the</p>
<p> past.</p>
<p>And finally can I say, on behalf of the Government of Australia to</p>
<p> all the members of the mission, I wish you well. I hope it is a time</p>
<p> of positive reflection. An occasion naturally to remember with sadness</p>
<p> and trauma the loss of so many mates in such terrible circumstances</p>
<p> but also an opportunity to celebrate the miracle of life for all of</p>
<p> us and for our families and the wonderful existence we have in Australia</p>
<p> today and the wonderful future that lies ahead of our nation. To all</p>
<p> of those who fought for our nation I say thank you. To those who died</p>
<p> for our nation on the nation's behalf I honour them. They shall</p>
<p> always be in our hearts.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
