    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am very pleased to announce the membership of the independent Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation. The establishment of the Foundation was foreshadowed earlier in the year and funding details were provided in the Budget papers.</p>
<p>Abuse of alcohol is a major cause of preventable death and hospitalisation in Australia. As well as the damage caused directly by alcohol abuse it is also a significant factor in many road accidents, falls, drownings, suicides and mental disorders. The financial cost alone is estimated at $4.5 billion per year.</p>
<p>The government has earmarked $115 million for the Foundation over the next four years to fund community-based education and rehabilitation projects to prevent alcohol and other licit substance abuse. I am sure that the Foundation will also be able to attract donations from the business sector and the wider community to build on the government's contribution.</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Foundation will be Professor Ian Webster. Professor Webster is exceptionally well qualified for this role and is highly respected in the drug and alcohol field. He is the President of the Alcohol and other Drugs Council of Australia, Chairman of the National Advisory Council on Suicide Prevention, Chairman of the New South Wales Expert Advisory Committee on Drugs and a member of the Australian National Council on Drugs. In addition to his academic expertise and important work in public health policy, Professor Webster has practical experience, including as the visiting physician to the Matthew Talbot Hostel for the homeless.</p>
<p>The Foundation will bring together a group of people who will offer a wide range of perspectives and expertise. A full list of members is attached. I thank each member for being available to serve the community in this way and am confident that they will ensure the success of the Foundation in achieving its objectives.</p>
<p>The Foundation has several members in common with the Australian National Council on Drugs. This reflects the expertise of these members in the areas of both licit and illicit drugs and will ensure effective links between the two bodies. The funding of the Foundation is consistent with advice from the Council, chaired by Major Brian Watters, which has supported the funding of activities to reduce the harm associated with alcohol abuse. The Foundation's work in funding education and rehabilitation activities will complement the policy role of the Council.</p>
