PRISS STATEiMENT IHO.<br />
22 December 1972<br />
CRAFTS INQUIRY<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, has decided to expand<br />
the membership of the Committee of Inquiry into the Crafts to include<br />
practising craftsmen and representatives of crafts in education and<br />
industry. Mr. ' Jhitlam said the Government would take steps to<br />
expedite the work of the committee which was established more than<br />
twelve months ago.<br />
The committee will appoint professional assistants to<br />
help prepare its report to the Government.<br />
The findings of the committee will have an important<br />
bearing on new developments in the crafts field.<br />
The Prime Minister has invited four new members to<br />
join the committee. The present members of the Committee are:-<br />
Mr. K. Bonython ( Chairman)<br />
Mr. E. YTestbrook<br />
Mr. J. Mollison<br />
Hr. F. McCarthy<br />
IMr. C. Last<br />

Mr. Ian Templenan Director of the Fremantle Arts<br />
Centre and former Federal<br />
Secretary of the Australian<br />
Society for Education through Art..<br />
Mrs Marea Gazzard One of Lustralia's leading potters<br />
who is Vice-President of the<br />
Asian Division of the Vorld<br />
Craft Council.<br />
Ir, % Thitlam said the Committee of Inquiry would present<br />
to the Government at the earliest possible date a report on the<br />
present situation of craftsmen and crafts organisations in Australia,<br />
on ways in which they might be assisted, and on irays of extending<br />
interest and activity in the crafts throughout the community.<br />
In this respect it was essential to have on the Committee<br />
people with special knowledge of the crafts and their place in<br />
education, their role in leisure and their uses in industry.<br />
In giving high priority to action of the crafts, the<br />
Government acknowledges the special pleasure which the crafts<br />
bring to thousands of Australians. There is at present a great<br />
revival of interest in weaving, and pottery, leather and metalwork,<br />
carving and glasswork and other craft forms. LMany young people<br />
who seek beyond the pressures and products of modern urban life a<br />
more personal and satisfying life style are particularly attracted<br />
by them. Their combination of creative ideas and technical skills<br />
suggests further links to people whose working background gives<br />
them a special knowledge of handling materials and applying<br />
techniques. The trade unions in their earliest form grew out<br />
of the guilds of craftsmen who in past centuries took a special<br />
pride in their work and its standards.<br />
