FOR PRESS Statement by the Rt. Hon. John McEwen<br />
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry<br />
The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade<br />
and Industry, Mr. McEwen, left Sydney to-day to lead the<br />
Australian delegation to the International Sugar Conference<br />
which will commence in Geneva on 17th April.<br />
Before his departure Mr. McEwen said that the<br />
conference had been convened by the Secretary-General of<br />
Dr. Prebisch, with the purpose of negotiating<br />
a new International Sugar Agreement aimed at improving the<br />
conditions of trade for sugar.<br />
Australia was the world's second largest exporter<br />
of sugar and had a vital interest in the outcome of the<br />
conference. Mr. McEwen said that for many years the free<br />
market for sugar had been regulated by successive<br />
International Sugar Agreements. However, in 1961, following<br />
the breach in relations between the United States and Cuba,<br />
the regulatory provisions of the then current I. S. A. were<br />
suspended. Cuba is the world's largest sugar exporter and<br />
before 1961 was the major supplier to the U. S. market.<br />
Sugar prices had risen sharply following the<br />
dislocation of production in Cuba after 1961, but in recent<br />
years prices had declined to near disaster levels creating<br />
considerable financial distress for the sugar industries in<br />
most exporting countries, including Australia. 265 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Mr. McEwen recalled that an earlier negotiating<br />
conference was held in 1965. At that time it had proved<br />
impossible to reach agreement and undoubtedly this had been<br />
an important factor contributing to the depressed prices<br />
which had ruled in the world free market ever since.<br />
Since 1965 a great deal of time and effort had<br />
been expended by Australia and the other major sugar importing<br />
and exporting countries in developing a basis for a new<br />
international sugar agreement. Mr. McEwen said that some<br />
fourteen such meetings had been held under the auspices of<br />
U. N. C. T. A. D. and the International Sugar Council and it was<br />
encouraging that Dr. Prebisch felt sufficiently confident to<br />
call a new conference.<br />
However, Mr. McEwen said a number of important and<br />
difficult issues had still to be resolved.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that the programme of expansion<br />
which the Australian industry had embarked upon in 1963 had<br />
been completed and exports totalling nearly 2m. tons were now<br />
expected from the 1968 crop. In these circumstances the<br />
greater predictability in the export prospects for sugar which<br />
would result from an effective sugar agreement was of tremendous<br />
importance to Australia.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that he was very pleased that<br />
Mr. J. C. A. Pizzey, Premier of Queensland, would also attend the<br />
conference as Deputy Leader of the delegation. The sugar<br />
industry was of vital importance to Queensland and Mr. Pizzeyts<br />
attendance would be of great value. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Mr. McEwen explained that if he was unable to<br />
stay until the end of the conference, his place as leader of<br />
the delegation would be taken by the Minister for Primary<br />
Industry, Mr. J. D. Anthony.<br />
The Australian delegation would also include the<br />
