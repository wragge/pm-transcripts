ADDRESS TO THE NATION ON THE ECONOMIC SITUATION<br />
THE HON. R. J. L. HAWKE, AC, MP<br />
CANBERRA 11 JUNE 1986<br />
Good evening,<br />
As a nation we now have to do some tough and challenging<br />
things together. I want to tell you<br />
why we must do them,<br />
what some of those-things are,<br />
why we will overcome the challenge facing us as a<br />
nation.<br />
Let me first put the position as concisely as possible:<br />
Our exports of commodities such as wool, wheat, coal and<br />
iron ore have, for a long time, been a major source of our<br />
national income.<br />
While the prices we pay for our imports have continued to<br />
rise, the prices we get for these exports have for a<br />
considerable period been gradually, and now dramatically,<br />
declining. This most recent turnaround in the terms of trade has<br />
slashed three per cent off our capacity to maintain existing<br />
living standards. </p>
<p>The plight of the farmers and other exporters is not<br />
something for them alone to bear it must mean restraint<br />
for all of us.<br />
The reality is that the outside world is paying us less<br />
our standards must adjust accordingly.<br />
As a consequence;<br />
we have, for the time being, to accept reduced standards<br />
of living and, permanently, increased standards of<br />
effort, we have, in the past three years, shown that we could,<br />
by working together, meet and overcome the economic<br />
crisis that confronted our country. A different crisis<br />
the same people we can do it again.<br />
I now go to more detail.<br />
WHAT IS REQUIRED<br />
We must obtain a lower wage outcome than anticipated when<br />
the Accord was renegotiated last September.<br />
The delay in the present case will, to some extent, produce<br />
this result.<br />
More is required. </p>
<p>The 2.3 per cent which should flow from this case should be<br />
the only national wage increase in 1986.<br />
We believe now it will be necessary to argue for a further<br />
discount in the following case.<br />
And under the processes of the Accord we will be conveying<br />
that position to the ACTU.<br />
In these circumstances we believe that the Conciliation and<br />
Arbitration Commission should make a positive finding on the<br />
productivity/ superannuation case.<br />
It should, however, under its control, prolong the<br />
implementation of the decision over a period of some two<br />
years. Other non-wage remuneration executive salaries, directors'<br />
fees and professional incomes must be correspondingly<br />
restrained. I have been given such assurances by the<br />
relevant national business and professional organisations.<br />
[ 6~ We will be monitoring such compliance and will expect the<br />
States to do the same.<br />
The community will rightly expect the business sector to<br />
keep price increases to a minimum. We will meet any<br />
requests from the Prices Surveillance Authority that improve<br />
the effectiveness of its operation. </p>

While we have reduced our inherited inflation rate we must<br />
get closer to those of our major trading partners.<br />
The Governments of Australia must themselves exercise more<br />
restraint. It's your money that we use for your collective<br />
purposes and welfare and we will all have to set our 0<br />
sights a little lower.<br />
This will mean some tough decisions in the Budget. We have,<br />
in the Budget process so far, identified savings of more<br />
than $ 1 billion.<br />
It will mean some tough decisions at the Premiers'<br />
Conference later this week.<br />
These decisions will be taken.<br />
The tax cuts we have promised will be delivered as close as<br />
possible to September and certainly by Ist December 1986.<br />
In this context, I wish to report on two other decisions we<br />
have now taken.<br />
First, while society has a responsibility to the unemployed,<br />
this is a two-way process. The time has come, we believe,<br />
when this two-way responsibility will best be served by<br />
providing as far as possible the opportunity, particularly<br />
for the younger recipients of unemployment benefit, to<br />
undertake some community work in return for that benefit. I<br />
know from my experience with Priority One that this is the<br />
overwhelming view of our young people themselves. U </p>
<p>Accordingly, we will be seeking, in co-operation with the<br />
States, local governments, community organisations and trade<br />
unions, to create the framework for progressively achieving<br />
this objective.<br />
Second, under successive Governments, including my own, the<br />
0<br />
federal public service has continued, inexorably, to grow in<br />
numbers. While a good public service is essential to the well-being<br />
of our society, an increasingly efficient public service<br />
does not mean an increasingly large public service.<br />
Among the steps we will take will be a streamlining and<br />
rationalisation of some existing functions and agencies.<br />
Because of entrenched practices that have grown up over<br />
generations these steps cannot produce overall dramatic,<br />
immediate results. But they begin to reverse the trend<br />
and to produce a leaner, more efficient public service.<br />
The measures I mention, and indeed the indications of the<br />
broader approach in the detailed Government statement<br />
released tonight, are to be seen as part of our recognition<br />
that the problems with which we are dealing are more than<br />
immediate they are long term and need long term solutions.<br />
We must strive to broaden and deepen our export and<br />
import-competing base. I II I II </p>
<p>To this end, there are things the Government, industry and<br />
you can do. In the statement there are details of<br />
particular new decisions by government calculated to assist<br />
industry towards this objective. Australian management,<br />
with the co-operation of the workforce, must by increased<br />
investment and other initiatives pick up this challenge.<br />
And we, the Australian public, must. support Australian<br />
industry. We will be launching a campaign urging all<br />
Australians to buy Australian products whenever they can.<br />
As Australians we take enormous and obvious delight in the<br />
achievements of international excellence by our fellow<br />
countrymen and women. Just think of Robert de Castella,<br />
Joan Sutherland, Ben Lexcen and John Bertrand.<br />
I want us to get the same sense of shared pride when an<br />
Australian manufacturing or services firm wins a contract<br />
against the best international competition and let me<br />
assure you they can do it, they are doing it.<br />
It requires the same elements as have brought Deek, Joan,<br />
Ben and John to the top<br />
confidence in yourselves, your product and those around<br />
you, readiness to work with great application and dedication,<br />
eagerness to use the best available advice and<br />
technology, ~ yS~ uru--~ ~ IEZ-' 3~ T~ W </p>
<p>preparedness to forego present satisfaction for greater<br />
long term reward,<br />
total commitment.<br />
We have hundreds of potential de Castellas, Sutherlands, 0<br />
Lexcens and Bertrands out there in our manufacturing and<br />
service industries applying the' same principles we can get<br />
the same results.<br />
Finally, X want to tell you why we can, why we will together<br />
meet and overcome this challenge.<br />
In 1983, when I first spoke to you as Prime Minister about<br />
the economy, we were in the midst of our most serious<br />
economic crisis for 50 years.<br />
Three years later the picture has changed dramatically.<br />
We've had high economic growth, record employment growth<br />
almost 700,000 jobs, profits are up, industrial disputes are<br />
down. The challenge now confronting us is no less daunting than<br />
the one we faced successfully together in 1983.<br />
II </p>
<p>We have the same elements for success great resources, a<br />
Government prepared to make the hard decisions and a great<br />
people with guts and a preparedness by all sectors to pull<br />
together to make present sacrifices for future, substantial<br />
and sustainable rewards.<br />
I give you ny pledge my Government, your Government will<br />
again make the decisions necessary t6 meet this challenge.<br />
I will not shirk the hard decisions that are necessary to<br />
ensure a bright future for us and for our children.<br />
I would rather risk electoral defeat than take the soft<br />
options now that would mean we mortgage that great future.<br />
My faith in you to take up this challenge is undiminished<br />
it is unqualified.<br />
Together Australia Australians together will meet and<br />
overcome the challenge before us. </p>
