COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
Rt. Hon. SIR ROBERT MENZIES,<br />
ON<br />
TERTIARY EDUCATION IN AUSTRALIA<br />
MINISTERIAL STATEMENT<br />
I Froin the Par liamentary Debates," 24th March, 19651<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES ( Kooyong-<br />
Prime Minister).-l present the following<br />
report-Tertiary Education in Australi-Report of the<br />
Committee on the Future of Tertiary Education<br />
in Australia to the Australian Universities<br />
Commission ( Volumes t and 11).<br />
I ask for leave to make a statement in connection<br />
with the report.<br />
Mr. SPEAKER.-There heing no objecl<br />
ion, leave is granted.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-What I have<br />
now to say is being said this afternoon in<br />
another place by the Minister in Charge of<br />
Commonwealth Activities in Education and<br />
Research ( Senator Gorton) who has thc<br />
direct administration of these matters in my<br />
Department. Honorable members will know that in<br />
August 1961, the Government appointed a<br />
distinguished Committee under the chairmanship<br />
of Sir Leslie Martin to consider<br />
the pattern of tertiary education in relation<br />
to the needs and resources of Australia antI<br />
to make recommendations to the Australiani<br />
Universities Commission on the future<br />
development of tertiary education. MayI<br />
express the Government's gratitude to the<br />
members of the Committee for their work,<br />
3482/ 65. which has resulted in a report that will play<br />
an important part in thc development of<br />
tertiary education and hence in the development<br />
of our coun-try during coming decades.<br />
When we appointed this Committee, we<br />
knew we -had given it a very large task but<br />
I doubt that we realised just how large the<br />
task was. The Committee had the enthusiastic<br />
co-operation of Governments, institutions<br />
and sectors of the public with an<br />
interest in tertiary education. It was not until<br />
September 1964 however, that it was<br />
able to present its report to the Governmient-<br />
or, to be strictly accurate to present<br />
Volumes I and If with a promise of a third<br />
Volume later.<br />
Volume I sets out the Committee's central<br />
argument and its proposals for the future<br />
pattern of Australian tertiary education.<br />
Volume 14 begins a survey of academic<br />
disciplines, particularly those with an important<br />
professional content. Volume 111,<br />
which is not yet available, will conclude this<br />
survey and deal with certain other aspects<br />
of tertiary education but, we are assured,<br />
will not affect the recommendations contained<br />
in the first two volumes. Immediately<br />
apparent to members will be the wide range<br />
of subjects covered by the report and the<br />
importance of its recommendations not only </p>
<p>to thc Commonwealth Government but also<br />
to State Governments, universities and the<br />
public generally. Many of the Committee's<br />
recommendations require action by the<br />
Commonwealth if they are to be implemented<br />
and in releasing the report as we<br />
now have it, I will announce the Government's<br />
attitude towards the principal<br />
recommendations. In doing so I wish to emphasize two<br />
important points. The first is -that the aspects<br />
of education discussed in the report are ones<br />
for which the States have normal constitutional<br />
responsibility. Therefore, while it is<br />
necessary for ' the Commonwealth to determine<br />
its attitude and to announce what it,<br />
for its part, stands ready to do, it will also<br />
be necessary for each State Government,<br />
in the knowledge of what the Commonwealth<br />
is prepared to do, to decide<br />
what it is prepared to do-and for<br />
consultation and discussion between the<br />
Commonwealth and each State to take<br />
place. The second point is that the<br />
Commonwealth is not to be regarded<br />
as having adopted any position in regard<br />
to any specific issue dealt with<br />
in the report except those on which I<br />
shall now state our views.<br />
Amongst other things, the report makes<br />
recommendations as to additional aid to<br />
existing, and embryo, universities, as to<br />
assistance to students by way of scholarships,<br />
and as -to a possible method of reorganising<br />
the control and content of teacher<br />
training. But the most important section of<br />
the report deals with -what is rvirtually a<br />
concept new to Australia-the development<br />
of a broad comprehensive system of tertiary<br />
education, with an emphasis different<br />
from but complementary to, tertiary education<br />
at present provided by the universities.<br />
Because they are relatively simple, I propose<br />
to discuss first the less novel proposals<br />
of the Committee covering assistance to<br />
students and immediate assistance to universities,<br />
and to announce our decisions in<br />
these fields before moving on to consider<br />
the new proposals of major importance<br />
stemming from the work of the Committee.<br />
In the field of assistance to students the<br />
Committee has recommended that the number<br />
of Commonwealth university open<br />
entrance scholarships should be kept under<br />
periodic review, but also states that such<br />
scholarships ought not to be awarded at<br />
a standard lower than that obtaining at the end of 1963. The Government accepts, as<br />
it has in the past accepted, the necessity<br />
for periodic increases in these scholarships.<br />
The number available was last raised by<br />
1,000--from 4,000 to 5,000-at the end<br />
of 1963, and we have decided that the<br />
number will be raised by a further 1,000<br />
-from 5,000 to 6,000-at the end of the<br />
present year. Such periodic reviews will<br />
continue in the future.<br />
The Committee further recommends that<br />
all students at universities who successfully<br />
complete the first year of -their university<br />
course at the first attempt, and who arce<br />
otherwise eligible, should be' automatically<br />
awarded Commonwealth later year scholarships.<br />
At present the number of these awards<br />
available covers rather more than two-thirds<br />
of the full-time students who meet these<br />
conditions. The Government does not feel<br />
it should accept this suggested unknown<br />
charge on future Budgets but it has decided<br />
to increase the number of later year awards<br />
* by 250 at the end of the present year.<br />
Mr. Bryant.-That is a fizzer.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-To me it is<br />
a novel idea that getting through your first<br />
year at the first attempt should qualify you<br />
for a scholarship. This is quite new to me.<br />
Dr. J. F. Cairns.-The Prime Minister<br />
is still in the nineteenth century.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-I was borne<br />
in the nineteenth century. I used to know<br />
a good deal about scholarships having won<br />
quite a few in those rather harder schools<br />
of competition._<br />
Dr. J. F. Cairns.-We are not all asW<br />
brilliant as you are, you know.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-Well, you<br />
must speak for yourself.<br />
These later year awards, which at the<br />
inception of the Commonwealth university<br />
scholarship scheme were less than a ' hundred,<br />
have grown steadily since. The number<br />
available each year was last raised, from<br />
780 to 1,280, at the end of 1963, and at<br />
the end of this year the number available<br />
each year will be raised from 1,280 to<br />
1,530. Here, too, periodic reviews will<br />
continue. In the field of the new look tertiary<br />
colleges to which I have referred, the Committee<br />
has recommended that there should<br />
be 2,500 new scholarships awarded to<br />
students who have passed matriculation or </p>
<p>an equivalent examination and that these<br />
should carry the same financial benefits<br />
as do Commonwealth university scholarships,<br />
plus a means test free allowance of<br />
Å“ 100 to each scholarship holder. We do not<br />
feel able to agree with the recommendation<br />
as stated but we have decided to make<br />
available in this field 1,000 new scholarships,<br />
awarded on the conditions suggested.<br />
but carrying the same financial benefit as<br />
Commonwealth university scholarships. The<br />
Snet result of these decisions is that, as from<br />
the end of this year, there will be 2,250<br />
more tertiary scholarships available each<br />
year than has been the case in the past, the<br />
number available rising from 6,280 to 8,530<br />
-7,530 at universities and 1,000 at the<br />
new technical institutions.<br />
These scholarships are recommended by<br />
the Committee to be available to students<br />
for full-time study only but the Government<br />
does not accept this recommendation. We<br />
believe there may well be many valid<br />
personal reasons why a student chooses to<br />
do a part-time course, and that no student<br />
who does wish to do such a course, and<br />
who has earned a Commonwealth Scholarship,<br />
should have his preference subject to<br />
a veto. Furthermore, the new Institutes of<br />
Colleges-I will say more about those in a<br />
moment-and the industrial leaders with<br />
whom they will no doubt confer, may desire<br />
to include part-time courses as part of their<br />
curricula, and in some States considerable<br />
emphasis may be placed on part-time as<br />
distinct from full-time courses. If this happens<br />
students should not be prevented from<br />
winning a scholarship to take up such<br />
courses. Our scholarships for tertiary education<br />
will therefore in the future, as in the<br />
past, be available for either full-time or<br />
part-time study as the scholarship winner<br />
chooses. In discussing the financial benefits which<br />
such scholarships should carry the Committee<br />
confines itself to recommending that<br />
the living allowances and the means test<br />
applied to these allowances should be periodically<br />
reviewed. It recommends also that<br />
a text book allowance should be given to<br />
scholarship holders. We, of course, have<br />
always accepted the principle of periodic<br />
reviews of allowances and indeed, as a<br />
result of the last review, living allowances<br />
were increased as from January this year,<br />
and the means test applied to such allowances<br />
was liberalised. We shall continue to apply this principle. A text book allowance,<br />
however, poses very considerable administrative<br />
problems because it would be necessary<br />
to ensure that any allowance did, in<br />
fact, go to books and equipment, and because<br />
requirements would vary considerably<br />
between universities, between faculties,<br />
and between years in any given faculty.<br />
Therefore all I can say as to this proposal<br />
at the moment is that we intend to ask<br />
the Vice-Chancellors of the universities to<br />
discuss with us the problems raised by the<br />
recommendation, and by the comment I<br />
have just made.<br />
The Committee suggested that the universities<br />
study and report upon the feasibility<br />
of their having funds available for making<br />
loans to students in special cases of hardship.<br />
While recognising the desirability of<br />
loan schemes, we regard these as matters<br />
for the universities' internal administration.<br />
The Commonwealth therefore will not make<br />
special financial provision for student loan<br />
funds. Moving to specific and immediate<br />
financial proposals regarding universities,<br />
the Committee has recommended that some<br />
additional capital funds should be made<br />
available to some universities, which it<br />
designates, during this 1964-66 triennium.<br />
These grants are designed to ensure that the<br />
new Universities of Macquarie in New<br />
South Wales and La Trobe in Victoria<br />
will be ready to begin operation at the beginning<br />
of 1967 as planned; that Redford<br />
Park in Adelaide will be able to open in<br />
1966 as planned; that site works will take<br />
place at the University of Newcastle and<br />
the Townsville University College; and that<br />
a start will be made in taking the preliminary<br />
steps for the establishment of a second<br />
university in Brisbane by 1970. In the cases<br />
of Macquarie and La Trobe, the grants are<br />
additional to the establishment grants of<br />
Å“ 1.1m. each for Macquarie and La Trobe.<br />
The Commonwealth share of these grants<br />
was appropriated by the Parliament for<br />
these universities in October 1963. That is<br />
the Å“ 1.1 million in the case of each. All of<br />
these are grants for definite projects which<br />
have been examined in detail, and recommended<br />
on, by the Universities Commission<br />
and are in a field which is familiar.<br />
The sums recommended for each university<br />
are given in a list which, with the concurrence<br />
of honorable members, I now<br />
incorporate in " Hansard </p>
<p>Interim Capital Grants to Universities for<br />
1965 and 1966.<br />
Macquarie University 1,000,000<br />
La Trobe University 750,000<br />
University of Adelaide at Bedford<br />
Park 400,000<br />
Townsville University College 100,000<br />
Newcastle University 100,000<br />
Second university institution in<br />
Brisbane 100,000<br />
They total Å“ 2,450,000, of which the Commonwealth<br />
share on a Å“ 1 for LIÅ“ 1b asis, is<br />
Å“ 1,225,000. We stand ready to provide our<br />
share of this finance at once and will introduce<br />
legislation during the current session<br />
asking Parliament ' to appropriate it.<br />
I turn now to consider the new concept<br />
which is the heart of this report. It is that<br />
Australia, during the next decade, should<br />
develop advanced education in virtually new<br />
types of colleges. These colleges would provide<br />
for those students who, though qualified,<br />
do not wish to undertake a full university<br />
course, or whose chosen course is not<br />
considered appropriate for a university, or<br />
whose level at passing matriculation indicated<br />
a small chance of graduation<br />
from a university in minimum time or<br />
minimum time plus one ' year. The recommendation<br />
for the development of these<br />
colleges and the recommendation that<br />
new universities should not be established<br />
-honorable members will see this in the<br />
report-taken together with other observations<br />
of the Committee, indicate a belief<br />
on its part that universities should grant<br />
entrance only to those matriculants whose<br />
standard of pass was good enough to indicate<br />
a reasonable likelihood of graduation<br />
in minimum time or minimum time plus one<br />
year. The Committee suggests that the new<br />
colleges, to give advanced education, should<br />
be developed from, and around, the existing<br />
tertiary segments of existing technical colleges.<br />
But it is clear that what is envisaged<br />
is not merely a bigger and better college<br />
for teaching technical subjects, for ' the suggestion<br />
is that technology should be only<br />
one of the education fields in which these<br />
colleges should provide advanced instruction.<br />
In them -there should be, says the Committee,<br />
appropriate courses in the liberal<br />
arts for young men and women. ' taking up<br />
administrative positions in commerce, industry,<br />
and government". There should be a<br />
common core of studies at tertiary level<br />
aimed at providing for all students attending the college breadth in education", and<br />
the development of critical imagination<br />
and creative abilities". Students engaged<br />
in such common studies would major in<br />
technological courses or in other courses<br />
provided by the colleges to fit them for<br />
particular careers after they ' had gained<br />
their diploma.<br />
These colleges should, recommends the<br />
report, be provided with funds for capital<br />
and recurrent purposes sufficient to permit<br />
expansion and improvement in buildings,<br />
in equipment, in the -teaching staff required, W<br />
and in general educational facilities. The<br />
funds are recommended to be provided, half<br />
by the Commonwealth and -half by the<br />
States as to capital, and in the ratioit<br />
is the existing one-of Å“ 1 Commonwealth<br />
to Å“ 1.85 State as to recurrent*<br />
expenses. We, for our part, accept the broad concept<br />
and stand ready to provide, during the<br />
1967-69 triennium, the Å“ 1 for flÅ“ 1 grant for<br />
capital and , the Å“ 1 to Å“ 1.85 grant for<br />
recurrent annual expenses up to the limits<br />
envisaged in the Committee's report. These<br />
appear to be approximately Å“ 4 million a<br />
year for capital from the Commonwealth<br />
and Å“ 4 million a year for recurrent expenses<br />
from the Commonwealth during that triennium.<br />
These grants, if matched, would mean<br />
a total of approximately Å“ 24 million forlW<br />
capital and Å“ 34 million for recurrent<br />
expenses for the colleges during that<br />
triennium. Commonwealth financial support for<br />
these colleges will be confined to capital and W<br />
recurrent expenses for the development of<br />
tertiary education only, and we define<br />
tertiary education as consisting of courses<br />
before entry upon which a student must pass<br />
matriculation or an equivalent examination.<br />
It will be confined to new developmentthat<br />
is, as regards recurrent expenses, to<br />
expenses incurred over and above what is,<br />
in the 1964-65 financial year, being incurred<br />
in this field by a State. And it will be confined<br />
to assistance for strengthening, and<br />
expanding, and introducing, diploma<br />
courses. We have noted the Committee's<br />
suggestion that at some time in -the future<br />
the new Institutes of Colleges that it<br />
envisages may build on present proposals in<br />
order to provide post-diploma courses leading<br />
-to degrees. But the support now pledged<br />
by the Commonwealth will not go beyond </p>
<p>supporting the basic concept of the Committee<br />
as to new type colleges with a variety<br />
of advanced courses leading on completion<br />
to a diploma. We wish to emphasise this<br />
point, Mr. Speaker, for we entirely agree<br />
with the Committee's statements that these<br />
new type institutions should " resist the<br />
temptation to copy , the educational processes<br />
and curricula of universities and that<br />
the responsibilities of these colleges to the<br />
community are " of a different kind from<br />
hose of universities. Our support is founded<br />
n acceptance of this principle, and we do<br />
not make our support available for the<br />
development out of these colleges of new<br />
universities. We do not look so far ahead<br />
as that. We see these colleges as designed<br />
rimarily for teaching at the tertiary level<br />
nd as catering for the diploma not the postdliploma<br />
student.<br />
I now turn -to the machinery which the<br />
Committee suggests might be set uip in<br />
order to provide the means whereby Commonwealth<br />
and State support might be<br />
channelled to these new institutions. The<br />
Committee's suggestion is that each State<br />
should set up an autonomous Institute of<br />
Colleges which would admit a college to<br />
membership when, in its opinion, that particular<br />
college had achieved an appropriate<br />
standard. This Institute would be charged<br />
ith the responsibility of supervising the<br />
expansion and development of technical<br />
and other tertiary education in the member<br />
colleges and with co-ordinating their work<br />
to prevent waste and overlapping. It would<br />
this Institute which would suggest allocaon<br />
of available funds between colleges in<br />
its own State. Subject to this supervision<br />
the member colleges themselves would each<br />
by governed by its own independent governing<br />
body. We are attracted to this proposition<br />
and are prepared, for our part, to<br />
endorse and accept it. But we think that<br />
acceptance and implementation of the proposal<br />
are matters for which the State<br />
Governments are responsible. We do not,<br />
therefore, make establishment of the Institutes<br />
a condition of assistance, though we<br />
do endorse the idea, and we will therefore<br />
he prepared to deal either with such<br />
Institutes or with a State Government direct<br />
should a State decide not to set up an<br />
autonomous Institute.<br />
The Committee on the Future of Tertiary<br />
Education further suggests that the Institutes<br />
should make submissions, in the way in which universities now make submissions,<br />
to an expanded Australian Universities Commission<br />
which would deal not only with<br />
universities but with the new Institutes as<br />
well. We do not endorse this suggestion. We<br />
feel that it would be better that we should<br />
leave to the Universities Commission its<br />
present responsibilities of advising the Government<br />
on proposals from universities and<br />
that we should -arrange other methods of<br />
distributing grants to the new colleges. We<br />
therefore propose to have a separate<br />
advisory committee to which proposals from<br />
Institutes of Colleges-or from ' the State<br />
Education Department in any State which<br />
does not set up an Institute-will be referred,<br />
and which will make recommendations<br />
to the Commonwealth as to the distribution<br />
of Commonwealth funds after it has<br />
considered those proposals. As is the case<br />
with funds for universities, the funds available<br />
would be distributed throughout Australia<br />
on the basis of assessed need in any<br />
particular area.<br />
I have no doubt that within the boundaries<br />
set out there will be great variations of<br />
methods of development among the States<br />
and indeed, if the Institutes and colleges are<br />
given autonomy, among the various colleges<br />
in a State. It may be that we will see<br />
develop colleges which, in this discipline or<br />
that, provide courses which are analogous<br />
to similar courses in the earlier years at a<br />
university, and which are either an end in<br />
themselves in that they lead to a diploma<br />
recognised as a really significant qualification,<br />
or which may lead-depending on the<br />
standard achieved by the student-to postdiploma<br />
transfer to a university, with credit<br />
for work done, and progress to a degree.<br />
It may be that we will see in tho technical<br />
disciplines a diploma course which is still,<br />
as it is now, a course leading in itself to a<br />
significant qualification but which can lead<br />
to post-diploma study not in an existing<br />
university but in a foundation in each State<br />
which takes the best diploma graduates<br />
and conducts them to a Bachelor of Technology,<br />
or Master of Technology, degree<br />
in the single location where there can be<br />
concentrated the best teachers and the best<br />
facilities for practical research in conjunc-<br />
' tion with industry. Such developments,<br />
which can be determined only by discussion<br />
and agreement between the Commonwealth<br />
and each State Institute, are matters for<br />
hammering out in the workshop of ideas </p>
<p>which will be contributed by academic<br />
circles, industrial circles, public bodies, and<br />
the community and their representatives.<br />
But I1 repeat that the Government does<br />
endorse the general broad concept and for<br />
its part will provide Å“ 1 for Å“ 1 for capital<br />
and El for B1.85 for recurrent expenses<br />
to develop that concept within the bounds<br />
wvhich I have specified.<br />
Before leaving the subject, I must refer<br />
to an immediate specific recommendation<br />
which the Committee makes concerning<br />
Institutes of Colleges. It recommends<br />
grants, of which the Commonwealth's share<br />
is Å“ 2.5 million to be available in 1965 and<br />
1966 in specified amounts to specified colleges.<br />
Honorable members will find their<br />
list of these Colleges, and the amounts recommended<br />
for each, in the appendix<br />
attached to this statement.<br />
With the concurrence of the House. I<br />
shall incorporate the list in " Hansard<br />
Interim Capital Grants to Colleges for 1965<br />
and 1966.<br />
Sydney Technical College..<br />
-Royal Melbourne Institute of<br />
Technology<br />
South Australian Institute of<br />

Technology<br />

' 100,000<br />
The actual purposes of these grants have<br />
not been examined in detail and are not<br />
known to us, or to the States, in the way<br />
in which the actual purposes of the interim<br />
grants to universities are known, and they<br />
will require further discussion. We cannot<br />
therefore specifically endorse them as we<br />
do in the case of the interim grants to universities.<br />
But we, for our part, now stand<br />
ready to receive from the relevant States, or<br />
from autonomous Institutes of Colleges<br />
where States set them up, propositions for<br />
the expenditure at the named colleges of<br />
the amounts recommended for each college,<br />
and to carry on discussions with them on<br />
the approval of and the application of<br />
such amounts in those colleges. We do not, however, stand prepared to make interim<br />
grants to the proposed boards of teacher<br />
education or to the " other institutions"<br />
recommended -by the Committee.<br />
We do not, ourselves, intend to establish<br />
a Commonwealth institute of colleges, for<br />
the three colleges operated by the Services<br />
have a specialised role, as has the Australian<br />
School of Pacific Administration. Nor do<br />
we propose to establish an Australian college<br />
of external studies to be responsibl%.<br />
for all external studies throughout Australi<br />
since we believe that the existing universitie~<br />
can best provide courses for external students<br />
who need to study at university level<br />
and that other existing institutions can cater<br />
for those who wish to study at other level<br />
The next important recommendation oW<br />
the Committee is that the Commonwealth<br />
should enter the existing field of teacher<br />
training, both by way of an interim capital<br />
grant of Å“ 1.25 million and by way of LI<br />
for iL grants for capital and LEI for Å“ 1.85<br />
grants for recurrent expenses in the 1967-69<br />
triennium and after. Important as this field<br />
is, the Commonwealth is not prepared to<br />
enter it. It is one which has been the exclusive<br />
responsibility of the States and is, in<br />
each State, closely bound up with the State<br />
Education Department's judgment as to th<br />
training it wishes teachers in its schools to<br />
have, and as to the manner in which it decides<br />
to run its primary and secondary<br />
schools. Moreover, on the evidence of the<br />
State Education Ministers themselves, the<br />
amount of capital required in this specialise<br />
field, in order to bring standards up to whaW<br />
they would regard as satisfactory, is not<br />
large-amounting to a total requirement<br />
covering the needs of all six States of Å“ 1.25<br />
million annually over a period of four years.<br />
And the recurrent expenses of the teachers'<br />
colleges-excluding salaries paid to trainees<br />
-are also, compared to the requirements of<br />
universities and colleges, not great. The<br />
impact of the Committee's recommendations<br />
as to the length of a teacher training<br />
course, and as to-the standard required of a<br />
student before he embarks upon it, would<br />
vary widely between States and the removal<br />
of teachers' colleges from the control of<br />
State Education Departments is clearly one<br />
which is primarily for the States to determine.<br />
Therefore, while we do not in the<br />
least denigrate the importance of the Committee's<br />
recommendation in this field, we </p>
<p>believe that it is one where action can be,<br />
and should be, left to the State Governments<br />
which have before them the Committee's<br />
recommendations for adoption and<br />
action should they so decide. It follows, also,<br />
that we have not accepted the Committee's<br />
proposals for a separate scheme of scholarships<br />
for teachers' college students.<br />
I now turn to some general recommendations<br />
as to universities, on which, at this<br />
stage, I wish to make our views plain.<br />
First, the Committee makes the firm recomendation<br />
that no new universities, other<br />
an those for which provision is made in<br />
this report, should be established during<br />
the period up to 1975. While we agree that<br />
during this period most of our effort as to<br />
ew establishments should be concentrated<br />
n the proposed new type tertiary institutions,<br />
we feel that a firm decision against<br />
establishing any new university, looking so<br />
far ahead, should not be taken. The growth<br />
and distribution of population throughout<br />
Australia might, in the period under discussion,<br />
be such that a new university would<br />
be justified in this area or that. Consequently,<br />
while we endorse the general<br />
approach inherent in the Committee's<br />
recommendations, we are not prepared to<br />
say firmly that during the period no new<br />
university should be established. Secondly,<br />
he Committee recommends the reduction<br />
ind gradual elimination of part-time and<br />
external studies ii universities. As I have<br />
indicated, the Government does not agree<br />
with this recommendation and does not wish<br />
the Universities Commission to adopt such<br />
n approach in its discussions with, or its<br />
recommendations concerning, universities.<br />
We believe, as I have said, that there are<br />
many reasons for not discouraging the parttime<br />
undergraduate and we feel that parttime<br />
courses and external studies have a<br />
valuable part to play in providing refresher<br />
courses for graduates and in providing instruction<br />
at university level to graduates or<br />
non-graduates whether such people are<br />
seeking to obtain a degree from such parttime<br />
study or merely to master some one<br />
subject which they feel will be of assistance<br />
or benefit to them.<br />
How much effort a university puts into<br />
part-time studies, or external studies, will<br />
be for the governing body of that university<br />
to decide but, for our part, we do not<br />
believe that any university which wishes to to do so should be discouraged, and we are<br />
ready to continue to provide financial assistance<br />
for these purposes. Thirdly, the Coinmmittee<br />
suggests that universities should have<br />
enrolments which are not smaller than<br />
4,000 or greater than 10,000. We agree<br />
that a university should have, or should<br />
have the reasonable prospect of achieving,<br />
an enrolment of at least 4,000; but we do<br />
not endorse the proposition that enrolments<br />
should not be more than 10,000. There is<br />
a substantial body of opinion which holds<br />
that much larger universities than one with<br />
an enrolment of 10,000 are occasionally<br />
necessary and desirable. We feel that the<br />
size of the university must be related,<br />
amongst other things, to the area it occupies<br />
and to the opinions of its governing body<br />
and we are not therefore prepared to<br />
endorse any arbitrary upper limit as to the<br />
size beyond which a university should not<br />
grow. The Committee -has recommended that<br />
the triennial grants to universities and also<br />
to technical colleges should be subject to<br />
review so that supplementary grants may<br />
be made when changes in salaries and wages<br />
justify them. We interpret this recommendation<br />
as being limited to reimbursing a university<br />
or college for increases in salaries<br />
paid directly by it to its employees. Such<br />
supplements have been the practice in<br />
regard to variations in academic salaries<br />
and the Government is prepared to consider<br />
recommendations for supplementary recurrent<br />
grants to offset increased costs arising<br />
from variations in awards affecting wages<br />
and non-academic salaries. However, we<br />
will need to be satisfied in each case that<br />
, the increases cannot be provided from the<br />
normal recurrent grants. In other words,<br />
we do not want to break down the triennial<br />
system which has been so significant. We<br />
will make this our policy both for universities<br />
and for technical colleges in the<br />
1967-69 triennium. These are all matters<br />
on which we wish our attitude to be clear<br />
both to universities and to the Commission<br />
for we would not wish future recommendations<br />
as to universities to be influenced<br />
by a mistaken idea of our attitude.<br />
I<br />
The final matter I refer to in this very<br />
long review-I apologise for its lengthis<br />
that of allocations of funds to universities<br />
for purposes of research, and to scientific<br />
research generally. Honorable members will </p>
<p>recall that the Second Report of the Universities<br />
Commission recomnmended that<br />
during the calendar years 1964, 1965 and<br />
1966, a total of Å“ 5 million should be provided<br />
for universities to support research<br />
activities at post-graduate level. Of the<br />
million, half was to be provided by the<br />
Commonwealth and half by the States. The<br />
Commission had not, at the time of the<br />
report, reached a stage where it felt it could<br />
make recommendations for the distribution<br />
of these funds among universities and therefore<br />
confined its recommendation, in the<br />
first instance, to the distribution of Å“ 1 million<br />
in the year 1964. When introducing the<br />
Universities ( Financial Assistance) Bill in<br />
October 1963, 1 accepted the recommendation<br />
for this initial distribution and said<br />
that 1 hoped the Government would shortly<br />
take an opportunity to look at the whole<br />
question of Commonwealth involvement in<br />
research in Australia. This we have now<br />
done. The universities were told, last year,<br />
that a further Å“ 1 million, or our share of it,<br />
would be available in universities during<br />
1965 for the same purposes as in 1964, and<br />
I now announce that our share of another<br />
Å“ 1 million will be available in 1966, on the<br />
same basis as to distribution. After that date,<br />
we feel, the Commission should include<br />
provision for this form of research grant,<br />
bound up as it is with post-graduate<br />
teaching, in the general recommendations<br />
which it makes for capital and recurrent<br />
grants to universities.<br />
Of the Å“ 5 million recommended for<br />
research activities in the 1964-66 triennium,<br />
this would still leave undistributed Å“ 1 million<br />
of Commonwealth funds and a matching<br />
amount from the States. We believe that this<br />
sum should be available for particular<br />
selected research projects to be carried out<br />
by individuals or research teams. We therefore<br />
propose to make Å“ 1 million available<br />
for such particular research projects and to<br />
set up an advisory committee to which we<br />
shall refer requests for assistance from such<br />
individuals or research teams. We will look<br />
to this committee for advice as to allocations,<br />
within the limits of the money available,<br />
for such proposals. The committee<br />
will receive proposals, in the main, from<br />
research workers in universities, although<br />
applications from persons working outside universities will not be debarred unless<br />
such persons are working for Government<br />
authorities. Commonwealth money from<br />
this fund will be available on the advice of<br />
the committee, subject, in each case involving<br />
a university, to a matching grant from<br />
the State in which the research is to be<br />
carried out. As 1 ' have said, these research<br />
grants are not intended for use exclusively<br />
in scientific disciplines, nor need the total<br />
amount be spent in the 1964-66 triennium.<br />
While on this subject I take the opportunity<br />
to announce that we have decide<br />
that there ought to be a body to advise thW<br />
Government on the most effective methods<br />
of co-ordinating, and achieving results<br />
from, expenditure on research through the<br />
universities, through the Government's own<br />
agencies, and through any other bodies t<br />
which grants are made by the GovernmenW<br />
What we seek is a situation in which, the<br />
Government having decided what proportion<br />
of national income can go to scientific<br />
research, and having indicated its views of<br />
the general fields in which advances would,<br />
economically, most benefit the nation, some<br />
competent advisory body would recommend<br />
the allocation of available money<br />
among the various governmental research<br />
bodies, the universities, and others. We will<br />
therefore study the various methods which<br />
have been developed for this purpose i<br />
overseas countries.<br />
The end desired to be achieved is clear,<br />
but it is also clear that the means to that<br />
end adopted by other countries vary considerably.<br />
But the best machinery tor Australian<br />
conditions is not easily to be dccided<br />
and the study I have announced will there<br />
fore take place to try to arrive at the best<br />
answer for us. In conclusion I state that<br />
we are ready now to receive proposals from<br />
the States in those fields where agreement<br />
is necessary for action and, they now knowing<br />
both the extent and the limits of our<br />
assistance, to carry on the discussions<br />
necessary for agreement to be reached, and<br />
action to be taken.<br />
I present the following paper-<br />
Tertiary Education in Australia-Report of Cornmmittee-<br />
Ministerial Statement, dated 24th<br />
March 1965-<br />
and move-<br />
That the House take note of the papers.<br />
