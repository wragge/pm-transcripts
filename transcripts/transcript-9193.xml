TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, FAIRBAIRN RAAF BASE<br />
14 APRIL 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Mr Keating, were you happy with the overall outcome of the trip?<br />
PM: I think in trade and foreign policy terms it couldn't have been better.<br />
Starting with the handing over of the Friendship Bridge between<br />
Thailand and Laos, I think it was the cause of the introduction of a new<br />
relationship for these two countries which, of course, have got a long<br />
history together. In many respects close features to their history, plus<br />
separated now for to long and I think that has been changing, and as a<br />
consequence of the Bridge I hope a lot of things will happen there,<br />
And the visit to Thailand was, I think, important to talk to the Thai<br />
Government, to get to understand a bit about their view of the region<br />
and their economy, doing more with Australia. This is the second<br />
largest economy in ASEAN, there is much more we can do there. And<br />
the visit to Vietnam really couldn't have been better. The discussions I<br />
had with the Government had all the weight and quality that one could<br />
ever have hoped for.<br />
J: Were you a little disappointed though, with the domestic storm<br />
PM: Well, no, those things they pass through, what matters is the weight<br />
that sits under them and the relationship with the Government of<br />
Vietnam, with the President, the Prime Minister and the General<br />
Secretary, the meetings I had there couldn't have been better. This is<br />
a country which has done it hard for a very long time and is now trying<br />
to come up, to lift their people out of poverty and to take a part in the<br />
region and Australia is there helping. </p>
<p>TEL: 14. Apr. 94 11: 22 No. 006 P. 02/ 02<br />
2<br />
We have got nearly a billion dollars worth of investment there, we just<br />
doubled our aid budget to them, and I think they appreciate the<br />
interest which Australia has in them. So, in terms of three countries in<br />
the region where we have had a long association, particularly in<br />
Thailand and now with Laos and Vietnam, I was very happy with the<br />
meetings, the visits, the quality of the discussions, the genuine<br />
friendship and the understanding.<br />
Thank you. </p>
