    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Hon Kathy Sullivan MP has advised me of her decision to resign as</p>
<p> Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>I have accepted her resignation with effect from 12 noon on Monday 14</p>
<p> February 2000.</p>
<p>I want to thank her for her outstanding work as Alexander Downer's</p>
<p> Parliamentary Secretary.</p>
<p>In particular, I would like to pay tribute to the job she has done with</p>
<p> AusAID where her deep commitment and hard work has been especially noticeable.</p>
<p>Last June, she publicly indicated her intention to retire from parliament</p>
<p> at the end of this term.</p>
<p>Having completed a number of key tasks, she is now standing aside to</p>
<p> permit another parliamentary colleague to have the opportunity to contribute</p>
<p> to the work of the government.</p>
<p>I look forward to her continuing contribution to the Parliament and her</p>
<p> electorate until her retirement at the next election.</p>
<p>I will be making an announcement about her successor shortly.</p>
