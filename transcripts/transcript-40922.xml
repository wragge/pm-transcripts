    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Turnbull Government today confirmed that it will build Western Sydney Airport.</p>
<p>Details of the Turnbull Government’s plan to build Western Sydney Airport will be announced by the Treasurer in the Budget next week.</p>
<p>This follows today’s announcement by Sydney Airport Group, the owner of Kingsford Smith Airport, that it will not take up the opportunity under its ‘right of first refusal’ to build and operate the new Western Sydney Airport at Badgerys Creek.</p>
<p>It is a vitally important project for Western Sydney, for Sydney, and the nation, which is why the Coalition Government ended decades of indecision by committing to the project in 2014.</p>
<p>The Government has worked carefully to meet our obligations and we have been planning for either contingency – acceptance or rejection by Sydney Airport Group. We are well positioned to move forward on terms that are consistent with the terms of the Notice of Intention.</p>
<p>The airport will be a major catalyst for jobs and economic growth in Western Sydney, injecting more than $1.9 billion into the economy during the construction phase alone.  It is expected to deliver 9,000 new jobs to Western Sydney by the early 2030s, and 60,000 in the long-term.</p>
<p>Consultation meetings with Sydney Airport Group were conducted in an atmosphere of good faith. </p>
