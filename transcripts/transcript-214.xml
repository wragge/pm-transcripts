    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>P. M. No. 30/ 1960</strong></p>
<p>I have the honour, Sir, to send you greetings from the Australian Goverment and people on the occasion of the opening of the Swiss National Fair at Lausanne.</p>
<p>Australia is proud to have been invited to participate as Guest Exhibitor at this year's Fair. We greatly value this honour, both as further testimony of  growing European interest in our country and as assting in achieving closer relations with the peoples of the European Continent and with the Goverrm-ent and people of Switzerland.</p>
<p>Australia has always had close ties with Europe. Modern comunications present us with opportunities to strengthen these ties by developing exchanges in cultural, comnercial tourist and other fields, not merely for our own benefit but in the interests of international accord.</p>
<p>In particular, I wish to pay tribute to the great contributions made to the development of Australia by our many new citizens from Europe. They have enriched our way of life and have given us a new appreciation of the traditions and culture, the industry and skills of Europe, to which the Swiss people have made such a splendid contribution.</p>
<p>The people of your country enjoy a high reputation in Australia for their industry, skill and good citizenship. Further, Swiss investors have contributed notably to the economic development of Australia, particularly through their support of Australian Govern: ent loans raised in Switzerland.</p>
<p>I have asked our Treasurer, the rigft Honourable Harold Holt who will be representing the Government of Australia at the Fair and at the Australian Economic Seminar, to convey to you ny warm personal regards and my eanest wish<br />that Australia's participation in this year's Fair will reflect both our gratitude and our realisation of the high honour accorded to us</p>
<p>CANBERRA<br />llth September, 1960.</p>
