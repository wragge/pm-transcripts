    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>P. M. No. 30/ 1960</strong></p>
<p>I have the honour, Sir, to send you greetings fromÂ the Australian Goverment and people on the occasion of theÂ opening of the Swiss National Fair at Lausanne.</p>
<p>Australia is proud to have been invited toÂ participate as Guest Exhibitor at this year's Fair. WeÂ greatly value this honour, both as further testimony of Â growing European interest in our country and as assting inÂ achieving closer relations with the peoples of the EuropeanÂ Continent and with the Goverrm-ent and people of Switzerland.</p>
<p>Australia has always had close ties with Europe.Â Modern comunications present us with opportunities toÂ strengthen these ties by developing exchanges in cultural,Â comnercial tourist and other fields, not merely for our ownÂ benefit but in the interests of international accord.</p>
<p>In particular, I wish to pay tribute to the greatÂ contributions made to the development of Australia by ourÂ many new citizens from Europe. They have enriched our way ofÂ life and have given us a new appreciation of the traditionsÂ and culture, the industry and skills of Europe, to which theÂ Swiss people have made such a splendid contribution.</p>
<p>The people of your country enjoy a high reputationÂ in Australia for their industry, skill and good citizenship.Â Further, Swiss investors have contributed notably to theÂ economic development of Australia, particularly through theirÂ support of Australian Govern: ent loans raised in Switzerland.</p>
<p>I have asked our Treasurer, the rigft HonourableÂ Harold Holt who will be representing the Government ofÂ Australia at the Fair and at the Australian Economic Seminar,Â to convey to you ny warm personal regards and my eanest wish<br />that Australia's participation in this year's Fair will reflectÂ both our gratitude and our realisation of the high honourÂ accorded to us</p>
<p>CANBERRA<br />llth September, 1960.</p>
