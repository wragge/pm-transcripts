E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
INTERVIEW WITH ALAN JONES, 2UE, 4 JUNE 1985<br />
JONES: As I've said to you earlier on in the program the tax package,<br />
or the government's draft White Paper its preferred position<br />
has been made public today and I think we ought to emphasise<br />
that. There's a long way to go before the government is able to<br />
win the day on its preferred position but nonetheless it's a<br />
brand new area of reform in Australia and the government is to be<br />
commended, as I have said many times, for the initiative it's<br />
taken on the question of reform. But like everything it's not<br />
going to please everybodyand the man who perhaps stands to lose<br />
most and has got the toughest job in front of him in selling it,<br />
both to the summit and to the public at large, is the<br />
Prime Minister himself and he's on the line. Good Morning<br />
Prime Minister.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good Morning Alan.<br />
JONES: Well Prime Minister I suppose the community will be saying some<br />
good news and some bad news. Perhaps could we take the good news<br />
about the overall reduction that you have foreshadowed in<br />
personal tax and may I ask you does that mean that all four<br />
marginal rates will be reduced?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Under the preferred option yes, Alan,' if I could just give them<br />
to you: at the level of income between roughly $ 6000 and<br />
$ 12500 wherethe present rate is 250 in the dollar the marginal<br />
rate that would come down to 20g. Between$ 12500 and $ 19500<br />
it would be reduced from 300to20 and in the very important<br />
area where just so much damage has been caused now<br />
earnings comes in the range of $ 19500 to $ 28000 where people<br />
are now paying virtually half that's 46,, there'll be a<br />
massive reduction down-to 350, and the $ 28000. to $ 35000 comes<br />
down from 48 to 40 and the top rates of $ 35000 and over<br />
., would come down from 600* to 500.<br />
JONES: Right. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
If I could give you very specifically the example of the level<br />
of average weekly earnings so that you could get quite clearly<br />
the net sort of picture, there would be a 30% reduction in<br />
direct tax paid by the average weekly earnings person of an<br />
income tax cut of $ 31 a week. Against that would be the rise<br />
in costs coming about from the consumption tax. That will<br />
cost $ 16.80. a week. So net benefit, Alan, to that person<br />
on average weekly earnings of $ 14.20 a week.<br />
JONES: Right. Well now also Prime Minister you've raised the tax-free<br />
threshhold, haven't you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes Alan. It's currently $ 4595. That would go up to $ 6250<br />
tax-free threshold,' which if I can put it in weekly terms,<br />
Alan, a person now can earn up to $ 88 a week and pay no tax.<br />
Under the preferred option that'would go up to $ 120 a week which<br />
a person could earn and pay no tax.<br />
JONES:<br />
Right. Now we'll come to the consumption tax later but again<br />
on the good news front to compensate the lower income earner<br />
for the damage that might be done by a consumption tax you are<br />
also going to make a one-off increase, are you not, in pensions?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes. JONES:<br />
That will be all pensions?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes Alan. Let me just go very quickly to that and I'm very glad<br />
you brought it up early. The calculation is that the<br />
affect of the introduction of a broadly based consumption tax<br />
is that it would increase the CPI one-off by 61%. Now on the<br />
basis of the adjustment of pensions to meet an increase in the<br />
CPI that would require an increase of $ 6 a week in the pension<br />
to cover that increase in the CPI. The proposal is that the<br />
pension would increase by $ 9 a week for the single person so<br />
that's well over 50% over the price impact. Married couple<br />
pensions would go up by $ 14 a week. But that's not the end,<br />
Alan, of what we'd do because we are very conscious of the fact<br />
that introducing a broad based consumption tax would in the<br />
absence of compensatory mechanisms hurt people at lower level<br />
of income, and particular social security beneficiaries. So<br />
you're right over-compensate in pensions but in addition to<br />
that we would also increase the dependent spouse rebate and<br />
family allowances by 14% and the family income supplement,<br />
which is particularly there to help low income families, would<br />
also be expanded and the benefits increased. So in total the<br />
compensation package that we would bring in under this preferred<br />
option would be about $ 2 billion so that there would be<br />
over-compensation for the price impact. Ve believe, Alan,<br />
and I know you would share this view, that you can't talk about<br />
bringing in a consumption tax which would otherwise hurt people<br />
on lower incomes. You have got to have that compensation<br />
there would be $ 2 billion worth of it.<br />
S . r 1 </p>
<p>Right now if we could just take the total package then<br />
Prime Minister. That is, the cost to the government of the<br />
* thresbhold increase, the cost to the government of reducing<br />
the four marginal rates plus the pensions and the welfare<br />
benefits. What do you anticipate that to-cost you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I wonder Alan i. f I could put the total picture to you this<br />
way I think it would be clearest: what we would get from<br />
bringing in the broad based consumption tax would be Just over<br />
$ 14 billion. That would be increased revenue. The broadening<br />
of the direct tax base would bring in about $ 1 and 3/ 4: billion.<br />
But then the offsets that you refer to; we would abolish the<br />
wholesale tax which would cost about $ 5 billion. The compensation<br />
package that I just talked about of just under $ 2 billion and<br />
some slight changes in the excise levels and other administrative<br />
changes about billion, so the costs . of. those abolition<br />
and the compensation is about bi. llion. Now when you take<br />
that billion off the approx. $ 16 billion we get from the<br />
broad based consumption tax and the broadening of the tax base<br />
leaves you about billion which you can then use to vepy<br />
substantially reduce the personal direct taxes and which as I<br />
say at the level of average earnings would give you the<br />
30% 1/ reduction in tax. Now Alan people may ask well how is it<br />
that you're able to say to the great majority of Australians<br />
you'll be better off under this tax reform. I think you will<br />
appreciate there are two elements in it when you look at those<br />
total figures that I'm talking about two elements which give<br />
you more, revenue to distribute to the mass of Australians.<br />
Firstly, that the broadening of the direct tax base which gets<br />
into areas where people are simply evading and avoiding, that's<br />
about $ 1 and 3/ 4 billion. But also you see that large number<br />
of people who are paying no tax at all now on their income<br />
because they are avoiding or evading, with a broad based<br />
consumption tax you're getting a benefit there you are<br />
getting revenue from them that currently you miss. So when you<br />
take those two things together the broadening of the direct<br />
tax base to get the people who are avoiding, pltis the revenue<br />
you get from them on their consumption which you dont get now,,<br />
that gives you a net benefit as a community which you are able<br />
to distribute so that the great mass of Australians in net<br />
terms will be off.<br />
JONES: Quite right and Prim Minister I agree with that position<br />
entirely and have said so. I think that indirect tax at<br />
least prevents people from getting out of that net and makes<br />
people meet their obligation and I just would put to you the<br />
next proposition which I have in fact equally argued strongly<br />
and it's a counter position to yours. Why then, when such a<br />
comm~ endable initiative is in place, do you prejudice this<br />
opportunity for acceptance by moving into the fringe benefits<br />
and the capital gains area?<br />
PRlIME MAINISTER:<br />
Wiell I'm glad you asked that Alan. Could I just go to the<br />
points you raise one by one. If you look at the fringe benefit<br />
area, all the evidence shows, Alan, that that's absolutely<br />
exploding now and it would treble or more within the manner of<br />
about three years and so the great mass of Australians who<br />
don't get that benefit would be even further prejudiced and<br />
something simply has to be done about that we believe if you<br />
are going to close of that very significant haemorrhaging </p>
<p>' of the tax revenue base.<br />
JONES: Could I just before you go make two Points there PM?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Sure. JONES: One is I'm just wondering whether that obvious explosion which<br />
you're talking about isn't a manifestation of the high<br />
marginal levels and secondly, I'm just wondering that if this<br />
goes ahedd that the employer won't Just scrap those benefits,<br />
put them as taxable income, which means the bloke is going to<br />
be worse off than he was now.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No in regard to those non-cash fringe benefits It would be a<br />
tax on the employer. Now there will be varied responses to<br />
that Alan. In many cases I think the employer would say well<br />
that is something which I will bear. In some cases, Alan,<br />
they might just say alright we'll transfer that to an<br />
equivalent, or more than equivalent, cash payment in which case<br />
the beneficiary would be better off by the reduction to the<br />
extent of the very significant reduction in marginal rates<br />
that we will be bringing in and obviously in some cases<br />
Alan they would say oh well we won't go on with this. W/ here<br />
the allowances are there as a result of specific arbitration<br />
they will be exempt from this provision so when you look at<br />
that total package Alan there will be dif ferent responses but<br />
again'I've got to come hack to this point. You're right<br />
absolutely right in saying that this will be an area of<br />
concern, perhaps some risk for the government, but I believe<br />
responsibility we've got to put before the Australian people<br />
the dimensions of what has been lost to revenue and most<br />
importantly'the obvious fact that if something is not done<br />
about this it will explode in a way which will cost the revenue<br />
very, very dearly into the future.<br />
JONES: Prime Minister I don't mean to be personal about this but<br />
I suppose that the first question the public will ask is<br />
where then do politicians fit into this with air travel and<br />
those sorts of benefits which I personally thi~ nk are<br />
important to induce the best people into the job?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I made the point whether its politicians or ordinary<br />
workers where they have benefits which are a result of<br />
arbitration, where there has been a deliberate dodislon Ly<br />
an independent arbital authority if it should be given for<br />
the purpose of allowing a particular job to be done<br />
appropriately then they w41l be excluded and politicians<br />
won't be treated any differently in that respect from<br />
anyone else in the community.<br />
JONES: So that because the Remuneration. Tribunal. has so determined<br />
those sorts of allowances will be exempt from this taxation?<br />
14: </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes well let me make it clear; to be fair it's not just<br />
politicians whether it's railway workers or anyone else<br />
where a particular provision has been not just given whim by<br />
an employer but has been subject to independent arbitration<br />
then that would not be affected and there'd be many more<br />
people than politicians, infinitely more, that would be<br />
covered in that way.<br />
JONES: Well now could I just take the because time is always against<br />
us but the capital . gain question PM.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Capital gains-yes?<br />
JONES: No I mean obviously a lot of money now of investors which<br />
have a few bob goes into the housing industry and that<br />
provides tremendously in Sydney here tremendous problems in<br />
the shortage of rental accommodation. Now isn't this going to<br />
act as a disincentive to the person who invests money in the<br />
house and may he not seek compensation for the capital gains<br />
imposed upon that investment by raising rentals which is also<br />
going to damage the very bloke we're looking to protect?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh a very fair I wonder if you'd excuse me if I just said a<br />
number of things, some directly in regard to that and then<br />
more generally about capital gains. Firstly, it is the<br />
case that uncertainty about whether there would be a capital<br />
gains tax or not I think has had had some impact upon investment<br />
decisions in the rental market. Now I believe that once there is<br />
certainty after dicussion with the community on this and<br />
I believe that on balance the community will come to see the<br />
benefits of a capital gains tax which I'll go to in a moment<br />
once the uncertainty is removed then these things will sort<br />
themselves out. I make the second point which I think is<br />
relevant to that and more to your specific points but also<br />
more generally relevant, and it is this: Australians have to'<br />
ask themselves I think this question why is it that<br />
virtually every other western country has a form of capital<br />
gains tax and what is it that's unique about Australia that we<br />
shouldn't have it. The answer I think is this it's in<br />
two parts first, and both of them are relevant to Australia,<br />
firstly, it is unfair that a person, an ordinary worker,<br />
should through the sweat of his muscles or the exercise of his<br />
mental capacity go out and earn money and then pay tax on that<br />
but you could have a situation where other people derive very<br />
considerable income by way of capital gain and make no<br />
contribution to the general revenue as a result of those<br />
changes. And so the world has said that it's inequitable,<br />
that you should make that distinction against people who derive<br />
income by their actual work. Secondly and very importantly,<br />
in some senses more importantly, the rest of the world has said<br />
that it is important to have a capital gains tax in place<br />
as an effective instrument against tax avoidance and evasion.<br />
So in other words Alan this is a very modest tax in the sense<br />
that not an enormous amount of revenue will be derived from<br />
it that is proof of its modesty but it will be an important<br />
part of the armoury which I believe the Australian community<br />
is entitled to have to stop tax avoidance and evasion<br />
( WORD INAUDIBLE) make these specific points about the proposed<br />
capital gains tax which I think you would appreciate. </p>
<p>JUNES:<br />
* Jes I do. I would say though In answer to that dnd we always<br />
seem to get cracked for time but I would have thought that<br />
that. is one of the incentives to investment. I mean if we've<br />
got shortages in the housing industry there has to be.-we've<br />
got to try and generate haven't we some investment for people<br />
to put their money there as oppsoed to the famous problem of<br />
the election campaign under the beds so to speak.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Let me make this point about housing: it's the responsbility<br />
of governments by general and specific economic policies to<br />
ensure that the housing requirement of the community are<br />
met as quickly as possible and that's why we have specifically<br />
brought in policies to do that,-as a result of two things<br />
it was the First Home Owvners Scheme and also a significant<br />
increase a 50% increase ina funds for public housing which<br />
has produced the result now that the housinig industry is<br />
operating at its capacity of 150,000 units per year. Now that<br />
has the industry almost at more than full capacity so that<br />
all that would happen now if you had more activity in the<br />
housing area would be a reflection in prices rather than more<br />
supplies so I can assure you Alan that we are talzing the<br />
range of decisions that regard to housing and also construction,<br />
because you'll recall that In our previous budget we introduced<br />
a further Investment allowance for bildings the depreciation<br />
allowance for buildings which has acted as a stimulus to<br />
construction in tbat area.<br />
JONES: Rlight. Well PM finally and we'll close off here but a<br />
yes/ no; I suppose everybody will be asking at the end of the<br />
day whether the excise on grog is going to go at the rate it<br />
is. Is that a yes or a no?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No you will find that decision has been taken wvhich will mean<br />
that in regard to.-grog, beer in particular, there vvill. be a<br />
decision which will mean that grog won't be disadvantaged.<br />
JONES: Right. Alright Prime Minister, much appreciated that you've<br />
taken the trouble to explain what is a fairly complicated area.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Alan can I just say two things very quickly: thank you very<br />
much for this interview. And secondly can I say that I<br />
appreciate the positive and constructive way in which we're<br />
able to discuss this with you and I hope that in the day and.:<br />
the weeks ahead we'll have further opportunities to do it.<br />
JONES: You'll be-most welcome Prime Minister and I appreciate those<br />
remarks. The Prime Minister of Australia, Mr. Bob Hlawke. </p>
