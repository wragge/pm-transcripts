    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>HIS EXCELLENCY MR SHINZO ABE, PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN: </strong></p>
<p>[Translator]</p>
<p>I’d like to welcome Malcolm Turnbull to Japan. And also the fact that he kindly took time to spend some time with me, to see the demonstration and presentation by the Self Defence Forces Unit including the Special Operations Unit. It is a testament that there has been steady progress in our joint effort to promote security cooperation between Japan and Australia.</p>
<p>So on this occasion I very much look forward to having a candid discussion to cover a wide range of issues including the threat of North Korea, as well as the security situation in the entirety of the Pacific region, together with the economic issues including the prospect to conclude the TPP 11.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Well thank you very much, and thank you very much for the very warm welcome and the magnificent demonstration of capability at the Narashino base this morning.</p>
<p>It’s good to see the product of cooperation between the Self Defence Forces and the Australian Defence Force and also to look forward to further cooperation and of course the joint exercises of our respective Air Forces very shortly. So, it’s been a very, very useful visit for me to see the extent of that cooperation and look forward to doing more of it.</p>
<p>At the same time, we’re of the same mind in terms of free trade and open markets and maintaining the rule of law in our region which has been the foundation for so much economic growth that both our countries are enjoying at the moment. And I look forward to discussing to how we can advance our shared goals and values in the discussion this evening.</p>
