    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, very nice to talk to you Howard.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Thanks for joining us.......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm getting a bit of echo, but maybe the technicians will</p>
<p>   remove that as we go along.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>We'll pass the message on.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Little sir echo. That's me.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Never say that.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right, now come on, tell us, will a goods and services tax</p>
<p>   or its equivalent be part of the Government's next election</p>
<p>   policy? We want to know.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You can't reform the taxation system in a big way without</p>
<p>   addressing the need to get rid of the present indirect taxation</p>
<p>   system and replace it with a broadly based one. So if you're</p>
<p>   really serious about tax reform you've got to look at that,</p>
<p>   because the present system does include an enormous range of hidden</p>
<p>   taxes. I'll bet most of your listeners don't pay, don't</p>
<p>   know that they pay a 32% wholesale sales tax when they buy a television</p>
<p>   set. They don't know that they pay a 12% wholesale sales tax</p>
<p>   when they buy such things as soap and detergent. They don't</p>
<p>   know that they pay a 22% sales tax when they buy a lot of other</p>
<p>   household goods. And of course, they probably do know that they</p>
<p>   pay a 22% wholesale sales tax if they buy a family car, yet the</p>
<p>   one or two people listening to this program who can afford to buy</p>
<p>   a lear jet, don't pay any wholesale sales tax on that at all.</p>
<p>   Now that is a plainly unfair, increasingly unworkable, old-fashioned,</p>
<p>   out-of-date system. And any scheme to fundamentally reform the Australian</p>
<p>   taxation system would take an axe to that sort of approach and have</p>
<p>   a more broadly based, but obviously, much lower rate of tax.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right well you've almost, and why don't you just</p>
<p>   declare yourself that you're going to get rid of the wholesale</p>
<p>   sales tax which we don't......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm not, I'm obviously not declaring myself about the</p>
<p>   whole package until we're ready to release the whole package.</p>
<p>   I mean I've said all along, Howard look, I'm not going</p>
<p>   to play those games.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>No, but you've convinced me that the wholesale sales tax system</p>
<p>   should go and I guess you want to influence the electors.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well of course I will, and part of the process of reforming the</p>
<p>   tax system is to point out the weaknesses of the present system.</p>
<p>   I mean apart from anything else, the present wholesale tax system</p>
<p>   exempts some things totally (we're still getting the echo)</p>
<p>   and, but, has a very very high rate on a whole lot of other items.</p>
<p>   And the worst feature economically is that it penalises our exporters.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>How badly?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well very badly. It makes them on average much worse off than their</p>
<p>   competitors from other countries, because what we do is we tax the</p>
<p>   inputs to those things that we export overseas. I mean the process</p>
<p>   of goods being made for export overseas, the people who make them</p>
<p>   have to pay tax on the things that go into their manufacture, whereas</p>
<p>   under the tax systems against which our exporters compete, from</p>
<p>   the exporters, against the exporters from other countries, under</p>
<p>   those alternatives tax systems, and the alternatives to ours, there</p>
<p>   are no such taxes on inputs. So the worst feature from an overall</p>
<p>   economic point of view for Australia is that the present system</p>
<p>   is a penalty on exports and that alone is a very powerful argument</p>
<p>   for reforming the Australian taxation system.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>And almost everyone of those economies has got a GST.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they don't call it that, they call it all sorts of different</p>
<p>   things.....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>It doesn't matter what you call it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>....they have an indirect tax system that doesn't penalise</p>
<p>   their exporters. We have one that gives a rabbit killer to our exporters</p>
<p>   every time that they manufacture something for export. Now that</p>
<p>   is a stupid taxation system and people for years have recognised</p>
<p>   this. The Labor Party new this in the mid 1980's. I mean Mr</p>
<p>   Beazley and Mr Evans in 1985 were very strong supporters of Paul</p>
<p>   Keating's push to have a change to the tax system and to have</p>
<p>   a broad based consumption tax. They were very strong supporters.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Okay, are you going to set up a system that also allows the States</p>
<p>   and yourself to get rid of those little insidious taxes like FID</p>
<p>   and BAD, and payroll taxes and that sort of thing?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I said when we started this exercise, Howard, that one of</p>
<p>   things we would do is address some of the weaknesses in the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   - State financial relationship and the ones that you've mentioned</p>
<p>   are part of that are there are some other issues and I believe that</p>
<p>   at the end of the process that what we produce will be something</p>
<p>   that the States will see as a very significant advance on the present</p>
<p>   system. Now I've had some discussion with State Premiers and</p>
<p>   I certainly expect to have some more with them before the tax package</p>
<p>   is finalised. Because although at the end of the day, we have to</p>
<p>   take the decisions, we are keen to have the views of the States.</p>
<p>   We're keen their input. We're very keen to discuss various</p>
<p>   options with them and that's part and parcel of the process.</p>
<p>   But I do want your listeners to understand that the goal of taxation</p>
<p>   reform is not some kind of revolution. We're not trying to</p>
<p>   turn the system on its head. What we're trying to do is to</p>
<p>   reform the tax system as the next thing we have to do to provide</p>
<p>   greater safety and security and stability to the Australian economy.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Okay, you're going to put more money in our pockets?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There will be lower personal tax. </p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>How much lower?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I can't tell you that, and I'm not even going to</p>
<p>   speculate. But one thing I want to make crystal clear is that we</p>
<p>   will not be introducing a GST, or anything else that parades under</p>
<p>   that name, on top of the existing system and we certainly won't</p>
<p>   be introducing taxation reform that does not include very significant</p>
<p>   reductions in personal income tax.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Would you raise the threshold because at the moment.....at the</p>
<p>   moment you go into paying almost half of your dollars to the Government</p>
<p>   when you get to one-and-a-half times the average weekly wage. I</p>
<p>   mean, about 20 years ago it was about 10 times...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is one of the weaknesses in the present system. What...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>It saps incentive?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well of course it saps incentive. I mean years ago you had to be</p>
<p>   earning in today's dollars, the equivalent of about $500,000</p>
<p>   - $600,000 a year, and there aren't many people who do that,</p>
<p>   before you'd pay the top marginal rate of tax. If we go as</p>
<p>   we are under the present system, by the year 2000, you'll be</p>
<p>   hitting the top marginal rate of tax if you're earning less</p>
<p>   than $1000 a week. And the average wage earners....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>(inaudible) wharfies would be hit by that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Indeed. Indeed they would. </p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But you see....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm still getting the echo.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yep, we're trying to work on that. I'm not but someone</p>
<p>   else is. But the unions for a start are going to line up with your</p>
<p>   opponents. Now, what do you say about that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't think they're serving the interests of their</p>
<p>   members because a lot of trade unionists in Australia resent the</p>
<p>   fact that somebody on average weekly earnings is now losing 43 cents</p>
<p>   in the dollar on every additional dollar he or she earns. And if</p>
<p>   that situation is left unchecked it will be even worse by the year</p>
<p>   2000. And I don't think a lot of union members will appreciate</p>
<p>   the fact that the unions are going to oppose reforming a system</p>
<p>   that allows a lot of people to cheat on it in the black economy.</p>
<p>   Now there's a significant amount of revenue lost through the</p>
<p>   black economy in Australia and one of the advantages of reforming</p>
<p>   the existing taxation system is that you get stuck into the black</p>
<p>   economy and it's much harder to evade. And, so I would say</p>
<p>   to rank and file trade unionists, if your leaders start attacking</p>
<p>   our reforms, look to your own self interests. Ask yourself whether</p>
<p>   you are better off with the present system which has all these hidden</p>
<p>   wholesale taxes at very high levels like 22% and 32% on household</p>
<p>   items, or would you be better of with a reformed system that gave</p>
<p>   some relief to the average wage earner at the margin, and also allowed</p>
<p>   the collection of tax from people who are now evading their responsibilities</p>
<p>   under the existing taxation system. And the other thing I would</p>
<p>   say to rank and file trade unionists is that in 1993, the Labor</p>
<p>   Party campaigned against John Hewson's Fightback program and</p>
<p>   basically said.....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>And won by the way.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They won, yeah, but they won by saying this Howard. They won by</p>
<p>   saying Âwe will give you income tax cuts without a GST.'.</p>
<p>   After they won the election, they did the exact reverse. They didn't</p>
<p>   give us the infamous L-A-W Law personal income tax cuts, but to</p>
<p>   make matters worse, they introduced their own version of a GST via</p>
<p>   huge increases in the wholesale tax system. They were monstrously</p>
<p>   regressive increases, hurt the poor and were accompanied by absolutely</p>
<p>   no compensation at all for the people who were affected by those</p>
<p>   increases. So what they said before 1993 was personal tax cuts without</p>
<p>   a GST. What they did after 1993 was the exact opposite. I think</p>
<p>   that is a very strong warning to the Australian public as to what</p>
<p>   the Labor Party might say before the coming election.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>The Prime Minister's told me he'll take some calls, so</p>
<p>   we'll take a break and then we'll be back doing just that.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>And we're talking with the Prime Minister of Australia and</p>
<p>   he's offered to speak with you as well. Are you there Prime</p>
<p>   Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, I am indeed. And the echo's gone.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>There you go. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Howard minus the echo.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Just before our first caller whose name by the way is Pam, I just</p>
<p>   wonder how much of what you go on with at the end of the day is</p>
<p>   going to depend on the elector feedback of the Queensland election.</p>
<p>   That will be the first opportunity for people to really I guess</p>
<p>   have a say about a prospective direct tax like a GST.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm not too sure about that Howard. I think the Queensland</p>
<p>   election will largely be decided by State issues. I don't subscribe</p>
<p>   too strongly to the view that State elections are dominated by Federal</p>
<p>   issues or vice versa. I wouldn't see the outcome of the Queensland</p>
<p>   election as expressing any view on taxation reform. I see it as</p>
<p>   very much an expression of the voters views up there about the performance</p>
<p>   of the Borbidge Government. I believe the Borbidge Government will</p>
<p>   get back, I believe it deserves to get back. And ...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>With the help of One Nation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't know what is going to happen to One Nation preferences</p>
<p>   but could I say this that I thought that the Anglican Archbishop</p>
<p>   of Brisbane, Archbishop Hollingworth, had something very sensible</p>
<p>   to say last night regarding people who might be contemplating voting</p>
<p>   for One Nation and he wasn't expressing a view as to whether</p>
<p>   they should or they shouldn't, and he said something very similar</p>
<p>   to what I've said for a number of months and that is that there</p>
<p>   are a lot of people in the Australian community who for one reason</p>
<p>   or other have been affected by economic change and they feel perhaps</p>
<p>   that they are being unfairly affected by that change and they are</p>
<p>   therefore very receptive to simplistic solutions being mouthed by</p>
<p>   people who have not had previous experience of political office,</p>
<p>   or who pretend that complex issues can be resolved by snap-of-the-finger</p>
<p>   simplistic solutions, and there is a simplistic approach in many</p>
<p>   of the utterances of the One Nation people and I think what he was</p>
<p>   saying to them, and what I'd be saying is that don't imagine</p>
<p>   that somebody who comes along with a simple populist solution has</p>
<p>   any better capacity to solve the difficult problems of the 1990s</p>
<p>   than say the National Party and the Liberal Party in Queensland.</p>
<p>   Because Pauline Hanson's group has no magic wand answers, it</p>
<p>   has no answers that haven't been looked at before and the idea</p>
<p>   that a Party, simply because it is trying to draw on public discontent</p>
<p>   against mainstream political parties, the idea that that party has</p>
<p>   some easy solution to difficult problems is a myth and people will</p>
<p>   find that by supporting it, that they perhaps might get burnt by</p>
<p>   the myth and in the process they might be voting for some other</p>
<p>   policies that are not in Australia's interests.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Okay but you are not in Queensland today so...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you asked me the question.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Yes I did. All right here we go. Pam's your first caller.</p>
<p>   Hello Pam. You are able to talk with your Prime Minister.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes, I'd like to speak to him about the GST, as far as the</p>
<p>   pensioners are concerned, and also too I think that is exceptionally</p>
<p>   wrong that he can't tell us about about... that he will definitely</p>
<p>   take off the taxes that were already on the things....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>It's part of the tactics Pam, don't worry.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I'm sorry, I have made it very clear that we are not</p>
<p>   going to put a new indirect tax, whatever you might call it, on</p>
<p>   top of the existing indirect tax system. That would be crazy, it</p>
<p>   would represent an increase in the tax burden and it simply won't</p>
<p>   happen. So the answer is, I have told you.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>So the Wholesale Sales Tax would go, Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, of course if you are going to bring in a new indirect tax</p>
<p>   system, you'd replace the existing one. Of course.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right Pam, thanks very much for your call. And Joy is next,</p>
<p>   Prime Minister. Good morning Joy.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning both of you. What I'm after is to find out why</p>
<p>   all this money we are sending to Indonesia when Soeharto's</p>
<p>   got $40 billion put away and our people, the pensioners have to</p>
<p>   go on a measly $6.50 rise which I'd like to see you people</p>
<p>   in power to live off of every week. Especially when you have ....</p>
<p>   that you have to buy and get expensive medication and then you've</p>
<p>   also got the low wage earners, we have quite a lot of people here</p>
<p>   who are down below the poverty line just as well as Indonesia and</p>
<p>   I think charity starts at home. I think you should try and live</p>
<p>   on what we live on.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I understand the view that charity does begin at home, I</p>
<p>   also would ask the listener to understand that in order for this</p>
<p>   country to do well and to provide jobs for its citizens and decent</p>
<p>   wages for its citizens, it does need to sell goods and services</p>
<p>   overseas. We can't live without trading and the reason that</p>
<p>   we have helped Indonesia is that it is in our own national interest</p>
<p>   to have a stronger Indonesian economy. It is in our national interest</p>
<p>   to make certain that the countries of the Asia Pacific region are</p>
<p>   strong enough economically so they can continue to buy goods and</p>
<p>   services from Australia.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But Prime Minister, do you think the Soeharto family could have</p>
<p>   done a lot more for their own country?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Obviously the answer to that is yes. Obviously there are practices</p>
<p>   in many countries around the world with which I do not agree. I</p>
<p>   have certain constraints placed upon me as Prime Minister as to</p>
<p>   what I can say in relation to those things. On the other hand, you've</p>
<p>   got to think of the aggregate impact on the poorer sections of those</p>
<p>   populations and also the aggregate impact on Australia of a ...I</p>
<p>   mean, if we allow the nations of Asia-Pacific to be impoverished</p>
<p>   by the current economic turmoil, that will damage Australia, it</p>
<p>   will reduce living standards in Australia, it will put Australians</p>
<p>   out of work and it will reduce our capacity as a Government, for</p>
<p>   example, to give the pension increase that the lady referred to,</p>
<p>   to provide the Senior's Card which was announced in the Budget,</p>
<p>   to a quarter of a million self-funded retirees, and it will reduce</p>
<p>   our capacity to deliver the interest rate reductions that the Australian</p>
<p>   community has enjoyed over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>But Prime Minister how do you feel when I tell you, and this is</p>
<p>   fact, that a member of Soeharto's family, a very direct member,</p>
<p>   was down here gambling at the casino last week. I mean, where would</p>
<p>   that money come from?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, ....</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>This at a time when his country is in turmoil.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Howard, I don't know the particular circumstances of that</p>
<p>   and you know that I can't get in...</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>I know but it makes people angry.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I understand that and I do understand that anger, but I ask</p>
<p>   those people in their anger to think for a moment as to whether</p>
<p>   it is in Australia's interests for the nations of the Asia</p>
<p>   Pacific region to go down hill economically, because we sell altogether,</p>
<p>   we sell 33% of our exports to Japan and Korea alone, and we gave</p>
<p>   assistance to help the Korean economy and that will come back to</p>
<p>   us in more than the measure of what we gave, through the increased</p>
<p>   exports, through the jobs that those export industries... and speaking</p>
<p>   to a Western Australian audience which exports an enormous amount</p>
<p>   to Japan and Korea, I ask your listeners to understand that if we</p>
<p>   allow those countries to go down hill, if we allow them to fail</p>
<p>   economically, we are hurting ourselves. Now, that's the reason</p>
<p>   why, the major reason why we've given the assistance. I am</p>
<p>   very conscious that it was not in the short term a politically popular</p>
<p>   thing to do, but in the long term interests of our country we have</p>
<p>   to sell abroad. I mean we can't survive on our own and therefore,</p>
<p>   you need economies abroad that are able to buy our goods and services</p>
<p>   and it is in our interests to help those countries just as it was</p>
<p>   in the interests of nations like the United States after WWII to</p>
<p>   have a Marshall plan that resurrected Europe and meant that Europe</p>
<p>   in time was able to buy goods and services from the United States.</p>
<p>   If they had refused to engage in that Marshall plan immediately</p>
<p>   after the war the American economy would not have boomed in the</p>
<p>   way that it did through the 1960s and the 1970s. </p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Okay, I want to squeeze a couple of more calls in because you've</p>
<p>   got to go in a minute. Good morning to you Mark.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>This is a question to the Prime Minister regarding a GST rate.</p>
<p>   Is it going to be fixed at 10% or is it just going to keep increasing</p>
<p>   like it has done in England. You know, GST started in England in</p>
<p>   single digit figures. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I haven't talked about any particular rate but you can</p>
<p>   rest assured...</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Well, we heard it's 10%.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you hear a lot of things, I wouldn't believe anything</p>
<p>   you....</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>But whatever rate it is going to be....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, whatever we, if we introduce a new broad based indirect tax,</p>
<p>   you can rest assured whatever it is introduced at it will stay at.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>All right thanks for that, and Ian good morning.</p>
<p>SATTLER:</p>
<p>Ian we are going to have to put you on hold because we won't</p>
<p>   get him. But Tony we can get you. Hello Tony.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>G'day Mr Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>How are you Tony?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I heard you talking about One Nation and I want to let you know</p>
<p>   that I am not </p>
