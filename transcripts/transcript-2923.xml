ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
MR. E. G. WHITLAM<br />
TO THE FIRST COMMIONWEALTH CONFERENCE<br />
OF THE AMALGAMATED METALWORKERS?<br />
UNION MUSICIANS' CLUB, 94 CHALMERS<br />
STREET, SYDNEY, ' 11 MAY 1973<br />
UNIONS AN]) THE GOVERNMENT<br />
This conference is the culmination of an historic process of<br />
change within the metal trades unions. It is alsot I hope, the forerunner<br />
of a similar process of change throughout the whole trade union<br />
movement. The purpose of this change is to produce unions that are<br />
more effective, more efficient and more democratic. What you have<br />
achieved will have a far-reaching impact on the well-being of every<br />
Australian worker and his family. Its importance cannot be overestimated.<br />
The Amalgamated Metalworkerst Union is indeed ahead of its<br />
time. It has put into effect, or is actively pursuing, many of the aims<br />
and reforms embodied in the industrial legislation passed by the House<br />
of Representatives this week. Your union has set the pace, and set an<br />
example, for the rest of Australia. You are not only the biggest union<br />
in Australia as a result of your recent amalgamation: you are among the<br />
most democratic in your internal administration. It is a remarkable fact<br />
that of the 144 delegates to your first Commonwealth conference this<br />
week, 85% have come direct from the work-bench. You have demonstrated<br />
that the amalgamation of unions, and the concentration of industrial<br />
strength in larger organisations, can be achieved without creating an<br />
unwieldy bureaucracy or diminishing the rights of individual members.<br />
The emphasis you have always placed on participatory democracy, on<br />
industrial safety, on the importance of industrial agreements, on trade<br />
union education, is reflected in the legislation introduced in the<br />
national Parliament by my colleague, the Minister for Labour, and passed<br />
this week. The success with which you have tackled these matters augurs<br />
well for the success of our bill. In the face of much-sitfident clamour<br />
from our opponents, you have shown what can be done.<br />
Today I want to announce some further plans of the Government<br />
to improve the rights and conditions of trade unionists and promote<br />
better industrial relations in Australia. But first let me deal with<br />
some of the broad principles underlying our approach to industrial<br />
matters, This year has been on the whole a harmonious one in industrial<br />
relations. There has been no major or prolonged industrial stoppage,<br />
and the general morale within the trade union movement is high.<br />
I do not, of course, want to downgrade your legitimate<br />
grievances or fears. Many of them are shared by the Government, and<br />
I shall have more to say about that later0 But you will all remember<br />
what our opponents were saying before the last election. There were<br />
all sorts of calamity-howlers predicting strife and dissention, union<br />
blackmail9 industrial chaos and the breakdown of law and order if Labor<br />
achieved power0 I hardly need to tell you how baseless and puerile these<br />
statements look now0 Today we have a new understanding and a new trust<br />
between the Government and the unions. We want to ensure that the same<br />
understanding and trust prevail between unions and employersw </p>
<p>-2-<br />
That indeed is the purpose of our recent conciliation and<br />
arbitration legislation. There can be no trust or understanding in<br />
industry if one side feels itself to be aggrieved or the victim of<br />
discrimination,. There can be no trust or goodwill if union officials<br />
are open to civil prosecution for upholding their members' interests.<br />
There can be no trust or goodwill if the law makes a criminal of the<br />
working man who chooses to withdraw his labour,. There can be no trust<br />
or goodwill if compulsory arbitration takes precedence over direct and<br />
amicable conciliation and discussion between the parties to a dispute.<br />
All these aspects of the old law are being removed. There is no need<br />
for me to rehearse the provisions of our legislation, which must be<br />
famil~ iar to you all. I shall, however, mention our proposals on union<br />
amalgamation, since they are closely relevant to what your own union has<br />
been doing. We give a high priority to efforts to encourage amalIgamations.<br />
Even the Opposition supports amalgamation in principle, though they<br />
capitulated last year to the DLP's opposition to amalgamations when<br />
industrial legislation was before the Parliament. The Opposition had<br />
a chance to demonstrate this week that it was free of the shackles of<br />
the DLP by supporting our amalgamation proposal. They failed to do so,<br />
Yet we all know the benefits that amalgamations can bring. They can<br />
strengthen the negotiating power of unions and equip them for conditions<br />
of modern industrial bargaining between ever-growing corporations and<br />
large Government employers. It is absurd that we should have mor+! than<br />
305 separate trade unions in Australia with half of them having fi. wer<br />
than * 1,000 members and only 14 with a membership of more than 50,000.<br />
In West Germany, with a much larger population, and with one of the<br />
lowest rates of industrial stoppages in Europe, there are only 16<br />
unions. Their Metal Workerst Union has more than 2 million members.<br />
It, is just as important that unions should be strong enough to withstand<br />
the power of big corporations as it is that Governments should be strong<br />
enough to withstand the same pressures<br />
The benefits of amalgamation have been demonstrated by your own<br />
union, We are determined that the opportunity for amalgamation should be<br />
cast as widely as possible so that smaller unions, in particular, will<br />
be able to avail themselves of this reform if they want it. In this way<br />
they can enjoy savings in administrative costs and the elimination of<br />
waste and duplicated work. They can afford higher salaries for their<br />
officials, and draw their officials from a greater poo. of talent that<br />
a small union can offer.. They would be able to afford libraries,, research<br />
staff and independent economic and legal advice which may now be beyond<br />
their resources,* Let me quote what Mr. Lynch, the Deputy Leader of the<br />
Opposition, said about anion amalgamations in Melbourne on 2 March 1972:<br />
" It is fair to say that provided the membership of industrial organisations<br />
does not lose effective control as a result of amalgamations, there are<br />
many advantages which can accrue from amalgamation. For instance, there<br />
are some 300 unions in Australia. Most of them are very small,. It could<br />
facilitate the functioning of the arbitration system and relations<br />
generally between employers and unions if this number of unions decreased'.<br />
I know of situations in which employers have sat across the table with no<br />
fewer than 15 unions in relation to one issue. Government departments<br />
have had this experiencelw" 0 .0 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
It is good to know there is on Opposition member on our side,<br />
who supports what your union has been doing.. From what I heart they are<br />
even talking now of amalgamations among the numerous Opposition parties.<br />
That applies to the DLP and the Country Party. The Country Party and the<br />
Liberal Party have not yet decided whether to amalgamate or not.. They<br />
have only just settled the question of who is the second most important<br />
person in the Opposition,~ The example of the Metal Workorst Union should<br />
commend itself to them. I suppose there is always a risk in the eyes of<br />
the DLP that an amalgamated Opposition would fall under Communist control.<br />
The other thing I should like to stress about our industrial<br />
legislation is that we have a clear public mandate for it. Our proposals<br />
were fiibmly stated in my policy speech for -the House of Representatives<br />
election. They were publicly determined by the Federal Conference of<br />
the Australian Labor Party in Launceston in 1971. They have been given<br />
wide publicity. Mr. Cameron, the Minister for Labour, has expounded<br />
and explained them fully in speeches throughout Australia, In these<br />
circumstances we cannot and will not tolerate interference with our<br />
proposals from the Senate. In my press conference this week I made it<br />
clear and I state it again that the rejection of these proposals<br />
would have to be studied in the context of the provisions of the<br />
Constitution for a double dissolutioi. On a bill of substance such as<br />
this, we would not brook interference with our publicly-en~ lorsed program<br />
to promote industrial harmony and to remove injustices against the<br />
working people who comprise the majority of our population.<br />
There is another important area in which the national Government<br />
can protect the interests of the working man. That is in the control<br />
of prices and inflation. I spoke earlier of what I know to be your<br />
legitimate grievances and fears and the fear of unjustified price<br />
rises is the foremost of these fears. Yesterday I attended a conference<br />
of the Premiers in Canberrat a conference called on the initiative of<br />
the Victorian Premier, at which I put forward a series of proposals<br />
designed to combat inflation in co-operation with the States. The<br />
Australian Government has already taken a number of measures, including<br />
revaluation of the dollar and the introduction of prices justification<br />
machinery, in a determined program to keep prices down,. But direct<br />
control of prices can, if necessary, only be taken as part of a national<br />
plan in which the State Governments co-operate fully. They alone have<br />
the powers. There is a powerful body of opinion which believes that<br />
inflationary tendencies can be checked only be restraint on incomes, or<br />
at least by means of a combined prices and incomes policy,. That view<br />
was put to yesterdayfs conference by three conservative State Governments.<br />
On the question of incomes I had this to say to Premiers in my opening<br />
statement, and I quote:<br />
" Some take the position that the be-all and end-all of antiinflationary<br />
policies is to fulminate against wage rises. That is not<br />
our position. On the contrary, we have moved to correct, in the areas<br />
under our own control, some evident anomalies and injustices. We have<br />
acted to increase social service payments to those-who have been most<br />
cruelly harmed by inflation. We make no apology for acting quickly to<br />
honour our election pledges in these fields&gt;. 0 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
We are happy that in Tuesday's aecision the Arbitration<br />
Commission has recognised the particular needs of low wage earners in<br />
giving them a substantial rise from the unrealistically low levels of<br />
the recent past. The Government does not take a rigid and doctrinaire<br />
position on the-se matters and our attitude to future wage claims, in<br />
National Wage Cases and elsewhere, will pay full regard to all of the<br />
circumstances, social and economict which prevail at the time."<br />
Let me tell you of some of the measures we contemplate to<br />
encourage a more informed and more efficient trade union movement and to<br />
improve working conditions in industry..<br />
First, accidents. We are determined to reduce the incidence<br />
of industrial accidents and occupational disease. We have announced<br />
new plans for compensation but our prime concern is to prevent<br />
accidents rather than alleviate their effects. The Government will draw<br />
up a new uniform industrial safety code to apply throughout Government<br />
departments and instrumentalities and in all establishments in the A. C. T.<br />
With proper precautions accidents can be prevented. This has been clearly<br />
demonstrated by BHP, where there has been a 93 percent reduction in<br />
accidents in the past 15 years and this in an industry, iron and steel,<br />
which must be ranked among the most dangerous.<br />
Second, supervision. We are anxious that safety conditions<br />
and all the provisions of industrial awards should be more effectively<br />
supervised. We propose * to appoint another 100 arbitration inspectors<br />
to police awards and safety standards,. One-third of them will be tradeunionists<br />
with a working knowledge of their industries.<br />
Third, trade union education. A well-educated and efficient<br />
trade union leadership is crucial to good industrial relations. Your<br />
union has taken the lead in this field by setting up its own training<br />
schools. Unions should have have to dissipate their resources in this<br />
way,. Such training should be a Government responsibility like all other<br />
forms of education. My Government will finance a national training<br />
college with a centre in each capital city to train unionists and offer<br />
overseas study scholarships to those with special talents.<br />
Fourth, apprenticeship. The Government is concerned at the<br />
failure of some employers to engage sufficient apprentices to meet their<br />
needs. This was possible because, under old immigration laws, employers<br />
were content to bring in tradesmen from overseas while neglecting the<br />
training of our own workmen. The Department of Labour is studying the<br />
possibility of introducing one year's " block training" of apprentices,<br />
instead of obliging them to spread their technical education<br />
intermittently over four years. The year of " block training" wouldt if<br />
implemented, be followed by three years' apprenticeship on the job,<br />
making a total of four years altogether,.<br />
We believe these measures will contribute further to the wellbeing<br />
of workers and to enlightened and harmonious industrial relations.<br />
No Government has a greater interest than mine in preserving and strengthening<br />
the foundations of industrial peace in this country. No union<br />
has a greater interest than yours in ensuring the success of these<br />
endeavours. I am confident that Government and unions can work<br />
together as they have in the past for a more just and prosperous<br />
society. </p>
