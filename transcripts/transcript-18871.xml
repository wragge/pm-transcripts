<p>The Prime Minister and members of the Gillard Government today joined thousands of people across Australia to share a cup of tea with friends, family and fellow campaigners in support of a National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS).</p>
<p>More than 1700 DisabiliTEA events are being held across the country, bringing together people with disability, their families and carers, service providers, advocates and other community members for morning or afternoon tea.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government has delivered $1 billion for the first stage of a National Disability Insurance Scheme, which will be launched from mid-next year.</p>
<p>The first stage will roll out in the Hunter in New South Wales, the Barwon area of Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the ACT.</p>
<p>About 20,000 Australians with significant and permanent disability in the launch sites will benefit from the first stage of the scheme and will:</p>
<p> * 	work with local people to identify their plans and goals for the future;<br />
 * 	be assessed to receive individualised care and support packages;<br />
 * 	have decision-making power about their care and support, including choice of service provider;<br />
 * 	be assisted by local coordinators to help manage and deliver their support; and<br />
 * 	access a system they can easily navigate that links them to mainstream and community services.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government is committed to building a National Disability Insurance Scheme that will give people with disability the care and support they need over their lifetimes  -  a scheme that is sustainable now, and into the future.</p>
