PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
DOORSTOP, REGENT HOTEL, SYDNEY, 15 JULY 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: The first thing I'd like to say to you is this argument inside the Liberal Party is a<br />
real blue. It's a genuine dinky-di fight. And the reason it's there is because most<br />
people in the Liberal Party doubt John Hewson's commitment to the Liberal. Party.<br />
Some of you should inquire, but I don't think he joined the Liberal Party until<br />
about the early to mid 1980s. It's not a life-long commitment to the Liberal Party,<br />
it's a transitory commitment. And people like Mr Fife, who gave Dr Hewson<br />
loyalty and support when he became leader, and in the process of him becoming<br />
leader, had none of that returned to them when these challenges came up for these<br />
seats in New South Wales. You heard much about the Labor Party Conference and<br />
about pre-selection wrangles. None of ours are like this. T'his is a real one. And<br />
at the heart of it, the reason why M r King has thumbed his nose to Dr Hewson, and<br />
to some extent Mr Fahey, is because the Liberal Party organisation is asserting its<br />
prerogatives, particularly to a Federal leader, it doubts it has commitments to it,<br />
and where the old guard faithful members of the Party, whose commitment has<br />
been long shown, people like Mr Fife, have given loyalty and yet not had it<br />
returned, they are saying well we have Party prerogatives here which we're going<br />
to insist upon and we're not going to have the National Party push and decide,<br />
even if it is with the support of our leader who himself only has a transitory<br />
commitment to us. That's what this is about. It's about old guard faithful<br />
committed Liberals and their interests, and the interests of the professional<br />
careerists like Dr Hewson, who want to use the Liberal Party for their own<br />
purposes. That is point one. The second point is this. This is about policy on the run. We've<br />
now seen today the third variation of Dr Hewson's youth wage scheme. Two<br />
weeks ago he had the shocking temerity of accusing me ofmaik-ing policy on the<br />
run in relation to television. He had announced a youth wage out of nowhere.<br />
Within a week he has now varied it and tried to stick on a training voucher. As I<br />
pointed out, if you take these kids on $ 3 an hour, or $ 120 a week, and then take<br />
them out for two days for training, they actually end up on a wage lower than the<br />
dole. So, that bit of policy on the run is now again up this morning for review. </p>
<p>This Party has no serious policy structure for employment, for the employment of<br />
young people, or older Australians alike. It's basically in their sort of policy one<br />
the run, trying to make the day fit the moment, as their gab-fest a week or so ago<br />
was supposed to be about the GST and then became a discussion on youth policy.<br />
And that was very clearly dealt with this morning by Archbishp Hopllingworth<br />
who said that the whole Liberal Party approach to youth and youth wages was<br />
inadequate, and that we didn't need to prey upon people, and all that Dr Hewson<br />
would do, and Mr Howard with him, is not only to press youth wages but also to<br />
press the wages of older Australians, so for the first time ever we end up with a<br />
different class of people in this country. That is, those that are kicked off<br />
unemployment benefits after 9 months are left to be begging, so we have a<br />
begging class we've never had, and people are pushed into depressed levels of<br />
wages while other Australians can enjoy the fruits of this country.<br />
That sort of break with the past, that break in not pulling Australians along, that is<br />
giving people at the bottom end of the income ranges a share of the national cake,<br />
and giving them a piece of this country, that notion, that putting asunder of that<br />
egalitarian quality of fairness is a peculiar mark of Dr Hewson's leadership. And<br />
they would create for the first time in Australian a genuinely and true underclass,<br />
which can only do to this country what similar policies have done to other<br />
countries.<br />
J: Mr Keating, are you expecting something of a blue yourself with the unions, the<br />
ACTU, over the employment prospects?<br />
PM: No. We had a very good discussion last night with the ACTU. I've said all I want<br />
to say to you today, I don't want you to ask me any more questions so I'm leaving.<br />
ends. </p>
