    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, should the top tax rate be cut to 30 per cent?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You're obviously talking about the stuff in 'The Oz' this morning. It's part of the Treasurer's job from time to time and at all times to keep getting information about what would be involved in doing this, that or the other with the tax system and that work and that information should be seen in that context.  What matters are Government decisions, and a result of Government decisions only three per cent of the Australian population will be on the top tax rate and that's pretty impressive by world standards.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did you know about Mr Costello's...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, Mr Costello, all the time is getting information and getting advice.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, the anti-terror legislation, you're only going to give Parliament about a day to review it, is that long enough?</p>
<p>   PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's not correct.  The Senate committee may only meet for a short period of time.  Parliament will have much longer than a day.  That is a complete misrepresentation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But the Senate committee will only have a day, why is that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The Senate committee can only have a short period of time, but that's a matter for the Senate and it will depend on procedure in the Senate.  But the essence of this legislation has already been approved by all State Governments, all State Governments, all of which I remind you are controlled by the Labor Party.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the last of the asylum seekers from Nauru are being brought to Australia.  Are you winding up the 'Pacific Solution' because there's been a problem with it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it's been a huge success.  The 'Pacific Solution', as you call it, has been integral to stopping the flow of illegal immigration to Australia.  The 'Pacific Solution' has been an outstanding success.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will it continue?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We will retain the option of having it if the need should arise in the future.  I hope it doesn't.  This Government has stopped illegal immigration and our measures have included the 'Pacific Solution' and without it and without the other measures we'd still have a problem.  It's been an outstanding success.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, what are your feelings on the journalists who will now have to front court on contempt of court charges?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>For a number of reasons I hope you understand I can't make any specific comment on that particular case.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
