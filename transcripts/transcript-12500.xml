<p> investigation</p>
<p>E&amp;OE........... </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like, on behalf of the Australian Government,</p>
<p> to welcome again to Canberra and Australia Ambassador Bob Zoellick, the</p>
<p> United States special trade representative.</p>
<p>The Australian-US relationship is very strong and very deep, not least</p>
<p> in trade and economic areas. And as you know over the past few months,</p>
<p> indeed, over a period of a couple of years there have been discussions</p>
<p> and some focus on the possibility of taking that relationship a major</p>
<p> step forward through the possible beginning of negotiations for an Australia-United</p>
<p> States free trade agreement.</p>
<p>This morning, along with my senior ministerial colleagues, we've had</p>
<p> an opportunity of talking about different dimensions of the trade and</p>
<p> economic relationship. Needless to say both of us and our two governments</p>
<p> remain very strongly committed to that relationship and doing everything</p>
<p> we can to make it even stronger. I'd like to invite Ambassador Zoellick</p>
<p> to say a few words and then we'll take a couple of questions.</p>
<p>ZOELLICK:</p>
<p>Well thank you, Prime Minister. And I just want to start by thanking</p>
<p> the Prime Minister for the honour of having a chance to meet him on this</p>
<p> visit. I know he's got a pretty hectic schedule. And when I opened my</p>
<p> conversation with him, but also with his Cabinet colleagues - and I'd</p>
<p> like to share this with the people of Australia - is the sense of extraordinary</p>
<p> sympathy the people of the United States have for the bombing in Bali.</p>
<p> We know that this was a tragic event for all of us but, frankly, Australia</p>
<p> took the hardest blow. We know what a sense of shock that it's created</p>
<p> here and it's something that we hope that we can work with you around</p>
<p> the world to eradicate it so it doesn't happen again.</p>
<p>I told the Prime Minister this morning that the President had authorised</p>
<p> me to send a letter to the Congress notifying that the United States would</p>
<p> like to begin free trade negotiations with Australia. So that letter was</p>
<p> just going up today to the Congress. Under the procedures we have, under</p>
<p> the trade promotion authority law we passed this summer, this requires</p>
<p> a 90-day notification before we can actually begin negotiations but we</p>
<p> look forward to doing that early next year. And I have talked with Minister</p>
<p> Vaile about trying to use the time in between to help with the preparations</p>
<p> and develop the terms of reference. We and I believe Australia is looking</p>
<p> for a comprehensive agreement. We believe this can do a lot for both economies</p>
<p> but as we discussed with the Prime Minister there are a lot of other economic</p>
<p> interactions here that will be beneficial. In terms of investment flows,</p>
<p> we both are very large investors in one another's country. Before I came</p>
<p> back to government I was in the financial sector and I know the international</p>
<p> business networks that are developing that Australian firms are part of</p>
<p> but I think we can draw closer ties through this free trade agreement</p>
<p> and we discussed some of those with the members of the Cabinet.</p>
<p>At the same time I think it's a wonderful combination that the primary</p>
<p> reason that I come to Australia was for a meeting that Minister Vaile</p>
<p> is hosting in Sydney dealing with the Doha negotiations, the WTO. We work</p>
<p> very closely with Australia to try to move those negotiations ahead. We</p>
<p> are committed to completing those by 2005. The date that we set last year</p>
<p> in Doha. Our trade promotion authority gives us some strength in doing</p>
<p> that. And, frankly, we've been very good allies in a topic that we both</p>
<p> like to try to be competitive in, although now and then we've got some</p>
<p> differences, which is agriculture. And I just want to thank the Minister</p>
<p> for the efforts that he's had working with this in the leadership of the</p>
<p> Cairns Group to try to move that forward.</p>
<p>The last point I just make is that one of the reasons I think this agreement</p>
<p> is important beyond the economics is the fact that Australia and the United</p>
<p> States have had a lot in common over the years but I remember while I</p>
<p> was out of government being part of a group called the Australian-American</p>
<p> Leadership Dialogue which was put together in January '92, actually, the</p>
<p> first idea, when I was here with President Bush's father. And the concept</p>
<p> was that with the passing of the World War II generation it was important</p>
<p> that the bonds between our countries remain strong, not only between governments</p>
<p> but between individuals and societies. And that's what that dialogue was</p>
<p> about and I hope that this free trade agreement can also help strengthen</p>
<p> the societal connections because this is, I think, my seventh or eighth</p>
<p> trip to Australia and I know it's a wonderful country, a good friend of</p>
<p> the United States and we hope to strengthen ties.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How confident are you that the hurdles and content rules can be [inaudible]</p>
<p> to achieve free trade in agriculture?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Can I first of all say that I';m delighted at the announcement that</p>
<p> the Ambassador has made. I want to pay particular tribute to him for his</p>
<p> personal investment of time and effort. As a Prime Minister, as a serving</p>
<p> politician of 29 years, I know the tensions and the challenges that frequently</p>
<p> exist between domestic considerations and broader national goals and imperatives</p>
<p> and their considerations. And it's a very important day in the relationship.</p>
<p> It's challenging but I enter it in a very determined fashion. I think</p>
<p> if we work hard we can pull it off. It won't be easy but we are very committed</p>
<p> to trying to bring about a favourable result because if we can achieve</p>
<p> this it will mean an enormous amount to both countries, it will be a further</p>
<p> strengthening element in an already very strong relationship. But a free</p>
<p> trade agreement between Australia and the largest economy in the world</p>
<p> will be of enormous long-term benefit and long-term strengthening for</p>
<p> the economic fabric of this country. Now, we all understand the competing</p>
<p> pressures, we've talked about them, but we also know that if they are</p>
<p> approached in a positive way, I mean, we're not going into this contemplating</p>
<p> that we're not going to pull it off. We're going into this because we</p>
<p> intend to work very hard to bring it about and it will be challenging,</p>
<p> it won't be easy but we do it in a very upbeat mood and we also do it</p>
<p> against the background of it having very high level commitments. And the</p>
<p> President's very committed to it, I';m very committed to it, my Cabinet</p>
<p> colleagues are very committed to it. And can I also say that each of our</p>
<p> countries has in the other excellent diplomatic representation. Michael</p>
<p> Thawley for us in Washington has already worked tirelessly and Tom Schieffer</p>
<p> for the President here in Canberra has done likewise. It will be important</p>
<p> over the months ahead that those in Australia that want this to be achieved,</p>
<p> they have to work hard and they have to speak up for it. And it will be</p>
<p> equally important for those in the United States who want this achieved,</p>
<p> will have to speak up for it. But I am conscious of the concerns and constituencies</p>
<p> in my own country as I know the President is in his but if you have the</p>
<p> commitment to it against the background of a belief in the importance</p>
<p> of the broader relationship I think we can pull it off and if we can we</p>
<p> will have done great service for future generations of Australians and</p>
<p> Americans.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is it feasible to have a complete free trade agreement between Australia</p>
<p> and the United States?</p>
<p>ZOELLICK:</p>
<p>Well as I mentioned to the Prime Minister, we';re trying to seek</p>
<p> a comprehensive agreement and the way we have approached free trade agreements</p>
<p> is we try to make them as absolutely broad as possible and that includes</p>
<p> agriculture, manufacturing, services. I just received a letter from about</p>
<p> ten American farm groups. They recognise that US farmers have some great</p>
<p> potential in terms of being able to sell in Australia. There are some</p>
<p> items we need to work through on both sides in that but in addition, as</p>
<p> my opening comments suggested, the United States and Australia are great</p>
<p> partners on some of the global issues because obviously agriculture is</p>
<p> particularly a case of global commodities. And so we don';t want</p>
<p> to shrink at the same time from working on trying to cut subsidies, cut</p>
<p> tariffs, remove export subsidies globally, and at the same time I think</p>
<p> we can open our bilateral markets.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Bearing in mind the long standing relationship with New Zealand [inaudible]</p>
<p> implications for New Zealand.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look this negotiation is a bilateral negotiation between Australia and</p>
<p> the United States and we are as always concerned and willing to look to</p>
<p> New Zealand';s interests where there is a capacity to do so and I';m</p>
<p> keeping in very regular contact with the New Zealand Government. There</p>
<p> is an acceptance on both sides of the Tasman that because there are some</p>
<p> different trade interests, I mean for example dairy bulks far more largely</p>
<p> in the New Zealand mind in any international negotiation than it would</p>
<p> for Australia. It';s necessary for us to keep in touch with each</p>
<p> other and have a close exchange of information, but also to recognise</p>
<p> that there is an Australia and United States bilateral dimension and there</p>
<p> is a New Zealand-United States bilateral dimension. But we will to the</p>
<p> maximum extent possible tick-tack with New Zealand, keep New Zealand informed</p>
<p> and do what we can consistent with our own objectives to assist New Zealand.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Desire by both governments to have comrpehensive [inaudible] will it</p>
<p> be a case of doing the easy bits first?</p>
<p>ZOELLICK:</p>
<p>Well one of the things I have learnt over time is not to negotiate with</p>
<p> journalists. And so what we';re trying to do, as I said, that we</p>
<p> sent up a letter to the Congress today. It';s about an eight page</p>
<p> letter. It notes the objectives by area that we are seeking and so that</p>
<p> letter will probably be available in Washington for people to take a look</p>
<p> at. In the nature of some of our other free trade agreements, what we</p>
<p> have tried to do is not only open markets, phase the opening as necessary</p>
<p> because we';re dealing with politics in both countries. But sometimes</p>
<p> we can also deal with other elements where we can develop closer economic</p>
<p> integration so we were talking with Peter Costello about some areas with</p>
<p> mutual recognition. There are some areas that are subject to different</p>
<p> regulatory authorities. So again what we see this as is we don';t</p>
<p> want to make the perfect enemy of the good. We want to have a good comprehensive</p>
<p> agreement covering agriculture, manufacturing, services, investment, intellectual</p>
<p> property. If you look at the way the United States has done these agreements</p>
<p> compared to other countries, they';re fulsome. But at the same time</p>
<p> we want to try to get this done, as I';ve mentioned, in President</p>
<p> Bush';s first term. We want to have political support in both countries</p>
<p> to get it done and frankly I see this as a building block to a stronger</p>
<p> economic as well as political relationship.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>â¦ comment on suggestions from some quarters that this breakthrough</p>
<p> on free trade is associated with the United States desire to maximise</p>
<p> Australia';s involvement in any action that might take place against</p>
<p> Iraq.</p>
<p>ZOELLICK:</p>
<p>Look this is a trade agreement and the best evidence I can give you of</p>
<p> this is that some of you know, I was interested in this idea in 1992 when</p>
<p> Iraq was in a slightly different situation. And again our goal is to try</p>
<p> to strengthen our economic ties bilaterally. As I mentioned, I think particularly</p>
<p> as two developed countries there are some opportunities here in terms</p>
<p> of investment and business networks and frankly information technology,</p>
<p> which would be increasingly important. I hope we can set some high standards</p>
<p> in that. At the same time, as I am proud to say, Australia is a good friend</p>
<p> to the United States and that means something to President Bush, it means</p>
<p> something to me. That';s not why we';re doing the trade agreement.</p>
<p> We';re doing it because we consider it to be in mutual interest.</p>
<p> But frankly I';m always proud to be in Australia. I consider Australia</p>
<p> a friend.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can I ask you about the situation in Bali and the investigation going</p>
<p> on there. Are you concerned about what happened yesterday with the head</p>
<p> of the investigation interviewing Amrozi in front of the media?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>My overriding goal, and I'm sure I speak particularly for the families</p>
<p> who've lost so much, their overriding goal would be to bring to justice</p>
<p> the people who committed this awful thing. To do that there needs to be</p>
<p> the maximum cooperation between the Indonesian police and the Australian</p>
<p> police and that cooperation is aided when there's the maximum public harmony</p>
<p> between the leadership of the Indonesian Government and the leadership</p>
<p> of the Australian Government. My advice to date is that cooperation has</p>
<p> continued. I thank the Indonesians for that. It's very important that</p>
<p> it do continue. I really feel very strongly that every effort has to be</p>
<p> explored and expended to find the people and bring to justice the people</p>
<p> who murdered so many of our fellow countrymen and women, and I don't want</p>
<p> to let anything or say anything to get in the way of that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Don't you think though that some of the families of the victims would</p>
<p> be fairly upset by what happened?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, nobody is more sensitive to the feelings, speaking in public life,</p>
<p> nobody is more sensitive than the feelings of those families that I'veâ¦</p>
<p> as you know, I've met many of them and I've spent a lot of time with them.</p>
<p> And I've begun to understand how they feel. I'm speaking, I know their</p>
<p> longer term aspiration and I don't really want to, at this stage, say</p>
<p> any more than that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What was your reaction to the confession and the clear lack of remorse</p>
<p> for the act?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I said at the beginning of this whole thing that I wasn't going</p>
<p> to give an operational commentary. I think it's a very bad thing for political</p>
<p> leaders to become acting chief superintendents and acting chief police</p>
<p> commissioners. I will leave commentary on the detail of the investigation</p>
<p> to the Australian Federal Police. They have told me that they're getting</p>
<p> very good cooperation from the Indonesian Police, that's what they've</p>
<p> told me, and I don't want to say anything more than that. I mean, in the</p>
<p> end what we all want is to get the people who did this and every effort</p>
<p> and every expression should be directed to that end.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, yesterday the concept of Australia negotiating a free</p>
<p> trade agreement with the United States was described as a mouse negotiating</p>
<p> with an elephant. Are you confident that there will be a net benefit to</p>
<p> Australians and that our cultural and intellectual property and so forth</p>
<p> can be protected?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the final detail of it has got to flow out of the negotiation.</p>
<p> But we are entering this negotiation enthusiastically and in a very dedicated</p>
<p> way because we believe that a fair free trade agreement negotiated between</p>
<p> our two countries will deliver very significant net benefits for this</p>
<p> country. I mean, people have talked about a figure of $4 billion annually,</p>
<p> as in addition to our GDP, perhaps more. And that's an enormous benefit.</p>
<p> But we wouldn't be starting the negotiation if we didn't believe that.</p>
<p> But I'm not going to pre-empt it anymore than the Ambassador has. The</p>
<p> negotiation, as always, will be tough and vigorous - that's the nature</p>
<p> of any these negotiations. But you wouldn't start if you didn't think</p>
<p> there were enormous benefits. And can I just in conclusion, I think we</p>
<p> probably have to terminate the conference, can I just again thank the</p>
<p> Ambassador for his great personal commitment. Can I also thank Mark Vaile.</p>
<p> Mark and the Ambassador have worked together very closely now over a significant</p>
<p> period of time and the fact that we're here today talking as we are is</p>
<p> more than anything due to the efforts and the interaction of those two</p>
<p> men. And I do want to record my gratitude to both of them.</p>
<p>ZOELLICK:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, if I can say anybody that's been at a negotiating table</p>
<p> with Mark Vaile may call him lots of things, but never a mouse.</p>
<p>VAILE:</p>
<p>Thanks, Bob.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
