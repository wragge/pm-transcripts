TALK TO THE NATION<br />
REDUCTION OF FORCES IN VIETNAM<br />
STATEMENT ON RADIO AND TELEVISION BY THE PRIME<br />
-MINST EK, 1KJJHTGORTDN 16 DECEMBER 1969<br />
Tonight I want to talk to you quite briefly on possible<br />
future developments in Vietnam.<br />
In my Policy Speech before the last election, I had this<br />
to say to the Australian people<br />
" Should there be developments ( in Vietnam) which result in<br />
plans for continuing reduction of United States Forces over<br />
a period, we would expect to be phased in to that programme."<br />
Since I spoke, developments have taken place, and you have today heard<br />
the announcement by the President of the United States that a further<br />
000 troops are to be withdrawn over the next few months.<br />
What has happened is that the President has judged that<br />
there has been more improvement in the military situation than he<br />
previously anticipated, and that the programme of training and arming<br />
Vietnamese troops to take over more and more combat duties has been,<br />
and is being, successful. It has therefore been possible for United States Forces<br />
to be reduced without endangering the objectives for which they, and we,<br />
entered the Vietnam war.<br />
The objectives remain. They are the objectives of<br />
attaining a just peace and of enabling the people of South Vietnam to<br />
live under a Government chosen freely by them, and chosen without the<br />
threat of terrorism or armed aggression from abroad.<br />
I am sure the President of the United States will never<br />
abandon these object ives and neither will we.<br />
But it appears the growing strength and confidence of<br />
South Vietnamese Forces will enable them to play a greater and greater<br />
part in attaining those objectives. If this proves to be true, it will lead<br />
to that continuing reduction of United States Forces of which I spoke in<br />
my Policy Speech. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Therefore I have spoken directly with the President of the<br />
United States, in accordance with arrangements made on my last visit,<br />
and we were in complete accord in agreeing in principle that should the<br />
future situation permit a further substantial withdrawal of troops, then<br />
some Australian troops should be included in the numbers scheduled for<br />
such reduction. Such agreement in principle is all that has been reached,<br />
or all that can at present be reached.<br />
Implementation of this arrangement can only occur in the light<br />
of future military developments in Vietnam and after full consultation and<br />
agreement with the South Vietnamese Governmen t and New Zealand.<br />
I expect that there will be much baseless speculation on these<br />
matters, and indeed there already has been. So I wish to make it clear<br />
That there is no firm timetable for further withdrawal of<br />
United States troops of which I know;<br />
That there is no timetable fixed covering at what stage any<br />
Australian reductions would be phased in to the next United<br />
States withdrawal;<br />
That there is no arrangement made as to how great any<br />
Australian reductions, which may take place in the future, will be.<br />
These are all matters for the future and dependent on future<br />
developments and those future developments cannot now be<br />
accurately forecast. But these things are sure<br />
" We will not unilaterally withdraw any of our forces<br />
" We will not abandon the objectives for which we entered the<br />
Vietnam war<br />
" We will participate in the next reduction of forces at some<br />
stage, when it comes. But the extent and timing of that<br />
participation remains to be settled in discussions between<br />
all the Governments concerned; and<br />
" We will not participate in any reductiorsof our own forces<br />
which in any way endanger those of our forces which remain.<br />
I am sure we will all be happy when the Vietnam war has reached<br />
a successful conclusion. I believe we should be happy that the South<br />
Vietnamese themselve s are able to take over more and more of the<br />
burden of the day. We will remaini to attain the objectives which we started<br />
out to reach. But we are glad we are able to make reductions without<br />
endangering those objectives.<br />
Goodnight. </p>
