FOR PRESS PM. No. 56/ 1971<br />
ECONOMIC CONSULTATIONS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr William McMahon<br />
The Government has been giving consideration to ways<br />
of improving the effec tieness of the periodicecorbmic consultations with<br />
representatives of industry and commerce. After obtaining the viewgt of<br />
participating organisations, it has been'deci-ded for the future to hold one<br />
longer set of consultations each year instead of the present practice of<br />
two meetings. It is intended that the annual consultations extend over<br />
three days so that more time will be available for discussion of issues<br />
of particular concern to organisations and to the Government. The<br />
Government believes that the new arrangements will increase significantly<br />
the usefulness of the consultations for all participants.<br />
Invitations have been extended for the next consultations<br />
which will be held from 7-9 July. On 7 and 8 July, Ministers will meet<br />
national organisations in three groups: primary industry, manufacturing<br />
industry, and commerce and mining. Also on 8 July, Ministers will<br />
meet with the Manufacturing Industries Advisory Council. On 9 July,<br />
meetings will be held with the Export Development Council and the<br />
Australian Council of Trade Unions.<br />
The organisations invited in the primary industry,<br />
manufacturing industry, and commerce and mining groups are shown<br />
