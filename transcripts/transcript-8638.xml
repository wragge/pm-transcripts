TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, TIlE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN SIIOVELAN, TIE WORLD TODAY, ABC RADIO<br />
27 AUGUST, 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
JS: Prime Minister, thanks for coming on Thc World Today. Despite the Budget, the<br />
Government is continuing to get a lot of bad press. Indced as we just heard, the<br />
Financial Review today is talking about the tide turning in favour of the<br />
conservatives. What's gone wrong? Do you think pcople out there aren't believing<br />
you any more?<br />
PM: Well, I think that's just a bit of press gallery navel gazing. These introspective<br />
pieces come and go frankly, they don't matter that much. I mean, if you look at the<br />
objective evidcnce, in the last week the Government has in fact narrowed in that<br />
poll, I think the Newspoll, the Government has actually narrowed thc lead with the<br />
Opposition.<br />
JS: But overall in terms of polls, you're still about the same distance behind the<br />
conservatives to what you were 12 or 18 months ago.<br />
PM: We're still within shooting distance of a victory. In difficult circums( anccs, but<br />
within shooting distance of a victory.<br />
JS: There has been a bit of a mood swing around the place though. I mean, only last<br />
week In the Parliament you had the Opposition members telling you to sit down.<br />
That's the sort of thing that would never have happened 12 months ago, 2 years<br />
ago, 3 years ago.<br />
PM: No, no, that always happens whenever people are on points of order. It's<br />
happened, I used to do it with Malcolm Fraser, other people are doing it today.<br />
JS: Yes, but they uscn't to dare to do it to you.<br />
90/ TOd-" 000N i: VT 6* 66n ' 2 </p>
<p>PM: Yes they have. I've had people doing it all last year and early this year. When one<br />
doe-sn't sit quickly on a point of ordcr they'll try to claim their rights. I don't think<br />
that's got anything to do if you're trying to read into that some sort of thing..<br />
Look, I was at thc Best Practice Program where we were handing out Best Practice<br />
Awards on Monday in Melbourne for the major Companies, BHP, the likes of DUi<br />
Ponts, Toyota, and thcy wcrc sitting up there at their tables with their employees<br />
from thc unions, and the Chicf Executives were coming up to us and saying, look<br />
Australia is now really on the verge of cracking it in terms of productivity, of<br />
making all the sort of ' 80s changes come good, of seeing it all conmc to fruition.<br />
And, you know, the people who are not onto that sort of play are the people who<br />
don't attend those sort of functions.<br />
JS-Is that the sort of reaction you think people are giving to the Budget?<br />
PM: I think the Budget reaction was pretty good. It was about Ik, it was about<br />
making Medicare stronger, fringe benefits for pensioners, 150 per cent for R&amp; D. I<br />
mcan, that got the big splash for newspapers, the TV that night, the next day. I<br />
mean, having a sort of sub debate in the Canberra columns about taxation doesn't<br />
have the impact, T don't think, in the public debate as the big presentations have.<br />
JS: Isn't there a big view out there in business, and generally in the community, that<br />
the momentum that you hoped that wasq going to be there in the Budget hasn't<br />
eventuated at all, and that those things have obviously impeded that.<br />
PM: I don't think the community and business arc looking for big momentums for<br />
Budgets. The average person who picks up the Daily Telegraph in Sydney on the<br />
train going to work, or the Sydney Morning Hcrald who wants to wrestle with a<br />
broadsheet, reads the Budget front page news, the big broad stuff, see it that night<br />
on television, then it basically has a very short shelf life and flips into history. I<br />
mean, I've done more of these than anyone in Australian politics, so I know more<br />
about Budget reactions and what one cail expect fromn them politically. And we<br />
got as much as we could get.<br />
JS: What about the money markets, the money markets have been particularly skittish.<br />
They seem to have, they certainly don't like the idea of the size of thc deficit and<br />
possibly the effect that that's having on our overall debt levels.<br />
PM: That's what you say, John. I don't think anyone in the markets would say the<br />
reason there's been, as you say skittishness, in markcts is about the Budget deficit.<br />
It's about terms of trade, it's about the US$ taking a battering, it's about the<br />
Bundesbank playing the mindless game of breaking European prosperity in the<br />
sort of quest for sort of German low inflation. That's what it's about.<br />
JS: Aren't they, though, undermining your attempts to try to get the economy going in<br />
the Budget to create jobs by tightenin&amp; monetary policy?<br />
qn/ zn* Aynn* otj zc: yi 7r,-6nH-jz </p>
<p>PM: We've got the things in place. Monetary policy is not tightening. It's not<br />
tightcning.<br />
JS: But interest rates are rising-<br />
PM: No they're not, it's not tightening. Look, we've got in place now the One Nation<br />
spending coming through. We just ordered 3 million tonncs of rail steel, a million<br />
concrete sleepers. $ 2 billion road programn $ 400 million more than last year.<br />
That's coming through, you've got the Budget spending coming through, you've<br />
got the labour market programs. We are setting the economy up on a growth path<br />
and we will grow as fast as our trading partners in the coming year that's around<br />
3 per cent, and as you know also in the public debate a lot of people think that's<br />
conservative. So that's what wc'rc about, wc'rc about growth and jobs and we're<br />
getting it.<br />
JS: But haven't we seen over the past 3 or 4 days interest rates slowly rising out there<br />
in the market place?<br />
PM: In the long term bond ratcs, on the long yields not the short yields.<br />
JS: Well is there any chance or any danger that they might just flow over into the<br />
housing market?<br />
PM: They go up and down. They were nearly 10 per cent 3 months ago, they dropped<br />
down into low 8s and they're now sort of high 8s. I mean, they shift around. but<br />
the short stuff hasn't shifted around.<br />
JS: So there's no danger in terms of your economic policy that what the markets are<br />
doing out there is undermining your economic policy at all?<br />
PM: No, no. Look, a budgct deficit of 3.3 per cent of GDP with Government debt to<br />
GDP one of the lowest in the OECD, the market would regard that as vcry<br />
acceptable.<br />
JS: Have interest rates hit the bottom of their cycle as far as<br />
PM: T7hat's a matter for judgment. But, basically I've comc on the program to talk<br />
about the Liberal's car policy.<br />
JS: But I couldn't let you come on and talk about that straight away, could I?<br />
PM: Well you could of if you got onto the topic of the day rather than navel gazing<br />
down the corridor here. Ile fact of the matter is, what we saw today was a<br />
revelation for Australians.<br />
IO n/ CnA't AtVON 70. ft1 7A,. 6nwHj7 ,-. IV3 1 </p>
<p>JS: Hang on, what you're talking about is the Opposition's policy to have 0-5 per cent<br />
tariffs by thc cnd of the decade, Now they're telling us that means $ 1000 less per<br />
car for Australians.<br />
PM: It says this, " Libs Tell Car Firms Revamp or Perish", front page of the Australian.<br />
It says this, ' Mr McLachlan says He got a question, ' do you honestly believe<br />
those companies can exist under those circumstances?' ' It's a matter for them to<br />
decide what changes they will need to make to exist'. In other words, we don't<br />
care. We're not saying, this is the Coalition, the Liberal Party, we're not saying we<br />
want a car industry and we'll keep it as Labor is saying. What he is saying is,<br />
basically they can either survive or perish, it's up to them, we're just going to bring<br />
the imports in, we're going to drop the barriers. I mean, that statement should send<br />
shivers through the city of Adelaide, it should send shivers through the city of<br />
Geelong, it should send shivers through the city of Melbourne. Here is the sort of,<br />
what you're seeing here is the sort of primitive capitalist ideal. That is, just rip all<br />
the barriers down and let them go to town. And on the %, cry same page as his<br />
question and answer is a story, " Ford Formalises; Exports to Japan", where Mr<br />
Nasser has just announced another 70,000 engine blocks going from Ford<br />
Australia to Japan, and where McLachlan himself is talking about the. success of<br />
the Labor Government's lxolicies in Il[ olden sending engines to Germany, Ford<br />
selling Capris to the United States and the Verada Wagons which are about to<br />
follow. In other words, the policies which arc working are ours but in the sort of<br />
naive primitive view of T-ewson and McLachlan, they'll just take this industry and<br />
rip it to shreds.<br />
JS: But he is offering things like abolition of pay roll tax etc which he says will add up<br />
to something like a cut in costs of around about $ 1,000 per car. Isn't his big<br />
mistake is that he hasn't solved, some people would say hasn't solved the need for<br />
some kind of revolutionary change?<br />
PM: John, use your brains. Look you take off pay roll tax and go to basically a zero<br />
-tariff on cars with the world with a glut of car production around the world where<br />
they can sell them at marginal cost into Australia, it will just wipe the floor with<br />
the Australian motor vcbicle industry. Dr Hcwson has attacked big business all<br />
this week and last week, he says big business, he accuses thenm of having an<br />
insidious relationship with the government dependent on hand outs. You see his<br />
view is that he hates big business because he doesn't sec thcem as self made, he sees<br />
himself as self made therefore they're to be opposed. Now hc's saying to BliP,<br />
who were at the Be-st Practice Awards the other day, he's saying to Toyota who's<br />
about to build a $ 400 million state of the art plant in Australia, he's saying to Ford<br />
which is now producing the top selling car, I know better than you, like I'm the<br />
sort of refugee from the financial market but I know better than you and the<br />
great success Labor has had in revamping and renovating and remodelling these<br />
industries basically look we'll throw it open to Imports and frankly if you<br />
survive that's really up to you, we couldn't care less.<br />
90/ t70d t700' ON Z2V Z6* 6flU2 :-11331 </p>
<p>JS: Are you sure that the Jack Nassers of this world arc going to say at the next<br />
election that they think that you and you're government should be rececctcd?<br />
PM: Well look, what thcy'vc said, let me just quote some people Mr Johnson from<br />
Toyota said " if he had known fully what the Coalition policy was his company<br />
may not have committed itself to a $ 420 million invcstnient". I'm going to Japan<br />
in a few weeks time, I'm seeing the Chairnian of the Toyota company Mr Toyota.<br />
What do I say to him? T7hat the alternative government of Australia would<br />
basically wreck his investment. Do I repeat what John IHcwson says when he goes<br />
abroad, that he's ashamed of Australia and Australians? That's what he says, I<br />
mean he is grossldy disloyal wherever he goes. He says rm ashamed of Australia,<br />
its lack of productivity, the attitude of Australians, I'm ashamed of them. I mean<br />
do I smy that? Or do I say to him look, we've got a policy which has taken motor<br />
vehicle protection from 150 per cent to 15, we think that you can live with that<br />
level, but if it goes to zero you get wiped out and the alternative government is<br />
going to wipe you out. I mean what do we say? Sec what McLachlan says today<br />
on the front page of the Australian he says " you arc all too motor industry<br />
orientated". The fact is the Motor industry is the base industry of Australian<br />
manufacturing. He says we have no interest in it, if it c-an survive against a flood<br />
of imports dumped from the excess production of thc northern hemisphere at<br />
marginal prices, well go for it fellas. If you can stay there great, but we'rc not<br />
going to make the claim that we want you there as L. abor says. Labor says, I say,<br />
we want a car industry. Hcwson and McLachlan say we don't care.<br />
JS: Just one quick one before you go Mr Keating, what's happened to your proposal to<br />
take to Cabinet about the flag? Is that Finished, is that buried?<br />
PM Well, I mean, everything in its turn and you know, at some point I will. But again,<br />
rm not going to be operated by someone else's agenda. I mean we are at the stage<br />
now in this country where we've got low inflation, low interest rates, where we're<br />
now very competitive, where we've got a revolution going on in ( he labour market)<br />
where all those Best Practice companies are turning out with inte~ rnational<br />
benchmarks, where we're now cxporting our heads off, where we shipping car<br />
engines around the world, fully built up vehiclcs like the Capri to the United<br />
States. This is unheard of, and yet these mindless zealots who for seven years in<br />
office, with Dr Hewson as an adviser, sat there and did nothing about it, there. now<br />
saying look you don't know best, the country is on the verge of blossoming in the<br />
as a low inflation productive environment as it never has before, but we know<br />
better, we'll rip the lot down, there'll be no support for industry what so ever and<br />
basically we'll let the northern hemisphere car makers and manufacturers rip the<br />
guts out of Australia. I mean if you live In Adelaide you ought to be scared stiff<br />
by this thing, I mean Mr McLachlan is a South Australian member he's going to<br />
basically decimate his own state and Dr Hcwson from the sort of lofty vantage<br />
point of Bellevue Hill, Sydney is going to wipe out the city of Geelong and<br />
Broadmcadows and half of Melbournc in a sort of mindless quest for primitive<br />
V~ OOOO* OONN Zi: V1 Z6' 56nUZZ1-13311 </p>
<p>capitalism, a sort of naive view that he has despitc the fact that the whole world<br />
has a different view.<br />
JS: Prime Minister, he must leave it there. Thanks for speaking to The World Today'.<br />
PM: Thank you John.<br />
