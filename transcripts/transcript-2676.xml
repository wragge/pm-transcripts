MACC ' UARIE NETWORK
BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
WILLIAM McMAHON, CH, MP<br />
URBAN AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT SEPTEMBER 1972<br />
Interviewer: Paul Lynch<br />
Q. With the announcement of your plan to set up the<br />
National Urban and Regional Development Authority, we have for<br />
the first time a clear programme from the Governiment to ease<br />
the strains of urbanisation in AustralIa which are considerable,<br />
I understand that you have a number of targets for this<br />
Authority. Coull you tell us what they arc, please?<br />
PM: I wouldn't like to call them targets. I doubt whether<br />
that is the correct term. But what we are doing is to promote<br />
two different concepts. The first one is what we call submetropolitan<br />
centres around existing cities and the second is<br />
the development of regional growth centres. what we will do is<br />
provide the finance to the States in order for these two concepts<br />
to be made a reality. Those are the concepts that we hope to<br />
achieve.<br />
Q. Sir, in foriving your plans for this, have you any<br />
figures in front of you in terms of foreign experience, of<br />
what has been achieved in countries such as the United Kingdom,<br />
which has tried this sort of thing?<br />
PM: Yes, we have had documents relating to overseas<br />
experience. That has not been the decisive factor with us.<br />
We want something that is peculiarly suited to Australian<br />
conditions, and so we hope to develop something that will be<br />
imaginative, that will secure a better quality of life for<br />
Australians and that will truly reflect the Australian environment<br />
and the 5pirit of the Australian people. ./ 2 </p>
<p>Q. The-New South Wales State. . Minister-for Decentralisation<br />
has suggested that initially, the Commonwealth Government will<br />
simply be co-ordi-nating--oth6 State Departments of Decentralisation.<br />
Would you accept that?<br />
PM. No, I don't. I don't think that is a correct concent.<br />
Naturally we want to have the closest co-ooeration with the<br />
States. This is essential. But what we will be doing is<br />
establishing the Authority itself that is the Regional and<br />
Urban Development Authority under an authority itself, and<br />
then, we will be developing feasibility studies and plans for<br />
the development of these areas, submitting them to the States for<br />
their approval, and if they are approved, we will provide finance.<br />
So it is not a co-ordination in that sense. It is a dramatic<br />
new initiative to improve the quality of life in Australia.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, this is, of course, a very large<br />
canvas on which something like this would be painted, and I<br />
imagine you will have considerable research to do before the<br />
first active steps are taken. What will you be studying?<br />
PM-That is why I have decided to appoint an Authority<br />
immediately and have the Act passed in the Parliament before<br />
the next break occurs at the end of another four weeks. We<br />
will require the authority to make recommendations to us.<br />
But there are two other organisations that are imoortant.<br />
The approvals will mainly be on the basis of Prime Minister/<br />
Premier relationships, and we will also establish a technical<br />
committee with the best brains that we can get in Australia<br />
to assist the Authority itself to develop plans for the new<br />
regional and urban centres.<br />
0. This could take a couple of years, I take it?<br />
PM: No, we will be starting work in the course of a few<br />
days, and I hope that Sir John Overall will be able to collect<br />
a staff around him and we will be getting to work fairly<br />
quickly. We want these plans developed as quickly as we can,<br />
and that is why we made the decision to bring down a statute<br />
immediately, to make it a reality and to let us get on with the<br />
job as quickly as we can.<br />
Q. A final point, Prime Minister. This could be seen as<br />
a Commonwealth intervention in a State area. What would your<br />
response to that be?<br />
PM: I wouldn't use the word " intervention". It will be<br />
Commonwealth/ State co-oneration in the best way that is<br />
practicable, and particularly designed to ensure that people<br />
have better standards of living, won't have the difficulties<br />
of travelling and will not have the problems associated with the<br />
isolation in big communities, or alienation in big communities,<br />
and we hope that this will permit individuals to develop their<br />
characters and their opportunities to the maximum. I don't regard<br />
it as in any sense interfering with the States It must be based<br />
on co-operation. Prime Minister, thank you very much. </p>
