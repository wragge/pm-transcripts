FOR PRESS: PM No. 124 1973<br />
ACCESS TO COMMONWEALTH ARCHIVES<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Commonwealth records that are 30 years old or more will, as<br />
from 1 January 1971, be available for scrutiny by the public. This policy<br />
will replace the " 50 year access rule" that has operated ir-the past.<br />
The 50 year rule was varied in 1966 to accelerate the release<br />
of World War I records. Currently, records originating prior to 1923<br />
are available publicly and records originating between then and 1939<br />
may be made available for preparation of important wvorks of scholarship.<br />
To facilitate study of the World War 11 period, the Government<br />
will also, as from 1 January 1971, allow accelerated release of records<br />
originating between I January 1941 and 31 December 1945 where they<br />
aze required for preparation of important works of scholarship.<br />
Some categories of records are regarded as not available for<br />
public access under current rules and will still be restricted under the<br />
new rules. Personal papers,, such as those relating to pensions, will not<br />
be released; nor will there be any release of taxation or census returns.<br />
Access to records relating to Australia's national security or affecting<br />
the Commonwealth's legal interests may also be restricted. Specific<br />
approvals will be required for release of Cabinet records.<br />
Custody of Commonwealth records and control over access<br />
to them is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Archives Office, which<br />
has headquarters in Canberra and branch offices in the mainland State<br />
capitals. In Canberra, the Off ice occupies temporary buildings adjacent<br />
to Kings. Avenue Bridge. The Government has decided in principle to erect<br />
a new National Archives building in Canberra which will be the headquarters<br />
of the Commonwealth Archives Office and to which important Commonwealth<br />
records will be transfet red for preservation, public study and display.<br />
The design and siting of the building will be a matter for subsequent<br />
consideration. CANBERRA December 1970 </p>
