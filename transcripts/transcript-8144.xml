IL.. . LIU<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA25 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
The Commonwealth has received a request from the New South<br />
Wales Government ( a copy of which is attached) to defer the<br />
Federal Government'Is consideration of the State Government'Is<br />
proposal on the South East forests of NSW until 8 October<br />
1990. The Commonwealth was preparing to consider the NSW proposal<br />
this week, in accordance with its public undertaking to do<br />
so. The Government is very conscious of the legitimate<br />
expectation in the industry that decisions be made as<br />
quickly as possible.<br />
In view of the NSW Government'Is request, however, I have<br />
decided, in consultation with relevant Ministers, to hold<br />
over Cabinet consideration.<br />
I wish to emphasise that the Commonwealth will accede to no<br />
further reaquests f or delay f rom any quarter.<br />
The issue will be discussed by Federal Cabinet on 2 October,<br />
with a view to f inal decisions being made absolutely no<br />
later than the date nominated by the NSW Government of 8<br />
October. 67&gt; </p>

The Hon R. J Hawke AC MP<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Parliament House<br />
CANBERRA Dear Prime Minister SOUTH EAST FOREST / CONSIDERATION BY FEDERAL CABINET<br />
I presume to wrrite to you in the absence of my Premier, Hon<br />
Nick Greiner MP, following a discussion Mr Grei. ner and I had<br />
on Saturday last concerning the time of consideration by both<br />
governments of the possibity of an agreed resolution to issues<br />
in the South East forest of New South Wales.<br />
As you will be aware, Mr Greiner, is at present in the<br />
Peoples Republic of China and endeavours are being made to<br />
have him contact you to confirm the New South Wales government<br />
view that the original timetable for governmental<br />
consideration of these issues on Monday 8 October being agreed<br />
upon by the four Ministers should be adhered to.<br />
I understand that requests have been made by the Director of<br />
the New South Wales Cabinet Office, Mr Sturgess, to senior<br />
officers of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet<br />
indicating Mr Greiner's wish that consideration of the matter<br />
should be deferred to accord with the original timetable.<br />
In the absence of the Premier, and as the senior New South<br />
Wales Minister involved in these negotiations, I write to<br />
confirm that there is not, at this time, a formal New South<br />
Wales submis~ iion to be considered by your government and the<br />
New South Wa. Les government has a view that these issues can<br />
only be resolved satisfactorily if all four Ministers can<br />
agree on the above submission and both governments have<br />
simultaneous consideration of it.<br />
I would therefore request deferring the Federal Government's<br />
consideration of this issue until 8 October 1990.<br />
Your sincerely,<br />
TIM MOORE<br />
MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT<br />
