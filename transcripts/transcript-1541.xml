ASIAN TOUR 1967 LA OS<br />
PRESS CONFE2RENCE GIVEN BY TIM PRIMEl MINISTER,<br />
MR. HAROLD HOLT AT VIENTIANE 2ND~ APRIL, 1967<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
There will be a joint coiimnunique released by the<br />
Prime Minister of Laos and myself, the terms of which we<br />
agreed on. That will be distributed to you later, maybe<br />
by the time we finish here.<br />
I don't know that I need to go into detail on it<br />
because it deals with a number of items which you would<br />
predictably expect to find in this communique the fact<br />
that we had a very frankc and friendly exchange of views on<br />
the situation in Laos and on international questions of<br />
common interest, this was particularly the case of course<br />
in our discussions in the Cabinet Room, althoujgh I have had<br />
opportunities additional to that of talking with the Prime<br />
Minister and also some very interesting discussions a little<br />
earlier today with His Majesty -the King, who of course keeps<br />
himself very fully informed on all that is happening inside<br />
his own country. In the Commiunique you viill find the Prime Minister<br />
expressing feelings of gratitude of the Lao Government and<br />
people for the positive and constructive aid given by Australia<br />
and in particular its substantial contribution to the<br />
maintenance of the stability of the KIP.<br />
One aspect which has interested me very much while here<br />
has been to learn how vital to the economic wellbeing of the<br />
country and its capacity to engage in work of development<br />
is the stability of this currency fund or the stability<br />
of the currency assisted by this fund to which Australia is<br />
one of a group of contributors. At a distance it is not<br />
easy to understand why so much importance was attached to<br />
this in this country but both the Prime Minister and the King<br />
are emphatic that this is vital to the wellbeing of the nation<br />
at this time, although of course they hope that, notwithstanding<br />
the state of war which is being imposed on them by a foreign<br />
country and part of their territory being held in enemy hands,<br />
they still aspire to exploit the natural resources of the country<br />
in order to become progressively self-sufficient.<br />
And the Prime Minister of Laos reaffirmed in conclusion<br />
in the Communique the policy of neutrality which the Royal<br />
Government desires to pursue in accordance with the Geneva accords<br />
of 1962. There is, perhaps, an aspect of the Communique which<br />
I might elaborate to a degree for you because it will, I think-,<br />
amplify what Ii~ aid very briefly last night when speaking about<br />
what has come to be known as the new colonialism. The process<br />
of support, whether defence support or of economic assistance,<br />
which some free world countries have given to those under<br />
threat or actual aggression, the economic assistance which they<br />
have given them in order to better their way of life, has become<br />
I* course and understandably an object of attack by those who<br />
hold a very different philosophy and who see the future of the<br />
world in very different terms from those which we hope for<br />
ourselves. .0 0/. 2. </p>
<p>-2<br />
But all the propaganda seems to me to run the one<br />
way, and I think it not inappropriate, and certainly it could<br />
fittingly be said in this country, that the interpretation<br />
which we in Australia, and I believe, people of good will<br />
everywhere, place on these processes of military support and<br />
economic aid that interpretation can take in reality and in<br />
all sincerity a very much more commendable aspect.<br />
Nowi I can illustrate that in relation to this country<br />
and as from Australia. Such aid as Australia gives is given<br />
without any conditions attached. We make no loans any funds<br />
we make available are made available by way of grant, they<br />
require no obligations on the part of those who receive the aid.<br />
And you may well ask has not Australia some self-interest in this<br />
nmatter, as indeed other countries which give their aid either<br />
the military kind or of an economic kind. And of course we have<br />
a self-interest in this sense, that we are looking towards a<br />
world order in the future.<br />
The progress towards that may be painstakingly slow,<br />
and at times difficult. VWe may have our setbacks but if we are<br />
working together for that better world order, then those of us<br />
who are more favourably placed by reason of a wealth of natural<br />
resources or the prosperity we have managed to create ourselves,<br />
if wie can give assistance along the road to better standards and<br />
greater security to others, then not only are we able to do<br />
something useful and indeed valuable and helpful fox' them, but<br />
we are helping to build the better kind of world in which I<br />
believe most people in the world today, certainly people of<br />
good will and of thoughtfulness, wish to see established.<br />
Here is a country in w~ hich vie find, as I said last<br />
night, both the ravages of nature and the ravages of man<br />
which have held back its development and the standards of its<br />
people. It is led by men of intelligence and courage. But<br />
its progress will be painfully slow unless it can look to others<br />
to help botn in securing its national integrity and identity<br />
but also in enabling it to make better progress along the road<br />
to a better standard of life.<br />
This is a very strong reaction which has developed<br />
within me as I studied, even in the brief time here, the<br />
circumstances of' this country, have pondered over what we<br />
and others are trying to do to help and have thought of this<br />
against the background of these propaganda attacks. The new<br />
colonialism, I would allege, is the policy line which denies<br />
the underdeveloped countries of the world means of a modern<br />
techinological assistance which would have them chained to the<br />
age-old enemies of mankind down through the ages, of ill-health,<br />
disease, illiteracy, poverty, lack of' national security,<br />
instability in a financial sense these are things which so<br />
many people of the world have had to live with down through<br />
the centuries, and those who are charged today with being<br />
neo-colonialists are, with good will and of sincere purpose,<br />
trying to improve this situation. So I must throw back in the<br />
teeth of those of the propagandists their charge. They are<br />
the people who, by denying these opportunities and this security,<br />
would be keeping chained to the past, not merely a colonial past<br />
of a superior power, but a colonialism in the sense of these<br />
deficiencies of the past the ill-health, the illiteracy and<br />
these other matters of which I have spoken.<br />
Now, you wouldn't expect me in two brief days here<br />
to attempt to comment, nor would it be proper for me to do so,<br />
about domestic matters of this country, but there may be sorie<br />
other matters you would like to put to me by way of questions,<br />
and I invite you to do so. o/ 3&amp; </p>
<p>-3<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, do you think that your two days her'e<br />
have brought home to you the need for action to correct these<br />
deficiencies? That means do you see a need for Australia to do<br />
more about it, and so are we going to do so?<br />
P. M. Australian aid has taken particular forms which have<br />
been sought of use by the Government here and I stress the fact<br />
that this particular kind of aid is helping to keep the currency<br />
strong we regard as of vital importance. As you will be aware<br />
Australia has an aid programme which extends over many countries,<br />
some of the Colombo plan countries and others who are not covered<br />
by the Colombo plan.<br />
Contrary to the experience in several other aid-giving<br />
countries of the world, our aid donation is on a rising curve,<br />
where as it has either been relatively static or has tended to<br />
recede in some of the industrialised countries which have been<br />
looked to as large aid givers. So that Australia can rightly<br />
claim that, considering that w., e have our own problems of<br />
developing the continent, that today we have a substantial<br />
contribution to make to security problems of the area and actually<br />
double our defence programme over the period of the l--st four years,<br />
that we ourselves are still a capital importing country.<br />
The fact that -we rank amongst the first four or five<br />
countries of the world in per capita aid giving, I think establishes<br />
our good faith. Just what total provision vie shall be making for<br />
aid in the period immediately ahead will be resolved when -we come<br />
to consider the other requirements of the Budget. But wie shall be<br />
doinc, what wie can to help this and other countries who have been<br />
in receipt of aid from us.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, I wonder if you like to say, on the<br />
results of your visit, your trips thus fa-r, if you see co-operation<br />
between Australia and the countries of South East Asia extending<br />
from aid and economic ties into the political field?<br />
P. M. . Well, there are some instru~ mentalities of course already<br />
in existence which enable close co-operaction in various fields.<br />
There is ASPAC, there is a kind of co-operation which a group of<br />
us evidenced at the Manila Conference, there is the positive economic<br />
development which the countries who are covered in the scope, either<br />
as contributors or as beneficiaries, of the Asian Development Bank.<br />
These are all, I believe, significant developments<br />
occurring over a comparatively short period of time. And I find<br />
a growing disposition on the part of leaders of governments in<br />
the countries of this area. to work more closely together to build<br />
friendships one . iith the other. Whether they are of one pa-rticular<br />
school of thought, or whether they belong to a particular grouping<br />
of nations in their foreign policies, or whether, as in the case of<br />
Cambodia and Laos, they are countries whose neutrality has become<br />
internationally recognised, there is still amongst them all this<br />
disposition to co-operate more closely together.<br />
Just what forms that takes will vary and in some of<br />
the directions I have mentioned. It may be there is roori for<br />
others. We have yet to see for example, clearly what will emerge<br />
in Indonesia, and I would expect it, with the very rapid and quite<br />
dramatic growith of the trade of Japan that Japan would be found<br />
taking a more active role in political developments in the area. </p>
