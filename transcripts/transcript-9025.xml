TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, SUNDAY,<br />
7 NOVEMBER 1993<br />
E&amp; OIE PROOF COPY<br />
PM. I just want to give you some comments on Dr Hewson's performance<br />
with Laurie Oakes on the ' Sunday show this morning. It is the weakest<br />
and most helpless performance that I have seen a parliamentary<br />
leader put in in my 24 years in the House of Representatives in public<br />
office. Dr Hewson made clear that he does not have any policy on<br />
Mabo despite the fact that he has released policy documents that<br />
native title is at the core of Coalition policy, upholding the High Court<br />
decision is at the core of Coalition policy, he said. Now that policy has<br />
no status, it hasn't been through the Shadow Cabinet, it means nothing<br />
and even when questioned about It being a set of principles he<br />
demurred saying It was really for anyone to say what they thought of it.<br />
Now, all this means, I think, is that Dr Hewson is so weakened, he<br />
can't now put down as he should, Ian McLachlan for walking away from<br />
what has been the Coalition's stated position now since June. I think<br />
that is because Dr Hewson is relying on Western Australian<br />
parliamentary Liberals. The related theme through this is of course,<br />
that Richard Court is contemplating the most unconscionable<br />
extinguishment of private land titles in this country's history. This is<br />
the party that believes in the rule of law, In private property. It has now<br />
said that the High Court should be chastised, that the High Court<br />
should be reformed, that the High Court is a social experimentation<br />
place and on private property they are prepared to rush in and use the<br />
powers of the West Australian parliament for the most blatant<br />
extinguishment of private property ever. Dr Hewson should, as a<br />
position of principle, come out and say he would have no bar of that,<br />
that he would protect the centrality of the High Court's judgement<br />
about terra nullius, but today he made clear that while he could<br />
understand native title applying to the Merian Islands, he couldn't see;<br />
he said he had reservations about how it would apply to the mainland<br />
of Australia, God help us after all this time. He then went on to say </p>
<p>2<br />
that Mabo was a major issue facing this country well, of course it is Dr<br />
Hewson, that is why It requires a principled policy position, that is why<br />
the Government has spent the better part of a year on it to give effect<br />
to and build a body of administrative law for the hearing, awarding and<br />
protection of native title and not to see it squandered or worse, to<br />
connive In Its extinguishment with an unprincipled government in<br />
Western Australia.<br />
All of this means that Dr l-ewson can't deal with his leadership; he<br />
can't discipline Mr McLachlan who is way out of court with the Federal<br />
Parliamentary Liberal party; Dr Hewson would know that the great<br />
body of the Federal Parliamentary Liberal party does believe the High<br />
Court did as every other similar group of jurors around the world have<br />
done and that Is found that these concepts such as terra nullius are<br />
void and that, of course, a native title has existed in the common law<br />
and having had the decision made should join with the Government in<br />
seeing it protected. He hides behind this ruse that the he hasn't seen<br />
the Government's Bill, but he has seen the High Court decision since<br />
June 1992. He has had now all that time to make a decision about the<br />
core principle, which you don't need the Government's Bill to establish<br />
and that is, whether native title should be protected or not.<br />
The fact Is here there are big issues here for the Liberal party. This<br />
view that you can't give Aboriginal people In this country inherent right,<br />
only a conferred right, that if you have the chance you should lunge<br />
out and try and extinguish their rights to private property of course,<br />
never for a moment considering that every other Australian should say,<br />
well, how sacred are my rights to private property If any Liberal<br />
government believes It could extinguish any category of persons<br />
private property in this country. And yet, Dr H-ewson won't draw the<br />
principal threads together and state his position, stand McLachlan<br />
down, put Reith in his place and adopt a position of principle In the<br />
Parliament on this important question of native title. Dr Hewson is<br />
running the same line, essentially he ran weeks ago that is, that<br />
everybody In the Liberal party Is entitled to carry the leaders baton in<br />
the knapsack and that virtually the more contestants there are the<br />
merrier, but in his case he is all right. But the fact is, of course, it has<br />
lead him to be completely powerless and helpless. He is now like a<br />
cork bobbing around in the ocean, pushed and shoved by any force,<br />
any Influence which comes from this week to that and particularly not<br />
In any way being able to cope with the big issues of principle facing<br />
Australia and not showing any leadership whatsoever.<br />
J: But do you think his leadership is seriously under threat?<br />
PM: I think, any parliamentary Liberal looking at that program this morning<br />
would despair they know his leadership is finished.<br />
J: Where is the threat coming from? </p>
<p>PM: it is coming everywhere. It comes most particularly from him, because<br />
he won't display any leadership.<br />
J: But who will take over, will Bronwyn Bishop?<br />
PM: Fortunately, that is not for me to worry about.<br />
J: I presume Mr Keating, that you are not going to put him out of his<br />
misery by bringing on the Mabo legislation as soon as possible?<br />
PM: The Mabo legislation will be introduced when we have the Bill written<br />
as accurately and as securely as we can we will then introduce it.<br />
J: You don't have a date yet for the introduction?<br />
PM: No, It will probably be around the 16th or 17th of November as I said.<br />
J: Was the legal advice received from Atorney-General's that Richard<br />
Court's legislation could be valid?<br />
PM: I am not basically here to debate the whys and wherefores of Richard<br />
Court's legislation. Simply to say this, that what the Court Government<br />
is doing is unconscionably seeking to extinguish a proprietary right for<br />
an unspecified, undesignated so-called set of native title rights, only to<br />
be expressed whenever there is a dispute and when they are wiped<br />
out, Aboriginal people have a year to argue for compensation, but how<br />
would they argue for compensation when they could never know<br />
wh~ ether they were in fact the native title owners in the first place.<br />
J: How can the Commonwealth's legislation be Imposed In West<br />
Australia, Mr Court's legislation is valid, don't you have a problem on<br />
that front?<br />
PM: The Commonwealth has primacy in this area and it will assert It without<br />
fear or favour. And can I say, that also as an aside here, the mining<br />
industry has got to stand up here and decide what it wants. It was<br />
telling us, remember all the Wik carry on about how titles before 1975<br />
had to be validated, there is no such validation in the West Australian<br />
legislation whatsoever for any titles before 1975, yet they are saying<br />
in their press release that yes, they think this Bill fits the bill with the<br />
mining industry. It would provide absolute chaos in Western Australia,<br />
total uncertainty and the one thing which the mining industry has<br />
always said was its first requirement, that is, to be able to validate the<br />
titles. Look, the core matter here Is this, this is a matter as Dr Hewson said<br />
this morning a major issue and principle for the country. The<br />
Opposition is now without a policy, after all this time Dr Hewson has </p>
<p>told us this morning that the policy that he announced in June which<br />
said the Coalition accepts that the High Court has determined that<br />
native title exits he Is now running away from saying it has no<br />
status, that it has not been through the Shadow Cabinet and it has no<br />
party room support. Right at this moment, the Coalition of the country,<br />
the conservative parties have no position on the question of native title<br />
or its preservation that is just an appalling disgrace.<br />
J: Is this the issue that is going to bring down Dr Hewson do you think?<br />
PM: It they are big enough they are too hot for Dr Hewson to touch.<br />
Wherever he goes, if It Is on Issues like the republic he meets on the<br />
right Mr Howard, if it is on Mabo he runs into the West Australian<br />
Liberals in the likes of Mr McLachlan. He won't make a stand<br />
anywhere and the thing about leadership it is all about making a<br />
stand around principle something that Dr Hewson doesn't<br />
understand, that his leadership flows from his own strength and that he<br />
hasn't displayed any. Thank you.<br />
