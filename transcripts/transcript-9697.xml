JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING<br />
MP AND THE MINISTER FOR VETERANS' AFFAIRS, THE HON CON<br />
SCIACCA MP<br />
AUSTRALIA REMEMBERS PRISONERS OF WAR<br />
Federal Cabinet has agreed to exempt Australian ex-prisoners of war who are<br />
receiving nursing home care from the cost of nursing home resident<br />
contributions. This decision is a special initiative to mark the Australia Remembers<br />
commemorative year, and to recognise the unique sacrifice made by the<br />
6,600 living Australian veterans who were prisoners of war while on<br />
operational service.<br />
The exemption will apply from 1 November this year, and will mean initially<br />
that about 250 former prisoners of war who are currently residents of nursing<br />
homes will be relieved of the financial burden associated with their nursing<br />
home care.<br />
The recent commemorative trip to Borneo highlighted the appalling<br />
experiences which were endured by some war prisoners. Their suffering was<br />
both physical and psychological. Their privations were profound.<br />
Former prisoners of war, including their passionate advocate Mr Tom Uren,<br />
have campaigned for a long time for this particular form of recognition, and<br />
the Government is pleased to agree to it during the fiftieth anniversary of the<br />
end of World War Two.<br />
