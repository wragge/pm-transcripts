FOR PRESS: PM. No. 3/ 96<br />
CABINET DISCUSSIONS WITH MR. BOWDEN<br />
The Australian Cabinet today held discussions with the Secretary<br />
of State for Commonwealth Affairs, Mr. Bowden, on a wide range of<br />
current topics. Among the items discussed were the Kennedy Round, British<br />
moves towards entry into the Common Market, British Defei ce policy, Viet<br />
Nam and Rhodesia. In introducing Mr. Bowden to Cabinet, Mr. Holt explained that<br />
the meeting offered an opportunity for the Australian Cabinet to hear first<br />
hand the views of the British Government on the current issues of concern<br />
to both of them. The meeting did not have as its purpose negotiation on<br />
any mattet. The Australian Ministers were particularly interested in the<br />
background of Britain ' s present moves towards Europe and Mr. Wilson's<br />
recent efforts to help with negotiations on Viet Nam. It was agreed that<br />
the two Governments would continue to keep in the closest contact ai these<br />
questions. Recent developments on the Rhodesian problem were also<br />
discussed in detail, and the Prime Minister noted that Mr. Bowden was<br />
specially qualified in this question. Although the position of the Australian<br />
Government remained that it continued to regard Rhodesia as a matter<br />
primarily for the British Government, the matter held vital implications for<br />
the Commonwealth, and a continuing exchange of views was essential to<br />
help in resolving the issue.<br />
The Australian Government expressed appreciation to Mr. Bowden<br />
for the continuing British military presence in South East Asia. Australia,<br />
New Zealand and British collaboration had been an important element in<br />
bringing stability to this area. A history of effort going back to the days of<br />
the Communist insurgency in Malaya had produced working arrangements<br />
which made the Commonwealth effort an integral part of the defence of the<br />
region. Arrangements for the Australian feasibility study in respect of<br />
Cockburn Sound Naval Support Facility are proceeding and will take into<br />
account possible British use of the facilities in certain contingencies.<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Holt, expressed appreciation for<br />
Mr. Bowden's visit stating that, while it was customary for a Secretary of<br />
State for Commonwealth Affairs to visit Commonwealth countries, it was<br />
a matter of considerable importance to us that Mr. Bowden, with his close<br />
knowledge of Commonwealth problems and grasp of international issues of<br />
special significance for Australia should visit us at this time when issues<br />
of such moment were before both Governments.<br />
