    <content><![CDATA[<p>Families in the Northern Territory are among the big winners from this year's Federal Budget, with more than 15,700 local families set to receive the Gillard Government's new Schoolkids Bonus and about 18,000 local families to get a boost in their family payments from next year.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard today visited Wagaman Primary School in Darwin to talk with local families about the extra support. </p>
<p>The Schoolkids Bonus will provide $410 a year for each child in primary school and $820 a year for each child in secondary school and will replace the Education Tax Refund.</p>
<p>Parents will get their first payment in June this year and from next year the Schoolkids Bonus will be paid in two separate instalments  -  before the start of Term One and Term Three.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government knows that with kids in school, balancing the family budget can be tough.</p>
<p>We want to make sure that the extra money for school costs is paid upfront when parents need it most, with no more extra paperwork at tax time.</p>
<p>The budget also included increases to family payments for Northern Territory families to help with the cost of living.</p>
<p>From July next year, about 18,000 local families who receive Family Tax Benefit Part A will receive a boost of up to $600 extra a year to help them make ends meet.</p>
<p>We know that not everyone is experiencing the benefits of the mining boom and many are struggling to keep up with living costs.</p>
<p>The extra assistance for families announced in the Budget is on top of the money the Government is already providing through the Household Assistance Package.</p>
<p>More than 19,300 Northern Territory families started receiving extra money in their bank accounts from yesterday, as part of the Household Assistance Package.</p>
<p>Families receiving Family Tax Benefit Part A will receive up to $110 per child, and families on Family Tax Benefit Part B will get up to an extra $69.</p>
<p>This extra money will help families keep up with the cost of living now and over the coming months.</p>
<p>And next year, the regular payments that local families receive will go up for good.</p>
