<p>Your Excellency, the Premier of South Australia, John Olsen, to my</p>
<p> ministerial colleagues, Senator Nick Minchin, Sir Arvi Parbo the Chairman</p>
<p> of the Board, Mr Hugh Morgan the Managing Director, the leader of</p>
<p> the South Australian Opposition, Mr Wran, other colleagues, ladies</p>
<p> and gentlemen.</p>
<p>In coming here today to open the Olympic Dam extension I wanted to</p>
<p> demonstrate first and foremost the very strong commitment of the Federal</p>
<p> Government to the mining industry in this country. Providing about</p>
<p> $41 billion of export income the mining sector is still the major</p>
<p> contributor to the export earnings of Australia. The mining industry</p>
<p> at present in Australia operates in quite a challenging environment.</p>
<p> Although the domestic economy is strong inflation is low, interest</p>
<p> rates are the lowest they have been for decades, industrial disputes</p>
<p> are at record low levels and we have been operating for several years</p>
<p> under an exchange rate regime which has been administered in a way</p>
<p> to promote and not retard the international competitiveness of the</p>
<p> Australian economy. It is nonetheless the case that world commodity</p>
<p> prices are very low and as such the export environment because of</p>
<p> that is very challenging. And it is therefore all the more welcome</p>
<p> to me as Prime Minister and to the Federal Government generally that</p>
<p> WMC continues to make such an enormous investment in mineral development</p>
<p> and mineral exploration in this country.</p>
<p>And I want on behalf of the Government to thank that company for the</p>
<p> faith that it's shown in Australia's economic strength and</p>
<p> Australia's economic future. I want to thank it for the contribution</p>
<p> that it's made over the years to the export earnings of our nation.</p>
<p> And I also in issuing those thanks want to particularly thank the</p>
<p> workforce of the company. Mining is not the easiest of vocations.</p>
<p> It has its challenges, it has its depravations, it has its difficulties,</p>
<p> it still, despite the enviable safety record of this company, also</p>
<p> has its dangers. And there are aspects of mining that many other sections</p>
<p> of the Australian community would not readily embrace. And I do want</p>
<p> to record my admiration for the miners of Australia, my admiration</p>
<p> for the employees and the managers of Western Mining for the remarkable</p>
<p> contribution that you have made to the development of the minerals</p>
<p> sector in Australia and the remarkable contribution you have made</p>
<p> to the economic strength of this country.</p>
<p>It is important that we provide uncompromising support to the mining</p>
<p> industry in this country. It is possible to strike a balance between</p>
<p> caring for our environment and sensibly exploiting the mineral deposits</p>
<p> of Australia. We have been given by providence a remarkable store</p>
<p> of mineral deposits. There is no nation on earth that has been as</p>
<p> fortunate as Australia in that respect and we would be very negligent</p>
<p> not only to ourselves but also to future generations if we allowed</p>
<p> obsessions with other things as distinct from the reasonable advocacy</p>
<p> of other things to deny us the rational and sensible and careful exploitation</p>
<p> of the mineral reserves of this nation. A strong mining sector provides</p>
<p> not only tens of thousands of jobs in its own right but through downstream</p>
<p> processing and the contribution it makes to the manufacturing industry</p>
<p> of Australia, it provides hundreds of thousands of jobs. It provides</p>
<p> wealth to its shareholders. And I'm very proud of the fact that</p>
<p> Australia is now second only to the United States as the greatest</p>
<p> share-owning democracy in the world. And it's a very, very proud</p>
<p> thing that you have a nation that has so many shareholders and I want</p>
<p> more shareholders. And if we have our way and we get a few people</p>
<p> crossing the floor in our Upper House we might have a lot more shareholders</p>
<p> in Australia.</p>
<p>But it is a tremendous day. And it's right that Arvi pays tribute</p>
<p> to the customers. No business works without customers. No business</p>
<p> prospers without customers. And looking after your customers and keeping</p>
<p> them satisfied is a tremendously important element of any industry.</p>
<p> So I want to congratulate all of those people who have been associated</p>
<p> with Roxby Downs from its beginning.</p>
<p>I, along with Sir Arvi and John Olsen and others, went down and had</p>
<p> a look at that remarkable engineering feat which is this operation</p>
<p> here. And it's the first time I've had the opportunity of</p>
<p> visiting this particular site, and I really did find it quite a remarkable</p>
<p> engineering feat. And Arvi remarked on a number of occasions how different</p>
<p> it was from when he started in the mining industry in Germany some</p>
<p> 50 years ago. And, indeed, mining has changed. It's become more</p>
<p> sophisticated. It's become more productive. But there's</p>
<p> still an ethos in the mining industry that binds the men and women</p>
<p> of that industry together in a particular fashion.</p>
<p>So to all of you who are associated with this opening today, the company,</p>
<p> the employees, the customers, the townspeople of this area, and I</p>
<p> had the opportunity of meeting some of the school children and I was</p>
<p> told by their headmaster that they had all been there for just on</p>
<p> ten years and they've had an association, a living association,</p>
<p> with the mining industry and the development of this great resource.</p>
<p>Before I conclude there is one other thing that I want to say, and</p>
<p> because it is the last public mining occasion of this character that</p>
<p> Arvi Parbo will be present at as he will retiring as Chairman of the</p>
<p> Board of WMC, I want to pay a special tribute as Prime Minister to</p>
<p> Arvi for the enormous contribution that he has made, not only to this</p>
<p> company but he has made to Australian industry and to Australia generally.</p>
<p> I can't think of a single Australian who better epitomises the</p>
<p> post-world war achievement of this country. Our capacity to absorb</p>
<p> in a harmonious and positive way millions of people from all around</p>
<p> the world. Arvi came to Australia via Germany from his native Estonia</p>
<p> almost 50 years ago. He couldn't speak a word of English when</p>
<p> he came to this country. He graduated with first class honours in</p>
<p> engineering from Adelaide University. He went on to become not only</p>
<p> Chairman of Western Mining but also Chairman of the Â‘big Australian'.</p>
<p> I have known him for more than 20 years. I have not found a businessman</p>
<p> in Australia who better combines a capacity to run a company efficiently,</p>
<p> to see the importance of productivity and making a profit but also</p>
<p> the social and community responsibilities of corporate Australia to</p>
<p> the rest of the nation. And I do thank the company and I compliment</p>
<p> Arvi Parbo on the announcement that is being made today about the</p>
<p> establishment of the WMC trust. It is the very example of the sort</p>
<p> of corporate philanthropy which I believe we need more of in Australia.</p>
<p> And Western Mining has been one of those companies that has always</p>
<p> been to the fore and has always been demonstrating a lead.</p>
<p>But Arvi you have impressed those that you've met in business</p>
<p> and in life generally greatly with your integrity, with your high</p>
<p> intelligence, your love of Australia, your love of mining, your understanding</p>
<p> of your fellow human beings. You are a marvellous example of what</p>
<p> we have achieved in this country of how with nothing, with not even</p>
<p> a knowledge of the language of our nation, you can go to the very</p>
<p> top. It's a tribute to you but it's also a tribute to the</p>
<p> Australian dream and the Australian ideal of the last 50 years. And</p>
<p> on that note I have very great pleasure in declaring open the Olympic</p>
<p> Dam extension. Thank you.</p>
