    <content><![CDATA[<p>I warmly welcome the signing in Madang today of an historic arrangement between Australia and Papua New Guinea to secure the future protection of the Kokoda Track and Owen Stanley Ranges.</p>
<p>I discussed collaboration to protect the Track with Prime Minister Somare during my visit to Papua New Guinea in early March.</p>
<p>We asked officials to produce a program of collaboration that dealt with the challenges of land use and the needs of local villages and communities in the area, while recognising and protecting the deep historical and emotional significance the Track has for so many Australians.</p>
<p>The arrangement signed today achieves those objectives.</p>
<p>Trekking Kokoda has become a rite of passage for many Australians. I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to walk the Track with my son in 2006.</p>
<p>Today's announcement means the integrity of the Track and the experience of trekking it will now be preserved for future generations of Australians.</p>
<p>The Kokoda Track is part and parcel of the Australian soul and on the eve of Anzac Day this is a great outcome for Australia.</p>
