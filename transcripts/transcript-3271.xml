PRIME MINISTER 16 May 1974<br />
ASSISTANCE TO STATE OF VICTORIA TO ALLEVIATE<br />
FLOOD DAMAGE<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr E. G. Whitlam, announced<br />
today that as a result of reports of extensive flooding in<br />
Victoria he had urgently telegramed Mr Hamer offering<br />
financial assistance for the alleviation of personal<br />
distress and repair of damage. Mr Whitlam also announced<br />
that the Australian Defence services had been requested<br />
to provide whatever assistance could be given to alleviate<br />
the effects of the flood.<br />
" I am saddened and distressed to hear that a<br />
soldier has drowned whilst engaged on flood relief<br />
operations. Such tragic accidents compound the already<br />
grave distress caused by floods", Mr Whitlam said.<br />
Mr Whitlam went on to say that in a letter to<br />
all Premiers dated 27 February he had outlined the<br />
arrangements for financial assistance from the Australian<br />
Government to the States in the event of natural disasters.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the offer which he made in that letter<br />
applied in the case of the current Victorian floods. The<br />
offer to Victoria includes financial assistance, on a<br />
dollar for dollar basis, for the immediate relief of<br />
personal hardship and distress. As well, under these<br />
arrangements the Australian Government meets the whole<br />
cost of approved rehabilitation and restoration measures<br />
in Victoria above a base cost of $ 3.5 million.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the expenditure covered by<br />
his Government's offer included the provision of emergency<br />
food, clothing and accommodation, essential items of<br />
furniture and personal effects of those in needy circumstances<br />
as a result of the floods.<br />
The Prime Minister said that tomorrow he would break<br />
his return journey from Melbourne to Sydney and tour the<br />
affected areas and, in particular, the Seymour area so as he<br />
could see the extent of the damage and the hardship being<br />
suffered by those affected.<br />
