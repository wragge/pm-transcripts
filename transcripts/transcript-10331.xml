7 May 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
E O E<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good afternoon. Ladies and gentlemen, could I start on the Wik issue. Cabinet this morning fully<br />
endorsed my ten point plan which will now go to the Government joint party room next week. I want<br />
to make it clear that that plan has been endorsed because it is the best and fairest solution to a very<br />
difficult issue. The alternatives will cost Australian taxpayers more. The alternatives will create delay<br />
and confusion. The alternatives don't strike the Australian fair balance between the legitimate interests<br />
of farmers and pastoralists and also the rights of native titleholders. I am strongly committed to the ten<br />
point plan because it will deliver certainty to Australian farmers and pastoralists and it will enable those<br />
pastoralists and farmers to get back to business to run their properties without interference from<br />
anybody.<br />
This is a difficult issue. I understand the concerns of representatives of rural Australia and it is not only<br />
the members of the National Party who represent rural electorates. In fact there are more rural Liberals<br />
in the House of Representatives than either of the other two parties. It is an issue of great concern to<br />
those people but when the effect of the ten point plan is fully understood, when for example the proviso<br />
in the ten point plan which enables a farmer or pastoralist to carry out any of the activities embraced by<br />
the definition of primary production in the taxation act without having to go through the right to<br />
negotiate procedure, the amplitude of the change involved in the ten point plan to the benefit of farmers<br />
and pastoralists is fully understood and properly known.<br />
I just want to make it very clear that I won't be backing off the ten point plan. I am very strongly<br />
committed to it. It is the only fair and just solution to a very difficult problem and I will be devoting all<br />
of my energy to secure Its passage through the Parliament and I will be arguing of course very strongly<br />
that it receive overwhelming support in the Party room but I wouldn't want there to be any doubt in<br />
anybody's mind of how strongly committed I am to the ten point plan as a solution to this very difficult<br />
issue. Could I also inform you that Cabinet has decided in principle to apply, in relation to future<br />
compensation that may arise in relation to native title claims, the split of 75% being paid by the<br />
Commonwealth and 25% being paid by the States as currently applies under the Native Title Act for<br />
past acts involving compensation. There are some proper conditions attaching to that agreement. One<br />
of those proper conditions is that if there is any significant upgrading of leasehold tenures in the various<br />
States then it would be a requirement of our paying 75% of any compensation that might have been<br />
involved following a compulsory acquisition of a native title, it would be a condition of our paying<br />
that the State charge something for the betterment factor involved in the upgrade of the title. In other<br />
words, it will not be possible for there to be mass fireeholding or upgrading without some proper charge<br />
being made for the additional benefit that will accrue to the titleholder.<br />
I will be writing to the Premiers in the next day or two about that issue but it does meet the view that<br />
was put to me at the Premiers' Conference. I did undertake on that occasion to have a look at<br />
extending the 75%-25% principle to subsequent compensation. We have decided to do that subject to<br />
proper conditions including the one in particular that I have mentioned. Any questions? </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Is Mr Fischer 100% behind the ten point plan?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes he put out a statement today saying that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is the ten point plan that Cabinet endorsed the same as you released last week?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it possible if States go down the path of upgrading pastoral leases to some exclusive form of tenure?<br />
Is that possible on a mass scale provided that they meet the proviso measures you spoke about?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well they will be able to do what is allowed under their law and what be allowed in the legislation, the<br />
question of how frequently it might occur will depend on circumstances both in relation to individual<br />
pastoralists and also in individual States but let me make it clear in relation to that, there has been<br />
absolutely no alteration to what has been in the ten point plan now for weeks. It was always possible<br />
under the ten point plan to have a Crescent Heads situation and that was where, that's the bit of land in<br />
northern New South Wales, where you reach agreement. Native title is established. You then have<br />
a within a few hours there was a compulsory acquisition. Now in some cases I imagine that will<br />
occur. In other cases I imagine it won't occur because the pastoralists and the native title holder may<br />
be perfectly happy to let the arrangement rest but there's been no change on that and the extent to<br />
which it might occur will vary from State to State, case to case, area to area.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister are you, just to clarify, that Tim Fischer and his National Party colleagues in Cabinet are<br />
now bound by Cabinet solidarity and cannot in a public forum work for amendments to your plan?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the normal rules apply, yes. The normal rules apply with all of these things but this is not a normal<br />
issue even though the normal rules apply. It's a very difficult issue and it's always harder to apply the<br />
normal rules to abnormal issues.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is that a let out?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No it's not a let out no, no, you would make a great mistake. There are no let outs but equally there is<br />
an understanding on my part, a public understanding of the difficulty of this issue for my friend and<br />
colleague Tim Fischer and he has displayed as usual magnificent loyalty and support to the Government<br />
on a very difficult issue but there can't be any mucking around on issues of Cabinet solidarity. The<br />
Cabinet decision has been taken. All members of the Cabinet are bound to publicly support and<br />
prosecute that decision. That is the way you run a government. Now I say that without qualification,<br />
without ambiguity, but I also, in saying so I acknowledge that this is one of those issues that has been<br />
extraordinarily difficult for Tim. I understand that and I sympathise with him and I would be failing in<br />
the reciprocity of loyalty that is involved in a Coalition Government if I didn't acknowledge that. You<br />
only run a successful Coalition Government if you are prepared to recognise the particular difficulties of<br />
your colleagues on certain issues whilst always working within the established rules of Cabinet<br />
solidarity and I think Tim has behaved magnificently on this issue but at the end of the day you've got </p>
<p>to take a decision. We have taken a decision. I am not backing off that decision. I will be taking it to<br />
the Party room and I will be asking for very strong support and I expect to get it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, do you believe the fear of Pauline Hanson has been driving a lot of the opposition from the<br />
Nationals? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I would have thought the great bulk of it no but it's very hard to quantify. It is a difficult issue for<br />
pastoralists and you've got to understand that the Wik decision destroyed their bona fide belief about<br />
where they thought pastoral leases sat in relation to native title. Now what my ten point plan does is to<br />
wipe away that uncertainty but at the same time show a greater respect for native title than with the<br />
blanket extinguishment option and that's what I set out to do two or three months ago. I said I wanted<br />
to respect native title but deliver security to pastoralists. Now I have done that with the ten point plan.<br />
That is why I am, if you like, passionately committed to getting the ten point plan adopted into<br />
legislation and understood throughout rural Australia and once farmers and pastoralists understand it,<br />
they will know that what I have been saying over the past few weeks has been right and they will also<br />
know that some of the things that have been said in favour of blanket extinguishment have been<br />
illusionary mirages and have been quite misleading and deceptive.<br />
JOURNALIST: What benefits do Aborigines get out of it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well they get the respect and protection of native title which was inherent in the original Mabo decision.<br />
I mean I have never disguised the fact that Wik had to be wound back. It's a question of how far you<br />
wind it back. I've never denied that.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
They say there's nothing in it ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I tell you what, there's a lot more in it than the alternative would be and it's a question of what is a<br />
fair balance and I think the pendulum has gone too far out in that direction and I've brought it back to<br />
the middle and that's why it's a fair plan and that's why I'm so strongly committed to it and I don't<br />
intend to back away from it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard in the context of your comments in relation to Tim Fischer..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I have already acknowledged Michelle.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard will you ensure that the upgrading charge that you mentioned if leases are converted to<br />
freehold is not just a token charge9<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, in the context of your comments on the Coalition and Tim Fischer's performance in the<br />
Coalition, given the fact that the Coalition should not be a one way street, what wins can you point to in </p>
<p>terms of Mr Fischer changing the ten point plan in terms of meeting the concerns of his constituents or<br />
has it become just, the Coalition become a one way street?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The Coalition hasn't become a one way street. The difference between what's been put to me at<br />
various stages of the negotiations by representatives of the Aborigines and others, particularly the<br />
former, the difference between that and the ten point plan is evidence of my concern to ensure that<br />
pastoralists are properly protected but looking after the legitimate interests of farmers and pastoralists is<br />
not something which lies peculiarly within the monopoly of the National Party. There are many Liberal<br />
members who represent rural constituencies and you don't approach this thing on the basis of<br />
apportioning wins and losses. You approach it on the basis of a fair agreement and what I have<br />
produced is fair. That's why I support it. That's the main reason why I'm so very strongly supported<br />
to it. It's not a question of sitting down and handing out a morsel to this or that section of the<br />
Government, it's a question of sitting down and talking to everybody and working out a plan that<br />
strikes a fair balance on a very difficult subject and one that for obvious systemic reasons poses a much<br />
greater challenge and represents a much more difficult issue for a party on our, or parties on our side of<br />
politics and that's why it has involved a bit more elbow grease than other decisions that we've had to<br />
take,. JOURNALIST: Under this plan, is it possible, and I have no idea, is it possible for a State government to resume a large<br />
bulk of pastoral leases compulsorily and then transfer those leases into freehold and give the leases back<br />
so wiping out native title?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There are compulsory acquisition powers under State legislation now and what will be possible after<br />
these changes have been made is that compulsory acquisition of proven Native Title can take place but<br />
it will have to take place after due inquiry which affords the same rights of objection and comment and<br />
intervention to Aboriginal title holders as it does to any other title holders or claimants, and also the<br />
payment of compensation.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, when did you decide that you'd had enough negotiations and what in particular made<br />
you think that? I mean, was it..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I think probably a week or ten days ago we were bringing the thing to finality. I had a very long<br />
meeting with my backbench committee which I made my position on this very clear. But it's an<br />
ongoing process.<br />
JOURNALIST: Since that meeting with the backbench committee, the Chairman of that committee, Wilson Tuckey, has<br />
said the position for blanket extinguishment has hardened. On what do you base your confidence that<br />
the Party Room will give the big tick to the 10 Point Plan?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well because it's the best plan, that's why. And in the end the Party Room will always back the best<br />
plan. JOURNALIST:<br />
But there are a number of backbenchers saying they don't believe your plan is the best and won't<br />
deliver certainty to pastoralists. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it is on something like this I would be amazed if 100% of the Party Room backed it, I mean, as<br />
it's ever been the case on difficult issues. But at the end of the day the job of the Government is to take<br />
a decision, to take a stand, to go out and argue the wisdom of that position and the wisdom of that<br />
stand. I have been very patient on this issue, very patient indeed. But I promised the public I would be<br />
because it's a sensitive issue that goes to the fabric of the kind of society we are. And if I had been<br />
peremptory and if I had dealt with this issue in the space of a few weeks I would have been heavily<br />
criticised as being insensitive to the wide variety of views that exist. But I have listened to everybody.<br />
I've made a decision. I'm sure that decision is right and I'm going to go hell for leather from now on to<br />
get that accepted, to get it put into legislation and to deliver a bit of certainty to the pastoralists and the<br />
farmers and the Aboriginal community that I think they're entitled to have.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you saying that your 10 Point Plan is now set in stone, that despite further concerns there will be no<br />
further amendments?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Stone? Well certainly I'm very strongly committed to It, yes, of course it Is.<br />
JOURNALIST: So there won't be any more amendments despite backbench concerns or concerns from the National<br />
Party? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, there are going to be no changes to the essence of the plan. You might, when the legislation<br />
comes out, of course be willing to talk about the way in which it is expressed. I'm not going to be so<br />
pig headed as not to be willing to do that. But if you're asking me if I'm going to back away from any<br />
of the essentials of the plan, the answer is no, I'm not. If you're asking me whether there is any<br />
possibility that I will support blanket extinguishment, no there is not.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, you suggested yesterday that you were growing tired of the way in which some<br />
backbenchers were talking out of school..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I wasn't, I wasn't referring to backbenchers. I was not referring to backbenchers. I think my<br />
backbench has been magnificent.<br />
JOURNALIST: But you did make comments about criticism from within the Liberal Party...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, yes, I was referring to criticisms at a State government level from some people, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes I do, I think,.. no, I'm very happy to answer that question. I think that I have been very patient and<br />
I have turned the other cheek. The fact is that given that the Coalition has not had control of the<br />
Senate, and in that sense we're in stark contrast to some State governments over the last few years<br />
who've had control of both Houses, given that we haven't had control of the Senate we have achieved a<br />
remarkable degree of economic reform and economic improvement and economic change. I mean, just<br />
remember bringing this whole thing back to basics and back to the main game, the mainstream, </p>
<p>whatever main you like just bear in mind that we inherited a 10 billion underlying budget deficit when<br />
we came into office and we've made huge strides to getting that right. We've brought interest rates<br />
down. We've reformed the labour market. We've embarked upon the greatest privatisation this<br />
country has seen. We've undertaken major reforms to the taxation system of particular benefit to small<br />
business. And I just won't accept any longer this suggestion that the pace of economic change and<br />
reform under this Government has been too slow. And every time that allegation is made in future I<br />
shall be answering it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, does that mean you're willing to get into a slanging match with Mr Kennett?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I'm not willing to get into a slanging match with anybody. I am willing to openly defend the<br />
achievements of my Government that's what I'm willing to do. And all of my Ministers from now on<br />
are going to openly defend the achievements of our Government because we are very proud of those<br />
achievements and we're not going to turn the cheek any longer.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, can you maintain that momentum given what's happened with Senator Colston this week?<br />
I mean, the numbers in the Senate are moving against you.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we'll just wait and see. I mean, it's a very fluid world. I mean, we now see the re-embrace of<br />
Senator Colston. I mean, it must have been a marvellous scene on those Labor Party benches last night.<br />
I mean, this man that they have attacked and reviled and traduced like nobody else has been reviled and<br />
traduced. I mean, the man of course they cuddled and protected for 14 years they now lovingly<br />
embrace in order to defeat Coalition legislation. I mean, where does Kim Beazley stand on all of this? I<br />
mean, where does Mr Beazley stand? I mean, he sat on that report. He ignored the advice of his<br />
lawyers 13 long years ago. He allowed his party to reindorse this bloke year after year. I mean, we<br />
have done the right and principled thing we sent him off to the police because we thought it was the<br />
right thing to do. We also defend his right to have a day in court. They've broken the rules on every<br />
score. They covered up in the first place and now they want to tear up the rule book, they want to tear<br />
up the rule of law and throw him out of Parliament before he's had a fair trial. I mean, on every count<br />
they are a disgrace on the Colston issue. And if Beazley had one skerrick of leadership on this he would<br />
reject his vote in the same way that I have. But he's very happy to have it, of course he is.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you regret not making more use of the vote last year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I beg your pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you regret not making more use of Senator Colston's vote last year, maybe pushing the envelope<br />
more on reform?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sorry. Do you regret not making more...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I can't see you. Who is it? George, George, you're in the fog George. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Do you regret not making more use of Senator Colston's vote last year when you had it? There might<br />
have been a few more issues...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, you use it as though it is ours to deploy wherever we choose. That was never the case. This idea<br />
that we knew in advance exactly how Senator Colston was going to vote is absolute nonsense we<br />
didn't. It so transpired that on a number of issues he did support us, on others he didn't. He voted<br />
against us on the industrial relations legislation, so did Brian Harradine. Brian Harradine voted against<br />
us on the Hindmarsh Bridge legislation. I forget how Colston voted against us. But we were fortunate<br />
to get our Telstra legislation through and our budget through. But we had every right to expect the<br />
Senate to pass that material because we told the public we were going to sell Telstra. And I just think<br />
that this idea that we sort of were given some huge favour getting the Telstra legislation through when<br />
we campaigned on it in the 1996 election is ridiculous.<br />
JOURNALIST: this morning...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I actually meant Michael Gordon, but you've had a go haven't you Mick? Have another go and then<br />
I'll have Mr Gordon's.<br />
JOURNALIST: What does this mean for media ownership? Does the Government have to revise its strategy given<br />
that... PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Media ownership?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes. Discussions on...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, well we will make a decision on that and then whatever decision we make of it involves legislation,<br />
it will be presented for the Parliament. I mean, we're not going to sort of have the decision we take<br />
coloured by some sort of assessment of how we think Senator Colston is going to vote. I have no idea<br />
what he might do in relation to that or, indeed, Senator Harradine. We discussed the matter a little over<br />
the last day or two and will be resuming the discussion again shortly and in the meantime there will be<br />
some consultations between the Minister and the relevant government party committee.<br />
JOURNALIST: How do you respond to the views of the backbench, particularly the committee Chairman, ( inaudible)<br />
by changing the rules is going to do nothing more than give Fairfax to Mr Packer?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
How do I respond to that? Well look, that is part of the ongoing debate, I'm not going to respond to<br />
one particular part of the debate. The issue is under consideration and I'm not going to respond to<br />
individual comments on it. I mean, I think we all know that when it comes to media laws everybody has<br />
a passionately held allegedly disinterested view, everybody puts it very strongly and I think you have to<br />
discount the passion of the views that are put fairly heavily.<br />
JOURNALIST: Wasn't Mr Fischer at the Cabinet meeting this morning? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No he wasn't, but I had a number of conversations with him.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
He was not there for the very simple reason, David, that he had a prior commitment in Queensland.<br />
JOURNALIST: So there's no sense of the rug being pulled out from under your Deputy ( inaudible)... I mean, the<br />
decisions...? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, quite the reverse. We are together on the platform arguing the case.<br />
JOURNALIST: But he wasn't in the room when the decision was made.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, well hang on, we were just confirming what was a very strong previous disposition.<br />
JOURNALIST: These are members of your own backbench who are becoming increasingly vocal on the issue of cross<br />
media ownership....<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh, I don't think they're becoming vocal at all. I mean, you've got allow little... I mean, with a large<br />
majority like that you don't run around taking... sort of getting into some kind of paroxysm of rage<br />
because there's the odd point of view expressed. Look, I understand that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, when do you expect to announce a decision on cross media...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm sorry, I think Karen was trying to ask me a question.<br />
JOURNALIST: I see, so it's not significant...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
What's that?<br />
JOURNALIST: That people are being outspoken on the issue of diversity, of expressing concern that you might change<br />
the laws?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, you know, diversity of opinions.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, when do you expect to make a decision on the changes to the laws? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't know. All I can say Margo is that we've commenced discussion of the issue and we'll return to<br />
it soon but I'm not going to try and predict any more precisely than that. It's an important issue but it's<br />
certainly not the most important issue we have. But it's important.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, you've said Wik is an extraordinarily difficult issue for Tim Fischer. What's your message<br />
to Joan Sheldon who is part of the government that's effectively quarantined<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't I have had a number of discussions with Joan about the issue. If I have a view to put to<br />
her I wouldn't convey it, much in all as I, you know, enjoy your company, I wouldn't convey It at this<br />
press conference. I think it would be more natural and polite of me to talk to her on the telephone.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the New South Wales Government's move to a bed tax..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Bed tax, yes. This is a Carr GST isn't it?~<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I mean, it's a very, very interesting... I1 mean, you know, a Carr GST. Very, very interesting. I mean,<br />
you know, introduced in a very, very ad hoc sort of way a Carr GST.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you rule one out<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
A Carr GST always. Always rule out a Carr GST.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is this an area of tax reform that the States should be commended on?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, if you think the New South Wales budget is about tax reform you don't really mean that<br />
Malcolm, do you? I mean, the New South Wales budget is all about big spending and big taxing.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, are you concerned on the media ownership issue that you've alienated every major<br />
proprietor accept for Kerry Packer?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I am sure they are all fair minded, all of them, and the idea that they would feel any sort of sense of<br />
aggression towards one or other participant on the political stage according the stance that it is<br />
speculated that that participant might take would be a long way from their thoughts. Look I am certain<br />
that at the end of the day the position that we adopt on this will be a fair sensible position that will<br />
promote the national interest.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you still have the view that we don't need to change the foreign ownership rules in the media or do<br />
you think that we need to look at both cross media and foreign ownership together? 9 </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think it is very hard given that the thing is now, to use the legal parlance, part heard, I don't really<br />
think I should start answering those questions, much and all as I am tempted to do so. I think it might<br />
be a bit unfair on my colleagues if I did that.<br />
JOURNALIST: What are the chances now, Mr Howard, of having a public inquiry on media ownership?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We've had so many public inquiries on media ownership in this country I think most people are sick of<br />
them except for journalists.<br />
JOURNALIST: So..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't see any need for a further public inquiry.<br />
JOURNALIST: Without giving a sort of a firm date on cross media ownership and given that you have been talking<br />
about it for some time, can we expect something within this next session?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No look, I'm not going to do that.<br />
JOURNALIST: You said at the beginning that selling the 10 point plan you're going to devote all your energy to it...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I'm going to devote a lot of energy to it, not all of my energy to it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there a danger that the task of selling this week's budget is going to..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I don't think so. It is will such a good budget that there will be a natural sales momentum about it.<br />
It will be a very good budget for jobs. It will be a particularly good budget for regional Australia and it<br />
is going to be a budget for the longer term and I think people will see it as the product of a lot of work<br />
in a fairly compressed state of compressed amount of time. I mean one of the things that has<br />
inevitably happened over the last couple of months is that senior ministers, myself and the Treasurer<br />
included have been largely preoccupied in putting the budget together, and all governments go through<br />
these phases but next week the budget will come down, I think it will be seen as a very positive budget<br />
for employment growth, a very positive budget for regional Australia and small business and it will be<br />
very much part of the mainstream appeal of this government.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you rule out any tax increases in the budget?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm not going to speculate about..<br />
JOURNALIST: iAnaudible.. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm not, you know our position on tax increases.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the budget, when you say it is a good... it will be a good budget for jobs and for regional Australia,<br />
are you talking about specific initiatives or in general?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm talking generally about the budget. The specific initiatives will be announced on Tuesday night.<br />
JOURNALIST: But they will be specific initiatives?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I didn't say that. I said all of the specific initiatives of the budget will be announced on Tuesday<br />
night, but it will be good for those sectors. Very very good.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you give us a sense of what you are going to say on the Pauline Hanson issue tomorrow night?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, what I will do thank you for asking that. ( That doesn't mean to say I asked him to do it!)<br />
There was no deal with Cassidy!<br />
Look, I will say something about Mrs Hanson tomorrow night. I'm not going to attack her personally.<br />
In fact I think the demonstrations that have gone on around Australia over the last week or so have<br />
really been quite stupid and counterproductive and probably momentarily driven more people towards<br />
her rather than repel them. And I really think it is people who are interested in denying her oxygen,<br />
they shouldn't engage in those sorts of demonstrations.<br />
I won't be attacking her personally. I certainly won't be attacking many of the people who've been<br />
superficially attracted to her because as I acknowledged in the past there are reasons why that may have<br />
occurred. I will however, because she has now gone from being an independent Member of Parliament<br />
to purporting to be a Party leader, I will be taking the opportunity, in part on Thursday night, but<br />
certainly not comprehensively and only and definitively on Thursday night, I will be taking the<br />
opportunity of pointing out that whilst some of the people who are attracted to her may have reason to<br />
feel that past situations have dealt them a bad hand, that her solutions as far as I understand them will<br />
end up dealing them an even worse hand. In other words, if there are problems which she is<br />
endeavouring to exploit, her solutions to those problems if they were implemented as I understand<br />
them, will produce an even worse situation and an even worse outcome.<br />
I think in a situation like this you have to have an intelligent and balanced response. Last year I took a<br />
view which I genuinely held to, and I still believe now that the view I then took was correct, that the<br />
appropriate response given her status as an independent Member of Parliament was to, apart from<br />
denying some specifically absurd remarks that she had made about us being I think ' flooded with<br />
Asians' was one remark she made that was offensive and wrong, and the other remark she made was<br />
about Aboriginal disadvantage. Well, I repudiated both of those statements as being errors of fact in an<br />
interview shortly after her speech and beyond that I took the view that is well known. Now others took<br />
a different view and I still maintain that that stance was correct.<br />
I believe now that she has moved into the party phase and is of course receiving a lot of publicity as a<br />
consequence of that, that it is appropriate from time to time for me to attack attitudes that she expresses<br />
which are wrong. I mean she does essentially appeal to a frightened view of Australia which is<br />
something that I don't like. This is not a frightened country. It is an optimistic hopeful country and </p>
<p>there is an element of bitterness and sourness in the message that is being transmitted. The decent<br />
conservative mainstream of Australia is not built on bitterness and sourness, it is built on generosity and<br />
compassion and I would hope that those people who are disconcerted by the pace of change and the<br />
momentum for change in our community are not enveloped by views that are based on bitterness and<br />
sourness but rather on views that are based on optimism and hope. Now, it is in that kind of context<br />
that I will have something to say tomorrow night.<br />
But she has a right to speak. She has a right to be heard. She has the obligation of demonstrating the<br />
veracity of the claims she makes. She must be held accountable for the absurdity of some of those. I<br />
mean, I noticed earlier this week that she's, if the report Is correct, is actually advocating the relegalisation<br />
of the weapon that was used at Port Arthur. Now, if that claim is true and I've not seen it<br />
countermanded, that is an atrociously irresponsible statement for anybody to make and I think it Is<br />
something that would fill most Australians, whether they are conservative, Liberal, Socialist, or<br />
whatever with very very deep revulsion.<br />
JOURNALIST: If people find her views objectionable then Prime Minister and you are saying that they shouldn't be<br />
protesting. How should they be responding to her?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I just operate on that old political belief that if you make a noisy physical protest against somebody<br />
and it is apparently violent, it generates public sympathy for the person against whom you are<br />
demonstrating. And if the name of the exercise is to withdraw public support, you don't achieve that<br />
goal by generating public support. So that's the basis of my call to those people. I mean, that has<br />
always been my view. I always think the most damning response to somebody whose views you find<br />
unacceptable can be, and not in all cases and everybody has a different way of handling these things I<br />
have my way, journalists will have their ways and others will have their ways. But I think it is just a<br />
question of trying to get a balance to understand the social forces at work in the Australian community<br />
which have produced this sense of unease. And we are talking about change now that has been going<br />
on for 20 years, and further change is unavoidable. We have to as politicians understand that and we<br />
have to sympathise with people who are affected by that change. We must understand their resentment<br />
if they are not involved in the process of debating the nature of that change. We must point out the<br />
folly of alternative solutions that will produce a worse result.<br />
I mean, my greatest criticism of her is that what she is proposing will in fact produce a worse outcome<br />
than the outcome that she is criticising. I mean, I've quoted the example of foreign investment. Now<br />
of course there has always been a concern about the level of foreign investment in Australia. I<br />
understand that, it is human, it is natural, but you have to recognise that if you cut out foreign<br />
investment in this country you will lower the living standard of this nation. The only way you can<br />
reduce foreign investment is to reduce the need for it, and that is to generate greater savings so that we<br />
don't have to borrow the savings of foreigners to finance our consumption. Now, that sort of dull<br />
economic analysis is relevant to the Government's task in increasing national savings. Now, that's not a<br />
very rhetorically flourished way of putting it, but it happens to be the truth and people who rail against<br />
foreign investment have an obligation of explaining where the jobs will come from for people who<br />
might be dismissed if foreign investment dries up. So I think it is it's not a process, it's not an issue<br />
that can be sort of dealt with overnight. And if I may say so, one of the flaws in the criticism that's<br />
been made of myself by some, including some in this room and some generally, is this idea that this sort<br />
of one single response, speech, knock-out blow that is going to sort of wipe Pauline Hanson from the<br />
face of the earth. I mean, life is never as simple as that and I think you know, she has attracted a bit of<br />
support from whom it varies a bit according to which poll you read.<br />
I noticed in the Bulletin this morning that most of it seemed to be from the Labor Party. I think in fact<br />
the Labor Party's figure in the Bulletin poll this morning is the lowest it's been for 20 years in a Bulletin<br />
poll. It's down to 30%. Now, you know, but it is bouncing around a little bit, but I am certain that if<br />
12 </p>
<p>there is an intelligent mature response and analysis, the transience and the superficiality of what is<br />
offered will become apparent to Australians. But you have to recognise that there are a lot of decent<br />
people out there who for a whole combination of reasons might be attracted and there are some who<br />
aren't, but the great bulk of the people who are going along are just ordinary Australians like the rest of<br />
us and you have to understand that. But you also have an obligation to specifically deal with particular<br />
atrocities on the truth. And this has to be the last question Mr Gordon?<br />
JOURNALIST: Should some of your more vocal critics on your side of politics... National Party of your handling of<br />
Wik realise that further criticisms from now on will simply play into the hands of Pauline Hanson.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look the best way of quickly reconsolidating conservative Australia behind the Coalition is to get the<br />
Wik thing behind it.<br />
Thank you. </p>
