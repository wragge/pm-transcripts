F77/ 228<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 16 OCTOBER 1977<br />
ADDRESS AT LIBERAL PARTY FEDERAL COUNCIL<br />
Thirty three years ago today on October 16, 1944, a meeting of<br />
non-Labor groups in Canberra adopted the name " Liberal Party"<br />
for their new political organisation. They believed that<br />
Australia was a great country and had the potential to be even<br />
greater. They believed that applying Liberal ideals to the task<br />
of Government would enhance the lives of all Australians.<br />
Since that time, the face of Australia has been vastly changed.<br />
Changed by the migrants who have come from all over the world to<br />
start a new life, and who have so enriched Australia; changed by<br />
new industries and by new technologies; changed by the influence<br />
of world issues and events.<br />
But the cornmitmets and ideals that led our founders to form this<br />
party more than a third of a century ago the commitment to<br />
individual freedom; to growth and development; to the rule of law;<br />
to a tolerant society; to assisting those in need are as valid,<br />
as relevant, now as they were then.<br />
Liberalism has never been allowed to harden into an inflexible<br />
dogma. It has kept touch with the real concerns and feelings of<br />
Australians in city and country. One demonstration of this, of<br />
the strength of our philosophy, of our success as a Party and as<br />
a Government, is that we are never afraid to declare our commitment<br />
to liberalism. What a contrast with our political opponents.<br />
How many of them are willing to stand and declare their commitment<br />
to socialism. On this matter, if on no other, the Labor Party is<br />
acutely sensitive to the feelings of the Australian people.<br />
Labor leaders remain silent and sullen because they know Australians<br />
do not want socialism at any price. They know it is a dogma<br />
totally alien to Australians.<br />
We are proud to be called Liberals, because liberalism can provide<br />
unity and a sense of national purpose, whileallowing people t'-o<br />
live their own life in their own way. Because liberalism can<br />
provide responsive and effective Government without creating an<br />
over-powerful and intrusive state. Because liberalism can provide<br />
real help to those in need while encouraging the energy and initiative<br />
that are a healthy nation's lifeblood.<br />
Labor can provide * none of these. In Government it was incompetent,<br />
divided, bungling and scandal-ridden. It was a Government of<br />
higher taxes committed to the destruction of incentive. It was<br />
a Government that encouraged industrial lawlessness, held up<br />
/ Australia' s </p>
<p>2<br />
Australia's development and squandered Australia's potential.<br />
They have not changed in Opposition. They have not made any<br />
constructive contribution to Australia they are aimless and<br />
divided. But they do agree on some things.<br />
They all want higher taxes. They all want Government to spend<br />
eTxhtery avaalgl awntalnyt to Mrd. e pWrheistsl-bamu swinoeuslsd bsyp entad kiantg leawasaty a$ 2l l bthiel litaoxn more.<br />
concessions this Government has given. They all want to stifle<br />
mining projects and Australia's development. Labor's Deputy Leader,<br />
Mr. Uren, has been running a campaign attacking mining development,<br />
and the Labor Party's policy on uranium tries to undermine the<br />
properly safeguarded development of a vital energy source. Labor<br />
has made -its position perfectly plain. They would stifle growth,<br />
halt development, remove all tax concessions and incentives to<br />
invest. One financial newspaper has described Labor's approach<br />
as " more of the same old bungling".<br />
But in the light of Labor's consistent attack on development, in<br />
the light of Mr. Hayden's cynical attempts to promote speculation<br />
against the Australian dollar, in the light of the concentration of<br />
union disruption in export industries, where it will come to the<br />
attention of overseas investo~ rs, one is entitled to ask whether it<br />
is more of the same old bungling or a deliberate attempt by the<br />
Labor Party, acting in harness with union extremists, to undermine<br />
Australia's economic and social framework, with all the consequences<br />
that would entail. One thing is absolutely clear the Labor Party's<br />
opposition to growth. and development is denying people one of their<br />
most fundamental-rights_-I the right to work.<br />
The Liberal Party has always stood for growth and development.<br />
Without growth, without development, there simply will not be the<br />
opportunities Australians should have to improve the quality of their<br />
lives. Without continuing development there simply will not be enough<br />
decent and rewarding jobs for our young people.<br />
As Liberals, we knew that there could not be a full return to<br />
prosperity unless inflation was reduced, unless individual initiative<br />
and achievement was encouraged and rewarded, unless private enterprise<br />
was given room to grow. We always said that Australia could not be<br />
restored to full economic health overnight. We said it would be<br />
difficult. We never pretended it would be painless. We were<br />
elected because we said we would face up to the hard decisions.<br />
Our anti-inflationary policies, our tax reforms, our incentives to<br />
private enterprise, have all flowed from the basic principles of<br />
liberalism. They have laid the foundations for prosperity.<br />
Australia is on the move.<br />
In my 1975 Election Policy speech I said " Over the next three years,<br />
we will introduce a number of major reforms to direct resources away<br />
from Governmet and back into the hands of individuals and business".<br />
In just twenty two months, we brought in tax indexation, we created<br />
new simplified and lower personal income tax rates, we brought in for<br />
business the investment allowance, the trading stock valuation<br />
adjustment and to aid the small business sector, the burden of<br />
division 7 tax liability on private companies has been eased.<br />
We have made much needed taxation concessions for mining and<br />
exploration. We are achieving the transfer of resources back<br />
into the hands of individuals and businesses -the transfer that<br />
is vital to development. / In this </p>
<p>3<br />
In this financial year and the one just ended, corporate and<br />
individual taxpayers will on present estimates have saved almost<br />
$ 3.4 billion in tax. We have been able to do this because we kept<br />
our promise to rein in Government spending. We have ended the days<br />
of Government waste and extravagance, and reduced the Government<br />
deficit by half a billion dollars in each of our two Budgets.<br />
But the best news for Australia is that inflation is falling.<br />
Under Labor, inflation reached the height of 19% in the last half<br />
of 1974. Information now available from the Organisation for<br />
Economic Co-operation and Development, an international b. ody of<br />
high standing, shows that we are cutting the inflation gap with the<br />
rest of the world. In the first half of 1977, consumer prices in<br />
Australia rose at an annual rate of less than 10%. This was in<br />
fact lower than the average increase by our major trading partners.<br />
And other measures of prices show that inflation is continuing to<br />
fall.<br />
For example, in the three months to July, the price index of<br />
materials used in manufacturing rose only. compared with a'<br />
rise of 3.6% over the same period in 1976. Our policies have enabled<br />
for the first time in four years some downward movement in interest<br />
rates. A downward movementwhich has been confirmed by the terms of<br />
the conversion loan announced by the Treasurer this week. The trend<br />
to lower interest rates will gather momentum as inflation falls.<br />
There has been a -substantial strengthening of our trade and current<br />
account. In the September quarter, seasonally adjusted exports<br />
increased by around while imports decreased about Here<br />
we see some of the beneficial effects of last November's devaluation<br />
and we can expect a further strengthening of'our trading position.<br />
The outlook for bur economy is steadily improving. In 1976-77 the<br />
non-farm sector of the economy grew by 3.5% in real terms compared<br />
with an actual decrease under Labor in 1974-75. Company profits<br />
have increased by 23%, and investment in plant and equipment was<br />
up 6% in real terms. Consumers have been prepared to spend increasing<br />
proportions of their wages and salaries. Real household<br />
disposable income largely because of lower taxes, falling prices<br />
and the Family Allowance Scheme, was 1.6% higher in 1976-77 than in<br />
1975-76. There has been a marked recovery in housing approvals,<br />
and many large industrial and mining projects have been announced<br />
including the North-West Shelf development, $ 600 m. commi~ tments to<br />
expand the Robe River, Mt. Newman and Hammersley iron ore projects.<br />
$ 600 m. of new projects in the manufacturing sector were announced<br />
in the June quarter alone.<br />
We have laid the foundations for sustained economic recovery. We<br />
are breaking the back of inflation and in 1978 we can look to even<br />
further successes, so that our vast wealth of manpower, skill and<br />
resources can once again be utilised.<br />
one challenge which remains to be met is a major reduction in<br />
unemployment. It is true one can deduce from recent surveys made<br />
by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, that only a small percentage<br />
of the unemployed are family breadwinners; that ove-r 40% of persons<br />
unemployed left their last job voluntarily or for reasons other<br />
than dismissal or retrenchment; and that many people registered<br />
with the Commonwealth Employment Service in fact have a part-time<br />
or full-time job. / But this </p>
<p>4<br />
But this Government is vitally concerned for those who genuinely<br />
want work, and who cannot find jobs. There are too many Australians<br />
in this situation. We have already taken wide ranging action on<br />
this front. We have protected employment by giving Australian<br />
industry the protection it needs. Since December 1975, we have<br />
placed over 850,000 people in new jobs through the Commonwealth<br />
Employment Service. We have established or expanded manpower and<br />
training programmes, including a special youth employment<br />
training programme, the Community Youth Support Scheme, relocation<br />
assistance, and the C. R. A. F. T. scheme for apprenticeships.<br />
Over 100,000 people have benefited from these schemes, and more<br />
than $ 100 million has been provided to continue and expand them.<br />
Still more will be spent if necessary. No eligible unemployed person<br />
will be refused assistance under these schemes.<br />
In a time of economic recovery, employment is always the last<br />
factor to come right. Employers first use up existing spare capacity,<br />
and make more use of overtime. And when wage costs are high,<br />
productivity can often be increased more effectively by devising<br />
new management techniques, and purchasing labour saving equipment.<br />
But as inflation declines further, and demand increases, the present<br />
high levels of unemployment will go down. A more responsible union<br />
attitude would hasten the recovery in employment. Excessive wage<br />
increases have priced people out of jobs particularly young people<br />
and the unskilled.<br />
We have consistently sought to achieve wage restraint. We have<br />
had some success on this front but not nearly enough. / The rank </p>
<p>The rank and file unionist knows that excessive wage demands cost<br />
jobs. it is time that union leaders and shop stewards faced up to<br />
the facts. Unions also have a responsibility to prevent<br />
disruptive strikes which are a prime cause of unemployment.<br />
In Victoria alone, 450,000 people were laid off directly because<br />
of the destructive Victorian power strike. But it's not just a matter*<br />
of workers being temporarily stood down. A survey by the three<br />
major Victorian employer groups showed that as a consequence of the<br />
Victorian power strike, the number of workers who will be re-employed<br />
will be significantly fewer than the number of employees laid off.<br />
The extremist officials of a few key unions have set their face<br />
against conciliation and arbitration. They have engaged in a campaign<br />
of disruption in the key power, construction, mining and maritime<br />
industries. Look what the extremists are doing to Australia.<br />
Look at the construction industry, one of the most vital Australian<br />
industries from the point of view of providing jobs.<br />
Largely under the leadership of the Builders Laborers Federation<br />
last month projects worth $ 469 million had been halted or substantially<br />
disrupted. Look at the maritime industry, strike after strike,<br />
damaging businesses vital to Australian prosperity. Look at the<br />
constant stoppages and bans in the great mining projects in Western<br />
Australia and Queensland.<br />
The senseless economic damage, and distress to tens of thousands<br />
caused by the Victorian power strike have been condemned by all<br />
responsible commentators. But the silence from the Labor Party<br />
has been deafening. Surely the self-styled guardians of the<br />
working man should be vociferously attacking a campaign which strikes<br />
at a fundamental right, the right to work. But not once has any<br />
Labor spokesman offered one word of criticism, one word of regret.<br />
The reason is not hard to find. Men engineering the<br />
industrial disruption are leaders of unions with close affiliations<br />
with the Labor Party. Unions which are heard in the highest councils<br />
of Labor's policy making machinery. Yet we need to understand that<br />
a number of these men are avowed enemies of democracy and the<br />
Australian way of life.<br />
What has Mr. Whitlam said about this? Not a word. What has Mr. Hawke<br />
said about this has he repudiated these extremists? He has not.<br />
The fact is that Labor is too weak to resist the demands of the<br />
extremists. In fact their official policy is to place unions abdve<br />
the law.<br />
This Government is determined that the law shall prevail in industrial<br />
relations. No community can tolerate the exemption of one section of<br />
the community from the law. We certainly do not intend to tolerate<br />
it. We showed that in the air controllers strike, we showed that in<br />
the recent postal dispute. In the Victorian power dispute, it was<br />
the Commonwealth and Victorian Government's move to deregister the<br />
four unions involved that got Mr. Hawke and the strikers back to<br />
work. We -have </p>
<p>-6<br />
We have already passed new legislation to bring a greater measure<br />
to justice, order and common sense to industrial relations in this<br />
country. We have legislated for secret postal ballots for union<br />
elections. We have established the Industrial Relations Bureau as an<br />
independent agency to ensure that industrial law is observed. We<br />
have amended the Trade Practices Act to ban damaging secondary boycotts<br />
The Commonwealth and Queensland Governments will together use this<br />
legislation against the Seamen's Union campaign to damage the coal<br />
industry in Queensland. A campaign which has caused deferral of the<br />
quarter billion dollar Norwich Park project, and robbed hundreds of<br />
Australians of jobs. We have recently passed but not proclaimed the<br />
Commonwealth Employees ( Employment Provisions) Act 1977, strengthening<br />
the Government's power to stand down Commonwealth employees.<br />
Currently, the Postal Commission is being faced by bans at the Redfern<br />
and Newcastle mail exchanges, designed to prevent improvements which<br />
will render our postal services more efficient. Similarly, the<br />
Australian Telecommunications Employee Association is using bans<br />
clauses to prevent technological change, which will make for more<br />
efficient telephone services and which will help contain telephone<br />
charges. It is totally unacceptable that Commonwealth employees should<br />
expect full pay for doing only part of their job, for refusing to<br />
perform tasks essential to the operation of their employers.<br />
The Postal Commission already has stand down clauses and Telecom<br />
will be applying to the Arbitration Commission on Monday for the<br />
insertion of stand down clauses into their Act. If the bans continue,<br />
there is no doubt those stand down clauses will be applied. we hope<br />
it will not be necessary to proclaim the new Act, but if it is, we wi ll.<br />
We have done much in the area of industrial relations but more remains<br />
to be done. Tony Street will shortly introduce further industrial<br />
legislation. Its provisions cover three major areas. They will provide<br />
a wider range of consequences for the breach of industrial law,<br />
they will protect the rights of individual employees against oppressive<br />
acts by their own unions, and they will-for the first time enable<br />
strong and effective action to be taken under the Conciliation and<br />
Arbitration Act to deal with demarcation disputes.<br />
The decision has been taken after long and careful consideration with<br />
both employers and unions and through the processes of the NLCC. Tony<br />
Street has not yet had time to put them to the Party Committee or to<br />
the Party Room, but I have little doubt these changes will be supported.<br />
We have a record of achievement that has been made possible by the consistency<br />
and coherence the Liberal philosophy has given our programmes.<br />
We have acted to aid the disadvantaged and those in need, the introduction<br />
of the Family Allowance, the indexation of pensions and benefits,<br />
our new measures for the handicapped, are milestones in social reform.<br />
We have protected and enhanced individual rights, the Ombudsman, . the<br />
Administrative Appeals Tribunal, new simplified methods of reviewing<br />
bureaucratic decisions, legislation for a Human Rights Commission,<br />
amply demonstrate our concern to advance civil liberties.<br />
We have shown care and concern for Australia's ethnic minorities and<br />
the recently appointed Galbally inquiry into post arrival services<br />
for migrants will I believe provide a basis for a new deal for<br />
migrants in this country.<br />
We have enlarged people's ability to make the important decisions<br />
affecting their lives. Tax cuts allow Australians more say over how<br />
their own hard-earned income is spent. The Medibank reforms have<br />
restored choice in health insurance and our policies to assist the<br />
the Aboriginal communities give first priority to Aborigines<br />
participating in running their own programmes. / We have </p>
<p>We have ended the movement to concentrate more and more power in<br />
Canberra and shared power and responsibility with the States and<br />
local Government. We have ended the bias against the rural community<br />
which Labor deliberately introduced. Income equalization deposits,<br />
tax averaging and our other tax reforms have greatly helped to<br />
maintain incomes of ' rural producers during a period of depressed<br />
markets and rising costs.<br />
The wide range of measures to help rural industries in distress<br />
the recent package of assistance to the cattle industry and the<br />
decision to establish an Australian Rural Bank all demonstrate our<br />
determination to ensure the continued viability of our rural<br />
industries.<br />
Help has also been forthcoming for small business, a sector which<br />
embodies the spirit of independence and initiative so important<br />
to the health and vigour of our nation. Our tax concessions were<br />
consciously framed particularly to help small business and on<br />
Thursday, after the most intensive study we announced a range<br />
of measures to increase the availability of finance to small business.<br />
These achievements have been made possible through the unity of the<br />
Ministry, the strength of the Parliamentary Party, the loyal and<br />
strong support from our coalition partners. And the superb<br />
cooperation that has been built up under Federal Executive's<br />
guidance between the Federal organisation and the Parliamentary<br />
Party. The Government values highly the advice regularly given to us<br />
by the Economic. Advisory Committee and the. four specialist committees.<br />
Rural, manufacturing, tertiary industries and natural resources.<br />
The Joint Standing Committee on Federal Policy has met with sixteen<br />
federal ministers to review the Government's policies in their areas<br />
of responsibility. This has provided an invaluable stimulus for<br />
Ministers. The Federal Women's Committee and the Young Liberals<br />
have performed very important work for the Party, and have assisted<br />
the Government particularly in bringing forward possible new policy<br />
initiatives for consideration.<br />
The Federal Secretariat has never operated so effectively, or served<br />
so well the Government and Backbench Committees which have come to<br />
rely on its professionalism and expertise.<br />
The last 22 months have been difficult ones, and the overwhelming<br />
support given by the party to the Treasurer and the Government have<br />
been of inestimable value. Most of the commitments we made at the<br />
last election have already been fulfilled. In my 1975 election<br />
speech I made 51 specific promises, in less than two years, over<br />
have been fully implemented, 5 partially implemented and a<br />
further 10 are under implementation at the present time.<br />
We are now beginning to see the signs of a real turnaround in<br />
the Australian economy. Inflation is down, our balance of payments<br />
is far healthier interest rates are declining growth and development<br />
of this great country of ours have started once again. In 1975/ 76<br />
only $ 128 million in foreign investment came to Australia. In the<br />
year just ended over 6 times that figure, $ 826 million, flowed<br />
into the country. While we </p>
<p>While we have concentrated on getting the economy right, easing<br />
the crippling taxation burden, and restoring order and common<br />
sense to industry relations, we have also devoted much attention<br />
in making fundamental reforms to enhance the rights of individual<br />
Australians of minorities, of those in need. Our social reforms<br />
have been designed to advance the well being of all Australians,<br />
our law reforms have been designed to advance the liberty, the<br />
independence of all individuals.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, we have made a start, a strong start, in<br />
restoring Australia to prosperity. But our task has only just<br />
begun. At an earlier time in our history, Australia was regarded<br />
as one of the world's most advanced and enlightened liberal democracies.<br />
Our aim is nothing less than to restore Australia to that position of<br />
strength and pre-eminence. The challenges that face us are<br />
great, but the potentialities of our country are boundless.<br />
Together we can realise that potential.<br />
