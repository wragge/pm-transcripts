MIN4I STER IAL STATEMi41T<br />
BY THE PRIME M1HSTER<br />
MRa E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
HOUSE OF REPRESENITATIVES,<br />
THURSDAY 13 DECEMBER 197.3<br />
WE HAVE COME TO THE END OF A MOMENTOUS AND MEMORABLE<br />
YEAR IN THE LIFE OF THE AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT. JUST OVER<br />
12 MONTHS AGO THE FIRST NATIONAL LABOR GOVERNMENT IN<br />
23 YEARS WAS ELECTED TO OFFICE. THAT IN ITSELF WAS AN<br />
EVENT OF HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE. IHATEVER THE POLICIES OR<br />
ACTIONS OF THE NEW ADMINISTRATION, A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT<br />
AFTER SUCH A PROTRACTED INTERVAL OF CONSERVATIVE RULE WAS<br />
BOUND TO BRING NEW IDEAS AND FRESH DIRECTIONS TO OUR<br />
NATIONAL LIFE, TO CHALLENGE OLD ASSUMPTIONS AND STALE<br />
HABITS OF MIND, TO INVIGORATE THE WHOLE CLIMATE OF POLITICAL<br />
DEBATE IN THIS COUNTRY. SO IT HAS PROVED. FOR ALL OF US<br />
IN THIS PARLIAMENT IT HAS BEEN A UNJIQUELY ARDUOUS AND EXACTING<br />
YEAR. FOR MY COLLEAGUES IN THE LABOR GOVERNMENT IT HAS !; EEN<br />
A YEAR OF IMMENSE EXCITEMENlT AND UNREMITTING ACTIVITY.<br />
FOR THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE FOR THIS COUNTRY.-IT HAS BEEN<br />
A YEAR OF PROGRESS AND REFORM ON A SCALE UNMATCHED IN THE<br />
RECORDS OF THIS FEDERATION. v 1 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
I HOPE THOSE WORDS WILL N'OT BE TAKEN AS AN EMPTY BOAST.<br />
I iELIEVE THE RECORD OF THE 6OVERNMENT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.<br />
ANYONE WHO STUDIES THAT RECORD IMPARTIALLY AS I NOW INVITE<br />
THE HOUSE TO DO WILL ACCEPT THE EVIDENCE OF A PRODIGIOUS<br />
LEGISLATIVE ACHIEVEMENT. TODAY I WANT-TO BRING TOGETHER<br />
THE MAIN ELEMENTS OF THAT ACHIEVEMENT AND IDENTIFY THE<br />
CONSISTENT PHILOSOPHY -THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES THAT<br />
LIE BEHIND ALL WE HAVE DONE AND ALL WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DO.<br />
I REMIND THE HOUSE OF THIS: NOTHING WE HAVE DONE IN THESE<br />
EVENTFUL MONTHS CAN BE SAID TO HAVE BEEN UNEXPECTED OR<br />
UNPREDICTABLE. OUR POLICIES WERE FORMULATED OVER MANY YEARS.<br />
THE MOST IMPORTAN'T OF THEM WERE PUT TO THE PEOPLE NOT ONCE,<br />
BUT TWICE. WE HAVE DONE NOTHING THAT WE DID NOT PROMISE TO<br />
DO, WE HAVE iJONE WHAT THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE CHARGED US TO DO<br />
WHEN THEY CONFERRED UPON US THEIR MANDATE IN LECEMBER LAST YEAR.<br />
MY POLICY SPEECH FOR THE LAST ELECTIONS STANDS, UNQUALIFIED<br />
AND UNDIMINISHED, AS THE RECORD OF THIS GOVERNMENT'IS ACTIVITIES<br />
IN THE PAST YEAR AND ITS MANIFLE3TO FOR THIE YEARS TO COME.<br />
I DO NOT PRETEND THAT THE YEAR HAS 3EEN PLAIN SAILING.<br />
OF COURSE IT HAS NOT. THERE IS MUCH IN OUR PROGRAM THAT WE<br />
HAVE YET TO ACCOMPLISH;~ MANY OF OUR PLANS ARE STILL IN THEIR<br />
FORMATIVE OR EMj3RYOWIC STAGES. THIERE IS MUCH, REGRETTABLY,<br />
THAT WE HAVE BEEN PREVENTED FROM DOING OR jARINGING TO FRUITION.<br />
IF THE YEAR HAS REVEALED CLEARLY THE NATURE AND PURPOSES OF THE<br />
GOVERNMENT, IT HAS ALSO REVEALED EVEN MORE NAKEDLY, MORE<br />
UNMISTAK( ABLY THE NATURE AND PURPOSES OF THE OPPOSIKfON. i o/ 3 </p>
<p>I SHALL GIVE THE HOUSE PRESENTLY THE DETAILED EVIDENCE<br />
OF THE SENATE'S OESTRUCTION. I DCUBT WHETHER AiY OF<br />
US CAN RECALL AN OPPOSITION THAT HAS iEHAVED WITH SUCM<br />
RECKLESS AND IRRESPONSILLE INDIFFERENCE TO THE PEOPLE' S<br />
WILL, WE HAVE SEEN IN THE SENATE A PATTERN. OF FLATANT<br />
OBSTRUCTION, OF FLAGRANT DEFIANCE OF A POPULAR MANDATE<br />
CONFERRED FY THE PEOPLE ON AN ELECTED GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE<br />
TOO OFTEN SEEN IN THIS HOUSE A PATTERN OF ROWDINESS, OF DELAY,<br />
OF UNRULINESS, OF PERSISTENT ATTEMPTS TO BAIT THE CHAIR Ah-D<br />
FRUSTRATE THE BUSINESS OF THE PARLIAMENT, WE HAVE<br />
CONTENDED WITH DINOSAURS IN ONE PLACE AND SCHOOLPOYS IN<br />
THE OTHER. YET BY LONG HOURS AND HARD WORK WE HAVE DEALT<br />
WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED VOLUME OF BUSINESS IN THIS PARLIAMENT.<br />
SOME IDEA OF TIHE SCALE OF OUR LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM WILL<br />
BE SEEN FROM THE STATISTICS OF LILLS PASSED AND INTRODUCED.<br />
SINCE THE 28TH PARLIAMENT ASSEMLED ON 27 FEPRUARY A TOTAL OF<br />
253 BILLS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED. THAT FIGURE SURPASSES ALL<br />
RECORDS. THE NEAREST APPROACH TO IT WAS 1b9 " ILLS IN 1968,.<br />
THE PARLIAMENT HAS PASSED 203 OF THE EILLS INTRODUCED THIS YLR,<br />
THE SIZE OF THAT ACCOMPLISHMENT l'ILL IE SEEN MORE CLEARLY FROM<br />
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PAGES OF LEGISLATION DEALT WITH BY TiE<br />
PARLIAMENT IN EACH OF THE PAST SIX YEARS. IN 1968EXCLUDING<br />
CUSTOMS TARIFF SCHEDULES, THE PARLIAMEhT PASSED 775 PAGES<br />
OF LEGISLATION. THERE ARE q81 PAGES IN 19Q, 660 PAGES<br />
IN 1970; 872 PAGES IN 1971, AND 707 PAGES IN 1972.<br />
THIS YEAR THE BILLS INTRODUCED CONTAINED MORE THAN 2200 PAGES,<br />
ROUGHLY THREE TIMES THE TOTAL LAST YEAR, I KNOW WHAT A HEAVY<br />
BURDEN THAT WORK HAS IMPOSED ON MEMBERS AND I AM GRATEFUL FOR<br />
THE WAY THEY HAVE BORNE IT. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN MEASURE THE VOLUME<br />
OF PARLIAMENT4RY AND GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY. SINCE FEBRUARY THIS<br />
YEAR 39 REPORTS ON INQUIRIES INSTITUTED BY THE GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN<br />
PRESENTED TO THE PARLIAMENT, NOT INCLUDING REPORTS FROM<br />
PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES OR REPORTS OF INQUIRIES INSTITUTED BY<br />
THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT. THERE HAVE BEEN' 19. STATEMENTS AND<br />
COMMUNIQUES TABLED ON MEETINGS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH STATE<br />
GOVERNMENTS. SIX CONSTITUTION ALTERATION BILLS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED<br />
TO THE PARLIAMENT, THE TEXTS OF 39 TREATIES AND AGREEMENTS WITH<br />
OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN PRESENTED. BETWEEN JANUARY AND NOVEMBER<br />
THIS YEAR THE CABINET ITSELF MADE A TOTAL OF 1675 DECISIONS,<br />
WHATEVER MAY BE THOUGHT OF THIS GOVERNMENT, NOT EVEN ITS WORST<br />
ENEMIES CAN CLAIM IT HAS BEEN IDLE.<br />
GREAT AS OUR LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM HAS BEEN, THE<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER CURTAILED OR DISRUPTED THE SMOOTH<br />
PROCEEDINGS OF THE HOUSE OR TRESPASSED ON THE RIGHTS OF MEMBERS.<br />
INDEED, THE RECORD WILL SHOW THAT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A YEAR<br />
WHEN PRIVATE MEMBERS HAVE HAD MORE OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE MATTERS<br />
IN THE HOUSE AND HAVE THEM DEBATED FULLY. THE HOUSE HAS SAT<br />
FOR A TOTAL OF 908 HOURS UP TO LUNCHTIME TODAY. THE GREATEST<br />
NUMBER OF SITTING HOURS IN ONE YEAR FOR MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY.<br />
AMONG THE PARLIAMENTS OF THE WORLD, ONLY THE HOUSE OF COMMONS<br />
OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE HOUSE OF COMMONS OF. CANADA HAVE SAT<br />
FOR LONGER HOURS THIS YEAR. </p>
<p>YET WE HAVE ONLY SAT ONCE AFTER 11 PM. THE EXHAUSTING<br />
FARCE OF SITTING INTO THE SMALL HOURS, ITS INTOI. ERABLE TOLL<br />
ON THE EFFICIENCY AND DIGNITY OF THE PARLIAMENT. HAS-. IEEN<br />
ABOLISHED. WE HAVE ALLOWED 70 DEBATES ON THE ADJOURNME'T<br />
THE GREATEST NUMBER ON RECORD. WE HAVE NEVER ONCE CURTAILED<br />
OR SUSPENDED DEPATE ON GE1NERAL BUSINESS, AND EVERYMATTER<br />
RAISED BY A PRIVATE MEMBER HAS BEEN DEBATED AND. VOTED UPON.<br />
THE GREAT THEME OF OUR LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM HAS BEEN<br />
ONE OF. REFORM AND RENOVATION. WE RECOGNISED FROM THE BEGINNING<br />
THAT THE REFORMS WE WERE SEEKING FOR AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY<br />
FOR A MORE JUST AND HUMANE AUSTRALIANI SOCIETY WOULD BE<br />
POSSIBLE ONLY THROUGH REFORMS IN TIJE STRUCTURE OF GOVERNMENT<br />
ITSELF. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE ORGANISATION OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC SERVICE WERE ESSENTIAL TO PROVIDE THE<br />
ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM.<br />
THAT WAS OUR FIRST TASK. WE SET ABOUT IT WITH VIGOUR<br />
AND DETERMINATION. WE CREATED NEW DEPARTMENTS OF URBAN AND<br />
REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT, ABORIGINAt. AFFAIRS, ENVIRONMENT AND<br />
CONSERVATION, TOURISM AND RECREATION, MINERALS AND ENERGY<br />
AND THE MEDIA TO ADMINISTER I4IOLE AREAS OF POLICY THAT<br />
HAD BEEN NEGLECTED OR DOWNGRADED IN THE PAST, OUR PROGRAM<br />
DID NOT MEAN SIMPLY A NEW EMPHASIS HERE OR A LITTLE EXTRA<br />
MONEY THERE. IT MEANT A NEW AND RADICAL ASSESSMENT OF OUR<br />
SOCIAL PRIORITIES AND GOALS. TO HAVE WORKED WITHIN THE<br />
ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK OF OUR PREDECESSORS WOULD HAVE MEANT,<br />
IN LARGE MEASURE, ACCEPTING THE VALUES AND PRIORITIES OF OUR<br />
PREDFCES ORS. 4E WERE r'.! OT PREPARED TO DO SO. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
OUR ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES WERE MADE IN TWO STAGES,<br />
THE FIRST STAGE WAS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS<br />
FROM 27 TO 37. QUALIFIED EXPERTS FROM OUTSIDE THE PUBLIC<br />
SERVICE WERE BROUGHT IN AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. I MENTION<br />
A FEW MR. JAMES OSWIN IN THE DEPARTMENT OF. THE MEDIA,<br />
DR. DON MCMICHAEL IN THE NEW DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT<br />
AND CONSERVATION; fMRS. MARIE COLEMAN AS HEAD OF. THE NEW<br />
AUSTRALIAN COMMISSION ON SOCIAL WELFAREI MR. CHARLES<br />
ALTON IN THE AMALGAMATED DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT.<br />
AT THE SAME TIME WE FOUND IT POSSIBLE TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY<br />
AND EFFECT ECONOMIES BY MERGIIIG SOME DEPARTMENTS AND<br />
REDUCING THE FUNCTIONS OF OTHERS. THUS, IN THE SECOND STAGE<br />
OF OUR ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS, l" E REDUCED THE NUMBER OF<br />
DEPARTMENTS FROM 37 TO 31. WE MERGED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENTS<br />
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFEMC-. AND CIVIL AVIATION WITi4 TRANSPORT.<br />
WE COMBINED THE DEPARTMENTS OF HOUSING AND WORKS AS A SIJNGLE<br />
DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND CONSTRUCTION. THE DEPARTMENT OF<br />
EXTERNAL TERRITORIES WAS ABOLISHED. I COMMEND UNRESERVEDLY<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN PUBL. IC SERVICE FOR THE PROMPT AND EFFICIENT<br />
WAY IT HAS ADAPTED TO THESE CHANGES. THE PUBLIC SERVICE<br />
HAS RESPONDED TO THE GOVERNMENI'T'S HEAVY DEMANDS WITH<br />
IMMENSE PROFESSIONAL SKILL AND DEDICATION. / 7 </p>
<p>7<br />
OUR CHANGES AND REFORMS, HOWEVER, DID NOT END WITH<br />
THE RESTRUCTURING OF GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS. qE HAVE ARMED<br />
THE ADMINISTRATIVE MACHINE WITH NEW FUNCTIONS AND ORGANISATIONS<br />
TO DEAL WITH THE INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT PROILEMS<br />
OF PLANNING FOR THE NEEDS OF A GROPING INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY.<br />
SOME OF THE ORGANISATIONS HAVE BEE; GIVEN PERMAIENT<br />
STATUTORY FORM, SUCH AS THE SCHOOLS COMMISSION, THE SOCIAL<br />
'.' ELFARE COMMITTEE, THE PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL AND THE<br />
PIPELINE AUTHORITY; OTHERS HAVE HAD. THEIR STATUTORY<br />
CHARTER UTTERLY TRANSFORMED, SUCH AS THE CRAINTS COMMISSIOl,<br />
THE CITIES COMMISSION AND THE INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE COMMISSION.<br />
IN ADDITION SPECIAL TASK FORCES HAVE BEEN SET UP TO DEAL WITH<br />
SPECIFIC AREAS OF POLICY AND PLANNING. 10 FEVER THAN 01<br />
COMMISSIONS OR COMMITTEES OF INCUIRY WERE ESTALLISHED<br />
THIS YEAR. THE BEST KI! OIl OF THEM, PERHAPS, l" AS THE 00, M1lS<br />
TASK FORCE, WHICH REPORTED TO US ON THE PREVIOUS GOVERNME-; T'S<br />
EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS AND RECOMMENDED ECONOMIES It! THEM.<br />
iO0 OTHER GOVERNMENT IN AUSTRALIA HAS APPLIED SUCH A SEARCHING<br />
SCRUTINY TO THE EXPENDITURE OF PUBLIC MONEY. IN ADDITION,<br />
MINISTERS HAVE DRAWN ON THE SERVICES OF CONSULTANTS AND<br />
OUTSIDE ADVISERS. ' VE HAVE ESTABLISHED A ! WHOLLY NEW INSTRUMENT<br />
TO PROVIDE LONG-TERM ADVICL ON PUBLIC PRIORITIES A<br />
" THINK TANK' WHICH WE HAVE NAMED THE PRIORITIES PEVIE-l STAFF.<br />
I BELIEVE WE CAN NOW CLAIM THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNME T IS<br />
EQUIPPED WITH THE MOST MODERN, EXPERT AND COMPREHENSIVE<br />
ADMINISTRATIVE MACHINERY EVER SEEN IN AUSTRALIA. ,/ I </p>
<p>I WANT TO SUMMARISE FOR HOHOURABLE MEiBERS THE MAIN<br />
LEGISLATION AND POLICY DECISIONS THE GOVERNMENT HAS INITIATED<br />
IN THE PAST YEAR. LET ME DEAL WITH Tl ' O BASIC PRINCIPLES COMMON<br />
TO ALL OUR PROGRAMS. THE TWO GREAT AND GUIDING THEMES OF<br />
THIS % VERNMENT HAVE BEEN THE PROMOTION OF EQUAL OPPORTUNITY<br />
FOR OUR PEOPLE AND THE PROMOTION OF AUSTRALIAN OWNERSHIP AND<br />
CONTROL OF OUR INDUSTRIES ANID RESOURCES.<br />
4E ALONE HAVE PROCLAIMED ArND FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHT OF<br />
AUSTRALIANS TO PARTICIPATE TO THE FULLEST POSSIFLE EXTENT IN<br />
THEIR OWN INDUSTRIES. i,' E ALONE HAVE PROCLAIMED AND FOUGHT FOR<br />
TIE RIGHT OF AUSTRALIANS TO OV'N AND CONTROL THE PRECIOUS<br />
RESOURCES OF THIS CONTINENT. IS THERE ANYTHING STRANGE OR<br />
UNNATURAL ABOUT THESE RIGHTS? HOW OFTEN DID<br />
WE HEAR THEM EXPRESSED OR ARTICULATED UNDER OUR PREDECESSORS?<br />
HotO OFTEN DID OUR PREDECESSORS TAKE FIRM OR DECISIVE ACTION<br />
TO SAFEGUARD THEM? ' iE SEEK FOR THE AUSTRAL. IAN PEOPLE A GREATER<br />
PARTICIPATION IN THE DESTINY OF THIS COUNTRY. 1dE SEEK FOR ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES TO SHARE IN THAT DESTINY<br />
AND TO LIVE THEIR LIVES WITH THE HIGHEST MEASURE OF MATERIAL<br />
SECURITY AND lELL-IBEING AND 1" 1T! THE HIGHEST MEASURE OF<br />
INTELLECTUAL AND SPIRITUAL FULFILMENT. </p>
<p>9-<br />
WHEN I SPEAK OF EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY I AM NOT THINKING<br />
SIMPLY OF THE REMOVAL OF POVERTY OR THE REDRESS OF OBVIOUS<br />
INJUSTICES SUCH AS THOSE IN EDUCATION OR HEALTH. THE EVIDENCE<br />
OF UNEQUAL OPPORTUNITY IS TO BE FOUND AT ALL LEVELS, IN ALL<br />
AREAS OF SOCIETY. WE ARE PLEDGED, FOR EXAMPLE, TO GIVE GREATER<br />
EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY TO WOMEN, WHO HAVE LONG BEEN DISADVANTAGEDOFTEN<br />
IN SUBTLE AND HIDDEN WAYS IN A MALE-ORIE* NTED. SOCIETY.<br />
No GOVERNMENT HAS DONE MORE FOR THE WELFARE OF'WOMEN AND I<br />
DO NOT MEAN SIMPLY WOMEN IN NEED OR WOMEN IN OBVIO US HARDSHIP.<br />
SIMILARLY, WE ARE PLEDGED. TO GIVE EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY TO<br />
ABORIGINALS;-NO GOVERNMENT HAS DONE MORE FOR THE ABORIGINALS<br />
OF THIS COUNTRY. FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY ARE REPRESENTED<br />
IN AN ELECTED CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL WHICH CAN DEAL DIRECTLY WITH<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT. AGAIN, WE ARE PLEDGED TO GIVE EQUAL<br />
OPPORTUNITIES TO MIGRANTS; NO GOVERNMENT HAS DONE MORE FOR<br />
MIGRANTS. THESE ARE NOT IDLE OR PIOUS ASSERTIONS. THE<br />
EVIDENCE OF ALL WE HAVE DONE IS ABUNDANT AND MANIFEST IN THE<br />
RECORDS OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. IT WILL STAND, PROUD A'ND<br />
UNCHALLENGED, IN THE STATUTES OF THIS COUNTRY.<br />
N~ O ONE DISPUTES THAT WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR EDUCATION<br />
IS PRODIGIOUS IN SCALE AND REVOLUTIONARY IN CONCEPTION.<br />
WE HAVE INCREASED FEDERAL SPE1NDING ON EDUCATION BY WELL OVER<br />
WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AN EXPERT AND INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS<br />
COMMISSION TO BRING SANITY AND JUSTICE TO THE WHOLE PROCESS<br />
OF ASSISTANCE TO PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS. WE HAVE<br />
GIVEN A NEW DEAL TO THE CHILDREN OF AUSTRALIA. IT IS HERE<br />
THAT THE FORCE AND SINCERITY OF OUR COMMITMENT TO EQUAL. OPPORTUNITY<br />
IS MOST CLEARLYSEEN AND READILY TESTED. IT -IS A TEST ALSO<br />
FOR OUR OPPONENTS. </p>
<p>10<br />
IT IS A TEST THAT MOST OF THEM HAVE FAILED, HOW STRIKING<br />
IT IS, HOW REVEALING, HOW SALUTARY A LESSON FOR THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
PEOPLE, THAT THE TWO AREAS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY MOST<br />
FUNDAMENTAL TO THE PEOPLE'S NEEDS AND ASPIRATIONS EDUCATION<br />
AND HEALTH ARE THE VERY AREAS WHERE OUR OPPONENTS HAVE<br />
RESISTED OUR REFORMS WITH THE GREATEST DETERMINATION,<br />
NOTHING REVEALS MORE CLEARLY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN . US<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S FORTHRIGHT COMMITMENT TO EQUALITY,<br />
THE OPPOSITION'S REARGUARD DEFENCE OF INEQUALITY AND<br />
PRIVILEGE. I ASK THE HOUSE TO EXAMINE IN DETAIL THE RECORD OF<br />
THE OPPOSITION, HERE AND IN THE SENATE. LET US LOOK AT THE<br />
BILLS TiEY HAVE BLOCKED AND DELAYED AND FRUSTRATED AND<br />
AMENDED. LET US LOOK FOR THE COMMON THEME IN ALL THEIR<br />
OBSTRUCTIVE TACTICS. THE OPPOSITION MAY LACK A COMMON<br />
VOICE, BUT IT IS NOT WITHOUT A COMMON CAUSE. THAT CAUSE<br />
IS THE DEFENCE OF VESTED INTERESTS. / 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
MIND YOU, I CONFESS THAT I SOMETIMES FIND IT<br />
DIFFICULT TO TELL WHICH OF THEIR SPOKESMAN, THEIR LEADERS,<br />
SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION<br />
WOULD AGREE THAT THERE ARE MORE BLUE-TAILED FLIES IN THE<br />
SENATE THAN HERE. -ON ONE VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE BEFORE<br />
THIS PARLIAMENT THE INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE BILL' ' THE COUNTRY<br />
PARTY VOTED AGAINST THE LEGISLATION WHILE THE. LIBERAL. PARTY<br />
SUPPORTED IT. ON THE QUESTION OF GRANTS TO SCHOOLS, THE<br />
LIBERAL PARTY VOTED AGAINST THE MEASURE WHILE THE CbUNTRY<br />
PARTY SUPPORTED IT. VIE WILL BE FORGIVEN FOR FEELING SOME<br />
CONFUSION. IN THE PAST YEAR THE SENATE HAS REJECTED 13 B. ILLS,<br />
DEFERRED ANOTHER 10 OF WHICH SIX REMAIN SHELVED, AND AMENDED<br />
21. I LIST THE 13 BILLS IT HAS REJECTED UP TILL TODAY:<br />
COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL TWO BILLS; CONCILIATION AND<br />
ARBITRATION:-REPRESENTATION TWO BILLS; SENATE ( REPRESENTATION<br />
OF TERRITORIES) TWO BILLS; LANDS ACQUISITION ( AUSTRALIAN<br />
CAPITAL TERRITORY): SEAS AND SULDMERGED LANDS ( ROYALTY ON M1INERALS);<br />
CONSTITUTION ALTERATION ( DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS); CONSTITUTION<br />
ALTERATION ( LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES); HEALTH INSURANCE;<br />
AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION. IN DEFENCE OF THEIR<br />
WEALTHY FRIENDS AND VESTED INTERESTS, THEY HAVE REJECTED THE<br />
DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL ELECTORATES; THEY HAVE BLOCKED<br />
ATTEMPTS TO DEMOCRATISE AND MODERNISE THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT:<br />
THEY HAVE DENIED REPRESENTATION IN4 THE SENATE TO THE PEOPLE<br />
OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY AND THE AUSTRALIAN CAPTIAL TERRITORY; </p>
<p>1?<br />
THEY HAVE SOUGHT TO DENY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT DIRECT ACCESS<br />
TO NAFIONAL REVENUES AND BORROWINGS; THEY HAVE PRESERVED<br />
FOR FOREIGN MINING INTERESTS THE RIGHT TO EXPLOIT OUR<br />
OFF-SHORE RESOURCES; THEY HAVE PRESERVED THE INEQUITY,<br />
INH~(. IHCYAND INJUSTICE OF AN ANTIQUATED HEALTH SCHEME.<br />
BY SHELVING THE TRADE PFACT~ cEs-BILL THEY HAVE<br />

SATrELLI TE IN V! ORLD AFFAIRS. WE ARE NO LONGER STAMPED WITH THE / 13 </p>
<p>13<br />
TAINT OF RACISM. WE ARE NO LONGER A COLONIAL POWER. WE<br />
ARE NO LONGER OUT OF STEP WITH THE WORLD'S PROGRESSIVE<br />
AND ENLIGHTENED MOVEMENTS TOWARDS FREEDOM, DISARMAMENT AND<br />
CO-OPERATION. WE ARE NO LONGER IN THRALL TO BOGIES AND<br />
OBSESSIONS IN OUR RELATIONS WITH CHINA OR THE GREAT POWERS.<br />
WE HAVE STRENGTHENED OLD FRIENDSHIPS AND ESTABLISHED NEW ONES.<br />
IN NO FIELD IN ITS FIRST YEAR OF OFFICE HAS MY<br />
GOVERNMENT SO PROFOUNDLY, SO BENEFICIALLY, AND LET ME<br />
BE QUITE CLEAR SO SUCCESSFULLY ESTABLISHED NEW PERSPECTIVES<br />
AS. IN AUSTRALIA'S FOREIGN POLICIES. THAT THIS HAS BEEN SO<br />
WAS FIRST OF ALL THE RESULT OF THE BITTER DISTORTIONS INTO<br />
WHICH OUR PREDECESSORS HAD FORCED AUSTRALIA'S POLICIES, THE<br />
INJUSTICES THEY DID TO THE GREAT MASS OF DECENT AUSTRALIANS<br />
IN A SHORT-SIGHTED PURSUIT OF POLICIES AS UGLY AS THEY WERE<br />
OUTDATED, AS NARROWLY CONCEIVED AS THEY WERE EQUIVOCAL.<br />
IF ANYTHING CAME TO AN END ON DECEMBER 2 THE ANNIVERSARY OF<br />
AUSTERLITZ LAST YEAR IT WAS THE DEMEANING OF AUSTRALIA IN<br />
THE EYES OF THE WORLD AS THE COUNTRY OUR PREDECESSORS HAD<br />
REPRESENTED IT TO BE: INSIGNIFICANT, RACIST, MILITARIST,<br />
SYCOPHANTIC, A TIMID AND UNWORTHY CREATURE OF THE GREAT POWERS<br />
TO WHOM IT HAD SURRENDERED ITS IDENTITY, AUSTRALIA IS NO<br />
LONGER THOUGHT OF IN THOSE WAYS: IF I TAKE PRIDE IN THAT IT<br />
IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE UGLY AUSTRALIA OF THE PAST DID<br />
AN UNFORGIVABLE VIOLENCE TO THE WAY IN WHICH ORDINARY<br />
AUSTRALIANS. THOUGHT OF THEMSELVES, AND TO THE WAY THEY HOPED<br />
THEIR GOVERNMENT WOULD ACT IN ITS DEALINGS WITH THE REST OF THE<br />
WORLD. </p>
<p>THERE HAVE BEEN GREAT CHANGES. HlY GOVERNMENT<br />
IS UNEQUIVOCAL IN ITS BELIEF IN THE EQUALITY OF MEN OF ALL<br />
RACES: WE HAVE PROCLAIMED THAT BELIEF AND HAVE CON'SISTENTLY<br />
ACTED) IN ACCORDANCE WITH IT. My GoVEIRNMENT BELIEVES THE WAR<br />
IN VIETNAM WAS A BITTER DISASTER, THE END RESULT OF THE<br />
SQUANDERING OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEACE PRESENTED TWO DECADES<br />
AGO. lI! E SHALL HAVE NO MORE VIETNAMS, AND WE SHALL-DO ALL IN<br />
OUR POWER TO PROMOTE THE FORCES FOR PEACE IN OUR REGION AND<br />
THE WORLD. ABOVE ALL my GOVERNMENT BELIEVES IN THOUE ABIDING<br />
VIRTUES IN AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY WHICH HAVE GIVEN US A<br />
DISTINCTIVE NATIONHOOD, THE BELIEF IN FRATERNITY AND INDEPENDENCE,<br />
THE INSTINCT FOR FAIR PLAY, JUSTICE AND FREEDOM THAT EUREKA<br />
SIGNIFIES. IT IS THOSE VIRTUES WHICH AUSTRALIA' S FOREIGN<br />
POLICIES HAVE SOUGHT TO EMBODY OVER THE LAST YEAR: IT is<br />
THAT INDEFE: NDENCE WHICH my GOVERNMENT HAS CELEBRATED AND REVIVED.<br />
IN SPITE OF MANY CHANGES CERTAIN THINGS ABIDE:<br />
AIUSTRALIA'S INTERESTS HAVE NOT CHANGED, ONLY THE WAY IN WHICH<br />
MOST AUSTRALIANS PERCEIVE THEM. THE GOVERNMENT ACCEPTS ITS<br />
BASIC RESPONSIBILITY TO CREATE FOR THE PEOPLE OF AuSTRALIA A<br />
SECURE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY CAN MAINTAIN AND DEVELOP THEIR<br />
i, ELFARE FREE FROM FEAR, THREATS OR ARTIFICIAL CONSTRAINTS<br />
WHETHER INTERNALLY OR EXTERNALLY INSPIRED OR CONTRIVED. THAT<br />
TASK WILL BE MORE READILY PURSUED, MORE EASILY ATTAINABLE<br />
FROM NOW ON THAN WAS EVER POSSIBLE BEFORE. THE-* GOVERNMENT<br />
RECOGNISES THAT NO SOCIETY CAN PROGRESS IF IT RESTS ONLY ON THE<br />
ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PAST. IBELIEVE WE HAVE REACHED A MORE<br />
SANE AND EQUITABLE BALANCE WITH THE COUNTRIES OF IMPORTANCE TO<br />
US IN THE WO0k~ i ' iHAN A'l AN'i TIMlE IN THlE PAST, BUT IT IS OF THE<br />
NATURE OF OUR TASK THAT IT CONTINUES WITH ITS IMPORTANCE<br />
UNDIMINISHED. ILI L </p>
<p>15<br />
I INVITE THE HOUSE AND THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE TO<br />
COMPARE THIS GOVERNMENT WITH ITS PREDECESSOR, TO COMPARE THIS<br />
GOVERNMENT WITH THE TIRED, RESENTFUL, NAGGING AND SQUABBLING<br />
RABBLE WHO OPPOSE US IN THIS PARLIAMENT. WHO CAN-DOUBT THE<br />
IMPORTANCE AND THE URGENCY OF ALL WE SEEK TO'DO, THE IDEALISM<br />
OF OUR MOTIVES, THE RELEVANCE OF OUR RLFORMS TO A BETTER AND MORE<br />
SECURE AND PROSPEROUS LIFE FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS? ' WHO CAN DOUBT<br />
THE TRIVIALITY, THE SELF-SEEKING BITTERNESS, THE PETTY<br />
METHODS OF OBSTRUCTION AND REACTION THAT MOTIVATE OUR OPPONENTS?<br />
WHO CAN DOUBT THAT AUSTRALIA IS NOW MORE RESPECTED AND ADMIRED<br />
IN THE WORLD-BY ITS FRIENDS AN4D NEIGHBOURS? WHO CAN DOUBT<br />
THAT THERE IS A NEW SPIRIT OF ACTIVITY, OF EXCITEMENT, OF<br />
ADVENTURE IN OUR LIVES?<br />
WE DO NOT REGARD THE GOVERNMENT OF THIS COUNTRYAS<br />
OUR OPPONENTS REGARD IT AS A DIVINE RIGHT, A PRIVILEGE<br />
THAT IS OURS TO ENJOY IN PF-Ri-LTUIY. WE REGARD IT AS A TRUST<br />
FROM THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE. ' VE SEE NO POINT IN ACCEPTING THAT<br />
TRUST IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DISCHARGE IT FULLY AND WHOLEHEARTEDLY,<br />
I GIVE THIS ASSURANCE TO THE I-ARLIAMENT AND THE PEOPLE: WE , IiLL<br />
CARRY ON WITH OUR TASK, WE WILL NOT SHIRK OUR REFPONSIBILITIES.<br />
WE W1JLL CONTIN'UE TO W~ ORK: &amp; OikA" MORE JUJ i AND PROSPERO~ US AND<br />
ENLIGHTENED NATION. IN THIS FIRST YEAR OF THE LABCR GOVERNMENT<br />
WE HAVE MADE GREAT AND LASTING PROGRESS TOWARDS OUR GOALS,<br />
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY OF THE MAJOR REFORMS'WE HAVE ACHIEVED<br />
WILL EVER BE REVERSED OR ABANDONED. AFTER ALL THE CARPING AND<br />
NIGGLING, BACKING AND FILLING BY THE OPPOSITION, THE CHANGES<br />
WE HAVE MADE WILL REMAIN LIKE ALL GREAT LABOR LEGISLATIONPERMANENT<br />
LANDMARKS IN OUR HISTORY. THE YEAR AHEAD WILL BE / 1 F </p>
<p>16<br />
ANOTHER YEAR OF PROGRESS AND ACHIEVEMENT. I AM CONFIDElTI<br />
THAT THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE WHEN NEXT THEY ARE ASKED TO<br />
CHOOSE BETWEEN THE ALTERNATIVES BEFORE THEM WILL ENDORSE<br />
OUR RECORD AND RENEW OUR MANDATE, </p>
