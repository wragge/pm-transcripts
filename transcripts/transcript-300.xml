SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES<br />
AT THE OPENING OF THE MAUJSON INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY OF<br />
ADELAIDE. SATURDAY. lTH APRIL. 1961.<br />
Sir, ladies and gentlemen,<br />
This is a very, very notable occasion. I would have<br />
hoped that the reason for it were known to everybody in<br />
Australia, and in particular the younger prople of Australia,<br />
because this is one of these occasions when we say " Let us nor<br />
praise famous men".<br />
Indeed we are met here to think about and to talk<br />
about one of the very greatest Australians that this count2y<br />
has had. I think it is one of the ironies of life, at least of<br />
contemporary life, that if you were to say to the average<br />
citizen, " Who are the best known people?" he would at once thin'n:<br />
in terms of headlines. The footballers wo'uld come first; anu.<br />
the cricketers would come second; and the politicians a most<br />
honourable third; and the rest nowhere. This has always so. c; i.<br />
to me to be something of a monstrosity. Never more do I think<br />
that than when we are here to think about Douglas Mawson and<br />
his character and his achievements and his enormous stature,<br />
not only in our own country, but in the world one of the very<br />
greatest of Australians.<br />
That greatness, Sir was a versatile one. He was, of<br />
course, a great explorer; but he was a great scientist. I<br />
have marvelled as I have, as a non-scientist, struggled to<br />
understand something about his work. I have marvelled at the<br />
enormous amount of scientific work that he did, the<br />
investigations that he conducted, the things that he worked out,<br />
the things that he published. He was first and foremost, I<br />
think, a great and versatile scientist.<br />
I don't want to say anything that might subtract from<br />
his repute, but in the highest sense of the wford he was<br />
something of a politician; or shall I put it, ' he was<br />
something of a statesman'? Because with all his science and<br />
with all his exploration, it was he more than anybody else who<br />
added to the territory and responsibilities of this country,<br />
millions of square miles of Antarctic territory.<br />
That, of course, from a scientific point of view may<br />
be regarded as something of an eccentricity. But from the<br />
point of view of Australia it was an uncoLunon thing for a man<br />
in the very middle of exploration, and of investigation, to<br />
feel that he had a duty to his own country to extend the<br />
responsibilities and interests of his own country. If today we<br />
look at a map of the world and see certain areas marked out as<br />
Australian Antarctica, there may be some in the world who don't<br />
agree with it, and some who are perhaps agnostic on the point.<br />
But never let us forget that when we ourselves see these areas<br />
marked out, there is one man A: ove all men who can be thanked<br />
for it, and that man is Douglas Mawson.<br />
Of course he was an irmmnense explorer; but why was he<br />
a great explorer? I myself in physical matters rather like the<br />
beaten track. I like to go home, for example, at night by the<br />
well known route; I like to proceed from point A to point B<br />
by a well-known track. My wife is not like that at all I'm<br />
sorry she's not hero but she is not like that at all: she<br />
likes going, down the highways and byways and getting lost. But<br />
to be an explorer of this world, and of its resources, you must<br />
first of all have enormous ima-ination. This is not a task for<br />
dull people, for routine people, for people who merely see<br />
today's job and the result of today's job. This is a task for<br />
men of imagination. And I start with that with Douglas Mawson. </p>
<p>2.<br />
I used to think myself in my earlier and perhaps, for<br />
all I know, better informed days, that a gologist was a man who<br />
went around knapping bits of rock and putting them in a little<br />
sack, and then telling you without any danger of contradition<br />
what age they belonged to and all about them. It fascinated<br />
me. For nany years I wished that if I could be reinciarnato I<br />
should be a geologist. I dare say I would have found the slubi'c<br />
matter to deal with not nuch nore unresponsive than that whi; h<br />
I deal with today. ( Laughter) It all seened rather mna toer od<br />
fact: you had a body of knowledge and you applied it to a<br />
particular fornation.<br />
But of course for the work that Mawson did imag.:<br />
was of the essence. Not the kind of imagination which kn<.></.>
what the answer will be around the corner; but the imaginQ-' ou<br />
which knows that there is an answer around the corner and<br />
determined to discover it. So here was a great nan of grc',<br />
imaginative qualities. And in the field in which he workc<br />
needed to add to imagination, courage. Because imnainatioo , t<br />
exploring instinct, in whatever field it nay be, is worthiL* c..;<br />
without the courage to pursue it, without the courage to ieet<br />
the unknown, and its dangers. In that field he is a household<br />
name, not only here but all around the world.<br />
Then with imagination and with courage he neoded, and<br />
had, endurance. Not short-lived courage, not an imagination<br />
Seasily baffled, but the capacity for hanging on to it for<br />
enduring, for seeing it right through. So with these three<br />
enrrmous qualities which were essential for his wor-k he<br />
succeeded as nobody else has succeeded. He set an example that<br />
I don't think anybody else has been able to equal. He . chievc<br />
results which I believe are outstanding in the whole history o.<br />
Antarctic investigation. It is almost baffling, Sir, to those of us who are<br />
nade of nore ordinary stuff, to think that one man should have<br />
done so much, should have thbought so much, should have recorded<br />
so much, as I hope this Institute will make clear to future<br />
investigators, should have published so much, and above all,<br />
should have influenced so many. That is one of the great things<br />
that year after year, generation after generation, people will<br />
be influenced by what Mawson did and thought.<br />
It nay be, I suppose inevitably, that in 10 or 20 or<br />
or 50 years' tine the boundaries of knowledge will have been<br />
so extended that sone of the things that he found and recorded<br />
may be regarded as commonplace; just as the great basic<br />
principles of physics are today regarded as commonplace; just<br />
as the great basic principles of nuclear fission are today<br />
regarded as commonplace. But they wouldn't be commonplace<br />
they never will be commonplace so long as people reuoember that<br />
the foundations have been laid, the great principles<br />
established by remarkably great nen.<br />
And so Sir, this Institute will, I believe, take its<br />
proper place in the life of this University, and in the life of<br />
Australia. In it will be found not only information and rich<br />
material for research, but a profound inspiration to the people<br />
who come later on.<br />
You know, Sir, today I say this with particular<br />
reference to the graceful rerarks made by the representative of<br />
the Academy of Science of the Soviet Union today we are, as I<br />
an constantly being reminded, entering the " Space Age". And<br />
that, of course, is an exciting imrginative thing. We all<br />
admire the achievements, particularly the achievements of the<br />
last few Jays, in that field. I hope that we haven't become so </p>
<p>0 3.<br />
miserably isolated, one from another, that we can't admire and<br />
applaud immense work in the scientific and technological field<br />
wherever it happens. This i. s all part of the ultimate<br />
inheritance of mankind; '., ough as a rather earthbound<br />
character myself I sometimes take time off to say " 1' here are so<br />
many things on the earth, and in the earth itself, that we ' o. itt<br />
know about. I hope we shan't neglect them". I hope chat<br />
Antarctic research fram our point of view in Australia will<br />
continue to be something that we regard as of immense<br />
importance. Indeed if I may, Lady Mawson, with your permissi., on<br />
interlard these somewhat pontifical remarks of mine with a<br />
rather whimsical recollection, I would like to do it.<br />
am afraid when I was a boy and for all I know some of<br />
Professors were once boys; ( Laughter) there may be no imm-to d'-_ C<br />
Ã¸ urrent evidence of it, but I am sure you were-but when I a<br />
a boy, we thought of Antarctic explorers and of Arctic<br />
as gentlemen With furred parkas, with dogs, with sledso T'o/<br />
were remarkable men. And the whole of their history was a<br />
history of tremendous courage under tremendous diffLc. l. it-s..<br />
But what it was all about we were not too sure, wer I.-<br />
fact at one stae I remember we had an idea that the one thng<br />
that mattered was that somebody should be the first to get to<br />
the Pole. No doubt that is very good. We were not conscious<br />
I wasn't anyhow as a boy of the tremendous significance of all<br />
these things which went far beyond the stirring, remarkable,<br />
heroic, romantic story of courage and endurance.<br />
Perhaps those who, like Mr. Rymill, Mr. Law, hav.<br />
been down in those strange parts will bear with me: If tell<br />
them a simple story ab. out that very remarkable Dar who *:. QI'i<br />
under Sir Douglas, Frak T-urlchy, that phenomenal photographer.<br />
In 1941, in about Pebruaary, I was in the Middle East<br />
and went with Si. r Thomas Bi] t to Benghazi, the day after the<br />
battle of Benghazi it was. n Polar re-ion we were in, I can<br />
assure you and with l. ovJ. ti for a ie Minister, something<br />
I have seldom experiencQd, we flo. u in a tolerably fast<br />
plane and we were escorted, . believe it or not, by a couple of<br />
fighter aircraft. But the following day we flew back from a place called<br />
Barce in a biplane called a Valencia. Nobody could remember<br />
when it was built, but it was regarded as almost the equivalent<br />
of a T-model Ford. It had two flapping wings, and it had<br />
those windows ma1de of what laymen like myself call " mica" but<br />
might be anything, and they were warped and twisted by the<br />
weather and by old age. As soon as we made a little height<br />
alongside the mountain range that runs there, it got colder and<br />
colder, and the blast came in on us. We were all sitting in<br />
mangers that's all I can describe them as on the side of<br />
this plane. The wintry blast cane in; we had been provided<br />
with r. ading matter of a good solid kind like London Punch, and<br />
other journals of that kind. So far as I was concerned I<br />
grabbed as many as I could and tucked them inside my trousers.<br />
And then when a very respectful young Lir Force lad came along<br />
and said, " Would you like a rug?" I said, " Certainly bring me<br />
two". ( Laughter) And he brought me two blankets and I<br />
ensconced myself in them and so did other people.<br />
Finally we got out at a windswept aerodrome called El<br />
Aden, which some of you know, so stiff with the cold that it<br />
was hard to walk. It was 400 yards across to the airport<br />
building and to a really nourishing drink 400 yards. Out got<br />
Frank Hurley. He had boon travelling a little farther back in<br />
the plane than me. He was in uniform, and when he got out he<br />
could hardly walk. So I said, " My dear Hurley, it's all right </p>
<p>for a s:) ft civilian like no to be flozen, but a polar man like<br />
you He said, " That's the trouble, that's the trouble.<br />
When this boy cane along to me and seeing my grey hair, and<br />
being innocent of my lack of rank said to me, ' Sir, would you<br />
like a blanket or two?' I started to say ' Yes' and then my eye<br />
caught my polar ribbons and I thought, ' I can't lot the siA: r<br />
down'. I said, ' No, no thank you very nuch, no thank you vcr*<br />
much. On the whole I think it's rather stuffy". ( Laughter)<br />
And so, even more than I did, he linpod away in the directi:-n of<br />
that distant, but tantalising, whisky, as we hoped, in th,<br />
Officers' building.<br />
Well there it is; that is the kind of thing po: iLas<br />
illustrated by that story that we used to have in mind.<br />
Of course that is not the story. Who knows wha<br />
cone out of the Antarctic? Who knows today, even the r.. st<br />
scientifically gifted amongst you who knows what yet<br />
learned from this vast tract, what stores of scientific<br />
knowledge, of material resources for all we know, , f rnc-. eol<br />
ogical information from which we may derive matters of Inrc.?<br />
importance, particularly to this Continent? Jho ; 3 : t:<br />
the Antarctic region itself will not in due course<br />
one of the main highways of transportation around the worldl<br />
These places get closer and closer. We have just touched , th;-<br />
fringes of knowledge.<br />
I believe myself that what may come for mankind c". t<br />
of this previously desolate area nay turn out to ' e not orly<br />
exciting but superb in its significance*<br />
But I hope tiiat those who are here when all thcs<br />
mysteries are disclosed will ren cber, will honour the<br />
will respect the memory of Douglas Mawson who, more than any<br />
other mortal man, will have provided the key with which to<br />
unlock the door. ( Applauc;) </p>
