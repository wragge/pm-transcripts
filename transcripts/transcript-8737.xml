SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
NATIONAL EXPORT AWARDS PRESENTATION<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE CANBERRA 30 NOVEMBER 1992<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
It is a pleasure to be with you this evening to<br />
participate in these awards and to celebrate Australia's<br />
export achievements in the past year.<br />
I commend the efforts of the Austrade and its fellow<br />
sponsors in identifying Australia-1' best.<br />
I know from travelling round the country how difficult<br />
the final choices must have been.<br />
There is so much talent out there, and commitment to<br />
excellence is becoming a defining quality of much of our<br />
business and industry.<br />
These awards are a recognised national institution. For<br />
nearly thirty years they have recognised the tremendous<br />
contribution Australian exporters make to the nation's<br />
prosperity. There is no one in this room tonight who doeS not know<br />
that Australia's future depends upon our ability to<br />
compete in the world.<br />
Such is the level of economic awareness in Australia<br />
these days, I doubt if there are many Australians who do<br />
not know it.<br />
For employment opportunities to expand and for living<br />
standards to grow we need more companies like those<br />
represented here tonight companies prepared to pursue<br />
export opportunities and with the determination and nouse<br />
to succeed.<br />
You are here tonight because you have passed the ultimate<br />
test and succeeded internationally. Passed it with<br />
flying colours. </p>
<p>TEL 2<br />
You've done it by concentrating on quality, skills,<br />
workplace relationships, design, technology, management,<br />
market responsiveness. You've done it with international<br />
-be-st practice.<br />
The last twelve months have seen a difficult<br />
international trading environments Not a few of our most<br />
substantial trading partners are either in recession or<br />
experiencing very slow growth.<br />
So it is all the more a triumph to see Australian<br />
ventures succeeding in a diverse range of markets.<br />
We see this diversity among the finalists tonight.<br />
we have Australians selling cars end car parts to the US<br />
anid Asia.<br />
Australians selling cheesecake and pet food to Japan.<br />
Australian suppliers of beg-handling systems and<br />
packaging machinery to Asia, France, the Pacific and the<br />
US. Australians consulting on major infrastructure projects<br />
in Asia.<br />
Australians exporting high technology computer equipment<br />
and software around the world.<br />
Australians providing engineering equipment, concrete<br />
mixers and state of the art refrigeration technologies<br />
and storage containers.<br />
Australians exporting medical products for sleep<br />
disorders, and training videos for occupational health.<br />
Australians exporting high tech scientific equipment and<br />
specialised resource mapping services.<br />
Australians exporting gas cylinders and steel.<br />
Australians exporting magnesia, salt, iron ore, oil and<br />
gas. Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Australia is a global trader. We are dependent on an<br />
open, liberal trading environment.<br />
Australia's overriding foreign economic policy priority<br />
is to preserve and enffa_ 6iig a tradinig-environment in which<br />
our major markets become more open to us and to each<br />
other. T2EUL:. NOV.% i2 1(; 11 NO. uzu r. uziu( </p>
<p>TEL 3<br />
For our part, the Government is always on the look-out<br />
for ways of se curing better conditions for our trade., in<br />
whatever context, be it Multilateral, regiona~ l or<br />
bilateral. The Government today, and everyday, is working to see the<br />
global trading rules improved, market distortions removed<br />
and our access to markets enhanced.<br />
In a changing economic world, Australia needs to be open<br />
minded about the institutional forums and the<br />
arrangements we might enter to secure these objectives.<br />
We do not rule out bilateral trading agreements or<br />
membership of regional trading arrangements as means of<br />
achieving our goals in trade.<br />
Nor do we wish to pursue agreements which are prejudicial<br />
to our interests.<br />
The Trade investment Framework Arrangement which we are<br />
now concluding with the United States is an initiative<br />
which arose during the visit of President Bush in<br />
Jatnuary. it is an example of our willingness to enter into<br />
understandings which suit our interests, and which fit<br />
well with the development of the region's trade patterns.<br />
The arrangement will provide Australia with a valuable<br />
opportunity to hold high-level consultations on issues<br />
such as subsidies, quotas and non tariff barriers which<br />
effect some of our exports to the United States, such as<br />
beef, sugar and steel.<br />
our overall interests are clear. A strong liberal global<br />
trading system based on the GATT and a successful Uruguay.<br />
_ Round outcome will mean a un isal liberalisation of<br />
markets. A Pacific-wide trading area, with its most powerful<br />
economies building closer trade and investment bonds,<br />
helps ensure individual markets are fired by the vigour<br />
of prosperity and open trade.<br />
And the facts around these interests are clear.<br />
Australia's overall trade performance and our ability to<br />
negotiate better access for our exports depend<br />
substantially on the competitiveness and performance of<br />
the national economy.<br />
A decade ago our cost structure made it hard for<br />
exporters to compete.<br />
Today we have increased our competitiveness<br />
substantially, and entrenched our competitive advantages<br />
with low inflation and higher productivity growth.<br />
TELU: . Nov. 2JZ 1(; 11 NO. UZU r. uO,/ Va' </p>
<p>4<br />
More importantly, we have encouraged a wholesale shift<br />
into enterprise bargaininM as the principal means of<br />
deciding wages, and pushed forward 8 program of industry<br />
reform which has dramatically increased the prodtuctivity<br />
of ofr ports, and changed the f ace of our aviation and<br />
telecommunications industries.<br />
These industries are, of course, vital to exporting.<br />
No one should be under any illusions about these reforms<br />
both their strengths and their present limitations.<br />
They are overdue. There is, no doubt, still some way to<br />
go: just as there is still a way to go in developing a<br />
thoroughgoing export culture in Australia meaning an<br />
awareness at every level of the community, that it is<br />
fromn what we do and what we make that success will<br />
spring. But that awareness baa grown dramatically, and so has the<br />
pace of real reform in recent years. Without doubt, it<br />
has been much greater than anyone expected.<br />
Take the key issue of industrial relations: we expect<br />
that by next year abd-ut half the Au btiraian work force<br />
will be working under enterprise agreements.<br />
From any perspective, that is phenomenally rapid change,<br />
and it is happening for the fundamental reason that we<br />
had a cultural change, a change in outlook, in the<br />
previous five or six years.<br />
it was the change in attitude which underpins the<br />
concrete results we're now seeing.<br />
And, truly, there can be no sense in ripping the heart<br />
out of reform and with it, in large part, recovery by<br />
smashing the cooperative ethic which has been fashioned.<br />
why declare war when the peace is working?<br />
And when the only possible victory would leave us<br />
infinitely worse of f?<br />
Why go around the country saying, as the Victorian<br />
Premier did yesterday, Have Courage! Have couragel<br />
when patently, by their actions, Australians do have<br />
courage: and, more than that, common sense, imagination,<br />
public spirit, the ability to work together.<br />
The point is we have made extraordinary progress in the<br />
past decade, and the changes will breed more change. To<br />
reverse the progress will be to halt the change, and<br />
nothing could iever persuade me of the sense in doing<br />
that. Ladies and gentlemen 72EUL:. NOV. 232 1(: l NO. VZU rAJ' 4' u </p>
<p>TEL:<br />
Australian companies will benefit from the major<br />
investments we have made in infrastructure in aviation,<br />
road and rail; in the doubling of productivity on our<br />
wharves, in reduced shipping costs, reduced<br />
telecommunications costs and improved services, and so<br />
In our One Nation statement we also made changes to our<br />
business taxation system which make it one of the most<br />
competitive among industrial countries.<br />
The important poir&amp; to be made is that these reforms build<br />
on progress.<br />
There has been a transformation of our trade a<br />
transformation in volumes, composition and destination.<br />
Exports of goods and services as a proportion of our<br />
national product have risen from less than 14 per cent<br />
ten years ago to 23 per cent today.<br />
A decade ago we exported less than one sixth of our<br />
production. As the sheer volume of our exports has increased, their<br />
composition and direction have changed.<br />
The value of both our services exports and manufactured<br />
exports have tripled over the last decade.<br />
Manufactures and services together accounted for 34 per<br />
cent of our exports in 1982. Last year they accounted<br />
for 40 per cent.<br />
In the 1990s Australians are succeeding in tourism in<br />
ways unimaginable a decade ago.<br />
in 1982 950,000 tourists visited Australia. Last year<br />
nearly 2.4 millfifn ~ aiiived an average growth rate of<br />
more than 10.6 per cent, and yielding an increase in<br />
foreign exchange earnings of $ 6.3 billion dollars from<br />
$ 1.9 billion in 1982 to 88.2 billion last year.<br />
The forecast number of visitors in the year 2000 ranges<br />
between 4.8 million and 6.5 million.<br />
There is no better or more obvious example of our<br />
individual and collective capacity to adapt, to develop<br />
skills and infrastructure, to exploit our natural<br />
advantages and add value, or to seize an opportunity in a<br />
competitive international market than the success of the<br />
tourism industry.<br />
it now represents 12 per cerit of our total exports up<br />
from 7 per cent in 1982/ 83: and tourist operators, like<br />
all exporters, will continue to receive encouragement and<br />
support from this Government. TZEUL:. rwV.' JZ rNU. UZU r'. UDIV( </p>

In the last decade or so the Asian region has been<br />
transformed into the most rapidly growing regional<br />
economy in the world, with a high share of exports, and a<br />
high degree of trade within the region.<br />
our economy is increasingly integrated into the region.<br />
Nine out of ten of our largest export markets are now in<br />
Asia and the Pacific.<br />
Last year about 60 per cent of our exports went to East<br />
Asia. The Government is providing strategic support for a<br />
number of key export-oriented sectors, at the same time<br />
progressively lowering the tariff walls in order to<br />
assist restructuring and enhance competitiveness.<br />
Many of the companies here tonight have worked in<br />
partnership with the Government in specific areas for<br />
instance through the International Trade Enhancement<br />
Scheme, the Asia-Pacific Fellowships Scheme, or Austrade<br />
industry special-s-ts refll __ iig _ a _ joint long term<br />
commitment to exporting.<br />
We have shown we can change and adapt.<br />
We have shown we can work together. We have demonstrated<br />
our versatility in many fields of endeavour. We have<br />
shown that we can succeed.<br />
But each of us here tonight knows that to get here has<br />
not been easy it requires sustained application over<br />
the long haul and we still have much to do.<br />
The Government for its part will continue to encourage<br />
more Australian companies to export.<br />
As well as the changes at home, we have been spreading<br />
the message abroad of the " new" Australia. I have made<br />
this a central theme or my visits this year to Indonesia,<br />
Japan and Singapore.<br />
in the last two years, the Government has opened a number<br />
of new posts in the increasingly affluent Asian region.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, the success of the companies<br />
represented here tonight is an inspiration and example to<br />
others. They need only look to your success for<br />
confirmation that the labour is worthwhile.<br />
Your imagination, determination, skills and effort<br />
constitute a profound contribution to the great national<br />
endeavour in the 1990s. T2EL0:. Nov. 92 17: 11 No. 020 P. Ub/ r' </p>
<p>IEL: ZU. NOv. z 1 r. 11 NIu. VUV r . Vu u<br />

The effort to make Australia a vigorous trading nation<br />
and a prosperous society which can deliver employment<br />
opportunities to all.<br />
Your success is a material contribution to that process,<br />
and a psychological one. Because success raises<br />
Australians' hope, competitive success in the world<br />
raises Australians' self-esteem.<br />
It raises confidence and we will need that in the coming<br />
years, as much as anything else.<br />
So I thank you all, and congratulate you. </p>
