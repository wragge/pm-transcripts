    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today the Australian Parliament and the Australian Labor Party mourn the passing of the Honourable Frank Crean. </p>
<p>Mr Crean passed away peacefully today aged 92, as the oldest former member of the Australian Federal Parliament.</p>
<p>Frank Crean was a genuine Labor legend, he played a seminal role in Labor politics helping build and rebuild the Party in some of its darkest days, and served as one of the finest ministers in the Whitlam Government.</p>
<p>After service in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, Mr Crean was first elected as the Federal Member for Melbourne Ports in 1951.</p>
<p>On the election of the Whitlam Government in 1972, Mr Crean entered Cabinet as Treasurer, delivering the first Labor Budget after 23 years in opposition. Following a period as Minister for Overseas Trade, in 1975 Mr Crean was appointed to the position of Deputy Prime Minister of Australia.</p>
<p>During the life of the Whitlam Government, Frank Crean's dedication, determination and commitment to his beliefs was legendary.</p>
<p>At the 1977 election Mr Crean retired, having served the people of Melbourne Ports and the people of Australia with great distinction for 26 years.</p>
<p>It is testament to his passion and enduring commitment to Labor values that Frank Crean continued attending local branch meetings well into his twilight years.</p>
<p>Frank Crean was the patriarch of a great Labor family with two sons also serving as Ministers in Labor Governments, including my cabinet colleague and friend, the Trade Minister Simon Crean.</p>
<p>My sincere condolences go to his family and friends, in particular his wife Mary, who shared a partnership and life together with Frank over 63 years of marriage.</p>
<p>The Australian Labor Party and people of Australia owe Frank Crean a significant debt of gratitude for his contribution to Australian public life.</p>
