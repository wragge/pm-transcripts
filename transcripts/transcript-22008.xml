    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia proposes, in principle, to establish an Australian Technical, Vocational and Trades College for the Pacific, with a network of campuses.  I have told my Pacific Island colleagues that it be headquartered in one of the more populous Pacific Island countries, with other campuses in the region.</p>
<p>  The new college will deliver Australian-standard qualifications.  This will significantly upgrade the supply of trade skills in the Pacific.  It will also enable much greater labour mobility of skilled and semi-skilled workers between the Pacific and Australia (and other developed economies).</p>
<p>Competitive workforces are a key driver of growth.  Better and broader education at all levels will contribute to higher average incomes in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Australia will conduct a major study to take forward the proposal and guide its establishment.  The study will look to maximise the involvement in the new college of the Australian education sector and other relevant Australian business interests, in order to ensure that Pacific Islanders receive targetted training to meet real needs in the employment market.</p>
<p>I hope to be in contact with Forum leaders early next year to convey the outcomes of the study.</p>
<p>This initiative, if confirmed, will be funded from the significant increase in Australian Overseas Development Assistance that I announced at the UN Leaders' Summit in New York last month.</p>
