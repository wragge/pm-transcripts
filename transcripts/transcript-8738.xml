PRIME MINISTER 129/ 92<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTERI, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
URUGUAY ROUND BREAKTHROUGH<br />
I warmly welcome today's announcement that the United States and theEuropean<br />
~ inunit commission have resolvcd their outstanding differences over agriculture in<br />
the UruguayjRound Negotiations.<br />
Both sides arc to be congratulated on the flexibility and statcsnianship they have<br />
demonstrated in reconciling a dispute which threatened not only to terminate the Round<br />
but to substantially increase trade conflict.<br />
This breakthrough rcprcscnts in my view the most important achievement sinec the round<br />
commenced six years ago and is an historic step in bringing fair trade to agriculture.<br />
Announcement of the agreement will have a significant favourable impact onl world<br />
economic confidence at a time of slow growth and international pessimism.<br />
I particularly applaud1 the work of President Bush and his administration in working<br />
tirelessly to complete this agrcn-in bcforc thc cnd of the year. It is a fine parting gift to<br />
the world from a President who has already contributed so much in international affairs,<br />
The U. S. Administration kept the Australian Government wcll informed during the<br />
negotiations and we accept the agrecments reached in agriculture as a sensible<br />
compromise which will both assist low cost agricultural exporters like Australia and pave<br />
the way for the settlement of all the remaining issues, icluding services and market<br />
acces, in the Round.<br />
Through its leadership of the Cairns Group agricultural fair traders Australia has played a<br />
key role in insisting that ally ou~ tcome to the Round had to include reform in agricultural<br />
trade. </p>
<p>The agreement calls for a 20 pcr cent reduction across the board in internal supports for<br />
agriculture. Tt also provides for a 36 pcr cent reduction ovcr six years in the amount of<br />
money spent to subsidise agriculture exports and a 21 per cent reduction in the volume of<br />
subsidised exports.<br />
The agreement will over time substantially inhibit subsidised agriculture exports by all<br />
signatories, including the US and the European Community, increasing the<br />
competitiveness of unsubsidised exporters such as Australia.<br />
Now that the breakthrough in agriculture has been achieved the negotiations will be<br />
brought back into the multilateral discussions in Geneva where all participating countries,<br />
including Australia, will play their part in reaching a final agrcement on the draft Final<br />
Act to the Round ( the so called Dunkel package which has been on the table in Geneva<br />
since December' 1991) and the subsequent conclusion of negotiations of specific<br />
commitments for market access liberal isation in industrial products, agriculture and<br />
services. A successful Uruguay Round package bringing a liberalised trade outcome to industrial<br />
tariffs, textiles, agriculture, services and more effective trade rules will bring enormous<br />
benefit for the global economy as a whole and assist in leading the whole world into<br />
stronger growth.<br />
