PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 27 OCTOBER 1978<br />
ADDRES S<br />
AT<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIAN<br />
STATE COUNCIL DINNER<br />
Mr President, I am delighted to have been asked to speak at<br />
this State Council dinner, and to have the opportunity to<br />
congratulate you on your re-election.<br />
This is your third term as State President in South Australia,<br />
and I have very much appreciated your advice and assistance.<br />
over the last two years.<br />
This is also the first opportunity I have had to thank formally<br />
the South Australian Division as a whole for the part they<br />
played in our overwhelming success at the last Federal Election.<br />
Last December every sitting Liberal throughout Australia who<br />
contested the election was returned. The Labor Party's share<br />
of the vote actually fell from 1975, and was the lowest recorded<br />
since 1934. And here in South Australia, as in three other<br />
States, the Government won three of the five Senate seats.<br />
It was a massive endorsement of the Liberal philosophy and<br />
the Government's policies, and a great tribute to all those<br />
in the Party Organisation who campaigned so hard.<br />
On the State scene I know that David Tonkin and his team,<br />
working closely with your re-structured executive, are on<br />
course to win office at the next State elections.<br />
The State Labor government had given you a good omen they<br />
have recently increased their Cabinet to thirteen. But it<br />
won't be bad luck that brings the Labor government down.<br />
It will be its dismal failure to provide the kind of policies<br />
that South Australia needs to gjet this State moving again.<br />
Only a Liberal Government has th e philosophy and the policies<br />
to revitalise this state. For our primary interest * as a<br />
Party is in people: their individual gifts and their right<br />
to have the chance to develop them to the full; their freedom<br />
to participate fully in the political life of this country;<br />
their right to take risks and be rewarded for success; and<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
their need for compassionate and effective help<br />
when in difficulty, help which is provided<br />
in ways which enhance rather than diminish self-esteem<br />
and dignity.<br />
The Liberal ideal is a stable, humane, and civilised<br />
country, enriched by a diversity of cultures and<br />
life styles and unified by a sense of national purpose<br />
and identity.<br />
The Liberal Party seeks a growing and developing<br />
Australia in which private enterprise is able to thrive<br />
and expand helping to provide satisfying work for<br />
all Australians.<br />
It was no accident that the founder of our Party, Sir Robert<br />
Menzies, chose the name " Liberal", for we are the<br />
successors of a long and great tradition.<br />
The Liberal tradition has inspired social reform in Australia<br />
for a century. It was the LiberalIs who introduced votes<br />
for women, and later, votes for 18 year olds, the secret<br />
ballot, our arbitration system, old age pensions, tariff<br />
protection for local industry,<br />
Commonwealth funding for education and,<br />
more recently, family allowances, the indexation of pensions,<br />
tax indexation and revenue sharing with the States.<br />
The Liberal tradition, with its emphasis on individual<br />
rights and needs, and its suspicion of easy, big spending,<br />
bureaucratic solutions, is just as relevant today as<br />
at any other time in its history.<br />
Just as Liberals centuries ago fought against centralised<br />
power, we are today taking up the challenge of curbing<br />
the power of big government and big bureaucracy. Just<br />
as the great British Liberal, Keynes, helped governments<br />
to overcome the Great Depression so Liberals today have<br />
forged new policies which are meeting today's challenges,<br />
which are overcoming inflation, and returning the<br />
dispirited, shaken economy we inherited to full health.<br />
How then do we see the 1980s? We utterly reject the Labor<br />
Party's hang-dog attitude which can see nothing but problems.<br />
Mr. Hayden keeps calling the 1980s " the decade of despair".<br />
In a way I can understand that. It will be a decade of despair<br />
for the Labor Party. They are haunted by the prospect of<br />
long years and more of opposition.<br />
After the last election, Labor's policies were so utterly<br />
discredited that the A. L. P. established a Committee of<br />
Inq~ uiry to inquire into itself. The Committee's task was<br />
truly herculean.-to get the Labor Party back in touch with<br />
the real needs and aspirations of the Australian people.<br />
Is it any wonder they have-, drifted apart? / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
There was a time when the Labor Party was represented<br />
in Parliament by men who had been schooled in the<br />
union movement; men who understood the need for a person<br />
to get a job and support his family; men who had struggled<br />
for better conditions for their fellow workers. But nov4<br />
such men are rejected, thrust aside in favour of proponents<br />
of theory and dogma the very sort of theoreticians<br />
dominating the Labor Party's Committee of Self Inquiry.<br />
That Inquiry recently unveiled its schemes for Australia's<br />
economic future a scheme to nationalise major<br />
Australian companies. It seems the only way Labor can keep<br />
in touch with private industry is to nationalise it.<br />
One of the authors of the scheme said it was about time<br />
people woke up to what the Australian Labor Party was all<br />
about. Well, I can tell him the Australian people are<br />
wide awake to the Labor Party. They know Labor has forsaken<br />
the working men and women of Australia. That's why in<br />
the last two Federal elections so many Australians voted<br />
Liberal. That's why so many Australians will vote Liberal<br />
through the 1980s.<br />
The parlous state of the economy which we took over from<br />
our predecessors less than three years ago demanded that we<br />
give a high priority to getting inflation down. Inflation<br />
threatens our living standards, it particularly harms those<br />
on fixed incomes, those least able to defend themselves.<br />
It destroys the initiative to invest and grow. It destroys<br />
jobs. It leads to unemployment. A government that condones<br />
inflation condones unemployment. A government that creates<br />
inflation as Labor did creates unemployment. We as Liberals<br />
should never forget that. Inflation can destroy efforts to<br />
improve the well-being of the disadvantaged.<br />
As a government, we have heeded the Henderson Poverty<br />
Report's warning to governments against the danger and I<br />
use Professor Henderson's words: . of falling into the<br />
inflationary trap of attempting to carry out so many social<br />
reforms or other public expenditures at once, that they<br />
accelerate an inflationary spiral that does more to damage<br />
poor people than the assistance provided by the reform"<br />
Our view that the fight against inflation is crucial is<br />
held by many world governments. The case is so compelling<br />
that it is even recognised by socialist governments.<br />
Let me quote from the British Prime Minister's October<br />
speech to the British Labor Party's Annual Conference:<br />
" The beginning for the Government is how do we keep inflation<br />
down". " It is the Governmeprt's inescapable responsibility<br />
to keep down inflation, not against anybody, but in the<br />
interests of the whole of the people of this country". / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
In Australia, we have already had great success in<br />
reducing inflation-By maintaining our policies, we<br />
will force inflation down further.<br />
Our fight against inflation has not prevented the<br />
Government from undertaking a wide range of initiatives'<br />
and reforms. The more we reduce inflation, the more we<br />
can push ahead strongly and rapidly in realising our<br />
goals for Australia.<br />
The challenge of the 1980s is not some unrealistic<br />
Utopia some pie-in-the-sky dream utterly divorced<br />
from reality. We have a vision of Australia's future<br />
it is a vision we will achieve.<br />
Our vision is of an Australia which is a country of growth<br />
and development, of prosperity and enlightenment, of<br />
stability and security, of compassion and effective help<br />
for those in need a country in which the quality of<br />
freedom and opportunity for individual Australians has<br />
no equal anywhere.<br />
We ask only one thing of this nation for the mean and<br />
women of Australia to recognise their common interests;<br />
to recognise that by working together with determination<br />
and common purpose there is nothing this nation cannot<br />
achieve.<br />
As Liberals, we believe this vision will be achieved<br />
by Government policy, by the actions of voluntary<br />
organisations, and above all by the conscious commitment<br />
of individual Australians leading us to a more caring,<br />
more responsible, more creative, more tolerant, more<br />
self-reliant nation.<br />
We are already on the way to realising this great ideal.<br />
It is our goal to build a vigorous vital economy, sure of<br />
its own strength developing through the capacity of<br />
its people.<br />
We want a more competitive society, with less government<br />
restrictions, where new businesses are encouraged. We<br />
have moved to lift the heavy hand of bureaucracy.<br />
Our goal is a society in which satisfying and fulfilling work<br />
is available for those who seek it. Our economic policies<br />
are moving Australia in that direction. We are overcoming<br />
the ills and difficulties of Labor's excesses. </p>
<p>Our goal is to provide effective and compassionate<br />
assistance to those in need and our welfare programmes<br />
are doing this. Our introduction of the family allowance<br />
is one of the greatest social welfare innovations<br />
made in Australia in this century.<br />
The new programmes we have introduced for migrant and<br />
ethnic communities are a long-needed breakthrough in<br />
this area.<br />
Our goal is a free and tolerant society which protects<br />
the basic rights of people. A society where privacy<br />
is respected, where the rule of law prevails, where<br />
justice is available to all, where bureaucracies are<br />
responsive to people's needs, and there is redress for<br />
ill-considered decisions by public servants.<br />
our goal is a society where industrial disputes shall be<br />
settled by consultation and reason and if that fails<br />
the rule of law will prevail.<br />
We look to a decade in which employers and employees will<br />
recognise their common interests, and that the greatest<br />
gains for all Australians come from increasing the<br />
nation's wealth.<br />
We have already made great advances in this area by<br />
providing protection for conscientious objectors; by<br />
introducing secret postal ballots for union elections;<br />
by establishing the Industrial Relations Bureau.<br />
Our goal is to respond to the problems created by our<br />
complex industrial society. We are determined that,<br />
together with voluntary welfare associations, we will meet<br />
the problems of drug abuse, of family breakdown, of<br />
frustration and alientation.<br />
Our goal is a healthy Australia with health services equal<br />
to any in the world provided at a reasonable cost.<br />
We have already made substantial reforms to Australia's<br />
health services.<br />
Our goal is an Australia enjoying a high standard of education,<br />
which meets the needs of our multicultural society; an<br />
education system that contributes to a vigorous, vital and<br />
inventive people wanting to work for themselves and their<br />
families.<br />
The Williams Report, examining the problems of education<br />
and training, will assist us to move the education system<br />
further towards this objective. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
The realisation of all these goals depends significantly<br />
on the achievement of our economic objectives. Only<br />
a stable, prosperous economy in which inflation has been<br />
overcome and confidence fully restored will provide all<br />
the resources necessary to achieve our ends.<br />
Australians have every reason for great confidence in<br />
the future. The recent favourable trends in the economy<br />
are the result of this Government's policies: inflation<br />
is down; interest rates are moving down; the rural sector<br />
has very good prospects; with a more stable cost base,<br />
we are competitive again and are getting our manufacturers<br />
back into world markets. It gives us a chance to sell at<br />
home and abroad.<br />
Falling interest rates will stimulate activity for businesses<br />
of all sizes. It will make it easier for Australians<br />
to purchase homes. We have made significant progress and<br />
this steady improvement will continue.<br />
Let us not just pay lip-service to the goals and aspirations<br />
we all share, for they are not mere abstract notions<br />
suitable only for reflective speeches by Prime Ministers.<br />
We need all of us to relate these goals to our<br />
everyday lives.<br />
Let me give some examples. We all believe in there being<br />
more jobs available for Australians out of work. It is<br />
time union leaders showed real concern for the unemployed<br />
by moderating wage claims to prevent working men and women<br />
being priced out of the labour market.<br />
We all believe in the handicapped receiving a fair deal.<br />
It is time more employers showed real concern for the<br />
handicapped by offering them work as vacancies become<br />
available.<br />
We all believe in a fair and equitable taxation system.<br />
It is time so many Australians stopped indulging in<br />
blatant and artificial tax avoidance schemes.<br />
We all believe in conservation and the need to protect<br />
our environment. It is time we all made a real effort to<br />
stop littering Australia and polluting our environment.<br />
We all believe in a great country. It is time we stopped<br />
knocking Australia.<br />
Achieving the goals and aspirations we share is not just a<br />
task for Government. It is a task for Government and people;<br />
for the Commonwealth and the States; for the young and<br />
old; for all Australians wherever they may be.<br />
The Australian Government seeks a partnership with the<br />
community; between government, employers and employees;<br />
between Government agencies and voluntary organisations;<br />
between legislators and individual Australians. With such<br />
a partnership, with such a commitment, there is nothing<br />
Australians cannot achieve. 0 00---</p>
