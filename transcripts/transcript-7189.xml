ELECTION CAM2PAIGN POLICY LAUNCH<br />
SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE 23 JUNE 1987<br />
Fellow Auo3tralians,<br />
Never in peaice-time has Australia's future depended so much<br />
on a Singh~ decision your decision on the 11th of July.<br />
Never have you, the Australian people, been called upon to<br />
make a iuogao fundaumental decision for yourselves, your<br />
families your children about the way you want your<br />
country to go about what kind of a country you want<br />
Australia to be.<br />
It is a decision about what kind of a people wie are.<br />
it is a decision about what hind of a nation we are going to<br />
be. Are we to continue to unite together in the great task of<br />
national 8: caewal, reconstruction and revitalisation, for<br />
which we have been working so hard together, and on which<br />
the succesG ok our country depends?<br />
Are we to go forward with strength and stability stability<br />
in governmzont, otability in our society?<br />
Or are we to take the other course, the path of our<br />
opponent-,-inflicting upon the nation itself all their own<br />
divisions, all their own disunity, all their own<br />
instability?<br />
on behalf of the Australian Labor Party I ask for a<br />
resounding decision, a decision that will show the world<br />
just what kind of a people we are<br />
a strong, united, stable, confident, forward-looking<br />
people responding to the leadership of a strong, united,<br />
stable, confident, forward-looking government.<br />
We come before you as one, united team. </p>
<p>0,<br />
2 41<br />
we come before you with one pledge that as one, united<br />
team, we will continue and intensify our undivided efforts<br />
in the task of national renewal and revitalisation of our<br />
economy, our industry, our society.<br />
Follow Auctralians,<br />
This eloction is about our faith in Australia's future. it<br />
is about our faith in ourselves.<br />
And it is about our belief and faith my faith, our<br />
government's faith in the character and calibre of the<br />
Australian people. And it is a belief and faith based firmly<br />
upon experience.<br />
Four and a half years ago I pledged a Labor-government to<br />
seek national reconciliation instead of confrontation and<br />
division -to create 500,000 new jobG In three years.<br />
our opponents said it couldn't be done. That was their<br />
judgement about the Australian people.<br />
But together we did much better. we easily exceeded our<br />
target. In four ycars, we have created 800,000 new jobs and in the<br />
past six Lnonthe alone 100,000 new jobs.<br />
Two and z half years ago we called for a continuation of the<br />
economic restraint so necessary for the reconstruction of<br />
our econoniy and industry, which is the key to our future.<br />
Our opponents mocked the concept of co-operation and<br />
restraint. They wanted as they still want a return to<br />
confrontation in industry. That was their judgement on the<br />
working men and women of Australia and the business<br />
community of Australia.<br />
But, building on the basis of restraint and responsibility,<br />
we have saved the steel industry, transformed the motor<br />
vehicle industry, set about the reconstruction of<br />
Australia's entire manufacturing and services base.<br />
Exactly one year ago I put to the people of Australia the<br />
greateat challenge of all,<br />
I told you of the disastrous drop in the prices of our<br />
exports a collapse in world trade that has now cost every<br />
Australian family $ 2,000.<br />
I said then that this meant a year of the toughest decisions<br />
imposed in peace-time.<br />
our opponents said that the Australian people would never<br />
cop it. </p>
<p>They said the Australian people would never understand why<br />
the loss of $ 9 billion in our national incomle meant that we<br />
all had to adjust that it was not just for the farmers and<br />
the other es~ porters to carry the loss -we all had to<br />
shoulder the burden.<br />
We said we w~ ould not shirk the hard decisions needed to<br />
ensure a brcight future for us in this generation and for our<br />
children in theiro.<br />
I told you I would rather risk electoral defeat than tako<br />
the soft options that would mean we mortgage our great<br />
future.<br />
And it is because wa backed our judgement of the Australian<br />
people tooc the tough decisions, made the hard choices.-<br />
that we can now stand before you, confident and proud of<br />
what we have achieved together, but more important,<br />
confident and proud of the great things we can achieve<br />
together, for our families, our children, for our country,<br />
in the yearre ahead.<br />
Yet our opponents, who are incapable of governing<br />
themselves, now seek to govern Australia on a grab-bag of.<br />
contradictoryj proposals drummed up on the run proposals<br />
which could only have one result: They would wreck utterly<br />
the efforto we, the Australian people, have made together<br />
over the last four years and in particular over the past<br />
year. They have not only got their sums wrong.<br />
They have got Australians wrong.<br />
Friends, The real danger from our political opponents is this:<br />
All that has been achieved by your restraint and<br />
responsibility would be wasted. The benefits you have<br />
foregone and the sacrifices you have been called upon to<br />
make would have boen in vain.<br />
It is only because we have made the tough decisions, and put<br />
them in place in the last Budget, the May Statement, and two<br />
successive Premiers, Conferences, that we can now give these<br />
undertakings: Interest rates are again falling and under Labor will<br />
continue to gall.<br />
Inflation is again falling and under Labor will continue to<br />
fall. Employment iG growing at twice the rate of the rest of the<br />
western world under a government which has created 800,000<br />
new jobs in four years; and under Labor, employment will<br />
continue to grow. </p>

In the comp. leted Buge inSpebrteewl enbe<br />
taaxne notaxincreases.<br />
Buet sallnever jeopardise Australia's future by<br />
irreponsblepromises. Il<br />
We akeour future undertakings on the firm basis of the<br />
achievable, the credible, the responsible.<br />
And let me emphasise:<br />
Everything in our program is affordable, achievable and<br />
economically responsible.<br />
This Labor Government has achieved the most significant<br />
reform of the taxation system since Federation.<br />
And the fundamental reason why our our opponents could never<br />
achieve any tax reform in all their years in office is that<br />
they never had the courage to act against tax avoidance.<br />
And they let it become Australia's biggest growth industryand<br />
that's the description given by their own Royal<br />
Commissioner.<br />
We have smashed the tax avoidance industry.<br />
We have cut out wasteful privileges and windfalls for the<br />
few. That is why we are able further to reduce income tax.<br />
Following the first round of tax cuts in December, new tax<br />
scales will operate from 1 July, 1987. They will bring the<br />
top marginal rate down from the Liberal legacy of 60 per<br />
cent to 49 aer cent.<br />
And the rate for taxpayers on average earnings will have<br />
been brought down from 46 per cent to 40 per cent.<br />
And it is because of our tax reforms that we are able to<br />
undertake that the September Budget will continue the full<br />
indexation of pensions.<br />
This is what a Labor Government means for the next three<br />
years: genuine reductions in taxation, lower inflation,<br />
lower interest rates, higher pensions, more jobs.<br />
Yet our opponents invite you to throw all this away, for a<br />
tax bribe nobody believes in least of all, its discredited<br />
authors and something which, if ever seriously attempted,<br />
would destroy the economy and rip apart the social fabric<br />
the basis of the Australian ideal of a fair go for all.<br />
They invite you to turn your backs on the meaning of<br />
everything we have been able to achieve together over the<br />
past four years.<br />
They invite you to turn your backs on the real meaning of<br />
Australia's future </p>
<p>a t a future founded on the great ideals of fairness and<br />
justice in our society a fair go for all.<br />
Indeed, my friends, it is almost impossible to judge which<br />
is the more dangerous<br />
their economic vandalism,<br />
or the tyholesale vandalism they propose against tho<br />
social framework of this nation.<br />
They have long been the parties of social division.<br />
Now they stand as the parties of social devastation.<br />
The whole basis of our call to the Australian people at the<br />
election in 1983 and again in 1984 was an appeal to this<br />
great truth about the Australian community the truth that<br />
the legitinate aspirations of the diverse groups and<br />
interests which go to make up the nation can best be<br />
achieved, not by fighting each other, not by setting group<br />
against group, Australians against Australians, but by<br />
working together, recognising and respecting each other's<br />
rights, fa. r expectations and fair hopes and aspirations.<br />
That was the basic on which we sought a mandate and that was<br />
the basis on which the mandate has been twice given.<br />
And it io on that basis the people's response the<br />
recognition of this great truth about Australia that we<br />
have been able to fight back together against the huge<br />
difficulties imposed upon us by events abroad.<br />
The toughness with fairness we have applied to the affairs<br />
of this nation and the response of the Australian people now<br />
enable us to sot ne goals realistic, responsible<br />
achievable goals for Australia's future.<br />
We seek to create an Australia where there are no second<br />
class citizens.<br />
And we will achieve that only by refusing to accept as a<br />
Government, cs a society, as a people second rate<br />
policies. In this highly competitive world we cannot settle for the<br />
second rate in industry, in technology, in education.<br />
We must continue now as a matter of urgency the work of<br />
modernising and revitalising our economy and industry, so<br />
that we can competo with the world on the world's terms.<br />
That is the only way we can restore and improve living<br />
standards for all. </p>
