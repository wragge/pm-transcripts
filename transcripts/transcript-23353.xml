    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government will boost funding for the Remote School Attendance Strategy by $18 million to help ensure every child attends school every day.</p>
<p>The strategy aims to break the cycle of non-attendance and ensure parents and carers take responsibility for educating their children.</p>
<p>Because itâs hard to be literate and numerate without attending school; itâs hard to find work without a basic education; and itâs hard to live well without a job.</p>
<p>Forty remote communities already benefit from School Attendance Officers on the ground working with parents and communities to improve school attendance rates.</p>
<p>Attendance rates are up by 14 per cent in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and South Australia which equates to more than 600 additional students in school each day compared to last year.</p>
<p>An additional 30 communities across Australia will now benefit with a further 210 School Attendance Officers and 60 School Attendance Supervisors to be employed.</p>
<p>School Attendance Officers encourage school attendance through a variety of measures, including walking or driving children to school, helping with school lunch preparation and organising uniforms.</p>
<p>The officers also work within their communities to promote the benefits of regular school attendance.</p>
<p>Todayâs announcement brings total funding for the Remote School Attendance Strategy to $46.5 million.</p>
<p>We will work with state and territory governments to identify schools with poor school attendance which will benefit most from this extended investment.</p>
<p>One of the worst forms of neglect is failing to give children the education they need for a decent life.</p>
<p>Thatâs why indigenous school attendance data will be part of the next Closing the Gap report and all subsequent reports under this Government.</p>
<p>The parliament will be brought up-to-date on the relative success or failure of Aboriginal education because a good education is fundamental to a good start in life.</p>
<p>We will know that Aboriginal people are living better when children go to school, adults go to work and the ordinary law of the land is respected and enforced.</p>
