TRA~ NSCRIPT OF PRIME MINISTER ON 3AW WITH DERRYN H-INCH,<br />
FRIDAY 14 SEPTEMBER 1984, 9.10 a. mi.<br />
E 0 E Proof only<br />
PM4 There is nothing on vubjch the government: can be attacked.<br />
In their desperation they have rqsorted to this tactic of smear and<br />
innuendo in respect of issues for which there is absolutely no basis<br />
whatsoever. I think you know, Derryn that there is no figure in<br />
public political life who has bedn around for so long whose life<br />
h&amp; 2 been such an open book as znize. I a-m not a crook, I am not<br />
a criminal, I'm not directed by 6rooks, as your friend, Andrew<br />
Peacock said. Perhaps the best illustration of whall. wight you<br />
can attach to these people and their tactics was provided yesterda~ y<br />
by Mr Steele Hali, acting in coll'usion and conjunction and presu-n. ably<br />
under the direction of My Peacock. He, in the house, at questiJon<br />
time, by way of question, accused. mec of sending my principal<br />
advisor, Mr Peter Barron to spe the editor of the Age, to secure<br />
the supression of a story about judge, and a safe deposit box<br />
in a~ Switus bank. That statement,' that allegation, was absolutely<br />
without foundation. No foundation at all now what were the ou-ise<br />
of events? When that wa-put-to ire in the parl-iament at questionl<br />
time yesterday, I reppdiateda, I S~ id iyavsr r~ ro a<br />
cerltainly seen M,' r Creighton. Burns, but T said thcere was absolutely<br />
no basis to the allcosation. Late): that day, : late-r yesterday, X;. r<br />
Creighton Burns izssued thoi sta-to-c~ rt. * I ' would like listenerz; to<br />
hear cexactly what it was that the -ditor of the Acqe said in 1&amp;. 3<br />

<p>fact he did not ask me to do any~. hing, and he certainly didno<br />
threaten Mr Burns concludeii " I do not know Mr Steele Rall,<br />
and to the best of my recoll.', ction I havec neve--r spoken to him.<br />
Certain~. y not about any matter re lating to a High Court Judge or<br />
Ms4 Morosi7 Now Derryn, when tiat statement caine from Mr Burns<br />
quite unsolicited by me,* I weat i nto the Parliament after givin~ g<br />
notice to the Opposition that I W~ as going in to add to my ansver t()<br />
question timne. I-read that out, adI attacked the Opposition.<br />
I said, now there you are, you~ r tactics of, innuendo of allegation<br />
are totally revealed for what they, are, and gave them -an opportunity<br />
to apologise. They sat there lik 1e stunned mullets. Later on in<br />
the evening the member for Boothby, MLr Steele Hall came in and<br />
acknowledged that Mr Burns had made a-statement, but did not withdraw<br />
the allegation at all. He said, the information put to the Opposit~ ion<br />
in regard to the story, was corroborated from separate . sou~ rces, and<br />
for-that reason the Government war, tested at question time. I ask<br />
you to understand what Steeleo Hall., Peacock area saying. They are<br />
* saying that they ca-n fabricate, m~ ake up any story, get somtething f rom<br />
two different people, three different people and say that a corroj'Xration.<br />
The only way that that allegation, that was so recklessly made in tlle<br />
Parliament could be corroborated wqas by one of two people, that<br />
Mr Burns or Mr Barron. Mr Barron'. is not in the country and certainly<br />
it isn't true. if my principle ac~ visor-is going to tell an untruth1<br />
about this. Mr Burns, the man in $ uestion repudiated it a-nd yet, these<br />
miserable, desperate and increasingly rejected people on the Opposition<br />
knowing they cannot touch this Go'ernrnent on polilcies are getting up<br />
in that Parliament, and making ab~ olutely baseless allegations-.<br />
When repudiated,. by someone of the standing of Creighton Burns,,<br />
repudiating them absolutely, they: say " Ch, its corroborated." 1<br />
By definition its not corroboratedi because it car, not be. This<br />
tactic means that you can make up* a smear, an allegation-and get<br />
two people to say it and because two people say-it: thats corro.-bo,. rat ion.<br />
D Well outside thie Parliam~ nt.. outside of Parliainentry privilege<br />
w'hero, Mr Peacock cannot bo touched, he did nay that-he bnlievcs,<br />
said, that you asso0ciate with r. mnl That iw-as said on 1' tt. onwid-<br />
: la't night.<br />
PM I can assure you Derryn, IhItI: Pe: coc)' S statomcrlta re<br />
baein carefuilly looked a am ifl' Uiis very' 6. fficut p2ositiofl .1A)-1:<br />
iaorn.. </p>
<p>con 3<br />
asoon as I say to you that thos ! e statements outside the Parliamenc<br />
are being looked at by my legal advisers what is said, I'm trying<br />
to stifle you. You are put in a z'. o win situation.<br />
DH Yes, I'll agree, its like if you esued Andrew. Peacock, or'<br />
Andrew Peacock sues you, you are Parliamentry leaders and are meant<br />
to have freedom of expression at b~ 1l time. if you gag either one,<br />
it is going to look sinister.<br />
yet, I must give very serious consideration to it a a<br />
I repeat to you, as I put at the very beginning of . the program, there<br />
is no person who has been in public life in-Australia, as long as I<br />
have who at all times has made rpyself open to the public and to the<br />
p ress. An open book.....<br />
DH........ Because of what is said.., in the house yesterday I can<br />
come on this morning, as long as T quote it 06rrectly and don't add<br />
to it, and I can quote all these hings about somebody saying that<br />
* the Prime Minister of Australia ig a crook. That you are involved i<br />
a cover up of organised crime. A~ l t-hose things can be said, sc<br />
what do you do about it and how'dQ you feel about it. Because you<br />
are the Prime Minister of the coup'try.<br />
PM I noticed at the beginning that you said that my office is<br />
demeaned, my office is not demeaned by these tactics of R1r Peacoc-k.<br />
There is only one person, and one:: off ice that is demeaned and that<br />
Is Mr Peacock and his office. Because, I woiUd suggest it is no<br />
wonder that on the polls, the majority of Liberal voters prefer me<br />
to be in the position of Prime Å“ iinister t1-ihn Mr Peacock. it is<br />
no wionder because he has been suc i _ n abject failure.* Wha t I<br />
honestly feel sorry about is that; Andrevi Pcacock having desperaL-oly<br />
failed as the leader of the Cpposition has been judged a fail-ure<br />
by his own people hasii't got the trength of character to act<br />
decently. lie knows that ths lea~ osaenttu. Dsh<br />
believe that if these things were true he would havie ir. xcd with ate.<br />
I-ad close friendly relations prcv~ u 3y. ud. hc-haye donc those<br />
things if he believ-, d that I am z. croc-,] and directiad by ro?<br />
I me-an, the questCion ~ s;~ sitzeldf. It in thr, despcrat~ tO ci<br />
of a man not only rejcct(. d by the lctrt but atpised by hir;<br />
own party. The mbajor t-alk here.. iuntil th last tuor tlh-ree v-eck
hao hec~ n the-I activity gcnmoatcd tinh;. nIartV a9FaJraJL </p>
<p>Cda t<br />
Now unfortunately, he hasn't got. the j; Lrength of chiaracter to rise<br />
above these things, and it is a tr69g-dy.<br />
Last time I talked toyou'ori the program, I asked you about<br />
your personal. relation! 3hip with. Anarew Peacock, and it had obviously<br />
deteriorated then, can it get any: lower than it is now?<br />
PM I don't think he can get any lower than he is now. But as<br />
far as the relations I simply can not accept a ma. n who makes<br />
unfounded allegations, tell--lies,:: and k; nows they' are lies. This<br />
is a reflection on the nature of the man and I just am sad about it.<br />
I accept the detioration of the character of. 7 the man. I simply obser-ve.<br />
The majority of Liberal voters are correct in their rejection of his.<br />
DH I know you have to go, but ne quick guestion. Why did you<br />
have to leave the Chamber yesterda7 which triggered the final outbu-zst?<br />
PM Very simple, they get up nd move a censure motion which<br />
everyone in the press gallery treaLed with contempt. I mean, it<br />
was treated with conitemnpt by the professionals in the gallery, bat<br />
treated by everyone in the Parliament. Now when it is so manife. 3tly<br />
contemptuous I amnot going to digriify it by, being there. if there<br />
is a legitimate motion of censure on the G7overnment, then of cou:: se,<br />
as I have in the past, I'll be tho~ e. and as I did at the end* of ': he<br />
last session, destroy MrI Peacock i'l debaite. But : 1 am not going<br />
to dignify this tactic by getting pap and giving it the status of<br />
warranting a Prime Mliniste-rial particpto. Ta hni h<br />
course oZ that this sort of thing hoes on and Mr Steele' Hall in<br />
conjunction -with Mr Peacock issues these lies then I will repudize<br />
them. As, indeed, as I say, they bavq been repudiated by Xr Crelightc-<br />
Burns. The tragedy of al'l. this iz, not the tragedy of the moral<br />
deteri oration of Mr Peacock and J~ i re. pudiation by his ow,, n people~.<br />
That is a phenom~ enon of politic-, nbt of itself tragedy. Perhaps<br />
sad for some. The tragely is thtIthin dis: piritod ' imoral ~~ s~ o<br />
