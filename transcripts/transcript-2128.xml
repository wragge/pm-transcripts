1969 FEDERAL ELECTION<br />
TALK GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. JOHN GORTON,<br />
OVER ABC NETWORK ON WEDNESDAY 15 OCTOBER<br />
In my last talk to you, I spoke of the disastrous effects which<br />
Labor's approaches would have on our own defence and on our overseas<br />
alliances and on Australia's future security generally.<br />
Tonight I will talk of domestic approaches.<br />
The essence of our own approach is that we regard it as our<br />
first task to maintain full employment, to maintain the inflow of overseas<br />
capital for development, to continue immigration at least at its present<br />
level, to continue growth, to protect Australians against inflation and,<br />
gradually, to lighten the burden of income taxation.<br />
In short, our first task is to protect and promote our present<br />
prosperity and, at the same time, to seek to lighten income tax burdens.<br />
In the field of social services, we have done much indeed,<br />
I think, more than any comparable Government has done in any comparable<br />
period of time. And we will obviously do more as it becomes economically<br />
responsible to do so.<br />
But we will not put our present prosperity at risk. We will<br />
not put greater income tax burdens on the wage and salary-earning family<br />
man. We will not risk that inflation which hits the pensioner and the wage<br />
and salary-earner hardest, but which hits all Australians and which will<br />
inhibit that immigration, that growth, that capital inflow which job<br />
opportunity demands should continue.<br />
The Opposition, on the other hand, is prepared to put all<br />
this in danger. They have made promises which will require hundreds of<br />
millions of dollars a year to keep, hundreds of millions of dollars a year<br />
without any provision for increased defence, without any provision for<br />
national development, without any provision for the growing needs of the<br />
States. And those hundreds of millions will come from you the present<br />
income tax payers. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
They will come either by way of increased taxation or by<br />
way of a lack of reduction in taxation or by way of inflation hitting your<br />
pocket. But one way or another you will pay for there is no way of getting<br />
something for nothing. Apart from this general difference of approach between the<br />
Opposition and ourselves, there is a particular matter on which we and the<br />
Opposition differ. As you know, we have already introduced the tapered means<br />
test and age taxation concessions which are real incentives to thrift and<br />
which give real rewards to the thrifty. And now we believe that the first<br />
call for the future on resources for social welfare should be the alleviation<br />
of the lot of those who are still poor.<br />
The Opposition, on the other hand, will provide $ 370 million<br />
a year, not one cent of which will help the needy but all of which will go to<br />
pay pensions to the well-off, for $ 370 million a year is what their plan<br />
will cost if it is put into operation.<br />
We believe that this is essentially wrong and we reject it<br />
because we believe, as I have said, that the lot of the needy should have<br />
first call on our resources.<br />
Our efforts in the next Parliament will be devoted to helping<br />
the children of needy families, to rehabilitation of the handicapped and the<br />
invalid so that they can return to normal life, to giving capital assistance<br />
to institutes helping handicapped children, to ensuring that the buying power<br />
of the pensions we have recently raised does not, over the period, fall, and<br />
to increasing social welfare generally as economic conditions permit.<br />
This to us is a worthier aim than that of the Opposition and<br />
we hope that you on October 25 will agree with us and agree that it is<br />
better for Australians and for Australia.<br />
Note: This talk will be broadcast by the ABC National Network at<br />
