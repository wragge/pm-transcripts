INTERVIEW ON NEW ZEALAND TELEVISION 9 A m<br />
GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR JOHN __ RAGORTON<br />
Interviewer Mr David Beatson 31ST MARCH, 1968<br />
( Beginning not recorded)<br />
PM: it is hard tosay what the out. omewould be,<br />
but as far as we are concerned, we are predisposed to do what we<br />
can to help In relation to what we are asked to do to help by the<br />
countries there.<br />
Q. You have expressed a desire to help your good friends<br />
and neighbours, I believe as you put It, and you also said there was<br />
a limit to what you could spend on defence because of your needs<br />
for internal development. Do you think Australia can make a<br />
greater contribution to the stability of the area by stimulating<br />
economic assistance and through trade ties than it can by supplying<br />
troops and military equipment to overseas bases?<br />
PM:. No, I don't think so, but I think both those avenues of help<br />
are necessary, We are trying through trade ties, and indeed<br />
we would like to see, through traide ties, assistance and stability,<br />
not only for Malaya and Singapore, but for Malaya, Indonesia and<br />
Singapore because these, in our view with Australia and New<br />
Zealand would form a package. If we can increase the whole of<br />
the living standards in fti area, the trading possibilities In the<br />
area, we think this would be good. But there Is also a need for a<br />
military presence or so we were told by those in the area to<br />
provide conditions of stability against subversion, against terrorism,<br />
against the sort of thing that happened In Malaya In the 1950' s.<br />
So I think both those requirements are there. But It Is true, as far<br />
as Australia Is concerned, we have so many requl rements to<br />
improve development, to help progress, to look after the aged and<br />
the ill, so many requirements that we can't sort of push everything<br />
Into just military commitments.<br />
Q. Do you feel that the date that Britain has set for her<br />
withdrawal puts the pressure on Australia and New Zealand to<br />
make decisions about military involvement In South-East Asia?<br />
PM: Yes. I think the latest date, If I might put it that way,<br />
which Britain has set for her withdrawal, which Is quite different<br />
from the dates set for her withdrawal previously, and the doubt<br />
which previously wasn't a doubt that there would be a British naval<br />
and air contingent there, able to come to the area when they were<br />
asked for, with some real significant military capacity, which now<br />
we don't know whether will be there or not; It looks as if It won't,<br />
but the withdrawal of that Idea, coupled with the acceleration of<br />
total withdrawal of grctund forces, does provide not only Britain<br />
and Australia, but Britain, Australia, Singapore and Malaysia with<br />
problems which obviously weren't there when 1975 was the date<br />
for final withdrawal of ground troops and when It was, as we<br />
understood It, part of the plans of withdrawal that there would be<br />
a naval and air contingent from Britain available for the area. / 2 </p>

Q. Australia enjoys trade ties with the People's Republic<br />
of China to a degree, and also with Japan, another major force in the<br />
area. Do you think that these strings can be draWfitogether through<br />
your Influence throughout the S'outh-East Asian area to form some sort<br />
of mutual assistance or non-aggression agreement which will guarantee<br />
the security and stability of the area?<br />
PM: Well, I think our trade ties with Japan, which are quite<br />
strong, indeed very strong, and Increasing Japan Is one of our best<br />
buyers of wool, for example will draw us closer towards Japan, but<br />
I don't know that this will contribute terrifically to the stability of the<br />
region because Japan Is no threat to the stability of the region but<br />
rather Japan Is one of the factors which helps towards the stability<br />
of the region. Japan Is investing heavily In the region, Japan is helping<br />
the economies to grow And so, yes, we will be Increasingly<br />
trading with Japan. I think Japan will be a stabilising force in the<br />
area, but this is just in the course of the things that are likely to<br />
happen. Cur trade ties with China are mainly that we sell them a<br />
great deal of goods, particularly wheat, mainly wheat. Vle don't buy<br />
a great deal from them. I would like to think that China would be<br />
a stabilising influence In the area, but I don't think It will. I hope It<br />
will, but I doubt It.<br />
Q. This week, Mr Gorton, the LSouth-East Asia Treaty<br />
Organisation is meeting In New Zealand. Partnership In SEATO* has<br />
been a controversial point with many South-East Asian countries.<br />
Do you think that in view of the need for new regional defence arrangements<br />
that we are going to have to look for something new to replace<br />
or supersede SEATO?<br />
PM: For what particular purpose? For the purpose of the<br />
security of Australia and New Zealand?<br />
Q. Of the whole South-East region.<br />
PM: I see. Well, I don't think I foresee an alternative to<br />
SEATO, though it has some difficulties about It, particularly the<br />
participation of some countries that are out of the region. But as far<br />
as Australia is concerned and New Zealand is concerned, I think the<br />
ANZUS pact is the one which provides the greatest security for us.<br />
Q. Do you think our security really depends on the total<br />
security of the whole South-E-ast Asia region?<br />
PM: " Depends" Is a strong word. I think our security Is<br />
affected by what happens in the South-East Asia region here. But<br />
assuming that the worst happened in the whole South-East Asian<br />
region, then I think our security would depend on the alliance with<br />
the United 2tates through the ANZUS pact. Now it would be much<br />
better, of course, If the worst didn't happen In the South East Asian<br />
area, and we did not have to depend on the ANZUS pact. But I think<br />
the SEATO Treaty Organisation Y. ill help to see that the worst<br />
doesn't happen in the South-7-ast Asian region. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Q. At the moment the ANZUS partners, although perhaps not as<br />
such, are involved in Viet Nam and you have said you feel the<br />
cost of the Vic: operation to Australia must be held to<br />
about the c. a~ as last year. In view of this, does this<br />
really mcc-n, zecritics suggest, that you are less<br />
enamoured of 1ted States and more sceptical about the<br />
commitment to Viet Nam than Mr Holt your predecessor?<br />
PM: I don't think it does. You said we kept it at the<br />
level of last year. Well, this is not quite true, though I<br />
understand how it could be said. It was, I think, October or<br />
November of last year that we increased our commitment to<br />
Viet Nam by some one-third, so that now we have got somewhere<br />
between 8, 000 and 9, 000 fighting men there, which we mn,, only<br />
provide but supply with arms and ammunition, aeroplanes,<br />
ships, food, logistics look after completely. And this is<br />
quite a significant contribution from a country of our own size.<br />
Now, we are keeping it at a recently-expanded level. I think<br />
that it is a significant contribution and one which is worthy of<br />
an ally to be given, and I would want to think long and hard<br />
before any addition to that was made because of the requirements<br />
for Australia itself to develop into a significant power as quickly<br />
as possible, to meet all its other requirements. I don't believe.<br />
this means that we are less enamoured with the United States.<br />
I don't believe it means any indication of diminution of our belief<br />
that it was right to go in there to try and give the South Vietnamese<br />
the right of self-determination, It is just a sort of look at what<br />
we are providing, of all the other things we need to do, and<br />
whether what we are providing in relation to all the other things<br />
we need to do is a reasonable contribution. I think it is.<br />
Q'i This is an independent attitude, in other words, a<br />
specifically Australian attitude towards the involvement<br />
PM: Well, it is, but on the other hand, of course, we<br />
haven't been asked to increase the contribution, but that would be<br />
the approach I would have to the situation which, I suppose, you<br />
could call an Australian attitude.<br />
Q. Since the military situation in Viet Nam does appear<br />
to have deteriorated quite considerably in the latter part of last<br />
year and early this year, do you think the time has now come for<br />
the Allies to press more firmly for thorough investigations to<br />
open up peace negotiations?<br />
PM: Well, we would certainly want to support any peace<br />
negotiations that led to a genuine peace. We wouldn't be<br />
interested ourselves for pressing for so-called peace negotiations<br />
which, in fact, were not designed to secure the sort of peace<br />
in which the South Vietnamese could run their own affairs, but<br />
were designed for a disguised surrender to the North. We'vye<br />
seen countries I think Laos is an example where peace<br />
negotiations led to a composite government and agreement<br />
that it would be run by a composite government, and we have<br />
seen what has happened as a result of that, If we can do<br />
anything to achieve talks about a peace which will provide the<br />
South Vietnamese without North Viet, namese intereference<br />
with the right of selecting their own government, and living<br />
under that government without fear, then we would be in favour<br />
of that ind of arrangement. We are not interested in 9 / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
PM. ( Contd. thing,; s which are called peace talks but which in fact are surrender<br />
talks.<br />
Q. Moving on now to questions on the relationship between<br />
Australia and New Zealand, Mr Gorton. New Zealand is one of<br />
Australia's major markets. Have you been concerned about the<br />
economic conditions here?<br />
PM: Well, the economic conditions no, I ca't say<br />
I've been concerned about the economic conditions. Indeed I don't<br />
know a great deal. I can't discuss a great deal about the<br />
economic conditions, but you are quite right, New Zealand is a<br />
significant market for Australia, and I would hope Australia<br />
would grow into being a significant market for New Zealand.<br />
Q: The point that I make here is that certain measures have<br />
been taken, First of all, the devaluation of the New Zealand<br />
dollar which makes imports to New Zealand look more expensive<br />
and our exports look more attractive, and certain other measures<br />
which have been to dampen down the demand for imported goods<br />
must have reflected themselves on the marketing trends or rather,<br />
the exporting trends in Australiab Has there been any concern<br />
about these measures?<br />
PM: No, not particularly. You seg, even though there wa's<br />
devaluation in the New Zealand currency, it only brought it down<br />
to a par, or roughly to a par with the Australian currency whitch<br />
had previously been devalued and the New Zealand currency<br />
hadn't, and so in some ways, I suppose, that didn't make it<br />
much more difficult for us. Our trade has been growing well,<br />
perhaps it hasn't been growing but at least it's been fairly<br />
constant over the last two years with New Zealand, and if it<br />
hasn't been growing, I think it is possibly partly because of<br />
import restrictions which need to be put on in any country when<br />
the balance of payments gets out of kilter.<br />
Q. The other question, of course, relating to New Zealand<br />
exports to Aistralia is that we are a dairy efficient country, and<br />
Australia is now engaged on a reform of the dairy industry. In<br />
view of the fact that it is obviously going to cost a great deal of<br />
money to bring about the reform you envisage eventually,<br />
wouldn't it be cheaper really to let New Zealand products in on<br />
the Australian market?<br />
PM: I don't think it would for these reasons. Yes, we want<br />
to reform the dairying industry in Australa because we have got<br />
a lot of I won't call them inefficient but uneconomic:<br />
dairy farmers, and we would like to get them into some other<br />
form of production or to get a lot of unecanomic dairy farmers<br />
combined into one economic area. But even if all the uneconom-ic<br />
dairy farmers went out of production, if all northern production<br />
of dairy products in Australia stopped, the southern areas could<br />
produce not only all the butter that Australia required, and:<br />
probably at a competitive price with the butter from any other<br />
country in the world, but would also produce surpluses which<br />
would need to be sold abroad. I don't see, in my forecast for the<br />
future, a market opening up in Australia for New Zealand dairy a, 4 h </p>
<p>PM ( Contd) produce. I see Australia and New Zealand working together to<br />
try and keep prices reasonable overseas for dairy produce from<br />
our joint countries, but the areas where I think the greatest hope<br />
lies are in forest products being available in greater quantities<br />
to be sent to Australia and an increase in New Zealand secondary<br />
industry, and a market for that secondary industry in Australia<br />
and vice versa. These are, I think, where the real hopes or<br />
expanded trade lie.<br />
Q. Can you see really significant opportunities in terms of<br />
this belief of yours that we should be restricted to these two<br />
areas for New Zealand's exporting future in Australia when most<br />
of our exports are, in fact, primary produce?<br />
PM: Yes, I think I can because I think that the Australian<br />
market will grow all right it's what, 12 million people now,<br />
which is not very large. It will be 25 million before very long,<br />
aad that will be twice as big a market. New Zealand will have,<br />
as it has now, an advantage in that market under the Free Trade<br />
Agreement, and I expect New Zealand will diversify. I expect<br />
New Zealand will build up its secondary industries in conjunction<br />
with Australia or by itself, and have more of those kind of things<br />
to export. Indeed, I think they will follow the same path that<br />
Australia has followed. Once we were entirely dependent on.<br />
primary industry, ' r almost entirely dependent. Now we have<br />
so diversified, built up so many secondary industries that even<br />
the sort of terrific drought we are suffering from now doesn~ t<br />
have the economic effect on us that it would have had. I know<br />
Now Zealand will always be dependent to a great extent on*<br />
primary production and the export of primary production, bu t I<br />
believe that it will certainly greatly expand in secondary<br />
industries, want a market for those secondary industries where<br />
it has preference and will get that in Australia. I think that<br />
New Zealand and Australian firms will tend to come together<br />
in joint enterprises and that this is the area which will expand<br />
for the future for the good of both of us.<br />
Q. Talking about joint enterprises, there has been a<br />
great deal of talk about union between the two countries. Do<br />
you think the time has now come, as some people suggest, that<br />
some form of joint secretariat or organisation common to both<br />
countries should begin to plan for closer relationship and closer<br />
ties between the development and overall efforts of Australi4<br />
and New Zealand to penetrate markets elsewhere?<br />
PM: Well, I hadn't thought about a joint secretariat but<br />
I do believe that our defence chiefs in New Zealand and Australia<br />
are planning together more than they used to do, that your Prime<br />
Minister and my Prime Minister, your Ministers and our<br />
Ministers are planning together more than they used to do not<br />
in the sense of a political union but in the sense of a joint<br />
effort. I think this is happening more than it used to happen.<br />
I think perhaps it could happen even more in the future. I have<br />
read about this proposal for political union betweL.. n the two<br />
countries. If and when that ever becomes a possibility, it will<br />
only become a possiliity if the people of New Zealand say " This<br />
is what we want to have at some particular time" and the people </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PM ( Contd) of Australia say, " This is fine. We will agree to it at some<br />
particular time". But at the moment, what is far more significant<br />
than that is that we should plan together in defence, plan together<br />
in foreign affairs, plan together to expand our joint trade, plan together<br />
to work together in the region in which we live.<br />
Q. Mr Gorton, thank you very much. </p>
