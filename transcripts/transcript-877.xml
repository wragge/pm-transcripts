Cabi. aet has now concluded its fi. r -t full<br />
meeting since the election, A great deal of ground hrs<br />
been covered. Apa ft from our eXcv. nuins tion of the r 1ign<br />
situation as it relates to Malaysiww, e were anxious to<br />
put in tr-: sin various po1licy promises we made, ari; d -to be<br />
ready to meet the new Parliament with a series of positive<br />
legislative ieasuresa In this statement, I propose, as briefly<br />
as possible, to review the Cabinet-bjusiness of the last<br />
two days. </p>
<p>2<br />
MALAYSIA<br />
The Government has had the military and political<br />
situation between Indone sia sar. IMalaysia under constant attention.<br />
A full review of the current situation., including various<br />
activities in Sarawak and Sabah, was given to Cabinet by the<br />
Minister for External Affairs.<br />
Our Australian military advisers have thoroughly<br />
examined the military situation and have given the Government<br />
their assessment as to the adequacy of the military for.-ae, already<br />
available to Malaysia, Having considered this assessment, the<br />
Government earlier concluded, and still concludes, that tLiere is<br />
no immediate need for further Australian assistance, This assessment<br />
is shared by Malaysian and British authorities,<br />
Australian forces of all arms already are, and have<br />
for some considerable time been, in Malaysia placed there for,<br />
among other things, the defence of that country, which comprises<br />
not only Sarawak and Sabah but ( it should be remembered) Malaya<br />
and Singapore. Australian naval vessels stationed in Malaysia<br />
are already available for patrol and escort work, and RA, A. AF.<br />
fighter squadrons are berin kept at a s; oto of operational<br />
readiness for use in Malaysian air defence.<br />
The Australian Government is maintaining close and most<br />
harmonious consultation with the Malaysian and British Governments<br />
concerning the military situation and concerning the need for any<br />
further assistance from Australian forces. In addition to this,<br />
the Government is consulting with the Malaysian Government to see<br />
what it can do to contribute to the development of Malaysia's<br />
own defence effort.<br />
The Government believes that there has been and is<br />
considerable scope in the diplomatic field to try to end border<br />
incidents and to maintain peace in the area, We have boon most<br />
active in these matters, We have, in particular, made our position<br />
abundantly clear to the Indonesian Government, emphasising that,<br />
although we sincerely desire friendly relations with Indonesia,<br />
which it regards as important for both countries we also stand<br />
firmly for the political and territorial intogrity of Malaysia<br />
and have given definite militcry undertakings in support of it.<br />
We have informed Indonesia that we disapprove of Indonesias<br />
rcfusl! to recognise Malaysia, and its threat to crush Malaysia,<br />
and that my statemont of 25th September, 1963, that Australia<br />
would assist Malaysian and British forces to defend Malaysia<br />
against external attock or externally inspirsi od . sbvo:. si C, ro. ins<br />
unaltered. The Government welcomes the forthcoming conversations<br />
between President Sukarno and the United States Attorney-Goneral,<br />
Mr. Robert Kennedy, We are most hopeful that the discussions<br />
will load to a clearer understanding on the part of President<br />
Sukarno of the seriousness with which the United States and her<br />
allies regard present developments on the Indonesian-Malaysian<br />
border in Borneo, </p>
<p>3-<br />
HOUI TNG<br />
We gave a groat deal of attention to tho conrlx<br />
problems which are involved in cottling the-dotails of the<br />
Housing Subsidy Scheme,<br />
As will be understood, many marginal questions<br />
arise about the eligibility of persons for subsidy the<br />
nature of the savings which will attract subsidy., he rdato<br />
of operation of the scheme, and so one We are dterm . neTd<br />
to settle all those matters of detail in time to present<br />
the necessary legislation early in the new Session,<br />
We arranged for a Committee of Ministers and<br />
officers to work out the matters of detail in the light<br />
of the Cabinet discussions. When the scheme has taken its<br />
final statutory forn, it will be cacted to operate as<br />
from the 2nd December, 1963, the first working day<br />
after the elections had authorised us to proceed. This<br />
means that when eligibility has been finally determined,<br />
contracts entered into on or after December 2, 1963, by<br />
eligible persons who satisfy the conditions, will qualify<br />
for purposes of subsidy,<br />
The new Commonwealth Department of Housing has been<br />
established under the Ministerial control of Mr, Bury.<br />
We have appointed the Secretary of the new Department.<br />
He is Mr. JoF, Nimmo, who has in recent years<br />
been Deputy Secretary in the Prime Minister's Department,<br />
Prior to that, Mr. Nimno was First Assistnt Secretary in<br />
charge of the Banking, Trade and Industry Division of the<br />
Treasuryo I have referred to the Housing Subsidy Scheme The<br />
other housing proposals in the Policy Speech are being<br />
closely examined by the new Minister and Depart mnt, I will<br />
hope that at a fairly early date, steps towards the-; putting<br />
into effect of the Housing Insurtnce proposals can. be<br />
announced. </p>
<p>4<br />
CHILI) ENDOWMENT<br />
In the Policy Speech I said<br />
" Child Endownont will be raised to<br />
per week for the third and subsequent<br />
children Having in mind the educational<br />
responsibilities of parents, 15/-per week<br />
endow eont will be paid in respect of all<br />
full-tino student children fron 16 to 21."<br />
Cabinet has decided that the new rate of<br />
endowment and also the entitlorent of student children<br />
will connmence as fron the 14th January, 1964.<br />
The Minister for Social Services will<br />
announce further details, including the description of<br />
those student children who are to be regarded as<br />
" full tine", </p>
<p>FDUCATION<br />
We discussed arrangements for Commonwealth<br />
Secondary and Technical Scholarships and for assistance<br />
to science buildings and equipment for secondary schools.<br />
Senator Gorton as Minister assisting me in<br />
Commonwealth activities in relation to Research and<br />
Education will be in touch with State Ministers of Education<br />
and independent school authorities in relation to the<br />
scholarships and also in relation to science buildings<br />
and equipment. Obviously there will be many important<br />
administrative arrangements to be made,<br />
It is not practicable, having regard to the<br />
fact that examinations for scholarships cannot be usefully<br />
organised when the school year is about to begin, to make<br />
the scholarship scheme effective until the 1965 year<br />
It will clearly, having regard to the divergent practices<br />
in various States, take some little time to organise a<br />
system of awarding scholarships by competitive examination.<br />
However? arrangements for grants for science buildings<br />
and equipment will be put into effect as soon as possible<br />
after my colleague has had the necessary conferences.<br />
The Commonwealthts Committee which is enquiring<br />
into the future of tertiary education is expected to make<br />
its report in March. It would, we thinl4 be wise to have<br />
the benefit of this report before we fix the final machinery<br />
for the Technical Scholarships and the grants for Technical<br />
Schools to which I referred in my Policy Speech, There<br />
will be no avoidable delay. We want to see the whole of<br />
our educational proposals going into effect as soon as<br />
possible. </p>
<p>6<br />
NOT THERN DEVELOPENT<br />
We discussed and approved the constitution<br />
of the Division of Northern Development in the Department<br />
of National Development. It will be assisted by the<br />
appropriate inter-dopartmental committees drawn from<br />
those Commonwealth Departments and Organisations which<br />
have special knowledge, agreed upon the following<br />
statement of functions In conjunction with other Departments<br />
or Government organizations possessing<br />
special knowledge or facilities to<br />
keep under review the natural resources<br />
of northern Australia,<br />
To examine broad questions of policy<br />
which need special consideration in the<br />
interests of fostering northern<br />
development.<br />
To advise on northern development including<br />
any proposals submitted to the Commonwealth<br />
by the Governments of Western Australia<br />
and Queensland.<br />
To ensure that basic mapping ans surveys<br />
of resources are maintained and<br />
co-ordinated with developmental<br />
requirements.<br />
To publish maps, reports and other data<br />
relevant to the resources of northern<br />
Australia and their development, </p>
<p>WATER PE, S OUML<br />
The Australian Water Resources Council wnich<br />
we established has put in hand the preparation of<br />
estimates of the requirements of the States and the<br />
Commonwealth Territories so that the rate of measurement<br />
of surface water and the investigation of underground<br />
water resources should be acceleratede<br />
The Standing Committee of the Council will<br />
meet on January 29 and 30 to formulate recommendations<br />
to the Council of Ministers which we are endeavouring<br />
to arrange for February, After that Council has met,<br />
we anticipate that firm proposals for an expedited<br />
programme of water resources measurement will come before<br />
the Cabinet. </p>
<p>We considered the Agreement which has been<br />
made between Hamersley Iron Pty. Ltd. and the State<br />
Government of Western Australia. The company concerned<br />
is in substance a partnership between Conzinc Rio Tinto<br />
( Aust.) Ltd. and the Kaiser Steel Corporation.<br />
The agreement contemplates development of<br />
the immense deposits of iron ore which occur in the<br />
Hamersley Range area; first by straight-out export<br />
of iron ore, and later by the organisation of a secondary<br />
processing plant and the ultimate establishment of an<br />
integrated iron and steel plant. Much large capital<br />
investment is involved, for the work to be done will,<br />
in addition to mining facilities, include roads, water,<br />
town establishment, a railway line and a harbour.<br />
Cabinet decided to approve the export of<br />
200m. tons of iron ore pursuant to this contract over a<br />
period which is estimated to be 21 years. Our export<br />
approval is subject to the use of good mining practices<br />
and approval of price as being reasonable, having regard<br />
to the overall national interests. </p>
<p>9<br />
MEAT EXPORTS<br />
The Minister for Trade explained in<br />
detail the nature of the negotiations now being<br />
conducted overseas by a Mission headed by Sir Alan<br />
Westerraan. Weo approved of the lines being followed.<br />
It is, of course, for obvious reasons, not desirable<br />
to say what proposals are being exchanged but there was<br />
complete agreement upon the way in which the negotiations<br />
for Australia were being conducted.<br />
VARIOUS<br />
A number of other matters were exaninodo<br />
Some of them gave rise to decisions which are suitable<br />
for administrative action, while others gave rise to<br />
further enquiries, the result of which will no doubt load<br />
to future decisions.<br />
CANBERRA, 16th January, 1964. </p>
