ANNUAL CONVENTION OF THE NSW DIVIION<br />
OF THE LIBERAL PAR'iY OF AUiMTI<br />
SYDNEY, N. S. W. 19 SEPTEMER 1970<br />
Spech by the Prime Minister, MrJohn Gorton<br />
Mr. Attwell, Ministers, Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
It is not my intention to speak to you for very long because I hope that tonight,<br />
having spoken to you for a short time, we will be able to spend a much longer time<br />
in a question and answer session, in which those of you who are here and who are the<br />
backbone of the Liberal Party will have the opportunity to raise those matter--which<br />
are on your minds, and to give me the opportunity to try to answer the querieO and<br />
the questions and the criticisms you may have. I feel that that perhaps is the way in<br />
which 1; 2 can get the greatest value from this meeting, and I hope that when the time<br />
comes you will be not at all backward in raising those matters which are foremost in<br />
your mind3. But before that time does come, there are some things I would like to say.<br />
Mr President, we have been in office, as a government in Australia, for twenity-one<br />
years or a little more. They were twenty-one years in which there have been three<br />
wars first Korea, then the Malayan emergency and now Vietnam. And they were<br />
twenty-one years in which there was great national development and un-precendented<br />
industrial progress. There has been a greater increase in the population of<br />
Australia than any other country has had, except Asian countries, in a similar<br />
period of time. It has been a period of greatly expanded trade, a period in which<br />
our exports, particularly our secondary exports, have been greatly expanded, and<br />
a period of growing involvement with that area of Asia to which we finid ourselves<br />
contiguous and which will be so important for future generations of Australians.<br />
It has been, too, a period of improvement of the living standards Of all<br />
Australians and of improvement for the population generally. It has been a period of<br />
greatly expanded social services and of greatly expanded opportunity for the<br />
individual to express himself to the top of his bent. I think we have all helped to<br />
bring this about over this period of time, because of s~ ome basic philoso'phies.<br />
When we came into off ice, we stood for the right of the individual to engage<br />
in the occupation of his choice, and to so conduct himself in that occupation as he<br />
believed best. We stood against the concept that the individual ought to be told by<br />
the state how he could conduct his enterprise or whether he could conduct his<br />
enterprise, because at that time, as now, our opponents held to the idea that there<br />
should be limitations on the individual in conducting his enterprise, that there should<br />
be some fields in which he could not enter that government knew better than an<br />
individual what is good for that individual. We stood against that. 0 0 0 0 / 2 </p>
<p>We stood for the concept that -aie Government shou~ ld create a climate<br />
where individual enterprise was encouraged. We didn't stand for laissez-faire,<br />
and we don't stand for It now. But we stood for a concept that we could create a<br />
climate where individual enterprise was encouraged and where the planning of<br />
enterprise and its expansion was a matter for the myriad individuals engaged in<br />
the myriad enterprises which make up Australian life. And we stood against the<br />
concept that all planning in all fields should be undertaken by a government or<br />
governments and forced upon the citizens of this country.<br />
We stood for a political system where elected representatives of a<br />
party should themselves decide the policies to be followed by that party, and v,, ie<br />
stood against the system which made elected representatives subject to direction<br />
and ins truction from unelected persons from outside. And that we were righit in<br />
these attitudes is, I believe, evident from the results of this past twenty or nearly<br />
twent" t-one years.<br />
And those things that we stood for then, we stand for now. The things<br />
we stood against we still stand against and our opponents still stand for the planning<br />
by governments of all enterprise, for, in cases, the prohibition of individuals<br />
entering an enterprise, and until just recently for the direction of elected<br />
representatives by persons who are non-elected from outside. I say " until just<br />
recently" t because there is an admission from our opponents that in at least ole<br />
State that of Victoria this was what applied. And personally, I do not believe<br />
that they will change this but time alone will tell.<br />
Sir, in the last few years in the last three years many new problems<br />
have appeared for Australia. We have found ourselves in a situation where the<br />
United Kingdom, under whose protection we have, as a nation, lived, is withdrawing<br />
from Malaysia and Singapore, the countries to our North. And although that has<br />
been slightly altered by a change of Government in the United Kingdom, still there<br />
is only a token force left behind compared to the responsibility previously<br />
assumed by the United Kingdom Government.<br />
And we have found ourselves in a situation where the United States o!<br />
America is questioning its approach to, and its involvement in, the problems of<br />
Asia. These two things alone have vastly changed the world in which Australia<br />
lives. And so our defence has necessarily had to occupy our attention in a way<br />
which has not been necessary in the past years of our history.<br />
We have found ourselves in a situation where our involvement with the<br />
countries of Asia, our political involvement and our economic assistance, has<br />
necessarily had to grow because we are contiguous to, and in a sense a part Of this<br />
region, and what happens there will ultimately and inevitably affect us.<br />
We have also found ourselves in a situation where the markets overseas<br />
for our rural products, which had fluctuated in the past,, but had been taken, for<br />
granted as markets in which we could profitably sell for most of the time, are now<br />
threatened by a possible entry of the United Kingdom into the European Economic<br />
Community. / 3 </p>
<p>And we have tound-our selves, too, in Australia In some strange new<br />
situation dt politics. Because for the first time, we have nwny people in our<br />
community who challenge the verdict of the ballot box, who challenge the worl-ings<br />
of democracy to elect a government, who urge that people should take to the streets<br />
if they are unhappy with what a government, democratically elected, does.<br />
And we have an Opposition an alternative government supporting, to a<br />
great extent, those who are taking these new approaches to politics. And this must<br />
not be underrated. I know that our opponents pretend that they do not altogether<br />
support the overthrow of authority as has been urged by Dr Cairns, one ofl the front<br />
bench supporters of the Opposition. I know that they attempt hesitantly to<br />
disengage from those who wish to make the streets the arbiter of political decisions.<br />
But I believe that anyone who looks at what they are doing must come to<br />
the cunclvt'son that they are frightened to come out and condemn what ought to be<br />
condemned. It is all very well for the Premier of South Australia to dissociate<br />
himself irom a moratorium movement which seeks to sit at city inter Cection but<br />
having done that, he then seeks to instruct the head of his police not to prevent<br />
people sitting at city intersections. It is all very well for the Leader of the<br />
Opposition to make soothing noises as to what is going on, but just yesterday wie<br />
saw him speaking to a crowd an orderly crowd but a crowd that had Vietcong<br />
flags flying above them, and above his head as he spoke to them.<br />
And the people of this country, I believe, need, not as a political<br />
gimmick, but as something that goes to the very heart of politics, to make u-.<br />
their minds as to whether they believe the verdict of the ballot box should be<br />
accepted or whether they think it ought to be challenged in the streets. This i~ s a<br />
great new issue between ourselves and our opponents. Let me develo-) it a little.<br />
Some attempts have been made to suggest that we do not believe in a right<br />
of dissent and this is completely and utterly untrue. I believe that we would be<br />
those who, harder than anybody else, would fight to retain the right of dissent, would<br />
fight to retain the right of criticism of a government, to fight to retain the right<br />
of those who disagree to express that disagreement in all reasonable forms. ' Re<br />
do not object to rather do we pledge ourselves to protect~-the right to din en. t.<br />
But equally do we believe t hat there are civil rights of a majority OY^<br />
Australians, that the majority of Australians have rights to use the streets ifI they<br />
wish to without being impeded, that they have the right to use public buildings,<br />
without having those buildings invaded and stink bombs let off as has happenied in<br />
post offices throughout Australia.<br />
We believe that there is a right and a need to protect the individual against<br />
intimidation by those who disagree with what the Government is doing threats<br />
and intimidation. And perhaps if I can encapsulate it in this way, I would say this<br />
we would agree with Voltaire completely when he said " I1d isagree with what you<br />
say, but I would fight to the death for your right to say it". This is our credo too.<br />
0 * 1 4 </p>
<p>But we would not go on, as thc'qe who would seek to take over the streets<br />
would go on, to change that statement to saying " I disagree with what you do, but<br />
I will fight to the death for your right to do it" because there is no rignt to interfere<br />
with the civil rights of the majority of the Australian people. And this will be a<br />
matter engaging the attention of our Government very, very soon, and of the<br />
State Governments, I know.<br />
Sir, there has been this year discussion on the question of the financial<br />
management of this country of Australia and of the Budget for the year in front of<br />
us, and I would like to say some words on that.<br />
We approached the planning the financial planning for this year within<br />
certain fixed parameters. We had already decided, in conjunction with the<br />
Premiers, that there should be, as far as was economically responsible, greater<br />
sums of money available to State Governments than in the past, to enable them to<br />
tackk. those problems of education, of health, of communications, the myriad<br />
problems with which they are initially concerned. And so, at the Premiers'<br />
Conference, we had made a new deal which greatly increased the amount of finance<br />
available to State Governments this year and for the ensuing years over what would<br />
have been available had the old system and the old agreement prevailed-son-ie 12 per<br />
cent increase in the amounts available for expenditure. And this was one parameter<br />
which we had to regard as we approached our planning for this year.<br />
Secondly, we had a need, an obvious need, to ensure, as far as we<br />
could ensure, that the rate of inflation was slowed, and not allowed to continue in<br />
the way in which it corntinued in the last quarter of last financial year. Up until the<br />
last quarter of the last financial year, the rate had been not unreasonable 3 -) er<br />
cent or 3 point something per cent but in the last quarter it had gone to 5, over<br />
per cent. This has got to be stopped. We had to ensure that it was stopped for<br />
if it were not, then the results would have been that increased wages were nothing<br />
but fool's gold, that those in the rural industries in Australia would have been hit<br />
and unable to pass on the cost increases that they would have had to bear; that all<br />
those on fixed incomes all superannuants, all pensio-ners, would have had this<br />
bleeding sore of inflation withdrawing from them their capacity to buy the thi"-gs<br />
they needed to live. And this was another essential element we had to bear in mird.<br />
Then, too, we had said and I think properly said that one of our<br />
objectives would be to reduce the rate of direct taxation on people throughout<br />
Australia. This, indeed, had been recommended to us as the most importa; t thing<br />
to be done in the Budget by the Liberal Party organisations throughout Australia<br />
speaking through their Federal delegates coming to Cainberra. And this, too, we<br />
felt we ought to do, and I felt I ought to do because I had promised to do it. And<br />
this was another necessity we had to meet. 11. </p>
<p>And so in the result we did this. We increased Indirect taxation and this<br />
has caused some criticism but after all, in all other countrtes of the world that I<br />
know of, significant countries, civilised countries economically speaking there has<br />
been a swing from direct to indirect taxation. And surely that swing must be in line<br />
with general liberal thinking, because there is no need for a person to buy more<br />
cigarettes unless he makes a choice to do it, or to drink more wine unless he makes<br />
a choice to do it, or to use more petrol unless he makes a choice to do so. What<br />
we have done is to reduce the direct tax on the individual and if he then chooses to<br />
buy things which are not essential, that is his choice and we, as Liberals, have<br />
always stood for the right of choice. If he doesn't do that, he has more opportunity<br />
to save, or more opportunity to buy the necessities for his family.<br />
I believe that by the end of this financial year, this Budget will have been<br />
seen to be one of the great Budgets of Australia, provided that that which we have done<br />
to contain inflation is not damaged by organisations we do not control, increasing<br />
wages throughout Australia without paying regard to the productivity increase<br />
which alone can thoroughly justify an increase in wages and make an increase in<br />
wages really valid and really essential.<br />
May I in conclusion before we reach this question time, deal with two<br />
other subjects and forgive me if I may seem self-centred in this, but I would like<br />
to refresh your memory of some of the things which have been done in the last two<br />
and three quarter years, because a great deal in fact has been done.<br />
We have brought in a new oil pricing policy as a result of the discovery<br />
of oil in Bass Strait, subject to great criticism at the time, but which now is<br />
admitted to be working out to the benefit of the Australian consumer in that the price<br />
arranged for Australian oil is now less than would be required to import oil, and<br />
to the benefit of those seeking for oil throughout Australia, for we must find more.<br />
We have taken steps again subject to criticism at first at the times they<br />
were taken to preserve as much as possible for Australians the equity in the new<br />
developments and the new mineral discoveries taking place throughout Australia.<br />
We have not sought to legislate for this in any way because if we did if we sought<br />
to lay down a distinct policy on it, it would be inflexible and it would be inapplicable<br />
to an area where there are so many problems and so many different circumstances.<br />
But we have let it be knovmwn abroad, that as a government we wish to see that<br />
Australians are offered equity participation In the development of this country and<br />
this has had a significant and measurable effect on the offerings that have been<br />
made to Australia. We have laid down the guidelines in which overseas comoanies<br />
can borrow in Australia so that there is more incentive to give equity to Australians,<br />
because the more equity that is given to Australians the more borrowing is allowed<br />
inside Australia. We have brought in convertible notes and we have, on a couple of<br />
occasions you will remember one just last week protected where we thought it<br />
was in the national interest to protect Australian companies. ./ 6 </p>
<p>6.<br />
We hav'e-. ineazsed-soc ial servi~ es in this country to a degree to which they<br />
have never-beeni increased over a comparable time as much as we have done. This<br />
tends to be obscured because in this last Budget there was just a ' hold the line'<br />
pension increase, but fif you go back to 1968 and if you see the rise in the pensions<br />
since that time and compare it with the rise in the coot of living, you will see that<br />
in that 9perlod of time the actual benefits to pensioners of all kinds ha.-very greatly<br />
increased indeed. And there is much more to be done, I know, but let us as Liberals<br />
not think that we have dropped behind when in fact we have, in real terms, increased<br />
these benefits. We have taken away the fear of long-term illness in hospitalS. We still<br />
have to deal with the problem of long-term illness in nursing homes. VWe still have<br />
things to do to help low income families with many children. This was partof our<br />
policy at the last election. This will be carried out during our period ofZ gover-nment.<br />
This I Rm sure you would, as Liberals, wish to see us carry out and indeed we will.<br />
Sir, I have in fact here about six pages of the things that we have done. I<br />
won't read them out for it would take too long. But were it not for this Government,<br />
I do not believe there would be a chance for the development of an alumninium !-ndustry<br />
in Queensland, which could be the greatest development that that State has known in<br />
the Ncrth of Brisbane; if it were not for this Governiment, there would be no<br />
Institute of Marine Science which could make Australia the outstanding country in<br />
the world in relation to marine biology; if it were not f or this Governmflent, there<br />
would be no scheme for the provision of libraries in all secondary schools. I will<br />
stop. But there are many things I think we can be please6d about and you caIn too<br />
For the future, we will carry cut the programme that we put before you.<br />
I do not think we have broken one promise yet and I car, assure you that before the<br />
term of this Goverrment is finished, every promise made at the last election V/ ill<br />
be fulfilled. But these are finite things, these are definite things. What is eve.-, m-, ore<br />
important than that for us is to bear this in mind. At the beginning of my tall' to<br />
you I said what we stood for twenty years ago and what we stand for now, what we were<br />
againt twenty years ago and what we are against now. And I do ask ycu to study<br />
our opponents because they have not changed one whit from the policies they held<br />
twenty years ago. They still believe in nationalisation and it is still in their platform.<br />
They are still swayed by unions affiliated through their conferences, many of them<br />
communist dominated unions. They would still destroy our foreign and our dei~ ence<br />
policy. They would still seek to interfere in the liveG of every single Australia n<br />
in this country. e a s. 7 </p>
<p>There has not been one single bit of constructive criticism put forward<br />
since we have been in government. Wide statements about the need, the very<br />
definite need for-better cities,. statements about the need for more adequate<br />
sewerage, statements about anything which is going to require large sums of money<br />
to implement, and of course the needs are there because no country is perfect. But<br />
there has been no indication of how these would be carried or of what burden.-would<br />
be laid upon Australians to try and carry them out; burdens in the form of increased<br />
taxes or inflation or control by bureaucrats from Canberra. Their objectives-are<br />
still the same, their controllers are still the same. If they come into government,<br />
the results of what they would do would be the same as those results which led<br />
them to be thrown out of government twenty odd years ago.<br />
There is no -alteration there. There is a great attempt to pretend there<br />
is an alteration, to pretend that the nationalisation programme has been~ drorned,<br />
to preand that they are not influenced still by outside bodies and by extreme leftwing<br />
bodies. Look at their actions in the moratorium and I believe you would<br />
agree with me that what they are pretending to be is not what they are. They are<br />
seeking to hide their weapons. They are trying to pretend they are not controlled<br />
from the areas from which they are controlled and trying to come before the<br />
Australian people in disguise. It is up to us to strip that disguise and 1t is up to us<br />
to go forward so that in the next twenty-one years as much progress can be mnade as<br />
has been made in the last twenty-one. Indeed, more, because the opportunities<br />
are there as the result of the last twenty-one. And I think that Liberal Parties<br />
throughout Australia will see that this is done and I know that if they see that this<br />
is done they will be rendering a signal service to their nation.<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister do you think that a rather over-zealous law and order<br />
campaign along American models could lose more votes than it could gairn, particularly<br />
amongst young people? And if so, what steps would you be thinking of taking in<br />
this direction?<br />
PM I don't know what you mean by " an over-zealous American-tyue campaign<br />
on law and order". I don't therefore know whether that would lose more votes than<br />
it would gain. But as I said in the main body of my address, I believe that the civil<br />
rights of Australians, the majority of Australians, must be protected against<br />
disruption from a minority. And I don't believe that we can or should continue to<br />
allow people to invade Commonwealth Government off ices, to intimidate peorple<br />
working in those offices, to pour ox blood over records in those offices, to esiter<br />
Commonwealth Ministers' rooms and lock them in the rooms and sit around and insult<br />
them. I don't believe we should allow people to enter into such buildings as vie<br />
control such as post offices and interfere with the rights of citizens using those<br />
post offices. These things need to be stopped. Certa inly they need to be sto'; oed<br />
by due process of law. I believe that the penalties that should be applied in these<br />
instances should be such as to prevent people from continuing to do them. w<br />
whether that would lose more votes than it would gain, I couldn't say. I believe 0 0 0 0 ** 8 </p>
<p>8.<br />
that it would gain more votes than it woubi4osebut, more importantly than that, I<br />
believe it to be the right and proper. thing to do and the proper ' way to govern a<br />
country to see that this -was notallo-wed to continue-to happen. Because I thinklthat<br />
all history shows that once a group takes to the streets to try and impose their<br />
will which they can't impose through the sources open to them, then groups which<br />
oppose that group will take to the streets too, to battle them and the streets wil become.<br />
a battleground and this is not the way in which a democracy or a country oughat to be<br />
run when there is a free vote available every so often to elect a government and<br />
to decide these questions, and that's my answer. </p>
