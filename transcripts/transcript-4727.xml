PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 31 MAY 1978<br />
INTERVIEW WITH TELEVISION JOURNALISTS<br />
RAAF BASE FAI RBAI RN<br />
QUESTION: Is there any chance at all of Mr. Withers standing<br />
down while you are away?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, good heavens no.<br />
QUESTION: What's the significance of the broadening of the<br />
Robinson inquiry?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I'll answer that, but I thought you<br />
were going to ask me questions about other events. We were<br />
given legal advice that it should be broadened to make quite<br />
sure that the Commission could bring in findings on matters<br />
that had been put before it. Now, on the basis of evidence<br />
given, they could bring in findings in relation to<br />
Mr. Robinson and the Commissioners but no necessarily in<br />
relation to other persons and so that the matter could be<br />
cleared up fully and completely the attorney.. advised and the<br />
Government accepted the advice, that the terms should be<br />
widened and so they were.<br />
QUESTION: How do you respond to the Opposition's claims that<br />
Senator Withers should be treated the same way as Mr. Robinson<br />
and should stand down for the duration of the Commission?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would say that the circumstances are quite<br />
different and what the Opposition says is obviously utterly<br />
predictable. QUESTION: Sorry quite different in what way sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, look I am not going to pursue these<br />
particular matters, you know I'm going overseas. Mr. Anthony's<br />
here, I've got no doubt the opposition will be asking--the<br />
questions about the matter but the position is quite different<br />
and that is not entertained. I think it would be a wrong<br />
action to take. The inquiry is in progress. The inquiry will<br />
report. The Government will act appropriately when we have the<br />
report.<br />
QUESTION: Are you concerned, just one final point if it is<br />
fair dinkum broadened more people getting involved?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well of course nobody likes a Royal Commission<br />
of this kind but I believe that the Government should and I<br />
believe the Government will be given credit for its openness in<br />
relation to this matter its willingness to have these<br />
matters fully improbed by impartial authority and if all<br />
Governments behaved in that way and in that light, I think that<br />
the public reputation of governments in general would be enhanced<br />
and I believe the Australian people will recognise that. I'd have<br />
thought you wanted to ask me questions about other matters but<br />
if you are not interested about those I will go on board.<br />
