PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
OPENING OF THE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AGENCY<br />
NORTH SYDNEY 3 APRIL 1987<br />
Earlier this week, I tabled in Parliament a report which is<br />
I think unique among all the documents that have come before<br />
the House of Representatives.<br />
The report was titled " Setting the Agenda" and its contents<br />
revealed with great clarity the true concerns and interests<br />
of Australian women as the nation prepares itself for the<br />
1990' s and beyond.<br />
" Setting the Agenda" is based on the expressed opinions of<br />
more than 25,000 Australian women who participated in an<br />
unprecedented process of consultation as part of the<br />
preparation of a National Agenda for Women.<br />
The concerns they expressed in questionnaires, submissions<br />
and meetings throughout the nation covered an enormous range<br />
of issues. These included opportunities in education, the<br />
availability of child care, concerns about health and the<br />
proper valuing of the work done by women in the home.<br />
As I told the Parliament, we will be looking closely at<br />
these expressions of views as we prepare the National Agenda<br />
which will be the foundation for Government policy making as<br />
it affects women up to the year 2000.<br />
one of the central priorities the women raised is of course,<br />
employment. Many women are concerned that their employment<br />
opportunities are limited, that the rewards they receive<br />
from employment are less than those received by male<br />
employees, that work structures do not sufficiently<br />
recognise family responsibilities, and that women are<br />
concentrated in too narrow a range of occupations and<br />
industries.<br />
Today we are celebrating the launching of an office which is<br />
designed to help alleviate those problems and remove some of<br />
the obstacles and prejudices which lie in the path of women<br />
seeking to enhance their participation in the work force.<br />
This Affirmative Action Agency has been established to<br />
implement the Affirmative Action ( Equal Employment<br />
Opportunity for Women) Act. </p>
<p>My Government regards this Act, along with the Sex<br />
Discrimination Act, as among its most important legislative<br />
achievements. It attempts, on the basis of careful<br />
consultation and gradual implementation, to overcome some of<br />
the very deep seated obstacles lying in the way of women who<br />
seek to enhance their employment prospects.<br />
There are two closely related motivations behind this quest<br />
for affirmative action. First, affirmative action makes<br />
good economic sense.<br />
Australia is a small economy which has for many decades<br />
ignored the necessity to diversify our manufacturing base<br />
and to compete on international markets. No country<br />
particularly a country in Australia's current position can<br />
afford to be complacent about the skills and working<br />
patterns of its workforce. No country can afford to<br />
disregard or neglect half its human resources half the<br />
total number of people whose creativity and-dedication and<br />
vigour are needed to improve our economic performance.<br />
if affirmative action can, by its emphasis on promotion and<br />
employment through merit, improve our national productivity<br />
and competitiveness, thRen it deserves our full support.<br />
That is as imoortant to our economy as our other measures to<br />
improve produCtivity, such as encouraging students to<br />
complete their schooling and eliminating, in co-operation<br />
with unions and business, outdated work practices.<br />
The second underlying motivation for our commitment to<br />
affirmative action goes to the heart of what the Labor<br />
Government has sought to achieve for Australian society<br />
after decadeo of conservative neglect.<br />
That is, simply, fairness among the members of our community<br />
and, therefore, equality of opportunity.<br />
Given the serious economic problems we are going through,<br />
particularly the collapse in commodity markets which has<br />
meant a fall in our national income of more than $ 6 billion,<br />
my Government has been faced with the twin tasks not just of<br />
coping with those declining living standards but of doing so<br />
in a fair and compassionate manner.<br />
The achievements we have made in legislating on sex<br />
discrimination and affirmative action demonstrate our<br />
commitment to that goal of fairness and our success in<br />
reaching it.<br />
Let me briefly review some of the concrete aspects of the<br />
operation of the new Act and the new Agency.<br />
Perhaps the over-riding message which has come through from<br />
the pilot program which preceded the Affirmative Action Act,<br />
and from the early work of this Agency, is that equal<br />
employment opportunity and affirmative action are synonymous<br />
with good human resources management. </p>
<p>It makes eminently good business sense to use all available<br />
human resources. management schools throughout Australia<br />
underline the strategic importance of good management of<br />
Australia's human resources.<br />
The legislation and the work of this Agency, will we<br />
believe, substantially improve personnel practice in<br />
Australia, whether the personnel function rests in<br />
specialist areas or with line management.<br />
The Act requires private sector organisations over the next<br />
three years to commence development of affirmative action<br />
programs to eliminate discrimination and promote equality of<br />
opportunity for women employees. Unlike other<br />
anti-discrimination legislation, it does not depend on<br />
complaints brought after discrimination has occurred.<br />
Thus this Agancy is charged under the legislation with a<br />
number of responsibilities, of which the most important is<br />
advising and assisting employers and higher education<br />
institutions to develop and implement their Affirmative<br />
Action programs.<br />
The staff being appointed to the Agency are not only closely<br />
attuned to the needs of women, but also have experience in<br />
the private and higher education sectors. They are thus<br />
well poised to understand many of the difficult issues<br />
facing employers when undertaking structural, attitudinal<br />
and behavioural change.<br />
in particuaar, the agency's director, Valerie Pratt, brings<br />
a wealth of experience to her position, not least from her<br />
work as a consultant for the Affirmative Action pilot<br />
program and as a former manager of personnel and<br />
administration in CSR's Oil and Gas Division.<br />
The success of the new Agency, and its related legislation,<br />
should see real changes taking place in all aspects of<br />
women' s employment.<br />
A successful Agency should mean greater weight will be given<br />
to the views of women employees; progress will be achieved<br />
in dismantling the barriers to women in all categories of<br />
work; there will be a fairer share of the funds spent on<br />
training programs and more equitable practices in<br />
recruitment, selection and promotion; and acceptance that<br />
greater flexibility in work structures is required to<br />
accommodate the child bearing role of women and the parental<br />
responsibilities of both women and men.<br />
While we require companies and institutions to work towards<br />
elimination of discrimination against women in employment,<br />
the Government will also provide ways to assist women to<br />
move towards economic independence and make the most of the<br />
opportunities that will now be opened up by the Affirmative<br />
Action initiative. </p>
<p>The Government is taking action on a number of supportive<br />
measures recommended by the Working Party on Affirmative<br />
Action LegisLation. A conference was held in October last<br />
year to reach agreement on reforming provisions in<br />
legislation and awards which restrict women's employment,<br />
while not jeopardising the safety or health of any worker.<br />
In July last year the Minister assisting me on the Status of<br />
Women, Senator Susan Ryan, presented to the Australian<br />
Education Council an interim National Policy and Plan of<br />
Action for the Education of Girls and Women. This was<br />
subsequently endorsed by all States and Territories, except<br />
of course Queensland.<br />
A further measure recommended by the Working Party on<br />
Affirmative Action legislation is the development of a Girls<br />
into Enginocring Project. Three tertiary institutions<br />
Queensland Institute of Technology, New South Wales<br />
Institute of Technology and Royal Melbourne Institute of<br />
Technology are implementing programs whic * h involve<br />
recruitment and publicity campaigns, and the establishment<br />
of special support arrangements for women entering<br />
engineering. Our commitmuent to the provision of child care also<br />
acknowledges a very real need experienced by women in many<br />
working situations. When we came to office, there were just<br />
46,000 child care places by around June of next year we<br />
will be funding 106,000 of them. we have provided more<br />
child care places than any other Government since<br />
federation. My Government has also taken steps to<br />
facilitate the provision by employers of work related child<br />
care. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The question of the status of women has traditionally<br />
attracted broad bipartisbin support.<br />
Last week in Parliament however, the Opposition parties<br />
voted against the Equal Employment Opportunity Bill and<br />
revealed thereby that their commitment to this key policy<br />
area is faltering.<br />
That vote stands as a stark reminder of the tenacity of<br />
reactionary attitudes in issues of the status of women.<br />
This is all the more reason for me to pay tribute to the<br />
invaluable work of Senator Ryan. Without her energy,<br />
commitment and support, backed by the Office of the Status<br />
of Women in my Department, the affirmative action<br />
initiatives I have outlined today could not have progressed<br />
so rapidly. The launch of the Agency is a fitting tribute<br />
to her endeavours. I am pleased now officially to launch<br />
the Agency. </p>
