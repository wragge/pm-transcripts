FOR PRESS 6 SEPTEMBER 1977<br />
SURVEY BY OFFICE OF YOUTH AFFAIRS<br />
The Government has approved surveys by the Office of Youth Affairs<br />
of two urgent problems affecting young people in Australia.<br />
The Office has been asked to make a submission to the<br />
Committee of Inquiry in Education and Training ( the Williams Inquiry)<br />
taking account of the views of young people, particularly<br />
the views of long term unemployed early school leavers. The<br />
submission will be concentrating on the problem of transition<br />
from school to work and the appropriate roles of schools and<br />
other educational institutions, governments and the community.<br />
As-bdckgrouff-T-16-i-ts' -submission the Office will be seeking<br />
information and attitudes directly from unemployed young people.<br />
The second task is a study of the provision of " crisis accommodation"<br />
for young people.<br />
The Office of Youth Affairs proposes to conduct a survey of State<br />
and voluntary agencies providing temporary, transient or crisis<br />
accommodation. This survey should indicate the demand for youth crisis accommodation<br />
centres and the health and welfare support services they<br />
need. It should also identify any gaps in the existing range<br />
of services provided by the Commonwealth, the States, local<br />
government and voluntary agencies that affect youth crisis<br />
accommodation centres.<br />
I have approached State Premiers to seek the cooperation of<br />
all State Government agencies. </p>
