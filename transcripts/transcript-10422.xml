    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today is the day for Kim Beazley to take a stand against union treachery.</p>
<p>The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union's letter to Asian coal buyers reinforces how out of touch the union movement is with the interests of workers.</p>
<p>The letter to Asian companies, the Australian Stock Exchange and financial markets is a blatant attempt to undermine Australia's coal trade and is a direct threat to the jobs of Hunter Valley workers.</p>
<p>Unless Kim Beazley immediately repudiates the letter to coal buyers in our region, he will stand condemned for robbing the Hunter of jobs and will prove again that he is merely a union puppet.</p>
<p>Australians are as outraged at union attempts to sabotage jobs as they were when Bill Kelty did the same just before the last election.</p>
<p>Mr Beazley didn't repudiate Bill Kelty then. He must now, by telling today's ACTU executive meeting in Sydney to withdraw their letter.</p>
<p>The Australian people know that Labor says one thing but does another across a range of issues.</p>
<p>Kim Beazley's opposition to unfair dismissal exemptions for small business and their current association with the job-destroying tactics of their union partners reinforces their hypocrisy on unemployment.</p>
<p>11 July 1997</p>
