Distin~ uiched Guests, Ladiec and Oentlemen:<br />
In recent wee_-ks we have had the pleasure of welcoming in<br />
this Fvrllamentary dining-rom notabilities from other countries, Heado<br />

the !-Yead of Government of Laos.<br />
This giver, us a very particular pleasure because we have<br />
admired greatly the dogged courage with w,. hich he and ais countrymen<br />
have faced the threats to their Inde-p: endent e,, istence over the years. 1<br />
am very glad, Prime Minister, that you have been n1J e to respond co<br />
readily and co soon to tie -nvitation I extended to you when I haad the<br />
1-Jes ure of visiting your = xuntry last P pril. " hile wie deeply regret tha<br />
it was not possible because of the singular service She-wlas rendering in<br />
relaticn to the Food and Agricultural Crganisation that th Pines, your<br />
gracious wife, was not Cole to accompany you, vwe are delighted that you<br />
did thinI'k fit to bring Princess Moune, wiho adds her Own distinction to<br />
the cratirhering. ve are glad to welcome also the "" ecretary of . State for Social<br />
V.' elfare, Mr. Keo Viphakcne, and other members of your party. And it<br />
Is a verconal pleasure for me to wielcome again your Con, Captain . S1ouvaenlc<br />
P hourna, who you very kI.-ndly made available as my r: ersonal aid when I<br />
was in your country and he now serves in that ca,-; acity with you.<br />
Cur relations with the countries of Asia are growing closer<br />
steadily and indeed one :. Irhtamost say rapidly. I. nd") ecause of this,<br />
we welcome your visit as the c-rlme Minister of one ofi thle free Statee of<br />
izst 1 cia as we also wielcorned the visit only three weeks-ago of the Prime<br />
Minister of Japan. It vwar, my own special privilege to 1) e the first A ustralian<br />
Prime Minister to visit your country and I had the honour of being I thinilk<br />
I may claim to say the first foreign politician to sit in your C. abinet with' you<br />
and your Cabinet collea27uec. 7 use the word rollticlan *. uecause modesty<br />
inhibited me from descri inyseff as a State.-rnan for this purpose. But<br />
wihen 7 come to you, Sir, 7 am--' nder no such restraint either of langua! 7e<br />
or indeed of cause. You, by your own record the record of a man whlo<br />
on six, ce-;: arate occasions has been Frime Minister of 1his country and G&amp;<br />
Prime 1.4inistershir, whic'h has ex--tended over about 14-years.<br />
P nd desrite ell the threats, despite afy~ zession, desnite<br />
actual . nvasion, you have found ft -ossible to si. Itain tine identity of your<br />
cou-ntri' -nd the cur;-ort of yc--7 eorle and that isa tribu?. te to your own<br />
Statesmanship. ' Y; e have rev--ected the way in which in this difficult<br />
situation you have tried to ad:--ere scrupulously to th--e neutrality of Lacs<br />
as irovided in the Geneva 1. greement Of now, and I have h-ad<br />
first Lhand observation ofL tlis., somethinc of the difficulies you and your<br />
peoy-1e ex-perience in settino2 about those urgent tacks of social and econoinic<br />
develov; rnent which you are -o eager to pursue -rn your own country. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
' Ve know in our much more favoured circumstances here in<br />
A ustralia, with the application we have to make to the needs of security<br />
and the requirements of a growing people, how difficult it is to apply ourselves<br />
as we would hope and to the degree we would desire to the tasks of development<br />
of the resources of our country and the enhancement of the social welfare<br />
of the country. But I wonder how many of us realise that such is your problem<br />
with IL CCC of something less than three million people under arms at<br />
this ti-e, and because of the other demands on your limited resources<br />
you are able to apply only about 17 of your Budget to capital construction.<br />
How difficult these problems are for you and for your people. You have,<br />
I hope, our sympathetic understanding of these problems and our admiration<br />
for the manner in which you are facing up to your own difficulties.<br />
You told me when I was with you there earlier in April that<br />
there were some 4C, CC Horth Vietnamese troops on your own soil and<br />
you were speaking not of those who pass down through your territory in<br />
order to infiltrate into Couth Vietnam but those who were there as a regular<br />
hostile force on your cv. n soil. The Fathet Lao, which is the Communist<br />
military force is roughly only of the order of 2C, C nd you told us then<br />
that but for the assistance which was coming from iorth Vietnam you would<br />
be quite capable of coping with this problem and that there was no grass-root<br />
support for the Pathet Lao. Indeed I remember the very picturesque<br />
expression you used that you are able to contend with the Fathet Lao but the<br />
North Vietnamese came in and established their positions and then down came<br />
the Fathet Lao like a flock of crows. This is a cont'ning problem with you,<br />
and we, with all our difficulties, who have never had to contend with an<br />
invader on our own soil, can have little real appreciation of what it means<br />
to a country of your limited size, a country in area only approximately<br />
that of the State of Victoria. Although you have made it clear to us you<br />
have resources which, given , peace, you would be able to develop for the<br />
well-being of your people.<br />
' e share vi'th you a desire for this peace because we too<br />
can do better things with our own country if we can apply our resources in<br />
greater measure to the pur oses of peace. But you are facing this in very<br />
much more difficult circumstances and with very much more limited<br />
oprportunity. VWell, we have tried to help in various ways and modest as<br />
our contribution has necessarily been, we have extended it gladly and in<br />
the hope that it will help your people to develop for themselves a better<br />
way of life. It is with this same object in view that we have for two<br />
years now been engaged in assisting you in various projects, such as the<br />
beef cattle experimental project not far from Vientiane, and we have had<br />
some of your people come here for training. have assisted you to<br />
stabilise the strength of your currency and we are glad to learn real success<br />
has attended our efforts in that direction.<br />
Now, Sir, I shall be joined in prorosing this toast to you by<br />
the Leader of Her Majesty's Crposition in this country and I am sure that<br />
he shares, and his colleagues share, the admiration of all of us for you<br />
and your people. You come to us as a people with ancient cultures, and you<br />
have established a distinctive national entity and identity. I know that<br />
there were many more millions of Laotians formerly forming part of your<br />
country. Now many of them are scattered through vearious other parts as<br />
a result of invasion or ag2ression in the past. Pnd yet, with less than<br />
three million people in this limited area and inhibited from developing your<br />
own natural resources because of the need to keep up your resistance to<br />
aggression, you have never surrendered to a vassalage which might have<br />
enabled you to go alon~ more calmly and peacefully with the development / 3 </p>
<p>of these resources. You have zealously preserved your ovin independent<br />
identity. These are things which we applaud. These are things which<br />
this country has been willing to fight for in two world wars and are fighting<br />
for at this time. V! e see in you and in your enlightened Statesmanship a<br />
ray of hope for the. future in this area of the world. You have been able to<br />
rpreserve your entity, your culture, your independence nd, given the<br />
support of willing friends, not only will you be able to continue this but<br />
you will gladly join as you have evidenced in various institutions in the<br />
region in the co-operative work for peaceful purposes that we believe can<br />
make for a better and more secure life for all people in this region. Co<br />
we welcome you as a symbol of the Asia not only of today but more hopefully<br />
of the I. sia of a brighter tomorrow.<br />
V/ e ask you to carry back to your people the warm good wishes<br />
of the ustralian people and to assure them of cur sympathetic support, and<br />
our ho e that through your difficulties you will retain the identity of your<br />
nation and continue to make your valuable contribution to a peaceful,<br />
procsercus and better world.<br />
Now I ask the Leader of the Opposition if he will join with me<br />
in the toast which I will shortly submit to our distinguished visitor and the<br />
party which accompany him. </p>
