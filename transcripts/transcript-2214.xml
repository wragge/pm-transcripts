WEST AUSTRALIAN CHAMBER OF MANUFACTURE~ S<br />
1970 ANNUAL DINNER<br />
PERTH, W. A. 0 APRIL 1970<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Mr. Chairman, Sir David Brand, Distinguished Guests and Gentlemen:<br />
Thank you very much, Sir, for that introduction, and thank you<br />
for the opportunity that you have afforded me to speak tonight to this<br />
very representative gathering of Western Australians.<br />
I don't think there is any point in my detailing to you that which<br />
you all know so well and that is the great and exciting changeO. that are<br />
taking place in this part of Australia. Let us take that virtually for granted<br />
because indeed I suspect you know more about it than I do, though I think<br />
I know a great deal about it, particularly about the iron ore developments<br />
in this State. Yet, we know this, and your menu tonight in capsuled form<br />
shows that one thousand new factories have been opened here in the last<br />
five years and that alone is an indication of what is happening here and all<br />
throughout the Commonwealth of Australia.<br />
And so what situation do we reach? What economic poosition do<br />
we reach as a result of this surge of development in secondary industry,<br />
in minerals not unfortunately in primary production, though the increase<br />
is there but not the return but what do we find now economically as a<br />
result of this? At this stage we see in Australia that we have reached an employment<br />
situation which we have not known since 1965, the situation where we<br />
have absolutely full employment, in my view, and indeed a situation where,<br />
on the statistics, there are more jobs available than there are people to fill<br />
them, a tight labour situation indeed as I do not have to explain to anybody<br />
in this audience. In the field of home construction ( I am going througi' all those<br />
indicators which show the sort of state that an economy finds itself in)<br />
one of the tightest labour situations since 1965, one of the most obvious<br />
booms in housing construction and other construction that Australia has ever<br />
known. Motor registrations rising year by year to an extent not previously<br />
even expected by the motor industry itself. Consumer spending rising<br />
quite high, hire purchase debts increasing, wages rising by some 9 per cent<br />
or so this year.... all of them indicators that in normal times, and in the<br />
past, one would have expected to lead to be indications that there was a need,<br />
if inflation is to be avoided, for demand to be reduced. ./ 2 </p>
<p>And yet we find, looking at the obverse side of the coin that the<br />
cost of living index this year is rising at the rate of about 3 per cent which<br />
is not unbearable as long as the rise does not continue to accelerate; which<br />
is surprisingly low compared with all the other indicators that I have given.<br />
We find that capital inflow having dropped off in the early part ode the year<br />
is increasing again because of conditions overseas. We find our reservesi<br />
not falling but beginning to rise, and we find our overseas trade balances<br />
showing most healthy balances in our favour. And, norm-ally, in the past the<br />
original indicators that I would have shown would have led people to expect<br />
that overseas trade balances would fall instead of rise, and overseas reserves<br />
would fall, and so there is an economic difference here from anything we have<br />
seen before in our national life.<br />
And because of these differences, and because we are going to have<br />
this year what we aimed for, and that is an internal surplus of at least<br />
$ 500 million, and because there have been some measures talcen to reduce<br />
the demand for money by increasing the price that has to be paid for money,<br />
because of these things, I believe it unlikely that the indicators which one<br />
would have thought would lead to inflation, will in fact lead to such inflation<br />
at least during the balance of this financial year.<br />
At that time, when a new Budget is being looked at, then the<br />
situation must be looked at anew; but it does appear that in spite off that<br />
prosperity, in spite of the housing boom, in spite of the tight employment<br />
situation, that so far we are being enabled to avoid an irilation which must<br />
eventually be avoided. And this is due, to some extent, to the changing<br />
pattern of production inside Australia itself.<br />
We have in the past lived on primary produce, on the sheep's<br />
back during all our formative years as a nation, but last year, I am told,<br />
on the figures, rural produ ction was 51 per cent of earnings, minerals<br />
23 per cent and manufactures 18 per cent of our earnings. And last year,<br />
the mineral exports of Australia, for the first time, brought us in more<br />
than the greasy wool crop of Australia, and within the next few years,<br />
Western Australian iron ore production alone will bring in as much as<br />
our entire wool crop. Western Australian iron ore production alone;<br />
leaving other minerals in other States out, is estimated to bring in as much<br />
as that crop on which in the past we have entirely depended.<br />
This is, I think, a dramatic illustration of the change of Australia's<br />
economic orientation, From this growth so far, from this change in pattern,<br />
enormous opportunities are going to open up throughout Australia, given<br />
a Government which is prepared to be unpopular as we would be prepared<br />
to be unpopular if necessary, by ensuring there is no inflation,. given that<br />
kind of stability, then there will be enormous opportunities. / 3 </p>
<p>I want to examine just some of the things which are involved in<br />
the accelerating growth in the future, which I believe that we can expect.<br />
I want to examine it against the background of overseas investment in<br />
Australian industry, in Australian mining, and of Australian participation<br />
in Australian industry and Australian mining.<br />
Let me at the start set out the Government's positior: n regarding<br />
overseas investment. We believe, indeed we know and I am sure you know,<br />
that it is impossible to generate within Australia the amount of capital that<br />
is going to be required if we are to proceed to develop at the rate which<br />
history demands we should. If we are going to increase our industrial<br />
capacity, if we are go-ing to increase the rate of our extractive mining<br />
industries, if we are going to increase the processing of the minerals,<br />
then we cannot within this country generate the capital which is required.<br />
So we welcome and encourage and want overseas capital in enterprises<br />
in Australia. Let us make that quite clear from the start and from the<br />
beginning. Having said that, I still think that we should bear these things<br />
in mind. Our motor vehicle industry in Australia today, important to our<br />
economy as you would agree, is 90 per cent owned and controlled by<br />
overseas capital. Our chemical industry in Australia today is 75 per cent<br />
owned and controlled by overseas capital. Our electrical and<br />
electronic industry which will play an even more important part in all<br />
branches of industry in the future, is over 50 per cent owned and controlled<br />
by overseas capital, and the alumina and aluminium industry based on<br />
deposits of bauxite which perhaps may be the greatest in the world is<br />
almost 100 per cent owned by overseas capital. Let us bear this in mind,<br />
not in the sense that this is bad in itself, not that this does not bring us<br />
benefits because it does in many ways. You and I are 50 per cent partners<br />
in all these enterprises L icause of the company ta-:.*. hat you and I collect.<br />
Not in any sense saying ., hat this is bad, but recog,:.: sing it and putting it<br />
in our minds as a fact of life.<br />
We hear on all sides people saying most of Australian industry<br />
is owned by Australians and controlled and operated by Australians, x per<br />
cent of factories is so owned. And so it is, but that is not the point. The<br />
point is what is the size of those factories, in what fields of enterprise are<br />
they engaged. And again, for background and to keep in our minds, the factories<br />
with under 50 employees are ' 46 per cent, only 26 per cent owned by<br />
overseas capital. Over 50 employees 34 per cent by overseas capital.<br />
Over 100 employees 37 per cent. Over 500 employees 43 per cent.<br />
So the larger enterprises, the larger the factory, the more likely it is that<br />
there will be this control or this ownership from overseas. And perhaps<br />
in more definite terms and perhaps again to put in our minds what in fact<br />
is the case before we draw inferences from it but just what in1 fact is the<br />
case let me trespass on your patience a little by giving some examples<br />
of actual foreign-owned or majority foreign-owned companies in Australia,<br />
some examples only which I have culled from a much longer list and which<br />
I have sought to distribute over various fields of industry. ./ 4 </p>
<p>We find in this list such household words as GMH, Ford, Chrysler,<br />
ICI, Union Carbide, Heinz, Kelloggs, Frigidaire, Hamersley, CRA, Alcoa,<br />
STC, Philips, Vicars, Caterpillar, Massey Harris, Colgate, Portland Cement<br />
and others which I won't go on with because I merely sought to indicate some<br />
pointers on this list. Now, all that has been good.<br />
All right, as some people do, to attack GMH, for example and<br />
say they have a 100 per cent owned company in Australia and they built up<br />
with the profits they made in Australia, but you must look at the obverse<br />
side of the coin, too, and realise all the smaller factories which have<br />
come into being as a result of GMH-, and which are providing GM/ H with the<br />
spare parts or which are providing them with services of various kinds,<br />
and you must take into account the export drive which GMI-has made I<br />
don't say it is better than Ford or Chrysler but I am using it as an example<br />
which they have made to contribute to the Australian economy.<br />
These are not one-sided things I am trying to put. I am not<br />
trying to say this shouldn't have happened or isn't good f'or us. I just want,<br />
as a preliminary to what I propose to say later, to show that these things<br />
are in fact happening. And they may happen to a greater extent in the<br />
future in this era of opportunity that is opening up.<br />
In the last five years, which we can take as an indication of the<br />
next five years, we had $ 18, 000 million invested in industrial enterprises<br />
of all kinds in Australia. That is $ 18, 000 million from all sources, internal<br />
and external. And of that $ 18, 000 million, one-sixth or 000 million<br />
came from abroad. Ten years ago, investment from abroad was $ 388 million.<br />
One year ago, it had risen to $ 967 million. And in ning, particularly, thereis<br />
this pattern being reproduced. Five years ago, overseas investment was<br />
$ 34 million, It has risen on the last figures 1 say, to $ 244 million, which<br />
has been accompanied by a rise in overseas ownership and control of<br />
minerals. Indeed, the control of production, the Australian co: n. trol of<br />
production in minerals has dropped from 63 per cent in 1963 to 47 per cent<br />
in 1967. And this process probably will continue, given the facts I set out<br />
at the start, that if we are to progress as fast as we must, then we can't<br />
generate inside our own community enough savings and enough f-inds to<br />
allow this to happen.<br />
Now I said that this was not bad. I said that on balance this was<br />
good, and I believe it to be so, but surely there must be a requirement to<br />
see, in this situation, that as much of the new development as is possible,<br />
without turning away overseas capital, without impeding its inf-low, that<br />
as much as is possible remains under Australian ownership. The<br />
Government has taken that view, and we have taken various courses to<br />
try and see that it would happen. 0 0 0 </p>
<p>We have first indicated our views, our desires to overseas<br />
companies and to overseas governments-that there should be an opportunity,<br />
as far as possible, for Australian participation, for Australian ownership,<br />
for Australian management and for Australian control not said that we<br />
would force this, not said this would be a legislative matter, not said that<br />
we would bring in regulations, but said this is what the Goveryrinent would<br />
like to see, and it has had a r ' esult from responsible overseas companies<br />
of stature. The result has been that there has been more offering to<br />
Australians of equity in new developments in this country. If we can't take<br />
them up, that's too bad, but the offerings have been made.<br />
We have brought in a system of guideliie s which manyT of you<br />
gentlemen will know about on the borrowing in Australia of fixed interest<br />
by overseas companies, wherin we have laid down that let us use this as<br />
an example, 20 per cent ot total new funds to be put into industrial<br />
development, 20 per cent only can be borrowed in Australia by an overseas<br />
company; but given an incentive to overseas companies by saying " if<br />
there is more than a certain proportion of Australian owinershib in your<br />
company, then you dan borrow more than that 20 per cent on Australian<br />
markets on fixed interest, and this is a real incentive because the<br />
interest rates here have been so much lower than they have beep. abroad.<br />
And we have indicated that we should restore the benefit of allowiing<br />
convertible notes to be issued by companies, so that those Australians<br />
who have money to invest and who must get a return on that mo-ney in<br />
order to live, will be enabled now to invest it in a company krnowing<br />
that they will get interest on it and knowing also that they will have an<br />
opportunity at the end of a fixed period of years to translate that fixed<br />
interest investment into equity in the company in which they invest. All<br />
of these things were done for the purpooe of giving more opportunity, more<br />
incentive, more chance of the greatest possible Australian ownership<br />
and control of Australian industry.<br />
Now, we propose to take another step, and we propose to take<br />
it for the same reasons. We propose to establish an Industry Development<br />
Corporation of which many of you might have heard. I cannot go into<br />
details of this yet because the detailed bill has not been introduced to<br />
Parliament, but I can discuss some of the questions which this proposal<br />
has raised and I can give the reasons behind this decision and what we<br />
hope this decision will lead to. a 9. / 6 </p>
<p>We believe that there are important areas of Australian industrial<br />
activity in which the potential financial requirements in the developing years<br />
ahead are not completely served now and, as we think, may not be able to be<br />
completely served by existing financial institutions. For exam-ple, in the<br />
mineral field alone, which must in the nature of things take a prominent place<br />
in all questions of Australian ownership, experience shows that in the extraction<br />
and the subsequent processing, particularly t he subsequent processing of basic<br />
material resources, there is overwhelming foreign ownership because of<br />
the enormously high capital required in this field.<br />
And leaving that field, coming into secondary industry generally,<br />
we think that new scientific developments, new technological developments,<br />
new knowledge as the frontiers of knowledge are pushed back, are going to<br />
lead to capital needs which industry has not in this country hitherto known.<br />
We think that in many fields of n-anufacture, Australian enterprise must be<br />
much more massive than is the case in much of Australian industry, if there<br />
are to be economies of scale to enable that industry to compete on a world<br />
market and to compete in Australia with overseas industry wit'a a minimum of<br />
tariff protection. In other words, the industry must grow to be comparable with<br />
a massive world industry if it is ultimately to be able to compete and the<br />
capital requirements of this are going to be most significant.<br />
And we believe that it is desirable in these fields which I have<br />
mentioned to aim at such co mpanies, whether they be new processing plants,<br />
whether they be industrial companies which are going to be developed, to<br />
aim at their development, while still retaining as much Australian ownership<br />
as it is possible for us to have. Now, at present the statistical facts show<br />
that this is not happening, and it is not happening for one of two reasons.<br />
Either there is not a will on the part of industry and owners of<br />
industry to retain ownership in Australian hands, and I discount that because<br />
I believe the will is there, either there is not a will or there is an inadequate<br />
opportunity to obtain the capital required and at the same time retain<br />
Australian ownership. Well, at any rate, statistically, either one of these<br />
factors is operating because more and more of our industry is passing into<br />
foreign control. And we haven't had in the past enough policy on this, and a policy<br />
saying that the primary purpose we must have is to enable not the prevention<br />
of the inflow of overseas capital, but the retention of the maximum Australian<br />
ownership. This has not been a policy and it seems to me that Australia<br />
has lagged behind in the past. / 7 </p>
<p>Sir, it is towards filling this very significant gap in our policy<br />
that the Industry Development Corporation is intended to be established.<br />
I think it clear that the phenomenal pace of industrial development in<br />
Australia over the last ten or twenty years has been facilitated by that<br />
huge inflow of capital which has brought with it technical skills and access<br />
to overseas markets of which I have spoken. And let rile reiterate we<br />
recognise this as a government, and we approve it and we want it to<br />
continue. But there is absolutely nothing connected with the iLdustrial<br />
corporation we propose to establish which will in any way inhibit or<br />
firghten off or prevent the inflow of this capital in this way. Vat it will<br />
do, we hope, is as an Industry Development Corporation, be able to<br />
give assistance to Australian industry, a particular Australian industry<br />
when, and only when that assistance is sought, when and ordly when that<br />
assistance is sought to help such an industry to obtain the capital it<br />
needs from overseas without having to take in an overseas partner in order<br />
to get overseas capital. In this way, we will not stop the inflo. of overseas<br />
capital because the object of the IDC is to borrow overseas itself. We will<br />
hope to make available to an industry in Australia which wants -o develop,<br />
the capital to enable it to develop, if it asks for it, if it is a good business<br />
risk; and retain its full ownership in Australian hands.<br />
I think, Sir, that too many Australian industrial enterprises<br />
which are growing and have grown, have run into limitations in the past<br />
on the ability to raise capital. They have had, in order to obtain capital<br />
to borrow, to break in a partner who can borrow abroad, and resolve<br />
the dilemma of being unable to raise the capita) themselves in Australia<br />
or overseas; to resolve that dilemma, they have taken in as partners a<br />
company which can raise that capital, but which is foreign.<br />
I think that hardly a week passes, Sir, when we don't read of<br />
an important and growing enterprise which for one reason or another has<br />
been taken over by an industrial concern from abroad. Now, again let<br />
me make it clear that takeovers and mergers are not necessarily bad.<br />
They can be good in many cases they are good. They are part of a<br />
normal business scene, maybe part of the process of an industry developing,<br />
growing up, becoming more efficient; or it may be that a joint venture<br />
between Australians and foreign firms may be a desirable step in Australian<br />
industry development and the opening up of overseas markets to an<br />
industry. All these things are true. But it is also true that it is frequently<br />
an unfortunate feature in the pattern of such arrangements that when the<br />
Australian partner can't get his share of the capital requirements, whether<br />
equity or loan, he will at best become the minor partner in the new<br />
enterprise that results. We wish, not to stop the new enterprise, but to<br />
enable the Australian partner to be not a minor but an equal partner in it,<br />
by helping him to borrow abroad through the IDC. / 8 </p>
<p>Sir, that there are great resources of capital overseas willing<br />
for investment in Australia, surely nobody has to prove. It is therefore<br />
either equity or fixed term lendings, and the facts of the capital inflow<br />
into Australia themselves prove that this is so; just as the fact that the<br />
high interest rates required for such capital do not prevent it from<br />
being borrowed by such firms, for examiple, as Hamersley because, on<br />
a business judgement, it is possible to pay that for the capital a-nd still<br />
make a profit. I am sure nobody doubts that these firms that are<br />
borrowing it will do this. The capital is there, but is riot available to<br />
small firms. It is available to Hamersley. It might be available to<br />
BHP, to GRA, to Utah, to Comalco, to some world-wide company of<br />
great stature and great standing, but it is not available to a relatively<br />
small company. An industrial corporation established in Australia can have<br />
the stature and the standing of a great international company and can when<br />
approached by an Australian firm a relatively small firm, act for it.<br />
It will act for it under the control of a board of directors, predominantly<br />
drawn frxom private industry, in due course, to retain all the benefits<br />
which that capital has brought irn the ownership of that industry itself.<br />
This must surely be a proper objective. This. must surely be another<br />
step in retaining as much as we can of our ownership and of our control.<br />
This must be a help to the developmeint of Australian firms, and it must<br />
surely be obvious that it cannot in any way interfere with that continuing<br />
flow of overseas capital to overseas-owned firms % h ich we still want to<br />
continue along with this. This is the last step that the Governmrent has<br />
taken, along with indicating its desires, with its borrowing guidelines,<br />
with its convertible notes, this is aiother step along that path.<br />
And I hope, gentlemen, that it will commend itself to the thinking<br />
of most people. It has been attacked by people who do not understand it,<br />
who have been misled by initial press reports about it. But bear these<br />
major points in mind it can only act when it is asked to act; it cannot<br />
interfere with a company; it will be by law prevented from getting an equity<br />
share in a company which will control that company; it will by law be<br />
required to divest itself of any equity it gets in helping an Australian company,<br />
as soon as it is clear that that equity can be disposed of on the Australian<br />
market to Australian buyers; it will only act when asked; it will mobilise<br />
funds which Australian industries of small or medium stature cannot<br />
mobilise for themselves. And it will do it in a way that the Resources<br />
Development Bank and other institutions cannot do, because the<br />
Australian Resources Development Ban.%, important as it has been, has, in<br />
fact, as an institution owned by the trading banks, been mobillsing / 9 </p>
<p>9.<br />
Australian capital to great effect and to great benefit. Some $ 250 million<br />
or more has been mobilised inside Australia from Australian Lsources, almost<br />
nothing has been borrowed from abroad. And, indeed, it is not altogether<br />
surprising because the Australian Resources Development Bar.-, is a bank<br />
and is subject to banking requirements, and what bankcs pay for deposits<br />
is not comparable with what many industries pay for capital, and indeed<br />
not comparable with what Eurodollar market requires to be paid for its<br />
capital. Further, by the very nature of banking, certain risk enterprises<br />
do not commend themselves very much. But whatever the reasons may be,<br />
the pragmatic fact is that there has not been the borrowing by this great<br />
and effective institution, there has not been the borrowing abroad that we<br />
seek to get now. And this, I think, will get capital to the great goo Of<br />
Australian industry, to the ultimate saving of some interest which would<br />
have to be paid overseas, the ultimate saving of dividends that :-ight<br />
otherwise have to be paid overseas, and yet without in any wiay interfering<br />
with the flow of capital we need as well. We are merely seeking to see<br />
that if it is unnecessary to pay a high price for capital from abroad for<br />
development, then we don't have to pay that price and that is the objective<br />
of the IDG. If it works and if the development expands and accelerates in<br />
the future, as I am sure you all believe it will, then in ten yean,* time,<br />
I think we will be able to look at it, and say this has served Australia as<br />
well as that other institution which was attacked in the same way at its<br />
beginning and I refer to EPIC as well as that other institution, EPIC,<br />
has served Australia, and Australian industries and Australia:--manufactures.<br />
I thought I would take this opportunity of speaking to you and<br />
proposing the toast of secondary industry, to set out, necessarily in a<br />
brief form, the approach which the Government has in these Matters not<br />
a chauvinistic approach but a business-like approach, which we have<br />
taken, and the thinking underlying the next step we propose to take.<br />
I hope, gentlemen, in the years to come at gatherings such as<br />
this, when people rise to talk, it will be no longer necessary to speak,<br />
because events will have proved the success of what we are now setting<br />
out to do for industry, and, as we believe, for Australia. </p>
