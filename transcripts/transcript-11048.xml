<p>E&amp;OE..........</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, good morning.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Hello John.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Why didn't Bob Carr or John Della Bosca or somebody check with the narcotics</p>
<p>   control board and the United Nations before they started on this?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:Well I guess you have to ask them that. What happened</p>
<p>   was that they, or Della Bosca wrote direct to the Board which itself is</p>
<p>   a bit strange. It's normal when State Governments want to deal with an international</p>
<p>   body to go through the Federal Government because international bodies relate</p>
<p>   to the national government not to the state governments. Not surprisingly</p>
<p>   the Board when it responded sent its reply to the Federal Government and</p>
<p>   that is how I got hold of the letter. I didn't know about the correspondence</p>
<p>   prior to that.</p>
<p>   LAWS:</p>
<p>   Is that correct protocol?</p>
<p>   PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>   Well it probably isn't correct protocol. But I am not going to stand on</p>
<p>   ceremony with the New South Wales Government.</p>
<p>   LAWS:</p>
<p>   No, but it would have been easier if it had have been done the correct way.</p>
<p>   PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>   Well, it would have been easier but the substance of the matter is that</p>
<p>   we do have this convention. I don't know at this stage whether what the</p>
<p>   New South Wales Government proposes is directly in contravention of it.</p>
<p>   What I have said to the New South Wales Premier is we have this letter it</p>
<p>   raises concerns it says there may be a breach, please halt the plans for</p>
<p>   the injecting rooms until the Federal Government, and the New South Wales</p>
<p>   Government, and indeed the Victorian and the ACT Governments have had a</p>
<p>   chance of looking at it. Now everyone knows that I am against injecting</p>
<p>   rooms..</p>
<p>   LAWS:</p>
<p>   Yeah.</p>
<p>   PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>   .as I am against heroin trials. But everybody should also know that I have</p>
<p>   accepted that health matters generally are the responsibility of the States.</p>
<p>   And there is no direct federal authority whereby I can stop these activities</p>
<p>   going ahead. And that if State Governments want to go ahead with them well</p>
<p>   they are accountable to their own constituencies, but because of the action</p>
<p>   of the New South Wales Government in writing to this board - Mr Della Bosca</p>
<p>   wrote directly to them - I have now been put on notice that there could</p>
<p>   be a breach and we are going to have a look at it. And I would like the</p>
<p>   New South Wales Government to desist and I would like them to talk to us</p>
<p>   about it and to see if there is any ongoing problem. There may not be, it</p>
<p>   may well be that the Board's interpretation is an exaggerated one and that</p>
<p>   there is no breach. I am not saying there is, I am merely reporting to the</p>
<p>   Premier of New South Wales that the Board has told me in response to a letter</p>
<p>   from his own Minister that it believes there is a breach and that we ought</p>
<p>   to talk about it. Now, that is not an unreasonable approach to adopt and</p>
<p>   I would imagine Mr Carr being a reasonable man will see the commonsense</p>
<p>   in at least talking to us.</p>
<p>   LAWS:</p>
<p>   When you were talking about that Work for the Dole Scheme .</p>
<p>   PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>   Mmm.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>That was in breach of the United Nations Resolution, wasn't it? But</p>
<p>   PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>   Well, no, people alleged it was but we never received to my knowledge any</p>
<p>   advice that it was. People used to argue that it was in breach of some ILO</p>
<p>   convention but I never saw any evidence to that effect. I mean you are dealing</p>
<p>   here with, and I know where you are coming from in asking that question,</p>
<p>   but you are dealing here with a convention on illicit traffic in narcotic</p>
<p>   drugs which deals of course with a whole series of understandings and laws</p>
<p>   that are designed to prevent the trafficking in drugs. Now all I can say</p>
<p>   is that as a result of an approach made by the New South Wales Government</p>
<p>   itself, not through us but directly, the Board has said that it thinks it</p>
<p>   might be in breach. And what I am saying to the New South Wales Government</p>
<p>   is can we have a talk about it to see if that is correct.</p>
<p>   LAWS:</p>
<p>  But, are we able to, it seems to me you've said that you know where I am</p>
<p>   coming from. Where I am coming from is to try and find out area we able</p>
<p>   to ignore United Nations resolutions.PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh well you can ignore it if you choose to.</p>
<p>   LAWS:</p>
<p>   And you did choose to in the Work for the Dole.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No, no well my advice at the time was not to the effect that that was in</p>
<p>   breach. Some people argued that.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Yeah.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  And I don't recall getting any advice that it was actually in breach. That</p>
<p>   was an old view that it was in breach, but .</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  What about Jabiluka? I mean the delegation was pretty critical about the</p>
<p>   decision on Jabiluka.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yeah, it was pretty critical, but once again, our advice was that it was</p>
<p>   perfectly in order.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  I see. So, you can ignore the United Nations' Resolutions if you choose.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, you can ignore any United Nations'. you can ignore your obligations</p>
<p>   under an international treaty if you choose to.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Yeah.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Of course you can.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Because, obviously.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>   Well, can I just finish John the reason why you can ignore them is because</p>
<p>   in the end there is no sanction against you. Other than the sanction of</p>
<p>   being seen as having potentially breached some agreement that you have signed.</p>
<p>   I mean, what is at issue here is whether we might go outside the terms of</p>
<p>   an agreement regarding drug matters that were signed back way back I think</p>
<p>   in 1961. We are not dealing here with something that.we are dealing here</p>
<p>   with the single convention on narcotic drugs signed in 1961. Now, many people</p>
<p>   would see conventions relating to things like drugs in a different light</p>
<p>   than they would see conventions relating to issues such as the environment</p>
<p>   and so forth which are the subject of far more vigorous debate and dispute</p>
<p>   within our community.</p>
<p>   LAWS:</p>
<p>  Yeah, the point I wanted to make though was simply this, and I understand</p>
<p>   exactly where you're coming from because you feel very strongly about the</p>
<p>   drug issue and many people do particularly the people who feel they are</p>
<p>   going to be affected by it in Sydney and Canberra and in other places as</p>
<p>   well. But what is going to be said is that you chose to ignore the United</p>
<p>   Nations in relation to the Work for the Dole thing and that was okay and</p>
<p>   the Jabiluka thing but because the drug thing is close to your heart, you</p>
<p>   choose not to ignore it.</p>
<p>   PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>   Well, people can argue that but I can reply by saying that in relation to</p>
<p>   Jabiluka our advice was not that we were in breach.</p>
<p>   LAWS:</p>
<p>  Yeah, well anyway, that's what could be said. But .</p>
<p>   PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I mean what can be said in reply is that it is not an accurate allegation.</p>
<p>   I mean if it were true that we were in breach, clearly in breach and we</p>
<p>   had advice to that effect then that would be a justifiable juxtaposition</p>
<p>   for you or anybody else to put.</p>
<p>   LAWS:</p>
<p>  Yeah.</p>
<p>   PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  But that is not the case. I mean the advice in relation to that Jabiluka</p>
<p>   issue - and I know exactly what you are saying - was not that we were in</p>
<p>   breach. That was not the advice we had from our people. Now what I have</p>
<p>   said in relation to this is a simple thing. We've got a letter from an international</p>
<p>   body which says there could be a breach. What I have asked to happen is</p>
<p>   that there be a meeting between the Commonwealth and the States for us to</p>
<p>   find out exactly what the state intends to allow to happen and then we can</p>
<p>   get legal advice as to whether there is a breach. If we then have that legal</p>
<p>   advice we then decide if it is to the effect there is a breach whether we</p>
<p>   propose to do anything about it. Now we haven't taken that decision yet</p>
<p>   but I think it would be very odd indeed for the Prime Minister of this country</p>
<p>   to get a letter saying that we are, in the view of the people writing the</p>
<p>   letter, in breach of something that we as a nation have signed with the</p>
<p>   rest of the world community and then do nothing about it. I mean I can't</p>
<p>   do that.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  No no. Well obviously you can't do that. If New South Wales or any other</p>
<p>   States go ahead with the trials that you find offensive, and again let me</p>
<p>   say a lot of people do, would you be prepared to use the external affairs</p>
<p>   power?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Oh look, that's too far down the track. I'm not threatening anything at</p>
<p>   this stage. That's not my game on this. I think it's something that..I'll</p>
<p>   deal with that issue if and when it arises.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  But you do feel very strongly about the drug issue.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I do feel very strongly about injecting rooms and heroin trials, and</p>
<p>   there are a lot of people who agree with me, there are a lot who disagree</p>
<p>   with me. It's a hard issue.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Very difficult issue.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  And I'm not saying that everybody who's in favour of them is coming from</p>
<p>   a wrong position or an impure motive. I respect the fact that it's one of</p>
<p>   those issues that produces strongly divergent views within the community.</p>
<p>   There are people in my own party who disagree with me on this, and there</p>
<p>   are people in the Labor Party who agree with me on this. There are many</p>
<p>   people I know in the Labor Party who are very uneasy and very uncomfortable</p>
<p>   about what the New South Wales Government is doing. I know that for a fact.</p>
<p>   But I have an obligation of conscience to tell the Australian people where</p>
<p>   I stand on social issues.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Absolutely.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  And I took the view four years ago that whenever these difficult issues</p>
<p>   arose I would not hide under the carpet, I would not say well that's a State</p>
<p>   matter don't ask me. I'm always willing to state my view on these issues</p>
<p>   and I accept that a lot of your listeners will disagree with me.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  I think a lot will agree.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  And a lot will agree with me. And all I'm trying to say to the Premier of</p>
<p>   New South Wales on this issue is I'm not pulling out the big stick, but</p>
<p>   there could be a breach. Why don't we talk about it and we can work out</p>
<p>   what the situation is. And I mean, I repeat, this all arose because his</p>
<p>   own minister wrote to the United Nations. I didn't write to them.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  That's true. I know you're pretty close to a decision on digital TV. Can</p>
<p>   you guarantee people won't have to buy expensive new sets to deal with the</p>
<p>   change?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  We are trying to produce an outcome that will stop that happening, yes.</p>
<p>   I think as you know..</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  It's complex.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  It certainly is. You can keep your current set and you can buy one of these</p>
<p>   little decoder boxes and put it on the top, and that will give you through</p>
<p>   your existing set, that will give you access to digital. And if you have</p>
<p>   an approach whereby both the high definition and the standard definition</p>
<p>   signal is carried, than you can have a box that sort of covers both and</p>
<p>   that's not going to put a big hole in your pocket. You should also bear</p>
<p>   in mind that over time the price of new television sets featuring new you</p>
<p>   beaut technologies will obviously come down with increased consumer demand.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Yeah, always does.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  But our aim, you put your finger on the goal we have. The goal is to have</p>
<p>   a policy that suits first and foremost the Australian consumer. We're interested</p>
<p>   in the Australian consumer ahead of anybody else.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Just a couple of other issues if you've got just three more minutes. Is</p>
<p>   gambling out of control in your mind in this country?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I think we have more than enough gambling.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Is there much you can do about it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  There are limited things governments can do about it. They can not endorse</p>
<p>   new gambling facilities. For example I had a proposal put to me a couple</p>
<p>   of years ago that would allow gambling on international airline flights</p>
<p>   in and out of this country, and I said no. And they won't happen while this</p>
<p>   Government is in office. And there are a lot of areas where I think gambling</p>
<p>   has gone much too far. Now once again these are difficult issues. If people</p>
<p>   who can afford to gamble and afford to lose, I don't care. They can do whatever</p>
<p>   they like with their money. That's their business and they can afford it.</p>
<p>   But there are a lot of people who can't. You know that and you know their</p>
<p>   families suffer and they suffer, and businesses they buy from suffer. And</p>
<p>   if we can try and ameliorate that in some way that can be a help.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  I suppose it's difficult in as much as it should be individual responsibility.</p>
<p>   Some people can't accept that individual responsibility. But if you do that</p>
<p>   for gambling I suppose it should be done for alcohol for those who have</p>
<p>   the same penchant to consume excessive amounts of alcohol.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we have in some respects done that. I mean we now, 20 years ago, 25</p>
<p>   years ago we allowed people in affect to drive cars even though they were</p>
<p>   heavily influenced by alcohol. We are much tougher on that now because we</p>
<p>   see that they can do themselves and others a lot of damage. And I've no</p>
<p>   doubt that the major reason why the road toll in this country is half what</p>
<p>   it was 30 years ago..</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  You think that's got a lot to do with it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  It is. We have random breath testing. I mean it's as simple as that. You</p>
<p>   know that 30 years ago many people drove when they shouldn't have. And all</p>
<p>   of us. I mean, you know, none of us are exceptions to it and it's quite</p>
<p>   different now.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Okay, probably the most important question of the lot that I have to ask</p>
<p>   you. I hope it doesn't embarrass you.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  It doesn't.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Should Mark Waugh stay in the Test team?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, I would give Mark, I would certainly want to see Mark have another</p>
<p>   couple of opportunities. Look he's having a very bad trot.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  He sure is.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  But others have done it. I mean Greg Chappell went through a very bad trot</p>
<p>   at one stage in his career.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Mark Taylor too.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Mark Taylor certainly did. Mark Waugh has given an enormous amount to Australian</p>
<p>   cricket. He still remains in my opinion the most graceful batsman to watch..</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Beautiful.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  ..beautiful, of the current era of players. He is having a rough trot and</p>
<p>   of course nobody has a permanent hold on a Test cricket place. But given</p>
<p>   his part service to Australia, it's a matter for selectors of course, I</p>
<p>   would hope that they gave him a go certainly for the remaining two Tests</p>
<p>   of this series. But you know, John,...</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>I'm the same.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  In the end that's a matter for the Australian selectors and whatever decision</p>
<p>   they take, like another cricket follower I will accept.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Yeah, well I do think if a bloke gets the Prime Ministerial stamp of approval</p>
<p>   selectors might have a closer look at him.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No no. We're a very egalitarian country and I wouldn't want the selectors</p>
<p>   to take any notice of me if they had another view. But you asked me..</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Was Tendulkar out?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I didn't see the second one. I saw the first one.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Well I think he got a rough deal in both actually.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yeah I thought he was out in the first one I've got to say. I had a vigorous</p>
<p>   debate with one of my sons who was also watching it at the time. He had</p>
<p>   a different view.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Well I have his view. I think he got a raw deal on both occasions frankly.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I didn't see the second one. I had that described to me. But I was</p>
<p>   busy at a Cabinet meeting I'm afraid.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Even more important than Test cricket. Just could I ask you this, do you</p>
<p>   think that we're sort of overdoing these replay things on television with</p>
<p>   people drawing little pictures on your screen where the ball could have</p>
<p>   gone and.?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well look John, it's very tough on the umpires..</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Very, very.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  .but you know, it's inevitable that we do it. We have this tremendous technology</p>
<p>   and I think the presentation of sport on free-to-air television in Australia</p>
<p>   is probably the best in the world. We have pioneered techniques in sport</p>
<p>   in this country on free-to-air that.all television for that matter but most</p>
<p>   of us watch it free-to-air, which are better than any in the world.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  I agree with that.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  But it is very hard and you have to be a much, you know you have to be really</p>
<p>   on the ball. I remember the rugby league grandfinal when Bill Harrigan gave</p>
<p>   that extraordinary, you know that terrific, that decision which I must say</p>
<p>   when against my own team, went against St George in favour of Melbourne.</p>
<p>   But it was a very courageous decision and..</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  And he was right was he?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  And he was right. And when you saw the replay and you realised what incredible</p>
<p>   skill he had brought to bear in taking that decision, and what extraordinary</p>
<p>   responsibility he took on himself to do it, I have great admiration for</p>
<p>   him. But it puts those blokes under a lot of pressure but it's unavoidable.</p>
<p>   I mean we as consumers love it. I mean you say it's being over done but</p>
<p>   gee we all watch it don't we.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Yeah. I just think I'd rather they had a half hour late at night when they</p>
<p>   went back to all these things in slow motion and different camera shots</p>
<p>   so we could all analyse them then because I really do think it's pretty</p>
<p>   tough on the umpires.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  It is very tough but it's part of the customer service.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Yep. Okay John, I hope you have a very happy Christmas with your family</p>
<p>   and a wonderful new year.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Thank you. And you too John.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  And it was good to talk to you.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  And to all of your listeners.</p>
<p>  LAWS:</p>
<p>  Thank you very much.</p>
