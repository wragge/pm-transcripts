VISIT TO INDONESIA, SINGAPORE AND MAPLAYSIA<br />
By the Prime Minister of Australia, the<br />
Rt. Hon. William McMahon, M. P.<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF SINGAPORE<br />
MR. LEE KUAN YEW<br />
AT STATE DINNER 9 JUNE, 1972.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, Your Excellencies, Gentlemen,<br />
My colleagues and I extend you a warm welcome on this your first<br />
visit to Singapore since you became Prime Minister. You are no<br />
stranger to us, and we recall with pleasure your presence here during<br />
the 1971 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.<br />
In the eighteen months since then, there have been momentous<br />
political changes in the world. President Nixon's visits to Peking<br />
in February, and to Moscow in May, made most countries re-examine<br />
their positions, to assess what changes the future will now have in<br />
store for them. The easy assumptions of cold war politics are no<br />
longer valid. But it does not necessarily follow that there will be<br />
any immediate or precipitate change in the political and security<br />
climate which has so far kept South-East A-Isia, outside of Indo-China,<br />
an area of relative tranquility.<br />
Change there must be. For my own part, I would prefer the dust<br />
stirred up by all these dramatic events to settle, before coming to<br />
firm conclusions on which to base any changes in policies. Certainly<br />
it is not necessary to start changing our friends, though nothing<br />
is lost by making new friends of old adversaries of cold war days.<br />
The recent series of accords between America and Russia reinforces<br />
the trend towards the acceptance by the super powers of their desire<br />
and now their declared policy to avoid confrontation against each<br />
other. They have accepted the division in Europe, since the second<br />
world war, as a fact of life for the foreseeable future. By the<br />
recent series of agreements between the West Garmans and the Russians,<br />
West Germans and the Poles, the agreements in Moscow and Berlin<br />
Four Power Agreement, the Europeans have substantially cut down the<br />
dangers of conflict in Europe itself. ./ 2 </p>
<p>Unfortunately, there have been no such accords over Asia. One<br />
probable result of President Nixon's earlier discussions in Peking<br />
is to lessen the likelihood of a collision between America and<br />
China. There are other major powers with long term interests in Asia<br />
and in the Indian and Pacific Ocean. They were not present at the<br />
Peking discussions. Further, they have not yet reconciled their<br />
different views of the shape of things to come. America, China, Japan<br />
and Russia may take some time to agree what are the limits of their<br />
respective capacities to influence events in the different countries<br />
of Asia. Nor is it clear how much naval power can add to their<br />
economic and political influence on the littoral states of Asia<br />
adjoining the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and on the island nations<br />
lying off the Asian continent..<br />
Meanwhile, the war in Indo-China grinds on. We must hope there<br />
can be a negotiated settlement that will enable American forces to<br />
withdraw and not in disgrace, that the South Vietnam these forces<br />
leave behind can be allowed to sort their future out by themselves<br />
without external interference by forces. If this could happen, then<br />
a confident Thailand will act as a buffer for Malaysia and Singaeore.<br />
Then we can have more time to adjust ourselves to the changing forces<br />
acting on Asia, the Pacif c and Indian Oceans.<br />
Your visit, Mr. Prime Minister, comes at a time when this whole<br />
region is preparing to adjust to the altered situations consequent<br />
upon the dramatic changes in policy of the great powers. It is still<br />
not altogether certain what these changes will be. There is nothing<br />
alarming about uncertainty, provided the future is not placed in<br />
jeopardy by hasty reaction.<br />
Amidst all these uncertainties, it was a source of satisfaction<br />
that we were able to maintain steady co-operation between Australia<br />
and Singapore. They contributed to the climate of confidence which<br />
helped us ride through some difficult times in the last few years.<br />
Such progress as we have made, despite the adverse turn of events in<br />
1965 and 1968 was due, in part, to the quiet understanding and<br />
support of our friends, of which Australia was one. And the defence<br />
arrangements of the Commonwealth Five have provided continuing<br />
stability to an area important to us, the people who live in it,<br />
and perhaps to you, in Australaqia. And there is no reason why we<br />
should not make further progress in regional co-operation, to<br />
consolidate the present stability of the region. With a little luck,<br />
South-East Asia should be able to withstand drastic changes in the<br />
Indo-Chinese situation. In these matters, we have common interests.<br />
And now, Your Excellencies, Gentlemen, I ask you to rise and drink<br />
a toast to the health of Her Majesty The Queen. </p>
