UZN* Z EALAID TOUR 1967<br />
PRESS CONF7RENCE HELD BY MR. HOLT<br />
IAT 7ELLI.. JT ONl 33D FEBRUARY, 1967.<br />
Q. Have you thought of any possiole increases Pew Zealand might<br />
make towards the Australian T-Ask Force?<br />
P. imv. Jell you would hardly expect the two Prime inisters to<br />
come togetAer without some discussion occurrin. in relation to<br />
Vietnam, and I think there was a reference to That in the<br />
communique which has been put out. There have ouen su-restions<br />
I gather that my visit here haLd some connection with That and the<br />
size of ew Zealand forces. I make it quite clear that that was<br />
not included in any of the purposes of m visit, nor would I presume<br />
to 4ay to a Kew Zealand overnment what the level of its contriution<br />
oug1nt to be. It is quite capable of resolving that matter for<br />
itself, but I do say, as I recall it in the com: unique that we<br />
continue our support of Vietnam in its defence against agression and<br />
we actively join in the search for a just and peaceful negotiation<br />
or a just an peaceful settlement arising out of a negotiation.<br />
hat would be your vi3ew if the Few Zealand Tovernment were to<br />
propose that the battalion now with the Commonwealth Strategic<br />
dieserve be re-deployed in Vietnam, and has this been mentioned to<br />
you in official conference?<br />
P. M. I would not comment on that matter. It would raise questions<br />
which would relate not only to * ustralia but to the United Kin dol:,<br />
the level of forces required ir the Rieserve, and this is a matter which<br />
if Mr. Holyoake wished to raise it, would no douut be considered by<br />
the overnment. I make no comment on that.<br />
Q. ' That was actually discussed this morning in Cabinet?<br />
P. 1. I am not to De cross-examined on a Cabinet discusjion. I do<br />
not know what the practice is in this country but in my country Cabinet<br />
discussions are confidential to Cauinet, and I regarded this one as a<br />
confidential discussion subject to hat aoT., ars in the com. munique.<br />
2. How long do you exnect the Vietnam , iar to continue?<br />
I wish I krnew the answer to that one. I could plan with much<br />
more certainty in my own country than is the case. I do not think anyone<br />
can predict the course either of the hostilities or of the prospec<br />
for the negotiations. e are a little more hopeful than we were. I<br />
do not know how justified those hopes are that negotiitions could<br />
emerge, perhaps at no very distant point of time, but I do not claim to<br />
have substantial evidence that this is likely to be so. There have<br />
been su restions in more recent times, appearinr rather more<br />
fre uenTy than before, that this is a possibility, and I imagine<br />
that the events that are occurring irn China would have produced some<br />
review of their situation on the part of quite a number of eople in<br />
various countries. 3ut as to the course of hostilitis, I do oelieve<br />
that the position represents a very suostantial improvement on the<br />
situation which existed 12 months ago. I came back myself last April<br />
saying' I :! as convinced we had reached a point where the Viet Cong<br />
the North Vietnamese could not win this conflict, but at the same<br />
time I predicted that if we were able to meet successfully the more<br />
highly organised attacks more highly or anised in the sense of<br />
proceeding from lare bodies of men th i there would be a disposition<br />
to revert, to Yuerilla tactics, and the fact that guerilla tactics<br />
have substanti lly increased, I think is confirmation of the vier<br />
I held then, and also some substantial evidence that they have not been<br />
farin' well where they have engaged our forces by ours, I mean those<br />
of South Vietnam, the ;' mericans and other friendly forces in the area<br />
they have not been engaging them successfully.<br />
Have there been any serious discussions in Australia on a Pacific </p>
<p>Trading Ijreement involving New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Canada,<br />
and the United States,<br />
F. M. No. It is the sort of thing that sometimes is canvassed in<br />
academic argument or in the sort of speeches thit back-bench Members<br />
make from time to time, but I would not say it has been seriously<br />
entertained by any Jovernment of which I have an awareness. After<br />
all there is no corresponding situation in Asia to that which exists<br />
in Europe. The countries have very different stages of development,<br />
very different stardards of industry and living, and while there is a<br />
great trade developin and the trade between ' ustralia and Japan is<br />
perhaps the most dramatic example I can point to, I wJould expect trade<br />
generally uetween countries such -s our own and yours to increase as<br />
population grows, consumption standards rise, as capacity to consume<br />
increases these all have some beneficial trading effect for us.<br />
i7e have, of course, a bilateral arrangement with Japan which by and<br />
large is working very well. Certainly the trade is increasing very<br />
satisfactorily. Q. You don't see any advantage in the idea at the moment?<br />
P. M. 7ell, I don't regard it as practical politics or Dractical trading<br />
at the present time, because there are significant differences, but that<br />
does not mean there could not be useful bilateral arrangements.<br />
Q. The EEC development su gests that Britain will eventually go into<br />
the EEC and that hiw, Zealand and australia, as far as their own trade<br />
with 3ritain is concerned, might be left outside. Do you think that this<br />
will eventuall perhaps not in our lifetimes lead to economic<br />
and perhaps political federation betweer Australia and lew ealand?<br />
P. H. Y-u use the word'eventually' about entry to the Common iarket.<br />
I don't think there is any early prospect ) f it from what one can<br />
: gather from the exchanges that have taken place, but no one can predict<br />
these things with certainty. as to eventual union of one form or<br />
another between our two countries, the Frime Minister has to look to<br />
the matters within his own likely ran e of ooeration and finds himself<br />
busily enough occunied doing that, an I hav&amp; not detected in either<br />
of our two countries any widespre'. d sentiment in favour of such a<br />
course. I think most thoughtful people realise the practical problems<br />
which arise, out that is not to say that there can't be a strengthening<br />
of unity in objective and in arrangements of a tr ding and security<br />
kind. ' ie already have security partnerships in ANZUS rad SEATO. ' ne<br />
have a trading agreement which has not yet run more than about 12<br />
months and as I said at the lunch tody, it would certainly be our<br />
wish that this should operate to the mutual benefit of both countries.<br />
It is not desired that we should have a one-' ay benefit.<br />
Q. Are you satisfied with the way the Free Trade Agreement is<br />
working at the moment?<br />
P. M. I do not claim to be an authority on the operation of the Free<br />
Trade Agreement. My colleague John Lcien. inister for Trade, is<br />
our specialist and expert on this, and he : ill oe ovor here shortly<br />
and you will be aole to put questions of this sort to him and expect<br />
more detailed and rather more authoritative answers on it. I have<br />
gathered from our end, and indeed from this end, that its value is<br />
accepted. I have found in my dealings with the Premiers of my own<br />
States th-t if we reach agreement on something and one group eels it<br />
is not working out as satisfactorily as both parties imagined it would,<br />
they quickly make that know-n and we make adjustment accordingly.<br />
Q. Mr. i. att suggested that there was some dissatisfaction on this side,<br />
and your reply w: as that this would be only temporary because of drought.<br />
i. ould you sort of<br />
P. F. No I do not want you to read that into it. I think he was making<br />
the point that in the year in which it had been in existence it had<br />
not produced the results that had been hoped for at this end. 7ihile<br />
I do not have the full explanation with me of the factors which may<br />
have influenced trade over the past 12 months, I did point to one of / 3 </p>
<p>the factors which could have affected the buoyancy of trade from<br />
the Australian end. It has not been as lively a year for us as some of<br />
the earlier ones in recent times, Lut we ' tre moving, we think., into<br />
a more buoyant situation at the present time.<br />
Q. Is there any sug estion that hew z" ealand might have to cut its<br />
imports to Australia<br />
P. M. Again, I do not , want to be pre-sed closely as to what were<br />
entirely confidential discussions but I don't, by saying that,<br />
want to convey the impression that the subject was ei her discussed<br />
or thtt was the line of discussion. Don't read that into it. I<br />
think these are matters which more appropriately could be put to<br />
Hol oake.<br />
Q. On the free trade business, I zet the impression that in Australia<br />
they are reluctant to take finisheA products from New 4ealand. That<br />
is, we have already struck trouble with paper pulp and kraft paern<br />
plywood, and so on. Is there any likelihood of that attitude ceaning<br />
up in the future?<br />
P. You mentioned one conspicuous matter and I was told by mcolleague,<br />
r. , Mc2wen, that this was one of the matters he would be<br />
discussing wnhen he came over here. _ ut I have not gained the<br />
impression myself, and frtnkly there has not been a -ood deal of<br />
Cabinet discussion on this since the " oreement came into force but<br />
I have not gained the inmpression mysel that it is working out<br />
unsatisfa. ctorily. ho doubt if that is the vie;; held here it will<br />
be conveyed to him ind he will be reporting back to us, but we have<br />
a bi': country to tAminister. It has " t lot of proolems, and I do not<br />
try To oe a specialist on all of them. I look to my M7inisters to<br />
attend to those matters which fall within their own jurisdiction.<br />
Q. Sir, Do you think there is any possibility or any advanta-e<br />
in the eventual amalgamn. tion of iNew ] e-land and Austr-alian A" rmed<br />
Forces? ' ell, a-ain that raises urobles uoth of a technical kind<br />
matters of n' 1lional identity ifntters of national pride I suppcse,<br />
also and we have found in the past when we have been linked<br />
together nd resisting ag ression or firhting in the cause of<br />
freedom that the forces o our two cournries got alon extremely<br />
w. ell together. After all it us in that spirit that the anzac<br />
tradition became establised. I am sure th: t the Service representatives<br />
would be looking for ways and means to collaborate more effectively<br />
together if they do hapren to be working in the field together. In<br />
Vietnam for example, your artillery element there works in closely<br />
with not only the ;' ustralian Artillery but in support of the , ustr. lian<br />
Infantry. Q. Sir, Australia's military contributions for South East Asia are<br />
much bi g-er and include things like conscripted troops, whereas hew<br />
Zealand is much smaller ind we do not have conscription. Is there a<br />
feeling in Australia that New Zealanders are not aware of the dangers<br />
to this pirt of the world from enemies in South Iast Alsia?<br />
P. M. I do not hear that discussed in Australia. I think most<br />
Australians reco nise th. t just L s we have commitments in other<br />
directions which affect the scale of contributions e can make Few<br />
,, ela. nd his its own commitments and its own uroblems. Currently it<br />
is facing the quite difficult problem of providing -ll the overseis<br />
exchange it needs for its various purposes but, as I said earlier,<br />
I am sure we will feel tha at ! ew 1ealand believes it can d should do,<br />
can be safely left to the Jovernment of the Iew Zealand people. I may<br />
say that sometimes you find th t the degree of support varies according<br />
to geo-raphl I h-. ve , alwayfso und th t the people of Queensland who<br />
were ciosesI to the threat of invasion during the last ur tndlwho<br />
were close, of course to the battle of the Coral Sea., which had the<br />
effect of nreventing the invasion of Australia, appear to be more<br />
defence-minded, more sensitive to threats to their own security, than<br />
0../ 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
some of the southern areas. '. estern Austrilians, too, right at the<br />
extreme side of the Continent, seemed to feel the more remote<br />
because they are separated from us, not by water as you are, out<br />
by a reat Ueal of territory includin 2 ood deal of desert.<br />
They too sometimes feel a little isolte from the defence<br />
stanpoint and press for more defence activity in their area.<br />
lut I would not read too much into those matters. I think the<br />
Nation as a whole revealed in the course of the last election that<br />
it ws giving substantial support to Jovernment policies in this<br />
field. Q. gould you care to co:; ment on some of r. Arthur Calwell's<br />
statements and activities when '' arshal Ky came to Australia?<br />
P. M. I did not think it appropriate to o so in Australia, and<br />
I have not come here to New eiland to say things about him here<br />
I was not disposed to say in my own country. I think Februtry<br />
8th will be a critical day so far s he is concerned, * nd I will<br />
wait until I learn hat his intentions are on that day.<br />
Q. Do you foresoe any move towards or need for the re-armament<br />
of Japan in years to come, or a defence alliance between Australia<br />
or New Zealand and Japan, particularly if the Chinese hostilities<br />
continue? F. YE. ell, you are getting into a field of thinking which would<br />
be beyond my owin cornetence at nresent. This raises issues in<br />
Japan s relations ; ih much larger countri! s than ours, and of course<br />
relates also to its own special situation in th . t area of the world.<br />
I do not feel I can make 1 useful comment about it.<br />
Q. In your talks this morning did you discuss Indonesia? Did you<br />
talk sout the supply of credit from Australia?<br />
F. M. o. ut I don't -ant to get to answers by exhausting other<br />
possibilities. Q. You have had decimal currency for a year now-. . e are going to<br />
change in July. Some neople come nack from trips to Australia and<br />
say you are having all sorts of problems with it. Other people<br />
come vack and say it is as simple as a breeze. Could you give us<br />
some idea for people here?<br />
F. M. As in most st: btements at poles of the extreme, there is something<br />
to be said, I suppose in between in respect of it. Those of us who had a<br />
large part to play with the introduction of decimal currenc and<br />
it was planned n'd carried through durin my own period s Treasurur<br />
in the Commonwealth have been * rtified by the smoothness of the<br />
transition and the absence of difficulties which we had anticipated.<br />
When you become accustomed to a particulhr currency through your<br />
lifetime, it does call for some mental adjustment. Even I find myself<br />
at times converting back into pounds from dollars so th tt I wvill have<br />
a clearer idea of just what it is I am asked to pay for something.<br />
This even occurs on the race course. In the first weeks I had to work<br />
out how much I would normally have put on this horse in pounds, mnd<br />
relate that to dollars. But what you might call the machinery aspects,<br />
I think, have functioned extremely * ell. By mnlchinery I am not<br />
thinking in particulir of the conversion of the machinery with E. S. D.<br />
symbols over to the dollar letterir. ThaLt is going ahead well in<br />
front of schedule. I think it is Wout seven months ahead of schedule<br />
and this has been pleasing. The cost of the conversion worked out<br />
at less than we had originally estim-ted. Thtt, too, was gratifying.<br />
At the moment we are passin' throu--h this more awkward stage :. hich<br />
is unavoidable in a transition of This kind whee you do have some<br />
machines working on one letterin and others w orking on the new<br />
decimal lettering. You do have some of the old coins current together<br />
with the new decimal coins, but I think most people are finding it a<br />
much easier adjustment than they had contenplate and the advantages<br />
of it undoubtedly far outwei h may temporary inconvenience. The<br />
oun er generation of Australia ns and ew Zealanders are -oing to<br />
enefit from this in their education. 1e were finding mentioned </p>
<p>this yesterday to someone here that the larger firms in Australia,<br />
before decimalisation was introduced were conducting their accounts<br />
inside their organisations on the b'sis of decimals and then<br />
converting back into pounds, shillins and pence for any transactions<br />
that went on outside. I think this is pretty good proof that there<br />
was a substantial convenience in accountancy, anyhow, in workinr<br />
on the decimal basis. ,7e will settle down to it much more quicly<br />
than -ie had earlier anticipted, and the fact that not only your<br />
country but the United Kirdom As now decided to go decimalo I<br />
think is further proof th'N it is worth while.<br />
Q. Y'ere there many com plhints in your country from consumers about<br />
prices going up after the change-over?<br />
P. 1. There were a lot of predictions beforehand that traders would<br />
take advantage of this or thit, rices would go up, but if I recollect<br />
correctly and I think I do the movement in our Consumrer Index<br />
wl-s rather smaller after decimalisation, certainly within the last<br />
quarter just under review when decimal currency had been in effect<br />
some time. There are other causes which sear on movements in the<br />
Consumer Index even the actions of uovernments in nutting up fares<br />
and rates and the excise on beer and tobatcco. These things all come<br />
into the Consumer Index. He studied this quite closely in Australia,<br />
lookin at the South frican experience, ind there is no evidence<br />
in South Africa thft costs have risen beyond what might have been<br />
re-arded as the normal order of progression certainly at no higher<br />
ra e than in the period preceding decinalisation.<br />
Q. 7ith the end of Indonesian confrontation and the comparative<br />
stability in South 7est Asi, how long do you foresee a need for the<br />
Commonwealth StrLtegic Reserve?<br />
P. M. I would hone it would continue indefinitely, because I am<br />
quite certain th'it it provides, with the British presence in that<br />
area of the world, a stabilising and moderatinZ influence whose<br />
presence is not resented by the Jovernments of the two cnuntries<br />
most closely associated geogrphically Malaysi or Singapore. I<br />
am sure they welcome the adied securi ty the presence there brings<br />
to them. when the Minister for Defence w. s here in Australia and<br />
presumably your Dean Eyre was over with us 2, t the time there was<br />
some feelinx then tha-i. t the British might in the ne-r future or by<br />
1970 move their troons from that area. . e emphasised how important<br />
we felt it to be that they should remain there, and were very<br />
oratified tha-. t the United Kingdom Toverrment subsequently announced<br />
it proposed to keep them there indefinitely rovidin-that their<br />
presence was accepable to the countries most intimaely concerned.<br />
So I do not see an early movement back of troons in the Strategic<br />
Reserve. In any event we would not be likely to reduce our<br />
establishment. are currently building up the ' ustraian Re ular<br />
Army establishnent to about 40,000 personnel md whether you fiave<br />
them stationed in Australia, or at some noint such as this ;; here<br />
the are tle to deal more quickly with troulle should it emerge, is a<br />
matter of military advice expert technicl advice, I think. There<br />
are political questions which arise also but we look at the complex<br />
of these things to see what ought to be Aone.<br />
Q. Has there been any discus ion of further ustralian credit for<br />
New Zealand following the pounds twelve million loan which we obtained<br />
late last year?<br />
I ell, I have no comment to mrke on thit.<br />
Q. Has it been raised?<br />
Do you imean today, or for th: at matter at any earlier point of<br />
time, no.<br />
Q. Referring in a rather round-about way to military conscription<br />
in Australia, did your Jovernment not wish -t some stige or other<br />
/ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
that it would have oeen simpler to detach troops from the<br />
Commonwealth Strategic Reserve rather than introduce conscription?<br />
en we introduced conscription and perhaps I should remind<br />
you, not that in any ay I wish to avoid the issue, but as a matter<br />
of historical fact, the decision in relation to that matter was taken<br />
before my Jovernment came into existence. I was a supporter of the<br />
decision and a party in the Cabinet to its adoption, but it was not<br />
a decision which wis taken during my own term. We implemented it, and<br />
the decision to introduce national service training and to make use<br />
of national service trainees for overseas service ' as based on the<br />
best military advice we could secure and at the time we would not have<br />
found it racticable to use the Strategic ieserve and serve the<br />
commitments for which they were intended and at the same time have<br />
the numer of troops we wanted available for participation in the<br />
Vietnam conflict. It was to us a necessary decision, and I think the<br />
Australian Electorate has now accepted that fact.<br />
