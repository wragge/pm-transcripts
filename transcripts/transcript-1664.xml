EXTRACT FROM PRIME MINISTER'S LUNCH-TIME<br />
STREET MEETING AT GLADSTONE,( QLD.)<br />
21st September, ,167<br />
Now before I conclude, I will turn quite briefly to those other<br />
aspects I mentioned, because while we do concentrate our attention upon<br />
our own forward progress, at the same time, we cannot ignore the hazards<br />
that we face as a nation or the state of the world around us.<br />
That is why the central issue in the last general election<br />
campaign was the issue of the security of the nation and our attitudes<br />
towards our participation in Vietnam and towards the alliance we have with<br />
the United States of America.<br />
No matter in my lifetime has meant more to the future<br />
security of Austral'a than the negotiation of the ANZUS treaty. That treaty<br />
between Australia, New Zealand and the United States, under which the<br />
security of the other was virtually guaranteed f we came under attack at<br />
any time nothing means more to us today for our security in a country of<br />
this size with so few people than the knowledge that should we be threatened<br />
at any time, the mightiest power in the world is there to come to our defence.<br />
I am glad to say that I found no wavering at any time in the attitude of the<br />
public men of the United States, successive Fresidents, their spokesmen,<br />
and others. Cnly in the last few days, Admiral Johnson, Chief of the<br />
United States Pacific Fleet, who came out for the opening of the North-V. iest<br />
Cape Communications Station where I performed the official ceremony last<br />
Saturday morning, reiterated their determination to remain in this area of<br />
the world to contribute to security.<br />
Ncw our involvement in Vietnam is wrapped up in this as it<br />
is in other things. In the first place, we don't believe in small countries being<br />
attacked by more powerful countries or more : owerful influences. have<br />
gone to war twice in two world wars to resist aggression against small powers.<br />
Secondly, we believe that if Vietnam were to go under, then the security of the<br />
whole of South-East Aeia would come under threat, and finally the security of<br />
Australia itself. Thirdly, as I have just pointed out to you, we believe that<br />
unless we are willing to join with our allies in the time of need of others,<br />
then we can place little reliance on them coming to our aid should we ever<br />
be in that state of need.<br />
It is not so long ago that we were troubled by what was going<br />
on in Indonesia. There are 1CC million people there and they were pursuing<br />
a policy of confrontation against Malaysia and Singapore. Well, matters have<br />
quietened down there, and I hope we shall always be able to live in peace and<br />
co-operation with the people of Indonesia.<br />
But we cannot take any of these things for granted. And as<br />
we build up our own defences, and we have more than doubled expenditure on<br />
them in the last four as we build up the strength of our<br />
services and they have never been at a higher levelof efficiency nor strength<br />
at any period in which we have not been involved in total as we do<br />
these things, so also must we keep our alliance strong. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Now, does anybody in their senses imagine that you can<br />
keep that alliance strong if the policy of the Labor Party on this matter<br />
were ever to be given effect? And the present policy and in substance<br />
it is the same as the policy that the Austral. an people rejected in the last<br />
election the present policy is that unless the Americans accept conditions<br />
which the Labor Party must know to be unacceptable to them, then we will<br />
be pulling our troops out of Vietnam. V. e will be deserting as was the<br />
policy put forward by Mr Calwell at the last election we will be deserting<br />
our allies in a time of military operation. Well, I know the Australian<br />
people would never agree to that. They did not agree to it last November<br />
and I don't believe you are going to agree to that in the vote that you cast<br />
this time. </p>
