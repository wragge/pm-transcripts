SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
AUSTRALIA-MALAYSIA BUSINESS FORUM<br />
TUESDAY 16 JANUARY 1996, KUALA LUMPUR<br />
Thank you for your kind Introduction and thank you for Inviting me to address this forum.<br />
It Is a great pleasure to be here. That Is partly because It Is always a pleasure to be In a<br />
position to tell a story of success, and speak with confidence about the future. It is also a<br />
pleasure because I know I am among people who, by their actions, are writing the story<br />
and shaping the future.<br />
I want to begin by acknowledging your effort and your faith In the future of our two<br />
countries. Your presence here Is a reminder of the strength of the commercial relationship between<br />
Australia and Malaysia. It should also remind us of the wider picture.<br />
Australia and Malaysia are both part of the fastest growing region In the world. That is our<br />
great good fortune.<br />
We are also living in probably the most competitive business environment In the world.<br />
That Is our great challenge.<br />
Yet It is precisely that openness to competition which is so much a key to the dynamic<br />
growth we are seeing in the region.<br />
Malaysia, of course, has risen to this competitive challenge with extraordinary verve and<br />
success. The Malaysian Government has committed Itself to deregulation and exportorientation<br />
as the keys to long-term growth, and has shifted the base of the economy from<br />
resources to manufacturing. The results of these reforms have been remarkable.<br />
The economy has grown at better than 8 per cent per annum over the past seven years.<br />
Manufactured Items now represent over 60 per cent of exports. Exports of goods and<br />
services are now equivalent to around 90 per cent of GDP. And Malaysia Is now one of<br />
the world's top twenty trading nations. </p>
<p>Australia has faced a similar challenge and has undertaken a process of economic<br />
transformation along broadly similar lines.<br />
The Inefficient, inward-looking, highly protected economy which lingered Into the last<br />
decade Is now a closed chapter In our history. We used to rely on our commodities to<br />
support an uninspired industrial structure sheltered behind a wall of protective barriers. We<br />
tried to shut ourselves In and the world out.<br />
But we changed. Radically and fundamentally. Over the last decade we have laid the<br />
foundations of a diverse, dynamic and Internationally competitive economy.<br />
We put in place a program of unilateral tariff reductions which will bring Australian tariffs on<br />
manufacturing down to an average of about 3 per cent by the year 2000.<br />
We let the market set the most important price In the economy the exchange rate.<br />
And we deregulated our financial market.<br />
We opened the economy to the world.<br />
The results speak for themselves.<br />
Our economy is mruch more sophisticated and diverse. Our reliance on exports from our<br />
traditional mining and pastoral industries has been balanced by dramatic growth In<br />
manufacturing exports and services: manufacturing and services share of total exports<br />
has risen from less than a third of the total to almost a half.<br />
Manufacturing exports have grown at a trend rate of 15 per cent per annumn at almost<br />
two-thirds of these are Elaborately Transformed Manufactures. Exports of ETMs have<br />
grown by over 17 per cent per annum over the past decade and noi ' account for almost<br />
one quarter of our total merchandise exports. In 1983, only 3 out of the top 50 Australian<br />
export commodities were ETIVe: in 1994 17 were.<br />
If current growth continues services and manufactures will, by the year 2000, constitute<br />
almost half our total exports to Asia.<br />
We exposed Australia to the global competition and Australia has responded. We are<br />
per cent more competitive than we were a decade ago and this is reflected In a dose in our<br />
trade to GDP ratio from 14 to over 21 per cent. Our exports have risen by one third In the<br />
last five years.<br />
Labour market and microeconomic reform is building a more competitive domestic<br />
environment and bringing Australian Industries up to world best practice. </p>
<p>The Australian economy Is now on a path of robust and sustainable growth. The economy<br />
grew by a strong 4.8 per cent In 1994-95, and is expected to grow at 3 and a quarter per<br />
cent in 1995-98.<br />
This process of Intern ational islng our economy Is very much Integrated with our foreign<br />
policy focus on engaging the Asia-Pacific as the region where our future lies.<br />
Forty per cent of our Imports now come from Asia and we direct 80 per cent of our exports<br />
there. Our merchandise exports to East Asia grew by more than seven per cent last year<br />
and are now worth $ 41 billion. More than one million Australian jobs have been created by<br />
these exports.<br />
By the end of this year all of our top ten export markets should be in the Asia-Pacific<br />
region.<br />
And, if Asia is Increasingly Important to Australia, Australia is increasingly Important to<br />
Asia. We provide almost half of East Asia's coal, iron ore and beef, and well over half Its<br />
wool and aluminum ore. And our exports of manufactured goods, Including ETMs, and<br />
services are growing as a proportion of our exports to Asia. We are also a growing market<br />
for Asia: our imports from Asia nearly tripled In the decade to 1994.<br />
Our support for APEC flows naturally from this process of rapid Integration of the<br />
Australian economy with the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
But APEC Isn't just a perfect fit for Australia. All APEC members will benefit from APEC's<br />
liberalisation and facilitation agenda. Australian modelling shows that the Income of APEC<br />
members will, once all the effects have flowed through, Increase by 3.8 per cent or around<br />
SUSi trillion more than the current size of the Australian and Korean economies<br />
combined. As I am sure you are all aware, Australia has been avid In the pursuit of APEC and<br />
delighted by its. extraordinarily rapid development.<br />
And APEC Is delivering real benefits for business around the region.<br />
Differing standards discourage trade and can add up to 10 per cent to exporters' costs<br />
when they enter a market for the first time. APEC members have agreed on greater<br />
harrmonisation of members' standards with international standards and mutual recognition<br />
of testing and certification. Even a modest liberalisation of trade restricting standards In<br />
the region is estimated to Increase regional trade by 20 per cent.<br />
At Osaka we also agreed on an ambitious program, to be Implemented by 2000, to<br />
harmonise and simplify customs procedures on an APEC-wide basis. And within the next<br />
years the requirement for paper-work for key trade and transport documentation is to be<br />
eliminated entirely. </p>
<p>These are just some of the steps APEC Is taking to address the challenges Australia,<br />
Malaysia and other members of the region need to meet to ensure growth continues In the<br />
Asia Pacific.<br />
In many ways the trade and Investment relationship between Australia and Malaysia Is a<br />
model of the sort of spectacular economic integration we are witnessing across the reglon.<br />
The commercial ties between Australia and Malaysia are both diverse and substantial.<br />
Merchandise trade was $ 3.5 billion In 1994-95. Services trade Is over $ 1 billion. And we<br />
each have several billion dollars invested In the other's country.<br />
These links are growing.<br />
Merchandise trade jumped by 22 per cent In the last year, and the rate of Increase has<br />
been around that figure for the past three years.<br />
Services trade is growing at 17 per cent.<br />
Malaysian investment in Australia Is growing strongly and showing welcome signs of<br />
diversification. The strength of our economic relationship Is, of course, underpinned by the performance of<br />
the Australian sn4 Malaysian economies.<br />
Apart from Its size and diversity, our commercial relationship is marked by the similar<br />
weight It has for both countries.<br />
Malaysia Is Australia's eleventh largest trading partner as Australia Is Malaysia's eleventh.<br />
This year Maiaysia should overtake Britain to rank as one of our ten. la'rgest export<br />
markets. And. Australia Is Malaysia's twelfth largest export market.<br />
Our investment Is also very much a two-way flow.<br />
The growth of our economic relationship reflects the profound changes which have taken<br />
place in both countries over the past decade.<br />
The fact that ETMs now make up over a quarter of our exports to Malaysia up from just<br />
13 per cent ten years ago reflects Australia's increasing competitiveness In<br />
manufacturing. These days we are exporting components for the Proton car, rail carriages<br />
for new urban transport systems, electricity transformers, harbour cranes, computer<br />
software for Bank Negara and medical equipment such as the bionic ear and these are<br />
only a few examples. </p>
<p>At the same time the pattern of Malaysia's exports to Australia reflects Malaysia's rapid<br />
ascent of the technology ladder for example, these days Malaysia sells computers to<br />
Australia, $ 80 million worth last year and this from a minimal base Just five years ago.<br />
From this base of diversity, growth, mutuality and adaptability, the commercial relationship<br />
will go from strength to strength.<br />
But in this competitive international environment, we must work hard on our relationship to<br />
Identify new opportunities for cooperation and capitalise on emerging complementarities<br />
between our economies. I am sure you will know better than me which areas are the most<br />
promising. Nevertheless let me make a few broad suggestions.<br />
We expect tourism to become an increasingly important part of our services trade. About<br />
100,000 short-term Malaysian visitors came to Australia last year. By the year 2000, we<br />
expect the figure to reach 250,000. About 100,000 Australians visit Malaysia as tourists<br />
each year and there is every reason to believe that the number might increase just as<br />
dramatically. There are more than economic benefits in this exchange: tourism maintains our invaluable<br />
tradition of close people-to-people contacts, it keeps our mutual understanding<br />
contemporary and fresh, it spreads awareness and cultural understanding at the same<br />
time as it fertilises the ground for other commerce.<br />
The recent agreerent to expand air services between Australia and Malaysia will help<br />
expand the tourism trade, and our commercial relationship overall. Capacity for each side<br />
will increase by 90 per cent by April 1998. This will allow MAS more direct flights to<br />
Brisbane, Adelaide, Cairns, Darwin and Perth, and a dedicated freight service. We are<br />
pleased that MAS has immediately announced increased flights to Perth and Brisbane.<br />
Malaysia's hosting of the 1998 Commonwealth Games and Australia's hosting of the 2000<br />
Olympics will provide a particular focus for the bilateral tourist relatioship. And both<br />
countries can expect to benefit from the increased flow of visitors to the region. For<br />
example, the Commonwealth Games offers Malaysia an opportunity to promote itself as a<br />
stop-over for visitors to the 2000 Olympics.<br />
Each country needs to be alert to the media opportunities for promoting our countries that<br />
both events present. And we should be thinking now about attracting future uses of the<br />
world class sports facilities we are developing in Malaysia and Australia.<br />
Education a mainstay of the services trade between our countries, and the principal<br />
source of the people-to-people links between us also has great promise. Australia has<br />
provided education to over 120,000 Malaysians: now in an era when the development of<br />
our human resources is more critical than it has ever been before, we are developing with<br />
Malaysia more flexible and sophisticated arrangements. </p>
<p>In future Malaysian students will Increasingly be able to share their tertiary degrees<br />
between the two countries. We are also enthusiastic about the opportunities presented by<br />
Malaysia's decision to allow foreign campuses to open here. And we are confident that we<br />
can provide the high-quality, tailored tertiary courses which Malaysia wants under this<br />
scheme. Skills training is another area where we can see new synergies in education cooperation.<br />
Australia has recognised the importance of skills-based training, and has made historic<br />
improvements to its training system particularly through the establishment of a National<br />
Training Authority. As Malaysia's demand for a highly skilled labour force grows In tandem<br />
with the sophistication of the economy, Australia can share its experience in providing<br />
quality and cost-effective assistance in human resource development.<br />
As Malaysia expands its private hospital facilities and upgrades the quality of health care,<br />
Australia can offer the benefits of experience in health service planning, design and<br />
construction of hospitals, hospital management, clinical services and pharmaceuticals.<br />
I know the process has begun, with Malaysia making use of Australian services to plan,<br />
build and run medical facilities; and planners like Health Solutions, architects like Thomson<br />
Adsett and Woods Bagot, and IT companies like Working Systems all finding opportunities<br />
to deploy their expertise.<br />
Australia has an IT and telecommunications industry worth $ 40 billion and It is growing<br />
rapidly. On a percapita basis only the United States has more computers and processing<br />
power. We are decidedly competitive in IT&amp; T and this has been recognised, I am pleased<br />
to say, by Malaysian companies like MMC and Mesiniaga [ MESSING-NIAGA].<br />
Commercial cooperation in these high-technology industries has the added advantage of<br />
providing a skills and technology transfer for Malaysia. For example, an Australian<br />
company, Techcom, has supplied 30 staff to one of Malaysia's new telecommunication<br />
carriers to help them develop marketing and customer service functipns.<br />
Proof of the complementarity between advanced Australian technology and the<br />
development of Malaysia's infrastructural base can also be found In the STAR light rail<br />
transit system. This high-profile project is designed to meet the challenge of commuter<br />
management in the booming environment of modern Kuala Lumpur.<br />
An Australian company, Evans Deakin Industries Limited, has won the contract for the<br />
design and manufacture of the 90 carriages which will run on STAR System 1; and another<br />
company with a substantial Australian connection, John Holland Asia, is building the tracks<br />
for the project.<br />
As Malaysia continues to privatise and build up its infrastructure Including the new<br />
international airport and the facilities for the 1998 Commonwealth Games great<br />
opportunities will present themselves to Australian firms. </p>
<p>And I am sure Australian firms will grasp them. There is a very long list of recent success<br />
stories. There is a very long list of recent success stories, including major investments by BHP,<br />
CSR, and Boral in. the building materials sector, a major joint venture by Wilson<br />
Transformers for the manufacture of transformers in the State of Negri Sembilan,<br />
investment by Davids Holdings in substantial warehousing facilities in Shah Alam,<br />
contracts won by Transfield in Sarawak for electricity transmission lines and for a harbour<br />
project, commitments by Village Roadshow to the development of cinema complexes, a<br />
major contract won by the Australian operation of the ABB Engineering and Construction<br />
group, for the rail electrification project, a major water management project won by John<br />
Holland in East Malaysia and a significant investment by Westfield in the retail shopping<br />
complex in the Kuala Lumpur City Centre project, the twin towers of which loom over us<br />
today. Just as satisfying is the evidence that the institutional base of the commercial relationship<br />
is keeping pace with the development of the business links. The Malaysia-Australia<br />
Business Council and the Australia-Malaysia Business Council are both playing important<br />
creative and supporting roles and I want to formally acknowledge their contribution.<br />
Today I am pleased to be able to announce that the Australian and Malaysian<br />
governments have decided to take another step to ensure that these opportunities do not<br />
pass us by. Our joint trade commission will be made a ministerial level trade commission,<br />
which will mean that ministers are directly engaged with the private sectors of both<br />
countries in identifying and pursuing opportunities for further cooperation. It is planned<br />
that the first meeting of this group will take place when Minister Rafidah leads an<br />
Investment mission to Australia in May this year.<br />
When profound change is occurring when we talk about the achievement of APEC and<br />
the potential of it, or the relationship between Australia and Malaysia and the future of it<br />
unless you are actually Involved, consciousness tends to lag behind reality.<br />
You are here in pursuit of the commercial oppoitunities. Yet there is a sense in which you<br />
are doing more than that. You are pushing into a new age call It the Asian century, or the<br />
Pacific century, or simply the 21st century whatever you call it, It is without precedent or<br />
parallel.<br />
And so unmistakeable are the signs of success, scepticism barely has a chance. There is<br />
no time for cynicism or indifference to set In. The tide has turned quickly and irreversibly,<br />
the world is understanding the magnitude and meaning of what is happening in countries<br />
like Malaysia. Very rapidly it is leaving the realm of the remote and the abstract: it is not<br />
mere words, but fact manifest fact,<br />
And for making it fact you and people like you must take a lot of the credit. </p>
<p>Australians and Malaysians alike, I thank you for coming today, and I wish you every<br />
success. And let me also thank those in the Asian Strategy and Leadership Institute and the<br />
Malaysia-Australia Business Council for organising this business forum. It Is yet again an<br />
example of the initiative displayed by the business communities involved in the relationship<br />
between Australia and Malaysia. </p>
