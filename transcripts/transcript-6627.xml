INTERVIEW WITH ALAN JONES, RADIO 2UE 24 APRIL 1985<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JONES: I have on the line with me, from Canberra, the Prime Minister of<br />
Australia, Mr. Bob Nawke. Good Morning Prime* Minister.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good Morning Alan.<br />
JONES: Prime Minister is the. f all in the dollar a reflection of the fact<br />
that for years now we've overvalued ourselveq?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it's a. reflection of a number of things, and without attempting<br />
to weight all those factors Alan, the large and increasingly obvious<br />
deficit in* our: current account has played its part in the<br />
assessment that's mfade by others. We were, I believe, overvalued<br />
at the time of the float and It was natural enough that the dollar<br />
would come down. I've said that this was to be welcomed and It was,<br />
on balance, very much a cost to the Austr * alian economy but it did<br />
go too far, and that's in part the reason why in recent days I and<br />
Paul Keating have been aggressively making clear that the central<br />
directions of Australian economic policy remain unchanged and are<br />
firmly in our hands. The value to Australia of the devaluation<br />
should be mentioned. , I mean I'm not arguing with what you've been<br />
saying but I think, with respect to you Alan, it was rather<br />
one-sided in the sense that on balance, as I say, Australia will<br />
be better off because of the devaluation. It means that we're<br />
better off in two substantial ways:. firstly, as you partly<br />
indicated, our exporters, our farmers'and our mineral producers<br />
are better off and that is good for us good for them and good<br />
for us. And secondly, it means that our manufacturing industry<br />
will be more competitive, significantly more competitive, and my<br />
friends in the business community in manufacturing industry have<br />
told me that already they are getting orders now which they would<br />
not have expected before and that comes from senior people in<br />
manufacturing industry. So for those two reasons we are better off<br />
as a result of the devaluation and now as we are recovering<br />
we've bottomed, i believe. That will mean that we will still have<br />
a net devaluation but it will mean that the value of our dollar is<br />
getting more towards the right level one which will properly<br />
reflect our position and which will certainly have those beneficial<br />
effects that I talked about. We have the responsibility, if I<br />
could make this final comnunt; we have the responsibility as<br />
government of ensuring ' now that those very significantly beneficial<br />
effects of the dievaluation are not dissipated through the beginning<br />
of a new inflationary spiral. I want to give you and your listeners<br />
and the Australian public a reassurance that the government will<br />
enptirp thnt thin rieto^ irnt hannen. </p>
<p>JONES' Wel. l Prime Minister that's I didn't mean to underestimate the 2.<br />
impact of the devaluation and the slide, so to speak, of the<br />
devaluation and the slide in the dollar and I think those points<br />
are well taken. I'm just wondering though to what extent, to<br />
repeat I suppose the general thesis of what I'm saying, there is<br />
a perception overseas and recently when Nakasone was here there<br />
were problems about coal exports not getting where they should be<br />
going and there's a problem in Queensland now. I must say that I<br />
am sure all Australians would have viewed with some concern the<br />
behaviour of the Crawfords of this world in Victoria at the<br />
weekend which constituted nothing more than a personal attack on<br />
you.<br />
If I could just say that you came to the position of<br />
Prime Ministership with a very strong reputation as a tough leader.<br />
You were very popular at the time you were elected and still are<br />
popular. There may well beaa. t ime mightn't there in the<br />
immediate future-when you're-going to have to take some of these<br />
people on in the way you did when you headed the union movement?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Ku Well just let me go to the general point you made first about<br />
unions and then to the more particular points, Alan. You refer<br />
to the difficulties that have existed at certain points in the<br />
industrial relations field recently, I think again-you must put<br />
this in its general pdrispective. We had the figures for<br />
industrial disputes out for January and what we've got now under<br />
this government is the'lowest level of industrial disputes in<br />
Australia for. 17 years. Now that'. s not a fIgment of my<br />
imagination.-' That's the cold statistics of the Australian<br />
Statistician. The best industrial relat ions situation for 17<br />
years, and that's the aggregate position which the Australian<br />
business community is recognising and welcoming. They are saying,<br />
and they are' saying it not only here but they are saying it<br />
overseas, that they are Baying to potential investors and traders<br />
with Australia " Look the Industrial relations situationi in<br />
Australia has very significantly improved". It has. Now I don't<br />
meaui from that, Alan, that we should become complacent we should<br />
not. And where a dispute arises which should not arise then you<br />
will find that we've been tough about it. For instance, the most<br />
Sdirect area that I can ' deal with'is in the area of our-own<br />
employment the Commonwealth Employees. Now earlier this year<br />
they tried to take us on. They thought tbat by going on strike<br />
they could force an eight per cent wage increase out of us, or<br />
something of that order. We said,* " It's not on". And we wore<br />
that, we would not cop it and now it's gone back into Arbitration.<br />
Now that's the general point I'd make. Coming to the particular,<br />
you referred to the Crawfords * of this world well I believe that<br />
the public will make its judgement. I have fought now over the<br />
last two years hard, and-at certain times almost singlehandedly,<br />
but then with increasing support, to have established within<br />
Victoria the correct principle. That is, any union is entitled to<br />
be affiliated to the Labor Party if it'wishes to be and the fact<br />
that some people don't like the right wing leaning nature of that<br />
union is not a bar. Now I've had to fight a long fight on that.<br />
We've won. In the process If Mr. Crawford wants to behave in<br />
the disgraceful manner that he did then I believe that it will be<br />
something which works to the disadvahtage of him and those around<br />
him and to the advantage of those of us within the Labor Party who<br />
are committed to having a Party which reflects the nature and the<br />
aspirations of that great constituency out there in Australia<br />
which votes for us. </p>
<p>JONES: Yes well I don't think I agree with you, and I think that some<br />
people mnight think that the Prime-Ministership has made you a bit<br />
too courteous to these people.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh I don't think they'd say that, and I can assure you that I have<br />
been quite clear about it, and I repeat on your program Alan, that<br />
the Labor Party is not going to change back to accommodate the<br />
wishes of those extreme left wing elements. We are not going to<br />
change to accommodate them. If they don't like the sort of party<br />
the Labor Party is becoming, that is, a party more attuned to the<br />
people who vote for us, then they will have to make their decision<br />
to go elsewhere.<br />
JONES: Well said Prime Minister, and I'm a ure that's most welcome. Can we<br />
just go to the question of expenditure because this is'something<br />
that you have talked about now for some time and if you don't mind<br />
my saying the-perception is that on the very important questions<br />
as I say there on tertiary fees where you would have had a<br />
significant opportunity to reduce the size of the deficit, those<br />
of your persuasion were beaten. How successful do you think you<br />
can be with this program to reduce expenditure which you've often<br />
said is absolutely essential to proper economic management?<br />
PRIME MLINISTER!<br />
Well let we put it, that the proof of the pudding-is in the eating<br />
that. we've undertaken already. In the period since we have been<br />
in office,. Alan, we've significantly reduced the deficit we<br />
inherited and I ' ye given the undertaking that when we present<br />
the Budget in August of this year there will be a further<br />
significant continuation of that process. I've been amused, as I<br />
think perhaps you have been too and I think I can say that knowing<br />
your background which I respect, I think you probably were a little<br />
bit amused by the goings on in our Parliament yesterday when our<br />
Opposition were trying this ridiculous exercise of saying that<br />
Mr. Hawke's billion dollar cuts weren't real. I just want to make<br />
the observation that I assume tbat when the expenditure cuts of<br />
a billion dollars are announced in May that I'll have John Howard,<br />
my friend John Howard, getting up and telling all the people that<br />
are screaming and carrying on and saying we shouldn't have done it<br />
" Oh look don't worry, it's cosmetic. It's not real. It's just<br />
Mr. Hawkq making it up".<br />
JONES:. ( Laughs) Yes, I appreciate your point. Well they are the problems<br />
of Prime Ministership though aren't they?<br />
PRIME MINISTERt:<br />
I admit I appreciate that they have got to try and do something<br />
but I didn't think that was very effective. </p>
<p>JONES: No, well it is to be hoped that well we haven't seen them that<br />
they aren't cosmetic because-that's the big issue. And the other<br />
one of course taxation PM.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Alan I can assure you they are not cosmetic. I've gone through<br />
agonising hours in the Cabinet room with the Expenditure Review<br />
Committee and the Ministers and others involved can assure you that<br />
they are real.<br />
JONES: Good, well now with that PM, t he question of taxation and again<br />
I know you've talked about the summit and all that sort of<br />
business but independently of-what that might produce it seemed to<br />
me that there were two at least two-pronged attacks there. One<br />
was that we must reduce personal tax. Two; that we've got to<br />
supplement what we've lost there with an indirect tax of some sort.<br />
Those seem to be two simple premises. Are you still winning that<br />
argument?<br />
PRUME MINISTER:<br />
Well let me-put it exactly as it is, Alan.. I've made it clear<br />
this is Paul Keating and a number of other people that we<br />
believe that-the existing tax system has become debased,<br />
i nadequate, inequitable, economically inefficient and certainly<br />
far from simple, andtbere is for all tbose reasons a desirability<br />
to reform the income tax scales in a way which is possible will<br />
reduce significantly the burden of direct personal income tax.<br />
Now those things are true and if you are going to be able to do<br />
that and maintain broadly the same levels of expenditure that the<br />
people want in tbe areas of defence, education, social welfare.,<br />
roads,-etc, then you have to roughly get the same sort of revenue<br />
from elsewhere. Now I've -made it quite clear that ideally, and<br />
certainly Paul has, that ideally that is what one wants to do and<br />
I can assure you that is one of the packages that we'll be putting<br />
to the summit in our white paper. That sort of scenario will be<br />
there. What we've got to be sure of, Alan 0 s that if we can get<br />
down that path, that you've got to be sure that in net terms you're<br />
not going to be making people worse off by an increased burden of<br />
Indirect tax which more than-comipenisates and leaves people worse<br />
of f. You've got to be sure that you don't produce that result.<br />
You've also got to be sure that you can protect those in the<br />
community who would be worse of f without compensating mechanisms.<br />
For instance, low income people dependent on social welfare<br />
Payments who are not in the area of getting benefits by way of<br />
Personal income tax-cuts would~ if you just left them there with<br />
a rising price coming from an increased Indirect tax, they would<br />
be worse off.<br />
JONES: Quite. * But you've given those assurances that the people at the<br />
bottom will be looked after.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well all I'm saying Alan, and I know that you understand that,<br />
but you have got to make sure that all the elements in the<br />
community who would otherwise be hurt by the change would have to<br />
be protected. So I'm simply saying to you that the proposition<br />
which you put is correct. That's the approach which we believe<br />
is the proper and desirable one. We've got to make sure'that the<br />
mechanisms are fully available to ensure that those who you and<br />
I think all reasonable people would want to see protected are<br />
capable of protection. </p>
<p>JONES: Prime Minister, finally, the difficulty of government has never<br />
been better reflected in the last 24 hours than what I argued on<br />
this program yesterday was an eminently responsible decision<br />
about parity pricing has been lampooned from one end of the country<br />
to the other. * You a * re going to have to, obviously in implementing<br />
decisions, face some of this flak. What's your own personal views<br />
of that problem?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I've never been frightened of facing flak. I think you'll<br />
recognise, Alan, over the years that I've been prepared to cop<br />
flak in a whole range of situations. I've never walked away from<br />
it and I never will.. If I . think&gt; the principle is right that's<br />
where we'll go. Let me say, in regard to this decision on<br />
petrol pricing these things: firstly, it is a well-founded<br />
bipartisan policy and I pay: credit for the Opposition for them<br />
not trying on this issue to run away from it. They said they<br />
support the position. Now it is supported across the political<br />
spectrum because it reflects a sensible economic reality. That is,<br />
( Liwne . airnee xdheaaulsitnigb lew itqhu atnhtei tipersi, c inwgh icofh wae cosmtmioldl ithya vew hitcoh imipso rnto, t ahnedre<br />
so import parity pricing is a relevant and economically sensible<br />
policy. Secondly, that even with these changes'Australia still<br />
enjoys just about the lowest price for petrol anywhere in the<br />
whole of the western world. That's point two. Point three: I<br />
have said that we will not be using the revenue which arises from<br />
this decision simply to undertake new expenditure programs. It<br />
will be used to ensure that either the deficit is reduced or we<br />
take other compensating measures which are necessary to protect<br />
the economy, We are not regarding it as some windfall gain just<br />
to finance some additional government expenditures. And tbe<br />
fourth point is this: not everyone across the land has criticised<br />
iti. I welcome the way in which you, many sections of the business<br />
community and others have recognised that if government doesn't<br />
take the right and correct tough economic deeisions we will be<br />
worse off in the long run..<br />
JONES: You' re dead right, PM. I'm sorry -unfortunately as you know,<br />
you have your problems'and I've got mine. I've got the news<br />
coming up and we'll have to call an end there,* PM1.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Sure, and thank you very much indeed.<br />
JONES:<br />
Thank you for speaking with us. PM, and keep putting those tough<br />
lines out because I think the country needs it and they're<br />
looking for that from you.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Thank you very much indeed.<br />
JONES: Thank you Prime Minister, speaking to the Prime Minister of<br />
Australia,' Mr. Bob Hawke. </p>
