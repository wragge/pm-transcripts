LIBERAL PARTY DINNER<br />
HjOLT EILECTORATE. Vic. 19 ~ 197 2<br />
Speech by tY7 e Prime ! Minister, the at Hon.<br />
William cI ahon, CH, MP.<br />
Ladies anr2 Gentlemen,<br />
To start with I think you woTculm like me to thank rr and M1. rs<br />
Bill MontaguLe f or providinag us with thie opportunity to be here. It<br />
is a real gathiering of the% la. t<br />
We are here not only to meet and have a happy time; we are<br />
here to heln in every way we can to ensure that L1EN REID, is going to<br />
come back into the Government at the next election with the thumping<br />
majority he deserves. This function is a tiut to him. I t is a<br />
tribute to -tnie Libarals in the Division of Nolt who have helped make<br />
it a success. Hiolt is rather uniaue and unusual. In a mi-nute I wdill tell1 you<br />
why it has a rat-her uniaue and unusual membcr in Len Reid. MTh-i s<br />
electoral division w-as namecd after a mar, who was an outstanding<br />
Australian, an outstanding Victorian, ancl an outstanding Liberal Prime<br />
Liinister. I refer of course. to the Lato IFarold Fio'] t.<br />
I'm told tt~ sdivision is in fact one of the fastest growing<br />
electorat3R in Australia, after Mitchell, on the Western. outskirts of<br />
Sydney and Diamond Valloy.. which covers thgrowing N'orth-eastern<br />
s uburban fringe of iMcrlbourne. The point about these t*. iree elactorateos<br />
is that they arc, all in~ ra-nidly deveoi e suburban areas, anrd t-hey<br />
are all held 1, y Liberals.<br />
Ele-: ctora. tes; like this are truly a part of the suburban oxnlosion<br />
t-hatinas been going on around the edges of Irga ciisfrsm<br />
years now. :, anv of the peonlc who are moving into these areas aroe<br />
young couples with young feirilies, who are zstablishing their first h1-ome.<br />
They have particular needs in housing, in hatin education, in roads,<br />
In power, sewerage and in othor conmunity facilitie-fmnykns ./ 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
So you find tocharacteristics neculiar to the7, e new areas3<br />
growth and youth which pose speci al orobl. orr, to be solved, and these<br />
need special remcdies anQ solutions. The effort to meetk. the problems<br />
of community development is one for all c-1 us at all levels of gove--rnment<br />
at the local govern~ ment level and I believe it is fundamental<br />
to Persevere and co-opsrate wi-t1h local gc-verrment.<br />
This afternoon, on the way here, I atte-nded a civic reception<br />
at Springvale in this electorate. Springvale is one of the:, fastust<br />
growing districts in Victoria, or in Australia for that matter, arnd it<br />
is, I would say, a good example of tlle grow)., th explosion I have roferred<br />
to. The second love], of government invinlvnd is ofE course, tho Statte<br />
government with its multitude of specific rcs * nnsibilities. The third<br />
link in the chain if3, of course, my own government in Canbcrra. Now the<br />
problecms and needs oif this rapid urban grcwth rainge across th-e thrt-! r<br />
lcvels of govcrnment and in soma places thay inelvita-bly overlao). Put<br />
it should be remenmberced that thesce ara nroblems which are a-nnratad by<br />
grow.-th and orogress thzi sel--ve9. Thoy occur cgzainst a backdrop) of a<br />
developing, diversifying and continuousl! y xan:. gnationa. l economy.<br />
Thc-y are nroblems whaich will not ba swernt av-ay-by finae nhrases or<br />
fulsome promises in f~ loction year. Tile-' 11il. only lbeovrmey ain<br />
and intelligent co-opra~~ tic'n between all of the thiree tiors of our*<br />
Australian systrem of go'verniment.<br />
Our opponents think it is fashionablo thc--se days to claim we have<br />
a crisis" in our cites imilar to--th ose srome comnoar-11. la cities<br />
overseas. That, cf course, is wi,-ldly inaccurat--. IkovrtheLe-ss we in<br />
thea Commonwealth Goverrnnt know).. you are corncoried, cand righ-tly so. We<br />
know,-you want actiJon now to imprfove today's living conditions and to<br />
avoid the greater nrnolems of tomorrow. No ono. c,-n nretend taat the<br />
citiescb not have oroblems such as high lani costs,' atmospheric<br />
pollution, traffic ccongeton, long distance commuting, recreational<br />
congestion, * Lack rf coirxiinity centres in the outer suburbs, and an<br />
increased crime ratze, violence and other srcial prob,-, lems.<br />
Basically, these are tasks for the tiers of our government<br />
structure which arc closest to them, and they are-the local and state<br />
governments. But this d -os not any means indicate that we in Canberra<br />
do not * h-ave, a very strong indirect interost, nor does it mean we ara<br />
not 3ympathetic. Let meolan<br />
Ile i n Canberra sc-, onen of our vitally important dutie(-s as the<br />
management of the national economy. Success in national economic areas<br />
is fun-famental to the growth wh7' 1ich the suburban explosion iimn.. lies. It<br />
is fundamo-ntal that. national ceconomny be kapt h:! althy and . crntiniuo-usly<br />
expanding. I hope I say this modestly.<br />
I h-ave had a good deal of di-rect exnerienca in financial and<br />
economic management as Treaourcr and now% in my nresent portfolio. On<br />
that score I think th-. at we can faiirlv claim that our own flexible and<br />
sensitive approach to the difficult economic nroblems we have be'en<br />
confronted with, and our willingnl. s-7 to act boldy and without delay to<br />
take positive decisions in stimulating the-ieconorny arc now, paying off<br />
4n the return of business confir,! nce, and the continuing improvement in<br />
the employment situation. </p>
<p>Only on Tuesday, my colleague, the Minister for Labour and<br />
National Service, announced the April figures for employment. They<br />
showed unemployment . was down by nearly another 5,000 to about 93,400.<br />
This was a far cry from the anguished cries and the fear predictions<br />
of the Leader of the Opposition and his Lieutenants. It is no thanks<br />
to him, or his industrial snokesman, tr. Cylde Cameron, or to Mr. Hawke<br />
for that matter. They saw unemployment as a fear issue, as something<br />
to be exploited. The more unemployed, the more votes.<br />
Well, that one has blown up in their faces. So have others<br />
where they have sought to pull the wool over the eyes of the electorate.<br />
Remember the " reform" and I have that word in inverted commas of the<br />
Victorian Labor Party? That exnloded when the " reformed" Victorian<br />
Labor Party broke out in cheers for the North Vietnamese aggression<br />
against South Vietnam. The support of the Labor movement for<br />
demonstrators and even violence, has grown in strength. That blew up as<br />
well. I am glad to hear that some Labor politicians are now adding<br />
their voices to the call to observe the law in the streets, even if it<br />
is belated. I look forward to them extending their call to observe<br />
the law on draft dodging as well.<br />
But to return to my main theme here tonight on the question of<br />
urban development: The second area of our involvement this is interconnected<br />
with our overall role of economic management is in our<br />
continually increasing financial allocations to the states. Before<br />
people become too carried away with labels like urbanisation, or urban<br />
affairs, or phrases like the challenge of the cities, they should stop<br />
to consider the billions of dollars for housing, for roads, for water,<br />
for sewerage, for hospitals, and for many, many other facilities that<br />
have resulted from the long years of practical co-operation between<br />
Commonwealth and State Governments under Liberal and Country Party<br />
Governments. For the current financial year, the states works and housing<br />
allocation alone is 92 million dollars. It is left to state<br />
Governments tc decide how they spend those allocations and most other<br />
capital and revenue assistance from us. We believe it is right that<br />
they should have this right. They are closer to these problems than we<br />
are. They have the administrative experience.<br />
Lastly there are the ways in which the Commonwealth directly<br />
assists in coping with the snrecial needs and nroblems of the new, urban<br />
areas. Health and education are two areas where we have made specific<br />
decisions within the nast few days and weeks. Example the most common<br />
fee has been increased in Victoria and accepted by doctors here without<br />
further cost to fund contributors. We have in education moved directly<br />
and for the first time into providing money to build school classrooms.<br />
Previously, we wre ::. elping with science blocks and libraries.<br />
Now we will be building the schools themselves, for both government and<br />
independent schools for all Australian children in all Australian schools.<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>We will also shortly he making an imnr-ortant * policy statement on<br />
the Commonwealth's apnroach to,. enviro~ nmental questions, and of course,<br />
there is the other large area of dire--ct commonwealtii assistance. That<br />
is social wefr. This is an aro. a in which Led Raid hais shown himself<br />
to bc a man of great compassion and &amp;--termination in both-',* a national<br />
and international sense. His concern knows no borders and no limitationo.<br />
That is why he was such a strong advocate of our help for Bangladesh.<br />
Lilco him, I am proud that Australia was one of thea first to go<br />
to the aid of Dangladosh and one of the first to recognise that new<br />
nation and new member of the Commonwealth. On the home scene hc has been<br />
a determine~ d advocate of certain important reforms in our non7, ions and<br />
social welfare structure.<br />
Well Chairman, I do not want to int(*_ rrot the proceedings<br />
and furthicr, But I did want to indicato to you and those who are Iicre<br />
this evoning how we in Canberra and w,, e in the Liberal Party are thinking<br />
on these problems: How' we aro ore'pared to heir) co-oneratively axvi<br />
constructively in urban develcomont; and' hnow we do not favour an<br />
impractical and unworkable rystem of long-. range bureaucracy to C'.&amp; al with<br />
essentially local problems such as that favoured by the Labor Party. </p>
