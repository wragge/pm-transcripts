CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY IRM E ASI ST R<br />
FOR PRESS 6 May 1976<br />
TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION<br />
When this Government was-elected to office last year, Japan's<br />
. Prime Minister conveyed to us as well as his congratulations<br />
his desire that the basic treaty of friendship and cooperation.<br />
be broug; ht to an early conclusion.<br />
The Government, sharing Prime Minister Miki's desire, has<br />
given the highest priority to bringing to a successful conclusion<br />
the negotiations for the treaty negotiations which had<br />
become ratherprotracted in 1975.<br />
I can inform the House that the negotiating,, officials<br />
have agredd on a draft text of the treaty of friendship and<br />
cooperation. Both Governments have been closely following<br />
the progress of negotiations. Issues have been referred by<br />
officials to their Governments : for decisions as they arose.<br />
As of today the outstanding issues of substance have been resolved.<br />
It may therefore be expected that the two Governments will have<br />
little difficulty in approving thedraft. It can be expected<br />
that the treaty will be signed by Prime Minister Miki and<br />
myself during my visit to Tokyo in the winter recess.<br />
Strengthening and deepening the bonds between Australia and<br />
Japan is one of this Government's foremost policy objectives.<br />
It is no accident that one of my first international visits<br />
the first planned visit other than my visit to New Zealand<br />
is to Japan and China.<br />
0<br />
Over the past twenty years, economic relations between our.<br />
two countries have expanded in magnitude and importance.<br />
Japan has become Australia's largest trading partner, Japan<br />
is second only to the United States as a supplier of<br />
Japanese imports.<br />
In the trade area, Liberal and National Country Party<br />
"' Governments have long sought to extend Australia's relations<br />
with Japan in 1957 we took the major step of signing<br />
the agreement of commerce with Japan. This agreement was of<br />
great mutual value to r: he two countries and contributed<br />
to the present extent of Australian-Japanese trade. </p>
<p>In 1971 we established the Australia-Japan Ministerial<br />
Committee in recognition of the fundamental importance<br />
of the economic relations of our countries.<br />
But trade relations no matter how fruitful are not and<br />
cannot be the totality of countries contacts with one another.<br />
In the case of Japan and Australia the mutually profitable basis<br />
of economic exchange makes it even more important that there<br />
should be an understanding by the two countries an understanding<br />
of their peoples, language, culture and traditions.<br />
In furtherance. of the objective of greater understanding,<br />
this Government introduced into this Parliament the bill to<br />
establish the Australia-Japan Foundation.<br />
The Foundation will promote the study by Australians and<br />
Japanese of the language, culture, social economic and political<br />
institutions of one another's countries. It will enrich Australian-<br />
Japanese relations both by understanding that knowledge<br />
can bring, and no less importantly, by the personal contacts<br />
between Australians and Japanese thai the Foundation's work<br />
makes possible.<br />
The Possibility of a broad treaty between Japan and Australia<br />
has a long history being first raised in the 1950' s and raised<br />
again in the 1970' s. It was discussed at the first meeting<br />
of the Australia-Japan Ministerial Committee in 1972.<br />
The Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence<br />
reported in favour of a treaty framwork in 1973. Later<br />
that year, the then Prime Minister proposed that negotiations<br />
for a treaty should begin.<br />
The present Government's commitment to successfully conclude<br />
the treaty of friendship and cooperation a-d Prime Minister<br />
Miki's desire that it should be concluded gave new impetus to<br />
negotiations which have been delayed during 1975. The result<br />
was today's outcome.<br />
As the draft of the treaty is still confidential and formally<br />
subject to consideration and approval by the two Governments<br />
it would not be appropriate for me, at this stage, to discuss<br />
it at length. The treaty of friendship and cooperation is<br />
broadranging, and covers virtually the whole relationship<br />
between Australia and Japan.<br />
The treaty is unique in the history of international relations.<br />
It is designed to be an umbrella under which further agreements<br />
may , be make and relations developed in specific areas.<br />
It accords significant reciprocal benefits.<br />
The treaty will be the most important step ever taken by<br />
Australian Governments in our relations with Japan. It will set<br />
the stage for a new and even more cordial, era in our dealings<br />
with the country which, in a generation, has become our main<br />
trading partner, and a corner storneof stability in the region<br />
of which Australia is a part. / 3. </p>
<p>In the treaty, the Governments and the peoples of Australia<br />
adn Jaoan, have fashional an instrument designed to help<br />
close zhose gaps in und: s-anding which remain:; and to<br />
bring new progress and cznfidance in areas where friendship<br />
and cooperation are alreaiy established. It will lead to a relationship<br />
of greater intimacy.<br />
But the significance of the treaty lies not only in our<br />
relations with Japan. The great. understanding and closer ties<br />
between the two countries on a wide range of fronts the treaty<br />
makes possible will not only be of great mutual benefit. It will<br />
also benefit the countries of the west Pacific and strenghthen<br />
forces for peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
In.; closing, I place on record the strong spirit of mutual<br />
accommodation which has made the Treaty possible. That<br />
spirit augers well for the century of the Pacific of which we,<br />
Japan and our neighbours, are now embarking. </p>
