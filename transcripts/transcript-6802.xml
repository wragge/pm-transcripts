,1jj~ g R<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 6 December 1985<br />
The head of my Department, Sir Geoffrey Yeend, has advised<br />
me that on medical advice he wishes to rplinquish his<br />
appointment and retire from the Public Service in the early<br />
part of 1986. Sir Geoffrey has been Secretary of the<br />
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and Secretary<br />
to Cabinet since 1978.<br />
While this is a matter of real regret to me and to the<br />
Government, I have of course indicated that I shall respect<br />
Sir Geoffrey's wishes.<br />
In his forty years of service in government administration,<br />
including more than seven years as head of the Prime Minister's<br />
Department, Sir Geoffrey has held many sensitive and responsible<br />
positions. I am pleased to say that Sir Geoffrey has indicated<br />
his willingness to be available on a part-time basis to<br />
serve on Government advisory bodies.<br />
A new appointment to the position of Secretary of the Department<br />
and Secretary to Cabinet will be announced in due course. </p>
