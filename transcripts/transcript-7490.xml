CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
INDIA-AUSTRALIA JOINT BUSINESS COUNCIL<br />
NEW DELHI 10 FEBRUARY 1989<br />
* This is the third time the India-AustraLia Joint Business<br />
Council has met.<br />
Previous meetings, hel. d in 1987 and P988, have witnessed a<br />
substantial and long-overdue expansion in trade between our<br />
two countries. Indeed those meetings have been a significant<br />
cause of that growth.<br />
Because whenever business people of this calibre get<br />
together, with the spirit of constructive endeavour that<br />
characterises this Council, then the result can only be<br />
better communication, greater understanding, more<br />
co-operation in short, a more productive environment for<br />
the expansion of our commercial ties.<br />
But as you begin this third meeting, we are justified I<br />
believe in saying that we are on the verge of an<br />
unprecedented improvement in the volume and diversity of<br />
trade between us over the next few years.<br />
My confidence in making this prediction is based on two key<br />
factors.<br />
First, the very positive atmosphere in which my talks with<br />
the Indian Government, includinq Prime Minister Gandhi, are<br />
taking place, is creating the best possible framework for<br />
closer economic co-operation.<br />
And second, the endeavour, commitment and capacities of the<br />
corporations represented here today shows as never before a<br />
determination to seek out new opportunities in Australia and<br />
India. At the outset I want to pay tribute to our Indian hosts today<br />
and in particular to acknowledge the vital contribution<br />
played by my good friend Rajiv Gandhi. </p>
<p>His visit to Australia in late 1986 gave a real boost to what<br />
had previously been a stunted commercial relationship between<br />
US. It was during that visit that Mr Gandhi and I agreed to<br />
establish this Joint Business Council, in order that we could<br />
explore the opportunities that exist for business and trade.<br />
Since that time, two way trade between our two countries has<br />
grown steadily. Last year, 1987--88, it totalled nearly three<br />
quarters of a billion dollars a 17 per cent increase on the<br />
previous year.<br />
But it is apparent that we can still do a great deal more<br />
than we are doing at present. Relative to its enormous<br />
potential, the volume between us is still very small. And we<br />
should diversify our trade beyond the commodities regime that<br />
has traditionally dominated our commercial links.<br />
In our talks yesterday, Prime Minis. ter Ghandhi and I agreed<br />
on a new series of measures designed to achieve these goals.<br />
We agreed on a significantly enhanced development<br />
co-operation program, which should stimulate two-way<br />
commercial opportunities.<br />
We hope shortly to conclude a Concessional Finance Agreement,<br />
which will benefit development projects undertaken by<br />
Australian firms in India.<br />
We will sign today Memoranda of Understanding on<br />
Telecommunications, Meteorology and Railways.<br />
And we agreed to renew efforts to conclude a Double Taxation<br />
Agreement. In addition, over the coming year, Australia will be staging<br />
a display of Indian engineering products in Sydney and<br />
Melbourne in September; and hosting a mission to Australia of<br />
Indian automobile part manufacturers.<br />
When you think of Australia you may well think of wool,<br />
wheat, gold, coal, iron ore. We produce all these and we<br />
produce them more efficiently and competitively than any one<br />
elIse. We'll continue to do so. </p>
<p>But in the future I want people also to think of Australia as<br />
a source of telecommunications and other high-tech products,<br />
education services, value added commodities, consultancy and<br />
financial services a broad range of manufactured and<br />
service products which we can provide to our overseas trading<br />
partners and which we want to provide.<br />
In this regard Australia and India suffer from similar<br />
misperceptions held about us by other nations.<br />
We have been successful commodity producers in the past so<br />
successful in fact that our more recent achievements in<br />
diversifying our economies to encompass a greater<br />
manufacturing base are not so well recognised.<br />
We have to rectify that misperception.<br />
So it is with great interest that I note that Indian firms,<br />
too, have moved away from the more traditional exports of<br />
textiles, clothing and footwear and tea and coffee to, among<br />
other things, chemicals, computer software and car parts.<br />
These changes are partly in response to the reforms both our<br />
Governments have undertaken since 1984 to liberalise trade<br />
and industrial policies: these include a restructuring of<br />
the tax system; adoption of a more flexible exchange rate<br />
policy; and significant tariff reform.<br />
So as our two economies continue to restructure there will be<br />
obvious opportunities for us both.<br />
You in the Council are working hard to identify prospects for<br />
further profitable collaborations, in such fields as computer<br />
software, telecommunications, food processing and mining<br />
equipment. It is your members who provide the real engine<br />
for growth in our trade and economic relations.<br />
Over the last 12 months some Australian corporations White<br />
Industries, Olex, Redecon, OTC, Telecom Australia<br />
International, to name a few have made concerted efforts to<br />
secure major project work in India.<br />
Key projects like the Piparwar Coal Project are raising the<br />
profile of Australian/ Indian trade and highlight the<br />
complementarity between our two countries.<br />
Let me say how delighted I am that the discussions between<br />
our two Governments over the Piparwar project are now at such<br />
an advanced stage. This will be a tremendous achievement in<br />
its own right, and will give much encouragement to other<br />
companies seeking to invest in major projects in both our<br />
countries. I </p>
<p>Australia supports such endeavours by offering highly<br />
competitive concessional finance packages through the<br />
Australian International Development Assistance Bureau and<br />
the Export Finance Insurance Corporation.<br />
Other Australian corporations such as the National Australia<br />
Bank and BHP Petroleum are to be congratulated for taking a<br />
higher profile in India through the establishment of offices<br />
here. I warmly welcome the decision by the Indian authorities to<br />
allow the NAB to open a representative office here. This<br />
Sevelopment will extend further the financial linkages<br />
between our two countries.<br />
There is increasing activity in India by AUSTRADE with the<br />
aim of diversifying the economic relationship.<br />
I also want to highlight, as an area for co-operation with<br />
tremendous potential, the capacity for joint ventures between<br />
Australian and Indian companies. Progress here would, I<br />
know, be welcomed in both Australia and India.<br />
In my discussions yesterday with your Commerce Minister<br />
Mr Dinesh Singh, and also with Australian businessmen,<br />
particular emphasis was placed on joint ventures in India.<br />
Abundant skilled labour at very competitive wages could<br />
combine well with Australian capital and expertise. Such<br />
ventures could both tap the vast Indian market and use India<br />
as a base for exports to the region and beyond.<br />
SAlso highlighted in my discussions was Australia's world<br />
recognised expertise in telecommunications, ports, energy,<br />
mining and rail projects, and India's tremendous<br />
infrastructure demand. One example of the latter is India's<br />
envisaged expansion of its telecommunications network from<br />
around 4 million lines at present to 20 million by the turn<br />
of the century.<br />
I mentioned at the outset my optimism for the future of<br />
commercial relations between our two countries. We are<br />
progressively building a relationship which will yield real<br />
and lasting benefits to us all.<br />
I cannot leave this topic however without pointing to one<br />
important factor which must qualify any optimistic<br />
predictions made about the future of trade.<br />
Whatever nations such as Australia and India may do to build<br />
bilateral links, we also have the essential task of<br />
protecting the multilateral trading system.<br />
I I </p>
<p>Entrenched and increasing protectionist measures by the major<br />
developed economies are threatening the very foundations of<br />
the GATT system which fostered four decades of post-war<br />
global trade and prosperity.<br />
As was unfortunately demonstrated at the recent Montreal<br />
mid-term review, the intransigence of the United States and<br />
the European Community on the issue of agricultural<br />
protectionism has threatened the entire Uruguay Round.<br />
As agricultural producers, Australia and India have a<br />
fundamental interest in ensuring that the Uruguay Round<br />
succeeds.<br />
We must continue the campaign to pressure major economies<br />
into a more flexible approach on an issue of fundamental<br />
importance to our future prosperity.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
In closing I pay special tribute to all of you from Australia<br />
and India who have taken up the challenge of entering each<br />
other's markets.<br />
Other aspiring Australian and Indian businesses would do well<br />
to look closely at how you have succeeded, and apply the<br />
lessons to their own operations.<br />
The deliberations of the Council go to the heart of the<br />
commercial relationship.<br />
In inaugurating this the third meeting of the India-Australia<br />
Joint Business Council, I wish you every success in your<br />
discussions and in your work in the years ahead.<br />
