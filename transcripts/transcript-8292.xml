I'<br />
FOR MEDIA 3 MAY 1991<br />
Senator Nick Bolkus, Minister for Administrative Services,<br />
and Mr Ben Humphreys, Minister for Veterans' Affairs, will<br />
travel to Crete to attend on my behalf the ceremonies in<br />
commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Battle of<br />
Greece and Crete.<br />
I am also delighted and honoured that the Greek Deputy Prime<br />
Minister, Mr Tzannetakis, has been able to visit Australia<br />
to celebrate this anniversary.<br />
The principal commemoration of the Battle of Greece and<br />
Crete will be held in Crete during the week of 20 May,<br />
exactly 50 years after the commencement of the battle for<br />
Crete itself. A memorial overlooking the Galatas<br />
battlefield will be consecrated as part of the ceremonies.<br />
Australian Defence Force involvement in the ceremonies on<br />
Crete will be substantial. The Chief of the Defence Force,<br />
the Chief of the General Staff, and 104 soldiers including<br />
an honour guard and band will participate, and HMAS Perth, a<br />
successor of the original ship that took part in the Battle<br />
of Crete, will visit Greece and Crete. The Acting Minister<br />
for Defence will be announcing full details of the ADF<br />
participation today.<br />
Ceremonies in Australia to mark this important anniversary<br />
have included services at the Australian War Memorial and<br />
the Hellenic Memorial attended by Mr Tzannetakis, Defence<br />
Forces representatives and community and veterans' groups,<br />
and a wreath laying ceremony at the Cenotaph, Martin Place,<br />
in Sydney on 20 April 1991, which I attended.<br />
On this 50th Anniversary of the Battle of Greece and Crete,<br />
Australians r-ecall the sacrifices of Australian servicemen<br />
and of the Greek people during the Greek campaign and the<br />
Battle of Crete of 1941.<br />
In marking the Anniversary Australia pays tribute to the<br />
heroic efforts made to secure our freedom, and help to keep<br />
alive the memory of the sacrifices that both Greeks and<br />
Australians made to this end. </p>
