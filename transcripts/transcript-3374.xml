The Prime Minister announced today that the Government<br />

Gallery affairs until it is established as a statutory<br />
authority. It is expected that members of the Interim Council<br />
will become members of Council of the Gallery once there is<br />
a statute, and then serve normal initial terms of up to<br />
3 years. Members of the Interim Council are:-.<br />

Miss Pamela Bell ( Boonah, Queensland)<br />

Mr. David Wynn ( Adelaide)<br />
Mr. James Mollison, Director of the Gallery under<br />

Minister and Cabinet will also be members of the Interim Council.<br />
It is expected that legislation for the Gallery<br />
will be introduced in the Budget session of the Australian<br />
Parliament this year.<br />
A building for the Australian National Gallery, designed<br />
by the Sydney architects Edwards, Madigan and Torzillo is under<br />
construction on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra.<br />
It is expected that the Gallery will be open to the public in<br />
1978.<br />
