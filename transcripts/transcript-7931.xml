TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH THE HON BOB<br />
BROWN, MINISTER FOR LAND TRANSPORT, SHERATON HOTEL,<br />
BRISBANE, 27 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm very pleased to be here<br />
with my Minister for Land Transport, Bob Brown, to<br />
announce the commitment of the Government in its fourth<br />
term to a new Provincial Cities and Rural Highways<br />
Program. This will be to supplement our additional, our<br />
existing programs and it will mean that in important<br />
areas of Australia, more funding can be provided to<br />
upgrade our road system. roads, the regions where<br />
the next Labor Government may fund appropriate projects,<br />
with the cooperation of the relevant State Governments.<br />
as far as Queensland is Concerned, the area of North<br />
Queensland and west of the Divide and in Victoria, the<br />
Calder and Midland Highways and the Lincoln Highway in<br />
South Australia, roads in Tasmania and other major<br />
regional roads with high cost benefit ratios.<br />
Now I repeat, the distinction between what we are doing<br />
and the Opposition, is that these additional commitments<br />
are fully funded and, in our case, will be funded out of<br />
the additional tax we're imposing on luxury cars. I<br />
release with this commitment to the roads program the<br />
updated scoresheet on wages fiscal discipline which will<br />
show here the funding for these promises of $ 100 million<br />
a year in the next three years. And, as distinct from<br />
the Opposition's unfunded talk about another billion,<br />
here these will be funded and have no adverse impact upon<br />
the Government's budget position.<br />
So we take the position of our roads seriously. I put it<br />
in the context of making the point that in our seven<br />
years in Government we have spent 18 percent more in real<br />
terms on roads than did the Opposition in their period in<br />
Government which represents some $ 235 million in real<br />
terms annually. More spent by this Government. And in<br />
terms of the misuse of statistics that have been floating<br />
around this country as to the proportion of Government<br />
revenue that is dedicated to roads, let me make the point<br />
quite clearly that in this our last year that we've been<br />
responsible for road funding, we have allocated 19.42<br />
percent of our total revenue from oil to roads which<br />
compare with 19.06 percent. In other words the best part </p>
<p>of half a percent more of our revenue available to us<br />
dedicated to roads in our last year, compared with the<br />
last year of the Fraser Government.<br />
So however you look at it, as a proportion of revenue or<br />
in terms of the real level of funding, the record of this<br />
Government exceeds that of our predecessors. But we're<br />
not satisfied with that. We've announced, as you know,<br />
the $ 120 million black spot program and that depends upon<br />
cooperation from the States, accepting national<br />
standards. That $ 120 million is available to remedy the<br />
worst spots on our highways around Australia which have<br />
been responsible for fatalities. But in addition to that<br />
now a further $ 100 million to supplement existing<br />
programs. Bob, would you like to add anything to what I've had to<br />
say?<br />
SBROWN: Well thanks very much, Mr Prime Minister. What<br />
I'd like to emphasise, ladies and gentlemen, is that this<br />
initiative now which the Federal Government has committed<br />
itself to represents probably the fourth major initiative<br />
which has been taken by successive Labor Governments.<br />
It's a part of that continuum of Federal Labor's<br />
commitment to the development of a national, integrated,<br />
coordinated and efficient land transport system.<br />
The first element was the establishment of the national<br />
highway program in 1974. The next two elements were the<br />
Federal, the Hawke Government's commitment to index the<br />
amount of money which is going into roads at the federal<br />
level in order to make sure that the level of it is<br />
maintained at least in real terms. The third part of<br />
that four part program was the adoption at the beginning<br />
of last year of major roads of national economic'<br />
importance which would identify and fund now as national<br />
arterial roads.<br />
This is the fourth and this, of course, it complements<br />
the Prime Minister's black spots program to which he's<br />
already made reference. A commitment on the part of the<br />
Government to put another $ 110 million into those spots<br />
around Australia where crashes have been occurring, where<br />
people have been dying and as a result of that we're<br />
going to lift them out of the system as well.<br />
This is a project of enormous significance because what<br />
it does, is to supplement those existing programs and to<br />
make it possible for us to identify other roads of<br />
national economic importance and to target funds<br />
specifically into those roads. And that's what we'll be<br />
doing. The Prime Minister indicated in Queensland, for example,<br />
that we'll include roads in Northern Queensland which are<br />
important nationally, which are important to develop our<br />
capacity to export and to replace imports and to overcome </p>
<p>the current account deficit, as a contribution towards<br />
it. The roads on the western side of the Divide in<br />
Queensland, the additional assistance to the Pacific<br />
Highway, additional assistance for those roads in<br />
provincial and rural Australia which we feel probably<br />
hasn't been sufficiently picked up under those existing<br />
programs. So that's the essence of it an initiative of major<br />
national importance. I'm delighted to be associated with<br />
it and, of course, I'm delighted to be here with the<br />
Prime Minister when he announces it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, could I just get clear with<br />
respect to the Pacific Highway, are you saying that extra<br />
funds are now available if the State Government upgrades,<br />
lifts its priority existing funds<br />
PM: Well, what we're saying is that under the, forget<br />
this new program, under the existing funding arrangements<br />
there's the capacity for work to be done there. But we<br />
are saying that if the State Government wishes to give<br />
this area that you're talking about priority, then funds<br />
are available out of this amount for that area as well.<br />
But I don't really want to add to that.<br />
BROWN: I think we should understand that the Pacific<br />
Highway is not a national highway, it's a State highway<br />
and there wouldn't be Very much sense in our attempting<br />
to determine national priorities-on the State highway<br />
system. If the New South Wales Government wants to<br />
accord it a higher priority, then there is provision, as<br />
the Prime Minister indicates, under this program for us<br />
to pour more money into the Pacific Highway. I would<br />
expect that that would be one of the results. But the<br />
priority needs to be determined by the New South Wales<br />
Government, not only in terms of the existing assistance<br />
that we provide at the national level for New South<br />
Wales, but also in terms of the amount of money which New<br />
South Wales will provide for that road out of its own<br />
resources. And we're prepared to help, but we can't take<br />
over the, the full responsibility nor would any Federal<br />
Government ever do so.<br />
JOURNALIST: cents in the dollar raised from petrol<br />
taxes, what now is the Federal Labor Government returning<br />
to motorists with this latest addition?<br />
BROWN: Well, what we're returning to motorists with this<br />
latest addition is another $ 430 million, that's including<br />
the black spots program, over the next three years. But<br />
I would appreciate it if the media and the Australian<br />
community could get rid of this simplistic nonsense about<br />
the need to establish some type of connection between the<br />
money we raise in a particular type of tax and what we<br />
spend on road funding. What this Government has been<br />
about is to determine priorities between all of those<br />
conflicting and competing programs. And, as you know, </p>
<p>the Prime Minister has just indicated, that in our seven<br />
years we have increased funding in a period of very tight<br />
fiscal restraint by 18 percent over and above the seven<br />
years of our predecessors. That represents, in terms of<br />
dollars, an additional $ 19.6 billion in today's terms, in<br />
today's prices that we've put into the road system. We<br />
shouldn't, any more than we say we'll determine how much<br />
we'll put into education on the basis of how much income<br />
tax school teachers pay. That would be absurd. It's<br />
equally absurd for us to say that we will determine our<br />
level of road funding on the basis of how much tax<br />
motorists pay. Motorists still have kids at school, they<br />
have parents and friends in hospital, they have parents<br />
on pensions, they're concerned about defence and they<br />
know that when they pay a fuel tax it goes to help the<br />
Federal Government and the States. Because the States<br />
pick up a fair amount of that as well, and local<br />
government. It helps the three levels of government then<br />
to meet those commitments. So we're not about y'know,<br />
that whole question of hypothecation, determining how<br />
much we'll put into roads on the basis of how much tax<br />
comes from any particular source.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, to put this into<br />
perspective, am I right in thinking that $ 100 million<br />
will build about 20 kilometres of a four-lane highway and<br />
if you split that between the States, it's a bit over<br />
three kilometres each?<br />
PM: Well, if that's what you regard it as the only way<br />
in which you could spend this money, those statistics may<br />
be accurate. Bob can confirm them or not. But if you<br />
look at the statement you'll see that what we're saying<br />
to the States is this money is this available to on<br />
the priorities that you want to spend and it can include,<br />
it's their decision, some assistance in regard to<br />
relevant rail areas. So this is something which<br />
supplements a position which we've already made clear<br />
that that is a position of an 18 percent real increase in<br />
overall funding over what existed before. It's not as<br />
though here, this is all that's going to be available.<br />
It's simply the recognition that if more can be done it<br />
ought to be done, but it ought to be done in the sense of<br />
fiscal responsibility. We're not going to have, as I<br />
say, the drunken sailor approach of the Opposition. The<br />
documents released today, Laurie, show this will be fully<br />
funded. It will not mean therefore that other services<br />
have to be cut or that you detrimentally effect your<br />
situation. JOURNALIST: But don't you concede, Prime Minister, that<br />
kilometres of four-lane highway across the nation is a<br />
piddling contribution?<br />
PM: If that's all that you were applying to roads and<br />
that's exactly how you were going to use this amount.<br />
Obviously it's a misrepresentation of the total<br />
Commonwealth Government effort. I mean, either you say </p>
<p>that yes, well you're going to try and do something more<br />
in identified areas of need and whether it's that sort of<br />
highway that you're talking about or some other form of<br />
outlay which will meet needs, is something to be<br />
determined in association with the States.<br />
JOURNALIST: But Mr Brown is talking about pouring money<br />
into the Pacific Highway. I mean, it would hardly make<br />
much impact at all there would it?<br />
PM: Well, I think you heard what Mr Brown said, is that<br />
if the New South Wales Government makes a decision in<br />
respect of that amount of money which will be available<br />
to it under this enhanced program, if they want to give<br />
that priority then this money would be available for<br />
those purposes if that was decided as a priority.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, there's a major road, major<br />
tourist area from Sydney to Brisbane. Isn't it a farce<br />
to say simply that this is the State's concern? It's<br />
just an adjustment that you're making in terminology. It<br />
sounds like buckpassing as to who's..<br />
PM: No question of buckpassing. Mr Brown can say<br />
something about this in a moment. Let me make the<br />
general point that for better or for worse in this<br />
country we live in a federal system where there is a<br />
division of responsibility. That's not my creation or Mr<br />
Brown's creation. That is the Constitutional fact of<br />
life. They have a responsibility in the area of<br />
education, for instance. They have a responsibility in<br />
the area of roads. They have responsibilities to a whole<br />
number of areas. But what my Government has done if you<br />
like is to take the area of education and of roads just<br />
to take those two we have made a massive increase in<br />
the way in which the Federal Government provides<br />
assistance to States in areas where they have a primary<br />
responsibility. You want to look at education, you know<br />
the figures are there. There's a more than doubling of<br />
secondary education allowances, the trebling of Austudy,<br />
all these sorts of things where we have supplemented the<br />
fundamental responsibility of the States. And so it is<br />
in the area of roads. I can't change the Constitution,<br />
don't want to change the Constitution and create one<br />
national Government. There are State governments with a<br />
responsibility. What we've done is very significantly to<br />
enhance, very significantly to enhance the Commonwealth<br />
contributions. Just look at the figures. An 18 percent<br />
real increase in funding by my Government compared to the<br />
period of the Fraser Government. Put in annual terms,<br />
that's $ 235 million per annum in real terms over and<br />
above what was done before. And as I say, you've got the<br />
$ 120 million black spot program and now this additional<br />
$ 100 million a year program. I don't know whether you<br />
want to add to that?<br />
JOURNALIST: Why did you take 6 years to index road<br />
funding? </p>
<p>BROWN: If perhaps I could supplement what the Prime<br />
Minister has already said about that. I think it's quite<br />
remarkable, you know, that we've become so blase about<br />
the amount of money that's going into roads. The Prime<br />
Minister has already indicated that from the three levels<br />
of government, over the last seven years, there's been<br />
almost $ 30,000 million that's gone into roads. And when<br />
we think in terms of those we feel as though we can<br />
dismiss new initiative which is going to put another<br />
$ 430 million. That's not chicken feed, that's, that's<br />
big dollars. That comes out of the taxpayers pocket and<br />
the taxpayers are entitled to expect that that money will1<br />
have been spent properly and this Government gives them<br />
an absolute assurance that it will. That it will. $ 430<br />
million is not chicken feed. That's a big injection into<br />
the road system. It was the same sort of thing that was<br />
said when the Prime Minister indicated that we would<br />
provide another $ 110 million to assist the States to<br />
remove some of those black spots, some of those dangerous<br />
spots, some of those crash centres where people are<br />
dying. We were told that a half, an extra half a million<br />
dollars would have the effect of saving an extra one life<br />
a year on average. $ 110 million means that the Hawke<br />
Government will be assisting State governments and local<br />
governments to save another 220 lives on average every<br />
year. And some people people tell you it's peanuts.<br />
Well, 220 lives a year really isn't peanuts and those<br />
amounts are substantial. It's not, Laurie, just a<br />
question of how much can be dual divided carriageway<br />
for example can be constructed with $ 430 or $ 300 million<br />
extra over the next three years. It's a question of what<br />
we're going to put back on top of, and what we're putting<br />
it on top of is a commitment over the period of the ACRD<br />
program, for the Federal Government to fund the nation's<br />
roads to an extent in excess of $ 6,000 million. These<br />
are enormous amount. How can it possibly be said that<br />
these are small amounts, or insignificant? And in<br />
addition to what we've already done, we're going to look<br />
at some of those other roads of national economic<br />
importance on the Prime Minister's initiative. No Prime<br />
Minister has ever shown so much concern for the national<br />
road system or national land transport or road safety as<br />
this Prime Minister has. And that's obvious to everyone.<br />
We're meeting our rhetoric with funds, solid dollars that<br />
the taxpayers are committing through us to supplement<br />
those programs.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke or Mr Brown, are you happy with the<br />
progress the State Governments have made in coming up<br />
with a uniform set of road laws<br />
PM: Well, Mr Brown's obviously been the one who's been<br />
associated with the negotiation with the States and I<br />
think he can obviously more easily answer that.<br />
BROWN: Let me say that some of those attempts that we've<br />
made to achieve uniformity, and the Prime Minister </p>
<p>referred to the fact that we'ye inherited a federal<br />
system, yes we have. We've inherited a federal system.<br />
We've inherited with all of those enormously important<br />
Constitutional and democratic safeguards associated with<br />
the fragmentation of power under federal systems. And<br />
we'ye also inherited a number of problems and the one<br />
that you refer to is one of them the question of<br />
uniformity. We've said that a person who's driving a car<br />
drunk doesn't suddenly do something moral and legal when<br />
he or she reaches a State boundary. So we need that<br />
uniformity. But as a result of some of initiatives that<br />
we've taken I want to give credit to all of the State<br />
Transport Ministers and Territorial Ministers from<br />
wherever they come. We had it tested over forty years to<br />
achieve uniformity in many of these critical areas. We<br />
are now doing it, we are now doing it. Of course there<br />
are some problems there, some sticking problems. I hope<br />
that the State and Territory Transport Ministers and<br />
governments will see their way clear to adopt the package<br />
that the Prime Minister presented to them. And if they<br />
do that, as they should, as they should, that will make<br />
an enormous improvement in the whole question of road<br />
safety right across Australia and we will start to reduce<br />
that 2,800 people who died on our roads last year and<br />
30,000 people who were injured on our roads last year, at<br />
a national cost of $ 6.2 billion. We'll start to reduce<br />
that, but we have to have the support and the cooperation<br />
of State and Territory Transport Ministers and<br />
increasingly, as a result of the sort of initiative that<br />
was offered by the Prime Minister to them, increasingly<br />
they' re responding.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, with the new impost on luxury<br />
cars, there's likely to be some elasticity in that<br />
market. If you don't get the amount of money that you're<br />
anticipating as a result of the tax for this road<br />
project, do you guarantee it will be made up from other<br />
areas? PM: Yes. Let me make two points about that. We're<br />
responsible in the way we go about this and in drawing up<br />
the we asked for estimates from the best source<br />
that's from Treasury. Now we can't do any better than<br />
that and our figures which are contained in the<br />
scoresheet are based on the information and advice<br />
provided to us. So we are confident in the accuracy of<br />
their advice. Obviously we have shown the capacity in<br />
the past to find savings if it's necessary. Now if you<br />
took the worst case assumption, if you took the worst<br />
case assumption and there was some difference in the<br />
elasticity outcome, if we can use the economic jargon,<br />
then we would find the necessary minor additional<br />
savings. We've shown the capacity to do that over this<br />
period, but we've acted on the best advice available to<br />
US. BROWN: In fact, could I say Mr Prime Minister, that $ 100<br />
million by the way, tends to be on the conservative side. </p>
<p>It's very possible that because of the elasticity<br />
considerations that you refer to, that the total amount<br />
that would come in from that could be in excess of $ 100<br />
million. As the Prime Minister has indicated we are<br />
earmarking every dollar, every dollar from that to go<br />
into roads, so<br />
JOURNALIST: if it's a larger amount does that mean<br />
BROWN: That's what our statement is indicating.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, on the question of tax<br />
again, if there were to be further personal tax cuts in a<br />
fourth term of the Labor Government, would they be fully<br />
funded and not as a result of traffic<br />
PM: Now, let's now get this, further tax cuts into<br />
perspective. You know the answer I gave yesterday and<br />
there's not a great deal of mileage in it I can tell you.<br />
What I've said yesterday, I was asked a question would<br />
there be further reductions. I said if, if it were<br />
regarded as appropriate and economically responsible,<br />
that would happen. There is nothing on the agenda about<br />
further tax cuts. I'm simply saying in the course of the<br />
term, if that were to emerge. Now the statement I made<br />
carries it's own answer. We're not going to be in<br />
terms of what I said yesterday we're not going to be<br />
talking about tax cuts if it were not economically<br />
responsible. It wouldn't be economically responsible if<br />
you couldn't do it in a way which lets the integrity of<br />
overall budget considerations in shape. But I can<br />
assure you that it's not something which is, you know,<br />
specifically on the agenda. It was an answer to a<br />
question which I believe was asked in good faith and it<br />
was nothing more than that. If a circumstance arose<br />
where you thought it was the appropriate thing to do,<br />
well then you'd obviously consider it and do it, but it's<br />
not on the agenda.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, are you concerned developments<br />
on the Japanese financial markets could very likely delay<br />
any fall in interest rates in Australia?<br />
PM: Well, I noticed the comments in today's financial<br />
Press from within the financial community that their<br />
expectations of a capacity for further falls in<br />
Australian interest rates could still be accommodated<br />
within some fall in the Japanese market associated with<br />
an increase in Japanese rates. I have no reason to<br />
differ with that suggestion that's been made from within<br />
the market.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, in the event that the uncertainty<br />
in the Tokyo market were to gain momentum, and create a<br />
shakeout in your financial how would the Government<br />
handle the situation here in a caretaker capacity? </p>
<p>PM: Well, obviously there are some things that you can<br />
do in a caretaker period. We would not walk away from<br />
the responsibilities we have for the management of this<br />
country. But we obviously want to honour the type of<br />
convention which says you don't make major decisions<br />
during an election period. But I have no reason to<br />
contemplate that any such major decisions in the economic<br />
area would, would be required.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, there's been allegations<br />
that while you've been dogged by the pilots and their<br />
families, the children have been placed in danger by your<br />
entourage etc<br />
PM: Their children have been placed in danger by me and<br />
my entourage? You would have to be joking. I mean, let<br />
me interrupt here. I will not cop, I simply will not cop<br />
any suggestion that any children of pilots have been put<br />
in danger by anything that I or my people have done. My<br />
people, Federal Police, have contacted the Australian<br />
Federation of Air Pilots when they saw that these people<br />
were wantonly bringing young children into potentially<br />
dangerous situations and said, look the Prime Minister<br />
takes the view, of course that you are perfectly<br />
entitled, as you are, to demonstrate, make your point of<br />
views known. But they pleaded with them and said, look<br />
don't have little kids there because you never know what<br />
may happen, so please don't have them there. And the<br />
people from the police who contacted them were given the<br />
assurance it wouldn't happen and we saw yesterday I<br />
mean, an appalling situation yesterday. There was one of<br />
these pilots in his stolen uniform, I might say, it's<br />
quite clear they were in stolen uniforms, with a small<br />
child in his arms. I mean, the irresponsibility of these<br />
people. We're the ones who pleaded with them not to<br />
create that type of situation.<br />
JOURNALIST: Back to road funding, Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: It took six years for the Federal Goverrnent<br />
to index road funding. Can you give an assurance now<br />
that it is indexed, that it will be continue to be so?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, this morning on talkback radio you<br />
condemned caller in regard to Asian immigration. He<br />
said he was backed by opinion polls. How many<br />
Australians, do you think share a racist position with<br />
that caller?<br />
PM: I don't know the answer to that question. But you<br />
would have to say that in a country of 17 million peoplee<br />
there are obviously some who share his mistaken and<br />
dangerous view. There are obviously some, I can't put a<br />
figure on it. But what I can say with absolute certainty </p>
<p>is that as long as I am Prime Minister of this country<br />
there will be no aid, comfort, succour or support given<br />
to those views and I say it, as I said this morning on<br />
that program, for two reasons. The moral reason I think<br />
should be clear to everybody. In my life there is<br />
something that has been fundamental to me from as long as<br />
I can remember and that is the repugnance of any<br />
suggestion that any human being on the face of this earth<br />
is inferior because of the colour of his or her skin, the<br />
shape of their eyes, or anything like that. I find that<br />
just morally repugnant and I will resist that attitude<br />
with all the force and vigour at my command. I also said<br />
that it was economically insane and indeed treacherous to<br />
the interests of this country. I made the obvious<br />
point that we live, fortunately, in the most dynamic,<br />
fastest growing economic region of the world. And what<br />
sort of condemnation do we hand on for our children and<br />
their children if we say to the nations and the people of<br />
Asia, you're a second-class mob or a third-class mob. We<br />
want to trade with you, but as far as our immigration<br />
program is concerned, you can't come here because you are<br />
inferior to other people in the world. Very rightly and<br />
inevitably in those circumstances, the nations of Asia<br />
would say, alright if we are inferior citizens, don't<br />
worry about trading with us. So if you want to do<br />
something which would most certainly condemn, the future<br />
generations of this country, to a second or third class<br />
economic status, just embrace that morally objectionable,<br />
repugnant philosophy.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you think the Reserve<br />
Bank Governor should be commenting on issues like foreign<br />
debt during an election campaign which bound to<br />
become an issue, and do you agree with his assessment of<br />
Australia's position..<br />
PM: I see no reason why Governors of the Reserve Bank<br />
shouldn't make comments. I guess no-one, including<br />
yourself, would probably object to him making comments if<br />
they were getting up the Government's nose. Of course<br />
they're not. They are objectively making a point that<br />
the policy stances of the Government are relevant, are<br />
working. So that's the basic answer to your question. I<br />
have no objection to the Governor of the Reserve Bank<br />
making comments at this time any more than I have an<br />
objection to the Business Council of Australia just<br />
coincidentally having a summit on debt during an<br />
election. I mean, I know there'll be no political<br />
significance in that, they've assured us of that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, if you're re-elected, would you<br />
see yourself making some changes to your mega-ministry?<br />
And secondly, would you support what seems now a<br />
reasonably widespread feeling in Caucus that there should<br />
be a bit of opening up, freeing up of the ballot for<br />
ministry after the election, for conditions of the<br />
ministry? </p>
<p>PM: I think the mega-ministry system has worked very<br />
very well. Let me make this point that I'll at a later<br />
stage of the campaign be developing in some more detail.<br />
But if you wanted one sign of the gross irresponsibility<br />
of the Opposition and the price which they are asking<br />
Australia to pay for their internal hatreds and<br />
divisions, it is their promise that they would break up<br />
the mega-ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. There is<br />
not one analyst of the Australian political and economic<br />
situation who does not acknowledge the appropriateness,<br />
the effectiveness of having Foreign Affairs and Trade<br />
joined. Everyone knows that that's right. But because<br />
of the hatred and the bitterness and the divisions<br />
between the National Party and the Liberal Party and for<br />
no other reason they are saying they'll break up Foreign<br />
Affairs and Trade. And at, may I say, an absolute<br />
criminality as far as the interests of Australia are<br />
concerned to accommodate the bitterness of the coalition.<br />
So the answer is no I will not be changing the megaministry<br />
ministry concept. It may be Michelle, let me<br />
say this, that you may want to see perhaps in one or two<br />
areas a marginal increase in ministerial assistance. Let<br />
me be quite specific in the area that Bob's in, Transport<br />
and Communications. I think the concept is working well.<br />
There's been in this last period however a large number<br />
of very significant issues in both Transport and<br />
Communications. It may be, and I'll talk after the<br />
election with my colleagues who've been in that area to<br />
see whether they think that perhaps a little bit more<br />
ministerial assistance would be desirable there. That's<br />
no change of the mega-ministry situation but it's just an<br />
intelligent assessment of whether some additional<br />
assistance would be desirable. Now as far as the second<br />
part of your question no I remember that the second<br />
part of your question. I witnessed with a certain amount<br />
of interest after the first election that the ministry<br />
was able to persuade their colleagues that there was no<br />
need for a ballot. Substantially the same the second<br />
time. But of course that's not surprising. It's not<br />
surprising that the Caucus took the view that the<br />
ministry was good because, as you know, Dr Hewson doesn't<br />
get many things right, but he did get one thing right. I<br />
remind you of what Dr Hewson said. Dr Hewson said that<br />
the Hawke Government is the most professional government,<br />
is the most professional government and probably has the<br />
best ministry since the war. Now Dr Hewson is right.<br />
Absolutely right. It's a view shared by the Caucus in<br />
the past. A tremendous ministry. Now I think, having<br />
said that, that<br />
JOURNALIST: They all want to get into it though.<br />
PM: Yes, well it's a class act. As Dr Hewson has said,<br />
the best since the war. I mean it's the one thing that<br />
Hewson said that I think he got absolutely right. Now I<br />
think that after the next election, which we'll win, that<br />
there probably will be an election because we are in the<br />
fortunate position, the very fortunate position as </p>
<p>distinct from our opponents that we have a great fund of<br />
talent. A great first eleven or first eighteen or<br />
whatever particular number you want to choose. A great<br />
frontbench and a lot of talent on the backbench. So I'm<br />
in the fortunate position of knowing that after the<br />
election when they have an election in the Caucus that<br />
once again I will be given a ministry of outstanding<br />
talent. JOURNALIST: The Opposition tell us that their<br />
sophisticated reception meters<br />
PM: How does that feel Bob? What about here, how<br />
does that feel? Now when I say boo, what do you feel<br />
like? This is serious of course.<br />
JOURNALIST: Point taken Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Thanks.<br />
JOURNALIST: They're now going to rejig their campaign<br />
because the electorate, or at least the people who are<br />
plugged into these meters, weren't, I believe, assured by<br />
your statements on living standards. In other words,<br />
they've detected a huge credibility gap out there in the<br />
electorate for you with your assurances on living<br />
standards. PM: Well thank you Paul for that question. Let me say<br />
first of all in regard to the basic point about the<br />
question as to what was the reaction to the debate.<br />
You'll notice that I said afterwards that I was relaxed<br />
about the outcome and I'm pleased to see that generally<br />
speaking people seem to have made a judgement about the<br />
debate. I don't go to that any further. But on the<br />
question of living standards well just before I get to<br />
that I must, I just really do want to say something about<br />
the debate and reactions a little bit more generally.<br />
fascinating position of course now where Mr Peacock<br />
is seriously asking you to believe, all of you, is asking<br />
you to believe, all you people, that it was a clever<br />
strategy that they'd worked out before the debate not to<br />
ask many questions. Really. They sat down and they<br />
worked out before the debate having a national<br />
advertising campaign there are questions to be asked of<br />
the Prime Minister. Consistent with that public<br />
advertising campaign that there were questions to be<br />
asked of the Prime minister, then given the opportunity<br />
on national television when they had the Prime Minister<br />
there, that they decided not to ask him any questions. I<br />
simply ask you do you believe Mr Peacock when he says<br />
that? I mean there's one thing that came out of the<br />
debate very clearly and it's this. Not only have the<br />
Liberals not got the answers, they haven't even got the<br />
questions. Now let me go onto the question of living<br />
standards. I don't know how many mistakes that Mr<br />
Peacock made in the debate but just a few have hit the<br />
headlines today. Could he have got the Landcare promises </p>
<p>more mixed up than he did? I mean you've got<br />
spokespersons for the Leader of the Opposition's office<br />
running around trying to say what he meant and what he<br />
didn't mean and how much he's committed and how much he<br />
hasn't committed. He was quite wrong on the question of<br />
what his Opposition spokesman had said on allowing<br />
mineral exploration in Stage 2 of Kakadu Park, the<br />
question I asked him. He was wrong in his answer.<br />
Because it's come out quite clearly, as I said on the<br />
program, that in October, as far back as October, that<br />
his shadow spokesman had indicated that there could be<br />
mineral exploration in Stage 2. And if you, well just go<br />
on and on, all the things he got wrong. But coming to<br />
living standards, he was wrong on that. The University<br />
of NSW, the independent study there, has indicated that<br />
on average there has been an improvement in standards.<br />
That doesn't mean that in certain categories that it has<br />
been reasonably tight. It does mean, when you undertake<br />
that analysis, that this Government has undertaken to do<br />
what it should do, and that is to really look after those<br />
most in need in this community. I can't tell you just<br />
how touching it is to receive letters, as I do, from<br />
people saying what the Family Allowance Supplement has<br />
meant to them. Now just think, just get an idea of the<br />
dimension of what that's meant for standards of people<br />
who most need help. You take the case of a single income<br />
family on $ 320 week. Now the family allowance supplement<br />
has meant for them they get $ 110 a week tax free with<br />
three kids. $ 110 a week tax free which is equivalent to<br />
a wage increase of $ 170 a week. That's the human element<br />
of the the national aggregate which is over $ 2 billion a<br />
year being paid to low income families to help them look<br />
after their kids. So when you talk about standards, you<br />
don't just look at what's happened to real wages, as Mr<br />
Peacock has said. But standards and real disposable<br />
income is made up, as I've said and I repeat, it's made<br />
up of these things. It's made up of wages, money wage<br />
movements of prices, of tax cuts, of jobs. How many more<br />
employment and the families, and it's made up of what<br />
happens to social justice payments. And when we take all<br />
those components, then on average this is not Hawke's<br />
statistic, it's the statistic and the accepted statistic<br />
of the independent body of the University of NSW that on<br />
average those standards have increased. So it's quite<br />
clear. But the final point, let me make. I'm rather<br />
surprised really, if I may say so, that the analysts<br />
haven't picked this up. I've made it clear in the<br />
Parliament before. I suggest it's worth pursuing Mr<br />
Peacock. Just have a look, I suggest again, refresh your<br />
memory on page 53, page 53 of the document which they<br />
entitled Future Directions and which I christened Futile<br />
Diversions. Look at page 53 which you'll recall Mr<br />
Peacock said Future Directions still had authority within<br />
the Liberal Party. On page 53 of Future Directions you<br />
will see this. The acknowledgement that there'd been a<br />
change in the terms of trade which had affected<br />
Australia. And then the criticism, the direct criticism<br />
in these terms. Labor has attempted to protect certain </p>
<p>sections of the community from the effect of a reduced<br />
national income. Now please understand the fundamental<br />
significance. There's nothing more significant in a<br />
sense in this whole misrepresentation campaign of the<br />
Opposition. What are they trying to do in this campaign?<br />
They're trying to say there's been a reduction in<br />
standards and attacking us. In their own document on<br />
page 53 they said that there'd been a reduced national<br />
income flowing from the terms of trade, a reduced<br />
national income and attacked me, and attacked the<br />
Government for trying to protect certain sections of the<br />
community from the effect of that reduced national<br />
income. Now you can't have it both ways. You can't be<br />
parading around the country attacking this Government<br />
because there's been a reduction in standards and in your<br />
own document on page 53 attack the Government for saying<br />
that in the face of a reduction in national income you've<br />
attempted to protect certain sections of the community.<br />
Mr Peacock ought to be nailed on it. I mean is it<br />
possible to have it both ways? Can you on page 53 of the<br />
document say there's been a decline in national income<br />
which means a fall in standards and attack the Government<br />
for trying to protect standards and then on the other<br />
hand run around and attack the Government because<br />
standards have fallen.<br />
JOURNALIST: With general reference to living standards<br />
and specific reference to the events of lunchtime<br />
yesterday what's the price of a pot?<br />
PM: A middy is $ 1.20 mate and let me say, let me say<br />
When I went to this group who were all very supportive I<br />
was going to put more on and they said no, $ 5 is enough.<br />
I thought $ 5 was a bit light-on myself. But $ 5 was<br />
enough. But $ 1.20 I believe is a middy mate. A lot more<br />
that when I was consuming a few of them too.<br />
JOURNALIST: In your speech on microreform on<br />
airlines airlines deregulation. Will you go to the<br />
next Labor Party conference and pursue your attempt to<br />
get a change in policy on the ownership of Australian<br />
Airlines? PM: I said on the program this morning we've got some<br />
processes underway in the party where they're looking at<br />
what's involved in the funding capital requirements of<br />
the airlines, Michelle. We'll get the reports and<br />
consideration of those committees what they feel about<br />
it. The Minister will report to me. We'll make up our<br />
mind in the light of those reports.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, if you go back to debt for<br />
one minute, do you accept the assurance of the BCA that<br />
the debt summit is not politically motivated or do you<br />
think it's designed to damage your<br />
PM: I suppose, I mean if they wanted to be absolutely<br />
sure had any political connotations, I suppose they </p>
<p>could put it off until after the election. I mean then<br />
no-one could possibly say, could they, no basis for<br />
criticism. I don't think that's occurred to them. I<br />
think they think it's appropriate to have it at this<br />
time.<br />
ends </p>
