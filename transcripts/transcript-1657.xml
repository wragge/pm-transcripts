COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. HAROLD HOLT, M. P.,<br />
ON<br />
ABORIGINALS-GOVERNMENT POLICY<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 7 September 1967]<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT ( Higgins-Prime<br />
Minister)-by leave-Mr Speaker, I wish<br />
to inform the House of certain decisions<br />
that -the Commonwealth Government has<br />
taken in respect of Aboriginals following<br />
the referendum in May of this year and<br />
subsequent discussions with the States.<br />
Before doing so, may I briefly remind<br />
honourable members of the two changes<br />
that have been made in the Constitution<br />
and the reasons for them?<br />
Section 127 of the Constitution has been<br />
repealed. This section provided that, in<br />
reckoning the numbers of the people of<br />
the Commonwealth or of a State or other<br />
part of the Commonwealth, Aboriginal<br />
natives should not be counted. The framers<br />
of the Constitution had, as their principal<br />
reason for including this section in the<br />
Constitution, the practical difficulty of<br />
counting the Aboriginal population at that<br />
time. In 1900 this was a very substantial<br />
problem. Today, however, the facilities for<br />
including Aboriginals in a census are<br />
greater and the need for the section no<br />
longer exists. This was -the first change.<br />
12695/ 67 The second change has been the deletion<br />
of the words ' other than the aboriginal<br />
race in any State' from paragraph xxvi of<br />
section 51. Section 51 ( xxvi) of the Constitution<br />
formerly read:<br />
' The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution;<br />
have power to make laws for the peace,<br />
order and good government of the Commonwealth<br />
with respect to:<br />
( XXvi) The people of any race, other than the<br />
Aboriginal race in any State, for whom<br />
it is deemed necessary to make special<br />
laws.'<br />
This part of the Constitution had been<br />
framed as a protection for Aboriginals but<br />
a belief had developed that it was discriminatory<br />
and, while the Government considered<br />
this to be erroneous, the belief persisted.<br />
It was felt therefore that the words in<br />
question should be removed and this has<br />
now been done. One effect of omitting the<br />
words has been to confer upon the Commonwealth<br />
a power to make special laws<br />
for the people of the Aboriginal race in<br />
any State if the Parliament considers it<br />
desirable or necessary. This is what we call </p>
<p>a concurrent legislative power. In other<br />
words, it is now possible for the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament to legislate, but it does<br />
not mean that the States automatically lose<br />
their existing powers. There has been, and<br />
there is, no intention on the part of the<br />
Commonwealth that authority should be.<br />
as it were, wrested from the States.<br />
The public voted overwhelmingly in<br />
support of these changes and the Government<br />
took steps to recognise the implica-<br />
. tions of that vote. In my second reading<br />
speech on the Constitution Alteration<br />
( Aboriginals) Bill 1967 on 1st March of<br />
this year, I said that, if proposals relating<br />
to Aboriginals were approved, the Government<br />
' would regard it as desirable to hold<br />
discussions with the States to secure the<br />
widest measure of agreement with respect<br />
of Aboriginal advancement'.<br />
Commonwealth and State Ministers<br />
directly concerned with Aboriginal affairs<br />
met in Perth on 21st July for their normal<br />
biennial meeting. My colleague, the Minister<br />
for Territories ( Mr Barnes), represented<br />
the Commonwealth Government. A wide<br />
ranging discussion took place on policy and<br />
administrative matters relating to Aboriginals.<br />
There was a general agreement<br />
among the States on their relationship with<br />
the Commonwealth in these matters and<br />
there will be, of course, further consultations<br />
in the future. A report on the meeting<br />
recently held will be made to the House<br />
by my colleague, the Minister for Territories,<br />
I believe at the conclusion of what<br />
I now have to say.<br />
I would stress at this point that, while<br />
the Commonwealth Parliament is now in a<br />
position to make laws and to prevail should<br />
a conflict arise with the States, the Commonwealth<br />
does not seek to intrude unnecessarily<br />
in this field, or into areas of<br />
activity currently being dealt with by the<br />
States. There is a big variation in circumstances<br />
and needs of Aboriginals in the<br />
different States, as all honourable members<br />
who have made a study of this matter,<br />
will readily agree. For this reason, administration<br />
has to be on a regional-or Statebasis<br />
if it is to be effective. This is the<br />
only practical way of ensuring that Aboriginals<br />
receive direct attention and<br />
assistance. The Government believes that the needs<br />
of Aboriginals should continue to be kept in their true perspective as predominantly<br />
social problems and not magnified or misrepresented<br />
to suggest that the problems<br />
are racial. The Government also believes<br />
that it is not right to say that the Commonwealth<br />
and the States have done little<br />
in the past for Aboriginals. A great deal<br />
has been done by Australian governments<br />
in recent years and I will say more on this<br />
point later.<br />
The prime function of the Commonwealth,<br />
in the light of these changes to the<br />
Constitution, will be to carry out a policy<br />
co-ordinating role. The Commonwealth will<br />
not assume the responsibility for administration<br />
which is largely with the States,<br />
except in those areas like the Northern<br />
Territory where we already have a direct<br />
commitment. There will be a significant<br />
advantage in policy co-ordination and this<br />
should facilitate the sharing of experience<br />
by the Commonwealth and the States in the<br />
interests of our Aboriginal citizens. It will<br />
also allow us to keep the Aboriginal question<br />
properly in its perspective in our<br />
international relationships.<br />
To achieve this objective, the Government<br />
proposes to establish an Office of<br />
Aboriginal Affairs in Canberra. Its task will<br />
be to co-ordinate policy and to provide the<br />
machinery necessary for joint consultations<br />
as the need arises with the States and with<br />
relevant Commonwealth departments. The<br />
new Office will draw on the experience of<br />
the Department of Territories and have its<br />
assistance in any administrative support that<br />
miy be needed. The Office itself, however,<br />
will come within the Prime Minister's<br />
Department. It will thus come under my<br />
own administration and have a central status<br />
as the Commonwealth agency co-ordinating<br />
policy affecting Aboriginals. This arrangement<br />
will facilitate communication between<br />
the Premiers of the States and myself on<br />
Aboriginal matters, and further it will provide<br />
a special avenue of communication<br />
with the Government by Aboriginals themselves<br />
or by organisations representing them.<br />
The Commonwealth will make appropriate<br />
financial provision required by the<br />
policies and particular decisions adopted<br />
in the future by the Commonwealth either<br />
on its-own initiative or arising out of Commonwealth<br />
and State consultation. We will<br />
also continue the present practice of making<br />
financial provision for Aboriginal </p>
<p>advancement through its Departments of<br />
Territories and Interior where our direct<br />
responsibilities are concerned and to the<br />
States in the general context of Commonwealth-<br />
State financial arrangements.<br />
Through the Department of Health we will<br />
conduct special health surveys and campaigns<br />
among Aboriginals, as we have in the<br />
past, in co-operation with the States. We<br />
will continue to finance the Australian<br />
Institute of Aboriginal Studies through the<br />
Department of Education and Science. The<br />
Office of Aboriginal Affairs will be able to<br />
exercise a valuable co-ordinating role in all<br />
these matters. These Government activities,<br />
Commonwealth and State, have been<br />
strongly and effectively supported by church<br />
missions and by many voluntary organisations<br />
throughout Australia. This devoted<br />
work, I am confident, will continue.<br />
The Commonwealth has already done<br />
much in its own right to advance the welfare<br />
of the Aboriginals as members of the<br />
Australian community. I pay tribute to the<br />
States for what they have done in their own<br />
fields. At the same time, I commend to your<br />
notice the work and results achieved by our<br />
own Department of Territories which, for a<br />
number of years now, has accepted tasks<br />
beyond the normal limits of its responsibilities<br />
in Aboriginal welfare.<br />
The Government long ago established a<br />
policy of assimilation as the proper policy<br />
for Aboriginals. At a conference of Ministers<br />
in 1965, the definition of assimilation<br />
was revised to read as follows:<br />
The policy of assimilation seeks that all persons<br />
of Aboriginal decent will choose-<br />
I emphasise the words ' will choose':<br />
to attain a similar manner and standard of living<br />
to that of other Australians and live as members<br />
of a single Australian community-enjoying the<br />
same rights and privileges, accepting the same<br />
responsibility and influenced by the same hopes<br />
and loyalties as other Australians. Any special<br />
measures taken are regarded as temporary<br />
measures, not based on race, but intended to meet<br />
their need for special care and assistance, and to<br />
make the transition from one stage to another in<br />
such a way as will be favourable to their social,<br />
economic and political advantage.<br />
The word ' assimilation' is often misunderstood.<br />
There is nothing mandatory or<br />
arbitrary about it and it does not mean<br />
interbreeding with the avowed objective of<br />
eventually eliminating the Aboriginal<br />
physical features or Aboriginal culture. It<br />
may be that this will happen but if it does it is a matter of individual decision and<br />
not of policy. Assimilation means that the<br />
Aboriginals can be similar to other citizens,<br />
not, of course, in looks, but with regard<br />
to all the privileges and responsibilities of<br />
citizenship. Our aim is to help the<br />
Aboriginals to become an integral part of<br />
our Australian community life.<br />
The Aboriginal population in Australia<br />
is increasing and some forecasts suggest that<br />
the number might double by the end of<br />
the century. The Aboriginal population in<br />
Australia is now a little over 130,000. It is<br />
made up of 44,600 full blooded Aboriginals,<br />
77,500 part Aboriginals and 8,000 Torres<br />
Strait Islanders. There is, as honourable<br />
members know, the widest range of social<br />
levels in our Aboriginal population. There<br />
are nomads-a few only now-living an<br />
utterly primitive life remote from civilisation.<br />
There are some living a tribal existence<br />
and some living an urban existence. There<br />
are others at all stages of advancement<br />
between this and full participation in the<br />
life of the wider Australian community as<br />
fully assimilated citizens. It is wrong<br />
perhaps to put a money value on what we<br />
are doing for Aboriginals but at least some<br />
figures will give evidence that what we are<br />
doing is increasing in scale. Last year the<br />
Commonwealth and the States spent S21m<br />
specifically on Aboriginal advancement and<br />
this year the figure will be higher. Our own<br />
figure is significantly higher and we await<br />
the States Budget provisions, but we know<br />
they will be higher. In 1944 Australian Governments<br />
were spending just under<br />
$ 500,000, so there has been a very big<br />
and important increase in expenditurefrom<br />
less than $ 500,000 to $ 21m.<br />
The Commonwealth has already provided<br />
$ 4,500,000 for Aboriginal advancement this<br />
year-a 27% increase on expenditure last<br />
year. There are other less visible areas of<br />
Government assistance to Aboriginals<br />
because, as citizens, they benefit in the<br />
normal way like other Australians from the<br />
services provided by various Government<br />
Departments. In the last few years the Commonwealth,<br />
State and Northern Territory legislatures<br />
have been active in progressively removing<br />
all discriminatory legislation from the relevant<br />
acts of Commonwealth and State<br />
Parliaments and, therefore, direct benefits<br />
are not as readily identifiable as they were<br />
in the past. </p>
<p>It is sometimes thought that the bulk<br />
of the problems arising in connection with<br />
Aboriginals will disappear provided money<br />
is made available on a large scale. This<br />
approach does not sufficiently recognise the<br />
fact that many of the problems are psychological<br />
and social in character and that the<br />
expenditure of money that is not directed<br />
to solutions based on assured practical<br />
foundations will not resolve, but may<br />
accentuate, some of the problems.<br />
Assimilation as we have defined it is<br />
two-way, requiring adjustment in outlook<br />
and a sympathetic understanding on the<br />
part of citizens both of European and<br />
Aboriginal race in the community. In the<br />
legal and formal sense none of the opportunities open to Australians generally are<br />
closed to Aboriginals. What is needed in<br />
many cases is help which will equip the<br />
Aboriginal, by education and in every<br />
possible way, and in their outlook, to avail<br />
themselves of these opportunities. To attain<br />
our goal, patience, persistence and understanding<br />
are essential. What we are doing<br />
will not mean that Aboriginals, as citizens,<br />
will lose their identity, their pride of race<br />
and their culture. It will mean that, through<br />
successive generations, cultural adjustments<br />
will take place-as they do in every society<br />
the world over-and that our Aboriginals<br />
will grow, without any enforced transition,<br />
into the national environment in which they<br />
live.<br />
