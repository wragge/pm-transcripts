Bogor, Indonesia</p>
<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono have announced during the annual Australia-Indonesia Leadersâ€™ Meeting in Bogor the establishment of an Indonesia-Australia Red Meat and Cattle Forum. </p>
<p>The Prime Minister also announced today a $60 million funding package, to be provided over 10 years, for increasing agricultural cooperation and boosting investment in the red meat agribusiness sector in Indonesia.</p>
<p>The Forum will comprise a broad range of representatives from the beef and cattle industry, including well recognised and established industry figures and senior government officials. </p>
<p>The Forum will enhance engagement between the Australian and Indonesian beef industries and the governments of both countries. It will also improve prospects for long-term trade and investment in beef in Indonesia.</p>
<p>To capitalise on the opportunities for agricultural cooperation and investment, the Forum will recommend activities to build the meat supply chain and encourage greater Australian investment in Indonesia. The $60 million package will be available to kick start these activities, which would benefit both Australian and Indonesian consumers and producers.</p>
