TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, ORIENTAL HOTEL, BANGKOK<br />
2 FEBRUARY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
* JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you disappointed that Bill.<br />
Kelty has described the idea of taking housing out of the CPI<br />
for wages purposes as conceptually flawed?<br />
PM: No, I don't make any judgement on that statement of Bill<br />
Kelty's. I know that the ACTU is agreeing with the idea of:<br />
examining the way in which the issue is being treated. out<br />
of that discussion that will take place we would hope to get<br />
a process which is most appropriate for all purposes for<br />
which the CPI is used. I don't get upset by that comment by<br />
Mr Kelty.<br />
JOURNALIST: But it does seem to make it less likely that<br />
your proposal will get carried through.<br />
PM: Well we'll see what happens. The Statistician himself<br />
has indicated that they're going to have a look at it, all<br />
the parties I think agree that it ought to be looked at,<br />
* let's see what happens.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you as confident-as you were the other day<br />
Mr Hawke that you can reach some arrangement with the ACTU<br />
about housing components for the last couple of quarters?<br />
PM: The overall point that I am confident about is that the<br />
wages outcome will be negotiated in a way which is relevant.<br />
to both the legitimate aspirations of the Australian<br />
workforce and they do have legitimate aspirations to<br />
maintaining and gradually through time improving their living<br />
standards. The equally important consideration which is in<br />
our mind is maintaining responsible economic management in<br />
the context of the circumstances, including the external<br />
circumstances, with which we're confronted. I'm confident on<br />
the experience of t1~ e last few years that t ' he trade union<br />
movement and the Government, together with input from the<br />
employers will get an outcome which is relevant to those two<br />
considerations. I've been confident about that all along, I<br />
have no reason to doubt that we can get that outcome.<br />
JOURNALIST: It would be disastrous wouldn't it if wages were<br />
to rise at the same sort of level as prices are now rising,<br />
wouldn't it? </p>
<p>PM: It would be disastrous if the wages outcome were not<br />
consistent with the capacity of the economy to sustain living<br />
standards and not impose too great a strain on the external<br />
account. Those are the criteria. I made it clear that a<br />
wages outcome which is not consistent with those criteria is<br />
not acceptable.<br />
JOURNALIST: Back in ' 85 you agreed to delay tax cuts for<br />
three months because of the economic situation. Would you be<br />
prepared to contemplate delaying tax cuts this time for all<br />
PM: That question hasn't arisen in my thinking at this<br />
stage. JOURNALIST: There's been a suggestion that there be somespecial<br />
allowance or weighting for people in Sydney because<br />
of the housing cost. What do you say to that?<br />
PM: I haven't addressed my mind to a particular weighting<br />
for Sydney people. I think that's just an issue that may<br />
arise in the discussions but I'm not going to prejudge that<br />
suggestion. On it's face I don't get terribly excited about<br />
it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Bangkok, is it possible to ask a question<br />
about your meeting with the Thai leadership?<br />
PM: Perfectly possible Peter.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think Prime Minister that you'll be<br />
getting the support from the Thais for the regional trading<br />
bloc group/ alliance, call it what you will, that you hoped<br />
for in Korea?<br />
SPM: I've to meet with the Prime Minister and other Ministers<br />
later this morning. I would hope that at the least they<br />
would find the concept one which is worth further analysis<br />
and discussion. I would hope and expect to get that reaction<br />
and I'll find out when I talk with the Prime Minister a bit<br />
later this morning.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is Kampuchea on the agenda today and what<br />
aspects will you discuss?<br />
PM: You couldn't be here and not have Kampuchea on the<br />
agenda. Yes, it will be discussed and both the external and<br />
the internal aspects will be discussed. The external aspects<br />
being of course the withdrawal of 1he Vietnamese troops and<br />
the phasing down of external assistance to the factions<br />
within Kampuchea. And then of course, internally, what will<br />
be the processes leading to an acceptable government within<br />
Kampuchea. Those are the essential issues and that's what<br />
I'll be discussing. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: putting regarding some possible<br />
international body and Australia's possible part in it?<br />
PM: Well those discussions about what is now talked of as an<br />
international control mechanism, the word mechanism being a<br />
generalised phrase to cover the differences which have<br />
existed between the concept of an international peace-keeping<br />
force on the one hand what some elements and on the other<br />
just a monitoring body, it is now referred to as a mechanism.<br />
Well I want to find out from talking to the Prime Minister<br />
and the Foreign Minister here just the latest thinking<br />
amongst the various parties and they are absolutely up to<br />
date with that about where the areas of difference are on<br />
that concept. Essentially what I will be indicating as far<br />
as Australia is concerned is that as an interested party and<br />
one with a record of concerned involvement on this issue<br />
Australia would stand ready to be of assistance in any sort<br />
of mechanism, if we can use the word that's in vogue now, if<br />
our presence i~ s desired. But I repeat, we are not here to<br />
push ourselves in as a participant in the final supervising<br />
process whatever form that might take but if it were regarded<br />
as desirable by the parties concerned then obviously,<br />
consistent with our past concern and involvement, we would be<br />
prepared to consider that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think it would be regarded as desirable?<br />
PM: By the parties? Well, I would tend to think so. Not<br />
every party would have exactly the same attitude by<br />
definition because you have such a range of parties. But I<br />
think generally speaking Australia's standing is such that<br />
they would regard it as sensible for Australia to have some<br />
involvement.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, there have been reports from<br />
Peking that Gareth Evans after his round of talks is<br />
pessimistic of an early Cambodian settlement, do you share<br />
that pessimism?<br />
PM: I don't accept that he has it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke the official figures show that the<br />
performance of Australian exporters in Thailand has been<br />
fairly mediocre. Are the faults all on the Australian side?<br />
PM: Well let's just get that in perspective. There has been a<br />
doubling of the performance in the last couple of years which<br />
is admittedly from a low base but it is not right to say that<br />
the movement is not substantial and in the right direction.<br />
But I think you are right in saying that compared with our<br />
trading relations with other countries in the region,<br />
in absolute terms its not as high as we would like. And in<br />
fact I will be proposing to the Prime Minister and other </p>
<p>Ministers a process whereby we can see a further significant<br />
improvement in that in the couple of years ahead. I think<br />
that there is a case to be argued that Australian businessmen<br />
haven't been as enterprising in Thailand as they should have<br />
been. The opportunities here are obviously very significant,<br />
and it is a country which is in a period of rapid economic<br />
growth with needs to greatly enlarge its infrastructure,<br />
significant demands for a range of materials of imports as<br />
well as manufactured goods. Now I think the opportunities,<br />
generally speaking haven't been grasped or pursued as<br />
vigorously as they might have been by Australian business.<br />
Always there will be some difficulties and you could point to<br />
some problems in the country concerned and there would be<br />
some here. But what we are about on this occasion is to try<br />
and create the framework at the government level, government<br />
to government level, which will ensure that the environment<br />
is there for the Australian business community, both the<br />
private sector to the extent that public utilities would also<br />
have a role, that the environment will be right for them to<br />
take advantage of very significant opportunties that<br />
undoubtedly exist here.<br />
