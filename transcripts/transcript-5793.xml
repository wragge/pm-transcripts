PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT WEDNESDAY, 14 APRIL 1982<br />
INTERVIEW WITrH JUNE BARTON MORNING EXTRA<br />
Quest ion<br />
Good Morning Prime Minister and thank you for joining us in<br />
the program.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
( inaudible)<br />
Question Sir, we are obviously facing uncertain economic times, what<br />
is your assessment of the Australian economy?<br />
Prime Minister,<br />
inaudible.... in the Australian economy. The country has<br />
grown. In spite of what people might want to say, the after tax<br />
household disposable income of Australian families has been risi-ng<br />
and there is a great deal of investment taking place. Investment<br />
gives us the basis for rising living standards and greater<br />
wealth for Australia in the years ahead. So, there are many<br />
strengths and there are also problems, and I imagine there always<br />
are in the management of an economy. The problems I think<br />
are basically twofold. The extent of wage increases, coupled<br />
with shorter hours and the worst of this has occurred over<br />
the last 10 to 12 months. Now that has put cost pressures<br />
into the Australian economy at -the very -time when overseas<br />
countries are becoming more competitive, when they are<br />
have been getting very low wage settlements, very often because<br />
of very high and tragic unemployment. So, we have been becoming<br />
less competitive, while overseas countries are doing things<br />
better, producing their goods more cheaply. The other thing<br />
that makes it difficult for Australia and indeed, makes, it<br />
difficult for every country around the world, is lack<br />
of growth in major industrial economies, the United States<br />
and in the major countries in Europe. That again of course<br />
makes it harder to sell Australian goods. It means that we<br />
need to do what we can do better and make sure that we remain<br />
competitive. These are the twin problems, the sluggish<br />
world economy and costs that have been rising too much in<br />
Australia over the last 12 months.<br />
Question So those pundits which are saying that we are in a mild<br />
slump, recession or heading towards a depression, in your view<br />
they are not correct? / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think this is over-. stated. There are problems that we have<br />
to face, we have to understand what is possible. A few weeks<br />
ago in the Parliament I sought to get a degree of balance into<br />
the national debate on what is happening both in Australia<br />
and overseas. There are some countries overseas that are in a<br />
far, far worse situation than in Australia because again while in<br />
this country the economy has been growing-we have been producing<br />
more as each year passes over recent times.-Zi number * of other<br />
countries, whether it is the United States or Germany or the<br />
United Kingdom there is no growth in their economies at all.<br />
Indeed, in a. number of areas they have been producing less than<br />
in earlier times. In the United States about four years ago they<br />
would have produced 15 million automobiles in their industry,<br />
last year they produced 7 million and there is massive unemployment<br />
in their motor industry, in spite of a fair degree of protection.<br />
In the home building industry in the United States, the number<br />
of new houses being built or started is running at about<br />
of what it would have been two years ago. If you put that<br />
against the situation in Australia, we are infinitely better<br />
off. Question Prime Minister we do have severalcallers already waiting to<br />
speak with you, so with your permission we will go ahead with<br />
the first one.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes that is fine.<br />
Question From Nafra in Victoria, Mrs Anne Bradbury you are now speaking<br />
to the Prime Minister.<br />
Caller-Mr Fraser this is a thought regarding unemployment, relief<br />
of unemployment. If . parenting was taught somehow in an<br />
expert way, by way of the media, and TV especially at night<br />
in a fun way, in a concentrated way by the direction of experts<br />
mothers and fathers would know how to raise children in a<br />
fun way. Especially fathers, if they could be shown h-ow to<br />
help, and mothers would be more content to stay in the ome<br />
and that would make more jobs available to the males, who are<br />
after all best suited to bring home the necessary means of<br />
support. It is just that we are so bored at home. We get<br />
too much ( inaudible) I was a nurse for a very long time<br />
and/ IlJwas happy in it. I did not want to be married because<br />
it is always a gamble, but when I did get married and suckled<br />
two children, it was the greatest joy. But now that they are<br />
teenagers and heading out into the world, I worry how they will<br />
be employed. If I could just teach the mums, please stay<br />
at home. But on the other hand, we have to teach the fathers.<br />
Question What is your response to this? / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think this is an interesting suggestion and obviously<br />
Mrs Bradbury is voicing things which I think are probably in<br />
many peoples' minds, how to bring up kids in a world that can<br />
be difficult, that can be very competitive. * At one point I<br />
thought Mrs Bradbury was saying we almost needed a school for<br />
parents and I am not sure if I am interpreting her remarks...<br />
Question I think perhaps Mrs Bradbury is saying parents should be taught<br />
how to be good parents.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
A very large number of parents of course are and this probably<br />
comes to people instinctively, but if parents believe they want<br />
help, guidance, I would agree with Mrs Bradbury that ought<br />
to be available. That can partly come I suppose in talking<br />
with friends, but there are also-family guidance organisations<br />
which are prepared and able to give advice, how much they<br />
can help in the specific circumstances Mrs Bradbury had in mind,<br />
I am not too sure because I have not tried them.<br />
Question Thank you sir, we will move on to another caller. Still from<br />
Victoria, from Talamba, Mr Mctrrison.<br />
Caller-South west Tasmania is part of the national estate which<br />
requires the Federal Government to ensure that no part of the<br />
national estate is destroyed if feasible and prudent alternatives to<br />
proposed threatening action exists. However, you have publicly<br />
stated that. the decision on whether the Franklin or more of<br />
the Gordon Rivers will be flooded is a matter for the STate<br />
Government. It seems to me that this is a clear abrogation of<br />
Federal responsibility in this matter and it seems thatthe<br />
Federal Government should intervene.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The Heritage! Commission Act affects the activities of Federal<br />
Government Departments and agencies, it does not impinge on<br />
state government departments and agencies and the states<br />
have always made these decisions in the past. Tasmania has<br />
had a referEndum on the issue, although I know there are<br />
questions about the basis of that particular referendum<br />
and this really is a decision that has got to be resolved in<br />
Tasmania. It is capable of being resolved in Tasmania and<br />
there you bE! very real difficulties stepping in on top of<br />
this kind of decision. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Caller one state government has already fallen over in this matter<br />
seems to indicate that they are not able to resolve the<br />
matter satisfactorily there.<br />
Prime Ministerarea, it is not<br />
If a government is responsible for a certain/ good enough to<br />
say well we have got to go to another government to get them<br />
to fix it, because just because one government may not be<br />
giving the kind of answers or making the kind of decisions<br />
that a person or a group of people want. This really is a<br />
matter that needs to be argued out in Tasmania. There is an<br />
election on and I have got no doubt that this is going to<br />
be a matter of higrh politics during the course of the Tasmanian<br />
election. Question We have a number of callers trying to get through, so please<br />
try to be a little patient. From the Central west of<br />
NSW we have Mrs Webb from the town of Forbes.<br />
Caller-Mr Fraser at the moment tax reform is on the Parliamentary<br />
agenda and I was wondering is there any good reason why<br />
income tax cannot be abolished and a value added tax inposed on luxury<br />
goods only, not food, or reasonably priced clothing or shoes.<br />
In this way the lower salary population would not be taxed<br />
at all. I feel that as every week goes by and you hear<br />
somebody in some occupation saying they only want to work<br />
so many days a week because of the tax burden. This goes even<br />
into the prcofessional field, dentistsand doctors and I think<br />
that it would get Australians working and create more jobs<br />
because as they would save they would have the money to buy<br />
the luxury g~ oods, I mean also the high priced clothing.<br />
Naturally people who are used to buying that type of clothing,<br />
they are not, going to buy cheaper clothing. I believe too<br />
there are qv. ite a number of aged people with considerable<br />
sums of monEy in banks that they don't want any interest on<br />
because it takes away their pension benefit and this is money<br />
that perhaps, could be used in cheap housing loans.<br />
Question What is your response to this Prime Minister?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think it i~ s a very nice idea, but I just don't think the<br />
figures would work. The countries that do have a value added<br />
tax or a retail turnover tax, do put that tax on virtually<br />
everthing that is sold in their countries because if they did<br />
not do that they would not be raising enough money to carry on </p>
<p>the business of government, supply schools, hospitals and roads<br />
and all the rest. The amount of money that you could get from<br />
luxury goods by taxing them is not allthat great. The present<br />
sales tax rate on luxury items is already about 30%, but there<br />
are not enough of those goods sold to give the revenue that<br />
you would need and that is why in overseas countries which<br />
do have a value added tax, they basically put it on all goods<br />
that are sold, and not only on goods, they often put it on<br />
services. If you are out in restuarants, or going to a<br />
drycleaners or whatever, there is a tax on the services that<br />
are provided through those sort of activities. If you were<br />
going to lower income tax substantially, you would need to put<br />
an indirect -tax across the broad range. of goods and services<br />
and it would need to be quite a substantial one and it<br />
would add at least-. in the short term very significantly<br />
to inflation. To give you a rough order of figures, to take<br />
one cent off the standard rate of tax costs the revenue about<br />
$ 700 million. About 1% on a retail turnover tax or a value<br />
added tax, might provide about $ 6 or 700 million in revenue.<br />
That is a rough order of figures, but you are dealing in very,<br />
very large sums. So, you are going to have to replace a huge<br />
amount of revenue if you want to abolish income tax. I must<br />
say I would : Love to be able to do it, it would be a wonderful<br />
idea. Caller-I understand that, but what about the aged people? Could you<br />
give them more confidence in their savings by not taxing them<br />
on their interest of their money, if they were to invest their<br />
money in a section of the bank that was to go to cheap housing<br />
loans. They would have that little confidence. I think mainly<br />
aged people when they get to the age of retiring they just<br />
want that little bit of security to know that their funds<br />
are not being; eaten away. IF they could invest this money openly<br />
to help the housing burden and not'be taxed on that income.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
This is one of the things that we did look at when we were<br />
introducing t~ he revised housing package, but up to this point<br />
we decided, that we should not pursue that path. We have<br />
indexed pens-.. ons and are' doing tha-E twice a year. We have introduced<br />
an income test only for pensions and did away with the asset<br />
test on capital to try and achieve the very thing that Mrs Webb<br />
is talking about, to try and give elderly people a degree of<br />
insurance in their older years. If you are going to enable<br />
older people to invest money and get the income off it and<br />
not have that: count for pension purposes, there<br />
are some contradictions if you are not going to make the<br />
same allowance for people who might be able to earn a bit of<br />
money by doing a bit of part time work, maybe handicraft and<br />
selling it. So, you have got a question of equity then, between<br />
different groups of elderly people and it is not one that<br />
is necessaril~ y easy to solve. / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Question<br />
We will move on to southern NSW to Wagga, where Mr SchaunanbergC?<br />
is waiting to speak with the Prime Minister.<br />
Caller I have done a few jobs in my life and I have been concerned<br />
about the unemployment of young people. I think we all are.<br />
NrV1 it has been proved to me that if you have been idle for<br />
a time they have got some opportunities to learn some bad<br />
habits regarding future job personnel are concerned. Unfortunately<br />
even if they are only out of work for 12 months, you don't<br />
get your real good type of work person out of that person<br />
that is my general experience. If concerns me also that<br />
on the other end of the-.-scale nearet to retirement age, you<br />
get people who would like to retire if they were only<br />
eligible fcr a pension. If we reduced our elegibility, instead<br />
of retiring at 65 but 60, that we can reduce the unemployment<br />
ratio and open up jobs for young people. I would like to<br />
have. your thoughts on that please.<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
The question of young people being able to find jobs is<br />
obviously a very serious one and it is a very important one.<br />
I think we need to bear in mind that a large number of young<br />
people go on-to universities or colleges. A large number<br />
also find work for themselves in their last year of school<br />
but there is a group of young people in each age group who<br />
do find a very real degree of difficulty. What we have been<br />
doing here is to try and develop in co-operation with the<br />
state governments school to work transition programs, different<br />
kinds of education programs, vocational training programs<br />
which will give young Australians a better opportunity to<br />
gain useful employment. About 220,000 to 230,000 Australians<br />
go through these courses in the period of a year so that the<br />
programs are reaching out to a large number of people and<br />
they are costing quite a lot of money. One of the things<br />
that is involved here is having secondary schools better<br />
able to suit the needs and the talents of all1 thepeople who<br />
go to those schools. For so long people thought that going to<br />
a university was the answer to everything, education at<br />
secondary shcools was orientated towards an academic career<br />
and helping people to get to university and the schools as<br />
a result were not paying enough to other young Australians<br />
who might not be all that good academically, but they had<br />
different talents of a different kind, but those talents were<br />
not being developed or encouraged at schools because the<br />
schools were not properly organised. Attention has been drawn<br />
to this by the Schools Commission and with the School to<br />
Work Transit-ion Program and with an increasing awareness that<br />
schools have got to try and provide courses that suit the<br />
talents of all their students. not just of the academically<br />
minded, I hcpp that we will get into a better . position and<br />
provide better training for young Australians. It takes a<br />
/ 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
while unfortunately to get all the changes that we would<br />
like. But I believe a good deal of progress is being made.<br />
As people have left and have got a job and have lost that<br />
job there are trainijg programs and special youth employment<br />
assistance programs designed to encourage and help young<br />
people gain useful employment. There are still areas of<br />
difficulty and still areas of hardship, so we review what<br />
we are doing to try and i mprove it as we gain experience.<br />
The idea of lowering the pension age is one that has<br />
been suggested-on a number of occasions, but I don't really<br />
think it would provide any long term solution to the problems,<br />
and I don't that it would necessarily assist young people by<br />
making places available to them that they would be able<br />
to take. The pension age for men is 65, if that were lowered,<br />
is that going to become the compulsory retiring age, or is it<br />
only going to be voluntarily. Probably I think the majority of<br />
people ant to keep active and keep working because that is<br />
one of the tairgs that helps to keep them young.<br />
Question Thank you Prime Minister, the next call is from Lake Cattai<br />
Mrs Kennedy.<br />
Caller If Britain declares war in the Falklands will Australia as<br />
part of the Commonwealth, automatically also be at war and if<br />
so what military force and strength have we got? And, will<br />
national service be recalled for the good an protection of<br />
our country?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There was a godd deal of static in that question so I will<br />
repeat what I heard of it and I could be told if it was<br />
accurate or not. I was asked if the British and the Argentinians<br />
go to war over'the Falklands, does that af fect Australia and<br />
then I think I was asked a question about national service.<br />
Were those the questions?<br />
Caller-That is right Prime Minister.<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
I hope very much that the dispute between Britain and the<br />
Falklands can be resolved without developing into a shooting<br />
war and I am sure we all do, but there has been unprovoked<br />
aggression against a very small number of people who have been<br />
under British protection, under British sovereignty for a very<br />
very long while. The European community and many others<br />
and Australia too, have roundly condemns what-Argentina has<br />
done. The Commonwealth Secretary General, Mr Ramphal has<br />
branded the Argentinians' actions as unprovoked aggression and </p>
<p>8-<br />
asked all Commonwealth countries to do what they can to assist.<br />
Now we intrcduced some economic measures at the request of the<br />
British, but there would no question of Australia going to<br />
war over this particular issue, and we are not bound by<br />
decisions of the United Kingdom. We make our own decisions<br />
completely. They understand that and that has been the case<br />
for a very long while, but I am sure that the United Kingdom<br />
would not be expecting Australia to join them in battle in<br />
this particu. lar conflict if it develops that way. Whatever<br />
support we can provide them morally and through some trade<br />
sanctions anid financial sanctions and these things have already<br />
been announced, of course we willido so. But it is the not the<br />
kind of circumstances in which I would expect to see Australians<br />
involved directly.<br />
Question We have news in brief in just a little under 1 minute from<br />
now,. so at this point there is not a great deal of point<br />
in taking another phone call, but I do hope that those<br />
listeners who are still trying to get through to us will<br />
continue to do so. The Prime Minister has agreed to be<br />
with us until 10.45. ( Break for news)<br />
Tweed Heads on the north coast of New South Wales, Mrs Dylan.<br />
Caller I would just like to ask you your reactionto The West<br />
German proposal f or their unemployment benefits. * I presume<br />
you are awa:-e of it. What the chances would be of the Senate<br />
accepting such a Bill in this country.<br />
Prime Minis-: er<br />
Are you talkinq about the proposal whereby they get paid a<br />
high percentage of their previous wage, but the longer they<br />
are unemployed the less they get paid.<br />
Caller No, not that one. They have four months in which to obtain<br />
a similar position that they previously held and after that<br />
time they must accept the direction of their CES or the<br />
equivalent, if not forfeit their rights to unemployment.<br />
Prime Minis ter the same<br />
In a sense we try to get at/ problem in a different way, because<br />
there is a work test. If somebody has become unemployed obviously<br />
they would try to get a similar job, but then if that is not<br />
available, tnder the work test that person must be prepared to<br />
accept other work for which he is reasonably suited. If there<br />
is work of that sort that is available to him, and is not prepared<br />
to take that job, then in those circumstances the person would<br />
also forfeit unemployment benefits. 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
CallerI Is that enforced in this country, So often, employers say they can't<br />
obtain staff, and there is a shortage of staff in various<br />
industries a~ nd we have this mounting unemployment problem.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There is a -very real problem in administering the work test,<br />
in many cases it is probably not applied as it is meant to be.<br />
There have ' been difficulties in this, because I have experience~ d<br />
this, many people have spoken to me about, just as you have.<br />
When there is a lot of unemployment around and people want to<br />
be able to employ somebody but find that they cannot get anyone<br />
to do the work, then it is frustrating and annoying and it<br />
does hold thie country back.<br />
Question Western Division of New South Wales, Mr Mitchell from Bourke.<br />
Caller As Chairman of the National Water Resources Association the<br />
question I wish to raise with you is the diversion of surplus<br />
waters from coastal rivers into the Darling-Murray River systems.<br />
As you know such diversions have been talked about for a long<br />
time, but now studies carried on with Federal and State<br />
Government funds have certainly proven their feasibility.<br />
The huge amounts of water that can be distributed would do such<br />
a lot for Southern Queensland, Western New South Wales and<br />
Northern Victoria and South Australia. Now the question I<br />
wish to ask you sir, how do you see the Federal Government's role<br />
in the future development of such massive construction projects<br />
and their imipact on the areas of work opportunities for young<br />
Australians and the resulting lift of the morale and future<br />
development of all Australia.<br />
Prime Minster<br />
The Federal Government does have a natural water resources program<br />
in which we provide funds to the states. Generally, the* projects<br />
that a selected are ones which the states themselves regard as<br />
the highest priority matters. That is an ongoing program which<br />
we pursue. The Minister for National Development has recently<br />
commissioned a study of Australia's water resource needs up to<br />
and beyond the year 2000. 1 would be disappointed if the kinds<br />
of matters which you have mentioned are not embraced and examined<br />
in that particular study. Australia is a dry continent and<br />
the conservation of water has always been a matter which Australians<br />
regard as of very real importance and there have been some great<br />
Australian conservation programs undertaken.* The management<br />
of the River Murray in the River Murray system with four Governments,<br />
the Commonwealth, Victoria, New South Wales and South<br />
Australia. That has been a land mark in water use in this country.<br />
The development of the Snowy Mountain Scheme was another. I<br />
certainly do not rule out proposals in this area in the 110 </p>
<p>years ahead, but I would like to get the results of the study<br />
which Senator Carrick has commissioned ancd which is now proceeding.<br />
Question Moving to Queensland and Goondiwindi, Mrs McLyremount.<br />
Caller I would like to talk about the price of farm fuel.<br />
Do you realise that farmers use as much fuel to produce a<br />
failed crop as they do to produce profitable ones. Do you<br />
think there is any possible way we could have the price reduced<br />
f or farm fuel?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Farm fuel is already free of the normal excise and we sought<br />
to help in that way. We also have the fuel freight equalisation<br />
program which is costing $ 120 million this year. This<br />
equalises to within very narrow margins the freight cost of<br />
getting fuel out to country and the remote parts of Australia.<br />
The other thing that helps of course, I know that farmers<br />
are using better and more efficient equipment than they have in<br />
the past, but for reasons that we all know, the price of fuel<br />
is a very substantial cost today. We have tried to help<br />
in the ways that I have mentioned. Farm fuel does not pay<br />
excise and the fuel equalisation program is also designed to<br />
keep down the cost to people in country areas.<br />
Question Thank you for your call. Now to the north coast of New South<br />
Wales, Mr Simson in Caranbah.<br />
Caller I'm calling about the home savings grant and I would like a<br />
policy change. In 1979 I purchased my home in the Entrance<br />
in New South Wales, Mr Cohen was our local Member and the value<br />
of the house was $ 42,000. Now it was just after the price<br />
escalation of the 1978-79 period. We were not eligible for<br />
the home savings grant because our house, or the price of<br />
our house was outside the limit of $ 40,000 for home savings<br />
grants when we had been saving for quite a few years. So I<br />
was hoping it would help pay solicitors.<br />
VPrime ? inifter<br />
Are you aware of the policy changes that we have introduced<br />
over the last week or so?<br />
Caller Not over the last week. </p>
<p>Prime Miniazer<br />
About a month ago.<br />
Caller Yes, I don ' t think that is backdated f rom the period<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well it could not be backdated. I suppose one of the unfortunate<br />
things is that there is always a cut of f time and a start time<br />
for new policies. But because we realised there were problems<br />
with the home savings grant and it was also being paid too late<br />
about nine months after the person has probably moved into the<br />
home, that is, why we altered the basis of it. The new proposals<br />
are helpful and much more constructive in assiting people into<br />
their homes. I am afraid there is nothing I can do about your<br />
case, I am sorry that you have missed out.<br />
Questi on<br />
Now, to Mt I: sa, Mr Simons.<br />
Caller I am a pay as you earn tax payer, and that means that I pay<br />
tax on my income as I get it. Then I claim back any rebate at<br />
the end of the financial year. Now I realise that tax is a<br />
necessary evil and I don't object to paying tax because it does<br />
help support: the Government etc. But what I do object to are<br />
these people who are evading and avoiding tax. Now isn't there<br />
some way that the Government can get the money out of them<br />
first, and then they can claim all their tax deductions and so<br />
on afterwards, the same way that I do. Once they have got<br />
the money then the Government can hand it back again like they<br />
do to everybody else, instead of not getting the money off them<br />
in the first place.<br />
Prime Minsiter<br />
one of the problems with tax avoidance is that if the Goverment<br />
knew that people had earned the money it would go into their<br />
assessments. But as I understand it, the more sophisticated<br />
tax evasion schemes are designed to hide the fact that people<br />
have had an income. I agree totally with your sentiments about<br />
it, but I would like to make the point that over the last three<br />
or four years we have legislated time and time again to stop<br />
tax evasion and whenever we get advice of a particular scheme<br />
that is unreasonable, we legislate. In addition to that, a<br />
new broad based section has been introduced into the Tax Act<br />
which is designed to give the TaxaNtion Commissioners much more<br />
power in preventing tax avoidance. The Government's campaign<br />
against tax avoidance will certainly continue and we have<br />
legislatedi on many occasions and if it necessary we will continue<br />
to do so. I think the people who participate in these sorts of<br />
schemes are just as anit-social, if not even more, than the<br />
predatory union activities which do so much damage through industrial<br />
/ 12 </p>
<p>-12-<br />
disruption. They both do just as much damage to the fabric<br />
of Australian society. I am with you totally with your sentiments,<br />
but the only way we can really fix the pr6blem is to legislate<br />
to put outside the law the activities that make it possible.<br />
Question To southern Queensland, Mrs Bella from Cabarlah.<br />
Caller A couple of questions on unemployment. The reason given for<br />
a lot of unemployment is married women working. The thing is<br />
that now with paying off a mortgage, a car and bringing up<br />
a family, it is just a necessity now for a woman to work when<br />
her husband is on the wage that my husband's on, which is nothing<br />
like the average wage of $ 300.00. Also I was thinking that<br />
you could make a tax rebate for the woman who wishes to stay<br />
at home rather than be in the workforce.<br />
Prime Minister many<br />
I know quite well that/ married women do work because they<br />
believe it is necessary for them to contribute to their<br />
family living standard. This is a fact of life and<br />
whatever views a person might individually have about<br />
two income families, or single income families, this is a<br />
choice that individuals or families have to make for themselves.<br />
I agree with you though that the idea of a tax rebate to<br />
encourage mothers to stay at home is good, and there is in fact<br />
a spouse rebate, which we more than doubled over the last few<br />
years, and it is quite a generous rebate which goes to single<br />
income families to make it easier for a mother to stay at home<br />
if that is what she wants to do and feels she is able to do.<br />
When we are looking at changes in tax laws, we obviously look<br />
at the position of single income families and the allowances<br />
that have been made available in that area has increased much<br />
more than other allowances for the very reason that you have<br />
mentioned. TAPE TURNED OVER/ 13 </p>

Prime Minister: ( cont.)<br />
enough money but I would love you to have a better pair of<br />
headphones the next time around.<br />
Question: Perish the thought sir. Look to give our technicians a chance<br />
to perhaps have a look at those headphones, for a couple of,<br />
moments, we have a report in from Antarctica, so we will delay<br />
the calls for the next two minutes.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Fine. Question: The eyes of the world are focussed on the Falkland Islands<br />
and the attempts at shuttle diplomacy Secretary of State<br />
Alexander Haig. Meanwhile, reports in the United States<br />
suggest the Argentinian invasion of the Falkland Islands<br />
may simply be a staging post to either richer pickings in<br />
Antarctica : later on. ( Report) Prime Minister, I believe<br />
you are hearing a little more easily now?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I can hear beautifully now, thank you very much.<br />
Question: That is marvellous. We will resume our calls. Speaking with<br />
Mr John fromn Barellan in the Riverina district of New South<br />
Wales. Caller:: Good morning Mr Fraser. Can you hear me quite alright?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Yes, I can hiear you well, thank you.<br />
Caller Mr Fraser, I believe that a nation is only as strong as its<br />
family unit, and that the family unit is only as strong as<br />
that which it might believe. And the question I would like<br />
to ask you as you and your family are probably the leading<br />
family in the nation, and I hope you don't consider it<br />
embarrassing or impertinent, but I would like to know sir<br />
if you are a Christian?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Yes. I agree with you. I think a nation is as strong as<br />
the family is, and I think it is the most important it<br />
is a cold word, but the most important unit in society.<br />
Ireally do. The basis of so much that we do and so much<br />
that we believe in is in fact based on the family. -A4 </p>
<p>14<br />
Question: Thank you very much for your call, Mr John. Now to Tamworth<br />
in northern New South Wales. Mr Bourke, you are now through<br />
to Mr Fraser.<br />
Caller: Good morning, Mr Fraser.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Good morning.<br />
Caller: Mr Fraser, could you expand to me in broad why governments<br />
spend so much money on tertiary education, educating our<br />
young people to do jobs which obviously are not available<br />
to the majority of them, and why our government doesn't spend<br />
moreof this money in creating jobs?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
A large part of tertiary education is of course very necessary<br />
and I do believe that there ought to be access to higher education<br />
for as many Australians as possible, but over the last 15 or<br />
years, I agree with you, I think people had come to believe<br />
that tertiary education was going to provide the answers to<br />
everyone's futures, and that certainly isn't so. There are<br />
a lot of Australians, either by inclination or by talent,<br />
don't want cr aren't suited to university type education,<br />
but might have a very great talent for vocational training<br />
of different kinds or technical training, and in the last<br />
half dozen years, we have increased the sums available for<br />
technical and vocational training enormously. We have also<br />
increased the sums for training programmes and something<br />
over 200,000, 220,000 to 230,000 Australians, and many of<br />
them young Australians get assisted througrh these various<br />
technical vccational training programmes each year. And<br />
at the same time of course, the money that has been spent<br />
on university education has been held fairly tightly in<br />
real terms. So the problem that you have drawn attention<br />
to, I think, the Government has recognised, and I also<br />
believe that we have taken substantial actions along the lines<br />
that we have approved because we are diverting resources into<br />
technical and further education which gives people a practical<br />
training and that of course is essential if they are to get<br />
jobs in today's world.<br />
Question: Thank you very much indeed for your call, Mr Bourke from<br />
Tamworth. Now, moving to southern New South Wales and Cooma.<br />
Mrs Tozer, do you have a question for the Prime Minister?<br />
Caller: Yes. Good morning Prime Minister. I am ringing you on the subject<br />
of the annual seal hunt in Canada, and I would like to know what<br />
stand the Australian Government takes on this disgusting hunt,<br />
and if you are planning any legislation banning seal products<br />
from this country. </p>
<p>15<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I have seen some of the pictures of the seal hunts onielevision<br />
and I agree with the kind of terms that you have used. We have<br />
made our views known to Canada. They of couirse make decisions<br />
in relation 1to this, and it is in a sense, unlike the problems<br />
of whaling where there was an international organisation and<br />
where we were able to ban Australian whaling and have been<br />
able to argue in an international forum to end that trade.<br />
The seal hunt: is in the province of one country and for the<br />
decisions of one country. I am told that there are virtually<br />
no products t: hat come into Australia made out of seals, but<br />
nevertheless, we are looking at the question as to whether<br />
or not we shouldn't even so, ban any products made out of seals<br />
or seal fur. I think the ban would be more symbolic than real<br />
simply because on the advice available to me, there are virtually<br />
no products -that come into the country anyway.<br />
Question:<br />
Mrs Tozer, thank you for your call. Still in southern New South<br />
Wales, Mrs Duel in Albury, you are now through to the Prime Min.-ister.<br />
Caller: Good morning Mr Prime Minister.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Good morning.<br />
Caller: For a long time I have been rather concerned about the standard<br />
of Australian speech. And it is not getting better, it is<br />
getting rather worse, actually.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
About the what of Australian speech?<br />
Caller: The standard of Australian speech. Can you hear me very well.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Yes. Caller: Now, is there something we can do about this by introducing<br />
it into the schools particularly and having teachers forced<br />
to learn speech during their programmes, instead of just<br />
minutes that they are doing now, or having-specialist<br />
teachers go into the schools every week, and also including<br />
it as a subject as music is, in the AMEB curriculum, as an<br />
accepted Higher School Certificate subject. ./ 16 </p>
<p>16<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
This of course would be a matter for the schools and the<br />
curriculum for most of the schools is a matter for State<br />
Governments. I am not saying that to duckshove the issue,<br />
I am-just stating the fact. I would agree with you that the<br />
capacity to express your views and to do it reasonably well<br />
is very important and I think this is one of the things that<br />
has been neglected in Australian education. But I also believe<br />
that over the last two or three years there has been some very<br />
hard questioning of the basis of education in Australian<br />
schools. People are and I mentioned this earlier this<br />
morning are now realising that schools have a much greater<br />
responsibiliLty than to teach an academic training to those<br />
who are academically inclined. I think secondary schools have<br />
an absolute obligation to find something that every student<br />
not only can but wants to do well, and if the school can't<br />
succeed in -that, then they are very much failing the student.<br />
Ending up, wahen people leave school, being able to speak<br />
well, with -a good standard of speech, I also think'is a<br />
very important obligation on the whole school system.<br />
Now, how that is done is open to the schools themselves,<br />
but in a nunber of States, local parents bodies are having<br />
a greater and greater impact on the curriculum that is taught<br />
in schools and whether that occurs in your own district or<br />
not I wouldn't know, but if it does, it is one avenue of<br />
being able to influence what is taught in the schools.<br />
Question: Mrs Duel in Albury, thank you very much indeed for your<br />
call. Prime Minister, we are certainly getting a variety<br />
of matters being raised.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Yes, we arE!. I think that is good.<br />
Question: Fine. Well we will find out now, moving to Mt Isa,<br />
what Mrs Fl~ orence, would like to speak with you about.<br />
Caller: Good morning Prime Minister.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Good morning, Mrs Florence.<br />
Caller: I would like to know if the ABC could have licences brought<br />
back, and Ehereby give country people a better variety of<br />
programmes and the city ones able to compete with the<br />
independent television. / 17 </p>
<p>17<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Are you saying you want everyone to have to pay for a licence<br />
so the ABC would have more money, is that it?<br />
Caller: Yes. I have! no objections.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well there was some thought of that years ago and there<br />
was a great deal of objection. The ABC is encouraged to<br />
compete. You may not know that some years ago we made a<br />
decision that would enable the ABC to keep the benefits,<br />
the profits of programmes that they might sell to encourage<br />
the creative talent within the ABC. I don't know to what<br />
extent they have taken advantage of that, and we have also<br />
of course recently had a report on the structure of the ABC<br />
and that has become known as the Dix Report, and the Government:<br />
will very shortly be able to make its decisions in relation<br />
to that. If you are after a vigorous, vital interesting ABC,<br />
I would agree with you totally. It is a great challenge.<br />
I think it is sometimes met, and sometimes not met, but<br />
I hope that with the changes that will come as a result<br />
of the Dix enquiry and report that the ABC will in part<br />
be revitalised. I don't think it is only a question of<br />
money. I think it is also a question of structure and<br />
attitudes, and there are many dedicated people in the<br />
ABC, but sometimes I think they could be given more encouragement.<br />
Question: Mrs Florence, thank you very much for your call.<br />
From Cobar in north western New South Wales, Mr Arnold.<br />
What do you. have to say to the Prime Minister?<br />
Caller: Good mornirng Prime Minister.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Good morning Mr Arnold.<br />
Caller: Hello, you have faded out now.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well I just said good morning. Yes, I am listening. I can hear you.<br />
Caller:<br />
Well I thin2k you are very brave to come on a programme<br />
like this where you get a broad spectrum of questions thrown<br />
at you, and I have got. a fairly broad spectrum of questions<br />
here myself. I was in the Liberal Party for six years. I am<br />
not especially proud of that, but even then it was relatively<br />
difficult to get near a Prime Minister, so I think this sort<br />
of a radio programme serves a very real purpose. </p>
<p>18<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I would agree: with you on that. It does enable you to have a<br />
direct contact with quite a large number of people and . it<br />
enables me tco know what is upper most in their minds, what is<br />
concerning them most.<br />
Caller: I have some suggestions in that regard, but anyway, to get<br />
straight on with what I wanted to ask you about, there are<br />
three main questions and then a comment. Concerning our defence<br />
which, in my estimation at least, is in a fairly deplorable<br />
state. I undErstand we are to have 25 Leopard tanks in the<br />
long term whEtn we eventually get them all and I suppose it<br />
is worth commienting in passing that when Russia started<br />
its war with Germany, in the Second World War, they were<br />
ill prepared for war, but in those first three months<br />
of that war, they lost 2,000 tanks. So, our 25 Leopards<br />
when they arE! eventually here and they are all stationed<br />
in Melbourne,. I don't think they will do us a whole lot of<br />
good. And my suggestion in this regard is that the large<br />
Massey Ferguson tractor plant at Sunshine in Victoria<br />
where it had just had the drawings changed in the drawing<br />
offi ce, it then becomes a tank plant. I don't know if you<br />
are aware of that engineering fact. And then to move on to<br />
Question: Could the Prime Minister answer that first of all, Mr Arnold.<br />
We are running out of time, and we still have several calls.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think we have got a few more than 25 Leopard tanks, but<br />
the main basis of Australian defence is to have a thoroughly<br />
balanced force, and we need a modern, efficient hard hitting<br />
airforce, navy and the army of course, needs to keep up its<br />
skills with modern weaponry. We are in the middle of a<br />
re-equipment programme which is costing many billions<br />
of dollars which is going to see the introduction of one<br />
of the world's best aircraft into our own airforce, which<br />
is seeing the upgrading of the skills at sea and the capacities<br />
at sea in matritime reconnaissance, and in addition to that,<br />
of course, thJ-e army reserve or the CMF as it used to be called<br />
has been very greatly expanded over the last couple of years.<br />
The target levels were reached on time. So, I think overall<br />
we have got a better sense of defence preparedness than<br />
maybe we have ever had in peace time. I know you can make<br />
comments about one particular aspect of weaponry and tanks<br />
but you have got to make a judgment about the state of the<br />
art that needs to be kept alive in the defence forces but<br />
also you have got to make a judgment about the kind of<br />
conflicts that Australia could be involved in, and the<br />
kind of weapons therefore, that we need in our forces for<br />
the protection of Australia to enable us to contribute in<br />
any conflict where Australia might be involved. Overall,<br />
I believe we have a balanced force that is capable of operating<br />
by itself or with allies. ./ 19 </p>
<p>19<br />
Question: Thank you for raising that question on defence, Mr Arnold<br />
of Cobar. Now, to far north Queensland andCairns. Mr Cabrer<br />
you are now through to the Prime Minister.<br />
Caller: Good morning Mr Fraser.<br />
Prime Minist~ er:<br />
Good morning Mr Cabrer.<br />
Caller: Mr Fraser, a commodity that Australia is importing increasing<br />
amounts of is timber, along with the, I suppose, the rest of<br />
the world. ' I have in front of me a statement which says<br />
since 1950, the world has lost half of its trees, and that<br />
in about 20 years, half of the remainder will be gone.<br />
Now, apropos of that, there is a determinedi result being made<br />
in north Queensland on the last remnants of land forests<br />
probably in a desperate attempt to sustain the * industry.<br />
But it seems to me that this is just very shortsighted policy.<br />
There is probably far more money to be made in tourism<br />
in keeping those remnants in perpetuity because in 20 to<br />
years there won't be any accessible land forests left in<br />
the world. My question is, can your government do anything<br />
about the institution of large scale forestation and reforestation<br />
on a nationwide scale and secondly, protect these remaining<br />
remnants both in north Queensland and I believe there were<br />
some in New South Wales.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well I would have no quarrel with the objectives you have<br />
got at all. Preseveration of Queensland rain forests is<br />
very, very important, and I would be very disappointed<br />
if the QueEnsland government were not to take actions that<br />
would enable those rain forests to be preserved. Having<br />
adequate supplies of timber for the future is also very<br />
important and most State Governments now have rules so<br />
that if people are milling for timber and clearing timber<br />
they also [ ave enter into replarting programmes to make sure<br />
the future is looked after. And indeed, the reputable timber<br />
companies I think do look to the future. It is not just<br />
a question o~ f cutting out a forest and leaving it, moving on<br />
somewhere Clse. The reputable firms are on a long term basis<br />
and they know they need stocks of timber not just for this<br />
year or five years time but 20, 25, 30 years time, and that<br />
won't occur if they don't undertake adequate plantings.<br />
In some areas in the last few years there has been an interesting<br />
innovation because there have been large scale replantings<br />
of native Australian timber of eucalypts where in the past<br />
the replanltings were certainly restricted to pines or timber<br />
of that kind. I would have thought that under the rules that<br />
State Governments have established, that the sorts of things<br />
that you are concerned about are basically being looked after,<br />
certainly in a number of Stat~ sthey are. </p>
<p>20<br />
Question: Now we go to Alice Springs in the Northern Territory.<br />
Mrs Cassells,. you are now through to Mr Fraser.<br />
Caller: Thank you. Good morning.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Good morning Mrs Cassells.<br />
Caller: One is a plea Mr Fraser to please try to keep Australia<br />
intact for -the coming generation. I know it is very difficult<br />
when you have got State Governments to deal with, but the<br />
Tasmanian situation is one instance. I won't go into that,<br />
you probably know more about it than I do. The other my<br />
main question is, could some investigation be done into<br />
superannuation. Why isn't it transferable, from Commonwealth<br />
to States, States to Commonwealth and private industry.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Some superannuation schemes are transferable. There have<br />
been examinations about the portability of superannuation<br />
pensions in the past, and some progress has been made, but<br />
not complete. Have you got a particular circumstance or a<br />
particular case in mind?<br />
Caller: Yes I have, my husband. I guess I cannot take up too much<br />
of your time.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
If you like, what you could do is to give your details to<br />
the ABC over the telephone rather than over the airwaves<br />
and I could look into that for you.<br />
Question: Mrs Cassells, we will take your call back to the switchboard.<br />
And we have another call from the Northern Territory.<br />
This time, Diarwin. Mr Mason, you are now through to the Prime MInister<br />
Caller: Good mornincr Prime Minister.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Good morning to you.<br />
Caller: Can you hear me? ./ 21 </p>
<p>21-<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Yes very well.<br />
Caller: You are very faint, but I can just about hear you.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, we liken Darwin and the Northern Tertitory<br />
to be very, -very similar inaudible.. to the Falkland I ' slands<br />
with the lack of defence up here in the territory. We have<br />
very very little at the moment. Eventually it is going<br />
to have a fighter squadron. We do have inaudible... the<br />
CMF as it used to be called, well they are very, very good<br />
but they are very, very small. Now, we could be in exactly<br />
the same position as the Falkland Islands.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well I don't think so because<br />
Caller: or not, we people in the territory do think so.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, if I could make a comment or two about that.<br />
The Falklandi Islands are a very, very long way, about<br />
8,000 or 9,000 miles from the United Kingdom. They are<br />
remote froma the main centres of British power and influence<br />
and they are obviously close to other countries where the<br />
lines of communication are very short. Now, the Northern<br />
Territory is1 all part of one island continent, and the<br />
Australian defence effort is based to make sure that vie<br />
secure the protection of Australia against any possible<br />
threats and it is not just a questionof the defence force<br />
that might be in the Northern Territory, it is our capacity<br />
to move defence forces anywhere within Australia or beyond<br />
if that is necessary in Australia's interests. And if there<br />
was a threat to Darwin or to the Northern Territory, obviously<br />
the totality of Australia's defence effort, wherever people<br />
are headquartered or wherever they have their barracks,<br />
would be available for the defence of each and every part<br />
of Australia, whether it is Darwin or Sydney or Broom or<br />
whatever. I can understand that there can be a feeling<br />
of isolaticn but really in military terms, the situations<br />
are not the same, they really aren'It.<br />
Question: Prime Minister we have about three minutes left in the<br />
programme, so I will try and get one more call in, if you<br />
agree. And from Coffs Harbour on the north coast, Mrs Grime.<br />
We are very short of time, Mrs Grime, could you please make<br />
your questf-on very brief.<br />
Caller: Good morning Mr Fraser.<br />
Prime Mini: 3ter:<br />
Good morni. ag Mrs Grime. </p>
<p>22<br />
Caller: My question is regarding the TEAS. Is there any possibility<br />
of the TEAS levels being raised for students in the next budget<br />
or raising the amount that they can earn before they can lose<br />
some of their TEAS. I am the mother of a country student that<br />
cannot live at home, and I would like tosee-these young<br />
people are our future as well as the tertiary eduation peopleand<br />
if feel that young people on the dole get more money<br />
but they will repay it when they do get work in the workforce.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
All I can say is that the TEAS matters, whether it is the allowance<br />
or the capacity to earn outside income will be looked at in the<br />
next budget. We have made adjustments from time to time and<br />
the TEAS doe: 5 come up for review in each budget discussion,<br />
so it will be before us.<br />
Question: Thank YOU vetry much, Mrs Grime, and thank you also Prime Minister<br />
for sparing the time from your very busy schedule to take part<br />
in this talk: back programme in Morning Extra today. I am sure<br />
so many people have appreciated being able to speak with you.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well thank you very much and I have enjoyed speaking with you<br />
on the programme and enjoyed listening to the questions and<br />
responding t: o those questions. So thank you.<br />
Question: As you would understand, there have been so many people<br />
who have not been able to get Ibrough to us today, so I am<br />
wondering iE perhaps in the future when time permits, would<br />
you join us again?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Yes, certainly. I will take out a monopoly on the ABC if you like,<br />
then I can answer all the questions.<br />
Question: And perhaps get some nice earphones?<br />
Prime Minis-ter:<br />
Well they are working much better now. I think some else was<br />
wrong but the earphones seem to be alright.<br />
Question: Well I am &amp; elighted to hear that. But thank you again for your time. </p>
