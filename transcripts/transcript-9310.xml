SPEECH OPENING OF THE ROYAL PERTH HOSPITAL NEW WORK -A<br />
OPPORTUNITY Ladies and gentlemen. I must say its nice to be in a hospital to talk to<br />
healthy people: people here because they are being armed against the ills of<br />
unemployment I am especially delighted to see trainees from the Royal Perth<br />
Hospital Youth Program and from the hospital's Jobskills intake in the guest<br />
list. Today we are here to launch Western Australia's first New Work<br />
Opportunity. In so doing I'd like to reflect on what the White Paper on Employment and<br />
Growth means for the unemployed, for employers, and for the community in<br />
general. Working Nation was released some months ago, yet the press, employers,<br />
and the public have not yet realised the full significance of the White Paper.<br />
The extent of the Government's commitment, and what it means for the<br />
unemployed, has yet to be brought home.<br />
The Job Compact creates for the first time a definite end to the<br />
unemployment experience of individuals. This is a significant extension of<br />
the social safety net for unemployed people.<br />
By giving the long term unemployed a job, through either New Work<br />
Opportunities, Jobstart, or the training wage, we are saying that we will not<br />
let the unemployed stay in unemployment indefinitely.<br />
We will help you. The job offer, the central component of the Job Compact,<br />
will replace drifting and lack of motivation with hope and a real chance of<br />
finding permanent work.<br />
This is not something that has happened before.<br />
Solving unemployment is not easy. While most Job Compact jobs will be in<br />
the private sector, we will not be able to place all Job Compact clients with<br />
private employers. </p>
<p>New Work Opportunities provide the chance for local communities to develop<br />
solutions to their regional development and employment problems.<br />
New Work Opportunities are designed to provide work and training to<br />
unemployed people placed on them and to produce social benefits as well as<br />
growth in local communities.<br />
New Work Opportunities are one element of the 160,000 jobs that will be<br />
provided to long term unemployed people under the Job Compact each year.<br />
Working Nation will ensure that the unemployed share in the economic<br />
recovery, The Green Paper Restoring Full Emnployment noted that some 80 per cent<br />
of all long term unemployed people who obtained full time jobs in 1992 did<br />
so through their participation in labour market programs.<br />
This tells us a lot.<br />
If long term unemployed people are going to share in the economic recovery<br />
and find jobs then they need active assistance to do so. This is the basis of<br />
Working Nation.<br />
In keeping with our election promise to not turn our backs on the<br />
unemployed, there will be some 645,000 labour market and entry level<br />
training commencements a year by 1995-96.<br />
Over a four year period from 4 July 1994, we will spend a total of $ 10.3<br />
billion on employment and training initiatives. This represents an enormous<br />
extension of training positions and active labour market assistance.<br />
Government commitment and money, however, is not enough.<br />
To achieve the White Paper objectives we need the commitment of the<br />
community, unions, and employers.<br />
Royal Perth Hosvital<br />
The Royal Perth Hospital's commitment to the unemployed is a tremendous<br />
example for employers. </p>
<p>The Now Work Opportunity is only the latest in a series of employment and<br />
training projects at the Royal Perth Hospital.<br />
It follows the success of the Royal Perth Hospital Youth Program. The youth<br />
program initiative was funded by the hospital. Through it, 20 long term<br />
jobless young people got a foot on the employment ladder.<br />
Most of these young people went on to find permanent employment or to<br />
enrol in full-time study.<br />
This year alone, the hospital has provided 10 unemployed people with<br />
Jobskills, placements. Five of these participants have remained with the<br />
hospital. Royal Perth Hospital has found what many employers find when they hire<br />
long term unemployed: contrary to the myth, the long term unemployed<br />
have a lot to offer to employers.<br />
Of course, we do not expect people who have been unemployed for a long<br />
time to walk straight into a job without any help to make the transition.<br />
We know that long term unemployment affects motivation and health and the<br />
ability to cope with the demands of employment.<br />
Case management will ensure that unemployed people are able to make the<br />
transition from unemployment to work mrid be aii a~ jet to their employer.<br />
Job Compact clients will receive one-to-one assistance with training and<br />
other pre-employment needs prior to placement in a job.<br />
Since case management of Newstart clients began in March this year, over<br />
65,000 unemployed people have entered case management. Success stories<br />
are already emerging. People that have been unemployed for periods of<br />
three, five, and ten years, have been gaining full time employment.<br />
Employers should keep in mind that long term unemployed people they take<br />
on under the Job Compact will be provided with support by case<br />
management before, during, and after their placement.<br />
We are also going to enlist the help of private sector, community, and<br />
industry case managers who know industry and understand unemployed<br />
people. </p>
<p>The RPH New Work Oogortunity<br />
The New Work Opportunity we are launching today will provide placements<br />
for 100 Job Compact clients over a one year period. That is 100 people who<br />
have been unemployed for over 18 months will receive a job and training for<br />
a period of six months under this project.<br />
The positions will be new job opportunities and will focus on employment and<br />
training, both on and off the job, in a range of occupations.<br />
Positions will be filled as; laboratory assistants; pharmacy assistants;<br />
orderlies; clerical and medical records management assistants; and in stores;<br />
sterilisation and autoclaving9; patient care; and landscape gardening.<br />
Clients participating in the program will be able to apply for permanent<br />
employment at the hospital as positions become available.<br />
And they will receive job search assistance at the conclusion of their New<br />
Work Opportunity placement.<br />
New Work Opportunftie8 Else1where in Australia<br />
The Royal Perth Hospital project is the first New Work Opportunity in<br />
Western Australia. It will be the first of many.<br />
In New South Wales two New Work Opportunity projects have already<br />
begun.<br />
The Parkes and Forbes projects involve the creation of major tourist facilities.<br />
The Parkes project will provide employment opportunities by the creation of<br />
Memorial Gardens to commemorate Australian soldiers who have served<br />
overseas. The Memorial Gardens will be based on overseas battlegrounds and will link<br />
in with other tourist attractions in the area such as the Cowra Japanese<br />
Gardens and the Botanical Gardens in Orange.<br />
The Forbes Local Council will build on the town's profile as Australia's tidiest<br />
town to attract a larger proportion of tourists arnd travellers in the area. </p>
<p>Other New Work Opportunities in the pipeline include bush tucker farms and<br />
processing plants in outback NSW; landscaping and re-planting of industrial<br />
sites; and expansion of home-based care to people in need.<br />
New Work Opportunities will be concentrated in the growth areas of<br />
environmental repair, eco-tourism, and community services.<br />
Area Consultative Committees are being set up around Australia to align with<br />
local government areas and natural labour markets.<br />
A major aim of Area Consultative Committees is to devolve some ot the<br />
responsibility for DEET programs and services to the regional level. As they<br />
are established they will provide the means for local communities to<br />
participate in the development and selection of New Work Opportunities in<br />
their region.<br />
In short, New Work Opportunities provide a a chance for innovative<br />
approaches towards regional unemployment to be explored. And they<br />
provide local people with the chance to choose, develop, and manage the<br />
project. Conclus2fn So may I encourage everyone, especially employers, to respond to the<br />
Government's challenge in the spirit of the Royal Perth Hospital to start<br />
thinking about how they can help unemployed people in their local region.<br />
There is so much work to be done: we have the workers, we are providing<br />
the funds. All we need now is your commitment and imagination.<br />
I wish the Royal Perth Hospital and the Centrecare SkillShare every success<br />
with this project. </p>
