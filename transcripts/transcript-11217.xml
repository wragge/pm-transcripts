<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>On the line in our Canberra studio, facing an extraordinarily busy</p>
<p> day, the Prime Minister, Mr John Howard. Good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hello, Neil. I'm very pleased to hear what you're going</p>
<p> to do over the next couple of weeks. I wish you luck. I think it's</p>
<p> probably the best demonstration of the journalistic professionalism</p>
<p> that you should be doing something like that. I think many Australian</p>
<p> journalists in both the print and the electronic media are doing an</p>
<p> outstanding job at the present time with the reports they're</p>
<p> sending back from the border that I wanted to take the opportunity</p>
<p> occasioned by what you said of expressing my admiration for the work</p>
<p> that those journalists are doing. It's not easy. It's dangerous.</p>
<p> But they're there and they're there in large numbers. And</p>
<p> they're bringing to Australian viewers Australian reports of</p>
<p> these disastrous events so that we don't have to rely exclusively</p>
<p> on American or British television and radio people, although they're</p>
<p> doing a very good job too but I think it's always good to have</p>
<p> our own reporters on the ground.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well yes, I agree. There are dozens of Australian aid workers in this</p>
<p> area too. I mean, two of them are still missing.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I'm meeting at least five of the aid workers from Skopje with</p>
<p> a bit of luck. Is there any message I should take?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, yes. I want to say that all of the Australian people respect</p>
<p> very much what they're doing. It's difficult, distressing,</p>
<p> dangerous work. For people to put their lives on the line, which clearly</p>
<p> is involved here, to help suffering humanity is a great thing to do.</p>
<p> And they have the respect and the admiration of the people of Australia</p>
<p> for the work that they're doing and I'm very proud of them</p>
<p> and I know that all Australians are very proud of the humanitarian</p>
<p> task that they're undertaking.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do we know yet when the refugees will arrive in this country?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The latest information I had a few moments ago when I spoke to the</p>
<p> Immigration Minister was possibly as early as late next week. Philip</p>
<p> Ruddock will be making a detailed statement around midday today and</p>
<p> I'll be briefing the Premiers on the arrangements. But they have</p>
<p> been fairly carefully prepared now. The people will all come in to</p>
<p> a reception area probably near Holsworthy in Sydney and then they</p>
<p> will be distributed to different parts of Australia. There will be</p>
<p> clearance procedures and health checks carried out at their point</p>
<p> of first arrival. And we have been able to secure arrangements in</p>
<p> a variety of facilities and there aren't any that can be categorised</p>
<p> as completely remote. Some are a little further from population centres</p>
<p> than others but by and large any reasonable person will be very satisfied</p>
<p> with the arrangements that have been made. And I want to thank the</p>
<p> Immigration Department. I want to thank the Defence Force. I want</p>
<p> to thank the people in Emergency Australia. And I want to thank Philip</p>
<p> Ruddock for the speedy way in which they've reacted. I mean,</p>
<p> remember it was only last Monday morning that the world first got</p>
<p> word that NATO countries were going to take refugees and here I am,</p>
<p> as Prime Minister of Australia, talking on Friday morning about the</p>
<p> likelihood of the first batch arriving late next week. Now, that's</p>
<p> not bad. And I thank all of those people who have been responsible</p>
<p> for organising the Australian response once the Government's</p>
<p> decision to take 4,000 people was made.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Will they be cut in all States, I mean, is there likely to be some</p>
<p> in Victoria as well?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes, yes. There will be some in Victoria. There will be some in</p>
<p> Tasmania. I think there will be people going to all States. I had</p>
<p> the list read to me very quickly this morning and my recollection</p>
<p> is certainly there are some in Victoria, yes.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The reports today Â this could cost the Australian people $15</p>
<p> million. Do you know what it will cost?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>At the moment no. It will obviously cost us some money. The airlift</p>
<p> alone, if you bring out 4,000, you're looking at $4 million to</p>
<p> $5 million and then you're looking at accommodation, food, basic</p>
<p> medical, other necessities of life. So you are looking at a significant</p>
<p> amount of money. And, of course, over and above that we are giving</p>
<p> $6 million in aid to various organisations including CARE, the organisation</p>
<p> you mentioned a moment ago. It's not a small amount but it's</p>
<p> justified. It's a huge tragedy and a country like Australia must</p>
<p> be warm-hearted and must be generous and we are both.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We still don't know what's going to happen, do we? Three</p>
<p> months time, they might have to stay on. We just don't know.</p>
<p> This looks like being a long war.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It could be, Neil. You're right. I don't know where it's</p>
<p> going to end. I'd be less than frank with the Australian people</p>
<p> if I pretended that I did. What I say to them is that we want to provide</p>
<p> these people with a safe haven and protection and as much security</p>
<p> as we can give until we see how things unfold. We don't want</p>
<p> them to be given permanent residence. We want them to be here on a</p>
<p> temporary visa basis because the idea and the hope is that they will</p>
<p> ultimately return to their own homes in Kosovo. Now, we don't</p>
<p> know how the military engagement is going to unfold. It's very</p>
<p> hard for me to predict and I don't think President Clinton knows.</p>
<p> I don't think the other NATO heads of government know. But in</p>
<p> the meantime we can play our part, although we are a long way away</p>
<p> and we're not part of NATO but we are a nation that has always</p>
<p> been open-hearted to people who've been expelled from their own</p>
<p> homelands. And, once again, the Australian tradition of helping people</p>
<p> in those circumstances has asserted itself.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is there a possibility that some will have to be offered permanent</p>
<p> residence, for example, we could have children born here in that time?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Neil, I can understand that question being asked. All I would be doing</p>
<p> if I responded would be to be speculating. At the moment we're</p>
<p> saying for an initial period of three months. Those visas, special</p>
<p> visas, are obviously renewable at the instance of the Minister, we</p>
<p> are clearly not going to push people out into the sea. You can understand</p>
<p> that. We're not going to treat them other than humanely and compassionately</p>
<p> but I don't want to be speculating about any lengths of extensions</p>
<p> after three months. We have a diplomatic position to maintain as well</p>
<p> as political support for what NATO is doing and we want to maintain</p>
<p> the maximum pressure that we can and the NATO countries can on Milosevic.</p>
<p> And if you start signalling, at this point, that you might do this</p>
<p> or do that you weaken the pressure that is being maintained on him.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you recall from what you've been told where in Victoria the</p>
<p> refugees will be housed?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think Point Cook was a name that was mentioned but there were</p>
<p> a number of names mentioned and I think it might be better if I leave</p>
<p> that to Philip Ruddock to announce further.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is it correct that Australia has privately criticised the NATO action</p>
<p> with the United States, raised some objections with the United States?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, not criticised. No no. I'm certainly not aware of that.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Has it been raised privately?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I've not have any personal discussions with the President,</p>
<p> and I'm not aware of any personal exchanges. Bear in mind that</p>
<p> we have not been asked to provide any military assistance, and we're</p>
<p> not providing and military assistance. This is a NATO action and Australia</p>
<p> is not part of NATO. It's a NATO responsibility. So the question</p>
<p> of military involvement has not arisen.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>While the focus is on the Balkans, we must be increasingly uneasy</p>
<p> about Timor. We've got claims of a massacre, Dili as many as,</p>
<p> well the estimates are 5...between 5 and 25 perhaps more people</p>
<p> massacred. Are you becoming concerned, more concerned about East Timor?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I've been concerned about East Timor now for quite a long time,</p>
<p> and you'll remember that before Christmas we urged the Indonesian</p>
<p> Government to change its policy and we think those urgings had an</p>
<p> impact. It's a difficult situation. We need the involvement of</p>
<p> Indonesia, we need the involvement of the United Nations, we need</p>
<p> the involvement of Portugal in a peaceful transition either to autonomy,</p>
<p> ultimately leading to independence or to independence first up. But</p>
<p> the tensions inside Timor are great and it is disturbing. That is</p>
<p> why I'm not making any general in-principle commitments of Australian</p>
<p> involvement. I will never agree to a situation where Australian people,</p>
<p> personnel, military or otherwise, are exposed to unreasonable levels</p>
<p> of danger. But clearly Australia has a big role to play in Timor and</p>
<p> the rest of the world will look to Australia to discharge its responsibility.</p>
<p> But equally we would expect if a number of nations have got to be</p>
<p> involved in some kind of transitional arrangement we would hope that</p>
<p> there'd be assistance forthcoming from some of the countries</p>
<p> in Europe other than Portugal.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, you've got the Premiers' Conference today, and</p>
<p> various things there. The GST, now the argument being put, and I know</p>
<p> by Treasury officials it seems, and the modelling, that pensioners</p>
<p> will not be protected from the effect of the GST. As I said there's</p>
<p> a simple way of addressing this. Do you stand by the guarantee nobody</p>
<p> will be worse off other than tax cheats.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The guarantee I gave stands completely. See what we said about pensioners</p>
<p> was that they would always be 1.5% better off than the ordinary cost</p>
<p> of living adjustments. Now that remains. Nothing that was said yesterday</p>
<p> alters that in any way. Nothing at all.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But if there are price rises and not wage rises surely it catches</p>
<p> up with them. That seems to be the modelling argument....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well if over time you have a situation where because of wage rises</p>
<p> being greater than price rises pensioners are even better off. They</p>
<p> have even higher pensions. Well that doesn't in any way undercut</p>
<p> the promise that we made that they would always be at least the CPI</p>
<p> plus 1.5%.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well what about a erosion? I mean there is the possibility of erosion</p>
<p> as your very own modelling points out.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that won't erode. I mean the pension....the CPI increases</p>
<p> plus 1.5% will not erode, will not erode. And nothing that was said</p>
<p> yesterday suggested that. It didn't suggest it all. And there</p>
<p> was nothing particularly new about what was said yesterday.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But the way I read it and the way I've read is that it is not</p>
<p> that. The way I read it is that the modelling shows that the modelling</p>
<p> show the possibility of the erosion of the 1.5%. So in fact [inaudible]</p>
<p> so pensioners lose their benefit.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the only way your 1.5% can erode is if in some way over a period</p>
<p> of time the 1.5% becomes 1.25% or 1% or 0.5%. Well that's not</p>
<p> going to happen because it will be legislated and we have said all</p>
<p> along that that will be the case.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay. So as I say the simple bottom line....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The guarantee that I gave, the promise that I made to pensioners in</p>
<p> the election campaign was that your pension would always be CPI plus</p>
<p> 1.5%. In other words in real terms 1.5% ahead of the CPI adjustment.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay. So in simple terms....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's as simple as I can put it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But putting it simply, the guarantee that nobody would be worse off</p>
<p> under a GST other than tax cheats.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. That remains our position and indeed the modelling that was put,</p>
<p> the modelling that was put by.....I'm sorry, not the modelling.</p>
<p> The evidence, the written evidence that was given by Professor Warren</p>
<p> and by Ms Harding yesterday said that except in extreme cases they</p>
<p> could not identify people who were going to be worse off. In other</p>
<p> words they could not identify losers under plausible assumptions.</p>
<p> That was actually the language that was used.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Isn't Professor Harding arguing that the 1.5% guarantee sort</p>
<p> of clashes with the pegging of pensions at 25% of male average earnings?</p>
<p> And if it's pegged it can be eroded.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't know how it can be eroded if it's always 1.5%.</p>
<p> I mean is it being suggested that if as a consequence of the male</p>
<p> average weekly earnings peg, the pension rises at a greater rate than</p>
<p> our guarantee, surely in those circumstances pensioners are not going</p>
<p> to be worse off.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The States today and the meeting....well I mean that's a simple</p>
<p> point isn't it. The guarantee from you that pensioners won't</p>
<p> be worse off.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah. The guarantee that we gave at the election was that they would</p>
<p> get the CPI adjustment plus always they'd be at least 1.5% ahead</p>
<p> over and above the price impact of the GST.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The other aspect of the GST is the States wanting extra money, and</p>
<p> some saying that they might not support the GST. We will get the extra</p>
<p> money?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'll be going to meet them in about ten minutes, and you</p>
<p> always have a bit of this before a Premiers' Conference. Life</p>
<p> would be dull at a Premiers' Conference without it I can tell</p>
<p> you but in the medium to longer term the GST is a huge bonanza for</p>
<p> the States. Any State that turns its back on this tax package is letting</p>
<p> down the interests of the people in that State because after a few</p>
<p> years the States of Australia, all of them, will be hundreds and then</p>
<p> several....hundreds of millions and then several billion dollars</p>
<p> better off because the GST revenue that they are going to get will</p>
<p> rise at a much faster rate and build at a much faster rate than the</p>
<p> existing guarantee under the financial agreement. So, I can't</p>
<p> for the life of me believe that in his or her right mind any Premier</p>
<p> of Australia would turn their back on this offer because it's</p>
<p> much better. And I say to their constituents, if any of your Premiers</p>
<p> are trying to bring this plan down they are not serving you well.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, if you don't mind we'll take a couple of quick</p>
<p> calls. There's a few pensioners calling through who are concerned</p>
<p> about what they have read about the GST, particularly today. Hello</p>
<p> Valerie.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Hello Neil, how are you?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, What the hell do you think the pension is all about. My</p>
<p> husband and I have nothing behind us, we are paying $750 a month rent.</p>
<p> We won't be able to exist with the GST. I wish you would just</p>
<p> wake up to yourself.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Valerie doesn't like the GST and I understand that but</p>
<p> I don't think her submission, and I respect it, but I disagree</p>
<p> with it and I reject it, does, you know, really bears upon the point</p>
<p> that you were raising.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Doris, hello.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes. Mr Howard, I'd like to ask you one little question. I am</p>
<p> a part pensioner, I get a little bit of superannuation. I just fall</p>
<p> into a tax bracket and I am paying tax but what gets me, I live in</p>
<p> a retirement village, every time we get a pension rise our maintenance</p>
<p> fees go up. Now, when is that going to stop? Is the sky the limit?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's not directly related to the GST and without knowing</p>
<p> all of the circumstances and the understandings that you have in relation</p>
<p> to your retirement village I can't say whether it's fair</p>
<p> or unfair. I can tell you that you'll get a tax benefit from</p>
<p> our plan, you'll get, if you are not paying any tax now, you'll</p>
<p> have a greater buffer against paying tax because the threshold will</p>
<p> go up, you will get a pension adjustment in the manner that I described</p>
<p> earlier. There will also be some relief for the earning limits if</p>
<p> you are over the age of 60 and you have some you'll get a savings</p>
<p> compensation benefit depending on how much savings you have. So there</p>
<p> are quite a number of other benefits that you will get and you will</p>
<p> certainly not be worse off.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, I know you have to get away, just quickly the drugs issue</p>
<p> which I believe you are going to discuss this afternoon, can you tell</p>
<p> us specifically what will be put to the Premiers?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what I am going to put is a plan which basically involves the</p>
<p> compulsory diversion of people into treatment rather than them possibly</p>
<p> falling into the criminal justice system. It will not be unlike the</p>
<p> diversion approach that is being trialed in Victoria. There are many</p>
<p> elements of that that I think are very good. It will not be on all</p>
<p> fores with the drug court system that is operating in New South Wales.</p>
<p> Both of those....</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>This would be for users would it rather than, well obviously not sellers....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, obviously. I mean, the whole idea is there are a very large number</p>
<p> of people who have a problem. They may technically be in breach of</p>
<p> the law. It is clearly not desirable that those people go to jail,</p>
<p> it is clearly desirable though that they get treatment. And I think</p>
<p> most people would feel that if they were in different ways compelled</p>
<p> to have treatment as an alternative to them slipping into the criminal</p>
<p> justice system that would be an extremely good outcome. And the Commonwealth</p>
<p> is prepared to make quite a bit of money available to the States over</p>
<p> and above the $290 million that we have already made available in</p>
<p> the last couple of years and I'll be announcing the full details</p>
<p> of this to the Premiers early this afternoon. But I stress that what</p>
<p> I am putting on the table is over and above the $290 million we have</p>
<p> already put in. And it will not only cover the compulsory diversion</p>
