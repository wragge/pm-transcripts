PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
38TH BIENNIAL AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY FEDERAL CONFERENCE<br />
HOBART 8 JUNE 1988<br />
Australia today is a stronger country, a fairer country, a<br />
country far better equipped to face the future than it was<br />
in March 1983.<br />
And these things are true because the Australian Labor<br />
movement has fulfilled, better than ever before, its<br />
fundamental and historic role.<br />
we have proved ourselves, as never before, the Party of<br />
progress and reform.<br />
And we have been able to do that because, together as a<br />
Party, a movement and a government we have understood the<br />
true meaning of reform, in our time.<br />
It is not about soft options.<br />
It is not a matter of invoking some dogmatic formula.<br />
And, however much we value our great Labor traditions and<br />
we are right to be proud of our past Labor reform is about<br />
the future.<br />
The real importance of Labor traditions is their<br />
contemporary relevance to Labor's enduring goals.<br />
we have accepted that the Labor tradition of reform means<br />
creating the conditions for real and sustainable<br />
improvements in the living standards of all Australians.<br />
we have embarked upon the massive task of sweeping away all<br />
the causes of inefficiency and confrontation, the<br />
inheritance of three decades of conservative rule, the<br />
legacy of intolerance and injustice, all those things which<br />
have held our nation back.<br />
The task that lies ahead is the task of articulating and<br />
pursuing our vision of what we want Australia to be in the<br />
1990s, the Australia we lead into the twenty first century. 007081 </p>
<p>It is that task I address today.<br />
our vision for Australia is an Australia which is fair,<br />
prosperous, competitive and independent.<br />
It is an Australia in which all our children will have a<br />
full and equal opportunity for the total development<br />
of their talents within an education and training<br />
system which is both adequate and relevant<br />
an Australia where those who are actively engaged in<br />
the productive processes will be equitably rewarded<br />
and where those not so engaged the young, the<br />
elderly, the disabled will be decently sustained<br />
by the community,<br />
an Australia whose economy will be able to cope with<br />
the challenges of a rapidly changing world, enmeshed<br />
in our dynamic region and able to contribute to a<br />
better and more peaceful world.<br />
And it is an Australia in which our national goals of<br />
justice and fairness are achieved, not by the savage<br />
conflict of competing interests and groups, but through<br />
national co-operation.<br />
The power of that vision for the future; the strength of our<br />
record since 1983 in pursuing that vision; the unity of the.<br />
Labor movement and its commitment to attain that vision; the<br />
vigour, competence and dedication of our team of Ministers<br />
in pursuit of the vision; the absolute incapacity of our<br />
opponents ever to match or even grasp that vision all<br />
these give me complete confidence that when I lead this<br />
Party to the next election we will win again, and win<br />
convincingly.<br />
We will make the 1990s Labor's decade just as the 1980s have<br />
been substantially ours, because Labor alone can take<br />
Australia to a society based on justice and fairness, an<br />
Australia with a sense of national purpose.<br />
Our opponents had three decades. In their last, worst<br />
period they governed by inciting conflict, by setting<br />
Australian against Australian. They ignored the urgent need<br />
to adapt to our changing environment. They eroded any sense<br />
of Australian national purpose.<br />
our five years in Government have been guided by a different<br />
philosophy a determination that Australians as a community<br />
develop the right and the durable responses to the economic<br />
and social imperatives of the crises we faced. We wanted,<br />
with steadiness and consistency, to assemble in an<br />
integrated way all the necessary building blocks across the<br />
whole range of policy in order to transform our vision into<br />
real ity. 007082 </p>
<p>And let it be quite clear what has been the foundation upon<br />
which we have assembled and erected these building blocks<br />
a foundation which I enunciated even before I became leader<br />
in 1983.<br />
It has been the creation of the atmosphere, attitude,<br />
processes and machinery of constructive co-operation in our<br />
society.<br />
We Australians are now achieving our legitimate objectives<br />
by co-operation, rather than dissipating our resources in<br />
unnecessary confrontation.<br />
That has been the foundation of all that we have achieved in<br />
Government. That, I believe, will be the enduring hallmark of our vision<br />
for Australia.<br />
And it remains as relevant to our task today as it was in<br />
1983.<br />
The impetus of the April 1983 Summit has been transmitted<br />
into the area of general economic policy consideration and<br />
into the decision making process of every Ministerial<br />
portfolio. We have developed processes of consultation across a vast<br />
range of organisations and groups, who take part with us in<br />
the work of building a better Australia.<br />
But of course central to our strategy, a key to the<br />
resolution of Australia's economic problems, the embodiment<br />
of our vision of a co-operative rather than a<br />
confrontationist Australia has been the great partnership,<br />
the historic Accord between the industrial and political<br />
wings of the Labor movement.<br />
And although we will no doubt have our differences from time<br />
to time, that partnership will remain, as it has been,<br />
fundamental to our economic achievements, our social<br />
programs and our political success.<br />
And, delegates, here I answer any assertion that this Labor<br />
Government has deserted its traditional base.<br />
As a matter of history and philosophy, there are many<br />
strands to the Labor tradition.<br />
That is precisely why it has survived, now for nearly a<br />
century, as Australia's greatest and strongest party, as a<br />
rich and diverse movement.<br />
But, throughout that century, throughout all that grand<br />
history, there has been one constant the strength brought<br />
to the Party by its association with the trade union<br />
movement. 0017083 </p>
<p>This Party sprang from the trade union movement.<br />
And now, at a time when a Labor Government has given a new<br />
meaning to that association, a meaning of immense<br />
significance for Australia's future, are we to be told that<br />
we have lost touch with our traditional base?<br />
I reject that utterly.<br />
The truth is that we have forged a new partnership on the<br />
basis of our oldest, strongest tradition our broad<br />
association with the great trade union movement of<br />
Australia. Here is the measure of the strength of the partnership. We<br />
first lifted Australia out of the inherited recession, the<br />
worst in fifty years. We then weathered the massive<br />
collapse in our terms of trade that wiped $ 11 billion from<br />
our national income. And through all that we have been and<br />
are, putting Australia firmly on a reconstructed road to<br />
sustainable prosperity.<br />
We have seen the central objective as getting the economy<br />
right and, in that process, creating secure jobs. indeed<br />
this is the very condition of effectively meeting the social<br />
obligations of Government. No social security payment is an<br />
adequate substitute for the benefit and dignity of<br />
employment. That is why all of us in the Labor movement are entitled to<br />
take enormous pride in the fact that we have created over<br />
one million new jobs since we have been in office more<br />
than four times the rate of job creation under the<br />
Fraser-Howard Government.<br />
We have only been able to achieve this result because the<br />
trade union movement, through the Accord, has exchanged<br />
restraint in real wages for significant improvements in the<br />
social wage.<br />
Further real wage cuts will not be necessary in 1988-89. We<br />
are committed to, and will support wage rises as large and<br />
as prompt as the country can afford.<br />
wage rises in line with An expected falling inflation rate<br />
will enable us to bring in substantial cuts in personal tax<br />
rates in the following financial year 1989-90.<br />
By this combination of wage increases and tax cuts, this<br />
Government will deliver over the remainder of this<br />
Parliament what Australian workers need and deserve the<br />
maintenance and gradual improvement of their living<br />
standards.<br />
Just as the Accor d underpins the strategy for economic<br />
growth, it fosters Labor's social strategy for a fairer<br />
society. The detailed description of our massive and<br />
widespread achievements in the area of social justice is in<br />
the report I recently launched " Towards a Fairer Australia." 007084 </p>
<p>It is the proud record of a Government, proud in the Labor<br />
tradition and unmatched in achievement by any Government in<br />
the history of the country. I<br />
And we must remember that the objectives of social justice<br />
are not pursued through the avenue of Government outlays<br />
alone. These are important, of course, as evidenced for<br />
instance by our substantial increases in the real value of<br />
pensions and targetted assistance for the most needy groups<br />
in the community.<br />
But social justice is also affected by the way in which<br />
Government raises its revenue.<br />
And your Labor Government, in undertaking this country's<br />
most extensive tax reform, has been guided by the twin<br />
imperatives of economic efficiency and equity.<br />
We have systematically cut out the tax rorts for the<br />
privileged. Capital gains and fringe benefits no longer go<br />
untaxed. We are cracking down on companies that avoid their<br />
fair share of the tax burden, including through the use of<br />
international tax havens.<br />
we are building an Australia which is fairer both in the<br />
gathering of tax revenue and in the redistribution of it to<br />
those who are most in need.<br />
Just as we have received the support of the trade union<br />
movement in addressing these macro-economic and social<br />
issues, so also has there been constructive co-operation in<br />
the approach to industry reconstruction.<br />
The simple truth is that Australia can no longer afford to<br />
be so exposed to dramatic commodity price fluctuations. our<br />
manufacturing and service sectors have to become more<br />
efficient and competitive both against imports and in<br />
markets abroad. Increasingly the markets of Australian<br />
industry must be not simply the 16 million people of this<br />
country but the 5 billion people of the world.<br />
In consultation with the trade unions and industry we have<br />
already made significant progress through specific industry<br />
sectoral plans and more general measures.<br />
In 1987, for example, exports of manufactured goods<br />
increased by 30 per cent. Over the last five years the<br />
share of manufactured goods in our merchandise exports has<br />
risen from 21 per cent to 26 per cent. And, of course,<br />
tourism is rapidly growing as a major export earner in<br />
fact at twice the rate of merchandise exports.<br />
The May Economic Statement represents a further significant<br />
commitment to this process of restructuring the economy.<br />
The superannuation changes will provide a strong incentive<br />
for funds to direct investment from abroad and from debt<br />
into profitable, competitive Australian companies. 007085 </p>
<p>6.<br />
The tax and tariff changes mean that investment decisions in<br />
future will generate real economic returns, rather than<br />
simply take advantage of a subsidy.<br />
I repeat here the undertaking I have given to the trade<br />
union movement: together with the unions, we will closely<br />
monitor the impact of tariff changes and if, against our<br />
expectations, more needs to be done to assist those who may<br />
be adversely affected, then this will be done.<br />
Delegates, our achievement and commitment and vision in this<br />
area is clear a more dynamic, competitive economy,<br />
providing more secure and satisfying employment for our<br />
young people into the future.<br />
And, of course, this emphasises the centrality of education<br />
and training to our vision for the future.<br />
We are. not leaving the future of our children to chance.<br />
We have increased access, retention, resources and<br />
relevance. We have done this right across the board, from<br />
schools through to TAFE colleges and universities.<br />
Let me give these examples:<br />
We have increased retention rates of secondary<br />
students from 36 per cent in 1982 to 53 per cent in<br />
1987 and will achieve 65 per cent early in the next<br />
decade. We have more than doubled the secondary allowance<br />
to assist children from low income families, and<br />
removed disincentives to continue with education<br />
and training.*<br />
We have created 46,400 extra higher education<br />
places compared with only 14,900 in the same<br />
period under our predecessors.<br />
By next year, we will have doubled, in real terms,<br />
funding for training and begun to re-vamp the<br />
apprenticeship system.<br />
Delegates, we can take pride in these achievements.<br />
Together we will continue reform to that point where all our<br />
young people will have access to a system which will fully<br />
develop their talents and will ensure for Australia a well<br />
trained, flexible and relevant work force.<br />
And in this respect we will encourage an extension of the<br />
historic process now developing between workers and their<br />
employers in the metal trades industry. 007086 </p>
<p>7.<br />
This involves a deliberate attempt to improve job<br />
satisfaction and productivity by restructuring and<br />
simplifying the mass of award classifications accumulated<br />
over half a century. This is the kind of process<br />
fundamental to securing the long term prosperity of this<br />
country. Delegates, in so man-y of the policy areas to which I have<br />
referred the achievements themselves point the way to our<br />
future vision. But I want to be quite specific about how<br />
your Labor Government will face the demanding task of<br />
further fulfilling our social justice aspirations.<br />
We have already introduced the historic reforms of the<br />
Family Allowance Supplement and the Child Support Scheme-<br />
Bill Kelty has said of the former they are of such a<br />
magnitude they would have taken fifty years to achieve<br />
through industrial negotiations. But to achieve our pledge<br />
that by 1990 no Australian child need live in poverty<br />
your Government has set targets for further increases in<br />
family ' payments which, once achieved, will be maintained in<br />
real terms.<br />
we will further improve care for the aged.<br />
we will continue to work on the National Agenda for Women,<br />
the most detailed, practical and comprehensive strategy ever<br />
produced by an Australian Government to achieve equality of<br />
opportunity for Australian women.<br />
We will continue to provide more child care places.<br />
We will work to break down the barriers which prevent the<br />
long-term unemployed, sole parents and other disadvantaged<br />
groups from obtaining rewarding jobs.<br />
We will continue to defend Mledicare ensuring that the<br />
millions of Australians who live in security under its<br />
umbrella are not left out in the cold by those who want to<br />
dismantle dismantle again that great Labor achievement.<br />
By 1990 we will have extended access to occupational*<br />
superannuation to cover the great majority of Australian<br />
workers a reform which will provide them with security in<br />
their retirement years.<br />
we will continue to fight for the rights of consumers<br />
through monitoring prices and, more directly, by ensuring*<br />
they get the maximum benefit in lower prices and better<br />
services through tariff cuts and through our steady<br />
improvement in the management of Government business<br />
enterprises.,<br />
We will remain dedicated to an immigration process<br />
thoroughly free of discrimination, and the creation of a<br />
society diverse in its skills and cultures and faiths, and<br />
committed as one to building the future of our great<br />
Australian nation. 007087 </p>
<p>We will seek to effect a reconciliation between Aboriginal<br />
and all other Australians which recognises the obligations<br />
of this nation to its most disadvantaged group.<br />
Delegates, I have to this point spoken exclusively of domestic matters.<br />
But Labor's achievements and Labor's vision encompass<br />
Australia's place in the region and the wider world.<br />
We have not been prepared to ignore the challenges of a<br />
changing world economy, nor stand aside and allow others to<br />
determine, alone, the issues of international relations<br />
which are critical to our future.<br />
Australia under Labor is at last preparing to meet those<br />
challenges and is exercising a constructive and creative<br />
role in the great issues of our time.<br />
With our initiative in establishing the Cairns Group and in<br />
its continuing leadership, we are taking a leading role in<br />
the urgent struggle being waged to establish a fair system<br />
of international trade.<br />
More than any Australian Government we have worked with<br />
diligence and determination in all relevant international<br />
forums to press for reduction of nuclear arsenals and their<br />
ultimate elimination from the face of the earth.<br />
For this reason Australia particularly welcomes the outcome<br />
of the fourth Reagan/ Gorbachev Summit and the signing of the<br />
INF Treaty. The world is entitled to feel we may be<br />
witnessing a real turning point in the hitherto negative and<br />
potentially disastrous relationship between the two<br />
superpowers.<br />
We have maintained close and continuous dialogue with our<br />
American friends and allies on these and other issues a<br />
dialogue I look forward to continuing with President Reagan,<br />
George Shultz and other members of the Administration later<br />
this month.<br />
And we have also been able to develop an open-minded<br />
communication with the Soviet Union most particularly on the<br />
occasion of my visit there with Bill Hayden last December.<br />
In three and a half hours discussion with General-Secretary<br />
Gorbachev I was able to establish a basis for future<br />
relations which should be of mutual benefit to our two<br />
countries. We will continue a cautious but constructive<br />
dialogue in the face of opponents who are incapable of<br />
rising above the slogans and reflexes of the 1950s.<br />
In the Commonwealth and in the United Nations this<br />
Government has taken a leading role in mobilising world<br />
opinion against the abhorrent system of apartheid in South<br />
Africa. We will continue this fight and recognise our<br />
obligation to assist in material terms the peoples of this<br />
region. O( J~' O88 </p>
<p>As I promised early in the life of our Government we are<br />
involving ourselves as never before in the dramatic economic<br />
and political changes in our region the fastest growing<br />
region in the world. I say with pride that no nation has<br />
built a warmer or more constructive relationship with China<br />
than Australia has.<br />
Of course we have and will continue to have a particular<br />
involvement with the South Pacific region. At a time of<br />
lessening stability in the region we have been prepared to<br />
condemn and react where that is necessary as in the case of<br />
the military overthrow of the Bavadra Government in Fiji.<br />
But we do not see Australia's role being to bully, to<br />
patronise or to lecture but to be a friendly and<br />
constructive partner, to carry out the responsibilities<br />
which flow from our comparative wealth and to use our<br />
influence as befits a decent and democratic neighbour.<br />
In this context it was perhaps not surprising that recently<br />
it was Australia to whom Vanuatu first turned and we were<br />
able to respond positively to a request for assistance from<br />
a democratically elected Government and so prevent a<br />
recurrence of destructive violence and a possible threat to<br />
our citizens.<br />
For all these reasons I am able to say proudly to you that<br />
after five years of Labor in office Australia's name has<br />
never stood higher in the world than it does today.<br />
And that is simply because in our policies abroad, as at<br />
home, we have adhered to and pursued the fundamental<br />
principles of this great Party.<br />
Delegates, in the discussions before and during this<br />
Conference, there have been many references to the<br />
principles and traditions of the Party and the movement.<br />
And that is how it should be because it is our principles.<br />
and our traditions that inspire and inform the continuing<br />
practical work to which we are committed, as a Party and as<br />
a Government.<br />
The real importance of our traditions and principles is<br />
precisely the extent that we are capable of using them as<br />
And to illustrate my meaning, let me go to the source the<br />
platform itself.<br />
Let me quote the opening words of the platform.<br />
" The Australian Labor Party had its origins in<br />
The aspirations of the Australian people for a decent,<br />
secure, dignified and constructive way of life. 0 708 9 </p>
<p>The recognition by the trade union movement of the<br />
necessity for a political voice to take forward the<br />
struggle of the working class against the excesses,<br />
injustices and inequalities of capitalism.<br />
The commitment by the Australian people to the creation<br />
of an independent, free and enlightened Australia."<br />
Delegates, I assert that the record of achievement I have<br />
outlined today, and the program for the future, expresses<br />
and embodies those basic principles and goals, in a<br />
practical sustainable way, and to a degree unparalleled in<br />
the history of the Party.<br />
Delegates, The simple fact is that no party in Australian politics<br />
today can come close to matching the capacity, commitment<br />
and breadth of vision which the Labor Party brings to the<br />
task of managing these domestic and external challenges of<br />
the future.<br />
Since our historic third successive victory last July our<br />
conservative opponents have failed every political hurdle<br />
they have faced: the consumption tax issue, media<br />
ownership, justice in South Africa, aborigines, the<br />
constitutional referendums.<br />
The conservatives stand in mid-1988 just where they stood in<br />
mid-1987 leaderless, directionless, devoid of policy,<br />
motivated solely by political opportunism.<br />
They would take us back to an unfair taxation system, to<br />
confrontation in the workplace, to environmental vandalism.<br />
They would inflict savage cuts in government outlays for<br />
those in need in order to restore tax perks for the<br />
privileged. They would reimpose the kneejerk foreign policy<br />
of the 150s and<br />
Most of all they would set aside the absolutely vital task<br />
of economic reconstruction. They would once again shirk the<br />
challenge of reform they simply do not have the capacity,<br />
wit or guts for the task.<br />
That, however, delegates, should make us not the more<br />
complacent but the more diligent in ensuring they stay in<br />
the wilderness.<br />
That is a ta sk in which all of us share a responsibilityfrom<br />
Cabinet Minister to branch member. I exclude none of<br />
us from this task. I pledge myself to it.<br />
We must bear the shared responsibility because the best.<br />
interests of the Australian people demand it.<br />
In a very real sense, if we fail, all Australians fail. 007090 </p>
<p>11.<br />
That commitment to Labor's continued success does indeed<br />
involve a commitment to Labor traditions and Labor<br />
principles. But as I said at the beginning there are many strands to<br />
the Labor tradition; and that tradition must be constantly<br />
revalued, if it is to retain its real and enduring<br />
relevance. Only if we continue to do that will we continue to be part,<br />
not only of the great Labor tradition, but of a living and<br />
growing tradition the tradition and the reality of. Labor's<br />
service to this nation and to this people.<br />
Only if we continue to do that, will we maintain our<br />
capacity to take this country forward and to fulfil, again<br />
in the words of our platform, " the aspirations of the<br />
Australian people for a decent, secure, dignified and<br />
constructive way of life."<br />
I believe this Conference has advanced that cause.<br />
Let us keep working. Let us enter the 1990s strong, united,<br />
determined, still pursuing, together, the vision of a<br />
better, fairer Australia proud in itself, proud in the world<br />
a vision which flows in a direct line from the inspiration<br />
of those pioneers who, now nearly a century ago, founded<br />
this great Australian Labor Party. 007091 </p>
