0. INAUGURATION OF LONSDALE PLANT OF CHRYSLER.<br />
AUSTRALIA LIMITED<br />
71 % FRCa ? a LONSDALE, SOUThi AUSTRALIA<br />
., 1967oy 3RD NOVEMBER, 1967<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt<br />
Mr and Mrs Brown, Mr and Mrs Boyd, Mr Premier and Mrs Dunstan,<br />
Ministers , Members of Parliament, Leader of the, Qpposition, Mr Mayor,<br />
and the very many other Distinguished Guests around me, and those<br />
associated with the Chrysler Plant, Ladies and Gentlemen ( if I haven ' t<br />
already covered you, and good afternoon to you all:<br />
I don't know that I can classify what I am about to say, in<br />
the terms of Mr Greig, as an inaugural address, but I assure you it does<br />
givye me a very special pleasure to be here and to welcome the formal.<br />
addition tb the armoury of Australian industrial assets, represented by.<br />
these amazingly fine plants that we have visited at the Chrysler Lonsdale<br />
establishment. Before I comment in a little detail on one or two aspects of<br />
today's ceremony, could I just make a few personal references perso~ al<br />
references not of a parliamentary kind, I assure you, but of a friendly:<br />
kind because this must be a very proud day in the life of Mr David Brown.<br />
And we are sharing his sense of pride and pleasure and achievement whtch<br />
must represent for him the result of a great deal of painstaking work, a<br />
great deal of courage and a great deal of applied effort and skill.<br />
We welcome Mr and Mrs Boyd. We were told that this Ip the<br />
first time that a President of Chrysler had visited Australia. Australia s<br />
having an increasing run of visits from Presidents, whether they be hea~ s<br />
of state or heads of great corporations In various parts of the world.<br />
I think this, too, is an indication of the growing significance our country<br />
possesses in the eyes of the rest of the world. So we particularly welcome<br />
the head of this great motor organisation, one of the bigthree of the United<br />
States of America, and now one of the big three in our own country's<br />
automotive industry. I should not pass from personal references without saying<br />
how pleased I have been as I am sure so many of you are in this room<br />
to see with us, rather heavily disguised, our old friend, Fergy. When<br />
I first caught a glimpse of him this afternoon, I thought he was Australia's<br />
answer to the late Ernest Hemingway, but still, one can't mistake him, as<br />
you see those gleaming, sparkling eyes, and those of us who have knowrq<br />
over the years the contribution he has made to the pioneering efforts of<br />
Chrysler Dodge in Australia applaud him and welcome him here on this<br />
occasion. I did learn that the Chrysler Corporation had here with<br />
us a public relations counsel by the name of Ford. Well, now, I don't<br />
know whether that shows how big-hearted or how confident they are perhaps<br />
I should say how valiant they are, but If Mr Ford has any spare time over<br />
the next few weeks, I would be very glad to consult with him. I think I may<br />
need him. I confess I was rather prompted to develop this thought because<br />
as I looked across here, I saw a handsome vehicle which was marked<br />
" VIP Safari". I hasten to assure you it was no addition to the Commonwealth<br />
fleet. / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
But, ladies and gentlemen, this Is a great moment In the<br />
history of this State, and It is a very welcome occasion in the history of<br />
the economic and Industrial growth of Australia. It Is, I assure you, for<br />
me a stirring experience to go around this country as your Prime Minister<br />
and see In all parts of Australia In one form or another, whether It Is<br />
some vast mineral project, whether It Is a new water project, whether It<br />
Is a great Industrial development, whatever form it takes, this addition to<br />
Australia's developmental strength and our industrial growth. I hope that<br />
we can all take an Australian view of these developments, wherever they<br />
occur, because I emphasise that wherever they occur, they benefit fellow<br />
Australians wherever those fellow Australians may be.<br />
If there is prosperity through Hamersley, or through the<br />
Ord or through the alumina plant at Gladstone, or from whatever other<br />
cause, then tkhis Is a prosperity which will tend to spread through to<br />
organisations such as this. If people have the means, they will be looking<br />
for the amenities, and already in Australia we have shown our appreciation<br />
and the value we place upon our automotive industry by the fact that we<br />
rank now, I am assured by those who study these things closely, second<br />
only to the United States of America in the availability of motor vehicles per<br />
head of the popu lation. And the automotive industry has become the largest<br />
employer of labour In the nation. It particularly typifies the po st-war<br />
industrial growth of Australia because It contains those elements of growth<br />
which are a peculiar feature of the post-war period.<br />
First of all, it is a new Industry for this country. Secondly,<br />
It absorbs a very considerable proportion of the labour of migrants who come<br />
to Australia, more, I think, than any other industry in the Commonwealth.<br />
And thirdly, it has brought us the benefit of capital, of technological skill,<br />
of experience, from those who have developed these things abroad. Mr Boyd<br />
has spoken of the many millions of dollars of Investment from his company<br />
here, but they have also brought skills here and the value to Australia Is.<br />
almost incalculable from what has developed out of the automotive industry<br />
In this country. Now I know there Is always a disposition on the part of some<br />
to cast a critical eye over foreign Investment in Australia. I have never had<br />
that critical view myself because the advantages have always seemed to me<br />
to so vastly outweigh any disadvantages that in a young, developing country<br />
we had to welcome the capital, just as we had to welcome people to develop<br />
our population, and we had to welcome the technical skills which would help<br />
to make this country strong. And even where these enterprises have been<br />
completely owned from overseas, I have recognised an Australian equity<br />
existing In them, because if they are profitable, we take 421 per cent of<br />
profits by way of tax. From what is left, a great deal of it Is ploughed back<br />
Into further development and therefore further Australian emnp loyment, a~ nd<br />
If some sums are remitted overseas, then we take a further tax, usually<br />
of the order of 15 per cent on whatever is remitted overseas. We derive<br />
revenues from the employment that is given, just as Australians derive<br />
welfare from the fact of this employment and the incomes that come Into<br />
Australian households. Then, In addition to this, has anybody ever tired to calculate<br />
the secondary effects generated through the economy by a vast organisation<br />
such as this, the demands upon other suppliers, the sub-contractors, the<br />
orders for steel, for cement, for a whole variety of components that go into<br />
the making first of the factory establishment, and then of the car itself.<br />
And so we have been particularly well served by this particular foarm of<br />
I 4b P. O./ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
investment here in Australia. But Chrysler, In the words of Mr Boyd, has gone one<br />
better. It has assured us thait quite apart from any general Australian<br />
equity we may derive from these activities, special arrangements are being<br />
made so that there shall be a direct Australian participation in the shareholding<br />
of the organisation. And we welcome that.<br />
He has also told us two other things which are very<br />
welcome to me. One Is that there is a growing export trade from the<br />
products ot this company, thereby helping to earn valuable foreign exchange<br />
for Australia, I was here, as Mr Brown will recall, when you celebrated<br />
the production of your 50, 000th Valiant and the 5, 000th export at that time.<br />
Now you have swollen the volume of export very considerably and we are<br />
told today of the arrangements which have been made by the American<br />
principals to see that Australia Is to have an export opportunity outside this<br />
country, and through the rest of Oceania, through Asia, through Africa,<br />
and through what Mr Boyd describes as our Far EFast, but which will be known<br />
to m ost of us as our Near North. I am afraid if we were exporting to the<br />
Far East, we would be invading his market In the United States, and that<br />
wouldn't do. But we in Australia have had to come to the realisation over<br />
recent years that what has in the past familiarly been regarded by others,<br />
and even here, as the Far East, is for us our very Near North, and he<br />
opens up for us great opportunities therefore for an expanding export trade.<br />
It Is a matter for pride for all of us that Australian workmanship, that<br />
Australian skills and the finish to the car itself, can obtain for it a place<br />
in markets beyond this country.<br />
Now, Mr Premier, you in this State have a disadvantage<br />
compared with some of the other States of the Commonwealth. The resources<br />
you have been able to turn up of a natural kind tend to be rather more limited<br />
than In some of the more favoured States. But South Australia has done*<br />
well in this important respect. You have attracted Industry here because<br />
of the quality of your work-force, the industrial stability which this workforce<br />
has demonstrated, by the stability generally and good sense which<br />
have been displayed by the people of this State. I know this has made a<br />
particular impression upon Mr Boyd and I have heard other visiting<br />
industrialists comment on it. While South Australia can go on contributing<br />
that special quality to Its attrectiveness, I do not question that Its own<br />
industrial development will grow apace.<br />
In speaking of the work-force, what has struck me,<br />
as a former Minister for Labour several years ago, Is the improvement<br />
made in foundry production compared with the darker and less satisfactory<br />
days of an earlier time. The working conditions here are a matter for<br />
congratulation. They demonstrate that not only have we made technical<br />
progress and achieved greater efficiency, but in that progress we have<br />
greatly improved the working conditions of those wiho take part in the<br />
enterprise. For all these things, Mr Boyd and MW Brown, you are<br />
to be congratulated. In formally declaring this Lonsdale Plant open, I convey<br />
to you on behalf of my colleagues of the Government my own personal good<br />
wishes, every wish that you w1, ill continue to pros per and that you will be a<br />
permanent element in a growing and increasingly prosperous Australian<br />
automotive industry. Good luck to Chrysler. May the Valiants be a symbol<br />
of your courage, your farsightedness and the speed of your progress in the<br />
future. </p>
