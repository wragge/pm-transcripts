INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Council of Australian Governments today held its tenth meeting in<br />
Canberra. The Council, comprising the Prime Minister, Premiers and Chief  Ministers and the President of the Australian Local Government Association  (ALGA), had wide ranging discussions on important areas of national interest.</p>
<p>This Communique sets out the agreed outcomes of the discussions.</p>
<p>FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE</p>
<p>Australia is free from major exotic animal diseases such as Foot and</p>
<p> Mouth Disease (FMD). If an outbreak of FMD was to occur in Australia,</p>
<p> there would be a major impact on the agricultural sector, the national</p>
<p> economy and rural and regional Australia. Losses in export revenue for</p>
<p> the livestock sector alone are conservatively estimated to amount to at</p>
<p> least $5.8 billion in the first year. Recovery costs for agriculture and</p>
<p> other affected sectors of the economy would be likely to amount to billions</p>
<p> of dollars over several years after the outbreak has been eradicated.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth government in its 2001-02 Budget has committed a further</p>
<p> $593 million over five years to strengthen Australia's border agencies</p>
<p> in their work to counter threats from exotic pests and diseases, which</p>
<p> is particularly relevant to the risks of foot and mouth disease in current</p>
<p> circumstances. A range of emergency response plans is also in place to</p>
<p> deal with an emergency situation should an outbreak occur.</p>
<p>The Council noted that if a significant outbreak of FMD occurred in Australia,</p>
<p> the technical, logistical, social and financial response needed to manage</p>
<p> the situation would be on a whole-of-government level not experienced</p>
<p> before in peacetime. Appropriate plans therefore need to be upgraded and</p>
<p> tested. The Council agreed to the continued high priority review and revision</p>
<p> of national whole-of-government frameworks for the prevention, preparedness</p>
<p> for, and management of a major emergency disease outbreak, such as FMD.</p>
<p> COAG agreed to establish a Foot and Mouth Disease Taskforce under the</p>
<p> oversight of COAG Senior Officials to coordinate the development of these</p>
<p> frameworks. The Taskforce will be chaired by the Commonwealth and comprise</p>
<p> two officials from each jurisdiction - one from First Ministers' departments</p>
<p> and one from the lead line agency. A representative from ALGA will attend</p>
<p> the Taskforce.</p>
<p>The Council also agreed to:</p>
<p> *  the development by States/Territories and the Commonwealth of</p>
<p>   complementary whole-of-government frameworks, for their respective jurisdictions,</p>
<p>   in enhancing:</p>
<p> * peak level arrangements across and within jurisdictions (beyond</p>
<p>   the well tested agricultural arrangements);</p>
<p> *  emergency roles and linkages across Commonwealth agencies;</p>
<p> * emergency roles and linkages across and within State/Territory</p>
<p>   agencies including the use of all their relevant powers to control</p>
<p>   emergency outbreaks;</p>
<p> * the need to adequately support, implement and test these frameworks;</p>
<p> * the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New</p>
<p>   Zealand (ARMCANZ), or its successor, reporting after its August 2001</p>
<p>   meeting to members of COAG out-of-session on the outcomes of its review</p>
<p>   of emergency animal disease prevention, preparedness and response arrangements;</p>
<p> * the provision to members of COAG out-of-session, by mid-October 2001,</p>
<p>   of a report by COAG Senior Officials outlining the whole-of-government</p>
<p>   frameworks; and</p>
<p> * the holding as soon as possible of a full-scale simulation under third</p>
<p>   party oversight to test the arrangements.</p>
<p>ENERGY POLICY</p>
<p>The Council considered energy policy on a national level, recognising</p>
<p> that the energy sector affects the lives of all Australians and that it</p>
<p> underpins responsible and sustainable development, international competitiveness</p>
<p> and economic growth. COAG also recognised that energy markets should operate</p>
<p> to maximise provision of reliable energy services and that the effective</p>
<p> operation of an open and competitive energy market contributes to delivering</p>
<p> benefits to households, small business and industry. COAG noted key strategic</p>
<p> issues for Australia's energy future, including the important emerging</p>
<p> role gas will play in any national energy policy because of its domestic</p>
<p> abundance and flexibility and it is a clean energy source. The challenge</p>
<p> for the energy sector is to deliver these benefits within a sustainable</p>
<p> development framework and to meet expectations of social responsibility</p>
<p> and responsiveness to consumers.</p>
<p>All Australian Governments reaffirmed their existing commitments to currently-agreed</p>
<p> principles, reforms and currently-announced timetables underpinning the</p>
<p> development of the national electricity and gas markets and reform of</p>
<p> the energy sector. However, COAG noted the concerns of Queensland and</p>
<p> South Australia that while they will make their best endeavours, they</p>
<p> were not prepared to reaffirm current contestability extension timetables.</p>
<p> COAG also agreed to a national energy policy framework to guide future</p>
<p> energy policy decision-making by jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Against this background, COAG agreed on the following priority actions:</p>
<p>In order that Governments can provide effective policy leadership to</p>
<p> meet the opportunities and challenges facing the energy sector, COAG agreed</p>
<p> to establish a new Ministerial Council on Energy and to provide it with</p>
<p> a series of priority tasks for its consideration and resolution. These</p>
<p> tasks include examining: future energy use scenarios for Australia; potential</p>
<p> for harmonising regulatory arrangements; opportunities for increasing</p>
<p> interconnection and system security in electricity and gas; and ways of</p>
<p> enhancing cooperative energy efficiency activities. COAG also agreed that</p>
<p> the new Council be established and meet as soon as possible including</p>
<p> to oversee the processes of the independent review (see below), which</p>
<p> is designed to provide a firm information basis for future government</p>
<p> decisions on energy market development and for the Council's future work.</p>
<p>COAG noted the establishment of a National Electricity Market (NEM) policy</p>
<p> Forum of Ministers with specific policy responsibilities in relation to</p>
<p> the NEM from NSW, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and the ACT, in</p>
<p> which the Commonwealth and Tasmania will participate. In the context of</p>
<p> previous COAG agreements to establish a NEM, the Forum will give urgent</p>
<p> attention to NEM issues of impediments to investment in interconnection,</p>
<p> transmission pricing, regulatory overlap, market behaviour (eg. rebidding)</p>
<p> and the effectiveness of regulatory arrangements in promoting efficient</p>
<p> market outcomes. It will also address regional boundaries and demand side</p>
<p> participation.</p>
<p>In this context, COAG agreed to request the National Electricity Code</p>
<p> Administrator (NECA) to review Value of Lost Load (VoLL). COAG also agreed</p>
<p> to request NECA give early attention to NEM bidding and rebidding rules</p>
<p> in its current review under the National Electricity Code.</p>
<p>The Forum will report to members of COAG following its first meeting</p>
<p> in late June on key approaches and timetables for addressing these priority</p>
<p> issues.</p>
<p>In light of strategic issues affecting Australia's future energy requirements</p>
<p> and the need to respond to likely future challenges and international</p>
<p> developments, COAG agreed to an independent review of energy market directions</p>
<p> so that further Australian energy market development can be focussed on</p>
<p> areas likely to generate the most significant benefits.</p>
<p>COAG agreed that this review will identify the strategic issues for Australian</p>
<p> energy markets and the policies required from Commonwealth, State and</p>
<p> Territory governments. The Panel will consist of three eminent, technically</p>
<p> qualified persons with the Commonwealth to select the chair and the two</p>
<p> further members to be agreed by the Commonwealth, the States and Territories.</p>
<p> The Review, which will include a public consultation and submission process,</p>
<p> will report within 12 months of its commencement, with its report being</p>
<p> provided concurrently to all COAG members through the new Ministerial</p>
<p> Council on Energy. Costs of the Review will be shared on a 50:50 basis</p>
<p> between the Commonwealth and the States/Territories.</p>
<p>Further details of COAG's agreement, including agreed terms of reference</p>
<p> for COAG's independent review of energy market directions can be found</p>

<p>REVIEW OF MINISTERIAL COUNCILS</p>
<p>Following a review of the number and role of Ministerial Councils, Heads</p>
<p> of Government have agreed to a streamlining of Ministerial Councils which</p>
<p> combines a number of Councils in related functional fields, to strengthen</p>
<p> their strategic direction and improve opportunities for cooperative policy</p>
<p> development. The proposed changes are outlined at: <a href="http://www.coag.gov.au/meetings/080601/councils_review.htm">http://www.coag.gov.au/meetings/080601/councils_review.htm</a>.</p>
<p>The Council further agreed that Senior Officials would develop, for consideration</p>
<p> out-of-session by COAG, a proposal for a more fundamental structural reform</p>
<p> to the Ministerial Council system.</p>
<p>As part of the review of Ministerial Councils, COAG agreed to introduce</p>
<p> new "Guidelines for the Creation of New Ministerial Councils". The guidelines</p>
<p> introduce a series of issues to be addressed before a Council can be established.</p>
<p> COAG further agreed upon a revised version of the existing Broad Protocols</p>
<p> and General Principles for the Operation of Ministerial Councils with</p>
<p> a view to improving the overall coordination, efficiency and effectiveness</p>
<p> of Ministerial Councils.</p>
<p>In this context, COAG agreed that local government be represented appropriately</p>
<p> on Ministerial Councils where there was a clear local government interest.</p>
<p>Heads of Government reaffirmed that Ministerial Councils play an important</p>
<p> role in facilitating consultation and cooperation between Governments.</p>
<p> The agreed changes will improve the co-ordination and integration of policy</p>
<p> and other issues of common interest within the Federation.</p>
<p>REVIEW OF DISASTER RELIEF AND MITIGATION</p>
<p>The Council agreed to commission a wide-ranging review of how Australia</p>
<p> deals with natural disasters. Across the nation, the economic cost of</p>
<p> natural disasters averages over $1.1 billion annually. The review will</p>
<p> examine arrangements for natural disaster relief and community recovery,</p>
<p> gaps in disaster insurance, disaster mitigation programmes, and Australia's</p>
<p> capacity to respond to such emergencies. All jurisdictions, and ALGA,</p>
<p> will take part in the review, which will be chaired by the Commonwealth.</p>
<p> Through this important review governments will jointly assess the effectiveness</p>
<p> of programmes to reduce the risks associated with disasters, and to help</p>
<p> communities manage, respond and recover from them. In doing so, the review</p>
<p> will identify options for improving on existing arrangements.</p>
<p>RECONCILIATION FRAMEWORK</p>
<p>The Council confirmed its continuing commitment to addressing the social</p>
<p> and economic disadvantages experienced by many indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>All governments have reported progress in implementing the reconciliation</p>
<p> framework agreed by the Council in November 2000. Governments have focussed</p>
<p> on responding to the three priority areas for action under the framework</p>
<p> - community leadership, reviewing and re-engineering programmes and services</p>
<p> to achieve better outcomes for indigenous peoples, and building links</p>
<p> between the business sector and indigenous communities to advance economic</p>
<p> independence. The Council noted that the development of partnerships between</p>
<p> indigenous peoples and governments, greater flexibility and coordination</p>
<p> between programmes, and a focus on practical outcomes for local communities</p>
<p> are key factors in advancing reconciliation.</p>
<p>Ministerial Councils continue to play an important role in the implementation</p>
<p> of the reconciliation framework and are progressing the development of</p>
<p> action plans, benchmarks and reporting strategies for improving outcomes</p>
<p> for indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>The Council noted that it would continue to review progress under the</p>
<p> reconciliation framework, and that a detailed report on progress achieved</p>
<p> by governments and Ministerial Councils would be coordinated by the Senior</p>
<p> Officials' Working Group and provided to the Council by the end of 2001.</p>
<p>NATIONAL ACTION PLAN FOR SALINITY AND WATER QUALITY</p>
<p>The Council reviewed the substantial progress being made in giving effect</p>
<p> to the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality in Australia</p>
<p> agreed on by COAG at its 3 November 2000 meeting. The Commonwealth, State</p>
<p> and Territory governments, as well as ALGA reiterated their commitment</p>
<p> to working with regional communities to address the problems arising from</p>
<p> increasing salinity and deteriorating water quality and to finalising</p>
<p> the structure and implementation arrangements required for Action Plan</p>
<p> projects to commence.</p>
<p>The Council noted that the Commonwealth and South Australia would sign</p>
<p> the first Bilateral Agreement under the National Action Plan today and</p>
<p> that the ACT will sign the Intergovernmental Agreement, joining Queensland,</p>
<p> South Australia and the Northern Territory, which have already done so.</p>
<p>The Council also agreed to the establishment of a Natural Resource Management</p>
<p> Ministerial Council to oversee implementation of the Action Plan as part</p>
<p> of its consideration of the review of Ministerial Councils.</p>
<p>ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING HUMAN CLONING</p>
<p>The Council committed itself to achieving nationally consistent provisions</p>
<p> in legislation to prohibit human cloning .</p>
<p>It also agreed that jurisdictions work towards nationally consistent</p>
<p> approaches to regulate assisted reproductive technology and related emerging</p>
<p> human technologies.</p>
<p>In reaching agreement on this latter issue Heads of Government were acutely</p>
<p> aware of the need to engage the community on the matter and to ensure</p>
<p> that all sectors of the community benefit fully from advances in medical</p>
<p> science while prohibiting unacceptable practices. The Council has sought</p>
<p> a report from Health Ministers by the end of the year on technical issues</p>
<p> with the aim of a nationally consistent approach being in place in all</p>
<p> jurisdictions by June 2002.</p>
<p>OTHER MATTERS</p>
<p>The Council discussed the Commonwealth, States and Territory Governments</p>
<p> responses to the collapse of HIH Insurance Group and agreed to support</p>
<p> the Royal Commission. The Prime Minister briefed the Council on Commonwealth</p>
<p> actions for the expeditious establishment of the Royal Commission.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister advised the Council that the Commonwealth would introduce</p>
<p> amendments to the Insurance Act 1973 into the current sitting of the Commonwealth</p>
<p> Parliament, to reform the prudential regulation of the general insurance</p>
<p> industry.</p>
<p>Heads of Government also discussed the relationship between health and</p>
<p> aged care policies, and housing and noted that these issues are being</p>
<p> dealt with by respective Ministers.</p>
<p>Heads of Government noted the High Court decision (in Brodie v Singleton</p>
<p> Shire Council; Ghantous v Hawkesbury City Council, 31 May 2001) in relation</p>
<p> to the "highway rule" and agreed to commission the Australian Transport</p>
<p> Council to examine the implications of this decision and report back to</p>
<p> Heads of Government, out-of-session if required.</p>
