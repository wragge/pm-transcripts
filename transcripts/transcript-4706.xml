PRIME MRAINITE 11 May 1978<br />
INDEPENDENT INQUIRY INTO CSIRO<br />
Mr Speaker, I ask leave of the House to make a Statement<br />
concerning the Government's decisions on the recommendations<br />
of the Report of the Independent Inquiry into CSIRO.<br />
In 1976 a comprehensive review was initiated to see whether<br />
government programs for the development and coordination of<br />
Australia's science and technology effort were as effective<br />
as they might be. One inquiry established at that time<br />
concel~ ned the role of a permanent Australian Science and<br />
Technology Council, and as a result of that review, I<br />
introduced a Bill last month to establish ASTEC as a permanent<br />
and independent statutory authority.<br />
Honourable Members will be aware that in 1976 an Independent<br />
Committee of Inquiry was also established to review the objectives,<br />
structure and programs of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial<br />
Research Organisation. The members of the Inquiry were<br />
Professor Arthur Birch, Professor of Organic<br />
Chemistry at the Australian National University,<br />
Sir Cecil Looker, Former President of the<br />
Australian Associated Stock Exchanges, and<br />
Mr Russell Madigan, Chairman of Haxnmersley<br />
Holdings Limited.<br />
The Inquiry's Report was presented on 25 August last year and<br />
was tabled on 6 October 1977, ( Hansard, P. 1721).<br />
The Inquiry's Report included 122 recommendations.<br />
In considering these, the Government has been mindful of the<br />
important contribution which CSIRO has made to science and<br />
technology in Australia over the past fifty years.<br />
The Committee of Inquiry observed that " the world reputation<br />
of CSIRO is a source of pride and morale to its scientists,<br />
and to Australia" ( Page XI). If any reminder were needed of </p>
<p>the great contribution which CSIRO has made, it is sufficient<br />
to refer to the decision last month of the International Civil<br />
Aviation Organisation All Weather Operations Division to adopt<br />
internationally the INTERSCAN microwave aircraft landing system<br />
developed by CSIRO in collaboration with the Department of<br />
Transport. The structure of CSIRO was last reviewed and reorganised in<br />
1949. At that time CSIRO was employing 2500 persons in<br />
12 Divisions. It now employs 7,000 persons in 37 Divisions.<br />
In the light of the findings of the Inquiry and other advice<br />
available to the Government, it has been decided that CSIRO<br />
should again be substantially reorganised.<br />
CSIRO will remain a single multi-disciplinary research entity<br />
responsible to the Minister for Science but much of the day.<br />
to day management of CSIRO activities at present undertaken<br />
by the Executive, will be devolved to Directors of new<br />
functional groupings of Divisions to be called Institutes.<br />
Under the new arrangements, the Executive will concentrate<br />
on policy issues including the determination of research<br />
strategy and priorities. The Executive will be assisted in<br />
this task through revitalised advisory and consultative<br />
arrangements which I will outline shortly.<br />
The Executive of CSIRO will comprise a slightly smaller<br />
governing body than at present. There will be a Chairman,<br />
who will also be Chief Executive, and two other full-time.<br />
members together with between three and five part-time members.<br />
The full-time members may or may not be drawn from within CSIRO.<br />
The part-time members will all be drawn from outside the<br />
Organisation. The Government has agreed with the Committee of Inquiry that<br />
there be up to six Institutes created from within CSIRO,<br />
each headed by a very senior scientist as Director. Each<br />
Director will be appointed by the Executive for terms of up<br />
to five years, with provision for reappointment. Although<br />
the main role of the Institute Directors will be managerial,<br />
they will be actively consulted by the Executive in matters<br />
of policy.<br />
The Committee of Inquiry favoured Institute Directors being<br />
appointed by the Executive and holding office on the Executive<br />
in an ex-officio capacity, thereby providing a direct link<br />
between the work points of the Organisation and the Executive.<br />
The Government, however, after fully considering all aspects<br />
of this matter including advice received from ASTEC on the<br />
issue, has decided that Institute Directors should not be<br />
members of the Executive but should only have an advisory<br />
role. For the information of Honourable Members I table the<br />
advice dated 28 September 1977 which I received from ASTEC. </p>
<p>The Committee of Inquiry recognised that much of the<br />
success of CSIRO in the past can be attributed to a<br />
policy of leaving scientific decisions in the hands of<br />
scientists. The Government agrees with the Inquiry that<br />
this policy should remain unchanged, and accordingly, the<br />
basic research unit in CSIRO will continue to be the<br />
Division headed by a Chief of Division.<br />
The Inquiry drew attenthn in its Report to the importance<br />
of consultative machinery which could help the Executive<br />
to incorporate policy advice and the advice of users of<br />
research results in its determination of strategy and<br />
program priorities for CSIRO. Accordingly, the Advisory<br />
Council will be strengthened to enable it to act effectively<br />
as the major source of advice to the Executive. Its membership<br />
will be reorganised along the lines proposed by the Inquiry<br />
and will include representatives from a wide range of interests.<br />
It will be completely independent of the Executive of CSIRO,<br />
have its own Secretariat and members of the CSIRO Executive<br />
will not be members of the Council. It ; is envisaged that the<br />
Advisory Council will set up ad hoc work groups to investigate<br />
particular areas related to CSIRO activities. Advisory Council<br />
advice and initiatives will be incorporated in the CSIRO<br />
Annual Report.<br />
The Advisory Council will be linked with reconstituted State<br />
Committees, which will be the main source of advice to the<br />
Advisory Council. The State Committees will provide grass<br />
roots contact with industry, centres of education, and the<br />
community generally. Each of them will maintain close contacts<br />
with CSIRO Divisions in its own State. The Chairmen of the<br />
State Committees will be members of the Advisory Council. The<br />
Government will also be looking to CSIRO to encourage its<br />
scientists to take initiatives in broadening their own contacts<br />
both within the outside CSIRO, so that their contribution in the<br />
formulation of policies at the Institute level can be strengthened.<br />
I now turn to the research activities of CSIRO and its future<br />
role. The Government agrees with the Inquiry that the main<br />
role-of CSIRO should be defined more clearly in CSIRO'S<br />
constituting legislation, The Science and Industry Research<br />
Act 1949. Amending legislation which will be introduced in the<br />
Budget Sittings will make it clear that the main role for<br />
CSIRO will be scientific and technological research in support<br />
of Australian industry, community interests, and other<br />
perceived national objectives and obligations.<br />
CSIRO research for Australian industry will continue to incl. ude<br />
work in support of the rural and mining sectors, the manufacuring<br />
sector, the construction sector and the services sector, such as<br />
transport. CSIRO research will support such community interests<br />
as the better protection of our environment, flora and fauna,<br />
and consumer interests. </p>
<p>The Report of the Inquiry made a number of other<br />
recommendations on the scope and emphasis of CSIRO's<br />
research effort which the Government has accepted. The<br />
main concern of OSIRO research will continue to be the<br />
physical and biological sciences. The types of research<br />
to be undertaken will be longer term research for the<br />
community's benefit which industry and other research<br />
organisations are unable to carry out, and fundamental and<br />
short-term problem oriented research if it is related to<br />
the role of the Organisation.<br />
Research into economics and the other social sciences will<br />
not be undertaken, but steps are to be taken to utilise the<br />
requisite expertise from these fields in program conduct,<br />
evaluation and planning. Research in human medicine will not<br />
be a direct objective of CSIRO but research results in<br />
biological and physical sciences will be asseEsed for their<br />
possible significance and application in human medicine.<br />
Individual scientists will be encouraged to follow up their<br />
research as far as practical into the developmental stage.<br />
CSIRQ will have a major role in helping Australia meet its<br />
international obligations. For example, CSIRO will continue<br />
to undertake basic research, such as in astronomy,<br />
atmospheric physics and oceanography, to increase man's<br />
knowledge of the region in which we live.<br />
CSIRO will also assist the Government in meeting Australia's<br />
international obligations to developing countries. The Government<br />
is most conscious of the vital role that developing countries<br />
will increasingly play in world affairs and of our need<br />
constantly to review government policies to take this factor<br />
fully into account. To this end, the Government recently<br />
established a Committee to review Australia's relations with<br />
the Third World. Consistent with this policy approach, CSIRO<br />
will contribute to the scientific and technical needs of these<br />
countries as part of Australia's foreign aid program through<br />
work carried out both in Australia and abroad. CSIRO will also<br />
have the opportunity to contribute through other arrangements<br />
such as the Consultative Group on Energy established at the<br />
recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting in<br />
Sydney. In all its areas of research, CSIRO will have to ensure that<br />
it does not duplicate the research activities of other research<br />
institutions, undertaken or otherwise supported by the<br />
Commonwealth or State Governxoients. </p>
<p>CSIRO's autonomy in the setting of research project objectives<br />
will be maintained. Recognizing that CSIRO's activities must<br />
accord with the policies of the Government, the Birch Report<br />
has recommended ministerial discretion should also be maintained<br />
to be used as a last resort. The Government has accepted this<br />
recommendation and should ministerial discretion be employed it<br />
will be reported in CSIRO's Annual Report.<br />
The Government has accepted the Inquiry's recommendation that,<br />
through the application of the revised advisory and consultative<br />
machinery, current programs should be terminated where they are<br />
judged to be inappropriate. It has also been agreed that<br />
CSIRO should present, at appropriate intervals, the main<br />
thrusts of its broad policies and more detailed objectives<br />
for Government, Parliamentary and Community scrutiny.<br />
The Inquiry recommended that specific approval of the Minister<br />
should not be-required for CSIRO to enter into arrangements<br />
for the implementation of research results. The Government<br />
has decided that the implementation of research results should<br />
continue to be a function of CSIRO subject to a general power<br />
of the Minister to provide the Executive with guidelines.<br />
There are numerous further matters dealt with in the Report of<br />
the Committee of Inquiry. On many of these, the Government has<br />
reached a decision. On others, further examination is required<br />
and is currently being undertaken expeditiously. The Minister<br />
representing the Minister for Science will outline these<br />
matters in a separate Statement shortly.<br />
It is the Government's intention to implement as soon as<br />
possible the new organisation and Executive structure of<br />
CSIRO to facilitate the detailed implementation of the<br />
Government's decisions on the Inquiry's Report.<br />
I conclude by placing on record the Government's appreciation<br />
of the work done by the Members of the Inquiry, Professor<br />
Birch, Sir Cecil Looker and Mr Russell Madigan. Their<br />
contribution to the development of Australian science and<br />
technology policy in this Inquiry has been an outstanding one,<br />
made possible by their wide experience foresight and<br />
judgement.<br />
The Committee of Inqiury could not of course have carried<br />
out its work without advice from Commonwealth and State<br />
Government Departments, the many private companies and<br />
individuals who made submissions to the Inquiry, and of course<br />
members of CSIRO at all levels, who, the Committee noted in its<br />
Report, assisted the Inquiry with " courtesy, patience and<br />
frankness". </p>
<p>AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL ( ASTEC)<br />
Tel ephone: 72 5746 Post Office Box 52<br />
Canberra, A. C. T. 2600<br />
28 September, 1977.<br />
My dear Prime Minister,<br />
On 8 September 1977 you wrote to me requesting that<br />
the Australian Science and Technology Council comment to you<br />
by the end of September on the Report of the Independent Inquiry<br />
into the CSIRO. The Council' s Report is attached.<br />
ASTEC is in general agreement with the recommiendations<br />
of the Independent Inquiry. We believe that implementation of<br />
the recomendations requires only minim~ al amendme~ nts to the<br />
CSIRO Act, and that the majority of the reconmendations can be<br />
implemented by the CSIRO Executive. In this regard ASTEC<br />
considers that the legislation should provide substantial<br />
flexibility; in particular the composition of the Executive,<br />
and the duties of its members, should not be specified in<br />
detail in any new OSIRO legislation. In part, this is because<br />
ASTEC can see difficulties with the Executive structure proposed<br />
in the Independent Inquiry Report. AS TEC' s recommendations on<br />
this anid other mratters are presented in the attached Report.<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
G. M. Badger<br />
Chairman<br />
The Right Honourable Malcolm Fraser, CH, MP,<br />
Prime Minister,<br />
Parliament House,<br />
CANBERRA, A. C. T. 2600. </p>
<p>Composition of the Executive ( Inquiry Report, Reccommendation 29)<br />
1. ASTEC believes that the CSIRO should be allowed to make its own arrangemz-nts<br />
for its new executive structure, and not have detailed definition of the<br />
executive' s structure and functions in the legislation. ASTEC therefore<br />
reccommends that only the following should be specified in the legislation:-<br />
* There shall be six statutory members of the CSIRO executive, three<br />
full-tine and three part-time.<br />
* The six statutory members will be appointed by the Minister.<br />
* The three full-time members will be a Chairman, who is also Chief<br />
Executive of CSIRO, a Deputy Chairman, and one other member.<br />
* Full-time members will serve up to a seven-year term, with eligibility<br />
for re-appointment. Part-time menabers will serve a three-year term,<br />
with eligibility for re-appointment.<br />
* The Chairman shall have a deliberative vote at meetings and, in the<br />
event of equality of votes, a casting vote.<br />
* The Executive may appoint up to six associate ( non-voting) members of<br />
the Executive, from among the staff of CSIRIJ.<br />
2. ASTEC believes that the duties of the full-time members of the Executive<br />
should not be defined in legislation, as such duties may not suit the most<br />
able people available for appointment. ASTEC ' would expect that Directors<br />
of Institutes w~ ould normally be associate members of the Executive, but<br />
believes that this should not be a requiremlent of the legislation. ASIFC<br />
believes that it is inappropriate for Directors to be voting members of the<br />
Executive because of possible conflict of loyalties, but that they should<br />
take part in all discussions.<br />
Ministerial Responsibility for CSIRO ( Inquiry Report, R. 26)<br />
3. ASTEC reco2 nends that CSILK) report to the Minister for Science, not the<br />
Minister.<br />
CSIRO Advisory Council ( Inquiry Report,<br />
4. ASTEC reccommends that the CSIRO Advisory Council be set up in such a way as<br />
to provide the fullest possible advice to the Executive. This co-operative<br />
approach can be promoted in two ways:-<br />
The Executive should be obliged to seek the advice of the Advisory<br />
Council. Two full-time members of the Executive should attend Advisory Council<br />
meetings on a regular basis, as non-voting members.<br />
ASTEC believes that the composition of the Advisory Council should not be<br />
too closely defined in legislation. In particular, the Advisory Council<br />
structure suggested on page 69 of the Independent Inquiry' s Report should<br />
not be specified. The Chairman of the Advisory Council should be appointed<br />
by the Minister ( not elected by the members of the Advisory Council) and<br />
should not be a. member of the CSIRO Executive. Other manbers of the<br />
Advisory Council should also be appointed by the Minister. </p>
<p>6. ASTEC recommends against an ASTEC member being an ex officio member<br />
of the Advisory Council, but believes that attendance of an A= TE<br />
member from time to time at Advisory Council meetings is sufficient<br />
to maintain communication between the two bodies. The Chairman of<br />
the Advisory Council could also attend ASTEC meetings from time to time.<br />
CSIRO and Industry<br />
7. The role of CSIRO. ( Inquiry Report, R. 3) ASTEC believes that mo~ re<br />
Emphasis on the application of research results, and of existing<br />
knowledge, especially to the problems of industry, would be desirable.<br />
AST= recommnends that, in reshaping the powers and functions of the<br />
CSIRO, Section of the current Act should be amended to read:<br />
* The initiation and carrying out of scientific<br />
researches and investigations<br />
and<br />
* the development and application of science and<br />
technology in connexion with, or for the promotion of Australian<br />
industry, community interests and other perceived<br />
national objectives and obligations, or in connexion<br />
with any other matter referred to the Organization by<br />
the Minister"<br />
8. As a corollary, the title of the Act should be amended to reflect this.<br />
9. Research Associations. ( Inquiry Report R. 14,67) AS IEC agrees that the<br />
legislation should be amended to restrict CSIRO funding of research<br />
associations to specific contracts. ASTEC does not necessarily concur<br />
with Recotmmendat ion 67 that the Department of Productivity may be the<br />
mo~ st appropriate agency for promnotion of all research associations.<br />
The question of research associations needs further investigation,<br />
especially in the light of current inquiries into Industrial research<br />
and development by ASTE and the Senate Standing C~ mittee on Science<br />
and the Environment. ASTEC will report in more detail in the near<br />
future, and for the time being recoirmends that Departmental responsibility<br />
for research associations should not be assigned.<br />
Selection of Industrial Partners for Developmnent. ( Inquiry Report R. 109)<br />
ASTEC agrees that CSIRO should have power to select private firms for<br />
developmnent of research results, and reconnmnds; that CSIRO should be<br />
able to enter into arrangements with a private firm for joint developmnent<br />
of CSIRO' s research results. If this reccommendation is to be<br />
effective in practice, CSIRO must have power to enter into confidential<br />
contracts and this power should be provided by amendments to the<br />
Act.<br />
CSIRO's Financial and Manpower Budgets<br />
11. GSIRO's activities already represent a large proportion of Australian<br />
scientific activity. As any major growth in CSIRO's total manpower or<br />
expenditure could lead to distortion in Australia's research effort,<br />
CSIROI's total budget and manpower ceiling should be strictly controlled.<br />
The period of implementat ion of the Independent Inquiry' s Report should<br />
be one of re-assessment of programs, and of the termination of<br />
inappropriate programs to make way for new initiatives ( Inquiry Report<br />
R. 23). </p>
