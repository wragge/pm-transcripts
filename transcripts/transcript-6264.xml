PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 18 NOVEMBER 1983<br />
KAKA DU<br />
The Federal Government has decided to declare Stage 2 of<br />
Kakadu National Park in accordance with the provisions of<br />
the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975. In<br />
addition a notice of intent to prepare a report recommending<br />
declaration of Gimbat and Goodparla pastoral leases as<br />
part of Kakadu National Park will be published by the<br />
Director of National Parks and Wildlife.<br />
In taking these steps, the Government is implementing<br />
recommendations made by the Ranger Uranium Environmental<br />
Inquiry in respect of Kakadu National Park. Of particular<br />
importance is the inclusion in the Park of virtually the<br />
whole South Alligator River Catchment, with its<br />
internationally significant wetlands.<br />
In moving to include Gimbat and Goodparla in the Park the<br />
Government is conscious that the lessees have been aware for<br />
a long time of this possibility. The Government will seek<br />
to acquire the two leases.<br />
Serious consideration has been given to the position of the<br />
Northern Territory Government which has stressed the<br />
importance to its economy of mining, particularly in the<br />
Alligator Rivers Region. It is the view of the Conmmonwealth<br />
that appropriate tourist development in Kakadu National Park<br />
will generate a major long term increase in job opportunities<br />
and increase significantly revenue to the Northern Territory.<br />
The area is already a major tourist attraction, and the proposed<br />
developments will need to be undertaken in such a way as to<br />
ensure the protection of the natural and cultural values of<br />
the Park and be sensitive to Aboriginal interests.<br />
A basic program of development for Stage 2 will include work<br />
on basic park infrastructure, such as power and water supplies<br />
and service roads, as well as provision of some essential<br />
visitor facilities. The Minister for Homze Affairs and<br />
Environment, the Hon. Barry Cohen, will be discussing with<br />
the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the Northern Territory<br />
Government and Aboriginal groups an augmented program of<br />
development of visitor facilities and park infrastructure </p>
<p>in the Klikadu National Park over the he(-xt six years, brinjiiig<br />
forward the introduIction of recreation facilities providing<br />
for busThwalking, nature observation and water-based activities.<br />
These visitor facilities will he developed to ensure that<br />
visitors are able to enjoy the Park better while niot<br />
endangering its natural and cultuial treasures.<br />
This program will put millions of dollars annually into the<br />
Northern Territory economy and open up major employment and<br />
economic opportunities, especially for Aboriginal people.<br />
Details of the program will he announced after Mr Cohen has<br />
completed his discussions and the Government has had an<br />
opportunity to consider specific proposals.<br />
Subject to negotiations with the Northern Territory Government<br />
and Aboriginal groups, an additional expenditure of the order of<br />
$ 36 million over six years is envisaged under the accelerated<br />
development program.<br />
This, together with the associated private sector expenditures<br />
on tourism, would generate very substantial numbers of new<br />
permanent jobs over the next decade and beyond.<br />
