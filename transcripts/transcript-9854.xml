PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J ] KEATING MP<br />
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES-WEDNESDAY 22 NOVEMBER 1995<br />
APEC This was the third meeting of leaders of the APEC economies.<br />
The process began with the meeting hosted by President Clinton in Seattle in<br />
1993 following a proposal I had made orally and in correspondence with the<br />
other APEC leaders. It continued with the historic meeting chaired by<br />
President Soeharto in Indonesia a year ago, which produced the Bogor<br />
Declaration. In that declaration the APEC economies committed themselves to<br />
the goal of free and open trade in the Asia-Pacific at the latest by 20 10 for<br />
industrialised countries, and 2020 for developing countries.<br />
The Bogor goals were unprecedented and audacious. The challenge for APEC<br />
this year was to put in place at Osaka a plan of action which would show how<br />
the goals could be implemented.<br />
I believe the result was an outstanding success. The plan of action and Leaders'<br />
declaration met all Australia's aims and have firmly cemented APEC as the key<br />
regional body for co-ordinating the development and growth of the Asia Pacific<br />
into the next century.<br />
It has provided a framework which will ensure Australia's continuing and deeper<br />
integration into the dynamic region around us with all the economic, political and<br />
strategic benefits which follow from that.<br />
It is of deep and long-run significance to Australia.<br />
At Osaka, the 18 APEC economies, which already account for 60 per cent of the<br />
world's GDP and half its trade, renewed their commitment what the Leaders'<br />
declaration describes as their ' unwavering resolve' to free and open trade and<br />
investment in the APEC region by 20 10/ 2020. </p>
<p>The Osaka action agenda sets out the principles which will underpin the process<br />
of trade liberalisation and trade facilitation in the Asia-Pacific. The eight<br />
principles we have set down include WTO consistency, comparability,<br />
non-discrimination, transparency, standstill, and a comumitmient to move together<br />
in the liberalisation process.<br />
But a central principle for Australia is comprehensive coverage of all sectors and<br />
issues. This means that agriculture is firmly on the APEC agenda. This was one<br />
of the most difficult issues we faced during the year. But as I told Prime Minister<br />
Murayama, MITI Minister Hashimoto and Foreign Minister Kono in several<br />
meetings over the past twelve months, it was an acid test of APEC's relevance<br />
not only to Australia but to developing agricultural producers like Thailand and<br />
Indonesia. This is a real win for Australian farmers because it enables them to plan<br />
confidently for the opening up of the vast market around us and brings closer our<br />
vision of Australia as a global supplier of food.<br />
In addition to the principles a process was agreed for liberalisation. Leaders<br />
directed ministers and officials to immediately begin the preparation of ' concrete<br />
and substantive' Action Plans to be submitted to the 1996 Ministerial Meeting in<br />
the Philippines for assessment. Overall implementation of the plans will begin in<br />
January 1997, with annual reviews and improvements thereafter. The plans will<br />
be most detailed for the early years, but will stretch through to the 20 10/ 2020 end<br />
dates. We have got the two key things right about APEC.<br />
First, we know where we are going. We have decided on the end point we want<br />
reach free and open trade and investment in the APEC region and we have a<br />
process for getting there concerted liberalisation.<br />
This is an entirely new model for global trade liberalisation. It does not depend<br />
on the legalistic and adversarial approach of traditional trade rounds in which the<br />
incentive for negotiators was to keep their best cards in their pockets, ensuring<br />
that offers were therefore grudging and incomplete. It substitutes instead a new<br />
form of concerted individual movement in which peer pressure and self interest<br />
will work hand in hand to maintain progress towards goals which have already<br />
been set.<br />
The second thing we have right in APEC is the regular involvement of leaders.<br />
Their meetings give the process an authority and drive which could never be<br />
matched by meetings of Ministers alone. Their engagement invests the outcome<br />
of the annual discussions with a weight and authenticity which keeps it moving<br />
forward. </p>
<p>The APEC process marks a very significant new development in trade<br />
negotiations. I suspect it is likely to prove much more relevant to the sort of<br />
global economy which is now developing: one in which Asian countries have an<br />
increasingly significant economic role; in which many more states need to be<br />
engaged in the process and have an stake in the outcome; and in which the role of<br />
developing countries like China and Indonesia Will become more central.<br />
One of APEC's greatest values as an institution is that it is a practical example of<br />
North-South cooperation. It provides a framework for developed and developing<br />
economies to work together to liberalise and facilitate trade and investment and<br />
to promote economic and technical cooperation. It has been fundamental to the<br />
whole APEC outcome that President Soeharto the leader of one of the world's<br />
largest developing countries has been one of the driving forces behind<br />
liberalisation. Leaders did not only talk about principles and process at Osaka. They delivered<br />
a package of initial actions a ' downpayment' on their Uruguay Round<br />
commitmnents which demonstrates beyond question APEC's seriousness of<br />
purpose. For example, Japan announced the acceleration by approximately two years of its<br />
Uruguay Round tariff reduction commitments on items affecting trade worth<br />
billion as well as a substantial package of deregulation measures.<br />
China announced that it would substantially reduce tariffs on over 4,000 tariff<br />
lines and will eliminate import control measures on about 170 tariff lines. The<br />
other APEC members, including Indonesia, all put good contributions on the<br />
table. Through these downpayments APEC has managed to do something the G7<br />
members could not bring themselves to do earlier this year. APEC has become<br />
the principal catalyst for global trade liberalisation.<br />
At the Osaka meeting we urged other WTO members to match APEC's efforts.<br />
We also agreed to hold a meeting of APEC trade ministers next year to consider<br />
joint initiatives in advance of the first ministerial meeting of the WTO which will<br />
be held in December 1996 in Singapore.<br />
In addition to these trade liberalisation measures, a number of important trade<br />
facilitation measures are to be taken. For example, APEC will introduce a<br />
common harmonised system of tariff classifications by 1996, an internationally<br />
agreed standard electronic customs message system by 1999 and pilot mutual<br />
recognition agreements in the area of standards by 1997. </p>
<p>These are important benefits for the business community. Customs procedures<br />
alone can add 10 per cent to the cost of doing business and although tariffs in<br />
some parts of the APEC region remain high, the main impediments for many of<br />
our businesses are in the non-tariff area.<br />
The APEC leaders also acknowledged the vital work the business sector must<br />
play in APEC's work by agreeing to the recommendation from the<br />
Pacific Business Forum that we establish a permanent APEC Business Advisory<br />
Council, with its members to be appointed directly by leaders.<br />
I want to acknowledge here the outstanding work which Australia's<br />
representatives on the Pacific Business Forum, Ms [ melda Roche of Nutrimetics<br />
and Mr Philip Brass of Pacific Dunlop, have done for Australia and for the APEC<br />
region, and to thank them on the Government's behalf.<br />
The Emin~ ent Persons' Group has also made a very valuable contribution to<br />
APEC's development work, and I again thank Mr Neville Wran for all his work<br />
over the past three years<br />
I announced during the Osaka meeting that in response to one of the<br />
recommendations of the Pacific Business Forumi Australia will introduce a<br />
business travel card to facilitate regional travel by accredited business people.<br />
We have also proposed that other APEC economies join us in this scheme. This<br />
will help greatly to facilitate the freer movement of business people around the<br />
region. The long-term benefits of APEC's trade liberalisation and facilitation are<br />
enormous. Recent modelling work by the Office of National Assessments and<br />
the Industry Commission backs up earlier conclusions and suggests that, when<br />
the full effects of the Bogor commitments have flowed through, the income of<br />
APEC members will increase by 3.8 per cent or USD 745 billion more than the<br />
current size of the Australian and Korean economies combined.<br />
Australians will benefit directly and substantially from this process. The initial<br />
results of the most recent modelling shows that Australia's real income will rise<br />
by 6.8 per cent or $ 40 billion when all the effects have flowed through, and that<br />
growth of this order can be expected to generate around 500,000 new jobs over<br />
the course of the liberalisation period.<br />
These revised figures on the benefits to Australia which are the result of more<br />
comprehensive modelling, are substantially higher than those I gave the House in<br />
the statement I made after the Bogor Declaration.<br />
Most of the focus on APEC has concentrated on its trade liberalisation<br />
dimensions. These are central to APEC's work and are vital to the region's<br />
contnung prosperity. </p>
<p>But APEC also has a number of other dimensions, including its important work<br />
in areas like education and training, science and technology, small and medium<br />
enterprises, transportation, telecommunications, tourism, economic policy and<br />
sustainable development.<br />
Cooperation in these areas is expanding quickly and we are seeing the<br />
development of much more intensive sets of linkages between APEC<br />
governments and businesses in all these new areas.<br />
One of APEC's major tasks and one which was recognised by all the leaders at<br />
Osaka will be to keep resources flowing to the rapidly growing East Asian<br />
economies, especially China, as the region's unprecedented growth continues.<br />
For example, East Asia's demand for energy is doubling every 12 years compared<br />
with the world average of 28 years.<br />
China's demand for grains is growing so fast that its estimated shortage within<br />
years could be three to six times Australia's total annual wheat production.<br />
APEC's infrastructure requirements over the next decade are likely to require<br />
US $ 2 trillion, of which well over US $ 500 billion will have to come from the<br />
private sector.<br />
The way we handle these requirements will affect not only the region's prosperity<br />
but its security in the first part of the next century.<br />
I said at the leaders meeting that Australia was ready to address the concerns<br />
which Japan, Korea and China have expressed about meeting their food needs. I<br />
suggested the creation of an APEC task force on food and agribusiness to<br />
examine regional food challenges into the next century. I will be writing shortly<br />
to my colleagues about this proposal.<br />
If the Bogor commitments are fully implemented, by the year 2020 APEC will<br />
account for more than three quarters of global production and three quarters of<br />
the world's trade. ASEAN's per capita incomes will be five times their current<br />
level. One enormously beneficial consequence of the establishment of these APEC<br />
meetings is the opportunity it provides for closer contact between regional<br />
leaders. In addition to the discussions in the leaders meeting itself, I was able to<br />
hold very useful bilateral discussions with President Kim Young Sam of Korea,<br />
President Soeharto of Indonesia, President Zedillo of Mexico,<br />
President Jiang Zemin of China, Prime Minister Murayama of Japan,<br />
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong of Singapore, Prime Minister Banharn of </p>
<p>Thailand, Prime Minister Bolger of New Zealand and Vice President Gore of the<br />
United States.<br />
This meeting was a very great success for Prime Minister Murayania and the<br />
Japanese government especially MITI Minister Hashimoto and<br />
Foreign Minister Kono who were most directly involved. Japan's leadership was<br />
very important in helping to shape this outstanding result and I congratulate them<br />
on it.<br />
I feel very confident that President Ramos of the Philippines, who will chair<br />
APEC in 1996, will continue this work. I have offered him any assistance<br />
Australia can provide.<br />
I also take this opportunity to mention the collaborative work of officials from<br />
the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Foreign<br />
Affairs and Trade who have worked very hard and very effectively, including<br />
with their colleagues in other APEC countries, to help bring about this excellent<br />
result. I suggested last year after the Bogor meeting that the establishment and<br />
development of APEC would rank with the establishment of the structures which<br />
grew from the Bretton Woods agreement after the Second World War as a model<br />
to serve the interests of a new world. After the meeting in Osaka I am more<br />
than ever convinced of the truth of this.<br />
Australia can feel well pleased with APEC's progress and our own central role in<br />
developing it. </p>
