SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER OPENING OF FIFTH BIENNALE<br />
OF SYDNEY 10' APRIL 1984' SYDNEY<br />
I THANK THE COMMITTEE OF THIS FIFTH BIENNALE OF-SYDNEY FOR<br />
GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND AND TO OPEN' THE<br />
EXHIBITION.-WISH PARTICULARLY TO COMPLIMENT THE<br />
COMMITTEE'S CHAIRMAN MR FRANCO BELGIORNO-NETTIS.<br />
FRANCO'S DRIVE, COURAGE AND FORESIGHT HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL<br />
IN ESTABLISHING THE BIENNALE OF SYDNEY As AUSTRALIA'S MAJOR<br />
EXHIBITION OF CONTEMPORARY ART AND AN ARTISTIC GATHERING<br />
OF INTERNATIONAL SIGNIFICANCEYOU<br />
COULD SAY THAT HE AND HIS COMPANY, TRANSFIELD, CHOSE NOT<br />
TO TAKE THE SOFT OPTION IN ART PATRONAGE. Too OFTEN IT IS<br />
LEFT To GOVERNMENTS TO FUND THE NEW,-THE INNOVATORY SO THAT<br />
PRIVATE PATRONAGE MIGHT PLAY SAFE.<br />
IN SAYING THAT I DO NOT DECRY THE EFFORTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS<br />
OF OTHER PRIVATE SECTOR SPONSORS WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO SUPPORT<br />
A RANGE OF DIFFERENT ARTISTIC ACTIVITIES. THEIR SUPPORT IN<br />
RECENT YEARS HAS GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY AND IS VERY DESIRABLE<br />
AND HEALTHY. No,-I MERELY WISH TO GIVE SPECIAL CREDIT TO<br />
THOSE WHO ARE WILLING TO SHOW CONFIDENCE IN BACKING THE NEW,<br />
THE UNFAMILIAR, AND THE SOMETIMES UNPREDICTABLE. COMMUNITY<br />
PARTICIPATION IN SUCH ENTERPRISES IS AFTER ALL IMPORTANTEMBARGOED<br />
AGAINST DELIVECHECK AGAINST DELIVERY </p>
<p>GOVERNMENTS, OF COURSE, ARE EXPECTED TO AND SHOULD E-NCOURAGE<br />
THE FULL RANGE OF ARTISTIC ACTIVITIES THE ESTABLISHED, THE<br />
INNOVATIVE, THE MINORITY ART-IT IS THEREFORE ENTIRELY<br />
PROPER THAT THE THE'AUSTRALIA COUNCIL SHOULD HAVE<br />
FINANCIALLY SUPPORTED THE BIENNALE, AND THAT THE EXHIBITION<br />
' THE MODERNS", WHICH HAS JUST MADE WAY FOR THE BIENNALE IN<br />
THIS GALLERY, SHOULD HAVE BEEN INDEMNIFIED BY THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT WHILE IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
ONE MIGHT SAY THAT IN THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBL. E WORLDS A<br />
SOCIETY SHOULD SPONTANEOUSLY NURTURE ITS OWN ART AND<br />
ARTISTS. INDEED, THERE IS NO INTRINSIC REASON WHY<br />
GOVERNMENTS SHOULD HAVE TO INVOLVE THEMSELVES DIRECTLY WITH<br />
PROMOTION OF THE ARTSBUT<br />
THAT THIS STAGE HAS NOT YET BEEN REACHED WAS BROUGHT<br />
HOME TO US ALL BY THE RECENT REPORT TO THE AUSTRALIA COUNCIL<br />
' THE ARTIST IN AUSTRALIA TODAY'. THAT REPORT IDENTIFIES<br />
MANY DIFFICULTIES WITH WHICH THE AUSTRALIAN ARTS COMMUNITY<br />
MUST CONTEND-WHAT COMES THROUGH QUITE CLEARLY AND THE<br />
REPORT HAS HIGHLIGHTED IS THE NEED TO IMPROVE RECOGNITION<br />
OF THE PROFESSIONAL STATUS OF THE ARTIST BY OTHER SECTIONS<br />
OF SOCIETY-</p>
<p>3.<br />
AT ONE LEVEL THIS MEANS PROVIDING VISIBLE SUPPORT FOR~<br />
CULTURAL AND ARTISTIC ENDEAVOUR. IT ALSO MEANS RECOGNISING<br />
THAT ARTISTS ARE WORKERS, AND AS SUCH, ARE ENTITLED TO<br />
RECEIVE A FAIR LIVING WAGE, EARNED BY THEIR EFFORTS WHICH<br />
GIVE OUR DAILY L-IVES STIMULATION AND PLEASURE.<br />
QUITE DELIBERATELY THE GoVERNEMNT HAS PROVIDED : SUBSTANTIAL<br />
ASSISTANCE UNDER THE COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM FOR THOSE<br />
COMMITTED TO ARTISTIC AND CULTURAL ENDEAVOURS. IT SEES SUCH<br />
SUPPORT AS BEING IMPORTANT TO FULFILLING THE * GOVERNMENT' S<br />
AIMS IN THIS AREATHE<br />
REPORT TO THE AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL ALSO ALLUDES TO THE<br />
DOUBLE BIND WITH WHICH THE ARTS COMMUNITY MUST WRESTLE-IN<br />
THIS ANALYSIS, THE ARTS COMMUNITY FOR ITS PART IS SEEN AS<br />
WANTING TO BE GIVEN A FAIR GO TO RECEIVE CREDIT AND ESTEEM<br />
FROM SOCIETY EQUAL TO ITS CONTRIBUTION TO BE ACCEPTED<br />
WITHIN THE COMMUNITY FOR THE VALUE OF THE CONTRIBUTION IT<br />
MAKES. THE ARTIST, HOWEVER, ALSO WANTS RECOGNITION THAT HE<br />
OR SHE IS IDIFFERENT I AND HAS A RESPONSIBILITY, COMPULSION<br />
FOR CHALLENGING SOCIETY, ILLUMINATING ITS SHORTCOMINGS,<br />
QUESTIONING ITS VALUES AND ASSUMPTIONS.<br />
AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND I WOULD SUGGEST THERE IS A<br />
RESPONSIBILITY DEVOLVING PARTICULARLY ON THE COMMUNITY TO<br />
RECOGNISE AND TO UNDERSTAND THE PREDICAMENT OF THE ARTISTWHETHER<br />
IT CAN EVER BE RESOLVED IS ANOTHER MATTER-</p>
<p>4.<br />
GOVERNMENT ACKNOWLEDGES ARTISTS AS ESSENTIAL MEMBERS'. OF<br />
SOCIETY AND SEES THE NEED TO HELP PROVIDE AN ENVIRONMENT IN<br />
WHICH THEIR CONTRIBUTION IS RECOGNISED AND THEIR<br />
INDEPENDENCE RESPECTED. HELPING ARTISTS TO FUNCTION<br />
EFFECTIVELY IS ONE OBJECTIVE. ANOTHER IS TO ASSIST THE<br />
GENERAL COMMUNITY TO RECOGNISE, TO EVALUATE, THE ARTISTS'<br />
CONTRIBUTIONTHE EXCELLENT REPORT TO THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT BY ITS<br />
FEDERAL CULTURAL POLICY REVIEW COMMITTEE PUT JT QUITE WELL-<br />
" THE BEST TEST OF AN ARTIST'S WORK LIES IN ITS EXPOSURE TO<br />
THE CULTURAL GAZE OF DISCRIMINATING AUDIENCES. AUDIENCES<br />
HAVE TO BE DISCRIMINATING IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE ARTIST<br />
WITH CONSTRUCTIVE RESPONSES. AND AUDIENCES NEED TO BE OPEN Nf<br />
TO NEW EXPERIENCES IN ORDER THAT ORIGINAL WORK MAY EMERGE<br />
NEARER HOME, MY COLLEAGUE BARRY COHEN RECENTLY PUT SOMETHING<br />
OF THE SPIRIT OF THIS PROPOSITION TO HIS STATE COUNTERPARTS<br />
AT THE FEBRUARY CULTURAL MINISTERS' CONFERENCE-IN HIS<br />
SUCCINCT WORDS " IT IS OUR BUSINESS TO STIMULATE THE<br />
IMAGINATIVE ASPECTS OF PEOPLE S LIVES HE WENT ON TO<br />
STRESS THE IMPORTANT CATALYTIC ROLE SCHOOLS COULD PLAY IN<br />
THIS PROCESS-</p>
<p>THERE IS A NEED TO CREATE A BROAD BASE OF SKILLS IN-O-UR<br />
YOUNG PEOPLE-NOT ONLY DO THEY NEED TO BE GIVEN THE SKILLS<br />
TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR WORLD OF INCREASING TECHNOLOGY AND<br />
RAP. ID CHANGE BUT EMPHASIS MUST ALSO BE PLACED ON THE<br />
HUMANITIES IN THE EDUCATION PROCESSYOUNG<br />
PEOPLE MUST BE EQUIPPED WITH AN OPENNESS QF MIND) AND<br />
EXPRESSION, ESSENTIAL IN A. HEALTHY PLURALISTIC SOCIETYESSENTIAL<br />
FOR RESPONDING APPROPRIATELY TO CHALLENGING IDEAS<br />
WHETHER THESE ARISE FROM WITHIN THE ARTS OR SOME OTHER AREA<br />
OF SOCIETY'IS ACTIVITIESI<br />
HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO USE THE WORD ' CONSENSUS' FROM TIME TO<br />
TIME WHEN REFERRING TO THE MIDDLE GROUND WHERE CONTENDING<br />
GROUPS SHOULD MEET WHEN CONFLICT OF INTERESTS SURFACES. IN<br />
THE ARTS I WOULD MAKE AN EXCEPTION IN FACT WE SHOULD ALL<br />
BE A LITTLE WORRIED IF THERE IS TOO MUCH I CONSENSUS I AND NOT<br />
A LITTLE CONTROVERSY IN THIS AREAIT<br />
WOULD BE A POINT OF SOME CONCERN FOR ANY SOCIETY IF IT<br />
FAILED TO RESPOND EITHER POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY TO<br />
WHAT ITS ARTISTS ARE SAYING, OR IF THE ATTITUDE IF YOU<br />
DON T LIKE IT IGNORE IT IBECAME TOO PREVALENT-IF YOU<br />
DON'T LIKE IT, THE ARTIST SHOULD EXPECT US TO SAY SO, AND<br />
MORE IMPORTANTLY TO ASK OURSELVES WHY NOT'? INDIFFERENCE<br />
WOULD BETOKEN A SOCIETY BEREFT OF SPIRIT-</p>
<p>6.<br />
PARADOXICALLY IT MAY WELL BE THE VERY TIME WHEN THE ' ARTIST'S<br />
MESSAGE SHOULD BE HEEDED MOST THAT A SOCIETY FEELS<br />
COMPLACENT ENOUGH TO IGNORE ITTHERE<br />
IS A PARTICULAR DANGER OF THIS SITUATION ARISING IN<br />
MODERN SOCIETIES WHERE TECHNOLOGY HAS GKVEN THE-MASS MEDIA<br />
TREMENDOUS INFLUENCE IN FRAMING A SOCIETY'S ATTITUDES.<br />
THIS INFLUENCE IS NOT MACHIAVELLIAN, NOT PURPOSEFULLY<br />
PLANNED IT IS INHERENT IN THE FORM. TELEVISION FOR<br />
EXAMPLE VERY OFTEN WILL MIX IN APPARENTLY HAPPY<br />
JUXTAPOSITION THE CATACLYSMIC AND THE BANAL THE VITAL AND<br />
THE TRIVIAL. THE IMPORTANT ISSUE MAY SO EASILY BE IGNORED<br />
BY FIXING ON A SIDELIGHT, AN IRRELEVANCY-IF VAN GOGH, FOR<br />
EXAMPLE, WERE A TV STUDIO GUEST, I FEEL THERE WOULD BE AN<br />
IRRESISTIBLE TEMPTATION TO FOCUS ON HIS ' EARS RATHER THAN<br />
HIS ART<br />
NEVERTHELESS, I AM OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR<br />
SOCIETY ART, TECHNOLOGY AND ALL-AM OPTIMISTIC ABOUT<br />
THE PART OUR ARTS COMMUNITY WILL PLAY. THIS IS BASED ON THE<br />
FINE ACHIEVEMENTS IN SO MANY AREAS OF THE ARTS BY SO MANY<br />
TALENTED AUSTRALIANS-</p>
<p>7. 9<br />
ITHINK WE SHOULD ALL BE VERY EXCITED BY THE OPPORTUN-IT IES<br />
AUSTRALIANS HAVE TO GIVE BACK PROGRESSIVELY MORE TO THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL ART HERITAGE FROM WHICH WE HAVE SO EAGERLY<br />
BORROWED-WE ARE BEING INCREASINGLY BLESSED BY THE<br />
INCORPORATION INTO OUR LIVES OF A WEALTH OF INFLUENCES OF<br />
DIVERSE AND RICH CULTURES FROM SO MANY PARTS OF THE** WORLD.<br />
BY DRAWING ON THIS RICHNESS.. AND DIVERSITY AUSTRALIA HAS THE<br />
CHANCE TO PROJECT A UNIQUE IMAGE AND VOICE THROUGHOUT THE<br />
WORLDIT IS, HOWEVER, ON THIS FIFTH BIENNALE OF SYDNEY THAT WE NOW<br />
FOCUS OUR ATTENTION-WE WELCOME THE OVERSEAS ART FRATERNITY<br />
WHO WILL SHARE IT WITH US AND HELP TO MAKE IT LIVE-IT IS<br />
NOT A STATIC, STERILE EXHIBITION, BUT SOMETHING LIVING, AN<br />
OCCASION WHEN THE FULL FORCE OF CONTEMPORARY ARTISTIC<br />
EXPRESSION IS BROUGHT INTO CLOSE FOCUSI<br />
AM PLEASED ALSO THAT IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF THE<br />
EXHIBITION WILL SUBSEQUENTLY TOUR SO THAT SOME OF THE SPIRIT<br />
OF THE BIENNALE CAN BE EXPERIENCED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRYTHE<br />
BIENNALE THEME IS PRIVATE SYMBOL/ SOCIAL METAPHOR AND IN<br />
FORMALLY OPENING THE EXHIBITION I INVITE THE COMMUNITY TO<br />
COME AND SEEK OUT THE SYMBOLS AND METAPHORS; TO CONFRONT<br />
THEM AND BE CONFRONTED BY-THEM; BUT, ABOVE ALL, To ENJOY AND<br />
BE STIMULATED BY THE VITALITY OF THE BIENNALE. </p>
