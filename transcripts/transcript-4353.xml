-1A1U STRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 23 MARCH 1977<br />
AUSTRALIAN REPRESENTATION IN WESTERN SAMOA<br />
The Prime Minister said today that amongst the matters he<br />
had discussed with the visiting Prime Minister of Western Samoa,<br />
Tupuola Efi, had been the proposed establishment of an<br />
Australian High Commission in Apia. Tupuola Efi had warmly<br />
welcomed the proposed Australian mission, which he said would<br />
greatly strengthen the existing close links between Australia<br />
and Western Samoa, by affording a direct channel of conmunication<br />
between the two Governments.<br />
A firm date has not yet been set for opening the mission, but it<br />
will be operational in the 1977/ 78 f. nancial year.<br />
The Prime Minister said that the opening of a post in Apia would<br />
be a further step in the Government's continuing efforts to<br />
intensify Australia's relations with the countries of the South<br />
Pacific, both bilaterally and through such regional organisations<br />
as the South Pacific Forum and the South Pacific Commission.<br />
In addition to its general role in developing Australian relations<br />
with Western Samoa, the post would assist with the implementation<br />
of the Australian aid programme and provide consular services<br />
in respect of Australian residents, visitors and tourists.<br />
