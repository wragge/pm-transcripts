    <content><![CDATA[<p>Thank you, Sussan.</p>
<p>Women’s sport does matter and today I’m pleased and proud to say that women’s sport takes centre court here in our national Parliament.</p>
<p>Today we salute our world champion netball team – the Diamonds!</p>
<p>Not only the Commonwealth Games medallists, but World Cup winners thanks to an absolutely thrilling victory over New Zealand.</p>
<p>And that thanks to you – the Diamonds – Australia has now won 11 of 14 netball World Cups.</p>
<p>As your captain, Laura Geitz, said, it is "Bloody sensational".</p>
<p>I have to say that the team showed tremendous character to come back from an early defeat and tremendous grit personified by your vice-captain, Julie Corletto, playing the second half of the final with a broken foot.</p>
<p>And Julie is, as we speak, at the orthopaedic surgeon to get fixed up.</p>
<p>With a million players, netball rivals Australian Rules as our national winter sport.</p>
<p>But, it has remained a grass roots game, without the big licensed clubs, without the massive corporate sponsorships, netballers – even champions – don't play for material reward but for the thrill of competition and the love of being the very best that you can be.</p>
<p>I have to say to our Diamonds today, that we in this Parliament admire you.</p>
<p>We absolutely admire you and we have even, in our own way, tried to emulate you with a team called the Owls – the parliamentary netball team. You may not have heard but they did take on New Zealand. What turned out to be a stacked New Zealand team. You can't trust those Kiwis. It was a New Zealand parliamentary team stacked with Silver Ferns, so if any of you are invited to apply for pre-selection, it is to improve the quality of the Owls around this place.</p>
<p>In the Abbott household, netball is a family passion. My girls played, my wife coached and I cheered.</p>
<p>Yes, Sussan, I have long been a netball dad, but today I am very proud to be a netball Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Well done, Diamonds!</p>
<p>Sporting success does help to lift our national morale and thanks to you our spirits have soared.</p>
