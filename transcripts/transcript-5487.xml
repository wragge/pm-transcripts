-r-4 PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 23 198')<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Now that the Federal election results have been finalised,<br />
Australia's 32nd Parliament will assemble next Tuesday for its<br />
official opening by the Governor General.<br />
The constitution requires that after any general election,<br />
the Parliament will be summoned to meet not later than 30 days<br />
after the day appointed for the return of the writs. However,<br />
apart from this constitutional requirement, it was the<br />
Government's vidw that a Parliamentary sitting before Christmas<br />
would provide an opportunity for us to get on with the job.<br />
Because the Australian people once again returned my Government<br />
with a substantial majority, we are naturally keen to implement<br />
those commitments which were outlined in my election policy speech<br />
as soon as possible.<br />
An important priority of course is to continue the fight against<br />
inflation. It remains our belief that an improvement in econonT-ic<br />
growth is the most effective way to reduce unemployment.<br />
An important priority of the Government as we enter another<br />
term of office is assistance to Australia's youth, especially<br />
those who are having difficulty finding a job. We have a very<br />
real desire to enable youth to articulate its concerns, and to<br />
take note of that voice. We are also expressing our commitment<br />
to youth through our educational initiatives for those who<br />
are about to leave school and are seeking to join the work force.<br />
It is a difficult time for all young people, and we firmly bel~ ieve<br />
that all possible assistance must be given to educate our young<br />
people for the future. After all, Australia's future lies in<br />
the hands of the young men and women of today. Attention is being<br />
directed in particular to those whose orientation is less academic<br />
and who may leave school early. With this in mind, we have<br />
introduced the School-to-Work Transition programme with a<br />
Commonwealth commitment of $ 150 million over the next five years.,<br />
Young people are being offered a range of options in education<br />
and training as real, meaningful alternatives to the academic<br />
stream, and the Government has further boosted its efforts to<br />
assist young people in making the important st-ep from school<br />
to work by announcing a new transition allowance. </p>
<p>-2<br />
Yet these education and transition initiatives do not exist<br />
in a vacuum. Preparation for work must be followed by th-e<br />
opportunity to work. Another direction of our commitment<br />
to-youth is ensuring that young people are given the opportunity<br />
to gain employment, both through our broad economic strategy<br />
and through training and manpower programmes. Our economic<br />
policies have already led to a gratifying growth in employment<br />
over the past year, and will lead to further improvements<br />
in the future. Our policies have played an important part<br />
in providing an increase of over 200,000 jobs over the last year<br />
including almost 40,000 jobs for-teenagers.<br />
Wle are also taking steps to ensure that young people are<br />
properly equipped to take advantage of the job opportunities<br />
which are in fact opening up. In 1980-81, our manpower,<br />
training and special youth programrmes will help over 220,000<br />
young Australians. We have set aside over $ 100 million for<br />
this assistance which includes subsidies under CRAFT and<br />
the Special Youth Employment Training Programme and assistance<br />
under the Community Youth Support Scheme.<br />
The encouragement given to young people to become involved in<br />
commuunity service, to retain their work orientation and to<br />
develop skills for the future underlines the real contribution<br />
that they can make to Australian society.<br />
The Government considers that the election provides us with<br />
a mandate to continue the basic policies which we have developed<br />
and implemented over the past five years. It is our firm<br />
belief that economic and social progress can only be achieved<br />
on the basis of a firm confidence, both within Australia and<br />
overseas, that the Government of Australia will adopt and<br />
pursue stable, sensible and reliable policies and will always<br />
act in a responsible manner. We will show again that we are<br />
worthy of that confidence by demonstrating a firm resolve to<br />
get on with the job.<br />
Many of us when we gather for the new Parliament, will b e<br />
saddened by the death of a very great Australian and a great<br />
Parliamentarian, Sir John McEwen, who died last Thursday.<br />
It is difficult to know where to begin to praise someone<br />
like the late Sir John. There are many facets of his career<br />
which deserve Darticular mention. I think if I had to single<br />
out one, it would be his dedication to all Australians<br />
Although he was a member of the Country Party, he did represent<br />
all Australians, not only the rural parts of this country.<br />
His career in this Parliament as a Member of the House of<br />
Representatives for an unbroken period of 37 years, during<br />
which time he served as a Minister of State for 26 of them,<br />
including a short period as Prime Minister, is unequalled.<br />
His interest in all things Australian brought about a great<br />
increase in manufacturing industry which enabled us to become<br />
more self reliant. During his period as Minister in Charge of<br />
Manufacturing Industry, there was a great growgth in that<br />
industry. , Some might have thought that there is an odd irony in<br />
that, that as Country Party Leader, that was one of his very great<br />
achievements. It just shows that he was prepared to govern and<br />
adopt policies for all Australians. </p>
<p>3<br />
As. I have said previously, Sir John McEwen was a great<br />
Australian, and a very great Australian leader. I was<br />
honoured and privileged to serve in the Parliament with<br />
him, and to serve in government with him. In addition, he<br />
was a great friend.<br />
My Government and I grieve deeply for him, and our sympathy<br />
goes to his widow, Lady Mary McEwen. </p>
