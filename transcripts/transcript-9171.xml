SPEECH BY THE-PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
OPENING OF THE NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY AND INAUGURALEXHIBITION<br />
" ABOUT FACE: ASPECTS-OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
PORTRAITURE*, OLD PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
MARCH 1994<br />
I am very pleased to be here in this hall of memories<br />
this place where I-used to sit and try to read-the mind's.<br />
construction in the face. The Tory's-mind in the<br />
Liberal's face. Or was it-vice versa?<br />
This whole place is still full of faces for me.<br />
It is where on every sitting day I saw a-national.<br />
portrait gallery right in front of: me. A gallery of<br />
Australian life or-about. half of-it.<br />
From our side the view was principally Protestant,<br />
pastoral and legal, mixed elements of rich and rustic;<br />
blokes they were nearly all blokes -whose faces<br />
betrayed a. life of relative ease, and blokes whose life<br />
on the land had furrowed their brows, narrowed their: gazeand<br />
reddened their cheeks.<br />
There were men like John Gorton who wore the scars of<br />
battle; there were slightly tormented looking characters;<br />
people whose faces showed. the strain and those who hid<br />
it, even under pressure.<br />
There was the odd dandy, occasional obsessives, people<br />
trying to hide the encroachment of age or baldness.<br />
There were conservatives of a kind you rarely see these<br />
days. They came from another Australia. The kind who,<br />
just by looking at them, you knew-would speak with an<br />
accent more English than Australian.<br />
Most of them were decent. If-by our lights they were all<br />
wrong-headed, in the end there were not many who were<br />
wrong-hearted.<br />
It was a galaxy of Australians, a sort of human zoo and<br />
down the years we watched them look upon us in triumph<br />
and disaster. We saw them change. </p>
<p>And they saw us. You will have to ask one of-them what<br />
they saw.<br />
This is the place where Mick Young once called to Andrew<br />
Peacock give us your angry face, Andrew.<br />
It's . the perfect place for a ; Portrait Gallery.<br />
It-can always be said, and often with irresistible logic<br />
and passion, that we need one more gallery or museum<br />
One more place to put our-heritage on show.<br />
It-may have reached the ears of. some of you that I-have<br />
sometimes resisted this-logic and this passion-<br />
It-is true. I: have not-always been persuaded that-anotherhuge<br />
and-hugely expensive building. on the: banks off Burley_<br />
Griffin ranked high among-the things we need for a. betternational<br />
life.<br />
Iam well aware that the National Portrait Gallery in<br />
London is world renowned and much loved by the British.<br />
I: know that the Americans have their-National Portrait<br />
Gallery in Washington.<br />
Eknow that there are people who say that in portraits we<br />
can see the nation's mind and I believe that issubstantially<br />
true.<br />
IEhave long known the reasons why a National Portrait<br />
Gallery is desirable, but many things are desirable and<br />
some things are essential and there is only so much-money<br />
to go around.<br />
And generally I have felt it-was better to spread it:<br />
among those who are prntlycreating.<br />
So I remained a less than passionate advocate.<br />
I have nothing against portraits. Im all for them.<br />
It's almost unAustralian not to be for portraits.<br />
What other country has an. annual nationwide barney about<br />
a. portrait contest?<br />
Perhaps it has something to do with the perennial<br />
question of identity in Australia the old " who are we?"<br />
question. The question that should have been settled a<br />
long while ago.<br />
And I suppose that is how at: least-in-part I-came to<br />
the conclusion that a portrait gallery was one more<br />
gallery worth having. -Vf<br />
7r </p>
<p>I thought, maybe in the last decade of the century this<br />
National Portrait Gallery can help give us a bit of<br />
direction on the question which really should have been<br />
settled a long while ago the identity question. The<br />
" who are we?" question.<br />
I have to say that it's not a question which has ever<br />
caused me much concern.<br />
But I know some people remain ambivalent about it-.<br />
Perhaps it helps to have Irish ancestors..<br />
The answer of course is dead simple and there were<br />
plenty in this country who knew it a century and more ago<br />
" we are Australian-.<br />
And that means among other things, that we are all the<br />
nuances of attitude, feature-and expression; all the<br />
hopeful, despairing, brave, anxious, lofty and lowly,<br />
males and females of any and every ethnic origin whose<br />
portraits were ever rendered by any means on this<br />
continent. If the Portrait Gallery makes these the boundaries of its<br />
ambition, then it will be well on the way to being truly<br />
national and truly worthwhile.<br />
It will be better if it-is not dominated by governors and<br />
other eminent Victorians in heavy gilt frames. Or a<br />
gallery with an exclusive emphasis on the great<br />
achievers. It will be better, I think, if it is a much broader<br />
gallery of our national life -including contemporary<br />
life. And I think Australians will like it much more.<br />
And that is why this first exhibition is such a good one.<br />
It's good to see Meryl Tankard in there with Nellie Melba<br />
and Dorothy Hewett and Germaine Greer and all those<br />
colonial women we have never seen before.<br />
Bill and Dallas with Zelman Cowen, Bob Menzies and Henry<br />
Parkes and George Reid. And me with Bob and Bob with<br />
Hazel. Bungaree with Albert Namatjira and Lois O'Donoghue and<br />
Gulpilil and Eddie Mabo along with the Lieutenant<br />
Colonel Nunn who was responsible for the Waterloo Creek<br />
massacre. Not to say Stella Bowen's airmen in their fur collars who<br />
were dying in the war before she could finish painting<br />
them, and Percy Grainger in the same period, and also in<br />
fur. </p>
<p>-If the exhibition gives us a sense of continuity, it also<br />
offers up a measure of the extraordinary mosaic of<br />
Australia now and in the past.<br />
Not just in the variety of the subjects but in the way<br />
they have been portrayed so that we get an idea of the<br />
way the modern media paints its pictures, as well as<br />
modern artists, or portrait artists of. other times, or<br />
amateur-photographers.<br />
There are all sorts of Australians here in all sorts of<br />
contexts, and captured in all sorts of mediums.<br />
The effect, it seems to me, is democratic in a totally<br />
uncontrived way. Intrinsically and inescapably<br />
democratic, like the country itself.<br />
I think Annie Loxley has succeeded brilliantly in making<br />
this an exhibition which is unimpeachably representative<br />
and democratic and it has to be said, in places,<br />
painfully nostalgic.<br />
But she has also provided us with some great Australian<br />
works of art.<br />
To see this exhibition, then, is to begin to understand<br />
what a National Portrait Gallery might do.<br />
It might excite a wider interest in our history and<br />
society. It might encourage us to learn the story of<br />
Australia, and to better understand the stories of our<br />
fellow Australians.<br />
It might help us understand what it is to be Australian,<br />
and what it was to be Australian. What it:. is-to be an<br />
Aboriginal Australian. An Australian woman. An<br />
Australian with your life hanging on a thread during the<br />
Second World War. A child living in Australia in 1814.<br />
Last, but not least by any means it-might induce us to<br />
recognise the enormous contribution to Australia made by<br />
our artists.<br />
It might help us to remember that in the end the quality<br />
of our national life depends upon and is measured by the<br />
quality of our creative life.<br />
It might lead us to the conclusion that life is what we<br />
make of it nationally speaking, that was never so true<br />
as it is now.<br />
As ever much will depend upon the support and initiative<br />
of government.<br />
But not just government the arts and heritage of<br />
Australia does need more private patronage than it has<br />
been customary for them to receive. </p>
<p>They should~ receive more and I'm sure they willwhen<br />
their crucial role is understood.<br />
Perhaps the National Portrait Gallery can help that<br />
understanding. Perhaps some wandering sponsors will come<br />
here and see their own lives reflected in these faces and<br />
decide to put something back into the country through the<br />
arts. I might say that the Arts Angels, launched so<br />
successfully in Melbourne recently, seem to be a good<br />
example of what can be done.<br />
It is in this context that I should take the opportunity<br />
to thank on behalf of everyone here, Gordon and Marilyn<br />
Darling for their resolute support of this Gallery.<br />
You see I have become a convert to the National Portrait<br />
Gallery. The more so because it is not-going to be left sitting in-<br />
Canberra locked up in yet another massive mausoleum.<br />
The works on display here are all on loan from both<br />
public and private collections.<br />
Their quality, and variety and the degree to which they<br />
represent the many faces of Australia, is a fair<br />
indication of just how much of our heritage is kept out<br />
of the sight of the people.<br />
And a fair indication of the role the National Portrait<br />
Gallery can play in levering this heritage of f walls all<br />
over the country, so that the country can see it.<br />
Even better, these exhibitions will not be confined to<br />
Canberra. Under the Visions of Australia program which we announced<br />
during the last election campaign, the National Portrait<br />
Gallery will be able to offer this and future exhibitions<br />
to other venues in metropolitan centres and through the<br />
network of regional galleries and museums.<br />
The same program of course is open to other cultural<br />
bodies across the country.<br />
It seems to me that in a country of our size and<br />
demography, all our collecting institutions all our<br />
cultural institutions should be exploiting modern<br />
transport and technology to take our heritage out to the<br />
people. So I hope that the National Portrait Gallery prospers and<br />
prospers along the lines we see here tonight. </p>
<p>' There are many people to congratulate. Warren Horton and<br />
John Thompson and others from the National Library. Anne<br />
Loxley, the curator, of course.<br />
Marilyn and Gordon Darling I have already mentioned.<br />
Those private collectors who donated their works so<br />
willingly. The public collections who showed immense<br />
good will towards the project and made their works<br />
available at short notice.<br />
My friend and former colleague, Doug McLelland, Chair of<br />
the Old Parliament House Committee.<br />
I am sure there are others. But they will forgive me for<br />
passing them by, because it is now my duty and great<br />
pleasure to officially open this exhibition and in<br />
doing so wish every success to the Australian National<br />
Portrait Gallery.<br />
Thank you </p>
