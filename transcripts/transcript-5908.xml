FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 15 SEPTEMBER 1982<br />
ADDRESS TO RSL NATIONAL CONGRESS, CANBERRA<br />
Thank you very much for the opportunity of being with you<br />
this morning because I think as you know the Government values<br />
very greatly the role of the RSL, not only in what it does<br />
in pursuing the interests of ex-servicemen, not only -in what it<br />
does in keeping governments honest to see what they do what<br />
they ought to in relation to ex-servicemen, but the RSL makes<br />
a much wider contribution than that.<br />
It often serves to remind' us of things that are<br />
important that other people may forget. The organisation<br />
reminds us on a number of occasions throughout the year, on<br />
Anzac Day in particular, of the effort and the sacrifice of many<br />
tens upon tens of thousands of Australians in many different<br />
conflicts. I am very glad indeed that we have been able to do something<br />
more for the War Memorial. I have been aware for some time of<br />
the problems of the collections, the paintings, the need for<br />
conservators and many other things and I am glad that it is<br />
possible to persuade the Cabinet, I must say it took very<br />
little persuading. But since we are starting to look to a<br />
bicentenary year in 1988, there should be a bicentennial program<br />
for the War Memorial itself. The $ 11 million modernisation<br />
and renovation program will enable a number of things to be<br />
done which have been on the books, which have been planned for<br />
some time. It will be exciting to see more of those things<br />
coming to completion as 1988 approaches. It is going to<br />
come around very, very quickly indeed, it is only five or<br />
so years aw,% a,.<br />
There are many things needed in the War Memorial, not only<br />
space for aircraft and other exhibitions or special exhibitions,-<br />
it is designed to cater for about 300,000 people a year and<br />
last year one million people visited that memorial. The<br />
Governors and managers of the Memorial are taking upon themselves<br />
wider responsibilities. I think there is a feeling that there<br />
is less of some important elements of Australian history<br />
taught in Australian schools now than there might have been.<br />
The War Memorial especially in relation to young Australians,<br />
is quite actively making sure that visitors to the Memorial<br />
learn a little more of Australian history than they might<br />
otherwise have done. </p>
<p>2-<br />
I don't think there is any need for me to talk of the commitment<br />
of the Government to veterans. Sir William has done that for me<br />
I think. There are always gaps. It is not possible to do<br />
everything that the RSL asks in any one year because if we<br />
did I know you would still think of other things in the next<br />
year and the year after, so we have to leave something for<br />
future years. The relationship and the discussions that take<br />
place between governments and senior ministers and the League<br />
are of great value. I welcome very much having the National<br />
President and his Executive to a lunch at The Lodge on one<br />
occasion and I hope that that can be repeated in future years<br />
because it enables a discussion to take place in a totally<br />
informal atmosphere and an exchange of view which I for one,<br />
found very useful.<br />
I think you know that the Government is very much committed to<br />
expanding and improving the defence forces of Australia. We live in an<br />
unstable world. and we live in a world in which the day's<br />
imperial powers continue to spread their influence. We<br />
don't n~ ed reminding too much of Soviet aggressions, what<br />
has happened in Eastern Europe, in Hungary and Czechoslovakia<br />
in earlier years, but more recently in Afghanistan,, the suppression<br />
of Poland, the $ 3 or $ 4 million a day that is being spent by the<br />
Soviet Union in reinforcing the Vietnamese invasion of Kamnpuchea,<br />
what they are seeking to do in ma ny parts of Africa and the<br />
Middle East and in Central America. It is in a sense an<br />
unpredictable world and the Government values very greatly<br />
the United States' determination to rebuild the United States<br />
deFence forces to a position at least of equality and I would<br />
hope in a number of areas to one of superiority over the<br />
Soviet Union because I believe very, very strongly indeed that<br />
the only guarantor-* of peace and of a secure world.-is a strong<br />
and firmly led United States.<br />
The greatest danger to peace is to fall in the erro-s of earlier<br />
times when the western democracies became weak and unable to do<br />
things that they ought to. It does not take much reminding to<br />
know that the last World War could have been so easily stopped<br />
in 1935 or 193(; if only the French or the British or for that<br />
matter the United States which was then very isolationist in<br />
its outlook, had done some of the simple things that they<br />
needed to have done. The overwhelming preponderance of military<br />
power then lay with the French and with the British, but it<br />
was the lack of political will, a lack of resolve, a lack of<br />
understanding which led to the deterioriation of events and<br />
the horrors of the World War.<br />
We have been reminded in quite recent times that if foreign policy<br />
goes wrong a war can result very quickly, it can be very difficult<br />
and very expensive. Foreign policy advice urt the United Kingdom<br />
in relation to the Falklands was in error. It was thought that<br />
the Argentinians would not use force, but they did and the<br />
Australian Government gave all the support it could to Mrs Thatcher<br />
and her Government in the prosecution of that conflict, the<br />
recapturing of the Falklands. I would like to take this opportunity / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
to praise the courage and the determination, the fortitude of<br />
the British Prime Minister and the skill and the capacity of<br />
British serviceme in what they had to do in a pretty difficult<br />
environment, 8,000 miles from 1--me. It was an enormously<br />
successful venture. We were privileged to have only a few<br />
days ago a special briefing by a British team who were here<br />
and there was only one thing that I would like to say about<br />
that particular briefing the extent to which they went out<br />
of their way to emphasise the dominant role the British Prime<br />
Minister to-k, the conduct of the United Kingdom ffairs athat<br />
time, through the war cabinet and repnrting to Cabinet.<br />
It is an enormous tribute to Mr-Thatcher and one which I am<br />
sure not only we, but all British people appreciate very, very<br />
greatly. What happened in the Falklands demonstrates that dangers<br />
can come out of a pretty clear sky unnredictable, unknown,<br />
unexpected and without advice. That means that those nations<br />
that are determined to do what they can to defend themselves,<br />
determined to co-operate with their allies, need to be vigilbnt<br />
and to make sure that their defences are in qood order.<br />
Laqt year our defence expenditure was up about 20% on the<br />
year before. This year it is up very nearly 12% that is about<br />
3% of gross domestic product, not as much maybe as the<br />
RSL woild like, but still up considerably as a proportion ' f<br />
national product in earlier times. We are in effect in the<br />
middle of a $ 6 billion re-equioment program. It is a<br />
very expensive prog-Am indeed and as much of the purchases as<br />
can be, will be 1irected towards Australian indus-ru and the new<br />
Department of Defence Support is designed to act as quB-e a<br />
vigorous advo-ate in a s-nse for Australian industry to get<br />
them interested in fulfilling defence contracts and to make<br />
sure that the contracts that could go their way, don't flow<br />
overseas. I was deliqted to see thatthe retiring chief of Defence Force<br />
Staff who is here on his re4-jement, said that we now have the<br />
best equiped and the best trained force that we have ever<br />
had in peace time. That is a tribute not only to h4activities<br />
to ,4 -Pi( Pcrs. the chiefs of staff and to the serices. but<br />
I hope in some way a compim-nt to the Government that has<br />
assisted in providing the fundz f-hat have made that poqsible.<br />
The introduction of the F-18s, the purchase of new Orions,<br />
new patrol boats being built in Cairns and new modern missile<br />
systems, the fitting of Harpoon, equipment for the army, all<br />
of these things are going forward in a pretty steady way.<br />
We thought we were buying Invincible and I believed it would<br />
have been an enormous addition, and a very valuable addition<br />
to Australian defence forces, but having regard to the role<br />
Invincible had played in the Falklands, I also thought that<br />
there was only one thing to do at the time and write a certain<br />
letter to Mrs Thatcher which I did. I was notsuxrvrised that<br />
the United Kingdom had decided they wished to keep Invincible,<br />
but there is not the slightest doubt that that decision has<br />
posed very significant problems for our own defence planners<br />
for the maintenance of a balanced force. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Defence are now bringing together all the options open to us<br />
which I hope will be before the Government in a few weeks time<br />
so that we can determine what is best to do. obviously cost<br />
is one of the things that we have to have in mind. I think<br />
some of the things that might have been said about having a<br />
carrier, or a single carrier, have not really been<br />
accurate in the past. If it is a question of peace time,<br />
possession of Invincible obviously gives Australia a capacity<br />
which is not matched by other countries in our own region and<br />
I am not too sure that that it is not a good thing. I would like<br />
to say to that Australia has, as indeed is the case, the best<br />
the most modern equipment, more effective forces, technologically<br />
for advanced than any others in our own part of the world.<br />
Invincible would certainly have been very much part of that.<br />
But if we were ever unfortunate enough to be involved in a<br />
significant or major conflict, then quite plainly we would<br />
not be operating alone, it would not be just one carrier<br />
operating alone, it would be a net addition to allied forces<br />
of enormous and significant tactical and strategic importance.<br />
How we come out of this current examination I cannot predict<br />
at the moment because I know there are a number of options<br />
that are being looked at very, very closely indeed. There<br />
is a question of cost and the balance of forces in other<br />
matters. A good deal is being done to modernise communications at<br />
North West Cape, for establishing a new patrol base in Darwin,<br />
which will be opened by Her Majesty very shortly. Cockburn<br />
Sound has been developed as a very effective naval base, it<br />
is being used extensively by United States ships as well as<br />
by our own and the RA-AF base at Darwin or possibly Tindal is<br />
obviously going to be very extensively extended and improved<br />
to take the new F-l8s when they come on stream.<br />
We believe the close co-operation with allies is very essential<br />
and arrangements with the United States are very real. It is<br />
a full blooded relationship, but it is a relationship in a<br />
political sense between equals, not between a middle ranking<br />
power such as Australia and a much larger one as the United States<br />
is.. President Reagan very recently said the partnership is<br />
more than military, it has political and economic dimensions<br />
that have become deeply enmeshed in the fabric of the United<br />
States' national policy. I very much share that view. The<br />
relationship is vital to Australia. There have been. arguments<br />
about the nature of the alliance and about ship visits which<br />
I am not going to revive at this point, but there needs to be<br />
no equivocation at all so far as Australia's interest is<br />
concerned. A full-blooded relationship with the United States<br />
is of vast and great importance and that includes the visits<br />
of ships to our ports whether they are carrying nuclear arms<br />
or whether they are nuclear powered or whatever.<br />
The United States has made it very plain that if ship visits<br />
of that kind cannot take place, if friendly country after<br />
friendly country started to say " We don't want you ships because </p>
<p>they might have a nuclear weapon in the hold", then the United<br />
States would not be able to carry out its obligations to countries<br />
such as Australia with whom they are in partnership, they would<br />
not be able to carry out their global responsibilities in defence<br />
of the free world. There is one other thing that President<br />
Reagan said when Ambassador Cotton, Senator Cotton as he was,<br />
presented his credentials as Ambassador to the United States.<br />
I think you might be interested in the sentence. He said, " You<br />
state that Australia is a middle power, but it is clear that<br />
Aust ralia plays an immensely greater role in world affairs than<br />
that modest appellation would suggest." I think that is a<br />
reasonable compliment on the part of the United States President.<br />
Co-operation with allies much closer-.-to home is also very<br />
important. When I was Defence Minister I negotiated with<br />
Singapore, Malaysia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom the<br />
Five Power Defence arrangement. That was not all that active<br />
for some time. Our battalion was withdrawn and I think that<br />
that was one of the great mistakes in Australian defence<br />
decisions. The British had their own problems and problems<br />
with anything east of Suez and there was some changed political<br />
perceptions for a while. But as a result of discussions I had<br />
with the previous Malaysian Prime minister, and the Singapore<br />
Prime Minister, a number of decisions have been made and I am<br />
very glad to say that not only my good friend Harry Lee, but<br />
the present Prime Minister of Malaysia Dr Mahathir support<br />
these arrangements very strongly indeed. There are exercises<br />
between the three countries most concerned, Malaysia, Singapore<br />
and Australia. It is our hope they might expand to involve<br />
other countries, they would not necessarily be under the five<br />
power arrangement, but it is our hope that they will expand.<br />
There was an earlier decision that we would withdraw from<br />
Butterworth by 1984-85. One of the first decisions of my<br />
Government was to extend the period our fighter<br />
squadrons would stay there. One squadron is coming back to<br />
be transferred to F-18s, but we are now having an examination<br />
to look at the economics of either keeping the Mirage there<br />
or putting a detachment -of F-18s in Butterworth. There is<br />
not the slightest doubt that they are welcome. I believe they<br />
are wanted, but one has to know the national characteristics<br />
of the language that is being used when these matters are discussed.<br />
They are certainly very, very welcome indeed and I believe<br />
in terms of regional co-operation, the decision to keep the<br />
presence in Butterworth beyond 1985, is very much in Australia's<br />
interests and very much in the interests of the whole region.<br />
It is not so widely known that we have been flying Orions out<br />
of Butterworth for a very considerable time now This was part<br />
of our tesponse to Afghanistan when we took over a significant<br />
part of the patrolling obligations that had formerly been<br />
undertaken by the United States. It is also a training operation<br />
with Malaysia because their people are on the aircraft on all<br />
flights. The knowledge gained is shared totally with them,<br />
but they are flying both to the east and to the west conducting<br />
very valuable surveillance operations and making a commitment<br />
to free world defence of a very constructive kind. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
I think it is also worth drawing attention to the fact that<br />
training facilities have been made available to Singapore<br />
which we all know, has some shortage in -geography and<br />
space, in Australia. That is accepted by our other regional<br />
partners as a totally reasonable thing to do and again it<br />
deepens our defence relationship with our close neighbours.<br />
It is not only in relation to the United States as a major<br />
power that the relationship is closer, more effective, more<br />
substantial than I think it has been for a very long while,<br />
it is also in relation to our regional partners and friends<br />
that the relationship has been strengthened in very substantial<br />
ways over recent times.<br />
I think you also know that Australia has accented some wide<br />
responsibilities, the Sinai Multinational Force. For some time<br />
I thought it might be difficult for Australia to be involved<br />
in that because you need a certain degree., of political support<br />
for things that are done, but we did believe that it was<br />
very important to build upon, the one example of co-operation<br />
in the Middle East, the one example of Arab and Jews sitting<br />
down to talk and coming to an agreement. I believe that<br />
it was our indication, our willingness to participate, that<br />
in a sense acted as a catalyst and encouraged-: others also to<br />
join that force.<br />
There is one thing I would like to say, and where I think the<br />
RSL maybe has a role that could be fulfilled to a greater<br />
extent, but not only the RSL, also governments, because perhaps<br />
you and I sometimes take too many things for granted. Let<br />
me explain it in this way. Through the last year there have<br />
been massive peace marches throughout Europe objecting to the<br />
deployment of modern weapons which are necessary for the<br />
effective defence of western Europe. The opposition to those<br />
weapons has been based very significantly on the fact they<br />
are nuclear weapons of one kind or another. You and I perhaps<br />
take so much of what we need to do for granted. We know the<br />
reasons for NATO, we know the reasons for the ANZUS Treaty<br />
then we ask ourselves what weapons systems, what tactics do<br />
we need to give adequate effect to those sorts of treaty. It<br />
is so easy to forget that not just one generation, maybe<br />
twO generations have grown up since that World War ended.<br />
So many people who were born since the NATO arrangement was<br />
founded. So many people born in Australia, since the ANZUS<br />
Treaty was signed do they really understand the reasons<br />
for it? Have they been told the reasons for it, or have we<br />
taken all that for granted? What we do need to understand<br />
is that if we believe these things are important for Australian<br />
security, or for western world democratic security, each<br />
generation in its own time has a right to the explanation.<br />
They have a right to ask questions. I have got no doubt that<br />
a part and maybe a significant part of those peace marches<br />
in Europe had been promoted by the Soviet Union or the<br />
friends or the agents of the Soviet Union, but I also have<br />
not the slightest doubt, and I hope this won't be misreported<br />
as it was last time I made this comment, because they only<br />
reported a part of it, I also have not the slightest doubt<br />
that a very large number of the people who are marching, only.<br />
wanted peace and maybe they are people who have not had the<br />
explanations as to why NATO is necessary. / 7 </p>
<p>7<br />
For Australia we need to explain why ANZUS is necessary, why<br />
military expenditure is necessary, why it is important not to<br />
make the sorts of the mistakes that some of our fathers made<br />
before us. We who so often take the need for adequate defence<br />
and defence arrangements for granted, I think sometimes fall<br />
down in our obligation to explain to young Australians who<br />
only want peace and cannot understand the need for war<br />
preparations, the reasons for it all and why it is so necessary<br />
to preserve peace.<br />
I think Sir William this is something in which the RSL can<br />
certainly play a role, something in which governments need to<br />
play a role. I think it may be something that all of us<br />
who believe in strong and effective defence could work a little<br />
harder at than we have in the past. I would like to thank<br />
you very much indeed for what the RSL is doing throughout<br />
Australia. It is an organisation of great and significant<br />
value. Obviously you don't always agree with the Government or<br />
governments and we cannot always agree with every element of<br />
your policies. My good friend Bruce Ruxton and I sometimes<br />
have mild discussions on how to get to a common objective<br />
and we don't always agree on the way to that objective, but<br />
we do agree about the objective, there is no doubt about that.<br />
When there are disagreements it is about means not about ends.<br />
That is healthy and I would like to thank you all -forthe<br />
role that you played and the service that you continue to<br />
do for Australia. o000o---</p>
