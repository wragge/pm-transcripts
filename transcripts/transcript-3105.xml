EMBARGO: 7.30 20 DECEMBER 1973<br />
NATIONAL BROADCAST BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
DECEMBER, 1973<br />
Good Evening. The other day I spoke in the national Parliament about<br />
the results and achievements of the Government which you, the<br />
Australian people, elected to office just over A ye'ar ago.:<br />
Tonight I want to report to you briefly on some of the things we<br />
have done, some of the things we have attempted to do, and some<br />
of the things we want to achieve in the year ahead.<br />
It has been a year of great and growing prosperity for<br />
Australia. You will remember that 1972, the year before Labor<br />
came to power, was a year of unemployment, under-use of capacity and<br />
poor economic growth. In 12 months we have restored full employment<br />
and boosted our growth rate from 2 per cent to 6 per cent.<br />
Our overseas reserves are strong. Gross domestic product, consumer<br />
spending, retail sales and capital expenditure hay e all moved ahead.<br />
There has never been a time when prospects for our rural industries<br />
were as bright as they are now.<br />
I don't want you to think for a minute that we are<br />
indifferent to the inflationary pressures on the economy some<br />
of these we inherited, some are imported from-other countries<br />
suffering from this worldwide inflationary problem. We have taken<br />
a whole series of bold and overdue measures against inflation,<br />
including two revaluations and a big cut in tariffs. If we had left<br />
things the way they were, inflation would be much higher than it<br />
is now. Our Prices Justification Tribunal is working and working<br />
well. I think you will be encouraged, as I was, by the evidence of<br />
the latest consumer price index, which shows that the increases in<br />
food prices in the past two months have been the lowest of the year.<br />
The fight against inflation will go on. I simply ask you to remember<br />
that inflation is partly the result of a booming economy an<br />
economy that in many ways is the envy of the world.<br />
Let me mention some of the achievements of the past year<br />
in which my colleagues and I take immense pride. One of them is<br />
education. I think we can claim to have given a new deal to the'<br />
children of Australia. We have nearly doubled the funds for<br />
education. We have appointed an independent and expnrt Schools<br />
Commission to ensure that those funds are spent where they are<br />
most needed. Our opponents well, some of our opponents<br />
recognised the great importance of our proposals, and our<br />
legislation was passed as Parliament was about to rise. I am glad<br />
to say that government and non-government schools alike can now<br />
plan confidently ahead on the basis of the greatly increased funds<br />
authorised by the Parliament. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
We have taken action in other fields of education as<br />
well. From tne beginning of next year all fees at universities<br />
will be abolished. One of our targets in the year ahead will be<br />
to set in train for pre-school edacation what we have already don;<br />
for primary, secondary and tertiary education. we want a pre-school<br />
education for every Australian child.<br />
You will see that the great theme common to all our reforms<br />
as it is in education is the promotion of equal opportunity.<br />
That has been Che theme behind the enormous strides we have made<br />
in social security, in our support for equal pay, in all we have<br />
done for the Aboriginal people, for migrants, and in our plans for<br />
a national superannuation scheme fur ail Australians. This year<br />
we took the first big step in abolishing the means test. We lifted<br />
pensions and introduced new benefits for greait numbers of people<br />
in need. We have tried, as best we can, to pass our legislation<br />
for a health insurance scheme that will cover everyone in the<br />
community. Remember, there are something like one million<br />
Australians who are not protected by the present scheme, for whom<br />
illness is a real and ever-present threat. I believea nation<br />
as rich as ours, a people as fair-minded as ours, can afford to<br />
correct this injustice.<br />
Next year we shall be pressing ahead with our plan to<br />
establish efficient community health centres thrcughout Australia,<br />
and set up a schemei~ to provide compensation and rehabilitation for<br />
those who are sick or injured. We shall continue our efforts,<br />
already Wvell advanced, to improve our cities and upgrade the<br />
standards of urban transport. We shall embark on our plan for<br />
up-to-date child-care centres for every mother who needs them,<br />
or wants them. We shall make sure that building societies, hire<br />
purchase companie3 and other financial institutions not just banksof<br />
fer fair and reasonable interest rates to home buyers and<br />
consumers. Much of the machinery for these reforms the expert<br />
inquiries, the statutory commissions have been established.<br />
Soon, I believe, every Australian will begin to feel the lasting<br />
benefit of what we have done this year.<br />
I am proud of a Government that in the space of a year<br />
has abolished conscription, done away with the death penalty in the<br />
territories and the services, revitalised Government support for the<br />
arts, given votes to 18-year old citizens and moved vigorously t~ o<br />
protect the environment. We have ended oar tragic involvement<br />
in Vietnam. We have remove~ d the hateful stamip of acism from<br />
Australia's reputation abroad. We have established a more mature<br />
and independent relati~ onship with our friends in Britain and the<br />
United States. We have formed a new aind fruitful understanding<br />
with China instead oZ pretending that China does not exist.<br />
We are about to negotiate a firm and lasting treaty of friendship<br />
with Japan. </p>
<p>There is one other great theme in all we have done.<br />
That is: to preserve Australian ownership of our important<br />
industries, to safeguard Australian control of our precious<br />
resources. All of us have seen or read of the consequences,<br />
in other western countries, of the current energy shortage.<br />
All of us know of the great economic uncertainties facing many<br />
developed nations throughout the world. In this climate of<br />
uncertainty Australia has much to be thankful for. My Government<br />
in its plans for the Australian Industry Development Corporation,<br />
for the Petroleum and Minerals Authority which we aim to establish<br />
next year has moved swiftly to safeguard our known resources<br />
and to search for new resources which will remain under Australian<br />
control. This is the Government's great task for the years ahead.<br />
It is a task to which our whole philosophy is directed and attuned.<br />
In the development of our country, in the preservation of its great<br />
and increasing prosperity, we shall place the interests of<br />
Australia and Australians above all else. We believe Australians<br />
should own our country's resources.<br />
The past year has been a busy year, a hectic. year. We<br />
have done much, because there was much that we had to do. We have<br />
had our successes, our setbacks, our difficulties, and naturally<br />
enough our mistakes. But there can be no doubt about the great<br />
scope of our achievement or the importance of our plans for a<br />
greater Australia. It is in that spirit of confidence that I wish<br />
you all a happy Christmas, and trust that 1974 will bring peace and<br />
growing good fortune to all of us, and to all our families. </p>
