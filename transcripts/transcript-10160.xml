TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIMIE MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
RADIO INTERVIEW 3 LO WITH DOUG AlTON<br />
AXTON: John Howard good afternoon.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good afternoon Doug. It's great to be here.<br />
AITON; Thanks for coming. It's good to see you. I've got to go to a news item first thing.<br />
David Irving and Gerry Adams have been, it's been decided by your Government that<br />
they cannot enter Australia as they had hoped and my immediate thought is that<br />
doesn't seem to fit in. This is my first confrontational question. That doesn't seem to<br />
fit in.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I hope things improve.<br />
AITON: Yes. That doesn't seem to fit in with John Howard's approach to free speech which<br />
you've made fairly clear.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's got nothing to do with free speech. 68/ 11/ 96 19: 36 Pg: </p>
<p>Fax from AITON;, What's it got to do with?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's got to do with the unfitness of both of them on character grounds to come here.<br />
AITON: Could you explain that fu~ rther?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Very easily. The Minister, whose decision I fuilly support, has decided that because of<br />
his prior criminal convictions, David Irving can't come here. Any other person would,<br />
with that background of criminal convictions, would routinely be rejected by the<br />
Department of Immigration and the thing wouldn't even go to the Minister.<br />
AITON: As a visitor?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
As a visitor, yes, yes. That in fact to me is game, set and match. This idea that it's got<br />
anything to do with free speech is spurious. David Irving's book is published in<br />
Australia. He will no doubt be on television tonight, probably bagging me and saying<br />
he's going to appeal and do all sorts of things. So nothing stops his views comning out<br />
here but any government has got the right to say to somebody who has got a record of<br />
criminal convictions, you can't come here. As far as Gerry Adams is concerned, hie is<br />
the head of Sinn Fein. Sinn Fein is the political mouthpiece of a terrorist organisation.<br />
There's been a breakdown tragically in the peace negotiations in northern Ireland. I<br />
would have thought that was also an open and shut case and once again has precious<br />
little to do with free speech. The movement of people in and out of Australia is not so<br />
much a question of free speech, it's a question of whether the Government of this<br />
country has the right to decide at all times who should come here, even for temnporary<br />
purposes. AITON: Do you think they, notwithstanding your explanation, do you think they'd do any<br />
harm? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't think that's quite the point. These things always... Fafrft08/ 11/ 96 19: 36 Pg: 2 </p>
<p>Fax from 08/ 11/ 96 19: 36 Pg: 3<br />
AITON:. But it's the question.<br />
PRIME MINISTER;<br />
No they always establish precedenynd governments do have a right to have a look<br />
at the background of people in order to make a decision so the Minister in my view,<br />
and it was his decision, I certainly support it very strongly.<br />
AITON: Particularly in the case of David Irving, I object to his views very strongly. I mean, I<br />
thin... PRIME MINISTER:<br />
He's a crackpot historian but it doesn't alter the fact that he was convicted in the<br />
United Kingdom, he was convicted in Germany, he was convicted in Canada, and two<br />
of the offences as I understand it are related to passport, immigration or visa issues.<br />
That record, if it had been, dare I say it, John Howard or Doug Aiton or any one of<br />
your listeners, it wouldn't have even got to the Minister. People with that background<br />
are being routinely rejected by the Department all the time so to let Irving in in those<br />
circumstances would have required us to give him preferential treatment, preferential<br />
treatment. We would have been required to discriminate in favour of him.<br />
AITON: Yes I understand what you mean but I still don't think he would have done much harm<br />
and I think it would have been handy to know what people think from, or what our<br />
own people think, Australians from having a flutter like that let loose, if you like.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it's really a question of applying the law in a consistent fashion. There have been<br />
some very unusual people allowed in to come to Australia in the past. I've known a<br />
few heads of government who have come here. They've subsequently turned out to be<br />
very unusual, so unusual at the time that their unusualness was demonstrated later like<br />
the late Romanian dictator, Ceausescu.<br />
AITON: Yes, that's a little bit of a pot shot at Bob Hawke, is it?<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
No it's not. I think in fact he was invited to visit Australia by one of Bob Hawke's<br />
predecessors. No it's not a pot shot at Hawke. It's just an observation on some of the<br />
difficulties and choices you have to make when you're in those situations. </p>
<p>Fax from AITON: You've been Prime Minister for eight months now I think. The greatest flak you've<br />
taken by far, as far as I can see, is regarding Pauline Hanson, The flak seems to be,<br />
you seem to be puzzled by it, you seem to say, look, I don't share her views but I<br />
regard her freedom to speak, to make them important but the flak seems to be<br />
perception to me. People think that you're not strongly enough opposed to her in your<br />
heart? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's wrong but my reac tion to that whole issue is not so much one of puzzlement, it<br />
is one of the very strong belief that if the rest of the Australian community, particularly<br />
some sections of the media, had taken the view to that speech that I took, I don't think<br />
we'd be even talking about it now. I went to Indonesia and Japan. Two weeks after<br />
the speech had been delivered I addressed the largest press conference ever addressed<br />
by an Australian Prime Minister in Tokyo. The issue was not raised in Japan. It was<br />
not raised in Indonesia. It never occurred to me to raise it myself because it never<br />
occurred to me that the views of one person would be taken as representing the views<br />
of the Australian Government, let alone the Australian people. If a member of the<br />
national assembly of Indonesia or Malaysia or New Guinea for that matter, one<br />
member made a speech which was violently hostile to Australia, I don't think we<br />
would get ourselves into a lather of sweat about it. I don't think we would assume<br />
that that meant that the Malaysian Government or the Indonesian Government disliked<br />
us. So I took a deliberate decision. I don't have a racist bone in my body. I abhor<br />
discrimination against people on the basis of race or background or colour or creed but<br />
I also know that an obsessive and disproportionate preoccupation with the speech of<br />
one person can produce consequences that are not in Australia's interests and I do<br />
think that there has been an obsessive reaction by some sections of your own employer<br />
in particular and by the Sydney Morning Herold. I single those two out as having<br />
really sort of gone overboard on this issue.<br />
Now they have a right to do that. haven't rung up the editor of the Sydney Morning<br />
Herald and complained about it and any view I have I express publicly because I do<br />
believe that people have got a right to criticise me. I am the Prime Minister. I know<br />
that in the line of duty you're going to cop a lot of flak. I have resolved not to change<br />
my handling of the matter because I do believe it's correct. I spoke to Tim Fischer this<br />
afiernoon. He's just come back from a visit to Asia and he said that the position of the<br />
Australian Government and the Australian people is well understood and I think in a<br />
couple of months' time we will look back and we will say, gee, what was that all<br />
about?<br />
AITON: Well I'm not so sure. I've spoken with people such as Malcolm Fraser and Philip<br />
Adams and... Faxfro00/ 11/ 96 19: 36 Pg: 4 </p>
<p>Fax from PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, Phillip Adams is an occupational critic of mine. You know that. I mean I don't<br />
say that with any anger but Phillip Adams is. the opportunity to have a swipe, and he<br />
has got a right to do that. He is exercising his free speech.<br />
AITON: I wasn't talking to him about you, I was talking to him about Pauline Hanson. He and<br />
I shared the view that we were both rather almost frightened. Malcolm Fraser that said<br />
things along the same lines, but for what it's worth, Malcolm Fraser, Phillip Adams and<br />
myself all believe that Pauline Hanson has caused an incredible amount of damage and<br />
that I believe that you as Prime Minister could have at least deflected it further than<br />
you have.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well that's a view, particularly coining from you, that I respect but it's a view which I<br />
disagree. I believe that if the same appropriate level of indifference had been extended<br />
to that speech by others as was extended by me then I don't think we would be talking<br />
about it now. Now we have to agree to disagree on that I do think that you have to<br />
understand the very simple fact that there are a lot of people in Australia who have felt<br />
over the years that discussion on some things has been too bottled up and there has<br />
been this pressure cooker atmosphere develop in the community and there has been in<br />
the community developed a view that there is an elite that really thinks that the<br />
Australian mainstream can't be trusted to talk about certain subjects and I very widely<br />
quoted a comment of Bob H-awke's that has been quoted by a number of people where<br />
he sort of argued that attitudes on certain issues because they had been common<br />
between the government and the opposition had really been maintained against the<br />
strong body of opposite opinion in the Australian community.<br />
Now in some circumstances that is an appropriate boast for a former Prime Minister to<br />
make and in some circumstances that can be appropriate. In other circumstances it can<br />
be very conceited, it can be very arrogant and it can be very insulting to ordinary<br />
Australians and I do think there is a feeling in the Australian community, there was a<br />
feeling in the Australian community before the last election, that they were being told<br />
to what to believe on certain subjects rather than being encouraged or having a point<br />
of view advocated towards them, so that was one of the considerations that 1 had in<br />
mind. I do believe that if people had given the same level of disdain, displayed the<br />
same level of disdain, now, I accept that people of great decency and good will have a<br />
different point of view. I wear that, I wear that as part of the job and nobody likes<br />
being criticised or bucketed but I don't complain and I accept the right of people to<br />
criticise me in the most virulent fashion. I'U just argue back when I have the<br />
opportunity of doing so I hope in a good tempered fashion.<br />
AITON: What do you think of the 1950s? Fa8x/ f1rm1/ 96 19: 36 Pg: </p>
<p>Farxom 08/ 11/ 96 19: 36 Pg: 6<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the 1950s was the decade, I guess, in which I grew up. I turned 21 which was<br />
the adult age in 1960. 1 think it was a period of enormous stability. In reflection it was<br />
a period of great prosperity. It was very different. I would not like to go back to it.<br />
AITON: Why not?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
To start with, you can't ever go back. Nostalgia is a nice thing but it ought to be kept<br />
in its place.<br />
AXTON: But do you yearn for the 1950s?<br />
PRIME MINISTERNo<br />
I don't, I don't yearn for the 1950s. I know.<br />
AITON: You are accused of this you see.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I know that but I mean it didn't work very well. I mean the first poster that the Labor<br />
party produced about was one that was resplendent.<br />
AITON; The picket fence.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no the picket fence and the FJs and the Morphy Richards toaster and the Bob<br />
Menzies and the FJ and all of that, but it didn't work. I mean, in the end I was<br />
autographing them as fundraisers, they were really very good. I think you have to<br />
have a broad view of our cultural history. That was a period that had great stability<br />
and strength, but very low in unemployment. When I left school unemployment was<br />
less than On the other hand, medical science was nothing like it was today, we<br />
didn't know as much about the rest of the world. 1 don't think that women felt<br />
perhaps then they had as much choice as they do now.<br />

<p>Farxom 08/ 11/ 96 19: 36 Pg: 7<br />
AITON: Censorship? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There was more censorship. We probably had a narrower view in certain respects<br />
about the world and about other countries in other races. We, for example, had a<br />
white Australia policy which now people would regard as a complete anachronism. So<br />
like all of those things there were pluses and minuses and when I talk about that period<br />
I think, in fact, it was on your program I made a comment about the 1950s that<br />
provoked the Keating attack and it was probably the genesis of that poster. But the<br />
point I made then and I make now is that there were certain features of that period<br />
which should not have been completely ridiculed and dismissed but there is a balance<br />
sheet in all of these things. It is like the balance sheet of Australian history. I think that<br />
shows a profoundly benign balance in our favour as a people. That doesn't mean to say<br />
there aren't black spots in it and it doesn't mean to say that there aren't things that we<br />
should as a community be thoroughly ashamed of.<br />
AITON: Have you every entertained Aboriginal people in your house?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I don't think I have entertained Aboriginal people in my home, not that I can<br />
recall. Look, I may have. It's not a question I have every been asked before and I'm<br />
57, 1Ijust don't know. I grew up in a part of Australia where I didn't as a young<br />
person come into much contact with Aboriginal people. I grew up in the inner southwestern<br />
suburbs of Sydney and it wasn't because of any positive decision on my part<br />
or that of my parents but I just didn't come into contact with many of them.<br />
AITON: Have you every entertained any Asian people in your house?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh yes, very early stage, yes, of course, I had a couple of class mates of mine, both at<br />
primary and secondary school. Yes, from a very early age.<br />
AITON: What do you want to be remembered for as Prime Minister? Are you able to say that<br />
after eight months in office?<br />
Fax from </p>
<p>Fax from PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the thing that I'm proudest of over the last eight months was achieving uniform<br />
gun laws. I think that has done more to turn around the atmosphere and the ambience<br />
of our community, it will over time anyway, than anything else I've done so far. It will<br />
give a safer Australia, it wvill make women in particular feel more secure, it will give a<br />
safer atmosphere for a lot of' women and children and I am very, very proud of the fact<br />
that people will stop me in the street and say " look I didn't vote for you and I probably<br />
never will but I really did agree with what you did on guns"<br />
AITON: Well you certainly did it very fast.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's particularly with women. That's not the only thing that I'm proud of. I'm<br />
proud of the budget that Peter Costello brought down. I think it was a very strong but<br />
fair budget and I'm very proud of the fact that we have been able to negotiate a good<br />
understanding with the Australian Democrats about the Workplace Relations bill. It is<br />
not everything we wanted but we could never get everything we wanted once we<br />
didn't control the Senate but we have made giant strides and that Bill wvill over time<br />
change for the better, forever, the Australian workplace system.<br />
AITON: The two issues that continue to be a thorn in the side of Australia over not only<br />
different governments on different sides of the fence, but also over the decades, it<br />
seems to me anyway, Aboriginal welfare and tax evaders of a rich nature and I don't<br />
think you have got any further that anyone else with either of those matters.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well give me time, I have only had eight months and as far as Aboriginal policy is<br />
concerned as far as Aboriginal policy is concerned I want to be, when the time comes,<br />
to remember me as distinct from experience ex-Prime Minister, I want to be<br />
remembered as somebody in the Aboriginal affairs area who made a practical<br />
contribution towards addressing the modem problems of the Aboriginal community<br />
and that is their depravation in areas of health and education and employment and<br />
housing. I see reconciliation as best being expressed through remedy and disadvantage<br />
and it's not easy. Things like the Hindmarsh bridge fiasco tainted the cause of sensible<br />
reform in the area of Aboriginal affairs and it will be hard and I'm not makcing any<br />
&amp; andiose promises but I don't want people to believe that just because I'm doing it<br />
differently from my predeessor that I am any less committed. It's very important, and<br />
there has been a tendency for us to be criticised, because we're doing it differently<br />
from the Labor Party therefore we are less interested that's not the case at all.<br />
Fafxo/ m1 1/ 96 19: 36 Pg: 8 </p>
<p>Faxom 08/ 11/ 96 19: 36 Pg: 9<br />
AITON; What about rich tax evaders who no-one seems to be able to stop?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't entirely agree with that, I think when I was Treasurer I introduced a lot<br />
of measures which cut tax avoidance. If the complaints of those affected were any<br />
guide they certainly hit the mark because I suffered an enormous amount of abuse and<br />
criticism from some people all those years ago. And some of the measures, let me<br />
frankly say, introduced by the former Government some of the base-broadening<br />
measures made a contribution to eliminating some things and there are certain things<br />
they introduced which we may have been critical of at the time which we haven't<br />
reversed and we don't intend to reverse. But I'm not quite as pessimistic on that front<br />
as your question indicates you are.<br />
AITON; Did you have to grit your teeth when you handed Andrew Peacock the plum of..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:-<br />
No, no I did it with enormous pleasure. Andrew and I mellowed towards each other a<br />
long time ago. We buried the hatchet, smoked the peace pipe, toasted each other<br />
whatever metaphor you want to use quite a while ago and I really enjoyed being able<br />
to offer Andrew that position. He will do the job brilliantly and I'm delighted that he<br />
accepted. He understands the American political scene like no other Australian I've<br />
ever known. He has superb top level contacts with both sides of the hill. And I can't<br />
think of anybody to better represent the interests of our country in the United States in<br />
the second term of a Clinton administration.<br />
AITON: Well what was the problem, just that you both wanted to be Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You could say that. Perhaps we both, on that particular issue, matured late,<br />
AITON: Did you have a lot of confrontations with him, just the two of you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We had our share of arguments.<br />
Fax from </p>
<p>Fax from 08/ 11/ 96 19: 36 Pg: 103<br />
AITON: Did you shout at each other?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Occasionally yes, but we ended up getting both of us got very tired of being blamed<br />
for all the then perceived ills of the Liberal Party and some of the criticisms of both of<br />
us and whenever you have something like that each has got to carry a fair proportion<br />
of the blame. But in the end if something went wrong in the Liberal Party they'd say,<br />
oh that's because of the Howard-Peacock rivalry. It would have nothing at all to do<br />
with us, I mean, it would have to do with local dispute in Western Australia or<br />
Queensland and they'd say well, if Howard and Peacock both got out, this problem<br />
wouldn't arise. Now we sort of became the whipping boys for every perceived defect<br />
in the Liberal Party and both of us got pretty tired of that a few years ago and we<br />
decided over time to do something about it.<br />
AlTON: When you draw down the blinds and close the curtains in your private home, perhaps,<br />
or your office and talk to a close friend, what do you really say about the ABC?<br />
PRiME MINISTER:<br />
I say that I think the ABC is a terrific Australian institution. I think its political focus is<br />
too narrow. You mentioned Phillip Adams, I think the ABC would do itself enormous<br />
credit if it had a right wing Phillip Adams.<br />
AITON: Yes, I think Gerard Henderson would be good.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the assumption behind that is that Gerard Henderson is a critic of the Labor<br />
Party. I've read one critical comment, seriously critical comment of the Labor Party,<br />
by Gerard over the last four years. I mean, he worked for me ten years ago.<br />
AITON:<br />
Yeah, I know.<br />
PRIE MINISTER:<br />
And I'd be fascinated to know what his political leanings are now. But that's his<br />
business and his right. I wouldn't quite see him as fitting that bill.<br />
__ 1 </p>
<p>Fax from 08/ 11/ 96 19: 36 Pg: 11<br />
AITON: Okay, you mentioned Phillip Adams, but do you really think the ABC is personified by<br />
Philfip Adams?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think on a lot of issues the ABC is the spectrum of view is too narrow.<br />
AITON: You mean, left wing?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I mean, areas of, well certainly left of centre and certainly in the area of what you<br />
might loosely call politically corr ect issues. I mean, the ABC has a fairly predictable<br />
reaction on most issues. One of the strengths of any broadly based news outlet is to<br />
have a range of views, a montage of views. I think, for example if I may quote a rival<br />
outlet, one of the great improved strengths of the Sydney Daily Telegraph over recent<br />
years as a tabloid newspaper is that it's got a range of columnists and they have<br />
unpredictable and different views and I think that is a very, very good thing. I think<br />
the ABC would do, if I may say you asked me the question I'll give you an honest<br />
answer I think it would do better if it did that. And I try to sort of encapsulate it by<br />
making that commuent that I do about Mr Adams, Now I'm not anti the ABC I listen<br />
to the ABC still more than any other radio. I was brought up on the ABC. I learnt to<br />
love cricket when I was a young child by listening to the ABC broadcasts. I learnt to<br />
listen to rugby league broadcastings, forgive my Melbourne audience for quoting my<br />
home town football. So I have no dislike of the ABC as an institution, I think it's a<br />
terrific institution.<br />
AITON: Well why don't you fix it instead of smash it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Fix it, that's the very antithesis of what it claims to be and that is an independent. You<br />
say fix it.<br />
AlTON: I think the Government is entitled to fashion the ABC, any Government Labor or<br />
Liberal, the way it sees fit. I think that would have been better than... NA </p>
<p>Farxftf08 / 11/ 96 19: 36 Pg: 12<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No I don't agree, you see this is where I disagree. I mean, I think once you start even<br />
giving a cent, I mean if I said yes to that a lot of your colleagues in the ABC would say<br />
Howard wants to draw the teeth of the ABC, he wants the ABC to be a faint echo of<br />
the Government, I don't want it to be a faint echo of the Government. I just want it<br />
to be a reflection of the fact that it is funded by all of the Australian tax payers and all<br />
of the Australian tax payers, they cover the whole spectrum and I don't think they get<br />
the whole spectrum. I'm not saying they shouldn't get the spectrum that I think they<br />
get a lot of, I'm just saying they should also get the other spectrum.<br />
AITQN: What about the Republic, can we say goodbye to that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I don't think so. I think there's still a lot of blatant support for the Republic. I'm<br />
not a Republican, but I'm not going to allow my anti-Republican views to stand in the<br />
way of a full and free expression of the Australian people if that's what they want in<br />
favour of a Republic. The only other comment I'd make is that if it is to happen. I<br />
want it to happen in circumstances that unite the Australian people. I want it to be a<br />
unifying event. Now that may mean that it comes a little later than some people would<br />
like, but I can't think of a worse outcome that to have a referendum on the Republic in<br />
a short number of years where it was carried by 5 1% to 49% or lost or even worse,<br />
lost 5 1% to 49%. Better, if it is to come, that it be a little bit later but the margin in<br />
favour of it be much stronger.<br />
AITON: Yes I think it should be a thumping majority in favour of it. But are you going to go<br />
ahead with the measures you said you were going to go ahead with?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well there's still very strong support in the Coalition to have some kind of convention,<br />
yes. We're discussing that issue quite a bit at the present time and I think we'll<br />
probably have something to say about it before too long. But there is a view that we,<br />
having said we're going to have a convention, that we should have a convention and<br />
then there will be a vote on it. I mean, I just want people to understand that my views,<br />
I'm not going to force my views on the Australian people but equally I'm not going to,<br />
sort of haul down the flag on my own views just because the latest polls say that it's a<br />
minority view. I am not going to let my views stand in the way of a full and free<br />
expression. People knew that when they voted for me and it remains my position. I<br />
haven't changed but I want the Austrlaian peopel to think about it, tWk about it,<br />
ultimately vote about it, but in circumstances where, whatever the result is, it's a result<br />
that everybody can feel comifortable with and that it's a chain of events that binds us<br />
together ever more closely as Australian people.<br />
