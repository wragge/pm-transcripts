    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.....................................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much, David, to Bob Carroll, the President of the Queensland</p>
<p> Division of the Liberal Party, my Cabinet colleague, John Moore, I</p>
<p> acknowledge the presence of another former federal colleague of mine,</p>
<p> Stan Collard, who was a great friend of mine and the Coalition's</p>
<p> during the difficult times of 1987, my other Parliamentary colleagues,</p>
<p> ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>It is always for me a great pleased to be in Queensland, to be in</p>
<p> Brisbane, and I want to thank the Queensland Division for at very</p>
<p> short notice, organising tonight's gathering. It's an opportunity</p>
<p> to first of all congratulate David Watson on his assumption of the</p>
<p> Leadership of the Liberal Party here in Queensland at a State level.</p>
<p>David and I have been long time friends and colleagues. I know he</p>
<p> brings to his new position an enormous amount of experience and a</p>
<p> great understanding of the political challenges that lie ahead. And</p>
<p> I am not a person to mince words or to beat about the bush on important</p>
<p> political issues and I realise that I speak to you in the aftermath</p>
<p> of an election result here at a State level, that, to say the least</p>
<p> has been extremely disappointing. And it is important that we understand</p>
<p> the lessons of that defeat. It's important we not be overburdened</p>
<p> by it and very importantly from the federal point of view it's</p>
<p> important we understand the challenge that lies ahead of us.</p>
<p>The last federal election we had an unparalleled success for the Liberal</p>
<p> Party. It was a most extraordinary result which delivered to the Liberal</p>
<p> Party a record number of seats here in the State of Queensland. There</p>
<p> are a combination of reasons for that. One of the reasons often, I</p>
<p> think unstated, was the quality of the candidates the Liberal Party</p>
<p> offered on that particular occasion. I am naturally as Leader and</p>
<p> as Prime Minister, and as the federal custodian of the fortunes of</p>
<p> our Party, I am naturally concerned to ensure that the right circumstances</p>
<p> exist, that we can retain all of the seats that we won here in Queensland</p>
<p> at the next federal election.</p>
<p>And in order to achieve that goal it's important that we understand</p>
<p> that ultimately the next election will be a contest between ourselves</p>
<p> and the Australian Labor Party. There can only be two people who will</p>
<p> end up as Prime Minister after the next election, myself or Mr Beazley.</p>
<p> There is no other possible outcome of that election. And it's</p>
<p> very important that we keep in mind what the alternative is.</p>
<p>Of course we feel disappointed and some people feel understandably</p>
<p> concerned about the swings against the Liberal Party in Brisbane and</p>
<p> also the gains that were made by the One Nation Party in the provincial</p>
<p> and rural areas of Queensland. In responding to that it is very important</p>
<p> we don't misread the signs. We should neither be intimidated</p>
<p> by the outcome, nor should we be complacent about it. We should understand</p>
<p> that the bulk of the people who voted for the One Nation Party came</p>
<p> straight part from our own conservative base. And we must therefore</p>
<p> understand why that happened, and we must therefore set in place some</p>
<p> sensible strategies in order to maintain the confidence and the support</p>
<p> of those people when the federal election takes place.</p>
<p>And there is no point in muttering about these things in hushed tones</p>
<p> behind closed doors. We are an open society. And we are a society</p>
<p> that thrives on debate and advocacy. And the first thing that I want</p>
<p> to say to you tonight is that I have absolutely no intention of shrivelling</p>
<p> away into a Âpolicy nothing' as a result of what happened</p>
<p> here in Queensland. The worst thing that we could do is to lose our</p>
<p> sense of policy commitment, To lose our zeal for those things that</p>
<p> we believe are important for Australia. I have no end of people come</p>
<p> to me since the Queensland election and say "John, you better</p>
<p> forget about tax reform. Forget about it. Forget about privatising</p>
<p> Telstra. Forget about doing anything the least bit bold or visionary</p>
<p> for the future of Australia. What you have got to do is sort of do</p>
<p> nothing. And go up into a corner, don't defend anybody. And all</p>
<p> of those supporters will come flooding back". Well can I say</p>
<p> to you that is a prescription to lose even more support.</p>
<p>And I have to say to you that I have no intention of abandoning my</p>
<p> very strong support for reforming the Australian taxation system.</p>
<p> And the reason that I won't abandon that is that I believe it</p>
<p> is good for Australia. I have now been in politics for 24 years, and</p>
<p> I have believed in taxation reform for most of that 24 year period.</p>
<p> And I believe in it because I think is good for the country. Not because</p>
<p> I am on some kind of ideological binge. Not because it is going to</p>
<p> satisfy my ego. Not because it is going to deliver some kind of special</p>
<p> taxation treatment to me. It is because that as we go into the 21st</p>
<p> Century, we need to have a taxation system that helps rather than</p>
<p> hinders our exporters. We need to have a taxation system that is fairer</p>
<p> than the present one. We need to have taxation system that gives personal</p>
<p> tax relief to low and middle income earners. We need to have a taxation</p>
<p> system that sweeps away the complicated indirect taxation system that</p>
<p> we have at the present time. And we need to have a taxation system</p>
<p> that addresses the complications of Commonwealth / State financial</p>
<p> relations which have been something that has bedevilled the politics</p>
<p> of Australia for decades.</p>
<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, can I say that one thing I won't be</p>
<p> doing and one thing that I don't believe the Liberal Party should</p>
<p> do, is to take policy fright or to engage in a full scale policy retreat</p>
<p> as a result of what happened here at the Queensland election.</p>
<p>And the same thing applies to my approach to the sale of the remaining</p>
<p> two-thirds of Telstra to the men and women of Australia. You may remember</p>
<p> that I made that announcement on behalf of the Government at the Liberal</p>
<p> Party National Convention here in Brisbane back in March. And once</p>
<p> again I am in favour of that not because of any ideological belief</p>
<p> but because I think it is good for Australia. And let me tell you</p>
<p> why it's good for Australia. One of the reasons why it's</p>
<p> good for Australia is that it will enable us to deliver to the young</p>
<p> generations of the 21st Century, an essentially debt free Australian</p>
<p> nation. When we became the Government of Australia, the Federal Government</p>
<p> owed about $95 to $100 million billion dollars. And that was about</p>
<p> twenty percent of the total annual wealth generation of Australia.</p>
<p>Without the sale of Telstra, we'd be able to reduce that to about</p>
<p> ten percent of the annual wealth generated by Australians by the year</p>
<p> 2000. But with the sale of Telstra we can reduce it to a bare one-and-a-half</p>
<p> percent of our totally generated annual wealth by the year 2001. And</p>
<p> that means that we can say to our children and grandchildren who will</p>
<p> inherent the twenty first century that one of the legacies of those</p>
<p> who were in control of Australia in the last years of the twentieth</p>
<p> century, one of the legacies that we leave to those generations is</p>
<p> an essentially debt free society. Now I think that is a goal worth</p>
<p> striving for. I think that is a goal worth achieving. And particularly</p>
<p> when you are offering to the men and women of Australia the opportunity</p>
<p> to buy shares in this great Australian company. And it can be done</p>
<p> in a way which protects through legislation the community service</p>
<p> benefits of the existing Telstra arrangement. And indeed out of the</p>
<p> proceeds of the sale of Telstra, we are able to (inaudible) for communications</p>
<p> infrastructure in the rural and regional areas of Australia that we</p>
<p> would not otherwise be able to do.</p>
<p>Now I have deliberately dealt with those two issues because I don't</p>
<p> believe at a time like this amongst the Liberal Family there is any</p>
<p> room for prevarication or any room for doubt as to where the Federal</p>
<p> Government stands on these issues.</p>
<p>And if we hold our resolve and our commitment and our nerve on these</p>
<p> great policy issues, we will win rather than lose support. The path</p>
<p> to another defeat is to lose your policy nerve. The one way to alienate</p>
<p> more supporters is to communicate to them the message that you are</p>
<p> no longer committed to the things that you believe are important for</p>
<p> Australia's future. There are variety of reasons why twenty-three</p>
<p> percent of the Queensland electorate voted for the One Nation Party.</p>
<p> Much of it is bound up with the fact that Australia, like all other</p>
<p> western societies, is going through a period of great period of economic</p>
<p> and social adjustment.</p>
<p>Globalisation of the world economy is on us whether we like it or</p>
<p> not. We don't have the option of saying to the rest of the world,</p>
<p> "Stop, Australia want's to get off". We are a great</p>
<p> trading nation. And if we sell to the rest of the world, then we must</p>
<p> buy from the rest of the world. The notion that we can live in a world</p>
<p> were they buy our goods and services, but we don't buy any of</p>
<p> their's is a fool's paradise and it can't be achieved.</p>
<p> And in those circumstances, we have to take notice of what the rest</p>
<p> of the world says. We have to be an attractive place in which to invest.</p>
<p> And we have to be a country and a Government that understands that</p>
<p> globalisation will impose change and difficult adjustment.</p>
<p>And it's very easy if you're a new kid on the block, politically</p>
<p> speaking, it's very easy if you are without office, if you are</p>
<p> without power, without responsibility, to come along and say "I</p>
<p> have got the simple solution. You stop all imports. You keep everybody</p>
<p> out. You put up a wall and you try and seal Australia off from the</p>
<p> rest of the world." Sounds all right for about ten minutes. But</p>
<p> after you sit and think about it you realise what folly it is. And</p>
<p> I think it's very important that we understand that playing on</p>
<p> the instability and the insecurity of people at a time of economic</p>
<p> change is easily done the first time, it's a lot harder the second</p>
<p> time. Because once you've won a bit of support you have, therefore,</p>
<p> a responsibility to deliver some solutions.</p>
<p>And can I say to all of the parties on the political scene in Australia,</p>
<p> whether they belong to the Australian Labor Party, or to One Nation</p>
<p> or they're independent or they're green or they're</p>
<p> anything, can I say to them, there are no simple solutions. The only</p>
<p> policy prescriptions that are going to work for Australia, are ones</p>
<p> that address real problems with real responses and real solutions.</p>
<p> There is no such thing as a world economy in which Australia can say</p>
<p> Âno' to the rest of the world but accept the rest of the</p>
<p> world to say Âyes' to Australia. That kind of Nirvana, that</p>
<p> kind of paradise, economically speaking, doesn't exist.</p>
<p>Now the first thing that we ought to understand is that one of the</p>
<p> reasons why that Party did well was that it exploited the natural</p>
<p> vulnerability of people at a time of great economic and social change.</p>
<p>The second thing that I think we ought to understand is that there</p>
<p> is a discontent with some of the practices of what I might say are</p>
<p> mainstream politics in Australia. People don't like opposition</p>
<p> for opposition's sake. People are a little tired with confrontational</p>
<p> politics. Every so often if you agree with your opponent it's</p>
<p> probably not a bad idea to say so. So that when you disagree with</p>
<p> your opponent you get listened to a lot more intently. Perhaps my</p>
<p> opponent might have adopted that attitude when we achieved a settlement</p>
<p> of the Native Title dispute. Because he is not going to change the</p>
<p> legislation if he happened to win the next election. And I think there</p>
<p> is a message coming from the Australian people that they don't</p>
<p> like automatic confrontation. They want us to disagree when we really</p>
<p> passionately disagree, but when we don't disagree they want us</p>
<p> to move onto the next issue. I think that is another reason that sort</p>
<p> of produced that situation.</p>
<p>And I think it is also right to say that there were elements in the</p>
<p> campaign run by that Party that attracted bigotry and intolerance</p>
<p> in the Australian community. And I want to say to all you here tonight</p>
<p> that one of the proudest boasts of the Liberal Party of Australia</p>
<p> is that it is the most representative, inclusive of all of the great</p>
<p> political movements in our nation. The Liberal Party is the Party</p>
<p> that ended the White Australia Policy. The Liberal Party is the Party</p>
<p> that welcomed millions of migrants to Australian shores after World</p>
<p> War II, I acknowledge of course, also the contribution of Arthur Calwell</p>
<p> as Minister for Immigration in the post-war Labor Government.</p>
<p>And I want to say that whatever debate might now rage about the level</p>
<p> of immigration in Australia, there can be no argument that immigration</p>
<p> has made an invaluable an incalculable, an enormous contribution to</p>
<p> the development of the modern, thriving, self respecting country that</p>
<p> we have. And I honestly can't imagine Australia of 1998 without</p>
<p> the contribution of people from Europe, from the Middle East, from</p>
<p> Asia, from the rest of the world. And I want to say to you very, very</p>
<p> unambiguously that tolerance and acceptance of people irrespective</p>
<p> of their racial or ethnic background is a cornerstone of the Australian</p>
<p> nation of a fair go.</p>
<p>And it was suggested the other day that we should in future say to</p>
<p> the rest of the world we don't want anybody who comes into this</p>
<p> country who can't speak English before they come here. Now, I</p>
<p> can accept that you should have an immigration policy that gives a</p>
<p> weighting and loading in favour of those who have a knowledge of the</p>
<p> English language. But the idea that you should have a policy that</p>
<p> said if you can't speak English you are not allowed is foolish,</p>
<p> and it is self-denying and it is self-defeating. We would never had</p>
<p> had probably that great heart surgeon who died tragically a few years</p>
<p> ago, Victor Chang, or Sir Arvi Parbo who was born in Estonia and went</p>
<p> on to become Chairman of the ÂBig Australian', one of the</p>
<p> great success stories of post-war migration. And I did a quick calculation</p>
<p> the other day. I'd be seven shy in my own Federal Parliamentary</p>
<p> Liberal Party if we had applied that doctrine, because no less than</p>
<p> seven of my colleagues who sit with me in the Federal Parliamentary</p>
<p> Party came to this country without the knowledge of a word of English.</p>
<p> So when you apply that sort of approach retrospectively, you realise</p>
<p> how idiotic it is.</p>
<p>Now, by all means, let us have a debate about migration but let it</p>
<p> be debated with the world knowing the starting point for the Liberal</p>
<p> Party. And the starting point for the Liberal Party is a commitment</p>
<p> to tolerance, a commitment to absolute opposition to any kind of racism,</p>
<p> a belief that we must have a non-discriminatory immigration policy</p>
<p> and the recognition of the contribution of millions of people from</p>
<p> different parts of the world to the unique character of Australian</p>
<p> society in 1998.</p>
<p>Now, of course we must all remember that the bond that unites all</p>
<p> of us above and beyond any other loyalty or commitment is our commitment</p>
<p> to the Australian nation. And nobody has a more deeply embedded, if</p>
<p> you like, old-fashioned belief in the intrinsic value of being an</p>
<p> Australian than I do, and I am immensely proud on all occasions to</p>
<p> speak in front of this magnificent flag, which represents in my view</p>
<p> the best expression of our national unity.</p>
<p>And I think modern society is very very much in the art of good Government</p>
<p> in modern society, is very much about hanging on to those things from</p>
<p> our past that continue to serve us well, but being willing to throw</p>
<p> out those things that no longer serve us well. And that's why</p>
<p> I believe in keeping our present flag. It's why I believe that</p>
<p> the institutions of Parliamentary democracy and the rule of law and</p>
<p> the sense of the Australian Âfair go' ethos, and our pioneer</p>
<p> spirit and our commitment to volunteerism, that all of those things</p>
<p> are precious assets that we should hold onto, not only as Liberals,</p>
<p> but as Australians.</p>
<p>But equally, we should recognise where we've got dead wood that's</p>
<p> got to be thrown out. And one of the biggest pieces of dead wood we</p>
<p> have at the moment, if I can return to a subject on which I am greatly</p>
<p> warmed, and that is the inadequacy of our taxation system.</p>
<p>I mean, it is the last piece of economic dead wood that Australia</p>
<p> has, and I think it is very very important that we retain the verve,</p>
<p> the commitment, the zeal. Now, I know some people will say it is risky.</p>
<p> Of course it is. Changing anything is risky. And if you want a quiet</p>
<p> ride, if you want nothing to happen, if you want us to retreat into</p>
<p> a policy vacuum, then don't talk to me. I'm not interested,</p>
<p> and you won't be interested in my either. But if you want me</p>
<p> to continue to say what I believe is good for Australia, what I believe</p>
<p> to be the contribution that the Liberal Party at a federal level can</p>
<p> make to Australia's future, then I think we have to remain very</p>
<p> very strongly committed to those goals that we have identified. And</p>
<p> I ask you just to think for a moment where we would be now in the</p>
<p> light of the Asian economic downturn if we had not taken the measures</p>
<p> that we took to get our budget in order two-and-a-half years ago.</p>
<p>I mean, Mr Beazley only left us with an annual deficit of $10.5 billion</p>
<p> dollars. He only left us with accumulated debt of $95 to $100 billion.</p>
<p> He only left us with interest rates that are 3% - 4% higher than they</p>
<p> are now. In fact, we now have the lowest interest rates for thirty</p>
<p> years in Australia. And in two-and-a-quarter years we have turned</p>
<p> that $10.5 billion of deficit into a surplus of $2.7 billion. And</p>
<p> we have done it without any help from Mr Beazley. At every turn he</p>
<p> has obstructed us. Not only did he leave us with the problem but he's</p>
<p> tried to sabotage us fixing the problem. I mean, that is the ultimate</p>
<p> double whammy against the national interest. But despite that opposition,</p>
<p> despite that hostility, we have turned that problem around. And another</p>
<p> thing that he left us with was the appalling Native Title mess. The</p>
<p> great sort of portrait artist, my predecessor as Prime Minister, the</p>
<p> man who painted the big picture. A huge picture of confusion in relation</p>
<p> to Native Title. We said before the last election that we would fix</p>
<p> that problem, and it has turned out to be even more difficult than</p>
<p> I imagined at the time, but finally, as a result of the negotiations</p>
<p> that I conducted with Senator Harradine, we have brought about a result</p>
<p> which is honourable and fair to all sections of the Australian community.</p>
<p>And the reason why I held out for the changes we ultimately won, was</p>
<p> that what the Senate gave to us a few months ago did not respect a</p>
<p> principle that I regard as very important, and that principle is that</p>
<p> all sections of the Australian community should be treated equally.</p>
<p> I'd support the principle of Native Title. The principle of Native</p>
<p> Title laid down the Mabo case, and having read that case from cover</p>
<p> to cover is a principle that I have no argument with but what I did</p>
<p> not support was the Native Title Act passed by the Labor Government</p>
<p> which gave to one section of the Australian community legal rights</p>
<p> and procedures that were not available to other sections of the Australian</p>
<p> community in a similar position. And that is what I opposed and that</p>
<p> is what I fought to change and that is what I am happy to say to you</p>
<p> tonight has been changed as a result of the amending legislation that</p>
<p> went through the Senate two nights ago.</p>
<p>And now I believe that we can now get on with delivering some outcomes.</p>
<p> We can now sweep away the phoney claims. We can respect the genuine</p>
<p> claims. We can have an upsurge of mining investment. We can have a</p>
<p> removal of the doubt over farming areas of Australia, and I predict</p>
<p> now, no matter what has been said by the new Premier of Queensland,</p>
<p> I predict that we'll end up with a uniform national system, because</p>
<p> that's the sensible thing that we ought to have and I'm</p>
<p> sure that's a goal that any sensible Premier no matter what State</p>
<p> he or she leads and any sensible Prime Minister would work towards.</p>
<p> And I'm very pleased that we've resolved that very difficult</p>
<p> issue. It was certainly the most challenging socio-legal and constitutional</p>
<p> issue that I have grappled with in the 24 years that I have been in</p>
<p> Australian politics. And I acknowledge very readily the contribution</p>
<p> that Senator Brian Harradine made to the resolution of that dispute.</p>
<p> He's a man with whom I do not share on all occasions a coincidence</p>
<p> of views on economic issues. Although there are many social issues</p>
<p> on which our views are closer. But on economic issues we don't</p>
<p> always agree, but he is a person of his word, he is a man of integrity</p>
<p> and he is somebody who's heart is always where Australia's</p>
<p> best interests lie and that's a good enough qualification. He's</p>
<p> a man, in the famous words of Margaret Thatcher, with whom one can</p>
<p> have a sensible discussion or do business in a political sense.</p>
<p>But that's long enough for me to speak to you tonight. You've</p>
<p> been very patient. I know my friends that it is difficult when you've</p>
<p> had a bit of a set back at the polls, but the Liberal Party is a Party</p>
<p> of great resilience and we have the opportunity immediately ahead</p>
<p> of us, whenever the federal election is, and don't take any hint</p>
<p> from my having said Âimmediately ahead of us' - I could</p>
<p> redefine Âimmediately ahead' to mean a couple of years or</p>
<p> a few months or six months or a few weeks. I don't know when</p>
<p> the next election will be, but I do know this, that it will be won,</p>
<p> and it will be won convincingly by the Liberal Party and by the Coalition.</p>
<p>And that path to that victory is policy strength and policy boldness.</p>
<p> The path to that victory is not policy timidity. We won last time</p>
<p> because there was an overwhelming mood for change in the Australian</p>
<p> community and there was a passionate desire to remove my predecessor</p>
<p> from the office of Prime Minister. And they also... a viable stable</p>
<p> alternative. To win again and to win again impressively we must give</p>
<p> to the Australian people a new reason, a new incentive, a new cause,</p>
<p> a new set of principles for the future. And you don't find that</p>
<p> in retreating from policy commitments. You don't find that in</p>
<p> going to water on the things that are important. You find that and</p>
<p> you will gain the respect and the support of the Australian people</p>
<p> if you are prepared to stand your ground and argue your case and say</p>
<p> why it is good for Australia that certain things should be done, and</p>
<p> I've found in the 24 years that I've been in politics that</p>
<p> whenever you are prepared to do that, no matter how difficult it may</p>
<p> seem, in the end the Australian public will support you and will respect</p>
<p> you.</p>
<p>The Australian public will always support reform if you satisfy two</p>
<p> criteria. The first criteria is that you must persuade them that it</p>
<p> is for the good of Australia that you do it. And the second criterion</p>
<p> is that you must satisfy them that it is fair for all Australians.</p>
<p> And when our taxation policy comes out I believe it will triumphantly</p>
<p> satisfy both of those criteria. It will be demonstrated to be good</p>
<p> for Australia and it will be demonstrated to be fair to all Australians.</p>
<p> So my friends, thank you for your loyalty, thank you for your resilience,</p>
<p> thank you for your capacity to bounce back. I thank the Queensland</p>
<p> organisation and all of my colleagues for being here tonight. I wish</p>
<p> you well, I'll be seeing you a lot of you in the weeks and months</p>
<p> ahead and I look forward to another famous victory whenever the next</p>
<p> federal election is held.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p> [ENDS]</p>
