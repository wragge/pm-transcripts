The Federal Government stands in a special relationship to<br />
the A. C. T. community as there is no State or traditional.<br />
local government body in the Territory.;<br />
' The Governmnent: recognised that there was a need for careful<br />
consideration to be given in the process of Government decision<br />
making to aspects which could adversely affect the Territory.<br />

had indirectly caused problems for the local community.<br />

considering A. C. T. matters and will provide a valuable source<br />
of advice to -the Government as well as monitoring Government<br />
