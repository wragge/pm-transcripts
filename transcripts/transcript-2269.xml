WORLD CONFERENCE OF ORGANISATIONS OF<br />
THE TEACHING PRC?' ESSCN<br />
SYDNEY 4 AUGUST 1970<br />
speech by the 2rime Minister, Mr. Joohi Gorton<br />
Mr. President, Distinguished Guests and Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
By way of a preface to what I have to say to you, may I say two things.<br />
One is that I have learnt by experience that I am always so pleased to have the ordeal<br />
of making a speech over that I almost always forget to open whatever it is the speech<br />
is designed to open. And therefore in case this should happen tonight and to be on<br />
the safe side I want at the beginning to make it quite clear that this is the opening<br />
of thi, conference, even if I forget to zcy so at the end'<br />
The other thing which struck me was something you referred to, Sir, in<br />
your speech about a remark made by my colleague, the Commonwealth Minister for<br />
Education, that nobody visits Australia by accident. I always agree with my colleagues,<br />
and I am sure that in the present day, this is en-tirely correct. And yet in this<br />
Bicentenary Year, my mind goes back to a gentleman who probably didn't visit<br />
Australia entirely by design. His name was Captai-n-Cook:<br />
Sir, this is the first international conference of teachers' organisations<br />
ever held in Australia, and it falls in the year designated by the United Nations General<br />
Assembly as " International Education Year". And on behalf of the Australian<br />
Government and people, I welcome you to our country a-: d assure you we are glad<br />
to have you with us as individuals and that we are proud indeed to be the host country<br />
for this international conference.<br />
The conference theme of course is " The Cualities of a Teacher" a<br />
discussion I take it of what qualities are needed to male a good teacher and by<br />
selecting this as the theme, I believe that the organisers of the conference have gone<br />
right to the heart and soul of any education system for physical requirements for<br />
education -buildings, classrooms, libraries, language laboratories and so on, and the<br />
external aids to education such as radio, television, the projector necessary as<br />
they are are no substitute for a good teacher. A3 aids to a good teacher they are<br />
admirable but as a substitute for a good teacher they are abominable. So I add<br />
congratulations to the conference on its choice of a theme,<br />
Now I spend a good deal of my time being told by teachers what to do, and<br />
what not to do and I expect that this will continue ( and I hope it does), so I propose<br />
to seize this opportunity, with all the apprehension proer when a layman speaks<br />
to experts, to put this layman's view of what the aims cf education ought to be, of<br />
how we may best achieve these aims, and of the qualities a teacher needs to play his<br />
full part in this achievement. </p>
<p>Well, what should the aims of education be? It is no good talking of those<br />
aims in phrases such as " modern education for a modern world" or " education geared<br />
to the social needs of the modern community", because I am afraid that on examination<br />
such phrases too often turn out to be only plausible lullabies designed as lullabies to<br />
put the enquiring mind to sleep.<br />
I would suggest that the proper, and primary, and overriding goal of<br />
education is the creation of a community of human beings who are as nearly perfect as<br />
human nature, and the individual variations of talent and personality will allow. This,<br />
you will agree, is quite a goal. Yet I believe it is the ultimate goal and that it is<br />
better for education to fail in the attempt to make a perfect human being than to<br />
succeed in making only a fully competent technician. It is better to try to develop<br />
perfect himan beings through education than to confine ourselves to the subsidiary<br />
goal easier and perhaps more practicable though that may be of trying to turn<br />
our only good scientists, or good engineers, or lawyers, or technicians or teachers.<br />
In the words of Sir Richard Livingstone:-<br />
" May not the desire to make first rate human beings and a<br />
first rate society be a master whom all would serve. To see the vision of<br />
excellence as far as our limitations allow; to get at least a glimpse of<br />
the unchanging values of the eternal and good an: d to ma: e our infinitesimal<br />
contributions towards a society which will embody these values is not that,<br />
in itself, a sufficient motive for life.<br />
I think it is and that is more than you can say for studies confined to electricity,<br />
or the workings of computers, or medicine. Not that these studies are not good and<br />
necessary for they are but they are subsidiary and not an end in themselves.<br />
The good teacher indeed has many such subsidiary tasks widening the<br />
mind and enlarging its interest, training the intelligence, teaching the multitudinous<br />
techniques on which our civilisation is somewhat precariously based but I believe<br />
we could successfully carry through all these subsidiary tasks and still never attain<br />
the true goal of education as I have defined it.<br />
For what raises man above the savage is not his inventions or his science,<br />
his economies or his technology it is the practice of goodness and kindness towards<br />
other men, it is the appreciation of the love of beauty a:. d truth and the application of<br />
reason. And so whatever a child is going to be, whatever speciality he may wish<br />
to study, or need to study in order to make a living, and: however well he may be<br />
taught that speciality, failure to inculcate those qualities means, I suggest that<br />
education has failed to achieve its true goal.<br />
Well, what part do the schools of various kinds play in helping this<br />
achievement and the teachers in those schools for I suggest that each type of school<br />
has its definite function in achieving this aim. / 3 </p>
<p>I suggest that it is the primary and overriding responsibility of the<br />
primary school to teach reading, writing, elementary mathematics, and english<br />
grammar, for those are the tools with which knowledge is mined and unless the child<br />
is adequately provided with such tools, the secondary school and tertiary education<br />
can do little. Nor, I believe, can such skills be taught in an " easy" way. They should<br />
be taught in such a way that in learning them the child automatically learns to sit down<br />
and concentrate, to gain the habit of work, and above all, to develop, as he will under<br />
a good teacher, the faculty of reasoning for himself. All other activities of the<br />
primary school are secondary to these. Good spelling is useful but not essential, as<br />
Shakespeare dramatically showed. The development cf creative work is important<br />
but can t-ke place cut of school as well as in it. The amount of history which can be<br />
taught to a child before the age of eleven is usually meaningless, and almost always<br />
inaccurate and so on.<br />
I do not say the primary school should ignore these activities. Not at all,<br />
but I do say that the good primary school teacher will keep them in their proper<br />
perspective and that is subordinate to the tas: k of turn_. g our a child who can write<br />
legibly, express simple thoughts clearly and unambiguously by the use of good grammar,<br />
read with ease, solve simple mathematical problems and reason out from data which<br />
he knows to be true, why something else which he does not know must in fact be<br />
true. And so what qualities does a primary school teacher need to do this? It<br />
is claimed that one essential is a university degree and additional years of teacher<br />
training. With some trepidation I challenge this. Such qualifications, of course, are<br />
useful and helpful, but I doubt whether they are essential, in the sense that no one<br />
can be a good primary school teacher without them, and I am sure that such qualifications<br />
in themselves or of themselves, and them alone do not automatically make a good<br />
teacher. The qualities needed for a really good primary school teacher are<br />
dedication the feeling that one is following a calling, a vocation, which alone can<br />
give full satisfaction in work; a genuine love of children which accepts the undoubted<br />
fact that they can on occasion be absolute little horrors; a warm feeling of achievement<br />
and adventure when at last, after many attempts to explain something which has not<br />
been understood, the light of understanding suddenly lights the eye of the child being<br />
taught. Such teachers must have the capacity to take each child and break the new<br />
and puzzling situat ion which it is facing into simpler bits. They must discover what<br />
the child does know, as a starting point, and lead its mind in the right order from one<br />
bit to the next until finally the whole is understood. But what those simpler bits are,<br />
and what is the right order, varies with each child and no-one can know it ahead of<br />
time. That is why teaching is an art. / 4 </p>
<p>There are, I think, other requisites for a good primary school teacher.<br />
Firstly, I think he should not be swayed by the tides of fashion in educational theory,<br />
for fashions in educational theory change more slowly but just as surely as do fashions<br />
in skirts. So he should never be swayed to the belief that, even in primary schools,<br />
discipline and hard, repetitive, monotonous work is no longer necessary. It is<br />
necessary where it is essential and it is very often essential.<br />
In any branch of study some facts must be : ingrained on the mind so they<br />
can be brought out at a second's notice and some techniques have to be followed<br />
smoothly, quickly and automatically without conscious thought. So the teacher should<br />
explain why such hard, monotonous work is necessary, He should tell the child the<br />
purpose of learning some particular, repetitive, task so that even if the child doesn't<br />
fully understand that purpose he does at least know that there is one and therefore the<br />
task itself becomes that much less meaningless and arbitrary.<br />
But there are occasions when what I shall call good, old fashioned drill<br />
is necessary and a good teacher should not excuse the pupil from it, for after all,<br />
the task of the teacher is not so much to make learning easy, as to make it an<br />
understandable, a reasonable, a logical and an exciting thing to do.<br />
Secondly, such a teacher should not be so carried away by his belief that<br />
all children should be equal in ability as to shut his eyes to the demonstrable fact<br />
that they are not.<br />
Ruskin wrote<br />
" Two children go to school hand in hand and spell for<br />
half an hour o'er the same page. Through all their<br />
lives never shall they spell from the same page more<br />
one is presently a page ahead.... two pages.... ten<br />
pages and evermore though each toils equally, the<br />
interval enlarges".<br />
The good teacher must accept that. He must encourage that ability not<br />
fight against it, for he cannot destroy ability even in the name of equality but he can<br />
cramp it or maim it. And he will do this just as surely by preventing a child from<br />
developing at his natural pace as he will by trying to force it to develop faster than<br />
it naturally would. I have so far spoken of the qualities necessary for the primary school<br />
teacher. The secondary school teacher of quality needs all these and a greater<br />
specialised knowledge for it is in the secondary school that the mining of knowledge<br />
really begins. It is here that the tools provided by the primary schools are tested.<br />
It is here that the process of specialization starts. All I shall say of this is that<br />
whatever specialization is selected, the centre of studies should be as I said<br />
at the beginning the study of human striving, and hurna:: greatness in action in the<br />
past, and the study of various human ideas of how to build that ideal society, which<br />
gives the greatest possible freedom to each individual, and avoids the licence which<br />
follows if that individual interferes with others' rights. </p>
<p>And also each pupil ought to study at least one subject on the curriculum<br />
so thoroughly, and in such depth, that he begins to know what true knowledge really<br />
is and how much industry, thoroughness, precision, and persistence it requires if<br />
he is to have even a distant sight of it. And so the teacher here needs not only the<br />
qualities of being able to impart knowledge, of being able to make learning an exciting<br />
experience, but also, a much greater knowledge of that subject or subjects which<br />
he teaches. The numbers receiving education in Australia are growing so dramatically,<br />
the numbers of pupils remaining at school to the final year of secondary education<br />
are increasing so greatly, that I doubt if there are enough young Australians possessed<br />
of what I have described as the qualities needed by an ideal teacher.<br />
But it is no bad thing to set out an ideal even if it cannot at once be<br />
attained. And indeed I think that is the object of the thene chosen by this conference.<br />
Sir, I have shown temerity tonight as a layman in speaking to experts,<br />
and I have, I expect, been slightly pompous I hope only slightly, but may I in<br />
conclusion close by saying something on my own behalf which demonstrates that<br />
I have more than a passing interest in this subject.<br />
I was placed in charge of Commonwealth Government activities in<br />
education some seven years ago, and was the first Comrnmonwealth Minister of<br />
Education. At that time the Commonwealth Governmen-t was spending $ 67.5 million<br />
a year. Today it is spending $ 312 million a year some five times as much. I<br />
put into operation a scheme of supplying science laboratories, properly planned and<br />
equipped, to all secondary schools in Australia. I had adopted a scheme to provide<br />
libraries not just repositories for books but modern libraries complete with<br />
teaching aids, in all secondary schools in Australia. I inaugurated a scheme designed<br />
to revolutionise and re-equip all secondary technical schools in Australia. I brought<br />
in a scheme to provide eight now ten million dollars a year for building<br />
teachers colleges. I inaugurated a scheme for providing colleges of advanced<br />
education as alternatives to universities in tertiary education.<br />
I rejected the previous concept that the state should penalise children<br />
whose parents send them to non-government schools by refusing such schools any<br />
assistance from the taxpayers' funds, even though the ; parents of such children<br />
contributed to those funds. I still reject that concept and I am proud to do so, for it<br />
is educationally illiterate and economically absurd.<br />
I put into operation a scheme for providing scholarships for the last two<br />
years of secondary school, and in technical schools.<br />
Sir, I have been interested. And if the ideal physical requirements for<br />
education have not been attained and of course they have not at least we have taken<br />
steps towards such attainment, as you are seeking to tak e steps towards the attainment<br />
of an ideal teacher. Because of that interest that is one reason I have been<br />
emboldened to speak to you tonight. Another is because you all bear such responsibility<br />
for moulding the citizens of the world of tomorrow, and yet another is because you<br />
asked me. I thank you for it and I have done, and this conference is open. </p>
