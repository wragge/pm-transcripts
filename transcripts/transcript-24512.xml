    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of the Commonwealth Government, I acknowledge the passing of the Hon Joan Kirner AC.</p>
<p>Joan Kirner was a significant figure in Victorian Labor Party politics.</p>
<p>She served as Premier of Victoria from 1990 to 1992 and will be remembered as the first woman to hold that office.</p>
<p>In 2012, she was named a Companion of the Order of Australia for âeminent service to the Parliament of Victoria and to the community through conservation initiatives, contributions to gender equality, the development of education and training programs and the pursuit of civil rights and social inclusion.â</p>
<p>Joan Kirner made her mark on Victoria and Australia.</p>
<p>Her service to Victoria, not least through conservation initiatives and contributions to encourage women into politics, was well known.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Commonwealth Government, I extend our condolences to her family and friends.</p>
<p>1 June 2015Â </p>
