J,,! AUSTA8<br />
PRIME MINISTER aN I0? A<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY 11\~<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
For the past week Australia has been host to Mr. Li. Xiannian,<br />
Vice-Premier of China.<br />
He leaves tomorrow for New Zealand.<br />
Against the recent background of worrying international developments<br />
in Afghanistan, Iran and Indo-China, it was heartening to receive<br />
Mr. Li and to review with satisfaction the progress of Australia's<br />
relations with China.<br />
In the 1960s China was in the turmoil of its Cultural Revolution.<br />
Mr. Li was amongst those of China's leaders who were criticised<br />
and who suffered during that Cultural Revolution.<br />
Now, he is number three in a government which wants to put the<br />
Cultural Revolution behind it.<br />
Today China is a great and proud nation. She is committed to a<br />
program of reconstruction and modernisation.<br />
China is drawing on Japan, the United States, Western Europe and<br />
Australia f or trade, technology, investment and other economic<br />
co-operation.<br />
In our discussions, Mr. Li conveyed to me China's desire to<br />
co-operate with us and with our major allies not only in these<br />
areas but also on the major international political problems.<br />
I welcomed this.<br />
China considers that the threat to global stability is Soviet<br />
policies and expansionist activities.<br />
The Soviet Union has been resisted in North Asia and in Western<br />
Europe and thus has brought pressure to bear southward in Afghanistan.<br />
Mr. Li and I agreed that, together with the Western powers and<br />
Japan, we should: work to prevent any further advance by the Soviet<br />
Union; continue to press for Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan;<br />
and continue to press for a Vietnamese withdrawal from Kampuchea.<br />
A decade ago Australia's relations with China did not go beyond<br />
some trading links.<br />
Today, our developing relationship with China is rapidly moving<br />
us towards a relationship similar to that which we have established<br />
with Japan. </p>
<p>China is our fifth largest market and we are China's fourth<br />
largest source of imports-<br />
We have established an important economic interdependence.<br />
While Mr. Li was in Canbexrra we were also able to announce a<br />
further sale of sugar to China 150,000 tonnes for delivery<br />
between May and September this year.<br />
This is the largest ever block sale of Australian sugar to China<br />
and will take our sugar deliveries there this year to a record<br />
figure in excess of 280,0100 tonnes.<br />
Our main export, however, to China remains wheat.<br />
Now, we are selling increasing quantities of iron ore.<br />
We are the sole supplier of iron ore for a new major steel plant<br />
at Baoshan outside Shanghai.,<br />
per cent of the producrt of the Baoshan plant is for China,<br />
per cent for Japan.<br />
In this and other ways our relations. witEh China and Japan will<br />
become increasingly linked.<br />
China and Australia also have common interests in our approach<br />
to the world.-<br />
Many Australians have visited China.<br />
I am sure they would share my belief that, in spite of the cultural<br />
differences, a great breadth of friendship and understanding is<br />
being achieved.<br />
During the visit a science and technology agreement was signed.<br />
Mr. Li also proposed that we negotiate a cultural agreement.<br />
I welcome that proposal aind -hope that an agreement will be signed<br />
soon.<br />
We have welcomed other Chinese leaders to Australia in the past<br />
but Mr. Li is the most senior to come here.<br />
Our discussions reflected the new pragmatism in China and the<br />
degree of confii. dence with which China's new policies are being<br />
pursued. I believe China will continue on this course, to the benefit of<br />
the Chinese people.<br />
China thus remains a priority in our foreign relations, and my<br />
discussions with Mr. Li in the past week have provided a basis<br />
for continued consolidation and growth in that relationship.<br />
