<p>TEXT OF TV PRESS CONFEIhENCE JITH THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE RT. HON. E. G. MENZIES IN SYDNEY2 ON SUNDAY,<br />
APRIL 1961<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Prime Minister can we talk, first of all, about<br />
West New Guinea? Both you and General Nasution have<br />
said that as a result of your talks here in Australia<br />
that the issue over West Now Guinea has been clarified and<br />
has added, perhaps, to cotmton understanding. However the<br />
two views remain quite opposed. Would you say the two<br />
countries have grown farther apart, or closer together?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would say closer togather for two reasons, applying<br />
one each uray; So far as Indonesia is concerned it has<br />
obtained quite readily, a statement by myself that<br />
Australia has no military engagement with the Netherlands<br />
direct or indirect. Ho attached irportanco to that. It<br />
had been said before, but perhaps not by me. So from his<br />
point of view that was something cleared up. And in my<br />
turn I felt that I had cleared up with him pretty<br />
completely the importance that we attach to selfdetermination<br />
for the people of New Guinea, whether in<br />
West Now Guinea or in our section of New Guinea. And I<br />
think that that registered in his mind.<br />
qUESTION: Do you feel, then, that they nay press less vigorously<br />
this claim to West Now Guinea after these talks?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I think that one should assume that they won't<br />
abandon their claim, they'll pursue their claim. But I<br />
think there will be less disposition, perhaps, to permit<br />
people to suggest a forceful solution of the matter. I<br />
think that the General means it when he says " We are not<br />
going to use force to establish our case". But that he<br />
will use propaganda, all these other means that are<br />
available, is quite clear. In fact he was very frank<br />
about it.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think that the stand that we have taken may<br />
increase the influence of the Communist Party in<br />
Indonesia?<br />
9PRIME MINISTER: I don't think so. The Communist Party in Indonesia, I<br />
gather, is on the bandwagon, to use our expression on<br />
this matter. It is among the leaders of the demand for<br />
lest New Guinea. Then thero is a difference of opinion.<br />
Some people there think that if the claim succeeded and<br />
the Dutch handed over West New Guinea then the position of<br />
the Government against the Communists would be<br />
strengthened. I would take leave to doubt that. I would<br />
think that if they could claim that they had a big hand<br />
in ; etting West Now Guinea that their position might be<br />
strengthened. But anyhow that is an Indonesian problem<br />
at the moment, not mine though, of course, if the<br />
Communists did a lot of good, made a lot of advance in<br />
Indonesia that would be our problem.<br />
QUESTION: Do you feel that the possibility of an incident<br />
creating some greater conflict, which General Nasution<br />
mentioned when he first came here, has disappeared now?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It would be saying too much to say that it had<br />
disappeared. But I think the dan~ er has receded. Because<br />
this business of infiltrators, and soue of them with<br />
arms, has been discussed and has been made public.<br />
Everybody now knows that this kind of thing has been<br />
going on. And I think, thoreforu, that there will be a<br />
little less csposition. </p>
<p>QUESTION: What will australia do, though, if such a conflict<br />
does arise, whether it is limited guerilla activity that<br />
you have referred to yourself, or open conflict?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Now that is a question that you really shouldn't ask<br />
me at this stage. I said all I had to say about that in<br />
my statement in the House.<br />
QUESTION: Can I ask you this, Sir? On that don't you think it<br />
would be of advantage if the Indonesians knew the type of<br />
policy you were envisaging in such circumstances to<br />
prevent then possibly bringing about a fait accompli in<br />
that area?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think so, no. What I indicated in my<br />
statement in the House was that if anything of that kind,<br />
if force were used I've forgotten whether I used the<br />
actual expression either in wholesale or in retail and<br />
this gave rise to arried conflict then of course we<br />
couldn't profess not to be interested in it, deeply<br />
interested in it. So are the other nations affected by<br />
these natters. The United States would be deeply interest<br />
-ed in it; Great Britain, all the SEATO powers would be<br />
greatly interested in it. And then I indicated it was<br />
something the United Nations itself couldn't ignore; and<br />
that what any other nations irrespective of such an<br />
intervention by the United Nations what they were to do,<br />
they would have to determine. But I don't think that it<br />
is wise in a natter of this kind for us to be sabrerattling.<br />
There's enough of it been going on; I'd<br />
like to keep it outside<br />
QUESTION: Do you have any fears Sir, that the President of the<br />
United States might adopt an attitude towards Indonesia<br />
that would be opposed to your onm?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That would be opposed to mine? No, I have no fear.<br />
It night be differcnt fron nine. You see what I mean by<br />
that? It may be that the President I don't know, this<br />
is pure speculation would find his nind attracted by<br />
some forn of Trusteeship for West New Guinea. I mean<br />
this thing is floated around. Not the kind of trusteeship<br />
that was proposed by Malaya which was not a true<br />
Trusteeship under the United Nations, but was an interim<br />
mnanagenent, so to speak, before handing it over to<br />
Indonesia. Well, the President may very well be<br />
attracted by some idea of Trusteeship. We don't reject<br />
soe idea of Trusteeship; neither indeed, so far as I<br />
know, do the Dutch. It is when you get down to the brass<br />
tacks of it, what kind of Trusteeship, who should be the<br />
Trustee, who should be the Administering powers this is<br />
the kind of thing that they . rgue about in the General<br />
Assembly of the United Nations for about a year. We<br />
night not be exactly identical in our views that's<br />
the point that I want<br />
QUESTION: In the event of there being conflict you have mentioned<br />
that perhaps the United Nations would be interested. Is<br />
there a possibility, do you think, that a United Nations<br />
attitude may be, in fact, against Australia.' s stand on<br />
this, with a majority of say the Afro-Asian nations<br />
supporting Indonesia's claims?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The first thing that would be done if this were taken<br />
to the United Nations would be that they would call for<br />
a cessation of hostilities. That, one :; ould expect<br />
would bring to an end for the time being, these matters<br />
of hostilities fighting, the conflict on the spot. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Then you are quite right: if the United Nations then<br />
said, " Well this has become a matter of international<br />
significance and we therefore propose to investigate it",<br />
and having investigated it proposed then tu alter the<br />
sovereignty of host New Guinea, and they had the numbers<br />
for it, well that could happen. You are asking me to<br />
speculate now about something that is a contingency on a<br />
contingency. Sir don't you feel that there is a contradiction in<br />
the policy of one, recognition of sovereignty and two,<br />
the insistence upon, or the preference for selfdetermination<br />
on the Australian Government's part? Is<br />
there any way in which the securing of self-determination<br />
for the indigenous people can be brought about by<br />
Australia? Could it go to some tribunal to get that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, I don t think so. I don't see this conflict that<br />
you are speaking about. We have sovereignty over at<br />
least portion of our New Guinea territory and we are the<br />
Trust power in relation to the other. We recognise<br />
Dutch sovereignty. But the whole point about selfdetermination<br />
is that the colonial power, so to<br />
describe it, having sovereignty, exercises that by<br />
pursuing a policy designed ultimately to give the<br />
indigenous people the right to determine their own<br />
future. That is an exercise of sovereignty.<br />
( rJESTION: Sir, if Indonesia got control of West New Guinea<br />
legally and had a sovereignty that you recognised would<br />
there be any chance of the indigenous natives of West<br />
New Guinea achieving self-determination at any time in<br />
the future?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: None.<br />
QUESTION: That would be the end of it. There would be a<br />
conflict then?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That I thought was made quite clear by General<br />
Nasution. It was one of the matters of discussion<br />
between us. Because I was saying, " We think that selfdetermination<br />
of these peoples is of the essence. The<br />
-, utch have promised it; the Dutch have made an agreement<br />
with us" which I quoted in the House " undertaking to:<br />
pursue this end and you won't have it". And he said, " No,<br />
we won't, because we regard West Now Guinea as part of<br />
Indonesia, not as a colony of Java and Sumatra or<br />
whatever it may be, but as part of Indonesia, and it<br />
therefore would have no more right of self-determination<br />
than Sumatra would, or the Celebes, or whatever it may<br />
be". So that there is a marked distinction between the<br />
Indonesian approach and our own, and the approach of the<br />
Dutch. And I think this has been tbrought out into sharp<br />
relief as a result of these discussions, in a perfectly<br />
friendly way. There is the point of difference.<br />
QUESTION: On the other hand we have shown our interest in selfdetermination;<br />
and yet we have said in the agreeuent<br />
that we will respect any decision mutually reached by<br />
the Dutch and Indonesians about this which, in fact,<br />
would not involve self-determination by the people of<br />
West New Guinea, would it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, I see what you mean. You think there is a<br />
conflict between the idea of sovereignty and the idea of<br />
self-determination. I don't think so. We start off </p>
<p>about West New Guinea by saying " We recognise<br />
sovereignty". We want our own sovereignty to be<br />
recognised and we therefore respect the sovereignty of<br />
the other man. One of the faculties of the sovereign<br />
state is that if it wants to deal with its territory in<br />
some way, it nay. It has agreed with us that it will<br />
deal with that territory by producing self-determination.<br />
But if it made an agree-ent tomorrow with Indonesia to<br />
transfer Jest New Guinea to Indonesia, in the exercise of<br />
its sovereignty, that of course w) uld be an end of selfdetermination.<br />
But it wouldn't prove that our policy and<br />
approach had been wrong. It would merely mean that the<br />
Dutch themselves had changed the policy that is contained<br />
in the Agreement with Australia. And we would regret it,<br />
of course. Sovereignty is the paramount thing because it<br />
is the beginning of the whole matter. Without sovereignty<br />
it is idle to be talking to people about giving them<br />
something in the way of self-deterination because only a<br />
sovereign power can do that.<br />
QUESTION: And yet in pushing self-determination hard do you<br />
feel that wo may arouse snoe cynicism in certain quarters<br />
about this very thing? I mean for instance, do you think<br />
people may ask if Australia believes in self-determination<br />
for the natives of South Africa, for the Bantu?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, of course, here you are raising the whole issue<br />
of South African policy. You have to remember that the<br />
Bantu population is in the sane country, South Africa,<br />
within the Union of S. uth Africa, within the sane country<br />
as the European people. It is not a case where you have<br />
a separate race in a separate cor. mmunity in a spearate<br />
spot, as we have with New Guinea. If you have a<br />
geographical area like New Guinea, and there you have a<br />
lot of Papuan people living in it, you can then talk<br />
about self-determination for those people in that area,<br />
because the problen lends itself to separate treatment.<br />
But if we had the Papuans mixed up with our own people in<br />
the Continent of Australia, you wouldn't be talking about<br />
self-detormination because that would be an irrelevancy<br />
you would be talking about racial policy, you would be<br />
deciding whether you wore going to have intoeration or<br />
separatencss; but you wuldn't be talking about selfdetermination<br />
in the case of a com-: unity which itself was<br />
a ringled community.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Menzies, could I switch to a local issue? Your<br />
figures for those registored for oeploymnt are in the<br />
neighbourhood of 82,000. Does the Govornoment regard this<br />
as a satisfactory figure? Or does it propose remedial<br />
action on that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, you Imow, this expression " a satisfactory<br />
figure" is a little bit . m. biguous, because if I say " Yes"<br />
then I will be told I an all in favour of having 80,000<br />
unemployed, which I am not. No figure of unemployment is<br />
satisfactory so long as it exceeds the inevitable limited<br />
numbor of people who will be unemployable and there are<br />
some such, of course. But intrinsically, this is not a<br />
critical figure, of course. The work fdrce today in<br />
Australia is estinated to bo 4,200,000. And if, out of<br />
that number, you h: ive 80,000 who are, at a given moment<br />
registered for neployment, with of course another 20,000<br />
vacancies bein advertised at the sane time, that is not<br />
a critical figure, that . dosn't present a major problem.<br />
But if it grow then of course nobody could ijnore it if<br />
the nurboers grew. </p>
<p>QUESTION: The point is, Sir, that the Government does rocognise<br />
it as a problem?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Look we exaggerate thle problem not for a<br />
nonent. But so much do we have it on our mind th? every<br />
week in Cabinet we have a report on the figures an.' iwe<br />
have some discussion about where there nay be a pach of<br />
unemployment, and what may be done about it. It's veiy<br />
much in our minds.<br />
QUESTION: Well how do you look at Queensland, Sir, where the<br />
figure is<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Queensland, of course, will always have a certain<br />
amount of unemploynent, technically, because Queensland<br />
has so nuch seasonal employment. If the cane cutting<br />
season is long, then the people who are standing off are<br />
fewer in numbers. If the cane cutting season is shorter,<br />
then you will have people registered for employment rather<br />
more numerously. Sane way with the neat season, so much<br />
affected by the weather by whether they have had proper<br />
rains in the cattle country beoause this will determine<br />
the length of the killing season in places like<br />
Rockhampton and Gladstone. Therefore there will always be<br />
a slightly fluctu-. tir g figure in Queensland.<br />
QU.. O: As you do reoard it as a problem, Sir, though not a<br />
grave one at this stage, what remedial action lo you<br />
contemplate for the foreseeable future?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, well, look I'm not prepared to say that at this<br />
stage because as I say, the problem doesn't call for<br />
drastic action at the present time. What you do is to<br />
have a look at Queensland, to take that example, and say,<br />
" Well now is there really a serious pocket of unemploynent<br />
chere; and if so where?" Then you consider whether<br />
by some adjustment of your public works programne, or by<br />
some dealing with the housing programj. io, you night be<br />
able to bring about some relief in that area. But I an<br />
not going to be dogmatic about this because that very<br />
problem is at present under examination.<br />
QUESTION: Would yju say, Sir, that likewise the repercussions of<br />
the so-called " credit squeeze" don't call for drastic<br />
action at the moment? In the way of remedy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, you know, there seemed to be profound differences<br />
of opinion on this natter. I noticed in your State and<br />
mine that is if you are still a Victorian that there<br />
is a widespread belief that the right cure now is to<br />
restore import licensing, to slacken out on the credit<br />
squeeze.<br />
QUESTION: I don't think everybody in Victoria shares that view,<br />
Sir, but I do think even some of your own friends feel<br />
that perhaps the width of your own responsibilities today<br />
and the pressure of day to day ev-nts moan that there<br />
isn't sufficient attention possible for the job of<br />
winning the next election right at this moment.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, it's interesting that y.) u should say that,<br />
because I had a conference yesterday with what they call<br />
the " organisational planners" in my Party, and they, and<br />
I, had a very strong belief in common and that was that<br />
we were : oing to win the next Election. And we<br />
discussed ways and means of d: ing it. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Did you fix any taret, Sir, of what would be your<br />
employnent figur for round about the election period?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, no. All these estiratos of figures are, of course,<br />
as you know, rather speculative.<br />
QUESTION: What has happened, Sir, to one or two of the ie<br />
loosely described, perhaps, as " planks of platfo:.--ch'at<br />
haven't been mentioned for a little while constitutional<br />
reform? Was there not an all-Party report subitted to<br />
you on this apparently very vital question? Are we going<br />
to hear any more of that in the course of this year, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well we had a debate about it the other day in the<br />
House. The Opposition, very naturally, is warmly in<br />
favour of the entire report because it embodies<br />
practically every constitutional principle they srcand for,<br />
QUESTION: You haven't particularly fond memories of referendums<br />
Ithink, Sir, have you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't mind telling you I am a complete sceptic<br />
about these referonduis: ' When in doubt, vote " No"'<br />
QUESTION: And will constitutional reform require a referendum?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, yes, oh, yes. Therefore you have to consider very<br />
carefully not only whether it would be a. reeable to have<br />
a particular am. endmont in the Constitution, because on a<br />
number of occasions it would be, but you have to consider<br />
' Will the people vote to include this amendment'? And<br />
past experience, you know, doesn't lend nuch support to<br />
the view that they will. Because the Constitution is a<br />
complicated docunent, not very many people have read it,<br />
and fewer have understood it. Judges have disagreed<br />
about it; and the man down the street who is a sensible<br />
chap says, " Well if the Judges can't make up their minds<br />
what this means, who am I to say so?"<br />
QUESTION: Does that mean, Sir, that there will be no<br />
constitutional reform proposed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Let me choose ny words with some care. I don't<br />
anticipate that you will have a constitutional referendum<br />
before or at the election.<br />
QUESTION: Now, Sir, if we could ask : f one of these other<br />
things that have been oposed by your Party. Will we<br />
shortly hear of any progress in regard to restrictive<br />
practices, and the measures necessary to eliminate them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm sorry, old boy, but you have been so occupied with<br />
such success in the television world that you haven't<br />
been reading your parliamentary debates. Because the<br />
Attorney-General has boon questioned about this matter<br />
several times. And I can tell you that he takes this<br />
problem very seriously; he has done an enormous amount of<br />
work on it; he invostigated when he was over in Aerica<br />
to see how they were handling their problem; we had<br />
another investigation made in London about the working of<br />
their Restrictive Practices Act. It is not a matter on<br />
which the Commonwealth has single power. Therefore the<br />
Attorney-General himself is in consultation with the<br />
States on this matter. But it is not to be hurried. It<br />
is no use pretending that you have discovered the answer<br />
to all this, and putting duwn a piece of legislation that<br />
can have a coach and six driven through it. But the work<br />
is being continued. I myself attach very great importance </p>
<p>QUESTION: to securing the best possible measure that can be got in<br />
collaboration with the States.<br />
Have you any hope, Sir, that at least the broad<br />
principles can be stated in your Policy Speech wh ch<br />
should be the end of this year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would hope so.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, there has been a great deal of talk about the<br />
burden that you bear carrying the External Affairs portfolio<br />
as well as the Prime Ministership. Is there any<br />
chance that you will be relinquishing that portfolio?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know yet. All I can say is that I have had<br />
two najor operations in the capacity n-t intc':-..<br />
operations major operations in the field of rYl:; r. al<br />
Affairs, that relating to the Prine Ministers'<br />
Conference and South Africa an'. the attendant mi. a-; turs,<br />
and the other matters on which I spoke the other day. I<br />
don't think anybody, really, on either side of the H* ouseo<br />
felt that I wasn't informed on the matters that I dealt<br />
with.<br />
QUESTION: Without suggesting that, Sir, don't you feel that a<br />
weakness could be that in this day and age there must, of<br />
necessity, be contact with Asian heads of State, and your<br />
dual role which demands your presence at Primeo Iinistrs'<br />
Conferences, for exaniple, and things like that, "-n. ter<br />
restricts your ability to , o to Asia to see thes0 ., eople?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Look if that is a disability in ne, let me remind you<br />
that it is a disability which is shared by the Prime<br />
Minister of Now Zealand and by the Prime Minister of India<br />
QUESTION: By the way, Sir, wasn't there criticisn of that by<br />
your : wn High Cornissioner in India, Mr. Crocker, in a<br />
departmental document?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Was there? Well, I haven't seen it. You seem to have<br />
an infra-red eye.<br />
QUESTION: When Lord Casey was Prine Minister up until January<br />
last year, I think, it would be true to say that he<br />
travelled very intensively in Asia. Do you feel that you<br />
have been able to do that as nuch as you would have<br />
perhaps liked because of the fact that you occupy both<br />
portfolios?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think I have done it enough. Y. u can overdo this<br />
business, you know. I find when I an talking to Foreign<br />
Secretaries around the world, both in aeigland and in<br />
iWashington, that they are all getting a little tired of<br />
the idea that a F: reign Secretary, or a Foreign Minister,<br />
has to be in the air all the tine. They have been forced<br />
to the conclusion that if there is to be continuity of<br />
policy there has to be a great deal of work done at the<br />
centre, and more responsibility imposed on Abassadors.<br />
And consequently if I wore Foreign Minn ister Minister for<br />
External Affairs, and nothing else, you wouldn't get me<br />
hurtling around the world at a great rate, at intervals o:<br />
a nonth or two. I'n not criticising anybody. I would<br />
find that, nyself, inconsistent with the proper performance<br />
of my policy work. Other people thrive on it. John<br />
Foster Dulles absolutely throve ontravelling around.<br />
QUESTION: At the other end of the scale, Sir. we have Mr.<br />
Khrushchev who does get around a grea deal, doesn't he? </p>
<p>Presumably because he fools that it is worthwhile,<br />
particularly in the part of the world in which we have<br />
this vital stake, in sia.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: But you nust always ronember that Mr. Khrush. r-v. has<br />
an extraordinarily what shall I say?-well-dis.:-, lined<br />
administrative structure under hi., and is, hirs: o7<br />
essentially, the reatest living Minister for Pc-, ania<br />
and propagandca, he finds, is nore usofully exhibi..:.<br />
outside his own country. And so he -oes.<br />
QU-STION: Do you ever attempt to enwy him these advantages of<br />
his efficient propaganda<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Never! You see I have a reasonable oxpLect-tiov1 tho. t<br />
when I an dismissed I'll still be alive.<br />
feel that this is an enormous advantage in c<br />
country. ( Laughter)<br />
QUESTION: Sir, if we c., uld ask you a qu.-sti n as PrimLe i, . ister<br />
and Minister for External Affairs, Yo-u must be v y<br />
disturbed about the events in Laos the last cuup'. of<br />
days. Do you regard then as very dangorous?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I do. This thin isn't going very well., the<br />
SEATO meeting we were aobl to get a unanimous on the<br />
part of the S.., TO powers in favour of having an d, .~ endent,<br />
united, neutral Laos, quite independent r'l<br />
by the Soviet Union or the Comnmunist powers., . l<br />
by the Wostern world. That was the objectiv, . n<br />
order to get that a proposal was made by Great 1 M. jn<br />
which was approved of by the United States for r : easoefire,<br />
for the re-constitution . f the Internati-,.: l<br />
Control Comission and the re-cAlling of a 14-pc o; er<br />
Conference. All this looked to be good. And the Soviet<br />
Union itself, after a little delay, agreed and has joined<br />
in the call for a cease-fire. I hope, bona fide.<br />
QUESTION: You have some doubts about that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Certainly Because the fighting has gone on. The<br />
Pathet Lao has been fighting and fighting since, making<br />
advances since. I would like to be sure that the Soviet<br />
Union has exercised its imeo nse influence with the Pathet<br />
Lao, the Comnunist group, to bring about a cuaso-firo.<br />
But as it is the fighting is going on. And roc-lly, as at<br />
today, as you know, the position is very serious. It may<br />
be that before the Conference can over be in there will<br />
be a conquest of the essential areas of the country and<br />
once the Cor. unists become established in that fashion<br />
it is not a simple natter to get rid of then; and<br />
indeed every SE._ TO power will have to think very hard in<br />
the next day or two about the circunstance that arises<br />
should the capital, the r:) yal capital and the administrative<br />
capital, both of them, fall to the Cor. unists.<br />
QUESTION: Is SEATO allowed to intervene in Laos, as there has<br />
boon no indictable invasion?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It could intervene un. ler the South East ,. sian Treaty<br />
on the request of the King.<br />
QUESTION: Has ti re been such a request, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, not up to the uonent.<br />
QUESTION: Do you anticipate Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know. </p>
<p>QUESTION: I think a point that viewers would like very much to<br />
hear from you, Sir is what you consider nenbers of the<br />
British Commonwealth still have in cor. mon? And \ hrt do<br />
you see as the future? A lot of people, I thin, ': nk<br />
that there is a slow disintegration, or an end1' the<br />
worth of the Comr. ionwealth.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I think, in spite of what has happenoed, . at tbo<br />
great thing we have in common is that we all rec,<br />
that we stand in a rather special relationship to eoc.<br />
other naybe rather undefinable but a rathe:--<br />
relationship to each other which enables us t: o . ct a;-t<br />
Prime Ministers' Conference and have a discussloi,<br />
the doors, of a kind that I don't think you couldc Cs.-; L; y<br />
have in any committee or forum of the United fntj* i'::<br />
Now that is a tremendous advantage. We c:<br />
other pretty well and we can talk quite<br />
other. We can assist each other, if you . o3 I<br />
that way, with advice on matters falling wi"'-o-' tC rn<br />
experience. My trouble, essentially, abc. tt thiJ. &gt; t one<br />
was that I felt that South Africa, being . ff! et put out<br />
on a matter which was a problem of policy '.. s: idj<br />
boundaries of South Africa, may, if we are noet. ' ul.<br />
give rise to further difficulties in the we<br />
begin to talk, in the Prime Ministers' t<br />
our internal, what we all think of our int..-il " s,<br />
then I don't see any end to it. Perhaps<br />
to the Cornonwealth by these recent event i. ll. n<br />
realisation into the minds of the other irO.;<br />
countries that this process is not to be l c,' 2.<br />
continue, except perhaps under the nost<br />
circumstances.<br />
QUESTION: Was that your motive, Sir in raising the ' i: d.. 3<br />
Australia question so promptly when this thing happenqd?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'd like to make it clear that I didn't raise the<br />
White Australia question nor do I ever refer to the<br />
White Australia policy, as a matter of fact: I refer to<br />
our immigration policy. That matter was promptly raised<br />
by Sir Edgar Whitehead of Rhodesia ad was given some<br />
prominence. That having boon raised I, in private, took<br />
the opportunity of pointing out to my dolloa~ as in the<br />
Conference that that was our business, just as wvhat<br />
happened to the Chinese inlialaya was Malay's b usiness and<br />
not mine, just as what oight happen about the Tamils in<br />
Ceylon was the business of Ceylon not nine.<br />
QUESTION: This support, Sir, for domestic jurisdiction which<br />
you have adhered to in the Colrmonwealth is not so now, in<br />
the United Nations, where Australia recently cast a vote<br />
condemning apartheid. Is there some danger, do you<br />
think, that we may be accused of doing one thing in the<br />
Commonwealth, and another thing in the United Nations<br />
over this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have been. I have been accused. An eminent<br />
journal in this city, when the vote had been cast in the<br />
United Nations, said that I was the grotost political<br />
acrobat of all time. But when I nmde my full statement on<br />
this matter to Parliament and had explained our actions<br />
on this matter Igot a very commendatory leading article<br />
in the sane paper. So the acrobatics were not all one gvy.<br />
QUESTION: Why were thc.' e acrobatics, as you put it, Sir? Why<br />
did we change our policy at U. N? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: Well, the position historically, in the United<br />
Nations was that Groat Britain and Australia had, over a<br />
number of years, voted a. ainst this ros. lution not<br />
because they were in favour of apartheid, but because<br />
they said that this was a natter of domestic jurisdiction,<br />
This tine Great Britain altered itL vote from opposition<br />
to straight out support.<br />
QUESTION: Was that a surprise to you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It was. A complete surprise. I had knowledge of it a<br />
few hours before the vote was to be taken. In the<br />
result they said, " We raintain domestic jurisdiction, we<br />
maintain our attitude on that; but in the events that<br />
have happened and particularly the removal of S ) uth<br />
Africa from the Commonwealth, this matter now has<br />
achieved international si. nificanco, and we therefore<br />
propose to vote fcr it". And Aust-L-lia? What would have<br />
happened to us if we had been the only Corinonwealth<br />
country standing out sitting . ver there with Portgual?<br />
We would have been r. isrepresented all over Asia about our<br />
attitude; and we were not going to be misrepresented. We<br />
had had enough. We weren't gping to be misrepirosonted any<br />
further. So we voted with the United Kingdom. </p>
