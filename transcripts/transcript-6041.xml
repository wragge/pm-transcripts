AUST A I. IA t<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA THURSDAY MARCH 3 1983<br />
LABOR'S TAX DECEIT<br />
Labor's tax advertisemenls are a fraud and a cruel deception.<br />
Not only is Mr Hawke now talking about the possibility of not<br />
giving tax cuts at all, but his advertisements neglect the<br />
fact that a hiyhor marginal tax rate would apply to a very<br />
great number of Australians with modest incomes,<br />
In the August Budget, the Government reduced the standard<br />
rate of tax for people carning up to $ 19,500 from 32Â½ to<br />
in the dollar.<br />
Under Labor's proposed tax scales, some 2 million people<br />
earning between $ 13,500 and $ 19,500, would have their Lax<br />
rate put back up to 32-in the dollar.<br />
Mr HawkC doesn't propose putting up the marginal rate for<br />
people earning $ 30,000, $ 40,000 or $ 50,000. He went<br />
straight for middle Australians. That would seem a very odd<br />
priority. That would seem a very odd way of creating<br />
incentives.<br />
Every extra dollar those 2N million people earned from<br />
working harder, from working overtime, from getting a<br />
promotion, would be taxed more undor Mr Hawke.<br />
So much for tax cuts. 000---</p>
