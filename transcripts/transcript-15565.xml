Iranian / British crisis; Solomon Islands</p>
<p>E&amp;OE...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I want to welcome on behalf of Australia the resolution of the hostage crisis involving the Iranian government and the 15 British sailors.  It's good for the sake of the sailors and the families that this matter has been resolved.  It was of course indefensible action in the first place but we are all very happy that it has been resolved and it reflects credit on the sensible balanced approach that was taken by the British government and in particular its Prime Minister, Tony Blair.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, is this a victory for Iran of a victory for Britain?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it's a victory for the families of the sailors and it's a very good thing that they have, they're going to be released and it's a very good thing that they're going back to their homes and back to their families.  I don't think at this stage we want to start talking about victory and defeat.  We were keen to see it resolved, I think all sensible people recognise what a difficulty it was going to be for people and in those circumstances I'm very pleased it's been resolved.  </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Our personnel over in that area, are they in any danger or heightened danger because of what's happened?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Anybody in a theatre of war is in danger.  Don't anybody imagine that what is occurring in that part of the world or in Afghanistan is anything but dangerous and people should always have in their minds the danger to which our forces are exposed. I don't know that this incident heightens that danger, but the danger is there nonetheless and we should not lose sight of that fact.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So the same thing could potentially happen to our personnel? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm not going to speculate about specific possibilities except to make the obvious point that it's a dangerous part of the world and it requires the skill and courage that the members of the ADF always bring to their task.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>In East Timor at the moment there's been an escalation of violence before elections.  Are you concerned about that and are there any contingencies in place for Australia to help a bit more?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we have a very large force there and I am sure that the local commander will make the decisions according to the local circumstances from day to day; it's not for me to give running advice to him.  We invest him with a lot of authority, he's got a very strong force and he will take whatever action is needed.  We expected some increase in activity and some increase in disorder in the lead up to the election.  We've kept close to 900 troops in East Timor, that's a very significant force and the brigadier in charge will take the right decision.  But I will leave that for him very confident that he will handle the situation very well.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And what further assistance can we offer the Solomons given the death toll keeps rising there and the fear of disease?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I had a discussion with the Prime Minister two days ago and AusAID are in regular discussion with the Solomon Islands government.  We already have a lot of assistance and we provided an additional $2 million and if there is more assistance that's needed then we'll provide it.  But we have already given a lot and that should not be forgotten.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>If it's as good as you've told us it is today, why do you feel the need to encourage the business community to promote it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I always think it's desirable in a debate about public policy that those people who believe in good policy come out and support good policy. I don't take anything for granted in the political world and the next election is going to be very tough for the Coalition and there is a lot at stake. And the point I made yesterday, and I will repeat it today, that is if we roll back the WorkChoices reforms, it will be the first time in a generation that this country has turned backwards on economic reform. And I think that would be a thoroughly bad thing, and I think everybody who believes in the value of WorkChoices should be willing to fight for the preservation of WorkChoices. And that is the spirit in which I have made my comment, and I don't in any way retreat from those remarks. Thank you.</p>
