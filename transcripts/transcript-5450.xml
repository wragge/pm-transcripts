All' thiis happened during a time of reasonable seasonal<br />
conditionsl, because an. irresponsible Govertmaerit had caused<br />
raging inflation and then dumped the farmer when the prices of<br />
his products were turning down on world. markets. The Australian<br />
Labor Party, with its hostility-towud9 rural. Alstnalia, u-Sed<br />

Over the last five years that position ntas. been transformed.<br />
The Government gave immediate priority in 1976 to new rural<br />
policies. These policies-wexe aimed at assisting adjustment,<br />
facilitating market access, increasing the availability of<br />
long%-term credit, -reducing _ the l ev l__ Luncer Lai nty, a-ad<br />
increas~ ing substanrtially the profitability of Australian farms.<br />
These policies have been successful.<br />
The. Covernment established a Priiiary Industry Bank which has<br />
* made loans.. to 3,500 farmers totalling more than $ 250 million.-<br />
Rural. adjustment schemes were expanded in co-operation with<br />
the States. -Last. year, becauee of sevexe drought, taxation<br />
clonces3sions were in'troduced to ancour-age primary producers to<br />

Tax averaging works to assist farmers in contrast to the-old<br />
schemei which penal ised -farmers and pastoxalists when'-Incomes<br />
were falling. -Income equalisation deposits, which no . w caxry an.<br />

A drive was launched to regain the markets which Labor losqt.<br />
Successful negotiations have talKen place with Japan and with<br />
the United Statits, and some conceasions have even been won in<br />
theclosed markets in Europe.-<br />
Above all, keeping inflation down below that of m~ ajor competitors<br />
and trading countxie-s overeas, restores the competitive position<br />
of Australian primary produicers, enabling farmerg to take full<br />
advantage of reasonable Beasons which have lifted rural exports<br />
to record levels.<br />
The gross value of rural productJ. Q. fo~ r th~ -average of the three<br />
years ended 1980-81 is expected to be over 100 p'er cent-hiigher<br />
than the average for the three years ended. in 1974-7S. </p>

Rural exports have ibcreased substantially over the past<br />
threey-vTd -tii-from $ 4.3 billion in. 1975-76 to $ 8A6 billion.<br />
in 1979-80.<br />

In. 1979 also, the rural workforce increased by almost 16,000<br />
the first increase in more than 30 yearn. Once : more pro~ ducers.<br />
are investing in the future,.<br />
The Cqjja nof.... Uia Wheat'Board recently said that if the current..'<br />
rate of development in the Australian wheat industr-y continuea,<br />
a doubling of Australia's wheat-cxop during-the next decade<br />
is a likely prospect, and world de: ai ' sthere for it to be"<br />
sold profitably.<br />
There is , big investment taking place in cotton in NSW and**<br />
Queensland, as well as coarse grains in tropical Western Australii&amp;.<br />
The Northern Terri tory Government is looking at -the possibility<br />
of eat-ab-11_ zinqgrT&amp;-ie agricultural industry, in ' co-Operation<br />
with the Commonwealth. The Contnonwealth and Queenslana<br />
Governments have decided to fund the massive Burclekink Dam in<br />
northern Queensland.<br />
These are exciting developments. Yet they could be dashed by<br />
wrong and hostfle policies, as they were dashed once before.<br />
A resure oL.-. nflation, a knuckling under to slhort-sigbted<br />
trade-Thi7n demands against the export of sheep, new taxIes<br />
on capital gains and'ont resources, the inevitable ire-imposition<br />
of death duties, fuel policies which threaten the Security'of<br />
oil supplies to Australia, could once more plunge Austraa-i<br />
back into depression and destroy the work of the last five years.<br />
I am confident that Australians will keep to the path of<br />
comnmonsense, growth., responsibility and prosperity for Australia's<br />
