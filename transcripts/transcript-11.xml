RECONSTRUCTION.<br />
TRADE AND EMPLOYMENT-AGREEMENT.<br />
In Parlilament.-On llth November, 1947, the Minister for Post-war<br />
Reconstruction ( Mr. Dedman) said-<br />
The recent Geneva negotiations are the latest phase of the programme<br />
of international economic collaboration first foreshadowed in<br />
the Atlantic Charter, and subsequently developed in Lend-lease, the<br />
Mutual Aid Agreement, Unrra, the Food and Agricultural Organization,<br />
the two Bretton Woods institutions and the economic machinery of the<br />
I 1 </p>
<p>United Nations. They originated in an invitation issued by the United<br />
States Government in 1945 to fourteen other important trading countries<br />
to participate in two simultaneous sets of preliminary negotiations.<br />
One of these was designed to draw up a draft charter, incorporating<br />
rules to govern the future conduct of international trade, for submission<br />
to a world conference on trade and employment with a view to establishing<br />
an International Trade Organization. The other negotiations<br />
were to give practical effect to the policy of expanding international<br />
trade by bringing about a series of mutually advantageous trade agreements.<br />
After the establishment of the United Nations organization, the<br />
proposed charter negotiations were brought under United Nations<br />
auspices by the acceptance of a resolution proposed by the United<br />
States at the first meeting of the Economic and Social Council in<br />
February, 1946. The council established a preparatory committee to<br />
elaborate an annotated draft agenda for the consideration of a world<br />
conference on trade and employment. Throughout the planning of the<br />
United Nations economic machinery, it had been assumed that a<br />
specialized agency would eventually be established to deal with international<br />
trade-the most immediately important of all international<br />
economic problems. The Economic and Social Council added three more<br />
countries to those originally invited. They are-<br />
United Kingdom, United States of America, the Union of Socialist Soviet<br />
Republics, France. Belgium-Luxembourg. Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, Norway,<br />
Lebanon. Canada. India. South Africa. New Zealand. Australia. China. Cuba,<br />
Brazil and Chile.<br />
The Union of Socialist Soviet Republics has not yet participated.<br />
The first section of the Preparatory Committee thus set up was held<br />
at London in October and November, 1946, and was preceded by an<br />
exchange of views between British Commonwealth countries. This first<br />
session had before it a set of draft proposals for an International Trade<br />
Organization published by the United States Government in 1945, and<br />
supported by the British Government, which had publicly expressed its<br />
agreement on all important points. It had also to consider a more<br />
elaborate draft charter subsequently published by the United States<br />
Government on its own initiative. As a matter of convenience, and<br />
largely because it was more detailed, the Preparatory Committee decided<br />
to adopt the latter draft, together with less comprehensive proposals put<br />
forward by other delegations as the ' basis for discussion.<br />
The United States draft proposals were very substantially modified<br />
in the course of discussion, and new sections were added, but time prevented<br />
more than a hasty exchange of views on some significant questions.<br />
The rough text of a possible trade charter was drawn up and<br />
included in the first report of the Preparatory Committee to the<br />
Economic and Social Council. A drafting committee was appointed to<br />
examine this text in detail, and to recommend drafting changes. The<br />
drafting committee met at New York in February and March, 1947,<br />
and the resulting text became the basis for the second and final session<br />
of the Preparatory Committee at Geneva which recently concluded. I </p>
<p>propose to deal later with questions of the draft charter for the International<br />
Trade Organization, which will be the subject-matter of the<br />
coming World Trade and Employment Conference at Havana.<br />
Meanwhile, both for convenience and because the governments of<br />
a number of countries felt strongly that the two sets of negotiations<br />
were essentially interdependent, the first session of the Preparatory<br />
Committee recommended to the Economic and Social Council that the<br />
tariff negotiations for which the United States Government had issued<br />
invitations should also be brought under United Nations auspices. As a<br />
result, tariff negotiations began at Geneva on 10th August, 1947, about<br />
a month before the resumption of the charter discussions. Both tariff<br />
and charter negotiations were preceded by British Commonwealth discussions.<br />
The pre-tariff talks at London in March, 1947, dealt largely<br />
with the likely repercussions of the tariff negotiations on imperial<br />
preference, ' but those on the charter at Geneva covered the issues in<br />
rather more general terms.<br />
The tariff negotiations have been quite distinct from the charter<br />
discussions, and the aim has been to bring the results into effect without<br />
necessarily waiting for the establishment of the International Trade<br />
Organization. The results have been incorporated in a Draft General<br />
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for the consideration of governments,<br />
which will be published on 18th November, 1947, and which the Government<br />
ha. s decided to apply provisionally from that date. Until it is<br />
published it is impossible to deal with the negotiations except in general<br />
terms. The governments of all countries, members of the Preparatory<br />
Committee, are invited to become parties to the agreement. This<br />
generalization will extend the scope of the benefits to be received, and<br />
as a result Australia will obtain the benefit of the reductions negotiated<br />
among the other sixteen countries in addition to those negotiated by<br />
itself. Some of the former reductions are of little benefit, : but others<br />
will provide worthwhile benefits. In some countries these indirect benefits<br />
are considerable, and, taken on the aggregate, they represent a<br />
general extension of export opportunities for Australia. The agreement<br />
is in three parts. Part I. contains-<br />
The schedules of tariff reduction whici have beer, negotiated by all the<br />
countries concerned.<br />
An undertaking to extend imost-faiured-inatior treatment to other parties<br />
except for existing preferences which are formally recognized as valid to the<br />
extent that they have not been altered in the current negotiations.<br />
Part II. contains undertakings regarding commercial policy. These<br />
are necessary primarily to prevent tariff concessions granted being offset<br />
by other protective measures and follow closely chapter IV. of the<br />
draft charter. In practice they involve no significant change in Australian<br />
commercial policy. In particular they preserve-<br />
The right to impose new duties or protective purposes except where we<br />
specifically have accepted. or niny accept. as binding in tariff negotiations.<br />
The right to impose import restrictions to protet our balance rf payments. </p>

The right to take eCICIrgIelcy acti] ol if illy industry is enltdangered by any t: lriti<br />
or ir'tferelcll redtuctil nelgotiated.<br />
Part 111. contains mainly machinery provisions.<br />
If finally ratified, the agreement will run for three years but will<br />
continue thereafter unless it is specifically terminated. Special provisions<br />
protect our right to withdraw particular items which, in changed<br />
circumstances, we may wish to protect further without terminating the<br />
whole agreement.<br />
If changes are made in the draft charter at the Havana Conference,<br />
it is proposed that relevant parts of the agreement would be amended<br />
accordingly unless the parties to the agreement decide otherwise, and<br />
consequently countries applying the agreement provisionally are<br />
expected to carry out Part II. only to the extent permitted by existing<br />
legislation. The negotiations have been conducted against an economic backgroundi<br />
dominated by the slow recovery of war-devastated countries, and<br />
by the world-wide shortage of dollars. United States' exports in 1945<br />
aind 1946 totalled 26,000,000,000 dollars, compared with imports of<br />
9.000,000,000 dollars. For 1947 the figures up to 31st July were<br />
8.700,000,000 dollars and 3,300,000,000 dollars. There can be no world<br />
economic stability until the United States spends abroad on direct purchases<br />
of imports a greater proportion of her international income.<br />
The results of the negotiations as a whole must, therefore, be judged<br />
primarily hy their effect on the trade relationship between the United<br />
States and tle rest of the world. While it is easy to exaggerate the effect<br />
of tariff reduction, it is clear that a serious endeavour has been made t<br />
open the United States' market to imports. The effect of this should be<br />
apparent as soon as producion in countries other than the United Stat: e<br />
reaches levels capable of taking advantage of the changes.<br />
On the other hand, the agreement permits the maintenance of<br />
quantitative restrictions for balance of payments reasons and until<br />
dollars. ire available also permits discrimination against United State.-<br />
goods. So long ns the present international payments difficulties being<br />
experienced by practically all countries except United States persi: t.<br />
the United States cannot expect to benefit fully from concession. s<br />
granted to it. The agreement as a whole, therefore, should be a significant<br />
contribution to a restoration of a more reasonable balance between<br />
dollar and non-dollar payments.<br />
Britain hopes to improve its direct dollar earning. by increased<br />
exports to United States and indirectly by concessions granted by tbhe<br />
United Sta'es to other countries. Similarly, any stimulus to European<br />
recovery is of value to Britain. Any strengthening of Britain's position<br />
is. of course, of great value to Australia since it increases Britain's<br />
international purchasing power, on which we are very dependent. </p>
<p>I summarize briefly the direct and indirect benefits which may be<br />
expected to accrue as a result of the proposals arising from the Geneva<br />
negotiations if they are confirmed by the respective governments concerned.<br />
The tariff concessions affecting Australian exports take the<br />
form of actual reductions in existing rates of duty, or, where duty-frep<br />
entry or low duties already operate, the binding of such duty-free entry<br />
or low rates. In many items such binding is of material value because<br />
of ; he insurance it gives against increases in tariff rates which now<br />
tand at low levels. Tariff concessions have been offered to Australia on<br />
almost all the principal products which Australia exports or can expect<br />
to export, to the individual countries concerned. Generally, the offers<br />
have been made directly to Australia, but in some cases the benefits wiil<br />
arise indirectly from offers made to a third country which is a more<br />
important supplier of the particular product. The concessions should<br />
lie of real importance in relation to the future development of primary<br />
production in Australia. Further, they include items of importance to<br />
Australian secondary industry.<br />
Trade opportunities may also be expected to arise in respect of a<br />
number of products of export interest to Australia on which tariff con<br />
ccssions have been offered to other countries. Indirect benefits will al-o<br />
affect a wide range of manufactured products in which there is oppor<br />
tunity for expansion of Australian production and exports. The reductions<br />
of duties obtained in the course of the present negotiations are<br />
important, not only in themselves, but also by reason of the fact that<br />
they ensure a relatively advantageous starting point for futurein egotiations.<br />
This is specially important in the case of the United States.<br />
where a 50 per cent. reduction in duties is the imaximumn cut perminssible<br />
in any one agreement under the United States Reciprocal Trad-<br />
.\ greements Act. It is only by such negotiation. that high d; itie can<br />
hle progressively reduced to reasonably low level.<br />
To secure the above-mentioned benefits, Australia ha. s been obliged<br />
to offer some concessions. These have taken the form of concurrence<br />
in the reduction of certain preferences at present enjoyed in Empire<br />
countries and of ecneessiun in the Australian tariff. Both were<br />
unavoidable. We cannot expect to obtain the advantage of such negotiations<br />
without making some concessions ourselves. In assessing the outcome,<br />
it is essential to have regard to the likely effect on the Australian<br />
economy. We have not concurred in any proposed reductions in preferential<br />
margins except where such concessions are considered to be<br />
within the capacity of the Australian industries affected and where<br />
-alti4factory compensation concessions have been offered in return. The<br />
other concession which Australia was required to make in return for tin<br />
benefits offered were in the protective tariff. Most of the concessions<br />
proposed are individually small but they cover a very wide field. The<br />
Government has every confidence in the ability of Australian industry<br />
to withstand the concessions. Prices levels in Australia have risen </p>
<p>much less than in most overseas countries. This has resulted in Au. iiralian<br />
industries enjoying greater competitive advantages and an<br />
ability to compete within the shelter of a lower tariff wall than that<br />
provided by the present Customs Tariff.<br />
If the draft general agreement is eventually adopted by Australia it<br />
is not likely to result in any substantial increase in imports into<br />
Australia in competition with Australian production, and, where such<br />
increase does occur, it is likely to be absorbed by greater demand and<br />
consequently not affect Australian industry. The lower duties on goods<br />
which are imported will tend to reduce prices, and this, together with<br />
any increased supplies of goods, will be a useful offset to inflationary<br />
tendencies in the economy. The narrowing of the margins of preference<br />
at present enjoyed by Britain, Canada and New Zealand on a number of<br />
items may affect to some extent the advantage which these countries<br />
had had in the Australian market, but in no case has a contractual<br />
margin of preference been reduced except with the consent of the country<br />
enjoying preference rights under the Australian Customs Tariff.<br />
It is to the outcome of our negotiations with the United States<br />
that the Government attaches paramount importance. This market,<br />
whatever its vicissitudes, is by far the world's greatest. It matches an<br />
industrial output which is at least equal to that of the rest of the entire<br />
world. Even since the outbreak of World War II. the population of the<br />
United States has increased by almost double the total population of<br />
Australia. At the same time rising living standards and soaring<br />
incomes have greatly increased average purchasing power per head.<br />
It is a country where agricultural costs, despite increasing efficiency,<br />
steadily outpace those of other countries. At the prices at which we<br />
could afford to supply, the American public would buy a , very much<br />
larger quantity of foodstuffs. But in recent years exorbitant tariffs<br />
have barred the way to meeting this demand.<br />
" A significant section of Australian industry is geared to dollar<br />
imports, without which, as we are finding now, our industrial capacity<br />
is handicapped. Further development in the future will require much<br />
greater supplies of dollars for the purchase of equipment and essential<br />
supplies. Not only Australia, but also the whole sterling area is starved<br />
for dollars. The only way to increase the supply permanently is to<br />
increase exports to the United States. Any increase in our earnings<br />
would benefit not only us but also nearly all our best customers. It<br />
would help to redress the world balance against the dollar. The<br />
cardinal point of our policy throughout the negotiations has been to<br />
break down this great barrier to the further expansion of Australia's<br />
greatest primary industries. Throughout the inter-war period market<br />
factors, not technical, inhibited their growth. Wool, beef, butter and<br />
lamb were all held back by the closure of the American market not<br />
only to our produce but also to that of our competitors. When one<br />
looks beyond the immediate dislocation and exceptional circumstances<br />
of to-day, to the market prospects of coming years, two factors stand<br />
out-shrinking markets in western Europe, including Britain, </p>
<p>and a growing one in the United States. The population of western<br />
Europe is likely to start declining within a few years accompanied<br />
probably by stationary if not falling income per capita. To make<br />
matters worse, Britain, our main market for foodstuffs, is embarking<br />
on policies of increasing self-sufficiency. This will in turn increase<br />
its production costs and weaken its competitive power still further, thus<br />
lessening its international purchasing power upon which we have<br />
depended so heavily in the past. Dislocation in Asia, too, is likely to<br />
reduce the flow and increase the price of many of the foodstuffs and<br />
raw materials needed to sustain the industry and purchasing power of<br />
western Europe.<br />
Very different trends are manifest in America. So convinced has<br />
the Government been of the necessity to break down the barriers to all<br />
exports to the United States, not only of foodstuffs, that for a while,<br />
as became well known, we risked a breakdown of the whole of the<br />
Geneva negotiations in the period immediately preceding the veto by<br />
President Truman of the United States Congress bill to increase wool<br />
duties. In short, if the draft agreement is accepted by the governments<br />
concerned, it should make a significant contribution to a solution of the<br />
problems created by the world-wide shortage of dollars. It should<br />
materially assist Britain in its economic difficulties and thus help to<br />
maintain its international purchasing power, and above all it holds out<br />
the prospect of greatly increasing our earnings of foreign exchange by<br />
extending the range of our export opportunities, especially in the<br />
United States, thus paving the way for the further expansion and<br />
development of Australian primary and secondary industries.<br />
Although our negotiations with the United States of America<br />
overshadow the rest, the latter are in the aggregate of considerable<br />
significance. We conducted negotiations with seventeen different countries,<br />
including Britain, in relationship to which we are in a very<br />
special position. The outcome of these negotiations will become<br />
apparent when the general agreemen: on tariffs and trade is published<br />
on 18th November. If and uhen the general agreement is accepted by<br />
the requisite number of parties, an Interim Tariff Committee will be<br />
established on which each accepting country will be represented on a<br />
basis of equality. In due course, it is hoped that other countries will<br />
negotiate sufficient tariff reductions to satisfy existing members and<br />
thus qualify for membership of the Interim Tariff Committee. The<br />
treatment to be accorded to non-members is still unresolved, but it is<br />
likely to be as favorable as that extended to members at least until<br />
they have had sufficient time to negotiate appropriate reductions and<br />
have failed to do so. Eventually, if the International Trade Organization<br />
is set up and the most important trading countries become n embers<br />
of both the International Trade Organization and the Interim Tariff<br />
Committee, the latter will be dissolved and its functions and membership<br />
transferred to a tariff committee within the International Trade<br />
Organization. Thereafter the Tariff Committee will be the competent<br />
body for the conduct of all International Trade Organization activities<br />
in regard to tariffs. </p>

initerpiretationls inay close over the horizon. Provision has been niade<br />

d ecade ofits ( ltr v into force.<br />
The drcaft charter msq necessarily be assessedh to a coiisiderale<br />
degree in terms of its applicability to culrrent economic conditions. It<br />
was conceived originally, not as an interim instrument to meet the<br />
immiediate problems of : he post-war transition period, but as A qvt of<br />
guiding principles to governi thme conduct of international trade onl a<br />
multilateral basis once normality had been restored. It isq clear 1now<br />
that the scale of dislocation and the time necessary for recovery we<br />
gravely underestimated. Relief and( recon-struction rather than eompetitive<br />
intfernationaql trade are like to Ile -the magin object of international<br />
attention in thle economic field for some time to come.<br />
" The outstanding problems at pres ent revolve round -the deterioration<br />
in Britain's trading position, formerly the pivot of international<br />
trtide: the relapc~ of Fiurope after tile beginning of recovery, and( the </p>
<p>11<br />
cverance of ; he surplus food-producing capacity of the East from the<br />
more industrialized West; and devastation and dislocation in Asia.<br />
' ntil production and the supply of basic essentials in these areas can be<br />
restored, they will be vitally dependent on North America, the only<br />
area capable of dealing with the situation on the scale required, and<br />
will be quite incapable of producing the surplus a ove e-sential needs<br />
necessary to pay for the aid required. Thus, despite Unrra, the United<br />
States loan to Britain and the other direct and indirect aid already<br />
furnished by the United Statei on a huge scale, the shortage of dollars<br />
persists. The United States is now the dominating force in international<br />
trade, and while the demand for dollars so greatly exceeds tile supply,<br />
disequilibrium in the payments position of other countries is likely io<br />
continue. A reasonable measure of equilibrium in the balance ot<br />
', aymnents of the main trading nations without widespread resort to<br />
restriction however, a basic condition for the full application of the<br />
ultimate International Trade Organization scheme.<br />
Despite many obstacles, the projected organization could assist<br />
rehabilitation considerably. In the first place, it would provide a<br />
forum for the consideration of common problems in a conciliatory<br />
spirit by acquainting the governments and their official advisers with<br />
the problems of others which in sum are likely to add up to those of<br />
rie trading world. The value of this understanding, often so grievously<br />
lacking in the past, should not be under-rated. The will and practise<br />
of co-operation between members in solving trading problems would,<br />
in any case, be much more important than the governing rules, many<br />
of lwhich are difficult to define in ways applicable to ail likely circumranees.<br />
. Actually, the exceptions written into the charter are sufficient<br />
to cover any measures likely to be necessary, even in the immediate<br />
future. There is nothing to prevent the projected International Trade<br />
Organization making a substantial and effective contribution to current<br />
world problems from the moment it is established.<br />
" Secondly, the main principles of the International Trade<br />
Organization charter, even if impossible of rigid applications now, are<br />
a beacon for the future. They uphold multilateral trade as a desirable<br />
goal, as soon as conditions permit. This aiming point should incline<br />
members towards an integral system, away from the exclusive trading<br />
blocs which have proved so politically and economically expensive in<br />
the past.<br />
" Thirdly, in conjunction with the tariff reduction programme, it<br />
would help to restore the balance of the re. st of the world with the dollar<br />
area, by weakening restrictions on imports into the United States,<br />
while permitting other countries to ration available dollars in accordance<br />
with their needs, until they can earn enough to dispense with such<br />
in pediments to expansion. A careful scrutiny of the charter will<br />
reveal that the only really important trading country which will be<br />
subject to all the restraints which it imposes on the conduct of commercial<br />
policy for a long time to come is the United States. That<br />
rountry will he extending negotiated tariff reductions to others which I </p>
<p>have been granted in exchange for concessions by other countries which<br />
they, in many cases, will be unable to reciprocate. Balance of payments<br />
restrictions, imposed within the provisions of the charter, will<br />
prevent their extending many concessions made to the United States,<br />
virtually until the present widespread dollar difficulties have been<br />
overcome. Nearly all other members of the International Trade<br />
Organization would be able to apply measures forbidden to the United<br />
States because of its uniquely favorable position. Apart from temporary<br />
difficulties, the more permanent escape clauses, especially those<br />
designed in Chapter III. to facilitate industrial development in less<br />
advanced areas, are not ones that are likely to be open to the United<br />
States. Likewise, the measures envisaged by the charter in the event<br />
of a failure to maintain employment, or in cases when one country's<br />
payments position is causing widespread difficulties to others, all relate<br />
primarily to the United States. The fact that such a charter should<br />
be agreed upon by representatives of the United States reveals a<br />
realistic understanding of the problems of the rest of the world which<br />
is not only a far-sighted and enlightened gesture in this context, but<br />
also a most hopeful augury for the future of the projected organization.<br />
It is too soon to judge the likely effect of the charter on Australian<br />
interests. The final draft has yet to emerge from the Havana<br />
conference, and even then to be subsequently approved by the governments<br />
concerned. It will have to be examined eventually in conjunction<br />
with the overall programme which embraces the general<br />
agreement on tariffs and trade. Even at this stage, though the<br />
Government is in no way committed, it tay be appropriate to refer<br />
to a number of factors likely to be relevant later when deciding whether<br />
or not to join the International Trade Organization. I deal with a<br />
few questions of particular concern to Australia. First, there is the<br />
future of Imperial preference, which is, for us, a question of hard<br />
economic reality. The effect of article 16 of the draft charter is to<br />
ø preserve intact the existing British preferential system. There is no<br />
obligation anywhere in the draft charter to reduce or eliminate any<br />
margin of preference except by agreement of all the parties concerned.<br />
It is clearly envisaged that any such action will be taken only in return<br />
for equivalent tariff concessions by other countries as part of a mutually<br />
advantageous bargaining process. At the same time, no new preference<br />
may be created. Actually, no other British country has extended<br />
any new preference of importance to Australia for many years, and,<br />
in any case, the British Government is formally committed against<br />
such a course, while it is well known that Canada concurs in this<br />
attitude. British countries, and others already operating preference<br />
systems, may thus continue to enjoy differential trading advantage.
in each other's markets, and even barter them for tariff concessions,<br />
while only in very exceptional circumstances can other countries start<br />
new systems between themselves. The creation of mutual preferences<br />
by other countries which would discriminate against British trade, and<br />
thus arouse our resentment, just as the discrimination applied by us </p>
<p>arouses theirs, would be quite a likely development in the near future<br />
unless the draft charter comes into operation and prevents it. The<br />
attitude of the representatives of certain other countries at Geneva<br />
clearly revealed this possibility.<br />
In connexion with preference, the Government has borne constantly<br />
in mind the future of settlement in the northern parts of the continent,<br />
particularly Queensland which is dependent on the sugar industry.<br />
It will be noted that sugar is subject to an international agreement and<br />
consequently comes under the provisions of Chapter VI. Commodities;<br />
those of Chapter IV., Commercial Policy, do not apply. The important<br />
embargo and other devices used to protect sugar are not called into<br />
question by the draft charter. It is recognized generally that different<br />
considerations must be applied to the marketing of manufactured and<br />
primary products because of the essential differences in the economic<br />
factors which govern them.<br />
Another important instrument of Australian economic policy are<br />
the stabilization schemes for the marketing of primary products. In<br />
a number of cases, these depend on differential prices, prices between<br />
home and overseas sales and the periodic operation of subsidies in<br />
various forms. Without entering into a detailed explanation now, I<br />
point out that all our present schemes would be permitted under the<br />
terms of the draft charter.<br />
" From the more general point of view, the existence of some<br />
international body to determine the lines on which international trade<br />
shall be conducted seems to offer considerable advantages to Australia.<br />
Such a body would almost inevitably increase the influence of small<br />
and medium-sized countries, giving them a voice in decisions and<br />
enabling them to play an important part in affairs from which they<br />
would otherwise tend to be excluded. Without it, important decisions<br />
would be made by the giants in concert and small countries would be<br />
grouped around and dominated by them. The embryonic International<br />
Trade Organization charter already bears considerable imprint of<br />
Australian ideas. Our delegation has been enabled to play a constructive<br />
part at every stage of the deliberations.<br />
From the economic stand-point, Australia is highly dependent on<br />
international trade. Only through this medium can many of our<br />
industries be kept working and the living standards of our people<br />
improved. Order rather than cut-throat chaos suits our purposes and<br />
our resources. Our interests lie especially along the lines of flexible<br />
multi-lateral trade. We need new markets to pay for the imports<br />
which our development requires. Our old markets are located mainly<br />
in Britain and Europe, the relative world economic importance of<br />
which is declining. The population of western Europe will begin to<br />
decline sharply within a few years and this will limit its need for our<br />
foodstuffs. Our main avenues of development, partictularly for the<br />
export of manufactured goods, point in new directions. It would be </p>
<p>foolish to allow old habits of thought to hide ail signposts to the future.<br />
In such a changing world, it may be important for us to be able to meet<br />
our future customers regularly round the conference table to dis.; use<br />
our reciprocal needs and wishes.<br />
We have a particularly strong interest in the maintenance of a<br />
high and stable demand for our export products. The employment<br />
provisions of the charter are an important psychological factor as well<br />
as an ' escape' clause. They underline the source of demand for<br />
exports and emphasize the bad neighbourliness of allowing preventable<br />
unemployment. The commodity' provisions of the charter should<br />
also assist in removing some of the instability from which we have<br />
suffered in the past.<br />
One of the main planks of Australian policy is industriilizatioll<br />
and full development of our resources. While the original International<br />
Trade Organization proposals might have resulted in certain<br />
aspects of this policy being called into question, the latest draft stresses<br />
the importance of such policies in ultimately furtheri worhl<br />
prosperity, subject of course, to reasonable safeguards. ' Th iImu<br />
trial development of other countries, especially those of wonul<br />
enlarge Australia's potential export market. Another inpral. i t interest<br />
of Australia is that of being able to protect our ec( uonv maT frll'<br />
as possible against the impact of adverse worll conditionls \\ iht. it r ernational<br />
measures fail, without incurring odillum elsewhere ) or provoking<br />
retaliation. This is provided for by the charter. ThIe International<br />
Trade Organization would provide for a forum for expressing<br />
our views and explaining our position in sucl circuimsita ices.<br />
For better or worse International Trade Organization is likely to , e<br />
the only attempt to establish an international body in the trade sphelre<br />
in this generation. If it is set up Australian interests will be markedly<br />
influenced whether we go in or stay out. The Government is also<br />
mindful of the implications of the International Trade Organization<br />
programnme in the wide political sphere. The economic strife which<br />
was both a product of and contributor towards the political rivalries<br />
which eventually led to the recent war could easily revive unless positive<br />
steps are taken to direct efforts along more enlightened channels.<br />
The recent tariff negotiations at Geneva, though still to be adopted by<br />
governments, do represent an example of international co-operation<br />
in a sphere very susceptible to conflict. This is heartening in itself<br />
at a time when so many aspects of international relations are unsatisfactory<br />
and disturbing. Economic distress easily erupts into the major<br />
poltical upheavals which eventually threaten the peace. The growth of<br />
international co-operation on a functional basis to deal with the<br />
practical problems facing the world is something which the Government<br />
believes should be most actively encouraged. It will continue to<br />
persevere in its efforts to secure the kind of International Trade<br />
Organization charter which would be a significant contribution both<br />
to material welfare and world peace." </p>
<p>In Parliament.-The 19th November, 1947, the Minister -for<br />

WORLD ORGANIZATION-SOUTH PACIFIC COMMISSION,<br />
INTERIM ORGANIZATION.<br />
On 20th November, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said---<br />
At the South Seas conference at Canberra in February, 1947, six<br />
governments signed an agreement providing for the establishment of the<br />
South Pacific Commission. The agreement is to enter into force<br />
when it has been formally accepted by all governments. Acceptances<br />
have been effected by the Governments of New Zealand, Australia and<br />
Britain. Procedural diflicultiees have delayed the acceptances of the<br />
Governments of the United States, France and the Netherlands, but it<br />
i. s expected that These will be notified to the Australian Government<br />
within the nlear future.<br />
In the meantime, the Australian and New Zealand Governments<br />
have by agreement with the other four governments, established a South<br />
Pacific Commlission interim organization with head-quarters at . Sydney<br />
to make preliminary arrangements for the establishment of the commission.<br />
A meeting of representatives of all signatory governments will<br />
be held at Sydney in November, 1947. This meeting will examine the<br />
past and future work of the interim organization and, with a view to<br />
expediting discussions at the first formal meeting of the commission,<br />
which it is hoped will take place early in 1948, will discuss plans for the<br />
structure of the secretariat of the coilnnisicn and related matters."<br />

<p>THE GOVERNMENT.<br />
POLICY-NATIONALIZATION.<br />
In Parliament.-On 12th November, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr.<br />
Chifley) said-<br />
" Representations have been received from various trades unions<br />
regarding the nationalization of coal mines and the iron and steel<br />
industry, and in reply I have pointed out that the Commonwealth Parliament<br />
has no power under the Constitution to nationalize those industries,<br />
even if the Government wished to do so. Therefore, it is sheer<br />
nonsense to talk of the Government's plans for nationalizing suhi<br />
industries." MINISTERS OF STATE-BILL INTRODUCED.<br />
In Partiament.-On 19th Novembei, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr.<br />
Chifley) introduced the Ministers of State Bill. Mr. Chifley said-<br />
The purpose of this bill is to increase the salaries of Ministers of<br />
State. The Constitution made a temporary provision of œ 12,000 per<br />
annum for a maximum of seven Ministers, and left the way open for<br />
Parliament to make increased provision, both as regards the number of<br />
Ministers and the appropriation. On five occasions, increases have been<br />
made because of increased responsibility. The last occasion was<br />
in 1941, when the number of Ministers of State was increased from<br />
eleven to nineteen and the appropriation to œ 21,250. That change was<br />
made at the instance of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Menzies),<br />
who was then Prime Minister.<br />
Whereas the provision made in the Constitution 47 years ago was<br />
an average of approximately œ 1,710 per minister, under subsequent<br />
provision from time to time, the average has not only not increased in<br />
keeping with rising costs but has actually been less than under the<br />
original provision. In 1941 the average was œ 1,120, and there has<br />
-been no increase in the meantime. The whole of the appropriation for<br />
Ministers of State is not divided among the Ministers. A proportion is<br />
paid to the Cabinet fund, to meet the expenses of Cabinet, and these<br />
expenses have naturally increased. The ihcreasing responsibilities of<br />
Ministers, the many additional calls on their financial resources, and the<br />
rising costs, justify, in the opinion of the Government, some addition to<br />
the salaries provision. The present measure proposes to increase the<br />
appropriation from œ 21,250 to œ 27,650." [ The bill was passed.<br />

FIGHTING FORCES.<br />
AWARDS-U. S. DECORATIONS.<br />
In Parliament.-On 12th November, 1947, the Minister for Defenc-.<br />
( Mr. Dedman) said-<br />
I inform the House of decisions on proposals communicated by tht<br />
United States Government for the award of United States decorations<br />
to members of the Australian Defence Forces. The Government </p>
<p>received 229 proposals for the bestowal of United States awards which<br />
required extensive examination and correspondence with the service<br />
departments, and cablegrams to Britain, in the light of the rules<br />
governing the acceptance of foreign honours. The Australian Government<br />
has applied to the Australian forces the rules adopted by the<br />
British Government and communicated to the Australian and other<br />
British Commonwealth governments in 1942. One of the rules was that<br />
the scale of acceptance of United States awards by inenmbers of the<br />
Aius: ralian forces should, in general, be one acceptance for each British<br />
award granted to United States forces in the South-West Pacific Area.<br />
The Government represented to the British authorities that it would<br />
be loath to contemplate the wholesale rejection of awards sponsored by<br />
America for operational service for no other reason lthan that they<br />
would involve a departure from a numerical . balance. Further, by<br />
virtue of the close association of United States and Australian forces<br />
throughout the war in the South-West Pacific Area, the Government<br />
believed that it was fitting that acceptance of awards for operational<br />
service should be permitted on a generous scale for the final series of<br />
recommendations to mark the end of hostilities. The British authorities<br />
have agreed with this view, and consideration of the proposals has<br />
proceeded without regard to any of the limitations which would have<br />
been imposed if the one for one rule had applied.<br />
" The Government has accepted 102 United States award. for<br />
gallantry or heroism, or for outstanding service directly in, or associated<br />
with, operations in an operational area. They include awards for<br />
Allied Intelligence Bureau parties which landed in enemy territory,<br />
for intelligence patrols, heroism and good service in action, coast<br />
watching in enemy territory, operational flights and strikes against<br />
the enemy, the rescue of survivors of crashed aircraft in enemy territory,<br />
and many other instances of gallantry and outstanding service in<br />
operations. The Government has expressed its appreciation of the offer<br />
of the United States Government and its pleasure in accepting them.<br />
The Government regrets that it is unable to accept United States awards<br />
in the following cases, and for the reasons stated:-<br />
United States awardf, fir inon-optratiotal service, acceptance of which is<br />
precluded by the policy of the ( Govemriiient, 21. ( These awards include<br />
proposals f'or the rrecoPiition of service in Australia. with general headquarters,<br />
and for ervicee in Washiiingtoni, all of which is non-operational.)<br />
United States a wrds for pIer sonnl vwho have already received a British<br />
award for the samile service. a'cept; nce of which nwould infringe the rule against<br />
duplication of recoinition. 35. ( The ptrinciple of this rule is that service<br />
rendcered during oiperations by a nilemtler of any British Commonwealth force<br />
is more properly recognized by an awird by his own Sovereign than by acceptance<br />
of foreign ioni( our. In noe of the-e euses have tlie services recommended that<br />
: nl exception be made to the application of the rule against duplication of<br />
iw ards.) United States awards for personnel in the following categories, acceptance of<br />
which is recluded by tile rules ioverning the acceptance of foreign honours:-<br />
Awards for services for which United Staltes decorations were previously<br />
. ranted, five: Iposthumou s awards which, in the case of British awards, are<br />
permitted only for the Victoria Cross and George Cros,. and mentions il<br />
despatches and commenl dations,. six. </p>
<p>The total number of award. s which, for the reasons already stated,<br />
cannot be accepted, is 67. In certain cases, the proposed United States<br />
awards have been deferred for further examination by the services as to<br />
whether or not the service for which they are proposed was operational.<br />
There are 60 cases in this category, mos; of them being for service with<br />
general head-quarters, the greater proportion of which was on the<br />
mainland of Australia." PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.<br />
POULTRY FARMING-EGG EXPORT CONTROL, BILL<br />
INTRODUCED.<br />
In, Parliament.-On 12th November, 1947, the Minister for Commerce<br />
( Mr. Pollard) introduced the Egg Export Control Bill. Mr.<br />
Pollard said-<br />
The purpose of this bill is to provide for the constitution of an<br />
Australian Egg Board to regulate and control the export of eggs and<br />
egg products from Australia. In July, 1943, responsibility for the<br />
stabilization of egg prices and control of the marketing of eggs was<br />
assumed by the Commonwealth Egg Control organization, constituted<br />
under National Security ( Egg Industry) Regulations, and continued<br />
in force under the Defence ( Transitional Provisions) Act 1946. When<br />
this control ceases on 31st December, 1947, responsibility for marketing<br />
of eggs will revert to State egg boards, which will be responsible for<br />
stabilizing prices and marketing the production of their own States.<br />
The Australian Government recently concluded a long-term contract<br />
with . the British Government for the purchase of Australian eggs<br />
in shell, egg pulp and egg powder for the seasons 1947-48, 1948-49<br />
and 1949-50. To assist in the orderly marketing of the anticipated<br />
surplus, and to ensure that the conditions of the long-term contract are<br />
fulfilled, the Government has decided to establish an Australian Egg<br />
Board, which will supervise the disposal of that portion of surplus<br />
production which is of suitable quality for export. The bill provides<br />
for the establishment of a board of ten members, who will represent the<br />
following interests:-Egg Producers of Australia ( one from each<br />
State), 6; persons with commercial experience, 2; employees engaged in<br />
the handling, grading and processing of eggs, 1; Australian Government<br />
representative, 1; total, 19." [ The bill was passed.<br />

INDUSTRIAL.<br />
DILUTION OF LABOUR-TRADESMEN'S RIGHTS, FURTHER<br />
BILL INTRODUCED.<br />
In Parliament.-On 12th November, 1947, the Minister for Labour<br />
( Mr. Holloway) introduced the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Bill.<br />
Mr. Holloway said-<br />
This bill extends the principal provisions of the Tradesmen's<br />
Rights Regulation Act 1946 to the trades in the boot, shoe, sandal and<br />
1s4pper manufacturing industry which were subject to National Security<br />
( Boot Trades Dilution) Regulations. </p>
<p>The bill adds to the act another part and schedule, and makes<br />
consequen'wial amendments, so that recognized tradesmen in the boot<br />
trades shall be entitled to the same priority in employment in their<br />
trades as recognized engineering tradesmen receive in the engineering<br />
trades. That is to say, in the case of engagements, an employer may<br />
not employ on tradesmen's work a person other than a recognized<br />
tradesman if a competent tradesman is available and offering for<br />
employment; and in the case of dismissals or retrenchments, Iby another<br />
provision in the same section that a recognized tradesman shall be<br />
the last to go unless a local comm: nittee otherwise permits and subject<br />
to an employer exercising his award rights regarding summary<br />
dismissal. " The bill provides for ex-servicemen to qualify as recognized<br />
tradesmen by a probationary period of training in employment under<br />
the supervision of a local ( boot trades) committee. These probationary<br />
tradesmen will receive the full tradesman's rate of pay during their<br />
probatonary period. Applications by ex-servicemen for authorization<br />
of their employment as probationary tradesmen must be made, unless<br />
there are special circumstances, within six -months after the date of<br />
discharge from the forces or the same period after the coming into<br />
operation of these amendments, whichever is the later.<br />
[ The bill was passed.<br />

IJNEMPLOYMENT-FIGURES.<br />
On 25th November, 1947, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Holloway)<br />
said-For many months there has been a steady increase in the demand<br />
for labour in Australia accompanied by a progressive decline in<br />
unemployment. At October, 1947, recipients of unemployment benefit<br />
( including re-employment allowance) had fallen to a record low level<br />
of 2,945 ( 2,830 males and 115 females) representing less than one<br />
in 11,000 Australian workers. Unfilled vacancies held by the Commonwealth<br />
Employment Service numbered 52,200 for males and 35,200 for<br />
females, an increase of nearly 7,000 above the September total.<br />
It is difficult to find any occupation suitable for females in which<br />
unfilled vacancies do not greatly exceed available applicants. For<br />
example, in the clothing and textile trades the number of vacancies for<br />
women workers approaches 15,000.<br />
" During October, 1947, the Commonwealth Employment Service<br />
referred 20, S00 males and 6,500 females to employers."<br />

<p>INCOME TAX.<br />
SECOND BOARD OF REVIEW.<br />
On 12th November, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
An additional Board of Review has been established under the<br />
Income Tax Assessment Act.<br />
The functions of the Board of Review, although primarily associated<br />
with income tax, have, from time to time, been extended to<br />
include matters arising under sales tax, pay-roll tax, war-time ( company)<br />
tax, social services contribution, flour tax and entertainments<br />
tax, as well as estate and gift duties. The volume of cases referred for<br />
determination has been such that one board has been unable to cope<br />
with it within a reasonable time.<br />
The new board will comprise the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation<br />
( Mr. H. H. Trebilco), chairman, Mr. J. A. Nimmo, and Mr. R. A.<br />
Cotes. Appointment will be for seven years from 1st December, 1947.<br />
For the present, this board will deal with cases arising in Victoria,<br />
South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. The existing<br />
board will dletermine cases arising in New South Wales and<br />
Queensland. Both boards have been constituted Boards of Referees under the<br />
War-time ( Company) Tax Assessment Act."<br />

with them and greatly admire tie skilful craftsmanship and excellent taste<br />
with which they have heeni decorated. Both tie fruit dishes and the salvers<br />
will be in constant use ill our house, and will remind us of the love and gsodwill<br />
which the people of Australia have shown us on this most happy occasion.<br />
My husband has visited Australia of which lie lhas the pleasantest memories<br />
and I hope that it may not be long before I can visit the C'onuionwealth amn<br />

CONSTITUTION.<br />
AMENDMENT-REFERENDUM, PRICES, BILL<br />
INTRODUCED.<br />
In Parliament.-On 19th November, 1947, the Minister for Labour<br />
( Mr. Holloway) introduced the Constitution Alteration ( Rents and<br />
Prices) Bill. Mr. Holloway said-<br />
To safeguard the Australian people from inflation and depression,<br />
and to keep in check the profiteer and the racketeer, are nation-wide<br />
problems. They can be solved only by nation-wide action. The object<br />
of the bill is to amend the Constitution so as to give to the National<br />
Parliament the necessary powers. The bill proposes to give it the<br />
power to make laws with respect to ' rents and prices ( including<br />
charges) The powers will have to be exercised particularly throughout the<br />
present critical years or transition from war to peace. But the need<br />
for their exercise will not lapse when the transition is completed,<br />
however far ahead that may be. They will be needed again from time<br />
to time, whenever economic conditions become unstable. The object<br />
of the bill is to give permanent, nation-wide protection to every tenant,<br />
every income-earner, every housewife, to every user of services and,<br />
indeed, to every purchaser as well as to primary producers dependent<br />
on unsheltered markets.<br />
" The proposed new power is one to make laws first and foremost<br />
about rents. In an economic sense, rents are only a particular group<br />
of prices. But there must be no doubt whether they are included in<br />
the power. They are a vital element in the life of the people. In<br />
the first place, rent absorbs a large proportion of the income of most<br />
families. Unless rents are kept at a reasonable figure, other forms of<br />
price control will not be effective to maintain the living standards of<br />
the community. Moreover, the shortage of housing is likely to last<br />
longer than other shortages, and rent control will therefore be essential<br />
for a long time. </p>
<p>A vital duty of a national government is to give its people that<br />
freedom from fear and want held out to them in the Atlantic Charter<br />
as one of the aims which made the sacrifices of the war worth while.<br />
I will show that the power to control rents and prices is a power without<br />
which the Commonwealth Parliament will be severely handicapped<br />
in carrying out this duty in the economic sphere. The Australian<br />
Government is convinced that the people should be given the opportunity<br />
to arm themselves, through their Parliament, with essential<br />
power. In the past, the economic security of the common man has been<br />
menaced lv recurring economic depressions bringing in their train the<br />
miseries nf unemployment and want. Those depressions have usually<br />
been preceded by periods of unhealthy expansion, leading to inflation<br />
and the crash from ' booin' to slump'. The horrors of war have<br />
always been followed by tlhis cycle-scarcely less terrible in its effects.<br />
In modern times, these economic troubles have not been coinfined to<br />
single countries, but have been world-wide. They are the result of<br />
mnan's activities or neglect, and it is within his power to prevent them.<br />
lThe problem of recurring depressions must be tackled on a world-wide<br />
basis, and Australia is playing its full part in the work being done in<br />
rthis direction. But an important part of the problem must be tackled<br />
within iiir own economy. Moreover, we must be ready to act quickly<br />
whenmiever tlie necessity arise-. The vital thing is to see that ' boom'<br />
condirions, ( if 1an unhealthy kind, which, as experience shows, lead to<br />
depression, . shall not develop. Further apart from the prospect of<br />
depression. another evil that must be fought vigorously in boom<br />
times and in times when houses and goods are in short supply is the<br />
evil of exploitation by profiteers. When money is plentiful among<br />
some sections of the community and houses and goods are scarce, unscrupulous<br />
landlords or vendors can, if not controlled, exploit the rest<br />
of the contimmuity. Even in times when goods are plentiful, the<br />
creation of monopolies leads to the same evil. We all know the<br />
enormous profits made during and after World War I. Thanks to rent<br />
and price control, there was much less profiteering in Australia during<br />
World War II., but the sudden removal of these controls at present<br />
would undoubtedly lead to profiteering. We have only to see what is<br />
happening in other countries, such as the United States, to realize this.<br />
In the United States, prices rose so steeply within a few months of the<br />
removal of control, that an attempt is now being made to replace price<br />
control. But with the flood-gates once opened who can say whether<br />
they can he shut again?<br />
No intelligent person would be so foolish as to think that all<br />
fluctuations in rents and prices can be avoided. If costs, especially<br />
eosts of imported goods and materials. are rising, prices must rise.<br />
But the people rely on their government to ensure that the rises shall<br />
be jiustificd. that increases of wages intended to improve living stanlards<br />
shall do so and shall not be made the excuse for unreasonable<br />
price and rent increases. I will show later that an essential weapon in </p>
<p>the two battles against depression and exploitation is the power to control<br />
rents and prices. I will also show that the States are not in a<br />
position to handle those weapons effectively. The people will rightly<br />
look to the National Parliament to grapple with these national<br />
problems. The Government is confident that they will freely grant the<br />
powers necessary to enable it to do so.<br />
The bill does not mean that the Government considers that it will<br />
be necessary to operate price control indefinitely, or to operate it in<br />
the detailed and complete form to which we have become accustomed<br />
over recent years. Price control in that form is necessary only in a<br />
period of general excess of demand over supply, a condition which is<br />
now being steadily removed. As shortages disappear, so can price control<br />
disappear, until it will become essentially a reserve power, operating<br />
only when and where it is required for the health of the economy.<br />
Price control will be required beyond the transition period in relation,<br />
for instance, to houses and rents, where shortages must be expected to<br />
continue for some time. Where production of certain commodities is<br />
under the control of monopolies, price control may be necessary to ensure<br />
that the industry concerned shall apply a policy of high output, low<br />
prices and moderate profits, rather than a policy of low output, high<br />
prices and excessive profits. Similarly, where industries have been<br />
granted tariff protection to enable them to carry on against overeas<br />
competition, price control will be essential to ensure that this tariff<br />
protection shall not be used to exploit local consumers.<br />
Periods of expanding activity occure from time to time in any<br />
economy, as a result, for instance, of the development of new public and<br />
private investment. It will be possible for price control to check the<br />
increase of prices that would other wise result from this pressure of<br />
demand on resources of production. It is the effect on costs of this<br />
increase of prices which has in the past led businessmen suddenly to<br />
change their minds about undertaking new production, and which has<br />
led to financial crises followed by prolonged depression. If price control<br />
can prevent the development of this inflationary tendency, that<br />
alone will be the greatest single factor contributing to the avoidance<br />
of depression. In the other direction, continual difficulty has been<br />
caused in the Australian economy by the violent collapses of overseas<br />
prices for exports Price control cannot prevent these falls, but, when<br />
drops occur, price control can, by maintaining minimum local prices,<br />
help to cushion their effects of primary producers' incomes and on the<br />
Australian economy generally.<br />
i turn now to a consideration of the immediate need for rent and<br />
price control in Australia during the period of transition from war to<br />
peace. I need not draw in great detail the picture of what would happen<br />
if the present rent control were removed. Although good progress is<br />
being made with housing, there must inevitably be a shortage for a long<br />
time. But while any shortage remains there must be protection for<br />
home-seekers against extortionate charges for accommodation. After<br />
World War rents rose steadily, right up to the beginning of the </p>
<p>depression in 1929, by which time they were 50 per cent. higher than<br />
in 1918. Even in normal times the rack-renter is always with us. L<br />
am not saying that all landlords are grasping and unscrupulous-far<br />
from it. But there are always some-and their number tends to grow<br />
with opportunity-who are willing to take the last penny from people<br />
whenever there is either a general shortage or a local shortage such as<br />
occurs from time to time in particular places.<br />
" On prices generally, there can be no doubt that external and<br />
internal inflationary pressures will continue for some time. Prices of<br />
imported goods are now more than two and a half times their pre-wr<br />
level and are still rising. These cost inreases_ have been pressing<br />
throughout the war, and have, thanks to price control, been absorbed by<br />
the economy with a minimum of disturbance. Internal pressures are<br />
equally strong. Income of primary producers, enjoying record<br />
production and record prices, will be at an all-time high<br />
level this year. Prices for exported goods are more than two<br />
and a half times their pre-war level. There have been substantial<br />
increases of the basic wage and of skill margins this year. Wage costs<br />
will be still further increased by the adoption of the 40-hour working<br />
week throughout Australia, on 1st January, 1948. There is, in addition,<br />
a large volume of liquid balances accumulated by the people as a<br />
result of war-timue shortages, and still awaiting spending. Prices control<br />
has so far given owners of savings an assurance that the real value<br />
of these balances will : be maintained. A threat to the continuance of<br />
price stability, as a result of the cessation of price control, may cause a<br />
wave of buying a, a hedge against inflation and thus bring about the<br />
inflation that we fear. Against this high and increasing volume if<br />
spending power, there is a serious deficiency of goods. Despite our high<br />
export income, imports are held back by dollar shortages and the production<br />
difficulties of easier currency areas. like Britain, Europe and<br />
Asia. We may not be able to import even enough goods to balance our<br />
exports, let alone to import surplus goods to meet excess spending<br />
pressure. In the domestic sphere, production is at a high and<br />
increasing level, but is still seriously short of the people's needs. The<br />
postponement of capital replacement and expansion during the<br />
war requires an abnormally large proportion of current production to be<br />
devoted to the production of capital goods. In addition to this heavy<br />
and continuing drain on resources to meet capital requirement, shortages<br />
of labour and materials and the hangover of war-time disorganization<br />
of production are causing bottlenecks in several lines of essential<br />
production. An important feature of the Australian economy at present is the<br />
substantial subsidies being paid by the Government to prevent cost<br />
increases from passing into the price structure. An abrupt removal of<br />
these subsidies, as would be required by the cessation of price control,<br />
would cause an equally abrupt rise in prices. This represents an inflatinarvy<br />
force which must be controlled until it can safely be released.<br />
With all these inflationary forces at work in Australia, it cannot be </p>
<p>doubted that an immediate relaxation of price control would lead inevitably<br />
to price increases comparable with those that have occurred<br />
recently in the United States. There, within five month. s of the<br />
abandonment of price control, retail prices generally rose by 14 per<br />
cent. and food prices by 29 per cent. Those figures should : be compared<br />
with the increase of prices in Australia, where in the two years<br />
since the end of the war, the rise have been only 6 per cent. for prices<br />
generally, and 7 per cent. for food alone.<br />
The war-time history of price control gives us firm ground for<br />
confidence that it brings real advantages to the community and that it is<br />
po.'-ible to administer price control successfully. Rent control during<br />
the war was amazingly successful. Rents on an average increased by<br />
less than I per cent. During World War retail prices rose by 32 per<br />
cenlt. and two yea'rs later they were 70 per cent. above pre-war. During<br />
World War II., they rose by 23 per cent., and two years later they are<br />
only 30 per cent. above the pre-war level. World War II. lasted<br />
six year-as againl-t four yrcars and involved a far greater strain oil<br />
resource.-. rThpio'st -war | iriod has also been far more difficult, due : o<br />
the greater dislocation in Australia and overseas. Apart from our own<br />
arrears of civilian production, the war-torn countries of Europe and<br />
Asia have not been able to make anything like their normal contribution<br />
to our needs. Instead, they have been a drain on our supplies. In<br />
spite of far greater shortages and disorganization of production, price<br />
control has thus far saved Australia from the worst effect of a second<br />
post-war boom. If it is continued through the transition period, we<br />
may reasonably hope to avoid the worst effects of a slump such as<br />
occurred in 1921.<br />
Although, with the full concurrence of the State governments, the<br />
Commonwealth assumed full power to control rents and prices at the<br />
outbreak of the war. it has exercised these powers only to the extent<br />
rendered strictly necessary : by circumstances arising out of the war.<br />
During the first two and a half years of the war, for instance, only a<br />
relatively frew commodities were made subject to control, because general<br />
short:;: ze wcre not apparent until after the Pacific war broke oit.<br />
When it i. s realized that the post-war boom lasted two years after World<br />
War which was so much milder in its economic effect than World<br />
War it can be understood why no great measure of de-control has<br />
becn permitted up to the present stage, early in the third post-war year.<br />
Nevertheless. the Government looks forward to the time when it will 1x'<br />
able to lay down the burden of assessing most price increases, and t'i<br />
revert to the state of affairs before the Japanese war, when only a<br />
relatively small number of items was scarce and under control, and<br />
traders did their own pricing under a formula, subject only to<br />
occasional check.<br />
" Recently. the Commonwealth Government has returned to State<br />
and local governments control of goods and services handled by State,<br />
semi-governmental and local-governing bodies, including tronsport, gas </p>
<p>27<br />
and electricity undertakings, and locally produced and consumed goods<br />
and services, such as milk and taxi-cab fares. A considerable extension<br />
of this process will take place, in consultation with the States.<br />
The amendment of the Constitution proposed would give the Conmmonwealth<br />
Parliament power to legislate with respect to rents and<br />
prices, including charges. The power over rents would cover the<br />
fixing or pegging' of rents, would include power to provide for the<br />
determination of fair rents and, as an incidental matter, to protect<br />
tenants against eviction. It would apply to rents of goods as well arents<br />
of land and buildings. The power with respect to prices would<br />
enable Parliament to control and regulate the prices at which property<br />
uf any kind, including commodities, land and shares in companies, is<br />
sold. Explicit power to control charges is included in the bill to remove<br />
any doubt about charges which are in the nature of prices or rents, but<br />
in relation to which the term prices or rents' may not be ordinarily<br />
used; for example, charges for hairdressing or for board and lodging.<br />
The words would also include charges for the use of money, or, in other<br />
words, interest.<br />
" Since minimum prices, as well as maximum prices, could be fixed<br />
under the power, it could be used to ensure a home-consumption price<br />
for primary products. Minimum prices could also be used to prevent<br />
disorder and losses to holders of stocks of imported goods which could<br />
follow a sudden collapse of raw material prices overseas. Further,<br />
the new power would make clear the right of the Commonwealth to<br />
pay subsidies to maintain reasonable prices to consumers as well as<br />
producers for essential goods, such as potatoes and dairy products.<br />
" Control over rents and prices by the Commonwealth is at prese: t<br />
carried on by regulations in force under the Defence ( Transitional<br />
Provisions) Act. That act depends for its validity on the defence<br />
power' of the Commonwealth. The High Court has held that I he<br />
extension of the defence power to measures necessary to the economic<br />
stability of the country does not cease abruptly with the end of hostilities<br />
in a war. The power retains a wide scope during the period of<br />
transition from conditions of war to conditions of peace; -but the scope<br />
of the power is constantly dwindling, and it affords a very uncertain<br />
basis for measures essential to Australia's economic stability. With this<br />
consideration in view, the Government sought the assistance of the Stale<br />
governments, all of which expressed willingness to support the contiuunnce<br />
of price control on a national basis during the post-war transition<br />
period. In some States this legislation has expired and in others<br />
will shortly do so. Further, there is little prospect of this legislation<br />
hieng extended in all or even a majority of States. This creates the<br />
position that, in some States price control now virtually rests on the<br />
defence power, and will have ! egal validity only for as long as that<br />
power is held to support it. Even if there were any certainty that the<br />
defence power is adequate to cover the winding-up of war-time controls </p>
<p>and measures necessary during the period of transition to conditions of<br />
peace, the Commonwealth would still be without adequate power to deal<br />
with and guard against future economic disturbances. The permanent<br />
power to act effectively and promptly in economic crises is, in the<br />
opinion of the Government, an essential power of a national parliament<br />
quite apart from present circumstances. It is very likely that there<br />
will be long periods during which these powers will not be exercised, or<br />
will be exercised only in limited fields, but they will be a vital weapon in<br />
the nation's defences against inflationary booms, followed by economic<br />
depressions. It is these circumstances which have led the Government<br />
to recommend to Parliament that the people be asked, by way of referendum,<br />
to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to legislate for<br />
the control of rents and prices.<br />
As rent is one of the main items in living costs for the average<br />
person, movements in rents have an important influence on social and<br />
economic stability. State governments have power to control rents,<br />
but it is unlikely that they will all do so at the same time, in the same<br />
way. We have seen earlier what happened to rents after the last war,<br />
when control could have been exercised only by State governments.<br />
If rents are allowed to rise in one , State, but not in others, wages will<br />
rise in that State above the general level. With wages, many other<br />
costs and prices will rise as well. As a result the whole economy may<br />
be thrown out of balance. In practical terms, uniform control of rents<br />
can be secured only if it is applied by the Commonwealth Government.<br />
State government. s have power to control prices. But mainly<br />
because commodities can move freely between States, it is not practicable<br />
for State governments to control more than a limited range of commodities<br />
produced and sold locally. Where goods such as galvanized<br />
iron are produced in only one State it would be impracticable for the<br />
Government of any importing State to maintain an adequate control<br />
over consumers prices while prices charged by the imanufacturers were<br />
beyond their control. Consequently, since the States have only a limited<br />
practical power to control prices, and the Commonwealth has not, in<br />
normal peace-time, any legal power to do so, there is not any really<br />
effective power to control prices anywhere within the country. This,<br />
obviously, is a serious anomaly.<br />
Siress has already been laid on the responsibility of the Commonwealth<br />
for the preservation of economic stability. This means, in plain<br />
terms, the prevention of booms' and slumps', which, in the past,<br />
have brought so much loss, unemployment and misery. It means the<br />
maintenance of steady incomes for producers, in town and country alike.<br />
It means the preservation of a stable purchasing power for money, and<br />
the protection and improvement of living standards for the various<br />
clasaes within the community. This is of particular importance to </p>
<p>pensioners, people with fixed incomes, and all who contribute to the<br />
savings of the community. Control of prices is wrapped up with all<br />
these things. Rises and falls of prices are part and parcel of booms<br />
and ' slumps'. They determine also the value of money, and the distribution<br />
of the national output among the community.<br />
Control of profiteering and monopolies again is closely bound up<br />
with prices, and this is a field in which, for the most part, only Commonwealth<br />
action can be effective. Since monopolies are often nation-wide<br />
in scope, State governments are virtually powerless to deal with them.<br />
Many of the special functions of the Commonwealth are dependent on<br />
a power to regulate prices. The Commonwealth, for example, is concerned<br />
with the overseas marketing of exports. Primary producers are<br />
only too well aware that high prices are likely to be followed by low<br />
prices. All systems of guaranteed prices and home-consumption prices<br />
designed to promote orderly marketing will be greatly strengthened if<br />
the Commonwealth Parliament has power to legislate for minimum<br />
prices. Such a power would overcome many of the difficulties created<br />
in the rural economy by section 92 of the Constitution.<br />
Again, it is the Commonwealth which fixes levels of tariff protection<br />
for local industries. it does so with a view to assisting such<br />
industries to establish themselves and expand. Unless prices charged<br />
by local industries for their products can be supervised and regulated,<br />
there is always a risk that tariff protection : may be abused and the<br />
community exploited. Producers are likely to rely on tariff protection<br />
to maintain their high prices, instead of increasing their efficiency and<br />
moderating their profits to reduce their prices.<br />
All these considerations add up to an overwhelming case for giving<br />
the Commonwealth power to legislate on rents and prices. It is the<br />
only authority in Australia which can exercise such power effectively.<br />
It has had such a power during the war and the post-war period, and<br />
has used it with highly beneficial results. It will need such a power in<br />
the future if it is to preserve and advance the economic welfare of the<br />
nation through a time which threatens very great dangers and<br />
difficulties. There is no short-cut to this end, and we should be warned<br />
by the example of other countries that the quick and easy step of<br />
abandoning all controls can bring far worse troubles than those it was<br />
sought to avoid. Unless the power to control prices is written into the<br />
Cons'itution now, it will not be available to the Australian people when<br />
it is most needed.<br />
The question is not political. It is a simple question, as every<br />
Australian should realize, of making sure that nation-wide protection<br />
can be given in times of difficulty to the tenant, the wage-earner, and the<br />
housewife, to the primary producer, and, in fact, to every Australian<br />
who has to pay for land, or goods, or services of any kind-in other<br />
words, to every Australian." [ The bill was passed.<br />

<p>COMMONWEALTH GRANTS COMMISSION.<br />
SPECIAL GRANTS 1947-48.<br />
In Par it-ment.-On 19th November, 1947, the Prime Minister<br />
( Mr. Chifley) introduced the State Grants Bill. Mr. Chifley said-<br />
The object of this bill is to obtain the approval of the Parliament<br />
to the payment, during 1947-48, of special grants aggregating<br />
œ 5,042,000 to the States of South Australia, Western Australia and<br />
Tasmania. Provision for the payment of these grants follows recommendations<br />
of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The commission<br />
recommended that special grants aggregating œ 6,050,000 be paid to<br />
the claimant States in 1947-48, but added that these recommendations<br />
were made on the assumption that the amount of tax reimbursement to<br />
the States, œ 40,000,000, and the shares of this amount allotted to -the<br />
claimant States remain unchanged in 1947-48. The commission therefore<br />
stipulated that in -he event of any claimant State receiving in<br />
1947-48 more or less by way of tax reimbursement than it received in<br />
1946-47, the commission's recommendation should be adjusted by the<br />
amount of such increase or reduction. The bill authorizes the payment<br />
of an additional tax reimbursement grant of œ 5,000,000 to the States<br />
in 1947-48 under the uniform tax plan. Of this amount, South Australia,<br />
Western Australia and Tasmania will receive œ 432,000, œ 423,000<br />
and œ 153,000 respectively. In accordance with the recomnmendation of<br />
the commission these amounts must be deducted to arrive at the special<br />
grants which the commission considera should be paid this year. On<br />
this basis, the special grants payable in 1947-48 compare with those<br />
actually paid last year as follows:-1940-47. 1947-4.?.<br />

PETROL SUPPLIES.<br />
RATIONING SYSTEM--TJGIITENING<br />
On 24th -November, 1947. the Prime Minister. Mlr. Chificy., iaid-<br />
" In eoiisequence of the increasing gravity of the dollar position,<br />
I have conterreul to-day with the Minister for Supply ( Senator Ashley).<br />
the Secre'arv to the Treasury S. G. MeFarlanc), the acting<br />
IDirector-Gencral of Posts anid Telegraphis ( Mr. G. T. Citippindall), the<br />
Secretary of the Departmnent of Supply ( Mlr. F. A. O'Connor), and the(<br />
C ontroller of Liquid Fuel ( Mr. W. if. Tucker) to determine measures<br />
to eliminate illicit use of rationi tieke'. s and( eii. sure that each consumer<br />
is limlited to the ration onl his licenice.<br />
" A review of~ the sales of petrol throughout Australia during Septemnber<br />
anid October, 1947, shows that the quantities of petrol being<br />
u1sed are in excess of the total Ilcensed galloniage. Thiis drain of petrol<br />
thirough illicit channels endanger., the whole national petrol supply<br />
po~ ition and, uinless arrested, the movement of essential transport<br />
th rough out the Commonweal th will be jeopardized.<br />
" The Government is dletermined to stamp out [, reaches of the Liqjuid<br />
Fulel Regulations and, as a first . step, has decided that petrol coupons<br />
will in future require to be drawn by consumers from a permanent<br />
issuing office, which will include post offices, as from 1st December, 19471.<br />
It is proposed to regard the post office or other issing-office fromn which<br />
a conmumel drawsE is petrol for Decemlber, 1947. 9s his future permanent </p>
<p>issuing office. Only in cases of change of residence or for other very<br />
good reasons will consumers be allowed to transfer their licences from<br />
one issuing depot to another.<br />
Consumers will be free to surrender coupons and purchase petrol<br />
at any garage they desire. Arrangements have been made with the<br />
Postmaster-General and . State Liquid Fuel Control Boards for a<br />
thorough internal audit check in each post office and issuing depot to<br />
prevent any illicit practices. The boards can rely on the full support<br />
of the Commonwealth for any action they take against vendors or<br />
consumers who breach the regulations.<br />
It will not be practicable to follow the procedure of previous years<br />
of issuing January petrol coupons in December, and each month's ration<br />
will have to be drawn separately."<br />
NATIONAL OIL PTY. LTD.-GLEN DAVIS PROJECT,<br />
MINISTER'S REVIEW.<br />
In Parliamenl.-On 4th December, 1947, the Minister for Supply<br />
( Senator Ashley) said-<br />
The experiments at Glen Davis have proved to be very costly.<br />
While flow oil is availalle there will be no possibility of oil produced<br />
from shale competing with it; it is not economically possible. The<br />
Government has spent a considerable sum of money and has taken the<br />
best possible advice in regard to the experiments at Glen Davis, and an<br />
appreciation of the development there has to be made. I do not regard<br />
the considerable atount of money that has been expended as being<br />
entirely wasted, because, as a result of the development at Glen Davis,<br />
we know as much about the production of oil from shale as most other<br />
countries in the world at the present time. The development is still<br />
continuing and it is anticipated that at Glen Davis the oil will be produced<br />
at a cost of approximately 2s. a gallon. However, even with<br />
mass production methods, the retorts situated on the side of the shale,<br />
and all the other ingredients available on the spot, the venture is not<br />
profitable at present, and I do not think the Government would be<br />
interested in supplying further capital for shale oil production in<br />
Australia." EXTERNAL TERRITORIES.<br />
PAPUA-NEW GUINEA-UNION.<br />
On 25th November, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) saicl-<br />
Cabinet decided to-day that a bill be drafted for presentation to<br />
the Federal Parliamentary Labour party, to provide for an administrative<br />
union of the Territory of Papua and the Mandated Territory<br />
of New Guinea with provision for one administrative head, one legislative<br />
. body and conmmon services. The title of the united territories<br />
will be the ' Territory of Papua and New Guinea </p>
<p>BRITAIN.<br />
FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLAR IMPORTS.<br />
On 26th November, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
' A report received yesterday on the commitment for imports in<br />
1947-48 from dollar sources leaves the Government no option but to<br />
make further savings in Australia's dollar commitment. The drift in<br />
the dollar position of the whole sterling area is serious and the latest<br />
figures of the dollar drain are particularly disturbing.<br />
Australia is, as a result of the nature of its international trade, a<br />
net purchaser of dollars from the pool, and if the pooling system were<br />
to break down the resultant dislocation to the Australian economy<br />
would be very serious. But it is very clear that every sterling area<br />
country, including Australia, has to ration itself severely on dollars<br />
if the pooling system is to survive. Last year Australia had a substantial<br />
deficit in its dollar trade. The total commitment revealed in<br />
the report of the special committee investigating the matter showed big<br />
increases over last year's imports from the dollar area. On the other<br />
band, Australian exports to the dollar area are not yet up to last year's<br />
rate. Outstanding import licences were recalled for review on Sth<br />
October, 1947, by the Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice). At<br />
that time, importers were asked to defer shipment until the review was<br />
completed in the hope that in the final analysis some arrangement<br />
could be made to confirm the licences. The position has now become<br />
so grave that the Government is reluctantly compelled to cancel all<br />
licences recalled for review except those covering goods shipped to<br />
Australia on or before 23st October, 1947; those covered by irrevocable<br />
letters of credit; anld those for goods included in the list announced<br />
by the Minister as having a high degree of essentiality. The importation<br />
of any goods from dollar sources without a licence is prohibited<br />
and importers in their own interests should immediately notify their<br />
suppliers of the cancellation.<br />
" Only a limited amount of dollars can be made available for the<br />
issue of new licences for goods from dollar sources to be imported<br />
before 30th June, 1948. The Customs Department has been instructed<br />
to ensure that this amount is allocated only to the highest priority<br />
goods. The committee has also made recommendations for further savings<br />
in regard to certain items involving heavy dollar expenditure which<br />
were not included in the licences recalled for review. These recommendationlu<br />
will be considered by Cabinet on 8th December, 1947.<br />
There is little likelihood of any early easing of the critical dollar<br />
position and, for the future, it has been decided to operate the licensing<br />
of goods from dollar areas on a quota system associated with a budget<br />
ceiling. \ An announcement will be made by Senator Courtice of the<br />
procedure to be followed by importers to establish base year quotas.<br />
7858.-2 </p>
<p>It is clear that the cancellation of licences will interfere with some<br />
production programmes in Australia and the decision has been taken<br />
with the greatest reluctance. The effect of the cancellation can, in<br />
many cases, be absorbed by stock adjustments or new sources of supply<br />
and users of goods are urged to use their utmost resourcefulness in<br />
overcoming the difficulties ahead."<br />
FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLARS, TRAVEL.<br />
On 4th December, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
In view of the deterioration in the dollar position the Government<br />
has decided that approval will not be given to the provision of<br />
dollars for travel for personal reasons. Except in special circumstances,<br />
travel involving dollar expenditure will be restricted to visits<br />
for business purposes which are important from the point of view of<br />
maintaining essential industry or industrial development. In the case<br />
of busine-s visits which would still qualify for the provision of dollars,<br />
a further reduction has been made in the amount which may be<br />
provided." FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLAR IMPORTS, PRIME<br />
MINISTER'S STATEMENT.<br />
In Parliament.-On 4th December, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
" At present there is practically a world-wide shortage of United<br />
States dollars. Among regions affected are Britain, Australia, New<br />
Zealand, India and the other countries of the sterling area, most of<br />
Europe, Canada and the South and Central American countries. For<br />
most of the world, Canadian dollars are also scarce while Canada is<br />
faced with an acute shortage of United States dollars.<br />
Although other factors have contributed to this situation, the most<br />
important cause is the disparity between levels of production in the<br />
United States on the one hand and in Europe and Asia ( including<br />
Indonesia) on the other hand. Restoration of the war-devastated<br />
countries has in general been slow, with the resultr that they have been<br />
able neitier to produce the normal proportion of their own needs nor<br />
to re-cstablili their export trade. Hence there has been a concentration<br />
of demilland on the United States and Canada, where production has<br />
risen more rapidly than elsewhere. The position has been greatly<br />
aggravated by the increase in United States prices, particularly during<br />
the past year.<br />
On recent figures, the rate of exports from the United States has<br />
exceeded the rate of imports by about 10 billion dollars a year.<br />
Whereas during the early post-war period contributions such as those<br />
made under U. N. R. R. A. and the large dollar loans made by United<br />
i </p>
<p>States and Canada eased the position for a number of countries, the<br />
greater part of such aid had, by the middle of 1947, been exhausted and<br />
dollar deficits are now for the most part being met by drawings on<br />
gold and dollar reserves. In most cases such reserves are dwindling<br />
rapidly and cannot sustain for long the present rate of drawings on<br />
them. In efforts to reduce the dollar gap in their balances of payments,<br />
most countries have by now imposed severe restrictions on United<br />
States goods.<br />
There can be. no satisfactory solution to the present dollar problem<br />
until European production and trade are . brought into balance with<br />
Western Hemisphere production. To a large extent this will require a<br />
reconstruction of the European economy and the Marshall Plan is<br />
based on such a concept. It calls for the utmost co-operation and<br />
mutual help between European countries themselves as a condition of<br />
further aid from the United States. The participating countries have<br />
submitted a four-year reconstruction programme for which they are<br />
seeking United States aid to the extent of 22 billion dollars. The<br />
United States Congress is now considering interim proposals for<br />
assistance valued at 597 million dollars to Austria, Italy and France to<br />
cover the needs of these countries until 31st March, 1948. Committees<br />
have been examining the longer term proposals. However, even if the<br />
long term proposals are approved, it is not intended that the assistance<br />
will begin to be available until April, 1948, or later.<br />
Britain emerged from World War II. with her productive structure<br />
seriously impaired and her external income from exports and overseas<br />
investments greatly reduced. She needed a certain level of imports,<br />
largely from the United States to maintain a reasonable living standard<br />
and to supply raw materials and replace capital equipment. With her<br />
overseas investments largely liquidated and her shipping depleted,<br />
exports were the only substantial means of payment remaining, but<br />
even these had fallen by the end of World War II. to 40 per cent. of<br />
the pre-war . volume. It was estimated that the volume of exports would<br />
have to rise to 75 per cent. above pre-war before Britain's overseas<br />
payments would balance again. It was against this background that the<br />
United States loan of 3,750,000,000 dollars was negotiated to assist<br />
Britain in its transitional period. The United States loan became<br />
available on 15th July, 1946. It was estimated that the loan would<br />
last for two to three years. However, it was used up in just over<br />
twelve months, largely because of-<br />
The rapid increase in American price levels; the slow recovery of production<br />
in Europe and Asia; the severe 1946-47 winter in Britain which dislocated<br />
British production; and the demands of other countries for conversion of sterling<br />
into dollars after 15th July, 1947, when sterling became formally convertible<br />
into dollars under the Loan Agreement ( Convertibility was suspended on<br />
August, 1947).<br />

SThese tables indicate that although the listed countries used<br />
œ stg. l125,000,000 of their sterling holdings for expenditure in the dollar<br />
area by converting sterling into dollars or by transferring sterling to<br />
American account, the United Kingdom short-term liabilities to the<br />
same countries declined by only œ stg. 2,700,000 over the period 1st January,<br />
1947, to 31st August, 1947. Thus the movement into dollars<br />
resulted from expenditure in the dollar area of currently earned<br />
sterling rather than a withdrawal of accumulated sterling balances.<br />
However, most of the countries concerned added to their sterling<br />
balances during the first six months of the year and drew heavily against<br />
them in the June-August period. The drain over this latter period<br />
accentuated the running down of the American loan and made inevitable<br />
the suspension of convertibility of sterling into dollars.<br />
On 7th August, 1947, Dr. Dalton informed the House of Commons<br />
that British gold and dollar reserves amounted to about 2,400,000,000<br />
dollars. As there is a limit ' below which the British Government could </p>
<p>not permit these reserves to fall, it became necessary, after exhaustion<br />
of the American loan, to devise means of reducing the dollar deficit<br />
drastically enough to safeguard these reserves, which are the reserves not<br />
only of Britain but also of the whole sterling area.<br />
" Britain took the lead in imposing very heavy restrictions on<br />
dollar imports, instituting a renewed export drive and curtailing the use<br />
of dollars on travel, films, military expenditure, and so on. The effect<br />
of these restrictions was to reduce Britain's dollar import programme<br />
for 194S by 400,000,000 dollars.<br />
On 24th October, 1947, Dr. Dalton informed the House of Commons<br />
that the rate of drain was still about 70,000,000 dollars a week, or<br />
about 3,600,000,000 dollars a year.<br />
" On 23rd October, 1947, Sir Stafford Cripps stated that, as a result<br />
of the various measures taken, it was estimated that by the end of 1948<br />
the dollar deficit would be running at a rate not greater than<br />
1,000,000,000 dollars a year, by which time the reserves remaining would<br />
only be something over 1,000,000,000 dollars.<br />
To assist in meeting the position, Britain has drawn 180,000,000<br />
dollars from the International Monetary Fund against its yearly quota<br />
of 325,000,000 dollars. It has also negotiated with South Africa a<br />
loan of gold to the value of 320,000,000 dollars, but has had to ship to<br />
the United States gold to the value of 220,000,000 dollars in payment for<br />
goods. It is clear that, unless the rate of drain from reserves can be<br />
reduced by further cuts in dollar expenditure, there will be no alternative<br />
for sterling area countries but to live within their current dollar<br />
earnings. Even if the long-term proposals contained in the Marshall<br />
Plan are approved and Britain benefits to some extent directly, any<br />
significant improvement in the British position can only come from<br />
the restoration of the European countries.<br />
" These benefits can be expected to mature only gradually. It is<br />
emphasized that the immediate relief contemplated by the United States<br />
Government for European countries is comparatively small and is confined<br />
to France, Italy and Austria and it may be several months before<br />
even this becomes effective. Even if approved by Congress the major<br />
measures of the Marshall Plan may not come into operation for a considerable<br />
time and it should be realized that the principal form of<br />
aid at present contemplated is a contribution of foodstuffs, industrial<br />
materials and equipment. This will help to reduce the dependence of<br />
the countries concerned on dollar supplies. But it will not directly<br />
relieve Britain's problem of securing payment in dollar-convertible<br />
currencies for her exports to those countries.<br />
The grave economic difficulties with which Britain is confronted,<br />
largely as a result of her sacrifices during the war, must be a matter of<br />
much concern to all other members of the British Commonwealth.<br />
Among the greatest of these difficulties is the dollar shortage. The<br />
Australian Government desires to do everything in its power to assist </p>
<p>39<br />
Britain in overcoming her dollar difficulties. For this reason the<br />
Government announced on 4th September, 1947, that it had been<br />
decided to sell, for the time being, current gold production to Britain<br />
as a special measure of assistance. Before this, Au, ralia's current<br />
production lhd leen added to the gold reserve.<br />
It must be realized that the normal pattern of Australia's overseas<br />
trade is such that we are usually not drawers on the sterling area dollar<br />
pool in respect of both Unites States and Canadian dollars. During<br />
the war years, when a large number of American troops were stationed<br />
in Australia, dollar accruals substantially exceeded dollar outgoings.<br />
The net surplus of dollars was sold to Britain for sterling and was used<br />
by Britain in the prosecution of the war. With the removal of American<br />
troops from the Australian theatre and the cessation of hostilities ( and<br />
with it, the termination of Lend-Lease), Australia's international<br />
receipts and payments resumed their traditional pattern and it again<br />
became necessary to purchase dollars for sterling from Britain to cover<br />
out net dollar deficit. This deficit has tended to be larger than in<br />
pre-war years because of the factors already mentioned as underlying<br />
the whole problem of the world-wide dollar shortage-the slow recovery<br />
of production in Europe and Asia and the rise in American pri,: e<br />
levels. " Conservation of both United S: ates and Canadian dollars is<br />
an inescapable necessity for Australia. We can, of course, help by<br />
increasing our exports to the dollar area. Wool is our greatest dollar<br />
elarner, but the scale of American wool purchases is governed by factors<br />
largely outside our control. Exports of wool to the United , States in<br />
1946-47 were valued at œ A. 25,900,000. This figure does not include<br />
wool valued at œ A. 9,900,000 which, although shipped during 1946-47,<br />
had been purchased at issue prices during 1945-46 from the Australian<br />
Wool Realization Commission before the resumption of the wool<br />
auctions. The Australian Wool Realization Commission expects sales of<br />
wool to America during 1947-48 to be less in quantity than in 1946-47.<br />
This reduction in quantity will be partly offset by the rise in wool prices<br />
Iut the commission, on present indications, expects the value of sales<br />
to the United States to be slightly less than last year. In addition, the<br />
commi-sion anticipn'c thte!' r wli1 some small sales to Canada and<br />
other countries which will pay in dollars.<br />
The Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard) is examining the<br />
possibility of increasing exports of other commodities to the dollar<br />
area. There is at presnt a strong demand in the Unied States for<br />
various raw and manufactured products produced in Australia, but, in<br />
many instances, exports have been restricted to preserve adequate<br />
supplies to meet the needs of the home market. We may, however.<br />
have to consider whether additional quantities of sone of these goods<br />
can be released for export to earn dollars to pay for more essential<br />
goods which we need to import from dollar sources to keep our<br />
industries operating.<br />
7858.-4 </p>
<p>" Since the outbreak of war in 1939, imports from the dollar area<br />
have in general been limited to essential goods not available in adequate<br />
quantities from sterling sources of supply. However, in present circumstances,<br />
a great many items are obtainable only from the dollar area<br />
: and the great development which has taken place in Australian industry<br />
has increased the demand for imported machinery and raw materials.<br />
During the period immediately following the cessation of hostilities,<br />
when reconversion of American production to a peace-time basis was<br />
incomplete, the level of dollar imports was limited by lack of availability.<br />
During the current year, however, American production has<br />
caught up with the backlog of domestic demand in many fields and<br />
many items have come into free supply for the export trade. This,<br />
coupled with the steep rise in dollar prices, has led to a very rapid<br />
growth in the value of dollar goods imported into Australia. Our<br />
imports from the United States and Canada in 1946-47 were valued at<br />
œ A. 63,000,000, on the recorded basis of f. o. b. plus 10 per cent. In the<br />
first four months of 1947-48, imports from the United States and<br />
Canada were about œ A. 41,000,000-an annual rate of œ A. 123,000,000.<br />
Accurate estimates of Australia's balance of paymeuts with individual<br />
countries are difficult to obtain, particularly because of the high<br />
propor: ion of our overseas trade which is financed through London.<br />
However, on 30th September, 1947, the House was informed that, on the<br />
basis of such information as is available, it was estimated that in 1946-47<br />
Australia's dollar deficit amounted to about 100 million dollars.<br />
" Following the suspension of convertibility of sterling into dollars<br />
and the exhaustion of the American loan, the Commonwealth Government<br />
took stock of the position and decided on certain measures to<br />
reduce the size of Australia's deficit for 1947-48 and thus reduce the<br />
demands we would have to ' make on Britain to provide us with dollars<br />
from their ultimate reserve of gold and dollars.<br />
" Following the September decisions, Australian officials were sent<br />
to London at the request of the BritisL Government to participate in<br />
discussions between representatives of the various sterling area countries<br />
on the general dollar situation and the steps required to meet it. Those<br />
talks revealed that the rate of drain on the British gold and dollar<br />
reserves was even more serious than had been realized and the British<br />
authorities requested that Australia should undertake to live within<br />
its current dollar income and to make no net claim on Britain for<br />
dollars. The Commonwealth Government felt unable to give a rigid<br />
undertaking. Since our dollar earnings are apt to vary widely from<br />
year to year there could be no certainty as to what such a commitment<br />
would entail. But it was evident that should our dollar income decline<br />
heavily we might find ourselves unable to fulfil such an undertaking<br />
without causing excessive dislocation to Australian industry. The<br />
Government did, however, undertake to co-operate with the British<br />
Government in reducing dollar expenditure to the fullest practicable<br />
extent.<br />
i' 1 </p>
<p>41<br />
" When the September review was made, no clear picture was<br />
available of the extent to which we were alrecady comnitted to expenditure<br />
of dollars by import licences already granted. Statistics were<br />
available on the total value of licences issued, but it was not known<br />
to what extent the goods covered by these licences had already been<br />
imnportedl or what proportion was still to come forward. Accordingly,<br />
early in October, 1947, all outstanding dollar import licences ( except<br />
for certain commodities covered by special arrangements), were recalled<br />
for review, to establish more precisely the extent of our dollar commitments<br />
for imports during 1947-48 and to enable consideration to be<br />
given to the possibilities of further economies in dollar expenditure.<br />
* An inter-departmental committee was subsequently appointed to<br />
examine the figures obtained from the review of import licences and to<br />
make recommendations on the steps necessary to reduce dollar imports<br />
in 1947-48 to a figure which we could hope to finance from current<br />
dollar earnings and dollars available from Britain.<br />
" This committee has presented an initial report which indicated<br />
that, despite the September dollar cute, outstanding commitments were<br />
so high that, in the absence of further measures, imports from the<br />
United States and Canada during 1947-48 would exceed œ A. 100,000,000,<br />
as against œ A. 63,000,000 for 1946-47. Even if dollar earnings during<br />
1947-48 reach the 1946-47 level, it is clear that with imports of over<br />
œ EA. 100,000,000, Australia's dollar deficit for 1947-48 would be considerably<br />
greater than la. 9t year's, notwithstanding the sale of current<br />
gold output.<br />
wa" The picture disclosed by the inter-departmental committee's report<br />
wsso serious that the Government felt compelled to take drastic action<br />
to reduce dollar expenditure on imports during 1947-48 and to ensure<br />
that the rate of importation throughout the whole of 1948 would hwe<br />
confined to levels which it would be practicable to finance. The total<br />
value of dollar import licences recalled for review was œ A.. 52,000,000.<br />
Action is being-taken to confirm these licences in all cases where goods<br />
were in transit, irrevocable letters of credit had been established and the<br />
goods covered were included in the list of highly essential items<br />
announced on 30th October, 1947. The Government had hoped that it<br />
would be possible to avoid cancellation of any licences, but, in the light<br />
of the inter-departmental committee's report, it was felt that there was9<br />
wastho alternative but to cancel all outstanding licences not falling<br />
wihnthe above categories. It is estimated that the effect of these<br />
decisions will be to confirm licences to a value of œ A. 35,000,000, ' and to<br />
cancel licences to a value of œ A. 17,000,000.<br />
" Major items involving dollar expenditure such as newsprint, motor<br />
vehicle chassis, tobacco, petrol and film remittances are being dealt with<br />
separately and were not covered in the general review of import licences.<br />
Further economies in these major items will be inescapable and specific<br />
proposals will he submitted to Cabinet for decision. </p>
<p>12<br />
" Despite the action already taken and the further action proposed,<br />
our inescapable commitments are so great that the possibilities of<br />
effecting reductions in dollar expenditure durng 1947-48 are limited.<br />
Even when all possible action has been taken it seems probable that<br />
imports from the United States and Canada during 1947-47 will be<br />
about œ A. 90,000,000. However, a marked tapering off in dollar imports<br />
may be expected during the second half of 1947-48 and imports during<br />
the calendar year 1948 from the dollar area will be reduced to a level<br />
bearing a much closer relationship to our current dollar earnings.<br />
The Government appreciates that, to meet cases of special urgency,<br />
some new licences will have to be granted for the importation of goods<br />
from the dollar area during 1947-48. However, a ceiling figure has<br />
been placed on the value of such licences and the inter-departmental<br />
committee has been given ' the responsibility of recommending the<br />
allocation of licences withing the ceiling . figure. The Government is<br />
now considering the basis on which dollar import licences are to be<br />
issued for goods to be imported during 1948-49. It is proposed to<br />
establish quotas for the various classes of goods within a budget ceiling<br />
and the Minister of Trade and Customs ( Senator Courtice) will<br />
announce as soon as possible the procedure to be followed in granting<br />
import licences.<br />
The Government regrets the inconvenience and hardship which<br />
cancellation of import licences and other dollar conservation measures<br />
have caused in industry and commerce. It feels confident, however, that<br />
the Australian people as a whole will support the action taken, since<br />
failure to reduce dollar expenditure would inevitably increase the much<br />
greater hardships at present being endured by the British people.<br />
Britain is at present making sales from its reserves of gold and is<br />
borrowing from the International Monetary Fund to pay for imports<br />
of food and other essential goods and to meet the dollar deficit of other<br />
members of the sterling area. Australia must do what she can to help<br />
by reducing net demands on Britain for dollars to the absolute<br />
minimum." FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLAR. S, PRIME MINISTER'S<br />
. STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT.<br />
In Parliament.-On 4th December, 1947, Mr. Chifley said--<br />
" To understand the Government's attitude towards the dollar<br />
shortage, it is necessary to go back to the time when Sir Kingsley Wood<br />
was Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain. For a long time, Britain<br />
had been selling foreign securities to finance the war, and was thus<br />
losing its income from foreign investments. This income had formerly<br />
come to Britain in the form of food and raw materials, and. no doubt,<br />
in the form of luxury items, also. It did not require any one of great<br />
sagacity to forecast that if this process was continued much longer,<br />
economic difficulties must inevitably arise. During the war, and afterwards,<br />
the Australian Government maintained restrictions on the use<br />
of dollars. I realized that the British Government. operating under </p>
<p>43<br />
the Anglo-American Loan Agreement, was bound by certain obligations<br />
which did not apply rigidly to Australia. We have guarded, so far<br />
as we thought reasonable, against the undue expenditure of American<br />
dollars for goods and equipment.<br />
There is nothing very mystifying about the position. It is true<br />
that the situation has deteriorated very rapidly during the last eighteen<br />
months. The loan that Lord Keynes negotiated on behalf of the<br />
British Government with the United States Govermnent was not as<br />
large as the British Government wanted. The terms of the loan were<br />
generous, but some of the conditions attaching to it I regard as very<br />
obnoxious. It was hoped, however, that the loan would be sufficient to<br />
maintain the Empire pool of dollars long enough to allow certain things<br />
to happen. The first was the rehabilitation of British industry, and<br />
the development of the British export trade; the second was the<br />
rehabilitation of Europe, which would have provided a market for<br />
: British goods, and would have supplied other goods in return. This<br />
hope was defeated by the disastrous inflation of prices in the United<br />
States, which meant that the quantity of goods which could h. e bought<br />
out of the loan was much smaller than had been expected. Moreover,<br />
the price of goods bought from Argentina, and other hard currency<br />
rountries, rose in some instances by 150 per cent., and prices generally<br />
increased by 40 per cent. The second factor which helped to defeat<br />
the original plan was that the rehabilitation of Europe has not proceeded<br />
as was expected. For some time, climatic conditions in Britain<br />
were disastrous, a fact which added to that country's troubles. For a<br />
considerable time, more than two million of Britain's men were overseas<br />
on military duty in various parts of the world, and it was not<br />
possible to withdraw them immediately, although that is now being<br />
done as quickly as possible. Those inen were not producing, and some<br />
of themn-tho. e in Germany, Palestine and Egypt-were drawing on<br />
dollars from the American loan for their upkeep.<br />
It is true that we could export to dollar, or hard currency, areas<br />
a quantity of goods and coiiniodities that we are now either using ourselves,<br />
or are sending to Britain, where they are sorely needed. I have<br />
discussed this matter with the Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard).<br />
I have gone into it very fully. We could, no doubt, export more goods<br />
to hard currency areas such a. s the Philippines, China, Panama, South<br />
America and to Switzerland. But we must never lose sight of the fact<br />
that, for a number of reasons, we owe a great responsibility and duty<br />
to Britain. One reason is that the British are a great nation with<br />
wonderful traditions. During the last seven or eight years they have<br />
shown a magnificent spirit. They bore the brunt of the catastrophic<br />
war from 1939 until 1945. To-day, they are in most difficult circiunstances.<br />
A second, and very material, reason is that Britain has been<br />
Australia'. greatest customer. Therefore, we cannot lightly brush<br />
aside our duty to Britain. Australia is one of the countries which made<br />
the least economic sacrifice, and suffered least in World War II. Are<br />
we to deny to Britain wheat, butter and other good. s which our kinsfolk </p>
<p>44<br />
urgently need because they can offer us payment only in sterling? If<br />
we decided to withold those goods so that we should not make any<br />
sacrifices, we should increase intensely Britain's economic difficulties.<br />
The Australian Government is not prepared to do that.<br />
Two problems arise. One is whether we should export to the<br />
dollar area certain materials and commodities in short supply here,<br />
which Britain does not particularly require but which we ourselves<br />
badly need for our own industries. In the hard currency countries we<br />
could sell cement, steel, constructional steel, . steel rods and timber.<br />
But if we did so we should accentuate the scarcity of these materials.<br />
One of the great problems now confronting the people of the United<br />
States arises because America has exported such enormous quantities<br />
of goods as to produce a shortage in the domestic market. That has<br />
accentuated the inflationary spiral. Because of the enormous volume<br />
of exports, many goods are in short supply, and, with the abolition of<br />
prices control, the American people are obliged to pay excessive prices<br />
for them. We must examine the problem as realists. We desire to extend<br />
to Britain all possible assistance, while striking a fair balance to ensure<br />
that our own people do not make undue sacriefices. This course is to<br />
be preferred to seizing every opportunity to sell our exports in the hard<br />
currency and dollar area. Britain, which urgently needs these goods,<br />
has been, and will -be, our greatest customer for decades. Are we to<br />
ignore the plight of Britain because some temporary customer requires<br />
these goods and is prepared to pay dollars for them? Are we to<br />
deprive our greatest customer, friend and ally of those goods? We<br />
must weigh all these factors realistically.<br />
The Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice) is deluged with<br />
requests from other countries for Australian goods. Most of these<br />
goods happen to be urgently required on the Australian market. The<br />
International Food Council considers that Australia's exports of food<br />
R hould be allocated in a fair proportion to the needs of the people who<br />
require them. Britain is a party to the International Food Council.<br />
Senator Courtice could readily find markets for our wheat in China,<br />
for which we would receive payment in American dollars, or in<br />
Switzerland, for which we would be paid in Swiss francs, and for other<br />
goods in the Philippines or Panama. If we sold these goods and conmmodities<br />
in China, Switzerland, the Philippines and Panama, the<br />
people of Britain and Australia would not have adequate supplies.<br />
Therefore. we must strike a balance. Senator Courtice has been<br />
examining the subject very closely to ascertain whether we can export<br />
goods without doing an injustice to Britain and disrupting our own<br />
economy There is no mum. bo-jumbo about the dollar shortage. What i.<br />
the real source of the trouble? The value of the goods which the United<br />
States has exported is approximately three times, as much in dollars<br />
s the value of the goods which it has imported. To that situation,<br />
I<br />
I'l </p>
<p>there can be only one answer. This formn of trade must have violent<br />
repercussions. I do not condemn the United States. Had it not been<br />
for the assistance of the United States in World War II., Australia<br />
might have been conquered by the Japanese. When we begin to<br />
examine this problem we discover there are many matters which must<br />
be studied. If the value of the exports of a country are three times<br />
the value of its imports, there can be only one result.<br />
" The United States * has made great contributions to assist other<br />
countries, and the maintenance of Japan to-day is costing an e normous<br />
sum. America has poured out billions of dollars, and perhaps some<br />
doubt may be expressed as to the wisdom of the way in which the<br />
money was expended. However, this granting of assistance is a tribute<br />
to the American Government, the Department of State and people who<br />
have some appreciation of the enormous problems now confronting the<br />
world. It would be easy for me to say that the only course which will<br />
remedy the situation is for the American people to make the most<br />
magnificent gesture that the world has ever seen. That idea is not<br />
easy to sell to all the American people. When we are situated so far<br />
away from America, it is easy for us to preach about lofty ideals, and<br />
what the United States should do. It is not always easy to convince a<br />
majority of the people of the right policy to adopt in relation to other<br />
countries. That is one of the great difficulties which American statesmen<br />
are facing to-day. I make no criticism of that. It is for the<br />
Americans, as people living in a democracy, to choose the course which<br />
they think fit.<br />
It would not matter whether the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr.<br />
Menzies) or any one else was in office at present. He would have to<br />
face the reality that Australia could not get goods from the dollar area<br />
without paying for them. The great industrial barons are not<br />
philanthropists. They do not manufacture motor vehicles, cotton<br />
textiles and tractors with the idea of presenting them to us free of<br />
charge. The conditions attached to the Anglo-A-merican loan contained a<br />
provision for convertibility of sterling balances. India, Egypt, Australia,<br />
Southern Ireland, New Zealand, and South Africa had all<br />
accumulated enormous sterling balances in London. They were all in<br />
a position given good seasons such as we are now experiencing, to earn<br />
a great amount of current sterling. That is also true of Argentina, a<br />
country which was exporting goods to Britain and charging very high<br />
prices for them. When the convertibility provision of the Anglo-<br />
American loan commenced to operate, those countries immediately<br />
rushed in to obtain dollars. A certain amount of that sort of thing<br />
was done in Australia. Those who held lecters of credit demanded<br />
dollars, irrespective of the strain placed on the British Tretu; ury, even<br />
though, in some oases, their goods were still on the water. Betweeii the<br />
time when this~ rush hogan and the time when the British Chancellor </p>
<p>had to announce d a r Aol lar euies ismust end, there was an etiormifls<br />
flow of dollars fromi' the 13lritish pool. The dralin was so severe<br />
that it had to be stoiped, despite the provision in the termts of the<br />
Anlglo-Anicrica n loan. Since then, the prices of goods in dollar aS.<br />
and indeed akho in hard currency areas, have continued to rise so tha-t<br />
British couintries are nowv unable to obtain, for-a given amount of doilitn<br />
( urretl,-y, the same quentity of goods as they could obtain previously.<br />
" The Britiqlh Government has used almost all of the Amierican<br />
luau. ANi aniount of 400.000,000 dollars ivas held in the pool wheni dhe<br />

I am hopeful that, it will be released. The British Government had<br />
abuC600,' 000,000 sterling, in gold reserves when the crisis occurred.<br />
It lhas had to draw extensively on those reserves. In adldition, it lias<br />

In return, Aus! tralia will be credited in dollars with the value of that<br />
grold. It istrue that the British Government requested that we should<br />
live wvithin oui-dollar earnings. I told the Treasury in London at tihe<br />
time that that iva an impossible task for Australia.<br />
Last year, despite the restrictions this Government imposed, Australia<br />
had to purchase 100,000,000 Canadian and American dollars from<br />
the depleted Empire pool. This year, even though we have imposed<br />
further restrictions on the use of dollars,_ the situation is still rapidly<br />
deteriorating. Very reasonable supervision has been maintained over<br />
the issuing of import licences for goods that involve dollar expenditure.<br />
hut, owing increased prices and other reasons, we arc still importing<br />
far larger quantities W dollar goodls than we could expect a country<br />
which iq starved of dollars to sell to us. Those are the hard, cold facts.<br />
I eannot at this moment say whe'hcr even the suggested res triction. s<br />
that will lbe considered lvCabinet on Sth Decemtber. 1947, will be<br />
su1ifilcient to mneet the denian'ls of the situation. I noticed a statement in<br />
the British pres last week in which a very high tribute was paid to the<br />
co-operation of the Niv; raliaii Government in saving dollars. That </p>
<p>statement declared that, if other countries had done as Britain and<br />
Australia had done, Britain would by now have been much nearer than<br />
it is to the top of the very steep hill to complete economic rehabilitation<br />
which it is climbing.<br />
" The Government is discussing problems associated with dollar<br />
shortages with the various industries affected so that it may have the<br />
considered views of everybody on the subject. We are anxious to cushion<br />
the impact of restrictions so that industries may he kept operating as<br />
much as possible and so that people employed in them shall suffer as<br />
little as possible.<br />
My final word is that we must guard against the exhaustion of<br />
the British Empire dollar pool. Should the pool reach such a low ebb<br />
that dollars cannot be released to us, then we must sharply cut off<br />
imports of all things that we now hope to purchase with dollars drawn<br />
from it. That would mean a sudden disruption of the national economy.<br />
We want to avoid doing that and to continue to do justice to our own<br />
people and to our great allies the people of Great Britain."<br />
FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLAR IMPORTS, CABINET<br />
DECISIONS.<br />
On 8th December, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-<br />
"' The statement on the dollar situation tabled in the House of<br />
CRpresentatives on 4th December, 1947, indicated that of the<br />
œ A. 52,000,000 of dollar import licences recalled for review about<br />
œ A. 35,000,000 were to be confirmed and about œ A. 17,000,000 were to<br />
be cancelled. However, major items such as motor chassis and tobacco, involving<br />
heavy dollar expenditure, were not included in the general review of<br />
import licences. Cuts in these major items were made by Cabinet in<br />
September, 1947, but the statement presented to Parliament pointed<br />
out that further economies would be inescapable and that specific<br />
proposals would be submitted to Cabinet for decision at its next<br />
meeting. Afer a full review of the dollar position, Cabinet has now decided<br />
to effect further economies in dollar expenditure on the following<br />
iterrn-:-MOTOR VF\ in'cI. Cu(:'\ ss.-linllmports otf mtor vehicle chassis from North<br />

hiIve alr4: eady beeln umule and any further reduction in dollar expenditure ou<br />
imports , of tobacco leaf cannot therefore be made effective until the financial<br />
year 1948-49. Cabinet decided to reduce importa of American tobacco leaf in<br />
1948-49 by approximately 50 per cent. This will involve a 10 per cent. reduction<br />
in releases for consumption as from 1st January, 1948, combined with a reduction<br />
in uresent stock holdings. I </p>
<p>48<br />
NEWSPRINT FOR THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY.-Cabinet approved a reduction<br />
in total newsprint consumption ( Australian and imported) to 90,000 tons per<br />
annum as from 1st January, 1948. This makes the average cut on pre-war<br />
consumption 51 per cent.<br />
PETROL.-Cabinet decided to effect a further 10 per cent. reduction in total<br />
licensed gallonage. The cut will be applied uniformly to all classes of<br />
consumers. FILM REMrTTANCES.-Under decisions previously announced the film companies<br />
are permitted to remit to their principals in the United States 70 per<br />
cent. of the amount of their remittances in the base year ( 1946). Cabinet<br />
decided that as from 1st January, 1948, remittances should be limited to 50 per<br />
cent. of the base year quota, earnings in excess of that figure to be retained in<br />
Australia. " After allowing for the effect of these decisions and the decisions<br />
announced earlier by the Government, total imports from the United<br />
I States and Canada in 1947-48 will still be about œ A. 90,000,000, compared<br />
with actual imports in 1946-47 of just over œ A. 60,000,000. It is<br />
anticipated, however, that the measures taken by the Government will<br />
reduce the rate of importation in the calendar year 1948 to one which<br />
is practicable in the light of the assessment of the dollar situation at<br />
present available.<br />
" Cabinet discussed the possibility of reducing the size of Australia's<br />
dollar deficit by adopting measures to increase Australian exports to<br />
the dollar area. It was recognized that the possibilities were limited<br />
because of existing commitments to Britain and because many of the<br />
items which could be sold for dollars are in short supply in Australia.<br />
The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard) was<br />
authorized to take. steps within the framework of existing export<br />
controls to divert a greater proportion of Australian produced goods to<br />
dollar export markets. Any measures adopted will be taken after consultation<br />
with other interested Commonwealth departments and with<br />
the industries affected."<br />

MIGRATION.<br />
GOVERNMENT POLICY-MINISTER'S STATEMENT,<br />
NOVEMBER, 1947.<br />
In Parliament.-On 28th November, 1947, the Minister for Immigration<br />
( Mr. Calwell) said-<br />
I am able to inform the House that, when 1947-the first full year<br />
of large-scale, planned immigration-has run. its course, Australia will<br />
have received 30,000 permanent arrivals, in spite of the desperate postwar<br />
shipping shortage, which is afflicting Britain so grievously, which<br />
i all nations suffer in common and which is one of the main obstacles to<br />
the achievement of our target figure of 70,000 immigrants a year.<br />
These 30,000 new arrivals represent all of the three main streams of<br />
immigrants-British, American and European-on which Australia<br />
must rely for the new life blood it so urgently needs.<br />
i f </p>
<p>I.,<br />
49<br />
In Britain to-day over 400,000 people are anxious to settle in<br />
Australia. Of the 30,000 permanent new arrivals we shall have gained<br />
by the end of 1947, the vast majority will be from Britain.<br />
It is not a healthy condition to have an over-populated Britain<br />
and under-populated dominions, and conversely it is mutually beneficial<br />
to have all the Dominions of the British Commonwealth increasing in<br />
strength from year to year. Britain therefore must help Australia so<br />
that Australia may help Britain and the Blritish Commonwealth of<br />
Nations. I hope that the British authorities will -understand our need<br />
as we press for more and more ships to carry more and more people to<br />
this country. We have no wish to embarrass the British Government by<br />
seeking large numbers of specialists who are in short supply. Aus<br />
tralia's man-power requirements cover such a wide range in every field<br />
of primary, secondary and tertiary industry that we are not obliged to<br />
seek workers for only a few particular occupations. We can, therefore,<br />
readily absorb a cross-section of British people without detriment to<br />
Britain's economic structure but with material advantage to both<br />
countries. We have always been prepared to accept this fair crosssection.<br />
The Government realizes that the provision of Shipping is the<br />
key to immigration plans and has examined every possibility of<br />
obtaining additional transport for British migrants. The results will<br />
be demonstrated in 1948 when the migrant lift will be substantially<br />
greater than has been possible in 1947. The shipping position is one<br />
which will show progressive improvement over the next two or three<br />
years, even thought that improvement is not as fast as we would like.<br />
Nevertheless, I am confident that we shall obtain transport for at least<br />
25.000 free and assisted passage British migrants in 1948. This number<br />
is, of course, additional to the total of full fare paying passengers.<br />
" During the war years, many thousands of American servicemen<br />
visited Australia. Already, 10,000 applications have been received in<br />
the United States, repres'e'nting about 20,000 potential migrants. To<br />
deal with these applications and to select migrants wh-o will be of the<br />
g4reatest benefit to our economy, trained immigration officers with knowledge<br />
of Australian industrial requirements have been attached to the<br />
Austialian Consulates-General at New York and San Francisco. The<br />
first party of 70 United States migrants to benefit from the scheme<br />
arrived in Australia in September, 1947, and further parties have<br />
brought the total to 206. While this is a useful start, it is obvious that<br />
wve will not increase our population by any substantial number while<br />
wec depend on the very limuited passenger shipping at present plying<br />
between America and Australia. I took action while in America<br />
recently to institute negotiations with the Matson Line for two additional<br />
vessels to be put on the San Francisco-Sydney run with the aid<br />
of a subsidy by the Commonwealth Government against loss on<br />
operation. These negotiations are still proceeding, -and if rnutna-ily </p>
<p>satisfactory arrangements can be made, each ship will be able to carry<br />
3,900 United States migrants a year, based on 650 passengers a voyage,<br />
and a round voyage every two months.<br />
To-day, there are in Germany some 850,000 displaced persons,<br />
mainly of Baltic, Polish and Yugo-Slav origin. Their occupations<br />
include agriculturalists, hospital workers, shipwrights, light manufacturing<br />
workers, building workers, engineers, dentists, doctors and other<br />
professional men. These persons, whose normal standards of living<br />
have been compatible with our own, and who even now do not, in a large<br />
proportion of cases, consist of depressed classes, represent an ideal<br />
source of migrants who will fit smoothly into our way of life and who<br />
will help to meet Australia's labour shortages in the fields of industry<br />
and agriculture. Initially it was decided that 12,000 displaced persons<br />
should be brought to Australia annually under the agreement, but the<br />
Commonwealth is willing to increase this number to 20,000 a year. To<br />
implement this agreement, an Australian selection team, including<br />
doctors, has been appointed, and operates under the aegis of the head<br />
of the Australian Military Mission at Berlin. Migrants are selected<br />
on the basis of their suitability for employment and absorption into<br />
our Australian community.<br />
The Commonwealth Government has entered into an agreement<br />
with ! he Netherlands Emigration Foundation for the migration to<br />
Australia of Dutch national.. Initially, it is proposed to bring to<br />
Australia farm workers at the rate of 50 per month. When the employment<br />
situation in Holland permits, consideration will he given to the<br />
extension of the scheme to other categories of workers.<br />
" During 1946. the record nimrber of 7,126 certificates of naturalization<br />
was issued to persons of 41 different nationalities. For the first<br />
half of 1947, 1,654 certificates were issued comprising 33 different<br />
nationalities. In previous years, the number of certificates issued rarely<br />
exceeded 1,500 in any one year. The granting of naturalization is one<br />
of the most effective means of facilitating the assimilntion of the non-<br />
SBritish members of our population.<br />
" I have said that the present procedure connected with the taking<br />
II of the Oath of Allegiance by applicants for naturalization left much<br />
to be desired. The Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council<br />
considered this matter, and has recommended that the administration<br />
of the oath should be conducted in open court, accompanied by an<br />
appropriate and dignified induction ceremony, which should include<br />
the delivery of an address to the applicants by the presiding judge or<br />
magistrate An appropriate form of oath of allegiance, and suitable<br />
arrangements for induction ceremonies are now under consideration.<br />
1 The council has also recommended that the Department of Immigration<br />
should issue a pamphlet for the guidance of prospective citizens, which<br />
would describe to them in simple language our historical background,<br />
i 1 </p>
<p>51<br />
our mode of government and the responsibilities and privileges of<br />
Australian citizenship. I have approved this recommendation and the<br />
preparation of the pamphlet is now in hand as part of a campaign<br />
designed accelerate the assimilation of the alien newcomers.,"<br />
CIVIL AVIATION.<br />
INTERNAL ROUITES--GOVERNMENT CONTROL, AIRIINES<br />
COMMISSION ACT, AMENDING BILL.<br />
In Parliament.-On 3rd December, 1947, the Minister for Air<br />
( Mr. Drakeford) introduced the Australian National Airlines Bill.<br />
Mr. Drakeford said-<br />
" The primary purpose of this bill is to authorize the Australian<br />
National Airlines Commission to undertake and develop intra-state air<br />
services. Under the existing act, the commission may engage in intrastate<br />
services only to the extent that such services are incidental to<br />
the safe, efficient and economical operation of interstate territorial and<br />
international services. As one step towards the development of intrastate<br />
services, it is proposed that section 19 be amplified so as to<br />
authorize expressly the transport of mail within any State. While<br />
section 22 of the existing act refers to the promotion of the carriage<br />
of mails this section is not expressly linked with section 19. The<br />
Commonwealth Parliament has unquestionable power to provide air<br />
transport, whether interstate or intra-state, for postal purposes, and it<br />
is now considered desirable that the commission should be clearly<br />
authorized to carry mails intra-state so as to be able to implement any<br />
agreement for the carriage of mails authorized under section 22. The<br />
commission will then be able to carry passengers and freight within<br />
any State as incidental to the postal service, provided that the primary<br />
purpose of a particular service is the carriage of mail.<br />
" It is proposed that provision be made for the adoption of the<br />
powers in relation to air transport referred to the Commonwealth in<br />
1943 under the Commonwealth Powers Acts of the various States<br />
except Victoria and Tasmania. Queensland and New South Wales have<br />
referred to this Parliament the matter of air transport and South<br />
Australia and Western Australia the matter of the regulation of air<br />
transport. These references remain effective and cannot be revoked by<br />
ordinary legislative process until 2nd September, 1950, so that until<br />
that date the Commonwealth Parliament may make laws in respect of<br />
air transport within the States which have made the references. As<br />
yet these special and additional powers referred by the States have not<br />
been invoked.<br />
" During the recent conference of Commonwealth and State<br />
Ministers, the Premier of Queensland indicated that his Government<br />
desired the Commonwealth to authorize the commission to establish and<br />
operate intra-state services in Queensland on condition that the commission<br />
pays the same rate of tax as that imposed by that State on<br />
privately operated airlines. The Government considers that it will be i </p>
<p>of direct benefit, not only to Queensland, but to the Commonwealth as a<br />
whole, if the commission develops intra-state services within Queensland<br />
and other States, even though it is possible that these services, in view of<br />
their developmental nature, may he unprofitable in the beginning. It<br />
has decided to accept the invitation of the Queensland Government to<br />
engage in this new sphere of air service operations.<br />
The provision in the bill implementing State references authorizes<br />
the establishment, maintenance and operation of air services within any<br />
State which has made the necessary references so that fresh legislation<br />
will not be necessary as and when it is decided to take advantage of the<br />
reference in any particular State. Although there is no legal necessity<br />
to impose any limitation, the bill provides that the commission shall<br />
not establish any service unless the Premier of the State in which the<br />
service is to be established has notified the Prime Minister in writing<br />
that he consents to the establishment of the service. This will ensure<br />
that the powers which have already been referred by four States will<br />
not be exercised without the express cons-ent of the States concerned.<br />
In addition, a further sub-clause imposes an obligation on the commission<br />
to pay from time to time amounts equivalent to the licence fees<br />
which would be payable under the law of the State if the service were<br />
operated by a person other than the commission. This provision has<br />
the effect of requiring the commission to pay the same licence-fees as<br />
private operators and meets the condition stipulated by the Premier<br />
of Queensland at the Premiers' Conference.<br />
" Another clause amends section 48 which provides that the commission<br />
must give 30 days' notice of intention to establish a service.<br />
territorial airline licences applied for by Trans-Australia Airlines in<br />
circumstances which will bring into operation section 46 of the act and<br />
thereby render inoperative any airline licence held by any other person<br />
by reason of the fact that the commission is providing an adequate<br />
service. The remaining clauses are mainly concerned with matters of drafting<br />
and in particular repeal those sections of the act declared invalid<br />
by the High Court in the Australian National Airways case."<br />

On 5th December, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />

cards by Commonwealth administrations for 1947."<br />
