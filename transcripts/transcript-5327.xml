-1 AUSTRALIA , L.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY 15 APRIL 1980<br />
NATIONAL MARINE SCIENCE CENTRE FOR TASMANIA<br />
The Commonwealth Government is to establish a Marine Science<br />
Centre at a cost of about $ 25 million including $ 9 million<br />
for a research vessel.<br />
The decision follows a special examination by the Callaghan<br />
Task Force.<br />
The move involves:<br />
tra.-s c t-he -omnonwealth Scientific and Industrial<br />
Rearoh Organi_-_-ion ( CSIRO) Division of Fisheries and<br />
Oce-ancgraphy a-present headquartered at Cronulla ( NSW)<br />
where i occ-n1es land on lease from the State:<br />
aczuisi'on cf a suitable site in Hobart and construction<br />
of -e CSIRO ,__-ari-ne Science Laboratories:<br />
construction of a multi-purpose oceanographic research<br />
vessel able to range around the Australian continent.<br />
The Centre is scheduled to be fully operational within the next<br />
five to seven years, with initial funds being committed next<br />
financial year.<br />
This is in line with already-announced Government initiatives<br />
to strengthen Commonwealth support for the fishing industryand<br />
to upgrade oceanographic research following the declaration of<br />
the 200 mile zone.<br />
o -S </p>
<p>The Marine Science Centre together with the transfer of the<br />
Antarctic Division of the Department of Science and the<br />
Environment will constitute in Tasmania a research establishment<br />
of international standing. As well as the purchase of a site,<br />
and the construction of laboratories, it will involve the transfer<br />
to Tasmania of 170 positions, with a significant effect on the<br />
employment opportunities for the Tasmanian economy.<br />
The decision marks another step in the progress that has been<br />
made in Commonwealth assistance to Tasmania through the Callaghan<br />
Task Force.<br />
The enquiry into the structure of industry and the employment<br />
situation in Tasmania was set up under Sir Bede Callaghan because<br />
of the Government's concern for Tasmania's special problems and<br />
because of the Government's commitment to meet these problems.<br />
The decision to chocse Tasmania as the base from which to undertake<br />
enhance.: research activ. ity in marine science work of national<br />
signific.:. C is w--I--founded.<br />
The exi_:-ig Cronulla site in inadequate, is 24 kilometres from<br />
a deep--a:-er berth, is held on lease due to expire in 2001.<br />
The Gover.-. ent drew cn any expert sources in determining the<br />
site for : he Centre including:<br />
0 the review of physical oceanography in Australia conducted<br />
by Professor H. Charnock, FRS, of the University of<br />
Southampton ( UK);<br />
the report to me by the Australian Science and Technology<br />
Council ( ASTEC) on marine sciences and technologies in<br />
Australia; and 3 </p>
<p>the Independent Inquiry into the CSIRO chaired by Professor<br />
A. J. Birch.<br />
As well-, the CSIRO Ocean Sciences Review Committee recommended<br />
to the Executive that the present Division of Fisheries and<br />
Oceanography be divided into two distinct research groups.<br />
One group would be involved in physical, chemical and biological<br />
oceanography, and ocean production programs. The other would<br />
become a fisheries research group examining aspects such as<br />
living resources, coastal ecology and physiological ecology.<br />
The CSIRO will implement these new research directions progressively<br />
as the marine Science Centre comes into operation.<br />
The new Centre will also enhance co-operation between the<br />
CSIRO an" the Antarctic Division of the Department of Science<br />
and the Environment, As well as collaborative research with the<br />
University of Tasw. ni.<br />
The CS.? s other -rine science research laboratories at Marmion<br />
near aa.: dr i Cle n near Brisbane will continue to operate.<br />
