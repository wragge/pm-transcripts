    <content><![CDATA[<p>I send my warm greetings to Muslims in Australia and all around the world who are celebrating Eid ul-Adha and performing the Hajj this year.</p>
<p>Muslim Australians are among the millions of pilgrims undertaking the annual Hajj, which honours the sacrifice and devotion of Abraham and serves as a reminder of the shared Abrahamic roots of Islam, Judaism and Christianity.</p>
<p>During the Eid ul-Adha holiday, Muslims of all ages and backgrounds commemorate the prophethood of Abraham through acts of charity and praying for those in need.</p>
<p>Australia is the most successful and harmonious multicultural society in the world.The Australian Muslim community plays an important role in strengthening our diverse social fabric.</p>
<p>I send my best wishes to everyone celebrating Eid ul-Adha.</p>
<p>Eid Mubarak and Hajj Mabrour.</p>
