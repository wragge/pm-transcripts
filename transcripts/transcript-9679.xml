STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
WORKING NATION JOBS IN SOUTH-WEST QUEENSLAND<br />
I am pleased to announce today a $ 12 million Working Nation Project to put<br />
1000 long-term unemployed people from South-VWest Queensland into jobs.<br />
The positions cover a diverse range of industries in the drought-stricken<br />
southern inland region from the Lockyer Valley west to the South Australian<br />
border. They include skilled and unskilled work, will last for six months, and could lead<br />
to permanent work.<br />
The project, known as " Partnerships Inc.", was funded under the New Work<br />
Opportunities scheme, an iifftive-6f -the Federal Government's Working<br />
Nation employment strategy.<br />
The proposal was submitted by the Southern Inland Queensland Area<br />
Consultative Committee ( ACC), a group of local business, community, union<br />
and government representatives chaired by Toowoomba solicitor Mr Pat<br />
Nunan.<br />
With the effects of the drought on this area, the prospects of business picking<br />
up quickly, without assistance, and giving work to the local unemployed are<br />
still some way down the track.<br />
The pattern of previous recoveries shows that the vast bulk of new jobs go to<br />
new entrants to the labour market, not the long-term unemployed.<br />
This project is a partnership of government, employers and the community<br />
working toward the goal of securing much needed jobs and recovery for this<br />
region and ensuring the long-term unemployed are equipped to compete for<br />
the new jobs.<br />
The placements include work with primary producers, drought landcare<br />
projects, tourist operators, government, the health-care industry and hospitality<br />
and retail employers. </p>
<p>2<br />
The project area includes Toowoomba, Warwick, Gatton, Crows Nest,<br />
Pittsworth, Clifton, Allora, Stanthorpe, Texas, Goondiwindi, St George,<br />
Dirranbandi, Dalby, Chinchilla, Miles, Roma, Taroom, Wandoan, Charleville,<br />
Cunnamulla, Quilpie and Tambo.<br />
The ACC is one of 62 similar independent groups set up across the country<br />
under Working Nation to generate local employment.<br />
Employers interested in participating in the scheme can contact ACC member<br />
Peter Nicol of Toowoomba Regional Development Corporation on ( 076)<br />
385977. Job seekers will be placed through the local CES.<br />
