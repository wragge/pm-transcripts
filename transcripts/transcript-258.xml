INTENSIFIED EXPORT DEVELOPMENT<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister.<br />
In relation to the economic measures announced last<br />
November, the Commonwealth Government made it plain that it would<br />
continue to give attention to the need to increase export<br />
income. To give still sharper focus to its activities in this<br />
field, the Government recently established a special Committee<br />
of Ministers, wader the chairmanship of thc Prime Minister, to<br />
carry through a comprehensive and continuous examination of<br />
possible measures to develop exports and to improve our overseas<br />
exchange position. The Committee consists of Mr. Menzies, Mr. McEwen,<br />
Mr. Holt, Senator Spooner, Mr. McMahon and Mr. Adermann.<br />
The Government welcomes the increasing public<br />
awareness of the need for a continuing and progressive stepping'<br />
up of the level of Australian export earnings if Australia is<br />
to maintain both a satisfactory rate ' of de velopment and a rising<br />
standard of living.<br />
Throughout recent years there has been evidence on<br />
many sides of a lively cntcrprise on the part of many in<br />
developing ncw kinds of exports, in opening up ncw markets and<br />
in raising thc level of cxport trade.<br />
For its part, the Government has, over the years,<br />
introduced a wide range of measures which have enhanced the<br />
opportunities of Australian producers to gain profitable export<br />
outlets. They include the negotiation of trade agreements with<br />
p most of our major trading partners; the very substantial<br />
strengthening of the Trade Commissioner Service; the<br />
organisation of special trade missions; considerable Government<br />
assistance in financing export publicity and promotion in the<br />
United Kingdom and ether important markets; the establishment<br />
of the Ex'nort Paymnents Insurance Corporation; taxation concessions<br />
to encourage primary production and mining; research aimed<br />
at increasing productivity in primary industries; and many<br />
others. These efforts by industry, commerce and Government<br />
have contributed to a substantial rise in the volume of experts<br />
during the 19501s. Comparing 1959/ 60 with the average of the<br />
la-st three years of the 1940' s, for examplo, the volume of<br />
exports increased by 39 Per cent. Minerals, metals and metal<br />
manufactures went up by no less than 154 per cent. Exports of </p>
<p>b 2.<br />
wool and sheepskins, our biggest export item were up by 35 per<br />
cent; lead and zinc by 37 per cent; and exports of coal rose<br />
from 57,000 tons to 1,100,000 tons.<br />
Similarly, great increases have been achieved in the<br />
value of exports to particular markets. Australian exports to<br />
Japan increased from œ 11 million to œ 135 million; exports to<br />
New Zealand, which include a wide and growing range of<br />
manufactured products, were up from œ 18 million to œ 54 million.<br />
Among the smaller markets, the development of new trade is<br />
reflected in the growth of exports to South Africa ( from œ 3.6<br />
million to œ 8.1 million); to the Philippines million to<br />
œ 4.9 million) and to Mexico million to œ 3.2 million).<br />
Those are very real achievements for a country which is only at<br />
D the beginning of its trading history with many of these markets.<br />
They have done much to offset the difficulties cf holding our<br />
position in some of our traditional markets.<br />
p Running counter to these fine performances in<br />
export production and the expansion of markets, there has booeen a<br />
persistent decline over some years in the average prices we have<br />
obtained for our exports. There has been no such decline indeed<br />
there has beeoon an increase in the prices we have had to pay<br />
for imports. This has meant that, despite our efforts to<br />
produce more goods for sale overseas and find outlets for<br />
them, we tend continually to fall short of earning enough<br />
b abroad to pay for the increasing amnount of imports our growing<br />
economy requires. Since prices of both exports and imports are<br />
almost entirely beyond our control there is practically<br />
D nothing we can do to remedy this aspect of the position. Our<br />
only resource is to produce still more for export and sell it<br />
wherever we can. We must produce, on competitive terms, mere<br />
of our established lines of exports and more of such now<br />
commodities as we find to be saleable overseas; and we must<br />
search out openings for the sale of these products wherever<br />
they can be found.<br />
The Government is convinced that much more can be<br />
done by Government and industry alike, and particularly<br />
by co-operation between Government and industry to attain the<br />
necessary rate of export expansion. That there are many<br />
obstacles has to be recognised. For many rural exports, market<br />
opportunities and prices are influenced by the practices of<br />
overseas Governments and by international price fluctuations </p>
<p>rather than by the competitive ability of Australian producers.<br />
Breaking into new markets often involves heavy establishment<br />
costs which are all the more onerous for Australian exporters<br />
because of their geographical distance from main markets and<br />
the rather thin spread of their products over many markets.<br />
But we must try to overcome these and other difficulties.<br />
We should not place too much reliance on an upturn in export price<br />
levels. A major factor in export capacity and performance<br />
generally is, of course, the state of the internal economy<br />
not only through the effct-s on comparative cost levels but<br />
also through the impact w. hich internal demand makes, directly<br />
or indirectly, upon ihe volume of goods available for export.<br />
The measures which the Government has put in train recently<br />
demonstrate its determination to help the competitive -position<br />
of Australian experts.<br />
The special Committee of Ministers is closely<br />
examining particular indus-tries or sections of industry.<br />
The Special Position of Steoel<br />
In the last ten years the steel industry has roughly<br />
doubled its output. But this has been insufficient to keep up<br />
with the growing Australian demand.<br />
During the period we have achieved some exports, at<br />
times on a significant scale, but at times there have also been<br />
very he~ avy imports of the kinds of steel made in Australia. The<br />
net cost in foreign exchange of all iron and steel imports,<br />
after allowing for exportlus, has exceeded œ 220 million in the<br />
last ten years, A considerablo contribution to the bridging of the<br />
gap in our ba-lance of payments could flow from taking fuller<br />
advantage of the favourable competitive position we have in the<br />
production of steel. Our resources of iron ore and coal can<br />
certainly support a further substantial development of the steel<br />
industry. We have high grade coal available on an internationally<br />
competitive basis. The potential of our steel industry to bring<br />
about a r: * duc-t'ion in import outlays and an increase in exports<br />
cannot therefore be ignored.<br />
The Government receg-nises that there are difficulties<br />
in the way of vcry rapid expansion of steel production but it<br />
will enter into discussions with th.; industry with a view to<br />
examining how Australia might become a major and continuing<br />
net exporter of steel. </p>
<p>4.<br />
Iron Ore The possibilities of more fully exploiting our<br />
resources of minerals are being closely examined. As announced<br />
by the Minister for National Development on 2nd Dccember,. the<br />
Gcvernnmnt has decided to pernit the export of iron ore under<br />
certain conditions which will ensure that the interests of<br />
Australian industry arc fully safeguarded. This decision is<br />
expected to proc-ote intensified oxploration for iron ore<br />
reserves and to produce important new exports.<br />
Export Facilities The Connitteo is studying a number of possible ways,<br />
not confined to traditional or orthodox :. easurcs, of helping<br />
Australian exporters overcooe thuir very real disadvantages of<br />
distances fron markets, low export lack of export<br />
experience and so on. Along with other possibilities, the<br />
Cocnittee is examining whether increased expert business could<br />
be obtained by Gcvernnont co-operation or assistance in such<br />
natters as increased trade publicity and advertising abroad;<br />
market surveys; help in tendering for overseas contracts; and<br />
possible ways and Lceans of warehousing Australian goods in<br />
important overseas rmarkets to enable thoe to be offered for<br />
sale from stock. In assessing the worth and practicability of<br />
measures of this kind, Ministers are calling on the conmmrcial<br />
judgaont and the expert advice available to then fron industry<br />
and comnnrcc. They expect that the success of any measurcs<br />
would depend heavily on enthusiastic support from industry and<br />
conmerce. In respct cf a numbor of proposals of this kind<br />
and many other aspects of export, the Expert Developnont<br />
Council and the Manufacturing Industries Advis'ory Council have<br />
done a groat deal of constructive work since their establishmont<br />
two years ago. The Goverrnnnt's current endeavours have boon<br />
discussed with the Chairman of those two bodies, and the<br />
G-vernnent is confident of their continuing help and co-operation.<br />
Taxation iiuch has been said about taxation in relation to<br />
exports. The Governnent will carefully examinc proposals for<br />
anonding sono aspects of taxation if they can be shown to offer<br />
real prospects of putting Australian industries into a better<br />
position to earn substantially increased export income or to<br />
develop new lines of export, and if they can be accomolished </p>
<p>within manageable limnits. It will be necessary, of course, to<br />
ensure that such proposals do not conflict with our international<br />
obligations. A proposal relating to taxation, put forward by the<br />
Export Developnment Council, is now being studied at the<br />
Departmental level.<br />
Export Franchises Ministers have also noted the extent to which<br />
restrictive export franchises limit or preclude Australian<br />
exoorts. In view of our need to earn more foreign exchange,<br />
many restrictive export franchises are clearly not in the<br />
O national interest.<br />
S The Government expects that responsible management<br />
of overseas concerns will recognise that it is in their own<br />
interests, as well as in the interest of the Australian<br />
S econo: Iy as a whole, that Australian enterprises be permitted<br />
and assisted to compete freely in export markets. Manufacturing<br />
industry would thereby be helped towards making a contribution<br />
by way of export earnings that is more comensurate with its<br />
own very large requirements of imports of plant and materials,<br />
Tourism International tourism has rapidly emerged as one of<br />
the great foreign exchange earners for many countries.<br />
S Ministers arc satisfied that tourism could make a greater<br />
contribution to Australia's earnings of foreign exchange,<br />
The Government has therefore decided to take a more<br />
I active role in overseas promotion of tourist travel to<br />
Australia. It will work closely with the State Governments<br />
which have important interests in this field.<br />
The Government will continue its support of the<br />
Australian National Travel Association which it has asked to<br />
submit ideas for the development of this trade. It has<br />
approved an immediate additional grant to A. N. T. A. to enable<br />
it to accelerate some of its existing plans. It will also<br />
ensure that full benefits to tourist promotion are obtained<br />
from trade and general publicity overseas and from the<br />
facilities available in Government offices abroad.<br />
Insurance of Export Payments<br />
A numiber of organisations concerned with exports<br />
have supported a proposal to provide export payments insurance </p>
<p>6.<br />
cover for sone transactions which are considered to be in the<br />
national interest, but would be beyond the present scope of the<br />
Export Payncnts Insurance Corporation. Similar facilities are<br />
available to exporters in a nunibor of countries, including the<br />
United Kingdon and Canada.<br />
The Govern. ient has decided to introduce legislation<br />
in the next sittings of Parliarent to a-iond the Export<br />
Payments Insurance Corporation Act to provide means for the<br />
Connonwcalth Govcrnent to underwrite certain types of<br />
transaction through the Export Paynents Insurance Corporation<br />
in cases where the Govern. nt is satisfied that this would be<br />
in the national interest.<br />
The Cornnittco of Ministers does not envisage<br />
spectacular short-tern results. Prinary products pastoral,<br />
agricultural and mineral will continue to provide the bulk<br />
Sof our export incone for nany years ahead. But we have strong<br />
hopes that manufacturing industry will be able to do ruch nore<br />
to increase exports. In fields appropriate to Government action,<br />
the Governnent, apart fron all it has done in the past, is now<br />
making a thorough-going investigation of the neans by<br />
which our external trading position might be improved. What<br />
is required is a constructive effort to find measures which will<br />
:. ako a real and lasting contribution. The Government is<br />
confident that, with the assistance and co-operation of private<br />
enterprise, nuch more could be achieved in this direction.<br />
Canberra. 3rd January, 1961. </p>
