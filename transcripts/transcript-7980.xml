TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, AWA DEFENCE INDUSTRIES,<br />
ADELAIDE, 20 MARCH 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, how reasonable is it to<br />
expect a fall of two percent in interest rates after the<br />
election? PM: Well, if you look at what I said, the context I was,<br />
the two percent came up in terms of some reference I'd<br />
seen to, in going through a whole lot of media in the<br />
last few hours of some comment by Mr Howard that he'd<br />
talked about two percent. You'll notice that I was<br />
reluctant myself to predict it and I, I don't want to say<br />
precisely because I've said today and before today that<br />
the actual fall, the degree of the fall, will be<br />
determined by the, by the banks. The important thing<br />
that I have been saying and that Mr Keating has been<br />
saying is that we've got the policies in place upon which<br />
the banking industry is able to say that there will be a<br />
fall. The actual amount of the fall will be a matter for<br />
the banks and the banking system to decide.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you say that two percent was a<br />
reasonable PM: Well that arose in the context of I'd seen Mr<br />
Howard was talking about two percent. He'd been asked<br />
about what the candidate in the Northern Territory had<br />
been saying and he, he said two percent. Now if he wants<br />
to say it, I'm saying, well it might be reasonable. My<br />
own consistent position is I'm not going to put a figure<br />
on it. What I am saying is the clear alternative that<br />
the Australian people have next Saturday, it's this<br />
that under our policies interest rates must fall and are<br />
seen by the banking industries and necessarily falling.<br />
That's one reality. The other reality is the<br />
inevitability of an interest rate rise under the policies<br />
of the Opposition which contain two things which would<br />
bring about an interest rate rise. Firstly, a wages<br />
explosion and, secondly, a deliberate dissipation of the<br />
budget surplus.<br />
JOURNALIST: Over what, over what period of time would<br />
two percent be a reasonable fall, Mr Hawke? Three years<br />
or a matter of weeks after the election </p>
<p>PM: I wouldn't think a matter of weeks.<br />
JOURNALIST: Three years?<br />
PM: I'm not, you can ask all the questions you like, but<br />
what I'm<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, on another issue<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Andrew Peacock has accused you of injecting<br />
racism into the MFP debate.<br />
PM: Well, Mr Peacock, unfortunately, has got desperate<br />
in the last few days. All the records will show the<br />
untruth of that assertion. I would not, have never,<br />
accused Mr Peacock of racism because I only make charges<br />
if I think they are warranted. I don't think a charge of<br />
racism against Mr Peacock is warranted. I've made a<br />
serious charge against him which is not the charge of<br />
racism and that is the charge that he has been<br />
adventuristic and dangerously irresponsible in his<br />
position in regard to the Multi Function Polis. What Mr<br />
Peacock has to answer is a very simple position. Why was<br />
it that last week, last week, in the Sydney Morning<br />
Herald in explaining the position of the Opposition on<br />
the Multi Function Polis, this was the word, these were<br />
the words, quote the proposal, that is the proposal for<br />
the MFP is unique for Australia and deserves extensive<br />
consideration. Now that was the position last week, then<br />
last Thursday night, without consultation with the<br />
Minister involved, Mr Howard, who himself had just said<br />
that the proposal was worthy of consideration and should<br />
not sink in a sea of hostility without any consultation<br />
a decision was made on Thursday night and that there<br />
wouldn't be any processing of this under a coalition<br />
government. This has appalled his own colleagues, it has<br />
appalled the business community in this country, it has<br />
appalled the business community in Japan.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on that issue Mr Peacock says he<br />
has a better record on race than you because, as ACTU<br />
President, you opposed him as Foreign Minister on the<br />
issue of Indo Chinese refugees coming to Australia.<br />
PM: Well see, Mr Peacock can't get anything right. He<br />
is totally desperate in this issue. He goes back to a<br />
point not at which I or the Labor movement opposed the,<br />
that Australia should offer haven to refugees from Indo<br />
China. I expressed a concern at the way in which people<br />
were just being able to land without any channelling<br />
through Government of the way in which they came. And<br />
that was a matter of concern to all Australians including<br />
Hawke who has, I would suggest of any person in public<br />
life, the most impeccable record going back to my days at<br />
university on this issue. No-one can touch Hawke on this </p>
<p>issue. Now I'm sorry that Mr Peacock has to go, has to<br />
get into this because I don't accuse him of racism<br />
never have and never would because there is no evidence<br />
available to me, no evidence at all, that would sustain a<br />
charge of racism against Mr Peacock. And so I don't make<br />
it, never have, but I make the serious charge of<br />
irresponsible adventurism in this matter and you have the<br />
position where his, the President of his own Party is<br />
clearly appalled by this because Mr Elliott has taken a<br />
totally different position on this, his own Minister, Mr<br />
Howard, just a week before made it quite clear what his<br />
position was, so what Mr Peacock has succeeded in doing<br />
in this final week of the campaign is yet again<br />
highlighting the fact which has been true, right<br />
throughout the campaign, that you have an Opposition<br />
which is fundamentally divided on serious issues. They<br />
cannot speak with one voice. As I said at the beginning<br />
of this campaign, you've got a coalition which can't<br />
govern itself and therefore, as I've said from the<br />
beginning of this campaign, absolutely unable to govern<br />
this country.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Beg you pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: poll showing any influence over the MFP<br />
issue?<br />
PM: Not that I'm aware of and, let me say that, as I've<br />
said in the Parliament and I've said right throughout my<br />
public life, polls will not determine my attitude on<br />
issues like this.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke in the Vietnamese language<br />
newspapers, the, the advertisements being run by the<br />
Labor Party talking about darkest plots by conservatives.<br />
To whom is that referring?<br />
PM: Well on that, that phrase there was put in without<br />
my authorisation and I have a letter and you can get it<br />
from my people, a letter from the person who actually put<br />
that out over my name, in which it's indicated that that<br />
sentence was put in by them and without any authorisation<br />
from me. I don't go in for that sort of caper.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you embarrassed by that?<br />
PM: Well, I, I Just repudiate the statement. I have<br />
done. It was put in without my authority. It's been<br />
made quite clear and you can see the letter to that<br />
effect. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister<br />
PM: Yes. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: If Mr Peacock isn't a racist himself is he<br />
trying to tap the certain racist element within elements<br />
of Australian society?<br />
PM: What Mr Peacock has done is to repudiate the<br />
position of his own Party a week before, the position of<br />
his own Party the week, as I've quoted, let me repeat it<br />
that the proposal is unique for Australia and deserves<br />
extensive consideration. His own Minister responsible,<br />
Mr Howard, has said it was a worthy proposal and<br />
shouldn't sink in a sea of hostility. Now he talks to<br />
two or three people, Mr Peacock talks to two or three<br />
people and not including the Minister responsible, and<br />
changes that position against the position of his Party,<br />
against the position of the President of the Party,<br />
against the position of the Shadow Minister. Now he, I<br />
didn't issue his Press release, he said that he didn't<br />
like the idea of an enclave. Now why did he say this<br />
when the principles set down under which the committee is<br />
operating makes it explicit that there shall be no<br />
enclave. They are looking at a proposal calculated to<br />
bring to Australia what Australia needs, to bring in a<br />
concentrated form, the best technology from Japan, from<br />
Europe, from the United States, to marry the best<br />
available technology from overseas with a highly trained<br />
and highly skilled Australian workforce so that we will<br />
put Australia for the future in the best possible<br />
position to tackle the challenge of the future to make<br />
us better able to export manufactured goods and services.<br />
Now that's what it's about, it's what has been accepted<br />
before by the Opposition and its Shadow Minister, by Mr<br />
Greiner, by the Federal President of the Liberal Party.<br />
Now, now, what they are about in talking about an enclave<br />
I don't know because the discussions were only going on<br />
with the Japanese. That's what the discussion was about,<br />
but in the context of bringing everyone to the, to<br />
Australia from all these other areas, but that's what<br />
they've done in a situation where they know that the nine<br />
principles deliberately included a proposition that there<br />
shall be no enclave and he puts out his opposition on the<br />
basis that he's opposed to enclaves when enclaves were<br />
not on.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: From one of your comments this morning you<br />
seemed quite resigned to the fact the vote for the minor<br />
parties could be<br />
PM: I don't know that it will be twenty percent, but what<br />
I've said, Maxine, is that I think the vote for the nonmajor<br />
parties will be higher in this election than it has<br />
been before and I've said, you know, since the campaign<br />
started, that this to a considerable extent will be a<br />
function of a political fact, here in this country and<br />
around the world. That is, that there has been a growing </p>
<p>interest in environmental matters and I make the point<br />
again that for those for whom the environment is the<br />
major issue and they want to express their concern by a<br />
primary vote, either for the Democrats or for a Green<br />
candidate, then the logic of their position demands that<br />
their effective preference vote must go to the Labor<br />
Party because it's the Labor Party or the coalition which<br />
will form Government and the record of Labor is, as the<br />
Australian Conservation Foundation and the Wilderness<br />
Society says, head and shoulders above that of the<br />
Opposition. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, how much damage will the MFP<br />
debate do to our relations with Japan.<br />
PM: Well, I can't measure that. Obviously they've been<br />
hurt by it which is understandable. I believe we're<br />
going to win the election and we will responsibly, with<br />
the cooperation of the Will Bailey's of the ANZ, the John<br />
Elliott's, with the cooperation of people like that as<br />
well as the bureaucrats and the governments, we'll go<br />
ahead with doing what was being done and that was<br />
calculating how best we can secure the future of<br />
Australia by bringing to this country the best technology<br />
available from overseas, including Japan, to marry that<br />
best technology with our trained workforce and that's<br />
what this exercise is about and any political leader who,<br />
for opportunistic reasons, would prejudice that process<br />
is, as has been said in one major newspaper, not worthy<br />
of being in the Lodge.<br />
ends </p>
