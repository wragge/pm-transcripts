<p> media coverage</p>
<p>E&amp;OE..........................................................................................</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Welcome Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you Ian, it's good to be back.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>And it's nice to be talking to you once again.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Different location, same face, same personality.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Just a little bit ruddier, a little bit rounder of girth, but still the</p>
<p> same person lurking deep inside there. Now I invited listeners earlier</p>
<p> in the week to send us through by fax, by email by letter, some questions</p>
<p> to put to you. I pointed out that they could be as blunt as they like</p>
<p> but keep a civil tongue in their head or a civil pen on the paper which</p>
<p> they have generally done. And we're going to get through as many</p>
<p> questions as we possibly could. So I'll ask you to be as succinct</p>
<p> as you can with the answers this morning. Firstly a comment on probably</p>
<p> the big news of the day, and you would have seen the comment in the Sydney</p>
<p> Morning Herald by an old mate of yours Â Margo Kingston. Is the Prime</p>
<p> Minister blind or merely a hypocrite? Are you blind or a hypocrite?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Neither. I think she's talking about mandatory sentencing.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>She is.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well our position on that is that criminal law has traditionally been</p>
<p> an area of State responsibility.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Is that ducking it a bit [inaudible] say that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No it is not ducking it. I mean there are many things that States do</p>
<p> I don't like. I mean I don't agree with heroin injecting rooms.</p>
<p> But unless those are clearly in breach of an existing federal law I don't</p>
<p> favour using the foreign affairs power to overturn what a State's</p>
<p> deciding to do. I think most Australians take the view that whatever attitude</p>
<p> they may have on things like mandatory sentencing, or heroin injecting</p>
<p> rooms, they are things that ought to be resolved by Australians in Australia.</p>
<p> And to resort in a legalistic way to international conventions in relation</p>
<p> to those issues for federal governments to do that in order to overturn</p>
<p> the decisions of State governments, I believe is upsetting the federal</p>
<p> balance.</p>
<p>Now my critics, including Margo Kingston, will immediately say well what</p>
<p> about euthanasia. You allowed the federal parliament to override the views</p>
<p> of the Northern Territory. Well we didn't use the external affairs</p>
<p> power there, we used a clause in the Commonwealth Constitution which allows</p>
<p> federal parliament to override territories. You can't do that in</p>
<p> relation to the States. The other point I'd make is that that was</p>
<p> a conscience vote. That was a free vote issue. And in any event the Northern</p>
<p> Territory was setting a national benchmark, starting something new at</p>
<p> a national level by the law that it proposed to introduce. And many people</p>
<p> felt that if that law was going to be changed it oughtn't be driven</p>
<p> by the smallest, population wise, the smallest jurisdiction in Australia.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Well when Kofi Annan was here in Australia just in recent days you had</p>
<p> an opportunity to talk to him. I understand you didn't talk to him</p>
<p> about mandatory sentencing laws. In fact it didn't come up. And yet</p>
<p> we now learn that clearly Kim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition did.</p>
<p> And he has asked the United Nations to intervene. Do you take a dim view</p>
<p> of the Opposition Leader doing that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look, I just take the view that we are mature enough to make decisions</p>
<p> on these matters ourselves full stop. Whether it's done by the State</p>
<p> parliament or the federal parliament, most Australians and I note here</p>
<p> in Western Australia that Geoff Gallop, Kim Beazley's Labor colleague,</p>
<p> has in effect told Mr Beazley to stay out of the issue.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>But he's playing for a Western Australian audience.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well yeah. I mean I've got to take a view that I think is good from</p>
<p> a national perspective. I mean I personally doubt the value of mandatory</p>
<p> sentencing laws. I personally doubt them. There are a lot of things States</p>
<p> do I don't agree with. I personally doubt.....I'm strongly</p>
<p> opposed to heroin injecting rooms.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Are you worried though that this might effect our reputation internationally.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don't.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Mary Robinson is a woman who commands a lot of respect.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well just because she's carrying an investigation....I mean we</p>
<p> shouldn't sort of so lack confidence in our own judgement as a people</p>
<p> and as a nation that every time somebody breathes the name of an international</p>
<p> figure we have to automatically assume that what we are doing is wrong.</p>
<p> Now it is for the people of Western Australia in the end to decide whether</p>
<p> they like mandatory sentencing laws. Asking me as an individual I personally</p>
<p> doubt the value of them. I doubt the value of them particularly in relation</p>
<p> to people under the age of 18. Do I think we should use our external affairs</p>
<p> power to overturn a law enacted by the Western Australian government with</p>
<p> the support of the Western Australian Labor Opposition, no I don't.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Right. Okay we'll move on because I didn't want to get bogged</p>
<p> down on that one this morning even though it is obviously leading the</p>
<p> news bulletins today. From our listeners now. From Andy in Beachbrough,</p>
<p> and I'll just identify people in that regard if that's okay.</p>
<p> ÂPrime Minister, you've had a lot to say in recent years about</p>
<p> the unfair tax burden on single income families. How then is it fair that</p>
<p> a family with one $50,000 income will pay the Timor levy, but a family</p>
<p> with two or more $49,000 incomes will not pay a cent towards it?'</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that would be a valid criticism if we had not taken special measures</p>
<p> in not only our 1996 election policy, but also in the tax plan, to give</p>
<p> additional benefits to single income families, and we have done that.</p>
<p> Single income families with one child under five years will effectively</p>
<p> after the 1st of July have close to two tax free thresholds.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Is it still enough? Do you think it's gone far enough?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well no, well the answer in isolation is no it's not. It's</p>
<p> never enough in any of these areas.</p>
<p> CAMERON:</p>
<p> Well nothings ever enough.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No exactly. But we are the first government to reverse the trend against</p>
<p> single income families and I would like to do more.</p>
<p> CAMERON:</p>
<p> Do you recognise that they are getting a bit of a rough deal at the</p>
<p> moment?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> No no, look, if we hadn't have taken these other measures it would</p>
<p> be a valid criticism. But we do have a system in this country where you</p>
<p> do recognise that each person is an individual, and that if somebody goes</p>
<p> out, works, whether they're married to somebody or not.....</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>That is their right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is their right. I mean, I think people should have a choice and</p>
<p> that is why I have tried to give more help to single income families.</p>
<p> And I repeat Â I'm the first Prime Minister in 30 years to really</p>
<p> reverse the trend against single income families. I would like to do more,</p>
<p> and I hope I can. But I'm not promising anything at the current time.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Do you feel this family in Beachbrough will be markedly better off after</p>
<p> July 1st, a single income family earning over $50,000?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well if they have children, particularly if they have children under</p>
<p> the age of 5, yes they'll be significantly better off. I mean I think</p>
<p> the average family, that is with an income around the $40,000 mark is</p>
<p> going to be about $47 a week better off as a result of the tax package.</p>
<p> $47 a week. And I'm very grateful that Mr Beazley over the last few</p>
<p> days by focusing on his plans about income tax have drawn the public's</p>
<p> attention again to the fact that part of the tax plan, a big part of it,</p>
<p> is to cut income tax.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p> Now Mrs Lindsay Smith has written to say Â ÂI have two children</p>
<p> aged 20 and 23. On their wages there is no way they can afford private</p>
<p> health cover yet their employer is paying compulsory super for them which</p>
<p> they'll not benefit from for 35 to 40 years. Would it not make sense</p>
<p> for employers to pay compulsory health cover for employees, say up to</p>
<p> age 30, and then super from age 30? Surely that would ease the burden</p>
<p> on the public health service without effecting the super entitlements</p>
<p> of young people in 35 years time. It would also lessen the financial burden</p>
<p> on employers and therefore reduce youth employment' What do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well I can understand that argument and a lot of people advance it.</p>
<p> I guess the reservation that a lot would have about it Ian is that the</p>
<p> question of whether you have private health insurance or not should be</p>
<p> your decision, and should not be a decision forced on you effectively</p>
<p> by the government. We would like to encourage you to do it, and I encourage</p>
<p> all of your listeners to take out private health insurance.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>But in this case these kids can't afford it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well when they say they can't afford it, I mean I don't know</p>
<p> their incomes. It may be that they put a greater priority on something</p>
<p> else. I don't know. I mean without knowing what their incomes are</p>
<p> it's very hard to make that kind of judgement.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>But [inaudible] very low incomes it would be hard.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I know young people who are earning less than $20,000 a year who've</p>
<p> got private health insurance.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p> What, they starve for the rest of the week?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well I don't know. But I mean, these things are all a matter of</p>
<p> choice. A lot of retired people, a lot of pensioners have private health</p>
<p> insurance on very low incomes.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p> So that scheme would not be workable as far as ......?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No no. Look, you could do something like that but I'm not sure as</p>
<p> a matter of principle you should force people to take out private health</p>
<p> insurance. You should encourage them to. You should have some, I suppose,</p>
<p> carrots and sticks to make sure they do. But I think if you take the quantum</p>
<p> leap and say it's exactly the same as superannuation, I don't</p>
<p> know. I mean it's something that there should be more debate about.</p>
<p> I don't say that it's the craziest idea I've heard. But</p>
<p> it's not something we have on our desk at the moment.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Well Fred and Ella Dickenson, I suspect these are pensioners. ÂWhy</p>
<p> will the GST be imposed on site fees paid by residents of manufactured</p>
<p> homes, mobile homes or caravans in permanent situations? Many Australians</p>
<p> live in this kind of accommodation, many of these home owners are retirees</p>
<p> and pensioners who have remained in the same location for many years.</p>
<p> Your government has said that rent on houses and flats will be GST free.</p>
<p> The situation for the above residents is unclear. [inaudible].'</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the situation for the above residents is that it will be optional.</p>
<p> The operator of the park can either have a 5% GST and claim back all of</p>
<p> the GST that he's paid on his inputs to run his business. Or alternatively</p>
<p> there's, he can what is called input tax, and in other words not</p>
<p> charge the GST, but not get back his inputs. Now as far as the tenant</p>
<p> is concerned, as far as those two people are concerned.....</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p> Fred and Ella.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>......Fred and Ella are concerned, their financial position either</p>
<p> way will roughly be the same.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p> So they shouldn't be [inaudible]?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> They'll be no worse off under what we've proposed because</p>
<p> if the landlord or the operator elects to take the input taxing route</p>
<p> then I think that might be reflected in the rent, and the reflection in</p>
<p> the rent would be about the same as the 5% GST.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>There's been a lot of confusion that's gone on with the way</p>
<p> pensioners will be affected after the 1st of July because I</p>
<p> know there was a compensation package, but after as one of my colleagues</p>
<p> calls her Mother Meg, has had a bit of a meddle around in there. Will</p>
<p> that be watered down?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that compensation package has been improved. The position of pensioners</p>
<p> will be totally protected and their pension will go up up-front by 4 per</p>
<p> cent and there'll be a guarantee, and there is a guarantee in the</p>
<p> legislation, that the value of the pension will be tied to movements in</p>
<p> average earning so it won't be, the increase won't be eroded</p>
<p> over time. There's a savings bonus. There's increases in income</p>
<p> earning limits. There's a whole range of things.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>So you honestly believe and feel there should be an over, it's an</p>
<p> over-compensation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is, it is a, on the advice to us it's an over-compensation and</p>
<p> I'm pleased about that. I want that to be the case. I want retired</p>
<p> people to understand that they would be fully protected. That this a good</p>
<p> plan for the whole country and it's a plan that takes account of</p>
<p> their special position.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Whilst we're on the subject of the GST Annette has written to say</p>
<p> "could you tell me how the GST is going to help people on low incomes,</p>
<p> as I feel the rich will get richer and the poor poorer. On my low income</p>
<p> I'm worried it's going to hit me a lot as it's going to</p>
<p> effect foods to other basic essential needs".</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No fresh food is essentially not subject to the GST.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>It's clear of it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's right. And if she's earning any income at all and paying</p>
<p> tax she'll get a tax cut. If she is, and I don't know whether</p>
<p> she has a family or not?</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But there are increases in the income earning limits in relation to the</p>
<p> family allowance supplements. There are increases in family allowance,</p>
<p> the family benefits. There are special additional loadings in the tax</p>
<p> system in relation to family responsibilities. And without knowing her</p>
<p> income, whether she has children and all those sorts of things, it's</p>
<p> very hard to give an exact figure. But we have been quite meticulous in</p>
<p> compiling this package and taking account of the position of low income</p>
<p> people. We don't want to hurt them. We want to help them.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>In the days when I used to try and explain the GST it was always my view,</p>
<p> and my sincerely held view, that it was those in the community who had</p>
<p> most brass and the big spenders are the ones who are going to be paying</p>
<p> the tax.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there's one huge area now that's not subject to a GST</p>
<p> that will be and that is eating out at a restaurant. And the people with</p>
<p> large incomes, habitually, eat more frequently at expensive restaurants</p>
<p> and they will have to pay a GST on that. They will have to pay a GST on</p>
<p> a lot of, a whole lot of other things that they use. Now, when you bear</p>
<p> in mind that the tax cuts have been designed in the main to assist lower</p>
<p> and middle income earners, I think people will find that it's a very</p>
<p> fair package. I mean 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers, as a result</p>
<p> of this plan, will be on a top marginal rate of no more than 30 cents</p>
<p> in the dollar.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Changing the subject now entirely and sorry to be pushing you along like</p>
<p> this. We had a caller very early this morning who is asking me, and welcoming</p>
<p> the idea of the fact that our troops should be recognised for the marvelous</p>
<p> job they did in East Timor and a welcome home. What about the troops who</p>
<p> are still there? Are we tending to perhaps overlook them because there's</p>
<p> still a large number there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no. We will recognise their contribution in an appropriate way. We</p>
<p> are keeping about 1500 to 2000 there as part of the United Nations blue</p>
<p> helmet force. But you can hardly do anything about them until they actually</p>
<p> come back.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Until they come home eventually. And we just had hot off the press the</p>
<p> Uniting Church has announced that Australia's first legal heroin</p>
<p> injecting room will be located at a former Kings Cross pinball parlour</p>
<p> at 66 Darlinghurst Road and it's been approved by the New South Wales</p>
<p> Police Commissioner, Peter Ryan, the New South Wales Health Department</p>
<p> Director General. Do you have a reaction to that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes well I don't...now this is a decision that the New South</p>
<p> Wales...</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>You've never agreed with it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don't agree with it now and I think as time goes by it will</p>
<p> not be seen as making a contribution, a positive contribution, but it's</p>
<p> a decision of the New South Wales Government and the New South Wales Police.</p>
<p> They are entitled to take that decision if they believe that that's</p>
<p> good policy. We have to get to a maturity in this country in relation</p>
<p> to who's responsible for what. And this proposition that every time</p>
<p> something happens it's got to be immediately either certified by</p>
<p> the Prime Minister or the Federal Government or overturned by the Prime</p>
<p> Minister or the Federal Government is immature. We live in a federation</p>
<p> and the States have got responsibilities and we've got ours.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>We've only got a couple of minutes left and I'll try to get</p>
<p> through what I've got remaining here but the cost of a beer in the</p>
<p> pub and this is something</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Something over the counter will go up by 7 per cent.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>By 7 per cent. Yep. But we were always told and I've got this from</p>
<p> reliable information and I've checked it. It would be around 1 to</p>
<p> 2 per cent.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No you were told and I remember being asked this question in the context</p>
<p> of a beer being bought and a packaged beer being bought out of a bottle</p>
<p> shop and it will go up by a much lesser amount because there's no</p>
<p> service component in it.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And we never represented that the 1.9 per cent increase applied to draught</p>
<p> beer across the counter. I certainly didn't. I was asked, I remember</p>
<p> that question, I was asked on the John Laws programme somebody from the</p>
<p> Kempsey bottle shop.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>So you remember that vividly.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I remember very vividly and the bottle shop. Now the reasons, the explanation,</p>
<p> is very simple. The explanation is that if you buy a slab of beer, a packaged</p>
<p> beer, from a bottle shop there's no service component and there is</p>
<p> the removal of some embedded wholesale sales tax.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Over the bar.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Over the bar because there's a service component it's dearer.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>How do you feel about the way that you've had a fairly vicious attack</p>
<p> made on yourself by certain members of the press in Australia and I'd</p>
<p> say a certain family owning some press, right down to really tacky sort</p>
<p> of stuff being brought up that your son might have been at a party that</p>
<p> something happened at last year. Does that affect you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that particular article did annoy me, upset me and it annoyed my</p>
<p> family, but my son sort of moved on and I don't particularly for</p>
<p> his sake want to go over it.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But my view is that I treat each individual news story and news coverage</p>
<p> and individual journalists and their attitude, I treat them on the merits</p>
<p> and I've been critical of the changed attitude of some newspapers</p>
<p> in relation to tax reform in recent months, just as I've on occasions</p>
<p> been critical of the ABC for example.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>That hasn't escaped your attention obviously.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Now you would know that Paul Murray, former editor of the West Australian,</p>
<p> is taking over here on the morning programme in a couple of weeks time,</p>
<p> would you consider talking to him on a fortnightly basis do you reckon?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I guess that's a matter for him to put to me. I wish him well</p>
<p> but that is I guess a matter that should be discussed between him and</p>
<p> my press secretary.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Okay well if you won't talk to him surely you'll talk to me</p>
<p> again sometime.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Ian I'm always ready to talk to you.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Thank you Prime Minister we appreciate your time in coming in this morning.</p>
<p> Enjoy the rest of your stay in Western Australia and a safe trip home.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's always great to be in the West.</p>
<p>(Ends)</p>
