    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a year of outstanding achievement by Australian writers, today the Government announces the 2014 Prime Ministerâs Literary Awards shortlists.</p>
<p>These awards recognise the role Australian writers play in enlightening and entertaining us, reflecting on our history and taking our stories to the world.</p>
<p>Australiaâs writers are ambassadors for our stories and our cultural life and experience.</p>
<p>The 2014 shortlists feature some of Australiaâs most significant and recognised writers, as well as gifted debut authors across all six award categories: fiction, poetry, non-fiction, Australian history, young adult fiction and childrenâs fiction.</p>
<p>The shortlists span many genres, styles and subjects, reflecting on contemporary Australian life, significant moments in Australian and world history as well as gripping readers with fictional stories that captivate young and old readers alike.</p>
<p>These thirty books have become part of the contemporary Australian literary canon.</p>
<p>A number of the shortlisted books reflect on World War One and the Anzac story â the crucible in which the Australian identity was forged. These works are essential resources to remembering the tide of events that shaped our nation and that still cast a shadow over the wider world.</p>
