    <content><![CDATA[<p>PM: Any questions and then I'll, you all better be terrified by me hopping into the earth moving equipment, so I suggest you stand back a safe distance and just count your blessings and pray.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: (inaudible)</p>
<p>PM: The Expressway project is to commence next year so we would hope to have it up and running obviously as soon as possible. This is a massive investment; $1.65 billion. We've got to make sure that it's all ready and primed to go but it will be underway as soon as possible, that's the scheduled commencement date.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, why was this project more important than road and rail projects in Sydney?</p>
<p>PM: Well what we've done through the Infrastructure Australia process is go through all of the projects which have been put forward from the various States across the country, all those which have been supported through Infrastructure Australia in the case of NSW have been funded. We're also engaged in some solid pre-construction analysis and work when it comes to Sydney Metro. That's got a little way to go and we intend to get on with the business.</p>
<p>Let me just run through a few numbers with you by the way. I've seen some reporting on this in recent days. We are currently investing through this Budget by the way $8.6 billion in transport infrastructure under the nation building program, a billion dollars through the ARTC, one of the projects we're seeing here today. $2.2 billion also now for the Hunter Expressway, the Kempsey bypass and of course the pre-construction work on the West Metro. Put that together that's $11.6 billion in the budget on transport infrastructure for NSW which represents about 32 per cent of what we are investing in transport infrastructure nationwide. That underlines the Premier's point, this is partnership and investment in the critical transport needs of NSW.</p>
<p>Second point I'd make is this, look at the overall investment which the Government has made by way of stimulus nation-wide to help us through the global recession. There is currently something like $21 billion worth of investment coming into the State of NSW on the back of what the Government has done through its various anti-recession measures.</p>
<p>This therefore again underlines the point that we are partners in the future with the NSW Government, working together, practical projects like this which spread right across the State in every category of infrastructure. We intend to get on with the job.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: As a proud Queenslander, do you have (inaudible) dealing with politicians in NSW.</p>
<p>PM: You know something? I have a great affection for our friends in NSW because we share the same religion and it's called rugby league so there you go.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: (inaudible)</p>
<p>PM: We are, one of my predecessors once said that we're all part of the same tribe. This is important work for the nation. Go back to the projects you're talking about. What the nation benefits from here is extra through-put of exports into the Port of Newcastle and here you have work by us here on the ARTC, here you have work by the NSW Government to the Port of Newcastle itself. The objective is to push up coal through-put which boosts our national exports.</p>
<p>Secondly, the investment of $1.65 billion in this important piece of road infrastructure, it also boosts economic efficiency for the nation. The Pacific is a critical corridor for the national economy. That is why we are investing $1.65 billion here. That is why we are also investing in the Kempsey by-pass. Why? We want to make sure that this becomes a critical part of an N1 transport artery from Melbourne through NSW, through Brisbane and through to Cairns.</p>
<p>That's got to be our vision. Building the road network that Australia needs for the future to turbo-charge our economy. Good for the state of NSW and therefore good for the nation of Australia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: (inaudible)</p>
<p>PM: That's why we're working on this critical piece of pre-construction work on the Sydney West Metro and this is a very large prospective project. We've got to make sure all the pre-construction work is done, that's why we're co-investing with NSW, from memory, $90 million to make sure that that work is done.</p>
<p>This is necessary to do and we look forward to being partners with NSW in future infrastructure projects. One step at a time, one building block at a time. Laying the foundations for future infrastructure development in NSW, but you know something? The Budget itself is a nation building Budget for recovery. That's what we're on about.</p>
<p>You can either sit back and carp and criticise and complain and do nothing about the global economic recession or you can get out there and create and support jobs, support small business for today and invest in the infrastructure we need for tomorrow. That's our strategy, I don't see what the alternative strategy is.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: (inaudible)</p>
<p>PM: I've already spoken about this, this morning on a radio interview. It's very plain that it's very important for sporting organisations across the country to show leadership in demonstrating proper respect towards women and therefore the decisions which have been recently taken, I fully support.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Just on projects for the Hunter -</p>
<p>PM: By the way, in the Hunter do you know we are sinking about a billion dollars to the ARTC into the Hunter? That is a huge investment. A huge investment anyway, go to your next question. What else would you like?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: The State Government has a report from the Hunter Development Corporation. When are we going to see that? (inaudible)</p>
<p>REES: I'll take that one. The issue here for those who are unfamiliar necessarily with the rail issue in Hunter City proper is whether or not the most extreme end of the railway line gets closed in order to open up that end of town.</p>
<p>Now there is a report, it's been prepared, it's currently being assessed by the relevant Minister but can I say this: that's a project that has attracted a great deal of controversy over recent years and when I was in the Hunter recently for a community cabinet I took the opportunity to speak directly with 25 people who were having their lunch in the mall in Newcastle. And you know what? 20 out of those 25 said that project has to go ahead. And they didn't just say ‘oh I think it might be a good idea', they said ‘it has to happen', they were absolutely vehement about it. So I think the view on the ground is very clear on that, notwithstanding some of the strong opinions around the place.</p>
<p>Can I just say in response to your earlier question around congestion. Look I was reminded, flying up here this morning of just how stunning a city Sydney is and we've recently tipped over seven million people living in Sydney. A third of Australia's population lives in Sydney. Now that does mean on occasion there are some challenges but you know what? Rail patronage has gone up five per cent in the last year. Patronage on our buses has gone up three per cent in the last year.</p>
<p>In the last two years alone, we've added another 385 bus services in and around Sydney. We are doing a great deal on public transport, we're doing a great deal on roads but the reason we have to do it is because Sydney is such a great city. I am sick to death as are many of the people I speak to, of people talking Sydney down. I'm sick of it and I won't have it. It's the greatest city in the world and I will shout that uphill and down dale. Seven million Australians choosing to live in Sydney because it is one of the greatest cities in the world. And you know what? More consuls-general in Sydney city than any other city in the world and I think that speaks volumes.</p>
