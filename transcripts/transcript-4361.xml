S* ELECTORATE TALK 1<br />
. The fundamental rights of men and women will be strengl: hened<br />
and.. rinot weakenrd or eroded through the-setting up of the<br />
Industrial Relations. Bureau. . S<br />
The Bureau will protect peopleagainst-the wrong actions<br />
of either employer. or union. It will work in the best interests<br />
of. Australians and the community at. large and not against those<br />
interests Despite what some critics may.. say, the Industrial Relations<br />
Bureau will not be'an industrial policeman. In fact, the<br />
Government sees the Bureau as a type of industrial ombudsman.<br />
: It will help ensure the general supervision and observance of<br />
Federal industrial law. It will be a focal point for individual's<br />
complaints. It will be required to investigate individual's<br />
complaints and if the complaint is justified the Bureau will<br />
seek to have the matter rectified.<br />
I wantto make an important point clear here. The lelgislation<br />
which sets up this Bureau ' will introduce into industrial<br />
relations precisely the -same principles of civil. liberty<br />
and' equality: before the '. law that, we take . for granted in every<br />
other-area of human behaviour...<br />
' I . am absolutely certain thatth i gislationhas strong ' and<br />
widespread support throughout Australia for it is legislation<br />
based on our policy that was.. endorsed overwhelmingly at the last<br />
election. There has . been some emotional, ill-informed and sometimes<br />
deliberately misleading attacks on" the broad thrust of this<br />
legislation. We have heard repeated talk of . industrial. confronta-<br />
S tion and even of threats to bring Australia-to its knees. I: think<br />
' it -is worth asking' a simple question. What sort of industrial.<br />
Srelations policy would it be if it got the applause of extremist<br />
union leaders?<br />
Surely, . if the only industrial relations policy that may be<br />
implemented is that acceptable only to a few, but influential,<br />
ext: cemist-union leaders, then that says something. very disturbing<br />
about the -way our society is heading. / If some </p>
<p>.2 -ii 21. j<br />
'. If some-people still believe the policy is unreasonable, they<br />
should think back-to the . times when certain trade union leaders,<br />
defied the. Arbitration Commission and set out to inconvenience<br />
the. nation.*:,<br />
: IThe pointioften. missed here is that the people, they inconvenience<br />
most are the working men and women they claim to represent. It<br />
" is. thew orking man. and his family . that are most affected by<br />
stoppages, strikes, ' bans and go-slows just before a holiday<br />
. weekend or before. a ' Christmas holiday period.<br />
men.,, ih are' min ,-ou<br />
The men who are climing or policies are unreasonable -ar e those-.<br />
who refused to accept the iu mpire ' s verdic t Th. ey refused to abide<br />
by the Arbitration Commission's -decision' Soie have refused<br />
' because their political philosophy is. directed to the destruction<br />
of our system of . Government. Their. central' concern is their'own<br />
power. That is why they attack the Industrial Bureau. They-do<br />
not want any coritrol that could threaten the exercise of their<br />
. own power<br />
The -Governnfnt is not on. a confrontation course with the trade<br />
-union leadership over the Industrial Relations Bureau. It is<br />
not the Government that talks confrdntation. It is others<br />
including. Mr. Hawke.-who. seem determined to set a firm<br />
corrontation course.<br />
The. proper place to decide these issues is in the Parliament.<br />
That. is why the . legislation'will lie on the table of-the House<br />
to give every opportunity for constructive and. reasoned' debate.<br />
The Government will -be -arguing . that the legislation simply seeks<br />
to protect the-rights of inidividuals and the community in a<br />
fair and. reasonable way. We . are seeking to give Australians a<br />
ettero...<br />
I believe -thet h eegiislla ation is very fair .: s: ey and jut. I also believe<br />
that it is infinitely important to the future of' Australia that it<br />
be supported......... j' </p>
