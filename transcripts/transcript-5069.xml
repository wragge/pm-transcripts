WILLESEE COMMENTS ON FRASER INTERVIEW.<br />
FROM WILLESEE<br />
14 JUNE 1979<br />
WILLESEE: On Monday night in the program we showed a special<br />
interview with the Prime Minister Mr. Fraser.<br />
Last night Mr. Fraser's press secretary announced that the interview<br />
had been cut and accused us of unfair editing.<br />
Now this man's job is to say things on behalf of Mr. Fraser so we<br />
have to presume that Mr. Fraser really believed we have been unfair<br />
and wished to say so publicly.<br />
Nov. that's very hurtful. Interviewing Mr. Fraser is never a<br />
joyous occasion. You wake up in the morning of an interview with<br />
our present Prime Minister, remember what you have to do on that<br />
day and you pull the blankets over your head and pretend the day<br />
doesn't exist. You snap at your wife, you don't feel like breakfast<br />
and you consider a set of excuses ranging from doctor's orders to<br />
let's give a younger interviewer his big opportunity.<br />
But, there is no way out. You know you have to do it because he<br />
is the Prime Minister and it's the responsible thing to do.<br />
You know equally that you can't win. You ask a personal question<br />
and he clubs it to death. You ask a political question and he<br />
stares balefully at you as if you are the enemy from some distinctly<br />
lesser tribe. You confront him on a matter of fact and he doesn't<br />
accept that it's a fact. You pursue it manfully, whereas the<br />
Prime Minister himself is fond of telling you you're wasting your<br />
time. MR. FRASER: We said we would introduce new tax scales, we said<br />
we would introduce lower tax scales and reduce taxes, and we have.<br />
WILLESEE: You said you wouldn't increase taxes, but you did.<br />
MR. FRASER: . We made it perfectly plain with the introduction of<br />
tax indexation, we said that if governments want more money they </p>
<p>" Willesee" l 14/ 6/ 79<br />
MR. FRASER:<br />
will have to legislate for it and so we did.<br />
WILLESEE: But don't you think the people might look at you<br />
now and think, look, he is behaving like a politician,-he wants<br />
to get the best out of each answer, which is his right, but he is<br />
not facing up to those basic..<br />
MR. FRASER: I think you want to get the best out of each question<br />
and not recognising the fact that taxes are very much lower than<br />
they have been. And, you know, you'r * e running the risk of doing<br />
what so often seems to happen when you and I get on an interview,<br />
you want me to say something and you stick on that point, or try to<br />
and, you know, you generally fail to get me to say what you want<br />
me to say, and why should I?<br />
WILLESEE: Yes I do generally fail, but I just feel that in the<br />
public ' interest, if I put a question that is important I should<br />
get the answer.<br />
WILLESEE: So having gone through the painful exercise of the<br />
interview, you then edit it into the best shape you can, that's<br />
Vour job, you edit it fairly and honestly, that's not just your<br />
job, that's necessary for survival. You have done maybe 30 interviews<br />
with Prime Ministers in your time, edited about 28 of the 30, and<br />
y ou're still surviving, but now you find yourself accused of being<br />
unfair, your credibility is questioned, even though you have never<br />
broken an election promise in your whole life.<br />
Let me say this seriously. We were not unfair ' to Mr. Fraser and<br />
he knows it. None of the radio or newspaper reports on this<br />
matter today bothered to use the ten minuted we edited out. You see,<br />
it was boring, repetit * ive, it would have been unprofessional to use<br />
it, and more than that, you would have had to watch it or turn off.<br />
I'll give Mr. Fraser a bit of free advice stop being so bloody<br />
aloof, stop treating journalists as the natural enemy, talk to the<br />
people, not dowm at them, face facts, be man enough to admit when<br />
you are wrong, and stop kidding yourself that one beer in a pub<br />
with a flock of photographers on hand makes you one of the boys.<br />
It doesn't. And if you want to come back for another interview, </p>
