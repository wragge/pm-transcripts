    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister and John Fullerton, CEO of the Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC), today announced that the ARTC will fast track a major upgrade to the east-west national rail network.</p>
<p>The upgrade will involve 1200 kilometres of rail replacement between Adelaide and Tarcoola, and will deliver a substantial boost to freight productivity in South Australia and the national freight network.Â </p>
<p>The ARTC will partner with Arrium Steel to deliver the upgrade, substantially boosting demand for steel production at the Whyalla facility.</p>
<p>The upgrade will replace decades old rail with stronger steel, weighing 60kg per metre compared to the current 47kg per metre.</p>
<p>The stronger tracks will enable axle weight to increase from 23 tonne to 25 tonne at 80 kms per hour.</p>
<p>This means that a heavier freight load will be able to be carried and faster track speed, delivering a significant boost in productivity to the network.</p>
