<p>The Gillard Government is providing further support to social and community services (SACS) workers in Western Australia.</p>
<p>The Government believes SACS workers in WA should be recognised for the important work they do, just like other workers in the sector around Australia.</p>
<p>That is why the Government has committed to fund its share of any wage increases resulting from pay equity proceedings currently before the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission (WAIRC).</p>
<p>This commitment is in addition to around $3 billion the Government has already committed to fund its share of the wage increases of 23 to 45 per cent to 150,000 SACS workers awarded by the Fair Work Commission as part of the historic equal remuneration case.  The Commission's decision did not apply to SACS workers in WA outside the national workplace relations system, due to the fact the WA Government had not referred its industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>The Government recognises the critical role of SACS workers in our community - most are women who provide vital services to some of our nation's most vulnerable citizens.  SACS workers deserve to have their work properly valued and to receive decent wages.</p>
<p>This funding to WA SACS workers will ensure jobs and vital services in WA are secure now and into the future.</p>
<p>We are proud of the Government's commitment to equal remuneration, and this additional support is further evidence of this commitment for SACS workers across Australia.</p>
<p>Today's announcement is good for employers and workers in the SACS sector in WA, good for caring workers, good for women, good for families and good for the economy.</p>
<p>The Government will provide further details regarding the funding amount once the  WAIRC announces its decision.</p>
