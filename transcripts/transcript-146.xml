FOR PRESS , MNo5019<br />
UNIVERSITY-DELELOPMNT~ ING4NBERR,<br />
Statement by the Prime M'in-ster, The Rt.' Hon. ROG. Menzies.<br />
Cabinet has devoted much time to ! resolving the<br />
question of the future of the Canberra University College.<br />
Should it be given full and independent University status or<br />
should it be organically associated with the Australian National<br />
University? We have decided in favour of association.<br />
Mindful of the importance of self-government in<br />
University institutions, we have not attempted to work out any<br />
details. lie are inviting both institutions to co-operate in<br />
preparing a plan which will serve as a basis for association in<br />
one university, with one over-all governing-body, one series of<br />
degrees and, as far as is practicable, a comnmon administration.<br />
As this decision is one of great tmoment for those<br />
concerned, I think it ' proper to set out as succinctly as<br />
possible some of the major considerations which have led us to<br />
our conclusion. 4Ie have had close and prolonged ministerial<br />
discussion. I have personally had consultations with representatives<br />
of the A. N. U. and C. U. C. Their views favoured separate<br />
development, and have, of course, been care'fully weighed. When<br />
I was in London earlier this year, I discussed the problem with<br />
Sir Keith Murray, whose committee on Australian Universities had<br />
left this matter open, though with some broad indication of its<br />
approach. More recently, I invited the ne ly-appointed<br />
Australian Universities Commission, under the Chairmanship of<br />
Sir Leslie Martin., to give its opinion.<br />
In the result, the views which Cabinet had tentatively<br />
formed are supported by those of Sir Keith Murray and of the<br />
Universities Commission.<br />
In its celebrated report the Murray Committee said<br />
that " It clearly is a matter for very seriot'is consideration<br />
whether there should be in so small a centr e of population two<br />
quite independent universities". Later tH~ e Committee said:<br />
" It should be possible, in our view, to devise a form<br />
of constitution giving to the College all the independence in<br />
operation which both the National UniversitY and the College<br />
desire and yet making it possible for students at the College to<br />
receive degrees of the National University and for common services<br />
to be organized and maintained without unnecessary duplication.<br />
Such a constitution for a university would be a new<br />
thing in Australia; but there are patterns-of various types in<br />
universities overseas which might viell be studied and we think<br />
it should not pass the wit of man to devise constitutional<br />
arrangements which might suit the situation in Canberra in a<br />
manner which would be acceptable to all concerned".<br />
In conversation with me in London, Sir Keith<br />
developed very strongly his belief that two universities could<br />
not be justified. The principal reasons for this opinion<br />
reasons which have commended themselves to the Cabinet are,<br />
first, that it would be difficult to justify the creation of two<br />
universities in Canberra with a population of around 40O, 000 at a<br />
time when efforts to create second universities in Sydney and<br />
Melbourne are, in the case of Sydney, by no means completed and,<br />
in the case of Melbourne, largely at the ' paper stage'. Where,<br />
as in Australia at the present time, there is a marked and nation<br />
-wide pressure for more universities, care must be taken to<br />
devote the available resources to the best advantage from an<br />
Australia-wide point of view. Second, if the C. U. C. is to </p>
<p>C 2.<br />
become a separate university and is not to be a second-rate<br />
university, it cannot stop at first degrees it must cater for<br />
post-graduate studies. Above all it must provide facilities for<br />
research, and such facilities'are increasipigly costly. The<br />
consequence of this is that a separate and properly developed<br />
Canberra University would, to an extent, duiplicate the Australian<br />
National University at the post-graduate stage or would<br />
need, at -that stage, to become organically associated with the<br />
A. N. U. At a later stage, I consulted thp newly-formed<br />
Australian Universities Commission, a body especially created to<br />
co-ordinate the work of the universities and to examine their<br />
financial requirements. On October 21, 1 received a report<br />
from Sir Leslie Martin, the matorial portion of which is as<br />
follows 11 The Commission has considered this problem, with a<br />
knowledge of the facts and views recently put before Cabinet,<br />
and has unanimously concluded that some form of association<br />
is both desirable and practicable. Further, Commissioners<br />
believe that if the concept of association is accepted it<br />
can be more easily achieved now than later.<br />
It should be possible for a form of association to be<br />
worked out by a committee consisting of representatives of<br />
the Australian National University and the Canberra University<br />
College during the next twelve mpnths. Presumably<br />
such a committee would have before it full details of<br />
distinguished and successful forms of association between<br />
research institutes and universities elsewhere, e~ g.,<br />
Chicago, Columbia, Harvard and Princeton.<br />
Before reaching its decision to recommend in favour<br />
of association, the Commission gave some thought to the<br />
means by which this could be achieved. It seems to the<br />
Commission essential that there should be one institution,<br />
to be called the Australian National Univelsity, and that<br />
it should have one Council, with a Vice-Chancellor as its<br />
chief executive officer.<br />
The Commission went on to indicate diagramatically<br />
certain suggested forms of organisation which I have conveyed to<br />
the two bodies concerned.<br />
We are au~ are of a view current in the A. N. U. that that<br />
body should, to achieve its true position : in Australian University<br />
life, be related and have duties to all Australian universities<br />
and not just to one. Our reply is that the fact of<br />
amalgamation in Canberra would not mean that the highly<br />
specialised researchers of the A. N. U. would not be available to<br />
State Universities or that there could not be effective exchange<br />
of research workers betwieen all. Ile are quite aware of the fact<br />
that there are some highly specialised investigations conducted<br />
at the A. N. U. which could not be sensibly interrupted by the<br />
routine teaching of undergraduates. But as we all know,<br />
teaching and exposition have riat value in clarifying the mind<br />
and in actually testing conclusions already tentatively arrived<br />
at. It may turn out to be extremely useful for courses of<br />
lectures to advanced honours' students, for example, to be<br />
delivered by some of the -reat and world-famous expc rts in the<br />
Australian National University as it is today constituted. Lie<br />
feel also that if the University is to achieve its greatest<br />
results, not only in the granting of degrees but in the stimulation<br />
of the mind, there will be enormous advantage for students<br />
with a bent towards research to have the great advantage of<br />
contact with men of 7reat eminence in their own field. </p>
<p>3.<br />
In short, we have made our decision for association<br />
because we believe that together and as one institution the<br />
National University and the College will offer to Australia in<br />
the next generation more than they can hopp to offer separately.<br />
It is not our intention that this decision should interfere<br />
with the turk being carried on by either body or prejudice the<br />
proper exercise of responsibility by those wlao deal with<br />
graduates or under., raduates. ' e are quite confident that the<br />
two bodies together will work out a plan which will preserve the<br />
interests of workers in both and provide ani organisation which<br />
will enable them to co-operate fully for the banefit of both.<br />
The working out of the necessary arrangements will take<br />
some time. It cannot be done in a hurry. Our decision means<br />
that the new association will operate by the beginning of 1961.<br />
As the current arrangements with the University of<br />
Melbourne, which has nurtured the welfare of the Canberra<br />
University College for a quarter of a century, were due to<br />
terminate at the end of 1959, I requested the Council of the<br />
University of Melbourne to extend its affiliation for one year,<br />
that is, until the end of 1960. That Council has most<br />
generously decided to extend its legislation relating to<br />
Canberra University College until the end of 1960. I am indeed<br />
most grateful for this decision, which will enable the scheme<br />
of association to be formed without undue pressure, though it<br />
must be brought to finality in good time.<br />
CANBERRA, 17th December, 1959. </p>
