<p>MUNROE:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, thanks for your time. If we could just start with</p>
<p> drugs firstly. What's the message you want to send drug addicts,</p>
<p> to give up or to go to jail?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Take treatment. And what we're saying to people is that, isn't</p>
<p> it better to take treatment than run the risk of being caught up in</p>
<p> the criminal justice system. That's the alternative we're</p>
<p> offering people.</p>
<p>MUNROE:</p>
<p>So how do you make treatment compulsory?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what you basically say is, the police apprehend somebody and</p>
<p> rather than sending them off to be charged, they send them off for</p>
<p> assessment and the assessment panel say you should undertake such</p>
<p> and such a treatment. And the person is given the option Â undertake</p>
<p> that treatment or alternatively run the risk of being caught up in</p>
<p> the criminal justice system. Now, in most cases people will opt for</p>
<p> the treatment. They won't be forced to take the treatment but</p>
<p> it will certainly be a more attractive option.</p>
<p>MUNROE:</p>
<p>The Leader of the Opposition says that that's just political</p>
<p> babble when it comes to a chronic drug addict who won't be able</p>
<p> to decide, really, what he or she wants to do.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, some people won't, but a lot will. And a lot will be guided</p>
<p> by their families, a lot will be guided by their friends. We calculate</p>
<p> that this initiative will make available 300,000 treatment places</p>
<p> over a period of four years. On its own it's not going to solve</p>
<p> the problem, and it's easy to score points off it if you want</p>
<p> to be negative, but it is another contribution to fighting a very</p>
<p> difficult problem.</p>
<p>MUNROE:</p>
<p>Now, if treatment is better than punishment, as you've indicated,</p>
<p> why then did you support the expulsion of those young girls at the</p>
<p> private college who were caught smoking marijuana? Why not assess</p>
<p> them, treat them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, for a very simple reason. The rules of the school forbade the</p>
<p> use of drugs and I applaud any school that enforces its rules. I'm</p>
<p> not running around saying that every single person who's ever</p>
<p> used drugs should be punished. And I am saying that if you're</p>
<p> going to inculcate an attitude of not tolerating drugs in schools</p>
<p> Â when a school's rules say Âno drugs' and somebody</p>
<p> defies those rules the school has got a right to take action and I</p>
<p> support that and I think most parents watching this programme would</p>
<p> agree with me.</p>
<p>MUNROE:</p>
<p>And set the example.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>MUNROE:</p>
<p>Now, not all State leaders support you on your zero tolerance policy.</p>
<p> Will any of the new money be withheld if State leaders do not fully</p>
<p> come on board with the Commonwealth?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, put aside nomenclature like Âzero tolerance.' That's</p>
<p> an argument about words. This diversionary system that we're</p>
<p> arguing has got nothing to do with whether you zero tolerance or some</p>
<p> other description. What we're going to do is to fund additional</p>
<p> treatment places. We'll work with the States, use their police</p>
<p> forces apprehending people, send them off for assessment. When the</p>
<p> people are assessed they have the option of being treated or caught</p>
<p> up in the criminal justice system. The great bulk of those people</p>
<p> will opt for the treatment. Many of them will be improved, a lot will</p>
<p> be rehabilitated. Now, isn't that better than what we've</p>
<p> got at the moment.</p>
<p>MUNROE:</p>
<p>And just on to the GST, Prime Minister. Your own Treasury official</p>
<p> dropped a bombshell yesterday saying that the 1.5 per cent over inflation</p>
<p> extra for pensioners will eventually be eroded.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, he didn't say that.</p>
<p>MUNROE:</p>
<p>Eroded in time, I think he said.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, look, there was no bombshell dropped. Look, the situation</p>
<p> here is that we promised that every pensioner would have his pension</p>
<p> increased by the cost of living plus at least 1.5 per cent, at least</p>
<p> 1.5 per cent. Now, nothing that was said yesterday alters that situation.</p>
<p> We also have a situation where every pensioner is guaranteed 25 per</p>
<p> cent of male average weekly earnings. Now if, as a result of that,</p>
<p> the pensioners end up even better off, why should people complain.</p>
<p>MUNROE:</p>
<p>And you don't think price rises will erode that buffer zone?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, price rises can't because the price rises drive the CPI and</p>
<p> our guarantee is that you'll always be 1.5 per cent ahead of</p>
<p> the CPI.</p>
<p>MUNROE:</p>
<p>You only have three months to get it through before the Democrats</p>
<p> take power in the Senate. Are you still as optimistic of getting it</p>
<p> through?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm more optimistic today because you've had every</p>
<p> government in Australia effectively saying to the Senate, get on with</p>
<p> it. I mean, when you get Bob Carr, Labor, Peter Beattie, Labor, Jim</p>
<p> Bacon, Labor, Jeff Kennett, Liberal, Richard Court, Liberal, John</p>
<p> Olsen, Liberal, all signing up and saying this is the best financial</p>
<p> deal the States have ever had, the best since World War II, that sends</p>
<p> a very strong message to the Senate which, after all, is meant to</p>
<p> be a States' House. I mean, you've now got the Federal Government,</p>
<p> you've got the governments of the States and Territories, more</p>
<p> importantly you've got the verdict of the Australian people last</p>
<p> October, and all of those are saying to the Senate: get on with it,</p>
<p> let's implement this tax plan. The Australian people supported</p>
<p> it, the Premiers have endorsed it, they want it because their State</p>
<p> will be better off. Let's get on with it and go onto something</p>
<p> else.</p>
<p>MUNROE:</p>
<p>And do you still need Senator Brian Harradine or has Senator Colston</p>
<p> come around a little?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what Senator Colston ultimately does is his decision as is Senator</p>
<p> Harradine's. Senator Colston made representations to us today</p>
<p> about the deal for Queensland and that played a part in the decision</p>
<p> we made. We reached a compromise with the Queensland Premier and I</p>
<p> acknowledge that. In the end they'll make up their own minds.</p>
<p> Obviously we need one of them at least with the other abstaining or</p>
<p> both of them voting for us in order to get the plan through and I</p>
<p> hope that will happen. But I also say to the Labor Party and the Democrats,</p>
<p> listen to the public, listen to the Premiers. They can't all</p>
<p> be wrong. I say to Kim Beazley, Bob Carr has just won an election,</p>
<p> he is the most successful Labor leader in the nation and he signed</p>
<p> up today. Peter Beattie has just won an election. They know the pulse</p>
<p> of their people and their people are saying, get on with it let's</p>
<p> not spend the rest of our lives arguing over the GST.</p>
<p>MUNROE:</p>
<p>You're pretty chuffed about today's Premiers' Conference.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am. It's the best Premiers' Conference I have been to</p>
<p> for 20 years ever in my political life because it's done something</p>
<p> of lasting value for the future of the Australian federation. It's</p>
<p> given the federation a new hope and a new opportunity for a new century</p>
<p> and I am chuffed about it and I am very proud of what the Government</p>
<p> has been able to achieve and what the Treasurer and I together have</p>
<p> been able to achieve.</p>
<p>MUNROE:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, just briefly on the tragedy in Kosovo and the refugees.</p>
<p> Given that the first refugees already arrive late next week and how</p>
<p> rushed it has been for everybody, do you have any second thoughts</p>
<p> about them coming?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't, none at all. It was always going to be rushed because</p>
<p> it was an unexpected emergency situation. And the army and the immigration</p>
<p> authorities have responded magnificently. I don't have any second</p>
<p> thoughts at all, not at all.</p>
<p>MUNROE:</p>
<p>And do you think we that we could be actually helping Milosevic with</p>
<p> this ethnic cleansing by bringing them here?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We would run the risk of doing that if we had straight away said they</p>
<p> were going to be able to remain here permanently and there was no</p>
<p> prospect of them ever going back. But we are human beings, we are</p>
<p> a compassionate nation. We could not have sat on our hands in the</p>
<p> face of that enormous mountain of human misery. It would have shamed</p>
<p> us if we had have done so.</p>
<p>MUNROE:</p>
<p>And yet your Immigration Minister and Foreign Minister wanted to do</p>
<p> so.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, that's not right. All they were doing was giving an immediate</p>
<p> response within then current policy. And, I mean, be fair. This first</p>
<p> became a possibility early Monday morning, by lunchtime Tuesday we</p>
<p> had made a decision to take 4,000. You can't act any more quickly</p>
<p> than that. And all Philip was doing was responding within current</p>
<p> policy and he is a magnificent Immigration Minister and he has my</p>
<p> total support.</p>
<p>MUNROE:</p>
<p>Fair enough, fair enough. So is your bottom line that the Kosovo refugees</p>
<p> will definitely be going back?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We want them to go back. We hope they will go back, we hope conditions</p>
<p> are restored so they can go back. We are obviously not going to push</p>
<p> them into the sea at the end of three or six months. We are a compassionate</p>
<p> people but we want maximum pressure put on Milosevic so that they</p>
<p> can go back and that's our goal.</p>
<p>MUNROE:</p>
<p>And as you may know the two CARE Australia aid workers have been found.</p>
<p> Yugoslavia says they know they have them. Are we in a position to</p>
<p> demand their release?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, in a situation like this you try everything. You ask, you demand,</p>
<p> you request, you get people to intercede on your behalf. And I can</p>
<p> say to their families if they are watching tonight that we care about</p>
<p> them and we are trying very hard using every means that are at our</p>
<p> disposal to get them back and along with you we pray that they'll</p>
<p> be safely returned.</p>
<p>MUNROE:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, thanks very much for your time and we appreciate it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
