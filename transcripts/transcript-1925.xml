COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
DROUGHT RELIEF<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 26 September 1968]<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
-by leave-I recently received representations<br />
from the Premiers of New South<br />
Wales and Victoria requesting the continuation<br />
of Commonwealth reimbursement of<br />
State expenditures on drought relief measures.<br />
The Premier of New South Wales<br />
asked for a continuation of Commonwealth<br />
payments for drought relief measures in the<br />
south east corner of the State and in the<br />
Cobar district. The Premier of Victoria<br />
asked for the continuation of drought assistance<br />
for financing employment grants in<br />
Victoria. Honourable members will recall that, in<br />
my statement of 20th August 1968 in this<br />
iuse, I pointed out that, contrary to the<br />
f~ imal arrangements in relation to natural<br />
disaster relief assistance, the Commonwealth<br />
has been meeting virtually the whole cost<br />
of State expenditure on drought relief mea-<br />
O sures. These arrangements have undoubtedly<br />
been the most generous ever designed to<br />
meet such a situation. I also announced<br />
that, as the drought which has been affecting<br />
most of the eastern half of the Australian<br />
continent had virtually ended, certain<br />
cut-off dates for this assistance had been<br />
set. I added that, if a State felt it necessary<br />
to continue any particular measure after<br />
the cut-off date for Commonwealth assistance,<br />
it would be reasonable for the State<br />
to meet the limited expenditure likely to<br />
be involved. At the same time, I made it<br />
23104/ 68 clear that, if drought conditions were to<br />
re-emerge on a large scale, the Commonwealth<br />
would be prepared to consult with<br />
the States regarding the need for any new<br />
arrangements which might be necessary.<br />
Very favourable seasonal conditions exist<br />
in most of eastern Australia and the areas<br />
which are still drought affected make up<br />
only a small proportion of that area. The<br />
drought has not re-emerged generally on a<br />
large scale. The Commonwealth therefore<br />
does not feel able to continue the existing<br />
scheme. We have decided however, that<br />
the Commonwealth should make a contribution<br />
towards meeting the special problem<br />
which exists in New South Wales where<br />
the south east corner and Cobar districts<br />
are still very seriously affected by continuing<br />
drought and which might be regarded<br />
as areas of natural disaster. In order<br />
to help the State Government alleviate hardship<br />
being experienced by the people of<br />
these regions, I have therefore informed<br />
the Premier of New South Wales that the<br />
Commonwealth will be prepared to meet<br />
half the cost in this financial year of relief<br />
measures which his Government may find<br />
it necessary to continue in these areas, until<br />
the drought breaks.<br />
Victoria is not drought stricken and the<br />
seasonal outlook in that State is generally<br />
very good. There is no doubt that drought<br />
conditions have disappeared over virtually<br />
the whole of the State. Because this is the<br />
0 </p>
<p>situation, 1 have informed the Premier that<br />
we cannot meet his request for the continuation<br />
of drought assistance for financing<br />
employment grants beyond the end of this<br />
month. However, I would remind honourable<br />
members that, under existing arrangements,<br />
the Commonwealth will be reimbursing<br />
the States during the whole of<br />
1968-69 for the cost of certain other relief<br />
measures incurred after 30th September. I<br />
refer here, in particular, to carry-on loans<br />
to farmers who have established a case for<br />
such assistance before 30th September and<br />
to restocking loans to farmers who established<br />
a case for such assistance before 31st<br />
December. In addition, the Commonwealth<br />
will be reimbursing the States for freight<br />
concessions given prior to the end of<br />
December on the transport of stock back<br />
from agistment or for restocking purposes.<br />
Under these arrangements a further advance of $ 1m is now being made to Victoria<br />
bringing our total payments to that<br />
State to $ 13m including $ 5m this financial<br />
year. I would repeat that the four States which<br />
suffered from the drought have been informed<br />
that the Commonwealth will be<br />
prepared to consider new arrangements if<br />
drought conditions re-emerge on a large<br />
scale. I am sure we all hope that this will<br />
not be necessary and that the pockets of<br />
drought which still remain in New South<br />
Wales will be relieved-and that soonby<br />
good general rains in those areas.<br />
I present the following paper:<br />
Drought Assistance-Ministerial Statement, 2<br />
September 1968-<br />
and move:<br />
That the House take note of the paper. 0<br />
BY AUTHORITY: A. J. ARTHUR, COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT PRINTER, CANBERRA, A. C. T. </p>
