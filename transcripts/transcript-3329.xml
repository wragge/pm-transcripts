PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 237<br />
le July 1974<br />
GREEN PAPER ON MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr E. G. Whitlam, today announced that the<br />
Government had established a committee to advise it on appropriate<br />
policies for the development of manufacturing industry. The committee's<br />
report will be published as a Green Paper.<br />
The Prime Minister said that the committee would be under the<br />
chairmanship of Mr Gordon Jackson, General Manager and Director,<br />
C. S. R. Limited. Other members would be:<br />
Mr B. W. Brogan, Consultant, Department of the Prime<br />
Minister and Cabinet<br />
Mr R. H. Carnegie, Chairman and Chief Executive,<br />
Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd<br />
Mr N. S. Currie, Secretary, Department of<br />
Manufacturing Industry<br />
Mr R. J. L. Hawke, President, Australian Council of<br />
Trade Unions<br />
Mr G. A. Rattigan, Chairman, Industries<br />
Assistance Commission and<br />
Mr E. L. Wheelwright, DFC, Associate Professor,<br />
Department of Economics, the University of Sydney.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the terms of reference of the committee<br />
are: To advise on appropriate policies for the development<br />
of manufacturing industry, including:<br />
The machinery required for integrating such<br />
policies with the Government's general economic,<br />
social and regional policies;<br />
The place of exports and imports in the development<br />
of manufacturing industry; and<br />
The role of firms of overseas origin in manufacturing;<br />
and to advise 6n communication between the Australian Government<br />
and the private sector and the State governments with respect<br />
to the development and implementation of such policies. 2<br />
_ 4.11ST ALI( A </p>
<p>The committee will be able to draw upon the resources of the<br />
of the Australian Public Service in its work. The expected date by<br />
which the Green Paper should be available will be announced as soon<br />
as possible. The Prime Minister said that the establishment of the committee<br />
was a clear indication of the Australian Government's wish that the<br />
Government and industry work together for the national good. The terms<br />
of reference were deliberately wide and he expected that interested<br />
organisations and persons would take the opportunity to make submissions<br />
to the committee. There would, of course, be further involvement of the<br />
community in the determination of policies in this area once the<br />
Green Paper was published.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that this was the first time that a comprehensive<br />
public examination of policies for manufacturing industry had been undertaken<br />
in Australia. He expected that well founded policies would<br />
result which would set the pattern of Government/ industry relations<br />
for years to come.<br />
The Australian Government welcomed the opportunity which the<br />
Green Paper would provide for the community to assess the way in<br />
which Australia would progress in the future in this most important<br />
sector.<br />
