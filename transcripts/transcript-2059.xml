SPEECH IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES BY THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER, THE KT. HON. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE SITE<br />
29 May 1969<br />
The debate on the siting of the new and permnanent<br />
Parliament House has now proceeded over something like the last<br />
9 months. It resulted initially from the Government's decision<br />
of last August to have a free non-party vote on the question of a site.<br />
That debate provided a full opportunity for members and senators<br />
to express their views, and most of them did.<br />
The original proposal for the lakeside site was clearly<br />
unacceptable to the majority of the members in each House, and that<br />
site was abandoned. Subsequently, the joint Select Committee,<br />
representative of all parties and both Houses, after hearing and<br />
studying public and expert evidence from all those wishing to come<br />
forward, overwhelmingly recommended to Parliament that the new<br />
Parliament House should be sited on Camp Hill, as was originally<br />
planned by Burley Griffin, the designer of Canberra. In the resultant<br />
debate the House of Representatives voted to agree with the<br />
recommendation of that Committee while the Senate voted to disagree<br />
with it, and the Senate has also voted against the proposal for a joint<br />
sitting. The position therefore remains quite unresolved.<br />
It should not be allowed to remain unresolved because<br />
of the need for planning and construction of other works, both road<br />
works and construction which depend on the making of a decision as<br />
to the site of Parliament House. Therefore the Government, feeling<br />
that a decision must be made, has decided to inform the National<br />
Capital Development Commission that Camp Hill will be the site of<br />
the new and permanent Parliament House. </p>
