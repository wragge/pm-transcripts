PRIME MINISTER<br />
October 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
DOORSTOP WREST POINT CASINO HOTEL<br />
HOBART, TASMANIA<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
There was Bass, there was Canberra, now I think I can say, Lindsay.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I think we can say, " Jackie Kelly, we love you." After 42 per cent,<br />
42 per cent of the votes that have been counted, Jackie Kelly has 50.3 per cent of the<br />
majority vote. On those figures her primary vote has risen by about seven per cent since<br />
the general election. And it is estimated conservatively that the two Party preferred swing<br />
to the Liberal Party is about two per cent conservatively and some estimates will put it as<br />
high as five per cent. Now, Lindsay is not an electorate which sort of has a Liberal end<br />
and a Labor end. I mean, you've got 42 per cent... I1 mean, I'm a very cautious bloke. One<br />
of Australia's better known political commentators said I was an absolute pessimist when<br />
it came to by-elections. I always like to have happy surprises, but this is a tremendous<br />
result, it really is. And to win a seat like this, as it appears as though we have, with an<br />
increased majority after seven months and after a pretty ordinary week over the<br />
last ( applause) all I can say is that... . I mean, the person who should be in our thoughts<br />
tonight is our magnificent candidate, Jackie Kelly.<br />
But can I simply thank the people of Lindsay. I'm very proud of the fact that a lot of<br />
Howard's battlers who came to us on the 2nd of March and stayed with us, it looks as<br />
though they may have brought some of their mates with them. And the other thing that<br />
I've got to say is that this result is a vindication of that great Australian tradition of the fair<br />
go, it really is. That girl deserved a fair go and it seems as though, through all the static,<br />
that the wonderful people of Lindsay have delivered her that fair go. So thank you Jackie,<br />
you're terrific, you're the tops and we'll welcome you back with open arms when you are<br />
re-sworn in again.<br />
Thank you very much. </p>
