NEW ZEALAND TOUR 1967<br />
PRESS COFEREiCE SUMMING UP TIALK<br />
! ITH F~ UI. JHULl TE ANAU, fhil 7TH FE3RUARY, 1967.<br />
MiR. HOLT: I thou t I would give you some idea of the things<br />
Mr. Holyoake and talked about. i. e have had a series of<br />
opportunities-for thlking closely together. I won't be able to<br />
go into a great deal of detail on these matters because a lot of<br />
the talk was of quite a confidential kind, but it was helpful to<br />
us both to exchange views in this intimate wayi and as you will<br />
gather from the subject matter I will give you, the talks ranged<br />
Tar and wide. Naturally Vietnam featured in its various aspects in our<br />
discussions and so did the South Pacific generally. I was very<br />
interested, for example to learn of the constitutional developments<br />
which have occurred in the territories, formerly Trust Territories of<br />
Iew Zealand, and some of these territories in this general area are<br />
of such interest to us that I thought it would be useful, and I<br />
suggested this to M! r. Holyoake, that at some point of time, not<br />
necessarily this year but at a time convenient to us we take<br />
a lo-k at the people to see how they are faring in the new<br />
situations which have arisen from their new constitutional processes.<br />
And decimal currency........ I was able to speak with some<br />
authority on this matter, of course, as the Treasurer who introduced<br />
the scheme into Australia; I have noticed quite a deal of discussion<br />
in the press here about the transition phase. Some of the<br />
apprehensions which have formerly been voiced in Australia were<br />
expressed here and I was aole to tell them of our own experience.<br />
The fact is that in some directions it has exceeded our expectations,<br />
but the cost has been less than we had estimated and the changeover<br />
of the machinery is proceeding well ahead of schedule.<br />
Understandably as two Heads of Government, we had a good<br />
deal to talk about together on the way we organize our Cabinet and<br />
Parliamentary business and seei r. vh'it we could learn from each<br />
other which would be helpful. found that there were differences<br />
in methods of treating different subject matter Cabinet for example.<br />
He was interested to see how our Procedures went, and I think I was<br />
aole to indicate directions in which we had streamlined our Cabinet<br />
business. On the other hand, of course, he had a rather different<br />
situation here with a smaller iinistry and his Ministers are more<br />
accessible in point of distance than mine can be. But this was the<br />
sort of thing Parliamentary and Caoinet organisation of business<br />
which came into our talks.<br />
Tourism, I said something about this at the Parliamentary<br />
Luncheon, and the more I have seen -as I have gone around the more<br />
I feel that w: e can usefully co-operate together. Quite obviously<br />
New Zealand has a great deal to offer which hould be more widely<br />
known in Australia anrid I may be able to help in that direction, but<br />
what I was thinking of particularly, when I spoke previously, was that<br />
we might be aole to help each other by encoura; in-. tourists who come<br />
to our own countries to take in a visit to the other as part of<br />
their journey. I have been interested incidentally to see how the<br />
Government ha-is established hotels such as this here at particular<br />
points of scenic attraction where the area has not been adequately<br />
served previously by the official hotel industry. Mr. Holyoake<br />
expressed to me that they don't move into an area where there is<br />
an hotel service provideR already, but the points where they are<br />
featuring the attractions of the place and there isn't accommodation<br />
appropriate to the sort of tourist traffic they are looking for<br />
they have gone into this field. I am not implying that there is a<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
parallel to this in Australia but it is interesting to see how<br />
they are handling it.<br />
I think I have a clearer picture of the IManapouri Scheme<br />
as a result of having come here, and its importance to New Zealand,<br />
both to add some visual picture of the basis of the Scheme and also<br />
its implications. The topic of forest products is one which is clearly one of<br />
interest here, and while the Prime Minister touched on this and the<br />
operations of the Free Trade Agreement, we did not discuss this in<br />
any depth because John McEwen is coming over shortly for detailed<br />
discussion on these matters as Part of the regular and periodical<br />
conference in he writing out of'the Agreement. But I must admit<br />
that I haven't detected the same tone in my discussions with<br />
Ministers here that there has been evident in some of the editorials<br />
and some of the statements b' representatives of industry on this<br />
matter. ' e had a good deal to talk about together of mutual interest<br />
arising from the visit to our respective countries of President<br />
Johnson and Prime M'inister Ky. I was aole to inform the Prime Minister<br />
in a quite incidental way of the purposeful approach of our<br />
manufacturing industries in some of our more sophisticated projects.<br />
For example, the wvork we are doing at 7oomera through ELDO and<br />
also the manufacture of the guided missile system such as IKARA.<br />
7e talked of the Manila Conference and the desirability of<br />
maintaining momentum in relation to the goals which had emerged<br />
from the Manila Conference. talked in a general way without<br />
either of us having very precise information aoout the recent<br />
developments in China. I1ow that is not an exhaustive list. It is<br />
just a selection which I jotted down last night on some of the<br />
matters which had occupied our time together. e covered a very<br />
wide range, and I am sure I am very much better informed about New<br />
Zealand, both as a result of my visit and the talks with Cabinet and<br />
more particularly the Prime Minister. I think I can claim he has<br />
learned a good de. al more asout : hat is going on inside Australia.<br />
Aspects of the economy and the problems which he faces at<br />
the present time of course may also have come into our thoughts.<br />
But I am not wishing to imply on any of these matters that requests<br />
were made by one or the other in exchanging information and views<br />
not seeking many immediate outcome from them. I thought it might be<br />
helpful to have cover of this sort because now we are moving into a<br />
day in which there won't be much of an official nature and oerhaps<br />
these are elements of Australia which will fill in a bit. Have we<br />
made any arrangements for a final talk<br />
MR. E; GLETOi: There will be an opportunity at Christchurch tomorrow.<br />
They want an opportunity to have a final word with you and, of course<br />
Christchurch would oe the est place for thit. And of course, when we<br />
ret off the plane in Canberra tomorrow night there will be a simil: r<br />
little gathering on the tarmac as there was when you left.<br />
MR. HOLT: Well all right. I think w: e can give at that the general<br />
impressions on how it went. </p>
