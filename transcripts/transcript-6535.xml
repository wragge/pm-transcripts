GOVERN1MENT TAXATION POLICY STATEMENT<br />
The economic policies of the Government, and the approach<br />
that has been used in developing and implementing those<br />
policies, have produced dramatic improvements for all<br />
Australians since March, 1983:<br />
the creation of over 260,000 new jobs against the loss of<br />
almost 200,000 in the last twelve months of the Coalition<br />
Government; halving the inflation rate from double that of the rest<br />
of the industrialised world to an underlying rate around<br />
that of other advanced countries;<br />
significant reductions in interest rates;<br />
significant reductions in the Budget deficit;<br />
restoration of the housing industry from drastically<br />
depressed levels to high levels of activity.<br />
These results, which are fundamentally important to the<br />
welfare of all Australians, have flowed froi this<br />
Government's unique approach to policy-making. We have not<br />
sought to impose positions from above.<br />
Under this Government's approach there has been more<br />
consultation, informati-on-sharing and tapping into the<br />
accumulated experience and wisdom of business, trade<br />
unionsand community organisations than ever before in the<br />
history of this country.<br />
This approach has been spectacularly successful by all<br />
relevant criteria a fact acknowledged within Australia and<br />
very widely by international commentators.<br />
A handsome dividend on the economic success of the<br />
Government, and the approach that it has used to<br />
policy-making, will be paid with effect from tomorrow.<br />
Substantial persona] income tax cuts $ 7.60 a week for the </p>
<p>average taxpayer or equivalent to a wace increase of $ 11 a<br />
week will flow to all taxnayers. And they represent a<br />
real reduction in personal income tax. Full indexation to<br />
cover the effects of inflation would nave cost $ 1.2 billion<br />
in a full year. These cuts will cost billion.<br />
The Government intends to apply exactly the saine approach to<br />
an overhaul of the Australian taxation system as it has used<br />
in the formulation of the general econo~ mic strategy which<br />
has produced these outstanding results. And the dividends<br />
resulting from an overhaul of the tax system will again flow<br />
to all Australians unless they have been cheating on tax<br />
in a big way.<br />
The Government will conduct a comprehensive review of the<br />
Australian taxation system based on widespread community<br />
consultations during 1985, leading to an announcement on a<br />
tax reform package towards the end of 1985.<br />
The Government has been progressively implementing changLz<br />
designed to improve the existing tax system since assumirzg<br />
office in March 1983.<br />
The first element of the Government's policy as I have<br />
already indicated is tomorrow's substantial personal income<br />
tax cuts. The tax cuts address immediately one important<br />
problem area in the tax system -the excessive levels of tax<br />
on low and middle incomes. All taxpayers benefit from these<br />
cuts. The second element of the Government's policy is the<br />
vigorous strengthening of the existing tax law and<br />
administration. We have cracked down on tax avoidance and<br />
evasion in the cash economy. We have updated taxation<br />
penalties, and created a stronger Tax Office by increasing<br />
its resources.<br />
1We have also legislated against/ tax loopholes, althougir the<br />
Opposition in the Senate flas obstructed the Government's<br />
fproposed action against such notorious tax avoidance schemes<br />
as " bottom of the harbour" and " cherry pickers".<br />
There is strong. commun'ity support for the third element of<br />
the Government's tax policy: an overhaul of Australia's<br />
taxation system. Most Aust). alians believe that the overall<br />
distribution of the taxation burden is unfair. They are<br />
resentful at the unfairness associated with substantial tax<br />
avoidance by a minority. There is also widespread belief<br />
that the tax system is holding back economric development,<br />
and discouraging much potentially valuable investment,<br />
production and employment. There is particular concern that<br />
the interaction of the taxation and social security systems<br />
is discouraging social security recipients from full<br />
participation in the national economy thlat is, thz-t they<br />
have created oovertv t1raos. </p>
<p>And when the community talks of the inequities and anomuralies<br />
of the existing ta,, system, they are talking about a systerr<br />
whic: h has been built-up over a period in which the Coalition<br />
parties had b-en in power for 31 of the 34 years before we<br />
assumed office in iNarch, 1983.<br />
While acknowledging t hese wea'Anesses in the tax system that<br />
we have inherited and particularly the unfairness<br />
associated with tax avoidance the Government does not<br />
underestimate the difficulties of overhauling the system.<br />
Indeed, to be brutally frank, the difficulties are enormous.<br />
This is why there has been no substantial tax reform in<br />
Australia, despite the work of Asprey, Mathews and others.<br />
The administrative, economic and political difficulties<br />
associated with overhauling the tax system explain why the<br />
previous Coalition Government abandoned its attempt to<br />
change the tax system limited ' though that was and why<br />
the opposition has been so vague in its recent tax policy<br />
statement. But two lessons are clear from what has been<br />
said, and more importantly what has not been done in the<br />
past decade about improving our tax system.<br />
IThe first lesson is that tinkering at the margin in<br />
attempting cynically to gain short-term political advantage<br />
A4Z.~ is very likely to generate new complexities, inefficiencies<br />
and inequities. Tax reform will only be worthwhile and in<br />
any case is probably only achievable if it is based on<br />
if detailed and thorough analysis of packages of alternative<br />
measures. The second lesson is that meaningful reform is not possible<br />
in the absence of widespread commiunity agreement that the<br />
tax changes make the system fairer and more equitable.<br />
There can be no progress unless the co:-wunity can be<br />
persuaded that the Government is serious about an overhaul<br />
of the tax system which includes a reduction in some taxes.<br />
The Government's approach to tax reform takes account of<br />
both lessons. The opposition's approach takes account of<br />
neither. The Government's approach to overhauling the tax system is<br />
fully consistent with its approach to the economic<br />
management of thi's country since assuming office: one of<br />
consensus, typified by the holding of the National Economic<br />
Summit Conference and the subsequent establishment of the<br />
Economic Planning Advisory Council ( EPA$ C) and a number of<br />
consultative councils. It is an approach that has the trust<br />
and confidence of the Australian people. It is an approach<br />
that will ensure that the economic procress since March 1983<br />
will not be put at risk.<br />
The idea of a tax review is no short-term election giMMick.<br />
The i'despread comm,, unity discussion th-at the Government has<br />
fostered3 on the tax system has been since the v. ery<br />
first meeting of EPA_ 1C in July, 1983, tne Coun1cil called_<br />
for a Treasury summary of the findinqs cf pre;' i,-ous ta): ation<br />
s tu eS. </p>
<p>in the March, 19863 meeting of EPAC, there was discussion o: c<br />
papers by EPAC members on taxation. I said in my Press<br />
Statement after this zaeeting:<br />
" I am grateful to "-PAC members for the productive effort<br />
that they have put into the w~ ork on taxation policy for this<br />
meeting. EPAC agreed that:<br />
it is clear from these contributions that there are<br />
shortcomings in the present taxation structure, whether<br />
viewed from the standpoint of the efficient long-term<br />
growth of the Australian economy, or of the building of a<br />
more equitable Australian society. i<br />
it is also clear that taxation reform must consist of an<br />
overall package. Single elements of taxation reform<br />
cannot properly be judged in isolation. For communitv<br />
discussion of these matters, and in the end government<br />
decision, to be productive, it-should focus on interrelated<br />
packages of measures. This makes the matter<br />
highly complex, and it will take considerable time for<br />
informed community attitudes to emerge.<br />
reform of the taxation structure is a long-term matter,<br />
with large implications for the growth and structure of<br />
the Australian economy. Different sectors of the econoray<br />
have put very different views to EPAC.<br />
consistent with the Government's approach to building<br />
community consensus on complex issues, the Government<br />
will not take positions on these matters until there has<br />
been wide comnmunity discussion and uantil informed<br />
attitudes to alternative packages have emerged."<br />
By the time of the last EPAC meeting in September this year,<br />
all groups represented on EPAC had presented views on tax<br />
reform. A number of other economic and community<br />
organisations submitted papers to EPAC after my March<br />
statement. Many others have indicated their interest in<br />
doing so, and the Government would welcome further<br />
submissions early in the New Year. These and other<br />
contributions w'ill be discussed within EPAC, and papers put:<br />
to EPAC will be released for wider comm-unity comment.<br />
These contributions and the associated discussion will all<br />
be taken into account in the preparation of a draft white<br />
Paper on Taxation.<br />
The Government will then convene a National Taxation Summit<br />
during the third quarter of 1985, at which interested,<br />
parties will have an opportunity to comment on the draft<br />
Wh-ite Pacer and to suggest a~ ternative approaches. </p>
<p>57 ;-4a A<br />
Invitations to participate will be extEnded to all sections;<br />
of the business community including small business; the<br />
farming connunity; the trade union movement; weliare,<br />
consumer and other community groups; and representatives of'<br />
Federal, State and Local Governments.<br />
I would expect that if broad consensus were to emerge from<br />
the Tax Summit, the Government would announce a tax reform<br />
package towards the end of 1985. And I would expect a<br />
popular and widely accepted package to emerge from this<br />
consultative process.<br />
It would be quite inappropriate to pre--empt the consultative<br />
arrangements on the overall tax system that will proceed<br />
during 1985 by detailing a preferred Government position.<br />
It would be an insult to those who are participating in thE<br />
community discussion, and who will participate in the<br />
Summit. But without taking a position on any particular ta-x or<br />
package of taxes, I am today setting out nine firm<br />
principles which the Government will insist upon in the<br />
process of community consultation on the tax system, and in<br />
any tax reformn package.<br />
Nine Point Tax Review Principles<br />
First, there must be no increase in the overall tax<br />
burden, as measured by the share of Commonwealth<br />
Government tax revenue in gross domestic product, next<br />
year or through the Government's next term in office.<br />
Second, any reform must continue the process already<br />
begun by this Government, and provide further cuts in<br />
personal income tax.<br />
* Third, taxation changes must. contr: ibute to smashing tax,<br />
avoidance and evasion, which remain as features of the<br />
tax system which the Government inherited.<br />
Fourth, any reform must lead to a simpler system, which<br />
therefore all Aust'ralians can understand more easily,<br />
and which therefore makes tax avoidance and evasion more<br />
difficult. Fifth, any reform package must result in a tax system<br />
which is fairer, so that Australian~ s are only required<br />
to pay tax according to their capacity to pay, and the<br />
overall system must be progressive.<br />
Sixth, any tax reform must riot disadvantage recipients<br />
of welfare benefits, and should reduce or remove<br />
" 1poverty traps". </p>
<p>Seventh, if any reform package which includes changes in<br />
indirect taxes is contei'plated, it must be acceptable to<br />
the various groups in the Austral4an community whose<br />
response will determine whether we can maintain<br />
moderation in wage movements.<br />
Eighth, any reform must provide the! best possible<br />
climate for investment, growth and employment in<br />
Australia. Ninth, any reform package must have widespread community<br />
support, including support at a widely representative<br />
National Tax Summit of economic orc'anisations and<br />
community groups.<br />
These are clear and unequivocal undertakings, which will<br />
give the people of Australia a basis for a clear decision on<br />
1 December.<br />
All nine principles are important to making Australia a more<br />
equitable society which is better able to overcome the<br />
structural barriers to strong, sustained non-inflationary<br />
growth. The first and seventh principles are absolutely crucial to<br />
our sustaining non-inflationary growth in the years<br />
immediately ahead.<br />
Given the Government's well-known and successful approach to<br />
economic management, the first principle requires further<br />
reductions in the deficit in the process of continued<br />
economic growth through expenditure restraint. We pledge<br />
ourselves to this result.<br />
The seventh principle is essential to the Government holding<br />
inflation on a downward path, which itself is crucial to<br />
maintaining strong growth in production and employment. We<br />
must do nothing as a nation to put at risk the hard-won<br />
gains in the fight against inflation over the past eighteen<br />
months. The opposition has claimed that the Government is committed<br />
to the introduct'ion of a capital gains tax, death an-j gift<br />
duties, and a wealth tax. Day in, day out, the Leader of<br />
the opposition has been making~ wild and unsubstantiated<br />
allegations to the Australian people on this issue and in<br />
the process making corrmunity acceptance of any geunine tax<br />
reform more difficult.<br />
In fact, as has been made clear cons istently, the Gc-JE= nment<br />
has taken no such position on these taxes.<br />
The only decisions it has taken~ are those that have hieern<br />
outlined today. </p>
<p>But some community views have al. ready been put to the<br />
Government on these issues, and as these will be fully taken<br />
into account in the review, and Fit the National Tax Summit,<br />
it is appropriate to refer briefly to them.<br />
There is a widespread view in the community that existing<br />
capital gains taxes i Australia should be reviewed, because<br />
they are unpredictable and arbitrary, and because they<br />
provide avenues for tax avoidance. Various suggestions for<br />
such changes have been put forward for consideration in a<br />
qualified way, including by the Business Council of<br />
Australia and the Confederation cof Australian Industry,<br />
largely to close off existing opportunities for tax<br />
avoidance. These groups have emphasised that any changes to<br />
the existing capital gains taxes should be considered only<br />
in the context of a package of reform measures.<br />
Whether the types of changes that: such -groups have presented<br />
for consideration represent the niost effective way of<br />
addressing the widely recognised shortcomings in the<br />
existing capital gains taxes is a m'atter for careful and<br />
cool analysis and community discussion outside the context<br />
of an election campaign.<br />
And a cool and careful analysis of the Government's nine tax<br />
review principles should put to rest the desperate<br />
inventions with which the Leader of the Opposition seeks to<br />
frighten the Australian people. A fairer system, a system<br />
which provides the best possible climate for investment,<br />
growth and employment and a system which strengthens the<br />
fight against tax avoidance and evasion in this country, is<br />
not one which taxes in any way the family home, or threatens<br />
the continued growth of farms and small businesses in this<br />
country. Indeed quite the contrary.<br />
The average taxpayers, and those who through their<br />
productive endeavours have underpinned and will continue to<br />
underpin economic growth in this country, must be<br />
encouraged, not discouraged, by our tax system. I give an<br />
unequivocal commitment that the Government will have no part<br />
of a tax reform which is not based on these conditions. </p>
<p>And this can only be done by shifting nauch more of the<br />
burden onto those who during the periodi that our opponents<br />
held office, cheated and deraudcd the country of taxation<br />
revenue.<br />
The politically expedient option, and t~ he one which our<br />
opponents have now chosen, would be to categor~ cally rule<br />
out certain taxes in any discussion of tax reform. But the!<br />
Australian public has been treated cyni , cally too many times<br />
by the Coalition parties, with their litany of false and<br />
broken promises on tax, to accept ano-ther such cynical<br />
political exercise.<br />
But let me make one point clear. The only group in the<br />
Australian community which has any reason to fear an<br />
overhaul of the tax system by this Labor Government is that<br />
group which, aided by the Coalition parties, has exploited<br />
the system in recent years through avoidance and evasion at<br />
the expense of the vast majority of Australian taxpayers.<br />
For what we must and will do is end the, day when a-small<br />
minority of the Australian people who can afford a smart<br />
lawyer and a slick accountant, and can rely on the Coalition<br />
parties to protect them, pay no tax while the average<br />
taxpayers pay too much.<br />
The Government's approach to an overhaul of th-e taxation<br />
system will allow for rational community discussion and<br />
involvement. We must make every effort to devise a system<br />
that is fairer for all Australians. We must make every<br />
effort to devise a system that promotes a stronger economy.<br />
We must avoid any changes that put at risk the improvements<br />
in Australia's economic performance over the past eighteen<br />
months, This will be the great challenge for the Labor<br />
Government and for the Australian community together in<br />
1985.<br />
As the Australian people will be deciding on 1 December<br />
which party they wish to govern Australia for the next three<br />
years, in outlining the Government's approach to tax policy<br />
it is also appropriate t-o remind the electorate of the<br />
Opposition's record.<br />
That record is highlighted by three features for which the<br />
electorate, rightly, will not forgive, and so will never<br />
trust the Coalition parties.<br />
First, the Coalition parties condoned the growth of the<br />
tax avoidance industry in Australia on an unprecedented<br />
scale. Reporting on the tax avoidance industry,<br />
Commissioner Costigan said in December 1981: </p>
<p>" This industry has developed in Australia, particularly<br />
over the last five years, at a rate far in excess of<br />
any cther iWd JZ'~ ny, and has brought with it profits<br />
comparable only'to the heady days of the Victorian<br />
rush. Unfortunately this industry carried with it a<br />
serious detriment to the interests of government and<br />
the Australian comr. unity The amounts involved<br />
are very large indeed, amounting to many hundreds of<br />
millions of dollars per year or more. The impact on<br />
the community has been very serious. It has introduced<br />
into the community a class of people, almost invariably<br />
the highest earners, who pay little or no tax and make<br />
no contribution in that way as citizens to their fair<br />
share of community costs. In addition it has made more<br />
difficult for government the task of providing for the<br />
community as a whole a more equitable and reduced<br />
taxation burden."<br />
By allowing a small and wealthy minority to avoid tax on<br />
this massive scale, the Coalition Government effectively<br />
imposed an undisclosed but massive supertax upon the<br />
majority of ordinary taxpayers in Australia. The<br />
Coalition parties in Opposition have continued their<br />
protection of the tax avoidance industry by repeatedly<br />
rejecting legislation designed to make tax cheats pay<br />
back what they owe to ordinary Australians.<br />
Second, without any warnings at preceding elections the<br />
Coalition Government imposed on the people of Australia a<br />
wide range of new taxes with substantial impact on<br />
average taxpayers.<br />
Third, the Coalition parties made promises of tax relief<br />
at election time and then, after the election, ruthlessly<br />
and shamelessly grabbed back the tax cuts. All<br />
Australians remember the " fistful of dollars" of the 1977<br />
election, which were taken back within months of their<br />
re-election.<br />
The Peacock-Howard-Sinclair combination, all of them parties<br />
to this fraud and deception of the Australian people in the<br />
last seven years of Libefal-National Party government,<br />
simply cannot and will not be trusted again by the<br />
Australian electorate on the issuE? of tax.<br />
And it is against this background of our opponents' total<br />
lack of credibility that the Government's consistent and<br />
conclusive approach to tax policy will be welcomed by the<br />
people of Australia. </p>
