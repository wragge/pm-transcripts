FOR PRESS P. M. No. 11/ 966<br />
CHANGEOVER TO DECIMAL CURRENCY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister. Mr. Harold Holt<br />
Tomorrow we arrive, after years of discussion, planning<br />
and organisation, at a landmark in our financial and commercial<br />
history. It marks the introduction of a new system of money<br />
dollars and cents which will finally bring this country into<br />
line with the vast majority of the world's people, 95 per cent.<br />
of whom already use decimal currency.<br />
The change will be closely watched by official<br />
observers from the United Kingdom and New Zealand. New " ealand<br />
will be introducing its own decimal currency system in 1967.<br />
The United Kingdom has understudied a report received from a<br />
special committee set up to report on the advisability of a<br />
decimal system for the United Kingdom.<br />
In Australia, the new currency will carry subst-ntial<br />
advantages in its train. For example<br />
Increased efficiency for Australian commerce and industry;<br />
Methods of teaching money arithmetic in the Australian<br />
schools will be streamlined and simplified. More time<br />
will be available for teachers and students to concentrate<br />
on other aspects of their work;<br />
Our exporters will " speak the same tongue" as most of their<br />
trading partners ana should be all the more welcome<br />
for it;<br />
Many migrants and tourists will be assisted by it.<br />
Not all of these factors will show themselves overnight.<br />
The greatest gains may take a number of years to slhw<br />
themselves fully. To many of us, decimal currency will seem<br />
somewhat strange for a time after the familiar pounds, shillings<br />
and pence. We should not become unduly concerned. Certainly<br />
nobody will automatically lose money in the conversion to decimal<br />
currency. This point seems to be worrying a number of people<br />
who apparently fee they will lose twopence in every shilling<br />
when their savings are converted to decimal currency.<br />
They may set their minds at rest on this point.<br />
It is not true. The misconception arises from the mistaken belief<br />
that because the one cent is the nearest full-cent value to<br />
one penny, a cent and a penny are exactly the same thing. But<br />
in fact they are significantly different one cent being worth<br />
4. ne and one-fifth pennies. This means that ten cents is worth<br />
exactly one shilling and not tenpence as some people seem to think.<br />
One shilling will be converted eyaotly into ten<br />
cents and ten shillings will be converted exactly into one dollar.<br />
There will be no loss to anybody on these conversions. / 2 </p>

Gains from Decimal Currency<br />
The nation has already made three important gains<br />
from decimal currency. First we have introduced much-needed coinage<br />
reform, which has 6rought a completely integrated set of coins<br />
of common sense size. We are going to find them much more<br />
cenvenient for our daily cash transactions.<br />
Secondly, we now have new and distinguished designs<br />
for our notes and coins, which more faithfully reflect the<br />
spirit of the nation.<br />
Thirdly, we have built a highly efficient Royal<br />
Australian Mint to help produce the new coins. Its performance<br />
is well up to expectation but it is proving an asset in another<br />
useful direction. In keeping with our " new look" coins and<br />
notes, the new Mint is a notable tourist attraction in Canberra,<br />
and is the enly Mint in the world which freely opens its front<br />
door and observation areas to the general public.<br />
The Cost of Decimal Currency<br />
Progress has its price and decimal currency must<br />
be paid for, particularly in the short term. Machine conversion,<br />
for example, will cost 54 million ( E27 million) the bulk of<br />
the changeover cost. However large though this figure appears,<br />
it is some LOmillion below the original official estimate of<br />
cost. There are some 500,000 machines to be converted to<br />
decimal eperation. They range from cash registers to taximeters<br />
from petrol pumps to adding machines. These will be<br />
converted in carefully planned, nationally co-ordinated programmes.<br />
This work is estimated to take up to two years,<br />
according to the business machine companies which have contractCd<br />
to carry it out. We believe however that the companies will be<br />
able to speed their worf and we Aepe that Australia will be<br />
operating solely in decimal currency some months before the twoyear<br />
period is up. We shall be doing what we can to achieve this.<br />
Tomorrow's Events Changeover day may produce some temporary inconveniences.<br />
Thesemay prove unavoidable in a change of this<br />
magnitude. The careful planning of the Decimal Currency Board,<br />
supplemented by parallel and co-ordinated planning in so many<br />
important sectors of the community, from banks to business houses,<br />
from retail stores to government departments should do much to<br />
minimise these. Changeover day should go smoothly, even quietly.<br />
If it does so, it will be a tribute to our maturity<br />
as a people who can welcome progress and can co-operate<br />
successfully for its achieement even when it brings the need<br />
for adjustment in our daily routines.<br />
