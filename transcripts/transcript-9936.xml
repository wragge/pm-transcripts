I PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
HEALTH POLICY LAUNCH, MELBOURNE, 6 FEBRUARY 1996<br />
At this election as in every election the Government seeks a new mandate<br />
from the people of Australia. We seek to re-establish the trust of the people<br />
of Australia to govern for another three year term.<br />
We are very proud of what we have done in the past three years. It has been<br />
a Government, I think, of great enterprise and purpose. And we have<br />
delivered those things we said we would deliver.<br />
But we know that, once again, we must convince the Australian people that<br />
the policies we have implemented, and the policies we propose, are the best<br />
policies for Australia. And that they will be delivered by the people who are<br />
best able to deliver them.<br />
A crucial element of the new mandate we seek is a mandate to maintain and<br />
extend Australia's universal health care system a health care system for all<br />
Australians. We ask Australians to invest their trust in us to protect and<br />
extend Medicare.<br />
And. as the pioneers of Medicare, we believe that Australians can extend<br />
their trust to us with confidence. We will defend Medicare. We will extend<br />
and improve it.<br />
Between now and March 2 the Australian people must make a decision about<br />
the kind of health system they want.<br />
Because health care is fundamental to the well-being of every Australian and<br />
every Australian family, because a fair and effective health care system is<br />
fundamental to our aspirations as a civilised society it will be a momentous<br />
decision.<br />
45~ 8.4 </p>
<p>Health care is an immensely complex issue in modem society and<br />
immensely expensive. In Australia it consumes more than 8 per cent of<br />
Gross Domestic Product. But the system we have developed is efficient. In<br />
the United States health care accounts for more than 14 per cent of GDP.<br />
and yet it leaves millions of peoole with no health insurance, or inadequate<br />
health insurance and. as a consequence, without decent health care.<br />
The Australian system is a good one and Labor will protect it.<br />
Countries have choices in health care. In Australia the choices have been<br />
argued for the last 20 years.<br />
The major political parties have come to the debate with two entirely different<br />
perspectives. More than twenty years ago, a Labor government made its<br />
andateposition clear when it introduced a system of universal health insurance<br />
. ndate kno'., vn as Medibank. The Coalition. in turn. showed its preference for a<br />
. eopleprivate system by ripping Meoibank down. When they left office in 1983,<br />
more than two million Austraiians had no health insurance.<br />
3s been The same divisions have characterised the debate ever since. Labor has<br />
rebuilt a universal health care system. Medicare is not perfect no system<br />
ever will be. But there are few better systems in the world. And we can make<br />
3 thatours better.<br />
-ie best The crucial thing is that all Australians are covered. That has been the<br />
ici areessential choice should all Australians be covered in a universal system, or<br />
should there be a two tiered system? A system with gilt edged services for<br />
iin andthose who can afford it and much poorer and less reliable services for those<br />
i no ad on lower incomes.<br />
, id Until now the Coalition has never disguised its preference for the two tiered<br />
system and its contempt for Medicare. At successive elections they have<br />
and vowed to pull Medicare apart and no one more consistently or virulently<br />
: tnd than John Howard.<br />
In fact they were the very words Mr Howard used in 1987 " I will pull it right<br />
) n about apart", he said. He would do things " that amount to its dle facto dismantling".<br />
He made no attempt to hide the fact of his ambitions for it. 1I would love to go<br />
back" to the pre-Medicare days, he said.<br />
* mi s ian andThat mistawkea, s iht iiss haims baimtiobnit ioinn 1n9o8w7.. It was his ambition in 1993. And, make no<br />
ientous This time he says he will keep Medicare. But we all know he won't. Jeff<br />
Kennett \-. ill turn his casiio into an Anclican mission before John Howard<br />
supports Medicare. </p>
<p>Over the last decade. Australians have said again and again that they want a<br />
universal system. and not an American style system. They have said it at five<br />
nationai elections. In the most recent Doils of cuolic ocinion over 85 oer cen:<br />
of them say they want Meoicare retaineo.<br />
And it is only for this reason that the Coalition are saying they will keep_<br />
Medicare. There it was in the newspaper advertisement placed by the Liberal candidate<br />
for Fremantle this week: Medicare is " a medical and moral scandal", he said.<br />
Anid there it was in the Financial Review yesterday:<br />
Coalition sources [ the report says] privately concede that Medicare is<br />
financially unsustainable in the medium term and that it is being<br />
embraced by the Coalition mainly because it is electorally popular.<br />
Not because they believe in it. Not because they will keep it. But because<br />
they think it will help them win the election if they pretend to support it.<br />
That is why we say the decision Australians make about health in this<br />
election will be a momentous one. This is the same fight to the death for<br />
Medicare as it has been at every election since 1984.<br />
Once again the election will decide the kind of health care system we will<br />
have over the next generation, and in so doing it will decide in large part the<br />
kind of society we leave our children. It will substantially determine the kind<br />
of country Australia will be.<br />
John Howard is saying that we are running a scare campaign on Medicare.<br />
Apparently we should take him at his word when he says he won't harm it.<br />
Well let me say even if we half believed him, or a quarter believed him we<br />
would be issuing the most dire warnings. But in fact we don't believe him at<br />
all. We pioneered Medicare. We nurtured and built it into one of the best health<br />
systems in the world. It was our baby and now it is Australia's health system.<br />
So no one should be surprised if we are passionate about defending it. N.<br />
Erect the two-tiered system Mr Howard wants; put the weight of the well-off<br />
into the pnivate health system, make the private system stronger than the * i<br />
public, and the public health system will start to crumble.<br />
Australia will then have an entirely different kind of health system a SNVV<br />
flourishing first rate pnivate industry for those who can afford it, and a second<br />
rate public system for those who ican't.<br />

<p>.4<br />
Lose universality, and essentially we lose Medicare.<br />
' hey want a<br />
aid it at five Lose Medicare, and we lose one of the great building blocks of fairness and<br />
per cent cohesion in Australian society.<br />
And it will not be a temporary loss. It will not be a little experiment which we<br />
keep can abandon if we don't like the way it's going. Pull away the universality of<br />
our health care system and you pull Medicare down.<br />
I candidate Fail to support it, say you support it while leaving the states to rip into the<br />
ihe said. health system, and you pull Medicare down. And when it's down, we will<br />
have lost one of our great social achievements and our children will inherit a<br />
very different Australia.<br />
edicare is It's a free choice. That's what an election is. But there must be no doubt<br />
eing about what the choice is between. At this election the Coalition are not<br />
opular. presenting policies, they are presenting tactics.<br />
because Their environment proposal was not a policy it was a tactic. A tactic to sell<br />
rt it. Telstra by bribing the environmental vote.<br />
: his Their industrial relations proposal was not a policy, it was a tactic a tactic to<br />
aath for drive wages and conditions down and undermine job security by embracing<br />
enough of the Government policy to neutralise the debate.<br />
we will Their health proposal is also a tactic a tactic to create the health system<br />
le part the they want by pretending to keep the health system they hate.<br />
e thekindBut even if we believed them, even if we believed that they had undergone a<br />
change of heart and were not merely heeding the polls for the purpose of<br />
/ ledicare. winning the election. even if we ignored the mountain of evidence from the<br />
harm it. past, their health proposal still constitutes a critical attack on the foundations<br />
of Medicare.<br />
. v him at The fact is they neither understand it nor like it. Medicare is hostile to the<br />
very basis of their thinking. And it is hostile to their friends in the private<br />
health care system.<br />
et heystm Mr Howard says he will leave Medicare alone. But leaving it alone is not<br />
ilth sstem. supporting Medicare. Leaving it to Jeff Kennett is not supporting Medicare.<br />
ng it. Nor is introducing tax rebates for private health insurance by itself supporting<br />
a well-off Medicare. Their tax rebates are designed to encourage people out of the<br />
ian the Medicare system. They are designed as much to be an industry policy as a<br />
health policy a policy for a private health care industry.<br />

Meoicare gives all Australians access to free first rate treatment in a public visit to<br />
hospital and affordable medical care from general practitioners. chiidre<br />
But Medicare generally does not help with the costs of dental and orthodontic The La<br />
treatment, or other services such as physiotherapy, speech therapy or public,<br />
chiropractic treatment. These health services can be very expensive for familie,.<br />
families, particularly the cost of dental care for children. But the only way Rebate<br />
families can get help with these costs is to take out private health insurance. childre familie<br />
Today I am announcing a new way for families to get assistance with these The Li<br />
costs. ak<br />
The new Family Health Rebate will be a cash payment from Medicare Offices Theirr<br />
to help meet the costs of dental and orthodontic treatment. physiotherapy, aoi<br />
speech therapy and other health services for children. mantor<br />
Families who receive Family Payments will be eligible for the rebate that is for thei<br />
about 80 per cent of all Australian families. Fra<br />
The maximum rebate in a year will be $ 350 for a family with one child and would<br />
$ 500 for a family with two or more children. hospitF<br />
Families will be able to claim 50 per cent of the cost of dental and other The acheaith<br />
services for children up to the maximum rebates. choice take u<br />
The Medicare system is a balanced system providing for people who take outAsIz<br />
private insurance. Because private heaith insurance is a major cost to As. I s<br />
famrilies, a flat rebate of $ 350 will be available towards the cost of health i. Yi<br />
insurance premiums. T his S350 will te countec towards a family's maximumUne<br />
rebate. billion<br />
An important element of the new rebate is that, if a family does not claim their hospit;<br />
maximum rebate in one year. they will be able to carry over unused rebatesOvrt<br />
for up to seven years. This will help families plan ahead and cope with large Ovce f<br />
bills, for orthodontic treatment for example. flrm4<br />
The strength of the Family Health Rebate is the choice it gives families in<br />
meeting the health needs of their children. Howev<br />
servic(<br />
Many families around 40 per cent already take out health insurance and<br />
these families will be able to claim $ 350 towards this cost. The pr<br />
their e<br />
Many other families would like to take out health insurance to better manage Comm<br />
health costs, but--find the premiums too high. A rebate of $ 350 will be a past tt<br />
substantial help.<br />
88 </p>
<p>Other families will be happy to remain in the public system. These families<br />
just need help with the costs not covered by Medicare. They will now be able<br />
to claim a rebate of 50 per cent of the cost of these services whether it is a<br />
Ic visit to the dentist or a physiotherapist or other health services so that their<br />
children can get the help they need when they need it.<br />
) ntic The Labor approach to health care is built on Medicare. We start with the<br />
public health system and ask how can we make it better. We start with<br />
families' needs and ask how can we best meet them. The Family Health<br />
Rebate extends public insurance to cover dental and health services for<br />
ice. children not presently picked up by Medicare. but at the same time allows<br />
families the choice to insure privately if they prefer.<br />
ie The Liberal approach to health care starts with the private health system and<br />
asks how they can give it more business, how they can boost its profits.<br />
: ices Their policy of tax rebates for private health insurance does nothing for the<br />
majority of families who do not have private health insurance and who do not<br />
want to take it up. These families will get no help with the extra health costs<br />
t is for their children.<br />
For families who choose to have private health insurance, the Liberals' policy<br />
would push up premiums by blowing out costs as specialists and private<br />
hospitals simply increase their fees to take advantage of the rebates.<br />
The advantage of Labor's Family Health Rebate is that, by giving families a<br />
choice, if health insurance premiums go up, people will vote will their feet and<br />
take up the alternative of the family health rebate.<br />
9 out As I said. it is not enough to say you support Medicare. You need to defend<br />
it. You need to extend it. And you need to protect it.<br />
ium Under the Medicare agreements, the Commonwealth provides about<br />
billion a year to the States and Territories for free patient care in public<br />
their hospitals.<br />
. re Over the past few years, under the agreements, the Commonwealth has<br />
3rge increased its funding by 26 per cent, which has taken our share of funding<br />
from 47 per cent to 55 per cent.<br />
However, this has not resulted in the reduced waiting times and improved<br />
services we intended and the Australian people have every right to expect.<br />
rid The principal reason for this shortfall hos been t'-e Staes' 0 pe-: tcut in<br />
their expenditure on public hospitals-l10 per cent in real terms. VVrnile the<br />
age Commonwealth has put in an extra $ 800 million to public hospitals over the<br />
past three years,-Ahe States have taken out $ 700 million from public health. I 0,1 </p>
<p>The problem is that the Medicare agreements are basically " gentlemen's It is PC<br />
agreements". by which I mean they are not tied to performance or achieving make<br />
better results for their oatients. We neec a new caninershio cetweer. the With<br />
States and the Commonwealt., on iinairg for puolic nospitals. We need zo<br />
relate funding to performance, to better results in health care. We want to To str(<br />
see what we are paying for. haer<br />
The most important result we want to see is Australians having to wait no " L1awbaotcrhlonger<br />
for surgery than their doctors recommend.<br />
A Labor Government will offer the States and Territories an additional $ 150 TeA<br />
million over the next two years to reduce substantially the number of patients ties. c<br />
waiting longer than the time deemed clinically appropriate. trivati<br />
But to be eligible for the new funding, the States will need to achieve a protec<br />
reduction in the number of patients waiting too long for surgery. We will only I beg<br />
pay on performance, on results. States will only qualify for their full share of tegait<br />
the $ 150 million if they ensure patients are treated within times recommendedthvi<br />
by doctors. Toa<br />
This new approach to funding will form the basis of new Medicare the wa<br />
Agreements to be negotiated with the States. The new Agreements will look Electic<br />
at the overall performance of public hospitals, with performance on waiting<br />
lists being one very important area. A h<br />
But attacking waiting lists without looking more generally at performance abolitik<br />
could be counter-productive. For example, hospitals could reduce waiting $ 1.3 b<br />
lists quite easily by forcing patients out of hospitals too soon in order to save per ce<br />
money. Just tv.<br />
The new funding arrangements will include other targets for quality health<br />
care, such as how long patients wait for emergency treatment: the number of<br />
unplanned readmissions to hospital: and the links between hospital and other<br />
services such as community care and general practitioners.<br />
The new approach to funding will particularly benefit older people who are In othe<br />

To strengthen confidence in the public hospitals. the community needs to<br />

Labor will establish an independent Hospital Services Authority to be a<br />

tentstimes. It will also report on the effect on patients of any proposed<br />
privatisation of the public hospital services. The public interest must be<br />
protected in any contracting out and privatisation.<br />
only I began by saying that in this election we ask Australians to entrust us with<br />
* e of<br />
indled the vital task of protecting Medicare and our universal health care system.<br />
Today we ask to be given the opportunity to extend it and make it stronger in<br />
the ways I have outlined.<br />
look Elections are about choices. On health the choice could not be clearer.<br />
ng At the last election our opponents went to the people with a policy for the<br />
abolition of bulk billing for more than 13 million Australians, a cut of at least<br />
-lig $ 1.3 billion in Commonwealth funding for public hospitals and a more than<br />
save per cent cut in the Medicare rebate.<br />
Just two months ago Mr Howard said this:<br />
, h I don't accept for a moment that we went to the last election as Paul<br />
er of Keating alleges promising to abolish Medicare: that is wrong, we<br />
other didn't. We promised to make changes but not to abolish it, he said.<br />
re In other words, we were going to remove Medicare's heart and soul but we<br />
were not going to abolish it. We did not intend to kill it only to make it dead.<br />
And Mr Howard asks to be believed about Medicare. He asks Australians to<br />
e entrust their health care system to him. He asks us to believe he will deal<br />
effectively with State Governments. He asks us to believe that on health he<br />
has had a change of heart and not just a change of tactic.<br />
sitter. He asks us to believe that his proposal for the people's health is not simply a<br />
d~ is cyr. tcal deceit.<br />
The fact is they cannot with a skerrnck of credibility ask to be trusted with<br />
I Medicare and the health of the Australian people. ' 1F 9) 1 </p>
<p>9<br />
With the release of this policy, Labor asks Australians to continue to put their<br />
trust with the people and the party who dreamed of Medicare. who made it a<br />
reaity, who are still expanding and imoroving it and who believe it is<br />
funcam= ntal to our gooc society. Ne1<br />
