MEDIA RELEASE FLINDERS BY-ELECTION<br />
( Statement by the Acting Prime Minister, the<br />
Rt Hon J. D. Anthony, M. P.)<br />
I congratulate Mr Peter Reith on his election as the<br />
new Member for Flinders.<br />
In the current difficult economic climate, and taking<br />
account of normal by-election trends, the result in Flinders is<br />
a very good one indeed for Mr Reith and the Government.<br />
The Flinders campaign was fought largely on national<br />
issues. In supporting Mr Reith, the people of Flinders have<br />
maintained their support for the Government's firm and decisive<br />
response to the effects in Australia of economic problems<br />
being felt around the world, and rejected the proposals of the<br />
Labor Party. I believe the Government's call for a 12-month pause<br />
in wage rises, to ease growing unemployment pressures and boost<br />
Australia's international competitiveness, has had a significant<br />
bearing on the result in Flinders.<br />
I very much hope that is noted by the State Premiers,<br />
whose backing for a 12-month wage pause I will be seeking at the<br />
Premiers Conference in Canberra this week.<br />
