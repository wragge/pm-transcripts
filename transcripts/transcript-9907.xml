JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE AT THE SHANORI LA MOTEL,<br />
SINGAPORE, 17 JANUARY 1996<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
GOI-: Yes, good morning ladies and gentlemen. Prime Minister<br />
Paul Keating and I had a good meeting this morning. We ranged<br />
over many subjects. We discussed developments in the region and<br />
also bilateral matters. On bilateral matters the principle point which<br />
I am making this morning is we will be issuing a Joint Declaration<br />
on a New Partnership.<br />
Our relations are very good. We have been doing many things<br />
together. But we thought we can do more if we were to collect our<br />
thoughts, put them on a piece of paper and decide on the focus<br />
and where to focus In the years ahead.<br />
The Joint Declaration will be issued to you and I will stop over here<br />
so you can ask questions on what we will be doing and on such<br />
matters that are of Interest to you. You can address questions to<br />
Prime Minister Keating or myself.<br />
J: Prime Minister Goh, can you elaborate on this New Partnership<br />
scheme. How will it benefit for Singapore, Australia and the region<br />
and what does It mean to them?<br />
GOH: Well, basically, there are several pillars In this Joint Dec. laratIon<br />
political, security, social, economic. On the economic side we<br />
would. of course, be encouraging Singaporeans to invest In<br />
Australia and Australia to trade more with Singapore. We would<br />
also be working together to Invest in third countries like Indonesia,<br />
so it would benefit the Indonesians. And when Indonesia grows the<br />
economy will also affect Singapore and Australia Wn a positive way.<br />
J: Mr Goh, this week you gave an interview with the suggestion that<br />
Australia might one day be a part of ASEAN. Do you suggest a </p>
<p>T1EL7: . Jan. 96 18: 13 No. 021 P. 02/<br />
2<br />
possible timetable for that whether 2010, 2020 and what sort of<br />
hurdles, what sort of benchmarks, does Australia have to meet In<br />
order to become a partner?<br />
GOH: I would like to put my remarks in context. I was asked a question<br />
by The Australian Financial Review whether I foresee Australia<br />
joining ASEAN one day. My reaction was, it is an idea which is<br />
thinkable and Indeed it is a thinkable idea of the horizon. But since<br />
this is an over the hoilion idea, there Is no timeframe In my mind,<br />
there is rno immediate proposal, we did not discuss this, Australia<br />
has not Indicated that it would wish to join ASEAN at this point of<br />
time, and neither have I discussed this with anybody else. So it is<br />
just something which is over the horizon.<br />
In that same interview, Mr Goh, you also praised Mr Keating's<br />
leadership, In the coming election in Australia, would you be sorry<br />
to see Mr Keating go?<br />
PJK: Well, of course, he would. That is why I am here.<br />
GOH: As I have said In the interview, I mean in a personal sense, I would<br />
be sorry to see anybody go and I know Paul Keating very well and<br />
as I told the interviewer, we have got the same vision for the region,<br />
we have got the same stature, we have got the same height..<br />
PJK: You are a bit taller.<br />
GOH: and I like him as a person very much.<br />
PJK: And I like you too.<br />
GOH: Thank you.<br />
J: Mr Goh, the visit to Malaysia by Mr Keating was a very important<br />
one. You are used to the regional dialogue, the nuances with<br />
Malaysia, how do you assess the success or otherwise of that trip'?<br />
GOH: Well I read the reports in the newspapers that said it went very well<br />
and I am very pleased that the meeting of Prime Minister Keating<br />
went very well in Kuala Lumpur. It is Important that bilateral<br />
relations between any country In the region are strong and certainly<br />
we want to see strong relations between Malaysia and Australia,<br />
Australia and Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, and so on. It is<br />
good for the region.<br />
J: ~ Prime* Minister, do you feel there was some movemnent in the<br />
relationship over the last few days between Malaysia and<br />
Australia? TEL </p>

GOH: Oh from what I have read, 6ertalnly there is movement.<br />
PJK: There is a fine calibration, yqu see, in our lot. They are into the<br />
millimetres of movement, you see.<br />
J: Mr Keating, can you tell us what the main message that you will be<br />
trying to* get across In your Lecture this afternoon?<br />
PJK: Well, I think, rather than me try and anticipate that, it Is a complex<br />
number of Issues there the bilateral relationship that exists<br />
between Australia and Singapore. The principle focus of it is the<br />
way in which the world has changed after the Cold War,<br />
regionalism and t role of regionalism In shaping world events<br />
and, of course, events within regions. It is a very great opportunity<br />
and I was very pleased to be asked and regard it as an honour to<br />
be able to speak at some length about these subjects.<br />
J: Mr Keating, can you comment on the Australian-Singapore New<br />
Partnership? What Is your view?<br />
PJK: Well, I think, in relationships between longstanding friends and we<br />
are longstanding friends there is always, I think, some tendency to<br />
know where the other party is and take them for granted and<br />
believe you understand where they are. And, I think, It Is a good<br />
thing that we stop, pause, occasionally and think about where we<br />
are going and write down what we want to do together. And the<br />
Prime Minister and I have had very great pleasure indeed in<br />
working together both bilaterally and multilaterally and the role that<br />
Singapore plays in this region, Australia's role here too, the things<br />
we have done together in multilateral bodies such as APEC, our<br />
role with ASEAN and the Regional Forum, these sorts of issues,<br />
these are all things which I think that Singapore and Australia have<br />
been able to do together, And just to recite what we have been<br />
doing in APEC, what we are seeking to do with AFTA and<br />
Australasia, our cooperation In the security Issues of the Regional<br />
. Forum, our reaffirmation of our commitment to the Five Power<br />
Defence Arrangements, these are Important statements, I think, of<br />
Where we stand on key issues and, I think, they are very Important<br />
to the peoples of both of our countries, In terms of security, the<br />
Five Power Defence Arrangements the reaffirmaton of them is<br />
important to Singaporeans, I think, as they are to Australians and<br />
the recital of our commitments on economic policy are important to<br />
our communities. And as the Prime Minister remarked in response<br />
to the question about my visit to Malaysia, Malaysia Is also a party<br />
to the Five Power Defence Arrangements and the fact that we all<br />
have a shared commitment to the region, to its prosperity, to its<br />
peace, is an important demonstration of regionalismi the subject I<br />
am addressing some time this afternoon. So these are the Issues<br />
which, I think, are of value to Singaporeans and to Australians. </p>

J: Mr Goh, during your visit to Australia In 1993 there was a fund that<br />
was set up by both Australia and Singapore to help the private<br />
sector Invest in third countries. How does this New Partnership go<br />
further then that?<br />
GOH: Well. I think, on this Saturday, two parties Australia and Singapore<br />
will be signing another agreement which is on provision of training<br />
to personnel from third countries so that Is In advance over what we<br />
decided to do when we were In Australia.<br />
J: Mr Goh. what is your view on Australia signing of the defence treaty<br />
with Indonesia?<br />
GOH: It Is a good thing, we believe that security has been enhanced in<br />
the region with the signing of this agreement. We believe In a web<br />
of relations between countries, so there can be several tiers in<br />
relations and this'represents another tier of relationships which will<br />
strengthen the overall regional security for the region. We welcome<br />
it.<br />
J; Mr Keating, is there a direct comparison, or any particular<br />
comparison, between the agreements signed with Indonesia last<br />
month and the agreement with Singapore?<br />
PJK Well the agreement with Singapore Is a recital and statement of our<br />
contemporary situation and outlook which encompasses some of<br />
our recent economic history and asserts and reaffirms our<br />
commitment to shared security arrangements In the area.<br />
Of course Australia had no such fundamental agreements with<br />
Indonesia and the fact that we now have one which goes to security<br />
issues, means as the Prime Minister said when speaking about a<br />
web it is a web of regional association and cooperation.<br />
And, therefore, the agreement with Indonesia does, I think, as the<br />
Prime Minister has said, it makes the whole area more secure. It<br />
was very much a declaration about the trust between Australia and<br />
Indonesia and that kind of declaration must give a very good signal<br />
to the whole region. So what we are doing in the declaration today<br />
Is pausing and thinking and stating, again, the things that we have<br />
in common, the objectives we share, which are consistent with and<br />
completely compatible the agreement, for instance, which<br />
Australia has made with Indonesia.<br />
J: Mr Keating. do you expect to sign similar agreements with other<br />
Asian nations, you've signed one with Tokyo etc? It has been a<br />
consistent theme of yours to develop ' anew vision. If so, what sort<br />
of countries would you see next on your list? </p>
<p>T1EL7:. Jan. 96 18: 13 No. 021<br />
PJK: No, there Isn't a list. I mean, there i6 a naturalness about all of<br />
these and they have come for natural and good reasons.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you have always said that to go forward in Asia,<br />
Australia needs to be a republic. in that context, ls the decision by<br />
the New South Wales Government to downgrade the role of<br />
Governor a good step?<br />
PJK: Well, I think, we will deal with domestic, constitutional arrangements<br />
In New South Wales, when we are back In New South Wales.<br />
J: Prime Minister, has Australia had to sacrifice Its commitment to the<br />
pursuit of improved human rights and greater democracy to gain<br />
acceptance In this region?<br />
P1K: No, I mean I am on the record on that on many occasions and the<br />
references have mostly been about Timor and I don't think anybody<br />
who is near the subject belee that Australia is likely to have any<br />
influence beneficial, that is for the East Timorese in a stand-off<br />
with Indonesia. And I made it clear In Australia and I make it clear<br />
again, we are not about to make the Australia/ Indonesia<br />
relationship hostage to one issue. It is an issue I have discussed<br />
often with President Soeharto and it is one that needs to be dealt<br />
with in a framework. But, I think, Australia's democracy, its<br />
strength, its tolerance, are assets for its role in the region and they<br />
don't have to be compromised.<br />
J: Mr Keating, in regard to the hostages taken by Chechen rebels in<br />
southern Russia [ Inaudible]?<br />
PJK;-Oh, I don't think I can say anything new or profound about it. It is a<br />
European problem. It is a problem remote from this region.<br />
We feel the human tragedy very particularly and, I think, my own<br />
wish abou this is that, you know, commonsense allows some of<br />
these problems to be solved.<br />
J: Mr Keating, the recent purchase of Dreamworld by Singaporean<br />
Investors has met with some opposilin. Do-you think this will<br />
discourage Singaporeans from investing In Australia and, in the<br />
light of this, will you continue to pursue your pro-Asia policy with the<br />
some vigour?<br />
PJK: Oh yes. I don't think there is anything superstitious about<br />
Singaporean investors not at all. And I think some hand wringing<br />
in the Australian financial press will not put them off will not put<br />
them off,<br />

Partnership is attached] </p>

SA JOINT DECLARATION BY THE PRIME MINISTERS OF<br />
AUSTRALIA AND SINGAPORE<br />
1 After our discussions in Singapore in March 1995, we asked our senior<br />
officials to conduct a comprehensive review of the relationship between Singapore<br />
and Australia.<br />
2 By this Declaration, we now wish to give formal recognition to the new<br />
partnership that has grown up between Australia and Singapore in recent years, and<br />
to signal its future direction and purpose.<br />
3 Australia and Singapore share a common view of the strategic<br />
environment, globally and in the Asia Pacific region. We are committed to<br />
achieving free and open international trade and investment. We both see the United<br />
States' presence and strategic engagement in the region as being of tfundamental<br />
importance to the peace and prosperity of the region.<br />
4 We also have substantial and growing bilateral links, especially in the<br />
commercial sector and through people-to-people ties. Our long-standing dcfence<br />
cooperation has reinforced regional stability.<br />
These are the foundations of our new partnership.<br />
6 The end of the Cold War, changes in strategic relations between great<br />
powers in the Asia Pacific region, the shift in the centre of gravity of global<br />
economic activity from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and the associated dynamism of<br />
East Asian economies, present new opportunities as well as uncertainties and<br />
challenges. 7 Our common objective is to ensure that we have in place international<br />
and regional institutions which underpin our shared political, economic and security<br />
interests. </p>
<p>8 . For both Australia and Siapore, the significance of this partnership<br />
goes beyond its importance in their bilateral relationship. For Australia, it is a very<br />
important clement in its engagement with the Southeast Asian region. For<br />
Singapore, it is a recognition of the value it places on Australia's role in regional<br />
affairs. 9 Our partnership will give further impetus to the development of a<br />
coniunity of comprehensive cooperation between the countries of Southeast Asia<br />
and Australia and New Zealand.<br />
To sustain this new partnership, and to build on its objectives Ausumlia<br />
and Singapore accordingly declare.,<br />
We are committed to strengthening APEC, recognising<br />
its status as the premier institution in the Asia Pacific<br />
region. We. ame determined to achieve the practical<br />
ful~ filment and implementation of the Bogor Declaration<br />
and its time-table.<br />
We will work together to see that APflC liberalisation Is<br />
matched by global tad liberalisation. We will<br />
cooperate towards augmenting the WT( Ys role, starting<br />
with the lced up to Singapore's hostg of the 1996<br />
WTO Ministerial Meeting.<br />
We will cooperate in forging linkages, between APTA<br />
and CER<br />
We will cooperate to ensure the success of the ASEAN<br />
Regional Fo= 4m the Asia Pacific's regional security<br />
organisaxion.<br />
-We affrm our shared commitment to the Five Power<br />
Defence Arrangements. The active commitment of all<br />
members will ensure its continuing role as a credible<br />
element in the security architecture of the region.<br />
We welcome the extensive broadening of bilateral<br />
defence cooperation in the last five years. Noting the<br />
benefits to Australian industry which are expected to </p>
<p>follow from the training of Singapore Armed Forces ini<br />
Australia, we agree also to explore further the prospects<br />
for long-term defence industry cooperation.<br />
-We recognise -that cnhanced economic cooperation is in<br />
our mutual interest, and could be of benefit to the region.<br />
Complementarities in our resource endowments, capital<br />
availability and technology usage offer real scope fbr<br />
cooperative ventures. To this end, we agree that:<br />
Our commitment to economic cooperation<br />
embraces both bilateral opportunities and joint<br />
projects that benefit third countries in the region.<br />
Our aim is to eahance and diversify bilateral trade<br />
and investment and joint investment in third<br />
countries. The role of our Governments is primarily to*<br />
facilitate partnerships between Australian and<br />
Singapore companies which meet these criteria.<br />
The process, already undarway, of drawing each<br />
other's attention to specific investment<br />
opportunities will continue.<br />
Our collaboration may include technical<br />
cooperation through joint training programmes<br />
with third countries.<br />
Economic cooperation also includes collaboration<br />
in research and development in areas where both<br />
countries have compatible technological<br />
capabilities, where we can add value by working<br />
together, and where there are prospects for shared<br />
commercial outcomes.<br />
We will encourage the Singapore Australia Business<br />
Alliance Forum's work in identifying and implementing<br />
opportunities that meet the above criteria.<br />
We will work to improve dilalogue and contact between<br />
our Govermnent agencies in the economic and financial<br />
areas. Importanit issues of public policy which would </p>
<p>benefit from an enhanced dialogue include: public<br />
finance, including budget management issues;<br />
superannuation and retirement income systems; and<br />
competition policy.<br />
We are committed to promoting mutual understanding<br />
through expanded cultural exchanges and more peopleto-<br />
people links. In this way we contribute to a broader<br />
sense of community and cooperation in a region of<br />
cultural diversity.<br />
11 We agree to establish a Joint Ministerial Committne to be led by our<br />
respective Foreign, Ministers. The Committee will meet once every two years and<br />
each side would be represented by at least three Ninisters reflecting the range of<br />
bilateral cooperation.<br />
