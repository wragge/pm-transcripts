    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, will visit Australia from 18 to 22 October.</p>
<p>Australia was amongst the very first countries to recognise the newly independent Bangladesh in 1971. We are both members of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Australia and Bangladesh have cooperated on development issues since Bangladeshâs inception. Many Bangladeshis are studying in our universities and colleges. Bilateral trade has trebled over the last four years to $332 million annually. There are good opportunities now for both Australian and Bangladesh exporters to expand their markets in each otherâs country and to strengthen our investment linkages. Of course our two countries also share a love of cricket.</p>
<p>I look forward to Sheikh Hasinaâs visit as an opportunity to enhance Australiaâs ties with Bangladesh and to discuss current regional issues.</p>
