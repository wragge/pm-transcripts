    <content><![CDATA[<p>The 2009 Prime Minister's Prize for Science has been awarded to Dr John O'Sullivan.</p>
<p>The award and $300,000 grant recognises Dr O'Sullivan's contributions to astronomy and to the invention which made wireless computing practical.</p>
<p>While looking for exploding black holes Dr O'Sullivan created a technology that cleaned up intergalactic radio waves.</p>
<p>Then in 1992, he and his colleagues at CSIRO realised that the same technology was the key to fast reliable wireless networking in the office and home.</p>
<p>Their patented invention is now built into international standards and into computers, printers, smart phones and other devices used by hundreds of millions of people every day.</p>
<p>It's one of the most significant achievements in CSIRO's 83 year history and illustrates how blue sky research can have very practical outcomes.</p>
<p>Professor O'Sullivan is now working on the design of the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder telescope - a step towards the giant Square Kilometre Array which will be able to look back 13 billion years, almost to the Big Bang.</p>
<p>The $50,000 Prime Minister's Prize for Excellence in Science Teaching in Primary Schools has been awarded to Western Australian teacher Mr Allan Whittome.</p>
<p>Mr Whittome believes that primary science should be all about the experience. He ensures that the science program at Badgingarra Primary School is integrated into the whole curriculum and is not seen as a subject in isolation. Consequently the children see science as a part of life and not just something that is done at school. It's a philosophy he is also introducing to other primary teachers in his region.</p>
<p>The $50,000 Prime Minister's Prize for Excellence in Science Teaching in Secondary Schools has been awarded to Mr Len Altman, a science and geoscience teacher at Marden Senior College in Adelaide.</p>
<p>Mr Altman is leading a resurgence in geoscience teaching in South Australia. It's a science needed not just for the mining and minerals industries but also offers an understanding of the challenges of water security and climate change. His classes include mature age students and recent migrants who, with his help, are finding new careers in geoscience.</p>
<p>Science has a vital role in helping Australia develop a sustainable future. These awards recognise and celebrate these quiet achievers who are both changing the world, and creating the next generation of curious minds.</p>
<p>Congratulation to all recipients of this year's prizes.</p>
