TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH GRAEME DOBELL, ABC 16 NOVEMBER 1994<br />
TRANSCRIBED BY DEPT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
ANNOUNCER: According to Mr Keating, the Asia Pacific free trade agreement,<br />
announced In Indonesia last night will change the way that Australians live, and it<br />
marks the start of what he's calling, the " Pacific Century". The Malaysians, however,<br />
are again trying to rain on the Prime Minister'sparade by pointing out that the free<br />
trade timetable Is non-binding. The 18 APEC leaders have set out a timetable to<br />
slash tarif by 2010 or 2020 at the latest. And they have agreed to meet again In<br />
Japan next year to finalise the details. Last night, after the Bogor signing, Paul<br />
Keating spoke to " AM's" Grasme Dobell.<br />
DOBELL: Prime Minister, why for Australians do you think, perhaps a sense of<br />
triumph, perhaps some sense of euphoria?<br />
KEATING: Yes, I think this Is genuinely an occasion for same euphoria. Australia,<br />
for all of Its; history, has been largely by itself, had this question of Imperial<br />
preference. Many years ago, in its earlier trade relationship with Britain, that was<br />
mostly about British products coming to Australia at Its; height. Largely, we've been<br />
trading by ourselves, on our own, making bilateral relations or relationships. This is<br />
a multilateral structure. This Is the first time that Australia has ever belonged to a<br />
community of countries where It would enjoy the opportunity of trade without tariff<br />
and non-tariff barriers. So this puts us at a permanent seat at the largest table we've<br />
ever sat at.<br />
DOBELL: How would you say to Australians that they might live differently or work<br />
differently under this free trade agreement? </p>
<p>KEATING: I think it means, for a start, more jobs, more wealth, more interesting<br />
jobs, greater frequency of arrangements and visits. etc to the region. It will change<br />
the way in which Australia, not only does business, but the way it lives. This Is one<br />
of the big changes In the post-War world. And what is particularly unusual about it Is<br />
most things, like the European Union, are with countries that are largely of<br />
equivalent development. This is so different because you've got the big economies,<br />
like the United States and Japan, in with developing economies, like Indonesia, and<br />
probably later Vietnam, Papua New Guinea<br />
DOBELL: On that point,' can a state, like the United States, have free trade with Its<br />
economic foes with China, with Japan?<br />
KEATING: Thats the enormity of the change. I mean, the President of the United<br />
States knows what he's committing himself to. It's a competent country. It knows<br />
what the draft means, and the draft is very explicit about free trade. And the<br />
Chinese know what It means. So this Is why, I think, the agreement is so<br />
breathtaking. DOBELL How much store do you put by the standstill, by this commitment to<br />
actually not making any more protection Increases? How Important Is that to you as<br />
a starting point?<br />
KEATING: I think that's important, but bear In mind this. I'm quite sure that the<br />
Uruguay Round, the GATT the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, as<br />
important as that Is, I don't think would have happened without the APEC meeting<br />
having met In Seattle last year. I think when the Europeans saw APEC coming<br />
together, they said, what have we got to do here to sign up, lest there's a preferential<br />
bloc developed In the Asia Pacific. Now that didn't happen, but the people involved<br />
with APEC were committed to the Uruguay Round, we reaffirmed it again today the<br />
early ratification of the Uruguay Round. So you don't do those things and then start<br />
increasing protection again. So that's why the standstill is no worse. No increases<br />
in protection has, I think, credibility.<br />
DOBELL: You've had a couple of meetings over this in the last day and a half with<br />
Dr Mahathir. You talk about commitments. You say that these commitments are<br />
stronger perhaps than GATT or the G-7. He says that they're not binding. How far<br />
apart are those positions? </p>
<p>3<br />
KEATING: That's for him to make his judgment about that's for him to say where<br />
his country stands. But all of us have got to make judgments about this factor the<br />
countries with lower protection develop faster, and the reason they do is they<br />
generally attract more Investment You can put your hand up and say, we're not<br />
going to reduce protection. I think investors say, therefore, the propensity of us to<br />
invest In you will be less therefore, you will grow less. We've all got that choice.<br />
But the choice of the people at this meeting today was to commit themselves to a<br />
very explicit set of undertakings, like from the text I'll read to you now. These words,<br />
" We further agree to announce our commitment to complete the achievement of the<br />
goal of free trade In the Asia Pacific no later than 2020". ' The operative words there,<br />
" we further agree to complete". This is an executive decision.<br />
DOBELL So APEC moves on from a consensus to some sort of executive body<br />
now? Some sort of leaders' executive Cabinet-type sort of approach?<br />
KEATING: This is like a Cabinet decision, but a Cabinet decision of Prime Ministers<br />
and Presidents. That's, In fact, what it Is, and that wiil then be fleshed out at the next<br />
meeting of the APEC leaders In Osaka In Japan In 1995. So it Is, I think, a very<br />
enthusias'tic support for this today, and you can feel the moment of the meeting.<br />
People knew that they ware doing something because you have got to go back a<br />
long way to find the equivalent of this. Maybe it was with the Bretton Woods<br />
agreements after the War, maybe it was with the IMF and the World Bank that's the<br />
last time you had a very large agreement across more than one region. That was<br />
nearly 50 years ago.<br />
DOBELL: Finally, you said that this was the most important thing you've been<br />
involved with. What would you say to the Australians listening to this about why you<br />
think it matters to them?<br />
KEATING: Nov spent a decade of my life with my colleagues, opening Australia up,<br />
making it more competitive, introducing the culture of productivity, seeing a shift to<br />
manufactures, a shift to exports. But we needed the mechanisms we are running<br />
into very high levels of trade protection, both tariff and non-tariff barriers around<br />
various parts of the Asia Pacific. Sixty per cent of our exports go to this region, so<br />
we just had to prepare the structures in Asia for ourselves, and contribute to the<br />
preparation of those structures. So I see it as very much as an extension of my work<br />
through the ' SO&amp; to not only make Australia an International place, but to give it<br />
internationalI opportunities. I don't think any of us could have believed we could </p>
<p>have got this together in two-and-a-half years. And the fact that other leaders saw<br />
the opportunity and seized It that sense of opportunity. You see, the Cold War<br />
bound so many countries together in a sense, fear of the other camp. With that<br />
gone, this has just come from a spirit of cooperation. This speaks volumes, I think,<br />
about the future of human history in this part of the world.<br />
