* Speech by the Acting Prlne. f&amp; Un-1ter and Minister for Trade<br />
and Resources, the Rt. Hon. J. D. Anthony, at the<br />
Official Opening of the 6th Macquarie Merino Field Days,<br />
Warren, Saturday, 9th February,* 1980<br />
I am pleased to be with you here this evening at the<br />
Sixth Macquarie Mlerino Field Days. First of all, I commend<br />
the organisers of the Field Days for the interesting and<br />
varied programme which has-been arranged over these two<br />
days, and for the enormous amount of work they have put into<br />
the preparation. The Macquarie Merino Field Days are one of the most<br />
important events in the annual calendar of the Australian<br />
wool industry. The Warren/ Trangie district is one of the<br />
major high quality sheep-breeding areas in Australia, and it<br />
includes some of the most famous studs that have helped<br />
build this great industry. I am also heartened to see that<br />
more recently-established studs are participating in the<br />
field days, and helping to continue the high standard of<br />
breeding which has charactjrised this area for so many<br />
years. Days such as these provide an important and necessary<br />
opportunity for woolgrowers to examine sheep from some of<br />
the most important merino studs in Australia. They also<br />
provide an opportunity for an examination of the latest<br />
developments in sheep equipment and technology.<br />
The Government is very conscious of the importance of<br />
maintaining a strong and efficient Australian sheep and wool<br />
industry. The wool industry alone contributes more than<br />
per cent of Australia's total export earnings,, and it is<br />
expected that wool export earnings in 1979/ 80 will top a record<br />
$ 1,700 million. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics has<br />
forecast that auction prices for wool in 1979/ 80 will on<br />
average be 11 14+ per cent higher than those of last season.<br />
The buoyant conditions for wool prices are now being 3tflected<br />
in higher returns for stud sheep and I understand tha-, at<br />
the recent Adelaide and Perth ram sales, prices were about<br />
per cent up on last year. I am hopeful that on the<br />
trends so far, the sheep and wool industry will have a very<br />
good year in 1980. / 2 </p>
<p>Although the outlook for the industry is buoyant, there<br />
are immediate problems which have to be overcome. The<br />
Government fully shares the industry's concern at the continuatiov:<br />
of the present strike by the Storemen and Packers Union,<br />
which has stopped movement of wool from stores throughout<br />
the country. This dispute is currently before the Conciliation<br />
and Arbitration Commission and the continuation of the<br />
strike is not helping to achieve settlement of-the issue.<br />
As we have said so many times before, the procedures ofi<br />
. the Arbitration System should be allowed to work without the<br />
economically damaging effect of strikes.<br />
A problem of fundamental-concern to all Australians at<br />
present is the instability which has been introduced into<br />
the world political and economic situation by the Soviet<br />
invasion of Afghanistan. The Australian Government has<br />
condemned this invasion as totally without justification and<br />
a violation of acceptable international standards of conduct.<br />
The Government takes the view that the Soviet Government<br />
must be shown that the frea5 world will not tolerate continuoed<br />
Soviet expansionism.<br />
It is essential that any measures which Australia and<br />
other free nations decide to take to influence the Soviet<br />
Union's attitudes make a real impact. That's why Australian<br />
Government strongly holds the view that the Olympic Games<br />
should not be held in Moscow. An Olympic Games in Moscow<br />
will be a massive propaganda victory for the Soviet system<br />
and will be seen by them as an endorsement of Russia's<br />
policies and actions. We hope that a large number of free<br />
world nations will decide to stay away from Moscow.<br />
With regard to trade, the Government is co-operating<br />
with other major grain-exporting nations to ensure that the<br />
United States decision to significantly restrict its sales<br />
of feed grains to Russia is not prejudiced by increased<br />
sales by other exporters. At the same time, the Government<br />
does not support the concept of a food embargo on the Soviet<br />
Union, and we are continuing to ship existing wheat and<br />
coarse grain contracts. Trade in other important agricultural<br />
areas, including wool, is being continued on a normal basis.<br />
There has been som'e speculation that the Soviet Government<br />
may seek to discriminate against Australia in future purchases<br />
of wool because of our strong stand against their foreign,<br />
policies. / 3 </p>
<p>There has been no evidence to date that the Soviet.<br />
Government intends to take any such action, and I expect<br />
that they would have difficulty in obtaining the necessary<br />
quantities and grades of wool from other supplying countries.<br />
A halt to normal trading contacts with the Soviet Union<br />
would be a major step, which could only succeed if the major<br />
free world trading nations decided that co-ordinated action<br />
of such magnitude was warranted. No such decision has been,<br />
taken. We have agreed with the United States not to make up<br />
the shortfall caused by the U. S.-refusal to fill a contract<br />
for feed grain for the Soviet Union. We have agreed to<br />
operate with the the EEC and Canada to make this move<br />
effective. We have placed what is for the moment an interim ban on<br />
the export of strategic minerals to the Soviet Union<br />
materials which could materially aid the Soviet war effort.<br />
It is an interim ban until we are able to examine the matter<br />
more fully.<br />
There hav e been calls from some quarters for an extension<br />
of such trade bans to inclkde wool. I have strenuously<br />
resisted these calls, as H'das the Government, and for good<br />
reason. The point that must be considered is that ineffective<br />
sanctions against the Soviet Union are obviously pointless.<br />
In the case of wool, I simply do not believe it would<br />
be possible to ensure that no wool sold by Australia would<br />
end up in Soviet hands. To ban wool exports to the Soviet<br />
Union would be an empty gesture, and a gesture which could<br />
well result in us slicing off a nose to spite a face.<br />
We have moved for sanctions with grains, where we should<br />
not sabotage the successfull United States efforts, and with<br />
strategic minerals, where we are dealing with materials<br />
directly vital to Soviet war efforts.<br />
In all cases, our efforts have been directed at achieving<br />
maximum impact on the Soviet Union.<br />
The question troubling many people is basically thisare<br />
we not asking our athletes to carry most of the burden<br />
of our protest over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.<br />
. I have said clearly, several times, that I and all<br />
members of the Government fully realise just what we are<br />
asking our athletes to sacrifice. / 4 </p>
<p>The Government did not call for a boycott of the Moscow<br />
Games without deep thought, and without realising what it<br />
would mean to young Australians who had been training for<br />
years to compete for their nation at the Olympics.<br />
Taking all these things into account, the Government<br />
could still not escape the fact that an Olympic boycott is<br />
the single most telling blow the free world can strike to<br />
demonstrate its opposition to Soviet expansionism.<br />
There is not the slightest doubt that if the athletes<br />
of the free world attend the Moscow Games, the Russians will<br />
see this and broadcast it to the world as an acceptance<br />
of their actions in Afghanistan and a triumph for their<br />
foreign policy.<br />
A boycott of the Moscow Games by a significant group of<br />
countries cannot be hidden from the Russian people, and the<br />
Soviet Union's captive states.<br />
It will be a tremendqs blow to Russian prestige, and<br />
will bring home to the Russians far more sharply than anything<br />
else the world's concern over Afghanistan and the implications<br />
of the situation there.<br />
Of course our athletes would be extremely disappointed.<br />
For them it would be a real sacrifice.<br />
But, as hard as it might seem, I believe we simply have<br />
to face up to the fundamental questions in this issue.<br />
Where do you draw the line? How far do you let the<br />
Russians go? How much bloodshed must there be before<br />
people are prepared to stand up and be counted?<br />
Are gold medals, as important and significant as they<br />
are, more important than people's lives, their freedom, and<br />
peace and security?<br />
These are the questions people have to ask themselves,<br />
and answer. </p>
<p>The Government will continue its strong<br />
opposition to the continued Soviet presence in Afghanistan.<br />
The Prime Minister will be reporting on Tuesday on the<br />
results of his important discussions with the President of<br />
the United States and other major free world leaders. His<br />
report will provide a basis for co-ordinating the steps<br />
which Australia must take to strengthen collective security<br />
in the Indian Ocean region.<br />
I have no doubt that these are critical days for the<br />
maintenance of democracy. The Australian Government believes<br />
that it is only through strong, co-ordinated action by free<br />
world Governments that the Soviet Union will come to see<br />
that its aggressive expansionary policies will not succeed.<br />
I hope that all Australians will unite in supporting the<br />
Government's stand on this vital issue.<br />
It is with great pleasure that I declare this Sixth<br />
Macquarie Merino Field Days open. </p>
