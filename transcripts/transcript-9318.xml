PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
FAREWELL OF TROOPS TO RWANDA<br />
I will visit Townsville on Saturday 20 August 1994 to farewell the main<br />
contingent of Australian peacekeeping forces who will be leaving that day for<br />
Rwanda.<br />
The troops are part of the more than 300-strong Australian contingent which<br />
will provide medical support for the United Nations UNAMIR operations in<br />
Rwanda.<br />
The force will also provide assistance to Rwandan civilians.<br />
The advance Australian party arrived in Kigali on 8 August.<br />
Their role and that of the United Nations force as a whole will be vital in<br />
creating conditions in Rwanda which will enable refugees to return from the<br />
border areas and resume normal lives.<br />
The Australian troops will go with the good wishes of all Australians.<br />
