On the 70th Anniversary of the Bombing of Darwin, Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Veterans' Affairs Minister Warren Snowdon, encouraged all Australians to reflect on the dark day when our nation was first attacked on home soil  -  19 February 1942.</p>
<p>Today's anniversary will also be the first time it is recognised as a national day of observance, joining Anzac Day and Remembrance Day as a date when Australians can pause to remember those who lost their lives protecting our freedom.</p>
<p>Speaking from Darwin, the Prime Minister said the attacks on Darwin and northern Australia were a defining moment in our history that should not be forgotten.</p>
<p>We want to make sure the sacrifice of those who died in the attacks is remembered and our veterans honoured.</p>
<p>We also want Australians to learn more about what happened and why these events are so significant in the history of our nation. </p>
<p>Seventy years ago to the day, 242 Japanese aircraft killed more than 240 people and injured hundreds more  -  both civilian and service personnel.</p>
<p>Many sites including the harbour, post office, Army hospital, RAAF base and administration building were completely destroyed.</p>
<p>The attack came just four days after the fall of Singapore, from the same battle group of Japanese fighters, bombers and dive bombers that destroyed Pearl Harbor, two months prior.</p>
<p>Minister Snowdon said it was important for Australians to understand how these attacks changed our nation forever.</p>
<p>It was the first time we had been attacked on home soil and “the gravest hour in our history”, as described by Prime Minister Curtin at the time.</p>
<p>The bombing of Darwin was the first of more than 90 air raids across Australia's north starting in February 1942 and lasting until November 1943, hitting Broome, Katherine, Wyndham, Townsville and Horn Island.</p>
