    <content><![CDATA[<p>Thank you, Shelley and thank you Tina and your family for that really  moving Welcome to Country.</p>
<p>Yoonggu gulanyin ngalawiri, dhunayi, Ngoonawal dhowrrra.</p>
<p>Today we are meeting together  on Ngunnawal country and we acknowledge and pay our respects to their elders. </p>
<p>
  I acknowledge and pay my deep  respects to your people, the Ngunnawal people, who as you said Tina, have  walked these lands, and met on these lands, forever, for time beyond our  imagination, for time out of mind. </p>
<p>
  I extend our respects to all  of your elders past and present and to the future elders, to the young dancers  tonight, and to all our First Australian People and their elders, including of  course, all of the outstanding achievers and role models here today.</p>
<p>
  Of course I want to  acknowledge and welcome all of my ministerial and parliamentary colleagues,  especially Nigel Scullion, the Minister for Indigenous Affairs and of course  Ken Wyatt, Minister for Aged Care and Indigenous Health and – as you know – the  first Indigenous Australian to be a Minister in a Commonwealth Government. </p>
<p>
  Welcome all.</p>
<p>
  Now today is the 9th  anniversary of the National Apology to the Stolen Generations.</p>
<p>
  We acknowledge today, as we  did in the House earlier, the loss, the grief, and the heartache past policies  created for our First Australians. </p>
<p>
  But despite these injustices  and that trauma, you and your people have shown a courage and resilience which  is extraordinary. </p>
<p>
  Tonight, we acknowledge the remarkable lives of so many Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander Australians, who are thriving and succeeding in their  chosen fields. Your stories are not deficit, but of surplus; not of despondency  but of a relentless and determined optimism. </p>
<p>You lead and you inspire by your example. So many lives of achievement.</p>
<p>Rishelle Hume, a senior human resources consultant at Chevron, whose  work supporting Aboriginal people to grow in their careers spans two decades  and many industries.</p>
<p>Cherisse Buzzacott, an Arrente woman who is helping women give birth  safely and providing vital midwifery support to women in remote parts of the  Northern Territory. </p>
<p>Or the Kongs—a family of firsts. Marilyn and Marlene  were the first Indigenous medical graduates at Sydney University. Marlene  became a GP and public health expert; Marilyn became the first Indigenous  obstetrician and their brother Kelvin, the first Indigenous surgeon in  Australia. Kelvin and his wife are here with us this evening. </p>
<p>Another young doctor, Vinka Barunga, is now the first  Indigenous doctor in Derby, a town two hours out of Broome, where she grew up  swimming, fishing and playing with a plastic stethoscope. She’s a proud Worora  woman, going back to her community. She would have been here tonight, but work  has called her away. </p>
<p>We also have with us Dr Cass Hunter, Mibu Fischer, and  Karlie Noon—all working at CSIRO on research that impacts Indigenous  communities. Karlie has just won a scholarship, one of two new CSIRO Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander scholarships, to undertake post-graduate studies in  STEM subjects. Congratulations, Karlie. </p>
<p>Tanya Denning,<strong> </strong>a talented journalist and  producer now managing the National Indigenous Television station that  celebrates Indigenous Culture, voices and storytelling. </p>
<p>And so many others; people working caring for country,  in health, social services, education,  science, technology, law, the  arts, politics, public service, defence and much more. </p>
<p>We acknowledge the strength of culture and kinship,  and those strong bonds that can help shape higher expectations and better  outcomes. </p>
<p>I want to pay tribute in particular to the<strong> </strong>Indigenous  women<strong> </strong>who demonstrate that strength every day. The mums and the grandmas  and aunties and sisters, who never give up.</p>
<p>
  We must ensure that the education system, and all  those in it, believe in the dreams of our young people. That we support each  student and lift them up, and give them every opportunity to get the most out  of their education. </p>
<p>I know that you would all agree that a solid education  is the surest way to get from the first Indigenous doctor, to the 500th  and then the 5,000th. To make sure that in years to come, we’re not  talking about one or two hundred Indigenous lawyers or accountants, but thousands of them. </p>
<p>So I want to thank all the organisations, some of whom  are here tonight, for their investment in the dreams of these young people:  Aurora Foundation, the Australian Indigenous Mentoring Experience, Career  Trackers, AFL Cape York House, and many more, but too many to name. </p>
<p>And already we can point to progress. In the seven  years to 2015, the gap in Year 12 attainment shrunk by close to 15 percent, and  in the decade to 2015, the number of Indigenous students enrolling in higher  education nearly doubled. </p>
<p>The higher the level of education, the smaller the gap  between Indigenous and non-Indigenous employment. For tertiary-educated  Indigenous people, there is no gap. There is no gap. </p>
<p>We are making progress, and you are part of it. </p>
<p>And each of you are<strong> </strong>Ambassadors for change.  Your determination and resilience is a demonstration to others that through  hard work, anything is possible. Your stories are vitally important, your  example is vitally important in creating that change. </p>
<p>Indigenous life is extraordinarily diverse and  extraordinarily rich. It unfolds in the remotest parts of our nation as well as  in the heart of our busiest cities and suburbs; far away in the Tiwi Islands,  right here in the centre of Government, in the bush and on the coast. It  encompasses extraordinary talent, vision and determination. </p>
<p>So Tonight I want to challenge all those present, and  people right across Australia to tell your stories. To widen our  lens. To focus the attention of our nation, on your hard work and your  achievements. </p>
<p>We want to have a nation where our indigenous children  are limited only by their imagination. </p>
<p>To show Indigenous children from Shepparton to the  Tiwi Islands, from Redfern to Alice Springs, that they can be anything they set  their mind to. </p>
<p>That little girl can be anything she sets her mind to,  Tina. That’s the dream, that’s the goal. </p>
<p>So  that being Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander means to be successful; to  achieve, to have big dreams and high hopes, and to draw strength from your identity  as an Indigenous man or woman in this great country. </p>
<p>There is a room full of role models right here. </p>
<p>When we include the stories like those we honour  tonight, we shine a light on the richness and diversity of our First  Australians. We light, you light, the way for others to follow. </p>
<p>So Congratulations on your success and thank you for  paving the way for so many Indigenous Australian success stories to come. </p>
<p>I am now honoured to invite another great role model,  another inspiration, my dear friend, the very wise Ken Wyatt, Minister for Aged  Care, Minister for Indigenous Health, the first Indigenous Member of the House  of Representatives and first Indigenous Minister in a Commonwealth Government. </p>
