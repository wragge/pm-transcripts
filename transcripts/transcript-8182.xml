TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, SOUTH PACIFIC TYRES, SOMERTON,<br />
MELBOURNE, 2 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
E &amp; O0E PROFONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: -Mr Hawke, would you like to comment<br />
specifically on moves by Mr Booker, the one who's being<br />
invited I understand he's still considering it but he<br />
has been officially invited. Is that not a good thing?<br />
PM: The first thing I'd like to say is it would be a<br />
pity that Mr Booker couldn't get his facts right. I mean<br />
I was appalled in listening as I was travelling in the<br />
car this morning to Mr Booker's comments that we had put<br />
Australia's ships, under United States command. Now that<br />
is a falsity and if he doesn't know the facts of<br />
Australia's p~ resence in the Gulf it raises very serious<br />
questions about what he should be doing going there. The<br />
facts are these, that Australian ships are under<br />
Australian national command. In specific operations that<br />
arise in conducting the blockade there is a rotation of<br />
operational control. Now on certain occasions it could<br />
be under the United States control, other occasions under<br />
Australian control. For this man to be getting up and<br />
saying that Australia sent its ships there and put them<br />
under United States control shows that in regard to the<br />
fundamental cluestion of the nature of Australia's<br />
presence in t: he Gulf he either doesn't know the facts or<br />
deliberately chooses to misrepresent the facts, which<br />
gives you an indication of the concern that I and<br />
governments have about private individuals going in. I<br />
mean what sort of confidence do you have about a man who,<br />
as I say, either doesn't know the basic facts about our<br />
presence or deliberately misrepresents them. It's one or<br />
the other.<br />
JOURNALIST: So are you saying he shouldn't go<br />
PM: Well I'm saying that if he does go, if he does go,<br />
it would be a good idea first of all that he gets his<br />
knowledge of the facts right. That would be a good<br />
thing. And I repeat what I said before. I share the<br />
judgement of the European governments who are very much<br />
involved in this, that the intervention of private<br />
individuals can be somewhat destabilising of the unity of<br />
purpose against Saddam Hussein. Now having said that,<br />
obviously having the concern that we do for the interests<br />
of our hostages which we are, as I say, on a daily<br />
basis pursuing-through our official representatives if,<br />
however, whether it's Mr Booker or someone else, they go<br />
I </p>
<p>2<br />
there and if they were to have some success in getting<br />
some out then obviously we'd welcome that. But I say<br />
whether it's Mr Booker or anyone else, it would be a<br />
damned good idea if they got their facts right.<br />
ends </p>
