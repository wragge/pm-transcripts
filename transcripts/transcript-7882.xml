TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH THE RT HON<br />
GEOFFREY PALMER, PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND,<br />
GOVERNMENT HOUSE, AUCKLAND, 2 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
E &amp; 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PALMER: Ladies and gentlemen, the Australian Prime<br />
minister and myself have just concluded a very fruitful<br />
round of talks and one of the results of those talks, and<br />
indeed of previous Australian and New Zealand cooperation<br />
on this important issue of driftnet fishing is that the<br />
Australian Prime Minister is going to sign the Driftnet<br />
Fishing Convention on behalf of the Government of<br />
Australia right now.<br />
Can I say a word or two about the discussions we had on<br />
driftnetting? ' There's a great deal of anger and<br />
resentment in the South West Pacific about this practice.<br />
Mr Hawke., arnd I have decided to take some significant<br />
steps towards increasing our cooperation to stamp out<br />
this practice. We are going to develop a program of<br />
surveillance by our aircraft both of the RAAF and the<br />
RNZAF over the Tasman Sea for driftnetting in the<br />
1990/ 1991 season. We're going to intensify our<br />
surveillance in the high seas, we're going to target<br />
driftnet activities within the South West Pacific<br />
economic zones of the Forum island qountries in<br />
consultation with those countries of course and we're<br />
going to give the fullest support to the Forum Fisheries<br />
Agency in the design of a program for this surveillance.<br />
I think this will be a practical measure that will assist<br />
those steps which really began with the Tarawa<br />
Declaration and I am very encouraged at the response to<br />
the Convention and I am also very encouraged that<br />
Australia and New Zealand are going to be able to work to<br />
work very closely together on this issue. I'd like to<br />
hand over to Bob to say a few words on that issue and<br />
some other very significant things that he discussed with<br />
me. HAWKE: Thanks Geoffrey. Well, I take very little time<br />
to add to what Geoffrey has said about the driftnet<br />
fishing issue. As you know, at the last Forum we were<br />
involved in making( sure that this was picked up and it </p>
<p>-2-<br />
resulted in the Tarawa Declaration. We're very indebted<br />
to New Zealand for the follow-up activities in which<br />
they've been involved arnd I think that together, as being<br />
the two major powers in this South Pacific region, the<br />
decisions that we've taken today in regard to increased<br />
surveillance will give weight to the commitment that<br />
we've expressed before as to our abhorrence about this<br />
practice. We hope that, as a result of the actions that<br />
together we've initiated, the world will come to a<br />
situation that this wall of death practice will be<br />
eliminated in our region in the relatively near future.<br />
The next thing I would really like to refer to is that I<br />
had come here to New Zealand with some ideas about how we<br />
would like Geoffrey to make Australia's contribution to<br />
the important events that you celebrate, the 150th<br />
anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.<br />
I'm very pleased that the Prime Minister of New Zealand<br />
has responded positively to the suggestions we've made.<br />
The gifts that Australia will be making are in two<br />
0categories. Firstly, we are going to fund the<br />
establishment of a South Pacific oral history archive to<br />
commemuorate this year. There'll be a fund established,<br />
of the order of $ NZl million and that will fund the<br />
Australian awards in New Zealand oral history. That<br />
grant will establish a trust and will be named the<br />
Australian Trust for Promotion of Oral History in New<br />
Zealand and the South Pacific. The selection of the<br />
awards will be made by a board with representations from<br />
Maori and Pacific island groups and professional<br />
historians, practitioners of oral history and archivists.<br />
Copies of all the material collected will be deposited in<br />
the National Library of New Zealand and, as I understand,<br />
administration will be supplied by the Historical Branch<br />
of the Department of Internal Affairs which will provide<br />
the monitoring and the technical assistance to the<br />
grantees. so in this way we are going to try and ensure<br />
that what has been part of the tradition of New Zealand<br />
and the Pacific islands where the history of the peoples<br />
has traditionally been handed down by word of mouth, that<br />
the most modern techniques that are now available will be<br />
provided for under this scheme to ensure that for future<br />
generations there shall be retained the best possible<br />
statements of the evolution of affairs in this region.<br />
We think that this is a very practical, meaningful sort<br />
of way to express * the depth of the relationship between<br />
our two countries.<br />
The second category of gift that we are making is to<br />
recognise that in the great range of relationships we<br />
have between Australia and New Zealand, the sporting<br />
rivalry is not, not the least significant.<br />
PALMER: This is true.<br />
HAWKE: So what we are doing is to provide cups in<br />
perpetuity for a contest between the two countries in the<br />
two areas of rugby league we'll provide what is called </p>
<p>the Australasian Trophy for Rugby League and it would be<br />
played for in August during the rugby league test being<br />
organised to take place at the same time as the Bledisloe<br />
Cup is being played for in rugby union and to show the<br />
impeccability of our gender credentials, on the one hand<br />
will be the rugby league and on the other hand there'll<br />
be a Sou. thern Cross Cup for women's test cricket.<br />
PALMER: Which is on now.<br />
HAWKE: Which is on now and the women's cricket bodies in<br />
both countries that had expressed the hope that it can be<br />
played for in the current series. The the cup is<br />
here. PAILHER: Yes, that's right.<br />
HAWKE: There you are, that's it. That will now be<br />
how about if I'll infect you, there you are.<br />
PALMER: Thank you very much. That's very nice Bob.<br />
Very heavy, substantial and hotly contested cup it will<br />
be. HAWKE: Yes, it will the third and deciding match is<br />
pretty evenly poised I believe at the moment. So quite<br />
seriously, my friends, we in Australia-deeply value,<br />
Geoffrey, the relationship between our two countries. I<br />
think it's in great shape, both at the personal level,<br />
the people level, the organisations level and this will<br />
be seen, these two gifts will be seen in the area, the<br />
oral archive and the cups . fo r rugby league and women's<br />
cricket, will be seen as a tangible expression of the<br />
deep affection that the people of Australia have for New<br />
Zealand.<br />
PALMER: Well, I think I should say, Bob, on behalf of<br />
all New Zealaniders that we, we really are very grateful<br />
for this great gesture on the occasion of our 150th.<br />
It's a great way of marking this occasion. It's also,<br />
it'll continue to be brought to the-attention of the New<br />
Zealand public every year without fail. I think it's<br />
fair to say that the sporting rivalries between Australia<br />
and New Zealand have done a great deal which is positive.<br />
for the relationship. This is just another indication of<br />
that and I think that the oral history project as well<br />
will be very important for the furtherance and<br />
preservation of the particular unique culture of New<br />
Zealand. We are very grateful to the Australian<br />
Government afld to yourself for your generosity and we<br />
thank you for it.<br />
HAWKE: Pleasure. Now what about the other matters we<br />
talked about? Do you want to<br />
PALMER; well, we had pretty wide ranging discussions on<br />
a whole range of issues. We discussed driftnetting. Mr<br />
Hawke was good enough to give me a rundown on the </p>
<p>-4-<br />
situation in Bougainville which, of course, is a<br />
situation of considerable concern. We talked about the<br />
developing situation in Eastern Europe. We had some<br />
discussions about Antarctica, Cambodia. I briefed the<br />
Australian Prime Minister on the New Zealand Government's<br />
review of its Pacific policy. I pointed out what we were<br />
doing to look at our relationships with the Pacific<br />
island countries and we will make sure that the<br />
Australian Government is kept in close touch with the<br />
development of our thinking on that. We looked briefly<br />
at the situation in Fiji. I think that there's a,<br />
there's a similarity of approach over the questions of<br />
Fiji and there haven't been any developments I think<br />
there that cause us, either of us, to -change our present<br />
policy stances. I think the most important things that<br />
we discuss really always are the relationship between<br />
Australia and. New Zealand. The relationship between<br />
Australia and New Zealand has been mostly characterised<br />
in recent years by the acronym CER. CER has been a<br />
tremendous success' from New Zealand's point of view,<br />
there's been a dynamic development in our trade<br />
relations. we are going to be reviewing it in 1992, it<br />
may be useful to bring forward that review we'll look<br />
at that but on July 1, free trade and goods this year<br />
between New Zealand and Australia will be complete. That<br />
is a most significant development. I expressed to the<br />
Australian Prime Minister that my view that we should<br />
start now looking ahead to how the relationship will<br />
develop post-CER. What sort of relations do we want to<br />
have, how do we want to have those expressed in<br />
institutional ways? Now we haven't made any decisions on<br />
any of that, but what we have decided to do is to do some<br />
long range think * ing about how relations between Australia<br />
and New Zealand will develop. I think thtat there are no<br />
two countries that have closer relations than Australia<br />
and New Zealand.. The depth of those relations is quite<br />
extraordinary. I looked at the list of Ministerial<br />
contacts between Australian Government Ministers and New<br />
Zealand Ministers. They meet, in one range or another,<br />
just about on a weekly basis throughout the year<br />
depending on what portfolio area they are in. We have a<br />
habit of picking up the telephone and talking to our<br />
opposite niubers which must make the life of diplomats<br />
very difficult to keep in touch with actually how the<br />
relationship's developing. -So I just think that the<br />
relationship's in great shape and as a result of these<br />
talks it'll get better.<br />
HAWKE: I just want to very, very briefly confirm what<br />
the Prime Minister of New Zealand has said, both as to<br />
the range of matters covered, the usefulness of the<br />
discussions and to confirm, as I say, as he has the<br />
relationship between our two countries is in great shape<br />
and I think that not only our Governments, but<br />
organisations, people are entitled to be proud of the way<br />
in which that relationship has developed. Now I think we<br />
can be open to questions. </p>
<p>PALMER: Sure.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Palmer, considering the depth of the<br />
relationship, would you like to see Australia plead your<br />
cause in Washington or improve official contact with the<br />
United States?<br />
PALMER: I don't think there's any need for any action to<br />
be taken in that connection. I've had discussions with<br />
Gareth Evans in the past about that. The Australian<br />
Government's position is clear about that. in fact that<br />
is not a matter that Bob and I even discussed today<br />
because there's nothing on the agenda in relation to<br />
that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Palmer, you've state before you'* d like to<br />
see or perhaps or you can foresee New Zealand and<br />
Australia having the same currency. Is that still<br />
something you're looking at?<br />
PALMER: s That's not something that we had any discussions<br />
about. What we had discussions about was the nature of<br />
how the relationship might develop and rather than<br />
backing into some sort of evolution that takes place, we<br />
ought to do some hard thinking about what shape we want<br />
to give the relationship.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Palmer, is the vessel which has attracted<br />
some Greenpeace attention in Auckland Harbour, is that<br />
supplying driftnet fishing fleets in the Tasman?<br />
PALMER: The allegation is that that vessel was. The New<br />
Zealand Government investigated those allegations, wasn't<br />
able to obtain proof, but as a result of pressure brought<br />
by the Greenpeace organisation and by the trade unions in<br />
New Zealand, the vessel decided it was not going to<br />
refuel here and is going to proceed elsewhere.<br />
JOURNALIST: So there'* s every possibility the vessels<br />
involved in driftnet fishing, either directly or<br />
indirectly, could be bunkering in New Zealand waters?<br />
PALMER: No, I don't think there is that possibility<br />
because, under the Sovereign rights that we have, we can<br />
stop that when it comes to our attention.* But the<br />
JOURNALIST: you don't know.<br />
PALMER: Well, of course that is one of the problems. If<br />
you are going to use your legal powers you've got to have<br />
some proof. You've got to have the facts at your<br />
fingertips. The facts are not always easy to ascertain<br />
in respect of intentions of that sort.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is that good enough do you think?<br />
PALMER: Well, as a result of the Driftnet Fishing<br />
tonvention coming into forcei New Zealand legislation is </p>
<p>going to have to be changed and the changes that we can<br />
make can encompass explicitly this sort of risk. We have<br />
taken very, very drastic measures against driftnetters in<br />
our own internal law. Anyone who brings driftnet<br />
equipment into New Zealand's economic zone is for the<br />
high jump. Now we can tighten it still further as a<br />
result of the measures in this Convention.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about the servicing of driftnet fleets?<br />
PALMER: We can, we can make that covered, but it is not<br />
a simple thing because there are international<br />
arrangements about third party flag Vessels. This vessel<br />
is not flagged by the driftnetting nations.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, will the Australasian rugby league<br />
trophy be played on a nation of origin basis or a<br />
national representative basis?<br />
HAWKE: That's going to be a matter for the sporting<br />
bodies concerned. I must say that my inclination in<br />
these matters from Australian experience is the origin<br />
concept. JOURNALIST: Itts going to rip the guts out of the Sydney<br />
side.<br />
HAWKE: Well, we're a very adaptable nation in all<br />
respects. We're an adaptable nation.<br />
JOURNALIST: -Mr Hawke, have you been able to negotiate an<br />
export licence for the precious metal our team will be<br />
taking back from Auckland?<br />
HAWKE: Not I must say the people of New Zealand and its<br />
Government have been extraordinarily generous in their<br />
attitude on these matters.<br />
PALMER: Anid on a per capita basis we're doing pretty<br />
well ourselves.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, are you going to grab another gold<br />
for Australia when you play Mr Palmer at golf?<br />
HAWKE: Well, let me very briefly recap the history of<br />
this important sporting contest. And you will imagine<br />
properly, correctly, that I only recap the history<br />
because I'm just marginally in front. our first meeting<br />
was two years ago here and I don't know Whether it was<br />
because of his generosity as host, but I won the first<br />
one, our second meeting was our game in KL which he won<br />
and then we had another one up at the retreat which I<br />
won. So it stands at two/ one now and I hear from our<br />
intelligence service which has been deployed on these<br />
matters that he has been practicing vigorously over the<br />
Christmas/ New Year period to the extent that some of.<br />
hspolitic], idyviqers. 1ihave. kpjn. questioning whibtheiT he's<br />
got his priorities right or not, so I'm looking forward<br />
to a very tough-match. </p>
<p>-7<br />
J0URNALISTs Mr Hawke, on the development of free trade and<br />
goods between New Zealand and Australia: regarding the<br />
report currently before the Australian Government talks to<br />
remove tariff rates by the year 2000. Can you tell us what<br />
your personal views are in relation to that please?<br />
HAWKE: I've indicated when the Garnaut report came down<br />
that I had a personal predeliction, which is nothing new. In<br />
the days when I was trade union leader and since I've been<br />
in Parliament I've made it clear that by inclination I am a<br />
free trader rather than protectionist. Because I am a<br />
student of history and if you look at history the causes,<br />
not just of economic conflict, of political conflict and<br />
wars has been the increasing economic under which<br />
people and nations operate under the delusion that they can<br />
put walls around themselves and have -this trading posture<br />
of keeping others out and subsidising their own to hurt<br />
others elsewhere. That always seems to me to be a recipe<br />
for potential disaster. That's why New Zealan : d and<br />
Australia have in a sense given a lead to the rest of the<br />
world and shown that co-operation is the way, that you<br />
shouldn't be afraid of competition. Competition can be<br />
something that is initially uncomfortable, but ultimately<br />
it will make for greater efficiency. We are, in the<br />
international field, putting action where our mouths are.<br />
We are out there leading in the Cairns group in moving<br />
towards firming up a liberalisation of the international<br />
trading system and so in our consideration of the Garnaut<br />
report recommendation it will be within the framework of a<br />
philosophical approach towards the elimination of tariffs.<br />
We've got to make sure that we do that within an<br />
understanding; that we do it within a negotiating framework<br />
of this year of the Uraguay Round. And I don't<br />
know whether you appreciate this, but the processes that are<br />
flow involved in this final ten months of the Uraguay round<br />
of negotiations involve a series of bilateral and<br />
multilateralnegotiations about tariff positions and tariff<br />
findings. Now you don't maximise your capacity to extract<br />
sensible positions from others if you just now say<br />
we're really just going to eliminate everything. I mean<br />
we've got to make sure that you put, . yourself in the best<br />
bargaining position in this final stage of the Uraguay<br />
Round. But we'll be doing that within the framework of a<br />
philosphical and economic commitment to a free trade<br />
position. JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
HAWKE: It doesn't follow. I gave an answer the other day.<br />
When we received the Garnaut report what I did immediately<br />
was to convene the relevant committee which is the<br />
Structural Adjustment Committee and we now have groups of<br />
officials and of Ministers examining all the relevant </p>
<p>-8<br />
recommendations of Garnaut including this. Now the time at<br />
which I will make decisions, through our government<br />
processes is a matter which will depend upon the reception<br />
of their reports. If that one comes before I call the<br />
election, it will, anid if it doesn't then it will be<br />
considered by the fourth H-awke government.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister do you support the<br />
unconditional position?<br />
HAWKE: There is no one who in this interdependent world<br />
says that you approach these matters by simply saying to the<br />
world we are going to abolish all our tariff and non-tariff<br />
measures. No one. Not a single nation. But what you have<br />
to do, in our judgement, is what my government has done and<br />
certainly with the support of the New Zealand government and<br />
others in t he Cairns group, is to state your position and<br />
that is: the world will be better off with a liberalised<br />
trading machine. To put it into historical and contemporary<br />
terms and, in any sensible analysis of the future, to point<br />
out that the world has expanded in the post-war period<br />
within a situation which has encouraged trade between the<br />
nations and that the most recent period where there have<br />
been signs of increasing tariff and non tariff measures as<br />
impediments to trade is precisely the period where<br />
difficulties have been created.<br />
And not only for nations like our own which are relatively<br />
prosperous but very particularly for those third world<br />
countries which depend so overwhelmingly upon a freedom of<br />
access to the markets of the developed economics for what is<br />
often a mono economic bait with just one commodity or one<br />
or two commodities. So that what you do is to establish the<br />
philosophical position. Of course in Australia's case we<br />
have put our money where our mouth is, if you like, by<br />
the very significant tariff reduction processes which we<br />
initiated in 1988 at 30 per cent.<br />
JOURNALIST: Given the importance of the micro economic<br />
debate in the coming campaign do you think its reasonable<br />
for people to expect that even if you haven't made detailed<br />
decisions on Garnaut you will have a position in principle<br />
on the key recommendations..<br />
HAWKE: I have just stated the position in principle,<br />
weren't you listening?<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, can I ask you what do you think<br />
should be done to back up the doping scandals that we have<br />
had in the Commonwealth Games? Bearing in mind that one<br />
of the problems at the Games has been a limited budget for<br />
doping tests, is. Australia willing to put more money up<br />
for doping tests both in the Games and<br />
HAWKE: Well we will certainly be prepared to play our part<br />
in any international approach on this issue. I think that </p>
<p>9-<br />
the exposure of this issue again can only be helpful and we<br />
within Australia have adopted a very stringent approach, as<br />
you will appreciate and Australia will be prepared to play<br />
its part, in co-operation with others to try and stamp it<br />
out. It's a blot upon the sport and very unfortunately the<br />
good namne of the overwhelming majority of sports and of<br />
sportsmen and women have been tarnished by a few and I<br />
think we should all co-operate to try stamp this practice<br />
out and play our part.<br />
JOURNALIST: But is bearing in mind that<br />
Australia is one of the wealthiest nations in the<br />
Commuonwealth could perhaps put in more money well if<br />
you've put alot of money into winning medals I mean<br />
HAWKE: And put more money than any other nation<br />
other than the United Kingdom and Canada into the<br />
Commonwealt We put more money, if I can use this per<br />
capita concept so clearly beloved by my friendi Geoffrey,<br />
we've put infinitely more money into the<br />
Commonwealth in all its activities probably than anyone<br />
else and we will continue to do so and if in this particular<br />
area the Commonwealth decides that money is required to<br />
have an effective programme then as we do in every other<br />
area we will continue to be economically supportive.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr H-awke, just coming back it seems to me<br />
that you have two positions on the table: on the one hand<br />
you said that you agreed the Garnaut recommendations to the<br />
unilateral move, you're attracted to it and on the other<br />
hand of the negotiations can you just clarify that?<br />
HAWKE: Yes, well I also said this means we'll have a total<br />
recap. I said' that we had already moved. I mean what we<br />
have done in terms of the decision in 1988, the 30 per cent<br />
reduction in fact brings us towards a<br />
position which has been predicated by many of those that<br />
are negotiating what should be the final outcome of the<br />
Round. Now we are not satisfied that there shouldn't be<br />
further progress than that. Now what we have done is to, in<br />
the area of most the concern, but while not exclusively<br />
concentrating on agriculture we have been leading via the<br />
Cairns group the pressure on the two major groups, the<br />
European community and the United States, -to have<br />
substantial changes in that area of concern. But we have<br />
also been very much involved in the discussions and<br />
negotiations in the other areas which are covered by the<br />
Uraguay Round. Now what we are making clear is that we take<br />
into the Round a position of already made decisions, which<br />
are much more than what most other countries have done. But<br />
we are saying, not merely in response to the Garnaut report<br />
but as a general philosophical position, which has been the<br />
basis of our approach in the Cairns group, that the world<br />
should be moving towards a greater freeing up of trade. As </p>
<p>10<br />
far as Australia is concerned there is no basis upon which<br />
it should be seen that what we did in 1988 is the end of our<br />
commitment it is not. The processes of moving beyond the<br />
very substantial reductions that we have already made<br />
will involve not merely a unilateral decision in response<br />
to Garnaut and other matters. But by definition when in<br />
1990 you are in the final months of the Uraguay Round I'm<br />
saying it must by definition, the decision to take must be<br />
related to the negotiations you will have in that Round.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke do you see any irony in you coming to<br />
New Zealand to celebrate the anniversary of the Treaty of<br />
Waitangi when Australia is still own indigenous people? </p>
<p>11<br />
HAWK( E: No, I don't, I don't feel any problem about that.<br />
The simple position is that we will proceed with the<br />
concept of a treaty within Australia. I am to have<br />
further discussions with the Minister about, Gerry Hand,<br />
about this. What we want to see is Gerry of course has<br />
had time overwhelmingly taken up with getting the ATSIC<br />
legislation through the Parliament. Now that that's<br />
done, he's going to be able to give more time to this<br />
issue,' but what I want to see is a process settled upon<br />
whereby we can accelerate the consideration of these<br />
issues. We will want within the Aboriginal community to<br />
be quite sure that we've got a process whereby we can get<br />
the feelings and the attitude of the Aboriginal people<br />
and now that ATSIC is is established, the legislation<br />
is through, I think via ATSIC we're going to have a<br />
better way of getting the views of the Aboriginal<br />
community. on the other hand we also want to-now get<br />
going the process of education, if you like, of the<br />
community generally. in the non-Aboriginal community,<br />
about the importance of this issue. I can assure you<br />
that in the fourth term that these things will be<br />
processed, the resources will be made available because I<br />
do believe that the total Australian community<br />
Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal is going to be well<br />
served by the achievement of that treaty. It's not<br />
something that's imposed, but something tha t emerges from<br />
as far as possible a coalescence of the wishes, the<br />
aspirations of the Aboriginal people and a recognition of<br />
the non-Aboriginal community of the appropriateness of<br />
such an outcome.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Palmer, given the historical nexus of the<br />
election of Labor Governments on both sides of the<br />
Tasman, would you personally prefer an Australian<br />
election earlier rather than later this year?<br />
PALMER: I don't think it makes any difference. From the<br />
New Zealand Government point of view, when the Australian<br />
election occurs is a question for the Australian Prime<br />
Minister, not for me.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, there's still some progress to be<br />
made on trade services under CERHAWKE:<br />
Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: One area that's been quite controversial has<br />
been greater access in air services between the two<br />
countries. HAWKE: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Was that discussed today..<br />
HAWK( E: Yeo, Geoffrey and I did have some discussion<br />
about that and it's recognised that this is an area of<br />
Lmportance. You'll appreciate that in Australia, as a<br />
result of the decision taken by my Government, we are now </p>
<p>12<br />
abolishing the two airline agreement and that happens<br />
this year. And within our consideration of the impact of<br />
that, that decision later this year I mean, it comes<br />
into effect in the second half of this year we will be<br />
looking at the impact of that decision, what developments<br />
take place in terms of new enterprises that may set up,<br />
and so on. within the framework of that consideration<br />
we'll certainly be considering the trans-Tasman aspect of<br />
that. it's quite clear we need to take account of the<br />
aspiration of Air New Zealand. We've got to ask<br />
ourselves questions about the relationships between<br />
Qantas, Australian and s0 on, and we've agreed that<br />
within the framework, as I say, of the deregulated<br />
Australian situation following the abolition of ' the two<br />
airline agreement that this is one of the matters that<br />
will be taken into account. We tend to think that having<br />
accelerated so much the freeing-up of trade goods<br />
because, as you recall, that under the original timetable<br />
there wasn't to be complete freedom of trade in goods<br />
until 1995. Now, we've brought that forward five years.<br />
Now we think it's appropriate to accelerate our<br />
consideration of trade in services.<br />
JOURNALIST: so it's possible Air New Zealand wiill be<br />
given domestic rights into Australia.<br />
HAWKE: Well, that's one of the things Air New Ze-Aland<br />
would like to have. It's legitimate for it to be on the<br />
table. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, a number of Australian companies<br />
have caught New Zealand disease<br />
HAWKE: What's the New Zealand disease?<br />
JOURNALIST: Going into liquidation.<br />
HAWKE: Is it? I see.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you expecting a recession in Australia<br />
this year and if so what impact could it have on New<br />
Zealand.<br />
HAWKE. No. There is no exipectation of a recession in<br />
Australia. There will not be a recession in Australia.-<br />
No-one who is acquainted with the Australian economic<br />
scene expects a recession. No-one.<br />
JOURNALIST: yesterday's trade figures show, confirm<br />
the trend of a * slowing economy and may give rise to a<br />
further easing of monetary policy?<br />
HAWKE: Well, like you, I've ' read what the Treasurer said<br />
about this. He'* s put it correctly. I don't really have<br />
anything to add to what Paul has had to say because what<br />
he said reinforced what I'd said myself. And that is we<br />
refuse to be rushedi into a change in monetary policy when<br />
in conjunction with the Reserve Bank we made the steps we </p>
<p>13<br />
did, which Paul properly described as a limited initial<br />
step. It was on the basis of a range of economic<br />
information available to us which gave us the feeling<br />
that the stance of policy which had been in place had<br />
produced the results that we wanted, was producing it<br />
that is a slowing down of the economy. Now We said at<br />
the time, when some cynics or relatively ill informed<br />
people said why don't you wait for the, the balance of<br />
payments figures. We've said that that reflected earlier<br />
positions rather than the current. But it's interesting<br />
that that reflection of the earlier position, orders made<br />
and so on, some six months or more ago, confirms the<br />
assessment that we made about the slowing down of the<br />
economy. It's not something that comes as a surprise in<br />
the light of the range of other statistics and to the<br />
extent that our assessment has been confirmed, that means<br />
that at an appropriate time there can be a further<br />
consideration of easing. We will not be rushing into<br />
that as the Treasurer said.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Palmer, what conclusions did you and Mr<br />
Hawke reach about the current situation on Bougainvill~ e?<br />
PALMER: Well, our primary interest for New Zealand is<br />
the safety of our citizens who are there. There were<br />
substantial numbers of New Zealanders in Bougainville.<br />
We've advised them to leave and a lot of them have and<br />
our discussions really revolved around the mechanics of<br />
ensuring that our citizens could safely be evacuated from<br />
Bougainville in the event of a deterioration. The<br />
numbers there now are many, many fewer than they were<br />
just a few weeks ago. obviously the whole situation in<br />
Bougainville is a matter of concern, not just in New<br />
Zealand and ' Australia, but throughout the Pacific.<br />
JOURNALIST: What chance is there of New Zealand or<br />
Australian intervention in some form?<br />
PALMER: I would think no chance from New Zealand'* s point<br />
of view of intervening. our only concern is to keep our<br />
nationals safe and get them out of there in the event<br />
that it's necessary to do so.<br />
H{ AWKE: Let me make it quite clear that I've said in<br />
Australia, and'I take the opportunity of repeating it<br />
here, there will be no Australian military intervention<br />
in Papua New Guinea in regard to the dispute. Not on<br />
under any circumstances. All that can happen which would<br />
involve Australian military forces is as a result of an<br />
understanding which I initiated now a couple of months<br />
ago with the Government of Papua New Guinea, if a<br />
circumstance were to arise of danger to Australian<br />
nationals where their safety required our intervention<br />
for the purpose of rescuing them, evacuating them, then<br />
we would do that and that would be done with the<br />
understanding of the Government of Papua New Guinea.<br />
under no other circumstances would Australian military<br />
forces intervene. </p>
<p>-14<br />
JOURNALIST; Are there any contingency plans for a joint<br />
Australian and New Zealand action?<br />
HAWKE: Well, it follows what I've said, no. That<br />
there's no<br />
JOURNALIST: Not necessarily military,, but<br />
HAWKE: We are prepared in the present circumstances to,<br />
when we've got our forces standing by in a contingency<br />
situation and we are prepared to look after New Zealand<br />
people as well as our own.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, were you giving us another<br />
tantalising tip yesterday when restating your intention<br />
to go to Gallipoli? Does this mean early April rather<br />
than HAWKE: Good question.<br />
PALMER: No answer.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's your answer?<br />
ends </p>
