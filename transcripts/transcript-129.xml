P. M. No. 4+ 3/ 1959<br />
MT. ISA RA LWAY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister<br />
In August I concluded a published statement concerning<br />
the actions of teCommonwealth in relation to the Mt. Isa<br />
railway project with these words:<br />
" All that need be said at this stage is that the Queensland<br />
Government and my owm are both active and co-operative, since<br />
we are both enthusiastic about the project, and will do all<br />
that we can to see it completed as a whole, in the interests<br />
of both mineral and pastoral development in Northern Queensland."<br />
Today, I am, able to publish a letter from myself to<br />
Mr. Nicklin, Premier of Queensland, dated 26th October and a reply<br />
from him which I have received today. Some details will<br />
have to be worked out on the official level but they will not, I<br />
imagine, create any difficulties.<br />
In effect, therefore, the great problem of the financing<br />
of the rehabilitation of the railway from Collinsville to<br />
Mount Isa in North Queensland will be solved and a new era of<br />
North Queensland development will be opened up. When it is realised<br />
that in addition to the œ C30m. which will be spent by government,<br />
the Mount Isa Company will spend substantially more<br />
than that sum in developing its mining production, it will be<br />
seen that the total project is of immense magnitude. When both<br />
the mine development and the railway rehabilitation are complete,<br />
there will be not only groat improvement in Queensland railway<br />
finances and in employment in many ways, but there will also be<br />
a very large addition to both Queensland industry and to national<br />
export income. I do not need to recapitulate the actions of the Commonwealth<br />
on this matter. Up to a very recent point, I explained<br />
them fully in a statement which was widely published in<br />
the Queensland press.<br />
Mr. Holt, on his recent journey abroad, conducted,<br />
with the Secrotary to the Commonwealth Treasury, Sir Roland Wilson,<br />
a close examination into all possible sources of special<br />
borrowing for the Mount Isa railway, including those which had<br />
been suggested from the Queensland end. It turned out that<br />
there was no imrnadiate prospect of such a loan-raising. This<br />
was, from our point of view, unfortunate; since to obtain the<br />
money overseas would have had the dual advantage of strengthening<br />
our overseas funds while at the same time helping to finance<br />
this great enterprise in Australia.<br />
I want to make it quite clear that from first to last<br />
we have been tremendously keen on seeing this job done. I myself,<br />
as is well known, have devoted a very great deal of time<br />
and effort to solving the problems involved.<br />
Upon considering Mr. Holt's report, we were naturally<br />
disappointed. Since the Commonwealth Budget is already in deficit,<br />
it is no simple matter to accept added burdens. But we<br />
felt that the time had comeo when a very special effort should be<br />
made by us to assist Queensland in this matter. After close deliberation<br />
with the Treasurer, we agreed that we should in effect<br />
put the Cormmonwealth in the position which the World Bank<br />
would have occupied had the recent lean negotiations succeeded;<br />
except that we would not, as the lender, insist upon the conditions<br />
which the World Bank found it necessary to put forward.<br />
This is not a criticism of the World Bank, which has treated </p>
<p>Australia's requirements with marked consideration over a long<br />
term of years. But we are not the Bank's only customers by a<br />
long way; and it found it impracticable to give terms in respect<br />
of the Mount Isa railway loan which it had denied to other customers.<br />
In the result, the Commonwealth will find œ C20m, in the<br />
earlier stages from its own resources but later on, if that<br />
turns out to be possible, by some borrowing abroad at a future<br />
date. As between the Queensland Government and ourselves we<br />
guarantee to underwrite the œ C20m. on the basis set out in my<br />
letter to Mr. Nicklin and which he has told me is satisfactory<br />
to him. It will be widely realised that this has been a big decision<br />
for us to take. W~ e have taken it because we have a great<br />
faith in the future of North Queensland and have felt all along<br />
that this railway undertaking is the key which can unlock the<br />
door to major developm~ ent.<br />
I would like to be allowed to add for myself that I<br />
ara very happy to be able to announce these arrangements, and<br />
that I am confident of the great State and national benefits<br />
which will flow from them.<br />
CANBERRA, 29th October, 1959. </p>
