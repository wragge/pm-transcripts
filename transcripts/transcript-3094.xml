PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 156<br />
DECEMBER 1973<br />
VISIT TO AUSTRALIA BY THE FEDERAL GERMAN CHANCELLOR<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, announced today that the<br />
Federal German Chancellor, Herr Willy Brandt, had accepted his<br />
invitation to visit Australia. A date for the visit would be<br />
decided next year. I<br />
Mr Whitlam said that a visit to Australia by Herr Brandt<br />
would give the greatest pleasure to the Australian Government<br />
and people. It would bring particular satisfaction to the<br />
large and important German-born community in Australia and to the<br />
many other Australians of German descent whose families have<br />
contributed greatly to Australia's development. All Australians,<br />
Mr Whitlam said, would share in the warmth of the welcome to the<br />
Federal Chancellor.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the visit by Herr Brandt would be the<br />
first visit to Australia by a leading West European statesman<br />
since the visit of President Saragat of Italy in September 1967.<br />
Mr Whitlam said Herr Brandt's visit would be an opportunity<br />
to show that Europe, of which West Germany was a most important<br />
member, has a positive and constructive role to play in the Asian<br />
and Pacific region. Europe would find that its active interest<br />
in Asia and the Pacific would be reciprocated by the countries<br />
of the area and would be a considerable contribution towards the<br />
peace and development of the region.<br />
