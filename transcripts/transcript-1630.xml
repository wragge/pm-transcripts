FOR PRESS: PM. No. 77/ 1967<br />
VISIT BY PRESIDENT OF ITALY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt<br />
It gives me great pleasure to announce that the President<br />
of the Republic of Italy, President Giuseppe Saragat, accompanied by the<br />
Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Amintore Fanfani, will a<br />
State Visit to Australia later this year.<br />
The President is expected to arrive in Canberra on<br />
Monday, 25th September. Before leaving Australia on Sunday, ! st<br />
October, he will go to Melbourne and Sydney.<br />
The warm friendship between Australia and ! taly has<br />
been strengthened by the many thousands of Italians who have made their<br />
homes ; n this country. The successful assimilation of large numbers<br />
of his countrymen in Australia will no doubt be an aspect that will be of<br />
special interest to the President.<br />
President Saragat will be a very welcome visitor.<br />
The significant increase in recent times of visits by Heads of State and<br />
Heads of Government is a measure of Australia's developing stature and<br />
her growing importance to the rest of the world.<br />
CANBERRA, 23rd July, 1967. </p>
