PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE FOLLOWING LOAN COUNCIL MEETING<br />
MELBOURNE 6 NOVEMBER, 1978<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believe today in Melbourne we had an historic<br />
meeting of the Loan Council. The history of Commonwealth and State<br />
cooperation for the development of Australia is a long one, going<br />
back many years to the original provision of road funds, moving<br />
through the development of the Snowy Mountain Hydro-Electric Scheme3<br />
by special agreement between New South Wales, Victoria and the<br />
Comm-onwealth after that, special agreement for a number of water<br />
resource projects, and railway standardisations. Now, we do<br />
enter, I think, a new phase in the developmental relationship between<br />
the Commonwealth and the States. It ought to be understood that<br />
today represents a culmination of virtually two years work<br />
the philosophy was originally<br />
brought forward by Sir Charles Court, and that led to subs tantial<br />
discussions betw0een the Commonwealth and State officials. -That<br />
led to a decision, in principle, -at the last June Loan Council/<br />
Premiers' Conference meeting. And since then, Commonwealth and<br />
State officials have been going over the projects in detail to<br />
get the package ready to put to a formal meeting of the Loan Councilan<br />
d that has just occurred. The Commonwealth has felt able,<br />
un * der the present circumstances, to agree to the proposals put<br />
foward by the States, It should be noted that the proposals<br />
generally fall into categories that are going to strengthen the<br />
basic infra-structure of Australia, strengthen Australia's industrial<br />
base, strengthen Australia's export potential, and generally add<br />
to the growth and development of the Commonwealth. I believe the<br />
proposals put together form a very signifcant development programme,<br />
which is going to help, not only the individual states, but<br />
will help Australia as a whole. The fact that this programme is<br />
in place is one of the reasons why I loo1v forward to the decade<br />
of the 1980' s with very great confidence. I believe that view<br />
is shared by the Premiers. I believe also that the Premiers,<br />
as a whole, feel that not only their own projects, but the projects<br />
put forward by their colleagues are going to add very significantly<br />
to Australia's development. So, we do enter a new phase in<br />
cooperation bptween the States and the Commonwealth and its<br />
one in which the States and Commonwealth have played<br />
a constructive role, looking only to what is of advantage to this<br />
nation. There are one or two things which ought to be said in<br />
addition. The total programme obviously appears to be a relatively<br />
large one, but the annual borrowing requirement is a responsible<br />
one in the light of Australia's circumstances. For example, the<br />
borrowing this year of about $ 158m is not unrealistic at all<br />
the whole programme is based in realism, and based in getting<br />
Australia moving.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, just. a few minutes ago, one of the<br />
Premiers sa~ id that all of a sudd3en Simon the Gree starts behaving<br />
like Santa Claus, there has got to be a catch. Is there?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think there is a catch, but one of the<br />
bases on which these particular proposals have been put to us,<br />
of course, is that subject to Loan Council approval of the terms<br />
and conditions, the States are responsible for the repayment of<br />
the loans, they are responsible for the terms and conditions, and </p>
<p>none of its appears on our Budget. The fact that this Loan Council<br />
meeting was going to take place was well known to us when our<br />
last Budget was prepared, well known to us really from the moment<br />
the in principle decision was made at the June meeting of the<br />
Loan Council. Again, you have got to look at the phasing of these<br />
particular projects. I think they are going to assist State<br />
undertakings very greatly, and quite plainly the Premiers are not<br />
deterred by the fact that they are responsible for the repayments,<br />
they are responsible for any interest charges arising out of the<br />
borrowing. QUESTION: Prime Minister, can I read from this situation that the<br />
Government is recognising the need for stimulation albeit through<br />
the Premiers to boost employment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I think that is the wrong way of looking at<br />
it. We believe that the main stimulation is going to come<br />
from the Australian economy by getting inflation down further,<br />
by getting interest rates down and continuing a sustainable and<br />
steady downward movement in interest rates. We don't believe<br />
that significant additions to Government expenditure, especially<br />
off our own Budget for example, is the sort of thing that the Australiaeconomy<br />
requires. It is worth noting that these particular<br />
borrowings overseas, based over a period of eight or nine years<br />
are related for the large part to business undertakings or<br />
major developmental projects which are dependent upon other<br />
private enterprise decisions, for example, the Redcliffe project<br />
in South Australia is now dependent on a company decision, a<br />
corporation decision, and the Dampier Pipeline decision, wh~ ile we<br />
have given the clearance to that is dependent upon the North-West<br />
Shelf project getting underway. We hope the decision of the<br />
Loan Council today will assist the private enterprise in both<br />
circumstances in making final and firm and positive decisions.<br />
In this instance, the Governmental decision was necessary before<br />
the private enterprise decision to take place.<br />
QUESTION: Won't these decisions help employment? there is<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course it will help employment, but/ all of the<br />
difference in the world between projects of this kind, financed in<br />
this way, designed to add to the productive base of Australia, the<br />
export capacity of Australia, and the sort of financial stimulus<br />
that people so often look for through Budgets and through an<br />
increase in deficit finances.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, your not worried about an upward<br />
pressure on interest rates as a result of this decision?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, because by and large these funds, this year,<br />
anyway will be raised overseas,-and that wouldn't lead to an<br />
upwards pressure on interest rates within Australia.<br />
QUESTION: money supply?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The increase in the money supply would tend<br />
in the opposite direction. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Mr Fraser, it would appear that your aim in giving<br />
greater-overseas investment in Australia hasn't succeeded, and<br />
therefore you have to allow the States to borrow the money overseas<br />
for these projects. Is that true?<br />
? RTM4E MINISTER: No, that is not true. There has been a very<br />
substantial increase in private overseas investment in Australia<br />
over the last six or nine months, and the Treasurer will be able<br />
to give more details. But one of the things which needs to be<br />
understood is that this is part of a long-term strategy, this<br />
began two years ago, there has been nothing sudden about any of<br />
this. We made the decisions to examine the matter 18 months, or<br />
two years ago, that led to exhaustive discussions between Commonwealth<br />
and State officials, that led to the " in principle" decision last<br />
June. So right through it has been part of a long-term<br />
strategy, and no part of the decision making process in relation to<br />
these matters has been determined by passing matters of the moment.<br />
QUESTION: Why the World Trade Centre Mr Fraser?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Premiers believed, and accepted, the Victorian<br />
view that this would assist greatly in developing and strengthening<br />
Australia's exports.<br />
QUESTION: I would like to ask the Treasurer something if I could.<br />
Looking at it from a purely economic point of view and looking at<br />
considering the fight against inflation, is this a good or a<br />
bad move?<br />
TREASURER: It is a good move. I think what is forgotten is that<br />
we are talking about a borrowing requirement of $ l, 700million over<br />
a total period of eight years, and it is something which hasn't<br />
just arrived, hasn't been plucked out of the air. It, does relate<br />
to essential industrial infra-structure, it does relate to<br />
adding to the nation's assets, and when you look at it in terms of<br />
the total-addition to borrowing of $ 1,700m over a period of<br />
eight years, I think it is seen as a very responsible perspective.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Fraser, is the World Trade Centre for Melbourne<br />
at the expense of Sydney's development?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It is not at the expense of anybody's development.<br />
I think there was a general view amongst Premiers that one World<br />
Trade Centre for Australia is probably what the nation needed. Arnd if<br />
there isan acceptance for the development of a Trade Centre,<br />
in this city, then that would be it so far as that sort of<br />
development is concerned.<br />
QUESTION: Does that mean that Melbourne is the capital trade centre<br />
of Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That might be disputed by the Premiers of some<br />
States I am sure it will be asserted by the Premier of Victoria. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Mr Fraser has there been any limited placed upon the<br />
amount of money that the States can borrow, for example, in two<br />
years time can they come back and between them borrow anothe Ir<br />
$ 17 67m?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We have indicated our quite strongly-held view<br />
that there shouldn't be futther approvals given within a 3 year.<br />
period*-aind that is a view that the Commonwealth would want to<br />
maintain. Against -that, one or two of the States had indicated<br />
that if you get a prolect which was, or which needed a decision from<br />
Government, so that private enterprise could make its own long-term<br />
decision, maybe going years ahead, then they might want that<br />
considered by the Loan Council and we didn't reclude that<br />
kind of examination. In the Dampier project, for example, where<br />
we have made the decision now, the borrowing requirement is in<br />
1982-1983 a very, very long lead time. If there were other<br />
projects in that category they could be considered, but in our<br />
view there shouldn't be further approvals for borrowing within a<br />
3 year period.<br />
QUESTION: Will there still be a meeting of the Loan Council in June<br />
next year?<br />
PRIM4E MINISTER: There will obviously be a meeting of the Loan Council.<br />
in June there is each year, and there is the normal borrowing<br />
activities which have to be approved. I have got no doubt also<br />
that at its meeting the Loan Council would be wanting a report<br />
on these particular projects and on their further development.<br />
There is one other aspect which the Commonwealth stated, and<br />
wanted it to be a requirement which was very willingly accepted by<br />
all the Premier -to the maximum extent practicable the funds<br />
raised on these particular projects would be spent in Australia for<br />
the advantage of Australian industry in trade and commerce. If<br />
* contracts can be let in other words to Australian firms<br />
they ought to be. That was a requirement which the States very<br />
readily adhered to.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Howard is there any limite to the amount which<br />
State and Federal government can borrow in any one year before it<br />
affects money supply and before it affects our domestic economic<br />
situation? TREASURER: There are obviously dimensions, there are obviously some<br />
limits, it is never possible to quantify down to the last<br />
You have to look at proposals in the context of the economic<br />
conditions at the time when they are made, -That is what we<br />
did in respect of the proposals we looked at themn in terms<br />
of present economic circumstances, the type of phased additions to<br />
borrowings that would be involvbd over the next eight years, and<br />
came to the view that they could be very responsibly accommodated<br />
within the Government's overall monetary and fiscal policy.<br />
QUESTION: Is this a maximum figure? </p>
<p>TREASURER: It is a responsible figure in present circumstances.<br />
QUESTION: Is the decision, Prime Minister, on the World Trade<br />
Centre and the fact that this meeting is being held in Melbourne<br />
simply coincidental with Mr Hamer's electoral pattern?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If the truth was really known,<br />
when the Treasurer and I discussed the timing for a particular<br />
meeting, we also looked at our other commitments Originally, we<br />
had proposed the meeting on the 1 November but anyway in relation<br />
to other commitments it was going to be convenient to have the<br />
ieeting in Melbourne, so when it was shifted to the 6th we still<br />
had it in Melbourne. By that time the Premier had offered to<br />
make this rooms and offices available for the meeting.<br />
QUESTION: Is there any question that the general approval given<br />
today was given contrary to very strong Treasury advice?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Good heavens no.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, when will the economic stimulus from these<br />
projects start to ease the unemployment problems?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You can't look at any one aspect of policy in<br />
relation to employment and its impact on policy you have got to<br />
look at the total workings of policy. Let me take what has happened<br />
with General Motors over the last few months they have put on<br />
about l1400people, they have advised me that between now and next<br />
April another 500-600 people will be put on. They have introduced<br />
a new model, the motor industry is in a more buoyant position<br />
than it has been for a long while Ford Australia will be introducing<br />
their new model next year which should further help the motor<br />
industry. This sort of thing has become possible because costs<br />
are coming under control, there is stability in the cost base, we<br />
are getting inflation down below that of a number of other countries<br />
and I have been advised that significant sections of the motor industry<br />
believe that the Australian industry is now competitive with<br />
major elements of the motor industry overseas and is now rebuilding<br />
export organisations. This is the sort of thing that is going to<br />
help employment and one of the quite exciting things in Australia<br />
at the moment are the number of industries that are looking to<br />
exports. Some of them are smaller, some of them are larger, but<br />
we have colour television sets into Hong Kong, fishing boats<br />
made and designed in Western Australia being sold to half a dozen<br />
countries, womens' underwear being made in Australia and sold to<br />
Japan, furniture being made in Brisbane being sold to the major<br />
furniture exporting nation of the world Sweden. These are<br />
things that Australian firms are now doing. They can do it because<br />
of a cost base under control, inflation down below that of our<br />
major trading partners, and it is this kind of enthusiasm, this<br />
kind of performance on the part f Australian industry which is<br />
obviously going to flow through and affect the employment situation.<br />
We all know, unfortunately, that unemployment is one of the last<br />
economic indicators to start to improve but the policies we have set<br />
together with the general improvement in the position of the rural<br />
industries right across Australia, and coupled also with the<br />
kind of initiative we have seen today from the Premiers Council are<br />
going to take this nation forward into the 1980' s in a new era of </p>
<p>development and progress . which I believe all Australians can share<br />
in and be proud of -and it is bound to have an impact on employment<br />
and activity.<br />
QUESTION: Can you how many more people will be employed arising<br />
out of these projects?<br />
PRI14E MINISTER: No, I don't think you can do that. I don't think<br />
that kind of sum really makes it is very, very difficult to<br />
do, as I think you will understand, but more activity of the kind<br />
we have indicated, the fact that the sums are going to be spent<br />
to the maximum extent practicable on-Australian industry, within<br />
Australiayitlh Australian contractors, is bound to have an impact<br />
on employmen.<br />
QUESTION: Is the Commonwealth satisfied that all the projects which<br />
have received approval today are economically viable, or is it<br />
purely a matter of State responsibility, that they pick up any<br />
losses which may be made for instance, exchange losses, borrowings<br />
overseas?<br />
PRIM4E MINISTER: The States recognise their State responsibilities.<br />
On these particular matters where the Commonwealth c3uld have sonie<br />
expertise in terms of the location of borrowing, they ask<br />
the Commonwealth for advice, advising the available to them, and<br />
of course it would. But right from the very outset the States<br />
have put it to us that they wanted an access to fuinding that wasn't<br />
dependent up-on a Commonwealth Budget, for which they Would be<br />
responsible in terms of repayment, and interest rates, and any of<br />
the other associated factors going along with raising of the funds.<br />
So the States are recognising their own responsibility in this<br />
particular way, and I think that is one of the very praise-worthy<br />
aspects of the programme.<br />
QUESTION: the Commonwealth hasn't examined on a project by<br />
project basis whether they are viable, or not, it hasn't made a<br />
judgement? PRIME MINISTER: They have been examined between Commonwealth and<br />
State offici-als, but the main carriage of the project has to be<br />
with the States.<br />
