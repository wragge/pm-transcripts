E OE EXCEPTED PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS WITH STUDENTS BEIJING<br />
FOREIGN STUDIES UNIVERSITY : 20 IMAY 1986<br />
PM.. substitute for the hard work that has to be done on<br />
negotiating a comprehensive test ban treaty.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, I have a question too. Not long ago<br />
Indonesia forced some of your journalists out of the<br />
country. What is your Government's view towards that<br />
problem? PM. Where was this?<br />
A. In Indonesia<br />
PM* We quite frankly believe that there was an act of<br />
discrimination on the part of Indonesia. Ours were the<br />
only journalists who were precluded from being there to<br />
cc) ver the visit of President Reagan an@' it was done as<br />
a result of the publication in one of our newspapers, the<br />
Sydney Morning Herald, of an article which had some things<br />
to say about internal Indonesian affairs. Now, what we've<br />
said is that the Indonesian authori-ties have to understand<br />
that under our political system under that democratic system<br />
the Government has no control and seeks no control-over our<br />
-media and if in the media articles appear, we don't know<br />
what is going to be written, I mean a lot of the time they<br />
even have the temerity to be critical of me and I can't do<br />
anything about that. But the Indonesians must understand<br />
that that is our system and we think that their reaction is<br />
not the proper one and we hope that they will come to<br />
understand that in our system that s ort of thing may occur.<br />
We don't encourage it but if it does then they have to<br />
understand that that is part of our sort of system.<br />
Q. Excuse me Mr Prime Minister. What do you think the most<br />
satisfying result of your talks with Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang? </p>
<p>PM. Well I think really the confirmation, the very warm<br />
and strong confirmation of the relationship between our two<br />
countries. We see eye to eye on a great majority of issues<br />
of international and regional significance. We are committed<br />
to trying to build a strong and growi9Maionship between<br />
us on the basis of mutual benefit and we have many things that<br />
we can do and provide to help China in its magnificent program<br />
of reform and development and similarly there are things<br />
which can be done from China which will be of assistance<br />
in our patterns of growth in Australia. So the most important<br />
thing was the reaffirmation between the two leaders of what<br />
is a very, I think, special relationship between our two<br />
countries and the commitment to see this grow zakxomty as<br />
I have said not only in the economic field but in the areas<br />
of culture, science, sport and most particularly as I said<br />
there's a particular responsibility now I think to develop<br />
the relationship in the area of education.<br />
Q. What do you from your talks with Deng Ziaoping last night.<br />
PM I had them this morning.<br />
PM Well, firstly, he is a remarkable man physically. Eightytwo<br />
years of age and I can assure you his mind is in Al<br />
condition. He spoke perceptive-ly and at length about the<br />
essential nature of the changes that are taking place in<br />
China and. he put not merely in the short term of the Seventh<br />
or the-Sixth Five-Year Plan that's just been completed andnot<br />
merely in terms of the current Seventh Five Year Plan.<br />
But he was looking to the end of the century and the middle<br />
of the next century and was seeing in that vision China coming<br />
from what he described as previously a poor country moving<br />
up to the position where as you develop in the next century<br />
you will be attaining a position of the developed countries<br />
so that the level of income and the capacity for improved<br />
standard and quality of life for all the Chinese people will<br />
be lifted Very high. And it was very well, stimulating and<br />
moving in a sense to seekhis grand old man who had committed </p>
<p>3.<br />
his life to seeing the uplifting of his people still thinking<br />
not just of tomorrow but well into the next century of a<br />
China in which all the people of this country were going<br />
to be able to have a much higher standard and quality of<br />
life and that was very important.<br />
PM One more question<br />
Q Some Westerners think that China will stop our reformation.<br />
What do you think of this matter?<br />
PM That's a good question<br />
Q Whom do you respect most among our leadership<br />
PM Laughing well I'll answer the second question first<br />
but I will not choose between them. They are all outstanding<br />
in the job that they have to and I have unqualified respect<br />
for all of them. And that is not just a politician' s answer,<br />
I mean that, I do mean that. Now in regard to the first<br />
question, it is a very important question and I have been<br />
saying since 1983 when I first meet Premier Zhao in April<br />
1983 and I think he knows wi<br />
that I have been saying in Aus-tralia and in every country<br />
where I have been where this qiuestion has been expressed<br />
can the reforms last, I have'said yes, they are irreversible<br />
and there are good reasons why-they are irreversible. It's<br />
not Just think something'I say because it is the right thing<br />
to say. I think there are very, very sound reasons for saying<br />
that the changes are irreversible. And they are these.<br />
Firstly, in a sense as Chairman Deng said to me today. He said<br />
-we allow the facts to be the evidence and the facts are there.<br />
They are overwhelming. I , f you look at what has happened in<br />
the first area of change in rural China, if you look at what's<br />
happened under the Sixth Five Year Plan of the enormous<br />
increase in production but not just the increase in production </p>
<p>the lifting of incomes of the people in rural China which<br />
has now been extended into the urban areas. That is the<br />
first reason when people see the results that's important.<br />
Secondly, if you see the way in which incentives and<br />
opportunities have been given to people to develop for<br />
themselve s, nor merely in economic terms but in the areas<br />
of education, when people see that they are now going to<br />
have the opportunities to develop their full potential<br />
in a way that they previously couldn't have, then who amongst<br />
the educated people, amongst the professional people,<br />
amongst the technically trained people, who is going to say<br />
we want to go back to something different from that. No one<br />
is going to say it. If you look at the armed forces, the<br />
armed forces while there is this very significant reduction<br />
of a million people in the numbers, nevertheless the armed<br />
forces remain an important part of China and of its security.<br />
Now the efficiency of the armed forces depends very much<br />
upon an efficient growing strong economy and as the armed<br />
forces right through see and understand that the capacity<br />
of China, the Chinese economy, to provide them with the<br />
sort c4 equipment and services they need, has improved so<br />
much there is no one in the armed forces who is going to be<br />
wanting to change from that system. And so wherever you look,<br />
amongst workers, amongst professional people, amongst the<br />
whole system of education, everywhere you are going to have<br />
people who are benefitting from the changes. So there is<br />
not going to be any locus or opposition and reversion to the<br />
past. Thank you very much Mr Hawke<br />
PM That's the first lecture </p>
