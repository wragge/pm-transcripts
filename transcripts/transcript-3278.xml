PRIME MINISTER 31 May 1974<br />
Press Statement No. 253<br />
TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE AUTHORITY REPORT MUSHROOMS<br />
The Prime Minister today released the report of the<br />
Temporary Assistance Authority on Mushrooms.<br />
on 8 March 1974, Mr Whitlam asked the Temporary Assistance<br />
Authority whether it is necessary that urgent action be taken to<br />
protect the Australian industry producing mushrooms and prepared<br />
or preserved mushrooms in relation to the importation of mushrooms<br />
in various forms.<br />
In accordance with provisions of the Industries Assistance<br />
Commission Act, the Authority reported on 5 April 1974 that he<br />
considered no urgent action is necessary to protect the Australian<br />
industry in relation to the importation of mushrooms of a kind<br />
covered by the reference. Government action on the report had to<br />
be held over pending the outcome of the elections.<br />
The Prime Minister said the Government noted the comments<br />
made by the Authority, particularly his comments that the nature<br />
and extent of competition between the traditional Australian pack<br />
of mushrooms in butter sauce and imported button mushrooms in brine<br />
is far from clear; that an oversupply of locally canned mushrooms<br />
had developed during 1972/ 73; that events since July 1973 cannot<br />
be attributed wholly or mainly to competition from imports; and<br />
that the increasing quantities of imported button mushrooms in<br />
brine are catering for a demand in many ways distinct from the<br />
demand for the Australian mushrooms in butter sauce.<br />
Mr Whitlam. assured the industry that the Departments of<br />
Primary Industry and Secondary Industry, together with other<br />
interested departments would closely monitor the situation to see<br />
whether any changed circumstances merited further action by the<br />
Government. Mr Whitlam recalled that the question of long-term<br />
assistance for the Australian mushrooms growing and processing<br />
industry was referred to the Industries Assistance Commission at the<br />
same time as the reference was sent to the Temporary Assistance<br />
Authority. Because of problems in the industry which had been<br />
brought to his attention, the Prime Minister shid that he was writing<br />
to the Chairman of the Commission asking him to accord priority to<br />
this inquiry.<br />
