E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
JOHN LAWS SHOW 2UE 9 OCTOBER 1984<br />
P. M. : Good morning John. I feel good John.<br />
QUESTION: Well, it is a great day here in Canberra.<br />
QUESTION: Yes, and 28 here. Things are warm.<br />
QUESTION: Yes John.<br />
QUESTION: It is as far as I am concerned John. It is going to be one<br />
in which I concentrate on the issues and explaining what this<br />
Government has done and what the alternative is. I want it -to be<br />
a good clean constructive campaign. It will be as far as I am<br />
concerned. QUESTION: I'll stick to it. I can't speak for my opponents John.<br />
QUESTION: P. M. Well, I hope not. There is some evidence John, that the<br />
Leader of the Opposition and those around him might have slowly<br />
got the message that their smear tactics have been cournterproductive.<br />
And if they have got that message perhaps we will<br />
see a clean campaign.<br />
QUESTION: No, I agree with you. It has been the case I think that<br />
for some time now that the anti-Labor Parties really make a low<br />
assessment of the intelligence of the electorate. I said during<br />
the last Federal Campaign that I thought that they were insulting<br />
the intelligence of the electorate. It was done in a number of<br />
ways. I suppose most spectacularly it was put your money under<br />
the. bed type-of-thing. But there were others-not-V1. it. Mr-Fraser,:, and I~ am<br />
not about attacking him. In fact, I believe that Mr Peacock has 2<br />
t NWt.. fl. 4* </p>
<p>cont: made Mr Fraser look very good. But, there is a<br />
general tendency to try and get onto issues which are about raising<br />
fear and that type of thing. I really believe that the AustraliLan<br />
electorate, which I think is pretty well. represented by your<br />
listening audience. I; think they are interested in basic issues<br />
which concern their welfare, employment opportunities, inflation,<br />
interest rates, what's happening to housing, and those sorts of<br />
things. That's what people are concerned about.<br />
QUESTION: Well, there's a number of reasons John. For a long time<br />
now I have been saying to the people of Australia that I want: to<br />
get a position where we can get an unnecessary number of elections<br />
out of the way, and that I want to clear the uncertainty.<br />
My predecessors always played around and were not coming clean<br />
and saying whether there would be an election or not. So I wanted it<br />
to be established fairly early in the piece that we would have<br />
the House Representatives election with the half Senate, which<br />
under the Constitution we must have. The practice has been<br />
to have the half Senate election at the end of the preceding year.<br />
We would have to have had it by April, so you should have it at<br />
the end of ' 84, have the House of Representatives with it, save<br />
the people an unnecessary extra election. It will be 30 million<br />
to have the two together rather than 49 million having two separate<br />
ones. But, as you know John, as I have said to you before very<br />
importantly, having the referendum with the elections so that they<br />
will give the people the opportunity to say there shall in the<br />
future be simultaneous' elections for the Reps and the Senate.<br />
So that, Prime Ministers in the future won't be able to go calling<br />
unnecessary early elections.<br />
QUESTION: Yes, and if the people will pass the referendum that will<br />
mean that in future Parliaments will run their term, because<br />
Prime Ministers are not going to call unnecessary early elections<br />
-which mean they will have to have the Reps and the Senate<br />
separately, or call double dissolutions and put the whole thing<br />
out of kilter.<br />
QUESTION: I believe so, and I think people don't want unnecessary<br />
extra elections. So, I am saving them one by having these two<br />
together and trying to create the circumstances that we won't<br />
in the future have a repetition of all these unnecessary elections.<br />
QUESTION: Yes John.<br />
QUESTION: I believe not John. Two or three things I would like to<br />
say about it. Firstly of course, again I think that our opponents<br />
insult the intelligence of the electorate. If they think they<br />
are going to mix up NSW and Federal. People know that they are<br />
voting for a Federal election. They are deciding whether they want<br />
a Hawke/ Bowen Government or a Peacock/ Sinclair Government. / 3<br />
1 61 </p>
<p>P. M. cont: They understand that. Secondly, I believe that as<br />
we were saying together a little earlier7 I don't think people like<br />
this smear business and this crucifying of people on the basiLs<br />
of unsubstantiated allegations. Let me go specifically to the<br />
question of Neville Wran. I have been asked about it. I simply<br />
want to say this that whether Neville was wise or not wise in<br />
making a statement overseas about Mr Briese, there can be<br />
arguments about that. But there has been an attempt continuously<br />
to smear Wran, suggest that he is crook.. I want to say this,<br />
and I have said it before and I say it again on your program.<br />
I have never had put before me one single piece of evidence which<br />
suggests that there is something going t~ o the integrity of Mr Wran<br />
or his propriety at all. And I am not in the business of running<br />
away from friends and colleagues because they might be going<br />
through a bit of a rough, trot be-cause there are smears and<br />
allegations and innuendos. Until I, until or unless, and I don't<br />
believe it would happen. I simply say, until or unless I go-:<br />
evidence in regard to Mr Wran, or anyone else for that matter,<br />
that there is something improper about t: heir behaviour I am not<br />
running away from them. It has never been my behaviour and I<br />
am not going to start doing it now.<br />
QUESTION:. There may have been some untidiness in some areas, and<br />
all I am saying in respect of any inquiries that are going on<br />
John, whether they be the Costigan inquiry or if it becomes the<br />
National Crimes Authority investigation or Senate investigation<br />
I have said and I repeat, let the cards fall where they may.<br />
I am not in the business of protecting anyone and never will be.<br />
If evidence emerges that some action needs to be taken on the<br />
basis of admissable evidence, we'll let that happen wherever itleads.<br />
QUESTION: Well, I think basically colleagues support him, but I think<br />
over a period of time you can make some assessments about some<br />
people as to whether they are as strong in support as they might<br />
be. You know when Neville was riding the crest of the wave,<br />
everyone wanted to be there on his coat-tails. When you get into<br />
the more difficult periods when mud is slung and some sticks. You<br />
don't find the exuberance and the desire for association on the<br />
part of some people that may have exhibited it earlier. I think<br />
that is significant. Let me say this, there's very few politicians<br />
that have subjected themselves to a royal commission, as Mr Wran<br />
did. And it is very important to understand that he came through<br />
that royal commission, where he was subject to cross-examination<br />
and searching and probing he came through totally honourably.<br />
QUESTION: There have been, now all I am saying about that, the<br />
Senate inquiry is there. It is for the Senate inquiry to conduct<br />
it's investigation listen to the evidence, have it's examination<br />
cross-examination, and for it to make it's findings. And I am<br />
not going in any way to seek to interfere with its processes. / 4<br />
-1 V </p>
<p>QUESTION: Yes, there have been.<br />
QUESTION: Well, I think as I said earlier in the program John, we've<br />
had a classic illustration of it in the: Federal Parliament over<br />
recent weeks. The violence of allegations that were made against me<br />
I can't think of a more vile allegation and that I would protect<br />
people involved in the drug traffic I can't think of anything<br />
more viler than that. Now those allegations and smears and innuendo,<br />
were made. Now, the people have repudiated that approach in that<br />
it's justified the continuing faith tha~ t I have always had in<br />
politics, in the good sense of the Australian people.<br />
QUESTION: They accept that it's on, and Hazel who played a magnificent<br />
part in the last election, will I believe be there shoulder to<br />
shoulder with me in this one.<br />
QUESTION: I don't want to predict those sorts of things. I bel~ ieve<br />
John that we will win, and that we will. win well. I believe! that<br />
the Australian people by a clear majority think that AhstraJlia<br />
at the end of 1984 is a. much better place than the economically stagnant,<br />
socially devisive and confrontationist Australia at the beginning<br />
of 1983. And I think that they will confirm this Government in<br />
office and myself as Prime Minister. Now, I will fight the election.<br />
strongly, and I believe we will get a grood majority, but I don't<br />
want to predict what it will be.<br />
QUESTION: Well, I hope that one of the characteristics I have<br />
demonstrated in public life is a degree! of charity, and I have still<br />
got reserves of that. I can assure I am not getting personal<br />
pleasure out of his difficulties. They are self created to a<br />
very large extent. What the Liberal Party does about its Leadership<br />
John, is a matter for it. I would simply make this observat~ ion<br />
that in the circumstances which you postulate I would hope that<br />
whoever leads the Liberal Party in the future will come to understandc<br />
that the Australian people want constructive oppositions.<br />
QUESTION: Well, it would be and this may in a sense be acting against<br />
my own best interests. But, it would be to concentrate on the<br />
basic issues of concern to the Australian people because that's<br />
what the people want. As I say, in a Sense I am probably talking<br />
against my own best interests, because if they were to contiLnue<br />
on the path they have been on, there iS nothing more certain<br />
and it would be a totally devastating result, but that's not what<br />
I want the quality of Australian politics to be lifted. And I think<br />
an opposition has always got its part to play in that process. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Well, let me just go to both those points John. The assets<br />
test I think, will become a plus for us, because the closer<br />
we get to the election, the more clear : Lt will be to the 98% of<br />
pensioners that they are not going to be adversely affected,<br />
because the forms will go out and they will see that they are not<br />
going to be affected. There is only about 2% of all pensioners who<br />
could be in a position where they will have their pension affected.<br />
Now, that factual situation will emerge as will the fact, that<br />
leading figures in the Liberal Party believe in it. I mean I have<br />
lost count of the number of times that John Howard has either said<br />
or it has been reported to me of him saying to other people, that<br />
he supports that assets test. Now, he is looked at as the next<br />
leader of the Liberal Party, andT he supports the assets test.<br />
Mr Peacock when he was on the back-bench in Government, he indicated<br />
his support for it. Mr John Elliot, who is talked about as a<br />
future leader of the Liberal Party has congratulated the Government<br />
on it. Senator Chaney, when he was the opposition spokesman for<br />
Social Welfare, he supported it. It is quite clear that right<br />
across the spectrum people would understand the great burden that is<br />
imposed upon any Government and the whole area of social welfare<br />
realises that they have to be means tested, And they will try<br />
and distort, but as I get back to the point I make that ultimately<br />
I have faith in the good judgement of the people. You've had<br />
this terrible situation resulted in some of the suburbs of<br />
Sydney I understand, that because of the totally unjustified and<br />
misrepresentation of campaign that the Liberals have waged saying<br />
that there will be inspectors coming into homes to look at your<br />
assets, which won't happen, can't possibly happen under our assets<br />
test. You are having people going around posing as inspectors<br />
and causing great inconvenience to pensioners. Now, that sort of<br />
thing is despicable, and I just believe that the people will react<br />
against that sort of misrepresentation.<br />
QUESTION: It will be one of the jobs that we will have to do John,<br />
I don't think it will be the main one. It will be something that<br />
I am quite confident that we will be able to do.<br />
QUESTION: Well, the interesting thing there John, is that I have been<br />
saying for some time now that we want to start a debate in the<br />
community about what's the best sort of taxation base to have.<br />
We've started that discussion in the Economic Planning Advis~ ory<br />
Council with contributions from the business community, who in<br />
a very comprehensive statement have now said they believe there<br />
is a place for capital gains tax. But, what I want to do is not<br />
pre-judge the elements of a reform tax system, but I want to) really<br />
open up the community discussion and debate uponit. Andin thE! same<br />
way that we have produced the economic results since we have<br />
been in office on the basis of using the strengths of the community,<br />
consulting with them to do the same thing in the area of tax.<br />
Not to pre-judge it, to impose something on it. It is interesting<br />
to note that the NSW Liberal Party apparatus recently produced<br />
their economic committee report. Well, they said that in their / 16 </p>
<p>P. M. cont: judgement that a capital gains tax would inev ) ly<br />
be part of a reform tax system. Now, I think that the de e<br />
has just got to go on, and in the end we will get, as we a-3ve<br />
in our general economic policy an overall consensus approach of<br />
what's the best way of going about these things.<br />
QUESTION: Well, not just of itself. I think that there is an<br />
argument in principle for it. But, it is part of an overall<br />
approach, but only out of a process whereby you can get a general<br />
community understanding of it as part of a general system.<br />
This is exactly what the Liberal Party said in its approach.<br />
QUESTION: John, could I say two things.-thank you very much.<br />
I have been reading a bit in the papers about perhaps we mightn't<br />
still be having you on the sound waves during this period.<br />
Could I just say this that not just in the last election campaign,<br />
but in many that I have been aware of, you've played a very<br />
important role in helping community understanding of issues,<br />
in I think an impartial way. I hope that you are going to<br />
play that part for the community intheSE next few weeks.<br />
