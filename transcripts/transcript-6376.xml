PRIME MINISTER<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE ADELAIDE, 18 APRIL 1984 E. O. E. -Proof<br />
PM: Afternoon everybody. Right, whose first. Only<br />
PRESS: Does Australia have any intention of recognising<br />
Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor? into<br />
PM: Thats not a question-that we are rushing/ decisions<br />
about. What I've made clear is that the ijnportafit<br />
thing in relations between our countries is-that<br />
we are able to deal with specific issues that are<br />
of importance, like trade, involvement with them<br />
through ASEAN and in whatever issues that we<br />
need to talk about. Now theres been no problem<br />
about our capacity to do that and we will continue<br />
to-do that. The question of recognition in the<br />
sense is not a matter that is on the<br />
immediate agenda.<br />
PRESS: Does it come into the negotiations though over<br />
a seabed boundary?<br />
PM: Well it hasn't so far.<br />
PRESS: Without pre-empting the July conference Mr. Hawke<br />
PM: You know I would never attempt to do that.<br />
PRESS: What assurancescan you give Mr. Bannon about the<br />
future of Roxby Downs?<br />
PM: Well the Government has made a clear decision on<br />
that. I have no reason to believe that the Government's<br />
decision will not be sustained.<br />
PRESS: Myr. Hawke, is the Government concerned about the<br />
fact that there was a 19 hour delay between the<br />
times the Canberra Times received a letter fromthe<br />
bomber hoax and the federal Police were inforliLed<br />
and they carried out a check on Parliament House<br />
yesterday.<br />
PMI: Well its not a matter which has excited my mind. I<br />
have confidence in the general abilities and dedication<br />
of our relevant police and security forces. I would<br />
say this generally that there must be some matter<br />
of concern about the security of Parliament House<br />
and as I said on our programme this morning that we<br />
have got to balance the desire fundamental to the<br />
people of Australia to be able to have access to their<br />
Parliament House with concern about security and ' I<br />
think there will be a review of the situation and<br />
I hope it can work out in a way which is not going<br />
to limit the opportunities for Australians to visii:<br />
the Parliament House and yet to say watch the<br />
security considerations. .4 0 1 
</p><p>A.. PRESS: Are you concerned that your popularity has only<br />
risen to 751 this time?<br />
PM:. Oh well, in life in all the areas of activity there<br />
is always room for improvement.<br />
PRESS: At what stage are the submarine negotiations at<br />
the moment.<br />
PM: Well it is not really negotiations at this stage,<br />
clearly the Federal Government is looking at the<br />
question of building submarines in Australia<br />
and a number of States have indicated their interest.<br />
None has put their case more vigorously that S. A.<br />
through my friend and colleague John Bannon. Obv~ ously<br />
its a submission which will carry considerable weiLght.<br />
It will have to be considered with the others. ~ I<br />
understand that what S. A. is saying and saying...,<br />
is that youve had a a run down in your motor veh," cle<br />
production industry and that maybe some sort of<br />
continuing concern as the industry is restructured in<br />
Australia. It is certainly something that any<br />
responsible Government would have in its mind. Its<br />
been said that you have a skilled and trained workforce<br />
which could very easily and appropriately adapt-to<br />
a submarine construction. Now that a telling argument<br />
and it is one that will be taken into account by us<br />
in coming to a decision.<br />
PRESS: One of the main arguments or main concerns why people<br />
have prepared the submission is that while we've<br />
got the best case N. S. W has got more voters. ' I's<br />
it likely that it is going to be a political decis; ion.<br />
PM: This Government doesn't operate. that way.<br />
PRESS: Mr. Hawke in light of the shooting incident involving<br />
the Lybian Embassy in London are any checks being made<br />
on bona fides of diplomats in Canberra representing<br />
Lybia.<br />
PM: Not that I'm aware of but if the responsible<br />
authorities were making some checks I wouldn't<br />
necessarily know immediately, I mean not all the<br />
agencies of Government have to get a prior clearance<br />
from me before they can move,<br />
PRESS: I understand that you haven't actually spelt out<br />
or detailed what you believe is the pattern of bias<br />
in the ABC publicly.<br />
PM: No, and I'm not going to do it here. I have indicated<br />
that if the ABC would like to talk to me about it then<br />
I'll talk to them and I think I'm going to have some<br />
discussions in'the near future with the Manager of the<br />
ABC at managelen1t request, the matter may arise<br />
then. Don't lets get this thing out of perspective.<br />
I know the medias finding it difficult to find anything<br />
to criticse the Government on and I'm very pleased about<br />
that, but I've simply said that independence doesn't<br />
mean immunity from criticism, observations and I don't<br />
intend to say anything more publicly about that.<br />
.3/ </p>
<p>PRESS: Mr. Myers says that he doesn't think that Mr. Whi ' tehead<br />
will want to talk about that with you but you still<br />
insist that you want to talk to Mr. Whitehead.<br />
PM: No, you have a singular incapacity to listen or<br />
understand what I say. If Mr. Whitehead wishes to<br />
talk to me about it I will talk to him about it. f\<br />
I understand that he is a competent, capable an<br />
independent person and I guess be will be making-his<br />
own mind up and I wouldn't think that Mr. Myer will<br />
be determining Mr. Whitehead's mind anymore than I<br />
will be determing Mr. Whitehead's mind.<br />
PRESS: Would it be fair though to spell out your concerns<br />
in public<br />
PM: I haven't been inundated with questions or letters<br />
or representations about it.<br />
PRESS: Getting back to the submarines Prime Minister<br />
is the S. A. submission likely to be viewed more<br />
favourably in view of the fact that we lost the<br />
Alice Springs to Darwin Railway?<br />
PM: No it has no relationship to the Alice Springs to<br />
Darwin Railway, you don't make decision on that<br />
sort of basis because you perhaps upset someone<br />
with one decision therefore you make a decision which<br />
is going to unupset them arnd if you start running<br />
Government's like that you'll. quickly go out of<br />
business.<br />
PRESS: So you don't do deals like that in Government?<br />
PM: I don't and on the evidence I don't.<br />
PRESS; In the light of that Alice Springs to Darwin Railway<br />
decision, will there be a speeding up of the Stua: ct<br />
Highway?<br />
PM: Yes, we made it clear in our discussions earlier<br />
with Mr. Bannon and Mr. Everingham and may I say<br />
that in all these discussions that Mr. Bannon has<br />
taken a significantly more responsbile and reasonable<br />
line than Mr. Everingham, I made it clear that we<br />
thought the interests of S. A. and the Territory would<br />
be better served by the upgrading of the Highway and<br />
now that the question of the railways being disposed<br />
of, well then of course we will be moving more urgently<br />
in that area.<br />
PRESS: Mr. Bannon, are you satisfied with that sort of<br />
guarantee from the Prime Minister?<br />
MR. BANNON: Well, I've accepted the reality of the Government's<br />
Federal Government's decision. We don't agree with<br />
it, but its their right to make that decision and<br />
theyve made it. Now I believe we concentrate on the<br />
upgrading of the road, the acceldration of that.<br />
The Prime Minister has indicated he is happy to talk<br />
about that and we can get something done and so I<br />
.4/ think that is the productive way to approach this </p>
<p>and it will be in South Australia's interest to do so.<br />
PRESS: Mr. Hawke can you name any good aspects you see of<br />
Mr. Peacock's industrial policy.<br />
PM: I have enormous reserves with charity as is well<br />
known but it even stretches my reserves to be<br />
able to find any sensible qualities in it, It is<br />
essentially promising, of course this is hyporthetical<br />
because he is not going-to get the opportunity;<br />
but what he would be promising would be a return<br />
to the chaos of 1981, 82 which saw a wages explosion<br />
which brought about a recession in this country. ' I[ t<br />
60out of the mouth of the spokesman Mr.<br />
Mc -Phee who said he's an honest sort of chap<br />
and he said in response to a question, yes, of course,<br />
if this were to come in we would have. an increase in<br />
industrial strife. Now that is an absurdity, what<br />
you have to understand about wages policy and I think<br />
I'm probably able to speak with more authority in this<br />
area than just about anyone in Australia, that if<br />
you are in a recessed economic condition in a sense<br />
you don't need a wages policy because the awfulness<br />
of a recession does the job, it holds wages down.<br />
The time when you need an effective wages . policy is<br />
in the period of recovery and growth which is what<br />
this Government has bought this country to. Now we<br />
have got a situation with the trade union movement<br />
and the employers have accepted the concept of respo:-isibility<br />
of not making excessive claims and that is going -to<br />
mean that now in the twelve months following the<br />
recent decision this country is looking at wage<br />
increases -of I would think of no<br />
more than 21 and that in a period of recovery when<br />
profits will be burgeoning, now that is what this<br />
economy needs. Whats happened now is that unit costs<br />
in this country are steadily reducing by the end<br />
of this year it is my judgement that real unit labour<br />
costs will be down to the same level as they were<br />
in the base period 1966-67 to 72 73 which will be<br />
a better performance than virtually any other of<br />
our comnpetitor countries. Now thats what we're doing,<br />
thats what the business community needs, to become<br />
more efficient, more competitive, rather than this<br />
promise of return to the chaos and explosiveness of<br />
81/ 82. I want to assure you that there is no truth<br />
in the rumour that we've got a mole in the liberal<br />
national party opposition writing their policies for<br />
them.<br />
PRESS: What about your promises of good times ahead though,<br />
is that fragile?<br />
PM: It's not fragile the promise has already been delivered<br />
and it will continue to be delivered Just remind you<br />
of basic statistics in the 12 months from April to March<br />
210,000 new jobs created in the previous 12 months<br />
nearly 12,000 jobs disappeared. Inflation down<br />
significantly, interest rates down, growth up to the<br />
position where Australia now has the highest rate of<br />
economic growth in 1984 of any of the OECD countries.<br />
If you are not satisfied-with that you are very hard<br />
5/ to satisfied. </p>
<p>PRESS; Why are you in a hurry to have an early election<br />
then.<br />
PM: Do you think that is rather a clever question to you.<br />
I'm very genuinely relaxed these days, and I refuse<br />
to be upset by such a silly question and I will--<br />
generously respond to it. I would also I will<br />
make'the assumption that you have been out of the<br />
country and haven't had the oppoxtunity of-reading<br />
the many explanations that have been given. not<br />
that you don't understand whats been said. I'll<br />
put to you so that you will have the opportunity<br />
of understanding it now start quietly-and slowlythat<br />
there must be under the constitution an<br />
election for half the Senate before the middle of<br />
next year because the new Senators hiave to take their<br />
place by July of next year. So there must be an7<br />
election and it is much better for Australia that<br />
we get back into the situation of having our elections<br />
in the kilter rather than a continuation of<br />
disruptions caused by the previous conservative<br />
government, so we consider that there be an election<br />
for the House of Representatives at the same time as<br />
the necessary election for the half Senate. Thats<br />
whats happened 22 times before in the histo'Yy of<br />
this country. The point I'm trying to make is that<br />
at the same time as we do that we will have a<br />
referendum put to the people of Australia for the<br />
position to be changed so that we will have the<br />
synchronisation of elections with the Senate and<br />
the House of Representatives so that never again<br />
will we have the situation where conservative<br />
governments can play around with this issue of<br />
elections. Now they are all the reasons, they are<br />
reasons which have clearly have recommended themselves<br />
to the majority of the Australian people. Thats<br />
what we'll do. </p>
