PRIME MINISTER<br />
11 October 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
SPEECH AT THE OPENING OF THE CSR FIBRE CEMENT FACTORY<br />
WETHERILL PARK, SYDNEY<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Thank you very much Alan Coates, to Geoff Kells, the other directors of C SR, ladies and<br />
gentlemen. I am delighted to be here today to be associated with this very large<br />
investment of a great Australian company, the opening of a new plant that will directly<br />
bring forth a product which is integral to one of the great industries of Australia, the<br />
construction industry and the housing industry, and it's an opportunity to say a few words<br />
about the importance of investment to the future of Australia. It's an opportunity to<br />
congratulate CSR on its commitment of these resources, the generation of jobs for<br />
Australians in Australia which a plant such as this symbolises. And it is in a world<br />
environment of increasing globalisation and the increasing capacity of firms to move<br />
activities offshore, and understandably so when the economic environment in other parts<br />
of the world is so enticing and so competitive, it is an appropriate thing for the Prime<br />
Minister of Australia to thank and congratulate CSR for the commitment it is making to<br />
Australia and to providing job opportunities for Australians, and also to remark upon the<br />
improving climate for investment in Australia.<br />
We do have an environment which is accommodating to investment. We do have low<br />
interest rates compared with a year ago. We have a low rate of inflation. We have, apart<br />
from the odd glitch here or there, I think a very benign industrial relations climate and I<br />
believe it could be made even better when the Government's Workplace Relations Bill<br />
passes through the Federal Parliament and I congratulate CSR on the way in which it has<br />
gone about democratising its own work force and the idea of involving all the employees<br />
of an enterprise in the future of the enterprise, and removing the ancient divisions of<br />
" them and us" is something for which this company is to be congratulated. </p>
<p>The housing and construction industry have always been important to Australia. The level<br />
of home ownership in Australia is the highest in the western world. It was one of the great<br />
post war achievements of Australia that we were able to drive our level of home<br />
ownership in the 1950s to over 70%, and although it perhaps may be a touch below that<br />
now, over the years it has retained a very close relationship to that figure, and home<br />
ownership has always been very much at the heart of the Australian way of life. The<br />
prospects for the housing industry I believe are improving. The interest rate reductions of<br />
recent months brought about in no small measure as a result of greater competition in the<br />
banking industry I hope bode well for the fluture of the housing industry and I hope they<br />
bode particularly well for the future of the dwelling construction industry because the<br />
product of this new fibre cement plant will feed very, very directly into that activity.<br />
So for all of those reasons, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure to be here today. It's a<br />
pleasure to be associated with a new venture. It's a pleasure as Alan Coates said to be<br />
associated with the opening of a plant, the expansion of opportunities, the commitment of<br />
resources to the future of Australia and to the future of a great Australian industry. Can I<br />
also say, on a personal note, I like the fact that I'm associated with a new investment at<br />
CSR. In its old manifestation, CSR of course was associated with sugar. I think I<br />
disclosed to Geoff Kells at a meeting we were at some months ago that your company<br />
gave my father many, many, many years ago his first job. He was an apprentice fitter and<br />
turner at the Harwood sugar mill in the northern rivers area of New South Wales and after<br />
he went to the First World War in 1916, he returned and completed hi s training as a fitter<br />
and turner at Pyrmont, the Pyrmont plant owned by the CSR company. So I have a<br />
nostalgic personal family affection for your great company and how it's changed and<br />
grown and diversified and been a living example of the change and the diversification and<br />
the development and the growth in the future optimism of our country over all of those<br />
years. So, Alan and Geoff, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for asking me. I wish this plant well,<br />
I wish happiness and prosperity to all who own it and work in it and I think it's a<br />
contribution to a confident future for a great industry by a great Australian company.<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
