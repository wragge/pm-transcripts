PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH IAN McMINN, RADIO 3AW, TUESDAY<br />
FEBRUARY, 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
McMINN: Good afternoon, Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Good afternoon, Ian.<br />
McMINN: Now you've been given the kiss of death, you know<br />
that? PM: No I don't know that, what's that?.<br />
McMINN: Well, you have. Malcolm Mackerras has done a Lou<br />
Richards on you. You haven't picked it up?<br />
PM: Well, I've seen reference in the Press in the last few<br />
weeks that he said we'd win.<br />
McMINN: He's given you a 60 percent chance of winning.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
McMINN: That is very bad news.<br />
PM: I don't think so. I mean, he's looking at the evidence<br />
and I want your listeners to know I'm not cocky or<br />
complacent, but on the evidence that we have, I think we<br />
will win.<br />
McMINN: The evidence. What evidence have you got?<br />
PM: Well, the published polls and the, there's one out<br />
today, another one tomorrow which confirms that we should<br />
win, but I'm not taking, sort of, ultimate comfort in that<br />
because I believe the Australian electorate expects me to<br />
fight this election hard right up until the last day and I'm<br />
going to on the basis that I don't assume anything about the<br />
result. But I think in the end, Ian, the thing that's going<br />
to be important is that people are going to say, well which<br />
side has got the leadership and the team. Now on my side,<br />
my leadership is unquestioned and it's strong. On the other<br />
side there is just total disunity and historically<br />
Australian politics have shown this truth, that the people<br />
say, look, and they've said it to the Labor Party over the<br />
years, as you know, and I think said it rightly, they say to </p>
<p>2<br />
parties if you can't govern yourself, we're not going to let<br />
you govern the country.<br />
McMINN: In 1983 1 travelled around the country with you. I<br />
was then working for Network<br />
PM: You missed the plane once, mate.<br />
McMINN: I did, no that was actually in 1984 I missed the<br />
plane. We'll get into that at another time that's when I<br />
was working at Macquarie actually.<br />
PM: That's right.<br />
McMINN: Yes. Anyway, the images, the television images at<br />
the time and you were campaigning on reconciling the country<br />
and bringing it together, the television images at the time<br />
were very favourable to you and conversely for Malcolm<br />
Fraser, the images were of conflict. Now everywhere you're<br />
going right now, you're attracting images of conflict even<br />
to the point yesterday where you walked of f the podium, you<br />
did your block and Andrew Peacock says you're losing your<br />
cool. PM: Yes, I've noticed Andrew Peacock has said that and, as<br />
I said earlier today, I just hope the Leader of the<br />
Opposition keeps on believing that. Let me go back to ' 83<br />
in a minute and pick up yesterday first. The facts were, as<br />
people have conceded, that I treated as a joke what happened<br />
at the Opera House. I went up there to talk and deliver my<br />
speech and there wasn't a square centimetre on the podium.<br />
They'd occupied the podium and I said, come on I want some<br />
room to put my notes and we had a bit of a laugh about that<br />
and the whole audience were laughing with us on it, so there<br />
was no problem there. And then, of course, later on in the<br />
day I simply had a situation where I was asked to launch a<br />
magazine in an enclave in Parliament House and this zealot<br />
just took over and I just couldn't share that very small<br />
room with him and the people couldn't hear<br />
McMINN: But that was on the same day, that was on the 7.30<br />
Report, it got a wide coverage, but<br />
PM: it got coverage, but..<br />
McMINN: But the, but the evening news every night's showing<br />
you storming your way through pilots or whoever might<br />
PM: Not storming, not storming my way through. I mean,<br />
I've got to make my way through as I did here, coming into<br />
the studio. There's a group of them out there carrying on,<br />
making a noise. Well, I just can't sit down and wait for<br />
them to go away, I've got to walk through them I'm not<br />
storming through. But let's go back to the past with ' 83.<br />
In ' 83 you had widespread disillusionment with the<br />
Government. You had a situation there, within that last 12<br />
months before that election, another quarter of a million<br />
people being thrown on to the unemployment scrapheap and </p>
<p>you'd had a situation of widespread industrial<br />
confrontationism. Now I said let's change that and we have.<br />
There's been a 60 percent reduction in industrial<br />
disputation under my Government compared with that period.<br />
Now what we have now, the central core of the dispute, are<br />
these pilots and just let me, you know, as it's pilots, just<br />
let me remind you, let me show you that. Deadline ' 89.<br />
Exactly 12 months old and that was issue number one put out<br />
by the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots in February<br />
' 89. And what they were saying, they were talking about<br />
their prolonged industrial action, they were going to take<br />
on their employers, the Government the ACTU and the<br />
Industrial Commission and<br />
McMINN: What I'm talking about<br />
PM: And, and they've been beaten and in a situation where<br />
the community regards them as being unacceptable. They<br />
tried to pull on the whole community to get a 30 percent<br />
wage increase.<br />
McMINN: But I'm talking about the image on television every<br />
night and<br />
PM: OK, but<br />
McMINN: But the image on television every night. I mean,<br />
you'd, put it this way, you'd prefer to be able to walk<br />
around the place without being accosted by people and, and<br />
PM: No, no<br />
McMINN: And going on the evening bulletin every night.<br />
PM: No, not right. I mean, this is a democracy and if<br />
people want to protest, however wrongly, I mean, including<br />
pilots who wanted to, to rape the Australian community and<br />
said they did. And because I had the strength to stand up<br />
to them on behalf of the Australian community and not let<br />
them destroy the economy, they are still crooked on me. OK,<br />
but I'll defend their right, I'll defend their right to<br />
protest. I mean, I think they're silly in doing it, but<br />
they have every right to do it.<br />
McMINN: And you don't think that's going to detract from<br />
your chances?<br />
PM: No, on the contrary. I mean, it's quite clear from<br />
every poll the Australian people just regard the pilots'<br />
federation as having been an abomination in what they did<br />
and what is involved in this election is a question of<br />
strength of leadership. I was prepared, at a lot of<br />
obviously personal discomfort and so on as you are talking<br />
about now, I was prepared to show the strength of<br />
leadership. I said don't do it, now for God's sake don't do<br />
it, it's silly what you are going to do, but if you're going<br />
to take on the whole Australian community and try and get a<br />
percent wage increase, which increase is on top of your </p>
<p>average $ 80,000 a year that you're getting for 32 hours a<br />
week, I said if you think you can do that to the Australian<br />
community and destroy the community, you've got me to stand<br />
up to on behalf of the Australian community. My political<br />
opponent would have caved into them, said yes, you can<br />
have it. Now all I'm saying is the fact that they are<br />
making a noise, OK that's one thing, but the real decision<br />
that the people of Australia have got to make is do they<br />
prefer Bob Hawke, who had the courage to stand up to the<br />
pilots and say firstly, don't do it, it's wrong, work in the<br />
system. When they wouldn't, I said I'm defending the<br />
Australian community. They make the choice between that<br />
strength of leadership or my opponent who would have said,<br />
yes you can have your 30 percent.<br />
McMINN: Why, if we can change the subject<br />
PM: Sure.<br />
McMINN: Why is the ALP doing so badly in Victoria? Now<br />
every day I sit here and every day I get a lot of calls.<br />
You'd agree that there's a lot of seats that are hanging in<br />
the balance here. Why in Victoria if I'm told equally that<br />
it isn't, doesn't appear to be so bad in the other parts of<br />
the country?<br />
PM: Well, let's be quite frank about it. I mean, you've<br />
never seen me dodge an issue, a question I won't now.<br />
Quite clearly there's some dissatisfaction in this State<br />
with the State Government and, to his credit, John Cain has<br />
acknowledged that. He's said the problems in Victoria are<br />
the responsibility of the State Government and I thank him<br />
for being quite straightforward and unequivocal about that.<br />
But my point is this, as I said in Western Australia, Ian,<br />
where there was also dissatisfaction with the Western<br />
Australian State Government, I said this do people really<br />
think that the electors of Victoria are dumb, that they are<br />
people who act against their self interest? In other words,<br />
are they going to give themselves, as Mr and Miss Victoria,<br />
going to kick themselves in the backside to punish John Cain<br />
and the State Government? What this election is about, for<br />
instance McMINN: Well, in the West, by the way, Dowding resigned.<br />
PM: I know, but I'm still making the point that what was<br />
being said to us in Western Australia, the same thing that's<br />
being said here, let's, if you want, concentrate here. If,<br />
and I'll come back to the comparison between the two, but is<br />
the ordinary Victorian elector if dissatisfied with some of<br />
the things that the State Government has done, going to say<br />
McMINN: Like a blow-out in the State Bank $ 1300 million<br />
or whatever?<br />
PM: OK. Yes, but are they can I just ask you a question<br />
are they going to say because they're dissatisfied with </p>
<p>that, that we will hurt ourselves by destroying Medicare<br />
because that's what's an issue here, are you going to keep<br />
Medicare or are you going to have the Opposition mishmash<br />
there? Are we going to punish ourselves in regard to<br />
education? Are we going to punish ourselves in regard to<br />
wages? All these federal issues because we're unhappy with<br />
something that the State Government's done. Now my belief<br />
in regard to the electors of Victoria is they're not going<br />
to give themselves a kick in the backside to punish John<br />
Cain. I just don't believe that will be the case.<br />
McMINN: To punish John Cain?<br />
PM: To punish John Cain. Their concern is with certain<br />
things about the Victorian Government.<br />
McMINN: Well<br />
PM: The Victorian Government is not up for election on 24<br />
March, the Federal Government is and it's a choice between<br />
Bob Hawke and Andrew Peacock on 24 March. It's a choice<br />
between keeping Medicare or having it abolished. Now those<br />
are the issues. Now I don't believe that essentially the<br />
Victorian people are going to have different judgements<br />
about those things which are up for grabs on 24 March.<br />
McMINN: In the West, there was, you made no secret of the<br />
fact that you supported Carmen Lawrence and equally you<br />
weren't putting too many impediments in the way of Peter<br />
Dowding resigning. A simple question, should Rob Jolly, for<br />
the benefit of the Labor Party, resign?<br />
PM: No, I don't think so and that's certainly a matter in<br />
Victoria, but I, I've not said that. I notice there was a<br />
beatup<br />
McMINN: Would you like him to?<br />
PM: No. There was a story on the front page of today's Age<br />
which was totally unfounded. The author had not contacted<br />
myself or Bob Hogg. We'd put, neither myself or Hogg<br />
had put any pressure on Cain to that effect.<br />
McMINN: Well, you see, what I'm getting at is that here<br />
people are saying constantly a statement, $ 1300 million this<br />
Thursday in regard to the State Bank, the VEDC revelations,<br />
they feel that a lot of them and a lot of Labor Party people<br />
that have spoken to me on this station<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
McMINN: have said that they feel that their vote was<br />
cheated in the State Government at the last election because<br />
they feel that somehow or other the election was called<br />
before the figures came out. Now what I'm getting at is<br />
that should Jolly do the right thing in terms of the Labor<br />
Party and say OK, like Peter Dowding did and just say, OK<br />
let's clear the air, let's get that out of the way? </p>
<p>PM: Well, as I said in Western Australia, and let me make<br />
it quite clear, when I was asked the question over there I<br />
said this is a matter for the State people. Here, what they<br />
do is a matter for them. I don't intervene. I simply say<br />
this, as I said earlier today Ian, I know Rob Jolly going<br />
back a long way because he was a research officer at the<br />
ACTU and all of my knowledge of Rob Jolly is one of both<br />
high competence and complete integrity and this matter will<br />
be dealt with during this week and I believe, as I<br />
understand it, it will be shown that in respect of the Bank,<br />
the board had total independence and there was no<br />
ministerial responsibility for decisions. Now, in those<br />
circumstances, one is hard, is hard to see how Mr Jolly's<br />
head should be on the block. But having said that, these<br />
are matters for Victoria.<br />
McMINN: And so you're not ruling out the fact that he<br />
resign?<br />
PM: No, look, it's not a ruling out or ruling in. I'm<br />
saying<br />
McMINN: You're saying you've got no control over<br />
PM: I'm saying what I know about Mr Jolly, his competence<br />
and his integrity, that's the first thing I'm saying. And<br />
the second thing I'm saying that as far as I know, and this<br />
is something which will come out during the week, but as far<br />
as I know, there was no ministerial lines of responsibility<br />
in this matter. By legislation and by the way the<br />
administration was set up the board of the Bank and the<br />
executive of the Bank was entirely independent of the<br />
minister. Now, that's as I know it. Now in those<br />
circumstances it's hard to establish the case.<br />
McMINN: People might want a sacrificial lamb, like Dowding<br />
was? PM: Well, I'm not so sure that Mr Dowding regarded himself<br />
as a sacrificial lamb. I think Mr Dowding in his statements<br />
accepted that he had a responsibility, that there was a<br />
difference there. He was involved in decisions. I mean,<br />
there is no analogy at all. He said, I was involved in<br />
decisions, I look back on them, those decisions that I was<br />
involved in, that I had responsibility for, they were wrong<br />
decisions. I therefore resign. But here in this case, as I<br />
think will come out, there is no ministerial responsibility<br />
or involvement in the decisions.<br />
MCMINN: Now moving onto industrial relations where there is<br />
clearly an alternative between yourself and the Opposition.<br />
I see headlines about the Coalition talking about cutting<br />
labour costs and there was a rather confused press<br />
conference, if I may say, yesterday in Canberra between Dr<br />
Hewson and Dr Stone John Stone, he's not a Dr is he? I<br />
don't think so, yet. </p>
<p>PM: I don't think he's a Dr, no.<br />
MCMINN: Anyway, before we get to that I'd like to play just<br />
a very small snippet of an interview I did with Bill Kelty<br />
yesterday. I asked the ACTU Secretary what would happen if<br />
the Coalition tried to reduce the role of the IRC and move<br />
quickly to enterprise-based bargaining.<br />
EXCERPT OF KELTY: If that is the way it is going to operate<br />
then it's going to be the survival of the fittest and the<br />
fastest. We'd better be out there quick and we had better<br />
be fit, and we had better be fast and we had better do<br />
whatever we can in that market society to get whatever we<br />
can.<br />
MCMINN: Now you might have missed the first couple of words<br />
there. Well he's basically saying if that's what's going to<br />
happen they're going to go for it. Now is that a<br />
responsible position?<br />
PM: But it's not one doesn't have to be hypothetical. I<br />
mean we've had the decade of the ' 80s. At the beginning of<br />
the ' 80s the conservatives had exactly the same policy then,<br />
exactly the same policy as they want to put back now. So<br />
we're entitled to look back and say well what happened? We<br />
pleaded for them not to do it. But they said no, that they<br />
were going to get rid of the centralised wage fixing system<br />
and let it be hell for leather. Now that was their policy.<br />
What happened? You had a wages blowout and the economy<br />
collapsed into the worst recession for 50 years. Now what<br />
Kelty is saying, he's pleading with them to have sense. He<br />
said don't let it be a free for all, don't create that<br />
system. But he said if you do, if you're saying that's the<br />
way it should be, ok, we'll go and do it. But it's no good.<br />
He doesn't want that.<br />
MCMINN: But I mean don't you think a lot of people might<br />
think that that's a threat to their right to throw out a<br />
government, which many people perceive as not having sorted<br />
out the matters for them?<br />
PM: Well. Let me put it this way. If Bill Kelty had just<br />
stood up and said ' look, I don't like Andrew Peacock and the<br />
Liberals and the National Party. I don't like ' em. I'm<br />
telling you now, I'll make life difficult for them.' I<br />
wouldn't support that proposition and I would publicly<br />
reprimand him. But Bill Kelty has been totally responsible.<br />
He's been confronted with a situation and why do you think<br />
the business community is so worried about it they're<br />
confronted with a situation where these people haven't<br />
learnt. They haven't learnt in Medicare. They've had seven<br />
years in Opposition and what do they get up at the end and<br />
say? Sorry, you know what our record was, it was terrible.<br />
And it's no better now. Because after seven years we<br />
haven't got a policy. They are exactly the same in regards<br />
to industrial relations. After seven years they are<br />
promising a return to exactly the position which destroyed<br />
this country at the beginning of the ' 80s, which brought the </p>
<p>worst recession in 50 years, which brought double digit<br />
inflation and double digit unemployment.<br />
MCMINN: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: And so what Bill Kelty is saying, he's saying if that's<br />
what you want, if you want it to be a situation of the<br />
strong using their strength out there in a bargaining<br />
position, if that's what you want, and he said it's the<br />
worst thing you can do, but if that's your policy ok, we'll<br />
have to go and exercise our strengths in the market.<br />
MCMINN: So a threat to the electorate about industrial<br />
disruption? PM: No, a promise of industrial disruption from the<br />
conservatives who haven't got the good sense to learn from<br />
their mistakes at the beginning of the<br />
MCMINN: So if you vote for the conservatives, I mean,<br />
you're chucking it away. The point I'm getting at<br />
PM: Well let me say<br />
MCMINN: The point I'm getting at is that people feel<br />
bludgeoned by the fact that a Kelty would get on and say<br />
PM: No, no. Not bludgeoned by that. What the people are<br />
concerned about, including a poll that came out today of the<br />
business community, have said this is an AAP poll of the<br />
business community. They've said they see a swing to the<br />
Liberals could see the $ A at money markets sold off. They<br />
are saying that the Labor Government deserves to win. They<br />
are saying that they have lost confidence in the Opposition<br />
and they are saying there's the mirror image. You've got<br />
business and the unions saying look we don't want a descent<br />
into what you foisted upon us before, conservatives. You<br />
ruined the country before they said by opening up this free<br />
bargaining situation. Both sides are saying for God's sake,<br />
particularly for Australia's sake, don't let's have it<br />
again.<br />
MCMINN: They're also saying that the respondents are<br />
disillusioned with both parties, saying neither deserves to<br />
win. PM: No, a minority. The majority, and as you know, you've<br />
read it, the majority are saying Labor deserves to win.<br />
MCMINN: Interest rates. The key issue in the campaign it<br />
would appear at this stage.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
MCMINN: You're talking about interest rates dropping.<br />
Andrew Peacock's talking about interest rates dropping. The<br />
question is to, and I'd say a pretty cynical electorate, why<br />
should they believe either of you? </p>
<p>PM: Well if they don't want to believe me they should<br />
but if they don't want to believe me I suggest it's much<br />
more significant that they believe the banking community.<br />
Because the banking community has said unequivocally that<br />
interest rates are going to fall further. That is prime<br />
rates and the cash rates and the bill rates, but importantly<br />
that mortgage rates are going to fall. They have said that.<br />
MCMINN: Can you quantify that?<br />
PM: No I can't. What I do when I say I, that is the<br />
Government. That's essentially in this economic area myself<br />
and Paul Keating. What we've done is to take the tough<br />
decisions. I've had the guts to make the tough decisions<br />
last year and take all the flak to have tight monetary<br />
policy. Which we had to have. I mean let me say again to<br />
your listeners now, the last thing in the world I wanted to<br />
do was to hurt them or hurt myself by having high interest<br />
rates. We had to do it because I haven't burdened you<br />
with a lot of statistics and I'm not going to do it again.<br />
But in the last year very simple statistics. Our<br />
consumption increased by eight per cent, our production by<br />
four per cent. Just that gap was made up by sucking in<br />
imports. We couldn't go on doing that. So I've had to have<br />
interest rates high to lower demand. Now what the banking<br />
sector is saying is right, those policies are correct, we<br />
understand them, they are working. We have already started<br />
the reduction of prime rates. The cash rates and the bill<br />
rates are down substantially. And they are saying they'll<br />
come down further. And they are saying that mortgage rates<br />
will come down.<br />
MCMINN: And stay down?<br />
PM: I believe so because we have got, as distinct from the<br />
Opposition, we've got tight fiscal policy and tight wages<br />
policy. Without again I don't want to burden your<br />
listeners with technical jargon, but when I say tight fiscal<br />
policy that means we ' ye conducted our own public business in<br />
a way that's never been done before. For the first time,<br />
under my Government, we've got surpluses. We've gone into<br />
surplus. And we have had four successive years of real<br />
reductions in our outlays. So fiscal policy is tighter than<br />
it's ever been before. Wages policy tight with tight<br />
monetary policy. That means now that we can look to<br />
confidence, and the banking industry is looking with<br />
confidence to rates coming down and staying down.<br />
MCMINN: At that point Prime Minister we'll take a break and<br />
go into an open line after the break.<br />
MCMINN: First call to Ada.<br />
CALLER: I'm a bit shaky.<br />
PM: No need to be shaky Ada. </p>
<p>CALLER: Mr Hawke, look I've always voted for you, I always<br />
but I think this time I'm not going to.<br />
PM: We always get those in the election Ada. You know the<br />
Liberal Party always rings up.<br />
CALLER: Let me first talk to you.<br />
PM: Sure.<br />
CALLER: I am the mother of a young pilot, a young<br />
pilot. It cost me a lot of money to study. Look, now he<br />
will have to go overseas looking for a job. I came to this<br />
country 35 years ago. I worked hard. My husband worked<br />
hard for my son to study and now what' s he doing with<br />
trying and you my family. I don't know what you're<br />
going to do about this, young people. They're not people<br />
earning $ 80,000.<br />
PM: Ok Ada. Well thank you<br />
CALLER: They're not people earning $ 80,000. They're young<br />
pilots, young<br />
MCMINN: Ada, I don't want to cut you off because it's rude,<br />
but nevertheless we've got a lot of calls. So I think the<br />
point's made.<br />
PM: Ada. Thank you for your call. Let me say when I refer<br />
to $ 80,000 that is the average figure which the Pilots<br />
Federation have not questioned. That was the average<br />
figure. A lot of people there, pilots, were earning very<br />
very much more than that. Certainly there were some that<br />
were earning less. The average was $ 80,000 a year for an<br />
average of 32 hours at the stick a month. Now, exactly a<br />
year ago Ada your son' s union, the Federation of Air Pilots,<br />
made a decision. Not me. They made a decision that they<br />
were different from every other union in the country which<br />
had decided to abide by the guidelines. They said damn<br />
that, it's alright for everyone else. We are going for a<br />
increase. And they declared in February, exactly a year<br />
ago, that they would take on 1) their employers, 2) the<br />
trade union movement, 3) the Government, and 4) the<br />
Industrial Relations Commission. That was their decision<br />
that they would take us all on to get a 30% increase. I<br />
pleaded Ada with them. I said don't do that. I said stay<br />
in the system, put your case, there's a case for an<br />
increase. Do it like every other union of workers and argue<br />
your case. They said no, we're going to take everyone on<br />
and we don't mind how long we stay up. Just let me read to<br />
you Ada from what your son's union put out, Deadline ' 89,<br />
Issue No 1. They said get ready for a non-income period.<br />
Establish other employment opportunities. They said start a<br />
lawn mowing business. These were their words. Go and get<br />
another job because we're going to have a long fight perhaps<br />
but we'll win it. Now Ada, I could've, like the Leader of<br />
the Opposition, I could've laid down and said ok we'll cop<br />
it. But I wasn't prepared to Ada for a very simple reason, </p>
<p>that if I had allowed the pilots to win that 30% increase<br />
then the whole system broke down. You would've had a wages<br />
explosion and the economy wrecked. Ada, there's no-one<br />
who's sorrier than I am that there's been unhappiness for<br />
your son and for other pilots. I pleaded with them to do<br />
what every other union of workers has to do. They decided<br />
no, that they were going to take on everyone. Now in life<br />
Ada, I've seen it and so have you, you see people decide<br />
that they're going to pick a fight, take someone else on and<br />
they get beaten. They don't like it. I don't like it. But<br />
it was of their making and I had a responsibility to protect<br />
the Australian community. Now I'm proud that I had the guts<br />
to stand up when it was necessary, as distinct from others<br />
who would've laid down and allowed the Australian economy to<br />
be wrecked.<br />
MCMINN: Next call to Gay. Good afternoon Gay.<br />
CALLER: Good afternoon Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: Good afternoon Gay.<br />
CALLER: In today's Sun there was an article that Labor is<br />
going to give $ 160 million to help poorer private schools.<br />
It said that Mr Dawkins had planned to release the schools<br />
policy today but apparently it was leaked to the media and<br />
it's going to be lodged on Thursday. What I'm on about is I<br />
have two children currently attending Bacchus Marsh College<br />
and as late as yesterday we had a letter from Mr O'Keefe,<br />
the sitting member for Burke, to say that we had been<br />
rejected for Government funding. Apparently it's going<br />
our school is a non-demoninational school and apparently<br />
they're going to give it to the Church of England, the<br />
Anglicans, to build a school They haven't got a peg in<br />
the ground. I'm not having a go at the Anglicans, I'm<br />
married to one. What I'm on about is they haven't got a peg<br />
in the ground. We've got a hundred children attending the<br />
school. We're not millionaires by any means. My husband's<br />
a truck driver. We're working class We've done this<br />
with no fuss. We've had working bees, we've done<br />
everything, we've worked our butts off. Why?<br />
McMINN: Gay<br />
GAY: Why?<br />
PM: Thank you for your question. Let me be quite direct<br />
about it. In the period that we've been in office there has<br />
been an historically unprecedented increase in funding in<br />
real terms to both the Government and the private sector. A<br />
fact which is acknowledged by every commentator. Now in the<br />
allocation of funds, Gay, as between schools, there has got<br />
to be certain criteria that are laid down so that you get<br />
priorities. Now as a Prime Minister I don't sit down and<br />
say, ' well if Gay rings me up, yes alright I'll give her<br />
money', and I think you'd appreciate this Gay, there's got<br />
to be a set of objective criteria so that judgements are<br />
made between conflicting demands. No government can satisfy </p>
<p>every demand from every group in the community who wants<br />
more money. So you've got to have an objective set of<br />
criteria. All I can say, Gay, is that they have been<br />
followed and I think you will see when the details of our<br />
education policies are released and you referred to that<br />
that you'll see a continuation under this Government of what<br />
has never been done before. The public sector and the<br />
private sector have publicly acknowledged the fact that they<br />
have been given greater increases in funding and greater<br />
security into the future of funding than under any previous<br />
government. McMINN: Next call to Duncan. Good afternoon Duncan.<br />
DUNCAN: Hello, Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: G'day Duncan.<br />
DUNCAN: I'd just like to congratulate you on being a strong<br />
leader over the last couple of years and just to say to the<br />
listeners out there that we need strong leadership in this<br />
country and, you know, you have represented us and been<br />
strong as far as the and in the local view. I'd just<br />
say are you planning on having this televised debate with<br />
Andrew Peacock because I think it would show the people<br />
really what leadership's all about?<br />
PM: Well Duncan, thank you for you kind comments. Saying<br />
in regard to the pilots dispute and other things, in the end<br />
leadership is about being prepared to take decisions that<br />
you might get a kick in the bum about, if provided you are<br />
convinced that you've got to do it in the interests of the<br />
country and I hope I've done that, I've tried my best any<br />
rate. In regard to the debate, yes, the debate is on next<br />
Sunday night. I believe confidence that I can equip<br />
myself well<br />
McMINN: If I can interrupt, why wasn't the debate held at<br />
the end of the campaign, Prime Minister? Why was it at the<br />
start of the campaign?<br />
PM: I don't know. There was discussions between my I<br />
mean I have got, let me say this, I've got a supreme<br />
indifference to the debate. I had no involvement in the<br />
discussions, I left that to my people, they discussed it<br />
with, I think, Mr Eggleton. I mean, I am supremely<br />
indifferent to the intrinsic merit of the debate. I mean, I<br />
simply make the point, and again it goes to the intelligence<br />
of the Australian people. I say this on the basis I think I<br />
can win the debate, but just put that to one side. Andrew<br />
Peacock, the Leader of the Opposition, and I have been in<br />
public life for approximately the same period of time<br />
about 30 years. I've been in public life, I came to the<br />
ACTU here in Melbourne in 1958. I became a public figure in<br />
' 59, conducting the basic wage case. So I've been a public<br />
figure for 30 years. Andrew Peacock has for a similar sort<br />
of period. Now I believe this is why I say it I regard<br />
the debate as, you know, a bit of flim-flam in a sense. I </p>
<p>agreed to it because if I hadn't Mr Peacock would've been<br />
running around the country saying Hawke won't debate me-<br />
McMINN: Well he you the last time, didn't he?<br />
PM: I don't believe he did, and that's a judgement that<br />
people want to make if they want to. I mean, I don't<br />
believe he did. But any rate I'm simply saying we've been<br />
in public life for 30 years and I think people are in a<br />
position where they can and will make a judgement as between<br />
Bob Hawke and Andrew Peacock on the basis of 30 years in<br />
public life and I don't think one night is going to make<br />
much difference. That's why I regard this supreme<br />
indifference. I will try my best, I'll try my best. I<br />
believe I'll equip myself well. I think the Australian<br />
people are pretty sensible. They are going to look at Bob<br />
Hawke, Andrew Peacock. We've been around for 30 years. You<br />
can judge us.<br />
McMINN: We await this on Sunday night. Next call to Ruby.<br />
RUBY: Good day Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: G'day Ruby.<br />
RUBY: Congratulations for what you've done.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
RUBY: Over the last seven years. Is it a criminal<br />
offence to pay off the coppers?<br />
PM: Is it a criminal offence to what?<br />
RUBY: Pay off the coppers.<br />
PM: Well I think it would be, if anyone pays of f coppers.<br />
I mean, it would be criminal offence<br />
RUBY: But this is a thing I want answered and I want it<br />
answered properly. In 1984 1 heard Derryn Hinch say that<br />
his best friend paid off the coppers and he wasn't too<br />
pleased about it. But no way can I get him to answer that.<br />
I've put it through to time and time again.<br />
McMINN: Look I'm sorry, we're just going to have to move on<br />
because it's getting into one of those horrible areas where<br />
the whole station might be taking a call. I'm sorry Ruby<br />
about this. Bill, good afternoon.<br />
BILL: Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Mr Hawke, I'll<br />
come straight to the point. I came to this wonderful<br />
country about 35 years ago from the UK and I have a small<br />
business which depends heavily on interstate transport. Now<br />
my question is this. Now that you've established the<br />
precedent of military intervention during the airline pilots<br />
strike </p>
<p>14<br />
PM: That's a bit rough, Bill.<br />
BILL: This is how it can be viewed, I believe. But could I<br />
ask you then, now that a precedent has been set, how long<br />
will it be before you take action to remove the border<br />
blockades which threaten to bring businesses like mine to a<br />
standstill? PM: Ok, Bill. You've come to the point, let me come<br />
straight to the point. Firstly, there is no direct<br />
comparison between the dispute you're referring to and the<br />
pilots dispute. By definition, from day one the pilots<br />
dispute was a national dispute which involved a conflict<br />
under a federal award where the Government therefore, my<br />
federal Government, was directly involved from day one.<br />
Here this dispute, Bill, as I hope you'll appreciate, is a<br />
complaint that the trucking industry has against the<br />
Government of NSW. Let me say this Bill, that I agree not<br />
with the tactics of the truckies but I agree with what their<br />
concern is. Their concern is a very simple one and Bill,<br />
coming from a lovely country where you haven't got all this<br />
different, you know, one State system and things being<br />
different on one side of the border to the other, you'd<br />
probably understand it. What the truckies are saying is for<br />
good sake, why can't we have a national system of road<br />
standards and regulations. In December last year and this<br />
will show you how I've been involved and how I've got the<br />
answer I made available to the States at the end of last<br />
year in December, $ 120M which would help them meet some of<br />
the black spots in the roads, where the most dangerous ones<br />
where, on condition that they agreed to national standards.<br />
So I've given, as I said in response to an observation by Mr<br />
Greiner, I said look I've given you the key to the answer to<br />
this dispute. In December of last year agree with me and<br />
the other States and we can have national standards, which<br />
is what the truckies want. I think they're right in wanting<br />
national standards. I mean, it is silly to have a<br />
situation. But let me give you the most stunning example.<br />
Under the different standards that exist now, you can have a<br />
position that a driver can be regarded as drunk and unfit to<br />
be driving a vehicle in one State but just across the border<br />
he's a law abiding motorist. Now what the truckies want is<br />
national standards. I think they're right. I don't like<br />
their tactics but their objective is right.<br />
McMINN: We've run out of time. Just one quick one from me.<br />
I was reading Paul Kelly on Saturday last Saturday and<br />
he wrote the following, Paul, a very astute man as you know.<br />
Does your research show a desire to change Government but a<br />
lack of faith in the alternative. In other words, if you<br />
get in is it because the other mob lost rather than you win?<br />
PM: I think it'll be a combination of facts as I think<br />
there will be a vote for us because of the fact. For<br />
instance, just take some fundamentals. In education, that<br />
as a result of my policies instead of it being one in three<br />
of Australian kids staying on in education, it's now two in<br />
three. I believe, secondly, that they'll vote for us </p>
<p>positively because we've got Medicare, so that everyone,<br />
every single member of every Australian family is covered.<br />
They'll vote for that positively. I concede that one of the<br />
reasons why I believe we'll also be elected is because they<br />
have no confidence in the alternative. Just take health. I<br />
mean, it is remarkable, isn't it, 7 years in opposition and<br />
they have stand up in front of the Australian people and say<br />
sorry we got it all wrong, we have deliberately misled you<br />
since June of last year when our words were our policies are<br />
finalised, fully drafted, fully costed. They've been<br />
telling the Australian people that for over 6 months and<br />
they get up and say actually we've been telling you fibs.<br />
Now the Australian electorate can't have faith in people who<br />
haven't done their work, but more importantly who are<br />
fundamentally divided and disunited. The don't trust their<br />
own people, they don't like and trust their Leader, they are<br />
deeply divided, they hate one another. The Australian<br />
people, as I said before, have said consistently and will<br />
say again, if you can't govern yourselves, we're not going<br />
to let you govern us.<br />
McMINN: On that note, we shall see. First week of a<br />
campaign and having done three of them, not as many as you<br />
or Mr Peacock, I might add, but having done three of them<br />
the campaign can change. We'd didn't get through the calls<br />
and we didn't get through all the topics I'd like to address<br />
but maybe I'll put in a request during the normal channels<br />
but I'd like to see you back on the program in the last week<br />
of the campaign.<br />
PM: Well, if it can be managed I'd love to. Thank you to<br />
you and your listeners.<br />
