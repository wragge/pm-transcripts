    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Minister for Trade Simon Crean today witnessed Australia's largest agricultural bank sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the Agricultural Development Bank of China (ADBC) in Beijing.</p>
<p>The historic signing today will open the door on a new level of cooperation between Australian and Chinese financial service providers.</p>
<p>Today's official signing by National Australia Bank Group's CEO, Mr John Stewart, and ADBC President, Mr Zheng Hui, is the first major collaboration between agri-banking institutions of China and Australia.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Rudd and Minister Crean welcomed the signing as the starting point from which to build another mutually beneficial connection between the Australian and Chinese economies.</p>
<p>“This agreement has the potential to develop into a strong, bilateral arrangement with the exchange of expertise, skills and personnel in agri-banking, exploring a new sphere of business interaction between our nations,” said Mr Rudd.</p>
<p>The Memorandum is the culmination of 12 months friendly negotiation between the two banks on an agreement which includes the two-way transfer of agricultural and banking skills through staff exchanges and training.</p>
<p>“This builds on a natural fit between two major agri-banking institutions. National Australia Bank looks forward to exploring potential future collaboration in trade finance, agricultural infrastructure finance and product development,” said Mr Stewart.</p>
<p>“ADBC hopes to benefit from exposure to Australia's farming and agricultural business efficiencies with plans for staff training, business study visits and increased understanding of the Australian agri-business market,” said President Zheng.</p>
<p>In February 2008, NAB became the first foreign investor in China's trust sector when its institutional banking division, nabCapital, acquired a 20% stake in Union Trust Investment.</p>
