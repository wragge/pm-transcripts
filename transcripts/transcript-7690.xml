PRIME MINISTER, z~<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF THE NATIONAL AGENDA FOR A MULTICULTURAL AUSTRALIA<br />
SYDNEY 26 JULY 1989<br />
Sir James Gobbo,<br />
Members of the Advisory Council<br />
on Multicultural Affairs,<br />
Sir William Keys,<br />
Fellow Australians,<br />
Rarely could it be more appropriate that we greet each<br />
other, as we do today, with those words, ' Fellow<br />
Australians'. For looking around this room I see the faces of Australia.<br />
They are the faces of almost every continent, race,<br />
religion, culture, language and society in our world. Yet<br />
they are also every single one of them the faces of<br />
Australia. Here today are:<br />
Australians whose ancestors peopled this continent 2,000<br />
generations ago;<br />
Australians whose forebears arrived here two centuries<br />
ago;<br />
Australians whose grandparents and great grandparents<br />
came here before the last war;<br />
Australians whose parents sought a new life here after<br />
the war;<br />
Australians who joined us from overseas only in recent<br />
years;<br />
And the children of those newcomers who were born here<br />
among us.<br />
In all this diversity, one unifying theme is clear. </p>
<p>For all the differences in our places of birth, our styles<br />
of clothes, our languages, our creeds, our colours, our<br />
races, there is one fundamental characteristic, one utterly<br />
vital value we share.<br />
That is our commitment to Australia.<br />
Our past may lie with a multitude of the nations of the<br />
earth but our future lies unreservedly and proudly with<br />
one nation, with Australia.<br />
And it is our shared commitment to the institutions and<br />
values of a democratic Australia and to the freedom of the<br />
individual within the rule of law, our shared determination<br />
to build a great future for our children in this nation,<br />
that makes it so fitting that today we use those words,<br />
' Fellow Australians'.<br />
On this day of the launch of the National Agenda for a<br />
Multicultural Australia, I want to make two essential points<br />
that follow from this recognition of our shared commitment<br />
to Australia.<br />
First, it follows that all Australians are equally entitled<br />
to enjoy the rights and carry the responsibilities of life<br />
in this nation. We are all equally entitled to a fair go,<br />
equally entitled to dignity and self-respect, entitled to<br />
equal access to the services of Government.<br />
Those goals are greatly advanced with the National Agenda we<br />
launch today.<br />
The second point that follows is that, within our shared<br />
commitment to this nation, we must never be ashamed of our<br />
diversity.<br />
We should recognise diversity for what it is a great<br />
source of new talents and ideas, a catalyst for social<br />
dynamism, a true source of wealth in both its cultural and<br />
economic senses.<br />
Some people see diversity as a threat to our social<br />
cohesion. Some indeed would seek to use diversity as a<br />
means of setting Australian against Australian, and of<br />
denying some Australians a fair go simply on the basis of<br />
the colour of their skin or the country of their birth.<br />
Let it be repeated and understood at the outset: for this<br />
Government, for this Prime Minister, such views are<br />
simply unacceptable.<br />
Because it is not diversity that creates weakness or<br />
discord. It is prejudice and intolerance that sow the seeds<br />
of divisiveness.<br />
And under this Government, the days of sanctioned prejudice<br />
and official discrimination are over. </p>
<p>The days of the White Australia policy are behind us.<br />
The policies of enforced conformity and assimilation will<br />
live only in the history books where they belong.<br />
Multiculturalism embodies this irrevocable transformation.<br />
And let me say what a tragic loss it is that the<br />
bipartisanship on this issue that had so positively and<br />
constructively characterised Australian politics for so many<br />
years no longer exists at the Federal level.<br />
It remains a great source of sadness to me that the Federal<br />
Opposition is still unwilling to commit itself openly,<br />
honestly and unashamedly to a multicultural Australia, with<br />
multicultural policies.<br />
Today's Australia is a multicultural Australia. That is a<br />
demographic fact. It requires a positive policy response<br />
from all sides of politics.<br />
For a very large part of our two hundred year history many<br />
Australians thought of themselves as living in a<br />
transplanted British society.<br />
Our relationship with Britain defined our identity, our<br />
loyalties and our place in the world.<br />
And let us always remember with pride that the British<br />
tradition gave us many of the enduring institutions and<br />
values of our society our parliamentary democracy, our<br />
legal system, our concepts of rights and freedoms, our<br />
national language.<br />
Even as late as 1947, some 90 per cent of the Australian<br />
population was of Anglo-Celtic origin. This vast<br />
preponderance translated easily into cultural and social<br />
conformism. Our experience and tolerance of difference was<br />
limited and we had practised a restrictive immigration<br />
policy to keep it so, a policy that had presented<br />
Australians to the world as an insulated, introverted<br />
people, unwilling to play a proper part in the affairs of<br />
the region or of the world.<br />
Now we see Australia has changed. We have undergone a great<br />
transformation. We opened up our windows and doors to the<br />
world and we have been refreshed and immeasurably<br />
strengthened by the inflow of new skills and new ideas, by<br />
the millions of people who in the post-war years have built<br />
a new life in this land.<br />
The demographic measure of our multicultural identity is<br />
that now less than half of the Australian population is of<br />
pure Anglo-Celtic descent, and a quarter of the population<br />
has no such ancestry. Australians today are drawn from some<br />
140 countries around the world. </p>
<p>Among the new arrivals in Australia of course was the family<br />
of the Premier of New South Wales. I pay tribute to him for<br />
his stand on the issue of multiculturalism. on many issues<br />
we are far apart but on our commitment to multiculturalism<br />
we are as one.<br />
What is important in the debate about multiculturalism today<br />
is how we manage our cultural diversity how we ensure that<br />
the next generation of Australians will inherit an Australia<br />
that is confident in its individuality, enriched by its<br />
diversity and proud of its accomplishments.<br />
It was to develop the strategies and initiatives leading to<br />
that long-term objective that more than 2 years ago, in<br />
April 1987, 1 asked the Advisory Council on multicultural<br />
Affairs to assist the Government in preparing a National<br />
Agenda for a multicultural Australia.<br />
The Council went about its work with vigour, sensitivity and<br />
imagination, and was valuably assisted by the Office of<br />
multicultural Affairs in my Department.<br />
The Agenda that we launch today is the product of their<br />
work. It comprises three elements.<br />
First it clearly defines the policy of multiculturalism and<br />
articulates the long-term goals and objectives that underpin<br />
that policy.<br />
Second it sets in train a series of enduring structural and<br />
institutional changes.<br />
And third, it includes a significant package of program<br />
initiatives involving immediate commitments of some<br />
million over three years, and more than $ 70 million in<br />
total. Multiculturalism of course is only partly about enjoying and<br />
enhancing our diverse cultural heritage. It is also about<br />
social justice about ensuring equality of treatment and of<br />
opportunity for all Australians. And it is about economic<br />
efficiency about harnessing the skills and talents of all<br />
Australians. So it follows that this Agenda, not least its spending<br />
initiatives, represents an investment from which all<br />
Australians, whatever their background, stand to benefit.<br />
One of the principal achievements of the Agenda is that it<br />
begins to remedy a grievous injustice that has been done to<br />
many of the people who have come to Australia as migrants.<br />
For a nation desperately seeking the new skills that<br />
migrants can provide, we have been tragically wasteful in<br />
squandering many of those skills, because of our failure to<br />
recognise many legitimate and valuable qualifications gained<br />
by migrants before they came to Australia. </p>
<p>Some estimates put the annual cost to Australia of this<br />
failure adequately to tap our human resources at more than<br />
$ 250 million.<br />
That of course does not count the personal costs suffered by<br />
those who arrived with skills, as tradespeople or as<br />
professionals, yet who were unable to find the satisfaction<br />
of suitable employment.<br />
This Agenda establishes a National office of Overseas Skills<br />
Recognition and initiates other reforms to ensure the<br />
resources of our people are better used.<br />
The Agenda also includes a package of measures to improve<br />
Australia's language skills. Lack of English substantially<br />
impairs our productivity in the workplace. The vital<br />
process of award restructuring is diminished if lack of<br />
English precludes workers from participating in new<br />
retraining and career opportunities. Many injuries and<br />
delays in the workplace can be attributed to the inability<br />
of some to speak English.<br />
We will be increasing and improving English language<br />
teaching for adults and children, at a total cost of some<br />
million over the next three years.<br />
We will also give a firm commitment to continued support for<br />
second language learning in our schools with no artificial<br />
distinctions between community and economic languages. And<br />
let me take this opportunity to say how important is the<br />
complementary role of ethnic schools in our communities. I<br />
am pleased to announce, that on the basis of current<br />
enrolments, the Government will make a 10% increase in<br />
existing per capita funding.<br />
The Government has been very conscious, within broader.<br />
budgetary constraints, of the need to make an overdue<br />
investment in our human capital. This is very much an<br />
economic agenda. Indeed more than half of the costs<br />
associated with the Agenda are directed towards these two<br />
initiatives the recognition of overseas qualifications,<br />
and the improvement of English language tuition.<br />
In addition to these economic considerations, we have also<br />
been conscious of the social justice dimension of<br />
multiculturalism. In the past many Australians have been denied their fair<br />
entitlement to Government services because of barriers of<br />
culture, language and race. It was in order to improve<br />
access and ensure greater equity that my Government adopted<br />
its access and equity strategy.<br />
The National Agenda takes that process much further today,<br />
by dramatically strengthening and reinforcing the<br />
requirement for Commonwealth agencies to design their<br />
policies and deliver their services in a way that reflects<br />
the cultural diversity of contemporary Australia. </p>
<p>To that end there are specific measures directed towards the<br />
aged, the young, women, Aboriginals, and people living in<br />
rural and provincial areas, and concrete initiatives in the<br />
areas of community services and health, consumer education<br />
and the arts.<br />
In framing the Agenda we have also been conscious of the<br />
importance of retaining and enhancing harmonious community<br />
-relat-i-ons.<br />
A major Agenda initiative is a 3-year community relations<br />
campaign, the most ambitious such campaign ever mounted in<br />
Australia, that will tackle personal prejudice and<br />
intolerant behaviour. It will commence next year, after the<br />
Human Rights Commission has reported on its current inquiry<br />
into racist violence.<br />
The Special Broadcasting Service SBS also has a critical<br />
role to play in reshaping and modernizing Australia's image<br />
of itself. SBS television is a medium for all Australians,<br />
reflecting and conveying the many faces and many ways of<br />
being Australian.<br />
Therefore, as part of the National Agenda, we have decided<br />
to guarantee the security and integrity of SBS by giving it<br />
its own legislation and by extending it to the Northern<br />
Territory and non-metropolitan regions of Queensland,<br />
Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.<br />
Finally, the Government will consider the merits of<br />
introducing a Multiculturalism Act, partly in order to<br />
define both the ambit and limits of the policy. Such<br />
legislation could also be used to reinforce the Government's<br />
access and equity strategy, to establish a statutory body on<br />
multicultural issues, to give formal recognition to English<br />
as the national language, and to deal at the Commonwealth<br />
level with the problem of racial vilification.<br />
Any decision to proceed with such an Act will depend on the<br />
outcome of community consultation about its desirability and<br />
possible content. I would urge everyone here to contribute<br />
to that process.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Let me say again how much the Government appreciates the<br />
efforts of the Advisory Council on Multicultural Affairs<br />
under the able leadership of Sir James Gobbo and Mr George<br />
Wojak. The Council has made an absolutely critical contribution to<br />
the shape and content of the Agenda and of the initiatives I<br />
have announced this morning. </p>
<p>In the light of this splendid work, I have this week decided<br />
to extend the term of the current Advisory Council by a<br />
further 12 months. I will be inviting all members of the<br />
Council who so wish, to remain on the Council and to help in<br />
the deliberations about the merits of a Multiculturalism<br />
Act. I take particular pleasure in announcing a new member of the<br />
Advisory Council today, a great Australian, and, as we have<br />
heard today, one passionately committed to a multicultural<br />
future. I speak of course of Sir William Keys.<br />
I have also asked Sir William to chair the new National<br />
Advisory Committee on Overseas Skills Recognition.<br />
There can be no doubt that a man of Sir William's experience<br />
in business, in public life and in community service, and<br />
who is held in such high regard throughout Australian<br />
society, will. perform these crucial tasks with diligence and<br />
distinction. Ladies and Gentlemen, we are living through a period of<br />
major social and economic change.<br />
These changes are profound and they bring with them stresses<br />
and tensions.<br />
The monocultural Australia imagined by our parents'<br />
generation has passed forever. It has been, and remains,<br />
the challenge of our generation to achieve the transition to<br />
a new, multicultural Australia. We are part way through<br />
that process. We are all, in our way, contributing to it.<br />
The National Agenda aims to see it to a conclusion.<br />
Let me close by quoting the first of the goals proposed by<br />
the Advisory Council in its definition of multiculturalism.<br />
It could not be simpler or clearer: " All Australians should<br />
have a commitment to Australia and share responsibility for<br />
furthering our national interests."<br />
If we hold fact to that principle, then our children and<br />
grandchildren, the next generations, will have much for<br />
which to thank us. They will inherit an Australia that is<br />
more tolerant, more fair and more prosperous than any we<br />
have known. </p>
