COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
Hon. L. H. E. BURY, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
HOMES SAVINGS GRANT BILL 1964<br />
SECOND READING<br />
[ From the Parliamentary Debates," 5th May, 1964.]<br />
Mr. BURY ( Wentworth-Minister for<br />
Housing) [ 8.54.-1 move-<br />
That the bill be now read a second time.<br />
The purpose of this bill is to help young<br />
married couples obtain a home of their own<br />
by authorizing payment to them by the<br />
Commonwealth of tax-free grants to supplement<br />
their own savings. It is designed to<br />
increase the proportion of national resources<br />
vail able for housing purposes by providing<br />
-astrong inducement to young people to save<br />
in ways which provide funds for investment<br />
in housing.<br />
Housing is vital to the welfare and happiness<br />
of individuals and thus to our future<br />
evelopment as a nation. Without proper<br />
housing, the process of marriage and family<br />
formation which are the very essence of<br />
Australia's future must be seriously impaired.<br />
The Government seeks, moreover,<br />
to foster a healthy property-owning democracy<br />
of sturdy independent individuals and<br />
regards home ownership as a basic<br />
ingredient. It is a linchpin of family life.<br />
Our constant quest to expand and develop<br />
Australia demands large-scale immigration,<br />
and more people need more houses. In the<br />
absence of special measures, housing could<br />
become a limiting factor to our population<br />
growth. Most of us are conscious too that.<br />
we shall shortly be moving into a period in<br />
which the marriage rate in our existing<br />
population is likely to rise substantially. We<br />
must be ready to meet this position as it<br />
arises. 5723/ 64. In housing we shall always fall short of<br />
the ideal. We can be proud, however, that<br />
despite all the difficulties we have been<br />
through since World War II., and the present<br />
shortcomings evident to all of us, we<br />
probably have more accommodation available<br />
per head than any other country. It<br />
behoves us to maintain and improve this<br />
record. However good, it is small consolation<br />
to those without a home.<br />
Australia, under the present Government,<br />
is a rapidly developing country of increasing<br />
wealth. By and large, Australians are able<br />
to afford a relatively high standard of housing,,<br />
and it is the wish of almost every<br />
married couple to own a home of their own.<br />
However, in the early years of marriage<br />
there are numerous calls upon savings, and<br />
many couples are compelled to postpone<br />
home ownership. We believe that these<br />
young people should be assisted to attain<br />
this most desirable objective. However, to<br />
merit this assistance, young people, both<br />
before and after marriage, should make<br />
some effort themselves by saving a portion<br />
of their incomes.<br />
The Government has become particularly<br />
concerned with the difficulties facing many<br />
homeseekers in raising sufficient funds for a<br />
deposit large enough to meet the requirements<br />
of lending institutions. This problem<br />
applies particularly to young married persons.<br />
The causes of this situation are complex,<br />
but two factors are worthy of particular<br />
notice-the rising price of land, </p>
<p>especially in the vicinity of our capital cities,<br />
and the availability of funds from lending<br />
institutions. There is little the Commonwealth Government<br />
can do about the price of land.<br />
It has become increasingly scarce relative to<br />
demand and nowadays building blocks often<br />
have to bear the cost of development work<br />
such as water and sewerage, roadmaking and<br />
other charges in their initial price. These<br />
are State matters. The availability of funds<br />
is also highly critical and is subject to Commonwealth<br />
influence. Basically, in a fully<br />
employed economy, additional resources<br />
can only be devoted to housing if less are<br />
applied elsewhere. One cannot eat one's<br />
cake and have it. Overcoming any housing<br />
shortage, therefore, entails some diversion<br />
of funds from other uses to housing finance.<br />
The Prime Minister ( Sir Robert Menzies),<br />
in his policy speech made on 2th November<br />
last, promised a two-pronged attack on<br />
this problem-first, a scheme for home<br />
savings grants for young married persons<br />
up to the age of 35, and secondly, the<br />
establishment of a mortgage-insurance corporation<br />
to insure mortgages up to a high<br />
proportion of the value of a house and<br />
land. This bill represents the first instalment<br />
of the new housing policy. It provides<br />
both for assistance to young married<br />
people seeking a home and for a means<br />
whereby additional savings can be made<br />
available for housing purposes. Its provisions<br />
cover broadly the nature of the<br />
grant, the definition of persons who will<br />
qualify, the homes eligible for the grant,<br />
acceptable savings, the period and amount<br />
of saving, information to be submitted, the<br />
manner and time of payment and the<br />
necessary administrative arrangements.<br />
In the introduction of a new scheme such<br />
as this, certain interim difficulties are<br />
inevitable until its details are widely understood<br />
and people affected have had time<br />
to adjust their affairs to meet its requirements.<br />
The need for interim provisions to<br />
cover savings until they can be put into<br />
one of the permanent forms which will<br />
ultimately be required is particularly<br />
apparent. I have allowed as far as<br />
practicable for the temporary problems<br />
which can already be foreseen, but feel<br />
obliged to ask the House for a wide measure<br />
of administrative discretion until the scheme<br />
has settled down to a routine basis in its<br />
permanent framework. It will be readily recalled by honorable members that the<br />
procedures under our social services legislation-<br />
those most closely akin to thesehave<br />
been refined by practical experience<br />
over 50 years.<br />
This bill, when it becomes law, will<br />
authorize the payment of a Commonwealth<br />
grant of œ 1 for every œ 3 of acceptable<br />
savings for a home by persons aged less<br />
than 36 years. The acceptable savings of<br />
each partner to a marriage will be eligible<br />
for the grant, but the total grant payable<br />
in respect of a home will be œ 250. Th<br />
grant will be an addition to savings mad,_<br />
over a number of years and will be payable<br />
in respect of a home anywhere in Australia.<br />
The bill provides that a person eligible<br />
for the grant must be under 36 years of<br />
age, not only at the date of marriage, bt)<br />
also at the time when one or both of a<br />
married couple sign a contract to buy or<br />
build the home, or commence its construction.<br />
Although a grant will not be<br />
paid to an unmarried person, young people<br />
contemplating marriage may take steps to<br />
acquire a home and become eligible for<br />
the grant when they are married. But if<br />
they do this, they must marry and submit<br />
a claim for the grant within twelve months<br />
of taking steps to acquire the home.<br />
To be eligible, a person must have lived<br />
in Australia and have accumulated accep<br />
table savings in Australia for at least three<br />
years. There is, of course, no maximum<br />
savings period. The sooner saving commences,<br />
the easier it will be to accumulate<br />
maximum acceptable savings of œ 750. A<br />
person need not have been born in Aus<br />
tralia nor have become naturalized. Newcomers<br />
to Australia who have lived here for<br />
at least three years, are married and intend<br />
to continue to live here, are eligible. The<br />
legislation also provides that a temporary<br />
absence from Australia, such as an overseas<br />
holiday of business trip, may be counted<br />
as residence in Australia. Moreover, a<br />
number of young Australian citizens work<br />
or study overseas. These young people,<br />
if they deposit savings in a bank in Australia<br />
for at least three years and live in<br />
Australia during the three months before<br />
taking steps to acquire a home, will be<br />
eligible for the grant. Australian citizens in<br />
the Territory of Papua and New Guinea<br />
and our other external Territories may<br />
save with a branch of an Australian bank<br />
and become eligible for a grant in respect<br />
of a home in Australia. </p>
<p>Once a person has received a home<br />
savings grant, he or she will be ineligible<br />
for a further grant. The marriage partner<br />
of a person who receives a grant, and<br />
subsequently remarries, also will be<br />
ineligible. However, the person with whom<br />
remarriage takes place will be eligible, provided<br />
he or she has not received a grant.<br />
Mr. Whitlam.-The second spouse will<br />
be eligible?<br />
Mr. BURY.-Yes, whatever may be the<br />
,'" ltatus of the person remarrying. A widow<br />
'.. kor example, may marry again.<br />
Before aperson may become eligible he<br />
or his marriage partner must have taken<br />
steps to acquire a home. Home ownership<br />
is the objective of the scheme. To be<br />
jligible a person, or that person's husband,<br />
or both of them jointly, on or after 2nd<br />
December, 1963, the commencement date<br />
of the scheme must-I wish to exphasize<br />
the word must<br />
have entered into a contract in<br />
writing to buy an existing house and<br />
land or the right to occupy a flat or<br />
home unit; or<br />
have entered into a contract in<br />
writing with a building contractor for<br />
the erection of a home on land held<br />
by one or both of them in an approved<br />
form; or<br />
if an owner-builder, have commenced<br />
the construction of a home on<br />
land held by one or both of them in an<br />
approved form.<br />
The husband or the wife or both may be<br />
jeligible persons provided each has saved<br />
for at least three years. Although the<br />
savings of the husband and the wife will be<br />
treated as separate individual savings, the<br />
maximum acceptable savings in respect of<br />
one home will be œ 750, and the maximum<br />
grant to husband or wife of both will be<br />
œ 250. If the husband and wife have deposited<br />
their savings in a joint account in<br />
both their names, half of these savings will<br />
be deemed to be those of the husband and<br />
the other half those of the wife. If only one<br />
of them is eligible, half the joint savings will<br />
be deemed to be those of the eligible<br />
person. I now propose to refer to homes<br />
eligible for the grant. Broadly speaking,<br />
to be eligible a home must be the<br />
first home owrned by either or<br />
both of the married couple upon or after marriage. It may be either<br />
a house or a home unit. By and large,<br />
ownership of a home by either partner at<br />
the time of marriage will exclude both of<br />
them from eligibility for the grant, for the<br />
good reasons that they may either occupy<br />
it as their matrimonial home or sell it and<br />
use the proceeds to buy another home. It<br />
is not, however, our intention to deny payment<br />
of the grant to eligible young people<br />
who buy or build, before they are married,<br />
the home they intend to live in after<br />
marriage. If one or both of a married<br />
couple signed a contract to buy or build<br />
the home, or commenced the construction<br />
of the home prior to marriage, and this<br />
home is occupied as the matrimonial home,<br />
it will be eligible provided one or both of<br />
the couple did not own another home in<br />
Australia upon or after marriage.<br />
For obvious reasons, a building condemned<br />
as unfit for human habitation or<br />
listed for demolition will not be eligible.<br />
If the home is being newly constructed,<br />
the plans must have been approved by the<br />
local authority. The home must also be<br />
built on land of which one or both of the<br />
married couple are, or are entitled to be.<br />
registered as the proprietor, or on land<br />
which one or both of the married couple<br />
holds on lease or as a life interest, and<br />
my department is satisfied that the terms<br />
of the lease or the life interest offer a<br />
reasonable prospect of security of tenure<br />
for a sufficient period of years. In the<br />
case of a home unit, we must, of course,<br />
be satisfied that the purchaser will receive<br />
a title to a particular flat or apartment,<br />
or an assurance of the right to occupy it.<br />
Mr. Duthie.-I reckon about ten people<br />
will qualify for these benefits.<br />
Mr. BURY.-If that is the honorable<br />
member's view I invite him to meet the<br />
cost of this legislation. There are, however,<br />
certain classes of dwellings which,<br />
when purchased, will not be eligible for<br />
the grant. As honorable members know,<br />
the Commonwealth is already providing<br />
significant assistance to people seeking a<br />
home. We are currently subsidizing the<br />
interest payable for more than fifty years<br />
on some œ 50,000,000 per annum of loan<br />
money available to the States for home<br />
building under the Commonwealth and<br />
State Housing Agreement. The Commonwcalth<br />
is also building a large number of<br />
homes in the Australian Capital Territory </p>
<p>and the Northern Territory. These are<br />
usually offered to tenants at less than an<br />
economic rental, or for sale on a deposit<br />
as low as 5 per cent. of the total purchase<br />
price with the assistance of a long-term<br />
loan from the Commonwealth at a relatively<br />
favorable rate of interest. If purchasers of<br />
these homes were to receive the grant, we<br />
would, in effect, be paying them a double<br />
subsidy. We do not believe that most<br />
Australians would wish us to do this.<br />
A home built by a State housing authority<br />
and paid for with money made available<br />
under the Commonwealth and State Housing<br />
Agreement will not be eligible for the grant,<br />
where it is sold by a State housing authority,<br />
or is being purchased with the assistance<br />
of a loan by a State or State authority<br />
out of moneys made available under the<br />
Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement.<br />
We consider that subsidized homes<br />
built by the States with funds provided<br />
uinder the Commonwealth and State Housing<br />
Agreement ought to be reserved for those<br />
with very small means and on low incomes.<br />
This housing is made available at below<br />
its true economic cost for social reasons.<br />
In some States there are long waiting lists<br />
for these housing commission houses largely<br />
because they are relatively so cheap. It<br />
would be wrong to inflate these lists and<br />
disadvantage the most needy elements of<br />
the community by adding those who can<br />
better afford to look after themselves. The<br />
homes savings grant scheme is designed<br />
to help those who help themselves by saving<br />
appreciable sums. Likewise, a home built<br />
by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth<br />
authority in one of the Territories will be<br />
ineligible when it is first sold or when its<br />
purchase is being financed by a loan by<br />
the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth<br />
authority. However, the many homes being<br />
built by young people in Canberra with<br />
the assistance of a loan of Commonwealth<br />
moneys from the Commissioner for Housing<br />
will be eligible for the grant.<br />
Houses built through co-operative societies<br />
which receive moneys under Commonwealth<br />
and State Housing Agreement in<br />
the States or direct from the Commonwealth<br />
in Canberra or the Northern Territory will<br />
be eligible. It will be realized that these<br />
homes bear the cost of administrative<br />
charges imposed by the States and borne<br />
by the societies and involve a substantial<br />
deposit which the owner has to find. Homes acquired with the assistance of War<br />
Service Homes loans will be eligible even<br />
though these loans are offered on exceptionally<br />
favourable terms and conditions.<br />
The reason for this decision-I am sure<br />
it is one with which all honorable members<br />
will agree-is that Commonwealth financial<br />
assistance to ex-servicemen in home ownership<br />
is a repatriation benefit in the nature<br />
of a post hoc payment for services rendered<br />
to the nation.<br />
Mr. Cope.-How many ex-servicemer",<br />
are under 36 years of age? About two; J.<br />
I would think.<br />
Mr. BURY.-The honorable member<br />
would be surprised. Apparently honorable<br />
members opposite think that Australian<br />
servicemen have not been in action since<br />
1945. A War Service Home loan is not<br />
a social welfare payment and should not<br />
debar its recipient from social welfare<br />
benefits available to young persons throughout<br />
the community.<br />
The homes savings grant is aimed at<br />
assisting those who need and merit financial<br />
aid in acquiring a home. Those acquiring<br />
expensive homes stand in less need of<br />
assistance from the taxpayer whose interests<br />
must also be weighed. For this reason<br />
a home which, together with the land, costs<br />
more than œ 7,000, will be ineligible for<br />
the grant. It is intended that the scheme<br />
should apply equally to homes in rural<br />
and urban areas. If the œ 7,000 limit were<br />
to ipply to the cost of the whole of the<br />
land and all improvements, many people<br />
living on rural holdings would be ineligible<br />
for the grant, because the value of their<br />
land-their main business asset-would<br />
usually exceed œ 7,000. We will therefore<br />
take into account for purposes of the œ 7,000<br />
limit only the cost of the home and of the<br />
land immediately appropriate to the home.<br />
For purposes of the scheme, the cost of<br />
that portion of the farm on which the<br />
dwelling has been, or is being, built will<br />
be the value of half an acre of the land<br />
at the average value per acre of the farm.<br />
There are also other cases where, if we<br />
were to take as the cost of the land and<br />
the house the value of the land and all<br />
improvements on it, such as a shop or a<br />
surgery, the couple owning the land would<br />
be ineligible for the grant. Where the<br />
overall cost of the land and all the building </p>
<p>improvements will exceed œ 7,000, it is proposed<br />
that my department be given a discretionary<br />
power to identify the home<br />
and to have regard only to its assessed<br />
value in applying the œ 7,000 limit.<br />
As honorable members would expect,' a<br />
great deal of thought has been given to<br />
determining the acceptable forms of savings,<br />
bearing in mind the purposes of the scheme.<br />
The forms chosen are in aggregate those<br />
in which the great bulk of personal savings<br />
ra home is accumulated. Moreover,<br />
he institutions chosen are those which<br />
provide a very large proportion of the<br />
finance for private home building. The<br />
reasons for this will be clear from my<br />
opening remarks.<br />
D The acceptable forms of savings for the<br />
purposes of the scheme are-<br />
Moneys deposited in a home savings<br />
account with a savings bank. These<br />
will include moneys placed on fixed<br />
deposit and moneys invested in deposit<br />
stock issued by some savings banks,<br />
provided the account is designated a<br />
home savings account. An eligible<br />
person may have home savings<br />
accounts with more than one bank;<br />
Oma ot rnaedyisn g plbaacnekd, oprno vfidixeedd sduecpho sdiet powsiitths<br />
are designated a home savings account.<br />
Mr. Reynolds.-Will that hove to operate<br />
for three years?<br />
Mr. BURY.-If you will be patient you<br />
will see the picture as it emerges.<br />
SMr. Webb.-It is a bit difficult.<br />
Mr. BURY.-I know it is, for you.<br />
Other acceptable forms of savings for the<br />
purposes of the scheme are-<br />
Moneys deposited with a building or cooperative<br />
housing society registered<br />
uinder a law of a State or Territory.<br />
Moneys paid to a building or co-operative<br />
housing society as subscriptions towards<br />
the purchase of shares in such a<br />
society, provided the shares are not<br />
quoted on any stock exchange.<br />
Moneys paid for the purchase or lease<br />
of land on which the eligible home<br />
is being. or is to be. built.<br />
I wish -to stress that on and after I st<br />
January, 1965, these will be the only<br />
acceptable forms of new-let me repeat, new-savings for purposes of the grant<br />
scheme. However, in view of the fact<br />
that most existing savings were made<br />
without fore-knowledge of the new scheme,<br />
special provisions will apply to savings<br />
made up till the end of this year, and also<br />
for savings made in certain institutions not<br />
eligible in the long run to be kept in their<br />
present form up till the end of 1967.<br />
Because many young people have been, and<br />
are, depositing savings for a. home in a<br />
variety of other forms, my department, if<br />
satisfied that these people have been saving<br />
to acquire a home, will for a period regard<br />
these savings as acceptable. Accordingly<br />
the bill proposes that, up to the 31st<br />
December, 1967, moneys deposited in the<br />
following ways on or before 31st December,<br />
1964, will also be treated as acceptable<br />
savings. They are-<br />
Moneys deposited in any savings bank<br />
account, not being a home savings<br />
account.<br />
Moneys deposited in a current account<br />
or on fixed deposit with a trading<br />
bank.<br />
Moneys deposited with a friendly society<br />
or credit union registered or incorporated<br />
under a law of a State or a<br />
Territory.<br />
However, savings in these forms up to<br />
31st December next, to remain acceptable<br />
after that date, must either be maintained<br />
in -the form in which they are held at<br />
the end of this year or be transferred to<br />
one or more of the forms in which acceptable<br />
new savings must be made from 1st<br />
January next.<br />
Mr. Cope-That will be easy to explain<br />
to my constituents.<br />
Mr. BURY.-Yes, it will. It is surprising<br />
how bright some of them are. After all,<br />
the people to benefit will not be more than<br />
36 years of age.<br />
Mr. Hansen.-What about savings in<br />
Commonwealth bonds?<br />
Mr. BURY-This will include savings in<br />
any form, as I mentioned. It will include<br />
savings in Commonwealth bonds. This<br />
means that any moneys saved and deposited<br />
in any bank account up to the end of this<br />
year will be acceptable up to 31st December,<br />
1967, if they are maintained in their<br />
present form and after 31st December, </p>
<p>1967, if before that date they are transferred<br />
into one of the acceptable forms<br />
ot new saving. The same conditions will<br />
apply to savings deposited with a friendly<br />
society or credit union. They may be left<br />
with the society or union and be -acceptable<br />
up to 3 1st December, 1967.<br />
I have had a number of discussions with<br />
representatives of friendly societies and<br />
credit unions, some of whom have expressed<br />
their interest in registering associated building<br />
or housing societies in conjunction with<br />
their other activities. Many of them have<br />
funds now applied for a variety of purposes<br />
not connected with housing. There is no<br />
time limit on the acceptability of savings<br />
placed with any registered building society.<br />
The above provision will give friendly<br />
societies and credit unions ample time to<br />
adjust their affairs to fit in with the new<br />
scheme without disturbing their existing<br />
resources. Credit unions are growing fast<br />
and play a very constructive part in collecting<br />
and channelling savings to fruitful<br />
purposes for the benefit of their members<br />
and in fostering a sense of financial<br />
responsibility. The further harnessing of<br />
their activities to the housing field would<br />
be a most welcome development.<br />
It is desirable at this stage to make it<br />
quite clear that the bill now before the<br />
House, which defines savings deposited with<br />
building and co-operative housing societies,<br />
friendly societies and credit unions as<br />
acceptable savings, is in no way intended<br />
to imply that the Commonwealth is, or will<br />
be, responsible for the financial soundness<br />
and solvency of iany of these institutions.<br />
Because until now there has been no<br />
definitive statement of acceptable forms of<br />
saving, we are also proposing that money<br />
saved and accumulated in any form for<br />
home purchase uip to the end of this year<br />
will be acceptable, provided the savings are<br />
deposited or invested before then in any of<br />
the approved forms of saving. Home<br />
savings accounts will not be blocked accounts<br />
in the sense that the owner of the account<br />
may not withdraw money for any purpose.<br />
However, a withdrawal will in most cases<br />
reduce the amount of acceptable savings.<br />
Obviously, any moneys borrowed-not<br />
saved-will not be treated as acceptable<br />
savings. We have considered at length when the<br />
period of acceptable savings of an eligible<br />
person should cease. The scheme is aimed at encouraging personal saving by young<br />
people before they enter into a commitment<br />
to acquire their own home. The bill therefore<br />
proposes that the period of saving will<br />
conclude on the day one or both of the<br />
married couple, or a person intending to<br />
marry, signs a contract to buy the home,<br />
or signs a contract to build the home, provided<br />
this is not later than the day construction<br />
commences, or, in the case of an<br />
owner-builder, the day on which construction<br />
commences. As soon as the contracthas<br />
been entered into or construction of'<br />
the home commenced, the period of acceptable<br />
savings concludes for both the husband<br />
and wife, and for both partners of an<br />
intended marriage. This significant date is<br />
described in the bill as the " prescribeddate<br />
As the grant is intended to be a reward<br />
for continuous saving over a period of<br />
years, not for the deposit of a single lump<br />
sum and no further saving, there should<br />
obviously be a limit on the amount of<br />
acceptable saving in a year. To give effect<br />
to this, it is necessary to define years of<br />
saving. The years of saving of an eligible<br />
person will be the twelve months' periods<br />
dating back from the day on which the<br />
period of acceptable savings concluded.<br />
May I make this clear by quoting a<br />
hypothetical example. Suppose Mr. Smith<br />
signed a contract to buy or build, or commenced<br />
the construction of his home on<br />
20th February, 1964. The years of saving<br />
of Mr. and Mrs. Smith would be 21st<br />
February, 1963, to 20th February, 1964;<br />
21st February, 1962. to 20th February.<br />
1963; 21st February, 1961. to 20th February,<br />
1962; and so on into the past; but<br />
information will not be sought beyond seven<br />
years. In respect of savings periods that<br />
conclude after 31st December next, the<br />
savings of each eligible person in any year<br />
of saving will be acceptable uip to œ 250.<br />
1 now wish to explain briefly the manner<br />
in which we propose to calculate acceptable<br />
savings, as it is set out in the bill. The<br />
amount of acceptable savings of an eligible<br />
person during any year of saving will be the<br />
amount by which his or her total savings<br />
at the end of the year exceeded savings at<br />
the beginning of the year. Total savings<br />
will include, in addition to balances held<br />
in an acceptable form with a bank, building<br />
society, friendly society and credit union,<br />
the amount of any payment or payments </p>
<p>made to purchase the land on which the<br />
home is being, or is to be built. If, however,<br />
the total of an eligible person's acceptable<br />
savings at the end of the year is less<br />
than the total at the beginning of the year,<br />
the acceptable savings at the beginning of<br />
the year will be reduced hy the amount of<br />
the decrease during the year.<br />
If a person, whose savings period concludes<br />
after 31st December next, saves more<br />
than œ 250 in a year, the excess will not be<br />
7aicsc espatvabinlge, s ienx caenpyt tyheaatr, iffo llao wpeinrsgo na ryeedaur ceisn<br />
-which he had excess savings, the amount of<br />
the reduction will be treated first as a<br />
withdrawal of excess savings and only if<br />
the reduction in savings exceeds the amount<br />
of excess savings will the total acceptable<br />
7savings in earlier years -be reduced.<br />
As the grant is a reward for saving to<br />
acquire a home, we must be reasonably sure<br />
that the young people will obtain the home<br />
and will live in it. It is proposed to pay<br />
the grant as soon as my department is<br />
satisfied that the home will be bought or<br />
built and lived in by the married couple.<br />
We appreciate that there will be many<br />
young people who will wish to know in<br />
advance of entering into a commitment<br />
to acquire a home whether they are<br />
eligible for the grant and, if so, the<br />
Qapproximate amount of the grant they may<br />
expect to receive. It is my intention to<br />
arrange Australia-wide distributiion of a<br />
pamphlet that will answer most questions<br />
on who is eligible, what homes are eligible,<br />
,--&gt; what are acceptable savings and tiow the<br />
grant will be calculated, and give advice on how to complete the application form.<br />
Officers of my department will also be<br />
instructed to supply the maximum feasible<br />
amount of information in response to enquiries.<br />
However, as honorable members<br />
will understand, it will be impracticable<br />
to determine the amount of acceptable<br />
savings and of the grant payable to an<br />
eligible person in advance of entry into<br />
a contract to buy or build the home or<br />
the commencement of its construction.<br />
Offices are being established in each capital<br />
city under the charge of regional directors.<br />
I wish to add that it is my intention<br />
that the scheme be administered as sympathetically<br />
as the bill permits. I do not<br />
pretend that, in the time we have had to<br />
examine the ramifications of the -scheme, we<br />
may not have overlooked some minor<br />
aspects. Partly to cover the unforeseen<br />
but also to permit the sympathetic treatment<br />
of unusual cases, the bill, as already<br />
mentioned, has been drafted to give substantial<br />
discretionary powers to the secretary<br />
of my department and his delegates<br />
in administering the scheme. I am quite<br />
satisfied that these discretionary powers,<br />
similar in most respects to those of the<br />
director-general and his delegates under the<br />
Social Services Act, are necessary to permit<br />
the smooth and effective introduction of<br />
the scheme. I believe this bill will encourage<br />
young people to save and so make<br />
a useful contribution to assisting young<br />
married persons to acquire a home of their<br />
own. Accordingly, I commend it to the<br />
House. Debate ( on motion by Mr. Whitlam)<br />
adjourned.<br />
