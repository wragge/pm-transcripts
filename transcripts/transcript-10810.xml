<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the good news today is that there's</p>
<p>   been a further 20-odd thousand jobs generated in Australia. Since</p>
<p>   the Government came to office we've presided over the creation</p>
<p>   of 293 000 additional jobs in Australia and that shows that there</p>
<p>   is a very strong response in the Australian economy to the economic</p>
<p>   measures that we've taken. Despite the downturn in Asia there</p>
<p>   is still great resilience and vigour in the labour market in Australia</p>
<p>   and a further 20-odd thousand jobs created last month is very good</p>
<p>   news indeed. Now, I'd be very happy to answer any questions.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Kennett has signalled that he might be interested in federal</p>
<p>   politics. What's your response?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'd welcome him. That is a matter for him. I think Jeff</p>
<p>   Kennett has been a very fine Premier of Victoria. I respect a lot</p>
<p>   the work that he has done. If he were to decide at some stage in</p>
<p>   the near, medium, or distant future to go into federal politics,</p>
<p>   well, I certainly wouldn't discourage him, but that is a matter</p>
<p>   for him.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is he the kind of person that you'd consider putting in a</p>
<p>   senior position on the front bench?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, let's wait until he arrives Fleur.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you concerned Prime Minister about the problems that Mr Kroger</p>
<p>   is having with Jeff Kennett?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I'm not, I have no comment to make on organisational</p>
<p>   matters.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is it up to people like Michael Kroger to be advising politicians</p>
<p>   where they should go, for career advice?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister how confident are you that you'll get the Telstra</p>
<p>   package through the Senate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it is a matter for the independents. I'm confident that</p>
<p>   the Government Senators will see the wisdom of supporting it. I</p>
<p>   never count my chickens before they are hatched when it comes to</p>
<p>   the Senate because the Government has never had the numbers to control</p>
<p>   the Senate. It is always difficult to get anything that is mildly</p>
<p>   different or mildly new through the Senate. That's one of the</p>
<p>   problems that the Government has had. We have this huge majority</p>
<p>   in the House of Representatives, but we've never had control</p>
<p>   of the Senate. I will just keep working away, I will keep talking</p>
<p>   to people and I am hopeful, because if we can get it through it</p>
<p>   will be terrific news for people all around Australia. I mean it</p>
<p>   is in the interests of Australia that we do get this privatisation</p>
<p>   through because out of the proceeds of the privatisation we'll</p>
<p>   be able to do things that we wouldn't otherwise be able to</p>
<p>   do. It will massively reduce Australia's debt. I mean, if we</p>
<p>   can get Telstra fully privatised, we will get the debt monkey off</p>
<p>   the younger generation in the 21st Century. That's the benefit</p>
<p>   for Australia, getting the debt monkey off the back of the younger</p>
<p>   generation of Australia as we go into the 21st Century.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Senator Colston and Senator Harradine are both on the record now</p>
<p>   as saying they oppose the full privatisation. How do you rate your</p>
<p>   chances then of getting it through the Senate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I never give running commentaries. I always let the comments of</p>
<p>   others go by and wait the final vote.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you still committed to the full privatisation after you've</p>
<p>   talked with the National Party?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, more money for improved mobile services in the bush.</p>
<p>   Will that be enough to win the rural vote and ensure that the National</p>
<p>   Party heartland will back the plan?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the announcement that Tim Fischer made this morning is the</p>
<p>   breakthrough on analogue phones in the bush that everybody has been</p>
<p>   wanting and I congratulate Telstra on the decision that's been</p>
<p>   taken. Tim has explained the details and I'll leave that to</p>
<p>   him, but it is, as I understand it, the breakthrough that people</p>
<p>   have been wanting.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can we have a comment on the publication on the names and addresses</p>
<p>   of One Nation members today?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It was probably a counter-productive thing to have done. I understand</p>
<p>   and respect the Jewish community's feelings on a lot of matters.</p>
<p>   I don't think there's anybody in Australian politics who</p>
<p>   holds the Jewish community in Australia in higher esteem but it</p>
<p>   was probably a counter-productive decision and I think that's</p>
<p>   probably now acknowledged.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is that indicative of the way the federal election will go do you</p>
<p>   think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Christopher Skase...(inaudible).. should he now return home to</p>
<p>   face the music?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think everybody would like that to happen. I think the</p>
<p>   most sensible thing for anybody who's got any sort of public</p>
<p>   position on this matter is to be careful what they say in case any</p>
<p>   prejudice is done to legal proceedings in Spain. It is easy for</p>
<p>   people to make clever remarks at the moment over Christopher Skase.</p>
<p>   We all want him back in Australia. We all want him to face justice,</p>
<p>   but it is incumbent upon me, on members of my Government and on</p>
<p>   members of the Opposition not to score political points. Political</p>
<p>   point-scoring in the past has damaged the prospects of getting him</p>
<p>   home and I don't want to see that happen again. I'm pleased</p>
<p>   that a step has been taken that brings him closer to justice. I</p>
<p>   don't want to prejudice what might happen in the future by</p>
<p>   saying anything else. And I don't think anybody else should</p>
<p>   either, be they in politics or in the media or anywhere else. If</p>
<p>   you want him home, you'll understand the legal sensitivities</p>
<p>   of these sorts of proceedings and these situations and all of us</p>
<p>   should act with a sense of responsibility. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
