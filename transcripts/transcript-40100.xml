    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER TURNBULL:</strong></p>
<p>We are here – the New Zealand Prime Minister and the Australian Prime Minister and our wives – and we are here offering the people of France, the people of Paris, our most heartfelt condolences and our unflinching solidarity in the face of this terrorism.</p>
<p>We are all together. We are with France. We are with the people of Paris. We are with all people committed to freedom in this battle against terrorism, against violence, against violent extremism.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER KEY:</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand and Australia are two countries that are almost the furthest away from France.</p>
<p>But at a time of such sadness and heartache for the people of France, we have never been closer together.</p>
<p>We come at this time to pay our respects to those that lost their lives to their families and to show support and solidarity for the people of France.</p>
<p>The city of Paris has gone through a great deal with the terrible issues earlier in the year with Charlie Hebdo and now with the latest terrorist attacks, but in the end the spirit of the French people will rise up above the terrible actions of ISIL and the forces that they believe in and France will be strong again.</p>
