TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISrER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, MELBOURNE, 23 JUNE 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, what are the details of the youth summit?<br />
PM: We've given you the date and it will be a private meeting, one where we are<br />
trying to I think, do something material and substantial about youth<br />
unemployment and provide opportunities for young people. A large part of<br />
the initiatives in these respects have been led by my colleague Kim Beazley<br />
who has had the responsibility of picking up the Carmichael Report on<br />
training and entry level wages and all of those very complex issues, and<br />
putting together a discussion with business and with community groups and<br />
with young people to see what we can do in terms of a permanent change to<br />
the employment of young people in Australia. Can I say that I think the<br />
meeting can be a very useful one and Kim's leadership on the issue has been<br />
quite profound.<br />
J: Prime Minister, many of the people going to the job summit will be going to<br />
the Opposition's jobs forum three weeks before, have you been pre-empted?<br />
PM: It will be all there, all shadow and no substance. There is nothing in the<br />
Fightba k proposals. This was originally going to be a jamboree for<br />
Fightback. There is nothing in the Fightback proposals which would give<br />
anyone either money or confidence about labour market programs or training.<br />
In fact the great training initiatives the Government had in ' One Nation' for a<br />
new national TAFE system are not even comprehended under Dr Hewson's<br />
GST Fightback proposal. Now they were supposed to have a fair, a jamboree<br />
where they were to sell the consumption tax. They now realise that the going </p>
<p>2<br />
on that is going to be very tough so now they're going to try and move into the<br />
youth unemployment issue an issue which they have to date shown not the<br />
slightest interest. The difference between that and what we're proposing is<br />
this is real. This is about a real change in the way the labour market works<br />
and about trying to take young people up in employment and to give them<br />
training so that they can find jobs in the economy, particularly as the economy<br />
recovers which do have those skills which they just won't be able to get<br />
without them.<br />
J: Will young jobless people be invited?<br />
PM: They will be represented by the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition<br />
which is the premier group representing young people.<br />
J: So they won't be there?<br />
PM: They will be there yes.<br />
J: How many unemployed people are you going to have?<br />
PM: That group which will have its own consultations over the next couple of<br />
weeks prior to the summit and will have some young people also included in<br />
their own delegation.<br />
J: How many full-time jobs do you think the Carmichael Report can actually<br />
achieve?<br />
PM: The Carmichael Report is a report about the long-term and the long-termi is<br />
portending a change for access to young people and the opportunities for them<br />
to get on-the-job training and to be employed on an affordable basis for onthe-<br />
job-training and to moving into the economy then with some skills. Now<br />
this has not been the case in the past so it's a very long run policy.<br />
J: How many sustainable jobs?<br />
PM: I will see what we can do, but we'll have substantial businesses represented. It<br />
will be many thousands.<br />
J: Kim Beazlcy seems to think that young jobless people aren't needed at the<br />
summit.<br />
PM: No, you asked Kim about organisational arrangements, some of you, for the<br />
summit and you should have asked me because I'm the one putting the<br />
arrangements together. Kim's role has been the policy role. Kim has, as you<br />
know, come from an educational background to public life and he regards the<br />
Carmichael Report and its implementation as being a path breaking and an </p>
<p>important area of policy and to date he has done very well in getting, in a<br />
practical way, the debate to this stage and we're all going to try and move it<br />
along a bit further.<br />
J: Were Premiers Kirner and Bannon grandstanding if they say the 50,000 jobs<br />
in the TCF could go in the next five years?<br />
PM: I'm not sure.<br />
J: Prime Minister, on South Africa, Arch Bishop Tutu today called for the<br />
reimposition of s qn~ cions. Does Australia support that call?<br />
PM: I haven't seen what Arch Bishop Tutu has said. We can only hope that the<br />
CODESA process continues, that the parties there can see their way clear to<br />
resolve the current problems and get back to the discussions for a democratic<br />
South Africa.<br />
J: Do you believe the All Blacks should continue with their tour?<br />
PM: Look, we have lifted sporting sanctions and I'm not going to pre-empt or prejudge<br />
the situation at this distance. We'll see what the future holds and there<br />
are still some other sanctions which are applying and they will continue to<br />
apply.<br />
J: Do we need another cut in interest rates to help employment.<br />
PM: Again, I'm not going to give forecasts about interest rates at doorstops.<br />
J: Prime Minister, are you at all inclined to link the ' One Nation' statement with<br />
tariff changes in the way that Premiers Bannon and Kirner suggested on<br />
Sunday?<br />
PM: You always ask the hard questions. You always come at us about<br />
employment and the gloomy aspects of economic life and because I know you<br />
are a supporter of the Liberal Party. But the fact of the matter is..<br />
J: That's an absurd proposition.<br />
PM: It's not absurd, you are a supporter of the Liberal Party. The fact is that the<br />
Government has over the 1980s sought to make Australia a newer country, a<br />
country which can trade its way in the world and where jobs are real and<br />
sustainable. And that's what is happening in Australia now. There has been a<br />
great fundamental transition to exports, the country is exporting its head off, it<br />
has been since the 1980s and it's still doing it. What we need is more growth<br />
because as people are displaced, and they have been displaced as the </p>
<p>4<br />
efficiencies of certain companies and industries have changed, we need to take<br />
them up with higher levels of aggregate growth and aggregate employment.<br />
J: What about the tariff changes suggested by the Premiers?<br />
PM: Like everything else, they will be considered.<br />
J: Prime Minister, why if Kim Beazley as Employment Minister, why wasn't he<br />
let known that you were going to have youth unemployed?<br />
PM: There is a process, and the process is that the arrangements were being settled<br />
and have been settled over the last couple of days. The summit has been<br />
organised by me and my Department and not by Mr Beazley and his.<br />
J: Why didn't you notify him?<br />
PM: Don't concentrate on the negative. It's always a problem with you people,<br />
we're about to make a break through on youth unemployment and some of you<br />
just harp on pointless negatives.<br />
