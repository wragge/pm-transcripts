PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 8 APRIL 1979<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S COMMENTS TO PRESS IN PERTH<br />
( TRUCK DRIVERS DISPUTE)<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Neville Wran's been up on Razorback apparently most of the day,<br />
or a fair bit of it. He's not said what's come out of that and at<br />
the moment the truckies aren't saying so either. But the<br />
information I have from Peter Nixon is that they put what was<br />
basically decided on Saturday but which the State Ministers<br />
didn't put out in terms of a statement. In other words, if<br />
they go back to work the road maintenance charge would come off.<br />
The States would look to see what alternative charges could<br />
be put on and that might be a uniform license fee or a uniform<br />
registration fee or might even be some sort of petrol<br />
franchise charge, as it was reported to me. Now, if we can<br />
help in the States coming to agreement on any of those aspects<br />
of course we will, but these are matters that are in the State areas<br />
of responsibility and if they can come to agreement as I am<br />
advised they could now or could have over a long period worked<br />
out some sort of uniform charge so long as it was related to the<br />
wear and tear on roads caused by interstate transport. The other<br />
aspect which we are willing to look at is the extent to which<br />
restrictive trade practices legislation might prevent the<br />
truck drivers getting a reasonable charging structure and that's<br />
related to some of the other problems in the industry as<br />
you know the ease sometimes, with which finance canbe<br />
available; somebody gets into trouble and to stay alive they<br />
just cut rates further and that compounds the problems for the<br />
whole industry. State railway charges are also very much related<br />
to that because that establishes a competitive position between<br />
railways and interstate transport. I think that is basically<br />
where the matter lies at the moment.<br />
Question: Sir Charles has said that the position as far as the Eastern<br />
States has got is out of control, that there is two ( inaudible);<br />
a taxing problem and physical problem of the trucks blocking<br />
the road and they should be treated separately. He says as far<br />
as the Eastern States go the States should ask the Commonwealth<br />
to use whatever physical resources they have available to clear<br />
the roads. If you had any approach either individually or<br />
collectively from the State Premiers, what would be your<br />
position? Prime Minister:<br />
The States, neither individually or collectively have asked us<br />
to do anything in that vein. The only request they had put to<br />
us, earlier of course, was to pick up their loss of the<br />
road maintenance tax and we said we are not going to do that<br />
through an increased fuel tax which would be an increased charge<br />
on every petrol user. We've got no intention of doing it / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
Prime Minister: ( continued)<br />
and that has been made perfectly plain, because this is in an<br />
area of State responsibility, they could have and have known<br />
of the problems coming up for a long time and they have also<br />
known that there are alternatives open to them. They shouldn't<br />
have got themselves in this position. The physical problem<br />
of the trucks is worst in N. S. W. and that was handled worst<br />
by the N. S. W. Premier, who instead of getting his police to<br />
move trucks on as they started to pull up and they all have<br />
plenty of powers under their normal processes of doing that<br />
because the trucks were obstructing traffic spent the time<br />
instead passing legislation which he is not prepared to use,<br />
as I am advised. If there was a request from the States to the<br />
Comnionwealth, that is obviously something that we would consider<br />
very seriously but it would need to be a request from the States.<br />
It is in fact something that I discussed with Sir Charles earlier<br />
this afternoon. But he said that he had no problem because<br />
the Western Australian police have in fact been moving trucks<br />
on and making sure that they don't obstruct traffic.<br />
Question: Sir Charles blames Mr. Nixon very heavily for having told the<br />
States to take off the road maintenance tax without any<br />
suggestion of an alternative.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
That's been said on a number of occasions, but really it was the<br />
Premier of Queensland who spelt the end of the road maintenance tax<br />
because once he made the decision he did which is entirely<br />
his independent Queensland decision I think it meant the end of the<br />
road maintenance tax. I've made it perfectly plain that the<br />
Commonwealth doesn't want to be a party to negotiating under<br />
pressure. Mr. Nixon has said he will not speak with the truckies<br />
until they are back at normal work and that is the position as<br />
it will be. If truck drivers at Razorback are staying out<br />
because they believe the Commonwealth will pick up some bills<br />
for the States, I think by now they would be totally<br />
disabused because we are not going to. Whether it is truck drivers<br />
or whether it is some other union, we are totally opposed to<br />
negotiating under pressure and I regret that the States put<br />
themselVes in the position of appearing to concede under pressure;<br />
and that is irrespective of the merits of a particular case.<br />
It's always possible to hear a case if it is in the normal<br />
industrial processes through arbitration and you don't need<br />
industrial pressure to strengthen the logic of it. In this<br />
particular instance, the matters can be argued without disrupting<br />
tens of thousands of other people and families and businesses<br />
and causing harm to the public. Let me just make it plain, the<br />
Commonwealth or Mr. Nixon for the Commonwealth will not be<br />
speaking to the truck drivers until this is over and I regret<br />
that there is the appearance of the States making concessions<br />
to this particular industry under threat. It's worth noting<br />
that once the States went down that particular path the truck<br />
drivers expanded their demands very considerably into the<br />
abolition of sales tax on tyres and matters of that kind. Those<br />
matters are not open for negotiation at all. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
Question: Just on the question of physical resources to move the<br />
trucks. One would presume that would include the Army.<br />
Have you considered that as an option, among the<br />
resources you would have to...<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Let me only say that the Commonwealth has over the last couple<br />
of days, been looking to see what it could do if there was a<br />
request to clear the highways by the States. I think it is<br />
natural enough that we would examine our own resources in<br />
relation to that.<br />
Question:<br />
Do you have a contingency plan, sir?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Not at this point. We are examining our own resources.<br />
Question:<br />
Are you happy that you have the resources at the moment?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
There will be a report waiting for me when I get back to<br />
Melbourne or first thing tomorrow morning.<br />
