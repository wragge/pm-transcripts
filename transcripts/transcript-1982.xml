VISIT TO THE U. K. 1969<br />
PRESS STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. JOHN GORTON, IN LONDON AFTER THE<br />
FIVE-POWIER DEFENCE MEETING 17 JANUARY 1969<br />
The Prime Ministers of Malaysia ( Tunku Abdul Rahman),<br />
Singapore ( Mr. Lee Kuan Yew), New Zealand ( Mr. Keith Holyoake),<br />
and Australia ( Mr. John Gorton) and the British Defence Minister ( Mr.<br />
Denis Healey) held an informal meeting in London this morning. The<br />
Australian Minister for External Affairs ( Mr. Paul Hasluck) also attended.<br />
The Prime Ministers had decided to take this opportunity<br />
of their presence together in London to discuss the time and place for a<br />
Five-Power conference later in the year. Following the meeting, which<br />
was held in the Australian Prime Minister's suite at the Savoy Hotel,<br />
Mr. Gorton announced that it had been decided to hold the second<br />
Five-Power conference in Canberra on 12 May. The first such conference<br />
took place in Kuala Lumpur last June.<br />
Mr. Gorton said that today's meeting was primarily<br />
concerned with the arrangements for the new conference. There was no<br />
substantive discussion of questions arising from Britain's withdrawal<br />
from South East Asia. </p>
