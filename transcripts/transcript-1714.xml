MINISTE3: ( MR HAIRCLD HCLT)<br />
Friday, ICth November, 1c, 7<br />
"' Following is the text of the first of a series of National Broadcasts to<br />
be made by the Prime Minister, Mr Holt, during the Senate campaign.<br />
This talk will be relayed over the ABC's netwo-rk at 7. 15 this evening<br />
This Senate election differs from a general election for<br />
the House of Represenatives. The general election decides who is to<br />
govern A ustralia, and the next general elect ion is not due, in the normal<br />
course, until 1969. Bu* you will be hearing a lot about policy from our<br />
opponents. Years ago, elections were regarded by many people as<br />
a policy auction. The theory was the bigger the promises you made, the<br />
bigger the vote you were likely to get. The Australian electorate of today<br />
is more mature and knowledgeable. But rhe Labor Party has not yet<br />
appreciated this fact. From time to time, 3ince we came into office first<br />
in 1949, the Labor Party has presented you, the electors, with a<br />
fantastic set of promises. In 1966, Mr Calwell made the sky the limit.<br />
But you, the electors, were not duped by this.<br />
You recognised tht even a smsible and practical domestic<br />
programme, directed to national growth and social welfare, lacks reality<br />
unless it is set in the framnework of a foreign policy cementing our security.<br />
We have yet to hear the Labor Party offer us the kind of domestic<br />
programme that could be carried out without the prospect of serious<br />
inflation, without oppressive taxation and without discouraging private<br />
enterprise and private enterprise still provides three out of every four<br />
jobs in Australia. And what about national security? Here the ALP is bogged<br />
down under prejudice and isolationism. It shows no reality about<br />
Australia's position in a dangerous world.<br />
We of the Government have put first things first.<br />
We believe we have correctly analysed where the threats to our security<br />
lie. We have made friendships and treaties with countries and people<br />
who also recognise these threats.<br />
But we have not neglected either national growth or<br />
social welfare. We have helped build this country to its present stability<br />
and strength. There are many outside Australia who envy us. The<br />
progress of our economy has been steady and sure. We enjoy one of the<br />
highest standards of living in the world, and there is virtually no limit<br />
to our potential if we go about this in the right way.<br />
Since the elections of last year, we have been giving<br />
speedy effect to our policy undertakings. We have, in fact, been doing<br />
a great deal more than that in the area of national development. This<br />
makes impressive reading: Legislation to cover the discovery of offshore<br />
oil and gas, the provision of an additional $ 50 million for beef<br />
roads in Northern Australia, great water projects on the Ord River / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
in Western Australia and the Nogoa Dam in Queensland.<br />
I mention these here to emphasise that we regard policymaking<br />
as a continuing process not limited to what is said at election<br />
times. In opening the present campaign, I Illustrated our forward<br />
thinking on education and national health. We look to the future, we<br />
move steadily towards cur social objectives but our planning Is always<br />
based on what we, and you as taxpayers, can reasonably affcrd and what<br />
the national economy can accommodate.<br />
We are following the course we charted a year ago. We<br />
do not believe you want us to deviate from it.<br />
Candidates for the Senate who believe that the role of that<br />
chamber is to take the business of the country out of the hands of a<br />
government you have elected, carry vanity to the point of arrogance<br />
and absurdity. When the fsenate has the numbers to defeat the government<br />
of the day on party lines; when It tries to usurp the role of the House of<br />
Representatives, the effectiveness of government must be hampered.<br />
The issues confronting Australia today are large and<br />
critical. Too large and too critical to permit of confusions and<br />
uncertainties from a Senate where the government you have chosen could<br />
be compelled by the vote In this Senate campaign to remain indefinitely in a<br />
minority. </p>
