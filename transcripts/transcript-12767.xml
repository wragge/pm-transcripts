I welcome the announcement today by the NSW Liberal and National Parties that they will take up the Coalition Government';s offer in the 2001 Budget to extend a range of pensioner concessions to self-funded retirees who hold the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC), in partnership with the states and territories.<br />
Since the 2001 Budget, the Commonwealth has been negotiating with the states and territories over the extension of these concessions.<br />
The Commonwealth';s funding offer has, however, been sitting on the desk of the Premier of NSW for 16 months and still the self-funded retirees of NSW are not getting any consideration.<br />
The concessions cover essential services, that is, council, water and sewerage rates, electricity, and motor vehicle registration.  These services are every day items that form a major part of the household budgets of older Australians.<br />
The CSHC provides access to concessional rate pharmaceuticals under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.  Also, from September 2001 a telephone allowance is payable to eligible CSHC holders, currently at $18.60 a quarter for a couple.<br />
The CSHC is issued to people of Age Pension age or above (65 for men, 62 for women) who are not receiving a pension and whose adjusted taxable income is less than $50,000 (single) or $80,000 (couple, combined).  These new limits were announced as part of the Commonwealth';s 2001-02 Budget and took effect from 1 July 2001.</p>
<p>I am pleased that NSW self-funded retirees will, on election of a Coalition Government in NSW, be able to receive additional concessions available to pensioners. </p>
