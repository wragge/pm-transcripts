VISIT TO NEW ZEALAND<br />
AUC.-' KLAND<br />
Speech at Civic Repto J<br />
by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton LIBRJt1--<br />
3C March 1966<br />
Mr. Mayor, The Right Honourable the Prime Ministerp Ladies and<br />
Gentlemen: You will not, I know, either expect or want the to speak<br />
to you for any length of timie6 This is rather an occasion on which 1 say<br />
thank you to the Mayor for having tendered to me this reception and tha nk<br />
you to you people In this room for having been good enough to come alonig<br />
to it. I have not, Mvr. Mayor, as you seem to fear, had to listen<br />
to a lot of long speeches since I have been in this country. On the contrary,<br />
I have had to listen to a number of short speeches which were warm and<br />
touching and welcoming, and if there were long and boring speeches given,<br />
then they were given by me, which is a far better thing to do than to haye<br />
to listen to them being given by somebody else. Indeed, I was quite<br />
surprised because as one travels around my own country, ( and I hope If<br />
there are any of my own pressmen here they won't report this too nastily%,<br />
as one travels around my own country, it is common for, at even the<br />
smallest gathering, for there to be at least four, five, six, seven speeches.<br />
This is why we are known as a nation which has the smallest number of<br />
people to the square mile, and the greatest number of speeches to the<br />
square meal ( applause).<br />
This Is not, in fact, the first time either that I have been<br />
to Auckdand, though it is the first time, of course, as Prime Minister. Wie<br />
called through before, my wife and I, ou our way back from England to<br />
begin to raise that family of which you spoke. And later I remember calling<br />
in to Auckland on a trooper and picking up part of the Maori battalion who<br />
went with us then across to I. ngland. But those were days of long ago. It<br />
is my mission here and m-y hope here to try and see that those bonds which<br />
began in war are now used in the arts of peace for the real use of the<br />
opportunities the war has presented to us, the opportunities to act as a<br />
free people for the good of free peoples.<br />
Sir, It is kind of you indeed to give this reception to me.<br />
It was kind of you to talk of the. potentialities of my own nation, which are<br />
great, and which if we can overcome the shortage of water, which is the<br />
main shortage, we now have open up for us, and I don't brag and please<br />
don't think I am bragging -open up for us an almost limitless possibility<br />
for the future. But that is speaking of one nation. This is not enough.<br />
There are also possibilities in this nation which are great and If the<br />
possibilities of this nation and of our nation can be wedded and welded<br />
together for the benefit of both of us, then as I have said today at the<br />
showground and previously at Wellington, we will be the stronger for<br />
what you can do, you may be the stronger for what we can do. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
And if it turns out that that is what does happen then all<br />
the peoples round us will be the stronger for what you and we together<br />
do, and this Is what we seek this is what I think the future holds for us.<br />
I don't know how quickly but I can see and I think that you can see and I<br />
think the people of my own country can see in their minds that vision before<br />
them at some stage in the future as something to build for. I am sure you<br />
can do the same. If we don't get there as quickly as we would like, what<br />
of it. just like a man, a nation's reach must exceed its grasp, or what's<br />
the future for. The significant thing is to reach and to reach together as<br />
far as Australia and New Zealand are concerned. And that's what we are<br />
going to do, I believe. Tomorrow w e must leave but I do hope that there<br />
will be an opportunity for me to come back and meet you all again. And<br />
I do hope that when I stop being Prime Mi nister I don't hope that soon<br />
but politics is an uncertain business that whoever is Prime Minister of<br />
Australia for the next iC33 years will come to New Zealand as a matter of<br />
course. And whoever's Primei Minister of New Zealand will come to<br />
Australia as a matter of course. And this too is part of' that joint effort<br />
which I see as something of a destiny for us both.<br />
I thank you, Sir, indeed. I am sorry that I spoke longer<br />
than I meant to speak to you. These are things of some importance to<br />
all of us to both nations and forgive me if I spent too long in talking<br />
about them. Thank you. </p>
