Workerzs Union . said they'd be holding a-quiet demonstration<br />

The battle of Thailand's northern border has developed into a.<br />
war of . words involving the major powers. The Soviet Union has<br />
accused China and the United States of staging the clashes on<br />
the border between Thailand and Kampuchea. China, for its part,<br />
has warned Vietnam of the grave dangers involved if it persists<br />
in what China called military adventures. The United States has<br />
condemned the Vietnamese military incursion into Thailand and<br />
the UN Secretary General, Mr. Waldheim has expressed great concern<br />
and appealed to all parties concerned to restore peace in the area.<br />
Tass said the border fighting erupted when Kampuchean units<br />
repelled an attempt by ' counter revolutionary scum' to cross the<br />
border from Thailand. Tass said the United States and China had<br />
staged the clashes to try to influence Southeast Asian states not<br />
to recognise the new regime in Kampuchea. China warned Vietnam<br />
of the grave risks involved and also promised resolute support<br />
to the Thai Government in its struggle against aggression. The<br />
statement however did not threaten immediate military action<br />
against Vietnam.<br />
