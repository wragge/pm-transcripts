PIRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OP THE ] PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, MELBOURNE, 17 MARCH 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Well there have been plenty of reasons i~ n the last 12<br />
months why people could have been pessimistic and<br />
entitled to be pessimistic and gloomy about the economy.<br />
But that's not true today, not true of these numbers in<br />
the National Accounts. We are entitled to be confident<br />
that the economty is on the turn, that there's hope<br />
there, and that' every person who is interested in a<br />
recovery should. welcome the numbers today.<br />
J: Is 0.3 enough?<br />
PM: The fact is that it's turning and it's positive and It's<br />
coming off the previous couple of quarters so it looks<br />
as though there is every reason, as I say, to be<br />
confident and to be. hopeful about the economy.<br />
J: Dr Hewson says that there aren't improvements in the<br />
areas that count such as business investment.<br />
PM: Anyone who doesn't welcome these numbers today,<br />
including Dr Hewson' is not saying things which will<br />
welcome or induce a recovery.<br />
J: Is it possible that' we could Blip back into a negative<br />
situation?<br />
PM: I think the trend ovrer the period and the fact now that<br />
interest rates have, been down low for a very long period<br />
of time will help and, as well as that, now, of course,<br />
we've got the added' chemistry of the One Nation<br />
Statement. These changes reflect the December quarter.<br />
We believed when we brought One Nation down that we were<br />
going to add to the impetus coming out of the December<br />
quarter and spur growth in the economy over the course<br />
of the year. I think now the chemistry of the One<br />
Nation Statement will have that effect. it will take<br />
that momentum and push it on and have its own impact on<br />
the economy. People should remember that while One<br />
Nation was presented a few weeks ago, and in terms of<br />
the newspapers has gone into the history of the writing<br />
of it, its impact is yet to be felt, and will be felt </p>
<p>-2-<br />
through the course of this year and, in particular, in<br />
the next half year.<br />
J: Business inves~ tment is still poor, when are we going to<br />
see atn improvement there in terms of broader recovery?<br />
PM, It's confidence that matters and it is GDP and growth<br />
which will bring confidence around, and it's that which<br />
will change the whole ambience of the economy. These<br />
numbers are a cause now for some confidence and some<br />
hope.<br />
J: Is there need for further stimulus to get a more rapid<br />
effect on unemtployment?<br />
PM: No, I think the Government has judged it about right<br />
with the One Nation Statement, the impetus which we<br />
thought it needed, the stimulus which we thought it<br />
needed and I think these numbers make that point for us,<br />
that it will push activity along, push growth along and<br />
push employment along. The people who were saying that<br />
it was overdoing it at the time, have now got some cause<br />
for reflection.<br />
J: any hope thaet unemployment won't hit 10.75 per cent,<br />
the forecast high?<br />
PM: These numbers would be consistent with the forecast<br />
which are included in the One Nation Statement and let's<br />
hope we do better than 10.75.<br />
J; Dr H-ewson is talking about 11.25.<br />
* PM; Dr Hewson has got to be very careful about hie gloomy<br />
comments. I mean does he want a recovery or does he<br />
not? Does he weant to spoil the game for all<br />
Australians?<br />
J: But does he havea a point that perhaps the growth isn't<br />
in the right areas?<br />
PM: Come on, growth is growth. GDP and employment are tied<br />
together, if GDP picks up, growth picks up and<br />
employment picks up.<br />
J: Mr Keating, is the recession over?<br />
PM: The economy is -obviously turning. It's clearly turning<br />
now and that's -the important thing. It is its<br />
direction, and, as I say, with the extra impetus of One<br />
Nation, that fiscal package and those changes coming<br />
through, plus the bulilt-in momentum from the changes to<br />
monetary policy., all of that is going to have its<br />
positive impact on the economy.<br />
