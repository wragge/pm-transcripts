    <content><![CDATA[<p>The largest wind farm in NSW - Capital Wind Farm - has been officially launched by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, NSW Premier Nathan Rees and Minister for Climate Change, Senator Penny Wong today.</p>
<p>The Capital Wind Farm, owned by Infigen Energy, will boost the nation's wind power capacity by more than 10 per cent.</p>
<p>The Farm comprises 67 wind turbines capable of supplying electricity to around 60,000 homes and is almost five times the size of any other wind farm in NSW.</p>
<p>Around 50 wind farms are currently in operation around the nation.</p>
<p>Renewable energy is a critical component of the Rudd Government's commitment to take concrete, practical steps to tackle the threat of climate change.</p>
<p>Under the Government's Renewable Energy Target, 20 per cent of Australia's electricity will come from renewable sources by 2020.</p>
<p>This means that in ten years' time, the amount of electricity coming from sources like wind, wave, solar and geothermal energy will be about equal to Australia's current household electricity use.</p>
<p>The project demonstrates the importance of clean energy industries in creating the high-skilled apprenticeships and jobs of the future - providing employment and economic growth for regional communities.</p>
<p>For example, Australia's first wind farm apprentices are employed at Capital Wind Farm, learning the work of electro technology and wind turbines.</p>
<p>Australian companies, including Victoria's Keppel Prince Engineering and Queensland's RPG, contributed key components to the Capital Wind Farm in partnership with Suzlon Energy Australia, part of the global Suzlon Energy group.</p>
<p>The project provided employment opportunities for over 120 people during the construction phase and will provide ongoing employment in the local community.</p>
<p>The Government is supporting Australia's clean energy industries through the Renewable Energy Target, the Clean Energy Initiative and the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.</p>
<p>As business leaders have said in recent days, the passage of the CPRS through the Senate is critically important to driving investment in the industries that will lead Australia's transformation to a low carbon, clean energy future.</p>
