PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT WEDNESDAY, 4 JULY 1979<br />
REPORT ON CATTLE STRIKE<br />
FROM ABC'S<br />
Report The Minister for Primary Industry, Mr. Sinclair has given a<br />
strong warning to meat buyers; pay the new meat levy rates<br />
or risk your licenses. This follows the decision by cattle<br />
producers this week to withhold their stock from the sales<br />
yards in protest against the meat buyers who want them, the<br />
producers, to pay the levy. Critising the whole industry for<br />
the dispute, Mr. Sinclair also warned that-the build-up in<br />
unsold beef could lead a slump in the market. He is speaking<br />
to Geoff Duncan.<br />
Mr. Sinclair:<br />
What I have said is that they ought to sell their stock on<br />
the terms and conditions of sale that applied before the<br />
1st of July. They are terms and conditions which have operated<br />
satisfactorily for many years and of course, voluntarily, they<br />
can change those terms and conditions of sale. But I am saying<br />
that if they were to accept the threats that are being placed,<br />
against them by the meat buyers, that I would expect that prices<br />
might well collapse as a result of an inevitable over-supply,<br />
of stock at the point when everybody starts selling stock again.<br />
There are a range of ways of selling cattle, sheep and so on.<br />
I would hope that they would all continue in the normal course.<br />
Question B3ut if the meat buyers continue to i mpose the levy, do the<br />
producers have any other choice but to go outside the auction<br />
system? Mr. Sinclair<br />
It is not a matter of the meat buyers setting the terms and<br />
conditions of selling. If the meat buyers are not prepared to<br />
buy stock there are other meat buyers, there are other meat<br />
exporters. I have said in my statement, we are looking at the<br />
present terms and conditions of meat export licenses and at the<br />
restrictive trade practices legislation. By either means it<br />
might be possible to either change the character of the conditions<br />
so that if meat exporters do not comply with the terms and<br />
conditions of selling that have traditionally been opposed, that<br />
their licenses will not be allowed to operate.<br />
Question That's a fairly tough statement. Is that something that the<br />
Government would seriously consider?<br />
Mr. Sinclair<br />
I think that we've got to look at the effect on the Australian<br />
market. Meat industries had a diabolic time over the last few<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>Mr._ Sinclair ( continued) -2<br />
years and it seems incredible that one section is prepared to<br />
hold the whole of the industry at threat and also the<br />
Australian consumer just so that they can make a point.<br />
There are two issues concerned; one is the concern about the<br />
extent of the rise of levy. I can understand and sympathise<br />
with that concern but I believe at least part of the cost<br />
needs to be borne by the whole industry and I don't think it is<br />
fair to ask the taxpayers to pay them all. But the second part<br />
is of course, the normal function of the marketplace. I bel~ eVE!<br />
it foolish for the industry to now completely disrupt that<br />
normal function of the market place simply to try and help one<br />
section who wants to pass the charge which they, in gjencral, are<br />
legally obligated to pay, being the owners of the stock at the<br />
point of slaughter, onto everybody else.<br />
Ques tion<br />
But given that the growers have refused to put their cattle<br />
forward and the buyers are insisting that they pay the levy,<br />
doesn't this amount to a vote of no confidence in thle Government.' s<br />
decision to increase the levy?<br />
Mr. Sinclair<br />
I think what it does is show that there is a real concern amongst<br />
the buyers, at least amongst the sellers, the producers, aboUt<br />
what is going to happen to the marketplace. Now the cattle<br />
industry knows that if it wants to export meat the United States<br />
Department of Agriculture lays down standards which we have to<br />
meet in order to get into that market. Now, if they wish to<br />
bypass that market, then there would be no reason to have the<br />
charge. What we have said is not that the whole charge has<br />
to be borne by the industry, but at least half of it should be.<br />
