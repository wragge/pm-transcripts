EMBARGO: 4. OOPM SUNDAY 12 MARCH 1974<br />
) AUSTRALIA 12 May 1974<br />
PETROL PRICE<br />
The Liberal and Country Parties are now clearly committed to<br />
a massive increase in the price of petrol. It is no comfort to<br />
Australian consumers to be told that the full impact might be delayed<br />
a year. Not only would the price of petrol go up but all goods would<br />
go up as a result of increased production costs and transport costs.<br />
Mr. Anthony let the cat out of the bag let the tiger out of the<br />
* tank. He has destroyed the Opposition's remaining credibility on<br />
the issue of inflation. If this sectional and divided coalition<br />
became a Government, inflation would go through the roof.<br />
Mr. Snedden and Mr. Anthony are united on one thing; they<br />
believe the price of oil should go up next year. They have not yet<br />
said how much they believe it should go up. The truth is that their<br />
policy means an extra 20 cents per gallon on petrol. Fuel oil and<br />
LPG wodld go up by $ 200 a ton. Increases of this size cannot be<br />
Justified. Their impact on inflation would be huge, whether it<br />
happened now or next year.<br />
0 Australian voters will not be fooled by the pre-election attempts<br />
of the opposition to cover up this outrageous proposal. On Wednesday<br />
in Perth Mr. Anthony said that a rise in the crude oil price was " urgent".<br />
He said the same on 11 March of this year. He said then that there would<br />
Sbe a " substantial jump in the price of oil" in September 1975 and added<br />
W that a " gradual rise" would be more easily absorbed. He seems to have<br />
backed away from his idea to increase prices in a series of steps.<br />
But he has now confirmed the Opposition's support for a ' substantial jump<br />
in the price of oil" next year.<br />
Mr. Snedden has known for some time that this was Mr. Anthony's<br />
view. It is only now, just before the elections, that he tried to get<br />
out of it. Why did he refuse to make these statements when Mr. Anthony<br />
said similar things before?. Mr. Snedden was asked at a press conference<br />
on 10 April to " make an unequivocal statement that the agreement would<br />
not be re-negotiated before September 1975". He refused. What he did<br />
say was very revealing:<br />
" There is no reason why the other parties to the agreement<br />
can't ask us for it to be re-negotiated and if they did so<br />
then of course it would have to be discussed with them."<br />
If BHP and ESSO wanted to increase their profits by a minimum<br />
of $ 260 million per yeaV under Liberal/ Country Party government all<br />
they would have to do is ask! ./ 2 </p>
