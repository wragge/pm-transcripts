PRIME MINISTER'S QUEENSLAND BROADCAST-NO. 8<br />
TRANSPORT<br />
Sunday 11 May 1975<br />
It's a sad fact that Brisbane has some of the worst<br />
public transport in Australia. You all know what an ordeal<br />
it can be getting to work, or home again or anywhere else<br />
for that matter on overcrowded or dilapidated trains,<br />
often running late into the bargain. Run-down old-fashioned<br />
transport services are not just uncomfortable and slow; they<br />
are uneconomic as well. More and more people are forced to<br />
take their cars to work, and the number of passengers declines.<br />
Transport losses increase, fares keep going up, and still<br />
more people are discouraged from using the services. It's<br />
a vicious circle, It's a problem faced in most of the world's<br />
great cities, but with this difference: other-cities are doing<br />
something about it. Brisbane is lagging behind.<br />
When Labor camne in we.-gave a high priority to upgrading<br />
urban transport services in our great cities. Of course we<br />
can't do this without the ' cooperation of the States. We have<br />
offered the Queensland Government almost $ 20 million over the<br />
next three and a half years to electrify your suburban railways<br />
and upgrade Brisbane transport services generally. No national<br />
Government has ever made free grants for urban transport before.<br />
The Bjelke-Petersen Governmentdithered and delayed for a long<br />
time before accepting our proposals. As far back as 1957 the<br />
Country Party in this State scrapped the previous Labop<br />
Government's plans for suburban electrification. They did<br />
nothing for 18 years until my Government's offer was made<br />
last year. Some of you may remember the modern urban passenger<br />
carriage we put on display in City Square a few months ago.<br />
That's a sample of the comfortable, streamlined trains we<br />
hope to see eventually on all Brisbane's suburban railways.<br />
And it's not just in city transport that a Labor<br />
Government is getting on with the job. Previou ' s Liberal<br />
Governments in Canberra shirked one of the great development*<br />
projects needed in Queensland a national highway linking<br />
her coastal cities wiLth Brisbane and the southern States.<br />
Labor has given the go-ahead for a high-grade all-weather<br />
highway to link Cairns with Brisbane and eventuall' with<br />
Sydney and Melbourne. Despite opposition obstruction we<br />
have passed the necessary legislation to provide $ 1,126 million<br />
for our national roads program over the next three years.<br />
We are the first National Government in Australia to undertake<br />
this essential program. No State. Government has had the<br />
resources to do it alone. No previous Federal Government<br />
cared enough to do it even though they had thq necessary<br />
constitutional powers. We are using those powers. We are<br />
getting on with the job. </p>
<p>2.<br />
lh are doing a lot for other roads as well. For<br />
example, to improve Mt. Isa's links with the rest of<br />
Queensland the Australian Government will help build<br />
: the Landsborough Highway from Mt. Isa to Brisbane as a<br />
full-scale all-weather road. This will be part of the<br />
national highways program, so Mt. Isa will be linked in<br />
due coburse by first-class roads to Melbourne and Sydney.<br />
On top of that we will spend $ 24 million in<br />
Queensland on northern beef roads over the next three<br />
years. All of this means a first-class rural and intercity<br />
road network for Queensland. It's worth recalling<br />
that the Bjelke-Petersen Government in 1972 promised that<br />
all Queensland State highways would be full bitumen roads<br />
by 1975. Of course that won't happen. But with the help<br />
of the Australian Labor Government Queensland's roads will<br />
be among the best in Australia.<br />
There are two other matters I want to mention in<br />
the transport area. One is the new international terminal<br />
we are building at Brisbane airport at cost of more than<br />
$ 4 million. We expect it to.. be finished by the end of this<br />
year. The other concerns the Australian National Line. We<br />
want to see Queensland's coastal cities served by A. N. L.<br />
ships. There is no reason in the world why Australia's own<br />
shipping line shouldn't~ ply between the ports on Queensland's<br />
coast. But Mr. Bjelke-Petersen won't let them. He insists<br />
that A. N. L. ships should only sail between a Queensland port<br />
and a port in another State. And he's alone among the Premiers<br />
in preventing the A. N. L. providing services between ports in<br />
Queensland. As a result we have the absurd situation of<br />
foreign ships being chartered to carry bauxite from Weipa<br />
to Gladstone -a job that Australian ships could do just as<br />
well. I'm afraid Mr. Bjelke-Petersen's obstinacy hasn't<br />
helped transport services in Queensland. I spoke earlier<br />
of railways. When we came to office the Labor Government<br />
offered to take over financial responsibility for all State<br />
railways. These railways are a crippling burden on State<br />
budgets and financing them puts a heavy strain on a State's<br />
resources. There is no constitutional barrier to the<br />
Australian Government taking over these services in fact<br />
the Constitution specifically envisages such a possibility<br />
in Section 51. We have just reached agreement with South<br />
Australia which will relieve that State of the financial<br />
burden of its non-metropolitan rail services. Mr. Bjelke-Petersen<br />
has refused to discuss our offer. So whenever you hear<br />
Mr. Bjelke-Petersen crying poor mouth, or complaining of a<br />
lack of help from the Australian Government, remember the<br />
opportunity he has turned down to boost his State revenues<br />
and improve transport systems throughout Queensland. My<br />
Government is doing everything in its power to help. It<br />
will be a great pity if Queensland people have to put up<br />
any longer with bad roads or run-down buses and trains because<br />
their Premier won't cooperate with a National Labor Government. </p>
