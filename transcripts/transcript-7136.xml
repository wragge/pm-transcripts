CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EM1BARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF GREEK-AUSTRALIAN CONFERENCE<br />
MELBOURNE 13 M4ARCH 1987<br />
Thank you for your invitation to open the Greek-Australian<br />
conference here in Melbourne today.<br />
I must at tic outset extend a special welcome to our<br />
distinguishied guests from Greece. The Greek Government has<br />
made a signi.~ icant contribution to the success of this<br />
conference by sending to us the Deputy minister for Culture<br />
responsible or Greeks Abro ' ad, the Minister-for the Aegean,<br />
and the Deputy minister of Education Culture and Health.<br />
Welcomae alioo to other members of the Greek Parliament,<br />
univeraity professors and other Greek visitors. Your<br />
presence is indeed a pleasure and an honour for us.<br />
Seeing you here brings back warm memories of the hospitality<br />
extended to me by Prime Minister Papandreou and the Greek<br />
Government 6nd the very valuable talks we had in Greece last<br />
year. That visitz, which stands out as a highlight in m~ y period as<br />
Prime minister, was a splendid confirmation of the close<br />
friendship and cooperation between Greece and Australia.<br />
May I ask our Greek visitors to convey the regards and<br />
respect oe the Australian Government and people to the Greek<br />
Government and people on your return.<br />
No one could visit Australia today without appreciating the<br />
exceptional contribution Greek people have made to this<br />
nation. There are well over 300,000 Australians whose first<br />
language is Greek, in addition to those of succeeding<br />
generations who have maintained the language of their<br />
forebears. Many Australians cherish their Greek origin as<br />
well as their Australian identity. And for us all the Greek<br />
tradition is an essential component of our shared cultural<br />
heritage. Today, G~ cck Australians are in a unique position to bring<br />
together the best of both worlds the Greek love of freedom<br />
and the A~ ustralian passion for equality of opportunity. </p>
<p>Since the beginning of European settlement Australia and<br />
Greece have shared many experiences. Greeks first arrived<br />
in this country in 1829 convicts who had been transported<br />
for piracy in the Mediterranean. Since then the Greek<br />
contribution to this nation has been felt and appreciated in<br />
virtually every industry and occupation and in virtually<br />
every town and city including, I am proud to say, in the<br />
Australian Labor Party.<br />
Australians hrive had other strong links with Greece. We<br />
fought there in two World Wars.<br />
While in Atiens last year, I had the memorable experience of<br />
attending and speaking at the Anzac Day ceremony. I<br />
recalled then, as 7* do now, the Battle of Crete, where<br />
Australians stood side by side with their Greek and other<br />
allies defending Greece against the Axis invaders. Those<br />
dramatic days have left enduring friendships, not only among<br />
those who fougjht, but among men and women of succeeding<br />
generations. Greek Austrailians and Australian ex-service personnel are<br />
joining to erect an Australian-Hellenic Memorial in Canberra<br />
to commemorate these shared experiences.<br />
Our Government was happy to be able to make a site available<br />
near the Australian War Memorial in Canberra and I look<br />
forward to launching the appeal to raise funds for the<br />
Australian Hellenic Memorial early next month.<br />
The very Gijnificant Greek-Australian component of our<br />
population mlakes it especially important that Greece be well<br />
represented in our Bicentenary celebrations next year. A<br />
Greek Australian Bicentenary Committee has been established<br />
in Athens to co-ordinate Greek participation. We are keen<br />
to explore ways in which some of the exciting proposals that<br />
emerged fromt the Committee's first meeting last month might<br />
be implemented. We look forward too to the participation of<br />
representatives from Greece in the many commemorative<br />
sporting, academic, cultural and other events and activities<br />
which will he a special feature of life in Australia in<br />
1988.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The Austral-an community represents an almost unparalleled<br />
diversity of ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious<br />
origins and identities. We have been a multicultural<br />
community since at least 1788. Today, one in five<br />
Australians was born overseas, one in three has parents born<br />
overseas and immigrants make up a quarter of the labour<br />
force. </p>
<p>3.<br />
In recognition of this diversity, the Australian government<br />
has developed and adopted multiculturalism as a key social<br />
policy. The concept has been articulated as a legitimate<br />
element of the national political agenda since the early<br />
19701s, for which we acknowledge the contribution of an<br />
earlier Labor government.<br />
Multiculturalism has developed as a social policy which<br />
significantly affects all Australians. It is predicated on<br />
the notion of equality--o opportunity for all, not isolated<br />
privilege for. some.<br />
The basic p'-iiiciples of multicultural ism have most recently<br />
been enunciated in the Government's Review of Migrant and<br />
multicultural Programs and Services.<br />
This stated that, first, all members of the Australian<br />
community should have an equitable opportunity to<br />
participate in the economic, social, cultural and political<br />
life of the nation.<br />
Second, all members of the Australian community should have<br />
access to an equitable share of the resources which<br />
governments manage on behalf of the community.<br />
Third, all mzmbers of the Australian community should have<br />
the opportunity to participate in and influence the design<br />
and operaition of government policies, programs and services.<br />
And finally, all members of the Australian community should<br />
have the right, within the law, to enjoy their own culture,<br />
to practise their own religion, and to use their own<br />
language and should respect the rights of others to their<br />
own culture, religion and language..<br />
Multiculturalism thus does not deny the importance of<br />
promoting rocial harmony and a distinctive national<br />
identity. 7ndeed multiculturalism is essential if we are to<br />
promote a sense of unity as a nation. After all, few things<br />
are more divisive or destabilising than attempts to impose<br />
inequality or repress individuality. That way lies discord<br />
an~ d disunity.<br />
Multiculturalism is more than mere rhetoric. All<br />
Australians, irrespective of background, have the right to<br />
participate fully in national life and it is incumbent on<br />
government to identify and remove barriers to that process,<br />
and to mtake the resources of the community fairly available<br />
to all Australians. The Government must, further, ensure<br />
equitable access to its own services.<br />
We must su~ pport people in exercising not only their<br />
obligations but also their rights to influence the shaping<br />
of decisions and programs that affect them. Consultation<br />
will continue to be a guiding principle of this Government. </p>
<p>4.<br />
I recently appointed my colleague Mick Young as Minister for<br />
Immigration aind Ethnic Affairs. He has long had a keen<br />
interest in Australia's migrant community not least as<br />
shadow Minister for three years.<br />
Mr Young wil Ibe assisted in this portfolio by Minister<br />
Clyde Holdirig.<br />
I have also asked Mr Young to assist me in my portfolio<br />
duties on multicultural Affairs.<br />
Today I wish to announce further steps in my Government's<br />
enhancement of multiculturalism.<br />
I am establishing twzo bodies dealing with multiculturalism<br />
the Advisory Council on Multicultural Affairs and the Office<br />
of Multicultural Affairs.<br />
The Advisory Council will be reporting directly to me and to<br />
Mr Young.<br />
The Council is to be chaired by Justice Sir James Gobbo of<br />
the Victorian Supreme Court. Sir James has had a leading<br />
role in serving Governments and community groups. He is<br />
exceptionally placed to advise on the policy of<br />
multiculturalism and to help further its acceptance and<br />
expression in today's Australia. Sir James will undoubtedly<br />
be more then ably assisted by his Deputy, Mlr George Wojak,<br />
who also has an acknowledged record of service across all<br />
sections of the Australian comvmunity. He is currently<br />
President of the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils<br />
of Australia.<br />
I expect the Council to play a key role in providing advice<br />
on ways to promote Australia's continuing evolution as a<br />
multicultural community.<br />
The Council will be supported in its role by the new office<br />
of Multicultural Affairs being established in my Department.<br />
The Head of the office is Dr Peter Shergold. Peter has been<br />
Associate Professor in the Department of Economic History at<br />
the University of New South Wales. He will already be known<br />
to many of you through his research expertise and his work<br />
with the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils as well<br />
as his direct responsibilities in setting up the Ethnic<br />
Archives at the University of New South Wales.<br />
These decisions are significant.<br />
For we cannot assume that the ideals of multiculturalism<br />
will win by default.<br />
All of us who believe in these values must be prepared to<br />
defend them.<br />
Reactionary forces in various guises are now engaged in a<br />
concerted assault on the basic decencies which are<br />
fundamental to Australia. </p>
<p>Attempting to appeal to fear, uncertainty and ignorance,<br />
they are seeking tQ redistribute public wealth from ordinary<br />
Australians to the greedy few; to put a strait-jacket on our<br />
great institutions of organised labour; to realign our<br />
foreign policy with the diminishing centres of racism and<br />
apartheid.<br />
And I have no doubt that they also have multiculturalism in<br />
their sights.<br />
People who should know better purport to find something<br />
sinister in the Bicentennial concept of " Living Together".<br />
Presumably they look back fondly to the origins of European<br />
settlement in Australia brilliantly and starkly described in<br />
Robert Hughes' ' The Fatal Shore'.<br />
As Hughes points out, the establishment of that era not only<br />
sought for example, to subjugate our Irish ancestors. Their<br />
treatment of Australia's Aboriginal community had much<br />
harsher and~ more tragic consequences. it is only in the<br />
past 20 years that Federal Governments of both major parties<br />
have taken real steps to redress the balance.<br />
Yet there are those today who would still impose an<br />
assimilationist, monolithic standard to which all groups<br />
should conform, who would withdraw assistance from those<br />
groups who need it, who have no concern for access or<br />
equity, who, as I have said, even baulk at the humanity in<br />
the notion of ' Living Together'.<br />
one of our 9teat achievements as a nation is that we have<br />
transcended cur intolerant, divisive origins. I am proudwe<br />
can all be proud that Australia has developed into a<br />
cohesive and essentially very decent and humane society, in<br />
which people of different ethnic backgrounds, religions,<br />
races and languages are able to get " a fair go".<br />
This Government will do what must be done to defend and<br />
advance thiG vital process.<br />
That is why I believe our initiatives on multiculturalism<br />
are important and timely.<br />
And that is why it is very appropriate that the Victorian<br />
Government in conjunction with the Greek Government and the<br />
Greek commuinities of Victoria should have organised this<br />
Conference to discuss and assess the needs and concerns of<br />
the Greek community in the 1980' s.<br />
I congratulate you on this initiative and wish you success. </p>
