Tribute. by. the F?-rime Minister,_ M. john Gorton<br />
The death of Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes has robbed Australia<br />
of one cG its most distinguished citizens.<br />
He had devoted his life to service to his country as a scholar,<br />
soldier, politician and statesman. He also made a significant contribution to<br />
Australian sport, b-ath as an Olympic Games representative in his own right<br />
and in later years as President of the Victorian Olympic Council and Chairman<br />
of the Organising Committee of the Melb( urne Olympic Games.<br />
In 43 years as a Parlimentarian he served as a Minister in the<br />
Victorian and Federal Parliaments, and was an outstanding soldier in both<br />
world wars. His fortitude and qualities of leadership were further demonstrated<br />
during the three-and-a-half years he spent in Japanese prisoner-of-war camps.<br />
Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes was a fine Australian. a man of integrity<br />
and great strength of character. His death is a loss to me personally, to the<br />
Liberal Party, tu the Federal Parliament and to the nation.<br />
I extend my deepest sympathy tn his family.<br />
