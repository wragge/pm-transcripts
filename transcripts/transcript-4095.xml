AUSRL IA<br />
77RIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 11 April 1976<br />
ELECTORAL TALK<br />
If our great coixw= y is again to fulfill its potentialand<br />
the standardz living for all Australians is to increasetheaj<br />
the role our manufacturers will be crucial.<br />
The health of the manufacturing sector is the key to national<br />
growth, productivity, employment and reflects directly on<br />
the ability of consumzers to consume.<br />
If the manuffact~ ing sector is stagnant, without confidence<br />
without hope the--any chance of economic growth wi. ll have<br />
been shattere..<br />
Manufacturer-s -large and small are the lifeblood of Australia.<br />
They directly emtploy-one in every four people in the workforce.<br />
They supply about 20 percent of the value of our exports<br />
and supply most of the goods we use every day.<br />
This Government is determined to stimulate real growth<br />
and productivity in manufacturing.<br />
We have already created a climate where manufacturers can plan<br />
ahead with confidence knowing that the national Government<br />
will make rational and consistent decisions on their behalf.<br />
During the Whitlam years, manufactueres slowly but surely<br />
lost the confidence of government; they lost the incentive<br />
to expand and the opportunities to employ. They lost the courage<br />
to spend money on plant and equipment. They opted to mark time.<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>This situation had a wider effect. Consumers also suffered<br />
because they often had to pa~ y higher prices for poorer<br />
quality goods. Their choice of goods contracted because<br />
manufacturers coi. 11d not afford to invest in new product<br />
lines and new techniques.<br />
Those days are gone.<br />
This Government has taken a great number of positive<br />
measures that will directly and indirectly return confidence<br />
to manufacturers. A number of other measures are at this<br />
moment being carefully examined.<br />
Our first and most important task has been to get<br />
predictibility back in government decision making<br />
processes.. We are not in the buoiness -of keeping businessmen dangling<br />
on a rope wondering what we will do next. We are in the<br />
business of consultation, not confrontation.<br />
One of our first decisions in government was to set up an<br />
economic consultative group to monitor trends in the private<br />
business world and to report these trends speedily to the<br />
Government. The group includes representatives from the~<br />
trade union movement, big business and small business.<br />
The information provided by this important group will supplement<br />
the wide range of statistical data we recieve from of ficial<br />
sources and will give us early warning signals about any<br />
emerging problems.<br />
We have also looked closely at the role of the Industries<br />
Assistance Commission.<br />
Many factors must ba considered by the Commission when it<br />
presents its reports. / 3 </p>
<p>It must exaine the method and level of tariff and<br />
other assistance necessary to adequately protect Australian<br />
manufacturers against import competition.<br />
It has a responsbility to judge whether the industry<br />
could be more efficient and to take this into account<br />
when applying any tariff.<br />
It must show whether the industry is less efficient<br />
than it could be due to fragmentation or lack of<br />
specialisation. And fundamentally, it must rev iew the<br />
probable economic and social consequences of altering<br />
existing levels of assistance.<br />
These reporting ruzles will not in any way alter the ground<br />
rules of the Commission's operations. Rather, they will<br />
ensure that the Commission's reports are as detached<br />
and independent as possible.<br />
Another of the measures the Government has taken to get<br />
manufacturing moving f.% rward again has been the suspension<br />
of quarterly tax instalments. Businessmen no longer<br />
have the worrying burden of finding cash sums each three<br />
months. They can now plan over a 12 month period<br />
without loss of liquidity throughout the year.<br />
The Government's 40 percent investmentL allowance is again<br />
aimed at giving the businessman particularly those<br />
who invest in plant and machinery real incentive to make<br />
expansionary plans.<br />
As I mentioned in my broadcast last week, the Government<br />
has laid down clear and sensible guidelines for the<br />
inflow of foreign money, and of foreign expertise. This<br />
measure was-aimed directly at getting Australian business<br />
back in business again.<br />
The motor vehicle industry a key industry for any<br />
manufacturing nation now has a strong and </p>
<p>purposeful set of guidelines for growth and development.<br />
This sector can now plan ahead with confidecne.<br />
I have often repeated our pledge to introduce the individual and ccmpany<br />
aspects of the Matthews Report, as soon as practicable.<br />
When implemented that report's recommendation for a<br />
stock valuation adjastment and a depreciation<br />
valuation adjustment will materially assist expansion<br />
in the manufacturing sector.<br />
Following an election pledge and following a recommendation<br />
in the Jackson Report on manufacturing industry the<br />
Government is urgently proceediny with a White Paper on<br />
manufacturing. This paper will receive top priority consideration<br />
by myself and by Cabinet.<br />
The Government is also concerned that businessmen and manufacturers<br />
can get on with their production without the shackle of<br />
unnecessary regulation. Restrictive regulations are<br />
not, foL this government, ends in themselves.<br />
Accordingly, we are reviewing the trade practices legislation<br />
with the view to removing the crippli g red tape and<br />
controls that service no useful purpose and that stifle<br />
. meaningful expansion plans. I want to make it clear here that<br />
the consumer will not lose in letter or spirit the protection<br />
that this law now provides.<br />
Our policies to date and our planned moves underline<br />
the centrai thrust of the Governmesit's appraoch to the<br />
manufacturing industry.-and. that is to ensure the<br />
steady, predictable and long-term creation of new<br />
employment opportunities and to foster new products and<br />
processes. Only then will all Australians-whether they are factory<br />
workers, farmers, public servants or housewives have a real<br />
chance to live their own lives the way they want. </p>
