ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND<br />
TECHNOLOGY<br />
Statement to the House of Representatives by the<br />
Prime Minister ( the Rt. hion. William McMahon,<br />
Thursday 27th April 1972<br />
I rise to inform the House of new<br />
arrangements that the Government will make in<br />
relation to science and technology in Australia.<br />
These arrangements will involve the<br />
establishment of an Advisory Committee on<br />
Science and Technology and provision for an<br />
appropriate secretariat. The function of this<br />
Advisory Committee is to furnish co-ordinated<br />
advice on actions and policies that would<br />
assist in the alignment of our science and<br />
technology, to our national objectives.<br />
Honourable Members will be aware of<br />
striking advances in science and technology over<br />
the past half-century. A few familiar examples<br />
come to mind radar, antibiotics, the jet engine,<br />
immunology, satellite communications and<br />
latterly, space exploration there are many others. / 2 </p>
<p>After World War II, it was recognised<br />
internationally that major investment in science,<br />
in education and in science-based activities would<br />
be a prominent feature of the future. Scientific<br />
research in all fields has therefore received<br />
increasing support from governments and as a<br />
consequence, science and technology in their<br />
totality have contributed enormously to the economic<br />
and social advancement and the well-being of many<br />
countries. Australia has both contributed to and<br />
benefited from these advances. The Commonwealth<br />
Government has been involved in the development<br />
of science and technology in Australia virtually<br />
from the time of Federation, and has played a<br />
key role through the policies which it has<br />
developed over the years to meet the changing<br />
pattern of national needs and opportunities.<br />
These policies comprehend the creation<br />
of a resource of skilled scientists and<br />
technologists, and the pursuit of rigorous<br />
programs of scientific research and technological<br />
development, both within the Government and<br />
outside principally in the universities and in </p>
<p>-3-<br />
industry. Some of these activities have been<br />
undertaken in partnership with the States.<br />
The Commonwealth has encouraged and<br />
expanded the scientific and technological efforts<br />
of its own agencies such as the the<br />
Australian Atomic Energy Commission, and the<br />
Department of Supply. Moreover, the Commonwealth<br />
has developed schemes to provide financial support<br />
for science and technology outside of its own<br />
fields of immediate responsibility. For example,<br />
research of high scientific merit is supported<br />
financially through the Australian Research Grants<br />
Committee; industrial research and innovation are<br />
assisted through the Industrial Research and<br />
Development Grants Board, and scientific work in<br />
the fields of medicine and health services is<br />
supported through the National Health and Medical<br />
Research Council. One result of this support has<br />
been the emergence in fields such as radio<br />
atroriorny and medicine, of institutions which<br />
have i. eved international recognition and have<br />
become centres of excellence. The Government<br />
will continue to foster the development of such<br />
centres and in this context I remind the House of<br />
the Government's decision to establish an </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Australian Institute of Marine Science which<br />
we trust in the fullness of time will achieve<br />
similar international recognition.<br />
The Government has thus played,<br />
through its various policies and actions, a<br />
major role in bringing Australian science and<br />
technology to their present advanced state, and<br />
has, I believe, abundant reason to be proud of<br />
the record of Australian scientists in this<br />
regard, The Government will continue to play<br />
a major role in these fields.<br />
The rapid, and at times spectacular,<br />
advance made by science and technology in<br />
recent years has brought with it a number of<br />
problems. For example, some research has<br />
become very expensive in terms of manpower,<br />
money and equipment. Indeed some fields require<br />
facilities which are beyond the resources of<br />
almost any single one of the developed nations<br />
beyond the resources, that is, if the country<br />
concerned is to maintain balance among the<br />
competing claims on the public purse. As a<br />
consequence, countries have been compelled to<br />
make explicit choice from among its various<br />
scientific and technological projects and to </p>
<p>determine priorities for the allocation of<br />
resources. There is an increasing tendency<br />
therefore for countries to concentrate part of<br />
their resources on particular areas in which<br />
they have demonstrable need, expertise, or<br />
unique environmental opportunities. In addition,<br />
there is a growing tendency to avoid the national<br />
development of large and very expensive projects<br />
and to look towards the possibility of<br />
co-operation on an international basis.<br />
Another problem of increasing concern<br />
to many countries, arises from the adverse<br />
effects which have been recognised as flowing<br />
from some applications of science and<br />
technology. I need not elaborate in detail on<br />
such matters as despoliation of national<br />
resources. What I do want to emphasise is that<br />
the Government takes the view that, before<br />
deciding to support new areas of science and<br />
technology, it is mandatory not only to assess<br />
the potential benefits, but also to forecast<br />
possible undesirable results. Only the best<br />
advice that can be obtained for this purpose is<br />
good enough. / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Australia has reached the stage where<br />
it becomes more important than ever to judge our<br />
priorities carefully because we cannot cover the<br />
whole field. We are therefore obliged to make<br />
decisions as to which of the demands should be<br />
satisfied. It may also be necessary to create<br />
opportunities for new scientific and technical<br />
developments so that specific national objectives<br />
can be achieved. We have thus two aims to<br />
resolve the demands and promote areas outside<br />
of these demands. Neither can be neglected and<br />
a balance must be achieved.<br />
The growth and complexity of science<br />
and technology, together with the emergence of<br />
problems such as those outlined have led other<br />
countries to establish formal machinery for<br />
providing to them expert advice on a co-ordinated<br />
basis. While the Government has been aware of<br />
these moves it has only reached its present<br />
position after careful consideration of the<br />
desirability for Australia to adopt similar<br />
procedures. Up to the present time in developing<br />
policies for science and technology it has been<br />
our practice to seek advice through formal or / 7 </p>
<p>informal channels from those sources most<br />
able to assist. However, with the experience<br />
of other countries as a guide and the increasing<br />
range and complexity of the problems which we<br />
face it is now timely to change our approach.<br />
After examination by the Minister for<br />
Education and Science of experience and<br />
developments overseas, and following discussions<br />
with leading industrialists, with the Australian<br />
Academy of Science and with senior Government<br />
scientists, the Government has decided to<br />
establish an Advisory Committee on Science and<br />
Technology. I should perhaps point out to<br />
Honourable Members that the establishment of<br />
similar advisory committees in other countries<br />
and the problems tackled by them have led to the<br />
use of the term " science policy", the meaning of<br />
which is frequently misunderstood. Science<br />
policy in the sense in which it is generally<br />
accepted by governments implies a deliberate<br />
and coherent framework for the provision of<br />
advice on the size, structure, creativity and<br />
utilisation of scientific and technological<br />
research, as a basis for policy decisions on<br />
these matters. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
The purpose of this framework, in<br />
the sense that I have described it, should be<br />
clearly understood, It is one of the means by<br />
which governments can be assisted in their<br />
considerations of the various factors which<br />
need to be taken into account in reaching<br />
decisions concerned with the attainment of<br />
national goals. The primary function of the Committee<br />
to which I have referred and which will report<br />
to me through the Minister for Education and<br />
Science will be to make recommendations to the<br />
Government, on Australian efforts in civil<br />
science and technology. It will assess on a<br />
continuing basis Australian requirements,<br />
resources and potential in civil science and<br />
technology and will provide advice on these<br />
matters. The Government intends that the<br />
Committee should make wide ranging and<br />
comprehensive assessments of the scientific<br />
and technological situation. It will advise<br />
on such facets as long term planning, new areas<br />
which are of importance to Australia, the<br />
priorities that should be assigned to specific / 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
projects or areas of research, the means for<br />
improving efficiency in the use of resources<br />
and the effective development and utilisation of<br />
scientific and technological manpower.<br />
The Committee will be empowered to<br />
undertake studies on its own initiative, in<br />
addition to providing advice on specific<br />
matters that are referred to it by the Government.<br />
The Committee's interests will lie<br />
mainly in the fields of civil science and<br />
technology. It is not intended that it be<br />
concerned with questions of defence science<br />
except to the extent that these may be related<br />
to matters that fall in its own fields of<br />
primary concern. Nor is it intended that the<br />
Committee's activities extend into fields of<br />
medical research which are the responsibility<br />
of the National Health and Medical Research<br />
Council. The Committee will have a membership<br />
of 11 distinguished persons with experience in<br />
manufacturing industry, primary industry, mining<br />
industry, commerce and finance and science. All<br />
members, including the Chairman, will serve </p>
<p>part-time and will be appointed for three year<br />
terms. Members of the Committee will be<br />
announced at an early date. Senior Commonwealth<br />
officers, including Permanent Heads, will not<br />
serve directly on the Committee, but will assist<br />
it as assessors and will be available to advise<br />
on specific matters within their areas of<br />
individual responsibility. It will be seen<br />
therefore as completely independent.<br />
The Committee will consult with other<br />
relevant advisory bodies with a view to ensuring<br />
liaison on areas of mutual interest and to<br />
avoiding duplication of effort. It will submit<br />
an annual report which will be tabled in the<br />
Parliament. The Committee will have difficult<br />
and long ranging tasks to perform and it is<br />
serviced by a competent and high level<br />
secretariat which, by the qualifications and<br />
experience of its members, will be able to<br />
provide the support which the Committee will<br />
need. As I have already mentioned the<br />
Commonwealth over many years, has played a<br />
key role in the development and application of / 11 </p>
<p>-11-<br />
science and technology in Australia. However,<br />
the Government recognises the important roles<br />
also played by State Governments, by industry,<br />
and by Universities. It therefore looks forward<br />
to their co-operation in the work of this<br />
Advisory Committee, in the belief that the<br />
effective and balanced development of the<br />
national effort in science and technology will<br />
be in the best interests of the nation as a whole. </p>
