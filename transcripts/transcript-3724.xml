international issues.<br />

countries in that region.<br />
There was recognition that the countries of the region should<br />
work collectively for the protection of their resources within<br />
a new world economic order based on ideological pluralism<br />
and universality of relations, principles which both Governments<br />
observe. The Prime Ministers discussed the question of disarmament<br />
and arms control, particularly the problem of nuclear disarmament.<br />

world-wide agreement to end all nuclear weapons tests<br />
as a necessary step towards complete and general disarmament </p>
<p>2.<br />
under effective international control. They expressed<br />
support for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the<br />
hope that countries which have not yet ratified this would<br />
do so in the near future.<br />

with which his country followed developments in the non-aligned<br />
movement and his Government's interest in establishing close<br />
relations with it. The Prime Minister of Peru welcomed this<br />
interest which his Government viewed with sympathy.<br />
In the bilateral field they exchanged valuable assessments<br />
and information on broad political, economic and commercial<br />
issues. These exchanges revealed a similar progressive<br />
approach based on rejection of any threats to their people's<br />
freedom of choice and sovereignty over their natural resources<br />
including Maritime resources.<br />

the information provided by his distinguished counterpart<br />
on the general situation in Australia.<br />

friendly nation to further its development as well as its<br />
important initiatives in the sphere of international economic<br />
relations. In turn the Australian Prime Minister received . iith interest<br />
an account of the Peruvian situation, the profound changes<br />
in the political, economic, social and cultural fieldM and<br />
the significant progress already achieved for the benefit<br />
of the Peruvian people. These developments underlined the<br />
importance attached to the Velasco doctrine in promoting<br />
the development of Latin American countries by devoting the<br />
greatest means possible to their progress, and also in<br />
assisting efforts towards world disarmament and universal<br />
peace. The Prime Ministers agreed to establish a mixed Intergovernmental<br />
Commiss-ion for economic cooperation, which will have<br />
the object of examining economic relations and of entering<br />
into basic agreements for cooperation in the commercial,<br />
financial, maritime transport and technical and scientific<br />
cooperation fields.<br />

two Governments." A-e. </p>
<p>3.<br />
3h short we are laying the basis for a happy,<br />
secure life in the peacetime forces of our country.<br />
As one who spent four years in the services I know how<br />
important that is. And with the other reforms we have<br />
made, and the equipment programs under way, I have no<br />
doubt-that Australia is in a better position than she<br />
has ever been to meet any military threat or military<br />
obligation in the foreseeable future. </p>
