do' you feel?"<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Ri~ laxea. , I am glad that the fight is over, that the election is<br />
ovek, because that nowv enables us to get on with the business of<br />
GZoVernment, and put oUr plans into action.<br />
Question<br />
WTh. at are the f irst priorities?<br />
Prirne-kinister<br />
will1 be having discussions with my own Department either tonight<br />
tomorrow morning.. because there is some legislation that : 1 would<br />
'.: like to ' get through in a ishort session before Christmas<br />
P~ ob~ ably about two weekst the training a.. wz. e t<br />
people to -undertak~ en. training rather than to be unemployed -that<br />
. puqbt to be operating as Boon as possible.<br />
* Question<br />
Does-it concern you that the majority of Austra. ianls did not<br />
: vote for your Party.<br />
. PrmeMinister<br />
What counts are the numbers you get in the Parlianient, and we<br />
* had vprystrong support for the Liberal Party and for the National<br />
* Peirty combined. The voting system works -and it is a Very fair one.<br />
We have the rnumbfers in the Parliament.<br />
Question Arce-you concernera that your Government's actions may be frustrated<br />
* by the Democrats in. the Senate?<br />
Prime* U~ inister<br />
I -thinX, that -is Jumping too far ahead, because in Queensland I<br />
think-we will h ave three Government Senators. 711nere ierTwchanz; of<br />
that in New South Wales, South Autralia, and also in Western<br />
-:-Australia. go it is qch. 1 6: early to assume that the Denmorats<br />
would bave the' balance of power in the Senate. S.<br />
. ij<br />
I .7. </p>
<p>I I Question if they dic hold the balance of power<br />
Primfe Minister<br />
: 1 do not need hypothetical circumstances before I comie to them.<br />
-Ques9tion<br />
. Whatother legis ati6h aPa ~ rom thle training legislation<br />
I. ~ ie Minister<br />
-* Well#, I wilkb 9Ing. through~ all the. policy commitments :. to-have. a<br />
lok at what ought to be done. That will enable the drafting to<br />
be undertaken.<br />
Quesftion-Would you have any . o1thers in mind at this stage that you can<br />
pp ipoint:; any other aspects of legislation that you<br />
~ in~ e MinSter___<br />
that renlly isthe-one thing that ija forefront in my mind; but<br />
we ar~ e obviously not going to meet for a couple of weeks just for<br />
-tha ' t piece of legislation. There will. be other le, jislation which<br />
we-would want to be ableto-getÃ± hrough;--depreciation, allowanceE;<br />
for~ primnary producera is probably one, but I am goingj to go through<br />
the whole list either this evening or tomorrow morning, and see<br />
what could desirably go th-rough before Christmas and what<br />
altntil can be delayed to an Autumn session.<br />
Question<br />
Z. Pri. me Minister, any drought legislation -that depreciation<br />
allowance wQuld help with the<br />
P riite Miniater<br />
' Well, it would In a marginal % qay, but the drought assistance is an<br />
&gt;~ n~ oingone. We hve mde vry substantial advances available to<br />
-the. States to assist in that. Over thle last three or four weeks<br />
the.-re-stooking and carry-on loans havie been extended. This is<br />
rhat we have been urging on the State8, and especially on NSW for<br />
sme time. We made the advances against our commitmtent under the<br />
frmula, available-t-tile-St-ate-a-othat--there would he no<br />
3iuati-fication for delaying or % githholding payments any more. in<br />
a sme cases I think they have been delayed.<br />

<p>Meib. 19/ 1-0/ 80 -3<br />
Question Did you ~ expect to do as well as you' have -done.<br />
4 Prime Minister<br />
I believe so, yes. This eletion and-at a. little later time<br />
I will have something more to-say about it -concentrated tauch<br />
too much on the polls in the media. That is not what the election.<br />
was -about.<br />
Question But it has gone right against the<br />
Prime -minister<br />
it has gone against the polls. That ought to be a warnIng.<br />
Not all-polls -there was one publiahed on F. day-that, w~ z~ ajaxt<br />
neaiethe mark. But, it has gone against'the others * arnd I-' alwaysbeliveoduilt<br />
, beaus I eltthepolls -were mis~ ud ing _ the<br />
mbcoudf the Australian electorate. There is a warning'. in that<br />
becusetoo much discussion about the polls that hides the<br />
issue3 and. it s in'fact the is auia-th at -arxne port ant-Jeas ues<br />
pk are much more important than whether I or M4r. { fayden deliver a:<br />
speech well or deliver it badly. That might have ;. an Impact oii<br />
soirie people, but what is going to affect peoplr's lives aiid the<br />
prosperity and well-being of Aus tral ia is In fact the -actual issuels.<br />
They received remarliably little coverage once th 61c peeches<br />
themselves were out of the way.<br />
Question . the lesson$ that you have learnt front this election c; mpaign,<br />
and losing, apparently, half your majority.<br />
Prime* Minisater<br />
Well, the numbers have stood up very well in nearly every State<br />
other than Victoria. . There were some particular reasons in<br />
Queensland which there are no need to go into now. But -there.~<br />
a very clear message there. But that is a Gueens1-zind message'<br />
U ~ are going to have to look into the s tiTon i iEriav~<br />
closely indeed. But apart. from Victoria the numbers have.-to<br />
very well. The other meaeage that people need to -undrstAndis -that,<br />
thie real movement in votes in this election is: from Democrat to<br />
Labor, -Australian Democrat -to Labor. -The-AusgtraIlian'. DRnioAtsa<br />
have in fact polled rather badly, much worse than, I am suethey<br />
would have wanted. . In most-areas the actual Liberal vrote has std-:<br />
up pretty well. nut obviously in the af termath of an eiection yo<br />
examine all of these things as a matter of routine and -see what<br />
lessons you ought to draw out OE it--for tefutr----<br />
Question<br />
While your Party has won sir, do you'. think you have wan-as ' a'<br />
leader? </p>
<p>Prime MiTat ' r.<br />
. Apart from Sir Robert Menzies, I think I am the only person<br />
. who* has. carried this Party to three successive victories at the<br />
Quiestion On: the ote-hand, do you think Mr. Hayden,: because he<br />
picked'up saa-ts.. ea-o---inr-s leaaer?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Trhe Austra1ian Labor-Party has lost. the election.<br />
-wha. do you think of;: their promne<br />
Prime'Minister Thgy . have put up a redoubtable eight.<br />
' OldI ask you on isstie -that of taxation -Eric Pisstron<br />
fromthe Australian Taxpayer's' Atssociation odysid he had<br />
-ittformnation that the Goeretwould now introduce a value -added'<br />
twk. Do0 yotr-Ime anY-oMTert-on -that?<br />
. Well: if he has, Mr. Risstron has informnation that I do not have.<br />
1I. have said I have nothing to adcl to whiat John Howard had eaid<br />
-on the subject about IS znonth5 ago.<br />
Ii~. -Question-'<br />
Will:_ you not introduce a value addedl tax at any stage?<br />

QUEStion,<br />
-Prim ' Xiinlster., you referzred to your results in Victoria, Do you<br />
hink -the victoiriacnmalienevr~ lr<br />
Nlo. I thinkAÃ± it oeryo~ a~ JO~ n in a pa)-ticulat-direction.<br />
would just say that it needs examination.<br />

<p>S Meb.' 19/ 10/ 80 5<br />
Question There will be a post mortem inVictoria<br />
Prime Minister<br />
After every election, Aust alia-wide,~ you. have_ an_ exaznination<br />
to see what you need to learn: fromnit. There is nothin. g new<br />
in that.<br />
II would just like to repeat something that I said last night<br />
on national television, and that is to thank all those people who<br />
have supported the Government Parties either' by their vote or<br />
by working actively for the Government and-the-return of-the<br />
Government. I do feel very strongly for those supporters of the<br />
Government who have lost their seats, because there have been some<br />
very good people amongst them. I hope they will come back into<br />
-the political arena at some point in the future, I would also<br />
want to repeat that our purpose is to govern for all the people<br />
of this nation, and not just those who might happen to vote<br />
Liberal or. National Party, That i s--ur obje-tive-and one-which<br />
we will seek to discharge as well as we possibly can.<br />
The-other thing which I did not say last night, which . I1s hould<br />
Shavesaid last night;:-I do not think I would have been able to<br />
carry the fight on in the way in which it did, and to a successful<br />
concltsion, if it was not for the very particular support aTd help<br />
of Tamie through the campaign and indeed, not ust during campaig,<br />
right throughout my political life And I should have said that<br />
Question Do you think Sir Billy is going tongat back in?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
On: the last figures I saw last night, yes.<br />
I Question<br />
Very -close, isn't it?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Very-close. But on the last figures I saw last night he would<br />
be-but..'. again, when it is as close as that you have got to wait<br />
until all the votes are counted and-for the-absert votes,-the<br />
postal votes,<br />
* 1i C cT </p>
<p>Meib. 19/ 3.0/ 80 6<br />
Question -Anb~ dy-oufeel particularly sad to have lost?<br />
Primte Mirnirter<br />
Year but I think it is invidious to bring out cornparisona.<br />
Prime Minister, the si. ze of the Ministry -youtve got a 27 men<br />
Ministry at the moment. Can we expect that to be reviewed downwards?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
* I . tbink 3-t is too early to start speculating or making decisions<br />
about that. Obviously again, as one would expect after an<br />
election, you talk with your own collJeagues about these things.<br />
What is more Important than the size of the Ministry is the size<br />
of the Public Serice as a whole.<br />
Question -PM, when are you going to come to Canberra, ( Inaudible) at the farm. 7<br />
Prime iiiater<br />
I wi~ ll probably go to-the farm tomorrow morning for a couple of<br />
days. But there are certh-in things I will be putting in traill<br />
____ onight-or tomorrow~ miorning as I indicated earlier, 5o that for, the<br />
I legislation we would want to introduce in that group session,<br />
the drafting . nrutoscan be given so that it can be ready<br />
Question<br />
-Wht-r~ you looking at sir, end of November?<br />
Prime minister<br />
.1 would thik. probably the last week, in November or the f irst<br />
I week-In Decemnber, but---again, that wIl]. hav'/ e to be firially determined<br />
I af ter I have discussed it with my colleagues. </p>
