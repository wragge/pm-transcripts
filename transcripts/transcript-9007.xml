TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP RAAF FAIRBAIRN, 20 OCTOBER, 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Mr Keating, are you leaving on a good note?<br />
PM: Yes, I think so. I think we will see the Bucget to bed this week, largely,<br />
in terms of its aggregates, intact which will be good for now and good<br />
for the next few years as the recovery whi,. h is now coming through,<br />
strongly comes through. That's when wewant the Budget deficit<br />
coming down, and that's why the Budget i: 3 going to be good for the<br />
place. And I think the nation is entitled to feel good about Mabo. I<br />
think it proves that even diverse interests can be handled well, and<br />
that the country is capable of doing good things.<br />
J: Prime Minister, do you think you will have to do some more deals with<br />
the Greens to get Mabo legislation through the Senate?<br />
PM: I don't think so. I think they are very supportive of the general thrust of<br />
Mabo.<br />
J: Have you got anything to say to Mr Court today? I believe a<br />
breakthrough didn't eventuate in Melbourne today.<br />
PM: We weren't hoping for one. He was only, I think, coming to tell us what<br />
he thought his points of objection were. Eut again, he has got to<br />
consider his position, I think; that is: how does he handle now the<br />
reality of Mabo, particularly when other co'nservative States are sort of<br />
endorsing the general principles in the Co'mmonwealth's draft<br />
legislation.<br />
J: What do you see as the key issues of the Cyprus meeting? </p>
<p>PM: Well, I think, it's that there will always be generally attention to<br />
international events and I expect that we will also have a perspective<br />
on things in the African continent from th, 3 African members,<br />
particularly South Africa, but it is a very mixed agenda.<br />
J: Do you foresee any comment at all regarding a republic over there, or<br />
have you already said your piece on that?<br />
PM: No, I don't. But I will have a chance to see Prime Minister John Major<br />
and Prime Minister Mahathir, of Malaysia, and some other leaders as<br />
well.<br />
J: How much will you be pressing Dr Mahal: hir on the APEC issue?<br />
PM: It is not a matter of pressing him. I think we all have common interests<br />
and it is just a matter of understanding what each person, or each<br />
country's position is.<br />
Thank you. </p>
