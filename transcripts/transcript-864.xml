HON.<br />SIR ROBERT PINZIES OVER ABC NAIIONAL STATIONS<br />AT 8 P.* 11. ON TUESHiLY, NOVEMBER 26, 1963.<br />D E F E 11 C E<br />The purpose of a foreign policy is to enter into<br />arrangements for friendship and the common defence of freedom<br />and security; to keep the peace without surrender of vital<br />principles, without appeasement or retreat.<br />In this world, bedevilled by governments which use<br />threats of violence defence has for democratic countries,<br />ceased to be a purely local affair. Australian defence cannot<br />be secured by coastline conceptions. Here, Labour policies are<br />dangerous. The Leader of the Opposition, struggling to hold a<br />chance 1961 victory in Cowper, normally a Country Party stronghold<br />said, at Grafton, that he would station portion of a<br />battle-group of the Australian Regular Army at or near Gre ftonl<br />His advice on this matter was not military. If such<br />promises wore pursued in all doubtf'ul seats, the whole concept of<br />Australian military preparations would be destroyed.<br />Our policy is based upon two considerations. First,<br />we must equip ourselves for close co-operation with our allies<br />in this part of the world, where dangers are groat, and common<br />action is essential, We must have their help in times of<br />difficulty, and they must have ours. To prepare to defend<br />Australia purely on Australian territory, would assume that our<br />allies had been defeated.<br />The second consideration is that, having regard to<br />the first, we should create and equip for ces, quickly a~ tailable,<br />possessed of great fire power and rapid mobility, and of the<br />highest quality. This is why wre are creating a navy which, while within<br />our capacity will be modern, mobile and effective; with the<br />missile-bearing destroyers, submarines, carriers, aircraft, and<br />escort vessels. I<br />In the Army, we aim at high training, modern equipment,<br />adequate air support, with a first-class scientific backing.<br />In the Air Force, we already have the best transport<br />planes in the world, the Mirage fighter, the best in the world<br />and a Bomber replacement for the Canberra which, at a relatively<br />early date, will give us, in world terms, unsurpassed strike and<br />reconnaissance power,<br />Wie cannot equal the great powers. But we can aim at<br />possessing forces of the highest quality and capable of co-operating<br />effectively with our friends.<br />No party political considerations can be allowed to<br />stand in the -jay of giving effect to this realistic policy.<br />You will decide, for a vital period of time whether<br />you support this concept, and this essential national policy.</p>
