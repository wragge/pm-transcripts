FOR PRESS No. 6/ 1964<br />
Statement by the MISSION TO KUALA LUiJPUR<br />
Prime Minister_, tho Rt. Hon.<br />
Menzi os Sir Robert<br />
I indicated in my statement after the Cabinet<br />
meeting of January 16 that the Government was consulting<br />
with the Malaysian Government to seo what it could do to<br />
contribute to the development of Malaysia's own defence<br />
effort. Pursuant to this, the Cabinet today gave further<br />
consideration to the question of assistance to Malaysia in<br />
the development and expansion of its own forces.<br />
The Government has been given to understand by<br />
the Malaysian authorities that certain assistance in the<br />
form of material and training would be useful, and accordingly<br />
it is proposed to send a mission to Kuala Lumpur to discuss<br />
and assess what items, within Australia's capacity to supply,<br />
may be needed.<br />
