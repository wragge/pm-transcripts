TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW ON ABC PM WITH MAXINE MCKEW<br />
CANBERRA, 2 JUNE 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Prime Minister thank you for coming in.<br />
PM: Good Maxine.<br />
MM2: How much money, your most optimistic figure, how<br />
much money will a merged _ Qantas Australian, attract<br />
do you think?<br />
PM: I think the net proceeds for the Budget will be<br />
about $ 1 billion, now that is Important and it's<br />
quite important, but I think the most important<br />
thing is that it is the best result for Australian<br />
aviation. That is, Qantas has long lacked the<br />
capacity of operating as a full airline by not<br />
having a domestic carrier, a domestic compacity. It<br />
would have that by the Government'Is decision today<br />
to acquire Australian Airlines, and the Government<br />
will now approa'ch the . Labor Party in its federal<br />
structure for the sale of 100 per cent of the merged<br />
entity. But the synergy, so-called, much over the<br />
years termed, but the benefits and efficiencies that<br />
could arise from the operation of the two companies<br />
is quite substantial and as a result of the change<br />
Qantas will pay the Budget $ 400 million for the<br />
purchase of Australian Airlines which is much more<br />
then we would have been offered at sale.<br />
MM4: I was Just going to ask you that. Has the trade<br />
sale process revealed that Australian by itself<br />
would have attracted very little?<br />
PM: For the reeson that the last couple of years have<br />
been very tad in terms of earnings they have run<br />
losses becauise of the pilot strike in 1990, in 1991<br />
Australian had the problem of the very heavy<br />
discounts from Compass, discounting is still on,<br />
profits are low, and I think probably the price<br />
would have been too low, it would have been selling </p>
<p>have done another one today in the national<br />
interest.<br />
MM: Just one other question, Prime Minister, if I can<br />
about that $ 1 billion, you have announced ajqt<br />
summit today to look at you~ th unemployment. Would,<br />
for iristance, you consider pouring some of that<br />
money into programs for young people?<br />
PM: Well it may not be the money that comes from there,<br />
but that is certainly a Budgetary option in the<br />
course of the Budget preparation.<br />
MM: To what extent has this course of action been forced<br />
on you by the realities of that $ 9 billion deficit?<br />
PM: Not at all. What's happened to us is that we have<br />
reached a stage in the sale process where we had,<br />
first of all, the exploratory processes, then<br />
indicative bids. The indicative bids have now been<br />
lodged and the Government would have to then embark<br />
on what's called a due diligence of the bidders<br />
looking through the assets and then confirmed bids.<br />
We are at that point of decision, that's what has<br />
brought us here.<br />
MM: But Ralph Willis has been promoting this concept of<br />
a merger for some years. Why has it taken until now<br />
to get to this point?<br />
PM: I don't really believe that Australian and Qantas,<br />
even though Qantas might have wanted Australian, I<br />
am not sure Australian wanted Qantas. I think it<br />
probably does now, and I think that is part of the<br />
reason, but the efficiency gains, the since socalled<br />
synergies, are so apparent that now it is the<br />
obvious and sensible thing to do. And of course<br />
part of this is the Government is now going to<br />
introduce legislation this week to set-up a<br />
Commnission to allocate international routes to a<br />
second carrier, and that carrier in the first<br />
instance will be Ansett Airlines. So we will be<br />
developing an international market from Australia,<br />
so the sole designated carrier will not be Qantas.<br />
In that case it makes sense to have Qantas and<br />
Australian together and have then juxtaposed against<br />
that, Ansett Airlines as a domestic carrier but with<br />
international routes. So it becomes an<br />
international carrier as well. And of course that<br />
will operate from the city of Melbourne.<br />
MM: You said today to your Press Conference that this<br />
had been a painful decision, which would indicate<br />
that if you had a choice you wouldn't be selling the<br />
family silver?<br />
PM: Painful for some, not for me. </p>
<p>MM: Does the rest of the Party appreciate the synergies<br />
that you are talking about?<br />
PM: I think so. A lot of people in the Labor Party have<br />
had the warm inner glow about Qantas and they can<br />
get dewy-eyed talking about some of these public<br />
authorities, but nobody will put any money into<br />
them. On the Left, the Right, or the Centre, no one<br />
will commit a budgetary dollar to them, because they<br />
always have their social and infrastructure programs<br />
ahead of them. Qantas is 90 per cent debt and<br />
per cent equity, it has limped along with Government<br />
guarantees and not enough capital. And you will get<br />
lots of expressions of interests at Labor Party<br />
Conferences f or it, but no one really cares about<br />
it.<br />
MM: What do you think the mood is beyond the Caucus,<br />
have you any concept of that?<br />
PM: I think a lot of Labor Party members would think we<br />
shouldn't sell these, but if you say to them, well<br />
look we have got high unemployment, we ought to be<br />
looking at labour market programs and other<br />
structural changes in the economy, but look we need<br />
$ 1 billion to recapitalise Australian and Qantas.<br />
Will we put it there? They say no, no. I mean a<br />
lot of people pass a motion at the State Conference<br />
but they wouldn't commit a discretionary dollar to<br />
it. Well we can't take that approach, I mean,<br />
Qantas can't limp along in this way. If we are<br />
going to be part of the Asia-Pacific airline market,<br />
it's got to be set up properly and this is the best<br />
way. And of course by a public float all<br />
Australians get a crack at this. I mean in a sense<br />
its not just Government ownership it's private<br />
ownership by the men and women of Australia.<br />
MM: You are faced at the moment of course with the fact<br />
that your policy takes you beyond the limits of<br />
current party policy, is the most likely resolution<br />
at this stage a postal ballot of all delegates?<br />
PM: I don't know, but due process demands that we have<br />
the Labor Party's authority to go beyond the<br />
conference set limits. And we've done that. We did<br />
that, in the first instance, two years ago when this<br />
was last considered as you say. I mean I did it<br />
when I was Treasurer with foreign banks, when we<br />
took it to the Labor Party Conference here in<br />
Canberra.<br />
MM: What you're saying that the National Executive could<br />
perhaps make a recommendation to the next Special<br />
Conference?<br />
PM: The national organs of the Party have got to decide<br />
how best to handle this, but the Government is not </p>
<p>trying to side step them. It understands that due<br />
process is important particularly where high policy<br />
is concerned.<br />
MM: Prime Minister just a few more details, would you be<br />
happy for say a single international carrier to buy<br />
the full 35 per cent of voting equity that is<br />
available?<br />
PM: That's a matter, I think, of who the carrier is and<br />
what Qantas would see for itself in that, or whether<br />
it would be advantaged by a couple of carriers.<br />
From a theoretical point of view it wouldn't worry<br />
me. It may well suite Qantas to tie up with a large<br />
European carrier for instance like British Airways<br />
or a regional carrier like Singapore. Whatever can<br />
best advantage it, I think is the important thing.<br />
And of course, with private stock in the company,<br />
when people have got their own dollars on the line<br />
rather than what they see are the quiet dollars of<br />
the Commonwealth, they'll be voting them much more<br />
carefully.<br />
MM: What are the implications of a merger in terms of<br />
retrenchments?<br />
PM: None at this stage because we are not merging the<br />
companies in that sense. We are merging them but in<br />
a technical sense it will be Qantas acquiring the<br />
stock of Australian Airlines. So Australian<br />
Airlines will still trade as Australian Airlines and<br />
operate as a business.<br />
MM: Sure, but what we've already seen though, in say the<br />
telecommunications area with the new AOTC, they will<br />
be looking at a much reduced work force, and that's<br />
the trade of f for a more efficient organisation<br />
isn't it?<br />
PM: But that is already happening with Qantas. Qantas<br />
has already lost three thousand employees just to be<br />
more efficient. You can never stop efficiency<br />
gains. But this is not a pure merger in that sense.<br />
You're seeing now Telecom and OTC put together in a<br />
merger, it's not just simply Telecom owning OTC, but<br />
that is exactly what the situation is here. Qantas<br />
will actually own Australian Airlines, they still<br />
remain two separate entities for the time being.<br />
MM: one question about Ansett, you've already talked<br />
about them as the second international carrier,<br />
surely they will have to sell down their level of<br />
foreign ownership to 35 per cent. At the moment<br />
Rupert Murdoch, a foreigner, has 50 per cent.<br />
PM: No, I think under the Foreign Takeovers Act,<br />
Newslimited is still classified as an Australian </p>
<p>company because of the level of Australian<br />
ownership.<br />
MM: The proprietor though is not an Australian citizen.<br />
PM: No, but he doesn't own most of the stock. I think<br />
he is now down to 32 or 33 per cent. That is, the<br />
Murdoch interests and even many of those are<br />
Australian, such as his mother, his family. So one<br />
couldn't be certain that's true. Can I say that the<br />
purity squads who live in the broad sheet newspapers<br />
have been alleging the Labor government is sort of<br />
biased in favour of Ansett. They can't say that<br />
now. They can't say that about this position.<br />
MM: Prime Minister, what about the process, I gather<br />
there were some comments in the Caucus this morning<br />
about you're reversal of the usual process, if I can<br />
put it like that going on national television<br />
first to announce the policy then going to Cabinet<br />
and then to Caucus.<br />
PM: Well if one were to go to the Caucus, Caucus<br />
Committees here we all live in the one building,<br />
you live in the same building as the Caucus, you<br />
know members of the Caucus, the Caucus Committees<br />
leak, people know when the meet, there are<br />
discussions later. There is no advantage for the<br />
Government in me going to the Caucus and having a<br />
discussion and that being trafficked around the<br />
corridors.<br />
MM: So is this the way it is going to be in the future?<br />
PM: The Government's advantage is at having been told<br />
Remember this, I made those statements on last<br />
Sunday after weeks of consultation with Bob Collins,<br />
Ralph Willis, before that when Graham Richardson was<br />
in his ministerial chair.<br />
MM: Would you still have taken the same tack had Graham<br />
Richardson still been Minister?<br />
PM: Again, Graham and I never got down to some of the<br />
details which we have now.<br />
MM: Except you say you had been working on this for<br />
weeks, and a couple of weeks ago Graham Richardson<br />
was still the Minister.<br />
PM: Yes, but in terms of airline policy Bob Collins had<br />
it as Minister for Aviation even though Graham was a<br />
portfolio minister. Graham basically had pay<br />
television and I really hadn't settled that with<br />
him. But Ralph Willis, Bob Collins, myself, John<br />
Dawkins and our Departments have been discussing<br />
this now for some weeks so I made my statements on<br />
Sunday after a long process of discussion. We then </p>
<p>took it to the Caucus Committee, then to the Cabinet<br />
and then to the full Caucus and beyond that to the<br />
Labor Party. So due process will be observed.<br />
MM: And in doing so though, you challenged the Party<br />
haven't you, you've taken it to the brink and said<br />
look you have just got to face these realities?<br />
PM: We are the custodians of Labor's fortunes and the<br />
public purse for the moment, and you'Ive got to do<br />
what you think is right by the institutions, and<br />
also by public policy, and also do it with a Labor<br />
heart. But it doesn't mean that you can change<br />
these things without rolling the dice. I mean I<br />
don't ever mind rolling the dice.<br />
MM2: If you don't mind rolling the dice it does raise the<br />
question, I suppose, of why you selectively<br />
challenge. I mean you were prepared to challenge on<br />
big policy issues like this, why though weren't you<br />
prepared to say, intervene in the ministerial<br />
process last week?<br />
PM: Because I just don't think it was proper.<br />
MM: Do you think we now have the best system, the<br />
Government has the best system for selecting the<br />
best talent for the Ministry?<br />
PM: There's not much point in me debating it, it's not a<br />
point that I want to be wasting time on. The fact<br />
is I've got more important things to expend my<br />
energies on than running a selection system from my<br />
office.<br />
MM: But it's a question of the best team to run the<br />
country, what could be more important than that?<br />
PM: The best people I believe that were on offer when<br />
this Government came was selected to be in Cabinet<br />
and the Ministry and there has been a lot of change<br />
since. There's only nine of the twenty seven<br />
original ministers from 1983 now there.<br />
MM: Are you really saying you wouldn't prefer to have<br />
Senator Bob McMullan in the Ministry?<br />
PM: There is no point in me debating personalities,<br />
factions, I know the ABC loves these things and so<br />
does the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and all<br />
these navel gazers good on them.<br />
MM: Well finally Prime Minister, you expressed<br />
frustration yet again today with the Opposition for<br />
not asking any questions about either aviation or<br />
communications, but surely they are going to pursue<br />
this course until you agree to either a judicial<br />
inquiry which is what has been passed </p>
<p>PM: Why should I take any notice of them. Richardson<br />
has done nothing improper, but becaus6eewasunguardedly<br />
associated with this person and we knew<br />
this would go on, he resigned. What moral basis<br />
does the Opposition have to pursue this and what<br />
moral basis do journalists have in pursuing it for<br />
the Opposition? Now the truth is John Hewson has no<br />
views, he's got a GST tax. What the last two days<br />
have shown in Question Time we've had the National<br />
Accounts out today which shows the economy in<br />
recovery now for the third quarter, great news for<br />
Australians, low inflation, low current account<br />
deficit, higher profits. Not one question, not one<br />
question about aviation, not on question about<br />
telecommunications, not one question about technical<br />
and further education, all the issues of the week.<br />
MM: Well they're not playing to your agenda they're<br />
playing their own.<br />
PM: Yes, but they are playing to the low grade agenda.<br />
MM: And that's surely a legitimate political strategy.<br />
PM: As long as people understand they're playing to the<br />
base agenda. It's just another version of ' Reds<br />
under beds', ' The Chinese coming to get us in their<br />
sampans', old Senator Currack's ' Red arrows from<br />
China' when he used to run the party, I mean it's<br />
the same stuff. These people are always bereft of<br />
any good instincts in public policy or the public<br />
good.<br />
MM: Prime Minister, it maybe a base agenda but surely<br />
politically it is going to continue to dog you until<br />
there is some sort of agreement to either a Senate<br />
or judicial enquiry?<br />
PM: Why should it?<br />
MM: Because as we saw today, and as we saw yesterday in<br />
the Senate and in the House of Representatives,<br />
question after question.<br />
PM: If they persist, regardless of any moral basis for<br />
the questions we should then say oh well this is<br />
going to persist therefore we should let the<br />
Opposition have an enquiry. Look, we'll stand them<br />
right up on this and you shouldn't be helping them,<br />
nobody should be helping them. The issue has<br />
nothing going for it and the public are entitled to<br />
high policy, good policy and they can see Dr Hewson<br />
for what he's worth a shallow character who has<br />
drifted into politics from a merchant bank and<br />
outside of a computer driven model developed by some<br />
accountancy firm with a GST what has he got to say<br />
about trade training, young people, about TAFE, </p>
<p>about transport, about infrastructure nothing,<br />
what is it? He is now telling us now we should not<br />
let unions negotiate with employers. The Burnie<br />
dispute is what we would see across the whole<br />
country, the country lit up in one dispute after<br />
another under the industrial relations policy he<br />
has. He wants to explode the wage system and<br />
inflation rate with a crazy industrial relations<br />
policy while introducing a GST and what's his<br />
literature talking about frightening old ladies by<br />
saying people are going to hand hand-guns to them,<br />
putting pamphlets in letter boxes saying you're not<br />
going to be safe unless there is a GST. How is the<br />
GST on your Weetbix going to stop someone marching<br />
through your front door?<br />
MM: Prime Minister, we'll have to end it there. Thank<br />
you very much for joining us this evening.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
ENDS </p>
