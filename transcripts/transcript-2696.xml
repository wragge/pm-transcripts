FOR PRESS PM's 88/ 1972<br />
DOCTORS FEES<br />
Statement _ by te Prime ! inista%.. r, the IRt Hon. William 10c!, ahorn, CH,. MP.<br />
This afternoon i had a meeting with the President of the A. M. A.,<br />
Dr. J. G. Johnson. Dr. Johnson was ac ! rompanied by Dr. L. L. Wilson, the<br />
Treasurer of the and by Dr. ES. Stuclk-ev, the Secretary-General.<br />
The A. M. A. reoresentatives caxv~ to see me at my rcqueast. I had<br />
asked them to Canberra on receint of a report from the 1-iiister for<br />
Health, Sir Kenneth Anderson, yesterday, that th' Feconomic Ldvisnry<br />
Committee of the A. M. A. was conteinnilat--ng reco=. oending to the Federal<br />
Council that fees for gonoral oractitioner consultations and home<br />
visits and for some other scrvicDs might be increased shortly.<br />
The fovernment was concernod to know more about the A. M. A.' s<br />
proposals because the arrangement betweeon the Gcvernment and the<br />
A. M. A. is that, unless tllare were extraordinary move-. ments in national<br />
economic indices, the next general fe increas..: . qculd not be made<br />
before 1 July 1973, whichi is the end of the current two yearly period<br />
for fee reviews.<br />
The last general practitioner feec adjustment made through the<br />
A. M. A.' s normal two-yearly fee review arrangements took: place from 1<br />
July 1971. The recommendation made from that date was for a fee<br />
increase of 15% in N. S. W. ( wit: h minor variations in other states) on<br />
the fees being charged as at I July 19% cO.<br />
A dispute developed earlier this year regarding the appropriate<br />
baseline for N. S. W. general practitioncr consultation and visit fees.<br />
This led the Government teo establish, in Iqarch of this year, a judicial<br />
enquiry on the subject of medical. fces for these services in N. S. W.<br />
Ifr Justice Mason, who conducted the Enquiry, reported Ito the<br />
Government in May and, as a rosult, consultation fees and benefits were<br />
increased in all States from 1 July 1972. </p>
<p>Besides putting into-effect Mr Justice Mason's recommendation<br />
for N. S. W., this decision of the Government represented an increase of<br />
about 6% to general practitioner fees for consultations and home<br />
visits for all other States from 1 July 1972.<br />
For some time past the A.. k and the Department of Health have<br />
been developing a consultative procedure under which adjustments to<br />
common fees and bene-fits could be determined equitably and by agreement<br />
between tha parties at intervals of two years.<br />
It was in the course of these consultative procedural discussions<br />
between A. M. A. officers and representatives of the Department of Health<br />
that it came to the notice of the Government that the A. M. A. was<br />
contemplating an increase in fees before the expiration of the two-year<br />
period, The Governmcint's position is clear. It believes that the<br />
two-year agreement should run its course before any adjustments are<br />
made unless there have been some quite exceptional developments which<br />
would justify a departure from the timing of the agreed review.<br />
The A. M. A. representatives put it to me that national economic<br />
indices had moved upwards at an abnormally high rate since December<br />
1970. I told them that the movements in the indices could ' not properly<br />
justify a departure from what had been agreed.<br />
The A. M. A. representatives said that the decision on thi s matter<br />
would be one for their Federal Council, which is scheduledto meet at the<br />
weekend. I stated plainly to them that while the Government was willing<br />
to continue to participate in consultative procedures, its officers would<br />
not be permitted to enter into commitments with the A. M. A. on the basis<br />
of claims which could not be fully justified. I also indicated that<br />
action on the line mentioned would be contrary to the interests of the<br />
medical profession and would not be acceptable to the public.<br />
The A. M. A. representatives will be in touch with the Minister for<br />
Health after the Federal Council's weekend meeting and the Government<br />
will then consider the situation further.<br />
