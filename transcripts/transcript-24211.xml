    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government will support productivity and jobs growth in Tasmania by investing $60Â million in Tasmanian Irrigationâs Tranche II scheme.</p>
<p>The Tranche II Scheme will generate over 150 direct full-time jobs, on top of the 7,000 new jobs created since the Hodgman Liberal Government was elected. Together, the Commonwealth and Tasmanian Governments are generating the local jobs that will build Tasmaniaâs future prosperity.</p>
<p>The Tranche II scheme will deliver approximately 40,000 additional megalitres of water to landholders and communities throughout Tasmania. Water will be provided at 95 per cent reliability to irrigators in the areas where the projects are located and benefit the irrigators and businesses within the regions. The Tranche II scheme will support horticultural enterprises including viticulture, dairy, grazing, irrigated cropping, walnut enterprises, and provide secure supply of drinking water for the town of Bothwell, which ran out of water during the most recent drought.Â </p>
<p>The Tasmanian Government has identified the Scottsdale, North Esk, Southern Highlands, Circular Head and Swan Valley Irrigation projects to be in the Tranche II scheme. All projects are subject to adequate demand for water from private investors and an approved business case. The projects will be managed by Tasmanian Irrigation Pty Ltd.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government is providing two dollars for every dollar contributed by the Tasmanian Government. Private investors have also shown a strong commitment to these Schemes by purchasing water rights and making substantial on-farm investments. This investment from the Commonwealth Government provides confidence for the Tasmanian Government and Tasmanian Irrigation to continue to develop the Tranche II projects and demonstrate each projectâs economic credentials.</p>
<p>Subject to final business cases, construction is expected to start on the Tranche II projects within 12 months.</p>
<p>The Joint Commonwealth and Tasmanian Economic Council identified the Tranche II irrigation projects as a priority for boosting the stateâs economy. The projects were also supported by the Prime Ministerâs Water Infrastructure Ministerial Working Group and have been identified as warranting Commonwealth investment in the Agriculture Competitiveness Green Paper</p>
<p>The Tranche II scheme builds on the significant funding the Commonwealth is already providing under the Economic Growth Plan for Tasmania to build productivity-enhancing infrastructure. The Government is investing $1 billion in Tasmaniaâs infrastructure, including $400 million for the Midland Highway and $38 million for the Hobart airport runway extension.</p>
<p>Local Federal MPs Andrew Nikolic (Bass), Brett Whiteley (Braddon) and Eric Hutchinson (Lyons) have been strong, persistent advocates of the Tranche II schemes in recent years. They have worked tirelessly in advocating for the interests of local Tasmanian businesses and communities who will benefit from the investment and local jobs created through the irrigation projects.</p>
<p>The Tranche II scheme will contribute toward agricultural development and stronger regional communities in Tasmania</p>
<p>The Government is committed to resetting Tasmaniaâs course to one of growth, new jobs and rising living standards.</p>
