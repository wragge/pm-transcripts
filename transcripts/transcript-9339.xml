SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
ACCEPTANCE CEREMONY FOR ANSETT AUSTRALIA'S FIRST BOEING<br />
747 AIRCRAFT, MASCOT, 29 AUGUST 1994<br />
Well, I think today's a great day for the Australian aviation industry.<br />
It's also a great day for Australia.<br />
Ansett Australia's acceptance of this, its first, Boeing 747 shows that we have<br />
truly broken the traditional distinction between domestic and international<br />
services, It also shows we have a robust internationally competitive aviation industry<br />
that delivers a quality service at a competitive price.<br />
And we've reached this milestone for two main reasons.<br />
The first derives from the Government's decision to deregul ate the aviation<br />
industry and the second derives from the way the industry, and its people,<br />
have responded.<br />
Some time ago, the Government took the view that we needed to restructure<br />
our aviation industry.<br />
We wanted competitive arrangements that would deliver significant benefits<br />
to both Australian and foreign consumers.<br />
We wanted competitive arrangements that would enable Australia to realise<br />
Its enormous tourist potential.<br />
We wanted an aviation industry ready for a new century.<br />
And that's what we've got.<br />
Since 1990, the number of domestic passengers has doubled.<br />

Domestic airfares are now 25 per cent lower in real terms.<br />
And, on a comparable basis, that makes them among the lowest in the world.<br />
There are now more carriers offering services Into and out of Australia, on<br />
more routes and city pairs, and with greater frequency, than ever before.<br />
These achievements have gone a long way to driving the growth of the<br />
Australian tourist industry an industry that last year grew at three times the<br />
world average and now accounts for 12 per cent of our total export earnings.<br />
Clearly, Ansett Australia has embraced the commercial opportunities<br />
provided by deregulation.<br />
It has expanded its services to Bali to six a week.<br />
This week, with its new 747 Spaceship, it will commence five 747 services a<br />
week to Osaka.<br />
And next week, It will commence three 747 services a week to Hong Kong.<br />
But the reform that has occurred in the industry can't just be measured in the<br />
number of new flights.<br />
Change in the industry has been anything less than " micro" for those<br />
organisations and people most directly involved.<br />
And it is individual people in organisations such as Ansett and Qantas that<br />
have given us a world class aviation service at a competitive price.<br />
You will excuse me, of course, if I make the observation how impressed I am<br />
by Ansett's new livery.<br />
The Southern Cross incorporated into the gold and set against the blue<br />
background will give the airline an unambiguously Australian face in both<br />
Australia and Asia.<br />
For mine, that's a smart move.<br />
I'm also pleased to know that the service offered to Asian consumers, who<br />
now account for one in every two of our international visitors, will be tailored<br />
specifically to their needs.<br />
After all, you can't expect to gain a good slice of the world's fastest growing<br />
market without a strong customer focus.<br />
And that's exactly what Ansett offers with its specially trained and multilingual<br />
flight attendants. </p>

All up, it's a very impressive performance.<br />
It shows an Australia serious about doing business in Asia.<br />
And it shows an Ansett Australia very much an integral part of our robust<br />
internationally competitive aviation industry.<br />
Congratulations to one and all, and long may she fly. </p>
