The Prime Minister, Mr. Fraser, has asked the Minister<br />
for the Capital Territory, Mr. Ellicott and the Premier<br />
of New South Wales to convey his deepest sympathy to<br />
those affected by the fires.<br />
Mr. Fraser also extended his best wishes to the fire<br />
fighters still in the field and expressed the hope that the<br />
situation would soon be under control.<br />
The Commonwealth will immediately join with N. S. W. on a<br />
$ 1 for $ 1 basis in meeting expenditure for the relief<br />
of personal hardship and distress, Mr. Fraser said, and<br />
the Commonwealth will provide the sare assistance to residents<br />
of the A. C. T. affected by the fires.<br />
Needless to say, the Prime Minister added, the Commonwealth<br />
stands ready to assist with men and equipment.<br />
Further proposals for relief measures will receive<br />
prompt attention. 000---</p>
