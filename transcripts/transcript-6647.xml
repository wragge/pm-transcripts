PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 14 June 1985<br />
The Commonwealth Government will meet the costs of heart<br />
and lung transplant patient Mr Les Pates.<br />
The announcement of the decision was made following discussion<br />
between the Acting Prime Minister, Mr Lionel Bowen, and the<br />
Acting Minister for Finance, Mr Chris Hurford.<br />
The decision has been reached after new information that the<br />
proposed operation, which would be conducted in Pittsburgh<br />
was no longer considered experimental by the doctors involved.<br />
It has been confirmed the operation has a success rate in<br />
excess of<br />
Mr Bowen said that given the latest information the Government<br />
believed any doubt that remained as to Mr Pates' eligibility<br />
for assistance should be resolved in his favour. He said the<br />
Government wished to take a prompt decision in Mr Pates'<br />
interest rather than let the matter drag on.<br />
He said that funds would be provided initially for Mr Pates<br />
to travel to the US for an assessment of his suitability<br />
for the operation and that, subject to that assessment being<br />
positive, further funding would be provided. </p>
