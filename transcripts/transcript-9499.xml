TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
LAUNCH OF SUE ROBINSON'S CAMPAIGN, ALP CANDIDATE FOR<br />
CANBERRA, ERINDALE LEISURE CENTRE, CANB3ERRA<br />
3 MARCH 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
It is a pleasure for me to be here with Sue Robinson, opening this campaign,<br />
because we are at at the most about a year away from the election. And<br />
let me assure you, I am going to make this the hardest year of John Howard's<br />
life I can tell you that. And that shell of an organisation they call the Liberal<br />
Party, we are going to put more stresses and strains on that creaky old thing,<br />
on that remnant of Australia's failed upper class, that organisation that<br />
thought it had it's dead hand on Australia and did for so long they will need<br />
more than a bit of political engineering when we put some stresses and<br />
strains on that thing. TFhey will need every technique they have got push<br />
polling, the lot to try and save their miserable political hides. Because, here<br />
we are John Howard he's here as the Liberal Party's third choice. John<br />
Hewson took them to a poll, lost, and Howard contested an election against<br />
him, and they said " no we don't want you" because it was only in 1989 that<br />
they defeated him for Peacock, and then they had another chance, of course,<br />
when John Hewson basically lost his way, and they knew they had to change,<br />
and so they had to think long and hard about their future. And they said " no<br />
we're not going back to the past, we can't go back to Howard, he's a man of<br />
the past, his views are of the past, his whole mindset is of another age, we've<br />
got to make a new break and go for a new team the Dream Team. Downer<br />
and Costello." But they made a conscious decision to reject him. Of course,<br />
Downer came to nothing, and they went around looking around, and they<br />
have given us John Howard because he is now the only thing they have left.<br />
And we're supposed to say " oh here he is reborn and remade". They have<br />
got to be joking.<br />
And I said in the Parliament a week or so ago, if you look at Australia now<br />
an open, competitive, confident, country, much more of an inclusive society<br />
than ever, and much more confident I think about itself I mean, we are<br />
coming to terms with our identity, coming to terms with our indigenes, finding<br />
a place in Asia, making the leap out there and you have got to say to </p>

2<br />
yourself what possible use could Australia have at this time for a man who<br />
describes himself as the most conservative leader the conservative parties<br />
have ever had. Is this the time in our history as we come to the next<br />
millennium to in the closing years of this century to say " well what we need<br />
is somebody who, in the 1 970s was comfortable with the policies in the<br />
1950s"? And he was. It's not mis-representing John Howard to say that<br />
when he was a minister between 1977 and 1983, he was looking for his guide<br />
to the Menzies years and the Menzies Cabinets, and the policies, and the<br />
views. And I notice some commentator said last week which I thought was a<br />
terribly pithy fine he said " when John Howard talks about one Australia, he<br />
means one Wollstonecraft". And he is right the Edwardian houses, and the<br />
picket fences, and the big off-street alignments, and the old trees, it's an<br />
older version of old and central Canberra. That's his view of the world.<br />
And I see him up yesterday it said it all against him he said " I'm against<br />
anything in politics that's regarded as unacceptable by the Australian<br />
community". In other words, " you tell me what you don't want, and that's what<br />
I'll give you. You lead and I'll follow". It's a bit like the republic he said<br />
" look, don't ask me about the republic ask me in 5 years time and I'll tell you<br />
what I think about it. If I think the Australian people believe there should be a<br />
change, then I will maybe modify my position" it is really code for " if that<br />
Paul Keating will get out there and lead them and convince them, I might<br />
follow. If he will lead, I will follow"'. It's just another version of the same thing<br />
against anything in politics that is regarded as unacceptable". So, " if<br />
push polling is unacceptable even though I tried it on if it's unacceptable, I<br />
will give it away. If the community don't believe there ought to be a racial<br />
basis in the selection of migrynts, I'll give that up. If they think our industrial<br />
relations policy is too hot, I'll give that away, too". In other words, " I'll dovetail<br />
in I won't lead, I will follow".<br />
Now, yesterday was an instructive day about Australian politics. We are in<br />
the Labor Party because we believe in things, and we get things done. We<br />
have a touch with the society, I mean Sue described herself correctly as<br />
somebody who likes people, who talks to people, is of the community, talks to<br />
the community she is, as a Labor person, is and should be. We are a Party<br />
that is in touch with the community. This is not true of the Coalition. The<br />
Coalition has got no community sense. John Hewson walked out of that<br />
Parliament the other day is he going to go away with any sense of sodality<br />
with the Liberal Party? Any sense of longevity of his sort-of comradeship with<br />
them? Well of course not. They just drift into the thing like a sort of a minor<br />
business organisation, and they drift out of it again. In other words, there is<br />
only one real political party in this country, and it is the Australian Labor<br />
Party. That's right the other thing is an organisation that picks up the non-<br />
Labor party, the non-Labor forces. that's how they always used to describe<br />
themselves the non-Labor party. Always in the negative they know what<br />
they are against, not sure what they are for. Or, as Arthur Calwell said' " the<br />
Labor Party is a party of conviction, the others are parties of convenience".<br />
And, here they are, now out of office for a very long period of time, no sense<br />
of binding, no sense of cohesion, no touch with the community, and definitely </p>
<p>ILL 3<br />
not a national party. Isn't it ironic, here's John Howard wandering around<br />
Canberra in the shopping centre trying to address himself as a national<br />
leader, but he leads a party which is not a national party. It is a party of six<br />
state complexions. And when they are always talking and every one of<br />
them does the same a new deal for the States means a bad deal for the<br />
nation. That's the flip side of that coin a new deal for the States is just code<br />
for saying a bad deal for the nation for the federation. And then we get all<br />
this stuff federation was a set of arrangements to protect the States, It was<br />
no such thing federation was an act of creation of the nation. That's what it<br />
was. And this notion that we then fracture a nation of 18 million who have<br />
been given the great oood fortune of inhipritinOi A crntinont of giving uo thio<br />
unique place in the world, as one nation in a continent, to ourselves they<br />
said " oh no we are not going to take that advantage we will slice it up like<br />
a big sponge cake you know, cut it into 6 pieces, and they will all have their<br />
taxing powers, and'they will all run their provincial governments" why?<br />
Because they know the national character of the country, and the national<br />
parliament, moves the common weal forward moves the society on and<br />
that's what they are against. They are against these progressive changes<br />
that's why they describe themselves as conservatives, and John Howard an<br />
arch-conservative. So, it is ironic that here they are in the national capital<br />
the seat of the nation campaigning for an important constituency, when their<br />
policy is basically to try and fracture the place, and hand back powers to the<br />
States, and remove that sense of nation, which we have all fought for, and<br />
which we now have. And of course Canberra. if you look at the difference<br />
with their icon Menzies who never gave taxing powers back to the States<br />
and thought that one of his achievements was the building of Canberra this<br />
mob actually want to smash Canberra. And if people think now they are<br />
running through a sort of a d~ in-property cycle, well they have seen nothing<br />
yet if the Liberals got hold of the national Parliament they would flatten this<br />
place like a flap-jack. By the time they hop into the public service, and push<br />
people onto individual wage contracts, and then cut the numbers, and cut the<br />
Government spending while this is a more complex economy than it used to<br />
be, and it has got now a private sector of some substance, give the public<br />
sector a very large hit and the ricochet through this community I think<br />
would be very obvious.<br />
And just don't ask John Howard what he might do, look at what he did.<br />
Between 1977 and 1983, the only building in this city under construction was<br />
Parliament House. The construction sector was absolutely dead dormant.<br />
There was no building, the housing sector had dried up, the business<br />
community was shrivelling away and moving back to Sydney and Melbourne<br />
this is what they did between 1977 and 1983. Now, this Government is a<br />
growth government we believe in growth. And that growth has, in a very full<br />
measure in the nation, attached itself to the ACT. And over these years<br />
1983 til now there has been a lot of growth in the ACT, a lot of employment<br />
growth, and a lot of prosperity and that is what this Government will<br />
continue to provide. We are sort of going through a reality by-pass at the<br />
moment we have got 5.5% GOP growth, and 2.5% inflation. But you have<br />
these little pumped up tories running around saying " oh, the mess in the<br />
economy" a mess? 5.5% growth and 2.5% inflation they have never seen<br />
. Mar .95 17: 21 No .013 P. 03' 1 </p>
<p>TEL 3. Mar .95 17 : 21 No. t) 13 P .04,' 1<br />
4<br />
numbers like that in their history. 4.5% productivity growth, 500,000 jobs<br />
since the last election, 4% employment growth a year we are the fastest<br />
growing country in terms of employment in the Western world. In terms of<br />
growth and inflation, we are on the top of the league table of the 21 member<br />
states of the OECD. But, all this doom-saying they go around with John<br />
Hewson was telling us at the end of the last election campaign that we were<br />
going into a double-dip recession, then a depression. And John Howard<br />
endorsed his remarks about the recession.<br />
And here we are now growing as we have been so strongly, and the<br />
challenge for us is to make this growth sustainable and to keep inflation in<br />
its place, after having put it there after so much effort and we all know what<br />
that's about it's about wages, it's about having a relationship with the trade<br />
unions, it's about our Accord, it's about our whole co-operative model these<br />
are the things we can do and these are things which are now happening. But<br />
the Current Account Deficit is high for the moment it is absolutely laden with<br />
capital goods. We are a country of 18 million we don't produce capital<br />
goods, we don't produce mainframe computers, we don't produce the big<br />
pneumatic or digitally operated machine tools which come from countries like<br />
the United States and Germany, so whenever we start adding to that capital<br />
stock after a few years of paucity of investment, of course this will reflect in<br />
the Current Account. But are we going to build our capacity and keep on<br />
growing, or do we lay dead in the water? So they are saying " oh hang on,<br />
let's chop that off", and we say " all right, chop it off but you chop off all the<br />
equipment that lets you fight the battle". And it's just worth reminding people<br />
-as I did in the House yesterday of a few things: 10 years ago we were<br />
exporting 14% of our product, this year it is 22%, which puts us right in the<br />
middle of the OECD league 41 proportion of ) xports to GDP. Our capacity to<br />
service our debt has fallen that is, the proportion of our exports which we<br />
devote to paying the interest and outgoings on external liabilities was 21%<br />
of our exports, and is now 11 In fact the numbers were out today they<br />
confirm it again at 11 In other words, that growth in exports and our<br />
capacity to service our debt and pay our way like anyone's capacity to<br />
service a mortgage you know, you say " well, I have got a mortgage of<br />
$ 1 50,00 that's pretty big". But if earn $ 150,000 a year, then you are fine.<br />
So it all depends on your income. And our income has risen. In other words,<br />
if you are in a problem, you fight your way out of it you invest and work your<br />
way out of it. But they want to close it down " the growth is too much", they<br />
say. Their charge against us in the election was ' not enough growth and not<br />
enough employment", so the Government earnestly and honestly said " OK,<br />
that will be our priority growth and employment". We were re-hired by the<br />
country to get the place growing, and to get employment going again, and we<br />
have done that. They said, " oh no, that wasn't the trick at all we didn't really<br />
mean that, what we really meant was that we need really a pool of<br />
unemployment around to keep downward pressure on wages, and we don't<br />
want to see the Current Account moving up". This is Howard this is a<br />
person who presided over the industrial archaeology of the 1 970s, when the<br />
factories closed, when that other great economic genius John Stone was<br />
saying " you can't have a competitive manufacturing sector sitting beside an<br />
internationally competitive primary export sector. If you want minerals and </p>
<p>TEL: liar .95l 17 : 21 No .013 P. 05/ 11<br />
agriculture, you can't have manufacturing". Now this was the creed this was<br />
around he signed Howard up to this.<br />
So, here we are, with a burgeoning primary export sector, and a burgeoning<br />
manufacturing sector manufacturing exports have tripled in the last<br />
years. The fastest growing component of our exports are elaborately<br />
transformed goods, and we now have a very large internationally traded<br />
sector in services which didn't exist when John Howard was the Treasurer. It<br />
has all happened because of us. And yet here we are, with 5.5% growth and<br />
inflation, and he's saying " No good. No good", and in Europe you say<br />
" what is the average growth rate in the European Union?" and<br />
maybe 2.25% next year." And you say " is that right?" " Oh yeah". " What's<br />
your employment growth rate like?" " 0.75% 1 what's Australia's?"<br />
They have got to be joking. Now, I know all new leaders get a free ride for a<br />
while, but faced up to a bit of fact and argument other than rhetoric does<br />
anybody think there is a better substitute than these sorts of policies? Of<br />
closing the place down to a low growth economy again because a low<br />
growth economy simply means those who are doing well stay doing well, and<br />
those not doing so well do less well. And that sort of unfairness is what we<br />
don't need.<br />
And I'll tell you this about Howard he stands for nothing. He was a weak<br />
Treasurer, and he was a weak Leader, and he has no policies. And we saw it<br />
yesterday with the Aboriginal Land Fund. They said... . he had a chance he<br />
was out putting the spin all around the galleries, on every radio station, doing<br />
that sort of Jimmny Cricket number, bouncing up all over the place " yabba<br />
yabba yabba yabba yabba, yabba yabba yabba yabba" everywhere. As if the<br />
glib, clever line will.. he re~ ons he can say " yes" but mean " no" and<br />
someone reading the transcript can't quite work out what he means... . he was<br />
trained in the John Carrick school of cynical politics. This is where push<br />
polling came from, and all those other sorts of things in his days, he had the<br />
big red arrows from China, and they were coming to get us in the sampans,<br />
and remember all that? And he was Howard's mentor. And this is the sort of<br />
cynicism that you get from this guy he had a chance to say to the Senate<br />
and to his party " look, you selected me because you have got nobody else,<br />
and these are my terms I want to make a new start with Aboriginal Australia,<br />
I don't believe we can be an inclusive society without that happening. So I<br />
am out of all these amendments that my predecessor was going to consider<br />
in the Senate", trying to suggest for instance that we can make judgements<br />
about the degrees of dispossession, or try to invest individuals with the land<br />
and then give them the right to sell it, so that they actually leech away any<br />
fabric of an inheritance in land. All these mangy tricks that they wanted to<br />
write into the Bill. He could have said ' look, I am a lucky fellow, I have been<br />
given a second chance in public life simply by dent of hanging around long<br />
enough, and at least I am going to do the right thing and start clean.' And<br />
what does he do? He sends the Bill back from the Senate full of all of these<br />
compromising provisions. And some people said to us, ' well, look, maybe<br />
you better take the Bill as it is, at least it is a Land Fund Bill.' To which we<br />
said ' well, do the Aboriginals really I mean we have got the Native Title Act<br />
and Mabo, but it is really available to people who still have a traditional </p>
<p>TEL: 3 Mar .5 17 : 21 No. 013 F'. ub'' I<br />
association with the land. For those dispossessed, the Land Fund was a<br />
central ingredient to justice in land for Aboriginal people. So, if we let this<br />
through it is just another shabby compromise, so we said ' no, no we won't'.<br />
So we put the second Bill, the new Bill back into the House on Tuesday, our<br />
original Bill with some of the procedural amendments we were able to accept<br />
from the Senate rejecting all of the tawdry ones and said to Howard ' knock<br />
this over and we have got a double dissolution trigger and we will propose at<br />
an election that this issue be resolved by a joint sitting of both Houses there<br />
after, giving the Labor Party the option of a double dissolution. He went<br />
straight to water. He goes around saying ' oh, I'll have an election any time'.<br />
Pigs he will. And, all this puffery in the polls he knows it is just like a little<br />
helium balloon, you stick a pin in it and away it goes. He knows in the hard<br />
tack of an erection that we are going to be right on his tail, so he didn't want<br />
to be fighting any elections now.<br />
So, he dropped off. But, instead of dropping off saying ' well, look, I will let the<br />
Government's Bill through', trying to suggest he did turn over a new leaf with<br />
Aboriginal Australia, what did he say ' I'll let it through, but if we become the<br />
Government we will put all the bad amendments back into it'. Because they<br />
don't want to give black people land. That is the long and short of it, You<br />
can take all the science out of this and in the end what sits underneath it is a<br />
deeply seated prejudice against them,<br />
So, don't doubt this Government's strength or its principles or its resolve or its<br />
sense of purpose or its capacity because we will, as we have, take on all of<br />
these big block problems in Australia. Be it Australian competitiveness, be it<br />
opening Australia up, be it the rights and prerogatives of Aboriginal people,<br />
be it the status of women, you name it, we are the ones that have been doing<br />
it and those opposed to us still stand for the same old tripe, the same old<br />
conservative nonsense that they have always stood for.<br />
I said in Caucus the other day, think of some issues in the last 15 years. On<br />
the environment Howard said when he was Leader that the states would be<br />
left to decide the future of forests and wilderness areas. On Aborigines, you<br />
can't think of one positive thing he has ever said or done for them. On the<br />
republic he is the Colonel Blimp of the Liberal Party, the staunch monarchist.<br />
On Asia his only position was that he thought too many Asians were coming<br />
to Australia and that there would be a social backlash against them. On<br />
South Africa he corrected me the other day by saying ' no, it is not true that<br />
Nelson Mandela would still be in goal if it were left to my view. I called for his<br />
release in 1986'. That is 25 years after he was goaled. He opposed the ANC<br />
and he opposed the sanctions. I mean, this guy is from another age and here<br />
they have this obscurantist being proposed as the leader that can take this<br />
modern, confident country of ours into the next century. Well, of course, it<br />
would be a terrible shame for Australia and an unjust thing to do to the place.<br />
I want to make a couple of extra points about the ACT and the labour market.<br />
I made this point yesterday about their industrial relations policies. A week<br />
ago Peter Reith said we now believe in an evolutionary policy. We believe in<br />
gradualism and incrementalism. That's so, the average person says ' oh, well, </p>
<p>.7M 0517: 21 No. 013P. 07/ 11<br />
MMMMMMMMMMMTEL: Q. I'O<br />
7<br />
they have changed their tune a bit. Before they had individual wage<br />
contracts and they were going to slot us all, now they are just going to move<br />
on something and they believe in minimums.' But, when John Hewson<br />
resigned the other day and the speech that John Howard made following his<br />
departure he said ' well, there has been great changes in Australia' said<br />
Howard and he gave the Government credit for them in opening up the<br />
financial markets, in opening up the product markets with lower tariffs, he<br />
said ' but, the great reform yet to be done is in the labour market'. So, the<br />
week earlier Reith is saying ' don't worry, it is incrementalism and gradualism.'<br />
Howard is saying ' we have got the big block buster policy change for you.'<br />
Now, it is one or the other and we all know what it is. It is the big one,<br />
The thing you have got to know about the labour market is that it is not like a<br />
pool, it is more like a river. There are people changing their jobs every year.<br />
Last year 1.7 million Australians changed their jobs or entered the workforce<br />
out of eight million. When they do, they lose all of the award protections,<br />
they lose overtime, penalty rates, and it means that a lot of people in society<br />
are going to lose $ 100-$ 150 a week on low and middle incomes by losing<br />
those capacities and they will take either the contract or they won't be<br />
employed. So, if you look at that policy after four or five years, most<br />
Australians would be on contracts and they would be out of any enterprise<br />
bargaining framework or any set of award minimum protections which have<br />
got, of course, ajustments there for cost of living or protection for cost of living<br />
and the maintenance of these other things like overtime et cetera.<br />
Now, interestingly, in the ACT, 15 per cent of the labour force about 25 to<br />
30,000 people change their jobs each year or people join the labour market<br />
from school. So, give that over the life of one Parliament, you are talking<br />
about 75,000-90,000 people. Now, they will have the guts cut away from<br />
their working conditions and that will mean, of course, that if you start putting<br />
pressure on the whole industrial relations system it starts to degrade in that<br />
respect. Couple that with, of course, the fact that they are going to cut<br />
government spending and cut aggregate employment and you can see how<br />
quickly that would change the society here. Yet, they are running around<br />
saying to what is a very large public service town ' look, basically our policy is<br />
to cut you to ribbons and to put you on contracts'. And people are supposed<br />
to say ' oh, thanks for that, we will give you a vote, thanks a million.'<br />
We saw Kennett do it with the Victorian public service and we would see<br />
Reith and Howard do the same.<br />
So, the thing is, I think, that in looking at this election I mean, here we are<br />
standing on the very platform that we said we would in 1993 at the election<br />
growth with employment, with productivity, with the country growing. And, we<br />
have done all the things we have said. We said we would do justice to the<br />
Mabo decision, we have done it with the Native Title legislation, yesterday we<br />
did it with the Land Fund legislation.<br />
They are out there now on the environment trying to represent themselves as<br />
being in some way, I mean, they have opposed as I said the Gordon below </p>
<p>TEL: 3. Mar .951 1~ LN o<br />
Franklin would have been flooded had it been left to John Howard and the<br />
Coalition. All the great changes in the environment we have made they have<br />
opposed and McLachlan came out as their environment spokesman saying<br />
he is opposed to clear felling of trees in this country and immediately Fischer<br />
came out and said we won't have a bar of that policy, in fact that will not be<br />
our policy, he said, very firmly.<br />
So, they have no credentials and, I think, it is very important for people in this<br />
country to know that the only party that has the interest, the commitment and<br />
the strength to protect the environment is the Australian Labor Party there is<br />
no other. Now, we have seen the two Greens from Western Australia up to<br />
their chicanery on the Land Fund Bill as they were in the Native Title<br />
legislation. They are not going to be doing anything for the environment and<br />
Bob Brown and the Wilderness Society, there are some good people in the<br />
Wilderness Society, but Bob Brown is now running for a seat in the Senate<br />
because he thinks he can play corner politics with the continuing low quotas<br />
that the Senate is offering under the proportional representation system.<br />
So, people have got to put a big discount through the things he says. He try's<br />
to misrepresent my position and he knows that without my support the<br />
Daintree reservation which Graham Richardson put together wouldn't be<br />
there. In th e last year, just in the last year, this Government has put aside for<br />
ever, for this country, Shoalwater Bay one of the most attractive areas on<br />
the Australian east coast, one of the most attractive areas in the world<br />
Jervis Bay in New South Wales, by spending $ 30 million locating the<br />
armaments depot to Victoria so that we could leave that pristine. And, we put<br />
million in the Budget to buy back the hole in the heart of the Daintree that<br />
disgraceful subdivision Bjelke Petersen let through which is sitting there now<br />
in the forest, but all cut up into quarter acre lots, to buy that back. No credit<br />
did we get from that none and we have got this year's quota of logs and we<br />
are now seeking to establish the coupes and the quality in the stands and we<br />
have had a deluge of attacks on us by people who, frankly, should know<br />
better and who want to reach the same position we want to reach and that is<br />
to see that we are preserving our best stands of trees, our pristine forests,<br />
but at the same time having a sustainable forest products industry.<br />
These are things governments have to do. A lot of noisy people on the<br />
outside think they can do other things, but governments have to do serious<br />
things and we can do it. So, our environmental credentials won't be found<br />
wanting and I don't think can you imagine any year when the Liberal's put<br />
away something like Shoalwater Bay and Jervis Bay or protected Daintree,<br />
just in one year. This ; Government has got a long and, I think, proud<br />
environmental record and one of the things that we have never really had<br />
adequate credit for is the saving of Antarctica. Let me just say one little thing<br />
because Bob Brown runs around saying ' I saved the Gordon below Franklin'.<br />
Well, I was principally involved in securing the protection of Antarctica. Let<br />
me just tell you a little story.<br />
In 1986 I went to see Michel Rocard, who had become a friend of mine over<br />
the years and he had just become Prime Minister of France and I called on<br />
rii-z 0 00/ 11 </p>
<p>TEL: ' Mar-S No UI hU'<br />
9<br />
him six weeks after he became Prime Minister and we discussed the<br />
Matignon Accords in New Caledonia. At the end of it he said President<br />
Mitterand and I want to do something next year of an international flavour to<br />
celebrate the bicentenary of the French Revorution. Not something simply<br />
French, but something international. He talked about an environmental<br />
protection agency and I said to him ' look, it is a good idea, but we will be both<br />
old men before we ever see it, you know, getting a world environmental<br />
protection agency together.' He said ' well, as a fraternal party you might<br />
think about what we might do'. I said ' well, I have got an idea right now, but I<br />
must tell you that I am in a minority of two in my Cabinet about it', and my<br />
sole supporter was Peter Cook and he said ' what's that?' I said ' it is not to<br />
sign the Minerals Convention in Antarctica'. So, he asked his officials when<br />
they were going to sign this and they were to sign it in seven days from the<br />
time of our conversation. This came from the OPEC oil price rises when they<br />
decided to put a Minerals Convention into Antarctica to go drilling for oil, but<br />
since the oil pressure had gone, the foreign affairs departments of the world<br />
kept grinding away with the Minerals Convention. And, I said ' they will make<br />
a mess of Antarctica and were you to join us we have a reasonable chance of<br />
stopping it and put Antarctica away for 50 years as a wilderness park'. Now, I<br />
said ' I would have to convince Bob ( Hawke) about this, but if you give him a<br />
suitably flattering letter, I'm sure I could get him into it'. He did and then it<br />
was the Bob and Michel show from there on, but we gradually worked on the<br />
Japanese and the Americans and we saved Antarctica from being ripped to<br />
pieces. So, when Bob Brown says he saved the Gordon below Franklin, we say ' yes,<br />
and we saved a continent'. Don't worry, we will have the political amalgam<br />
back together, all the people in this country that have got some ticker. I<br />
noticed at the Australian Creative Fellowship Awards recently, John Olson<br />
said ' look, there is only two kinds of people lovers and others', and we all<br />
know what to think of the others don't we'. Now, the lovers are the people<br />
that have got an interest in this country, that have got good will towards their<br />
fellows, a sense of compassion, a sense of inclusion, a sense of commitment.<br />
That is where we are. We are on the lovers side of Australian politics and we<br />
know where the others are.<br />
So, let's kick off a long hard year for John Howard with this campaign<br />
opening today. And, say to Sue Robinson that with courage and decency<br />
and style she has washed off all this dreadful unAustralian behaviour with<br />
push polling and that the worst instincts of the Liberal party won't get the<br />
better of her. And, they won't get the better of the people of the seat of<br />
Canberra either and let them know that if the Liberals get up that this won't be<br />
the city that it is now and it won't be the country t -' at it is now and that there<br />
can be no substitute to continuing the great reformation of Australia its<br />
economy, its society, its place in the world. And, while the going gets a bit<br />
hard on or -, asions and it gets a bit complex we must, we owe it to ourself to<br />
press on and we don't want to go back down the time tunnel to reactionary<br />
politics and one Australia and one Wollstonecraft and one Menzies and one<br />
dead hand, we want to keep this progressive change coming through. </p>
<p>I am happy to begin this fight for this election with Sue Robinson and a<br />
victory here in Canberra because the thing we must know in this country, you<br />
get social progress by victories, like we did in the Land Fund Bill yesterday.<br />
You get social progress by wins, you don't get it by unseemly compromises,<br />
So, let's not compromise here in the ACT and lets have an unambiguous<br />
victory for the lovers in Australian politics and we will leave the others to their<br />
miserable brand of politics and their miserable approach to this country.<br />
Best wishes to you, Sue, and the campaign.<br />
ends </p>
