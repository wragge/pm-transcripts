FOR MEDIA 8 DECEMBER 1987<br />
When the New Parliament House is opened in May 1988,<br />
arrangements will be made for a form of religious observance<br />
to take place in conjunction with the ceremonies.<br />
When the Provisional Parliament House was opened in 1927,<br />
prayers were read by representatives of the Anglican,<br />
Presbyterian and Methodist Churches. While the form of the<br />
observance in 1988 is yet to be decided it will take into<br />
account the wide range of religious beliefs held in<br />
contemporary multicultural Australian society.<br />
Various options for the observance are being examined, in<br />
consultation with the religious groups, and a decision on<br />
details will be announced in due course. ~ 1U3 Lc) </p>
