LOCOMOTIVES AND ROLLING 3TOCK FOR THE<br />
PORT PiRIE-COCKBURN LINE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, announced that he<br />
had written to the Premier of South Australia, Sir Thomas<br />
Playford, to inform him that the Commonwealth was willing to<br />
provide South Australia with finance not exceeding<br />
Å“ 1,325,000 for the purchase by the State of twelve ' 9001 h. p.<br />
Diesel-Electric Locomotives, and one hundred 55-Ton capacity<br />
cre waggons for operation on the existing Port Pirie-Cockbun<br />
line. This offer is on the basis that the State shall repay in<br />
full to the Commonwealth over a period of 50 years, 30o of<br />
the expenditure incurred by the State for this purpose,<br />
together with interest at the long term bond rate.<br />
Mr. Menzies stated that he had made it cleaTr<br />
conveying this offer of Commonwealth assistance that i wou.-i.<br />
be quite separate from assistance under the 1949 Standardisation<br />
Agreement. However, in making the offer, the Commonwealth<br />
recognised that new and efficient locomotives and rolling<br />
stock, which would be capable of conversion to standard gauge<br />
operation, would be most advantageous on standardisation of<br />
the line.<br />
