I.<br />
FOR MEDIA30 March 1986<br />
I am saddened by the death of Alan Missen. He was a man of great<br />
personal charm and character. He had an awareness of the<br />
problems of people, a remarkable breadth of vision, a tolerance<br />
and a compassion. He was outstanding in his work in the fields<br />
of Amnesty, and civil liberties generally. Above all, Alan<br />
Missen was a man of conscience and a great humanist. The<br />
Parliament is the poorer for his untimely death. I extend my<br />
sympathies to his family. </p>
