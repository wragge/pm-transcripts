LIBERAL PARTY RALLY. SYDNEY TOWAN HALL<br />
Speech by the Prime Ministe. he Rt. Hon. R. G. Mnzs<br />
Mr. Cha-2man, parliamentary colleagues, ladies and gentlemen:<br />
Tonight I propose to confine myself to matters that I know<br />
are vexing your minds. I won't tal~ k about international affairs<br />
in the broad tonight, though I have no doubt that on some other<br />
occasion 1 will have something to say about them. But I do want<br />
to talk about the more m~ aterial aspects of our life as affected<br />
by what goes on here, and by what goes on overseas.<br />
I think it is proper to do that because there have beer.<br />
times only a few but there have been times when I felt<br />
frightfully popular. ( Laughter) And I must say that on those<br />
rare occasions I have enjoyed it being like anybody else. And<br />
thiere have been times when I have b~ on frightfully unpopular<br />
and on the whole I haven't lacked some enjoyment of those.<br />
Other times represent a sort of middle course.<br />
But the fact is that last year, and particularly in<br />
Novembar of last year, the Govcrnment, your Government, the<br />
Government which all of you support and have helped to put in,<br />
had to take some pretty stringent measures to deal with an<br />
inflationary boom in Australia. Although inflation is properly<br />
unpopular with many people, and with me, it is not unpopular with<br />
some others who find in it the exhilaration of going out on a<br />
booming market, and leaving the casualtius to look after<br />
themselves. Interestingly enough since we adopted our course the same<br />
problem has come to the top in Great Britain. lie live, of<br />
course, all the great things in tho world in common with Groat<br />
Britain. But it was only the other day, metaphorically, that<br />
the Government of the United Kingdom had to bring down a "' little<br />
Budget". Having brought down one or two " little Budgets" in my<br />
own time I know that this is not necessarily a term of affection.<br />
( Laughter) But they had to bring down a " little Budget" out of<br />
the ordinary time for a Budget; and they had to bring it dIoxm,<br />
may I remind you, for reasons not dissimilar to those for which<br />
we brought down our economic measures in November last. They<br />
found themsclves with a high measure of inflation at home; with<br />
their trade balances getting a little bit weak, a little bit bad,<br />
a little bit sick, worred about their exports and worried about<br />
their imports, worried about the strength of their currency.<br />
This is a pretty good short description of the kind of<br />
thing that wo were experiencing in our own country, though, of<br />
course, naturally, on a slightly smaller scale. iW~ hon I noticed<br />
that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, M4r. Selwyn Lloyd, had<br />
brought down a little Bqdget in which ho had incroasod sales<br />
taxes, which they call purchase tax in England, in which he had<br />
frozen wages and dividands, in which he had raised the bank rate',<br />
as they call it there, the discount rate, which dominates the<br />
interest structure of Great Britain, from to that he had<br />
gone to the International Menetpry Fund to make a drawing to<br />
protect his currency abroad except that he drew 1892m. and we<br />
drew a beggarly 178Mf.; when I saw all these things I thought<br />
" Well now, he'll be in trouble". ( Laughter) You know it is<br />
one of the great tOuths of life that no; thing so takes your mind<br />
off your own troublos as to sae another man in his. ( Laughter)<br />
"' Well", I thought, " poor Selwyn, he's in trouble". And I<br />
expected that some of my clos-c admirers in the newspaper world<br />
would have made na~ sty remarks a~ bout him, but they didn't. They<br />
seem~ ed to thinl: that what was right in Great Britain must be<br />
wrong in Austra*-a. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Now I mention those facts to you because if you find great<br />
problems being dealt with in other great countries along similar<br />
lines, then there is probably something to be said for what we<br />
have been doing in our own country. And may I remind you on that<br />
point that we did it first. ( Applause)<br />
Now, you all know the kind of thing that we found it<br />
necessary to do, the steps that we found it necessary to take.<br />
You are no doubt very familiar with the criticisms which I don't<br />
resent at all and no doubt you yourselves have made themo, or<br />
heard thom. Therefore tonight I think I would like to show you,<br />
if I may, that we are not unaware of these criticisms; and I,<br />
for one, would like to help you to answer them, fairly and fully.<br />
. Was the policy that we pursued, starting at the beginning of<br />
last year, intensified, ultinately, in November of last year, a<br />
pig-headed policy, a policy dictated by theorists? Or was it<br />
not? And the second question is: Have we pig-headedly pursued<br />
this policy after it was no longer nceded? Now I think those<br />
are two questions that you have hoard and that I would like to<br />
say something about.<br />
I have the great pleasure of having on this platform half a<br />
dozen of my colleagues in the Government at Canberra. I don't<br />
think any one of them was ever accused of being a theoretical<br />
man: all are men of wide experiences of one kind or another,<br />
not at all the kind of people who want to got a University<br />
professor to write them an essay and they say, " That goes for<br />
me". Not at all. I have had a lot more practical experience<br />
in dealing with the economics of Australia than any of then not<br />
my colleagues, but any of the theorists and I take leave to<br />
tell you that whenever I have expressed a view on behalf of the<br />
Government it has represented a view which stoes from my own<br />
experience and my own judjment, a view that I am prepared to<br />
stand up to, as you would wish me to stand up to it.<br />
There was a boom roaring along in 1960. I have mot many<br />
people, some of then politely and some of thym impolitely,<br />
critical; I have never yet not one who didn t admit that there<br />
was a boom blowing up in 1960, a boon in which the demand on our<br />
resources, the demand on manpower and materials and everything<br />
else was so tremendous that prices were rising fast, that the<br />
cost of getting things done was rising fast. If you have a<br />
boom like that what do you do about it? In the short run it is<br />
popular to do nothing about it. There are a lot of people who<br />
say, " What is wrong with a boom?" We have had plenty of, those in<br />
the world and of course those who speculate in money don't mind a<br />
boom because they chase it along. But from the point of view of<br />
a sound colmunity like Australia, a boon is every bit as anathema<br />
as a great depression; and every bit as dangerous.<br />
You know, I sometimes wonder whether our memories are as<br />
good as thuy should be. Jo are not going to have, in my lifetime<br />
or in anybody else's, a depression of the kind that we knew in<br />
the early 30' s. The day has gone by for that. People know too<br />
much today to have that happen, But it is perhaps worthwhile<br />
recalling to ourselves how that one happened: a depression,<br />
which in Australia at the beginning of 1932 exhibited 25 to<br />
unemployment. It didn't come about for reasons peculiar to<br />
Australia. I know that my poor predecessor Stanley Bruce was blamed for<br />
it. Prime Ministers are always blamed for something. It is<br />
fair enough because they are given credit sometimes for things<br />
that they didn't do. So I don't mind.<br />
I/ </p>
<p>But the origin of that boom, and that burst, that<br />
depression, was -to be found,, above all places, in the United<br />
States of America whichi came out of the first world war for the<br />
first time in its history, a great creditor country and had<br />
millions invested all round the world, On the strength of these<br />
invest,_ its the United States had an enormous credit structure.<br />
You mustn't suppose that all these fine-spun credit schemes that<br />
vre are so familiar with recently are new. There they rere after<br />
the first world war in the United States of America, with the<br />
Stock Exchange booming, people gambling on margins on the<br />
Exchange, millions being won and millions being lost, because<br />
it usually works out that way.<br />
But what they hadn't realised was that it is no use having<br />
thousands of millions invested in other countries unless you can<br />
get the fruit of your investment. They found they couldn't get<br />
the fruit of thneir investment because they wanted to be a great<br />
creditor country and, at the same time, have the highest tariff<br />
in the world. So they shut out the goods of the countries where<br />
thiey had invested their money. By the time all the gold had<br />
come in and was parked away in Fort Knox they found that their<br />
investments w;: re fruitless.<br />
And yet on the strength of those investments, in the<br />
atmosphere of boom in the middle of the late 201s, they had this<br />
enormous structure of success in their own country. When their<br />
overseas investments became sterile, became unprofitable, then<br />
the whole structure began to collapse on itself. That is the<br />
simplest and truest explanation of what went on at that time.<br />
So, almost overnight, the great boom became the great smash,<br />
and the great depression, and this, of course, influenced<br />
countries and people all round the world, It came to Australia<br />
to impose the most enormous suffering on Australian people.<br />
Now we are not going to have that again. I, for one,<br />
decline to allow a boom in Australia to go to the point of burst<br />
and depression. And * that goes for my colleogues. This is our<br />
duty; and even in politics your duty must be the prevailing<br />
element in your mind. ( Applause)<br />
Suppose we had said as I have heard some people say<br />
". lell what is wrong with inflation" ldhat is wrong withi a boom?<br />
It~ just a sign of health in a g'rowing country". Itve even<br />
read some economists credited withi such remarks. Let me answer<br />
them. Inflation running, running, growing, growing, as it was in<br />
1960, is the complete enemy of social advancement not it's<br />
friend, it's enemy. You just consider: if we have inflation,<br />
if we have price levels rising and rising at a rapid rate, who<br />
wants to put money into anything at a fixed interest rate? Who<br />
wants to buy Commonwealth Bonds, or Bonds for one of the great<br />
public utilities in a State, if he believes that the value of<br />
his investment is going to be whittled away with great speed by<br />
inflation, by a fall in the -value of money? We have found, in<br />
the past, ' that when you have an inflationary boom, or even the<br />
beginnings of one, the loan marlrct becomes sick,<br />
11Now, when I talk to you about the loan market you may say,<br />
I'm not intere sted in the loan market". But you are. You<br />
may never have bought a loan bond in your life, but you are<br />
interested in the loan market. And I will tell you why: because<br />
the great public w.. orks programmies of Australia have to be paid<br />
for out of loan money; or out of revenue from taxation. The<br />
smaller the amount raised by loan, the greater the taxation and<br />
we are all interested in that. </p>
<p>What are these works programmes? You know I occasionally<br />
hear men talk about public works as if they were some horrible<br />
competitor with private enterprise. On the contrary! Private<br />
enterprise, to which I am devoted, couldn't advance without<br />
public works. Public works cover all sorts of things: roads,<br />
bridges, power production, the great Snowy Mountains enterprise,<br />
school. hospitals, transport of all kinds, water supply. Look,<br />
you could go through the whole gamut of public works and when<br />
you add them up they are all things that we are demanding as a<br />
people; and they are all things without wlich industrial<br />
advancement in Australia would be impossible.<br />
Who would dream of establishing a new factory, a great<br />
enterprise, unless he felt that there was going to be housing and<br />
roads and streets and schools and all the things that would<br />
enable him to get employees to live in a happy community? The<br />
thing doesn't need to be laboured.<br />
I just say to you that if you have an inflationary boom<br />
unchecked you will still need to have these public works. True<br />
they will cost fabulously more money because as inflationary<br />
booms go on up goes the cost of everything. And the money will<br />
more and more come out of your taxes which, of course, will be<br />
increased accordingly; and less and less out of the normal<br />
processes of borrowing capital on the public market.<br />
I could give you a dozen illustrations of what I mean by the<br />
effect of a boom on the country. ! oe saw it going on and we<br />
decided that we must '; heck it. Now you don't check a boom by<br />
going to it and saying, courteously, " Would you mind quieterLing<br />
down a little?" On the contrary. If you are dealing with boom<br />
conditions you must be resolute, you must be prepared to take<br />
measures which, of course, nobody will like very much and some<br />
people will dislike very bitterly because those who profit from<br />
a boom don't want to have it checked. If you analyse the boom<br />
and you find that in certain industries there is an over-demand<br />
and that this is causing a boom, then of course you are going to<br />
have objections. I will give you one simple illustration, and that is the<br />
motor vehicle industry. Now let us speak quite plainly about<br />
this. I know that there are one or two great motor car<br />
enterprises in Australia which feel the pinch of poverty at the<br />
present time. But let's face up to it: do you know that by the<br />
time we took these last measures of ours in November, 1960<br />
roughly a thousand motor vehicles a day were being produced and<br />
sold in Australia; Australia, with 10 million people and<br />
350,000 motor vehicles coming out in the course of the year.<br />
So great was the demand on labour, so great was the demand<br />
on materials in this industry that everybody was competing with<br />
the other man for the labour that he needed: bidding up on pay,<br />
conpetition for supplies of raw materials and half-finished<br />
materials. If over there was one particular industry that was<br />
contributing to inflationary conditions in Australia it was the<br />
motor vehicle industry.<br />
It seems odd to say that because it is a great industry, a<br />
useful industry. It has given enormous employment in Australia<br />
and, so long as it doesn't eot entirely out of hand, it is vital<br />
to the economic existence of Australia. I grant you all that.<br />
But it was going too fast and too far. Therefore we had to<br />
check it. And we checked it, partly by what is now callod the<br />
" credit squeeze" though I will say something to you about that<br />
a little later on partly by the provisions we introduced to<br />
render non-deductible certain payments of interest made by<br />
companies, and partly by a 10 per cent increased sales tax on<br />
motor vehicles. So the general policy and the particular policy<br />
were directed, among other things, to the motor car industry. </p>
<p>It is quite true that the impact of this has been that the<br />
motor vehicle industry is not producing as many vehicles. I want<br />
to say to you in plain, blunt, homely terns, that if it were, our<br />
policy would have failed. Do you see? It was bound to be<br />
producing less unless our policy was a fiasco. And if it<br />
produce less, so nany less, then it will enploy so many less<br />
people. Now this is one of the facts that I want you all to<br />
face up to. You can't reduce the pressure of the motor vehicle<br />
industry without reducing, for a tine, its production; and you<br />
can't reduce its production for a tine without having some impact<br />
on the employment that it gies. Therefore there were bound to be<br />
some people, through no fault of their own, who would cease to be<br />
employed in the motor vehicle industry and would, in due course,<br />
be employed in some other.<br />
You know there are a lot of people who credit themselves<br />
with a spurious sort of logic, who will say to you, " Ah, so you<br />
intended to put people out of work. What a monster you are".<br />
A monster I may be I don't think so. But how do you reduce<br />
even to a small degree, the activities of a great industry in the<br />
interests of the overall stable economy of the country without<br />
touching the affairs of a number of worthy individuals? It can't<br />
be done. If somebody had said to me when we were devising our<br />
programme, " Look old boy, you can't do that because General<br />
Motors, or somebody else, will employ less people" and I had said<br />
" Oh, well, of course I can't face up to that", and my colleagues<br />
had adopted the sane weak-need attitude we would still have a<br />
boom; and before long we would have the smash of a quarter of a<br />
century. We are not going to have it. Our duty is to this country,<br />
not to somebody else, on these matters, but to our own country.<br />
And our duty in this country is to all the elements of<br />
stability, that solid foundation for a country which alone can<br />
enable a great edifice to be built on it. hfe have a very lively<br />
interest in my Government, in the future of Australia. We<br />
foresee in our own country, in the next ten years, a degree of<br />
development, of growth, of strength, which will surpass the<br />
record of the last ten years. But we are not so crazy as to<br />
believe that we can move confidently into that decade if, in the<br />
meantime, we have allowed the foundations to be broken by a boon<br />
and a smash<br />
There is one other reason why we had to deal with this<br />
matter. I refer to it with some hesitation, but really it is<br />
very important. It is that Australia lives to a very large<br />
extent by trading with the world. Don't let us get into our<br />
minds the idea that we can live comfortably in Australia by<br />
taking in each other's washing at a premiur rate and that<br />
everything . ill be right. Not at all. Je are a great trading<br />
nation. Ten million people we nay be, wretched Government we may<br />
have, but Itell you, with pride, that this Australia of ours is,<br />
in actual intrinsic terms, one of the great ten trading nations<br />
in the world. ( Applause) That means, of course, that we sell<br />
to the world; and we buy from it. Because it is one of the<br />
oddities of life that if you don't buy you will soon be out of<br />
the business of selling. Trade happens to be like that: it runs<br />
both ways. As our wool is sold, as our wheat is sold, as our moat is<br />
sold, as our sugar, and some manufactured exports, and so on, are<br />
sold so we., as a nation, acquire funds in the rest of the world.<br />
Then as we buy things from the rest of the world I don't mean<br />
the Government, but John Smith, or John Jones Ltd., or whatever<br />
it may be so there is a drawing made onthe funds that we have<br />
in the rest of the world. The balance that we have at any given<br />
moment we call our overseas reserves, our balance of payments<br />
producing our overseas reserve. </p>
<p>Well I must tell you that in November of last year we found<br />
that our overseas balances were running down quite steadily and<br />
we had to think about that a groat deal because if you start off<br />
with so many millions in your overseas funds and they are runming<br />
dcwn, month by month, y~ u got to a point where they look as if<br />
they might disappear. I want to toll every importer in the<br />
country though they know it already that if overseas funds<br />
disappe they will never import anything because there won't be<br />
any money to pay for the imports.<br />
The whole existence of our international trade dopends upon<br />
us maintaining, as a nation, outside Australia, chiefly with the<br />
Bank of England, reserves which will enable us, even though we<br />
may have a failure of a harvest, or a grievous fall in the price<br />
of wool, to pay our way in relation to the things that cone into<br />
Australia, so that we won't dufault, so that we won't be<br />
internationally bankrupt. We found that these precious funds<br />
were running down.<br />
That was another reason why we imposed those stringent<br />
measures. We believed that if we did have, call it what you<br />
like, a " credit squeeze", a restriction in Australia, less and<br />
less money would be available to be spent on imports and<br />
therefore our overseas funds would not run down ony longer. So<br />
that you won't think that we have been theorising about this<br />
matter, I tell you with groat satisfaction, that putting on one<br />
side all the money that we arranged to get from the International<br />
Monetary Fund, our overseas reserves, as a result of the<br />
policies pursued by your Governpent, are today just on 1lOOm.<br />
more than they were at the end of January of this year. ( Applause)<br />
And just as it is a very good thing for a human being to remain<br />
solvent if he can, so it is an essential thing for a nation to<br />
remain solvent, if it can.<br />
I was told, and no doubt some of my colleagues have been<br />
told, that we had made a mess of all this in Australia. We,<br />
this wretched Government who, by some accident have really<br />
managed the country tolerably well for 10 or 11 years, have made<br />
such a mess of it in the llth year that everybody would lose<br />
confidence in us. I thought, " ell0, there will be a very<br />
interesting way to test this because a great deal of our<br />
internationi solvency has been based upon the fact that with all<br />
our errors, with all our defects, with all our follies, we are<br />
the most popular country for investment in the world."<br />
Now I wonder how that happened? Did that happen because you<br />
had a Government that would seek popularity at all costs? Or<br />
because you had a Government that would do what it thought was<br />
right and set out to have stability and security in this country?<br />
I say we are the most popular country for investment purposes in<br />
the world and I confirm that to you tonight.<br />
Last year, 1959/ 60, going back to June of last year, we had<br />
a very large inflow of private capital. I don't mean money<br />
borrowed by governments; I mean capital brought in here by hardheaded<br />
people who see in Australia a great future. They are the<br />
people we want: the people who have some imagination about the<br />
future of Australia, the people who say to themselves, " That's<br />
the country to go to", just as on one occasicn, if the<br />
circumstances had arisen, they would have been saying that the<br />
United States, in its beginnings of expansion, was the country to<br />
go to. These are hard-headed people. They are not philanthropists.<br />
I hoven't met many philanthropists in my life. There are few, far<br />
example, in V-all Street in New York. Yet this year, this<br />
financial year that has just ended, the flow of private<br />
investment capital for business and development in Australia has<br />
boon much higher than it was last year and in fact is an all-time<br />
record for Australia. ( Applause) </p>
<p>Of course you see what that means? When one opens the paper<br />
and sees that some gr-at enterprise has a development progranne<br />
of œ ifm. or œ 20n. and I have seen several of those in the last<br />
few weeks that doesn't noan that something is going to happen<br />
next week, because things have to be got going. But it does<br />
mean that with all the impact of this enormous investment, with<br />
the de-opment that it produces, with the demand that it sets<br />
up, 1962 is going to be a very great year of prosperity in the<br />
history of Australia. ( Applause)<br />
Now perhaps I night refer to a particular criticismL which<br />
sone of you, ry friends, must have encountered. Every now and<br />
then somebody will say, " Ah, yes, well the Government r: ay be<br />
right, but it keeps on changing its mind". " Stop and go", I thirk<br />
is the operative phrase.<br />
It is quite true that we have modified our measures from<br />
time to time; it is much more inportantly true that our policy<br />
has never changed at all. Our policy is stability and<br />
development. You can sum it up in that way. The economic<br />
stability of the country and the development of the country on<br />
that sound foundation, We have never lost sight of either of<br />
them. We know we can't have perfect stability. I don't want to<br />
be academic about that but we do know that unless you have some<br />
reasonable stability that gives people some confidence in what<br />
they have, then your development is going to be modified in<br />
consequence. So, stability and development.<br />
Our policies of last year, our policies in March, our<br />
policies in the Budget last yoer, our policies last November were<br />
all designed to produce stability and encourage development. You<br />
remember, in the broad, what they were.<br />
But, of course, we have changed some of the things we did.<br />
'. hat sort of fools would we be to start at the beginning of a<br />
year and say, " Well those are the measures for the year and<br />
whatever happens we are not going to change them"? h', at sort of<br />
noodles, to use a good old fashioned word, would we be to go on<br />
in that pig-headed sort of fashion? I wouldn't hesitate tomorrow<br />
to change some measure that we had introduced if I thought it had<br />
outlived its usefulness, if I thought that so far from doing good<br />
it was beginning to do some harm. What do you expect? I don't<br />
know why all these charges of insanity should be concentrated on<br />
our unhappy heads in Australia because all over the world this<br />
is done. Nobody complains if the Chancellor of the Exchequer in<br />
England raises the bank rate from 3J% to and reduces it to 4%<br />
six weeks later; and pushes it up to and then reduces it to<br />
six weeks later. He knows that this is a flexible instrument<br />
for dealing with the economy. ' e don't have it. We have to<br />
choose rather broader methods. Nobody says of the Chancellor,<br />
" The poor fellow doesn't know his own mind". If he didn't move<br />
the bank rate around people who knew what it was about would say<br />
he wasn't fit for the job.<br />
So this charge that we change front, let me answer it<br />
specifically. We wanted to reduce the pressure of the motor car<br />
industry I've told you about that so the general policy<br />
applied which touched hire purchase, which touched a number of<br />
financial dealers, money dealers, which touched bank credit; and<br />
we also put on an extra 10% sales tax.<br />
When we looked at the matter a few months later, early this<br />
ye'. r, we said, " Well, we are having an effect on the motor car<br />
industry, but it is going too far because there are quite a few<br />
people who say, ' IWell they couldn't koop that extra sales tax on<br />
in the Budget, in an election year' you know what people think<br />
of us politicians ' therefore wo will hold off buying the new<br />
car until the Budget'". Therefore we thought that we were </p>
<p>inflicting, ' nadvertently in that way, a double disability on<br />
the motor car industry, and so we abandoned the extra 10% sales<br />
tax. Was this sensible? Was this a proof that we didn't know<br />
our own minds? You can take your choice. I think it was<br />
thoroughly sensible. If we had been unwilling to do it we would<br />
have needed to be ashamed of ourselves.<br />
Wu found that in some places, and in some ways, there was<br />
what shall I call it politely? a little bit of a racket going<br />
on in the great financial world by the borrowing of money at<br />
fancy rates of interest, and then being able to deduct the whole<br />
of the interest before you worked out your taxable profit. A<br />
very agreeable device, one that no doubt is faniliar to every<br />
accountant in the audience; a very agreeable device from the<br />
point of view of the taxpayer because it meant that he saved tax<br />
equivalent to about half the interest, or about in the<br />
This was, of course, extraordinarily popular. We came down with<br />
a wallop on this. We introduced a provision about the<br />
deductibility of interest before you assessed your taxable income<br />
that was a bit of a crippler, a bit of a wallop, to put it in<br />
those terms. It achieved results. I tell you that if the<br />
speculative boom in land for which there are probably many people<br />
in this audience who have had to pay, had been allowed to go on<br />
the cost of houses, the cost of homes, would have risen more and<br />
more every year because of the fabulous amounts of money in a<br />
speculative market that had to be paid for a home site. Under<br />
those circumstances you hit, and you hit hard. Today most people<br />
would agree with you that that speculative boon has been quelled,<br />
that there is a great deal more sobriety in these matters than<br />
there was. When we found that we said, " Very well, to make this<br />
rather rough and violent measure of ours permanent would be<br />
unfair to legitimate business". So we dropped it. Do you see<br />
what I mean? All these changes that you have hea d about have<br />
been changes in the direction of mitigating the severity of the<br />
measures that were taken.<br />
There was a considerable boom in the building industry and<br />
nobody gets very happy about doing anything about that<br />
unncossarily, because hc-sing is one of the great problems of the<br />
nation, and one of the great human problems in Australia. But it<br />
was affected by the measures that we took. We found that the<br />
measures were going too far. Therefore without any hesitation we<br />
modified their impact; and, in modifying the impact we provided,<br />
or arranged for, very substantial additional finance for housing.<br />
Earlier this year after all these measures of ours had<br />
been taken the Reserve Bank asked the Savings Banks to<br />
increase their rate of lending. The Trading Banks also<br />
increased their lending for housing. In May we arranged, as a<br />
special move, that the Commnonwealth Savings Bank should provide<br />
an additional œ 5m. during the ensuing few months. At the sane<br />
time in May my colleague, the Minister for National Developnont,<br />
who administers War Service Homes, was able to announce a special<br />
arrangement to eliminate waiting time for now homes under the<br />
War Service Homes Scheme. In June a very large sum of money was<br />
allocated in the defence vote for the building of , dfence hones<br />
in Queensland. In other words great additional provision was made in order<br />
to cunteract any undue fall in the rate of housing. And at the<br />
same time, in the Loan Council this year, in June, we, the<br />
Corronwealth, agreed to support a borrowing programme and<br />
" support a borrowing programme" means putting a good deal of it<br />
on our Budget by way of taxes a borrowing progra~ me of œ 240m.<br />
for State works and housing that is œ lOm. more than the<br />
previous year. The allocation for housing, agreed to by the<br />
States, was set at œ 42.9m. call it œ 43m. which is very<br />
nearly œ 6m. more than in 1960/ 61. And in order to encourage the </p>
<p>rapid attack upon housin&amp; schemes, we offered, as the<br />
Cormonwealth, to provide the State G: Dvornments with these<br />
housing funds at an accoloratod rate during the first half of<br />
the year. Now, Sir, I won't labour that. All those things indicate<br />
what I ' ve been saying to you: that whare it has becorac<br />
necessary to make a change In the sanse of modifying the<br />
severity of some measure already taken we have done so. I am<br />
happy to say that in the field of housing, whure, a few years<br />
ago, we used to talk about 65-70,000 houses as a prot.; large<br />
annual programme in Australia, the figures already in this<br />
calendar year suggest a total of something like 78-80,000 houses<br />
for the year. Now this I regard as a remarkably good state of<br />
affairs. You have heard a lot about the " credit squeeze". It has<br />
almost become like the-blessed word " Mesopotamia". Wherever you<br />
go somebody says " I have been knocked about by the credit<br />
squeeze" and some people have. Some people, of course I have<br />
bcen knocked about by unwise trading on their own account, but<br />
only some. There are others who have felt the stringency of<br />
these matters; just as they enjoyed the advantages of the<br />
inflationary boon conditions when they existed.<br />
But today what is the " credit squeeze"? I hope I tuon't be<br />
haunted to my grave by ghosts coming out of the corner and<br />
talking about the credit squecze to me because I want to tell you<br />
in plain terms that the credit squeeze, as people understood it,<br />
nine months ago is not with us today. I ea. quired only yesterday<br />
as to what the last directive was from the Reserve Bank, because<br />
the Reserve Bank has the supremely important task of trying to<br />
regulate the monetary supply in Australia, and banking policy,<br />
and banking interest rates. Well the Governor of the Bank<br />
announced publicly at the end of June, five weeks ago, that in<br />
recent months the banks have been encouraged to increase their<br />
new lending in selective fields, in particular for housing and<br />
for primary production.<br />
The reduction of inflationary pressures in the economy has<br />
now enabled the Reserve Bank to restore to Trading Banks greater<br />
discretion in the allocation of loans. They have been asked to<br />
ensure that appropriate bank finance should continue to be<br />
available for housing and for export production in riaC mniirf<br />
and manufacturing industries. And within the limits of a<br />
modorate increase in their new lending, they may grant additional<br />
accommodation on the basis of normal banking tests, subject -to<br />
continued observance of two broad principles this is all that<br />
remains of the credit squee) ze first, existing restraints<br />
should continue to be exercised in providing credit to finance<br />
imports and for hire purchase and instalment selling; and<br />
second, finance should not be provided directly, or indirectly,<br />
for speculative activities.<br />
Now that is what is left of the credit squeeze. In the last<br />
few months the better part of œ-90m. has been released from special<br />
reserves to the Trading Banks and I am happy to say that the<br />
Trading Banks today have a position of liquidity which is<br />
substantially above the normal ralnimum and, in fact, is<br />
substantially higher than it was in June of 1960.<br />
The re3al trouble this perhaps is the only other thing that<br />
I have time to t alk about the real trouble is not a credit<br />
squeeze, it is not bank policy, it is not the unwillingness of<br />
banks to lend, because in may recent experience they all exhibit<br />
willingness to lend, on a proper proposal. The real trouble is<br />
this: there have beaen too many calamity howlers in this country. </p>
<p>I am shocked, occasionally, when I see, as I did in my own State<br />
recently, people publishing advertisements to encourage in the<br />
minds of employees the idea that their job is coning to an end<br />
tomorrow. If I ran a business I don't think I would run it that<br />
way. S. primarily, is there some unemployment? Of course there<br />
has been a great stocking up from the past and it takes a while<br />
for stocks to be sold off. But basically the trouble is that the<br />
calamity howlers, and I want you to go out and deal with the: n,<br />
are always trying to persuade people that the worst is yet to<br />
cone, that there is some frightful calamity around the corner.<br />
My political opponents, and yours, thrive on this, live on it.<br />
Well, what is the fact? The fact is that in Australia,<br />
unlike the United States or Canada, where they would regard our<br />
position as most envirble, it is quite true that out of every<br />
100 people willing and able to work 97 have a job and are<br />
working at it. That is making a liberal estimate of what<br />
unemployment may be today. I am not defending une mployment; I<br />
hate unemployment. I think that the great responsibility that<br />
we have to restore stability and security to Australia involves<br />
getting rid of unemployment. But there are 97people out of<br />
every hundred at work. And if they went along and lived in the<br />
ordinary way, and bought what they wanted to buy, I will<br />
undertake to say that the position in trade, right back to<br />
manufacturing in Australia, would improve steadily week by week.<br />
But they have people saying to them, " Oh, no, you might be the<br />
next to go; you are one of 97, but perhaps you are the one to<br />
go". And so the whole 97 button up and I don'L blame them<br />
if they listen to these false prophets who are so plentiful.<br />
What we have to do is to make it clear to people that this<br />
policy has worked, has produced the most magnificent results in<br />
the broad, has saved our international balances, has steadied<br />
down the increase in prices. It has achieved all these results<br />
superbly well.<br />
From now on what we need is a steady state of affairs in<br />
which people go about their work in the ordinary way, do their<br />
buying in the ordinary way, and the retail stores are able to<br />
clear their stocks and pay their bills to the wholesalers, and<br />
the wholesalers to the manufactures, and the manufacturers set<br />
about replenishing their own stocks by manufacturing processes<br />
and employment. All this is a simple enough thing to say. But<br />
the process doesn't begin if you have people in Australia who are<br />
undermining the confidence of the 97 people in 100.<br />
This is a , reat task, a great task, and it is a task for all<br />
of us. I am myself an unlimited optimist about the future. I<br />
know that somebody may say that over the next month or two months<br />
things may not be very satisfactory. I don't expect things to<br />
happen overnight. But I believe in my bones that by this time<br />
next year many of us will be wondering what the argument was<br />
about; and most, if not all, of the 97 will be wondering what the<br />
argument was about. And the other three working alongside of<br />
them will have occasion to be glad for what has been done.<br />
This is not a crisis in the economy. The economy of<br />
Australia has never been stronger. Anybody who looks at it with<br />
any detachment and even I can do that occasionally will say,<br />
as the people looking at us from around the world will say, that<br />
the economy of our country has never been in a sounder position;<br />
and that the measures that have booeen taken have been good, and<br />
sensible, and profitable measures from the point of view of<br />
Australia. </p>
<p>11.<br />
The only crisis that exists, and I admit its existence and<br />
call on you to join with me in destroying it is a crisis of<br />
confidence. Isn't it a romarkable thing that a people like us in<br />
Australia so rich in material things, so high in our living<br />
standards, so possessed of advantages that most of the countries<br />
in the world envy beyond words, should even begin to think of<br />
undermn -ng our own strength by losing confidence in ourselves?<br />
I had always thought that the people of Australia had irmmuense<br />
confidence in themselves. I know that when I go abroad from time<br />
to time to represent this country in the councils of the world I<br />
find myself able to speak with confidence because I speak for a<br />
confident country. And this is no bad thing for us. ( Applause)<br />
Sir, that is really half of what I intended to say to you<br />
but it is, perhaps, all that I needed to say to you that had<br />
importance. This is a splendid opportunity, tonight, to have<br />
this great meeting of people who work, of people who are<br />
supporters, who have loyalty and zeal, a great opportunity to say<br />
to you " Don't you lose any confidence yourselves; don't you<br />
become weakened in your resolution". Because if there is one<br />
thing about which I have taken a private vow, and now take a<br />
* public one, it is that Ipropose once more at the next election,<br />
to lead this party to victory. ( Applause3 </p>
