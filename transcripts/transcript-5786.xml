PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 1 APRIL -1982<br />
PAINTERS AND DOCKERS ROYAL COMMISSION<br />
TERMS OF REFERENCE AMENDMENTS<br />
The Commonwealth Government has decided to amend the terms of<br />
reference of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the activities<br />
of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union.<br />
The changes place beyond doubt the powers of the Commission to<br />
investigate the activities of the Union and persons associated<br />
with it that give rise to possible breaches of law. This<br />
measure is in response to the Commission's Interim Report'No. 3.<br />
tabled in the House of Representatives on 25 February 1982,<br />
which disclosed the wide ranging nature of the practices uncovered<br />
so far.<br />
Proceedings have recently been initiated in the Federal Court<br />
challenging the Commission's authority in relation to the<br />
investigation of taxation matters, and seeking to-restrain<br />
the Comm!,-ission from inquiring further into certain aspects of<br />
the tax avoidance schemes which were disclosed in the Commission's<br />
third Interim Report.<br />
No changes have been made to the terms of reference given to<br />
the Co7= irissior. by the Victorian Government. </p>
