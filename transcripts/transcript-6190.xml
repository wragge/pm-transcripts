CHECK AGAINST DELTIVERY PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER HOBART CHAMBER OF COMMERCE<br />
31 AUGUST 1983<br />
MR PRESIDENT,-THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR GOVERNMENT CAME TO OFFICE WITH<br />
THE ECONOMY UNDERGOING ITS WORST RECESSION IN FIFTY YEARS.<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT HAD RISEN By 263,000 DURING THE PREVIOUS TWELVE<br />
MONTHS AND INFLATION STOOD AT 11.5 PER CENT DOUBLE THE<br />
0. E. C. D. AVERAGE. INTEREST RATES REMAINED UNACCEPTABLY HIGH<br />
AND THE HEARTLESS, UNCARING APPLICATION BY OUR PREDECESSORS<br />
OF A 11FIGHT INFLATION FIRST" APPROACH HAD LAID WASTE TO<br />
LARGE AREAS OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY.<br />
My GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED TO GET AUSTRALIA BACK TO<br />
WORK, TO REDRESS* THE RAMPANT INEQUALITIES ENGENDERED BY THE<br />
PREVIOUS SEVEN YEARS OF NEGLECT AND INDIFFERENCE, AND TO<br />
BRING AUSTRALIANS TOGETHER AGAINTHE<br />
BUDGET WE BROUGHT DOWN LAST WEEK EMBODIES THESE<br />
OBJECTIVES-IT REORDERS PRIORITIES IN THE WAY YOU WOULD<br />
EXPECT OF A REFORMIST GOVERNMENT DEDICATED TO RESTORING<br />
EQUITY AND FAIRNESS To AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY-IMPORTANTLY IT<br />
ALSO SOUGHT TO NURTURE AND DEVELOP THE ECOINOMY TO THE POINT </p>
<p>2.<br />
WHERE CONSUMER SPENDING AND BUSINESS INVESTMENT MIGHT REGAIN<br />
THEIR APPROPRIATE MOMENTUM. BY ESTABLISHING THE BASIS FOR A<br />
SUSTAINED RECOVERY WE AIM TO WHITTLE AWAY THE QUEUES OF THE<br />
UNEMPLOYEDTHE TASK WE CONFRONTED IN PREPARING THE BUDGET WAS<br />
DAUNTING-IN THE FACE OF LARGE INCREASES IN DOMESTIC COSTS,<br />
INTERNATIONAL RECESSION, AND HIGH DOMESTIC AND OVERSEAS<br />
INTERE ST RATES, PRIVATE INVESTMEN4T DURING 1982-83 HAD FALLEN<br />
SHARPLY AND PRIVATE CONSUMPTION SPENDING WEAKENED.<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT HAD SPIRALLED TO RATES NOT EXPERIE-NCED SINCE<br />
THE 1930' S AS BUSINESS RESPONDED TO HIGH LABOUR COSTS, A<br />
SLUMP IN PROFITABILITY AND WEAKENING DEMAND. GROSS DOMESTIC<br />
PRODUCT WAS ALSO FALLING AT AN ALARMING RATE -DROPPING BY<br />
3.9 PER CENT IN REAL TERMS IN THE YEAR TO THE JUNE QUARTER<br />
OF 1982/ 83. TASMANIA WAS NOT IMMUNE FROM THE DOWNTURN. INDEED<br />
ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN MARKETS FOR A NUMBER OF TASMANIA's<br />
MAIN PRODUCTS MEANT THAT TASMANIA SUFFERED THE EFFECTS OF<br />
THE INTERNATIONAL RECESSION EARLIER THAN DID THE REST OF<br />
AUSTRALIA. A YEAR AGO TASMANIA HAD' BY FAR THE HIGHEST<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF ALL AUSTRALIAN STATES; ITS LEVEL OF<br />
EMPLOYMENT WAS FALLING. DURING 1981/ 82 THERE WAS ALSO A<br />
PARTICULARLY SHARP DECLINE IN HOUSING ACTIVITY IN TASMANIAMORE<br />
SEVERE THAN THE GENERAL DECLINE THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA.<br />
As WELL, TASMANIA IN THE PERIOD MARCH QUARTER 1982 TO MARCH </p>
<p>QUARTER 1983 EXPERIENCED THE SHARPEST FALL IN PRIVATE NEW<br />
FIXED CAPITAL EXPENDITURE OF ANY AUSTRALIAN STATE.<br />
THE SITUATION FOR TASMANIA HAS IMPROVED A LITTLE IN<br />
RECENT MONTHS-OVER THE LAST YEAR TASMANIA' S UNEMPLOYMENT<br />
RATE. HAS DETERIORATED THE LEAST AMONG AUSTRALIAN STATEHOUSING<br />
ACTIVITY HAS BEEN PICKING UP IN RECENT MONTHS, AS IT<br />
H AS ELSEWHERE IN AUSTRALIA. THE FALL IN PRIVATE NEW FIXED<br />
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE IN TASMANIA WAS LESS IN THE LAST QUARTER<br />
THAN IN OTHER STATES AND IS EXPECTED TO BE LESS OVER THE<br />
COMING YEAR. TASMANIA'S ECONOMIC SITUATION IS DIFFICULT, BUT NO<br />
MORE THAN THE REST OF AUSTRALIA AT PRESENT. THERE ARE GOOD<br />
REASONS TO EXPECT TASMANIA TO SHARE IN THE EXPANSION OF<br />
GROWTH OVER THE NEXT YEAR THAT THE BUDGET PREDICTS FOR<br />
AUSTRALIA AS A WHOLE-NEVERTHELESS THE SERIOUSNESS OF<br />
TASMANIA'S PROBLEMS PROVIDE AMPLE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE<br />
SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING<br />
DIRECTED To TASMANIA IN THE LAST BUDGET.<br />
COMMONWEALTH GRANTS To TASMANIA FOR HOUSING WILL<br />
RISE BY NEARLY 38% IN 1983-84 TO $ 24 MILLION. EXPENDITURE<br />
ON ROADS UNDER THE ROAD GRANTS ACT,' THE BICENTENNIAL PROGRAM<br />
AND THE JOBS 0ON LOCAL ROADS PROGRAM WILL RISE By 40% IN<br />
1983-84 TO OVER $ 50 MILLION. EXPENDITURE UNDER THE<br />
COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM AND THE WAGE PAUSE PROGRAM WILL<br />
TOTAL OVER $ 10 MILLION-IN TOTAL COMMONWEALTH PAYMENTS TO </p>
<p>TASMANIA ( INCLUDING BORROWINGS SUBJECT OT LOAN COUNCIL<br />
APPROVAL) WILL RISE BY 1' 4.6% A VERY SUBSTANTIAL RISE IN<br />
REAL TERMSMy GOVERNMENT HAS PROMISED THAT No TASMANIAN WOULDBE<br />
DISADVANTAGED OR BE OUT OF WORK AS A RESULT OF THE<br />
STOPPING OF THE GORDON BELOW FRANKLIN DAM AND THAT<br />
TASMANIA's POWER NEEDS-WOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF-WE WILL<br />
STAND BY THAT PLEDGEALREADY WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO PROVIDE-FINANCIAL<br />
ASSISTANCE To TASMANIA IN RESPECT-OF ALTERNATIVE EMPLOYMENT<br />
PROJECTS AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR EMPLOYEES AND<br />
CONTRACTORS WHO CANNOT BE REDEPLOYED TO ALTERNATIVE PROJECTS<br />
IN THE SHORT TERM. DISCUSSIONS AT OFFICIAL LEVEL ON FURTHER<br />
ARRANGEMENTS FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ARE TO TAKE PLACE IN<br />
HOBART LATER THIS WEEK. To COVER THE IMMEDIATE REQUIREMENTS<br />
AN AMOUNT OF $ 30 MILLION IS PROVIDIED FOR PAYMENTS TO THE<br />
STATE I* N 1983-84 FOR THESE PURPOSESOTHER<br />
ISSUES ARISING FROM 1-HE TERMINATION OF THE<br />
POWER DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING THAT . or TASMANIA's FUTURE<br />
ELECTRICITY REQUIREMENTS, WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF FURTHER<br />
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE TASMANIAN STATE GOVERNMENT. As You<br />
WOULD ALL APPRECIATE, A FULL, LONG-TERM PLAN FOR TASMANIA'S<br />
POWER NEEDS PROPERLY CONCEIVED AND COSTED -CANNOT BE PUT<br />
TOGETHER IN A MA* TTER OF WEEKS. A STARTING POINT MUST BE THE </p>
<p>TASMANIAN GOVERNMENT GRANTING COMPLETE ACCESS TO THE HEC's<br />
FORECAST OF FUTURE POWER NEEDS. As WITH ANY FORECAST, IT<br />
WILL HAVE TO BE THOROUGHLY TESTED AND THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE<br />
IN CO-OPERATION WITH THE STATE GOVERNMENT. BUT THIS MATTER<br />
HAS HIGH PRIORITY-WE ARE SEEKING A RESULT THAT MAKES SENSE<br />
FOR AUSTRALIA AS A WHOLE AT THE SAME TIME AS IT SUPPORTS<br />
TASMANIA'S LEGITIMATE DEVELOPMENT NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR GOVERNMENT IS A GOVERNMENT FOR<br />
ALL AUSTRALIANS. WE AIM TO BUILD A BETTER, MORE EQUITABLE<br />
AND MORE PROSPEROUS AUSTRALIA.<br />
OUR FIRST BUDGET WAS A RESPONSIBLE STEP IN THIS<br />
DIRECTION. IT GAVE SUBSTANTIAL EFFECT TO OUR MAJOR PROMISES<br />
OF GETTING A FIRM CONTEXT FOR NON-INFLATIONARY GROWTH. AT<br />
THE SAME TIME A SUBSTANTIAL REORDERING OF THE REGRESSIVE<br />
POLICIES OF THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED AND<br />
MORE ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO THOSE SECTORS AND<br />
PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY MOST IN NEED.<br />
THE NEW PROGRAMS PUT IN PLACE BY THIS BUDGET ARE<br />
VERY SPECIFICALLY ORIENTED TO GIVING MOST ASSISTANCE TO<br />
THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY MOST IN NEED. ABOVE ALL THOSE MOST<br />
IN NEED ARE THE UNEMPLOYED. HENCE THE EMPHASIS IN THE<br />
BUDGET ON MEASURES TO-PROMOTE EMPLOYMENT DIRECTLY. THE<br />
COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM ADDRESSES THE SPECIAL PROBLEMS<br />
OF THE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED, WHILE CREATING OR IMPROVING </p>
<p>ASSETS OF PERMANENT VALUE TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THE<br />
EXPANSION OF CAPITAL WORKS AND MAINTENANCE EXPENDITURE, AND<br />
THE MEASURES TO ASSIST THE HOUSING INDUSTRY, WILL MAKE<br />
SUBSTANTIAL DIRECT CONTRIBUTIONS TO EMPLOYMENT-OVERALL,<br />
THE BUDGET PAPERS ANTICIPATE A REVERSAL OF THE DECLINE IN<br />
EMPLOYMENT OVER THE LAST FINANCIAL YEAR ( CONTINUING THE MORE<br />
FAVOURABLE PATTERN SINCE APRIL), WITH EMPLOYMENT EXPANDING<br />
BY ONE AND A HALF PER * CENT THROUGH THE YEAR-WE HOPE WE CAN<br />
DO EVEN BETTER, AND WILL DO WHAT WE CAN TO ENSURE A BETTER<br />
RESULT. BUT AT LEAST THIS OUTCOM E WOULD BE A SUBSTANTIAL<br />
STEP FORWARD AFTER THE REVERSALS OF THE PAST TWO YEARSTHE<br />
INCREASE IN EMPLOYMENT EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT<br />
YEAR IS ONLY A BEGINNING-MANY OF OUR POLICIES ARE DIRECTED<br />
AT ENSURING THE DURABILITY OF RECOVERY INTO THE NEXT<br />
FINANCIAL YEAR AND WELL BEYOND-STRONG GROWTH OVER SEVERAL<br />
YEARS IS REQUIRED TO MAKE ADEQUATE HEADWAY INTO OUR<br />
DISASTROUS INHERITANCE OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENTBEYdND<br />
THE EMPHASIS ON EMPLOYMENT, THE BUDGET<br />
EFFECTS A SUBSTANTIAL RE-ORDERIJG OF PRIORITIES IN THE<br />
DIRECTION OF PROVIDING FOR THOSE IN GREATEST NEED. THE<br />
ESTABLISHMENT NEXT YEAR OF MEDICARE WILL SEE THE RETURN OF<br />
UNIVERSAL, EQUITABLE HEALTH COVER. A SIGNIFICANT REAL<br />
INCREASE OF RESOURCES -TO BE PROVIDED ON A NEEDS BASIS<br />
HAS ALSO BEEN ALLOCATED FOR EDUCATION. REAL INCREA SES HAVE<br />
ALSO BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFICIARIES<br />
MOST IN NEED-</p>
<p>7.<br />
PROGRAMS OF THIS KIND HAVE ONLY BEEN MADE POSSIBLE<br />
BY A QUITE FAR-REACHING REORDERING OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT<br />
EXPENDITURE PRIORITIES. THEY ALSO CRUCIALLY DEPEND ON<br />
S. UCCESSFUL RESTORATION OF THE ECONOMY TO THE PATH OF GROWTH<br />
WITH LOWER INFLATION. THIS IN TURN HINGES ON THE CREATION<br />
OF AN. ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE TO SUSTAINED GROWTH AND<br />
CONFIDENCE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.<br />
OUR BUDGET SHOULD CONTRIBUTE SUBSTANTIALLY TO REAL<br />
GROWTH OVER 1983-84. WE EXPECT THE ECONOMY TO GROW IN<br />
1983-84 BY 3 PER CENT AS COMPARED WITH A DECLINE OF 2 PER<br />
CENT IN 1982-83. BECAUSE ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUALLY PICK UP<br />
PACE THROUGH THE YEAR, GROWTH AS MEASURED FROM THE JUNE 1983<br />
QUARTER TO THE JUNE 1984 QUARTER IS LIKELY TO BE AN EVEN<br />
MORE IMPRESSIVE 5 PER CENT FOR NON-FARM GDP AND OVER 6 PER<br />
CENT FOR TOTAL GDP. THIS PICK UP IN ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO<br />
BE ACCOMPANIED BY CONTINUED STRONG GROWTH IN PUBLIC SECTOR<br />
FINAL DEMAND, CONTINUED WEAK PRIVATE SECTOR FINAL DEMAND, A<br />
MODEST RISE IN EXPORTS, A FURTHER SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN<br />
IMPORTS, A REBOUND IN FARM OUTPUT, AND MODERATE GROWTH IN<br />
REAL NON-FARM PRODUCT.<br />
IMPORTANTLY THE APPROACH ADOPTED BY MY GOVERNMENT<br />
HAS SOUGHT TO COMBINE AN ADEQUATE, BUT NOT EXCESSIVE PUBLIC<br />
BOOST TO ACTIVITY WITH STIMULUS FOR NECESSARY PRIVATE SECTOR<br />
EXPANSION. IN CIRCUMSTANCES OF LOW DEMAND AND CAPACITY<br />
UNDERUTILIZATION THE GOVERNMENT AT THIS STAGE MUST HELP </p>
<p>MAINTAIN THE LEVEL OF DEMAND. BUT IT HAS DONE SO IN THE<br />
FIRM EXPECTATION THAT, AS THE RECOVERY GATHERS STRENGTH, ITS<br />
OWN RATE OF INCREASE IN OUTLAYS WILL HAVE TO BE REDUCED<br />
CONSIDERABLY. A DURABLE ECONOMIC RECOVERY REQUIRES, AS ESSENTIAL<br />
PREREQUISITES, BOTH CONTINUING WAGE MODERATION IN THE PERIOD<br />
IMMEDIATELY AHEAD AND AN ON-GOING EFFORT TO REDUCE<br />
STRUCTURAL PUBLIC SECTOR DEFICITS AND BORROWING REQUIREMENTS<br />
AS RECOVERY PROCEEDS. THE POLICY FRAMEWORK NOW ESTABLISHED<br />
BY MY GOVERNMENT ENSURES THAT EACH OF THESE ASPECTS IS NOT<br />
ONLY FULLY APPRECIATED BUT ALSO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSED.<br />
THE DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN MEETING THESE<br />
PREREQUISITIES ARE NOT UNDERESTIMATED. THEY ARE ONLY<br />
MATCHED BY MY GOVERNMENT'S DETERMINATION TO SEE THAT THEY<br />
ARE MET. LET ME TAKE EACH IN TURN.,<br />
FIRST, WAGE RESTRAINT. THE BUDGET ASSUMES THAT FOR<br />
1983-84 AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS WILL INCREASE BY ABOUT 7 PER<br />
CENT. THIS REPRESENTS A MARKED SLOWING FROM THE INCREASE OF<br />
ELEVEN AND A QUARTER PER CENT IN 1982-83, BUT IS IN LINE<br />
WITH THE ANTICIPATED CONSUMER PRICE INDEX RISE OF ABOUT<br />
SEVEN AND A HALF PER CENT FOR THE PERIOD. THESE ASSUMPTIONS<br />
PRESUME THAT THE AUSTRALIAN UNION MOVEMENT WILL ADHERE, AS I<br />
BELIEVE IT WILL, TO THE PRICES AND INCOMES ACCORD. </p>
<p>THE ACCORD RECOGNISED THE CRUCIAL NEXUS BETWEEN<br />
WAGE MODERATION, INFLATION AND EMPLOYMENT GROWTH. IF<br />
UNSUSTAINABLE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES ARE NOT TO BE IMPOSED<br />
ON THE ECONOMY, IT IS VITAL THAT WAGE INCREASES ONLY BE<br />
THROUGH THE CENTRAL WAGE FIXATION DETERMINATIONS WHICH<br />
RELATE TO PRICE MOVEMENTS AT SIX MONTHLY INTERVALS. THERE<br />
SHOULD BE NO PLACE FOR ADDITIONAL WAGE INCREASES BASED<br />
SIMPLY ON THE INDUSTRIAL MUSCLE ENJOYED BY PARTICULAR,<br />
CLAIMANTS. IF EXCESSIVE DEMANDS ARE FORCED, THE GOVERNMENT<br />
MAY HAVE LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO REVERT TO THE BLUNT,<br />
TRADITIONAL INSTRUMENTS OF TIGHTER MONETARY AND FISCAL<br />
POLICY TO RESTRAIN INFLATION. THE COST IN TERMS OF REDUCED<br />
ACTIVITY AND INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT WOULD BE INTOLERABLY<br />
HIGH. WAGE AND PRICE DEVELOPMENTS MUST BE CONSTRAINED<br />
WITHIN THE BROAD GUIDELINES SET BY THE PRICES AND INCOMES<br />
ACCORD IF THE GOVERNMENT IS TO BE ABLE TO PERSIST WITH ITS<br />
EXPANSIONARY FISCAL POLICY. IT MUST, BE RECOGNISED THAT IT<br />
IS IN THE INTERESTS OF BOTH WORKERS AND THE UNEMPLOYED TO<br />
ENSURE THAT THERE IS RESTRAINED GROWTH IN NOMINAL WAGES,<br />
ALONG WITH HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY AND PRODUCTION, SO THAT<br />
COMMUNITY LIVING STANDARDS CAN RISE' IN REAL TERMS.<br />
IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNISE THAT CONTINUING<br />
STIMULUS TO ECONOMIC ACTIVITY CANNOT BE PROVIDED BY<br />
SUCCESSIVE INCREASES IN BUDGET DEFICITS. </p>
<p>THIS YEAR'S BUDGET DEFICIT HAS BEEN PITCHED AT A<br />
LEVEL WHICH WILL PROVIDE A SUBSTAN4TIAL DIRECT STIMULUS TO<br />
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, WHILE AVOIDING EXCESSIVE PRESSURES ON<br />
FINANCIAL MARKETS. IT NOW ACCOUNTS FOR NEARLY 5 PER CENT OF<br />
FORECAST GDP.<br />
MANY OF THE DECISIONS WE MADE IN THE MAY STATEMENT<br />
AND IN THIS BUDGET WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF SIGNIFICA. NTLY<br />
REDUCING THE STRUCTURAL COMPONENT OF THE DEFICIT. THE<br />
TAXATION OF SUPERANNUATION, THE RE-IMPOSITION OF AN INCOME<br />
TEST ON OVER-7O's PENSIONS, THE REINTRODUCTION. OF AN ASSETS<br />
TEST ON PENSIONS, AND INDEXATION Of TRADITIONAL EXCISES<br />
SHOULD TOGETHER MAKE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO REDUCING<br />
THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IN FUTURE YEARS. THE CYCLICAL<br />
COMPONENT OF THE DEFICIT CAN ALSO BE EXPECTED TO FALL AS<br />
ACTIVITY INCREASES-INCREASED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WILL SEE<br />
GOVERNMENT REVENUES RISE AND SHOULD CAUSE DEMANDS ON THE<br />
OUTLAYS SIDE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS TO DECLINEACCORDINGLY<br />
BOTH THE OPERATION OF TH ! E STRUCTURAL COMPONENT<br />
. OF THE DEFICIT FLOWING FROM THE DELIBERATE DECISIONS OF MY<br />
GOVERNMENT AND THE WORKING OUT OF THE CYCLICAL COMPONENTS<br />
POINT TO THE POSSIBILITY OF SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN THE<br />
DEFICIT AS WE GO OUT OF 1983-84 AND INTO 1984/ 85.<br />
FINANCING THE DEFICIT WILL BE HANDLED WITH<br />
PARTICULAR CARE. WHILE WE CANNOT INSULATE OURSELVES<br />
COMPLETELY FROM FINANCIAL PRESSURES ABROAD AND IT IS QUITE </p>
<p>11.<br />
POSSIBLE THERE WILL BE SUCH PRESSURES -WE MUST DO WHAT WE<br />
CAN WITHIN OUR OWN FINANCIAL MARKETS TO AVOID EXACERBATING<br />
PRESSURES ON INTEREST RATES.<br />
THE PROBLEM IS MANAGEABLE OVER 1983-84 AS NET<br />
CORPORATE BORROWING IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE, INCREASED PUBLIC<br />
SECTOR BORROWING CAN BE SUSTAINED IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES.<br />
THE* RESULTS ANNOUNCED LAST NIGHT OF THE LATEST $ 1500 MILLION<br />
BOND TENDER DEMONSTRATED THIS. IT PRODUCED YIELDS SOMEWHAT<br />
BELOW-THOSE OF THE LAST MUCH SMALLER TENDER AND MUCH LOWER THAN<br />
THOSE PREVAILING THIS TIME LAST YEAR, BIDDING ON THIS LATEST<br />
TENDER EASILY COVERED THE STOCK AVAILABLE, BUT AS PRIVATE<br />
INVESTMENT INCREASES WITH RECOVERY THE COMMONWEALTH WILL HAVE<br />
TO ADJUST ITS DEMANDS AND MAKE ROOM. IN THIS WAY WE AIM TO<br />
ENSURE THAT, AS FAR As POSSIBLE, UPWARD PRESSURE WOULD BE<br />
AGAINST THE INTERESTS OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR, THE PUBLIC SECTOR<br />
AND THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND WOULD JEOPARDISE THE RECOVERY<br />
WE NOW SEE BEGINNING.<br />
A NOTEABLE FEATURE OF my GOVER1NMENT'IS BUDGET WAS<br />
THE MANNER IN WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT NEW HIGH<br />
PRIORITY PROGRAMS WITHOUT MAJOR GENERAL TAX INCREASES-IN<br />
PART THIS WAS DUE TO AN APPROACH WHICH SOUGHT TO ENSURE THAT<br />
THOSE WHO HAD NOT BEEN PAYING THEIfA FAIR SHARE OF TAX BEGAN<br />
TO DO So. HENCE THE EMPHASIS ON RECOUPING THE REVENUE OWED<br />
BY THOSE INDULGING IN TAX AVOIDANCE PRACTICES, THE<br />
COLLECTION OF TAX FROM THOSE EVADING IT, LIMITING THE<br />
POTENTIAL FOR TAX AVOIDANCE BY CONVERSION OF INCOME TO<br />
CAPITAL GAINS, AND REMOVING MORE OF THE SPECIAL CONCESSIONS<br />
TO SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS. THE VERY SIZEABLE BURDEN </p>
<p>ALREADY IMPOSED BY DIRECT TAXATION WAS NOT ADDED TO. RATHER<br />
AN APPROACH GUIDED BY CONSIDERATIONS OF EFFICIENCY AND<br />
EQUITY PREVAILEDA VERY CLEAR EXAMPLE OF ECONOMIC RATIONALITY AT<br />
WORK WAS THE DECISION TO INDEX EXCISE RATES. DURING THE<br />
PAST DECADE THE PROPORTION PROVIDED BY EXCISE TO THE GENERAL<br />
REVENUE DECLINED FROM 13% To THROUGH INDEXATION WE HAVE<br />
MADE SURE THAT OVER TIME THEY MAINTAIN THEIR REAL VALUE AND<br />
ARE NOT ERODED BY THE PROCESSES OF INFLATION-WE HAVE PUT<br />
ASIDE THE DESTABILISING AND OFTEN ARBITARY PATTERN OF LARGE<br />
DISCRETIONARY INCREASES WHICH WAS THE WAY IN THE PAST. WHAT<br />
WE HAVE-DONE SHOULD HAVE-BEEN DONE MUCH EARLIERTHE<br />
ALTERNATIVE TO MOVING TO MAINTAIN THE REAL<br />
VALUE OF THE EXCISE, WOULD HAVE BEEN TO LAY GREATER DEMANDS<br />
ON OTHER FORMS OF TAXATION. THE IMPACT COULD HAVE BEEN<br />
QUITE DISTORTIONARY. THE POSITION NOW REACHED POINTS TO THE NEED FOR<br />
DETAILED EXAMINATION OF THE ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL NATIONAL<br />
REVENUE BASE. WIDELY BASED COMMUNITY CONSIDERATION OF WHAT<br />
IS APPROPRIATE IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY AND EQUITY<br />
WOULD BE TIMELY. THIS MIGHT ENABLE' SENSIBLE AND FAIR<br />
CHANGES TO BE MOUNTED, NOT IN A PIECEMEAL FASHION, BUT AS<br />
PART OF A WELL-CONSIDERED, PROPERLY INTEGRATED PACKAGE-</p>
<p>13.<br />
IN THE MEANTIME MY GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO<br />
PRESS AHEAD WITH ITS EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT WHERE BENEFITS<br />
ARE PAID TO THE NEEDY, IT IS IN FACT THE NEEDY WHO RECEIVE<br />
THEM. THIS IS THE POINT OF THE PROPOSED PENSION ASSETS<br />
TEST. THE ALARM ENGENDERED BY THAT IS UNFOUNDED.<br />
APART FROM HOME, CAR, BOAT, CARAVAN, JEWELLERY,<br />
FURNITURE AND OTHER PERSONAL EFFECTS, A SINGLE PENSIONER CAN<br />
HAVE $ 17,000 AND STILL RECEIVE THE FULL PENSION AND UP TO<br />
$ 106,000 AND STILL RECEIVE A PART-PENSION. A MARRIED COUPLE<br />
CAN HAVE $ 28,000 AND STILL RECEIVE THE FULL PENSION AND UP<br />
TO $ 177,000 AND STILL RECEIVE PART-PENSION. MOST PENSIONERS<br />
WILL NOT BE AFFECTED AT. ALL. SOME WILL ACTUALLY GAIN. ONLY<br />
THOSE PENSIONERS WITH SUBSTANTIAL ASSETS, WHO ARE<br />
ARTIFICIALLY AVOIDING THE CURRENT INCOME TEST FOR PENSIONS,<br />
WILL BE AFFECTED IN ANY SIGNIFICANT WAY.<br />
WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS PAYING OUT TO THE ELDERLY<br />
AND OTHERS IN NEED, THE PAYMENT MUST BE RELATED TO NEEDOTHERWISE<br />
THE WHOLE OF OUR RESOURCES ARE GOING TO BE<br />
DISTORTED AND THE INTERESTS OF ALL'AUSTRALIANS PERVERTEDTHERE<br />
ARE STILL TOO MANY AUSTRALIANS FORCED TO<br />
LIVE AT AN UNACCEPTABLY LOW STANDARD. THEIR SITUATION MUST<br />
BE ADDRESSED. WE SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO DIRECT WELFARE<br />
PAYMENTS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT GENUINELY IN NEED. TO DO<br />
SO REDUCES THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO HELP THE TRULY<br />
UNDERPRIVILEGED. </p>
<p>14.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT IS ABSOLUTELY FIRM ON THIS POINT. WE<br />
WERE ELECTED TO ARREST THE DECLINE IN THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
ECONOMY, TO REVERSE THE TREND TOWARDS GREATER INEQUALITY IN<br />
AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY AND TO BRING AUSTRALIANS TOGETHER AGAINTHE<br />
MANDATE WAS CLEAR AND WE HAVE MADE MAJOR STRIDES TOWARDS<br />
ITS REALIZATION. A GREATER SENSE OF NATIONAL PURPOSE AROUND THE<br />
RESTORATION OF GROWTH IS NEVERTHELESS STILL NEEDED. THIS<br />
WILL ONLY BE POSSIBLE IF THE BENEFITS OF GROWTH, AND THE<br />
INEVITABLE COSTS, ARE SHARED EQUITABLY.<br />
