PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH DEAN BANKS, DENNIS DONOHUE<br />
AND ROSS STEVENSON, ' LAWYERS, GUNS AND MONEY', RADIO 3AW<br />
19 MARCH 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
BANKS: It's a very good morning to the Prime Minister Mr<br />
Bob Hawke. Good morning and thank you for joining us.<br />
PM: Pleasure Dean.<br />
BANKS: Thank you for bringing your entourage.<br />
PM: Good. Well I like following your entourage around<br />
from station to station too.<br />
BANKS: You were locked in mortal combat there for a<br />
moment weren't you, or verbal combat with my colleague<br />
Dennis? PM: I know he's a paid up member of the Labor Party and<br />
he's wearing a Liberal badge. I mean, as he said, he'll<br />
lose his preselection for when I finally leave Wills.<br />
INTERVIEWER: I used to work out there Mr Hawke, but I'm<br />
impressed by your chunky gold jewellery and your<br />
impersonation of a real estate agent on our programme.<br />
It's never struck me before that you had this side<br />
interest. PM: No, no, there's nothing chunky about it. Look at<br />
it. INTERVIEWER: What a very nice ring it is. Tell me,<br />
you're in the last week and I suppose you're running<br />
down. I noticed a very interesting little snippet in The<br />
Age this morning. I notice someone from the Victorian<br />
ALP complaining about the fact that the polls have put<br />
the ALP five percent ahead in Victoria. Is this a new<br />
art form in politics?<br />
PM: No, it's not but there's a feeling in regard to, and<br />
I won't mention the poll in question, but there is a<br />
feeling amongst some of our people that at times it's,<br />
you know, in the period the penultimate poll. They<br />
make it a bit too good for us and then wrack it back just<br />
before the election. I don't know whether there's<br />
anything in that. </p>
<p>INTERVIEWER: Are you talking about the polls<br />
deliberately inflating your lead to create a false sense<br />
of security?<br />
PM: Well I'm not making that accusation. There is a<br />
feeling in some quarters that it happens. But I've got<br />
no proof so I don't say anything about it.<br />
INTERVIEWER: What's the Rod Cameron poll say Prime<br />
Minister? PM: I'm not uncomfortable with the Rod Cameron poll.<br />
But I still make the point Dean, as I have, I never take<br />
any election for granted. Never.<br />
INTERVIEWER: I think has actually put one over here<br />
on the Japanese issue because most Australians in my view<br />
are racist, they don't like the Japanese coming out here<br />
and developing our land and so on. And for you to tackle<br />
S him on this issue you're making a lot of good headlines<br />
in the newspapers but you're going to lose votes on it.<br />
PM: Well I, in politics I suppose in this sense,<br />
that this is one thing that I will never compromise on,<br />
and you have to compromise in politics on some things, I<br />
acknowledge that, but there is one thing I will never in<br />
any circumstances compromise on and that is the question<br />
of race, racism. For the Opposition, now after this has<br />
been on the table for well over two years, and it being<br />
known that written strictly into the principles that<br />
have to guide those examining it, is a strict requirement<br />
against any concept of an enclave, for the people just<br />
six days before an election to come out and say without<br />
any study in detail of the proposal, and Mr Peacock<br />
having rejected in September an offer to be briefed on<br />
it, to come out and say they are against a proposal which<br />
would, could bring technology to Australia, from<br />
Japan but from Europe and the United States, to say they<br />
are against this because it could establish a Japanese<br />
enclave is something that I will not walk away from.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Speaking about technology, imagine that<br />
there was a technological breakdown on Saturday afternoon<br />
and where you're going to watch the result that you're<br />
told that you can only have one camera focused on one<br />
seat for those results, what would be the seat that you<br />
would choose to look at as the, hate to use the word,<br />
litmus test for the election?<br />
PM: That's a good question Ross. I just need to give it<br />
a little bit of thought because I think there are<br />
different factors operating in different states.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Can I give you a lead, Malcolm Mackerras<br />
said he'd be looking at Melbourne Ports. </p>
<p>PM: Melbourne Ports. Well that wouldn't be a bad one.<br />
I mean it'd give you an idea of how the vote was going in<br />
Victoria. People are saying that Victoria is important<br />
and of course it is. But we're doing very well in<br />
Queensland, Tasmania, New South Wales, I think we're<br />
holding Western Australia, so I think we can pick up<br />
seats we don't hold in Queensland and Tasmania for<br />
instance. So one would like to be looking at those. But<br />
if you were wanting to get an idea of how Victoria was<br />
going, yes, I wouldn't disagree it was a good idea to<br />
look at how Melbourne Ports was going.<br />
INTERVIEWER: is Melbourne Ports.<br />
PM: There are two or three Melbourne seats you could<br />
pick out would give you an idea of how you were going.<br />
But I don't by saying that think that we'll lose<br />
Melbourne Ports. I'm quite confident of holding it.<br />
INTERVIEWER: You say you take a high moral stance on<br />
this race issue and the enclave, the Japanese enclave<br />
issue, but what about when these people contrive things<br />
in your favour. Like when you had a hole in one in the<br />
dark on the golf course, just had a recent ten-pin<br />
bowling experience where they pulled the rug under the<br />
pins just<br />
PM: ( inaudible)<br />
INTERVIEWER: just before the ball<br />
PM: Did they?<br />
INTERVIEWER: you're not a lawyer, but it's<br />
alleged, PM: I would have thought you're on very very dangerous<br />
ground. Have you got good cover for defamation?<br />
INTERVIEWER: I don't want to contribute to your next<br />
pool or your next tennis court. I hear you've sold your<br />
Sandringham home and you're no longer a Melbournite.<br />
PM: No, that's not right. I represent Melbourne. I<br />
represent Melbourne.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Tell us about the hole in one. Who was the<br />
witness? PM: The witness. It wasn't in the dark, it was on the<br />
16th at Yowani.<br />
INTERVIEWER: In fairness, a par three.<br />
PM: In fairness, a par three. I'm a good golfer but I'm<br />
yet to think that I could get a hole in one on a par<br />
four. </p>
<p>INTERVIEWER: I'm a little bit confused about your golf<br />
skills because I do see you on television from time to<br />
time playing golf and to be quite fair the swing is not<br />
as fluid as one would hope.<br />
PM: Mate, to be quite fair, do you know how they follow<br />
me at golf? When I whack one off the first tee, down the<br />
middle, 230 yards, then pick up my five iron and whack it<br />
an extra y'know you don't see those shots. They wait<br />
until the fourth hole when I<br />
INTERVIEWER: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Too right.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Were you in Melbourne yesterday for the<br />
additions of the Sunday papers?<br />
PM: I was in Melbourne yesterday for the additions of<br />
the Sunday papers Ross, yes I was.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Well because, you know, there were stories<br />
going around at the time that Rupert Murdoch got The<br />
Herald and Weekly Times back, that this was in return for<br />
a deal that would guarantee Rupert's support. Now given<br />
the McCrann articles of last week and the editorial of<br />
The Sunday Herald saying vote Liberal, do you think he's<br />
gone back on his word?<br />
PM: Well if there were anything in the story, I mean<br />
Rupert could then argue and say oh but look, look at the<br />
editorial in the Sunday Telegraph and the Melbourne<br />
Sunday Sun which were for us. So I mean I guess he'd<br />
have an argument if there was anything in the story,<br />
which there isn't.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Do you think The Herald's got it in for<br />
you? PM: No, I don't think The Herald's got it in for us. I<br />
have no respect for McCrann. Never have had. He finds<br />
it difficult to separate out facts from prejudices. And<br />
that's a bit of a limitation for a correspondent. I mean<br />
if you can't sort out facts from prejudices you're in<br />
trouble. That's always been McCrann's problem.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Well McCrann will have no problems with his<br />
swimming pool on the strength of that. You're a wealthy<br />
person, you can perhaps swap and give him the Rupert<br />
Murdoch swimming pool<br />
PM: I'll call you as a witness probably, not as a<br />
defence counsellor Do you spend any time in the work<br />
now? INTERVIEWER: Yes, defamation's my<br />
PM: Yes, I know. </p>
<p>INTERVIEWER: I may.<br />
PM: Thanks.<br />
INTERVIEWER: For the right price.<br />
PM: Right price.<br />
INTERVIEWER: He comes very cheap.<br />
PM: Does he?<br />
INTERVIEWER: Talking of prices and money, the appalling<br />
record in this country of the State Banks at the moment,<br />
why keep the Commonwealth Bank?<br />
PM: Because the Commonwealth Bank, I think, has over the<br />
years developed a, not just a reputation for, but in fact<br />
has had a major part of its concern being housing for<br />
ordinary people. And of course it's gone beyond that<br />
role it had in the early days of being the major savings<br />
bank. It's a very very large trading bank as well. I<br />
think it's appropriate for the people to have that<br />
institution. INTERVIEWER: Talking about government instrumentalities,<br />
I pick up my papers and I listen to the radio and I watch<br />
the television, and I hear ads by the RACV on roads. Are<br />
you going to do something about that? I mean Dennis<br />
probably, being a good Liberal, would support it but I<br />
don't want more<br />
INTERVIEWER: I support the Liberals but I don't support<br />
the RACV on politicising the road issue. To me it's<br />
irrelevant what a private club wants to do about roads.<br />
PM: Of course, it's a pity they wouldn't concern<br />
themselves with facts. I mean the facts on roads are<br />
very simple. Again, facts don't worry prejudiced people,<br />
like the RAC. Fact one under my Government we have<br />
spent 18% more in real terms in our seven years on roads<br />
than they did. Which in dollar terms is $ 235 million per<br />
annum more on roads under Hawke Labor than under the<br />
Liberals beforehand. Fact two their misrepresentation<br />
about the proportion of our revenue that goes on roads.<br />
They're just totally untruthful about that. The<br />
Government gets its revenue from oil from two sources,<br />
from the levy at the rig and the excise at the pump. In<br />
this last year my Government has spent 19.46% of our<br />
total revenue on roads. In their last year it was<br />
19.04%. INTERVIEWER: Have you been swatting up on figures ever<br />
since Paul Lyneham caught Andrew Peacock out?<br />
PM: No, I just happen to have been a person who a) got a<br />
degree in economics, who was appointed by firstly the </p>
<p>Whitlam Government to a major committee of inquiry into<br />
the Australian economy that was the Jackson Committee<br />
and then was appointed by Fraser, by the Fraser<br />
Government to the Corporate Committee of Inquiry. I'm a<br />
person who has been intimately acquainted with the<br />
Australian economy, not just academically but in<br />
practical terms, for a very long period of time. I know<br />
my country's..<br />
INTERVIEWER: Dean Banks is intimately acquainted with<br />
your academic career, we're going to pursue certain<br />
aspects of it shortly.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Let's see whether you're an expert in the<br />
laws of the State of Victoria.<br />
PM: great expertise there mate.<br />
INTERVIEWER: When we come back and test your legal<br />
knowledge on strange laws but true.<br />
break INTERVIEWER: We were talking sport before. You're<br />
synonymous in the area of cricket, the punt and also<br />
golf. I couldn't believe it when they told me that you<br />
got a half blue in baseball.<br />
PM: We're in the situation over in, when I started<br />
after the war when I went to university, that baseball<br />
was a winter sport. So a lot of us who played first<br />
grade cricket used to play baseball in the winter months.<br />
It was tremendous for keeping your arm in.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Ian Chappell, Allan Border, both played<br />
baseball. PM: Neil Harvey.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Your favourite game Ross.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Great game, great game. Strange laws but<br />
true you'ye done this before. The segment where we<br />
give you three laws, your job, along with Dennis and<br />
Dean, they're going to have a crack as well. Just tell<br />
us which of these three propositions is correct.<br />
Codncentrating and ready. Don't sound so enthusiastic.<br />
PM: ( inaudible)<br />
INTERVIEWER: I got into trouble at school for saying<br />
yeah. PM: Did you, oh.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Here we go, law number one.<br />
PM: It's so exciting, let's go eh. </p>
<p>7<br />
INTERVIEWER: That's better. Our story again features<br />
young friend Mal Dux. This time Mal Dux is caught up in<br />
election fever, or rather non-election fever because Mal<br />
Dux believes that people shouldn't vote because it only<br />
encourages politicians. Mal Dux votes, he's in rather<br />
the Wills electorate. On election day Mal Dux attends<br />
his local polling booth and stands directly outside the<br />
polling booth distributing how not to vote cards, which<br />
are cards urging people to vote informally. After he's<br />
been there a short while he's approached by a federal<br />
policeman. ' Excuse me sir', says the policeman, ' would<br />
you mind moving down to the footpath away from the front<br />
door because you are not allowed to distribute campaign<br />
material within six metres of a polling booth'. ' I agree<br />
with you', says Mal Dux, ' however' and this is<br />
proposition number one ' I'm not distributing campaign<br />
material, I'm distributing material urging people not to<br />
vote, so I can stand wherever I jolly well please.'<br />
That's law number one. We'll go back over these. Law<br />
number two. Mal Dux of course at some stage has to vote<br />
himself. Naturally, giving his stance, he intends to<br />
vote informal. He enters the polling booth and looks at<br />
his ballot paper for the Senate. Now, a leap of<br />
imagination, but this Senate ballot paper has the names<br />
of eight candidates on it. Mal Dux decides to make his<br />
vote informal, in a novel way. He puts numbers next to<br />
each different candidate as follows:<br />
87), 7297). Satisfied that he's registered an<br />
informal vote he leaves the polling booth and goes to the<br />
Horse and Hounds for a cold to reward himself. Here<br />
he meets barrister friend Dennis Donohue and tells him of<br />
the novel way that he's voted informal. Dennis is<br />
aghast. And this is proposition number two. ' Mal Dux,<br />
what you've done does not make your vote informal. As<br />
long as the numbers on the Senate ballot paper are in<br />
sequence, and there are changes to no more than two of<br />
the votes, your vote is alright. Son, you've voted<br />
S formally.' Law number three. Dennis goes on, ' tell me<br />
Mal Dux, since you've mucked up your chance to vote<br />
informally in the Senate, how did you vote informally in<br />
the House of Representatives?' ' Well', says Mal Dux, ' I<br />
marked all the squares as you're supposed to do but I<br />
signed the ballot paper best wishes to you all, Mal Dux.'<br />
' Well Mal Dux', says Dennis, ' I'm sorry but you've failed<br />
again. Putting your signature on a ballot paper does not<br />
make your vote informal'. Going back over them. Law<br />
number one says Mal Dux can stand wherever he likes if<br />
he's not distributing campaign material, he's simply<br />
distributing material telling people to vote informally.<br />
Law number two says as long as the numbers on the Senate<br />
ballot paper are in sequence and you haven't changed any<br />
more than two, that's ok. Law number three says signing<br />
a ballot paper does not make it an informal vote. Now<br />
would you like a crack at that or would you like some<br />
leadership from Dennis Donohue, ace barrister. </p>
<p>PM: he gets paid more than I do. He should go<br />
first. INTERVIEWER: Probably true as a matter of fact.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Number three Ross because I was a<br />
scrutineer in the Fitzroy election last year and people<br />
wrote things like don't encourage the bastards and things<br />
]. ike that and they weren't informal votes. I'll go for<br />
number three, to assist you Mr Hawke.<br />
INTERVIEWER: So you reckon that signing a ballot paper<br />
doesn't make it an informal vote?<br />
( inaudible)<br />
INTERVIEWER: Dean Banks?<br />
INTERVIEWER: I go for number one.<br />
INTERVIEWER: You reckon that because he's not<br />
distributing campaign material he's simply saying to<br />
people don't vote, he can stand wherever he likes.<br />
INTERVIEWER: It's a free country.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Prime Minister?<br />
PM: I've got a question before I answer it. Your<br />
proposition that one of these laws is right<br />
INTERVIEWER: One is right.<br />
PM: Only one is right.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Only one is right.<br />
PM: I agree with Dennis. I think it's the last one.<br />
INTERVIEWER: That's good. We've got the Prime Minister,<br />
a bloke who earns more than the Prime Minister, and a<br />
bloke who earns more than both of them put together, and<br />
they can't get the right answer.<br />
PM: Number two.<br />
IW4ERVIEWER: Number two is the correct answer. As long<br />
as you put the numbers in the Senate in sequence that's<br />
alright. Distributing material telling people not to<br />
vote is campaign material for the purpose of the<br />
Commonwealth legislation. And if you sign your ballot<br />
paper because that can identify you, that is an informal<br />
vote. So you've got to be careful when you register your<br />
vote at Wills.<br />
PM: Yes, I've never signed a ballot paper yet. </p>
<p>INTERVIEWER: Perhaps that was the informal vote up in<br />
Wills Prime Minister.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Prime Minister, it's now my duty<br />
PM: You're the one who should be embarrassed, not me.<br />
INTERVIEWER: I should be.<br />
PM: You don't look embarrassed.<br />
INTERVIEWER: I was trying to mislead you<br />
PM: you're a Liberal, so what's new.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Before I ask you about the record, I've got<br />
a fax here and someone says that you once said ' I'm a<br />
socialist and always will be. I would welcome the demise<br />
of the capitalist system provided it was replaced with<br />
socialism.' Is that still your stance?<br />
PM: No, it certainly isn't. I'm surprised that I was<br />
ever as dogmatic as that. But it's certainly not my<br />
view. INTERVIEWER: Alright, time for the record.<br />
record plays<br />
INTERVIEWER: Thank you Prime Minister for joining us<br />
this morning. A small presentation from Dennis Donohue.<br />
INTERVIEWER: It's a car fridge full of hard stuff for<br />
when you fall off the wagon after the election and<br />
too. PM: Thank you, thank you Dennis. Well I appreciate it<br />
very much, and you Dean and you Ross. It's been a<br />
pleasure being with you. All the best.<br />
INTERVIEWER: I've just had a call as to what's in the<br />
esky and is it going to be shared with the travelling<br />
media? PM: It certainly will be. They can all take one before<br />
they go.<br />
INTERVIEWER: That's not a bottle of French in there is<br />
it? PM: An original monastic herbal drink, homemade from an<br />
ancient Finland recipe. It's not alcoholic, I can be<br />
into it.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Get into it. Good luck in the election<br />
Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Thank you very much Dean. </p>
<p>INTERVIEWER: Are you going to call it?<br />
PM: I think we'll win but we've got to fight hard right<br />
up till Friday night and that's what we'll be doing.<br />
INTERVIEWER: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: No, I'm not putting numbers on it mate.<br />
ends </p>
