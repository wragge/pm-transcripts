PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH FOR THE<br />
LAUNCH OF AUSTRALIAN MADE ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN<br />
SYDNEY 3 NOVEMBER 1989<br />
More than three years ago, when I launched the Australian<br />
Made Campaign at the Opera House, I was in the company of<br />
some truly great Australians. Their presence symbolised the<br />
excellence and commitment required for the achievement of<br />
national success in an increasingly competitive world.<br />
Today's occasion is somewhat more modest, for it is a launch<br />
of a new Australian Made advertising campaign. But the two<br />
Australians here with us today, who feature in the new<br />
Australian Made advertisements, have achieved the same order<br />
of excellence as those gathered with me back in August 1986.<br />
I refer, of course, to Kay Cottee and Dick Smith. By any<br />
measure Kay and Dick are great achievers, they have made<br />
Australians proud of them and they are giving back to their<br />
country which has created the opportunity for the success<br />
they have enjoyed.<br />
I thank you, Kay and Dick, for your contribution to this<br />
most important campaign.<br />
At the launch in 1986 1 expressed confidence that the<br />
Australian Made Campaign would be successful in helping<br />
persuade customers to buy Australian made products where<br />
they represented value for money. The message was and<br />
still is stop and compare. If the Australian product is<br />
competitive with the imported variety in both price and<br />
quality terms, then go for the Aussie product. The campaign<br />
has never exhorted consumers to buy Australian made,<br />
regardless of price and quality. Rather, it has sought to<br />
raise awareness of the national benefits from buying<br />
Australian. By any objective measure, the campaign to date has been an<br />
outstanding success. It is not easy to estimate how much<br />
import replacement has occurred as a result of the campaign;<br />
in fact, it's impossible. But the survey work we have done<br />
suggests there is over 90 per cent awareness of the green<br />
and gold kangaroo logo, and buying behaviour ha. z been<br />
significantly affected by the campaign. </p>
<p>Another indication of the success of the campaign is the<br />
number of Australian Made licensees: over 1600<br />
manufacturers, producing in excess of 30,000 products.<br />
Despite this very substantial achievement, the time has come<br />
to reinvigorate the campaign. We do not accept the argument<br />
of the conservative political parties that there is no role<br />
for public funding for the campaign. Industry will.<br />
participate, but government has a responsibility to<br />
reinforce in the minds of the public the national advantages<br />
of buying Australian. This is what the new phase of<br />
advertising does.<br />
The new funding we have committed to the campaign, amounting<br />
to $ 2.4 million, takes the total commitment of my Government<br />
to $ 8.7 million. Like a good Aussie product, I consider<br />
that to be value for money.<br />
-The new advertising phase begins this Sunday and will go<br />
through November into early December. A special promotion<br />
called Give Australian Week will be conducted nationally,<br />
starting 27 November. This is designed to encourage all<br />
Australians and tourists to consider Australian Made<br />
products when purchasing gifts in the lead-up to Christmas.<br />
The Australian Made campaign will be promoted throughout the<br />
next 12 months and I have every reason to believe it will<br />
achieve even greater success than it has enjoyed to date.<br />
Finally, I would like to commend Norm Spencer of the Advance<br />
Australia Foundation, who has been with the campaign from<br />
the very start. The dedication of Norm and his small team<br />
has much to do with the success of the campaign and I am<br />
sure the Advance Australia Foundation will continue to make<br />
a valuable contribution to this most important project.<br />
It gives me a great deal of pleasure to be associated with<br />
this launch of the Australian Made advertising campaign. </p>
