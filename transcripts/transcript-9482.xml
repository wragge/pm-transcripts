PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PETER KENNEDY, RADIO 6WF, THURSDAY,<br />
16 FEBRUARY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
KENNEDY: Mr Keating, Tom Jones is he your sort of singer?<br />
PM: He is my sort of singer, not necessarily my sort of songs but he<br />
is my sort of singer.<br />
KENNEDY: What is it about him?<br />
PM: It's that huge bluesy voice big black bluesy voice and he was<br />
doing all this 30 years ago, that's whet amazing about him. I mean he has still got the<br />
horsepower. KENNEDY: Alright he has got the horsepower and I guess the question is<br />
he has been doing it for 30 years you have been doing it for 25 or 28 years. Have you<br />
still got the horsepower and the question I suppose associated with the fact there is<br />
no prime minister who has probably promoted Australia as a nation and our position in<br />
the world more than you nave done in the past couple of years. But yet as f1 as<br />
Western Australia is concerned you are still a relative stranger. Why is that?<br />
PM: I don't think that is right Peter. There Is a conventional wisdom<br />
written by journalists, you know they go to polls and what have you and look at these<br />
things. Now when It comes to forecasting elections and forecasting popularity most<br />
journalists couldn't pick their nose frankly and they are all writing what's happened but<br />
very poor at writing about what is prospective. Remember this, the Labor Party has<br />
had a majority of seats here for most of the period of this Government, a majority of<br />
federal seats In Western Australia ana we are not far away from that even now after<br />
last election. I ne conventional wisdom Defore the last election Is that In some way you<br />
know for various reasons we wouldn't win the election and we did. So I just think the<br />
public are quite discerning, I mean the key thing to think about me and Western<br />
Australia is what policy changes are In the place, why Is Western Australia growing at<br />
a year, this year, 10% growth which is just a phenomenal figure and 6%<br />
employment growth end tho answer is because of this Federal Labor Government's<br />
policies. </p>
<p>KENNEDY; Alright but it's undeniable that the state is growing very quickly.<br />
as fast as any other state in the country but yet as far as Western Australia is<br />
roncemed you very rarely venture west This is your first tip west In 11 months.<br />
PM: But how many times have I been here in 20 years, dozens of<br />
occasions. KENNCDY; But now you are Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Yes I know, I was coming in August as you know, the Cabinet<br />
came in August but I picked up the flu for the first time in 5 years and It laid me down<br />
for about 10 days and so I missed the August thing but ira two days, a day over and a<br />
day back and I generally make it two or three if I can which really means blanketing<br />
out most of the week, most of the working week and In this job irs very hard to do<br />
that. KENNEDY; But do you acknowledge the fact that Western Australia, a third<br />
of the continent feels somewhat miffed by the fact that you don't seem to be able to<br />
spend as much time here as they think you should?<br />
PM: Look it's not a third of the continent, In terms of the people we<br />
don't go talking to bare hills we talk to people. Its an important constituent part of<br />
this country and for 12 years I have been a minister and mnst of the policies I have<br />
supported pealing away the tarff wall. opening me exchange markets. getting sort of<br />
best practice into Australian industry. competitiveness In other words. All of that has<br />
been in the main favoured Western Australia and Queensland. So In reality I don't<br />
think Western Australia has had any minister In key positions as I have been who has<br />
in rfa favoured it more.<br />
KENNEDY: Yet the same sort of message seems to be coming out of<br />
Queensland because only this morning your Attorney General was reported as having<br />
said that he believes that you should visit Queensland more often. Queensland and<br />
Western Australia the resources rich states and it appears you are neglecting them.<br />
PM* That was a beat up I think and these things happen from time<br />
to time. That story we wont take too much notice of. I was in Queensland last week.<br />
week before last. last week In fact I was In Queensland, I am In Queensland quite<br />
often because It's the same time zone and the distance means that the time you fly<br />
over here you haven't lost a day but the important thing Is, is Western Australia<br />
benefiting from the policies of the Government I lead? Why has it got 10% economic<br />
growth and 6% employment growth? Is it because of the policies of the state<br />
government or the Federal Government and there is only one answer to that? The<br />
Federal Government. Its competitiveness, the exchange rate, inflation, productivity,<br />
these are all the things that make all the bulk trader commodities of western Australia<br />
competitive. They are the things that is ving western Australian manufacturing<br />
base, they are the things which am giving a decent competitive service sector and<br />
tnars wnat matters: Not whether I am over here doing radio programs or going from<br />
this place to that place. I come when I feel I have to and that is to pick up the issues<br />
and get a feel of the community but the core thing for West Australians is, does the<br />
Federal Government implement policies which are of benefit to Western Australia and<br />
the answer to that is very strongly In the affirmative.<br />
KENNEDY; Prime Minister this is a very important year for you I think you<br />
would agree and you seem to have. given the crsis that you nau just a week or two </p>
<p>ago in Canberra, you seem to have lost patience with the Greens over the<br />
woodchipping row?<br />
PM: No not the Greens, I can't have any truck with the recitation of<br />
untruths which some of these people in the Wilderess Society have been saying.<br />
That is there is 1,300 compartments of forest which are pristine trees, that Is Just<br />
untrue. They say our objoctivos of such a high moral purpose we can actually, how<br />
dare you say that our spiel is wrong. I mean the day I actually accept the fact that<br />
1,300 stands of trees are pristine when in fact less than 500 are we are all In trouble<br />
so we have to deal in facts and truths and a lot of people, I mean from my point of<br />
view there are two comparatives In this debate. One is like most Australians I want to<br />
see the important stands of native forest protected but where they have been logged<br />
through once or twice, where they are no longer pristine there is no point In pretending<br />
they are. So there is an Imperative here to protect the native stands of trees but on<br />
the other hand make sure we have got a sustainable forest products Industry. I think<br />
we have come right down the middle in that debate and all those Australians who<br />
want to see those trees protected have got to know that the Federal Government Is<br />
doing the right thing In protecting them and much of the blurb, much of the rhetoric,<br />
much of the hysteria is basically factually wrong.<br />
KENNEDY: You might say you haven't lost patience with the Greens but<br />
what about the report that you refer to the Greens because of ceaseless demands,<br />
you refer to them privately as neo fascists.<br />
PM: Not even privately I am Just saying some of this sort of bald<br />
recitation of untruths by some people in the Wilderness Society is sort of, you know as<br />
I said Goebbels like behaviour. The sort of recitation of basically untruths and how is<br />
that going to help the debate? I mean how can we pretend that 800 stands of trees<br />
are pristine when in fact they are not How can you have a debate when people, now<br />
what happened in the past we have always had the leadership of the environment<br />
movement with the conservation society where you got more weight and gravity and<br />
gravitas and people got a lead. People interested In environmental issues got a lead,<br />
now the noisiest have taken over and soma of the most extremo elaments of the<br />
wilderness Society and remember this that Bob Brown is running for a Senate seat.<br />
Its not as It he Is any more campaigning Just for the preservation of forests, he Is<br />
competing with other Liberal and Labor candidates for a Senate vacancy, a Senate<br />
seat, a Senate quota. So what Is happening of course the rhetoric has changed to<br />
suit his political ambitions and the ambitions of the Wilderness Society which has<br />
become a political party.<br />
KENNEDY: Well the Green's rhetoric certainly seems to have hardened<br />
towards your government?<br />
PM: No the Wilderness Society not the Greens, the Greens is a<br />
very large expression. Green means the people Interested in green. Could I Just say<br />
last year. do you want me to say this Peter. last year without any real pressure from<br />
the environment movement this Government put aside Shoalwater Bay In Queensland<br />
for ever, Jervis Bay in NSW for ever, and put $ 20 million of the budget to buy back the<br />
whole and the heart of the Daintree. How much have we heard about that? Not a<br />
word. KENNEDY: Are you confident that you will get Green's preferences at the<br />
federal election similar to what former Senator Richardson achieved In 89? </p>
<p>PM' Look at what we saw yesterday from the Liberal and National<br />
Party. There is the leader of the National Party saying that ho disagrees with Mr<br />
McLachlan he will not support the abolition, the abandonment of the policy of clear<br />
relling uf trees. McLacnlan came and saia tat they the Liberal Party and the Coalition<br />
wouldn't support clear felling. Fischer came out and said we would, I haven't got his<br />
exact expression in front of me but we would not support that policy and we won't<br />
support that policy, so if you look at the people who are interested In the preservation<br />
of the Australian environment and forests. I mean obviously the tail of the National<br />
Party has always wagged the dog but if Fischer comes out and says we are still in<br />
favour of clear felling you can bet pounds to peanuts that's the way Coalition policy<br />
would go in office.<br />
KENNEDY: So you would expect to get Greens preferences?<br />
PM: We are the major party that can form a Government in this<br />
country, we also happen to be the major party that has the environment up ther as<br />
one of the main core issues. Of course I expect that.<br />
KENNEDY: The tight between the media giants for the lucrative Fairfax<br />
media group in Sydney obviously is going to test your media ownership rules. Would<br />
you consider lutting the current major shareholder, that is the Canadian Conrad Black,<br />
increase his stake from 25 to 35% 7<br />
PM: That's a matter for policy and we will think about It as we do In<br />
any of these processes. If he applies for It we will think about it.<br />
KENNEDY: On the other hand do you have a preference for Australia's<br />
media being controlled by Australians?<br />
PM: The nationalist In me always has that preference but we have<br />
already allowed Mr Black's company to buy Telegraph newspapers, to buy 25% of<br />
John Fairfax and Sons.<br />
KENNEDY; Now Kerry Packer has been interviewed on A Current Affair<br />
this evening and during that Interview ha said In part with regard to the Opposition<br />
Leader John Howard, he said John Howard Is a good honest man who has leamed<br />
from the mistakes of the past and he added he believes Australia needs a changing of<br />
the guard.<br />
PM: Well that's the opinion of one, I mean so what<br />
KENNEDY: Just one, not an influential one?<br />
PM: Just one. I mean last time Kerry Packer would tell anybody<br />
who listened that we had no chance of winning the 1993 election. He told me<br />
personally we had no chance of winning the 1987 election and as far as I can<br />
reowlleut his view was the Labor Party wouldn't win the 1990 election. So what more<br />
need I say?<br />
KENNEDY; You don't attach any significance to those comments?<br />
PM: Not really no.<br />
KENNEDY; You are not suggesting or seeing that perhaps he might be<br />
putting a little bit of pressure on you in his bid for control of John Fairfax? </p>
<p>PM: I am In the pressure business I am in the conflict business<br />
Peter, it would take more than a dozen Kerry Packers to put any pressure on me.<br />
KENNEDY: But I mean he has been friendly tu Labor over the last<br />
years hasn't he?<br />
PM: Not in news management or media terms he hasn't, no. But<br />
you know is ha somebody who believes the Government has done a reasonable job, I<br />
think that is right but is the Channel 9 network programmed to support the<br />
Government. It never has been. I mean are the current affairs programs set up, never<br />
has buen. So Is he a friend or the Govemment In news management terms, no he is<br />
not. KENNEDY: So with regard to Fairfax you wouldn't rule out any attempt by<br />
or any attempt by Conrad Black to come to you, to come to the Government and say<br />
we would like you to lift the percentage limit that we can take in John Fairfax to<br />
PM: I think the Important thing here is process, I mean we are<br />
seeing a tremendous change In media policy with convergence and cross media and I<br />
think process is important that governments have a right to consider these issues,<br />
property consider them.<br />
KENNEDY: Will you be bringing forward your planned review of the<br />
government's media policy because of this?<br />
PM: No I don't think so, no.<br />
KENNEDY; So no reviews planned or what, until after the election?<br />
PM: I am not sure when we would expect this review to be<br />
considered by Cabinet.<br />
KENNEDY: Can I Just ask you about Mabo and Aboriginal land rights? Of<br />
course they are back in the news with the president or the national Native Title<br />
Tribunal saying this week there was significant moral shortcomings In the principles by<br />
which native title was recognised. An observation I would Imagine which would<br />
concern you?<br />
PM: Observations by judges, I obviously read and take some notice<br />
of but I think what led to the point, led to the remark being made was that If some<br />
parcel of land has in the past had some sort of title over it, it has the potential to<br />
extinguish native title. Well mars in the preamble of the Commonwealth Act we have<br />
always understood that the High Court made that clear. I think any suggestion that in<br />
some way land which might otherwise nave bean natve title land but for the fact for a<br />
couple of year it might have had some other lease or something over It Is really about<br />
a statutory base for the granting of native title in the broad. We used to call that land<br />
rights so if the remark is to be taken to mean that we should move the Mabo native<br />
title legislation to statutory land rights I don't support that and that's what I took the<br />
remark to mean.<br />
KENNEDY: He Is the president though of the Native Title Tribunal<br />
Yes and I am the Pnme Minister. </p>
<p>KENNEDY; And pointing out what he believes to be moral shortcomings in<br />
the legislation.<br />
PM: Well in that case he has got a point to make to his fellow<br />
judges on the High Court bench. It may be that a parcel of land which has had if you<br />
like habitation by indigenes but which for a period had through just a quirk of history a<br />
lease of say 6 years or 10 years or 12 years, that may have extinguished the native<br />
tide. The important thing is to get the land fund bill through because the<br />
Govemments policy was never all about native title, it was all about a combination of<br />
the two. That Is where a grant of interest in land, where a grant of interest in land has<br />
extinguished the native tite and there Is a pastoral lease in this very large fund which<br />
the Government is now proposing that the Parliament should agree to and which of<br />
course was emasculated by the Greens and the Liberal Party in the Senate last year,<br />
would allow Aboriginal people to buy that pastoral lease, you see. So what Justice<br />
French is saying, he is making a comment about the Impact of the vagaries of native<br />
title but to make a social comment you have got to look at the land fund because the<br />
land fund has such a complementary purpose in being able to provide in buying land<br />
and seeing that go to a synthesised native title.<br />
KENNEDY: You have said that you will be looking at amendments to the<br />
native title legislation just after it's been in operation for a while, when is that likely to<br />
be? PM: Operational amendments, not go to the heart of its principles.<br />
You know what the Australian media is like Peter its all blacks and whites and no<br />
greys, well when you are in Government and you ae running a Parliament, running a<br />
Govemment and you have got to legislate, one has to look at the greys and all the<br />
subtle colours. We are not just blacks and whites, amendments do not mean gutting<br />
the native title legislation. What they mean are process issues.<br />
KENNEDY; Well you managed to get the national farmers federal support<br />
of course for the legislation on the basis that the pastoral lease grant didn't extinguish<br />
native title. So what you are saying is you wouldn't want to consider changing the bill<br />
to change that?<br />
PM: In the preamble of the bill the presumption is that pastoral<br />
leases have extinguished native title. Now I think what Justice French's ruling has<br />
said is that in this case with the Century Mine it did extinguish the native title. He<br />
perhaps is musing about the fact it may be shouldn't have. Well that point I<br />
understand the remedy we think is for the land fund to be buying land, do you<br />
understand? In other words if you want perfection here you go back to 1788 and<br />
invest title across the country in the names of the Aboriginal traditional owners, then<br />
you work backwards. Now none of us are in that position. The High Court made a<br />
decision 200 years after first settlement and that may not suit the indigenes obviously<br />
but what we sort to do is to legislate so that they could get the maximum certainty<br />
from that legislation. Notwithstanding the fact that the High Court pretty well made it<br />
clear although no doubt this matter will be tested whether In fact a pastoral lease<br />
extinguishes native title.<br />
KENNEDY; Prime Minister how do you think Labor is travelling in the west?<br />
PM. I made the point to you earlier Peter we have had a majority of<br />
seats in Western Australia pretty much most of the way through since 1983 and if it's<br />
all a matter of delivering the jobs, I mean what was the primary issue upon which the<br />
Government was elected at the last election. It was unAmployment Growth and </p>
<p>omployment growth and unemployment. The Government has taken that issue up,<br />
adjusted Its policies and we ame now growing faster than any other western world<br />
economy with very low inflation and in Western Australia. Western Australia is actually<br />
growing much faster than the national average with low Inflation and with very strong<br />
employment growth so on the basis of what we said we would do, what we wore<br />
elected to do and what we have done, why wouldn't Western Australians return the<br />
Government again?<br />
KENNEDY: You take the credit for that, Promier Richard Court said today<br />
Western Australian people Should taKe the credit for that Itfs not being reflected in<br />
support for<br />
PM: The policy frameworK comes fom the Federal Government. Of<br />
course it's done by people and by the West Australian people and business and<br />
others but the framework Is what maks the difference and Irs like wandering around<br />
a casino with your pockets full and saying but where did It come from. I mean where<br />
did the growth come from, it came from the right cast of national policies from the<br />
Labor Government thafs where it came from.<br />
KENNEDY: When will we see you back in the west?<br />
PM; I don't Know Peter, out I always like seeing you.<br />
KENNEDY: Won't be 11 months?<br />
PM: Probably not but I mean go bacK over 25 years. I mean let's<br />
not go on about this too much. This silly game that Premier Court plays and the rest I<br />
have been coming to this state for 25 years and I didn't 3ee anybody saying Mr<br />
Keating has been here 3 times tho year or 4 times this year as I have In some otheryears.<br />
it just depends on the load of business and how you can manage your<br />
engagements. KENNEDY: When you make it back look forward to talking to you again.<br />
PM: Thank you Peter.<br />
