<p>People in northern Tasmania now have access to a full range of integrated health services to help manage several chronic and complex conditions.Officially opened today, the Northern Integrated Care Service in Frankland Street, Launceston, will provide accessible, customer-focused, integrated services for people in Launceston and the surrounding regionIt will also give patients more choice and control to self-manage their chronic conditions through life-style modification and education programs.The broad range of services includes diabetes services incorporating endocrinologist led clinics; diabetes education; dietetics; psychology; and podiatry; and the Tasmania Medicare Local chronic disease and mental health and psychology services. There are refugee health clinics, cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programs, nurse-led cardiac clinics and Active Launceston exercise classes.As well, negotiations are under way to provide respiratory, chronic pain, musculoskeletal and neurology services in the future.The Northern Integrated Care Service is funded through a National Partnership Agreement, with $18 million of combined funding from the Australian and Tasmania Governments, and $4.5 million from the University of Tasmania.Through national health reform, my Government is building a stronger primary health care system that promotes good health and health prevention, and supports privately provided GP services, community health and other state and territory government-funded services to work together.We want people to be able to get the care they need, when and where they need it  -  and the Northern Integrated Care Service fits the bill on all counts.This facility is proof positive that national health reform  -  and, in particular, improving primary health care for all Australians  -  is making a real difference in helping Australians get the high quality services that meet their needs and the needs of their family.The new service includes the University of Tasmania's Launceston Clinical School, which is training medical undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD students and conducting research into chronic disease. The clinical school development was supported by a $3 million grant from the Federal Government's Capital Development Program. </p>
