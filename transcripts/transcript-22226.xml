    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Cole Commission of Inquiry has asked me to consider providing a written statement in relation to certain specified matters.</p>
<p>I will provide that statement to the Inquiry tomorrow, consistent with the request.</p>
<p>As I have previously indicated, if I am asked to appear before the Inquiry, I will be happy to do so.</p>
<p>The Government has fully cooperated with the Inquiry and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>I have said previously that the Inquiry should be left to complete its task. As I have been asked to provide a written statement, it would not be appropriate for me to publicly canvass in advance the details of these matters to be included in my statement before it is considered by the Inquiry.   </p>
