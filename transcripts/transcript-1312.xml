OLD) WESLEY COLLEGIANS' ASSOCIATION CENTENARY 66 / 084<br />
FOUNDERS' DAY DINNER<br />
TOWN HALL. MELBOURNE 2nd May. 1966<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
Mr. Presicient, Many Distinguished Guests and Fellow Collegians-<br />
It would be a wonderful thing, as so many of you<br />
are finding, to be at the Wesley Centenary Dinner. A very<br />
remarkable thing to be not only at the Wesley Centenary Dinner,<br />
but to be there as guest of honour, and to be there both as<br />
guest of honour and as Prime Minister of the country. Well,<br />
I think even Ken Hadley and Maurice Sloman, with whom I have<br />
had an occasional game of poker in my more leisurely moments<br />
of past years, would agree that is a hand which takes some<br />
beating. And so, Trevor, I feel a great sense of pride in<br />
being here in those various capacities this evening. The sum<br />
of their totality makes my own enjoyment and relish of what is<br />
for me a notable and historic night quite a moving experience.<br />
I listened with very great interest to your rather<br />
detailed judgment. It has confirmed a suspicion I've had for<br />
many years that the congestion of the courts is due to the fact<br />
that the judges do not apply themselves to the business of law<br />
but allow their minds to wander. Anyhow, I am certainly<br />
indebted to you for your researches because I've been reminded<br />
of so many of the happy occasions which slip into the limbo<br />
and only reappear on very rare occasions if they appear at all.<br />
You mentioned some of these unanswered letters and I apologise<br />
to several hundred people in this company who were good enough<br />
to send me congratulations and good wishes a few months ago<br />
when the high office of Prime Minister came my way. I can<br />
only say by way of exculpation that the list of unanswered<br />
letters runs into the thousands mark and I do hope some tine~<br />
to be given sufficient opportunity by my Cabinet and by<br />
Parliament and the people to say a personal " thank-you" to you,<br />
but at least this medium can be taken tonight to pass on an<br />
interim and very warm-hearted acknowledgment to you all.<br />
But one of the dividends that I secured out of<br />
this appointment was not merely the host of letters of good<br />
wishes but so many of those who wrote to me were school friends<br />
of many years back that I hadn't heard of perhaps for a<br />
generation or more. Included amongst them, although I had,<br />
of course, been aware of his presence in the intervening period,<br />
was a letter from Eddie Wells and Eddie had been at the Prep.<br />
when I was there I think he was Headmaster of the Prep.<br />
School but certainly he looked after all of us who were boarding<br />
at Stella in those days. Eddie wrote to me to remind me that<br />
in 1922 I secured 100 marks for algebra in each of the three<br />
terms. Now I think you will agree, gentlemen, that for a<br />
Treasurer that is a pretty remarkable achievement. Had it<br />
come before the change in office, I would have taken even more<br />
encouragement from it. As it was, I was very glad to slip<br />
into the somewhat easier calculations of decimal currency.<br />
But Eddie I encountered tonight, he addressed me as " Sir" </p>
<p>It was the first time in the history of our relationship over<br />
many years that I haven't been doing it that way from my end,<br />
and so Prime Ministers do enjoy some privileges.<br />
Gentlemen, it is for all of us tonight a wonderful<br />
occasion. There isn't one of us in this room whoisn't proud<br />
of what he still reg rds as the best school of all and I<br />
exclude some of the philistines who have crept in by virtue of<br />
that traditional Wesley courtesy which obtrudes itself from<br />
time to time. But for those of us who have passed through,<br />
or in the case of some of the senior boys who are still going<br />
through the final stages of their studentship there, we shall<br />
treasure always in a corner of our hearts and you made a<br />
reference, Trevor, to that song I had to sing. Dickie Adamson<br />
of whom I'll say a few more words in a moment or two, was a<br />
very remarkable man, of course, in very many respects, but he<br />
knew how to contrive a song so that the emotion desired from<br />
the comparatively unemotional students with whom he had to deal,<br />
came forward at the right moment. I defy anybody to sing the<br />
leaving song, which is usually reserved on speech night for the<br />
senior boys leaving the school I defy anybody at whatever<br />
stage their voice has gone -contralto, breaking or baritone<br />
or whatever the case may be -without an involuntary sob coming<br />
into the voice, the music is so arranged. And so you sing on<br />
the final day at the speech night actually this leaving<br />
song, and in it we talk about the school still having a corner<br />
in our hearts, and I am sure that is true of all of us. And<br />
it is a warm corner, something to which we can turn when we<br />
are amongst our contemporaries, when we read with pride and<br />
satisfaction of what a fellow collegian has accomplished, or<br />
find that some well known Wesley fnmily and I have run across<br />
so many of them here tonight has sent on another son to carry<br />
on the famous tradition of the father.<br />
A great school makes a great contribution to the<br />
national life. It gives, as the Headmaster has said to us,<br />
qualities of character, and it brings an individuality which I<br />
think every community finds of advantage to possess. we don't<br />
want all to be cast in the same mould, and even when you are<br />
a school inside a particular system of schools, as the Great<br />
Public Schools are in this State of Victoria, each school<br />
somehow develops its own atmosphere, its own character, and<br />
Wesley undoubtedly can claim that individuality and Wesley<br />
undoubtedly can claim that thanks to the men who have gone<br />
before in the headmastership and who today stand in that office,<br />
there are qualities of character which any Wesley boy worth<br />
the salt will acquire and will carry with him through his days<br />
wherever his tasks or his inclinations may take him. And this<br />
for an Australia of less than twelve million people is a<br />
tremendously important thing if we are to face the great<br />
responsibilities and challenges of developing a continent the<br />
size of the United States, if you leave Alaska out of the<br />
picture, and we are trying to do it with our ll, 500OOO0; against<br />
something over 200 million in that country, then the people<br />
must be people of quality and people of character if we are<br />
to make our mark and have some influence on what is happening<br />
amongst the 1,500 million people to the north of this country<br />
who are finding themselves in a dynamic period of rapid and<br />
revolutionary change. It is not sufficient for us to produce </p>
<p>people, we liave to produce leaders, we have to produce people<br />
of character and quality. And I believe Australia is doing<br />
just that. One of the lessons I've learned as I have gone<br />
around in this last ten days, although it was a lesson well<br />
perceived from many earlier voyagings, is that the best expoct<br />
that Australia makes is the export of its own people I am<br />
not recommending that we export them wholesale, because we<br />
are busily trying to import people to build a nation around<br />
us, but the Australian where he goes in the main is a person<br />
I use that terms " he" generically because, as a matter of<br />
fact some of the Australian " shes" abroad are pretty good,<br />
too, and I met the daughter of orne of our most distinguished<br />
old boys, Keith Reid's daugher, at the surgical unit in Saigon<br />
in the last few days where she was doing a great job for<br />
Australia also. But here Australia is making its presence felt by<br />
the good Australians that have gone to serve in one capacity<br />
or another, narticularly around the South East Asian arc to<br />
our north. There are a couple of Australians in Cambodia, a<br />
country of whose politics we don't entirely approve, but<br />
there has developed a curious friendship between the government<br />
of that country, and one of the reasons for this is that there<br />
are two fellows there who have taught them how to mend the<br />
buses when the buses break down. Now, other countries make<br />
handsome gifts of hundreds of buses. They compete for the<br />
favours of Cambodia. Some will come from the United States,<br />
some will come from Russia, some will come from China or from<br />
somewhere else, and that's fine. The buses are received but<br />
when the buses break down, nobody knew how to fix them. well,<br />
a couple of Australians are running a training workshop in<br />
Cambodia and are amongst the two best known men in Cambodia<br />
and they have built up a great store of goodwill for this<br />
country. And that rather illustrates the sort of thing I<br />
have in mind. You spoke, Headmaster, about this generation of<br />
students I heard and what a wonderful thing it was, what<br />
a moving thing it was to hear th voice of Dickie Adamson<br />
tonight giving us something of the philosophy which we had<br />
absorbed from him in which he talked of the criticism of that<br />
particular generation of young Australians by their elders<br />
and expressing his own view that it was a better generation<br />
than the one before. I, having come in contact with a good<br />
many of Ithe generation which succeeded me, endorse his<br />
judgment as far as today's generation of young Acstralians<br />
go. They are better educated, I believe, than wewre, they<br />
have got more assurance and I believe they have got as much<br />
earnestness and determination to do what they believe is the<br />
right thing to do, provided their own intell!. gence can be<br />
satisfied that this is the right thing. They have a more<br />
challenging judgment, perhaps, than an earlier generation.<br />
The slogans are under questioning because they find themselves<br />
in a restless turbulent world in which the standards of the<br />
past have come under increasing challenge. But the stuff is<br />
there, and again I have seen this confirmed over the last ten<br />
days by the quality of manhood and womanhood that I have<br />
encountered in the various countries that I have visited.<br />
We talked of Dickie Adamson and what he meant to<br />
us, and I mention him because he happened to be my own<br />
headmaster. Any generation of Wesley collegians who had </p>
<p>another headmaster to guide them will think, I have no doubt,<br />
in very similar terms about -the man who guided the earlier<br />
years of their own lives. But a headmaster, a good headmaster,<br />
has his own special brand of immortality. It is an<br />
immortality of influence which goes into the hearts and minds<br />
of those to whom he is giving leadership, and it extends from<br />
them perhaps through their families, perhaps in the leadership<br />
which they in turn bring to others, but it is a species of<br />
immortality which is very genuine and goes very deep. I shall<br />
never forget I am sure nobody who was at Wesley in my time<br />
could forget the impact which the character and personality<br />
of Lawrence Arthur Adamson made upon us, the precepts which he<br />
gave to us, which have become embedded in our own make-up and<br />
which have illuminated so clearly for us so many of the paths<br />
along which we have had to proceed as we have made our own way<br />
through life. I have no doubt that in my own public life the job<br />
of assessing what was the right thing to do in a situation has<br />
been greatly assisted by the clear perception which Dickie<br />
Adamson brought to the great precepts of human conduct.<br />
Perhaps I could illustrate by an example the way<br />
he used to go about it with us. He was, of course, a man of<br />
legal training and he sometimes thought in legal terms, but<br />
on one occasion, I remember, we had some discussion with him<br />
I was one of his prefects at this time, so was Spot Turnbull,<br />
my old room-mate in the eyrie just the two of us, in one of<br />
those towers in the older Wesley, and somehow or other I<br />
couldn't have persuaded him adequately at the time as to the<br />
political course he was to follow later but, still, you can't<br />
achieve everything. We are still very good friends and I<br />
did have the pleasure of introducing him to the young lady who<br />
became his wife. I would have you know, Mr. Justice Rapke,<br />
that this rather flippant reference of yours to the dancing<br />
prize calls for some amplification because I was in that state<br />
of bondage at the time which afflicts the boarder I don't<br />
know whether there has been improvement since but the only<br />
way I could escape from the prison was to go to dancing class<br />
on a Friday night at St. Catherine's School. Naturally,<br />
being there one developed a certain proficiency in order to<br />
secure the more agreeable partners that one saw around the<br />
room. The incentive was there and finally came the accolade.<br />
I can't claim ever to have mastered the Charleston to which<br />
you have referred. There are some people who would be unkind<br />
enough to say in politics that I had learned the Twist fairly<br />
early in my career.<br />
However, we discussed with the Headmaster at that<br />
time what seemed to us to be a curious application of the law<br />
because two sets of of fences had been committed within quite<br />
recent time of each other. A group of schoolboys returning<br />
from Geelong, having no doubt conquered either Geelong College<br />
or Geelong Grammar as the case might have been, felt that the<br />
occasion called for some celebration and were found by some<br />
intrus ive master drinking a bottle of wine in the railway<br />
carriage and were duly reported to the headmaster. The other<br />
episode concerned a group of boys who, no doubt, for good cause </p>
<p>decided to ink the navel of one of their colleagues. Now<br />
the headmaster administered a much lighter penalty on the<br />
boys caught drinking the wine which seemed to us at school<br />
by far the more heinous crime, than he inflicted on those<br />
who had inked the navel of their follow student, and seeking<br />
enlightenment we discussed this with him, and he explained<br />
it quite logically and simply. He said the wine-drinkers<br />
were engaged in a social misdemeanour, perhaps of some harm<br />
ultimately to themselves but not damaging the interests of<br />
others or interfering with the liberty of others. But those<br />
who inked the navel of the schoolboy, that was an assault<br />
upon the person and a grave interference with his own personal<br />
liberty and course of action. Now, gentlemen, here was a<br />
typical example of the logic, of the sense of principle which<br />
Dickie Adamson had. We remember him with great affection.<br />
I remember him with a very deep gratitude.<br />
The generation which you now have to look to,<br />
Headmaster, face challenges of even greater complexity than we<br />
did in our time. We are in this restless rapidly-changing<br />
world, but Australia is so peculiarly placed as in effect a<br />
Western country in an Asian world, finding it of increasing<br />
importance to trade, to collaborate, to join for purposes of<br />
mutual security, tc confer on matters of mutual interest and<br />
concern. And here is a test of the Australian qualities which<br />
we believe are well enshrined at Wesley, of tolerance, of<br />
character, of courage and of mateship, and when you think of<br />
it that by the time this generation that I speak of the new<br />
generation reaches its own maturity, the population of the<br />
world, certainly of Asia will probably have doubled, and<br />
Australia which today has this handful of people in the sea<br />
of humanity of which I speak, will have to exercise a role,<br />
a significant role in helping to shape the outcome of these<br />
opportunities and challenges and problems as they open up to us.<br />
Well here, I repeat, are claims upon the kind of<br />
quality that a great school can produce. Wesley has a proud<br />
record of achievement over its first one hundred years. The<br />
purple and the gold those royal colours which we bear so<br />
proudly and see carried so proudly by those who represent the<br />
college will have to be again in the forefront of leadership<br />
in the affairs of the years ahead. But the tradition is<br />
secure. We here tonight, from those who were here in 1906<br />
onwards, are all inheritors and participators in this great<br />
heritage built for us by men of the quality and the character<br />
and leadership as headmasters to whom I have referred. And<br />
you, Sir, now have that trust and we know that in you the<br />
Wesley tradition will be safely carried and that h: 74cI', t new<br />
chapters will be added to the Wesley story.<br />
Last night, I was turning over because I thought<br />
there might be something there of interest to you the<br />
publication, the very limited publication put out in 1921,<br />
March of 1921, of the first 55 years of the school's history,<br />
and it was clear that those who compiled the history then<br />
were very much influenced by the proximity of the publication<br />
to the school's contribution to the First World War, and we<br />
as students honoured appropriately as the occasions seemed </p>
<p>Fr 6.<br />
proper, those who had served Australia in those years. And<br />
each generation seems to have to face up to its own challenge<br />
to freedom and the standards that it wishes to see preserved<br />
in its own country and in other countries to whom we can<br />
bring our own succour. And this falls again to the<br />
responsibility of another generation of young Australians,<br />
and I can assure you from what I have seen of the Australians<br />
of this noew generation abroad, we have produced a breed of<br />
men of whom we shall be eternally proud.<br />
Gentleman, tonight you have done me the great<br />
honour of proposing my toast. Trevor has gone through his<br />
researches to a degree that has not merely delighted me but<br />
has stimulated many happy recollections which I will mull over<br />
for a very considerable time to come. I hope that in the<br />
next 100 years you don't merely produce a couple more Prime<br />
Ministers, but the judges, the doctors, the lawyers, the<br />
teachers and all those who go to make a civilised cormmunity,<br />
able to live the good lifb themselves but more importantly in<br />
the kind of world in which we find ourselves, able to contribute<br />
themselves to a better life for others. This will be the<br />
product of the Wesley of the next 100 years.<br />
And so to the best school of all, my thanks for<br />
the great joy and the great reward of having served my seven<br />
years there, for the host of happy memories whenever thoughts<br />
turn back to a wonderful school. And the best wishes of all<br />
of us, Headm~ aster, to you and the boys for an even greater<br />
Wesley in the hundred years ahead. </p>
