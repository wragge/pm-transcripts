    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that more Western Australian producers and small businesses will be able to apply for drought assistance following amendments to boundaries for the Southern Rangelands Exceptional Circumstances area.</p>
<p>Drought assistance will now be available until 31 March 2008 to farmers and agriculturally-dependent small businesses in:</p>
<p>   * parts of the Shires of Murchison, Yalgoo, Sandstone, Leonora, Menzies, Kalgoorlie/Boulder and Dundas;<br />
   * the pastoral areas of the Shires of Esperance, Ravensthorpe, Kondinin, Mt Marshall, Dalwallinu, Perenjori, Mullewa, Chapman Valley and Northampton; and<br />
   * the whole of the Shires of Coolgardie and Shark Bay.</p>
<p>A buffer zone extending east and north of the existing southern region is included within these areas (see the map at <a href="http://www.daff.gov.au/droughtassist">www.daff.gov.au/droughtassist</a> for further details).</p>
<p>This announcement builds on the Australian Government's unprecedented response to this drought - a commitment of $2.3 billion in assistance.  Since 16 October 2006, the Government has announced measures totalling $1.1 billion, including:</p>
<p>   * extending income support and interest rate subsidies to eligible producers in EC declared regions across Australia until 2008;<br />
   * EC assistance to eligible small business operators dependent on farm businesses in EC declared areas;<br />
   * establishing Family Relationship Centres and providing extra financial and personal counselling to rural communities;<br />
   * emergency individual and community grants to be provided through the Country Women's Association;<br />
   * increasing the deposit cap for the Farm Management Deposits scheme from $300,000 to $400,000, and the non-primary production income test from $50,000 to $65,000;<br />
   * professional business and financial planning grants of up to $5,500 for eligible farmers in areas that have been EC declared for more than three years; and<br />
   * making changes to Drought Force and Job Network to help farming communities meet their workforce needs and to encourage skilled labour to remain in the region.</p>
