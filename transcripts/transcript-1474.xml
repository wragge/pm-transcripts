FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 11/ 1967<br />
EXCHANGE OF MESSAGES BETWEEN INDIA<br />
AND AUSTRALIA<br />
Australia and India, both of whom celebrate their<br />
National Day on the 26th January, today exchanged congratulatory<br />
messages. The message from the Australian Prime Minister, Mr. Holt,<br />
to the Prime Minister of India, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, read<br />
" On behalf of my colleagues in the Government<br />
and all Australians, I extend to you and thepeople of India<br />
our sincere good wishes on your celebration of Republic<br />
Day. Our countries are closely linked in sentiment<br />
and association, and on this day of joint celebration we<br />
express a special interest in the welfare and prosperity<br />
of the people of India and look forward to our continued<br />
friendship and co-operation."<br />
Mrs. Gandhi in her message said:<br />
" It gives me great pleasure to convey to you on<br />
behalf of the Government and people of India, and on my<br />
own behalf, our cordial greetings on the occasion of the<br />
National Day of Australia. By a happy coincidence, we<br />
share the same National Day. The relations between our<br />
countries grow closer and new avenues of co-operation and<br />
collaboration present themselves with welcome frequency.<br />
On this important day, I also send you our best wishes for<br />
your personal well-being and for the happiness, progress and<br />
prosperity of the Australian people."<br />
