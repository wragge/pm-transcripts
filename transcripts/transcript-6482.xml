EMBARGOED UNTIL 9.25 P. M. CEKAANTDLVR<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHAMBER OF MANUFACTURING, NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
SYDNEY 25 SEPTEMBER 1984<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
I very much appreciate this opportunity 1to address you tonight.<br />
The turnaround in Australian manufacturing over the past<br />
eighteen months represents a substantial achievement.<br />
it is not simply the sharp reversal Of What had been a dramatic<br />
decline in Australian manufacturing that is significant it is<br />
also the vigour of its recovery which is now providing the<br />
Australian economy with a source Of real strength.<br />
The Industry Councils' Secretariat: is currently undertaking an<br />
assessment of the performance of the Australian manufacturing<br />
industry.<br />
The conclusions drawn by the Secretariat demonstrate for all<br />
Australians, and particularly those engaged in the manufacturing<br />
sector, the severity of the problem confronting the Labor<br />
administration in this area when it assumed office in<br />
March 1983.<br />
They indicate that in terms of low ' output growth, employment<br />
decline, low export growth, rising import penetration and low<br />
growth in capital. stock, the manufacturing sector in the period<br />
1971/ 72 to 1981/ 82 was performing the worst of the five major<br />
sectors of the Australian economy. CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY </p>
<p>In the year to March 1983 the situation was particularly<br />
disastrous output fell by over 12 per cent and, over the year<br />
to May, more than 100,000 jobs were lost in the sector.<br />
This record of decline, both in growth and in absolute terms,<br />
had to be halted and reversed. Since March 1983 it has been.<br />
The Labor Government accepted this task as one of its highest<br />
priorities. Indeed my Government when it assum'ed office, and ever since has<br />
regarded the restoration of a highl. y productive, strongly<br />
competitive manufacturing sector as crucial, not only to the<br />
immediate purpose of economic recovery, but also to the even<br />
more important task of securing conditions that would guarantee<br />
the maintenance of longr-term economic growth in Australia.<br />
Hence the emphasis we have given to the development of a sound<br />
industry policy as part of the Government's overall economic<br />
strategy.<br />
Only if we have a more internationally competitive manufacturing<br />
industry can Australia achieve the growth in output, income ard<br />
employment it needs. A defensive, inward-looking, and stagnar. t<br />
manufacturing sector could hold back the growth of the whole<br />
Australian economy.<br />
Tho fact is that the manufacturing sector has a singular<br />
importance for the people and economic life of Australia.<br />
It can either exert strong depressive effects on other sectors<br />
of the economy or it can play a central role in the process of:<br />
economic growth.<br />
Improved performance of the manufacturing sector is essential.<br />
This will only be achieved if we have a manufacturing sector<br />
which is: </p>
<p>more internationally competitive and export oriented<br />
than at present;<br />
better able to adapt to changing conditions;<br />
better equipped to take advantage of opportunities<br />
presented by technological developments.<br />
Government's industry policies -and economic policies more<br />
generally are directed to providing the framework within which<br />
attainment of these conditions might be possible.<br />
The remarkable turnaround in Australia's economic performance<br />
achieved over the past eighteen months has certainly provided an<br />
environment of unparalleled opportunity for the manufacturing<br />
sector. Through the last year we have exper~ ienced the strongest growth<br />
in economic output since national accounts data were first<br />
collected in their present form a quarter of a century ago.<br />
Through the last year more new jobS have been created in<br />
Australia than in any other year in our history.<br />
Through the last year we have seen inflation and inflationary<br />
expectations fall decisively, from about twice the average of<br />
the industrial countries, to levels that are more or less in<br />
line with comparable countries.<br />
Faster growth and modest wage increases within the Accord have<br />
dramatically reduced real unit labour costs. The share of<br />
national income accruing to profits is now higher than at any<br />
time for the past 10 years. The continued successful operation<br />
of the Accord will enable still further improvement in real unit<br />
labour costs because there will be no increases in award wages<br />
over the twelve months to next April. Real wages costs per unit </p>
<p>of output are now mud) the same as in the late 1960' s to early<br />
1970' s.<br />
This rapid turnaround in economic activity has been accompanied<br />
by the lowest incidence of industrial disputation, as measured<br />
by working days lost, in the past J. 6 years3.<br />
Interest rates have fallen appreciably, contributing directly to<br />
lower business costs and improved sales and investment<br />
prospects. And the manufacturing sector, albeit unevenly and haltingly, has<br />
reflected in its own performance something of this decisive<br />
shift in Australia's economic fortunes.<br />
In the year to May 1984 there were hardly any job losses in the<br />
sector. Employment in the sector has levelled out and I would<br />
hope the forthcoming employment figures for the year to August<br />
1984 will show some growth.<br />
The latest June quarter index of total, manufacturing gross<br />
product ( seasonally adjusted) also showed a growth in real terms<br />
of nearly seven per cent over the previous year.<br />
Despite the unexpected fall of 0.7 per cent in output in the<br />
June quarter itself due in large measure to stock rundowns,<br />
technical difficulties in one sectoral group, and quite possibly<br />
to statistical aberrations I should expect the strong growth<br />
which has been apparent in the sector since the March quarter<br />
1983 to be sustained in the current year.<br />
My confidence is based not only on an anticipation of continued<br />
strong growith in the economy though obvi-ously that will be<br />
important.<br />
There is also the clear evidence of' strengthening private<br />
consumption. July retail sales figures showed an increase of 3%<br />
in seasonally adjusted terms and retail sales in the year to<br />
July 1984 rose by This pick-up in demand is obviously very<br />
encouraging to manufacturers. </p>
<p>The Government's economic policies, including some specific<br />
industry policies, also provide a most effective underpinning<br />
for a sustained recovery of production in the manufacturing<br />
sector.<br />
My confidence is shared by Australian manufacturers.<br />
The September quarterly survey by the Confederation of<br />
Australian Industry and the Westpac Bankii~ g Corporation of<br />
industrial trends showed its most optimistic capital spending<br />
results for three years. Forty parcent of manufacturers<br />
expected to increase spending on plant arid machinery over * the<br />
next 12 months, compared with 20 per cent who forecast lower<br />
spending. This is the best result since June 1981, and compares<br />
with 36 per cent predicting a rise and 22 per cent a fall in the<br />
last June quarter.<br />
The approach the Government is adopting t~ o manufacturing<br />
industry policy is clear and deliberate. It is an approach<br />
which at once aims at a definition of goals, the consideration<br />
of the timing of the process of adjustment, the selection of<br />
appropriate policy instruments, the examination of necessary<br />
institutional and administrative arrangcnients, and attLention to<br />
the equitable distribution of the social costs of structural<br />
adjustment. The Steel Industry Plan introduced last year is a highly<br />
( successful example of this approach at work. Through it, all<br />
groups involved dramatically enharced their ow,. n positions by<br />
agreeing on measures aimed at rapidly improving the<br />
competitiveness of the industry. The careful choice of<br />
appropriate policy instruments in the Steel Industry Plan has<br />
benefitted all Australians by providing steel at lower prices<br />
and in a more competitive environmient than was the case under<br />
the regime of import quotas which the Plan replaced.<br />
The Motor Vehicle Industry Plan is another example it aims to<br />
encourage a more competitive industry, providing more secure<br />
employment and investment opportunities I-or those directly<br />
engaged in motor vehicle production, and better vehicles at<br />
lower prices for consumers than would have been available under<br />
the arrangements we had inherited. </p>
<p>The success of arrangements such as these hinges not on<br />
unilateral action by Government, but on a co-operative approach<br />
by all concerned governments, employers and unions to the<br />
problems of the industry in question.<br />
To foster this approach throughout the manufacturing sector we?<br />
have established an extensive industry consultative mechanism<br />
spearheaded by-a restructured and revitalised Australian<br />
Manufacturing Council.<br />
Already the Council has some valuable runs on the board. Its<br />
recent statement on manufacturing industry policy representing<br />
as it did the agreed positions of all bodies and individuals on<br />
the Manufacturing Council was a major achievement. It not<br />
only served to underline that a vigorous and competitive<br />
manufacturing sector was vital to the Australian economy, but<br />
that a positive industry policy was an integral part of<br />
achieving stronger economic growth and increased employment.<br />
more specifically the Council sugge! sted that:<br />
" The main impetus to growth must be achieved by the<br />
development. of economies of scale, achieving larger volumes<br />
and more diversified trade, increased factor productivity<br />
and being more competitive in the domestic and export<br />
markets."<br />
The Council went on to propose that: " Policies to this effect<br />
should focus on:<br />
maintaining and where possible exp) E. nding our existing<br />
position, in world manufactuting, agricultural, mineral<br />
and resource markets where we do have a competitive<br />
advantage developing export and import competing opportunities for<br />
the manufacturing and service sectors and matching the<br />
removal of protection with the development of those<br />
opportunities<br />
* planned reduction of support for manufacturing<br />
industries not consistent with determined objectives to<br />
be trimmed so that job losses can be made at acceptable<br />
social costs </p>
<p>* the need to ensure that the costs of capital,<br />
availability 6f finance and taxation provisions are<br />
conducive to developing manufacturing industry in<br />
Australia."<br />
This approach proposed by the Australian Manufacturing Council<br />
constitutes a coherent, properly balanced indeed totally<br />
sensible prescription for growth in the manufacturing sector;<br />
it also, in the implementation of all its elements, represents<br />
an appropriate strategy for national economic growth.<br />
Importantly the Council's approach highlights the futility of<br />
narrowly-based, and often ill-conceived, golutions to the<br />
problems of Australian industry.<br />
Sterile old arguments, within which the respective merits of<br />
free trade and protection were seen as the only issues in<br />
industry policy, are buried -hopefully forever.<br />
In their stead, and in line with what both John Button and I<br />
have argued for the past year or so, the Council declares that:<br />
Australian manufacturing industry must expand sales both in<br />
international and domestic markets, and that the key to success<br />
in both areas is enhanced competitiveness.<br />
The achievement within the Council of a consensus on this<br />
approach is a valuable advance in the development of comimunity<br />
understanding of the issues involved. It constitutes needed<br />
recognition of common ground and an equally important movement<br />
away from narrow sectional interest. What is required now is<br />
action to give effect to the thrust of the strategy proposed<br />
to identify and nurture the processes by which the manufacturing<br />
sector might achieve enhanced competitiveness.<br />
In this regard, the role of the industry specific Councils<br />
established under the umbrella of the Australian Manufacturinc<br />
Council is vital. </p>
<p>Importantly-these Councils have been constituted in such a way<br />
as to draw upon the views of representatives across the full<br />
spectrum of industry. The benefit their understanding and<br />
experience brings is an essential prerequisite to the<br />
development and implementation of appropriate industry policies.<br />
A comprehensive work program for the Councils has already been<br />
established. The program concentrates initially on the manufacturing sector ' s<br />
current position and aims to identify the strengths and<br />
weaknesses and prospects and opportunities of the sector. From<br />
this work, and guided by the long-term stiategy approach<br />
outlined by the Manufacturing Council, specific action-oriented<br />
proposals for industry restructuring and development will be<br />
formulated.<br />
This work is being complemented at the Government level by a<br />
sub-committee of Cabinet and a high level officials' Task Force<br />
formed to consider the , issues involved in industry adjustment.<br />
I consider it most important that the Government bring a<br />
properly considered and carefully integrated approach to the<br />
policy issues involved in this crucial area. It is not simply<br />
that Government action should be supportive of the perceived<br />
needs of industry. Certainly, at a minimum, Government polic:; es<br />
across the full range of areas of interest to industry should be<br />
consistent in their effects on industry; but Government action<br />
should also serve as a catalyst for necessary change.<br />
Government would be failing in its responsibility were it not to<br />
provide a policy framework appropriate to the long-term<br />
developmental needs of competitive Australian industry<br />
structures. Government should also see that the costs of change<br />
are not borne alone by those at the face of change. As I have<br />
said many times before, if change is to be justified in terms of<br />
the benefit to the community as a whole, then the community must<br />
share the burden.<br />
One direction in which the Government will look more<br />
deliberately for change is in the accumulated pattern of<br />
excessive and often irrelevant and obstructive body of laws arid<br />
regulations. The removal of unnecessary regulation will<br />
contribute significantly to improved economic growth<br />
performance. </p>
<p>It is with this aim that we are establishing a tripartite<br />
working group comprising representatives of government,<br />
business and unions to examine critically the whole range of<br />
business regulation. As I said the other day to the Business<br />
Council: " We will maintain regulation which, upon careful analysis,<br />
clearly promotes economic efficiency, or which is clearly<br />
an effective means of achieving more equitable income<br />
distribution.<br />
We will abandon regulation which fails these tests."<br />
Whatever action we take in Government, however, can be no<br />
substitute for the initi'ative and enterprise of industry itself.<br />
only through your efforts are we likely ultimately to succeed in<br />
achieving a sector which will have the capacity to provide<br />
Australians with increased standards of living<br />
a manufacturing sector which will provide increasing<br />
number of jobs and jobs which are secure and have long<br />
term prospects, and<br />
a manufacturing sector which will provide increasing<br />
numbers of jobs and jobs which arc! secure and have lont3-<br />
term prospects, and<br />
a manufacturing industry producing goods which are up -to<br />
date, technologically advanced, arid produced efficiently<br />
at competitive prices.<br />
In many parts of manufacturing, production for the domestic<br />
market alone will rnot allow industry to achieve these goals.<br />
Our success will depend crucially on improving the export<br />
performance of the manufacturing sector. </p>
<p>In this regard, allow me to say that recent comments by your<br />
Chamber's Director, Jbhn Martin, were music to my ears.<br />
While discussing the subject of research and technology, John<br />
emphasised the need for industry to become more export oriented.<br />
He noted that there is a significant market out there for our<br />
products and that industry should reach out for it.<br />
Expansion in the trade of manufactured goods has been the<br />
driving force behind world trade growth over the past two<br />
decades. But because of the esentially import competing,<br />
substitution nature of manufacturing in Australia, we have had<br />
little share in that growth. This single fact, more than any<br />
other accounted for Australia's share of world exports fal'lin~ g<br />
from 1.7% in 1970 to 1.2% in 1980.<br />
Many of Australia's ba~ ic commodities face uncertain price<br />
prospects in the medium and longer term and are experiencing<br />
intensified levels of protection in foreign markets, increasing<br />
supplies from developing countries and increased substitution.<br />
Australia needs the impetus effect of income and employment<br />
growth that manufactured exports can provide.<br />
Looking at Australian manufacturing industry, I have no reason<br />
to doubt the competitive capacity of Australian manufacturing<br />
industry. There are absolutely no grounds for pessimism about<br />
our ability to export the products of our manufacturing and<br />
services sectors.<br />
We have achieved a stable macro-economic environment in which<br />
lower real unit labour costs, falling interests rates and a<br />
realistic exchange rate are more conducive than in recent memory<br />
to the heightened competitiveness of Australian industry.<br />
We have an established pool of enterprise and initiative.<br />
Internationally, economic recovery has taken hold and with it<br />
flows the prospect of expanding market opportunities.<br />
The opportunities for Australia's manufactured exports are<br />
further enhanced by our location within the world's most dynamnic<br />
reg ion. </p>
<p>' We need now to put all these circumstances together into a<br />
highly successful expdrt drive.<br />
There is, however, no room for complacency in our approach.<br />
Australia will not be an automatic beneficiary of the dynamism<br />
of the Western Pacific simply by virtue of the good fortune of<br />
being located there.<br />
The recent report of the high level trade mission to Japan<br />
drives the point home. while the -report identifies a number of<br />
areas where particular export opportunities exist, it says that<br />
successes in marketing Australian mianufact~ ures in Japan have<br />
been rare and nearly all exports of manufactures to Japan have<br />
been the result of Japanese trading companies seeking out<br />
Australian products and, then marketing the! m in Japan.<br />
Australian industry must be more active arid adventurous in<br />
seeking out overseas markets. There are risks in such action<br />
but there are also significant rewards. As a nation, and as<br />
exporters, we must be prepared to take these risks.<br />
A more outward-oriented approach to Australia's manufacturing<br />
activities has important implications for both industry and<br />
Government: -for industry it means seeking out and capturing the<br />
opportunities of the international market, matching the<br />
quality of overseas competitors and resisting the<br />
temptation to shield behind the protective walls of a<br />
limited domestic market. The imperatives of successfu* l<br />
international competition stimulate vigour and<br />
flexibility not only in economies but also in the<br />
enterprises on w. hich those economies depend.<br />
-for Government, an outward-orientation means recognisinig<br />
the mutually supporting role of production for the<br />
domestic and export markets. It means establishing<br />
systems of incentives in which prices reflect both<br />
domestic and international resource scarcities. Above<br />
all, it means creating a climate which is conducive to<br />
enterprise and to flexible responses to changing market<br />
conditions. It is in just such a climate that specific,<br />
positive measures of Government support for industrial<br />
development are likely to bear fruit. </p>
<p>Recent changes in the structure and approach of the Australian<br />
Department of Trade have been designed to further enhance the<br />
export prospects of the manufacturing sector.<br />
The market development activities of that Department are now<br />
giving a particular priority to manufactures and services.<br />
A " Global Marketing Plan" has been established to identify<br />
products and firms which are competitive by world standards. it<br />
will also identify overseas markets where Australia is likely to<br />
be able to secure an increase in dxports of manufactures.<br />
In practical terms, a number of industries have been identified<br />
as having scope for improved export performance. The diversity<br />
of these industries testifies to the broad base of the<br />
Australian manufacturing sector and to the range of<br />
opportunities presented.<br />
Specific country " Action Plans" are also being implemented. By<br />
taking account of the individual characteristics and trading<br />
conditions of the individual countries tiese plans will maximise<br />
our chances of breaking into new markets.<br />
Already very considerable progress has been registered under<br />
both the China and Japan " Action Plans". Very significant<br />
impetus has also been achieved by mnyselt, Lionel Bowen and many<br />
other Ministers involving ourselves directly in the national<br />
effort to promote Australia's exports. The China iron and stEel<br />
iniative is one clear example of the real gains already<br />
registered. The visit to Australia later this year of a high<br />
level Japanese import expansion mission tv. ill be another example<br />
of opportunities crea~ ted in this case it will be for<br />
Australian manufacturers to persuade the visitors of the<br />
competitive quality of their product. I could not overeinphasise<br />
the need for Australian manufacturers to prepare<br />
thoroughly for this most important mission's visit.<br />
The effectiveness of the Australian Trade Commissioner service!<br />
is also being improved through a stronger marketing orientation<br />
and by recruitment of suitably qualified private sector<br />
personnel on short term appointments. </p>
<p>As well, a National Export Marketing panel has been formed to<br />
focus on manufactures'and services. This panel will advise on<br />
the most effective ways in which the Government can assist<br />
Australian exporters and ensure that our export finance and<br />
insurance activities, export development grants, and trade<br />
promotion ' activities are each being effectively employed.<br />
My own regional trade initiative, first announced in Bangkok in<br />
November last year, should also help secure improved access to<br />
international markets for Australian suppliers. In this regard,<br />
I am delighted that the next meeting of senior regional trade<br />
officials will be held in Sydney from 3-5 November. Out of that<br />
meeting I expect countries of the region to define more<br />
precisely their interests in contemporary -multilateral trade<br />
issues. By so doing we should be able to secure more adequatE!<br />
international attention to this region's trade needs and<br />
priorities. Finally I suggest to you that far greater effort needs to be put<br />
into fostering closer links between industry and research<br />
organisations by Australian manufacturers and researchers, anc.<br />
especially the CSIRO, so as to facilitate commercial development<br />
of research findings.<br />
For too long research in Australia has been too much divorced<br />
from development. If measured against the yardstick of<br />
relevance, there is clearly a need for our scientists Lo lift<br />
their game.<br />
As a nation we have been deprived of the full benefit of our<br />
internationally acclaimed research effort. The fault lies on<br />
both sides with researchers disinterested in the application<br />
of their product, and with industrialists not sufficiently aware<br />
of the benefits to be derived from a vigorous research effort.<br />
It is for this reason that I have recently discussed with both<br />
the Australian Vice-Chancellors and with Lhe Business Council of<br />
Australia some of the ways in which this gulf might be bridged.<br />
Foy its part the Government will actively support this process.<br />
There is a need for Australian scientists and industry leaders<br />
together to focus more deliberately on the quality and relevance<br />
of Australian education systems.<br />
The gap between Australian research and development has its<br />
origins in traditions that have never recognised nor<br />
acknowledged the relevance of each to the other. This problem<br />
will only be overcome if researchers reach out more deliberately<br />
to understand and provide for the needs of industry and if<br />
industry itself puts much greater effort into defining its<br />
requirements more precisely and embarks on the even more<br />
difficult task of persuading educationalists and researchers to<br />
redirect their interests. </p>
<p>While change in areas ' such as this is inevitably slow, there<br />
should be no doubting the Government's determination to<br />
encourage progress.<br />
The Kirby Committee is currently reviewing the whole range of<br />
Government training programs. And we have established the<br />
Karmel Committee to review the quality of Australian education,<br />
at the primary -and secondary level, with a special concern to<br />
improve the relevance of the education process to employment and<br />
future economic opportunities. Similar work is being undertaken<br />
by the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission, under its new<br />
Chairman, Hugh Hudson.<br />
These inquiries would all benefit greatly from carefully<br />
researched, well-co-ordinated industry inputs.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
in the final analysis, the Australian manufacturing industry's<br />
best prospects lie in improving its-competitiveness and in<br />
seeking out new markets, especially internationally. Without<br />
this approach its contribution to the Aust: ralian economy will be<br />
well below its potential.<br />
The opportunities presented by international economic recovery,<br />
together with the underlying invent iveness3 and diversity of<br />
Australian manufacturing activity, should dispel any pessimism.<br />
What is needed above all else, is improve(] competitiveness. Any<br />
measure of import replacement and export expansion achieved on<br />
this basis will-be to the benefit and advantage of all<br />
Australians. The task confronting us as a nation is to remove<br />
all impediments to competitiveness.<br />
A deliberate and concerted effort on the part of all concerned<br />
is required. Government certainly has a role to play my<br />
Government recognises this and has already moved to shoulder its<br />
responsibi lities. </p>
<p>But, ladies and gentlemen, the real engine for growth is not<br />
Government. It is inaustry itself which must develop successful<br />
strategies to export and grow. The people of Australia are<br />
looking to you to do so. It is because I know you have the<br />
capacity and the commitment to meet that challenge that I have<br />
had the greatest pleasure in being with you tonight. </p>
