<p>Welcome, Prime Minister, it is wonderful to be hosting you and your party here in Sydney.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ve already had a very good constructive discussion this morning as we walked around beautiful South Head.</p>
<p>Japan is a close friend of Australia and a bedrock economic partner and a dependable security partner in our region.</p>
<p>We have so much in common in a time when our national and strategic interests have never been more closely aligned. We share democratic values and a common interest, a vested interest, in the makings of a rule based international order upon which the prosperity of our region and the world depends.</p>
<p>We are above all vitally committed to free trade and open markets and we recognise and agree, as we have previously at the G20 and APEC, that protectionism is not a ladder to get us out of the low growth trap, rather a shovel to dig us deeper into it. That is why we are both committed to the Trans Pacific Partnership.</p>
<p>So, ten years on from your signing the security declaration with John Howard, 60 years on from your grandfather Nobusuke Kishi signing the commerce agreement with Australia, our Special Strategic Partnership is stronger than ever.</p>
<p>Welcome Prime Minister. We look forward to very constructive discussions across a wide range of our common interests today.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, very good to see you again, particularly in Sydney, your home town.</p>
<p>And also, Malcolm, you kindly took time out to take me on an enjoyable walk which was such a tremendous experience for me.</p>
<p>Actually, I have to confess that your walking pace was a lot faster than I expected so it was actually good exercise for me. But during the walk I really enjoyed the very candid discussion that we had today.</p>
<p>Also, I would like to mention my appreciation for the [inaudible].</p>
<p>The regional security environment has become increasingly severe and also as a parallel phenomenon, as you rightly mentioned, globally there is now a growing trend of anti-globalisation as well as protectionism. To ensure free and open international order based on the rule of law, our bilateral cooperation and trilateral cooperation with the United States is of course important.</p>
<p>Also today I am determined to further promote our Special Strategic Partnership between Japan and Australia through my visit this time and I am very much looking forward to have tangible outcomes out of our discussion.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>[ENDS]</strong></p>
