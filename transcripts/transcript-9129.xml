STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
COAG AND A NEW COMMITMENT TO CHANGE<br />
On the eve of the COAG Conference in Hobart I take the<br />
opportunity to repeat the Government's call for a new<br />
commitment to change. A new consensus about change.<br />
The Commonwealth Government does not believe that its<br />
role in economic reform is over by any means. Although<br />
the role has changed there remains much to do as the<br />
forthcoming White Paper will confirm. However, what<br />
Australia urgently requires is a willingness on the part<br />
of business and the States to accept their share of<br />
responsibility for economic reform in the decade ahead.<br />
As I said on Tuesday night, the truth is that reform in<br />
electricity or in competition rules will only succeed if<br />
the States accept that it is in their own interests and<br />
the interests of their citizens. And that it most<br />
certainly is. Similarly, progress in enterprise<br />
bargaining or bringing Australian industry to global best<br />
practice is in the interests of business and business has<br />
the ultimate responsibility for achieving it.<br />
If we are going to maintain the progress of economic<br />
reform, strengthen economic recovery and extend its<br />
benefits to all Australians, the States and the<br />
Commonwealth must develop efficient means of working<br />
together and in a more complementary way.<br />
If we are going to deal the people into the opportunities<br />
which national recovery offers the States have a<br />
fundamental role to play.<br />
We have spent a decade knocking down the barriers to our<br />
external competitiveness and creating a cooperative and<br />
productive workplace culture. We have to bring the same<br />
resolve and the same attitudes to the . Federation.<br />
The pursuit of competitive standards of efficiency which<br />
the Commonwealth Government has fostered and to which so<br />
many Australian businesses have responded must be brought<br />
to the Federation. 4649 </p>
<p>The principles of efficient management and efficient<br />
delivery which have come to govern Australia's best<br />
businesses should govern the business of Australia.<br />
The Commonwealth wants to discuss the roles and<br />
responsibilities of governments in the Federation how<br />
to deliver programs more effectively.<br />
But a commitment to common national goals must the<br />
guiding principle of the relationship between the States<br />
and Commonwealth.<br />
