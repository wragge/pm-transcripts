PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 19 NOVEMBER 1978<br />
REDUCTION IN BANK INTEREST RATES ON HOME LOANS<br />
The Prime Minister today welcomed Friday' s announcements by the<br />
Chairman of the Australian Bankers' Association and the<br />
Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia that the<br />
savings and trading banks are prepared to reduce interest<br />
rates on most new and existing home loans.<br />
The announcements, which follow discussions between the<br />
Reserve Bank and the Australian banks, state that lending<br />
rates on most bank housing loans will be reduced by 0.5 percent<br />
where the borrower resides or intends to reside in the home.<br />
The savings banks have also indicated their intention to<br />
reduce their interest rates on savings investment accounts<br />
by approximately 0.25 percent.<br />
These reductions follow an earlier reduction in savings bank<br />
interest rates of 0.5 percent in Feburary this year. The<br />
Prime Minister said that these reductions will be of great<br />
benefit to home owners using bank finance and to prospective<br />
home buyers.<br />
For home buyers with a home loan of $ 25,000 being repaida<br />
over 25 years, the total I percent reduction in interest rates<br />
will mean a saving of the order of $ 17 a month $ 5,000 over<br />
the period of a new loan.<br />
The Government's anti-inflationary policies have created the<br />
economic environment in which such reductions in interest rates<br />
are possible. These reductions will be further strong<br />
confirmation that the Government's economic policies<br />
are working.<br />
The reductions in housing interest rates over the course of<br />
this year will give a further boost to confidence and over-all<br />
economic activity and in particular will assist the building<br />
and related industries throughout Australia. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The proposed reductions in bank interest rates require<br />
similar reductions in building society rates. I have<br />
accordingly sent a message to the Premiers in the<br />
following termus:<br />
My dear Premier,<br />
By now you will no doubt have heard that the Chairman of the<br />
Australian Bankers' Association and the Govprnor of the<br />
Reserve Bank have announced that savings and trading banks<br />
have indicated a willingness to make significant reductions in<br />
housing interest rates and interest rates on savings<br />
investment accounts.<br />
You will recall that we discussed the desirability of<br />
reductions in housing interest rates at the Loan Council<br />
meeting in Melbourne on 6 November.<br />
We agreed that it is desirable that the rates f or banks<br />
and competing institutions, and in particular building<br />
societies, should come down in co-ordination.<br />
in the light of Friday's decision by the banks I would urge<br />
you to seek such comparable reductions in building society<br />
rates as you believe to be practical and responsible. I should<br />
be grateful if you would inform me of the progress of your<br />
consultations with the building societies.<br />
