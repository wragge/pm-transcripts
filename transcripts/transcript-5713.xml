ELECTORATE TALK<br />
With Christmas approaching, there is a renewed burst of<br />
industrial unrest, but the dispute in the Department of Social<br />
Security has been going on for a long time because bans and<br />
limitations were first imposed four years ago.<br />
The main union involved the Administrative and Clerical off icers<br />
Association is in effect claiming the right to determine staff<br />
numbers, a position which Would surely be unacceptable to any<br />
private firm, and is certainly unacceptable to any elected<br />
Government; and they have also attempted to decide for themselves<br />
what duties they would perform, rather than carry out the work<br />
they were employed by the community to do. Thanks to the loyalty<br />
of the majority of the Departmental staff and the efforts of<br />
the Government all pensions and the bulk of other benefits are<br />
still being paid.. But it is impossible to avoid disruption to<br />
the payment of some benefits especially sickness and unemployment<br />
benefits and to deal with all new applicants, and an increas: Lng<br />
number of hardship cases exist which are having to. turn to voluntary<br />
agencies for help.<br />
Bans and limitations by A. C. O. A. members employed in the<br />
Department of Social Security were first imposed in 1977. Furt~ her<br />
bans were imposed during 1979 and 1980, and still further bans<br />
were imposed this year on the implementation of the new health<br />
arrangements for disadvantaged people, on new arrangements for<br />
handling unemployment benefit forms, on overtime, on certain<br />
interviews for unemployed and sickness benefits, and giving pr-iority<br />
to representations from Federal Government members.<br />
Every effort has been taken by the Government and the Department<br />
to meet the stated concerns of the union. A consistently patient<br />
approach has been adopted by management, especially because of<br />
the Government's overriding concern that pensioners and social<br />
welfare beneficiaries should not be inconvenienced further. But<br />
bans have continued in Victoria, and New South Wales, despite<br />
considerable progress on staffing and conditions by the Government.<br />
In May 1980 a consultative working party on staffing and workloads<br />
was established. An amount of $ 2.4 million was allocated in the.<br />
last Budget for the upgrading of accommodation in regional offices.<br />
A comprehensive training programme was implemented, and additional<br />
intensive ' technical training is to begin shortly. The Department<br />
has been exempted from the 2% across-the-board cuts in staff ceilings<br />
this year. A temporary staffing allocation of 660 persons ' was made<br />
to administer the introduction of the disadvantaged persons health<br />
scheme some 350 of that allocation, no longer required for that<br />
purpose, are to'be retained until June to undertake an intensive<br />
training programme in the Department, and overall, staffing in the<br />
Department has increased from about 9,000 in1976. to almost 12,4~ 00 today </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Senator Chaney has made it clear throughout that he would be<br />
prepared to discuss with the union its stated grievances on<br />
staffing and conditions matters, b-ut he has rightly refused<br />
to negotiate while industrial action or the threat of such<br />
action still exists. Faced with a refusal to lift bans<br />
despite all that has been done, the Director-General ' of the<br />
Department of Social Security put staff on notice on 28 October<br />
that unless bans were lifted by 9 November the " no work as<br />
directed no pay" provisions would be used. Bans were lifted<br />
except in N. S. W. and Victoria where employees implementing bans<br />
were placed on nc work as directed no pay. The dispute has<br />
further escalated in those States since then, with a campaign<br />
of rolling stoppages, destructive tactics in regional offices,<br />
and attempts by militant minority groups to take control of*<br />
of fices, harassing and physically-intimidating officers trying<br />
to work. In one case a regional manager was held a virtual<br />
captive in his office.<br />
On 4 December, Senator. Chaney formally advised all staff in Victoria<br />
and N. S. W. that any officer who undertook disruptive or<br />
ihtimidatory actions, or refused to work as directed, would be<br />
dealt with under the provi * sions of the Commonwealth Employees<br />
( Employment Provisions) Act. Since that time over 400 employees<br />
have been stood down under those provisions.<br />
The Government has at all times remained willing to discuss the<br />
union's stated grievances although not in an adversary<br />
atmosphere while industrial action still continued. The union<br />
in these two States consistently refused or rejected this approach<br />
and in so doing demonstrated that it was willing to pursue its<br />
aims with scant regard for the welfare of the community. The<br />
Government has made a number of special arrangements to minimise<br />
disruption as a result of the dispute, but where people. do not<br />
receive their usual benefit cheques otn time, and are faced with<br />
serious difficulty, I suggest they go to the office of the<br />
Department of Social Security which they normally attend and apply<br />
for a counter cheque. Should that office be closed, they should<br />
seek emergency relief from a designated voluntary agency which<br />
the Commonwealth Government is assisting.<br />
The Government is doing-* what it can not only to meet the needs<br />
of those directly affected by the dispute, but also to resolve<br />
the dispute. It was with the interests of the public in mind that<br />
the Government met on Friday last with the A. C. T. U. to discuss<br />
this dispute and other serious industrial inatters. As a result of'<br />
those discussions, the A. C. T. U. President, Mr. Dolan, is to put<br />
certain proposals to the Federal Secretary of the A. C. O. A.,<br />
Mr. Munro, prior to a meeting of the Federal Executive of A. C. O. A.<br />
due to take place on Monday.<br />
W e want this dispute to end. Senator Chaney is prepared to consult<br />
with the unions, but we cannot concede the right of unions to<br />
determine staffing levels and we cannot agree to consultations<br />
while industrial action continues. 000---</p>
