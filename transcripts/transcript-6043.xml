FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 4 MARCH 1983<br />
INIT'REST RATES<br />
Labor's interest rate advertisement today is totally dishonest.<br />
Our policies have enabled interest rates for home owners, home<br />
buyers and small businesses to fall over the past four or five<br />
months. In our last budget we gave significant help to<br />
young home buyers and -1-o home o-wners through our Home Loan<br />
Interest Rebate Schemne. As a result of Government policies,<br />
an extra $ 1,200 million has been directed into the housing<br />
industry. Those facts are irrefutable.<br />
What Labor's advertisement doesn't point out is that interest<br />
rates for home loans and on overdrafts for small business are<br />
regulated. They are regulated because of our concern for the position of<br />
home buyers and small businesses.<br />
I say in categorical and absolute terms because of our<br />
continuing concern those interest rates are not going to be<br />
deregulated. It is Labor's policies that will mean much higher interest<br />
for home owners and small businessmen not our policies.<br />
It is Labor's commitment to spend an additional $ 4,000 million<br />
that will assuredly push interest rates up several percentage<br />
points. 000000ooo </p>
