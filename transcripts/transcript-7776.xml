    <content><![CDATA[<p>15 OCTOBER 1989</p>
<p>Australia is to offer economic assistance to Poland andÂ Hungary. This year has seen dynamic changes in Eastern Europe with aÂ Solidarity-led Government in Warsaw and important steps inÂ Hungary to move towards a multi-party political system and aÂ market economy.</p>
<p>My visit to Hungary earlier this year convinced me of theÂ overwhelmingly popular support for reform. From my ownÂ discussions with President Gorbachev, I have formed a clearÂ conviction that he is determined to bring about fundamentalÂ reforms in the Soviet Union. Indeed the word " perestroika" has become a rallying cry throughout Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>A successful outcome to these developments is to beÂ earnestly hoped but cannot be taken for granted. It isÂ incumbent on those who can to provide support at this uniqueÂ moment of history.</p>
<p>Because of this, and because these developments will bringÂ with them a lessening of East-West tension and a betterÂ climate for world peace and disarmament, 24 countries of theÂ Western world have come together to co-ordinate WesternÂ assistance to Poland and Hungary in support of reform.</p>
<p>Australia will assume its responsibilities to participate in Â this process. We will join in the significant efforts ofÂ President Bush and other Western leaders. I am pleased toÂ announce the following package of measures:</p>
<ul><li>Australia will provide Poland with a food package to theÂ amount of A$ 5 million. The food will be supplied fromÂ Australia. The provision of food to Poland at this timeÂ is an important practical and political gesture to helpÂ anchor the reform process and assist Poland's newÂ Government.</li>
<li>The Australian System of Tariff Preferences ( ASTP) willÂ be extended to Poland and Hungary. Dutiable importsÂ from both countries will be admitted at ASTP rates whichÂ are five percentage points below the general tariff.Â Our extension of ASTP is consistent with approachesÂ already adopted or in train in various otherÂ preference-giving countries. Extension of ASTP benefitsÂ to both countries will take effect as soon as theÂ necessary legislative arrangements are completed.</li>
<li>Australia will conclude Double Taxation Agreements withÂ Poland and Hungary. Negotiations with Hungary haveÂ begun and negotiations with the Polish Government areÂ planned for the first half of 1990. once in force,Â these treaties will encourage the flow of trade andÂ investments with Poland and Hungary.</li>
<li>Australia will offer both Poland and Hungary the use ofÂ the International Trade-Development Centres in SydneyÂ and Melbourne as a means of assisting them withÂ marketing their exports in the Australia market.</li>
<li>Australia will explore with Hungary the establishment ofÂ a trade credit facility, along similar lines to creditÂ arrangements already provided to Poland by theÂ Australian Trade Commission.</li>
<li>Australia will respond positively to the requests byÂ Poland and Hungary to negotiate Investment ProtectionÂ Agreements which will safeguard Australian investmentsÂ in Poland and Hungary as will as extending reciprocalÂ benefits to these two countries.</li>
</ul><p>Australia already extends " Most Favoured Nation" treatmentÂ to Poland and Hungary and works closely with both countriesÂ in GATT. Hungary is a member of the Cairns Group of FairÂ Traders in agricultural products.</p>
<p>I know that all Australians will welcome the newÂ opportunities for greater international understanding thatÂ developments in Eastern Europe are now presenting. TheÂ package of measures I have just announced represents anÂ important part of Australia's efforts to allow these Â opportunities to succeed.Â </p>
