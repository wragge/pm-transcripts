FOR MEDIA 26 SEPTEMBER 1989<br />
I warmly welcome President Bush's proposals for<br />
eliminating chemical weapons stockpiles made in his<br />
speech to the United Nations General Assembly and which<br />
he detailed in a personal letter to me yesterday.<br />
President Bush's announcements are the latest of three<br />
significant advances towards banning chemical weapons,<br />
which have taken place over the last week.<br />
Australia has just hosted the Government Industry<br />
Conference Against Chemical Weapons a unique event<br />
in which 65 Governments reaffirmed their commitment to a<br />
comprehensive Chemical Weapons Convention at the<br />
earliest date and the world's chemical industry declared<br />
for the first time its collective support for a<br />
Convention. I congratulate Senator Evans and his Departmental<br />
officials for all their hard work, energy and commitment<br />
which ensured the success of the Conference.<br />
At their meeting on 22-23 September in Wyoming,<br />
Secretary of State Baker and Foreign Minister<br />
Shevardnadze signed a memorandum of understanding<br />
regarding a bilateral verificatibn experiment and data<br />
exchange with the aim of facilitating the process of<br />
negotiation, signature and ratification of the Global<br />
Convention. President Bush's proposals build on the progress<br />
achieved in the Geneva negotiations, the Canberra<br />
Government Industry Conference, and the bilateral<br />
discussions between the United States and the Soviet<br />
Union, the only two countries which admit to possessing<br />
chemical weapons.-<br />
There are still challenges to meet as we advance to our<br />
common goal of a worldwide ban on these barbarous and<br />
indiscriminate weapons. I believe that the events of<br />
the last week are a quantum leap forward. I am more<br />
hopeful than ever that the remaining substantive issues<br />
for negotiation can be completed within the coming year.<br />
2020 </p>
<p>The announcement that President Bush and Chairman<br />
Gorbachev will hold a summit meeting in the United<br />
States in the northern Spring/ Summer is also to be<br />
warmly welcomed. I am delighted at the considerable<br />
Srange of issues, including indications of further cuts<br />
in strategic weapons, on which the USA and USSR were<br />
able to make progress in their Wyoming talks.<br />
I fully agree with President Bush, however, that the<br />
problem of chemical weapons is a global one, which can<br />
only be solved with the active support of many nations.<br />
We must all work together. Australia will continue to<br />
work tirelessly until the global tonvention against<br />
chemical weapons is a reality and chemical weapons are<br />
banned by all countries for all time. 2021 </p>
