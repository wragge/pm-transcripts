TRANSCRIPT OfV NEWS CONPKEREC, TM HON PETER STAPLES' Pp<br />
ELECTORATE/ MZNISTERIAL OFFICE, HEIDELBERG, 24 APRIL 1989<br />
a 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawks how do you feel about Mr Fraser's<br />
comments over the weekend?<br />
PMts Well I feel much more relaxed about them than John<br />
Howard does. I think it was a fairly obvious statement, the<br />
fact that the Liberal Party was going to have any chance it<br />
has got to be representative of much broader strands than<br />
the way it's going. It is as Mr Macphee says, all the<br />
machinations within the Liberal Party and within the<br />
conservative parties and the National Party as well, are to<br />
push it more and more towards the hard right and Mr Macphee<br />
and Mr Fraser are not wrong about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you surprised that Mr Fraser would buy into<br />
it?<br />
PMs No I haven't really thought about whether I'm surprised<br />
about that. He was obviously being pressed by Mr Macphee to<br />
do so and he obviously thought that the issues were<br />
* Iportant enough. I mean no-one's had more vigorous and<br />
canventrated disagreements with Mr Fraser than have I. But<br />
there are certain fundamental issues on which he has been<br />
very sound and those include particularly the issues of<br />
race, immigration and colour and that's why I've been<br />
supporting him in his attempt to get the secretaryship of<br />
the Commonwealth and he obviously believes that those<br />
fundamental issues are at risk in this push against Mr<br />
Macphee and that Mr Macphee warrants support because of the<br />
importance of those issues.<br />
JOURNALISTS On the same level, are you concerned about the<br />
challenge to Mr Dawkins in Perth?<br />
PM: No and more importantly neither is Mr Dawkins.<br />
JOURNALISTs Prime Minister is there any significance in<br />
your teeing up an overseas trip as Prime Minister for twelve<br />
months time in regard to an election?<br />
PM: No, no. You'd have to have a convoluted mind to work<br />
out any problems in that. I mean I can't and don't wish to<br />
change the date of Anzac Day. There's nothing I can do<br />
about that and nor did I want to. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
JOURNALISTs Maybe it ' s your confidence that still being<br />
Prime minister in twelve months time whether there's an<br />
election before or after, isthat it?<br />
pz~ s Well I think it follows that if there hasn't been an<br />
election there's no move against me is there Peter?<br />
STAPLES: Not that I<br />
PM: No# no there's no move against me within the Party so<br />
i'll be Prime Minister before the election and we're<br />
confident of winning the next election. Sogyou have to plan<br />

Air rorce facilities to enable a contingent of veterans to<br />
go over there for the 75th anniversary of Anhac Day. rt's<br />
been put to me that it would be appropriate for the Prime<br />
minister to be with them and I think my commitment to the<br />
veterans of Australia has been very well established.' So it<br />
would give me particular pleasure to be able to be with them<br />
there on that important day, which is a day an i said in<br />
opening this new ward at Heidleberg earlier today, Anzac Day<br />
was something which is really in a sense defines the spirit<br />
and the consciousness of Australia in so many ways. go it<br />
would be good to be there.<br />
jouRNALIST: Mr Hawks will you sending any more assistance<br />
to Papua New Guinea, perhaps RAAF assistance?<br />
PR: Let me say this. As far. as the agreements that we have<br />
with Papua New Guinea are concerned, the operation of those<br />
. agreements will continue, we've got people there helping in<br />
* te training of the defence forces of Papua New Guinea. The<br />
qistion of whether there'd be any more particular<br />
assistance is a matter which would need a specific request<br />
and a considered decision. Now that hasn't occured at this<br />
0 stage. I mean the main concern that we have as far as Papua<br />
New Guinea is concerned is that there be a resolution of<br />
what is a potentially very dangerous dispute in Bougainville<br />
where it* s not simply a question of some disaffection<br />
amongst some people j-either representing or purportins to<br />
represent land owners there as owner is purporting to ~ o<br />
but the dimension of that problem can be greater. I moan it<br />
can go to the very question of the viability of the existing<br />
constitutional structure of-Papua New Guinea and therefore<br />
one has to be very careful in considering this issue, that<br />
you don't look at it merely in terms of some conflict and<br />
quasi military conflict on Bougainville but it's got to be<br />
looked at in terms of what does this mean for the polarity<br />
of Papua New Guinea. So we're monitoring the situationvery,<br />
very closely. I've been reading all the cables<br />
myself# I've read a lot over the weekend, and In just<br />
sending off our new High Commissioner last week I had him<br />
in and I told him that I wanted to be kept consistently<br />
informed of developments there because what happens in Papua<br />
New Guinea is not only important for the-people oftPapua New<br />
Guinea itself but clearly has significance for Australia in </p>
<p>-3-<br />
( PH cant) many terms. I mean there are 4000 Australians on<br />
Bougainville and any escalation of the conflict there could<br />
be potentially very dangerous for those 4000 Australian.<br />
So for whatever reason you want to look at it, Australia has<br />
a very significant interest in developments there.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister doss it frustrate you that given<br />
that you've ruled out an election this yea r, tha t you can't<br />
make use therefore of the electoral godsend represented by<br />
both the disunity within the coalition and within the<br />
Liberal Party itself?<br />
Px: Well of cause that question assumes that they are going<br />
to overcome in the short term their problems. Now they are<br />
not. They are not because am I said earlier today in<br />
opening Peter's office, their problem arises from a very<br />
simple tact, they have no beliefs. I mean they have been in<br />
opposition now for 6 years, that's a very signi ficant fact,<br />
they've been in opposition for 6 year.. They still haven't<br />
agreed on their basic policies Why? Because they don't<br />
believe in anything. They-have been in government in the<br />
past so often because we in the Labor Party couldn't<br />
govern ourselves and delivered government to them on a<br />
plate, but we have learnt. We have learnt that you have to<br />
have policies so in opposition we developed policies and<br />
policies that were relevant to the present and the future<br />
and were not Just rehashes of a faded past. Now they<br />
haven't got policies and they have no sign of getting them,<br />
of getting relevant policies, And in that circumstance they<br />
are going to be characterized by this internal fratricide<br />
which mind you isn't new, it's happening at the moment. it<br />
UJ~ t happens to be getting a sort of dramatic surfacing, if<br />
you like, because they've got some preselection ballots<br />
cfting up. But the fundamental hatreds that exist between<br />
Mr macphee and the right wing of his Party, that just hasn't<br />
emerged now, it's just come to the surface dramatically<br />

the divisions between the Liberal Party and the Country<br />
Party. They just happen to be surfacing at the moment<br />
because you've got questions Of joint Senate tickets and<br />
preselections in the Party. They are not going to go away.<br />
