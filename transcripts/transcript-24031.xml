    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>BRIG:</strong></p>
<p>The Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, good morning.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Brig, what a pleasure to talk to you Happy Christmas and Happy Christmas to all your listeners.</p>
<p><strong>BRIG:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much. Now, Robert Doyle is being a bit mean to us and not letting us get a lane for Molly Meldrum here in Melbourne, Mr Abbott. Would you mind putting in your piece?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, there is no doubt Molly is a great Australian and certainly that would be a good way, I suppose, of immortalising him. So it sounds like a really good idea but as the Lord Mayor was saying there is always a process and you have got to follow the process.</p>
<p><strong>LEHMO:</strong></p>
<p>But surely it helps the process if it has got prime ministerial support.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, look, I am happy to give it my endorsement but in the end Robert has got the council rules that he will have to follow; but something to honour Molly who has been an inspiration to millions, I think, would be a really good thing.</p>
<p><strong>LEHMO:</strong></p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>BRIG:</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. Now, what are you up to for Christmas, Prime Minister?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, Brig, it is just the usual Abbott Christmas. We will spend the day probably eating too much and unwrapping pressies which will be nice. Then, I guess, in January there is the usual trip down the South Coast of New South Wales with some of my uni mates and their kids if their kids still want to come with the oldies. So, it is the same Christmas tradition that has been followed by our family for about 15 years.</p>
<p><strong>BRIG:</strong></p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p><strong>LEHMO:</strong></p>
<p>Now, Prime Minister, with your daughters there at Christmas time do you make them many promises leading up to Christmas and how is your strike rating on keeping those promises come Christmas Day?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, the promise is normally to do ones best; to be a better parent, to be a better spouse – they’re usually the promises. As you know sometimes circumstances get in the way but, look, we will all do our best with one another.</p>
<p><strong>BRIG:</strong></p>
<p>Fantastic. Well it’s very nice to speak to you Prime Minister. We wish you a very Merry Christmas and thank you for calling in today.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Brig, it is always a pleasure to talk and I look forward to talking to you in the New Year.</p>
<p><strong>BRIG:</strong></p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
