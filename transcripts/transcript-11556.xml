    <content><![CDATA[<p>Warwick Parer's decision to retire from Parliament is understandable</p>
<p> given more than 15 years of service as a Senator for Queensland.</p>
<p>He was an extremely competent Minister for Resources between March 1996</p>
<p> and October 1998.</p>
<p>Warwick Parer brought to that portfolio an understanding of the industry</p>
<p> which won him the respect of his departmental advisers and those with</p>
<p> whom he had contact in the industry.</p>
<p>During his time as a Senator Warwick travelled widely in Queensland and</p>
<p> always displayed an intimate knowledge of the diverse interests and character</p>
<p> of that State.</p>
<p>A person of complete integrity and probity, Warwick and I enjoyed each</p>
<p> other's company. He and his wife Kathi became and remain friends</p>
<p> to my wife and I.</p>
<p>I thank him for his services to the Government, the people of Queensland</p>
<p> and to the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>I wish him and his family every good fortune in the future.</p>
