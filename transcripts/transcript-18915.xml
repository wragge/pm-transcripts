<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced that Australia will fund the $50 million Australia-Asia Program to combat Trafficking in Persons, which will reduce trafficking in persons by strengthening criminal justice systems in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Investigators and prosecutors will be supported to increase convictions and reduce opportunities for trafficking, while victims of trafficking will be supported through the criminal justice process.</p>
<p>Trafficking in persons is a global issue that ruins the lives of its victims and profoundly affects their families and communities.</p>
<p>The International Labour Organization estimates that, each year, more than 20 million people become trapped in situations of forced labour globally.</p>
<p>Women and young people are particularly vulnerable, with school age girls often forced into conditions of exploitative labour, domestic work, or prostitution.</p>
<p>The program is part of the joint work being carried out by Australia with ASEAN members to combat trafficking in persons.</p>
