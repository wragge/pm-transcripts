The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, today announced that Australia will help the Pacific Island states to improve their food security and economic development by boosting funding for fisheries programs.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard said today that Australia will provide an additional $4.7 million to help Pacific Island countries maximise their returns from fish resources while safeguarding stocks for future food security.</p>
<p>The funds will support sustainable fisheries for inland and coastal communities in the Pacific and will be provided over four years.  </p>
<p>Australia's support will improve the monitoring and assessment of snapper stocks. The funding will also strengthen the monitoring of the region's tuna stocks to support their effective management.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard said it is vital we conserve and sustainably manage coastal fisheries to ensure the food security of the region.</p>
<p>For many Pacific Island populations, 70 to 90 per cent of animal protein comes from fish, principally from subsistence and small scale coastal fishing. Offshore fishing is also a critical part of many Pacific Island economies, accounting for an estimated 10,000 jobs and contributing around US$244 million to the region's Gross Domestic Product. </p>
<p>A strong, economically stable Pacific region is important and Australia should do its part as the largest economy in the South Pacific region.</p>
<p>Australia will work with Pacific island states to support strengthened fisheries management and combat the illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing that poses a real threat to the sustainability of the region's fish stocks.</p>
<p>This latest funding forms part of Australia's commitment in 2009 to increase Pacific fisheries assistance by $23.5 million over four years. It builds on Australia's ongoing support for regional fisheries organisations including the Forum Fisheries Agency and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard is in Auckland for the 43rd Pacific Islands Forum. </p>
