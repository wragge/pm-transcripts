<p>SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
DECISION-MAKERS' LUNCHEON PERTH 19 APRIL 1984<br />
I am very pleased to be back once again on my home groundeven<br />
if the circumstances aren't quite as memorable as they<br />
were last time I was here.<br />
One year ago at the time of the National Economic Summit<br />
Conference Australia was in the worst recession since the.<br />
Great Depression.<br />
For the first time in 30 years there was-negative economic<br />
growth. And unemployment had exploded by more than a quarter of a<br />
million over the previous year.<br />
You only have to recall that period of virtual crisis 12<br />
months ago to realize just how much the economic outlook has<br />
changed in one short year.<br />
Twelve months ago at the Summit Conference there was really<br />
only one challenge facing Australia to reverse the tragic<br />
slide deeper and deeper into recession.<br />
Twelve months later one thing is clear -we have met that<br />
challenge. In the second half of last year economic growth began again<br />
with a vengeance.<br />
Today employment is growing once more, profits have<br />
increased stronyly, inflation is falling, interest rates are<br />
down and confidence is returning.<br />
The economic recovery has begun.<br />
But Australia now faces a new and very different challenge.<br />
That challenge is to sustain the momentum of the recovery<br />
that is now underway and to sustain it. not just for 6<br />
months or 12 months but year after year.<br />
We have to make economic growth and prosperity a permanent<br />
feature of our way of life. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Of course, nobody in this audience needs to be told just how~<br />
difficult that is going to be.<br />
But provided we as a Government, and as a nation, approach<br />
it in the right way, that challenge can be met and will be<br />
met. Role of Private Sector<br />
However, in facing this challenge we need to remember one<br />
fundamental point.<br />
There is no way there will a sustained economy ' recovery,<br />
there is no way there will be a return to prosperity without<br />
a healthy, vigorous, profitable private sector.<br />
That is beyond question.<br />
So I have no hesitation in reiterating here m-y fundamental<br />
commitment, and that of this Government, to the private<br />
sector's central role in our mixed economy.<br />
We as a Government recognize the inescapable fact that the<br />
key to sustaining the economic recovery lies in the<br />
potential contribution a strong and dynamic private sector<br />
can make given the support and backing of the national<br />
government. A related commitment is also vital.<br />
This is our commitment to sustained economic growth.<br />
Growth allows us to make provision for Australians in need.<br />
Growth enables governments to ease the burden of taxation.<br />
Growth means an expanding cake with workers and employers<br />
able to meet their legitimate aspirations without turning on<br />
each other.<br />
Growth means rising productivity, allowing wage earners'<br />
living standards to rise without fuelling inflation or<br />
creating unemployment.<br />
And above all growth creates jobs for Australians young and<br />
old. These were the fundamental realities recognised in the<br />
communique issued at the end of the historic National<br />
Economic Summit last year..<br />
But it's one thing to be committed to Sustained,<br />
non-inflationary economic growth and a revitalized private<br />
sector. It's quite another to have the framework and policies for<br />
that to occur, </p>
<p>3.<br />
The Federal Government is squarely addressing the challenge<br />
of sustaining non-inflationary economic growth.<br />
Our policies are geared, above all, to maintaining the<br />
momentum of the recovery.<br />
We recognise that to do this will require a sustained<br />
improvement in private sector investment.<br />
Private investment is normally the last component of demand<br />
to pick up in an economic recovery.<br />
But it is an essential component of sustained recovery.<br />
There are three matters as important as any for a long-term<br />
investment improvement and a sustained recovery.<br />
These are : first, a balanced fiscal policy; second, a<br />
workable wages policy; and third, a forward-looking industry<br />
policy. Let me address them in turn.<br />
Fiscal Policy<br />
In the case of the first~ matter fiscal policy the<br />
Government must put together its Budgets with a careful<br />
view to the impact they will have on private sector<br />
activity. This impact will vary with the circumstances of the time.<br />
Last year, for example, the economy was in the depths of<br />
recession. A contractionary Budget would only have aggravated the<br />
rece'ssion and so hurt the private sector.<br />
What was needed was a reasonably expansionary Budget to<br />
provide a floor for demand and so enable private sector<br />
activity to pick up.<br />
But it had to be a responsible expansion kept* within the<br />
limits necessary to allow moderation of the high interest<br />
rates prevailing when we took office.<br />
That's what our last Budget was about and that strategy is<br />
working. Within that Budget strategy., inflation is falling.<br />
The Consumer Price Index rose by 8.6 per cent in the year to<br />
the December Quarter the lowest increase for over 4 years.<br />
And further reductions in inflation are in the pipeline. </p>
<p>Within that. Budget strategy also, the economy is now growing<br />
remarkably. Growth in non-farm product is expected to be a stunning 8<br />
per cent through this financial year compared with<br />
negative growth in the previous year.<br />
In ad dition employment has risen by 210,000 since April of<br />
last year.<br />
And within that Budget strategy, the deficit financing task<br />
has been achieved in the context of very significant falls<br />
in interest rates.<br />
So last year's Budget is clearly working.<br />
But in drawing up this year's Budget we face very different<br />
circumstances. The economy is on the move again and the private sector is<br />
starting to increase its demands on capital markets.<br />
We now -need a Budget that maintains a degree of fiscal<br />
stimulus to keep growth moving but which ensures that<br />
government financing demands do not place upward pressure on<br />
interest rates as private investment strengthens in the<br />
course of economic recovery.<br />
Accordingly we will significantl. y reduce the deficit in this<br />
year's Budget.<br />
At the same time we will make sure the deficit reduction is<br />
not so large as to pull the rug from under domestic demand<br />
and choke off growth.<br />
We struck exactly the right balance in 1983/ 84.<br />
We will strike the right balance again in the coming<br />
financial year.<br />
The hallmark of the Government's fiscal policy will continue<br />
to be: balance, flexibility, responsibility.<br />
Wages Policy<br />
A second area crucial to sustained economic recovery is<br />
wages policy.<br />
Australia needs a wages policy that is coherent, that is<br />
equitable and, above all, that is workable.<br />
That's exactly what the Federal Government has put in place<br />
for Australia.<br />
The Government's wages policy is centred around a<br />
disciplined central1ised wages syStem and is underpinned by<br />
the Prices and Inco~ mes Accord. </p>
<p>Our policy gives Australia the assurance of long-term wage<br />
moderation. Furthermore, wage rises in the short term will be ver y<br />
small. Because of the effects of Medicare on the Consumer Price<br />
Index, the National Wage Case increase later this year<br />
will only be about 1 to 2 per cent.<br />
The following National Wage Case decision won't-occur until<br />
March or April of next year.<br />
Business can therefore look ahead to almost a year of<br />
minimal wage rises.<br />
Of course, the business community would have preferred lower<br />
wage increases than occurred in the last two National Wage<br />
Cases. This is understandable.<br />
However, what Australia needs is a wages policy geared to<br />
the requirements of long-term economic recovery not a<br />
wages policy for recession.<br />
What we have put in place will serve AuStralia well in the<br />
period of economic recovery and growth that is ahead of us.<br />
Against that background the wage rises that have so far<br />
occurred are very much an investment in the future a<br />
future of wage moderation and therefore a future that will<br />
bring immense long-term benefits to business.<br />
Already we are seeing the benefits. The latest national<br />
accounts figures show that in the second half of last year,<br />
the profits share of GDP was the highest since the first<br />
half of the 1970s.<br />
Unit labour costs, after being way out of line for several<br />
years, are now close to the levels of the late 1960s and<br />
early 1970s.<br />
A year of continued wage moderation within the Prices and<br />
Incomes Accord will take unit labour costs back to those<br />
earlier levels.<br />
The last thing Australia needs is a wages surge that will<br />
choke off the economic recovery.<br />
However, that's what the Opposition has effectively proposed<br />
for Australia with their wages policy.<br />
That wages policy and I use the term ' wages policy'<br />
advisedly would hardly be put into effect belfore it came<br />
crashing down and brought the economic recovery crashing<br />
down with it. </p>
<p>The Opposition's wages policy would be a recipe for a wages<br />
explosion led by the most highly organised sections of the<br />
industrial movement.<br />
At the same time it would threaten the living standards of<br />
more vulnerable workers.<br />
The Opposition's wages policy would divide Australia.<br />
It would returbn this country to the politics of<br />
confrontation, the politics of division.<br />
Australia has had enough of confrontation.<br />
We've had enough of divisiveness.<br />
What Australia needs is co-operation and consensus and a<br />
wages policy that embodies those elements a wages policy<br />
that puts the mistakes of the past behind us -and looks to<br />
the future.<br />
That's what this Government alone can offer.<br />
All the Opposition can offer is a wages explosion, an<br />
upsurge in strikes and a. n end to the recovery.<br />
Industry Policy<br />
As well as fiscal policy and wages policy, a third area of<br />
policy vital to sustaining the recovery is industry policy.<br />
Over the years successive Australian Governments have been<br />
unable to come to terms with the requirements of a<br />
forward-looking industry policy.<br />
This has undoubtedly contributed to Australia's relatively<br />
poor economic growth performance.<br />
The Australian economy over the past two or three decades<br />
has registered economic growth rates on average well below<br />
those countries with which we normally compare ourselves.<br />
We have squandered our national opportunities.<br />
Perhaps the heart of the problem has been our incapacity to<br />
adapt to change and to take advantage at' the opportunities<br />
provided by change.<br />
What Australia needs is a more constructive, forward-looking<br />
industry policy, one which encourages Australian industry to<br />
respond Positively to change and to become more dynamic,<br />
flexible and outward-looking.<br />
At the same time the Government needs to ensure that the<br />
pace of change is gradual and that no one group is asked to<br />
bear an undue share of the b~ urden of adjustment. </p>
<p>The Federal Government is already laying the groundwork for<br />
this new approach to industry policy.<br />
Earlier this year, at my instigation, the Government<br />
established a Special Group of Ministers, chaired by Senato z<br />
Button, to coordinate work in areas relevant to structural<br />
change. These areas include trade, education, training and<br />
retraining, science and technology, employment and<br />
industrial relations and defence support.<br />
Th-e Group is receiving strong back-up from a study group ofe<br />
senior officials established to facilitate its work.<br />
Those officers have been chosen not as departmental<br />
representatives but-because of their special skills and<br />
experience. I believe the work of the Group of Ministers will make an<br />
important contribution to developing a more positive<br />
industry policy.<br />
The Government has also initiated very useful discussions of'<br />
industry policy in the Economic Planning Advisory Council<br />
( EPAC).<br />
Following its March meeting EPAC issued a very constructive<br />
statement calling for an active industry development<br />
strategy for Australia.<br />
In the steel industry the Government has introduced policies<br />
which I believe are a model for how Australia should go<br />
about industry restructuring.<br />
Our historic Steel Industry Plan puts the industry firmly on<br />
the path of higher productivity, lower protection and<br />
greater international competitiveness.<br />
Both sides of industry unions and employers support the<br />
Plan and are committed to making it work.<br />
This approach to industry policy, which we are fostering,<br />
will help ensure that Australia takes advantage of the<br />
opportunities for economic growth that lie before us.<br />
So in each of these areas I have spoken about fiscal<br />
policy, wages policy and industry policy the Federal<br />
Government has policies which will help to sustain the<br />
economic recovery.<br />
We have a balanced fiscal policy, a workable wages policy<br />
and a forward-looking industry policy.<br />
These policies are helping to revitalize the private sector. </p>
<p>8.<br />
They are laying the bas is for recovery through the Eighties<br />
and beyond.<br />
Continuity in Policy<br />
But there is a further matter just as important as the ones<br />
I've mentioned.<br />
This concerns the way economic policy is put together.<br />
This Government has brought back stability and cont inuity<br />
to economic policy.<br />
Our policies are following a clear path. They have a clear<br />
purpose, a clear direction.<br />
This means the business community knows where it stands.<br />
Business can be confident about our management of the<br />
economy in the short-term.<br />
It can also be confident we are addressing the issues vital<br />
for medium and long-term growth.<br />
Business knows what our policies are and where we're going.<br />
And it can plan for the future confidently with that<br />
knowledge. I believe that is a very significant achievement.<br />
It distinguishes our performance dramatically from our<br />
predecessors. The previous Government was totally confused on economic<br />
policy. It was hopelessly divided and it chopped and<br />
chanlged incessantly.<br />
Business didn't know where the Government was going and the<br />
Government didn't even know itself.<br />
Worse still, business was ignored more and more by the<br />
previous Government and eventually frozen out altogether<br />
from any positive role in economic policy.<br />
This Government, however, has brought business back in from<br />
the cold.<br />
Business played a key role in the Economic Summit<br />
Conference. Business is now playing a key role in the Economic Planning<br />
Advisory Council.<br />
We've gone to great lengths to talk to business, to listen<br />
to business, to consult with business. </p>
<p>That's ar it should be.<br />
In this spirit of cooperation, I am pleased to announce that<br />
the Government has decided to appoint a Business Advisory<br />
Group to advise the Federal Government on the special needs<br />
of Western Australia's employers and its economy generally.<br />
This will complement moves we are taking to improve our<br />
consultations with the trade union movement in Western<br />
Australia. I have asked the Minister for Finance to announce the.<br />
details of this significant development later next week.<br />
I can, howeve r, say to you that the tyranny of distance and<br />
the costs that this imposes are well understood by us.<br />
By appointing an exclusively Western Australia n group to<br />
advise us on your special problems, we will ensbre that youir<br />
voice is heard in Cabinet and your problems attended to.<br />
What this Government is about is harnessing the talents, the<br />
capacities, the imagination of all Australians for our<br />
national advancement.<br />
I have said consistently that we do not believe that we have<br />
a monopoly of wisdom and experience.<br />
We look to advice from the whole community in developing<br />
policies to take Australia forward.<br />
And this applies very m uch to the business community.<br />
We greatly welcwiie the contribution that you have been<br />
making. Ultimately, this Government is a partner with the trade<br />
union movement and with business in the one enterprise the<br />
creation of a long term national recovery for Australia.<br />
Both Government and business have a common vital interest in<br />
the recovery.<br />
We must succeed in that enterprise.<br />
And, working together, we will succeed. </p>
