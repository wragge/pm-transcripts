    <content><![CDATA[<p>
Well, ladies and gentlemen, starting with this afternoon and this</p>
<p> evening is the intensive part of my visit to the United States. I'll</p>
<p> be seeing the President tomorrow and I'll be talking to Dr Alan Greenspan</p>
<p> this evening. It's always an interesting experience talking to Dr</p>
<p> Greenspan given his immense responsibilities and enormous success</p>
<p> as undoubtedly the most significant economic administrator and regulator,</p>
<p> not only in the United States, but in the entire world.</p>
<p>The issues that I'll be raising with the President obviously include</p>
<p> the Australian Government's intense disappointment regarding the American</p>
<p> decision regarding lamb imports. However that won't, of course, be</p>
<p> the only issue that I'll raise. The full gamut of the bilateral relationship</p>
<p> will be canvassed. No doubt we'll discuss in some detail the present</p>
<p> situation in Indonesia and East Timor and we'll be putting certain</p>
<p> views regarding not only Australian policy but also United States</p>
<p> policy regarding Indonesia.</p>
<p>I'll be interested to get his assessment of the current situation</p>
<p> in Yugoslavia and in the wake of the cease fire and the apparent pressure</p>
<p> developing on the Milosevic Government, I will renew my entreaties</p>
<p> to him in relation to our two aid workers, Pratt and Wallace. The</p>
<p> Australian Government remains still very concerned about their situation</p>
<p> and we'll seek every opportunity we can, not only with President Clinton,</p>
<p> but also with other world leaders as I did with the Prime Minister</p>
<p> of Japan, Mr Obuchi, a few days ago to intercede on their behalf.</p>
<p>We still don't know what is going to happen. We remain hopeful, we</p>
<p> remain optimistic. The briefing I received from the Australian Ambassador</p>
<p> in Belgrade last weekend when he returned to Australia was positive</p>
<p> although indeterminate as to when he thought it likely that Steve</p>
<p> Pratt and Peter Wallace would be released.</p>
<p>The visit to the United States gives me an opportunity not only to</p>
<p> talk to the President and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, I'll</p>
<p> also have a chance of talking to the newly installed Treasury Secretary,</p>
<p> Mr Summers, who, of course, along with Robert Rubin and Alan Greenspan</p>
<p> have formed something of an economic troika advising the President</p>
<p> over the past couple of years. Both countries, of course, are enjoying</p>
<p> almost unprecedented sustained levels of economic growth and the experience</p>
<p> of both of us in that regard I am sure will be instructive. The indications</p>
<p> are that the American economic boom ought to continue. There are no</p>
<p> apparent reasons on the horizon, as far as I can see, as to why that</p>
<p> should be interrupted although some people operate on the principal</p>
<p> that nothing goes on forever, but certainly the signs now are extremely</p>
<p> good and they are certainly better in the experience I have had observing</p>
<p> the American economy; they're certainly stronger and they're certainly</p>
<p> better than they have been at any time over the last 25 years.</p>
<p>After being in Washington I'll be going to New York where, of course,</p>
<p> the focus will be very much built around our ambitions to see Australia</p>
<p> and I guess by dint of the accumulation of financial businesses there,</p>
<p> Sydney, become a world financial centre. We have gone a long way towards</p>
<p> making Australia more attractive; not only our economic strength,</p>
<p> our good record of corporate governance, of prudential banking supervision</p>
<p> but also the tax changes that we have made and others that are in</p>
<p> prospect as a result of the recommendations of the Ralph Committee.</p>
<p>So it will be a very intensive period of days but it's time extremely</p>
<p> well spent. This does remain still by any measure the most important</p>
<p> relationship that Australia has, although we have a number of very</p>
<p> important bilateral relationships. But we should remind ourselves</p>
<p> against the background of our understandable anger over lamb that</p>
<p> our exports to the United States in 1998 raised by 34 per cent. And</p>
<p> it is because its economy is so strong it's an extremely good market</p>
<p> for Australia. And one of the reasons why we have been able to avoid</p>
<p> the worse ravages of the Asian economic downturn was that we were</p>
<p> able to divert a lot of the exports that might otherwise have gone</p>
<p> to Asia and indeed some new ones that wouldn't have gone to Asia anyway,</p>
<p> to North America and to Europe. And part of the success that we have</p>
<p> had in avoiding the worst of that downturn is precisely because we</p>
<p> have been able to find new markets and new opportunities in the United</p>
<p> States. But, of course, that doesn't in any way absolve the administration</p>
<p> from the criticism it has received from the decision has taken in</p>
<p> relation to lamb but, of course, that will not be the only issue but</p>
<p> it will be certainly an issue at the top of the agenda when I see</p>
<p> the President tomorrow. Any questions?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, will you be putting on the table our security relationship</p>
<p> in light of the lamb decision as Agricultural Minister Vaile believes</p>
<p> you will?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I didn't read his comments to mean that but let me make it perfectly</p>
<p> clear as the head of the Government there's no way that our security</p>
<p> relationship is on the table. They're two quite separate things. And</p>
<p> the thing that dominates my attitude to all of these things is the</p>
<p> Australian national interest as I have said before. The Australian</p>
<p> national interest is well served by the security relationship. It</p>
<p> always has been and it will in the future and there's absolutely no</p>
<p> way that you put one on the table with the other; they are two quite</p>
<p> separate issues. And there is a separate, discrete, clear Australian</p>
<p> national interest involved in a close security relationship with the</p>
<p> United States. It has always been my view. I don't think you will</p>
<p> find at any time in the comments I have made on this issue as Prime</p>
<p> Minister, as Leader of the Opposition, as Treasurer or indeed as anything</p>
<p> else, I have ever suggested that you should put the security relationship</p>
<p> on the line. And I don't believe Mark Vaile said that. Anyway, our</p>
<p> position is abundantly clear from the comment I have made now and</p>
<p> what I made a couple of days ago.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you announced some assistance for the lamb industry</p>
<p> when objecting to the American decision. In terms of the nine per</p>
<p> cent tariff, is there anything further you can do in terms of helping</p>
<p> with marketing that would be able to offset that nine per cent so</p>
<p> that we can at least obtain market share?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we will in the course of our discussions, and I expect to have</p>
<p> a full report on some of the discussions that are taking place between</p>
<p> our Agriculture Department and the industry, we will do whatever we</p>
<p> can, consistent, of course, with World Trade Organisation rules to</p>
<p> assist with marketing. I mean, our point all along has been that these</p>
<p> blokes have won a market share without any kind of government assistance</p>
<p> and what we have sought to do with the levy is to offset the cost</p>
<p> of the tariff that's been imposed on. I mean, if there are other ways</p>
<p> consistent with what I announced last week to help in relation to</p>
<p> marketing we will but obviously there are limitations to that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, when you've talked about lamb here or in other press</p>
<p> conferences you used very strong language. How strong will your language</p>
<p> be..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, my language will be appropriately strong. I don't, as you know,</p>
<p> I don't script things. And I'll put my view and I can't tell you precisely</p>
<p> in advance what precise words I use because as you know I don't script</p>
<p> things, I just say what I think at the particular time.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you formally ask the President to reverse the decision even though</p>
<p> you know that's a remote..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look, I don't think there's any prospect that the Americans</p>
<p> are going to reverse the decision. We will.look, I will make all the</p>
<p> requests that are appropriate, I will enter all of the protests that</p>
<p> are appropriate. I think to be realistic the Americans are not going</p>
<p> to change the decision but they should not be left in any doubt both</p>
<p> as a result of things that I have said publicly. They would now be</p>
<p> in no doubt as to how we feel but clearly tomorrow is an opportunity</p>
<p> for me to convey in a personal forum to the President the concern</p>
<p> that Australians feel and the sense of being let down that they feel</p>
<p> about this particular decision. Now, I don't expect the President</p>
<p> to say to me tomorrow: well John, we are going to change it. I don't</p>
<p> expect that. But that won't stop me asking but I don't expect that</p>
<p> is going to happen. I mean, we have to be realistic about that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, will you be asking for a commitment from President Clinton</p>
<p> on APEC and on free trade, you know, in light of the lamb decision?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I would expect that I will receive from him tomorrow a commitment,</p>
<p> a reaffirmation of his view rather than a bilateral commitment, a</p>
<p> reaffirmation of his view that the APEC process should go on. I would</p>
<p> expect that the American response will be that lamb should be seen</p>
<p> in the context of particular circumstances and that the American commitment</p>
<p> to freer trade remains undiminished. I mean, we obviously have said</p>
<p> some things about that and I think you'll be aware of those. But I</p>
<p> would expect that I will certainly nonetheless emphasize our commitment</p>
<p> to a good APEC outcome. We would like a leaders' declaration coming</p>
<p> out of the APEC meeting about a new trade round and it does remain</p>
<p> the case that although we are bitterly disappointed about what's happened</p>
<p> on lamb it does remain the case that we have had some real success</p>
<p> in a number of other areas in winning market access not only in relation</p>
<p> to agriculture but in a number of other areas but particularly in</p>
<p> relation to agriculture. But there are some, you know, outstanding</p>
<p> caveats on the American, very big caveats, on the American commitment</p>
<p> for free trade. I mean, we still remain very angry about a thing called</p>
<p> the Jones Act which denies market opportunities to burgeoning ship</p>
<p> building industry in Australia. We'd like to see the Americans sign</p>
<p> the OECD understanding that's been negotiated in relation to ship</p>
<p> building.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, in the context of American caveats Mark Vaile also</p>
<p> says that Australia should now pause in its trade liberalisation and</p>
<p> let the rest of the world catch up. Is that your view with the context</p>
<p> of APEC?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think it's certainly the case that Australia has compared</p>
<p> with most other countries Australia has done extremely well. I think</p>
<p> what has to happen is that we need a commitment from all of the APEC</p>
<p> members towards the original Bogor goals and we also need a commitment</p>
<p> from the APEC leaders towards a successful World Trade Organisation</p>
<p> outcome. I think that is what he has in mind, it's certainly what</p>
<p> the Government has in mind.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But is there anything in it for us to go any further and, in fact,</p>
<p> to do something like winding back a little bit..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, my view has always been that you look at the national interest</p>
<p> rather than who's fair or more open in their trading practices than</p>
<p> the next person. You look at the national interests. Now, what I believe</p>
<p> should be said is that we have gained a lot from a more open trading</p>
<p> system. And the reality is that Australia is a more prosperous country</p>
<p> now than it was 10 or 15 years ago. And the people who turn around,</p>
<p> and people who say that more open trade has hurt Australia are ignoring</p>
<p> the fact that we have in fact as a result of the efforts of the Cairns</p>
<p> Group we have won market access. I mean, we do have 30 per cent of</p>
<p> the import market for beef into Japan. Now, that's something that</p>
<p> we didn't have 10 years ago and that didn't come about other than</p>
<p> as a result of our pushing through the Cairns Group and through other</p>
<p> avenues to secure greater market access. So I think you have got to</p>
<p> keep this thing in perspective. The only reason that I argue for a</p>
<p> more open trading system is that I happen to think it's in Australia's</p>
<p> national interests. I am not doing it either for my political health</p>
<p> nor am I doing it for some kind of ideological commitment. I just</p>
<p> happen to think that when you are a nation of 18.5 million people</p>
<p> you still have a very strong and efficient agricultural industry.</p>
<p> You clearly need access to world markets for your manufacturers and</p>
<p> your service outputs. It's clearly in our interests to have a more</p>
<p> open trading system.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have you told Mark Vaile that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Mark Vaile is very well aware of that and I don't think anything he</p>
<p> has said is inconsistent with it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, do you agree with him that Australia has got far enough,</p>
<p> at least for now?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I believe that Australia has done very well. But it's not really the</p>
<p> point as to who has gone far enough. It's a question of what is in</p>
<p> our interests and it is in our interests to export more to the rest</p>
<p> of the world. And that's my total guide on this - what is the national</p>
<p> interest; not whether we have gone further than somebody else. I always</p>
<p> argue that we should do something out of the national interest. Now,</p>
<p> in relation to something like the motor vehicle industry I thought</p>
<p> the national interest was served by us having a further reduction</p>
<p> in assistance and then having a pause for five years. And that's why</p>
<p> we did it. And clearly in relation to agriculture it is in our national</p>
<p> interest to continue to argue for a more open system.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, on Kakadu where there is going to be a decision on</p>
<p> that made tomorrow, previously in these kinds of matters the Italian</p>
<p> Government has tended to decide with the environmentalists. This time</p>
<p> they are quite enthusiastically in favour of the Australian Government</p>
<p> and they have also offered $300,000 to set up a World Heritage Austral-Asian</p>
<p> unit within Australia.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They have?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Yes. What have you done to make them so enthusiastic?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I haven't done anything.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What's the Australian Government done?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not aware that the Australian Government has done anything other</p>
<p> than to argue very persuasively and very eloquently a very strong</p>
<p> case.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And what's your reading of the likely outcome?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know. I am always very cautious about sort of, you know, the</p>
<p> early returns.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, in terms of Pratt and Wallace what will you be asking</p>
<p> specifically the US President to do?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'll be reminding him, as I did when I spoke to him on the phone</p>
<p> a few weeks ago, that we would naturally want to see these men released.</p>
<p> I'll be asking him to and his administration to use whatever opportunities</p>
<p> arise to plead the case for their release. I think one of the strongest</p>
<p> arguments of course is that until this matter is resolved the future</p>
<p> level of aid activity from organisations like CARE in Yugoslavia is</p>
<p> going to be under a cloud.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The United Sates has been fairly preoccupied with Yugoslavia. Do you</p>
<p> think they should be paying more attention now, or putting more attention</p>
<p> on Timor? What sorts of things will you be discussing about that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'll be giving our assessment and our assessment of the state</p>
<p> of play in Indonesia and Timor is always of interest to the United</p>
<p> States because we have special knowledge and a special understanding</p>
<p> of the area that probably no other country has. The question of whether</p>
<p> they should devote more or less, well that's a matter for them. I</p>
<p> haven't come here to sort of give lectures publicly or privately to</p>
<p> the United States administration about the weighting of their foreign</p>
<p> policy focus. I think quite plainly they're perfectly capable as the</p>
<p> only true world power of walking and chewing gum at the same time</p>
<p> and they have a great capacity to do that. We are naturally very committed</p>
<p> to a good outcome in East Timor. We've played a significantly role</p>
<p> in getting a commitment from the Indonesian Government. We remain</p>
<p> very much of the view that the Indonesia Government deserves a great</p>
<p> deal of credit for two things. Firstly for the steps it's taken to</p>
<p> embrace democracy in Indonesia as a whole which is quite a historical</p>
<p> development and also the commitment to hold an open ballot. Now we</p>
<p> had worries about many of the activities in East Timor and they remain,</p>
<p> and Indonesia will suffer in the eyes of the world and the esteem</p>
<p> Indonesia has gained will be diminished if it's thought that an open</p>
<p> ballot is not allowed in East Timor. And I hope that every country</p>
<p> that expresses a view to Indonesia will convey that in the views that</p>
<p> it expresses.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, just two aspects, one arising out of that and one</p>
<p> not. One is that you said at the beginning in your opening remarks</p>
<p> that you wanted to discuss the certain aspects of US policy vis a</p>
<p> vis East Timor and Indonesia [inaudible]. And secondly, looking further</p>
<p> down the week to the business tax question, will you be able to tell</p>
<p> [inaudible] American audiences that the centrepiece of reform will</p>
<p> be a 30 per cent rate which some of your colleagues believe is the</p>
<p> key to marketing this tax change internationally..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Jim, I won't be able, nor will I even attempt to announce the</p>
<p> outcome of the Government's response to the Ralph recommendation,</p>
<p> we haven't got those recommendations yet, we won't have them until</p>
<p> the end of the month. I will be indicating areas of reform that I</p>
<p> think are needed to make Australia more attractive to the rest of</p>
<p> the world. I can't be as specific as to say what we're going to do</p>
<p> about rates, I don't know, I haven't got the report, I've got to hear</p>
<p> all the arguments. There are all sorts of options and combinations.</p>
<p> Clearly the debate about a 30 per cent rate and plus or minus things</p>
<p> like accelerated deprecation that's clearly going to be an essential</p>
<p> element of our consideration. But until I've got it all in and everybody</p>
<p> knows what Ralph is going to recommend, it's premature of me to say</p>
<p> well we're going to do this and this, but it's not premature of me</p>
<p> to indicate that there are a number of things that need to be done</p>
<p> in order to make Australia a more attractive country in which to invest</p>
<p> and therefore probably to give an indication that all things being</p>
<p> equal we'll try and do some of those things.</p>
<p>Now you're first question was, well perhaps it was just an infelicity</p>
<p> of language I really meant that I wanted to talk about Indonesia and</p>
<p> East Timor. I wanted to get American views on it; I want to express</p>
<p> our views I wasn't meaning that there was some particular aspect of</p>
<p> American policy that I wanted to focus on.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How concerned are you that the political atmosphere here, particularly</p>
<p> the rising tide of protectionism and the way that that might play</p>
<p> out in the coming election campaign, could prevent the US playing</p>
<p> the leadership role they should on trade?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think all of our societies have a constant debate. We had quite</p>
<p> a debate about protectionism broadly defined in the last federal election</p>
<p> in Australia. I thought One Nation was very much about the rising</p>
<p> tide of protectionism. I expressed a view frequently that One Nation</p>
<p> was more a function of economic alienation and dislocation particularly</p>
<p> in regional Australia then it was of racism and that's true of all</p>
<p> our societies. I don't think America in that sense is any different.</p>
<p> But of course being the strongest power in the world and being the</p>
<p> power who's views on how far you go down a particular path, carry</p>
<p> more wait than anybody else's; it does matter a lot. I mean the reality</p>
<p> is that if you can sign up America and Japan within the forum of APEC</p>
<p> to a particular outcome, a particular point of view, you get that</p>
<p> outcome. If you can't sign both of them up it's very hard to get the</p>
<p> outcome I mean that is the reality of it and we all know that. That</p>
<p> is why their view carries America's view in particular, carries more</p>
<p> weight. And they just, in the end they've got more votes than anybody</p>
<p> else and therefore they're going to have a very significant influence</p>
<p> on the outcome.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, can I just ask..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>This is the last one otherwise Mr O'Leary will be angry with me.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>When you say that there's a number of things that you'll be suggesting</p>
<p> need to be done to position Sydney as the financial global.global</p>
<p> financial centre. What sort of things will you be discussing?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think there are a number of enormous advantages we already</p>
<p> have.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Apart from those though.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, clearly some of the changes already announced in taxation will</p>
<p> help the abolition of stamp duty on share transactions on stock exchange</p>
<p> will help enormously. The abolition of Financial Institutions Duty</p>
<p> will help. If there are further changes to the business tax system</p>
<p> that make it more of a neutral choice between an investment in Australia</p>
<p> and the United States, that will be something that enhances the attractiveness</p>
<p> of Sydney.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>That's the bit I am interested in.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, come along on Wednesday.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you have got a situation here where the United States</p>
<p> is now moving to the next range of tax reform and we are, in a sense,</p>
<p> catching up with, in some way or other, with the Reagan tax changes,</p>
<p> they're moving on to the next phase. To be competitive in achieving</p>
<p> that neutrality as far as that's concerned, we are going to have to</p>
<p> take a big jump aren't we and rates are very important there.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes, they are, they are important. But anyway, we'll just see what</p>
<p> comes out of it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I mean, Americans are going to be less concerned in terms of investment</p>
<p> and things like accelerated depreciation aren't they?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's.there are.you are not talking about.we are not deluding</p>
<p> ourselves that we can rival New York. We are not quite in that league,</p>
<p> we are not arguing that. But what we are arguing is that certainly</p>
<p> in our own region and more generally in the world because of the advantages</p>
<p> that we already have, and they include not only a strong economy but</p>
<p> they include a very highly respected corporate governance system,</p>
<p> a very well-regulated banking system, one of the best regulated in</p>
<p> the world, an enviable lifestyle, a growing cost advantage compared</p>
<p> with many of the cities of Asia and so if you add to that some enhancements</p>
<p> in the taxation area, it is becoming, and the fortuitous time zone</p>
<p> placement of the eastern seaboard of Australia, you have got quite</p>
<p> a series of very, vtralia, you have got quite</p>
<p> a series of very, very attractive characteristics. Now, I can't for</p>
<p> reasons I explained earlier get into the minutiae of tax changes in</p>
<p> the business area. I don't yet know what they are going to be because</p>
<p> I haven't got Ralph and until I have got Ralph I am not going to say,</p>
<p> well, I am going to do this and I am going to do that. But it is obvious</p>
<p> that there are some things that if addressed would make Australia</p>
<p> and Sydney in particular more attractive.</p>
