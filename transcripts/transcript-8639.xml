ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
" IT'S TIME WH1TLAM GOVERNMENT DINNER"<br />
RAND WICK RACECOURSE, 29 AUGUST 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Gough, Margaret, distinguished members of the Whitlam Government, supporters,<br />
friends, one and all. Well this is a very lovely night for all of us who were members of<br />
that Goverrnent, and a very important thing for our Party to be doing. It's a nice thing to<br />
celebrate your successes and be proud of your achievements and it's an important part of<br />
your history that you're doing it.<br />
Fred talked about the true believers, we are the believers of Australian politics. We are the<br />
people who believe, we make the system tick. But in celebrating this Goverfnent twenty<br />
years ago, it was not just the election of another Government because we had our share<br />
throughout the century, but we celebrated with the election of the Whitlam Government,<br />
the coming out of Australia. Coming out of 25 years, a quarter of a century, of the torpor<br />
of the Menzian age. That's what we really celebrated. And the re-sparking of Australian<br />
nationalism, the re-sparking of Australian social experimentation, which was killed with<br />
Gallipoli and Flanders at the end of the First World War. That's what we celebrate<br />
tonight. We celebrate Labor coming of age again in 1972.<br />
Of course none of this would have been possible without the leadership of the then darling<br />
of the Fabian set, Fabius Maximus himself, not to be confused with Tiberius Telecom who<br />
certainly had the odd run-in at the time, but he is the person who put Labor back together.<br />
The two problems we faced in all of this century was in that great period, the 1890s, when<br />
the Labor Party was put together in that terrible depression and drought, when we had the<br />
Federation conventions when we put together the Federation, and that period of great<br />
social experimentation where we led the world. All of that made Australia basically a </p>
<p>Labor country until the First World War. And then the other great hurdle we faced was, of<br />
course, the Cold War and the Cold War and the belief that many people had with the<br />
collapse of robber baron capitalism in the United States in the ' 20s, that centrally planned<br />
economies were the way forward, and our party -was divided on this very important issue<br />
for a long time. And it was Gough who put the Labor Party back together, and this is his<br />
great crowning achievement. He made Labor a relevant force again, when another part of<br />
this century have disappeared, he grabbed us almost from the grave and brought us back<br />
together. In truth he made Labor relevant again.<br />
I am here tonight as the leader of the Labor Party, as the Prime Minister, as Bob was here<br />
in the early 1980s and throughout the 1980s, we are here because of what Gough was able<br />
to do in making Labor relative again. Gough understood that the ALP was like a bicycle,<br />
it only stands up when you pedal; if you stop peddling it falls over, if you run out of ideas,<br />
and you run out of push, and you run out of drive, it just sort of lays to one side. But the<br />
thing is he understood the need to lift the national spirit.<br />
And what's " Its Time" was about, it's when you read through the policy speech and the<br />
caption, the records were in many respects quite tame when one compares it to today,<br />
quite tame. But what it did in the epock of that terrible Menzoid, Menzian age, was lifting<br />
the spirit of Australians. And if you were at the Blacktown Town Hall the hair was<br />
standing up on the back of your neck because you know that you were in the presence of<br />
something big. That's what Gough understood, lifting the national spirit, lifting the<br />
national sentiment and exciting people. He taught us again that undiluted affection for<br />
Australia, and a belief that the day might come when this country would not need the<br />
emotional or institutional supports of old affections and old connections. That was what<br />
he taught us, and that's what we started to understand back there in 1972. And that's why<br />
there was so much hope and so much promise. Thiat's why we are able to carry on as we<br />
were, as a Party, right through that period.<br />
And so when we celebrate this Government, we celebrate the dreams of Fred Daly's<br />
generation who came there at the end of the Second World War who have always such<br />
difficult periods to deal with. Scullin arrived in office in the 1930s virtually days before<br />
the collapse of the Depression, the stock market in 1929, Curtin arrived just a short time<br />
before Pearl Harbour. We are always saddled with the tough things to do in this life. We<br />
were denied the easy days of post war growth when people like Fred and others went to<br />
the House, because in the ' 40s Fred was actually in our war time Government, but many<br />
members came in ' 49 and by 1972 had just about given up. We nearly won in 69. Really<br />
the Government of 1972 was mostly won in 1969 and then a couple of years later in' 72 we<br />
pushed it over the line.<br />
And what was put together was a tremendous program of social change and social policy,<br />
*** which lead-Labor back to the-main stream of Australia, of the main stream views which<br />
Australia had in the past, which it had given us the constitution, which had given us some<br />
of the best social policy in the world, and which had taken us back there. </p>
<p>And the fact of the matter is that, that great tradition which Gough and his Government<br />
re-started has continued down through the period. And that is why I think it is a<br />
delightful thing to be able to claim in your history, a continuum between the Labor<br />
Governments, between the Whitlam Government, the Hawke Government and this<br />
Government. This is a delightful thing to be able to do.<br />
And all of the things which the Whitlam Government did, things like Medibank, we've<br />
continued with Medicare. This is one of the great health systems around the world. With<br />
pensions, indexation for pensions, which we have now brought to 25 per cent of average<br />
weekly earnings where we sophisticated the whole of the aged care system. With Gough's<br />
Schools Commission, which has now led to a continuation of these policies with now 7<br />
kids in 10 completing secondary school, and now a new revolution in vocational<br />
education, 40 per cent of kids going into university. We kept the whole policy going that<br />
begun in 1972. In foreign policy, a peculiarly Australian foreign policy, which we now<br />
make without reference to anybody else, thanks to that great period between 1972 and<br />
1975. And even DURD, DURD is back with Better Cities. I don't know whether Tom's<br />
here tonight, but the fact is at the time this was path breaking stuff and again with the<br />
Better Cities we are back doing the same thing. With railways, Gough tried to take the<br />
railways over and make the national system. There were only two clever States at the<br />
time, Tasmania and South Australia, the rest said no. We are doing it all today, same<br />
policies, same sort of Labor Party, same sort of people.<br />
This Government adopted theWorld Heritage conventions, which has been so much a<br />
basis for our environmental policy and all of our actions in Tasmania, or the wilderness<br />
areas, or the wet tropics of Queensland, come relying upon that legislation. Or in<br />
multiculturalism, which was again part of the vogue of the Whitlam Government bringing<br />
Australians together, producing as we did an understanding between cultures and making<br />
one society out of the many cultures of Australia. We are sticking to that, we are not<br />
going to the miserable politics of Dr Hewson.<br />
And in other great reforms like the family allowance supplement, which is one of the<br />
world's leading family income support systems for low income families, or occupational<br />
superannuation for the whole of the workforce, we have seen a traditional Labor<br />
Government in the Whitlam Government, and a continuation of the tradition through the<br />
current Labor Government from 1983 to 1992. And the fact is, Gough, I think we can say,<br />
even though people say of us we're rationalists, no we're not rationalists, we're rational<br />
we're not rationalists. We're not isms and we're not ists, we don't belong to the isms and<br />
we don't belong to the ists. We are not Thatcherite, we are not Reaganite, and we are not<br />
Rogernomic, we are Labor, we are traditional Labor.<br />
We need to always rejoice in the things we have done, because we have got our troubles<br />
and people now are finding the current recession difficult and people are looking<br />
elsewhere for solutions to other Labor Parties in other places. We get told get about New<br />
Zealand and the New Zealand Labor Party, and a few things worth saying. In 1983 we<br />
had 6 million people in the Australian workforce, today we have got 7.6 million, that is 26<br />
per cent bigger. Between 1983 and 1992 the workforce in New Zealand actually got </p>
<p>smaller. And that is the difference between Rogernomics and traditional Labor<br />
economics. And also, not just in that respect, the country is twice as large as its product<br />
ever was.<br />
The fact is, I think we can say Gough, that in the things which you did, started, that your<br />
Ministers took pride in, and the policies you built, these were the foundation stones for the<br />
Hawke Government in 1983 and the Government which I have the privilege to lead now<br />
at this time. We kept them going. We had those dismal years with Malcolm Fraser, but of<br />
course we now understand that compared to John Hewson, Malcolm -was a comparatively<br />
good guy.<br />
It is an interesting thing isn't it? In the 1980s which finished off communism and finished<br />
off monetarism, the parties which have the comprehension and support worldwide now<br />
are the So-cial Democratic Parties. The half hearted, Gordon Gecko Wall Street view of<br />
the world that basically greed is good and survival of the fittest. And its the productive<br />
economy, the efficient economy with the nice social policy grafted on, with a proper<br />
safety net, access to health, access to housing, access to education, all of these things are<br />
basically where societies are going to go and where we have taken Australia.<br />
Now when you look at today's Liberal Party it does believe in isms and ists as we do not<br />
where they've been raised literally on capitalist ideology. We used to say about Malcolm,<br />
Mick and I when we were in the Parliament's Assembly, we would go out there on the<br />
attack every night, we used to accuse Malcolm of just about being a capitalist raider and<br />
all the rest. The truth is he was just a warm old regular. He was. Malcolm was really just<br />
a trifle. Now we have got a leader of the Opposition who makes Malcolm look like a<br />
Bolshie, who believes in all of that wall street eth. His view is that he wants the social<br />
impoverishment of Australia so that everyone who rises out of it will be like him, that is<br />
self made, rising from the ashes of the impoverishment which has produced a better class<br />
of person, a better entrepreneurial type. His spirit is of course the spirit of the 1980s, of<br />
the worst excesses of the 1980s. He is very much a product of the place he is from, it is<br />
Thatcherismn ten years on.<br />
So if your spirit ever flags, if ever you have got any self doubt, if any self doubt creeps<br />
into your hearts and minds, or if you ever wondered whether it is all worth it, just read one<br />
of John Hewson's latest speeches and you will understand, it is. You will understand that<br />
we have got now a conservative, a radical conservative who is going to try and wipe away<br />
a century of social change, a century of industrial progress, a century of social policy and<br />
try to take Australia back to some level of social impoverishment where only basically the<br />
fittest survive. This is what he is about. Never in the last 25 years, in my time in politics,<br />
has there been a greater opportunity for Labor to show what it is made of, and to make a<br />
difference to them that we believe, in essence, economies that can produce the goods, one<br />
that can reduce employment, one it can produce wealth. But also we believe in having<br />
the right to a hospital bed if you are sick, the right to a school and a university if you are a<br />
poor kid, the right to support if you're aged. All these things we believe in, because we<br />
are a tradition. </p>
<p>That's why we come along here tonight. We've got our political difficulties, we know<br />
that. But we are the people who make the Australian history. We are the ones who<br />
nominate the heroes, we anoint the heroes of Australia, we set the ethos of Australia our<br />
Party, our Labor Party. And we are here, we have got our troubles but we are not sad, we<br />
are happy with ourselves, we sleep well at night, we know we always try to do what is<br />
good and what is best. We are into good work and good things for altruistic reasons. And<br />
we are as we are now because other good people did other good things, in our case<br />
years ago. And those Ministers who are here tonight, that I had the privilege of serving<br />
with for just three weeks Mick said he would have given a fortune just to be in there for<br />
three days but to all of those who blazed the trail and took the blow torch on the belly<br />
from the Conservatives, we owe them a debt of gratitude. It is a nice thing for us to<br />
remember them, remember them well, appreciate them, take them to our heart and say<br />
thank you.<br />
And that is what we are doing Gough, we are saying thank you to your Ministers, and we<br />
arc saying thank you to you. We are saying thank you to you because you did take us out<br />
of the Conservative torpor. You did relight the fire of Australian nationalism You taught<br />
neo-Australian's to be something different, to be something to be proud of, an identity of<br />
our own and for that of course we owe you eternal gratitude. And this Government will<br />
do all it can to keep faith with those great ideals. So it is with the utmost of pleasure that I<br />
introduce you, although you need no introduction to this audience, as the person who put<br />
Labor back together, who made Labor relative again, and gave us a chance to show our<br />
social and economic paces of the ' 80s and ' 90s and to make Australia in our image, the<br />
image of a caring party, of a caring society, but one which is productive enough to hold its<br />
head up to the world in clothing, feeding and housing people. We owe you a great debt<br />
and I am sure all of us here tonight appreciate what you have done, you and Margaret,<br />
who fought beside you for all those years and put up with you all those years. We owe<br />
you a great debt of gratitude and it is a nice thing that we have come together to remember<br />
you, to appreciate you and to applaud you.<br />
ENDS </p>
