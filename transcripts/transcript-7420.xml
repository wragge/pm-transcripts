CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE SIR ROBERT GARRAN ORATION<br />
ROYAL AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS<br />
MELBOURNE 27 OCTOBER 1988<br />
Hedley Bachmann,<br />
David Shand,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.,<br />
Sir Robert Garran was the first public servant of the<br />
Commonwealth of Australia and, in the period immediately<br />
after Federation, he was briefly our only public servant.<br />
in the succeeding decades Garran played a leading role in<br />
establishing the foundations of the public service as we<br />
know it today. At his retirement in 1932 he had been a<br />
permanent head for thirty-one years a record period of<br />
service that, as the Australian Dictionary of Biography<br />
notes, is unlikely ever to be broken.<br />
Billy Hughes is supposed to have once said that the best way<br />
to govern Australia was to have Sir Robert Garran at his<br />
elbow, with a fountain pen and a blank sheet of paper, and<br />
the War Precautions Act.<br />
Well, I don't think I'd like to extend that degree of<br />
latitude to Mike Codd. Besides, I don't have recourse to<br />
the War Precautions Act.<br />
But the judgement by Hughes does go the heart of Garran's<br />
unique skills. Anyone reviewing this extraordinary career<br />
and assessing his immense contribution to the Commonwealth<br />
of Australia cannot but be impressed by two outstanding<br />
elements. First, Garran was the paragon of professionalism. He served<br />
eleven different Attorneys-General and sixteen Governments,<br />
covering the spectrum of political affiliations in that<br />
initial period of quite rapid political change. He served<br />
them all with absolute loyalty, and received their<br />
confidence and trust, setting a fine example of one of the<br />
most fundamental values of our Westminster-derived system of<br />
gove rnment.<br />
: 3032 </p>
<p>Second, as Garran responded to all the diverse challenges of<br />
administration he faced initially as an advocate and agent<br />
of Federation, then as the trailblazing public servant and<br />
parliamentary draftsman, then in the international field<br />
during and after the First World war he proved an<br />
unquenchably creat'ive force. In a time of change, his<br />
creativity in building new institutions, developing<br />
practical solutions and creating workable machinery still<br />
stands as an admirable model for his successors today.<br />
On the basis of my own experience of five and half years as<br />
Prime Minister, I can say that the Government I have the<br />
honour of leading has been well served by a public service<br />
which has sought, largely successfully, to emulate Garran's<br />
professionalism and his creativity.<br />
Indeed, I argue that today's public administrators those<br />
elected to Parliament as well as those appointed to the<br />
bureaucracy face even greater challenges than those<br />
presented to Garran by Federation, Depression and World War.<br />
AS tough as it would have been to establish a Commonwealth<br />
Government where none had been before, it is perhaps even<br />
tougher to manage and to reform machinery of government<br />
which is inherited. In the era of nuclear missiles, optical<br />
fibres, instant news and 24-hour money markets, it is<br />
anomalous that we face these challenges with a Constitution<br />
inherited from the days of the penny farthing bicycle.<br />
In the economic sphere, we face the challenge to restructure<br />
the Australian economy so as to guarantee the future<br />
prosperity of our people. And we must do this in an era<br />
when we can no longer assume, as those of Garran's and<br />
succeeding generations of Australians-assumed, that greater<br />
prosperity results simply from shearing more sheep,<br />
harvesting more wheat and finding fabulous new veins of<br />
minerals and metals.<br />
This restructuring process has been the principal activity<br />
of our Government over the past five and a half years.. It<br />
has demanded a fundamental rethinking of the economic<br />
assumptions that we inherited from the past. At the same<br />
time it requires vigilant attention to ensuring our<br />
political arrangements remain relevant to the task we face<br />
without of course modifying the democratic and parliamentary<br />
character of our political system.<br />
To a large extent, meeting this challenge of restructuring<br />
has relied on improving the performance of the private<br />
sector, through for example practising the hard discipline<br />
of becoming more productive and competitive, making our<br />
manufacturing industry more efficient, boosting our research<br />
effort, and building new industries in the service and high<br />
tech areas. 13083 </p>
<p>These have been areas of special priority for this<br />
Government and, thanks to the tremendous contribution we<br />
have received from the entire community, we are starting to<br />
see the fruits of our efforts: a more diverse and efficient<br />
economy capable of competing and winning on world markets.<br />
But it would have been senseless to have believed that<br />
restructuring was a task solely for the private sector and<br />
that the public sector was immune from a similar need to<br />
improve its performance.<br />
The public sector is a substantial employer and producer in<br />
its own right, and its functions in regard to the private<br />
sector, such as taxation, regulation, economic analysis and<br />
policy advice, have assumed critical importance in<br />
determining the overall efficiency of our economy.<br />
Further, the tendency over many years, and with increasing<br />
frequency since the Second World War, to see the answer to<br />
emerging community needs lying almost automatically in an<br />
expanded role for Government has in fact created a number of<br />
problem areas, both potential and real. These include:<br />
the inefficiencies of excessive regulation;<br />
the expensive spiral of Government assistance, be it by<br />
direct payment to welfare recipients or indirectly to<br />
inefficient industries;<br />
the distortion of the taxation system by the creation of<br />
rorts for the privileged few;<br />
the inefficiencies of overlapping local, state and<br />
federal jurisdictions;.<br />
the pervasive role of statutory authorities; and<br />
the drain and danger caused by excessive federal budget<br />
deficits.<br />
In declaring my pride in my Government's record of<br />
achievement in minimising these danger areas, I hasten to<br />
point out that we have by no means accepted the simplistic<br />
analysis that small government is necessarily better<br />
government or that deregulation is a desirable end in<br />
itself. That is a misconception to which our conservative<br />
opponents fall victim with amazing regularity in the same<br />
way as, for that matter, some on the Left find themselves<br />
making the too-easy assumption of the desirability of<br />
government intervention. Deregulation or interveption are<br />
not ends in themselves; they may simply be means to the real<br />
goal which must be the creation-of a fairer and a more<br />
efficient Australia.<br />
30u34 </p>
<p>As a Labor Prime Minister I am proud of the way in which we<br />
have met our responsibilities as a Government, protecting<br />
the needy, helping the battlers, and making Australia a<br />
fairer society. And as a Prime Minister committed to<br />
reform, I am proud of Labor's proven capacity to improve the<br />
efficiency and cbmpetitiveness of our economy which is<br />
helping to guarantee the prosperity of all Australians.<br />
My point is that in today's circumstances, unless there is<br />
constant vigilance by an elected government alert to the<br />
demands of the international economy, and unless<br />
organisational and attitudinal change becomes a constant<br />
part of the Government's management of the bureaucracy, the<br />
public service may succumb to the-almost overwhelming<br />
temptation to look inwards; to become absorbed in its own<br />
process rather than its output; to grow inexorably; in<br />
short, to serve its own ends.<br />
If that were to happen, our overall economic performance<br />
would suffer and the community would be the poorer.<br />
The business of government must be the provision of the<br />
greatest public good at the least private cost and the<br />
public service must achieve those ends without losing its<br />
professional capacity to serve governments of differing<br />
political views and with different policy priorities.<br />
Indeed, that capacity should be always enhanced.<br />
In today's environment, when the economy as a whole must<br />
overcome its entrenched inflexibilities and inefficiencies,<br />
that prescription poses a massive management challenge.<br />
The aim of Government must be not only to ensure that the<br />
public service does its own job professionally and<br />
efficiently. The aim must also be to ensure that the public<br />
service is not a stumbling block for broader, economy-wide<br />
change; indeed, that the public service becomes where<br />
possible an effective instrument for the achievement of that<br />
change. Having established this broad context, I want tonight to<br />
describe the efforts the Government has made to achieve<br />
those goals, and to spell out our consistent set of<br />
principles which has underpinned those efforts. You will be<br />
broadly familiar with the extent of our reforms the new<br />
legislation in 1984, the budget reforms, the streamlining of<br />
personnel administration in 1986 and our continuing reforms<br />
of statutory authorities. I have briefly outlined these<br />
changes in an appendix to this Oration. I will address in<br />
more detail tonight the important structural changes I<br />
announced in July last year and the associated changes in<br />
Cabinet arrangements I announced the following month.<br />
Most commentators on the machinery changes have, perhaps not<br />
surprisingly, tended to concentrate on whether or not the<br />
two-level ministerial structure is working effectively.<br />
From my perspective it is working well a point I will<br />
return to shortly. 035 </p>
<p>Th<br />
It follows, however, that the commentators have put too fa<br />
little weight on the very substantial changes that have been dr<br />
wrought in the public service itself, and the improvements th<br />
they have made to the quality of policy development work, to be<br />
the capacity for co-operation and co-ordination within the no<br />
public service, and to the degree of accountability and pe<br />
flexibility for managers.<br />
The likely benefit of these changes in improving the quality<br />
of management and decision making was more important to the aF<br />
Government than the achievement of savings through the su<br />
elimination of overlap and duplication. ob<br />
Commentators have similarly overlooked the importance of the<br />
changes in the Cabinet Committee system we introduced, and Th<br />
in particular our decision to establish three policy pr<br />
development Committees: re<br />
the Structural Adjustment Committee which co-ordinates<br />
reform of the micro-economy to achieve medium term<br />
growth in our economy; Th<br />
the Social and Family Policy Committee which focuses on<br />
the development and implementation of our social justice Th<br />
strategy to ensure the fair distribution of the proceeds an<br />
of economic growth throughout the community; and Tb Cu<br />
the Public Service Reform Committee which is concerned mc<br />
with further improvements in management in the public es<br />
sector. ha<br />
Cabinet, of course, remains the supreme organ of the<br />
decision making processes of the Government, and any major T<br />
matters which might have their genesis in the committees ha<br />
will in the end be determined by the Cabinet itself. me o f<br />
But these new committees, like the Expenditure Review<br />
Committee in relation to the Budget, have become the engine<br />
rooms of our decision making processes. ur bi<br />
They are the forums in which ministers most directly P1<br />
concerned with'the policy area can collectively and in PC<br />
detail consider the subject matter and develop policy<br />
proposals or positions for consideration by the full<br />
Cabinet. Through these committees, we are generating a much greater St<br />
ability for ministers collectively to engage in policy el<br />
development, which had been essentially the preserve of one<br />
minister and most often one department. S $ 3<br />
Moreover, the new policy development committees are<br />
supported in their work by groups or task forces of c<br />
officials who are interacting more closely with the r<br />
collective policy development, role of the ministers. T0<br />
3036 </p>
<p>The new two-tier structure of Government has undoubtedly<br />
facilitated this approach. Fewer departments need to be<br />
drawn into any particular policy development exercise and<br />
the barriers which used to exist between departments have<br />
been substantially reduced perhaps because each department<br />
now brings a broader area of responsibility and broader<br />
perspectives to bear on any given matter.<br />
A very good illustration of the benefits of this new<br />
approach was contained in this year's. May Statement, in<br />
which we unveiled a major program of structural reform,<br />
substantial developments to advance our social justice<br />
objectives, and significant returns from the Efficiency<br />
Scrutiny program.<br />
These measures had been largely developed through the<br />
processes of the three policy development committees I<br />
referred to earlier, and by a great deal of hard work on the<br />
part of both the ministers on those committees and the<br />
officials supporting them.<br />
The new machinery has also, as I expected, further improved<br />
our Budget processes.<br />
This Government's period of office has been characterised by<br />
an unprecedented period of sustained expenditure restraint.<br />
The last three budgets have actually seen Commonwealth<br />
outlays fall in real terms, and outlays as a share of GDP is<br />
now the lowest since 1973-74. This fiscal achievement -so<br />
essential to the Government's overall economic strategyhas<br />
required five years of hard slog by Expenditure Review<br />
Committee ministers.<br />
The sustainability of this process of expenditure restraint<br />
has required us to concentrate on improving financial<br />
management especially through the progressive introduction<br />
of program budgeting and on streamlining budget processes.<br />
our innovations have proven successful. Rather than wait<br />
until just before the August Budget to sift through all the<br />
bids ministers may make for new spending, ERC is now<br />
provided early in the year with a list of ministers' new<br />
policy proposals. Sifting through those bids, ERC<br />
Identifies a range of high priority or unavoidable proposals<br />
which are then scrutinised more'closely prior to delivery of.<br />
the Budget in August.<br />
Streamlining the Budget process has also involved<br />
eliminating the need for ERC ministers to decide on the<br />
trivial detail of budget-making, in particular the minor<br />
savings options and minor new policy proposals costing<br />
$ 1-2 million or less. This desire on the-part of ERC to<br />
extricate itself from the detail of budget-making<br />
complements the trend towards letting ministers take greater<br />
responsibility for their portfolios.<br />
These twin goals have been pursued in the most recent Budget<br />
period through the use of portfolio targets. 3037 </p>
<p>Thus, in the run-up to the August Budget, ERC can now<br />
concentrate on significant new policy proposals and wrap up<br />
remaining Budget matters within portfolio expenditure<br />
targets. Subject to their reporting to ERC on achievement<br />
of those targets, portfolio ministers are now free to pursue<br />
minor policy proposals and minor savings options without the<br />
previous detailed involvement of ERC ministers.<br />
Another important change I made last year was to replace the<br />
former Public Service Board with a much smaller Public<br />
Service Commission reflecting and enhancing our clear<br />
preference for devolving responsibilities for personnel<br />
management to portfolios instead of concentrating on<br />
outdated central agency roles.<br />
A part-time Management Advisory Board was established to<br />
advise the Government on significant management issues and<br />
to be a forum for considering major management activities<br />
affecting the service as a whole.<br />
As well as these changes, the Department of Finance has<br />
progressively become less involved in detail and changed its<br />
financial management controls to promote greater<br />
responsibility for operating departments and greater<br />
incentives for managers. The Department of the Prime<br />
Minister and Cabinet is also now substantially less<br />
interventionist, with greater concentration on its<br />
fundamental role as a co-ordinating agency this reflects a<br />
change both in concept and ' in the character of the chief<br />
political office holder!<br />
The savings I foreshadowed could arise from these major<br />
machinery changes will be achieved. But I repeat that they<br />
were not the primary purpose of the changes. Indeed we<br />
recognised at the time that there would be substantial costs<br />
associated with the changes and substantial dislocation and<br />
disturbance both for agencies and many individuals.<br />
It was my expectation that adjustments would be necessary<br />
over some two years to accommodate changes of this scale.<br />
No certain assessment of the success of the changes would be<br />
possible before them.<br />
I can say, however, that although they are difficult to<br />
quantify, significant benefits are already evident to me in<br />
the areas of policy development and decision making<br />
processes, and in the : area of delegation to, and incentives<br />
for, managers.<br />
I return now to the issue of the two level ministry and to<br />
the associated issues: of accountability.<br />
W038 </p>
<p>I do not need to remind an audience such as this of the<br />
relentless pressures on ministerial time in modern<br />
Government. Among these pressures are:<br />
responsibilities in relation to the minister's<br />
electorate and constituents;<br />
unavoidable party political duties inside the Parliament<br />
and in the broader party organisation;<br />
legislative and Parliamentary obligations;<br />
overriding responsibility as a member of the Executive<br />
Government, and associated responsibilities to Cabinet<br />
and Cabinet Committees;.<br />
and finally, responsibility, derived from the<br />
Constitution, to administer his or her department.<br />
The immensity of these competing pressures under the<br />
Government of Malcolm Fraser prompted an investigation by<br />
political scientist Patrick Weller and journalist Michelle<br />
Grattan into the chilling question " Can ministers Cope?"<br />
I do not pretend that ministers of my Government face no<br />
problems in reconciling competing demands on their time.<br />
But I do point out that the two tier ministerial structure<br />
was designed to make, and I am convinced is making, it<br />
easier for my ministers to do so.<br />
in introducing these new arrangements we addressed head-on<br />
the legal question which had bedevilled so much previous<br />
consideration of the rational allocation of functions to<br />
departments. The question whether section 64 of the Constitution<br />
permitted more than one minister to administer a department<br />
had long been the subject of learned consideration by the<br />
lawyers. Most, including Sir Robert Garran, have been of<br />
the opinion that it was possible the most notable<br />
exception being a narrow interpretation in 1958 by Mr<br />
Barwick, as he then was, as counsel. I am pleased to note<br />
that there has been subsequent judicial endorsement of the<br />
broad interpretation of section 64.<br />
The positive view however has always been tempered by<br />
caution because of the potential consequence of<br />
disqualification of a member or senator if the negative view<br />
were held to be correct. This was an important factor<br />
leading to frequent, costly and inefficient machinery of<br />
government changes. 39 </p>
<p>9.<br />
The revised arrangements we have put in place provide the<br />
flexibility necessary to accommodate changing political<br />
priorities and circumstances, including new ministerial<br />
appointments, without the need. to change the machinery of<br />
government with all the upheaval that entails. Indeed, one<br />
of the virtues of the new machinery is that there is great<br />
flexibility within portfolios in allocating responsibility<br />
to ministers and re-drawing lines of operation for officials<br />
flexibilities which also assist departments and ministers<br />
to cope with changing pressure points.<br />
Under the new system, non-Cabinet Ministers are undertaking<br />
many functions on behalf of their portfolio ministers such<br />
as Parliamentary duties, correspondence, day to day<br />
administration of specific areas within the portfolio<br />
enabling senior ministers to devote precious time to broad<br />
strategic issues of Government. Not insignificantly,<br />
non-Cabinet ministers are also enabled to focus much more<br />
closely on the nitty gritty issues that are often vital to<br />
the welfare of the individual clients of Government.<br />
As I envisaged at the time, it has been necessary<br />
occasionally to refine the arrangements. This will, no<br />
doubt, continue to be necessary.<br />
Overall, however, I believe the two level ministry<br />
arrangements have worked remarkably well. As you would be<br />
aware, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, has publicly<br />
welcomed many aspects of these new arrangements, including<br />
the two level ministerial structure, and I welcome his<br />
support. For my part, I regard the new machinery as setting the basic<br />
pattern of Australian Government administration for many<br />
years ahead. Major changes of this kind are disruptive and,<br />
while minor adjustments must be made where necessary, no<br />
major changes at the departmental level should now be<br />
necessary as far ahead as I can see.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
In the lead ' up to my visit last year to the Soviet Union, I<br />
had drawn to my attention a comment of Lenin's. It was a<br />
comment of great relevance to the reforms sought by<br />
Mr Gorbachev, , and has been quoted approvingly by an<br />
influential Soviet economist, close to Gorbachev, seeking to<br />
condemn the rigidities and inefficiencies of the Soviet<br />
system bequeathed by Brezhnev. Lenin's comment has<br />
unexpected relevance today, less. because of his definition<br />
of the problem than his articulation of the solution. If<br />
you will forgive Lenin'. s unfortunately scatalogical<br />
language, I will read it to you.<br />
040 </p>
<p>" in our country everything is swamped in a foul<br />
bureaucratic morass of ' departments'. Great authority,<br />
intelligence, and strength are needed for the day-to-day<br />
struggle against this. Departments are shit; decrees<br />
are shit. Seeking out people and entrusting the work to<br />
them that is all that matters."<br />
And in many ways, seeking out people and entrusting the work<br />
to them is alf that matters to reformers of the public<br />
service, and indeed of the private sector, in Australia<br />
today. In our pursuit of greater efficiency and effectiveness in<br />
the public service, we have followed a consistent set of<br />
principles. With rather less brevity than Lenin, let me<br />
outline the principles underpinning our reforms. They have<br />
been aimed at:<br />
clarifying the lines of accountability at all levels of<br />
government, including through greater delegation of<br />
responsibility to line managers;<br />
retaining and where possible enhancing the professional<br />
character of the public service and its ability to serve<br />
the elected government of the day;<br />
pursuing greater equity in public administration<br />
including in the delivery of services; and<br />
providing maximum scope for our greatest resource, our<br />
people in the workforce, through greater individual<br />
initiative, innovation and job satisfaction.<br />
Let me now discuss how these principles have been advanced.<br />
As to the first, accountability is a pervasive principle,<br />
that at one end of the spectrum ensures voters can endorse<br />
or reject a government in the ballot box, and that at the<br />
other gives force to the claim of a pensioner seeking<br />
assistance over the counter of a Social Security office.<br />
It has been in pursuit of this principle that we have:<br />
redefined, in legislation, the relative responsibilities<br />
of ministers and departmental secretaries for the<br />
administration of departments;<br />
enhanced ministerial responsibility through the new<br />
two-level ministry system;<br />
introduced a range of measures designed to reduce<br />
central agency controls and put responsibility more<br />
clearly in portfolios and complementary measures to<br />
reduce central controls within portfolios; and<br />
improved budget processes and financial controls. .3041 </p>
<p>Within these differing levels of accountability, one layer<br />
seems particularly problematical: the accountability of the<br />
executive to the Parliament. IS<br />
The Parliament, through Question Time, Parliamentary<br />
Committees, and detailed scrutiny of legislation, provides I<br />
the means by which Government is called to account during G.<br />
its term of office. It has been my Government's desire,<br />
particularly through its budgetary reforms and the manner in<br />
which financial information is made available to the P<br />
Parliament, to do all it can to make the processes ofh<br />
Government as transparent and amenable to Parliamentary TI<br />
scrutinf as possible. ii<br />
Given-this subtle and multifaceted process of 0<br />
accountability, it is depressing that, at least in some t<br />
quarters, the whole concept of accountability gets reduced i<br />
to a barren quest for ministerial resignations. Opposition t<br />
parties today and, I suppose, of earlier periods seem to ft<br />
believe they are engaged in a game of cricket. They are too p<br />
eager to cry LBW, and tend to do so for all the wrong d.<br />
reasons.<br />
The true measure of ministerial accountability, here and in TV<br />
Britain, has never been the tally of ministerial b<br />
resignations. Even in the slower and simpler formativeeI<br />
period of our system of Government, the strict theory that i<br />
ministers were fully accountable for every act or omission bE.<br />
of their departmental officers was, simply, far-fetched. In<br />
today's environment the traditional hypothesis just cannot TI<br />
be reconciled with political and administrative realities. i<br />
The relationship between ministers and officials is far more fr<br />
complex than the hypothesis, with its all-too-neat dichotomy pr<br />
between policy and administration, permits. h;<br />
Clearly there are many areas where the detailed development a<br />
of policy proposals is, within a broad framework ofI<br />
ministerial direction, entrusted to officials; similarly, b<br />
there are many matters of administration in which ministers s<br />
take a close interest. M<br />
in other words, ministers must, of course, continue to be i<br />
answerable to the Parliament and to take any necessary p<br />
corrective action. But the truth is that there is no<br />
requirement for them to resign except where a significantDe<br />
act or omission was theirs, or was taken at their personal Gc<br />
direction, or was a matter about which they obviously should P<br />
have known, and done something. s<br />
ministerial responsibility of c ourse is but one strand in Th<br />
the web of accountability that pervades our whole political fc<br />
and administrative structure. It is-a principle to wbiich,<br />
as all our public service reforms show, we attach very great On<br />
importance. It is not, let me stress, in any way th<br />
contradictory to the second principle we have pursued: re<br />
maintaining and enhancing a highly professional public m<br />
service. m<br />
3042 </p>
<p>12.<br />
Some critics of the changes made to appointment and tenure<br />
provisions for departmental secretaries argued they would<br />
lead to polit~ cisation. Four years later, no-one could<br />
reasonably claim that the portfolio secretaries serving my<br />
Government are other than highly professional career public<br />
servants who have also served previous governments in senior<br />
positions. The public service remains, at all levels, a<br />
highly professional institution.<br />
The third principle I referred to, which draws out the<br />
importance of equity in public sector management and<br />
employment, has also been advanced. In terms of government<br />
outputs, this is reflected in the advances we have made<br />
towards our social justice objectives. In terms of staffing<br />
it is best reflected in the legislative advances in 1984 and<br />
the new machinery to follow those changes through and to<br />
foster a management culture in the public service which pays<br />
proper regard to the merit principle, to industrial<br />
democracy and to equal employment opportunity.<br />
These developments tend to be seen as soft optional extras.<br />
This is short-sighted; there are substantial management<br />
benefits in all of these measures. I regard the continuing<br />
efforts the Government is making to foster EEO as especially<br />
important in seeking to harness for the public sector the<br />
best available human resources in our multicultural society.<br />
The final principle, enhancing scope for initiative,<br />
innovation and job satisfaction, does not lend itself so<br />
readily to assessment. Much of our effort has gone into<br />
providing a framework within which managers at all levels<br />
have clearer lines of responsibility and a greater degree of<br />
autonomy. I recognise we have more to do on these qualitative issues<br />
but we have been necessarily living through a period of<br />
stringency and adjustment; and it takes time for a new<br />
management culture and environment to be established. I<br />
should say, however, that there have been many examples of<br />
innovative policy development and innovative changes in<br />
program management.<br />
Despite the apparent size and sometimes impersonal face of<br />
Government there is, I believe, tremendous scope in the<br />
public service for individual initiative and sense of<br />
satisfaction arising from contribution to the public good.<br />
The changes we have made should, over time, lead to greater<br />
scope for such innovation and, I believe, greater potential<br />
for job satisfaction.<br />
one of the management challenges we face is to ensure that<br />
this is the case. Another is how to achieve greater<br />

<p>Public Servants have come a long way since Kafka gave<br />
bureaucracy a bad name or since Tom Collins gave a F<br />
particularly Australian twist to the characterisation. Tom PC<br />
Collins, of course, was the pseudonym adopted by Joseph U<br />
Furphy in his classic of the Australian bush " Such is Life". S<br />
At the outset of Chapter I the recently unemployed Collins rdo<br />
writes of his days in the public service: ti ti,<br />
" One generally feels a sort-of diffidence in introducing r<br />
one's self; but I may remark that I was at that time a Ut<br />
Government official, of the ninth class; paid rather i<br />
, according to my grade than my merit, and not by any b<br />
means in proportion to the loafing I had to do." a<br />
That was a laconic way of putting Lord Samuel's dictum:<br />
that a public service will find a difficulty for every<br />
solution. S<br />
It's unfortunate that such stereotypes persist in the public b<br />
mind. I repeat what I said at the outset that I consider<br />
my Government to be very well served by the Federal public<br />
service. And I take considerable pride in the fact that the<br />
reforms my Government has made to the public service have It<br />
served further to increase its efficiency and c<br />
professionalism. f it<br />
As you are well aware, over recent years I have been<br />
stressing over and over again to the business community, to<br />
the union movement, to our primary producers, and to workers<br />
throughout Australia, the overwhelming need for adaptability<br />
and readiness to accept change if we are to prosper as a<br />
nation. Similar adaptability and readiness to embrace change is<br />
absolutely imperative in our public institutions if they are<br />
to provide the framework within which our visions of an<br />
economically prosperous and socially just Australia are to<br />
be realised.<br />
AS we approach the end of this century and the centenary of<br />
the establishment of the Commonwealth, in which Garran<br />
played such a large par t, I am confident that our measures<br />
to create a management environment and culture which<br />
emphasises the ability to promote and adapt to change, will<br />
be seen as among our most significant achievements.<br />
For those who question the directions we are taking, let me<br />
refer you to some remarks of Garran about the Constitutional<br />
debates of the 1890s:<br />
" Looking back over these debates, one is struck by the<br />
vanity of human fears and precautions ( T) hose fifty<br />
of the elect of Australia spent months discussing<br />
dangers and difficulties, most of which the experience<br />
of half a century has shown to be imaginary. on the<br />
other hand, many of the troubles that, as it turned out,<br />
have beset the Constitution since its establishment are<br />
matters that never occurred to them."<br />
3044 </p>
<p>14.<br />
For reasons that are obvious enough, I say nothing at this<br />
point about Constitutional reform and the difficulties<br />
thereof.<br />
But I do make ~ the point that change is a constant. The last<br />
decade in particular has seen so many of the certitudes of<br />
the past brought into question, modified or despatched to<br />
the dustbins of history. These winds of change have been no<br />
respecter of ideological boundaries. In differing degrees<br />
they have blasted China, the Soviet Union and the West and<br />
in differing degrees the public service has been affected<br />
by, in some cases indeed is central to, how these changes<br />
are worked out in the society in question.<br />
In the Soviet Union, for example, the success or otherwise<br />
of the historically momentous changes enunciated by<br />
Secretary-General Gorbachev will be determined by his<br />
capacity both to overcome the opposition of so much of the<br />
bureaucracy to those changes, and then to harness a leaner<br />
public service as a positive element in the processes of<br />
change. In Australia, where the challenge of change is a compelling<br />
constant for all of us, I believe we are singularly<br />
fortunate in having an Australian Public Service which has,<br />
in my judgement, both the character and capacity to enable<br />
it fully to meet that responsibility. 304 </p>

AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE POLICY POSITIONS DEVELOPED<br />
IN OPPOSITION AS REFLECTED IN THE DOCUMENT " LABOR AND A<br />
THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT", MY GOVERNMENT MOVED QUICKLY o<br />
IN 1983 TO SET UP THE TASK FORCE CHAIRED BY MR DAWKINS, D)<br />
THEN MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND MINISTER ASSISTING ME FOR I<br />
PUBLIC SERVICE MATTERS. A WIDE-RANGING DISCUSSION Al<br />
PAPER WAS PUBLISHED IN DECEMBER 1983. THE RESULTANT I'<br />
LEGISLATION, THE PUBLIC SERVICE REFORM ACT 1984, WAS M<br />
PASSED IN JUNE 1984. T)<br />
THE ACT MADE IT QUITE CLEAR THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF S.<br />
DEPARTMENTAL SECRETARIES FOR ' THE GENERAL WORKING, AND P<br />
FOR ALL THE BUSINESS' OF THEIR DEPARTMENTS WAS p)<br />
SUBORDINATE TO THE FUNDAMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY OF RI<br />
MINISTERS, DERIVED FROM THE CONSITUTION, TO ADMINISTER 01<br />
DEPARTMENTS. IT ALSO PROVIDED FOR MORE FLEXIBLE P.,<br />
APPOINTMENT AND TENURE PROVISIONS FOR SECRETARIES. A A]<br />
WE ESTABLISHED THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE SERVICE IN PLACE OF LI<br />
THE FORMER SECOND DIVISION, AGAIN WITH MORE FLEXIBLE<br />
APPOINTMENT AND TENURE PROVISIONS. ALL SES VACANCIES<br />
WERE OPENED UP TO PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE PUBLIC SERVICE.<br />
FAR GREATER EMPHASIS WAS PLACED ON MOBILITY AND<br />
MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. THE PUBLIC SERVICE<br />
BOARD, AND LATER THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, WERE<br />
GIVEN IMPORTANT ROLES IN ENSURING THE INTEGRITY OF SES<br />
3046 </p>
<p>STAFFING DECISIONS.<br />
. NDIX I WE MOVED TO ESTABLISH SEPARATE LEGISLATION, THE MEMBERS<br />
OF PARLIAMENT ( STAFF) ACT, FOR THE EMPLOYMENT OF<br />
MINISTERIAL CONSULTANTS AND MINISTERIAL AND ELECTORATE<br />
STAFF, TO FACILITATE APPOINTMENT OF PEOPLE NOT DRAWN<br />
FROM THE PUBLIC SERVICE, WHILE REMOVING ANY POSSIBLE<br />
CHARGES OF POLITICISATION. THE ACT ALSO PROVIDES AN<br />
UMBRELLA FOR CAREER PUBLIC SERVANTS TO GAIN EXPERIENCE<br />
IN A MINISTER'S OFFICE.<br />
OPED<br />
, D A SIGNIFICANT START WAS MADE IN WHAT WAS TO BE AN<br />
KLY ONGOING PROCESS OF DEVOLUTION FROM CENTRAL AGENCIES TO<br />
NS, DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT. FROM 1 JULY 1984, SECRETARIES<br />
FOR WERE GIVEN THE ABILITY TO CREATE AND ABOLISH POSITIONS<br />
AND TO RECLASSIFY THEM. WE ALSO BEGAN THE PROCESS OF<br />
IT INTEGRATING STAFF NUMBERS AND FINANCIAL CONTROLS<br />
MOVING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FORMER FROM THE BOARD TO<br />
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.<br />
OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE ALSO MADE IN PERSONNEL<br />
ND POLICIES. THE MERIT PRINCIPLE AND ANTI-DISCRIMINATION<br />
PROVISIONS WERE INCLUDED IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE ACT.<br />
REQUIREMENTS WERE INTRODUCED FOR EQUAL EMPLOYMENT<br />
ER OPPORTUNITY PROGRAMS AND INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY PLANS.<br />
PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT WAS INTRODUCED FOR PERMANENT STAFF.<br />
A NEW GRIEVANCE AND APPEALS BODY THE MERIT PROTECTION<br />
AND REVIEW AGENCY WAS ESTABLISHED UNDER ITS OWN<br />
OF LEGISLATION.<br />
: S<br />
ES 3047 </p>
<p>RUNNING PARALLEL TO THESE CHANGES WERE OUR REFORMS TO<br />
THE BUDGET AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PROCESSES, THE MOST<br />
IMPORTANT OF WHICH HAS BEEN THE PROGRESSIVE INTRODUCTION<br />
OF PROGRAM BUDGETING. FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS<br />
ENABLED MINISTERS AND THE PARLIAMENT TO BE GIVEN<br />
RELIABLE COSTINGS OF GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES, PROGRAM BY<br />
PROGRAM, RATHER THAN THE PREVIOUS UNHELPFUL BREAKDOWN BY<br />
TYPE OF EXPENDITURE, SUCH AS TRAVEL, TELEPHONES,<br />
STATIONERY. SUCH INFORMATION IS VITAL FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST, IT<br />
GIVES INDIVIDUAL MANAGERS A FAR GREATER SENSE OF<br />
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE EXPENDITURE OF PROGRAM FUNDS.<br />
SECONDLY, IT ENABLES MINISTERS TO TAKE FAR MORE INFORMED<br />
DECISIONS ON THE COMPETING PRIORITIES OF VARIOUS<br />
POLICIES hND PROGRIMS. IN THE PRRSKNT FISCM, t. I NTR.<br />
PROGRAM BUDGE~ TING HAS ASSISTEHD IN THE CONTINUING AND<br />
RIGOROUS SEARCH FOR OFFSETS AND TRADE-OFFS.<br />
AT THE SAME TIME WE ADOPTED A POLICY OF RELEASING<br />
FORWARD ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE AND, CONTRARY TO LONG<br />
HELD VIEWS IN SOME QUARTERS, THIS HAS NOT HAD THE DIRE<br />
ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES PREDICTED.<br />
IN 1986 A DRAMATIC TURN-AROUND IN OUR TERMS OF TRADE<br />
CREATED ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MADE THE PROCESSES<br />
OF REFORM ON THE GOVERNMENT'S AGENDlA MUCH MORE IMPORTANT<br />
AND URGENT. THERE NEEDED TO BE A FUNDAMENTAL<br />
RESTRUCTURING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY TO<br />
ENABLE US TO COMPETE INTERNATIONALLY AND ENABLE<br />
CONTINUED DOMESTIC GROWTH. IT WAS NECESSARY TO ASK THE<br />
PRIVATE SECTOR TO MAKE SACRIFICES IN THIS AU3USTMENT<br />
PROCESS AND TO FIND MEANS OF FURTHER INCREASING ITS<br />
EFFICIENCY.<br />
104 8 </p>
<p>WE COULD HARDLY DO SO WITHOUT CONSIDERING WHAT<br />
ADJUSTMENTS SHOULD BE MADE IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR TO<br />
ASSIST, THE PROCESS OF CHANGE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, AND<br />
INDEED WITHOUT SEEKING TO SET AN EXAMPLE BY ACCELERATING<br />
THE DRIVE FOR GREATER EFFICIENCY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR.<br />
THAT IS THE BACKGROUND TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR DECISIONS<br />
ANNOUNCED BY ME IN THE PARLIAMENT ON 25 SEPEMBER 1986.<br />
AN EFFICIENCY DIVIDEND WAS REQUIRED FROM DEPARTMENTS AND<br />
AGENCIES FOR THE THREE FINANCIAL YEARS BEGINNING IN<br />
1987-88, INITIALLY SET AT 1% OF ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES<br />
AND SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED TO 1.25%.<br />
AN EFFICIENCY SCRUTINY UNIT WAS ESTABLISHED UNDER THE<br />
LEADERSHIP OF AN EXPERIENCED BUSINESSMAN, MR DAVID<br />
BLOCK. A LARGE NUMBER OF SCRUTINIES OF ADMINISTRATIVE<br />
APPROACHES AND PRACTICES WAS CONDUCTED UNDER THE<br />
UMBRELLA OF THE UNIT. THEY WERE CARRIED OUT BY<br />
DEPARTMENTAL STAFF SPECIALLY SELECTED AND TRAINED FOR<br />
THE PURPOSE. 25% OF THE SAVINGS ACHIEVED ( SOME<br />
$ 100 MILLION IN A FULL YEAR) WAS ALLOWED TO BE RETAINED<br />
BY THE DEPARTMENTS AS AN INCENTIVE, AND THAT INCENTIVE<br />
REMAINS IN PLACE WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR FURTHER<br />
SCRUTINIES RESTING CLEARLY WITH DEPARTMENTS.<br />
OTHER INCENTIVES FOR IMPROVED MANAGEMENT WERE ALSO PUT<br />
IN PLACE.<br />
FOR EXAMPLE, THERE WAS PROVISION FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY<br />
IN FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, IN PARTICULAR BY PERMITTING<br />
SOME CARRY-OVER OF FUNDS FROM ONE FINANCIAL YEAR TO THE<br />
NEXT AND BY PROVIDING GREATER FREEDOM TO MOVE FUNDS<br />
BETWEEN SALARIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES VOTES. : 304 9 </p>
<p>a V'<br />
THERE WERE, AS WELL, MAJOR CHANGES TO THE ARRANGEMENTS<br />
FOR THE REDEPLOYMENT AND RETIREMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICE<br />
STAFF, AND MANY CHANGES STREAMLINING PERSONNEL<br />
MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING FURTHER DEVOLUTION TO DEPARTMENTS.<br />
I ALSO FORESHADOWED, ON 25 SEPTEMBER 1986, THE EXTENSIVE<br />
RESTRUCTURING OF PUBLIC SERVICE JOB CLASSIFICATIONS<br />
DESIGNED TO REMOVE OBSOLETE DISTINCTIONS, TO REDUCE THE<br />
OVERALL NUMBER OF PERSONNEL TRANSACTIONS, AND THROUGH<br />
MULTI-. SKILLING TO PROVIDE GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN THE USE<br />
OF PERSONNEL. THESE CHANGES ARE NOW BEING IMPLEMENTED<br />
FOLLOWING CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION COMMISSION<br />
APPROVAL AS PART OF THE SECOND TIER WAGE ROUND IN<br />
ACCORDANCE WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S WAGES POLICY.<br />
AS WELL AS THE SUBSTANTIAL REFORMS IN THE PUBLIC<br />
SERVICE, WE HAVE GIVEN CLOSE ATTENTION TO STATUTORY<br />
AUTHORITIES. IN JANUARY 1986, OUR POLICY STATEMENT<br />
" REFORM OF COMMONWEALTH PRIMARY INDUSTRY STATUTORY<br />
MARKETING AUTHORITIES" WAS ISSUED AND SUBSEQUENTLY<br />
LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PASSED ENABLING THESE AUTHORITIES<br />
TO ADOPT A MORE FLEXIBLE COMMERCIAL APPROACH TO THE<br />
MARKETING OF RURAL PRODUCTS.<br />
A POLICY INFORMATION PAPER, " POLICY GUIDELINES FOR<br />
COMMONWEALTH STATUTORY AUTHORITIES AND GOVERNMENT<br />
BUSINESS ENTERPRISES", WAS TABLED BY MY COLLEAGUE, PETER<br />
WALSH, IN OCTOBER 1987 AND SINCE THEN EXTENSIVE WORK HAS<br />
BEEN DONE, ESPECIALLY IN THE TRANSPORT AND<br />
COMMUNICATIONS PORTFOLIO, ON THE RESHAPING OF GOVERNMENT<br />
BUSINESS ENTERPRISES TO ENABLE THEM TO OPERATE MORE<br />
COMPETITIVELY, TO BE FREED OF MANY BUREAUCRATIC<br />
CONTROLS, AND SO THAT THEY MAY BE HELD MORE ACCOUNTABLE<br />
FOR THEIR PERFORMANCE.<br />
3050 </p>
<p>vi<br />
DETAILS OF THE CHANGES MADE IN RELATION TO THESE<br />
BUSINESS ENTERPRISES WERE CONTAINED IN THE MAY STATEMENT<br />
THIS YEAR, AND FURTHER WORK IS PROCEEDING IN RELATION TO<br />
OTHER BUSINESS ENTERPRISES AND STATUTORY AUTHORITIES. 3051 </p>
