TH; AALU:<br />
PRiVE PANISTER 4 April 1978<br />
REPORTS OF THE AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND<br />
TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL<br />
Mr Speaker, for the information of Honourable members, I<br />
present two reports of the Australian Scienkce and Technology<br />
Council. (" ASTEC").<br />
The first is a report on the activities of the interim ASTEC,<br />
which was formed on 29 April 1976 and terminated on 29 March 1977.<br />
The second, is a report by the permanent ASTEC, established by<br />
the Government in April 1977, on energy research and development,<br />
in Australia.<br />
The Government is most conscious of the vital need for the future<br />
development of Australia, to utilise the nation' s science and<br />
technology resources efficiently and effectively. As these<br />
valuable resources are limited, it is the Government's task to<br />
encourage their use rationally and wisely in Australia's best<br />
long-term interests.<br />
To assist us in this task, ASTEC has been established as an<br />
independent body of the highest quality and standing to advise us<br />
on the application of Australian scientific and technological<br />
expertise to national problems, and on any other matters relating<br />
to science and technology which may be referred to ASTEC, or<br />
which it chooses to examine on its own initiative.<br />
The interim ASTEC was re-established by this Government in April 1976<br />
with the principal task of advising on the arrangements for a<br />
permanent Australian Science and Technology Council. It presented<br />
its report to me in November 1976, and I tabled that Report,<br />
and announced the formation of the permanent ASTEC, in the House<br />
on 19 April 1977. </p>
<p>-2<br />
The first Report I now table presents details of the other<br />
activities of the interim ASTEC during its period of operation.<br />
Among the more important of these activities was the advice<br />
ASTEC offered on three matters referred to it by the Government<br />
in August 1976. These matters were:<br />
Whether Australia should establish facilities to receive<br />
information from LANDSAT, the United States of America's<br />
earth resources satellite; whether Australia should participate<br />
in the first world-wide experiment of the global atmospheric<br />
research programme and the extent to which the Commonwealth<br />
should be involved in the coordination of information on<br />
Australia's unique flora and fauna.<br />
The Government has already taken action on the first two of<br />
these questions, our decisions being in line with ASTEC's advice<br />
which was of great assistance to us. The third matter is<br />
presently being considered by the Government and I expect the<br />
minister for Science to make an announcement on long-term<br />
organisational arrangements for biological surveys within the<br />
next few months.<br />
ASTEC's advice to the Government on these three matters is<br />
reproduced in full in the Report.<br />
Mr Speaker, the second Report I table today is the Report by<br />
ASTEC of October last year on Australia's energy research and<br />
development needs, a topic which I asked the Council to examine<br />
as a matter of high priority.<br />
In preparing its report, the Council received submissions from<br />
a wide range of people in the community and was assisted by a<br />
number of other recent reports on energy research and development.<br />
In particular, the Council derived useful information from the<br />
Report on Solar energy by the Senate Standing Committee on<br />
National Resources tabled in May last year, and reports by the<br />
Institution of Engineers and the Department of Science referred<br />
to in paragraph 1.4 of the Council's Report. </p>
<p>-3<br />
Honourable Members may be aware that on 15 December 1977,<br />
the Right Honourable Minister for National Resources released<br />
a Report of the National Energy Advisory Committee on a similar<br />
topic.<br />
ASTEC's report confirms the assessment of the National Energy<br />
Advisory Committee on priorities in energy research and development,<br />
and the Committee's views that there is scope for a significant<br />
increase in our effort on energy research and development. At<br />
the same time, ASTEC's report recommends machinery for the<br />
proper coordination of such increased expenditure.<br />
I consider the ASTEC Report on energy to be a most valuable<br />
contribution to our planning to meet Australia's future energy<br />
demands. The Minister for National Developmenthas derived<br />
considerable assistance from the Report in developing proposals<br />
to implement the Government's undertakingannounced prior to the<br />
elections last November, to expand the energy research and<br />
development programme, and to establish a high level body to<br />
advise on special measures to administer that programme.<br />
Further details of these matters will be announced by the<br />
Minister for National Development in the near future.<br />
Finally, Mr Speaker, for the information of Honourable Members,<br />
I should mention that the permanent ASTEC has in the past year<br />
provided advice on a number of important matters concerned with<br />
Government science including providing comments on various reports<br />
submitted to the Government, and consulting with Departments on<br />
a number of current issues concerning science and technology.<br />
ASTEC's major activity has been the preparation of a comprehensive<br />
review of the state of science and technology in Australia in 1977.<br />
This Report is expected to be available by mid-year, and I am<br />
confident that it will be a most valuable document in the development<br />
of Australia's science and technology policy. It will provide the<br />
basis on which ASTEC will formulate its future advice to the<br />
Government, and will play an important part in the process of<br />
Government decision-making on science and technology.<br />
Mr Speaker, I announced in the House on 19 April 1977 that the<br />
Government intended to establish ASTEC as a statutory body to give<br />
it the status, permanence and stability required to allow it to<br />
undertake its important role in advising the Government on<br />
Science and technology. I shall be bringing forward legislation<br />
in the present sitting of Parliament to achieve this objective. </p>
