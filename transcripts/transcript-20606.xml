    <content><![CDATA[<p>I wish to congratulate Mr Frank Lowy AC on his announcement that he will establish a research institute in international policy in Sydney.</p>
<p> Mr Lowy is a distinguished Australian who has made an important contribution to the economic and social life of Australia over the last fifty years. His is the quintessential migrant success story. Building on economic success Mr Lowy has made significant philanthropic contributions over the years.</p>
<p>His initiative to provide in the order of $30 million to fund the Institute is the latest instalment in his distinguished service to Australia. The Institute will seek to generate ideas that will promote Australia's long term national interest, including improving the access of Australians to what he terms "the international marketplace of ideas" in a practical policy-orientated way.</p>
<p>I particularly applaud the potential role of the Institute in engaging the Australian public on international issues.</p>
