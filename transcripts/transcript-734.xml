FOR PRESS: P. M. NO. 38/ 1263<br />
DEATH OF NEW ZEALAND HIGH COMMISSIONER IN<br />
AUSTRALIA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert<br />
Menzie s<br />
I heard the news immediately after my arrival<br />
in Melbourne this morning and I was deeply shocked by it.<br />
Mr. Johnston was a splendid representative<br />
of his country, well-informed, easy and friendly. It is<br />
a tragedy that he should be cut off in the middle of his<br />
service to our sister country at a time when he seemed to<br />
have many years of public-spirited life left to him.<br />
:. Ieex tend our very deep sympathy to his w. idow<br />
and family.<br />
CANBER. RA, 7<br />
May, 1963. </p>
