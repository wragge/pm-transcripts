<p>This week, the member nations of the United Nations are expected to vote on the Palestinian observer status resolution.</p>
<p>Should the Question of Palestine resolution come forward, Australia will abstain.</p>
<p>The Government's position balances our long-standing support for the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and their own state with our concern that the only durable basis for resolution of this conflict is direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
<p>This draft resolution, if passed by UN member states, will accord non-member Observer state status in the UN to the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>It reaffirms the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination but does not confer statehood.</p>
<p>Australia strongly supports a negotiated two-state solution that allows a secure Israel to live side-by-side with a secure and independent future Palestinian state.</p>
<p>We urge both sides to return to negotiations in good faith.</p>
