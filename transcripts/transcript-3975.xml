ELECTORAL TALK<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, since I last spoke to you, the Labor Party<br />
* Leader, Mr Whitlam has been dismissed as Prime Minister by the<br />
Governor General and I have been commissioned as Prime Minister.<br />
This would not have happened if Mr Whitlam had been prepared to<br />
accept the decision of Parliament. What the Opposition Parties wanted<br />
were general elections, to enable the people of Australia to pass<br />
judgement on a government which we believe had by its conduct<br />
forfeited the trust of the nation.<br />
There is no great need to dwell now on the incompetence of Mr Whit]. am's<br />
adninistration in the economic management of the Australian economy.<br />
The importance of that task was something which Mr Whitlam and his<br />
succession of Treasurers never seemed to grasp.<br />
Instead, as Mr Crean was succeeded by Dr Cairns and as Dr Cairns was<br />
Sreplaced by Mr Hayden, Australians suffered housewives on tight<br />
budgets, farmers, small business firms, young people leaving school<br />
and finally 300,000 people who are out of work.<br />
hile the administration which Labor provided pursued its impracticable<br />
objectives the hope which had been raised vanished like mirages as<br />
inflation, unemployment and crippling inflation destroyed the basis<br />
of former prosperity.<br />
For -many Aqtralians it was a sd and tragic spectacle as credibility<br />
d-ained-fr thhe Tnitlam admina-&amp; tration.<br />
On top of the massive incompetence of the former administration there<br />
were the improprieties'.<br />
Over the three years of Labor government four men acted as Prime<br />
Minister of this nation. All four have been sacked one way or<br />
another. The dismissal of the third ranking member of the Labor cabinet,<br />
Mr Rex Connor, last month on top of all the incompetence and dissi]. lusion<br />
left the Opposition with no choice but to act. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Twice men who had been entrusted with responsibility for conducting<br />
the affairs of the nation during Mr Whitlams many overseas journeys<br />
have been dismissed for misleading the parliament or Prime Minister.<br />
The Opposition had no alternative but to defer the budget and call<br />
on Mr W-hitlam to agree to elections.<br />
For Mr Whitlamy, the sensible'course of action was to hold elections<br />
immediately the decision to defer supply was taken.<br />
The second sensible course would have been to accept the compromise<br />
which we offered publicly, and the opportunity we gave for private<br />
discussion. But Mr Whitlam refused to seek an election and refused to give the<br />
people of Australia the vote which was needed to resolve the situation.<br />
* If he had done this he would have faced the electors as Prime Minister.<br />
Mr Whitlam would not acknowledge that his administration never had<br />
command of the Parliament because it never controlled the Senate.<br />
That is the basis for his unconstitutional behaviour which<br />
* ventually led to his dismissal.<br />
Knowing quite well the Liberal and National Country Parties did not<br />
have a majority in the House of Representatives, I accepted the<br />
commission as Prime Minister on the basis that I would immediately<br />
recommend to the Governor General a double dissolution.<br />
As soon as the Appropriation Bills had received the royal assent I<br />
did so.<br />
The double dissolution was on the most favourable terms possible for<br />
he Labor Party.<br />
The 21 bills which had been held up in the Senate because they<br />
contained arbitrary and dictatorial powers were cited in the<br />
petition dissolving Parliament.<br />
They can thus be put to a joint sitting of the two chambers of<br />
Parliament after December 13 if the new Government chooses to use<br />
that device. We certainly would not do so because the bills<br />
contain arbitrary and unreasonable powers.<br />
Thed~ i ss1A t ~ ns Thu the fairest possible form.<br />
The course of action we chose was a proper one. It was open to<br />
Mr Whitlam.<br />
Under the terms of my commission from the Governor General the<br />
Opposition Parties are pledged to introduce no new policies until<br />
after the December election.<br />
But we have ready a full programme of policies to revive Australia<br />
and we seek the approval and support of the Australian people to<br />
put those policies into effect. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Our policies will provide jobs.<br />
They will help small businesses and firms.<br />
They will provide stability and the sense of direction Australia<br />
so badly needs.<br />
These policies have been developed over the last several months.<br />
The main points of our approach will be announced in the<br />
policy speech on November OOOooOOO<br />
