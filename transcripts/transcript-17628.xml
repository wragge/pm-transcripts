The Prime Minister today expressed the Government's gratitude for a $NZ4 million ($A3.1m) Australia Day donation by New Zealand to help Queensland and Victoria recover from the floods.</p>
<p>New Zealand has donated $NZ3 million to the Queensland Premier's Flood Relief Fund and NZ$1 million to the Red Cross Victorian Floods Appeal.</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand share the closest of bonds. As nations, we both know what it is like to suffer from natural disasters. We are there for each other in times of crisis and great need.</p>
<p>I would like to thank the Government and people of New Zealand for responding so generously to the floods in the spirit of our trans-Tasman ties.  New Zealand's assistance will help the people of Queensland and Victoria to get back on their feet.</p>
<p>New Zealand was also quick to respond to the floods in Queensland by sending a team of emergency management and disaster recovery specialists to provide practical support to the State's emergency services.  </p>
