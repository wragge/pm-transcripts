TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
AND THE MINISTER FOR PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY, SEN<br />
THE HON BOB COLLINS, PRESS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE,<br />
CANBERRA, 21 SEPTEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Some weeks ago I said that the seriousness of the drought, the<br />
exceptional circumstances of the drought required a new systematic,<br />
systemic response from the Government to deal with it. To put in<br />
place a system of arrangements that would stay in place for the<br />
intermittent attacks of exceptional drought which we have been seeing.<br />
As you know, the Government put into place a drought policy in 1992<br />
and that policy is, outside of the areas of exceptional circumstances,<br />
working well. I also said, last week, when visiting Queensland that the<br />
Government takes an approach which is an inclusive one; that we<br />
won't see segments or sections of the community distressed as we<br />
saw with the unemployed, in the long-term unemployed, and that we<br />
would not leave them behind. And, I made these comments in relation<br />
to distressed farm families that we wouldn't forget them, that we<br />
wouldn't leave them behind.<br />
Well, today the Government, in the Cabinet, in submissions introduced<br />
by my colleague Senator Collins, has adopted a set of measures which<br />
meets those two criteria. That is, a systemic approach to the problems<br />
of exceptional drought circumstances and meeting the commitment not<br />
to leave farm families in distressed circumstances behind.<br />
As well as that, principally of course, the package is about meeting the<br />
immediate needs of these people and also to help them set<br />
themselves up for when the rain comes, when the drought finishes.<br />
Let me just run through the major elements of it. There are five major<br />
elements. One is income support. Another is looking after the<br />
education of children, of farmers in drought affected areas. Providing<br />
additional financial assistance for farms for carry-on finance and </p>
<p>increasing dramatically the limits for maximum levels of assistance.<br />
Improving the ability of farmers to access RAS without first selling off<br />
all off-farm assets and the development of incentives for the provision<br />
of farm storage and water facilities. Now, let me go down these points.<br />
There was income support in the first instance that many distressed<br />
families on the land needed. They just simply needed money to put<br />
bread on the table and to feed their families and to look after<br />
necessities. We are introducing that with a new payment called the<br />
Drought Relief Payment ( DRP) which will provide farm families with<br />
funds to cover those necessities. Payments will be made to farm<br />
families in exceptional drought declared areas. The payments will not<br />
be subject to a farm assets test, so we are removing the farm assets<br />
test in respect of that payment, but the income will be subject to the<br />
JobSearch Allowance income and off farm assets test. And, we will be<br />
also paying that payment for six months after the exceptional<br />
circumstance conditions are terminated. That is the principle income<br />
support measure.<br />
The second item is, of course, education. You know that many farmers<br />
have been very disturbed by the fact that they have had to take kids<br />
from school, pull their children out of school and take them home<br />
because they couldn't afford to maintain them. To deal with that very<br />
human situation, a real problem for families, the Government is<br />
removing existing Austudy farm assets test for all families in<br />
exceptional drought areas. The current Austudy income test, which I<br />
might say, is more generous than the JobSearch Allowance income<br />
test, will apply.<br />
So, what we were being asked Senator Collins and me in these<br />
various meetings we have had with farm communities, what we had<br />
been asked is that the farm -assets test be removed in respect of<br />
Austudy. We are removing it for families in these excepntional drought<br />
areas. Now, the third element and can I just say, I think, one of the real<br />
problems in this is and I'll come to the third element about providing<br />
financial assistance to farms there is a real stress, I think, upon<br />
families in rural Australia, in the bush, in these exceptional drought<br />
circumstances. And, the risk, I think, we run is that we would start to<br />
see a real change in the nature of the, if you like, the family structure<br />
of Australian farming particularly as young people look at what has<br />
happened to their parents and decide to walk away from the land and<br />
where we see if farmers think they can't make a go of it, in the end<br />
their land is bought at a discount by industrial companies and we see a<br />
lot of, if you like, large company farming and we loose that whole<br />
social infrastructure which we have always known in this country. I<br />
think, the drought does present that risk and these exceptional </p>
<p>circumstances present that risk. So, the income support and the<br />
education is to deal with that immediate problem.<br />
Now, on farm finance we are saying this: In a very large change in<br />
respect of these exceptional circumstance areas that RAS the Rural<br />
Adjustment Scheme and carry-on finance under RAS will be demand<br />
driven. It will not be cash limited. Now, what happens now is<br />
someone could actually qualify for RAS, but only get a part payment<br />
and they could only get a part payment because there is only so much<br />
money in the bin. So, what the Government has decided today is to<br />
take away the cash limiting and let it be demand driven which will<br />
mean that those who are eligible will get the full amount due to them,<br />
which can be up to 100 per cent of the interest rate subsidies for viable<br />
farms. You know the problem that many farmers have. They have now had<br />
seven or eight crops put in and they have failed. Depending on the<br />
size of the farms, crops can cost $ 60-70 ,000 a season and you don't<br />
have to be a mathematician to work out that very quickly you can run<br />
into debts of $ 300-400,000. It is the capacity to meet those debt<br />
interest obligation that we are seeking to do here. So, we are<br />
expanding the pool so that eligibility will be met, but we are doing<br />
something as well as that we are dramatically lifting the limits for that<br />
which a farmer can receive under RAS. From a maximum annual<br />
amount of $ 50,00-$ 100,000 and from an accumulative amount over<br />
five years from $ 100,000 to $ 300,000. So, $ 50,000-$ 100,000 in<br />
respect of the maximum for annual assistance and the cumulative over<br />
five years from $ 1,00,0004$ 300,000. That is an enormous extension to<br />
the limits and it is in a system which will then be demand driven and<br />
not cash limited. So, that is the third principle element for financial<br />
assistance. We are also extending anoth er concession. Many people on the land<br />
try to provide some retirement assets for themselves or a retirement<br />
home. This happens where, if you like, parents get to the point where<br />
they think their farming life is over and their children take the farm<br />
over. They have to go somewhere, and, what prudent farmers do, they<br />
buy themselves a house in a town or on the coast or somewhere else.<br />
As things stand now, a farmer would need to sell that house or<br />
liquidate bona fide retirement assets such as superannuation funds or<br />
a pool of superannuation assets to qualify for RAS. In other words,<br />
they have got to dispose of all those assets before they can get RAS.<br />
Well, we think this tends to fly in the face of the need for this turnover<br />
in the farm sector and for a retirement income for farmers who leave<br />
the land at some point in their lives. So, we are excluding bona fide<br />
retirement assets and off-farm assets from the RAS assets test. That<br />
is the other element of the farm finance. And, of course, I have said<br />
that in the recovery phase these payments are not simply there until<br />
the termination of the drought declaration, we have now decided today<br />
L </p>
<p>to leave them six months after that. So, in other words after it rains<br />
and they are back to some sort of normality, we are leaving the<br />
payments there for six months until they can start to get some income<br />
in. Now, on top of that one of the things which, I think, farm leaders have<br />
said to Senator Collins and they have certainly said to me that outside<br />
of these things such as income support, education, farm finance<br />
support, there is also the question of the future about fodder, about<br />
improving fodder storage and water storage to make farms as drought<br />
resistant or as drought proof as possible.<br />
The Government decided today that we would develop a set of<br />
incentives for the provision of farm storage and water facilities and<br />
we're thinking of a generous investment allowance; we're also<br />
prepared to look at a faster depreciation of certain assets. But, we<br />
don't want to see a position as we saw with the earlier tax incentives<br />
for tree pulling, that there is major despoilation of the landscape or<br />
people trying to turn impossibly marginal land into useful land by an<br />
indiscriminate policy of water storages. So, my colleague, Senator<br />
Collins and the Treasurer and the Minister for the Environment will sit<br />
down with farm leaders and work out what we think can be an effective<br />
package of incentives for the future for the encouragement of storages<br />
for fodder and also for water.<br />
Now, there are other matters such as counselling and support services<br />
which are mentioned in more detail in the press statement. But, I<br />
would just like to conclude my remarks on these points then invite<br />
Senator Collins'to make some to you as well; and it is this, this<br />
package is necessary in the interests of fairness, cohesion, in the<br />
interests of the whole Australian economy. Because, there is a<br />
substantial risk here that with prolonged drought in exceptional<br />
circumstances such as these that we will see large sections of our<br />
farming and grazing lands either poorly attended or unattended. And,<br />
what has been a tremendously powerful industry for this country and<br />
a way of life which has been part of the ethos of the country at some<br />
substantial risk. It is for these reasons that we think this package, as<br />
exceptional as it is in terms of the changes which it introduces and the<br />
new principles which it encapsulates, is necessary for all Australians<br />
and is in the interests of all Australians.<br />
So, I said earlier and let me repeat this, we are not going to leave<br />
these people behind but we don't want to pick them up and then put<br />
them down without a chance of them getting back on their feet and<br />
being able to reestablish themselves on the land. And, this is what this<br />
package is about. It will total about $ 169 million over two years but if<br />
the drought continues and more areas are declared, of course, the<br />
cost will rise because the scheme will be available, generally<br />
available, it will not be cash limited. So, it could be up to $ 200 million </p>
<p>or it may exceed it. With those comments I will invite Senator Collins<br />
to make some points.<br />
SC: Thanks Paul. I think the first thing to say about this package which will<br />
certainly be obvious to the rural writers in this room is that it is a very<br />
significant package. Not just significant in terms of dollars although<br />
it certainly is significant in terms of dollars it is significant,<br />
particularly, in terms of the policy development that this represents.<br />
Farmers are going to recognise this package because it has been<br />
developed out of the extensive, on the ground consultations that we<br />
have had, including, I might add, the Prime Minister's visit to<br />
Queensland. The caveat, I might add farmers certainly haven't got<br />
all they want in this package and never will is that all of this,<br />
although it addresses the identified problems, as the Prime Minister<br />
has said, which have been brought to us by farmers, is all consistent<br />
with a rational, national drought policy, the one that was developed in<br />
1992 and we will adhere to that. That is, that the Government's major<br />
attention will continue to focus on assisting farmers to plan and<br />
manage for drought whilst acknowledging the fact that in a drought<br />
which, without question in parts of Queensland and NSW is now the<br />
worst on record we are extending special assistance in terms of that<br />
crisis. Again, I know that there will be people in this room that will recognise<br />
that a great deal of work and, indeed, thought has gone into this<br />
package in a very short time. And, I have to say that I am extremely<br />
grateful for the full blooded support that this submission received in<br />
Cabinet from thePrime Minister. It may not have got through in the<br />
style that it did, otherwise. So, I would finish with those few remarks<br />
but the one thing that I do want to say is this: anybody who looks at<br />
this policy will see where it is directed. It is going to provide significant<br />
assistance directly to the families concerned in a targeted way.<br />
Drought policies in the past have delivered significant assistance, and<br />
a lot of it has been wasted and abused. There is no question about<br />
that. The three substantial differences between this approach and the<br />
approach that is still being advocated by the Opposition on it, there are<br />
three substantial differences between this and the Opposition's<br />
approach. First of all this has been developed after extensive<br />
consultation with Australian farmers and the Peak bodies that<br />
represent them. Secondly, it is carefully targeted to address the real<br />
need and thirdly, of course, it is actually costed with real dollars. And,<br />
with those concluding remarks, perhaps, we could take questions.<br />
J: Do you reject outright the fodder subsidies which have been put up by<br />
some people?<br />
SC: Yes. Because it is an extremely ineffective measure and as you know<br />
they are not just my words. It was attacked the day it was produced,<br />
by organisations such as the Grains Council, the National Farmers </p>
<p>Federation and, indeed, the Cattle Council of Australia presumably the<br />
people who would represent the lobby that would, presumably, benefit<br />
most. Because, they all know the huge flaws in it. Even the<br />
Opposition when they advocated it, on the day they launched it,<br />
conceded that it was open to abuse, but that they would wave a magic<br />
wand and fix that. This is far more targeted. If I just give you an<br />
indication of how better this The JSA ( Job Search Allowance) the<br />
family assistance that we are providing, if you take a typical example<br />
the Prime Minister and myself have seen plenty of them recently a<br />
farm couple with two or three kids, farm couples in fact tend to have<br />
more than two or three kids but let's take that as an average, this is<br />
going to put, in terms of disposable income into that arrangement<br />
around $ 25,000 a year, in disposable cash income with no strings<br />
attached, like fodder subsidies, that wasn't there before. And, that<br />
really is the benefit of this.<br />
In addition, and have a look at the package, as the Prime Minister has<br />
said, we have significantly enhanced the RAS component of this and<br />
there are large dollars attached to that, as they have to be. The<br />
benefit of that is that there may well be farmers in extreme drought<br />
situations, who take farming decisions that mean that something else<br />
has got a greater priority than fodder. This kind of assistance is going<br />
to give them the flexibility to do that instead of us determining that<br />
fodder is what they need. And, of course, as you well know, at the end<br />
of the day the last time this was used in 1982 the chief beneficiaries<br />
were the suppliers of the fodder and the transport companies and not<br />
the people on the ground. Because, go back and have a look at that<br />
scheme because people have actually forgotten what it actually was...<br />
It not only was'capped but it was capped to a particular price per<br />
tonne. As the price increased the value of that subsidy continually<br />
decreased over the life of the subsidy. So, in fact it is a totally<br />
unacceptable approach, this one is much better.<br />
J: How many farmers will benefit from RAS<br />
SC: Well, to take a broad figure there are around 12,000 families currently,<br />
farmers, out of about 125,000 that are in extreme difficulty. And, they<br />
are the people that this package is designed to help. We would expect<br />
that there would be two to three thousand farmers who would be<br />
directly assisted with substantial additional assistance, through RAS,<br />
in a way they haven't been before. But, it goes beyond that, the<br />
Austudy changes will be particularly welcome in the bush, I think<br />
people will be very pleased about that. And, that Austudy assistance<br />
and, of course, the family disposable income that is going to go into<br />
those households addresses that as well. But, two to three thousand<br />
families at least but I expect that it will be considerably broader than<br />
that in terms of the total benefits of this package. </p>
<p>7<br />
The one thing that I do want to stress at this point is that this does<br />
have to be strictly administered, this does apply to farmers who are in<br />
crisis. This is not a scheme that applies to the farming community<br />
across Australia. It is a special range of assistance measures that will<br />
help farmers who are in extreme trouble. That is, farmers who are in<br />
drought now and who have been droughted for a number of years.<br />
That is, essentially, farmers in Queensland and at this point in time,<br />
farmers in Northern NSW.<br />
J: Do the states support it because ( inaudible)<br />
SC: I am glad you have asked that question because I did want to say, the<br />
states have got a very significant responsibility in this which they have<br />
to discharge. And, I don't think that any state minister for agriculture<br />
or, indeed, Premier, could look at a package as well targeted and<br />
substantial as this and, with a straight face, say that the<br />
Commonwealth was not doing its bit. Now, this is particularly<br />
important because there is a meeting of all of the primary industry<br />
ministers on Friday, being convened here in Canberra. And, this will<br />
go right on the table. They have got a role to play, as you say, in this<br />
and one of the things that I think has been happening in the past is this<br />
and this is something that has been identified just in terms of the<br />
examination we have made of this. The way the scheme works, as you<br />
know, is that up to a fifty per cent subsidy the Commonwealth provides<br />
the lion's share of that support. Ninety per cent as against ten per<br />
cent. Over fifty per cent we match that dollar for dollar with the states<br />
and we have put a very large additional sum of money in here to do<br />
that. But, the states have to match that dollar for dollar. I think what<br />
has been happehing in some states more than others, is that there has<br />
been a deliberate move made to concentrate the assistance on our<br />
dollars and not the states' dollars. Now I have to say that some states<br />
have dramatically not been doing that, and I would mention<br />
Queensland, which has got an extremely well-administered RAS<br />
scheme. That's generally conceded across Australia. Now,<br />
Queensland in fact matched us dollar for dollar to take subsidies up to<br />
100 per cent when New South Wales in fact at the time refused to do<br />
so. And I hope that's not the case this time. So I would be, there are<br />
farmers who need the 100 per cent subsidy. Now as you know, that's<br />
been identified as a problem with RAS in a crisis. As the Prime<br />
Minister said, RAS works very well in a pre-crisis time. It's got some<br />
acknowledged deficiencies and the biggest one we have now<br />
addressed. That is, to allow farmers to get a 100 per cent subsidy<br />
when they need it, that is, an interest-free loan. Now the States will<br />
have to play their part in delivering that. I hope they do.<br />
J: farm management<br />
BC: Well, that's all part of a long-term examination of the scheme. But can<br />
I say to you, I think this is a far more effective way of dealing with it </p>
<p>than the taxation system. And the Prime Minister in fact has<br />
mentioned a far better approach than taxation measures and that is an<br />
investment allowance which is properly constructed, carefully put<br />
together in consultation with the farming community, that will provide<br />
an incentive. And the reasons are obvious. Tax breaks only work if<br />
you are paying tax. If you are a crisis farmer that hasn't had an income<br />
for four years, a tax break for you is useless and that's one thing that's<br />
been identified with us. What people do want to do when times get<br />
better is to have a positive incentive provided to put in water storage<br />
and to put in fodder storage and that's what we have given a<br />
commitment to look at.<br />
J: money is also useful in bad times?<br />
BC: I'm not suggesting that it isn't and can I say that despite all the rhetoric<br />
to the contrary, the lIED scheme is significantly used. I mean there<br />
currently is in excess of 130 million. I think the last time I looked $ 135<br />
million comprising of about 6,500 deposits in that scheme right around<br />
Australia. So as distinct from the rhetoric about it's got to be better, if<br />
it's not much good, I can tell you there's a lot of farmers currently using<br />
it.<br />
J: Prime Minister, your statement mentions that you are going to be<br />
talking to the banks and the pastoral houses. What are you going to<br />
be asking them to do?<br />
PM: Well, they are the recipients of the interest rate subsidies, are they not.<br />
I mean they've got properties, and even if they take the view that they<br />
won't turn people off them, if they took the view they would turn people<br />
off them, what good would it do them, in many cases. So getting the<br />
interest subsidy is a clear benefit to the banking sector from the<br />
Commonwealth via the farm sector and we'll be having a conversation<br />
with the banks about what their policy and attitude is to Supporting<br />
farmers through this period and what longer run view they are going to<br />
take in the event that the drought persists, and in the face of the<br />
accumulations of debt they already have.<br />
J: asking for moratoriums on the debt or interest ? 7<br />
PM: We are going to have a conversation, that's what we'll do in the first<br />
instance. That is to see they have a problem on their hands, the<br />
farmers have a problem on their hands, we are part of the solution and<br />
I think we are prepared to talk to them and see what general policy<br />
they wish to follow and whether they want to be part of the solution as<br />
well.<br />
BC: Could I just mention two things that are particularly irrelevant to banks<br />
but farmers are going to greatly welcome about this package. One of<br />
the key issues that banks are interested in, because this is a subsidy </p>
<p>on interest rates, is what degree of assistance the Government is<br />
going to provide. Now in the past, there has never been any<br />
mandated time period for the extension of these benefits beyond the<br />
breaking of a drought. An extremely important policy development that<br />
has been delivered here is, as the Prime Minister has said, a<br />
mandated period of six months of continued assistance for exceptional<br />
circumstances and on top of that, twelve months of access to the<br />
normal Rural Adjustment Scheme. So eighteen months of continued<br />
support after the drought stops. Now that is going to weigh very<br />
heavily, I think, in any bank's consideration of what they might do with<br />
an outstanding farm loan.<br />
J: There's been some talk about a regional unemployment scheme,<br />
getting people in regional Australia to work on farms, on landcare<br />
activities. You didn't mention that in the package is that not on?<br />
PM: Well, we just committed 1.8 billion in a full year to labour market<br />
programs in the White Paper and I think it is a matter of whether we<br />
can use some of that funding to extend and perhaps better provide in<br />
areas such as LEAP or REAP[?], particularly as they are working in<br />
some of these exceptionally drought affected areas. So in a<br />
commitment that large to the labour market, and labour market<br />
programs that are already up and running, we think the thing to do is<br />
basically try and work some of that funding into it for existing<br />
arrangements. That is schemes that already exist. Labour market<br />
programs already on the ground.<br />
J: Where's the money coming from for this? Will there need to be offsets<br />
or is it simply' out of<br />
PM: No, this is a commitment by the Government to a group of people in<br />
the community just as we would make a commitment to any other<br />
group as we did the long-term unemployed earlier in the year.<br />
BC: There were no offsets from the Department of Primary Industries and<br />
Energy, I can tell you.<br />
J: your support for this submission got it through to the'Cabinet in a<br />
way that might not otherwise have happened. How profound was the<br />
effect on you of your visit to those farmers last week in terms of the<br />
position you took today in Cabinet?<br />
PM: Well it obviously had an influence on my thinking about this, but<br />
perhaps one of the factors is that there were not the Winter rains for<br />
the crop that would be now, that farmers would be putting in now. And<br />
even were that to have been the case, farmers would have to find<br />
another $ 60,000 or $ 70,000, maybe that much, to put in another crop<br />
on top of the six or seven or eight that already failed. So there's a<br />
point where even for say someone who's got a farm with assets of a. </p>
<p>million or a million and a quarter dollars, once they start clocking up-.<br />
three or four hundred thousand dollars of debts and then adding<br />
another sixty and seventy per crop, again you can see what the<br />
looming problem is there. And also the fact that so many of them haver<br />
virtually no savings, no income and no income support. Now that wast<br />
very apparent to me last week and that's why this is such a very large)<br />
change. Never before have we extended income support outside of,<br />
that JSA income and assets test. We're suspending the assets test$.<br />
the farm assets test here, which is a very big public policy decisions<br />
But it's part of a set of arrangements. And that's what I was sayingp<br />
some weeks ago, to deal with a drought like this where it is in these<br />
exceptional circumstances or where it moves in and out of regions six.<br />
months at a time, where a region is drought declared and then nondrought<br />
declared and then drought declared, you need a systemic<br />
approach. This basically I think does that. This is essentially directed,<br />
well it is directed to the exceptional circumstance areas. For those<br />
areas which are not exceptionally affected but which are droughted.<br />
We've got the 1992 package. I mean I think this is the point about the<br />
comprehension of it, vis a vis what Bob Collins said about the National<br />
Party's approach which is basically to throw a fodder subsidy in. Well<br />
a fodder subsidy is not going to help a farm family who have got no<br />
income. It's not going to help them deal with their existing debts. It's<br />
not going to help them with the education of their children.<br />
BC: That's right.<br />
J: Prime Minister, a fodder subsidy would help a cattle producer keep<br />
together a breeding herd and the breeding herd is being run down<br />
rather drastically'-<br />
BC: That's correct, it would. And it would also cost us a minimum, a<br />
minimum, of $ 100 million to implement it, if you were lucky. And I have<br />
to say if I was a farmer, and I was a farmer, and I was given a choice of<br />
a 50 per cent fodder subsidy capped on the price, which it was, on a<br />
maximum price for the tonne of grain, which was then inflated of<br />
course naturally after the market was distorted with the interest<br />
subsidy and this, I would take this every time. This provides<br />
significantly more assistance than the fodder subsidy would and in a<br />
way which is far more flexible for the farmer.<br />
PM: And the other thing<br />
J: What do you think the national cattle herd will be at by about, or for<br />
next year?<br />
BC: Well what I'd suggest you do, and the information is available without<br />
getting bogged down with that, is go back and have a look at the very<br />
extensive analysis that was down on this in the last major drought and<br />
in fact I will be happy to provide you with that information. </p>
<p>J: In the last major drought the cattle herd was kept going by fodder<br />
subsidies.<br />
BC: In the last major drought, the cattle and indeed the sheep flocks did<br />
not, at the end of the day, benefit particularly in terms of the national<br />
maintenance of that herd from a fodder subsidy. What I'd point out to<br />
you is that this comprehensively addresses additional income. As the<br />
Prime Minister has just said, in order to get a fodder subsidy, you have<br />
got to buy the fodder in the first place. What we have done, is provide<br />
enhanced packages of assistance for farmers to get an interest-free<br />
loan with significantly enhanced RAS assets. We've lifted the caps on<br />
RAS that have limited it in the past. And in the case of worst hit<br />
families, put $ 25,000 in disposable cash into that arrangement, which<br />
of course, they'll be able to spend what they like on as any other JSA<br />
recipient can, that was not there before. That's a far more significant<br />
package of assistance in maintaining the national herd than a fodder<br />
subsidy.<br />
PM: And one of the reasons why the National Farmers Federation and the<br />
Grain Growers and others bucketed the National Party proposal a<br />
week or two ago, is because the last time these things they were<br />
rorted. rorted to hell. I mean, in the end there was a you know, the<br />
major beneficiaries of the fodder subsidy were people who basically,<br />
were marketing fodder. I mean, you're better off to say to the farmer<br />
you use your money as you yourself see fit, and we will give you<br />
interest subsidies to help you through, rather than going the other<br />
route of saying well look, we won't really help you, but only to the<br />
extent that you ' buy fodder will we help you, and therefore we will<br />
mostly help the people that own the fodder.<br />
BC: I'll tell you what I said to som e National Party Senators look, before<br />
you have a go.. before you sell me on a fodder subsidyv and 1 am open<br />
to ideas, and I was before you sell it to me, why don't you try and sell<br />
it to the National Farmers Federation, the Grains Council of Australia<br />
and the Cattle Council, then come and see me.<br />
J: Prime Minister, currently you are matching dollar for dollar the funds<br />
raised in the Farml-and Appeal they have currently raised $ 5 million,<br />
so that means you owe them $ 5 million ( the Appeal $ 5 million) that's<br />
largely been distributed for household income support, will you<br />
continue to match that dollar for dollar given the generosity of this<br />
commitment?<br />
PM: Yes, we have said we will and again, there will be people affected by<br />
drought who may not be " exceptionally affected" where the FarmHand<br />
Appeal can actually help. In other words, it's going to be a parcel of<br />
money that can be quite useful in some of the spots that mightn't fit,<br />
some of the criteria here. </p>
<p>J: Mr Keating, you mentioned the figure of $ 150 million to be the cost of<br />
this is it not the case that it will help budget bottom line that NSW<br />
Government rejected your offer of $ 150 million for the Cahill<br />
Expressway?<br />
PM: Well, it's got nothing to do with it Geoff. I mean, the Cahill Expressway<br />
was a nett $ 70 million over 5 years it's about less than $ 20 million a<br />
year for what is an essential public work for NSW, and which the<br />
NSW...<br />
J: ( inaudible)...<br />
PM: I know, but look these puny fiscal points that financial journalists insist<br />
upon raising, let me just put it down immediately in this respect. We<br />
are talking here today in respect of over $ 100 million thereabouts<br />
$ 160 million over 2 years...<br />
BC: Nearly $ 170 million.<br />
PM: Nearly $ 170 million nearly $ 90 million ( this year). All the barrackers<br />
for lower deficits are the, you know, the failed newsletter writers and all<br />
the others that are out there still peddling their morbid tales are<br />
suggesting that maybe we should let that $ 70 million go to the market,<br />
and that the market would use it better. It will go in plant and<br />
equipment. Well, how much of it will go in plant and equipment, and<br />
how much will add to the capital stock, and how much will add to<br />
national growth and employment, current account etc, or how much of<br />
it goes chasing rseal estate, property prices and what have you? So, if<br />
you have got to make a judgement about whether the $ 100 million<br />
dollars here is better used, or the $ 100 million at the Quay is better<br />
used thrown to the market the judgement is as clear as day. They're<br />
better being employed in these schemes. In this case, in and of<br />
course, this sort of point which emerges in journalism occasionally that<br />
governments and nations can't do more than one thing at once. Well, I<br />
mean, today we did about 5 things at once.<br />
J: Prime Minister, would you suggest from Senator Collins' comments<br />
about your help and assistance to get the package through a few of<br />
your cabinet ministers shared the same views of these failed<br />
newsletter writers..<br />
PM: No.<br />
BC: That's not, in fact, the case at all. It's just a fairly tough forum, Cabinet,<br />
and it is no matter what the submission is.<br />
PM: Well I mean, look, let me just tell you I've been around the fiscal<br />
game here nearly longer than anyone in the room and let me tell you </p>
<p>this the people writing this stuff have been arguing for the lowest<br />
deficits and the biggest surpluses for as long as I have known them,<br />
they have been arguing for the lowest wages, some with famous<br />
expressions like " the real wage overhang" while they themselves are<br />
taking massive wage overhangs, we all know them, and we are all sick<br />
to death of them.<br />
J: To overcome the reaction...<br />
BC: Well, if you're not going to talk about drought or farmers anymore, I<br />
might leave, actually.<br />
PM: Now look, we're not going around the sport about fiscal policy. I mean,<br />
have you got any other questions about this thing?<br />
J: Senator Collins, just looking at things is there any possibility there will<br />
be other areas other than Queensland and NSW that could move into,<br />
or become eligible, for this package?<br />
BC: Well, I think you would have to say only if the worst case scenario that<br />
the Met Bureau is forecasting comes to pass, and I hope that doesn't<br />
happen. On the forecasting that has been done so far, and let me tell<br />
you it's been extremely accurate to this point in time the weather<br />
bureau is predicting that there may not be significant easing of the<br />
situation across Australia until March next year. Now, if that is the<br />
case, and if there are drought-breaking useful rains at that time, this<br />
package will be sufficient. But should the worst happen, and the<br />
drought extend beyond that, the Prime minister has already indicated<br />
this assistance W~ ill follow. I might say that at that point in time, if the<br />
drought does extend for another full year beyond what we have<br />
already had, it will be a significant crisis at that point in time in any<br />
case.<br />
J: Can you point out areas where the... . that could be affected by that?<br />
BC: Oh, all that information is in fact freely available. In fact, I must say,<br />
it's been on the front pages of a great many newspapers for about 3<br />
weeks now. The Northern area of NSW and extensive areas of<br />
Queensland are really the worst hit. At this point in time, that's who<br />
this addresses, and there's no question that in respect of those areas<br />
they have now, at this point in time, experienced the worst drought on<br />
record. And I might add this is a literally, a week by week situation. If I<br />
can just give you an example of what I'm talking about we expected to<br />
harvest about 12.5 million tonnes of wheat nationally, down from the<br />
18 million tonnes last year. That would have been changed ad rain<br />
fallen a fortnight after that prediction was made. If we don't get rain in<br />
the next 2 weeks.. the next 2 weeks then the current 10 million tonnes<br />
will have to be down-graded again because of the crops that are in the </p>
<p>14<br />
ground now. So, it's a weekly situation, literally, so you can't make<br />
those kinds of predictions.<br />
PM: Can I just finish with this comment I'd like to, on behalf of Senator<br />
Collins and certainly myself, express my appreciation for the interest<br />
which the peak farm bodies have had in this, and for the consultation<br />
they have given us, for those people on the land who have generously<br />
given us of their time and their views. This is quite an important,<br />
indeed for social policy, revolutionary change in policy, and it extends<br />
principles that in the past outside of these circumstances, the<br />
Government has resisted. We've done it on this occasion thoughtfully,<br />
and in a way in which we think protects all the lines of policy, yet gives<br />
material and substantial relief when it matters, and where it matters.<br />
Thank you.<br />
ends. </p>
