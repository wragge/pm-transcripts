PUBLIC SERVICE RECRUITMENT<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies,<br />
announced today that amendments to the Public Service Act<br />
passed by Parliament in December, 1960 come into force today<br />
1lthi May, 1961. The alterations arose from the (..-vern~ ment's<br />
consideration of the recommendations of the Boyer Committee<br />
and the Prime Minister again acknowledged the valuable work<br />
done by the Committee in its comprehensive and constructive<br />
review of recruitment problems in the Commonwealth Service.<br />
Amendments to the Act now being brought into<br />
operation maintain the structure of the original Public<br />
Service Act, but in the light of current conditions place<br />
greater emphasis on qualifications roquired for appointrumt,<br />
give greater flexibility in recruitment procedures, and<br />
remove certain provisions experience has shown to be<br />
defective. Notable in the changes is the establishment of<br />
the Leaving Certificate as the firm minimum standard for<br />
entry to the Third Division of the Service.<br />
