FOR PRESS 13 NOVEMBER 1977<br />
JOINT COMMONWEALTH-STATE REVIEW OF THE ORD RIVER IRRIGATION AREA<br />
The Prime Minis-ter and the Premier of Western Australia announced<br />
today that a joint Commonwealth-State Review is to be established<br />
to report to both Governments on the future development of the<br />
Ord River Irrigation Area.<br />
The proposed Review has been the subject of discussion and<br />
correspondence between the Prime Minister and the Premier for some<br />
months,, and its purpose is to assist the Governments in considering<br />
the proper course of future development of the region and the<br />
role of Governments in that development.<br />
There will be an assessment of agricultural development and research<br />
in the region to date, and an assessment of further potential<br />
development in the medium and long term, having regard to future<br />
domestic and world markets for food, fibre and other commodities<br />
which have potential in the region.<br />
There will also be an assessment of the impact of development to<br />
date and of potential future development on activities adjacent<br />
to the area, on the environment, and on the Aboriginal community.<br />
Both Governments are interested in the future development of the<br />
region, and see the Review as providing a positive contribution<br />
to enable the direction of future development to be properly guided.<br />
The Chairman of the Review, who is still to be appointed, will be<br />
supported by officers from both the Commonwealth and State<br />
Governments. It is expected that the Review will take some six months from<br />
its establishment.<br />
Detailed terms of reference and arrangements for the Review are<br />
to be discussed between officials of the two Governments and will<br />
be announced as soon as possible. </p>
