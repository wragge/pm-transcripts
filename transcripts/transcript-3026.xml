SENIOR AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENTS<br />
The Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs,<br />
Mr Whitlam, announced today a number of senior appointments to<br />
Australian diplomatic missions overseas. He announced that<br />
Sir James Plimsoll, would become Australian Ambassador<br />
to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and that he would be<br />
succeeded as Ambassador to the United States by Sir Patrick<br />
Shaw, currently Australian High Commissioner to India<br />
and Australian Ambassador to Nepal. Sir Patrick Shaw would<br />
be succeeded in New Delhi by Mr Bruce Grant, who until recently<br />
has been Public Affairs Commentator for " The Age".<br />
Mr Whitlam also announced that Mr K. C. O. Shann, C. B. E.<br />
had been appointed Australian Ambassador to Japan to succeed<br />
the Honourable Gordon Freeth who would be retiring at the end<br />
of the year. Mr Shann has been Deputy Secretary of the<br />
Department of Foreign Affairs since 1970.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that all of these senior appointments<br />
had been made bearing in mind the Australian Government's desire<br />
to maintain close relations with the countries concerned.<br />
Sir James Plimsoll was a former Permanent Head of the Department<br />
of Foreign Affairs and had served with distinction as<br />
Ambassador to the United States. In his new appointment as<br />
Ambassador to the Soviet Union he would bring with him long<br />
experience in the conduct of Australian foreign policy.<br />
Australian relations with the Soviet Union had developed<br />
significantly in recent years and Sir James Plimsoll's<br />
appointment would enable this development to be maintained.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that he was confident that<br />
Sir Patrick Shaw's long experience as a senior officer of<br />
the Department of Foreign Affairs would serve him well in his<br />
new assignment to the United States. </p>

Mr Whitlam recalled the great emphasis which successive<br />
Australian Governments had placed on relations with the<br />
United States as he had himself reaffirmed during his recent<br />
visit to Washington. Mr Whitlam said that he was also confident that the<br />
appointment of Mr Bruce Grant to succeed Sir Patrick Shaw as<br />
Australian High Commissioner to India and Ambassador to Nepal<br />
would enable Australia to further develop its relations with<br />
one of' the most significant regions in the Asian continent.<br />
Mr Grant had in past years been one of Australia's best known<br />
commentators on Asian affairs and his international reputation<br />
in the area would be of great value in his new appointment.<br />
Mr Whitlam also paid tribute to the work of<br />
Mr K. C. O. Shann, C. B. E. as Deputy Secretary of the Department<br />
of Foreign Affairs of which he had also been Acting Secretary<br />
on a number of occasions. Mr Whitlam recalled in particular<br />
Mr Shann's period as Ambassador to Indonesia from 1962-1965,<br />
at which post at a particularly difficult time he had served<br />
with great distinction. Mr Whitlam said that he was looking<br />
forward to his forthcoming visit to Japan and that the appointment<br />
of Mr Shann to succeed Mr Freeth reflected the Government's<br />
desire further to consolidate mutual relations in a broad range<br />
of activities. Duhring the past few years Mr Shann had himself<br />
been closely involved with the development of Australia's<br />
relations with Japan.<br />
Mr Whitlam said he expected that Mr Grant would take<br />
up his appointment in November. The other three senior officers<br />
would take up their new appointments early in 1974.<br />
