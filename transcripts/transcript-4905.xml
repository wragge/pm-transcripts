PRESS OFFiCE TRANSCRIPT<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE ON MINISTERIAL CHANGES November 1978<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
The Ministerial changes that I have announced this afternoon<br />
are designed to achieve a better and a fairer workload between<br />
Ministers, but in particular they are designed to enable work<br />
in certain areas to expand arnd to respond to the changing needs<br />
of Government and of government service to the people of<br />
Australia. I<br />
Tony Street has had probably the hardest and the toughest<br />
workload of any Minister over recent times, and there have<br />
been very significant changes and improvements in Industrial<br />
Relations. In addition to that, over the last two to three<br />
years the training programmes have largely been introduced or<br />
very significantly expanided.<br />
So overall the responsibilities and the workload in that area<br />
have grown very greatly. There have been one or two areas,<br />
which you will see from the statement, where greater activity<br />
is needed in the industrial relations area. It i~ s a part of<br />
the activity that I know Tony Street has wanted to be more<br />
involved in, but under the-arrangements as they have existed up to<br />
the present that has not been possible.<br />
So much of the work of the industrial relations section of<br />
the old department was involved in a sense in putting out<br />
brtusft fires dealing with a dispute after it has arisen.<br />
What we want to do now is to build on the progress that has<br />
been made in reducing the number of disputes by getting out<br />
into industry where it is needed, working with labour and<br />
working with management at the national, the industry and<br />
at the factory level also, to do more to create the<br />
circumstances which will avoid disputes. There is room for<br />
much greater activity in that area, and the resources of the<br />
new Department of Industrial Relations will be expanded to<br />
enable it to undertake -that task.<br />
The concerns that we all have, that I know you have and that<br />
I certainly have, with unemployment also dictates the ' need<br />
to have a separate Depa-rtment of Employment and Youth Affairs.<br />
For some time there has been an Office of Youth Ar.-Ffairs<br />
attached to another Denartment, but the work of that office<br />
will again be expanded and will be more vigorous in pursuing<br />
its particular responsibilities.<br />
Ian Viner's task in this Department will be to monitor the<br />
programmes to see what changes might be required from time<br />
to time, to examine the many suggestions the new initiativesthat<br />
come to us, and to enable the Government to respond to the<br />
needs of Australian society and to the needs especially of young<br />
people within our community. To make sure that a senior / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
Minister is devoting his full time to these particular matters,<br />
which are of great importance to all of us.<br />
The other changes are not completely consequential upon these,<br />
but largely consequential. Senator Chaney will be moving to<br />
Aboriginal Affairs and the opportunity is being taken to place<br />
the particular parts of Environment, Housing and Community<br />
Development with other Departments where, in a sense, they have<br />
their natural home. Housing will be with construction, and<br />
the environment, for instance, and national parks services, will<br />
be established with the Department of Science, where it will be<br />
easier for the resources of CSIRO to work even more closely with<br />
those who have got direct responsibility for the protection of<br />
the environment.<br />
So I think those changes are natural and sensible ones. The<br />
number of Ministers stays the same, the number of Departaents,<br />
as a result of the changes in the area I have just spoken about,<br />
the environmental area, will also remain the same.<br />
Question: ( Laurie Power)<br />
Mr Fraser, did you think that Kr Street wasn't doing enough in<br />
the area of employment?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think Tony Street was doing as much, or more, as could be<br />
expected of any one Minister. The workload in industrial<br />
relations and the workload in the employment area, with the<br />
growth of the training prograeses, has expanded enormously,<br />
and I believe it was asking more than enough of any one<br />
Minister, and for that matter more than enough of any one<br />
Permanent Head. There will be two Permanent Heads and there<br />
will be two Ministers in relation to the two new Departments.<br />
Question: ( Laurie Power)<br />
It wasn't enough, as much as what you wanted, and you have<br />
created Prime Minister:<br />
I think you are putting an implication into the question which<br />
I think is quite unfair.<br />
Question: ( Duncan Fairweather)<br />
Did : Ir Street tell you that his workload was too great,<br />
Prime Minister, or was that your belief?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Tony Street is the sort of person who will undertake any<br />
task that is asked of him ancd will do it to the very best<br />
of his ability and put an enormous amount of time and effort<br />
into it. In discussing this concept he had indicated to me,<br />
in the preventive area that that was a part of the industrial<br />
relations arena, for example, that he would like to be more </p>
<p>-3<br />
active in, that the industrial relations part of the old<br />
Department would want to be more active in, but there just<br />
hadn't been an opportunity for that. The changes will enable<br />
that to occur, and enable the improvements in industrial<br />
relations over the last two or three years to be developped.<br />
further. There is a very significant change here. The Department of<br />
Industrial Relations, in a significant sense, not totally,<br />
has been a reactive Department. That's not a criticism, it's<br />
the way it has historically been. A dispute occurs and then<br />
you do something about it. To get out and promote even more<br />
actively than has been the case in the past,. the need for<br />
preventive arrangements to advocate practices and procedures<br />
between management and labour which avoid the possibility of<br />
industrial dispute is obviously a highly desirable and, in<br />
some areas I would think highly necessary.<br />
It is intended that the resources of the Department of<br />
Industrial Relations will be expanded quite specifically to<br />
enable greater attention to be given to that part of its<br />
role. Question: The appearance has been given that kir Street's role has been<br />
diminished in Government and in the Cabinet.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I don't think so at all. I think industrial relations is<br />
clearly of enormous importance to all of us. There are the<br />
consultative processes, the need for conciliation, for<br />
reconciliation, and then there is the question of the law,<br />
there has been development of the Industrial Relations Bureau,<br />
and in all of this area there is a very constant workload and<br />
a very constant effort required.<br />
It would be a very unreal Government that didn't respond to the<br />
changing needs of differing times, differing circumstances, and<br />
it's also plain over the last period that much greater time<br />
is involved in the employment area.<br />
If you like to go back to before the Labor time it was then<br />
almost a Department of Industrial Relations. It wasn't called<br />
that, but people didn't have the concern with employment, there<br />
weren't the training programmes, there wasn't the necessity for<br />
them, and the Commonwealth Employment Service didn't have the<br />
very great and heavy responsibilities that they now have.<br />
That demonstrates how some aspects of the role and the<br />
responsibilities have qrown over past years compared to what<br />
used to happen, for example, before 1972.<br />
Question: ( Peterson)<br />
Did you invite Mr Peacock to be part of these moves, and<br />
did he decline? </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I'm not going to make any comment on particular Ministers.<br />
Question: ( Peterson)<br />
on one who is not a Minister. Did you invite Senator Withers?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I'm not going to make any comment on members of the Senate<br />
or the House of Representatives. It's a good try, but I'm<br />
sure you wouldn't have expected any other answer.<br />
Question: Are you lessening the influence of Aboriginal Affairs within<br />
the Ministry or is Senator Chaney to be a Cabinet Minister?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, the numbers in the Cabinet and the members of the Cabinet<br />
will not be altered. But again, I think, it's a question of<br />
people very often who you have in Cabinet, and they sometimes<br />
take their portfolio with them into the Cabinet and they are<br />
often in Cabinet, in some cases obviously the Treasurer<br />
has to be in Cabinet and some other portfolios have to be in<br />
Cabinet but with a number of portfolios it depends upon the<br />
Minister and, as in Ian Viner's case, he wasn't in Cabinet, he<br />
carried Aboriginal A2ffairs with him into Cabinet, and I believe<br />
and I think the Department might believe and the Aboriginal<br />
people might believe that he has been one of the best Ministers<br />
if not the best Minister ever in that area.<br />
Let me only say that the fact that Senator Chaney is going to<br />
become minister for Aboriginal Affairs indicates the extehrt of<br />
confidence that I have in him to undertake a very important<br />
and very sensitive task.<br />
Question: ( Peterson)<br />
Do you see him beinq able to better take on Joh Bjelke-Petersen?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
That's a question of the Media looking for confrontation to<br />
make a better story.<br />
Question: ( Laurie Power)<br />
Mr Fraser, with your increased emphasis on e-ployment generations,<br />
splitting a portfolio what are you going to do to match NSW?<br />
Prime minister:<br />
I don't know if a r generation", in one sense concern for employment<br />
and for those who want jobs and find it difficult to get work </p>
<p>5<br />
is the way i would like to have it out and understood. I was<br />
interested to see Mr Wran's initiatives last night, and lookina<br />
at his words closely it seemed to me that he was taking<br />
advantage of the Special Youth Employment Training Scheme and<br />
I think, as you know, this does apply to people who do find<br />
work. That scheme applies to people who have been out of<br />
work for four months and then go into work in private employment<br />
or in Government departments. In reading the statement and<br />
listening to Ir Wran it seemed to me that he was taking<br />
advantage of the Special Youth Employment Training Scheme to<br />
make more zlaces available within the public service of NSW<br />
for young people to fit the Special Youth Employment Training<br />
Programme. I'm very glad that he is finding it possible to<br />
give greater weight to that particular Commonwealth initiative.<br />
I think all the States do provide places in their own public<br />
services. VMr Wran has chosen a good time to expand the number<br />
of places available in the NSW public service under the Special<br />
Youth Emolo--rment Training Scheme previously initiated by<br />
Tony Street.<br />
Question: ( Peterson)<br />
Are you an admirer of Mr Wran?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Mr Wran is a very capable politician.<br />
Question:<br />
Will Mr Street and Mr Viner maintain their respective ranking<br />
in Cabinet?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
There will be no changes in Ministerial ranking orders.<br />
Question: Prime Minister. has your decision to boost the role of Employment<br />
been prompted by the gloomy predictions of unemployment for<br />
next year and the possible political implications of those<br />
on the next Federal election?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, not prompted by that at all, but in examining the workload<br />
and the structure of Government and the structure of Departments<br />
I had come to the view that there was a need to achieve a more<br />
even workload and also to put in this area two Ministers into<br />
the field who can both very capably and forcefully argue the<br />
Government's policies and approach in relation to it and at<br />
the same tLme give full-time Ministerial attention, one in the<br />
industrial relations arena and the other in employment and in<br />
/ 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
relation to the Office of Youth Affairs, whose role will also<br />
be significantly expanded. Again, I think this is a response<br />
to the changing needs of the community and the changing<br />
perceptions of ' the importance of different aspects of Government.<br />
Question: ( Duncan Fairweather)<br />
The split between industrial relations and employment, will<br />
that be a straight split down the middle of the Department<br />
or do you envisage that either side will be bigger than the<br />
whole that it is at the moment.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
The Industrial Relations Department is going to have expanded<br />
responsibilities, I've already mentioned that.<br />
Question: ( Tony Walker)<br />
Expanded staff?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It will need some additional human resources to undertake<br />
the additional tasks that are required. Yes it will.<br />
Question: ( Malcolm Colless)<br />
Maybe they could take some people from the IRB.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well the rest of that Act has just been proclaimed, or a<br />
major part of it. The regulations in relation to union<br />
accounts haven't yet been proclaimed, but they are under<br />
examination in the National Labour Consultative Committee,<br />
and I hope it tvon't be too long before they also are<br />
proclaimed. I think it has been necessary for the work of<br />
the Industrial Relations Bureau to begin slowly. It was<br />
necessary to build up a staff of appropriate quality and<br />
calibre to meet again the * very sensitive requirements of the<br />
Bureau. I think it is worth noting that the Industrial<br />
Relations Bureau and its work is being followed very very<br />
closely in a number of countries. It is an Australian<br />
initiative and the importance of it, and its possibilities<br />
I think, can in part be judged from the fact that the<br />
Director of the Industrial Relations Bureau, Des Linehan,<br />
was pleased to take that job, and ha-ving a mind to his<br />
own industrial background, I think, says something for<br />
the initiative. But it has been doing its work, doesn't<br />
seek to be obtrusive. I believe it will be a very effective<br />
Bureau and somet--hing that is worth watching. </p>
