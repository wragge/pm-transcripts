DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED<br />
STATS OF AMERICA<br />
Agreed Statement issued by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
and President Lyndon B. Johnson<br />
During the morning the Prime Minister and senior members<br />
of the Ministry have had discussions with President Johnson onmatters of<br />
maj or current concern to the two countries.<br />
It has been helpful both to the Australian Ministers and to the<br />
President to have this opportunity to take further and in person the cort inuing<br />
exchange of views between the two Governments on these matters.<br />
The discussion concentrated on the problems of Asia, and<br />
particularly the problems of Viet Nam. It was agreed that the military<br />
position in Viet Nam was now demonstrably such that North Viet Nam could<br />
achieve no military victory. It was, however, clearly recognised that it<br />
would be necessary firmly to maintain the present military effort until a<br />
satisfactory settlement could be negotiated. The fighting could only end<br />
when it was clear that the great issues at stake had been secured.<br />
The President expressed warm appreciation for the efforts of<br />
the Australian forces in Viet Nam.<br />
In the light of the improved military outlook, the prospects for<br />
a Ipeaceful settlement in Viet Nam, and for its social and economic development,<br />
were examined in some detail, and in preparation for the Manila Conference<br />
due to commence on Monday, October 24. It was agreed that this conference<br />
would hear a review of the continuing military situation and prospects but<br />
would concentrate most of its attention to considering how conditions could best<br />
be established and secured for the future peaceful development of Viet Nam<br />
and of Asia generally. The longer term prospects for the future of Asia were also<br />
considered. There was on both sides an expression of continuing concern<br />
for the wellbeing of the nations and peoples of Asia, and an emphasis on the<br />
urgency of bringing about conditions favourable to rapid economic and social<br />
advancement. The return of peace to the region will provide an opportunity<br />
to expand and improve the effectiveness of the efforts now being made to this<br />
end. The recent efforts by Asian nations to increase their co-opera-.<br />
tion amongst themselves in economic and political fields were reviewed. It<br />
was agreed that these efforts by the nations of the region, to take a larger<br />
hand in shaping their own destiny by co-operation, represented a most hopeful<br />
and practical development which would continue to command the support of<br />
our two governments.<br />
