TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
START OF THE WESTFIELD FRED HOLLOWS 500 INTERNATIONAL<br />
RELAY RACE, BOURKE, WEDNESDAY, 5 APRIL 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
I am delighted to be in Bourke, it is one of the few places in the far west of<br />
New South Wales I always wanted to see, but somehow never got around to<br />
it. I have today and what a lovely day it is too.<br />
Could I say what a double pleasure it is being here associated with the spirit<br />
of Fred Hollows. We look at the town of Bourke which has been riven by the<br />
drought, where it has had to try to fight its way back. With all of its troubles it<br />
has still got a big enough heart to do something like this, sponsor this race,<br />
and to remember again Fred Hollows.<br />
It is a great pleasure to be here with Gabi because, I think, the Hollows<br />
Foundation typifies the thing that Fred was really great at and that is getting<br />
on with it. He was unconventional and practical, but he got the job done and,<br />
of course, we have another great challenge in Australia and that is, of course,<br />
with Aboriginal health and a lot of the spirit of what Fred was about we want<br />
to employ in dealing with that problem. That is direct attention to the problem<br />
at hand. So, I think, that is a celebration of what Fred was able to do and<br />
what now Gabi and Mike Lynskey and the Foundation have been able to<br />
follow up. That is why we are here to support the run and to also remember<br />
that international fraternalism that Fred sponsored in Nepal, in Vietnam and<br />
in Eritrea and, of course, we have some runners here from Nepal and Eritrea<br />
and Vietnam on this occasion today all three countries represented.<br />
So, it is a great chance to renew that international fraternity, I think, that Fred<br />
sponsored and to come to the place where Fred wanted his ashes scattered.<br />
I know Bourke takes that responsibility, as the Mayor said, very seriously and<br />
it is a great pleasure for me to be here, to be part of that fraternal spirit, part<br />
of the spirit of Bourke and part of the spirit of Fred Hollows. I would like to<br />
thank the Mayor, Wally Mitchell, and Frank Lowy from Westfield for<br />
sponsoring this and it is a great pleasure for me to be associated, again, with<br />
Fred Hollows and Gabi Hollows who has followed Fred's vision and work with<br />
great fidelity.<br />
Thank you very much indeed. </p>
