    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>TuesdayÂ 22 SeptemberÂ 1992</strong></p>
<p>I am delighted to have this opportunity to appear before the Japan NationalÂ Press Club.</p>
<p>This is the second time I have addressed this distinguished forum. I held a pressÂ conference here in 1986 during the first of three visits I made to Japan asÂ Australian Treasurer.</p>
<p>In my opening remarks today, I should like to offer some observations from anÂ Australian perspective on the process of far-reaching change now occurring inÂ the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>I shall also explain how I see thc Australia-Japan relationship fitting into thisÂ wider context.</p>
<p>The timing of my visit to Japan is most opportune, considering the character ofÂ the strategic and international economic policy issues now facing Australia,Â Japan and our regional partners.</p>
<p>The centre-piece of my program here in Tokyo is, of course, the extensive<br />discussions I had yesterday afternoon and last evening with Prime Minister<br />Miyazawa. My talks with Mr Miyazawa complement very nicely discussions I had earlier<br />this year with two other key regional leaders President Bush of the United<br />States and President Soeharto of Indonesia.</p>
<p>As you know, President Bush visited Japan after his visit to Australia last<br />January, and Presidcnt Socharto will visit Japan next week.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Miyazawa also made an important visit to Washington last July.Â An active process of heads-of-government diplomacy is entirely appropriateÂ given the increasing degree of fluidity which now confronts us in regional<br />affairs. The end of the Cold War has brought about a revolutionary era in internationalÂ relations. The most dramatic changes are those we are witnessing in Europe, andÂ throughout the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>But it is also important to acknowledge that, in the Asia-Pacific region, weÂ have entered a period of transition which presents regional governments withÂ major policy challenges.</p>
<p>In strategic terms, the outlook is generally favourable, albeit loss predictableÂ than it has been.</p>
<p>Althoush Russia retains formidablc military assets, its pasture towards theÂ region is now much more benign than in any period wc have known throughoutÂ the post-war period.</p>
<p>The Australian and Japanese Governments both welcome an improvedÂ diplomatic environment on and surrounding the Korean PeninsulaÂ the normalisation of Russia-China relationsÂ an improvement in China-Vietnam relationsÂ and the opportunity we now have despite all the recent difficulties toÂ he) thepeoleof Cambodia begin a process of national reconciliationÂ an~ rehbilittion.</p>
<p>Against the background of these positive developments, I discussed with PrimeÂ Minister Miyazawa two important subjects.</p>
<p>First, we reaffirmed the view of our Governments that long -term strategicÂ engagement in the Western Pacific by the United States is fndamental to theÂ maintenancc of aÂ stablc sccurity environment.-Â We agreed that Australia's and Japan's separate alliances with the United StatesÂ each make a significant contribution to wider regional stability.Â </p>
<p>Secondly, Prime Minister Miy azawa explaincd to me Japan's aspirations to play<br />a more active international role particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.<br />Australia welcomes a more active Japanese role in international and regional<br />affairs. We see that as a natural feature of an evolving regional scenc, wherc the<br />countries of the Western Pacific translate economic dynamism into increasing<br />collective weight in world affairs.<br />We are confident that Japan's international role will develop constructively, and<br />in ways that receive increasing legitimacy from both the Japanesc public and<br />other countries in the region.<br />I told the Prime Ministcr that Australia welcomes Japan's willingness to<br />participate in United Nations peace-kceping activities.<br />The Australian Government is pleased that Australian and Japanese military<br />and civilian personncl will be working together in theUnitedNations<br />Transitional Authority in Cambodia.<br />We should like this to be a model of the ways Australia and Japan can, where<br />feasible, join forces diplomatically to help resolve regional disputes.<br />These matters of foreign policy are important.<br />9O/ ZOd ST0' ON L Z~ 6 daS :-11331</p>
<p>Generally they reflect a continuation of our existing policies.<br />I think that so long as we can be reasonably confident of a favourable strategic<br />outlook, the single most demanding international question facing regional<br />governments is trade policy.<br />It is now a high-policy matter of first priority.<br />We all have a lot at stake in this issue.<br />It so directly affects our future prosperity.<br />Put simply, regional governments need to decide what nature of trade<br />alignments and arrangements we want to operate in the Asia-Pacific region as<br />we move towards the twenty-first century.<br />I know some commentators belicve that the multilateral trading system could<br />easily degenerate into three competitive blocs comprising the EC, the Americas<br />and an East Asian group led by Japan.<br />The progressive globalisation of trade and investment flows militates, I think,<br />against an outcome of this kind.<br />It is also instructive to note that, for all the intensity of economic interchange<br />within East Asia, the United States is still the biggest export market for most<br />East Asian economics including Japan, South Kbrea and Taiwan.<br />But, even with a successful outcome of the Uruguay Round of multinational<br />trade negotiations, there could well still be-an increasing endency towards<br />bilateral, subregional, and regional trade arrangements.<br />The North American Free Trade Agrment linking the United States, Canada<br />and -Mexico is n iib iitii-nga rcat iy.<br />The United States is interested in concluding bilateral free trade arrangements<br />with countries in Latin America and clscwhere.<br />In South-East Asia, the ASEAN countries are committed to establish their own<br />free trade arrangement.<br />What should Australia and Japan make of these developments?<br />In my discussions with Prime Minister Mi yazawa, we reaffirmed the crucial<br />interest that Australia and Japan share in the maintenance of an open, nondiscriminatory,<br />multilateral trade system.<br />Both our Governments accord high priority to an early and successful outcome<br />of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations.<br />We accept that free trade agreements have the potential to bring benefits to both<br />their members and external trading partners.</p>
<p>But we emphasised the view recorded in our joint press statement that such<br />arrangements should be open, consistent with GAIT, and contribute to<br />expansion of the world economy without hurting the interests of third countries.Â <br />I attach importance to this seemingly straightforward coincidence of view Â because it means, in practice, that we should not encourage subgroups in theÂ Asia-Pacific region which acquire an inward-looking or exclusive character.<br />Prime Minister Miyazawa and I also underlined our support for Asia-PacificÂ Economic Cooperation ( APEC) as an essential mechanism for promoting open<br />regionalism. We welcome the commitment made at the recent Bangkok Ministerial meeting<br />to promote APEC's trade-liberalising role.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting policy challenges now facing the region is deciding<br />what can and should be done to ensure that international and regional<br />institutions better reflect the growing weight of the Asia-Paci fR region in<br />world affairs.</p>
<p>I personally think that APEC has great potential in this regard.<br />The organisation not only embraces the main economic linkages betccn the<br />Western Pacific and North America.</p>
<p>It also provides a benign framework in which the world's two largest national<br />economies the United States and Japan can harmonise their approaches to<br />regional economic issues.</p>
<p>The notion that there should be periodic heads-of-government meetings based<br />on APEC membership is a good one.</p>
<p>Such meetings would fill a conspicuous gap in regional relations.<br />They would also invest APEC with greater political weight and status.<br />I have been encouraged by the reactions so far to this proposal, including from<br />Prime Minister Miyazawa.</p>
<p>I believe it is a proposal which, if advanced carefully over the medium term and<br />with thorough consultations on the specific details, will bring a beneficial<br />cohcrence to the region.</p>
<p>I should also say something about Australia's credentials for playing an active<br />role in the future affairs of the Asia-Pacific region.<br />One of the points I want to stress is that Australia's bilateral relationship with<br />Japan is a key element in the network of economic interdependence which has<br />brought such benefits to the Western Pacific.<br />Last year, Australia-Japan two-way trade was worth almost 20 billion US<br />dollars. Japan has been Australia's largest trading partner for many years.<br />In 1991, Australia was Japan's sixth largest trading partner, and third largest<br />source of imports.</p>
<p>The relationship is mature and longstanding.<br />In the 1960s and 1970s, Australia came to occupy a key position as a supplier to<br />Japan of industrial raw materials and cnergy.</p>
<p>Japan's decision to source its raw material inputs from the most commercially<br />competitive foreign suppliers was one of strategic importance for both our<br />countries. Australia developed a close relationship with Japan's steel-making and powergenerating<br />industries which themselves played a central role in Japan's<br />remarkable indUStri21 expansion.</p>
<p>And Australia's economic development benefited greatly as a result.<br />These days the economic relationship has diversified well beyond the<br />traditional trade in farm products and minerals and energy.<br />Later today, before a senior business audiene, I shall explain Australia's<br />achievements in making our economy more competitive and internationally<br />oriented, and our determination to go much further with this process.<br />Australia now exports a pproximately 23 per cent of its total output compared<br />with 14 per cent in 1983.</p>
<p>A shift to exports of 9 per cent of GDP is truly a landmark change.<br />As part of this transition, we are now the tenth biggest supplier of manufactures<br />to Japan ahead of Canada, Hong Kong and all o[ ft he AS EAN countrics.<br />The economic relationship with Japan has also shown exciting growth in<br />relativcly new areas such as tourism, supplying LNG, and Australian exports of<br />high-technology items suh as computer software and medical equipment.</p>
<p>A well--establiqhed economic relationship has provided a secure basis for the<br />Australian and Japanese Governments to develop an active dialogue on a wide<br />range of international and regional issues of shared concern.<br />Japan's position as the leading country in the Western Pacific region is beyond<br />challenge.</p>
<p>Australia's credentials in the region largely derive from its institutional stability,<br />its sole tenancy of a continent, the strength of its economic relations with<br />reginal neihours, most notably Japan. and many of the developing countries<br />ofEst Asia.</p>
<p>Australia has demonstrated -the contributions it can make to regional diplomacy<br />on issues such as Cambodia and the establishment of APEC.<br />Within Australia itself there is increasing interest and confidence in our national<br />identity, an increasing willingness to confront the new challenges we face as a<br />nation, and increasing understanding that many of those challenges are<br />substantially related to our placc in the Asia-Pacific region.<br />Much more than ever before, Australians are now conscious of their place in the<br />Asia-Pacific.</p>
<p>In this, our view of the region, Japan has a central position.<br />It is apginst this background that I have come to Japan to develop an even closer<br />working relationship with Prime Minister Miyazawa and his Govermecnt.<br />I am most satisfied with the quality and substance of our discussions yesterday.<br />Â </p>
<p>T'hey have helped Australia psition itself to make optimum responses to theÂ pro fund changes now unfolding in the region.Â Having made these opening remarks, I am happy to respond to your questions.<br />Â </p>
