PRIME MINISTER<br />
Presidents Cup<br />
One of the world's most prestigious golf events, The Presidents Cup, is to<br />
be held in Australia in 1998.<br />
The decision by the PGA Tour announced today will be welcomed by<br />
sporting fans around the nation.<br />
It has been my privilege to accept the post of honorary chairman of the<br />
event in Australia.<br />
The event has created world wide interest since the inaugural Presidents<br />
Cup in 1994 which was won by the United States. The US retained the<br />
title in a tightly fought contest in September this year.<br />
The Cup will showcase Australia to an international audience and will be<br />
an important event in the lead up to the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.<br />
Some of the world's most talented players will compete for the<br />
International and U. S. teams with Australian charities benefiting from the<br />
proceeds of the event.<br />
The venue for the event in Australia is yet to be decided but the captains of<br />
both the International and United States teams are expected to be<br />
announced in the New Year.<br />
Australia is the first nation to host the event outside the United States and<br />
has been chosen because of our strong representation in past international<br />
teams. 19 December 1996<br />
