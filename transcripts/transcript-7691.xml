TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH PAUL BONGIORNO, RAAF BASE,<br />
FAIRBAIRN, 26 JULY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what is the importance of<br />
today's multicultural agenda?<br />
P14: Well the importance for all Australians is that it will<br />
do two things. It's about social justice. That is ensuring<br />
that all Australians, irrespective of their background, they<br />
shall have equal access to the resources of government and<br />
equal opportunity to develop themselves within Australia.<br />
But also it's important for all Australians whether they<br />
are of recent or relatively recent arrival or not in that<br />
it has a fundamental economic theme. We want to ensure that<br />
we are able as a community to tap into the resources of all<br />
Australians. For instance, we have suffered as a nation<br />
very considerable loss over the years because of inadequate<br />
recognition of skills, professional and trade skills, of<br />
people who have come here. The national agenda will be<br />
addressing specific proposals to ensure that we better tap<br />
into those provisions.<br />
JOURNALIST: What would you say to cynics who are suggesting<br />
that it's another vote-grabbing exercise?<br />
PM: Absolute bloody nonsense. I started this two years<br />
ago, even before the last election. I was getting people<br />
together to say that I wanted a national multicultural<br />
agenda. I established, as I say, two years ago the<br />
processes to produce this outcome in saying that I wanted<br />
the agenda by the middle of 1989. So the processes were<br />
started even before the last election. Cynicism gets a bit<br />
boring you know.<br />
