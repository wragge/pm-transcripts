TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PAUL MURPHY, DATELINE, SBS<br />
28 JULY 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Prime Minister, thanks very much for talking to Dateline.<br />
PJK: Thanks, Paul, nice to be here.<br />
PM: Reaction to last night's Cabinet decision on aspects of your Mabo<br />
deliberations isn't promising. The Aborigines are quite disappointed<br />
and so are the miners. Now how do you bring with you these key<br />
interest groups?<br />
PJK: I think that the bulk of members of the Aboriginal and Islander<br />
community with, I think, a balanced view of this, it is even an ambitious<br />
view, would think that what the Cabinet decided yesterday was a fairly<br />
substantial move in the direction in which they had been arguing, that<br />
was for a right to be consulted, a right to negotiate, and even though<br />
some representatives today have gone through a ritual, nothing is<br />
quite good enough for us line, the thing to do, Paul, is don't believe<br />
that is representative of the broad Aboriginal community. Because I<br />
don't think it is.<br />
PM: So you are saying that the wider Aboriginal community, when they get<br />
to know about this, will like it?<br />
PJK: I think that is very much true. From the contact I have had with<br />
members of the Aboriginal community, I think ever one of them<br />
understood that a generalised veto was never on, that the Government<br />
would never agree that all land management in Australia would be<br />
subject, that is l -and management in respect of native title land, would<br />
be subject to a generalised veto, that was pretty well known from the<br />
start. The job was before the Aboriginal community, and islander<br />
community, to convince the Government that the special attachment<br />
they had to the land was such that they deserved a right of<br />
/ Td OO* N NO: 6 c6I1nC6Z : 131 </p>
<p>consultation and negotiation. Now, it is largely and broadly that which<br />
the Cabinet decided yesterday.<br />
PM: But that as you rightly say, obviously it fallIs far short of veto, but I am<br />
wondering exactly what it gives them really, negotiation?<br />
PJK: Well what it means is that if someone wants to develop an economic<br />
interest, the State land manager, a mines Minister, or a lands Minister<br />
wants to issue a grant of issue over that land where formerly, before<br />
yesterday, under any of our proposals, that could be done, they now<br />
have to consult with the Aboriginal community, there can then be a<br />
negotiation, and then it would go to the tribunal. The -tribunal -will then<br />
conduct an inquiry and say yay, or nay.<br />
PM: Now these are State tribunals, are they? Or is there an overriding<br />
Commonwealth one?<br />
PJK: Well it would be a State tribunal where a State tribunal was operating<br />
in the State. But if the principles of the tribunal, or its personnel are<br />
not up to the Commonwealth standard then the Commonwealth<br />
tribunal would operate in a designated State. So, the override would<br />
onily exist for the approved tribunal. So, it would be the<br />
Commonwealth tribunal for Commonwealth lands, it would be the<br />
Commonwealth tribunal if it operated in a particular State, but if a State<br />
tribunal were operating appropriately and properly in a particular State<br />
then that Government would have the override,<br />
PM: That Government would have the override? And that means you need<br />
complementary legislation, doesn't it, will you get it?<br />
PJK: Well I think we will. At any rate there needs to be State legislation in<br />
respect of validation of titles from the period 1975-93 anyway. But if<br />
there isn't satisfactory State attitudes and legislation, satisfactory to<br />
the Commonwealth, then the Commonwealth tribunal would operate in<br />
the State where we, the Commonwealth Government, designated to<br />
operate. So, in other words if a State actually brought the standard of<br />
their policy up to the Commonwealth standard their tribunal would<br />
operate and therefore their Government would have then the right to<br />
override a decision of the tribunal.<br />
PM: But if they don't, then what happens? Does Canberra override?<br />
PJK: If they don't, well let's say that there was a development purpose which<br />
the tribunal said no to, the State would have the option of overriding it,<br />
if it didn't, well, we will just have to argue that out in the public debate.<br />
I think the important thing is, Paul, that once a tribunal does take all<br />
the various information into account about the importance of the site to<br />
Aboriginal people, the prospects of development, that which is<br />
proposed for the development and comes to a decision after a period<br />
/ Z0Od ZOO* ON œ 0: 6 5IT1n[ 3* z3 </p>
<p>of months, probably six months, then it will not be an easy matter for a<br />
Government to just come and dismiss all that and override it. In other<br />
words there would have to be weight and moment and circumstance on<br />
the part of a Government, in the hand of a Government, to be able to<br />
override such a tribunal.<br />
PM: Well, Prime Minister, obviously this means that you have still got to<br />
come to an agreement with the State Premiers, you failed to do that at<br />
COAG in Melbourne, are you going to try and do that again with<br />
haste?<br />
PJK Well we are still speaking to them bilaterally, and we are refining these<br />
various principles and we are now in a position to know where we are<br />
trying to get bottom lines, if you like, in the Commonwealth Bill which<br />
we will then take back to them. Now, I should imagine this structure,<br />
States would see an advantage in having their tribunal, as distinct from<br />
the Commonwealth tribunal, being the designated tribunal for a<br />
particular State and therefore that Government preserving the override.<br />
provision. I should imagine that Stat es would find this as an incentive<br />
to cooperate in the scheme.<br />
PM: As I understand the decision last night, the Commonwealth and the<br />
States can override a tribunal decision if it seems to be against the<br />
national interest. Now that means that, for instance, Richard Court<br />
and JeffKennett can do that.<br />
PJK No, they can't. Only if the tribunal which operates in Western Australia<br />
and Victoria, in the instances you mentioned, were to be the State<br />
tribunals. But Commonwealth legislation has precedence and in the<br />
event that Western Australia had a tribunal which didn't do the things<br />
we believe it should do, we would designate the Commonwealth<br />
tribunal to be the operating designated tribunal, and we then the<br />
Commonwealth Government would have the override not Western<br />
Australia.<br />
PM: Ok, it sounds very complex, obviously, are you going to have trouble<br />
selling this, this agreement you reached last night?<br />
PJK Well I think the people in these negotiations understand this, the<br />
Aboriginal community understand that from a position where they had<br />
virtually no right of consultation and negotiation, they now have one.<br />
They have one where they can appeal their views to a tribunal where<br />
an arbitration process can take place. They never had that before<br />
yesterday and of course, the government state or federal as the<br />
case may be would have the effective override. The states would<br />
understand that clearly and they would also understand very clearly<br />
that if their tribunal, in other words if they co-operate and their tribunal<br />
is the designated one then their government gets the override. If they<br />
OO* ON 20: 6 œ 6 6 31 </p>
<p>don't co-operate the Commonwealth tribunal will be the designated<br />
one and it gets the override.<br />
PM: Prime Minister, do you think that you can salvage the character, this<br />
whole matter since the Mabo decision by the High Court became a<br />
debate as it were. Can yoj6u salvage this from being a PR disaster,<br />
because it looks painfully like that at the moment?<br />
PJK: Paul, people have got to understand the size of this decision. In most<br />
countries were a supreme court to say that native customs and law<br />
were part of the common law of the country and that there is a native<br />
title in the common law, many countries would take a decade getting<br />
out of such a large change. We are moving this huge decision and<br />
developing a body of administrative law to make it work. The problem<br />
is developing the structure to make it work. We are just developing<br />
this now with great expedition, it may be that in the couple of weeks or<br />
months that this has been going people are having some difficulty<br />
following the trail, but it is so complex and it is such a large change<br />
that the way in which the Cabinet worked yesterday seven hours of<br />
detailed consideration in a policy sense which would do the Cabinet<br />
proud in any circumstance. Any Cabinet in the world I don't think<br />
would be advancing this kind of technical and social issue at this<br />
speed.<br />
PM: How do you get back business confidence. The miners said today it<br />
was unworkable, the decision last night. How do you get back<br />
confidence and how quickly can you do that so that investment, profits<br />
are flowing?<br />
PJK The mining industry and its lobby organisation will always make its<br />
case, but there are similar provisions in state land rights legislation<br />
around the country. They would not say that is unworkable, they are<br />
not entitled to say of this that this is unworkable, but they will make<br />
their bald statements just as some Aboriginal representatives will make<br />
bald statements too.<br />
PMV: Sure.<br />
PJK: Where is the weight and truth of the matter? Answer:-not far below<br />
the surface.<br />
PM: Prime Minister, if I can move on to the republic, another agenda which<br />
you still prosecute with great vigour. Mr Hawke said that perhaps the<br />
states in the fullness of time should be a bolished. Is that helpful<br />
inducing that into the whole debate about a republic?<br />
PJK: 1 I do not see a relationship between that and the republic and that is<br />
why none of that was reflected in the terms of reference for Mr<br />
Turnbull's committee and it is why in the prosecution of this issue the<br />
/ t7O~ d ZOO* ON N: 6 226~ mI nC 67,31 </p>
<p>Government will not be relying upon this argument. The principal fact<br />
of the matter is that Australia is a unique place, it is entitled to<br />
represent itself both internally and externally as a country in charge of<br />
its own affairs and that means that there should be as our head of<br />
state an Australian person. That is the key issue how we see<br />
ourselves and we represent ourselves.<br />
PM: Elected by the people?<br />
PJK: That is a matter for discussion. As we expect that is one of the terms<br />
of reference that the Government has given Mr Turnbull and his<br />
committee and they will come back to us on these subjects.<br />
PM: Right, would you personally favour that though?<br />
PJK: I think I would rather wait and see. If you ask me the question and<br />
people say what can be more democratic than the election by the<br />
public at large of a head of state; and the answer is the election of a<br />
representative chamber by the same public. I always believe the<br />
greater the numbers, the closer parliamentary representatives get to<br />
their particuar localities in the communities th e more essentially<br />
democratic is the structure.<br />
PM: OK. if I can just go onto other matters CPI figures out today, not a<br />
bad result. Do you think now interest rates should be cut?<br />
PJK: It is a very good result Paul, at .4 per cent, 1.9 for the year. I was an<br />
adolescent when these numbers were around last in the 1 960s and it<br />
is another one of these things which the public debate has put in its<br />
pocket particularly the media. A few years ago I never heard anything<br />
but inflation. I would get up at a press conference and say we have<br />
had very high employment numbers again for the month, 90,000 of<br />
yeah, yeah, but what about inflation? And I would say inflation -is<br />
coming down, anyway inflation is now down.<br />
PM: Sure.<br />
PJK: It is broken, what I call snapping the inflation stick, it has taken us two<br />
decades to do it.<br />
PM: OK and you have done it.<br />
PJK: We have done it.<br />
PM: So what about interest rates coming down yet again?<br />
PJK. As I said the other day, low inflation does give us scope; that is<br />
continually low inflation and the maintenance of it, does give us scope<br />
to bring down interest rates scope. But again it is a matter of the<br />
)/ SOd zoo* </p>
<p>ambience and the climate at the time Paul. That is, what other rates<br />
prevail in other countries and these require judgements and mature<br />
ones by the Central Bank with the Treasurer to see whether we think<br />
we can lower our margin on which we pay the world and pay domestic<br />
savers the savings.<br />
PM: Prime Minister a final question on foreign affairs. Should the Isra el is<br />
stop shelling and bombing southern Lebanon right now before they<br />
destroy the peace talks completely?<br />
PJK I think Israel is entitled to be concerned about its security position, but<br />
again the quicker that we can see a withdrawal of Israeli forces from<br />
southern Lebanon the better and I think the key here is restraint by all<br />
the parties so that we don't see more bloodshed, more angst and<br />
therefore an ongoing problem.<br />
PM: A permanent withdrawal do you think of those forces. Not to try it on<br />
again?<br />
PJI( These are judgements obviously the Israelis would make, they are<br />
probably different judgements than we would make on these sorts of<br />
incursions.<br />
PMV: OK Prime Minister thank you very much indeed for speaking to us.<br />
PJK-Thank you.<br />
