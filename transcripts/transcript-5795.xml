FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 16 APRIL-1-982<br />
NEW ANGLICAN PRIMATE<br />
The Prime Minister today sent the following-message to the<br />
new Anglican Primate of Australia:<br />
" Your Grace,<br />
My warmest congratulations on your election as Primtate<br />
of the Anglican Church of Australia.<br />
You have already excelled in various leadership positions<br />
in your Church in widely dispersed parts of Australia.<br />
The highly acclaimed new Australian Prayer Book was<br />
produced by the Liturgical Commission under your<br />
Chairmanship. The high regard in which you are held throughout<br />
Australia combined with your concern for disadvantaged<br />
people and a strong but unassuming leadership should<br />
be of considerable value to you as Primate. I am sure<br />
that under your leadership the Anglican Church will<br />
continue to be a valuable influence in our society<br />
in the years ahead.<br />
I wish you every success." </p>
