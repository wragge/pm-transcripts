    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..............................................................................................</p>
<p>Well thank you very much Kay, to your husband David, to Bob Carroll,</p>
<p>   the State President of the Queensland Liberal Party. To the other</p>
<p>   distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. </p>
<p>It is always challenging to come to Kay Elson's electorate,</p>
<p>   to be reminded of a really energetic community-based, publicly spirited,</p>
<p>   really dedicated local Member of Parliament is all about. I've</p>
<p>   seen a lot of members of Parliament in the 24 years that I've</p>
<p>   been in the house but I don't think I've seen anybody</p>
<p>   so instinctively take to the responsibility of representing her</p>
<p>   constituents in a short period of time as has Kay Elson. Not only</p>
<p>   is she an indefatigable worker for the local community, she also</p>
<p>   produces in my view the best newsletters of any Federal Member of</p>
<p>   Parliament. She's really got them down to an art form, and</p>
<p>   she's put together this crowd in a short period of five days</p>
<p>   and I said to her that I wouldn't give her the luxury ever</p>
<p>   of longer notice but she really is an ornament to the concept of</p>
<p>   local, effective, local parliamentary representation, and she is</p>
<p>   somebody who is ideally suited to represent an electorate as diverse</p>
<p>   as the electorate of Forde, ideally suited to represent an electorate</p>
<p>   that has some of the more difficult areas of social challenge in</p>
<p>   our society as well as people who are in more comfortable circumstances.</p>
<p>   So Kay, in every way I am delighted to be with you and I would like</p>
<p>   very much to congratulate you on the job that you have done for</p>
<p>   the Liberal Party and the job that you have done for the electorate</p>
<p>   of Forde.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, there are many things that I could talk to</p>
<p>   you about today, but I want to focus on the task that is ahead of</p>
<p>   us in Australia and also the task that is ahead of us as the Liberal</p>
<p>   Party, as the government of Australia. We have over the last two-and-a-quarter</p>
<p>   years set about putting Australia in a stronger economic position</p>
<p>   and also endeavoured to respond to some of the non-economic challenges</p>
<p>   that the Government faced when it came into power in March 1996.</p>
<p>   And I'm delighted to say that one of the non-economic challenges</p>
<p>   we faced was to resolve the difficult issue of Native Title. We</p>
<p>   didn't like the Native Title Act of 1993, and we voted</p>
<p>   against it, but the Government of the day insisted on putting it</p>
<p>   through and we were told by Mr Keating that it would be in order.</p>
<p>   We quickly found that that was not the case. And when we came to</p>
<p>   power we promised that we would make the Native Title Act</p>
<p>   more workable. </p>
<p>And two-and-a-quarter years later, at long last, and through the</p>
<p>   cooperation of Senator Brian Harradine, it became possible to reach</p>
<p>   a solution to that problem which is fair to all sections affected</p>
<p>   by Native Title but was also one that was going to get through the</p>
<p>   Federal Parliament. And I am very pleased that that issue is behind</p>
<p>   us, because whatever our views were it was bound to cause continuing</p>
<p>   division in the community. And the reason why we held out for a</p>
<p>   solution that we finally got, was that the solution originally offered</p>
<p>   by Mr Keating and the solution originally offered by the Senate</p>
<p>   before Senator Harradine changed his position was a solution that</p>
<p>   was based on the argument that one section of the Australian community</p>
<p>   should be treated in a way that other sections of the Australian</p>
<p>   community were not. And the principle that I held out for, and the</p>
<p>   principle I am happy to say to you today has been met in full in</p>
<p>   the Native Title compromise is the principle that all Australians</p>
<p>   should be treated equally before the law.</p>
<p>And it was the desire of our opponents, the Labor Party, the Democrats,</p>
<p>   the Greens in the Senate. It was their desire to say that one group</p>
<p>   of Australians should have privileges and rights denied to other</p>
<p>   Australians in a similar position. It was that desire that we were</p>
<p>   not prepared to succumb to, and ultimately I was able to negotiate</p>
<p>   an understanding with Senator Harradine and I give him full credit</p>
<p>   for the courage that he displayed and the way in which he's</p>
<p>   held up against the abuse and the criticism that has unfairly come</p>
<p>   his way since he made his decision. And I am delighted to say to</p>
<p>   you that that issue is now behind us. </p>
<p>And I'm absolutely certain that the new Queensland Government</p>
<p>   will end up very quickly becoming part of a national scheme. I don't</p>
<p>   think there will be much delay or much obstruction in relation to</p>
<p>   that. And we can put that issue behind us. We can say to the farming</p>
<p>   community of Australia, well you can now get on with your businesses</p>
<p>   without the worry of vexatious Native Title claims. We can say to</p>
<p>   the mining industry, particularly in Queensland and Western Australia,</p>
<p>   you are now free to go ahead with the investments that will be installed,</p>
<p>   and with the new measures in the Native Title amendment act, you'll</p>
<p>   be able to get rid of all the vexatious claims that have been made.</p>
<p>   And we'll also be able to say to the indigenous community if</p>
<p>   you have genuine Native Title claims, you now have a machinery to</p>
<p>   have them recognised and to have them dealt with because it has</p>
<p>   never been our desire to deny to the indigenous people of Australia</p>
<p>   access to a machinery which allows them to prove a genuine Native</p>
<p>   Title claim. So it is a win for the farmers, it is a win for the</p>
<p>   miners, and it is a win for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander</p>
<p>   communities of Australia. </p>
<p>But more importantly than that, it is a win for a commonsense solution</p>
<p>   to a difficult problem. A problem that I never believed when I became</p>
<p>   Prime Minister would prove to be so challenging and so intractable.</p>
<p>   So what we've done over the last two-and-a-quarter years is</p>
<p>   to deal with non-economic issues such as Native Title, but we've</p>
<p>   also set about giving Australia stronger economic foundations. And</p>
<p>   I am so glad that we have. And I ask you to contemplate for a moment</p>
<p>   where Australia would be now, given what's happened in Asia</p>
<p>   if we had not reduced Mr Beazley's deficit of $10.5 billion</p>
<p>   a year and produced a surplus of $2.5 billion a year. I ask you</p>
<p>   where we would have been if we had not delivered the lowest interest</p>
<p>   rates in the last 30 years. I ask you where we might be if we had</p>
<p>   not reduced Australia's inflation rate. I ask you where we</p>
<p>   might be if we had not set about reforming Australia's industrial</p>
<p>   relations system. In other words, if we had not embraced economic</p>
<p>   reform, we would now be weaker, more vulnerable and more at risk</p>
<p>   in the light of what has happened in the Asian-Pacific region. Believe</p>
<p>   me, the economic melt down in the region is the worst economic circumstance</p>
<p>   to affect those countries since World War II and it is a triumph</p>
<p>   of Australian economic strength that we have not been more affected</p>
<p>   by what has happened in our region. We can't hope to be unaffected</p>
<p>   because we send more than 50% of our trade in goods and services</p>
<p>   into that region. But I am able to say to you that we are in better</p>
<p>   shape, we have better withstood the downturn, than would otherwise</p>
<p>   have been the case if we had not taken the measures we took from</p>
<p>   the time we came to power.</p>
<p>Now, I know that some of those measures have been criticised, and</p>
<p>   I know there will be people in this room who've disagreed with</p>
<p>   the decisions the Government has taken in this or that area. But</p>
<p>   if you put it all together and if you take the view that no Government</p>
<p>   can ever get an economy in order, can ever put a stronger protective</p>
<p>   layer around an economy in difficult circumstances, unless it takes</p>
<p>   some unpopular decisions. I hope you will see those decisions in</p>
<p>   that light. If we had simply sat there and done nothing and we had</p>
<p>   said well, we'll let the deficit stay where it is, we won't</p>
<p>   do anything that offends anybody, the pressure on our exchange rate,</p>
<p>   the pressure on our economy would have been much greater. And instead</p>
<p>   of us being able to say, well, we've had some impact there</p>
<p>   and a bit of impact over there, the entire Australian economy would</p>
<p>   have been exposed to greater pressure. And if anybody thinks that</p>
<p>   is imagination, I just ask you to look at what has happened to some</p>
<p>   of the economies, including some of the very strong economies in</p>
<p>   the Asian-Pacific region. </p>
<p>And I'm very pleased that Australia has been able to play</p>
<p>   her part in helping countries in the region. Once again, I know</p>
<p>   people are critical of the fact that we extended economic assistance</p>
<p>   to Indonesia and Thailand and to Korea. Some people run around making</p>
<p>   political points out of that and say why are we giving money away</p>
<p>   to foreigners when we should be spending it at home. Well, to start</p>
<p>   with, we are not giving it away. We are lending it. And the second</p>
<p>   thing is that it is in our interests to do so, because these countries</p>
<p>   buy from us, they invest in Australia, and if you ask me what is</p>
<p>   better for Australia, a weak Korea, a weak Thailand, a weak Indonesia</p>
<p>   that buys nothing from Australia or a strong Thailand, a strong</p>
<p>   Indonesia, a strong Korea that buys a lot from Australia, I'll</p>
<p>   say a strong Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia, that buys a lot from</p>
<p>   Australia.</p>
<p>It is in our own national self-interest to make sure that there</p>
<p>   is an economic recovery in the Asian-Pacific region. 34% of Australia's</p>
<p>   exports go to two countries alone Â Korea and Japan. And that</p>
<p>   is more combined than goes to any other two countries in the world,</p>
<p>   and anybody who thinks we can close our eyes and say we don't</p>
<p>   want anything to do with these countries, that we can put up some</p>
<p>   kind of barrier and say, go away leave me alone, doesn't understand</p>
<p>   what is good for Australia. And I think it is very important in</p>
<p>   these difficult times, these challenging times that we understand</p>
<p>   the interdependence and we don't listen to false nostrums which</p>
<p>   say that you can cure Australia's problems by keeping out imports.</p>
<p>   I know that there are a lot of people who are affected by imports.</p>
<p>   I also know that this country exports a lot of good and services,</p>
<p>   and we say to the rest of the world, we don't want your goods,</p>
<p>   the rest of the world will say to us they don't want our goods.</p>
<p>   And I can think of two great Queensland industries, the sugar industry</p>
<p>   and the beef industry which provide a lot of wealth for Queenslanders</p>
<p>   and a lot of investment and a lot of jobs in Queensland. And if</p>
<p>   we do something that puts those export industries at risk, we will</p>
<p>   be doing a great disservice, not only to the State of Queensland</p>
<p>   but to the Australian economy.</p>
<p>Now, I am very strong in my belief that we took the right economic</p>
<p>   decisions, unpopular though some of them may have been, disliked</p>
<p>   by some, though some of them may have been, if we had not taken</p>
<p>   them, I would now be, I believe, culpable in the eyes of the Australian</p>
<p>   people as Prime Minister for not having taken the measures that</p>
<p>   were necessary.</p>
<p>And of course the job is not done. There are still further areas</p>
<p>   of economic reform that are needed, and the next great challenge</p>
<p>   of economic reform is in the area of taxation. The Australian taxation</p>
<p>   system is unfair, it is increasingly discredited and it is becoming</p>
<p>   in the eyes of many unworkable. We have needed taxation reform for</p>
<p>   many years. I came into Parliament in 1974, and two years before</p>
<p>   I came into Parliament there had been commissioned by the then Liberal</p>
<p>   Treasurer, the late Billy Snedden, an inquiry into Australia's</p>
<p>   taxation system that became known as the Asprey Inquiry, and that</p>
<p>   inquiry recommended, believe it or not, the introduction of a broad</p>
<p>   based indirect tax or goods and services tax to replace existing</p>
<p>   indirect taxes or certain ones of them, and accompanied by reductions</p>
<p>   in personal income tax. </p>
<p>And that report came down in 1975, 23 years ago. And reforming</p>
<p>   the tax system was looked at in the late 1970s, in the early 1980s,</p>
<p>   in the mid-1980s and then again as you all remember in early 1990s</p>
<p>   via John Hewson's Fightback! Package. And on each occasion,</p>
<p>   people have either lost the nerve or they've been defeated</p>
<p>   at the ballot box. And many of you might say, well, you shouldn't</p>
<p>   be trying again. And some people have said to me since the Queensland</p>
<p>   election "John, what you've got to do is nothing Â</p>
<p>   that's the solution, do nothing. Go over there, sit down quietly,</p>
<p>   go around Australia, smile at everybody, say you like everybody</p>
<p>   and offer everybody something but please don't embrace any</p>
<p>   of this reform because it will be bad for you". Now, that's</p>
<p>   , I suggest in the eyes of some, an understandable reaction. Can</p>
<p>   I say to you that I think it is a reaction that would be treated</p>
<p>   with the contempt it would deserve from the Australian people. Because</p>
<p>   the solution for Australia at the present time is not to do nothing,</p>
<p>   because we need in Australia's interests to continue reform</p>
<p>   in a number of areas. </p>
<p>I'm not arguing for tax reform because it is good for my health.</p>
<p>   I'm not arguing for tax reform because I have some kind of</p>
<p>   narrow, blinkered, ideological commitment to tax reform. I'm</p>
<p>   arguing for it because I believe it will be good for Australia.</p>
<p>   I'm arguing for it because I believe that it is the next step</p>
<p>   in order to make the Australian economy stronger and even less vulnerable</p>
<p>   to the rest of the world. And we are not proposing a revolutionary</p>
<p>   change. Sure, we are proposing a substantial change. We are proposing</p>
<p>   to produce a system that is fairer and better than the present one,</p>
<p>   and it is a system that when all the details come out very soon,</p>
<p>   then you will see that it is a fair and balanced approach. It is</p>
<p>   not revolutionary, but it is a constructive, huge improvement on</p>
<p>   the present system. And I think when people see the details, they</p>
<p>   will see it is fair. We are not going to put a Goods and Services</p>
<p>   tax on top of the existing indirect tax structure. We are not going</p>
<p>   to bring it in without having personal tax reductions. The rural</p>
<p>   community will find it a very user-friendly package. And Australian</p>
<p>   exporters who are so important to our future will also find it very</p>
<p>   important. And can I say to retired Australians who are here today</p>
<p>   in significant numbers that the package will be structured in a</p>
<p>   way that will not adversely affect your interests. And indeed it</p>
<p>   will be seen by that section of the Australian population as a very</p>
<p>   fair and balanced package.</p>
<p>Now it is very easy at the moment for our political opponents to</p>
<p>   make hay because the detail is not there. They can run around saying</p>
<p>   "Howard wants to do this and Howard wants to do that and he</p>
<p>   is a terrible fellow and don't listen to anything he says".</p>
<p>   But once it is on the table and all the details are there the scare</p>
<p>   campaign can be seen for what it is. A scare campaign. And I am</p>
<p>   committed to it. I am very strongly committed to it because it is</p>
<p>   good for Australia, not for any other reason. If it weren't</p>
<p>   good for Australia, if I didn't believe it was good for Australia,</p>
<p>   I wouldn't be advocating it. And it is my responsibility as</p>
<p>   Prime Minister to advocate things that are good for the country.</p>
<p>   Once I stop doing that I am of no use to the Party I have the privilege</p>
<p>   of leading or no use to the great office that I occupy. Because</p>
<p>   one is elected to Government to do good things for the people who</p>
<p>   elect you according to your own conscientious beliefs and that's</p>
<p>   what I am doing and that is why I remain very strongly committed</p>
<p>   to taxation reform.</p>
<p>And right at the moment we're having a debate about the sale</p>
<p>   of the remaining two -thirds of Telstra into the hands of the men</p>
<p>   and women of Australia. And I know there are some people who disagree</p>
<p>   with that. There'd be people in this room who would say "Well</p>
<p>   I don't know that I agree with that either. Why is he doing</p>
<p>   that?". Well we are doing that, once again, because we believe</p>
<p>   it will benefit Australia. One of the things that I inherited from</p>
<p>   Mr Beazley was an annual deficit of $10.5 billion and an accumulated</p>
<p>   Federal Government debt of between $95 and $100 billion. In other</p>
<p>   words in March of 1996 when I became Prime Minister, the aggregate</p>
<p>   debts of the Federal Government were about $95 to $100 billion.</p>
<p>   And that was because the previous government had run up a whole</p>
<p>   series of annual deficits. So it was accumulating at an annual rate</p>
<p>   of about $10.5 billion. And it had all added up to about $95 to</p>
<p>   $100 billion. Now we couldn't go on with that any more than</p>
<p>   any of you running a business in proportionate terms could go on</p>
<p>   with that. We had to do something about it. And we set about getting</p>
<p>   it down and we set about repaying debt. And one of the reasons why</p>
<p>   I am committed to the privatisation of the rest of Telstra, is that</p>
<p>   the proceeds of that privatisation, which some people put it around</p>
<p>   $40 billion, will be used to pay off the debts of the Federal Government</p>
<p>   run up by previous governments. And it is very important we do that.</p>
<p>   Because if we can do that we can essentially get what I call the</p>
<p>   "debt monkey" off the backs off the future generations</p>
<p>   of Australians. And all of think about the legacy we might leave</p>
<p>   to our children or grandchildren or both. And one of the legacies</p>
<p>   that I would like the members of the present Government to leave</p>
<p>   the future generations of Australians is an essentially debt free</p>
<p>   21st century. If I am able to say as Prime Minister to</p>
<p>   the young Australians who will inherent in the full the 21st</p>
<p>   century, that we have at least got rid of the huge burden of Federal</p>
<p>   Government debt, then I think that is a fine legacy.</p>
<p>Now that is the first reason why I support the privatisation of</p>
<p>   Telstra, the final privatisation of it. The second reason is if</p>
<p>   you are able to sell it and get that amount of money you can afford</p>
<p>   to take a small percentage of those proceeds and turn them into</p>
<p>   what I call a social bonus. And that is you can spend it on identifiable</p>
<p>   things that the public wants. I am happy to announce today, for</p>
<p>   example, that one of the things that will be spending it on, that</p>
<p>   social bonus up to $150 million, is to give to Australians who live</p>
<p>   in remote areas of the country access to untimed local calls. In</p>
<p>   other words just as if you live on the Gold Coast you can ring your</p>
<p>   neighbour on the Gold Coast on an untimed basis or if you live in</p>
<p>   a suburb of Sydney or a suburb of Brisbane, you shouldn't,</p>
<p>   because of the tyranny of distance, be denied the opportunity of</p>
<p>   doing that in a remote part of Australia. And Âneigbourliness',</p>
<p>   having a good neighbour policy and communications, means giving</p>
<p>   to people who live in the very remote parts of the country exactly</p>
<p>   the same opportunity for those untimed local calls. And it has been</p>
<p>   one of those things that has represented a symbol of the communications</p>
<p>   divide between the city and the country in Australia for a long</p>
<p>   period of time. And that will be possible that change, only if,</p>
<p>   of course, the full privatisation of Telstra is supported by the</p>
<p>   Senate.</p>
<p>And Mr Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister, announced yesterday</p>
<p>   a decision by the company which is a real breakthrough in relation</p>
<p>   to the replacement of the analogue telephone services in remote</p>
<p>   parts of Australia in the introduction of a new digital technology</p>
<p>   that will, once again, improve the communications endowment of remote</p>
<p>   and regional areas of Australia. What is being announced today by</p>
<p>   Mr Fischer and Senator Alston, is untimed local calls for the outback</p>
<p>   areas of Australia and the abolition of what is currently called</p>
<p>   the pastoral rate, and the replacement of the pastoral rate with</p>
<p>   a new preferential rate which will enable remote areas at a preferential</p>
<p>   rate to have telephone access to major population centres most adjacent</p>
<p>   to them.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things should be seen in the</p>
<p>   context of the national interest. Not in the context of a narrow</p>
<p>   political ideology. Not in the context of pretending there are easy</p>
<p>   simple solutions to difficult problems. Can I assure you, and I</p>
<p>   have been in politics a few years, that if there were simple, easy</p>
<p>   solutions to Australia's problems I'd have implemented</p>
<p>   them long before now. And I think my predecessors would have implemented</p>
<p>   them long before now. And I do, particularly in the context of current</p>
<p>   political debate here in Queensland, caution anybody against the</p>
<p>   belief that there is a simplistic solution that nobody previously</p>
<p>   has thought of. Of course everybody is fallible and I don't</p>
<p>   claim any monopoly of wisdom and my Government, the Government like</p>
<p>   any other government, has made its mistakes. But I do recognise</p>
<p>   that a commonsense understanding of political challenges and economic</p>
<p>   challenges is very important.</p>
<p>There are just two other things that I do want to say to you. And</p>
<p>   one of those is that I have endeavoured in the time that we have</p>
<p>   been in Government to place a particular emphasis on the role of</p>
<p>   small business within our deliberations. The reductions we've</p>
<p>   achieved in interest rates, the changes we've made for industrial</p>
<p>   relations, the liberalisation we have already achieved in relation</p>
<p>   to unfair dismissal laws, and the attempts that we have also made</p>
<p>   to liberalise them even further. The changes we have made to the</p>
<p>   provisional tax structure, the changes we have made to give much</p>
<p>   greater capital gains, rollover relief to small businesses, the</p>
<p>   changes we've made in relation to retirement benefits concerning</p>
<p>   capital gains tax, the changes we've made to fringe benefits</p>
<p>   tax. All of those things have been designed to make life better</p>
<p>   for small business. Now, there are many other things that I know</p>
<p>   people would have like done and nothing is ever enough when it comes</p>
<p>   to change and reform by government.</p>
<p>But we have placed a very high premium and a very high priority</p>
<p>   on improving the climate and improving the outlook for small business</p>
<p>   within the Australian community.</p>
<p>And the last thing I want to say is the most important, the most</p>
<p>   precious role of government in modern society, is not its statistical</p>
<p>   achievements, important though they may be, it's not the economic</p>
<p>   theory, but it's rather how it relates to people and how it</p>
<p>   responds to the concerns of the Australian community. I understand</p>
<p>   as an Australian who grew up with a great belief in the cohesion</p>
<p>   and the stability and the fairness and the strength of this country,</p>
<p>   I know there are people in Australian society who feel vulnerable</p>
<p>   to change. Change is all around us. There is economic change, there</p>
<p>   is social change. There is change in the way in which family members</p>
<p>   relate to each other. The social habits of people have altered radically</p>
<p>   over a generation. And many people find that change bewildering</p>
<p>   and I understand that. And one of the roles of government is to</p>
<p>   help people through change, but by the same token not to dishonestly</p>
<p>   pretend that some changes can be avoided. Because they can't.</p>
<p>The art of good government situation is to hang on to those things</p>
<p>   that we can preserve and we can identify as a continuity of our</p>
<p>   national life, but at the same time explain the need for change</p>
<p>   and reform in other areas. I believe in hanging on to the good things</p>
<p>   from our past, but also recognising that there are some things from</p>
<p>   our past that do have to change. We do live in global economy. Whether</p>
<p>   we like it or not we are effected by economic decisions in other</p>
<p>   parts of the world and we can't close our eyes to that and</p>
<p>   if we do so we will be trampled under foot.</p>
<p>But I also do know there are some great Australian traditions that</p>
<p>   are as valuable and timeless and as enduring now as they were before</p>
<p>   I was born. And those traditions of mateship, those egalitarian</p>
<p>   traditions and those things that all of us identify instinctively</p>
<p>   as being true Australian traditions. And they're ones that</p>
<p>   I will fight hard and very strongly to preserve.</p>
<p>Behind me hangs the flag of which I am very proud and the flag</p>
<p>   that I have ensured can never be altered without a vote of all of</p>
<p>   the Australian people. I mention that because it is an example of</p>
<p>   the continuity of things that I think is important. But I am also</p>
<p>   conscious of the fact that we are a nation that is now uniquely</p>
<p>   placed to make a contribution </p>
