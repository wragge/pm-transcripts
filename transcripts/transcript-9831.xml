STATEMENT BY TIE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
VISIT TO AUSTRALIA BY CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER CHRETIEN<br />
I am very pleased to announce that the Prime Minister of Canada, the<br />
Rt Hon Jean Chretien will visit Australia as a guest of the Australian Government<br />
from 14 to 16 November.<br />
I warmly welcome this first visit to Australia by a Canadian Prime Minister in<br />
years. Australia and Canada enjoy strong and close relations, which<br />
Prime Minister Chretien's visit will reinforce.<br />
I look forward to greeting Prime Minister Chretien and to discussing with him the<br />
wide range of important issues and interests which our two governments have in<br />
common. CANBERRA 9 November 1995 9. Nov. 95 2: 29 No. 00? </p>
