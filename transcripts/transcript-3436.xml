    <content><![CDATA[<p>RESS STATEMENT NO. 355<br />29 October 1974<br />INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE COMMISSION<br />REFERENCE ON RU1AAL INCOMES<br />The Pri~ Ie Minister announced today that he had sent a<br />reference to the Industries Assistance Commission asking it to<br />inquire into and report on the provision of assistance by<br />the Australian Government to reduce fluctuations in the<br />incomes of rural producers.<br />This matter was raised with the Minister for Agriculture,<br />Senator Wriedt, by the National Rural Advisory Council on<br />October 1974. The Council requested that the Government<br />give urgent consideration to the stabilisation of after-tax<br />farm incomes. The Green Paper on Rural Policy had pointed<br />out that instability resulted in a misallocation and underutilisation<br />of resources in agriculture, it acted as a<br />disincentive to investment, and it discouraged lending to<br />rural producers by financial institutions.<br />A principal recommendation of the first annual report<br />of the IAC tabled today was that the question of assistance<br />to reduce fluctuations in the incomes of rural producers<br />should be referred to the Commission for inquiry and report.<br />The Prime Minister said that it was necessary for the<br />Commission to consider the role which income stabilising<br />measures might play in achieving the broad objective of<br />improved efficiency in resource use. It would also be necessary<br />to have regard to the need to co-ordinate the various specific<br />assistance measures designed to meet the requirements of<br />individual rural industries with general assistance measures<br />having application to rural industries as a whole.<br />In considering measures for stabilising farmers'<br />incomes regard will need to be had to instability arising<br />from fluctuations in production prices and returns as well<br />as specific measures to stabilise after-tax incomes. This<br />will necessitate consideration of all factors affecting farm<br />income including input prices.<br />In recognising the importance to rural industries of<br />stable incomes as a basis for confident and efficient planning<br />the Prime Minister also pointed out that the effects of<br />instability in primary production extended well beyond the<br />farm. gate. The Green Paper on Rural Policy recognised the recent</p>
<p>-2-<br />large swings which had occurred in the level of activity<br />of such service industries as grain storage, abattoirs,<br />fertilizer production and farm machinery.<br />Any measures which make a significant contribution<br />to reducing the fluctuations in farm incomes will not<br />only directly assist the farming community but will be of<br />benefit to the Australian community as a whole.<br />CANBERRA.
