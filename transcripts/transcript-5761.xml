AS DELIVERED<br />
FOR MEDIA FRIDAY' ' 26' FEBRUARY, 1,982<br />
OPENING OF THE DELEGATION OF THE<br />
COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES<br />
It certainly is a memorable occasion to be here at the opening<br />
of this part icular office. We regard it as an important event<br />
in relations between the European Community and Australia.<br />
I and my colleagues are honoured to participate in it. It is<br />
a landmark in Australian-Community relations, and in one sense<br />
I suppose it has indirectly flown from original discussions with<br />
Roy Jenkins three or four years ago. As I understand it, it is<br />
unusual to have a European Community delegation accredited to<br />
once particular country. We are privileged and delighted that<br />
that is so -with us.<br />
The Australian-Community relationship is important. It affects<br />
millions of people, both in Europe and Australia. There has in<br />
some areas been a rapid growth in the relationship. There was a<br />
European Parliamentary delegation here in M~ arch of last year.<br />
We achieved a nuclear safeguards agreement with Euraton, and that<br />
obviously paved the way for uranium exports. There are now<br />
regular Australian-European Community consultations, and these!<br />
are regarded as very important indeed. Your Presidential visit<br />
here is somiething that we welcome very greatly; the opportunity<br />
for plain and frank discussions, but friendly discussions<br />
nonetheless. That is very much welcomed and we hope that<br />
this is just the first of future visits that will take place.<br />
It is obvioug that we seek to establish better understanding,<br />
wider consultation, and not just in matters that affect Australia<br />
and the Community and in very important but perhaps somewhat<br />
narrower times in the area of trade. We have discussed at<br />
different times the North/ South questions, the question of aid,<br />
and with arrangements that have been set up, the discussions that<br />
the Foreign Minister has been involved in concerning Poland and<br />
Western response to Poland, and in many other matters, these are<br />
all regarded as an important part of a broader relationship.<br />
The countries that make up the Community, and-Australia, have<br />
in many important ways the same objectives; their democracies,<br />
common ideals and the role that individuals should play in<br />
society, we want peace, we want stability, we want to be able to<br />
look after ourselves, and I think we all recognise that if we are<br />
to achieve those objectives there are wider obligations that ' we<br />
all have toD accept. Whether those are obligations in relation to<br />
trade and the way we deal with trading partners, or whether they<br />
are obligations in relation to political matters, for example,<br />
participation of a number of European countries in the Sinai force<br />
together with Australia and New Zealand and the United States, we<br />
are working basically for the same objectives, to enable our own </p>
<p>people to lead out their lives as they would want, and in peace,<br />
It is vastly important for the European Community to be strong,<br />
united and outward-looking. More than once in this century<br />
events in Europe have dragged the whole world into * a world war.<br />
I think within Europe that it is somewhat unlikely that that would<br />
occur again. But if you look around the world, there are events in<br />
the Middle East or Indochina or in other~ places that could involve.<br />
Europe in major difficulties. I do not think it is always<br />
adequately understood in Europe that just as in the past European<br />
events embroiled the whole world, now, events wider afield could<br />
embroil Europe. That is one of the reasons again, why we<br />
welcome this particular permanent mission, this delegation, because<br />
the more attention the Commission, the Community, or individual<br />
European countries can pay to events outside of Europe, the more<br />
secure I think the world will be.<br />
The trade issues between us are obviously vastly important.<br />
The European Community earns about $ 7 billion a year in Australia<br />
and we are delighted that they have an opportunity to earn a<br />
profit. The balance of trade favours the European Community by<br />
about $ 1 billion each year. We would obviously be looking forward<br />
to any opportunity to redress that particular balance. I know<br />
there are two arguments that are put in this context; that if you<br />
have an unfavourable with somebody, they always say, ah, but you<br />
must not deal with these things on a bilateral basis, these<br />
questions are multilateral, and then they will try and point around<br />
to see with whom you have a trade surplus. Say, for example, your<br />
trade surplus with Japan is because of your trade deficit with<br />
Europe. That has not actually been said and it might be a slightly<br />
long bow, but it just instances the nature of the argument.<br />
But I find in many other areas, the. United States for example.<br />
argues that the bilateral trade balance with Japan is something<br />
that is very difficult and should not necessarily be endured<br />
and needs re dressing. So if other countries argue to allow the<br />
bilateral point, I think we ought to be allowed to as occasion<br />
allows. But, I do not want to make this just a trade discussion because<br />
there are matters that we have of mutual concern and mutual<br />
interest. Mr. President, we welcome your presence here very<br />
much indeed and we are very glad that you are here for the opening<br />
of this particular office. You have spoken in constructive ways<br />
about the future relationship. I hope this office enables us<br />
to build upon that. 000<br />
