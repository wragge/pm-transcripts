FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 72/ 1969<br />
V IS IT BYAPOLLO_ 11 ASTRONAUTS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong, Edwin<br />
Aldrin and Michael Collins will visit Sydney on Saturday, 1 November<br />
in the course of their world tour embracing over 20 countries.<br />
The astronauts, accompanied by their wives, will reach<br />
Sydney from Bangkok late on Friday night ( 31 October) and will leave<br />
for Guam early on the Sunday morning.<br />
It is unfortunate they cannot spend more time in Australia<br />
and visit more than one city, but the United States has advised us that<br />
this programme must be adhered to because of their heavy world<br />
itinerary. Except for occasional rest days, their entire tour consists<br />
of one-day visits.<br />
Saturday, explorers I am sure those Australians who can be in Sydney on<br />
1 November will give a warm welcome to these space-age<br />
whose exploits caught the imagination of the world.<br />
It would be my intention as Prime Minister to welcome<br />
them on their arrival, and the Commonwealth Government will give a<br />
Luncheon for them in Sydney on the Saturday. Other arrangements for<br />
their stay will be discussed with the New South W~ ales Government.<br />
CANBERRA September 1969<br />
Background: The Prime Minister invited the astronauts to visit<br />
Australia in a congratulatory cable that was awaiting<br />
them when they were taken on board by U. S. S. " Hornet"<br />
following their recovery in the Pacific. </p>
