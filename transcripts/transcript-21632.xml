    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am delighted that the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) has secured the free-to-air rights to telecast the 2005 Ashes series.</p>
<p> SBS's decision to telecast the Ashes series will mean that the vast majority of the Australian viewing public will be able to watch this important sporting event free of charge.</p>
<p>  The 2005 Ashes series promises to be the most keenly contested for years. It can now be enjoyed by the millions of cricket fans across the country.  I look forward to sharing in the excitement of this year's Ashes series with them.  </p>
