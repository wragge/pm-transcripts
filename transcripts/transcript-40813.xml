    <content><![CDATA[<p>I congratulate Mark McGowan on his victory in the Western Australian state election yesterday and I thank Colin Barnett for his outstanding leadership over more than eight years.</p>
<p>Colin became Premier when the State was in the midst of the global financial crisis and he has since managed the State during the largest resources boom in our history and its inevitable wind down.</p>
<p>Colin has been a powerful advocate for the interests of Western Australia and a very wise voice around the COAG table.</p>
<p>I wish Colin and Lyn and their family all the best in the next chapter of their lives.</p>
<p>Western Australia is a dynamic and enterprising state, with a more resilient and diversified economy than ever before.</p>
<p>The State’s remarkable progress is due in large part to the leadership of Colin Barnett; his State and our nation owe him a great debt of thanks for his many years of leadership and public service.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with Mark McGowan to deliver for the people of Western Australia. </p>
