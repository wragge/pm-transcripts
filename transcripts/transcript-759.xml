FOR PRESS NO.<br />
BRITISH BUTTER MARKET SITUATION<br />
( Statement by the Acting Prime Minister and Minister<br />
for Trade, Mr. J. McEwen)<br />
The Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Trade,<br />
Mr. J. McEwen, commented today on the British Government's<br />
announcement of the immediate action it was taking to increase<br />
supplies of butter in the British market over the next few<br />
months. Mr. McEwen recalled that imports of butter into<br />
Britain were regulated under a quota system which was designed<br />
to ensure that butter was sold in Britain at reasonable prices<br />
and that the unduly depressed prices which producers in exporting<br />
countries had suffered from time to time would be avoided.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that as a result of the introduction<br />
of quotas the price of Australian butter ex store London had<br />
been steady at about 314/-stg. per cwt. for some time. This<br />
price was, of course, very much more satisfactory than the<br />
level of 247/-stg. per cwt, which applied before the operation<br />
of the quota system. The increase is worth more than million<br />
by way of extra returns to the Australian dairy indujtry for<br />
a full year's exports.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that over recent weeks the butter<br />
supply position in Britain had tightened and this had been<br />
reflected in quite significant price increases. The price<br />
of Australian and New Zealand butter had increased last week<br />
by 20/-stg. per cwft. and qr'otations for European butter<br />
had risen even more steeply.<br />
It appeared, the Minister said, that this development<br />
in the market arose principally from the adverse affect<br />
upon European butter production of the severe conditions of<br />
last winter and the lateness of the spring. The British<br />
import trade was apparently working on the basis that some<br />
European butter exporting cotzntr'ic L x: uld be unable to supply<br />
their full quotas into the British market. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Mr. MoEwen said it was difficult to forecast<br />
whether the current tight supply situation would continue.<br />
Much would, of course, depend upon the extent to which production<br />
in European exporting countries, throughout the full quota<br />
year ra1nning through to next March, had been influenced by the<br />
climatic conditions. The British Government had taken the view,<br />
however, that supplies within existing quotas would continue to<br />
be very tight over the next month or two. It had accordingly<br />
arranged that Ireland would ship up to 5,000 tons of butter over<br />
and above its quota, provided this amount was available fo~ r<br />
import into the U. K. before the end of August.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that the British Government had<br />
indicated a few days ago its intention of permitting the<br />
importation of this Irish butter over and above the Irish<br />
quota. He had made known to the British Government that whilst<br />
the Australian Dairy Produoe B#" ard naturally regulated its<br />
shipments to the U. K. on a basis compatible with its marketing<br />
opportunities within its annual quota, additional supplies of<br />
Australian butter could be made available speedily. He had<br />
also made clear the Australian Government' s view that in a<br />
situation where additional supplies over and above quotas were<br />
required, such additional requirements should be allocated on<br />
an equitable basis among those quota holding countries in a<br />
position to supply. He had, therefore, sought consultations to<br />
review the current and prospective situation in the British<br />
market and the sources from which additional supplies should<br />
be obtained if the circumstances warrant it. It was expected<br />
that consultations between British and Australian authorities<br />
towards this end would take place within the next few days.<br />
