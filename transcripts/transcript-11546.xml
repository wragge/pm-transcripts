<p>E&amp;OE...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Prime Minister good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Alan.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Prime Minister thank you for your time. Can you assure us that those</p>
<p> textile workers will receive all the benefits to which they're entitled?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can assure you that they will get $4 million from the two governments,</p>
<p> New South Wales and the Commonwealth government. They'll get $2 million</p>
<p> in retraining. And if the deed of arrangement is approved, the advice</p>
<p> is that another $7 million will be available so that they will get the</p>
<p> lot. I can't approve the deed of arrangement. That is up to the unions</p>
<p> and the creditors and that's what the law says. And our offer is</p>
<p> to make up the difference. Now the advice I have, and this is advice given</p>
<p> to the government by the administrator, is that if the deed of arrangement</p>
<p> is approved then it should be $7 million realised and that plus the $4</p>
<p> million being put in by government will mean $11 million is available.</p>
<p> Now in order for this to work we need the deed of arrangement approved</p>
<p> and that means that the workers themselves should support the deed of</p>
<p> arrangement. And if that occurs and my advice is that that is still likely,</p>
<p> more than likely, then they will within a reasonable period of time, and</p>
<p> our $4 million will be made available straight away but....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Is that right, [inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Our $4 million will be made available straight away. We'll be sending</p>
<p> people up to the Hunter to start talking to people about their retraining.</p>
<p> There'll be no delay with the government money. But it is, the whole</p>
<p> thing is conditional on that deed of arrangement being approved.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>If that were approved, and I'm sure it will be approved, but if</p>
<p> it were approved when will the $7 million be available?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well a lot of it would become available within weeks, and some will take</p>
<p> a little longer. I think you'll have close to 70% of it within, including</p>
<p> our own proportion, within you know quite a reasonable period of time.</p>
<p> Some more will take in the normal course a bit longer.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Does this highlight also a weakness in what's been a failure by</p>
<p> successive governments, not just contemporary governments, to recognise</p>
<p> that the workforce is changing in its nature, and while we have people</p>
<p> who might be skilled in one particular area, we are really storing up</p>
<p> problems in the future whereby people don't have the capacity to</p>
<p> transfer to other employment?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it does. I think what it does is to underline the fact that part</p>
<p> of what governments have to do in a global economy is to keep up the process</p>
<p> of economic change and reform, but be willing to give in appropriate places</p>
<p> a bit of extra help for people who are innocently damaged, damaged through</p>
<p> no fault of their own as a result of that change. And I felt very strongly</p>
<p> that these textile workers fell into that category. They live in an area</p>
<p> which although it has a lower unemployment rate than it used to have has</p>
<p> still got a higher unemployment rate than the rest of the country.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>What about.....sorry....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Industry used to have very high levels of protection and now as a result</p>
<p> of decisions taken by the Hawke Labor government and also by our government,</p>
<p> has lower levels of protection. I think it's a defensible decision</p>
<p> because you can't have absurdly high level of tariffs. We still have</p>
<p> quite a high level of tariffs incidentally for textiles, much higher than</p>
<p> the community average. But because of that I think we do have a special</p>
<p> obligation to do a bit more. After all what is happening is that they</p>
<p> are getting what every man in the street would regard as their natural</p>
<p> entitlements. They're not getting some additional handout.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Right. Now what happens about changing legislation to tighten the liability</p>
<p> on employers and directors to ensure that benefits owed to their workers</p>
<p> are met?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we are going to tighten the law to create an offence where a director</p>
<p> behaves in a way that makes it more likely, or is designed rather to deny</p>
<p> to the employees their entitlements. I think there's been a bit of</p>
<p> loose talk about making directors liable for the debts of companies. Now</p>
<p> if you say that well you are in effect overturning the whole principle</p>
<p> of limited liability of companies which has been with us for hundreds</p>
<p> of years. And we're not proposing to do that. But we are proposing,</p>
<p> and I don't think anybody's seriously arguing for that, I haven't</p>
<p> even heard the union leaders argue for that, but what people want is the</p>
<p> law to be tightened so that if people set out to deny their workers their</p>
<p> entitlements, let me make it clear there's no allegation that that</p>
<p> has occurred in relation to National Textiles, then that should be an</p>
<p> offence and we're quite happy to tighten the law to that effect.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But if directors were known to have given themselves significant salary</p>
<p> increases at the time that the company was in trouble, could that be regarded</p>
<p> as taking a position which in the end may well have denied workers of</p>
<p> entitlements?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Alan I'm not going to give an on the run legal opinion. I'm</p>
<p> the Prime Minister, I'm not the solicitor general. And I think it's</p>
<p> very unwise for me to start saying, oh yes, that represents this and that</p>
<p> doesn't. We are going to create the new offence and let the law fall</p>
<p> where it may in relation to the current company. If people have allegations</p>
<p> of impropriety then they make those allegations to the appropriate corporate</p>
<p> law authorities and the law will take its course as it always does under</p>
<p> this Government.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Mr Nick Brooke, from Price Waterhouse Coopers, is quoted today as saying</p>
<p> that he has a personal view that 100 per cent of employee entitlements</p>
<p> should be given protection and that could be achieved through a national</p>
<p> scheme. Under the scheme you have in train that won't be achieved</p>
<p> will it, 100 per cent effective?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no. I think, I mean, Mr Brooke has the luxury, of course, of, you</p>
<p> know, having a personal view and he doesn't have to deal with all</p>
<p> the other demands that are made on the Treasury and on the Federal Government.</p>
<p> We think what we are providing is a basic and proper and decent safety</p>
<p> net. I think to have a situation where there's an open-ended guarantee</p>
<p> of the type he is proposing could produce the situation where arrangements</p>
<p> are deliberately made in the knowledge that the Government will pick up</p>
<p> the tab. Arrangements are made perhaps to load up redundancies as far</p>
<p> as industrial agreements...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But if you tighten company law arrangements and punishment provisions,</p>
<p> as you have said, that would be prosecutable wouldn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, that wouldn't be prosecutable. I mean, no, no, we are not...I</p>
<p> mean, I am talking here about an industrial agreement made between an</p>
<p> employer and employee where instead of perhaps a pay rise being given</p>
<p> they say, well look, we'll give you, you know, some extra weeks redundancy</p>
<p> because we know that if things fall over the Federal Government will pick</p>
<p> up the tab. I mean, you have got to have some kind of discipline of that</p>
<p> kind because we have got taxpayers to consider as well as workers. I mean,</p>
<p> we have to juggle priorities, we don't have the luxury of taking</p>
<p> a black and white view in each particular case.</p>
<p>Now, the basic scheme, I think, provides a fair safety net. In the case</p>
<p> of National Textiles what we have really done is we have applied the basic</p>
<p> scheme and we have said in addition because of the regional circumstances</p>
<p> and because it's textiles the industry has lost a lot of protection</p>
<p> and is going through a very competitive phase we are going to put in a</p>
<p> bit more. Now, that's the explanation for...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I suppose Mr Brooke's argument was conditioned by the fact that</p>
<p> he was the receiver of the company which owned the Woodlawn Copper Mine</p>
<p> where 150 miners were owed $6.5 million and he said that in that case</p>
<p> the Government rejected a bid for compensation. There are still many workers</p>
<p> who haven't got that to which they are entitled aren't there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look, there have and I accept that. I accept that people in the</p>
<p> past will look at some of these things and say, gee, I would like to have</p>
<p> been treated like that. I understand that. I mean, I point out, of course,</p>
<p> that the Labor Party was in power for 13 years and they never proposed</p>
<p> even a safety net scheme. They are now screaming in and saying we've</p>
<p> got to do this, we've got to do that. The union mates in the ACTU</p>
<p> never persuaded Mr Keating or Mr Hawke to have it, even a safety net scheme.</p>
<p> So, I mean, we are at least providing a measure of basic justice and entitlement</p>
<p> to workers that no previous government has ever provided. It's easy</p>
<p> for people who don't have the responsibility of juggling demands</p>
<p> on public money, and it is public money, to say, well, you know, you ought</p>
<p> to do this, you ought to go further. I mean, we'd all like to have</p>
<p> an ideal world and we have to try and find within the resources available</p>
<p> what is a fair and just solution and I think we have certainly found it</p>
<p> for the textile workers. This is a difficult area. They are not highly</p>
<p> paid men and women, I felt very sorry for them when I talked to them.</p>
<p> I spent an hour with them, they are decent people who have had a bad deal</p>
<p> and, you know, they've had a rough trot and I wanted to help them.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Can you explain why petrol prices went up five to six cents a litre overnight</p>
<p> here yesterday? Yesterday morning on the Pacific Highway they were 85</p>
<p> to 86 cents a litre, the night before they were 79 to 80 cents a litre.</p>
<p> There's all this conjecture about whether petrol prices are going</p>
<p> to go up when the GST goes up. What is causing this massive fluctuation</p>
<p> in petrol prices?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the one thing I can tell your listeners, Alan, is that any fluctuation</p>
<p> now has nothing to do with the GST.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>We hope not.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it doesn't. I mean, Alan, it's just...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I know but why does it happen?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>....common sense. It comes in on the 1st of July.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But as an exercise in common sense, to use your language, none of us</p>
<p> can understand why it...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, let me try and explain it very simply that the price of petrol</p>
<p> is basically affected by the price of crude oil and crude oil has for</p>
<p> 24 years or 22 years been set at the world level. And the world price</p>
<p> of crude oil has gone up because the oil producing nations are rationing</p>
<p> their supply and that is having an impact on oil prices and therefore</p>
<p> petrol prices around the world. When you add to that the normal competitive</p>
<p> processes of discounting in any mass market like petrol you are going</p>
<p> to get fluctuations in price. Now, I don't like it and I know the</p>
<p> motorists don't like it but I can't control the world price.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Okay. But let me take you another line on that then. You have promised</p>
<p> that the excise, the petrol excise will be cut equal to the GST impact.</p>
<p> Now, there are different GST prices, the difference between bush and city</p>
<p> is some 10 to 20 cents a litre. So surely either way you look the bush</p>
<p> people are going to pay more after the GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think people should just wait and see when all the details of</p>
<p> it are unveiled.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>So what are you [inaudible] will happen?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We made a commitment and we said that the price need not rise as a result</p>
<p> of the GST and I intend to deliver on that commitment. I made that clear</p>
<p> last night and I want to assure motorists that that commitment is going</p>
<p> to be met.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>So petrol in the bush and petrol in the city, petrol Australia wide will</p>
<p> not increase under the GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. The imposition of the GST is not going to produce an increase in</p>
<p> the price of petrol. That's the point. There are a few other things.</p>
<p> The world price, I can't control the world price. I mean there is</p>
<p> the same thing with cars.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Sorry, what price isn't going to go up?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, there is going to be no price increase consequent upon the GST, that's</p>
<p> the point.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But the petrol price might go up because of world prices.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's happening now. But it might come down. I mean the OPEC</p>
<p> countries might...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Petrol comes down, we never seem to get a reduction in oil through petrol</p>
<p> do we?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Can I just finish, this is a very important issue. The world price of</p>
<p> petrol could go down. The point that I'm making and the commitment</p>
<p> we made was that as a result of the GST, there need not be a rise. We</p>
<p> have never said that we can control the price charged by OPEC countries</p>
<p> and the price variation you refer to on the Pacific Highway this morning</p>
<p> is a result of the world price changing. Now, that could go up further,</p>
<p> or it could come down.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>How do the poor people at the bowser know that it is a result of the</p>
<p> world crude oil price, not the GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there will be price surveillance mechanisms which will be able</p>
<p> to measure the impact of world pricing and the ACCC will have quite a</p>
<p> lot of resources to do this. And we will be doing all that we can to ensure</p>
<p> that that is the case.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But, be fair, I mean the Labor Government introduced the excise indexation.</p>
<p> Surely to be fair isn't there the capacity with the GST to remove</p>
<p> indexation on smokes, and beer and the petrol bowser so that these things</p>
<p> don't become outposts of the tax office?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you could do that. But if you wanted to do that you then have to</p>
<p> cut into some of the tax cuts. I mean it's not a question of, I mean</p>
<p> you say to be fair, why can't we remove them? Well, we didn't</p>
<p> say that that was part of the arrangement.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>They're sort of hidden.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they're not hidden, I mean you know about them.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I thank God I do.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You talk about them very regularly to your listeners. There is certainly</p>
<p> nothing hidden about them. And I mean I get pulled up and asked questions</p>
<p> about them all day. So, look Alan, we gave out a plan. And that plan involved</p>
<p> a total revamp of the system. First and foremost it is going to cut personal</p>
<p> tax by $12 billion. We're going to cut capital gains tax in half.</p>
<p> We're going to reduce company tax from 36 to 30. We're going</p>
<p> to give the states an access to growth revenue which means they'll</p>
<p> have more money for schools, and roads and hospitals. Now, if you start</p>
<p> taking away individual struts in the scheme, it will imperil the overall</p>
<p> advantages. I mean too much of the argument about tax reform is focusing</p>
<p> on one tiny aspect. Instead of people seeing it as part of a total rewrite</p>
<p> to the benefit of economic strengthening of the country. And my mission</p>
<p> in life, if you like, over the months ahead is to keep pointing out to</p>
<p> my fellow Australians that this is a new system which is going to strengthen</p>
<p> our economy and overall bring great benefits. If we focus just on one</p>
<p> aspect then we will lose sight of all of those overall benefits.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>You are going to have to handle the detail aren't you? I mean .</p>
<p> . . .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Alan, I understand and I am doing it now.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Ok, well let me give you another chance. Coles-Myer, Woolworths, and</p>
<p> the large retailers want to use price tags that list both the pre-GST</p>
<p> prices on an item and the post-GST price on the same ticket, so that they</p>
<p> can avoid massive costs when the GST comes into place. Why are they being</p>
<p> denied the opportunity to do that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we have, we're having discussions with them about that. And</p>
<p> those discussions are ongoing and we've pointed out that you know</p>
<p> that the proposals, the intent of the new scheme is to have a situation</p>
<p> where the price of the GST, the tax affected is included in the price.</p>
<p> And those discussions will go on and I am sure we can resolve them.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>So, you are sure that the ban on dual ticketing on price tags may not</p>
<p> stay a problem?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no I am not saying that. Alan, there are a whole lot of these things</p>
<p> that are the subject of ongoing discussions and we've had some discussions,</p>
<p> I mean I haven't been directly privy to those discussions. And there</p>
<p> are reasons which the Treasurer has pointed out and the Treasurer's</p>
<p> argued that the price tags should build in the cost of the GST, should</p>
<p> build in the cost of the GST. Now, look we are discussing that matter.</p>
<p> We've got reasons for it and those discussions will go on and we've</p>
<p> still got four months to go.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Ok, just before you go. On interest rates, what impact on for example,</p>
<p> a classic account paid .1% on a credit balance of just up to $5,000. If</p>
<p> it is up to $10,000, .2% and if you've got $99,999 in the bank you</p>
<p> get 1.5% interest. Isn't it appalling [inaudible] in your mind between</p>
<p> what you pay if you're a borrower and what you'll see if you're</p>
<p> a saver.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I guess it depends on the size of the account. I can't say</p>
<p> there's an appalling disparity.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>.1%, the battler gets for $5,000 a year.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I know it's very low.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Lended out at 8.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I accept that. I mean I guess it all adds to the argument to have even</p>
<p> more competition amongst banks. Which is the Government's policy.</p>
<p> And we do have more competition in the financial system as a result of</p>
<p> our reforms. I mean, Aussie Home Loans, Credit Unions. That is our policy.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Alright Prime Minister, I'd better say let you go. Thank you for</p>
<p> your time.</p>
