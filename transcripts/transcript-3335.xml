SPEECH BY THE PRIME M1INISTER,<br />
T1IlE HON. E. G. WH ITLAM1 Q. C. M. P.<br />
AT THE 1611l ANNIVERSARY OF THE OFFICIAL OPENING OF THE<br />
LIVERPOOL DISTRICT [: oSPIIAL,<br />
SYDNEY FRIDAY 296 JULY 1974i<br />
TtHE LIVERPOOL DISTRICT HOSPITAL STANDS AS<br />
SOMETHING OF AN OASIS IN A DESERT OF HEALTH CARE FACILITIES<br />
IN THE IWESTERN SUBURBS OF SYDNEY. IT IS ONE OF ONLY<br />
1' 4 PUBLIC AND 6 PRIVATE HOSPITALS IN ONE OF THE MOST POPULOUS<br />
AND RAPIDLY GROWING AREAS OF AUSTRALIA. THE WESTERN<br />
METROPOLITAN AREA OF SYDNEY, WHICH INCLUDES LIVERPOOL AS<br />
~ NE OF ITS FOCAL POINTS, HAS A POPULATION OF NEARLY ONE<br />
MILLION,. OR NEARLY ONE QUARTER OF THE POPULATION OF THE<br />
STATE. IT IS EXPERIENCING A RAPID POPULATION GROWTH OF<br />
MORE THAN 10 A YEAR AND YOUNG FAMILIES COMPRISE MOST OF<br />
THIS INCREASE. DESPITE ITS SIZE AND RATE OF GROWTH, THE AREA IS<br />
DEFICIENT IN MOST HEALTH SERVICES. THIS APPLILS PARTICULARLY<br />
TO HOSPITAL SERVICES. THE AREA HAS ONLY 3.3 BEDS FOR EVERY<br />
THOUSAND PEOPLE COMPARED WITH THE STATE'S AVERAGE OF 6.4# BEDS<br />
PER THOUSAND. THE DEFICIENCY IS EVEN GREATER WHEN ONE CONSIDERS<br />
THE SHORTAGE OF MATERNAL AND PAEDIATRIC SERVICES WHICH EXISTS<br />
IN AN AREA WITH SO MANY YOU1NG FAMILIES. </p>
<p>-2<br />
THE PROVISION AND PLANN~ ING OF HEALTH CARL FACILITIES<br />
IN AUSTRALIA FOR TOO LONG HAS BEEN CHARACTERISED BY SHORTCOMINGS<br />
OF THIS KIND. INDEED IT IS A LACK OF PLANNING WHICH IS THE<br />
FAULT. MY COLLEAGUE, THE MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITY,<br />
AM. BILL HAYDEN, HAS POINTED OUT TH-AT IN SYDNEY, FOR EXAMPLE,<br />
THE CITY I5 7 TEACHING HOSPITALS ARE LOCATED WITHIN AN<br />
EIGHT MILE RADIUS OF THE G. P. O. AND 5 OF THEM ARE WITHIN<br />
A FOUR MILE RADIUS. YET THE GREAT MAJORITY OF SYDNEY'S<br />
POPULATION LIVES A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE OUTSIDE THESE<br />
PARAMETERS, BEYOND HOSPITALS, THERE IS A MALDISTRIBUTION OF<br />
DOCTORS AND OTHER SKILLED MEDICAL MANPOWER. THE RESULT IS<br />
THAT PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN LONG-ESTABLISHED AND GENERALLY<br />
AFFLUENT AREAS HAVE ACCESS TO THE FULL RANGE OF HIGH QUALITY<br />
HEALTH CARE. IN CONTRAST, PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN NEWER AND<br />
FREQUENTLY DISADVANTAGED AREAS DO NOT. HAVE SUCH ACCESS.<br />
IT IS MONSTROUSLY INEQUITABLE THAT PARENTS ON A<br />
LOW INCOME LIVING IN THE WESTERN SUBURBS SHOULD HAVE TO SPEND<br />
HOURS TRAVELLING AT RELATIVELY GREAT COST 20 MILES OR MORE<br />
BY TRAIN AND BUS TO VISIT A SICK CHILD IN A PAEDIATRIC HOSPITAL<br />
WHILE AFFLUENT PARENTS LIVING IN, SAY, THE EASTERN SUBURBS<br />
OF SYDNEY FACE ONLY A SHORT CAR TRIP TO VISIT THEIR CHILD.<br />
IT IS EQUALLY INEQUITABLE THAT THE WESTERN SUBURBS FAMILY<br />
SHOULD SUFFER A DEARTH OF DOCTORS TO TREAT THEIR ILLNESSES AND<br />
INJURIES WHILE THE EASTERN SUBURBS FAMILY SHOULD LIVE IN AN AREA<br />
WHICH ABOUNDS IN MEDICAL AND HOSPITAL SERVICES. IT IS NOT THAT<br />
WE SHOULD DENY THE AFFLUENT ACCESS TO THE BEST HEALTH CARE;<br />
BUT WE MUST ENSURE THAT EVERYONE IN THE COMMIUNITY RECEIVES THE<br />
BEST POSSIBLE TREATMENT, IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR FINANCIAL MEANS<br />
AND THEIR PHYSICAL LOCATION. s. m1/ 3 </p>
<p>IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT THE PRESENT<br />
GOVERNMENT SAW THE NEED FOR AN URGENT AND THOROUGH EXAMINATION<br />
OF THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH SERVICES THROUGHOUT 4USTRALIA.<br />
A HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SERVICES INTERIM COMMITTEE, WHICH<br />
LATER BECAME BY STATUTE THE HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SERVICES<br />
COMMISSION, WAS APPOINTED LAST YEAR TO INVESTIGATE,<br />
REPORT ON AND RECOMMEND NECESSARY ACTION TO OVERCOME BOTH<br />
IMMEDIATE AND LONG-TERM PROBLEMS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE<br />
COMMISSION IS " THE PROVISION OF HIGH QUALITY, READILY<br />
ACCESSIBLE, REASONABLE COMPREHENSIVE, CO-ORDINATED AND<br />
EFFICIENT HEALTH AND RELATED WELFARE SERVICES AT LOCAL,<br />
REGIONAL, STATE AND NATIONAL LEVELS." fN THE COMMISSION'S<br />
RECOMMENDATIONS WE ALLOCATED $ 4t. 5 MILLION IN 1) 131/ 4<br />
TO MEET URGENT NEEDS FOR ADDITIONAL HOSPITALS IN SYDNEY,<br />
MIELBOURNE AND BRISBANE. OF THAT AMOUNT, 14 MILLION WAS TO<br />
BE PROVIDED TOWARDS THE COST OF PLANNING AND COMMENC. ING<br />
THE HOSPIT AL PROPOSED FOR WESTMEAD SINCE 1968. TO DATE<br />
ONLY $ 577,000 HAS BEEN USED FOR THE WESTMEAD PROJECT. THIS<br />
MEANT THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS ABLE TO ALLOCATE FROM THE UNUSED<br />
PFUNDS $ 500,000 TOWARDS THE COST OF A NEW WARD BLOCK AT<br />
THE LIVERPOOL DISTRICT HOSPITAL. INEARLY $ 112,0J00 OF THIS HAD<br />
BEEN SPENT BY THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR. ms i </p>
<p>THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF A MAJOR OVERHAUL<br />
OF HOSPITAL SERVICES ENVISAGED BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT,<br />
ON 10 APRIL THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH, DR EVERINGHAM, TABLED<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES A " REPORT ON HOSPITALS IN<br />
AUSTRALIA" PREPARED BY THE HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SERVICES<br />
COMMISSION. THE REPORT PROPOSES THAT OVER A FIVE YEAR<br />
PERIOD BEGINNING ON 1 JULY 1974 A PROGRAM BE IMPLEMENTED<br />
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION OF HOSPITALS, MENTAL<br />
HEALTH FACILITIES, PUBLIC NURSING HOMES AND HEALTH HOSTELS<br />
AT A TOTAL COST OF $ 1,160 MILLION. THE REPORT HAS YET TO<br />
BE CONSIDERED BY CABINET, SO IT IS TOO EARLY FOR ME TO<br />
DEFINE THE EXACT EXTENT OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S<br />
INVOLVEMENT IN SUCH A PROGRAM. HOWEVER, IT IS QUITE CLEAR<br />
THAT, IF VIE ARE TO HAVE ADEQUATE HOSPITALS, THE 1USTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO BECOME MORE INVOLVED IN THEIR PLANNING<br />
AND FINANCING THAN IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST, THE STATE<br />
GOVERNMENTS SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THlE RESOURCES TO OVERCOME THE<br />
DEFICIENCIES THAT EXIST AT PRESENT. U\ AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
INVOLVEMENT IS ESPECIALLY NECESSARY IF WE ARE TO SOLVE THE<br />
PRESENT GROSS MALDISTRIBUTION OF FACILITIES. SINCE THE 1946<br />
REFERENDUM THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS POSSESSED, BUT<br />
HITHERTO HAS NOT EXERCISED, THE CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY<br />
TO PROVIDE HOSPITAL BENEFITS AND MEDICAL SERVICES; IN OTHER<br />
WORDS, THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT CAN ITSELF BUILD, FINANCE<br />
AND MANAGE HOSPITALS AND HEALTH CENTRES. 1611 </p>
<p>THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
IN THE FINANCING OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS MUST EXTEND BEYOND<br />
CAPITAL COSTS. THE RUNNING COSTS OF HOSPITALS REPRESENT<br />
A EVER-INCREASING PROBLEM. THE HOSPITALS AND HEALTH<br />
SERVICES COMMISSION REPORT IN APRIL POINTED OUT THAT,<br />
AS TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND THE COMPLEXITY OF INSTITUTIONS<br />
INCREASE, SO THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM BECOMES MORE LABOUR INTENSIVE.<br />
" THIS TREND MAY BE PECULIAR TO HOSPITALS AND IS UNLIKELY TO<br />
BE REVERSED," I THE REPORT SAID. THIS PROBLEM EXTENDS INTO<br />
OTHLR HEALTH SERVICES AS WELL AS HOSPITALS. AT PRESENT<br />
HEALTH SERVICES COST OUR NATION MORE THAN $ 2,000 MILLION A<br />
YEAR, OR ABOUT 5.3Z' OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT. THEIR COST<br />
IS INCREASING SO DRAMATICALLY THAT IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT<br />
OUR EXPENDITURE ON HEALTH SERVICES COULD BE MORE THAN 12% OF<br />
GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT BY THE YEAR 2-000. THE RESULT OF THIS<br />
INCREASE HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY REFLECTED IN HOSPITALS.<br />
HIGHER CHARGES AND GROWING DEFICITS HAVE BECOME A FEATURE<br />
OF OUR HOSPITAL SYSTEM IN RECENT YEARS.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WILL IN FACT ASSUME A MUCH<br />
GREATER ROLE IN THE MEETING OF RUNNING COSTS UNDER ITS PROPOSED<br />
HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM. UNDER THE PRESENT SYSTEM IT PAYS A<br />
SUBSIDY OF ONLY $ 2 A DAY FOR HOSPITAL PATIENTS, ALTHOUGH THERE<br />
ARE INEVITABLY OTHER BENEFITS WHICH DERIVE FROM TAXATION<br />
CONCESSIONS. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IN 1974/ 75 THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO PAY ONLY $ 165 MILLION TOWARDS THE<br />
OPERATING COSTS OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS. THIS COMPARES WITH AN<br />
ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE OF $ 5410 MILLION BY STATE GOVERNMENTS AND<br />
$ 2' 40 MILLION BY INSURED AND UNINSURED PATIENTS. 16 </p>
<p>THE HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM INVOLVES A GREAT<br />
AND CONTINUING IMPROVEMENT IN THE FINANCING OF PUBLIC<br />
HOSPITALS, UNDER BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH EACH STATE,<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD BE PREPARED TO MEET 50 PER CENT<br />
OR,' fHE NET OPERATING COSTS OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS, THE<br />
AUSIRALIAN GOVERNMENT PAID BENEFITS APPROACHING 50 PER CENT<br />
OF OPERATING COSTS FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF THE HOSPITAL<br />
BENEFIT ACT IN 1945 UNTIL THE ACT'S REPLACEMENT BY THE<br />
LIBERAL/ COUNTRY PARTY GOVERNMENT IN 1952, HOSPITALS IN<br />
ALL STATES WILL BENEFIT FROM THE NEW ARRANGEMENT, THE TOTAL<br />
GAIN TO STATE GOVERNMENTS IN 1974/ 75, IF THE PROGRAM HAD<br />
BEEN INTRODUCED IN TIME, WOULD HAVE BEEN $ 80 MILLION, IN<br />
NEW SOUTH WALES THE GAIN WOULD HAVE BEEN $ 15 MILLION,<br />
THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE FINANCIAL SITUATION OF<br />
THE STATE-PUBLIC HOSPITALS SYSTEMS WILL NOT OF COURSE BE<br />
THE ONLY BENEFIT FROM THE HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM, THE<br />
PROGRAM WILL OVERCOME THE INEQUITIES AND LACK OF COVERAGE<br />
WHICH EXIST AT PRESENT UNDER THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE<br />
SYSTEM, FOR A START, THE PROGRAM WILL AUTOMATICALLY COVER<br />
ALL RESIDENTS OF AUSTRALIA, IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR MEANS OF<br />
THEIR BACKGROUNDS, IT WILL BE FINANCED IN THE MOST EQUITABLE<br />
MANNER AS THE PAYMENTS TO BE MET BY INDIVIDUALS* WILL BE<br />
BASED ON THEIR CAPACITY TO PAY, THE PROPOSED LEVY OF<br />
1,35 PER CENT ON TAXABLE INCOME WILL PROVE CHEAPER THAN THE<br />
PRESENT HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEME FOR THE GREAT MAJORITY OF<br />
AUSTRALIANS, 117 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS, AUSTRALIANS WILL RECEIVE<br />
A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF MEDICAL AND HOSPITAL TREATMENT,<br />
IF A DOCTOR SENDS HIS BILL DIRECT TO THE PROPOSED HEALTH<br />
INSURANCE COMMISSION, HIS PATIENT WILL NOT HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING<br />
FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT, EVEN IF THE DOCTOR SENDS HIS BILL<br />
TO HIS PATIENT, THE COMMISSION WILL PAY AT LEAST 85 PER CENT<br />
OF THE SCHEDULED FEE, AND IN NO CASE, WHERE THE SCHEDULED FEE<br />
IS CHARGED, WOULD THE PATIENT HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN $ 5 FOR ANY<br />
MEDICAL SERVICES, TO DISMISS IMMEDIATELY ONE PHONY ISSUE<br />
THAT HAS BEEN RAISED BY OUR OPPONENTS, THESE ARRANGEMENTS<br />
WILL APPLY TO SERVICES PROVIDED BY ANY DOCTOR THAT ANY PATIENT<br />
CHOOSES TO CONSULT, FOR HOSPITAL TREATMENT, EVERYONE WILL BE<br />
ENTITLED TO FREE STANDARD WARD TREATMENT: ADMISSION TO THESE<br />
WARDS WILL NOT BE RESTRICTED TO PEOPLE WHO SATISFY THE<br />
SAVAGE MEANS TESTS WHICH APPLY IN SOME STATES AT PRESENT,<br />
THE PROGRAM WILL ACHIEVE. THIS GOAL WITHOUT DESTROYING THE<br />
VIABILITY AND INDEPENDENCE OF RELIGIOUS, CHARITABLE AND<br />
COMMUNITY HOSPITALS, PATIENTS IN PRIVATE WARDS OF PUBLIC<br />
HOSPITALS OR IN PRIVATE HOSPITALS WILL ATTRACT A BED SUBSIDY<br />
OF $ 16 PER DAY FROM THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT. A CONSIDERABLE<br />
IMPROVEMENT ON THE $ 2 A DAY WHICH IS CURRENTLY PAID, THE<br />
GOVERNMENT AIMS TO ENSURE THAT PRIVATE INSURANCE IS AVAILABLE<br />
AT REASONABLE COST TO COVER ANY EXTRA CHARGES FACED BY<br />
PRIVATE PATIENTS, 1, ,/ 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
THE FAIRNESS, THE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE AND THE<br />
OTHER BENEFITS OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM HAVE<br />
COMPELLED US TO PERSEVERE WITH ITS IMPLEMENTATION IN<br />
THE FACE OF SOME BITTER OPPOSITION, THIS IS NOT A BLIND<br />
DOCTRINAIRE PERSEVERANCE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS WON TWO<br />
ELECTIONS IN WHICH THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN AN ESSENTIAL PART<br />
OF OUR PLATFORM, IN FACT PROBABLY NO CURRENT ISSUE IN<br />
AUSTRALIAN POLITICS HAS RECEIVED A MORE THOROUGH AIRING,<br />
WE BELIEVE THAT, IN ELECTING US TO GOVERNMENT, THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE HAVE INDICATED A DESIRE FOR THE SORT OF<br />
CHANGE TO WHICH WE ARE COMMITTED,<br />
THE HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM IS COVERED BY TWO<br />
OF THE SIX BILLS WHICH WILL BE PUT TO A JOINT SITTING OF<br />
BOTH HOUSES OF THE AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT IN THE WEEK<br />
AFTER NE*( T. BECAUSE OF THE RENEWED SUPPORT GIVEN TO IIS<br />
BY THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE ON 18 MAY, THE GOVERNMENT WILL<br />
HAVE A MAJORITY TO ENSURE THEIR PASSAGE AT THE JOINT<br />
SITTING, DESPITE THIS RENEWED SUPPORT, OUR OPPONENTS PERSIST<br />
IN TRYING TO PREVENT THE PROGRAM FROM COMING INTO OPERATION#<br />
THEIR SPOKESMEN IN THE PARLIAMENT SAY THAT THEY WILL OPPOSE<br />
ANY COMPLEMENTARY LEGISLATION, WE ARE EQUALLY DETERMINED<br />
NOT TO BE THWARTED YET AGAIN BY THESE PROPONENTS OF A<br />
MORIBUND AND UNJUST SYSTEM, IT REMAINS THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
FIRM INTENTION TO INTRODUCE THE PROGRAM, OBSTRUCTION IN<br />
THE SENATE MAY HAVE DELAYED ITS INTRODUCTION, BUT WILL NOT<br />
PREVENT IT, WE EXPECT THE HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM TO<br />
BECOME A REALITY IN 1975, </p>
<p>THE PROGRAM WILL NOT IN ITSELF OVERCOME ALL OF THE<br />
FAILINGS OF HEALTH CARE IN AUSTRALIA., THE WORK OF THE<br />
HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SERVICES COMMISSION MUST PLAY A MAJOR PART<br />
IN THIS PROCESS0 I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED ITS ACTIVITIES IN<br />
RELATION TO HOSPITALS. MUCH NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THE PROVISION<br />
OF OTHER COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES. IT IS FOR THIS REASON<br />
THAT IN 1973174 WE ALLOCATED $ 10 MILLION TO ASSIST THE STATES<br />
AND ELIGIBLE ORGANISATIONS TO MEET THE CAPITAL AND OPERATING<br />
COSTS OF REGIONAL ORGANISED COMMUNITY-BASED HEALTH SERVICES.<br />
COMMUNITY HEALTH FACILITIES, PROVIDED AT CENTRES AND THROUGH<br />
DOMICILIARY SERVICES, OFFER A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR COMBATING<br />
THE UNEVEN DISTRIBUTION OF DOCTORS AND OTHER HEALTH WORKERS<br />
IN OUR COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE PROVIDED 7.5 MILLION<br />
TO ASSIST THE STATES TO DEVELOP COMMUNITY-BASED MENTAL HEALTH.-<br />
ALCOHOLISM AND DRUG DEPENDENCY SERVICES.<br />
COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES WILL NOT ONLY BENEFIT<br />
THE PUBLIC BUT WILL PROVIDE MORE EXCITING NEW POSSItlILITIES<br />
FOR HEALTH WORKERS. ALL GOVERNMENTS ARE CURRENTLY UNDERGOING<br />
A RETHINKING OF THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE IMPORTANCE OF<br />
ANCILLARY MEDICAL STAFF. RECENT INCREASES GRANTED TO<br />
NURSES IN NEW SOUTH WALES ARE ONE INDICATION OF THIS.<br />
BUT THE RETHINKING MUST INVOLVE MORE THAN A QUESTION OF MONEY.<br />
IT IS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT COMMUNITY HEALTH FACILITIES PROVIDE<br />
GREAT OPPORTUNITIES, THERE IS EVERY INDICATION THAT NURSES<br />
AND OTHER ANCILLARY STAFF WILL FORM A NEW " IFRONT LINE" I OF<br />
MEDICINE, OPERATING FROM HEALTH CENTRES THEY WILL PLAY A<br />
VITAL ROLE IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF HOME CARE SERVICES. AT THE<br />
CENTRES THEMSELVES THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PERFORM MANY FUNCTIONS<br />
AS A VALUABLE SUPPLEMENT TO THE WORK OF DOCTORS. </p>
<p>10<br />
THE PROVISION OF A COMPREHENSIVE HIGH QUALITY SYSTEM<br />
OF HEALTH CARE IN AUSTRALIA DOES NOT REPRESENT AN EASY TASK.<br />
WE SUFFER FROM YEARS OF NEGLECT IN PLANNING AND FINANCE,<br />
BUT THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT WITH THE TWIN WEAPONS<br />
OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM AND THE HOSPITALS AND<br />
HEALTH SERVICES COMMISSION WE CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS. </p>
