AUSTRA L A<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 14 SEPTEMBER 1976<br />
CONDOLENCE -MAO TSE-TUNG<br />
Mao Tse-Tung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the<br />
Chinese Communist Party, died on 9 September. He was the<br />
principal architect of China since 1949 and one of the very<br />
few men who have had a major impact on the course of world<br />
hi story.<br />
He led the Chinese Communist Party through a long and<br />
destructive civil war and in his writings set out a new<br />
conception of what China could be. Mao Tse-Tung devoted<br />
his life to the vision of a rigorously egalitarian society,<br />
and in pursuit of that vision he mobilized the vast energies<br />
of the Chinese people.<br />
For the first time in many decades Mao Tse-Tung gave'<br />
China an effective administration, restored a country ravaged<br />
by civil war, and secured the basic necessities of life to<br />
China's people. He sought for China self-reliance. Under<br />
his leadership China assumed a major role in world affairs.<br />
Mao Tse-Tung's conception of the desirable organisation of a<br />
socity was not ours. But he achieved peace internally<br />
and respect for China. He came to symbolise . the new.<br />
China for his own people and for the world.<br />
In recent years under Mao Tse-Tung's leadership, China<br />
began to adjust her -ideological objectives to the realities<br />
of world power. His meeting in 1972 with the President of<br />
the United States was a significant and deliberate step in<br />
this process. For Australians, it is of considerable<br />
significance that, as China's supreme leader, he lent his<br />
rsonal authority to the establishment and further development<br />
o{ f China's relations with Australia. In the closing<br />
years of his life, important steps were taken in the improvement<br />
of friendship and mutual understanding between China and Australia.<br />
The loss of Mao Tse-Tung will be deeply mourned by the Chinese<br />
people. I have publicly expressed, on behalf of the Australian<br />
people, my sympathy for their loss, and was first to sign the<br />
Book of Condolence in Canberra. The Australian Ambassador in<br />
Peking has laid wreaths as a formal act of condolence. I am<br />
sure this House would wish to place on record its sympathy for<br />
the Chinese people in their loss. 2. </p>
<p>2.<br />
I therefore move that this House record its sincere<br />
regret at the death of Chairman Mao-Tse-Tung,<br />
expresses to the people of China profound regret and<br />
tenders its deep sympathy to his family in their bereavement.<br />
