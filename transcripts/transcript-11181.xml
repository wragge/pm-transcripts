<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, under the new Ministerial arrangements Mr Mark</p>
<p> Vaile will become the Minister for Trade to replace Mr Fischer. Warren</p>
<p> Truss will be promoted into the Cabinet to take over Mr Vaile's</p>
<p> current portfolio of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forests. And Larry</p>
<p> Anthony will be joining the Ministry as Minister for Community Services.</p>
<p> In addition, Senator Ron Boswell, the Leader of the National Party</p>
<p> in the Senate will be appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister</p>
<p> for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson. These are the only</p>
<p> changes that are being made to the Ministry. They are sensible changes.</p>
<p> Mr Vaile will be an energetic Trade Minister. The appointment of Larry</p>
<p> Anthony means that in the one century three generations of the Anthony</p>
<p> family have served as Ministers of the Crown in the Federal Government</p>
<p> of Australia. I congratulate Mr Anthony and Mr Truss and Senator Boswell,</p>
<p> in particular, on their promotions and also, of course, Mr Vaile who's</p>
<p> not only the new Minister for Trade but he's also the new Deputy</p>
<p> Leader of the National Party of Australia.</p>
<p>These changes will be formalised on the 20th of July. The</p>
<p> new Ministers will be sworn in in Canberra on the 20th</p>
<p> of July following a Cabinet meeting that day. Mr Fischer will act</p>
<p> as Prime Minister during my absence overseas which occurs in a few</p>
<p> minutes time and will continue as Acting Prime Minister until his</p>
<p> formal resignation from the Ministry and as Deputy Prime Minister</p>
<p> of Australia when I return on the 18th of July. I think</p>
<p> these appointments will be widely welcomed particularly in the rural</p>
<p> community. They strike the right balance. And Mr Vaile will become</p>
<p> a very effective part of the Foreign Affairs and Trade team joining</p>
<p> Mr Downer who is Minister for Foreign Affairs. Anybody have any questions?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think Mark Vaile will be known as the reluctant Trade Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't think so. I think there's been a little bit</p>
<p> of over interpretation of what he said at the press conference last</p>
<p> Thursday. I think what Mark was wanting to indicate was that he wasn't</p>
<p> in a hurry to get out of agriculture. He'd got rather used to</p>
<p> it. He enjoyed the job. He was doing it well. He was never as reluctant</p>
<p> to be Trade Minister as people suggested. Mr Anderson and I talked</p>
<p> about the matter yesterday and John said, having reflected on it,</p>
<p> he felt that the right thing to do was for Mark to be appointed as</p>
<p> Trade Minister and I accepted Mr Anderson's recommendation. It</p>
<p> was always going to be a National Party Ministry. That's in the</p>
<p> nature of the Coalition arrangement. Mark was never disinterested</p>
<p> it's just that he rather liked being Agriculture Minister. And</p>
<p> I know what it's like when you get a new Ministry and you're</p>
<p> in it for a few months, you grow accustomed to its face and you rather</p>
<p> like hanging on to it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And it didn't concern you that it took a number of days to finalise</p>
<p> that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, what, three or four days. And you've got to bear in mind,</p>
<p> Raphael, that the arrangements, the new arrangements, don't come</p>
<p> into force until the 20th of July. It's not as if</p>
<p> we've been without a Trade Minister since Mr Fischer announced</p>
<p> his resignation. He's still the Trade Minister. And I should</p>
<p> tell you that at two minutes past seven this morning he was on the</p>
<p> phone to me at Kirribilli House reporting on his latest discussion</p>
<p> with Mrs Barshefsky about our lamb exports to the United States and</p>
<p> also giving me an update in relation to the future occupancy of the</p>
<p> director-generalship of the World Trade Organisation. So, we still</p>
<p> have a very active Trade Minister in Tim Fischer until the 20th</p>
<p> of July and I'm sure that he'll be extremely active as Acting</p>
<p> Prime Minister while I'm out of the country.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, what will be your main objective in Japan?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>My main objectives will be to, I guess, reinforce with the Japanese</p>
<p> Government the importance of the bilateral relationship, to encourage</p>
<p> a recommitment by Japan to the free trade goals of APEC. We agreed</p>
<p> two years ago with the Japanese that there would be a Prime Minister</p>
<p> to Prime Minister meeting each year. We had one briefly last year</p>
<p> in Kuala Lumpur. I'm going to Japan this year and I hope that</p>
<p> in the nature of things it will be possible for the Japanese Prime</p>
<p> Minister to come to Australia the following year. Japan is still our</p>
<p> best customer and it's a relationship that must be kept in good</p>
<p> repair. It is in good repair. And I want to drive home to the Japanese,</p>
<p> while I'm there, how important we regard their continued association</p>
<p> with us both at a trading, a political and a people-to-people level.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does it concern you at all that John Anderson wasn't elected</p>
<p> unanimously by his party and Mark Vaile was? Did that speak to you</p>
<p> of any disquiet within the Coalition?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>When Malcolm Fraser was elected Leader of the Coalition in the Liberal</p>
<p> Party in 1975 he wasn't elected unanimously, in fact, there's</p>
<p> only been to my knowledge three cases in the last 40 years that people</p>
<p> have been elected leaders of their party when there's been a</p>
<p> change like that unanimously and - when I became Leader of the Liberal</p>
<p> Party in '95, I think Bob Hawke was elected unanimously Leader</p>
<p> of the Labor Party in 1983, Harold Holt as Leader of the Liberal Party</p>
<p> in 1966. Off-hand I can't think of any other. Doug Anthony and</p>
<p> Ian Sinclair had a contest for the leadership of the Party when Jack</p>
<p> McEwen went. I don't think anybody could say that Anthony's</p>
<p> leadership of the National Party from 1971 to 1983 was in any way</p>
<p> destabilised by the fact that he had to win a contest. It's a</p>
<p> democracy and you have contests in democracies. I don't think</p>
<p> that's an issue at all. I mean, I don't even know whether</p>
<p> that story's true. I mean, I'm never told these things.</p>
<p> They're matters for the National Party Room but if it is true,</p>
<p> so what. It's a contest. He won it convincingly and he'll</p>
<p> go on to be a very good leader and I'm sure that he'll have</p>
<p> the very strong support of his Party.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, on a separate matter, have you seen reports of the latest</p>
<p> Naltrexone study that says it's not effective in treating addiction?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I've seen a brief report. I haven't had any independent</p>
<p> advice about it, therefore, I don't think I'm in a position</p>
<p> at the moment to comment. Thanks.</p>
