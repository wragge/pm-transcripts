    <content><![CDATA[<p>CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY </p>
<p>When I was your age, learning about science, I sometimes found it confusing - like learning about the law of gravity. I mean, it's really important, because if we didn't have gravity, when birds died, they'd just stay right up there; and if time didn't move forward, you could get stuck in the classroom at school forever and the holidays would never come; and if it wasn't for nuclear science, Homer Simpson would never have found a job.</p>
<p>You know, I might not have been the best science student in school, but I did learn one very valuable lesson after a year 8 chemistry experiment that I still remember to this day - never, ever lick the spoon!</p>
<p>I acknowledge the First Australians on whose land we meet, and whose cultures we celebrate as among the oldest continuing cultures in human history.</p>
<p>And I'd like to say a big hello to the children who are here today, from:</p>
<p>     * St Bede's Primary School; and</p>
<p>     * Campbell Primary School.</p>
<p>And joining us through the wonders of science by video conference:</p>
<p>     * Windsor Public School</p>
<p>     * Biraban Public School</p>
<p>     * Gresford Public School</p>
<p>     * Peak Hill Central School;</p>
<p>     * Thornton Public School;</p>
<p>     * Shellharbour Public School;</p>
<p>     * Broken Hill School of the Air; and</p>
<p>     * Crawford Public School.</p>
<p>This is a very exciting day indeed - not only do we get to honour a very special guest but some of us got to hold some gigantic shoelaces. If the size of that shoelace is any indication, imagine how big those shoes must be!</p>
<p>Today we are here for a very important reason - to congratulate Professor Elizabeth Blackburn, who has been awarded the most prestigious science award in the world - the Nobel Prize for Medicine.</p>
<p>Professor Blackburn is the 11th Australian Nobel Prize winner and the first Australian woman to receive the award. I know I speak on behalf of all Australians, Professor Blackburn, when I say that we are very proud of you.</p>
<p>I think everyone should put their hands together and give Professor Blackburn a big round of applause.</p>
<p>We have just learnt a bit about Professor Blackburn's discoveries about telomeres. Telomeres might be small - and hard to pronounce - but they are very important for how our bodies work, and in the future, they are going to be very important as scientists like Professor Blackburn look for a cure for cancer.</p>
<p>Of course, Professor Blackburn has also won other awards for her work. On Australia Day this year, she was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia, and back in 1998 she won what is now known as the Prime Minister's Prize for Science.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, nominations for the 2010 Prime Minister's Prize for Science open today. In addition to the prize for the best scientist, we also have prizes for the best physical scientist, the best life scientist, and the best teachers in primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how Professor Blackburn first got interested in science? Because of one of her teachers, Nancy Hughes, a teacher whom she credits with igniting the passion for science back in her days at school in Launceston in Tasmania.</p>
<p>Having a good science teacher is very important for making children interested in science - and making sure that Australia continues to produce great scientists.</p>
<p>Australians have been responsible for many discoveries and inventions that we benefit from today.</p>
<p>Who here likes the internet? One of the technologies of wireless internet called WiFi was invented by an Australian team, led by a man called Dr John O'Sullivan.</p>
<p>Who here likes money? Australian scientists worked out how to make bank notes from polymer - which not only makes them much harder to counterfeit, but much more likely to survive a trip through the washing machine when you leave a $5 note in your pocket.</p>
<p>If Australians are going to make important discoveries and inventions in the future, we are going to need more children like you to study science.</p>
<p>Who here would like to find out what dinosaurs ate by studying fossilised dinosaur vomit? Who here would like to make Mitchell Johnson bowl faster or make sure Matt Giteau doesn't pull his quad muscle again? Who here would like to invent a paint that repairs itself when it gets scratched? Who here would like to find a cure for homework?</p>
<p>I'm not sure about that last one, but these are the types of things scientists are working on right now.</p>
<p>One of the great ways that we promote science around the country is National Science Week. It is held each year in August and reaches over a million Australians through more than 1,000 events.</p>
<p>Today the Innovation Minister announced $500,000 in Australian Government grants for National Science Week 2010. This money will go to schools, community groups, scientific societies, research organisations and others who - like me - are passionate about science.</p>
<p>They will use the money to support projects in every state and territory that demonstrate not just how important science is, but also how much fun it can be.</p>
<p>The CSIRO will take its Great Big Science Gig rock-cabaret to regional and metropolitan centres around the country. It shows how developments in science are making a real difference to our everyday lives.</p>
<p>The SCINEMA Festival of Science Film will see a program of short films about science and natural history screened in 400 venues throughout Australia. Screenings will be introduced by local scientists, who will give their own take on where the world of science is heading.</p>
<p>These are the sort of practical things we can do to make science more fun.</p>
<p>Another important part of making science fun is where we are now - Questacon. I'd like to thank all the people at Questacon for the effort they put into science education and awareness. Last year, more than 400,000 children and their families visited this building, and Questacon took outreach programs to 1,367 schools in all Australian states and territories. We need to get out into those remote areas because our next Elizabeth Blackburn may be in outback Australia.</p>
<p>Australia's future prosperity is dependent upon the knowledge and skills developed and attitudes fostered in our young people. The curious young minds - that we can all play a part in nurturing - will lead us through the challenges of the 21st century, and those curious minds need look no further than Professor Elizabeth Blackburn for inspiration.</p>
<p>Professor Blackburn, may I once again congratulate you on your achievement and thank you for your unwavering commitment to your mission.</p>
