SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
AT THE OPENING OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS AND<br />
INQUIRY CENTRE, PITT STREET, SYDNEY, FRIDAY 26 APRIL 1974<br />
One of the great themes that led to the election of the<br />
Australian Labor Party in 1972 was the need for a new openness in<br />
Government. For too long before we came into office, Australian<br />
Governments had operated on the assumption that they knew best,<br />
that the people had no right to be kept fully informed of their<br />
activities. For too long Government decisions had been taken against<br />
a background of secrecy. The people weren't given the facts to<br />
enable them to judge adequately the worth or otherwise of official<br />
decisions which could have momentous, and even tragic, results<br />
for the community. No issue has symbolised this failure in the last<br />
decade more than Vietnam. The people weren't told the whole truth<br />
about this bloody and mistaken war. Yet despite the absence of<br />
Government honesty and frankness, their sons were sent to fight<br />
in that quagmire, to be wounded-and some cases killed.<br />
The failure to communicate with the people took many other<br />
forms. All too often, our predecessors suppressed documents and<br />
reports on which their actions were based, all too often they delayed<br />
the publication of these documents for into intolerable periods.<br />
Their purpose was clear: to prevent the people from having a<br />
proper chance to evaluate their performance.<br />
My party, my Government has been determined to reverse<br />
the secret practices of the past. In my policy speech in 1972 I said:<br />
" We want the Australian people to know the facts, to khow the needs,<br />
to know the choices before them. We want them always to help us as<br />
a government to make the decisions and to make the right decisions."<br />
To achieve this objective, I pledged that a key channel for<br />
communication between the Parliament and the people would be a number<br />
of expert commissions making regular reports and recommendations<br />
on new spending. I made it clear that we would promptly publish<br />
their findings, so that all interested people could know what was<br />
proposed and comment upon those proposals.<br />
On this, as on the rest of the program which I outlined<br />
in my 1972 policy speech, the Government has sought to do what it<br />
promised. In the last 17 months, a number of special bodies have<br />
been established to examine and deal with the needs of Australia<br />
and Australians over a wide range of activities. The Schools Commission,<br />
for example, has been the agent for the transformation of education<br />
in Australia. The Hospitals and Health Services Commission has<br />
provided a framework for a new Commonwealth involvement to meet the<br />
health needs of the community. The Social Welfare Commission has<br />
begun the mammoth task of meeting and co-ordinating social services<br />
throughout the country. As these and other new bodies have reported<br />
to the Government, we have promptly tabled their findings in the<br />
Parliament. We have made it possible for the people to be fully aware<br />
of their recommendations and the reasons behind them. In the first<br />
year alone, 39 reports on inquiries instituted by the Government were<br />
presented to the Parliament, not including reports from Parliamentary<br />
Committees or reports on inquiries instituted by the previous<br />
government. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
We have proved ourselves as the first Government in a<br />
generation to be frank with the people. We have been the first<br />
Government in a generation to share our decisions and the reasons<br />
for them openly with the whole community. We pledge to continue<br />
on that path, to persevere in the creation of a new tradition of<br />
openness in Government.<br />
In the last week our opponents have suddenly discovered<br />
the words " open government". This discovery has come in the midst<br />
of their rush to produce a brace of policies so that they can pretend<br />
that they have a coherent program. Their spokesmen have promised<br />
that they would publish " wherever practicable" reports, reviews<br />
and other materials concerning Government decisions. Just what does<br />
" wherever practicable" mean? On their past performance it would<br />
mean nothing more than that they would publish such documents only<br />
when it suited their purpose, only when they would face no embarrassment,<br />
only when their decisions had been made and foisted on the community.<br />
I defy anyone to believe that such words have any more meaning,<br />
coming from the same men who suppressed one Government report for<br />
years. In 1958 the Liberal-Country Party Government received the<br />
report of the Morshead Committee on the re-organisation of the<br />
Defence group of departments. A succession of Liberal-Country Party<br />
leaders refused to publish that report. It was finally tabled on<br />
the 30th May 1973 by the Labor Minister for Defence. The parties<br />
that talk so much about the defence needs of Australia weren't prepared<br />
to share with the public vital documents on the administrative needs<br />
of this area. The parties who now expect you to believe that they<br />
want open government for 15 years cloaked that report in secrecy. They<br />
are no more credible when they talk of open government than they are<br />
when they pull out of the hat any of their other hasty and<br />
ill-considered policies.<br />
The only Government that can be trusted when it makes such<br />
a pledge is the present one. It made that pledge 17 months ago and<br />
it has stood by it. If people want the opportunity to share knowledge<br />
and information with the National Government, they have only to give<br />
us a fair chance to continue to honour that pledge.<br />
Open government, of course, must mean more than simply<br />
tabling documents in Parliament and then printing them. It is<br />
vital to our democracy that that be done. But we must go further than<br />
that. The present Government has recognised that there are many<br />
interested and concerned people who will still never have the chance<br />
to see and study those documents if we do not give them wider<br />
dissemination. Many people are not familiar enough with the processes<br />
of Government to know how to get a copy of a government report if it<br />
is only available in Canberra. We want to ensure that Government<br />
publications are not confined to the highly educated, the highly<br />
informed or people with established contacts with Government. If a<br />
Government publication is of interest to any person or group, then the<br />
access to that person or group to that document should not depend on<br />
education or wealth or influence. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Similarly, in areas beyond publications, we want to<br />
enable all people to know what the Government is doing, to know<br />
what services are available to them. It is no use if the Government<br />
provides a service and no-one is aware of its existence. Our<br />
predecessors' Health Insurance Subsidy Scheme for low-income earners<br />
is an excellent example of a service of which the very people whom<br />
it was supposed to help overwhelmingly remained ignorant. The<br />
subsidy was supposed to be available; only 4 in every 100 people<br />
who should have been eligible for it received any benefit from it..<br />
That is the importance of this Government P ublications<br />
and Inquiries Centre. By establishing the Centre the Government is<br />
taking the initiative to provide readily accessible means for people<br />
to know what it is doing.<br />
The necessity of getting government to the people is not<br />
unique to Australia. Britain tackled it during the last war by<br />
establishing Citizens Advice Bureaux, Canada has for several years<br />
had a network of regional Inquiry Centres; the United States has<br />
information centres operating in major cities. So last year when<br />
the Australian Government approved a proposal of the Minister for<br />
the Media ( Senator Douglas McClelland) to set up Publications and<br />
Inquiry Centres in the cities and main provincial areas, it was<br />
answering a need to bridge a knowledge gap of Australians.<br />
It should be clear that this centre fulfills two separate<br />
functions. Publications of the Australian Government are sold here<br />
at the lowest price to clear only overheads and publishing costs.<br />
The bookshops are also selling agents for the publications of other<br />
governments. The Inquiry Centre is a different matter. It provides<br />
services free. The public is invited to submit enquiries personally<br />
or by telephone about any aspect of Australian Government activity.<br />
It is not expected that final answers may be provided for all questions<br />
at the centre. Many of the simpler ones can be dealt with on the spot,<br />
but where specialised knowledge is required the inquiry officer will<br />
ref er to an appropriate contact of ficer in the Department concerned f or<br />
the answer. Should the inquiry be more complex, a Central Reference<br />
Unit which is being established in Canberra will search out the<br />
information and return it back to the Inquiry Office by telex or<br />
telephone. The first publications and inquiry office began operating<br />
last year in Canberra. Since then Adelaide and Perth have been added.<br />
After Sydney will come Brisbane, Hobart, Melbourne and Darwin. They<br />
will be extended to the major provincial areas including Albury-<br />
Wodonga, Newcastle, Wollongong, and Townsville. Until these<br />
provincial centres are established, mobile bookshops and Inquiry Centres<br />
are being commissioned to tour rural areas. The first is ready for the<br />
road now. Some of the capital cities including Sydney and Melbourne<br />
have had Government Bookshops for up to six years. But until now they<br />
have not been street level operations designed to engender the<br />
greatest public interest. The relocated shops have immediately shown<br />
sales increases of between 150 and 250 per cent. This alone points<br />
up the need of the public for better access to Government affairs. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
The inquiry function is also being widely utilised. The<br />
established centres are each already handling more than 30 inquiries<br />
daily and when fully operative the network is expected to deal with<br />
over half a million requests for information by telephone,<br />
correspondence or personal applications in a year.<br />
This new Centre will provide the public in Sydney with<br />
a convenient point of initial contact and is real evidence of our<br />
initiatives towards open government. </p>
