OPENING OF ADDITIONS TO WAVERLEY CHRISTLN<br />
BROTHERS COLLEGE SYDNEY ON<br />
OCTOIER, 1963<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt, Hon., Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Mr. Chairman, My Lord Bishop, Mr. Headraster, Your Honours,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, Boys, and in particular, Captain Bernard<br />
Jones, the Captain of the School<br />
As I am constantly being warned that the habit of<br />
speech grows on a man as he gets older and that he therefore<br />
sometimes forgets I at once declare these building additions<br />
open. ( Laughter) ( Applause)<br />
The next thing that I want to say to you is that<br />
my friend, Mr. Robson, so justly described as one of the great<br />
headmasters, has expressed some embarrassment at being with<br />
me speechmaking for the fourth time. I can assure him that the<br />
embarrassment is reciprocal. ( Laughter) We are joint brothers<br />
in misery: He has listened to i: 2e four times and I have had to<br />
listen to him. The only difference between us is that he is<br />
usually present because he has persuaded a great number of<br />
businessmen to get rid of a great deal of money in a good cause<br />
and I an here in my dubious, ambiguous capacity as a politician<br />
who, from time to time, is the enemy of all mankind. ( Laughter)<br />
But, Sir it must be said for me and I would like<br />
to say particularly to the boys that, contrary to all your<br />
expectation after my npny years in public affiars I still<br />
retain a considerable trace of Christian spirit because I<br />
have been sitting here on the dais next to an old boy of St.<br />
Patrick's College in Ballarat. St. Patrick's College in<br />
Ballarat a school which, when I was in the football team<br />
a kind of football you don't understand ( Laughter) for another<br />
school much smaller, inflicted on us the greatest thrashing in<br />
the history of football in my State. I hesitate to tell you<br />
what they scored, All I know is that we didn't score at all.<br />
( Laughter) And every time I meet a distinguished old boy of<br />
St. Patrick's College, I find myself looking at him and saying<br />
" Should I be nice to this chap, or shouldn't and the fact<br />
that I am says something for me that you might not have supposed<br />
to exist. Now, Sir I of course, as you have been reminded,<br />
have a tremendous interest in education in Australia, I,<br />
myself, am the half-etc-cated product of a series of scholastic<br />
institutions. I began my life learning if you may so describe<br />
it in a little country State school with about thirty or<br />
forty children in it. I then went to a much larger one in a<br />
much larger town and then I went to a secondary school which was,<br />
in effect, privately conducted, and then I went to what you call<br />
a great public school in Melbourne and then to a university.<br />
So that I may claim to have seen the educational process at<br />
various levels and in various ways and out of it all, I have<br />
come, firmly persuaded, as His Lordship the Bishop has just<br />
stated to you as his own view, that there is no greater<br />
superstition in the world than the idea that all education<br />
has to be uniform and uniformly conducted.<br />
One of our dangers in a democracy is this passion<br />
for everything being uniform. We must all be the same as the<br />
next man. I am all for us all having the same rights as the<br />
next man but I am not a bit in favour of being the same as the<br />
o e </p>
<p>-2<br />
next man. Heaven forbid that we should all be exactly the same<br />
type of people with the sane body of ideas, with the same formal<br />
educational equipment in our own minds as if in some sense this<br />
would mean that we would all think the same. If anybody in<br />
Australia thinks that everybody thinks the same because everybody<br />
is in a democracy, he'll have a great disillusionment on November<br />
( Laughter) Now, Sir, this is, I think, the basic truth: We<br />
must not get into this deplorable habit of thinking that there<br />
is virtue in uniformity for its own sake, This is not to<br />
criticise the State forms of education. I am, of all people,<br />
their beneficiary. But this is merely to say that the greater<br />
the variety that we have, the greater the versatility of our<br />
educational system, the more people are encouraged to choose<br />
the school that they want for their children, the better for<br />
all of us. ( Applause) Of course, Mr. Chairman, this is something<br />
that goes deep. We have heard. today, very properly, words about<br />
science, the importance of science in the world. Of course,<br />
tremendously important increasingly important, but it would be<br />
a strange world wouldn't it in which we were all scientists,<br />
a strange world in which we had forgotten that, after all, the<br />
proper study of mankind is man, the relations between man and<br />
nan, the relations between man and his Maker. All these great<br />
humane studies which, of course, could co-exist with science, are<br />
not to be forgotten. Education is, in its nature, an all-round<br />
business. The humanists must learn more about science and, if<br />
I may say so, the scientists must learn more about the humanities,<br />
otherwise we may get to the stage, of course, of becoming so<br />
scientific, so knowledgeable on God's creations that we begin<br />
to think we know all about God. This is a cardinal error,<br />
Now, a school like this, a school like the one I<br />
went to in Melbourne; other schools the school that Mro Robson<br />
conducted with such distinction such schools have a double<br />
aim. Those aims should produce the highest level of education,<br />
meaning by that not only the acquiring of knowledge vastly<br />
important as that is, not only the acquiring of accurate habits<br />
of thought, rare and splendid as they may be, not only the<br />
acquiring of habits of courtesy and tolerance and understanding,<br />
but also realising all through that we are not here today and<br />
gone tomorrow we are not a mere dusty phenomenon that will be<br />
blown away but that we have solme of the stuff of immortality in<br />
us0 When I say that I don't mean just reputation or something<br />
of that kind, but some of the stuff of the spirit, something that<br />
is based upon the whole religious feeling that we have and the<br />
religious background against which we do our work. This is<br />
tremendously important. Sir, if you didn't believe this, this<br />
school wouldn't be here0 If other people didn't believe it,<br />
other great and famous schools would not be here. These schools<br />
do not, this great school does not exist just in order to<br />
indicate that it is a bit superior to the firm next door. Not<br />
at all. It is here because the parents who send their boys here<br />
want something more than ordinary lay education. ( Applause)<br />
They want some background.<br />
Sir, I must tell you and perhaps Mr. Robson has<br />
heard me say this before I hope he has a faulty memory but<br />
when the war ended, I was at that time in that strange place they<br />
call politically, " the wilderness". You may know what it means.<br />
But I had one idea in my mind which turned out to be utterly<br />
wrong. I thought that with all the tremendous rates of taxation<br />
that then existed, necessarily so for the conduct of the war, 000/ 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
with all thlat, wouldn't it be terribly difficult for people to<br />
send their children to schools where they have to pay fees for<br />
them and make some sacrifice for them; wouldntt this mean that<br />
the great number of schools n-) w well knoinwould feel the pinch<br />
and tend to disappear? I couldn't have been more wrong. It is<br />
one of the most astonishing things in post-war history in<br />
AUstralia that these schools, about whose future I was nervous,<br />
before long had waiting lists, before long began to expand and<br />
expand. Why, I noticed on the back of the programme today a<br />
very very interesting figure ' Waverley College was opened in<br />
January, 1903 with a roll call of twentytwo pupils, Twentytwo<br />
and it now has 1,420 and so magnetic obviously has been the work<br />
that it has done thal a distinguished Judge is able to get up<br />
and announce the completion of an enterprise running into<br />
what did he say? Å“ C390,000. This, I think, is one of the<br />
great phenomena of the post-war era, a wonderful thing, I have<br />
had a good deal to do with it on the university side as you<br />
know, and a little to do with taxation remissions ana~ so on,<br />
on donations to schools, but the whole essence of this thing<br />
has been that people have been able and willing and when I<br />
say able, I know what sacr'ifices are involved in this to give<br />
to their children that form of education which they regard as<br />
best here and best in eternity. This is something tremendou~ s,<br />
I am proud of a country that has done it. I am proud of peqple<br />
who can work to produce a result like this. ( Applause)<br />
Sir, I have a singular pleasure in being here.<br />
I am sorry my wife is not haere but as you may have heard by<br />
countesy of the press we now have a tenth grandchild. ( Applause)<br />
I thought for a raomenz a little earlier that somiebody wanted'<br />
mie to adopt an eleventh. ( Laughter) If you know my wife as<br />
well as I do, you will know that she is a tremendous grandmother<br />
and so for a variety of reasons, my daughter coming back~ last<br />
evening from hospital, she decided she couldn't come but her<br />
heart is with me. She shares rmy views on these matters<br />
( Applause) and therefore it is a great thing, a pleasant thing<br />
for me to have been able to declare open this building and<br />
express my hope that it will for many many years to come serve<br />
both God and man in this city. </p>
