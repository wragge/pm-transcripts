PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 2 JULY 1990<br />
JOINT PRIME MINT TERTAL STATEMENT<br />
Joint Statement by the Prime Minister of Australia, the<br />
Honourable Bob Hawke and the Prime Minister of New Zealand,<br />
the Right Honourable Geoffrey Palmer.<br />
THE ACHIEVEMENTS<br />
We are meeting today to mark a milestone in the development<br />
of the CER Agreement.<br />
This Agreement plays a major role in ensuring that our two<br />
economies are well placed to compete in the most dynamic<br />
economic region in the world. It has contributed to the<br />
progress made in restructuring our economies. Over 21<br />
million consumers benefit through access to a wider range of<br />
goods in a more competitive market.<br />
1 July 1990 is an occasion therefore both for celebration<br />
and for looking ahead. From now on there will be no<br />
barriers to free trade in goods between Australia and New<br />
Zealand. This is some achievement. That it comes five years earlier<br />
than we envisaged when we signed the CER Treaty in 1983<br />
demonstrates the success and strength of the Agreement.<br />
Both countries are benefiting. Since 1983 total bilateral<br />
trade has grown from A$ 1.99 billion ( NZS 2.5 billion) to<br />
billion ( NZ$ 5.6 billion). This is an average annual<br />
growth rate of about 15%. It is faster than the growth in<br />
either country's trade with the rest of the world.<br />
Today, New Zealand is Australia's fourth-largest trading<br />
partner. Australia is New Zealand's largest. Both<br />
countries are significant markets for each other's<br />
manufactured goods. We have become major markets for each<br />
other's services. The balance of trade is roughly equal.<br />
Total trans-Tasman investment has grown from approximately<br />
billion ( NZS2 billion) when the CER Agreement came<br />
into force to over A$ 10 billion ( NZ$ l3 billion) in 1989. </p>
<p>The steps taken under the CER Agreement contribute to the<br />
ability of both countries to compete in the global market.<br />
Our economies are inextricably linked to the international<br />
economy. Our business communities are taking increasing<br />
advantage of export opportunities in the world market,<br />
particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
Under CER both countries have always had more than a<br />
bilateral economic focus. The freeing up of trans-Tasman<br />
trade underpins both countries' efforts in working towards<br />
free and fair trade internationally. our achievements<br />
confirm the determination of both countries to pursue these<br />
multilateral goals.<br />
Our own trading practices clearly demonstrate the benefits<br />
that will be gained through the achievement of that goal in<br />
the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Our<br />
cooperative approach is demonstrated in the constructive and<br />
positive approach both Governments have taken in the Asia<br />
Pacific Economic Cooperation process.<br />
PROGRESS SINCE 1988<br />
We are today in a position to mark a number of agreements<br />
reached during the 1988 Review of CER. specifically as of 1<br />
July: there are no longer border restrictions to trade in<br />
goods across the Tasman; tariffs, quantitative import<br />
and export restrictions, tariff quotas and import<br />
licensing have been removed;<br />
neither Australia nor New Zealand pays export<br />
incentives aimed at stimulating exports to the other at<br />
the expense of domestic industry or production bounties<br />
on exports to the other country;<br />
both countries no longer provide for anti-dumping<br />
measures in respect of goods originating in the other<br />
member state; competition law now applies to relevant<br />
anti-competitive conduct affecting trans-Tasman trade<br />
in goods.<br />
Since the 1988 review and as a result of the arrangements<br />
agreed to in 1988, we have continued to develop CER in a<br />
number of noteworthy ways, aimed at reducing impediments to<br />
trade and at improving our business environment:<br />
we have had free trade for a wide range of trans-Tasman<br />
service exports since 1 January 1989;<br />
New Zealand is now a full member of the National<br />
Preference Agreement, bidding on an equal basis for<br />
Commonwealth and State Government purchasing; Australia<br />
similarly has equal access to the New Zealand<br />
Government purchasing market; </p>
<p>both Governments are taking into account CER<br />
considerations in the formulation of industry<br />
assistance policies in line with the requirements of<br />
the Agreed Minute on Industry Assistance;<br />
a comprehensive review of the scope for business law<br />
harmonisation has identified a number of areas where<br />
harmonisation would be beneficial to our business<br />
communities. As a result of changes made to the<br />
application of our competition laws, it is now possible<br />
for Australian and New Zealand courts to sit and take<br />
evidence in the other's jurisdiction in some<br />
competition law matters;<br />
good progress has been made in aligning standards in<br />
both countries, particularly through the development of<br />
joint standards. The agreement of all the Australian<br />
States to exempt New Zealand food imports from carrying<br />
an Australian address will also help to reduce<br />
technical barriers to trans-Tasman trade;<br />
closer cooperation between the customs agencies of both<br />
countries now makes barrier control more efficient and<br />
has contributed to a harmonisation of policies in this<br />
important area for business;<br />
quarantine authorities have reported on harmonisation<br />
of administrative procedures and have resolved a number<br />
of outstanding bilateral issues;<br />
there has been substantial liberalisation in trans-<br />
Tasman air freight;<br />
New Zealand now attends 22 meetings of<br />
Commonwealth/ State forums.<br />
DECISIONS FOR 1990<br />
We have agreed to take advantage of present opportunities to<br />
extend and underpin the liberal trans-Tasman economic<br />
environment created by the present CER Agreements. The<br />
Tasman will not be a legal, administrative or financial<br />
barrier to the free flow of commerce. our businesses must<br />
be able to operate freely in the other's market place and<br />
under conditions of fair competition. We want Australians<br />
and New Zealanders each to be able to regard the other<br />
economy as an extension of their own. </p>
<p>The CER Trade in Services Protocol is to be reviewed before<br />
31 December 1990. In New Zealand's case, major decisions<br />
have already been taken on deregulation of major service<br />
sectors and these will lead to items being removed from the<br />
New Zealand exemptions list in the context of the Review.<br />
In Australia's case, important service sectors excluded from<br />
the operation of the Protocol, including aviation, shipping<br />
and telecommunications, are now being considered in the<br />
context of micro-economic reform. Australia affirms its<br />
commitment to such reform, and to taking full account of CER<br />
provisions in addressing individual micro-economic reform<br />
issues. We reaffirm that we are committed to the further<br />
liberalisation of trade in services in accordance with the<br />
provisions of the Protocol, including national treatment.<br />
We agree that all services that are regarded, mutually, as<br />
possible to include within the operation of the protocol<br />
shall be included by 1 July 1995; and we have decided that<br />
the scheduled review in December 1990 be developed<br />
accordingly. We have both acknowledged that an Australasian market in air<br />
Rprndpe warrants serious consideration. To this end, both<br />
Governments are participating in a joint study of the<br />
implications for the consumers, airlines and economies of<br />
Australia and New Zealand of a single aviation market. The<br />
results of the study will shortly be available for our<br />
consideration, and will be the focus of consultations later<br />
this year to chart a course for future progress.<br />
In this context we agree that an appropriate investment<br />
regime is an integral consideration. On the question of<br />
allowable investment levels in Australian domestic carriers<br />
by individual foreign international carriers operating into<br />
and out of Australia, the Australian Government will review<br />
the limit for these foreign airline operators of 15 per cent<br />
in the context of wider aviation policy issues, including<br />
the programme of micro-economic reform of aviation.<br />
In the area of trans-Tasman air freight, both Governments<br />
now accept the multiple designation of pure freight<br />
operators to fly the Tasman without any constraint on the<br />
capacity to be operated. New Zealand has already designated<br />
Pacific Air Freight and for its part Australia will be<br />
designating two new carriers in the first instance.<br />
We have also agreed that our respective officials should<br />
report to us by 1 October 1990 on the feasibility of<br />
achieving trans-Tasman passenger pre-clearance.<br />
We also discussed the maritime t7rangpnrt sector, noting the<br />
positive trends in recent years arising from waterfront and<br />
shipping reforms as well as market initiatives. At the same<br />
time, most CER commerce continues to be reserved, under a<br />
Maritime Union Accord, to Australian and New Zealand crewed<br />
ships. </p>
<p>0 Our Governments regard competitive shipping services as<br />
vital to the trade between Australia and New Zealand. We<br />
expect that the benefits of shipping and waterfront reform<br />
programs and initiatives in both countries should produce<br />
further significant reductions in costs in the trans-Tasman<br />
trade and consider it is important that the benefits flow<br />
through to exporters and consumers. Reducing shipping costs<br />
on the Tasman to at least OECD levels by mid-1992 is a<br />
common objective of our respective reform programs.<br />
Meanwhile, if necessary, New Zealand will take steps to<br />
provide shippers and carriers with legal remedies<br />
complementary to those already provided under the Australian<br />
Trade Practices Act.<br />
There will be consultations at Ministerial level with<br />
Australian and New Zealand trade union leaders as we address<br />
the development of trans-Tasman shipping.<br />
Governments will continue to assess costs, freight rates and<br />
levels of service of trans-Tasman shipping to determine what<br />
further measures may be necessary to improve efficiency and<br />
competition in the trade. Trans-Tasman shipping policy will<br />
be reviewed in parallel with the full review of CER in 1992.<br />
It is expected that the reviews relating to the development<br />
of telecommunicatin policy which are before the Australian<br />
Government and the review of the three carriers will result<br />
in opportunities for increased competition. New Zealand<br />
will have the opportunity to make an input to the review<br />
process. A common commercial environment is a vital ingredient of a<br />
free trade area. The continuing program of business law<br />
harmnnigation has an important role to play in working<br />
towards this objective. We have now received the report<br />
called for under the 1988 Memorandum of Understanding on the<br />
harmonisation of business law. This report identifies ways<br />
in which harmonisation would be beneficial. Cross<br />
recognition of companies and enforcement of court orders are<br />
two areas in which we can envisage early action on the<br />
matters identified in the report. Harmonising our business<br />
laws would mean that in those areas we would no longer treat<br />
each other as foreigners. This same principle would apply<br />
when areas of potential harmonisation such as fund-raising<br />
and registration of company charges are further examined.<br />
We have agreed that the harmonisation process should be<br />
pursued vigorously. The dynamic nature of international<br />
business practice and our ongoing law reform programs<br />
underline the need for increased exchanges between us. To<br />
this end the existing consultations between our Government<br />
and with our respective business communities will be<br />
extended to cover the implementation of the harmonisation<br />
opportunities identified in the report. Progress on<br />
harmnonisation will be reviewed in the course of 1992 CER<br />
review. </p>
<p>6.<br />
On quarantiñ ne we have received the reports called for under<br />
the Protocol on Harmonisation of Quarantine Administrative<br />
Procedures. Both Governments have established high-level<br />
consultative structures to ensure appropriate quarantine<br />
safeguards, while minimising technical barriers to trans-<br />
Tasman trade.<br />
Considerable progress has been made towards harmonisation,<br />
including resolving access for particular products. Both<br />
our countries have devoted substantial technical and<br />
administrative resources to this end. There is concern in<br />
some industry groups that the harmonisation program may<br />
lower agricultural quarantine security. Such concern is<br />
unfounded. Measures in place provide a sound technical<br />
basis for quarantine decision-making.<br />
On futurp global tariff levAls, both Australia and New<br />
Zealand have clearly demonstrated their commitment to<br />
overall reductions in protection, with a view to creating<br />
more internationally competitive economies. New Zealand has<br />
decided on further reductions in global tariff rates for the<br />
period to 1996 and Australia will be taking decisions on its<br />
post-1992 global tariff arrangements shortly. The<br />
Australian Government will take New Zealand's alreadyannounced<br />
plans into account in reaching its decision on<br />
post-1992 arrangements, keeping in mind the advantage of<br />
both countries taking a broadly similar approach to tariff<br />
reductions.<br />
We have discussed certain industry assist-anrce measures which<br />
have caused concern about their impact on fair competition<br />
between Australia and New Zealand manufacturers. We have<br />
agreed on a timetable to address the issue of export<br />
facilitation on motor vehicle exports to New Zealand. This<br />
will be dealt with early in 1991 in the context of<br />
Australia's review of future motor vehicle policy.<br />
Discussions will continue about other industry assistance<br />
measures. On the question of trans-Tasman investment few practical<br />
impediments to our bilateral investment remain in either<br />
country. We note that the total level of trans-Tasman<br />
investment has grown by over A$ 8.5 billion [ NZ$ 11.3 billion]<br />
since the CER Agreement was signed, an increase of 680 per<br />
cent since 1983. We both affirm the importance of free<br />
investment flows in supporting the significant benefits<br />
resulting from the liberalisation we have undertaken in the<br />
area of goods and foresee in regard to the services trade.<br />
The Governments have consulted on ways of ensuring that<br />
investment flows are subject to minimum constraint, now and<br />
in the future. We have reviewed our practices and agreed we<br />
will continue to have full regard for CER benefits as an<br />
important national interest consideration in evaluating each<br />
other's investment applications. </p>
<p>7.<br />
Both Governments are committed to fostering the current<br />
favourable climate for trans-Tasman investment. We will<br />
continue to consult to this end and in any event have agreed<br />
to consult as necessary about any difficulties that might<br />
arise regarding investment.<br />
LONG TERM ISSUES<br />
We are committed to the continued deepening and broadening<br />
of the trans-Tasman relationship in both its economic and<br />
wider dimensions.<br />
The-next-major review of the CER Agreement is due in 1992.<br />
We agree that this review holds some exciting prospects, as<br />
the further integration of our economies proceeds. This has<br />
implications beyond the purely economic. The two<br />
Governments will take a leading role in considering future.<br />
developments, against a background of informed public<br />
discussion about the bilateral relationship and its<br />
institutions. We have therefore nominated Ministers to oversee<br />
preparations for the review. By 31 March 1991 they will<br />
bring forward recommendations to Governments so that<br />
substantive bilateral negotiations can begin in the middle<br />
of the year. We will tap the skills, experience and views<br />
of people active in the relationship, including business<br />
people, unions and professional associations. The aim of<br />
the exercise will be to identify and analyse the issues and<br />
to narrow the field down to an agreed agenda of items for<br />
the review.<br />
With the extent of consultation at all relevant policy<br />
levels now substantial, we agree this deepening process of<br />
consultation and cooperation could be further developed<br />
across the range of the bilateral relationship and in<br />
conjunction with the Australian State Governments.<br />
Commonwealth Government ministers will discuss with their<br />
State counterparts in meetings over the next year of<br />
Commonwealth and State sectoral ministers how Australia-New<br />
Zealand cooperation might be further enhanced in their<br />
respective areas. Since there are already arrangements for<br />
New Zealand participation in most of these forums, there<br />
will be ample and welcome opportunity for New Zealand to<br />
contribute. Our commercial future lies in open economies trading with<br />
each other in a free and fair way. We have demonstrated the<br />
benefits that free trade can bring. We intend to build on<br />
that example, on our successes since 1983 and through<br />
concrete action, so that we continue along the path of<br />
liberalisation and integration of our economies. We share<br />
the southern border of the dynamic Asia-Pacific region. Our<br />
bilateral relationship has the strength and durability to<br />
accept the diverse challenges facing us. The challenge<br />
which we now accept is to build on CER's past successes and<br />
to ensure that the Agreement remains both contemporary and<br />
dynamic as we enter the 21st century. </p>
