FOR MEDIA 11 January 1988<br />
My Department has today responded to a Freedom of<br />
Information request which the Leader of the Opposition ' made<br />
on 31 December 1987 about Mr John Brown's resignation.<br />
All documents have been released other than those which are<br />
exempt under the FOI Act. The exempt documents and they<br />
are few relate directly to Cabinet discussions, legal<br />
professional privilege or contain information which is<br />
commercial in confidence. The matters to which the<br />
documents relate have already been aired at length in<br />
public. There are two distinct aspects in these matters. The first<br />
relates to my involvement in the processes that led to AAV<br />
Australia being given the contract in April 1987 to produce<br />
the Australian theatre at Expo. The second relates to the<br />
events in December last year which led to Mr Brown's<br />
resignation. I have made it clear before that my own involvement early in<br />
1987 was simply to ensure that due process was being<br />
followed in the selection of a tender. My attention was<br />
drawn in February 1987 to concerns about the adequacy of the<br />
tender processes related to awarding a contract to produce<br />
the Australian theatre exhibit at Expo. As the Chairman of<br />
Cabinet, I arranged for the matter to be discussd on 24<br />
February. As a result of that discussion Cabinet agreed<br />
that new tenders would be called and assessed by a panel<br />
chaired by an official from the Department of Local<br />
Government and Administrative Services the organisation<br />
responsible for Commonwealth purchases. This was announced<br />
by Mr Brown on 24 February.<br />
Mr Brown told Cabinet on 13 April 1987 about the results of<br />
these new tender processes and that he intended to accept<br />
the recommendation that AAV Australia be given the contract.<br />
He announced this on the same day.<br />
My role in these events, through Cabinet, was to ensure that<br />
the proper tendering processes were followed and this was<br />
done, as the documents clearly show.<br />
The subsequent handling of the matter was properly left to<br />
the Minister and his Department.<br />
The documents also indicate that the 24 February Cabinet<br />
decision made no reference to voting rights of members of<br />
the panel. 003850 </p>
<p>2<br />
In relation to the events in December 1987 leading to Mr<br />
Brown's resignation, the Leader of the Opposition has<br />
claimed that I must have known before newspaper reports on<br />
17 December that Mr Brown had inadvertently misled the House<br />
of Representatives on 10 December. The fact is I did not<br />
know, and the released documents confirm this.<br />
Mr Brown's statement of 10 December was not brought to my<br />
notice until 17 December, nor was my Office or my Department<br />
aware until that day that Mr Brown had inadvertently misled<br />
the House. Moreover, I would not have expected my Office or<br />
my Department to have known unless they were advised by Mr<br />
Brown, his Office or his Department which they were not.<br />
As indicated earlier, the handling of this matter was<br />
properly left with the Minister and his Department once it<br />
was established earlier in the year that due process was<br />
being followed. 003851 </p>
