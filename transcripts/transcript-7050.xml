EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
OPENING OF THE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT<br />
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE<br />
MELBOURNE 2 DECEMBER 1986<br />
John Gough, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Before dinner I had the pleasure of inspecting the building<br />
which will house the Graduate School of Management. I saw<br />
the stunning Arthur Boyd which graces the foyer and I was<br />
shown the impressive teaching and residential facilities<br />
which will, I am sure, make this School a comfortable and<br />
stimulating environment for all who use it.<br />
But John, after formally thanking you for the invitation to<br />
open the School, my first comment must be to praise its<br />
magnificent location: only a tram-ride away from<br />
Melbourne's central business district, yet also part of one<br />
of Australia's finest universities.<br />
To say that the Graduate School of Management is well placed<br />
to take advantage of both the business and the academic<br />
environments is almost a criminal understatement.<br />
This shared environment is a symbol for an important trend<br />
in Australian businesses and universities: academics and<br />
business people are increasingly learning that they must<br />
work together.<br />
The School is the latest in the growing series of links<br />
between universities and the business world links which<br />
are beneficial not just to the academic and commercial<br />
partners themselves but to Australia's whole economic and<br />
intellectual life.<br />
We ' all recognise that servicing the business world should<br />
not be the sole objective of our educational institutions.<br />
Yet there is an urgent need for universities and other<br />
tertiary institutions to complement their pure research and<br />
their study of the humanities with applied work; to share<br />
their skills and insights with the rest of the community and<br />
thereby contribute to solving the problems of contemporary<br />
Au st ral1i a. </p>
<p>I am, of course, not the first person to articulate that<br />
goal. EPAC's report on human capital, the Business<br />
Council's report on work practices, the Kirby Committee of<br />
inquiry into Labor Market Programs and the Ralph Committee<br />
Report have all tackled various aspects of the topic.<br />
Indeed, the Ralph Report was the important trigger in the<br />
decision to establish this Graduate School.<br />
Two nonths ago I addressed a Forum on Business and<br />
University Co-operation sponsored by the Business Council of<br />
Australia and the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee.<br />
Behind that forum was a joint report of those groups which<br />
detailed some of the existing links between business and the<br />
universities such as university-based consulting<br />
companies, liaison and advisory units, and research and<br />
development centres concentrating on industrial<br />
applications. In addition, Australian universities now operate commercial<br />
agencies which act as brokers between their researchers and<br />
companies which can develop, manufacture, and market their<br />
ideas. Melbourne University has produced two of the success<br />
stories: the bionic ear, which could create a $ 50 million<br />
market by 1990, and a new blood test for the detection of<br />
breast cancer.<br />
These links between universitie's and business must be<br />
strengthened. For its part, my Government has been eager to see greater<br />
communication between industry and the Education Department.<br />
The Education Minister, Susan Ryan, is establishing an<br />
Industry Reference Group, which will hold its first meeting<br />
in 2 days time. I believe this Group will lay the<br />
foundations for continuing high-level liaison on future<br />
priorities in education, on industry's concerns about the<br />
education sector and its output, and on ways of improving<br />
the response of the education sector to industry and<br />
employer needs.<br />
In addition, the Standing Committee on Tertiary Education<br />
and Industry Relationships has been established to review<br />
policies concerned with tertiary education and its links<br />
with industry.<br />
All these developments are important because the Australian<br />
economy urgently needs the fruits of co-operation between<br />
business and universities.<br />
Both sides need to do more. Our tertiary institutions must<br />
become more sensitive to the needs of industry. And<br />
Australian employers must improve their record of investment<br />
in research and development and in the application of<br />
technology to Australian needs.<br />
But this Graduate School is a great example of both sides<br />
combining to form an institution which w ' ill have lasting<br />
benefit to themselves and to the whole nation. </p>
<p>We owe a real debt of gratitude to the donors who have<br />
helped create the Graduate School of Management. I note<br />
that some of the people associated with those donations are<br />
here tonight to mark this important occasion. it is fitting<br />
that the theatres, library and other parts of the new School<br />
have been named after the principal donors to honour the<br />
very great assistance they have given.<br />
of ccurse the University of Melbourne itself provided a<br />
substantial grant to the school. And I am proud to state<br />
that half of the $ 9 million cost of the School was borne by<br />
the Federal Government.<br />
In our last Budget we allocated $ 750,000 for the<br />
establishment of a similar management school at Macquarie<br />
University, which will be funded, like this Melbourne<br />
School, jointly with the private sector.<br />
For the task of training managers -is something which for too<br />
long we have done in a hit-and-miss fashion. It's simply no<br />
longer suitable for a country of Australia's economic<br />
complexity to imagine that industrial decision-makers should<br />
receive no formal business training outside their workplace.<br />
Australian managers today are challenged on many fronts.<br />
And lest anyone imagine that we in the Government are not<br />
practicing what we preach about the need for improved<br />
management let me point out to them in passing the success<br />
we have had in our efforts to streamline our own public<br />
service. For I believe that all of us, in the private and the public<br />
sectors, must work to develop a new business style in this<br />
country if we are to take advantage of the opportunities<br />
before us. And I believe institutions such as the Graduate<br />
School of Management have a crucial mission to fulfill in<br />
creating that new style.<br />
But I want on this occasion to mention three of the most<br />
important challenges facing private sector managers<br />
challenges which I trust the School of Management will seek<br />
to address in training the managers of tomorrow.<br />
First, Australian managers must learn to exploit new<br />
markets. I am sure I do not need to tell anyone in this<br />
audience particularly over such a pleasant meal the<br />
nature of the economic problems Australia faces and the<br />
seriousness of the long-term solutions which we must master.<br />
The substantial real depreciation of our currency, in<br />
conjunction with nominal wage restraint, has catapulted<br />
Australian industries into an entirely new market situation.<br />
In particular our manufacturers and our service industries<br />
now have opportunities open to them which previously could<br />
not even be dreamed of. </p>
<p>But the essential point is that those opportunities are<br />
worthless to business, to the country unless managers<br />
are prepared to break out of the security of servicing<br />
traditional markets and seek out and win new sales in<br />
unfamiliar markets.<br />
In many cases that new market will be located in Australia.<br />
Increasingly, however, if the manufacturing and services<br />
sectors are to play their part in Australia's<br />
reconstruction, those markets will need to be found offshore<br />
: in Japan, in the rest of the Western Pacific and, of<br />
course, in the U. S. and Europe.<br />
And in this context I might add that the Asian Studies<br />
Council has been established by the Government to strengthen<br />
education and training about Asia, including management<br />
education. The second challenge is people management. I have long<br />
stressed the virtues of co-operation and consensus in public<br />
life especially compared to the barrenness of<br />
confrontation and division.<br />
That has been the key to our approach to industrial<br />
relations and our economic performance since 1983 but it<br />
also has an important new dimension in meeting Australia's<br />
needs in 1986.<br />
In September I called a unique'mieeting of the peak employer<br />
bodies and the ACTU to discuss the reform of work and<br />
management practices. This task is now urgent it provides<br />
a sure vehicle to raising productivity and thus preserving<br />
our new competitiveness into the longer term.<br />
Change is always easiest to accomplish when both the need<br />
for and the consequences of it are well understood and<br />
that is no less the case in this instance. The key to<br />
success, is good two-way communication within the<br />
organisation and a shared perception of the need for change.<br />
I must say that I have been impressed on many occasions by<br />
the scale and pace of work place reforms underway in key<br />
areas of our economy some, but not all of which, are<br />
occuring in the context of government-sponsored industry<br />
plans. That need for good communication is all the greater when<br />
technological change is also involved and it is the<br />
management of technology, to which I wish to turn now, which<br />
is the third of the great management challenges facing<br />
Australia. Throughout the US and Europe, business managements are<br />
recognising that survival and prosperity depend upon their<br />
becoming more innovative and making better use of<br />
technology. </p>
<p>In 1983 three out of the four top spots on the New York<br />
Times bestselling non-fiction titles were In Search of<br />
Excellence by Tom Peters and Robert Waterman, which hs sold<br />
more than 5 million copies worldwide; One Minute Manager by<br />
Kenneth Blanchard which has notched up 4 million sales; and<br />
Megatrends by John Naisbitt with sales of 7 million.<br />
This latest wave of management thinking points the way in<br />
our search for a new managerial style. It suggests that a<br />
successful managerial strategy for Australian industry must<br />
include better use of technology and better product<br />
development. This is a vital shortcoming in corporate<br />
strategies in Australia at present.<br />
A recent survey among the world's top companies confirms<br />
that time and again the superiority of the product, rather<br />
than mere price, is the reason for success. Countries which<br />
wish to be the leaders in the decades ahead must concentrate<br />
on product innovation making new products or modifying and<br />
improving established products and on producing them as<br />
efficiently as possible.<br />
Japan has shown the world how to run a company by product<br />
innovation. The Chairman of Sony, Akio Morita is quoted as<br />
saying " My job is to make our products obsolete before our<br />
competitors do".<br />
But in Australia, we have become locked into traditional<br />
products with little scope for., product differentiation. We<br />
have traditionally concentrated instead on using technology<br />
to increase productivity through automation and cost<br />
cutting, for example.<br />
It is increasingly widely accepted that resolutely chipping<br />
away at waste and inefficiency is not enough to restore<br />
competitiveness. There is in fact no substitute for<br />
in-house research and development, which must be seen as<br />
a central, integral and continuing part of every<br />
manufacturing company's operations.<br />
As I have already said, good communication is an essential<br />
management skill. It is in particular a means towards better<br />
use of technology. Merely acquiring and applying new<br />
technology is not enough in itself. It must be accompanied<br />
by equally innovative methods of training and organisation<br />
in short, again, better people management.<br />
There is no simple management format for successful<br />
innovation. Some studies suggest that winning companies are<br />
relatively unhierarchical. The key to innovative management<br />
must be the encouragement of initiative throghout the<br />
business. only in this way can a business tap the creative.<br />
abilities of all its workers.<br />
In successful Japanese companies it is recognised that most<br />
of the innovation takes place on the shop floor. What goes<br />
on at the grassroots is often recognised as of more<br />
competitive significance than -lofty thinking in top floor<br />
offices. </p>
<p>But the OECD Examiners of Australia's science and technology<br />
policies commented: " the technical co-operation between<br />
workers and management which is common in the FRG or<br />
Scandinavia or Japan seemed to us to be much more<br />
exceptional in Australia".<br />
Australian management must more fully appreciate its<br />
workforce as one of its prime assets.<br />
Australian managers, unlike some of their Japanese or<br />
American counterparts, concentrate on the financial and<br />
technical aspects of new projects and look to tap the<br />
external labour market, including schools and universities,<br />
to solve their skill needs.<br />
The recent Business Council paper on work practices<br />
recognises resistance to new technology as a major source of<br />
restrictive practices and workplace rigidities. But it also<br />
recognises the importance of greater emphasis on training<br />
and on the development and utilisation of skills and<br />
concedes that management has not paid sufficient attention<br />
to these matters.<br />
For these reasons so I welcome the advent of the Graduate<br />
School of Management: because it demonstrates a commitment<br />
by the private sector to the education of its own managers.<br />
The School will provide Master of Business Administration<br />
courses as well as Doctoral programs. Perhaps just as<br />
importantly it will be the new home of the short duration,<br />
residential, management programs for senior business<br />
executives. In all, the school's teaching program will encourage the<br />
highest standards and the kind of frequent<br />
cross-fertilisation of ideas which will ensure its students<br />
remain closely in touch with contemporary issues and<br />
management techniques.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
It is my hope that business management schools will<br />
contribute directly to the emergence, from behind the<br />
traditionally protective barriers that have shielded our<br />
domestic manufacturing industry, of a new productive culture<br />
in Australia.<br />
For all of these reasons I am pleased to formally to open<br />
the University of Melbourne's Graduate School of Management. </p>
