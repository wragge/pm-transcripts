<p>I was saddened this morning to learn of the death of Australian music legend Billy Thorpe at the age of 60.</p>
<p>Billy was a giant of the Australian music industry. He started his music career as a Brisbane teen idol but will be remembered as one of the towering figures of the Australian hard rock and roll scene.</p>
<p>He earned his greatest success with The Aztecs and shot to national prominence in the 1970s with a string of brash albums and songs and powerful performances at the Sunbury Music Festival.</p>
<p>Billy Thorpe was an accomplished guitarist with an unmistakeable voice. Perhaps, though, his fans will remember him for one thing above all else: the ear-splitting volume of his concerts </p>
<p>He was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Hall of Fame in 1991. </p>
<p>On behalf of Janette and myself and the Australian Government, I extend my deepest sympathies to Billy's family, friends and fans.</p>
