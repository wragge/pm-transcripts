2 among other things, the election date. Have you made up your mind?<br />
PK; Well I wasnt considering it at all.<br />
DJ: Not once? You didn't think about it? Not once?<br />
PKt I think the uh, I think the public expect to get value from<br />
Paclaumonts. and this parliament has got a way to run yet.<br />
DJ: When do you think you'll go, sooner or later?<br />
PK: Vell, as I say, they expect value and value in their terms is<br />
to go later.<br />
DJ: So that means next year?<br />
Pt: That's when I'm sure most Australians would wait amid believe.<br />
ta/<br />
PB: These bLter polls aren t tempting you?<br />
PK: No, I mean in this system the Prime Mini. ster does have a<br />
Is perogative of deciding when the election istbut Cgain, I think<br />
from our point of view the progress which is being made now<br />
on the economic front is important and keeping it going is<br />
important no'just to the government but to the nation at large.<br />
DJ: Well now itsa six years and six months since you made Banana<br />
Republic commepn and you've been saying all this year the<br />
recovery is under way uouple of weeks ago you said the recession<br />
was well over. And yet we still see a struggln to reach that<br />
three per cent growth in the economy. So what do you think<br />
the state of the nation is today in October, 1992, ond,<br />
economically, and specifically in terms of those intangibles<br />
you once spoke about: npirit, hope and purpose.<br />
PK: Oh well I think in terms of uh, hope and purpose, I'll come to<br />
spirit in a momenL, in terms of hope and purpose Australia is<br />
nowi an open trading economy. It was not that a decade ago.<br />
Australia can now be confident that it can trade its way competitively<br />
in the world, that ovnr the longer haul employ its<br />
people, lift its living standards, and tako its place in the<br />

3 community of trading nations. This was not its3 Position a decade<br />
ago. You know I Aaid re~ cently, Australia's got its future back<br />
and it has got its future back. By the early 1980' s. Australia<br />
waa basically a minor qqilrry aind the things we produced the<br />
rest of the wiorld was paying us much less for. That's all1<br />
changed. This~ year we ' re exporting nearly 25 per cent of all.<br />
we produce, A. decade ago it was 14 per-cent. The difference<br />
is a world of difference. We are now exporting more elaboratly<br />
transformed manirarture. 9, or manufa~ ctured goods, than this year<br />
minins or mineral orpa. I tmea n, this is a major transformation.<br />
And we're now investing in our Sroatcst reSOurce, our people.<br />
By keeping kids on RchooI takinR them through tertiary and<br />
vocational eduCaLioli. building product innovation, that is doing<br />
all the clever things wo should have been doing 20 Years ago.<br />
MS: Prime Minister, can I' take you up on getting our future back,<br />
that's an Important print. Profesor B~ ob Gregory whom you know.<br />
in the who is on the Reserve Beink board. said last week<br />
that Austra~ lia probably wouldn't have anh unemployment rate below<br />
seven percent by the end of Lhis decade, that is by M99. He's<br />
not aloae ill-Litat thought. Tf we have that level of long term<br />
unemployment in fact lastlflR over 8 to 10 yearL, we'Ire going to<br />
have a breakdown in our social fabric. We haven't go0t our<br />
future ha-. k in t-hat Sense. And whntever government comes to<br />
power nakxL year is going to have Lo look at more than training<br />
it's going to hAvP. to do something about the social fabri~ c.<br />
What are you going to do?<br />
PKi Well Max, when T say abouit our future, i~ t means LhaL Lhere is<br />
a 2enario for Australia whici gives it a place in the world.<br />
In othe~ r words. when People Ar* e reeling off the names of other<br />
countrien with resources and potential, but who never mnde it<br />

4 were it not for the 80' s changes, Australia would have been<br />
among them.<br />
MS: Society is in danger isn't it?<br />
PK: No. Yes, but now it will never be among them. I mean its made<br />
thm great leap. The great change, and that's what I mean about<br />
its future. But is that a commenLry on the fact that we don't<br />
have problems, well of course we have problems, and our biggest<br />
single problem is unemployment. And its the one which I've<br />
devoLed myself greatest to in the period I've been Prime Minister.<br />
The/ abour market was the thing I devoted myself to in all the<br />
years I was Treasurer. We had phenomenal rates of employment<br />
growth. The Australian labour market today is 26 per cent<br />
larger than it was in 1983.<br />
MS: Gregory says we haven't constructed a new job since ' 81 if you<br />
take out the jobs which were provided to make up for the<br />
immigrantiLs thaL were arriving and he also soys and I think<br />
pretty well everyone in the government and the RBA, the Reserve<br />
Bank, would agree that we are not going to gel anywhere<br />
close to anything le. ss i. han 700,000 unemployed by the end of<br />
the decade.<br />
PK: Well we started off with a labour market of six million in 1983,<br />
that's today 7.6 million, Urn, when we have that phenomenal rate<br />
of employment Lthrough the ' 80' s, but a much, much greater level<br />
of participation in the workforce, particularly amongst womena<br />
the lowest we ever Rot unemployment to by the late ' 80' s was<br />
I just under six percent. Now I think what this means is an<br />
economy in transition. One that is changing its structure,<br />
where people are being structurally unomployed. As the industries<br />
change beneath their feet. As they now have to retrain themselves<br />
we arc going to have a tranaienL structural pool of<br />

MS: Good news.<br />
PK: Now Bernie Fraser made. the point, the Governor of the everiL<br />
bank, laet week he thought that was probably about six per<br />
cent. He may be right, it's certainly norzero. If we look<br />
at the ' 80' s experience, its about six percent so it means<br />
that the cyclical, the c~ ye of unemployment, the one we're<br />
living through now, is probably four Lo five per cent as points,<br />
and I believe we can get that down.<br />

AB: Mr Koating, when the election is finally called will you follow<br />
Lhe American model and debate your opponent, John Hewson, on<br />
television.<br />
PK: Well I debate hii every other day Amanda, why not then?<br />
AB: But will you hold a big public debate?<br />
PK: Oh, 1 don't think I have any problem rising to that challeige.<br />
DJ: Do you sn debates, television debates particularly, becoming<br />
a part of campaigns, a generic part of campaigns?<br />
PK; Oh, yes, but I mean we have debhates every day of the week<br />
when the house sits so this is noi for me would not be for<br />
mo on unusual thing to do.<br />
DJ: Mr Hewson'. A challenged you to that debate, will you?<br />

the future and unemployment.<br />
. Pr: Yeh, Yeh, and he may get one. He may get a series, but I won't<br />
be giving him a leg up so I'll he dectding about the formats<br />
later.<br />
MS: Did you see the American debates?<br />
PJK: Only one.<br />
MS: They were very important I think cause they touched on one of<br />
the things I think the eltchaot ( 4q/ about, which is that<br />
they really don't want to vote for either Paul Keating or<br />
John Iewson. In the U. S. that was the same and those debates<br />
gave you a senise of character.<br />
PK: Well I think, I think, exposition, public exposition of the<br />
issues is terribly important, and all of us who ate proctitioners<br />
know its very hard to set the thread of the argument across.<br />
YOu can get the knots across, but not the thread. Any forum<br />
that gives you that opportunity, which is well watchel to put<br />
some continuity to an argument, um will matter, because a lot<br />
of the transmission of news is by way of television news grabs<br />
which are themselves just a condensation of what is said.<br />
Denying the public a real chmnee to understand the issues. So<br />
I mean from my point of view the greater the exposition of the<br />
issues the better. Pa iLcularly in this election.<br />
AB: So<br />
PK: Particularly in this election which where I agree with the leader<br />
of the opposition, he said it will be the moat important election<br />

7 since the war. I think it will/ h. This has been said in the<br />
past. But I think this time its true, because there'll be<br />
stark difference between the parties, betwoen a policy oFinclusion,<br />
which we havA, where everybody's part of Australia<br />
and its change, and a policy of looking after yourself.<br />
AB: And it'll be taxation and industrial relations you said<br />
before will be the most importatnt issues, do you stick by that?<br />
PK: THey will he among them, but I think Australia's identity, its<br />
culture, its capacity to work as one nation will be amongst the<br />
other issues as well. As well as those proposals being put by<br />
the opAstion.<br />
PB: Prime Minister,<br />
DJ: People also make judgements on character on those debates too,<br />
do you think, and its often said you're a far nicer bloke off<br />
television and out of the house, than you are when you're seen<br />
on television.<br />
PK: Well we're all victims of the 30 second grab I think.<br />
DJ: So a long debate then is going to reveal more of your real<br />
charecterdo you think?<br />
PK: Well I think more of about what you stand for and why you do<br />
things. Um, you know our first question was about, you know<br />
Australia's lung run future, and you know I'm sure we are yet<br />
to adequately communidcto the fact that Australia's prospects<br />
now are vastly different than a d'cade ago. Now many people<br />
know about that, some people assume that, some people feel that.<br />
But not everyhody knows that, I mean that's important.<br />
MS; Do you think the electurate like thle Lhoice between you and<br />
Hewson, do you think they'd prefer another two?<br />

over a million and a half of them went to women.<br />

It will cut . qponding nnd it will up taxes. h4ow does<br />
that Sol with your plan for Igetina the economy moving and are<br />
you concerned about it?<br />
PK-Welj. any contraction won't hcip, and we were not alone or at<br />
the time perhaps we were, in one notion and expindirig fiscal<br />
polify. Dr Hiewson, my oppoilent, says it was, a mistoko. He<br />
says we Ahould cut the budger by 7 RiS. LION. I say th~ tt would<br />
push Australia right back int. o . L rerr.-, ion. The Japanese<br />
government~ not anything other thant a conServative government<br />
in it~ a recognition around the world, has brought a fieml.<br />
package out as twice as large as ours as a proportion of their<br />
economy. It think its the thina Lo do. We've got the American' R<br />
Reserve Bank Governor, Mr Croonspan~ lauding the Japanese for<br />
their packago. We did the right thing getting the stimulus<br />
Roing in the economy trying to promote activity and employment<br />
get people back to work, get the place moving, get con-<br />

piesume ito be putting Mr Fennets budyet together or taking<br />
responsibility for budgetary changes. We've till got to face<br />
those issues. But the general. r'd say the general view is,<br />
the Snneral line should be, that there is a role for<br />
Sovernmelt, in not only promoting activity, but seeing the<br />
6reat public things done. Whether it. he the road system or<br />
the rail sy. tem, or a new airline sysrem or a ne~ w electricity<br />

:; ee that as a bit of a test run for the Howard/ Hewson package?<br />

quite cipar. They want to push 8 million people Onl to common<br />
low contract. 4. I nican people have got to understand what this<br />
MeOILS, it means that Snillion Australians tinder a Rewson government<br />
wn a contract which jiu put in front of thcm by thcir employer,<br />
with any real neptotiating strcngth, bccause they are not allowed<br />
to associate in terms of the signing oC those agreviuents. There<br />
won't be minimuns provided for othe~ r than minimums which are<br />
now will meean the contraction in rates of pay for most people<br />
and, I think, its a step back down the time rt'innel, T think<br />
Australian * ociety aind fairness end equity will be very poorly<br />

I1h1, well the goyerrpments policy has been one of an evolutionary<br />
change. From a relatively inflexible labour titarket where the<br />
wage share was too high and the profit share too low, where<br />
iuvestmeflt was amashed and unemployrnont was rising. To ona<br />
where we Cot the balances Ti. ght ; And then started to open it up.<br />
Through things -qur~ h ais awatrd restructuring whiere we saw fopr<br />
instance in the metals indu : ty three hundred and sixty job<br />
classifications converted into fourteen. It's only by moving<br />
through the craft structure in an rvoluitionary way the old<br />
craft stTVcLurA of the cenltury, can you make the Australian<br />
la3bour nmrk. t as it is~ now becoming. much more flexible<br />
and much more dynamic.<br />
PIB: Would you now support a general wagc ri.,~ e Uacroas the board in<br />

We've made our policy clear, we dmn't have to, we've just<br />
arrived at a n. et of arrangement with the A. C. T. 11. who~ re this<br />

wa~ cs it now has. It doeÃ±. n'L have flexibtility downwards,<br />
and that's what Mr Howard and Dr lewson are, they're about<br />
flaxihflity down, they actullilly want...<br />
All: So no more national waige cases?<br />

the promi~ e to bo able to say if you vote for us we'll support<br />
a wage rise in a national wage caso?<br />

dj: Welcome back to MEET T112p PRESS, our ~ Uteit is the Prime Minister.<br />
MS: Prime Minister, we don't-here much anymore about the changinot<br />
of the flag. Are you gotflR t~ o give up on changing the f~ lag<br />
before the next election or tire you going to say someothing<br />
otbout it?<br />
11K Well, I thInk its ireportant, 1 think its imiportant for that<br />
debate t~ o be held. r mean dl 2 of these symbolic represefitational<br />
things need to be debated and understood.<br />
NS Do you have a new flag for the next Plection?<br />
PK: N'o, oh no, aind I wouldn't presume to. I've said already on the<br />
record that uh, before the official flag is chango-d we would<br />
have a pleh~ cite-of g. oma kind in the future. Rdut lets ma~ ke the<br />
point one century on, from Federation as a nation, Lhat we<br />
cant t g~ o on forcver wandering around with the f Lag of another<br />
country in the corner of our flag. And that's n matter<br />
I think, I me. an for Australi. a getting it clear for how it wdishes<br />
to represent itself as a n.-ition, as an o'ftity, it a terribly<br />
impor.. ift debate to have. But to be you know, that's entirely.<br />
another matter mmking transitions in Lhose arrangements quickly.<br />
Morc against Peoples wishes.<br />

The subject now PAY TV in Australia. MAx.<br />
MS Prime Minister. is the press reports correct that says the<br />
governmenlts going to give Lhe inside run Lo Kerry Packer<br />
on conLrol. iig the 1illiflg and the general subscription infrastrucrture<br />
for Pay Television.<br />
PK: No/ look the Uoverning principles in this, Max, are that we<br />
picked the right technolory whic. h r thi. rik is digital not:<br />
analog that we don't bccome an outpost of the American film<br />
studios, that we're not milked by Hollywood.<br />
MS: But is there an . nside run for Korry Packer?<br />
PX: No, Well or cuur:: i, litstezi Lo Lite inwr they're the principles.<br />
That there is a new player, that there was not now not a network.<br />
owner.\ paper owner, or a celecommnuniCOtion compa-ny that tticra<br />

iA a role for the ABC, for culiural rea~ sOIIS, hut not to enhance<br />
the commerciallitY of the ABC. Urn, and there'll be another<br />
network which will bo able to be bid for which the networks will<br />
q be able to bid for.<br />
MS: But its a sriple question, umn, the press reporting that uh<br />
Packer will control thie billing mnd the infrast'ructure as such.<br />
PY! Nothing of that matter is agreed anywhere.<br />
AB: How soonh?<br />
PK: Well I think one of the key points, the key point is the economics<br />
of free to ai. r television depcnd upon the price of Hollywood<br />
feaurc films. ri we Sct that wronqg, we get On~ whole of the<br />
economics of AustrAlian television wrong. And that's why its<br />
very imUpotanlt to choose the~ right technology you get the right<br />
strve'. tures .4o we gct a good balance in tho cost of running Pay<br />
TV free to air. We get that right, I think, and havc ittiew player,<br />
which is again another new additionn to the cross rule, another<br />
new player in Pay TV. and the ABC are role by virtue of its o<br />
own independence and id~ inLity tis the national broadcster<br />
then I think we'd have a pretty good system,<br />
D J Now Rupert Murdoch wants to co) me bacic to TV in Australia, he<br />
gays that all the rules should be abolished, it should be a<br />
free for all. Uim, whaL do you think about that?<br />
PX: I don't think very much about that really. T mean RupertAj was<br />
-% round, I negotiated amongst others with him thc cross media<br />
rule which selpMLt4ed television bad radio and print.. And T<br />
think its a pretty good rule.<br />
AB: Will, therc be a monopoly on the billitng and administrarion by<br />
one licencen?<br />
PK: Well thaes a11 to be decided.<br />
PD3: So cven thar. Packer option is still alivr?<br />

17 pki Well I don't think it actually on the tablc nt this stage.<br />
AB: lut, have you been speaking to Mr racker on this subject?<br />
PK: I speak to all the players.<br />
DJ: Mr Keating. there is n story in the press recently which concerns<br />
us because it concerns probably our new owners, CANWEST. What<br />
do you feel about an overseas company coming in and maybe<br />
threatening to get rid of ncw, programs and making decisions<br />
like this in the network? What do you think about that?<br />
We have,<br />
PK-; I think foreign ownership inimitations in relation to telovision<br />
as a prescribed area. And that is a key consideration in our<br />
point or view. The cconoanics of the network. s decided by thosp<br />
who own it.<br />
DJ: And the quality of what happens on that network with a foreign<br />
owner doosaft...<br />
PX! Well we've got such thinus as uh, as local content rules,<br />
whiLh you know are designed to overcome those sort. A of problems.<br />
MS: It wouldn't stop Channel Ten getting rid of its News and Current<br />
Affairs though.<br />
PK: Ah, well I don't know that anyone should make that presumption,<br />
I don ) anything about the bid hy thc way. ? ottIitLg. I ' ve<br />
had no contact with that. group whatsoever.<br />
AB: We are expecting a decision on Pay TV then, are we in the next<br />
couple of wecks?<br />
PI: If its possible to get it together, but again, mandating a new<br />
technology trying to set up structures which we've never hod.<br />
Uim, is not easy and will Lake some doing<br />
DJz Mr Keating, thank you very much<br />
