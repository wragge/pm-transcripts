    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government is committed to ensuring Australians engaged in terrorist activities are not receiving taxpayer funded welfare payments.</p>
<p>The Government will introduce legislation to ensure welfare payments can be promptly stopped for people identified by national security agencies as being involved in extremist conduct.</p>
<p>Currently, welfare payments can only be suspended or cancelled if the recipient no longer meets social security eligibility rules, such as participation requirements, and residence or portability qualifications.</p>
<p>The new legislation will enable the Department of Human Services to cancel a person’s welfare payment if it receives advice that a person has been assessed as a serious threat to Australia’s national security.</p>
<p>This advice will be provided by the relevant Ministers — the Attorney-General, the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection.</p>
<p>Ministers will exercise discretion and take into account all relevant factors, including advice from national security agencies, before requesting cancellation of welfare payments.</p>
<p>In addition, the Government will ensure relevant agencies work more closely together to share information on issues of national security where it relates to cancelling welfare to people who are a threat.</p>
<p>These new measures will ensure Australian taxpayers are not financing people known to be members of, or working with, terrorist organisations.</p>
<p>Australians travelling to Syria, Iraq, and other conflict zones to engage in, or support, terrorist activities are committing criminal offences.</p>
<p>Our welfare system already allows payments to be suspended or cancelled if people don’t meet their obligations.</p>
<p>This measure is based on the same principle. It is designed to make sure taxpayers’ money is not being used to undermine Australia’s national security.</p>
