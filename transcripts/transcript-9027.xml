PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRZSB BY THR PRIM MINSTIR, TER HON P J MATING NP<br />
BUSNUSS ASIA CONVZTION, ADLAIDI, 8-9 NOVMWEDR 1993<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
I am delighted to have this opportunity to address this<br />
very well-timed Business Asia Conference.<br />
It comes at the end of the Grand Prix, which has been an<br />
opportunity for South Australia to demonrstrate its<br />
capacity to successfully organise world class events and<br />
its ability to provide world class products.<br />
I am sure that no business visitor could be left with any<br />
doubt that South Australia is a State which intends to<br />
succeed. South Australia's commnitment to success in the export<br />
market and particularly to markets in our regioh is<br />
exemplified here today.<br />
Today, half of South Australia's exports go to the Asia<br />
Pacific region. I know the South Australian Government<br />
is determined-to double its exports to Asia in the next<br />
five years.<br />
Of South Australia's ten most important export markets,<br />
nine are in the Asia Pacific region.<br />
The reasons for Australia's success in Asia go beyond the<br />
simple fact that the Asian economies are growing.<br />
Australia is uniquely positioned to benefit from economic<br />
growth in Asia. And we have strong complementarities<br />
with the dynamic Asian economies.<br />
Australia's exports to East Asia now account for almost<br />
per cent of our merchandise exports.<br />
Last year, South East Asia was the fastest growing<br />
regional market for our exports. Exports grew by 19 per<br />
cent during the past year. And our manufactures exports<br />
to South East Asia have grown annually at an average of<br />
over 27 per cent in recent years. 290.9 </p>
<p>Over the lastA five years, Australian manuf actures exports<br />
to the rapidly growing economnies of Singapore, Taiwan,<br />
Hong Kong and Korea accounted for over 60 per cent of<br />
Australia's growth in manufactured exports.<br />
And demand will further increase as the economies of<br />
Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia continue to grow and<br />
diversify their imports.<br />
The Asia Pacific region is forecast to continue to grow<br />
by 7 per cent over the next two years.<br />
As Asian economies are maturing their consumers are<br />
growing in affluence. In Indonesia alone there is a<br />
mniddle class of 15 million which represents a huge<br />
potential market for Australia.<br />
In 1990 there were 6 million people in South East Asia<br />
with annual incomes above $ 5,000. In 2010 there will be<br />
some 45 million.<br />
So the opportunities are there and my Government has done<br />
much to get the right macro-and micro-economic settings<br />
for business in this country to capitalise on them.<br />
There are now stronger signs of economic recovery and of<br />
an improvement in business conditions and the" economic<br />
outlook. There are also signs that improvements in business<br />
conditions are being reflected in employment.<br />
Economic growth was 3.3 per cent to the June quarter, the<br />
seventh consecutive quarter of growth.<br />
Last week's balance of payments numbers showed a<br />
strengthening trend to higher exports.<br />
Conditions are right for further strengthening in<br />
business investment growth. Interest rates are at an<br />
historically low level.,<br />
The world economy is picking up and this will further<br />
strengthen our own recovery.<br />
Australian industry is beginning to turn the corner.<br />
orders are picking up.<br />
An important factor behind the recovery in manufacturing<br />
productionl has been the growth in manufactured exports<br />
over the past year.<br />
I commnend the South Australian Government for actively<br />
supporting its exporters with the establishment of the<br />
Strategic Trade Development Scheme and the New Exporters<br />
Challenge Scheme.<br />
001 </p>
<p>3<br />
To further assist South Australian companies in their<br />
export endeavours my government this week announced an $ 8<br />
million expansion to the Export Access program.<br />
I am also pleased to note that Mike Rann, the South<br />
Australian Minister for Business and Regional Development<br />
is working with Shane Stone of the Northern Territory to<br />
pursue business opportunities in ASEAN, and particularly<br />
in Indonesia. As you know the Northern Territory has<br />
important business connections with Eastern Indonesia.<br />
This partnership sends an important signal that our<br />
States are not always competing with each other in trade,<br />
but can collaborate in the national interest. Any<br />
assistance that States can offer to each other can only<br />
assist the overall future development of Australia.<br />
We all know of the strong manufacturing base in South<br />
Australia. South Australian exports of manufactures products have<br />
been a notable highlight in the South Australian economy<br />
in recent years.<br />
And for every million of extra manufactures exports,<br />
it is estimated that around 10 to 12 new manufacturing<br />
jobs are created and this does not include flow-on<br />
benefits to jobs in other sectors.<br />
The world's major car manufacturers have gained<br />
confidence in Australia's ability to produce world class<br />
and competitive vehicles and components.<br />
In South Australia General Motors Holden's Automtive Ltd<br />
invested some $ 150 million in the construction of a state<br />
of the art paint facility over the last year. It is<br />
expected that further investments of over $ 500 million<br />
will be made over the next four years.<br />
Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd has also made significant<br />
investments in recent years with $ 168 million being<br />
invested in plant upgrade and a further $ 400 million<br />
being invested in the development of new Magna/ Verada<br />
cars due for release in 1997.<br />
South Australia accounts for some 30 per cent of<br />
Australia's automotive component exports.<br />
There are some 20 automotive component manufacturing<br />
companies in South Australia producing world class<br />
products. Exports of automotive components totalled $ 150<br />
million in 1992.<br />
One example is Air international's South Australian<br />
producti-on of automotive air conditioning systems, which<br />
has gone from employing 20 people and annual sales of $ 1<br />
million in 1991 to employing 160 people and sales in<br />
excess of $ 100 million today. 2911 </p>
<p>4<br />
But there is also an important agricultural base in South<br />
Australia. South Australia has made a serious commiitment<br />
to develop and exploit its reputation as a producer of<br />
aclean foodo.<br />
A major focus for the Conurnwealth and States is to<br />
maintain the momentum of micro-economic reform. It is<br />
these reforms which directly influence business costs and<br />
the capacity of individual enterprises to compete<br />
successfully.<br />
We have already made a lot of progress. we have opened<br />
up the economy, floated the exchange rate, implemented<br />
reforms on the waterfront, in the rail, road transport,<br />
aviation and telecoimmunications industries. we have<br />
established an orderly program for reducing protection<br />
for our industries, and improving the capacity of the<br />
economy to respond to the challenges of the international<br />
marketplace. There is much more to do and governments are currently<br />
considering reforms to the structure of our electricity,<br />
water and gas industries.<br />
I am pleased to say that South Australia is one of two<br />
states which has made definite moves toward this goal.<br />
Because of the efforts of Premiers Arnold and Goss the<br />
construction of a second Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline to<br />
supply South Australian ethiie to the ICI petrochemical<br />
plant at Botany, NSW, is likely to go -ahead.<br />
One of Australia's great export success stories is wine.<br />
It has been going on f or some years now, but none has<br />
been more impressive than the past year. The record<br />
export performance for the month of September of 16<br />
million litres exceeded the level of exports for the<br />
whole of 1985-86.<br />
South Australian wine exporters, as the premium wine<br />
producers in Australia, have been at the forefront of<br />
that export drive. They have proved that with the right<br />
product and the right marketing there's enormous<br />
potential for Australian agriculture and horticulture.<br />
Asia represents enormous potential for wine exports.<br />
South Korea alone is now importing over a million litres<br />
of Australian wine per annum.<br />
This willingness to seek out overseas markets for quality<br />
products, in many cases to markets in our own region, is<br />
a model for all.<br />
The submarine project is an example of government and<br />
industry working together. When I spoke at the launching<br />
ceremony of the Collins submarine in August I<br />
congratulated the South Australian government for its<br />
foresight in backing the project.<br />
2912 </p>
<p>My Government recognises that it has a role to Play in<br />
assisting Australian business change its approach and<br />
move into the global marketplace.<br />
Without that support and the support of South Australian<br />
industry the project would never have achieved the<br />
current high standards.<br />
over 1000 new jobs have been created at the Australian<br />
Submarine Corporation.<br />
And several thousand other Australians have gained work<br />
through sub-contracts. Here is an example of a<br />
commi~ tment by a state government helping the growth not<br />
only of their own state's industry, but also the growth<br />
of Australia as a whole.<br />
A project of the scope of the submarine project has<br />
brought to Australia valuable technology transfer. In<br />
addition, many Australian companies have refined<br />
previously available technology.<br />
The project is a catalyst for research and development,<br />
design initiatives, improved production techniques, new<br />
ways of testing and proving equipment, and so on.<br />
The development of computer software to be used on board<br />
the submnarine, the development of special tiles and the<br />
successful reduction of noise in the pumps represent fine<br />
examples of the development of previously available<br />
technology. A number of those companies are South<br />
Australian companies and represent potential exports for<br />
Australia. On the broader front, my government's trade. policy<br />
priorities are the successful conclusion to the Uruguay<br />
Round and further development of APEC.<br />
We strongly believe in maintaining and strengthening an<br />
open, non-discriminatory multilateral trading system<br />
based on the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade<br />
-( GATT). This interest is shared by our Asian trading<br />
partniers because they depend on access to international<br />
markets. We are concerned that some countries : Are taking a<br />
particularly parochial and defensive approach in the<br />
negotiations on the Uruguay Round. X comprehensive,<br />
balanced agreement covering all sectors would benefit not<br />
only Australia, but all nations.<br />
Such an agreement is the most important achievement that<br />
nations can make to stimulate world . growth and<br />
confidence. 2913 </p>
<p>My visit to Seattle to attend the APEC leaders meeting<br />
next week will further underline the importance Australia<br />
attaches to developments in our-region.<br />
The Asia-Pacific region has emerged as the world's preeminent<br />
economic region.<br />
It has led the world in growth over the past two decades.<br />
It now accounts for half the world's GDP and over half<br />
the world's manufacturing production.<br />
And the region's growth has been outward-looking. The<br />
Asia-Pacific region is the fastest growing and most<br />
integrated trading conriunity in the world.<br />
The Asia-Pacific region accounts for some 40 per cent of<br />
world trade. in 1992, 66 per cent of Asia-Pacific<br />
exports stayed in the region. Trade within the region<br />
now exceeds that of the European Commnunity.<br />
And regional investment is growing even faster than<br />
trade. In the period to 1997, 40 per cent of new global<br />
investment demand will come from Asia.<br />
The key challenge is to unlock the full economic<br />
potential of the Asia-Pacific region. I believe Asia<br />
Pacific Economic Co-operation APEC can play a<br />
decisive role in meeting this challenge.<br />
APEC shows great promise as a forum for promoting<br />
reiional economic co-operation on a basis of open<br />
regionalism. APEC is about removing impediments to doing<br />
business in the Asia-Pacific region and increasing the<br />
velocity of trade and investment for example by<br />
harmonising standards.<br />
I have made clear that the Government does not see APEC<br />
as an alter-native to GATT but as a OGATT-plus' structure<br />
which builds on GA!' outcomes. We do not have in mind<br />
anything like the European Commiunity, which is a much<br />
more formal, highly-structured and inward-looking<br />
grouping. The informal Seattle meeting of APEC leaders in November<br />
is a historic opportunity for the region. It will build<br />
on the increasing economic integration of the APEC<br />
economies and give expression to the growing sense of<br />
commnunity in our region. And it will focus the world's<br />
attention on the dynamism of Asia.<br />
As I said recently in Jakarta, that meeting will be<br />
supremely imporzant for the region. It will give APEC<br />
leaders a chance to clear our collective minds about the<br />
development of what is going to be a very significant<br />
open regional grouping of countries.<br />
2914 </p>
<p>The active participation of the private sectors of the<br />
APEC economues including Australian business is<br />
integral to the success of APEC's further development.<br />
Governments can set in place structures such as APEC to<br />
help create the right environment for trade and<br />
investment. But ultimately it is for business to trade<br />
and invest.<br />
To assist me in preparing for the Seattle leaders meeting<br />
: have established an APEC Business Consultative Panel.<br />
wdhich met t3r the first timne last week. in the meeting I<br />
heard first hand the views of a group of senior<br />
Australian business people on their ideas for the way<br />
ahead for APEC.<br />
As I said to the panel members. there is no road-map for<br />
APEC. Alt is imp~ ortant to get the business coummunity<br />
involved. Through APEC Australia, as a well-regarded<br />
member of the Asia-Pacific region, can help put in place<br />
structures which encourage economic co-operation and<br />
integration. APEC will have done its job if it achieves<br />
this. </p>
