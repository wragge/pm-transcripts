AMBASSADOR APPOINTED TO THE INTMTATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATICN<br />
Australia would strengthen its labour representation in Europe and<br />
its relations with the International Labour Orpnisation and with other<br />
organisations concerned with manpower and social affairs in Europe, by<br />
appointing in Europe a Special Labour Adviser with the personal rank of<br />
Ambassador, to handle all labour questions, the Prime Minister and Minister<br />
for Foreign Affairs, Mr Whitlam, announced today.<br />
This representative would be Dr P. H. Cook, at present Secretary of<br />
the Department of Labour and National Service. He has had great experience<br />
in the work of the I. L. O. and has participated on many occasions as Australia's<br />
representative at I. L. O. conferences.<br />
Dr Cook would be attached for administrative purposes to the<br />
Australian Mission to the United Nations in Geneva but would have wide-ranging<br />
responsibilities covering the whole of Europe. As well as carrying out<br />
representation and continuing relations with the major organs of the I. L. O.<br />
and its Office, Dr Cook would assist the Australian Ambassador to the<br />
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as Australia's<br />
principal representative for manpower and social affairs questions with the<br />
Organisation. The OECD, of which Australia became a member in June 1971, has an<br />
important Manpower and Social Affairs Directorate within its secretariat and<br />
conducts meetings of Government representatives through its Manpower and<br />
Social Affairs Committee, as well as through seminars and other specialist </p>
<p>-2-<br />
meetings of experts from Wiestern European and North American countries and<br />
Japan. For a number of' years, OECD has urged Member governments to adopt<br />
an active manpower policy, particularly through measures to facilitate and<br />
stimulate mutually beneficial adaptation between the labour force and the<br />
needs of a rapidly changing economy.<br />
Dr Cook would generally keep in touch with manpower developments<br />
in Western Europe, especially those which may be of direct interest to the<br />
Australia situation. He would, inter alia, maintain regular contact with<br />
such organisations as the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.<br />
Mr Whitlan emphasised the importance he attached to Australia's<br />
active participation in I. L. O. and to ratification of I. L. 0. Conventions.<br />
He said that Australia had, at one time, led the world with some of the most<br />
progressive labour legislation but, during the last twenty years, had fallen<br />
far behind many of the countries in Western Europe. It was now time to catch<br />
up. In many instances conditions of work, social security, retirement<br />
benefits and many other things vital, both to the individual worker and to<br />
the economy as a whole were now much more favourable to workers in European<br />
countries than in Australia. We must learn in depth and in detail just what<br />
European countries had managed to achieve while we had been standing still.<br />
The appointment in Europe of a scnior representative with a great background<br />
of experience and expertise in labour matters would go a long way to help<br />
remedy the lack of progress in Australia in recent years. </p>
