FOR PRESS 4 NOVEMBER 1977<br />
ADDRESS TO MELBOURNE STOCK EXCHANGE DINNER<br />
I welcome this opportunity to discuss with you tonight the state<br />
of the Australian economry particularly as it is now clear that econanic<br />
recovery is well under way. It is clear that 1978 will be the<br />
best year in terms of overall economic performance in over five<br />
years. I also welcome this opportunity because my Government has always<br />
recognised the vital role of the Australian capital market in our<br />
drive to achieve full economic recovery.<br />
During the long period of sustained expansion of the 1950s, 1960s<br />
and early 1970s, the institutions of our capital market, among<br />
which the stock exchanges were prominent, played a fundamental<br />
part. They marshalled financial savings from within Australia<br />
and overseas, channeling them to firms, individuals and governments<br />
wishing to carry out investment. Almost thirty years of continual<br />
industrial expansion and the great development in the 1960s of our<br />
major mineral industries were substantially due to the vitality,<br />
initiative and soundness of our capital market.<br />
That success story came to an abrupt end in just three years<br />
1973, 1974 and 1975. The reasons were high and increasing inflation,<br />
appalling low profits, and penal taxation. Share and other security<br />
prices collapsed, while interest rates jumped to previously<br />
unimagined levels. The long-term capital market in particular<br />
effectively disappeared; new industrial issues fell right away<br />
as companies contracted their new in . vestment plans -to the minimum;<br />
overseas investors withdrew.<br />
The capital market is often regarded as the bell-wether of the<br />
emerging economic trends in -the economy. It is with pleasure<br />
therefore that I have been observing recent capital market<br />
indicators suggesting renewed signs of optimism. Interest rates<br />
have begun to decline. In the Government bond market, -the longterm<br />
rate has recently come down below 10% for the first time<br />
since mid-1975. Provided current policies are maintained, there<br />
is good reason to expect this trend to gather momentum in the year<br />
ahead, spreading to include-a wide range of other interest and<br />
security yields. / some </p>
<p>-2<br />
Some industrial and mining companies have been demonstrating<br />
their confidence by expanding their capital raising and it is pleasing<br />
to see sare signs of greater activity in the issues of longer<br />
dated securities.<br />
Both these trends, which appear likely to continue, indicate basic<br />
confidence in the waythe economy is heading. Let me tell you quite<br />
plainly that such confidence is entirely justified.<br />
Let us recall for a moment the kind of economy we took over when<br />
we came to office. Inflation was rampant and unemployment<br />
increasing sharply. Real wages had far outstripped productivity.<br />
The public sector's claim on resources had grown far too big.<br />
The money supply was out of control. Investment was down. And<br />
Australia's competitiveness had been badly damaged. From the<br />
outset, our economic strategy aimed at reducing inflation and<br />
getting private business who employ three out of four Australiansback<br />
on its feet. We realised that the task of restoring the<br />
nation's economy would be a lengthy and difficult one, and we<br />
made this plain publicly before the election. Above all, inflation<br />
had to be beaten.<br />
In our twenty two months of office, we have not wavered off this<br />
course. We have resisted all pressures to expand public spending,<br />
even though at times there seemed to be some short-term political<br />
advantage in doing so. For the<br />
first t ime in _' many yerthe Commonwealth Government's share<br />
of GDP has actually fallen. Without this restraint, we could<br />
not have introduced our tax reforms, and even with all our tax<br />
cuts, we have still cut the deficit by nearly<br />
We have succeeded in steadily winding down underlying money supply<br />
growth, from around 20% per annum prevailing in the second half of 1975<br />
to about 10% in the financial year just ended, and the Budget is working on an<br />
Becuseofour restraint, because of our success in making the<br />
provision of Government services more efficient, we have now<br />
achieved a responsible spending base.<br />
-Our policy of responsibility has brought major successes. There-<br />
. eet is-ye) iar-az m'j orb reak through in-uti . inf lation,___<br />
and we_ have-gone a-yery long way-towards breaking inflationary<br />
The. 2% ConI=*-sumer Price-Index for<br />
the ' September quarter confirms that inflation is now running at<br />
around 9% and falling. National accounts deflators support this.<br />
Based on the latest available six monthly period, every one of the<br />
following indicators puts inflation under 8% per annum: prices<br />
of articles produced by the manufacturing industry, prices of<br />
materials used in house building, prices of materials used in<br />
other buildings.<br />
Over the three nm~ ths -to July, average prices of mate~ ials used in<br />
manufacturing industry increased by less than Overall we have<br />
found it necessary to substantially revise downward the inflation<br />
projection in the Budget documents. / Th es e </p>
<p>-3<br />
These achievements on their own are most satisfying. But<br />
more significantly when judged against other countries, our<br />
inflation rate now broadly matches that of our major trading<br />
partners. This is not just a political boast on the Government's<br />
part. It is a statement of fact. The average inflation rate in<br />
twenty four OECD countries has remained fairly static in the<br />
8-10% 0 range for two years now. Our underlying rate has gone<br />
down from 17% to around This is a major achievement when<br />
it is remembered that the gap between Australia's rate of inflation<br />
and our major trading partners was some six to seven<br />
percentage points in 1975 under the former Government.<br />
By maintaining our current policies, I am confident that the<br />
rate of inflation will be running at an annual rate of between<br />
by the middle of next year. The quarterly rate of increase<br />
in the Consumer Price Index is now estimated to be below 2% in<br />
the March and June quarters, of next year, and declining further<br />
as 1978 progresses.<br />
I note that there has been an increasing consensus among economic<br />
and finance commentators that inflation is coming down rapidly,<br />
and that this has strengthened greatly our prospects of sustained<br />
recovery, sound external account, falling unemployment, and<br />
lower interest rates. As one commentator has noted, we are<br />
rapidly approaching the point of " an emphatic, sustainable turn<br />
upwards in -the business cycle".<br />
We have done what was needed to reverse the disastrous economic<br />
policies of our predecessors. There has been an increase of<br />
23% in company profits for 1976/ 77, a significantly higher<br />
share of national income going to profits, a lower household<br />
savings ratio about two-thirds of the way back to ' normal',<br />
and a moderate expansion in real gross non-farm product.<br />
In the eighteen months before we came to office there was<br />
virtually no real growth. In our first eighteen months there<br />
was real growth of Evidence is now emerging of new capital<br />
investment projects moving ahead, particularly in the extractive<br />
and manufacturing industries. A recent Government<br />
review of major investment proje . cts planned by companies in<br />
Australia reveals substantially greater investor confidence.<br />
Firm investment proposals totalled around $ 5.8 billion,<br />
probably projects some $ 8 billion, and longer-term possibilities<br />
about $ 7.1 billion and this survey did not include investments<br />
of under $ 5 million.-each.<br />
This is a bright investment outlook. It is good news for<br />
Australia. It means more jobs for Australians. The 1977/ 78<br />
Budget charts a course of strengthening recovery during the<br />
course of tLhe year. This recovery will be founded on expansion<br />
in consumption, investment, and a turn-around of the balance of<br />
trade flowing through from devaluation. The emergence of the<br />
economy's new strength will be more apparent as we move into 1978.<br />
/ There was </p>
<p>4<br />
There was real growth in retail sales in the September quarter.<br />
In money terms, sales increased by compared to 2.5% and<br />
1.8% in the previous two quarters. A survey of capital expenditure<br />
by the Bureau of Statistics shows an expected increase of<br />
14% in the current half year which would be the largest<br />
increase in recent years. Housing finance approvals by major<br />
lenders were 18% higher in August than the 1976/ 77 monthly<br />
average. In the June half-year private comnencenets in construction<br />
( other than building) were up 61% on the same period last year.<br />
Export volumes rose in the September quarter.<br />
In the finance sector, as you would know, a number of factors<br />
have led to expectations of lower interest rates. Significantly<br />
lower interest rates are vital to full economic recovery. Those<br />
who call for additional spending on one programme or another<br />
fail to realise the implications for interest rates of greater<br />
public spending. If this Government were to resort to Labor's<br />
big spending approach the community's confidence would be<br />
shattered. The opportunity to lower interest rates would be<br />
gone. There is no way this Government will treat this election<br />
as an auction the ALP has already promised $ 3,000 million.<br />
What we offer is a much rarer commodity a responsible and<br />
effective Government.<br />
In the coming election campaign, there is a choice of the utmost<br />
clarity. We are committed to a system where worthwhile free<br />
enterprise. can-flourish-Our commitment is not founded simply<br />
on the fact that free enterprise is the most efficient economic<br />
system, or the most efficient producer of the resources required<br />
to provide a better life for all Australians, though it is both<br />
of these. We support free enterprise because it is the most<br />
democratic system. It confers on the individual maximum freedom<br />
of choice. It allows the individual maximum opportunity to<br />
innovate, to. strike out on h. i-s own, to try out new ideas and<br />
prcjects. it makes the indiviaual consumer the ul'timate<br />
allocator of resources.<br />
The Australian Labor Party of course supports an entirely<br />
different approach. We have the evidence of three years of<br />
Lab-or rule. We also have the evidence of their new economic<br />
* planning policy, adopted in Perth last June, which is binding<br />

and to give directibn to the allocation of resources between<br />
the various sectors in the economy." " A Department ( will be)<br />
created with the responsibility to co-ordinate preparation and<br />
maintaining of plans" " Labor will set the overall objectives<br />
Government will intervene where necessary to reach national<br />
objectives" " Public enterprise is particularly to be established<br />
or extended in the fields of banking, consumer affairs, insurance,<br />
finance, marketing, housing, stevedoring, transport and in areas<br />
of social monopoly." These words represent the Australian Labor<br />
Party's plan for Australia a vast bureaucracy armed with vast<br />
powers to impose controls on the daily lives of us all. / Elements </p>
<p>Elements of this plan to again damage and disrupt business<br />
if they were ever to get a second chance are now being publicly<br />
disclosed. Mr. Whitlam has indicated his disapproval of the<br />
investment allowance, the taxation incentives to mining<br />
companies, vital concessions to rural industry such as income<br />
equalisation deposits, our changes to private company taxation<br />
laws. In addition, our personal taxation reforms, which will<br />
release $ 2,250 million from revenue into the hands of individuals<br />
and companies this financial year and $ 2,935 million next year,<br />
would be far from safe under Labor. our new tax scales have<br />
not been endorsed by the Labor Party and Mr. Hayden has refused<br />
to commit himself on tax indexation.<br />
Significant advances have been made in restoring the Australian<br />
economy, and while unemployment will, of course, rise in the<br />
Christmas period of school leavers it always does from<br />
February unemployment will fall in a steady and sustained way.<br />
The Government has shown sensitivity and concern about unemployed<br />
Australians. We have developed policies that tackle its real<br />
causes. Firstly we have tackled inflation. Labor's policy of massive<br />
expenditure would lead to inflation rising again, and there<br />
would be no permanent gain for the unemployed. Wie all remember<br />
how Labor panicked as unemployment rose in 1974 how they<br />
introduced the now discredited RED scheme, only to stop<br />
spending on it in 1975. The same discredited schemes still<br />
form the basis of Labor's current economic platform.<br />
Compare our policy decisions on unemployment. We have given<br />
industry the protection it needs. Recent trade figures show<br />
the effects of devaluation boosting exports and curtailing imports.<br />
We have introduced a number of new imaginative programmes to<br />
provide immediate help to the unemployed, and, unlike Labor's<br />
RED scheme, these will bring an enduring benefit to those who<br />
participate in them, and they are being achieved within a<br />
responsible economic framework. They include National Employment<br />
and Training Scheme, Special Youth Employment Scheme, Community<br />
Youth Support Scheme, Relocation Assistance, and the CRAFT Scheme<br />
for Apprentices. more than 122,000 Australians mainly young<br />
people have already ben~ itted from these programmes. They<br />
are all schemes which help to improve basic skills, and no<br />
eligible'person will be-refuised assistance'.'<br />
The Government has also initiated an education programme for<br />
unemployed youth which helps young people develop skills such<br />
as literacy and numeracy needed in the workplace. Specially<br />
selected teachers at technical colleges are re-teaching small<br />
groups, and early results of this new programme have been most<br />
encouraging. / Only a </p>
<p>-6<br />
Only a few days ago, at the Premiers' Conference, it was<br />
unanimously agr * eed that a Special Youth E~ mployment Task Force<br />
be set up in each state. That force will promote a major<br />
campaign to encourage employers to make a special effort to<br />
employ additional young people from the beginning of 1978.<br />
I trust you and your clients will respond enthusiastically<br />
to this campaign.<br />
Mr. President, I have greatly enjoyed this opportunity to<br />
discuss with you and other members present here tonight the<br />
economic problems which the Government has had to tackle, the<br />
successes so far achieved, and the prospects ahead. In my view<br />
it will not be too long now before the traditional and crucial<br />
role of the capital market in raising much of the capital for<br />
the re-equipment of our industries will assume even greater<br />
importance. The circumstances will not be quite the same as<br />
they were in the 1960s.-New initiatives, new techniques, will<br />
be called for.<br />
I am sure that the Government and the community can look to you<br />
to live up to our expectations and to carry out your role with<br />
the responsibility and flair that is in your best tradition. </p>
