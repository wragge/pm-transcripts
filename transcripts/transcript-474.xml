<p>As Honourable Members know, Sir Earle Christmas Grafton Page died on December 20, 1961.</p>
<p>He was born in 1880. He became a notable surgeon. He served in the first A. I. F. as a surgeon, in Egypt and France.<br />Urged on by an enthusiasm ; rhich marked the whole of his public life for national development, an"* particularly rural<br />growth, he entered this Parliament in 1919 as the member for Cowper, a seat which he held continuously until the recent electicn.<br />He became leader of the Country Party in 1921, an office<br />which he held until 1939. On February 9, 1923, he became<br />associated, as Treasurer, with Mr. Bruce ( as he then was) in the<br />Bruce-Page Government, uhich held office until October 1929.<br />During this period, in 1924-25, he led an Australian<br />delegation to the United Kingdom and the United States of<br />America, to examine banking, electricity, and road and rail<br />transport. In 1923 and again in 1926 he was Acting Prime Minister.<br />In 1934 he entered the Lyons Government as Minister for<br />Commerce, an f fice which he retained until April 1939 doing much<br />significant work in the field of orderly marketing, and was<br />Minister for Health from November 1937 to November 1938. He was<br />the leader of Australian Ministerial trade delegations to London<br />in 1936 and 1938.<br />He acted as Prime Minister in 1935 and 1937.<br />On the death of the Rt. Honourable J. A. Lyons, Sir<br />Earle Page became Prime Minister from April 7 to April 26, 1939.<br />From October 1940 to October 1941 he was Minister for<br />Commerce first in my own Government and then in the Fadden<br />Government. He aas a member of the Australian 4ar Cabinet from<br />January to May 1941, and of the Economic and Industrial Committee<br />of Cabinet from June to October of that year. In 1941-42 he<br />represented Australia in the British War Cabinet.<br />He was a member of the Australian Advisory Jar Council<br />from August 1942 to September 1943 and again from February 1944<br />to August 1945. In December 1949 he became Minister for Health in my own<br />Government, and retained that portfolio until 1956, when he<br />expressed a wish to retire from Ministerial office.<br />From July to September 1951 he visited Canada a-d the<br />United States of America to study problems of health<br />administration. In August-September 1953 he visited the United Kingdom<br />and the Netherlands, and attended a conference of the World<br />Medical Association at the Hague.<br />He represented the Government at the inauguration of<br />the Republic of Pakistan in March 1956.</p>
<p>2.<br />Over a long puriod, from 1923 to 1934, and again from<br />1937 onwards, ho was a rmember of the Standing Orders Committee.<br />His public career, oven as stated in this summary form,<br />was a very remarkable one. Few ren have served Australia with<br />such distinction in so many ways over so long a period of time.<br />But the record does not end there. It is a difficult<br />task to select the outstanding features of the versatile % vork he<br />did. But perhaps I might venture to refer briefly to three of a<br />number of matters which should be on the record.<br />The first is that, conscious of the need for<br />strengthening the rural economy, he was ? argely responsible for<br />many special taxation and other provisions designed to encourage<br />capital improvement on the land, and with it the essential<br />improvement of efficiency and production.<br />The second is that, as Commonwealth Treasurer, he was a<br />loader in the creation of the Financial Agreement and the Loan<br />Council, each of which has had a permanent and far-reaching<br />effect upon the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the<br />States. The third is that he was the prime author of and<br />driving force behind the Commonwealth Medical and Health schemes<br />which are now successfully operating in Australia.<br />His labours wore recognised when he was made a Privy<br />Councillor in 1929, a G. C. M. G. in 1938, and a Companion of Honour<br />in 1942. But even more importantly he will be honoured and<br />remembered with gratitude for his great contributions to the<br />development of the Australian Nation, its institutions and its<br />policies. All Honourable Members, both new and old, and of<br />whatever party, will join with me in expressing appreciation of<br />his public service, and in expressing to the family our sense of<br />recognition and of loss.<br />Mr. Speaker, I move that this House expresses its deep<br />regret at the death on 20th December, 1961, of the Right Honourable<br />Sir Earle Christmas Grafton Pago, a Member of this<br />House from 1919 to 1961 and a former Prime Minister of the<br />Commonwealth, places on record its appreciation of his long and<br />meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to</p>
