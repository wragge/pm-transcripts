Italy Speech by the President of the Council of Ministers, Professor Aldo<br />
Moro, at a luncheon in honour of the Prime Minister of Australia in<br />
Romeon 8January 1975<br />
Mr Prime Minister. In extending to you on behalf<br />
of the Italian Government and on my own<br />
behalf a most warm welcome, I want to tell you<br />
how pleased I am about this meeting which<br />
allows us to have a frank and cordial exchange<br />
of views on various problems of common<br />
interest.<br />
I would like also to take the opportunity to express<br />
to you once again the deep sympathy of<br />
the Italian people for the disaster which only a<br />
few days ago so gravely struck the city of Darwin,<br />
prompting the unanimous and sincere sorrow<br />
of the whole world.<br />
Our discussions and the other meetings that<br />
you will have on the occasion of this your first<br />
official visit to our country fit into a pattern of<br />
personal contacts between members of the<br />
Governments of our two countries which has<br />
become richer in recent years and which I sincerely<br />
hope may continue to develop in the<br />
future. I still remember well your preceding visits to<br />
Italy, in other capacities but always with a<br />
genuine friendship for our country and in continual<br />
search for further points of contact and<br />
dialogue. In our meetings, Mr Prime Minister, we have<br />
been able to confirm the excellent state of the<br />
relationship existing between Australia and<br />
Italy and the proximity of our points of view on<br />
many political and economic problems of the<br />
present time. Above all we have been able to<br />
ascertain with satisfaction that Australia and<br />
Italy are united in the hope of increasing detente<br />
and international political stability with the conviction<br />
that only in this way can humanity reach higher levels of social progress in safe-guarding<br />
the values of democracy and freedom.<br />
It is exactly this identity of purpose which has<br />
led our two countries to work together on numerous<br />
occasions and to carry out a common<br />
action in the United Nations and in the principal<br />
international organisations where they have<br />
been able to emphasise repeatedly the importance<br />
of the ideals which our peoples share. At a<br />
time like the present when the international<br />
scene is troubled by so many serious problems,<br />
a meaningful understanding between states<br />
sharing particular affinities and common<br />
interests acquires an, if possible, even greater<br />
significance. I hope therefore, that our collaboration<br />
on both the multi-lateral and bilateral<br />
levels may become even deeper in the future.<br />
The climate of trusting friendship between our<br />
two countries has also a solid foundation in the<br />
presence, in Australia, of an important Italian<br />
community which constitutes a link between<br />
our two peoples. This community represents a<br />
fundamental element in our relationship which<br />
deserves being carefully valued and watched.<br />
On the bilateral level, I am pleased to underline<br />
that the present good state of our economic and<br />
commercial relations, notwithstanding some<br />
difficulties connected, for example, with the<br />
distance between our two countries, will be able<br />
to develop even further in the furture. The<br />
economies of Australia and Italy are in fact gen<br />
erally complementary.<br />
The sector where the co-operation between the<br />
two countries can be especially advantageous is<br />
that of energy, a sector in which only the concerted<br />
effort and solidarity of all will allow us to </p>
<p>face up the difficulties of the present time. In<br />
this context, the contribution which Australia<br />
can give to Italy, in the development of those<br />
alternative sources of energy on which the<br />
economic and social progress of our two peoples<br />
will increasingly depend, assumes particular<br />
importance. Mr Prime Minister, the desire to contribute to<br />
the solution of the great problems of our time<br />
which unites Australia and Italy also guarantees<br />
the expansion of our relations and closer human<br />
and cultural contacts between our two peoples.<br />
The Prime Minister signs the Cultural Agreement between Italy and Australia with the Prime<br />
Minister of Italy, Professor Moro. </p>
<p>Speech by the Prime Minister of Australia at a luncheon given in his<br />
honour by the President of the Council of Ministers in Rome on<br />
8 January 1975<br />
It is a particular pleasure to be in Rome again. I<br />
was here for a day in April 1973, but this is my<br />
first official visit since becoming Prime Minister.<br />
I am visiting a number of the EEC countries and<br />
other European countries. The Community is<br />
now Australia's second largest trading partner.<br />
Europe, moreover, is the foundation of<br />
Australia's cultural heritage. The advanced<br />
state of European technology and culture make<br />
it imperative for leaders to keep in touch with<br />
events in Italy. It is therefore an important duty,<br />
as well as a special pleasure, to be with you.<br />
I doubt if there has ever been a time when consultation<br />
and co-operation between national<br />
leaders was more urgent or important. Australia<br />
and Italy have great cultural and social traditions<br />
in common: more significantly, we share<br />
with all countries of the Western world great<br />
social and economic problems. Inflation and<br />
unemployment pose a grave and growing threat<br />
to democratic values and social order and cohesion.<br />
If Western nations are to solve these<br />
problems without a recourse to authoritarianism<br />
or without a relapse into anarchy, they will do so<br />
only by restoring faith in the democratic system.<br />
I believe it is time for governments, for politicians,<br />
for all free political parties, to renew their<br />
commitment to the forms and values of a democratic<br />
society. There is no more urgent task for<br />
modern statesmen than to lead, to inspire, to<br />
nourish this commitment. The breakdown of<br />
democracy in one country, attacks on democracy<br />
in one country, must be recognised as an<br />
attack on democracy everywhere. I believe the<br />
leaders and peoples of Italy and Australia, two<br />
nations with democratic systems, can play a<br />
part in rebuilding the world's faith in the<br />
flexibility and strength of democracy.<br />
The Italian community is now the biggest of the<br />
national groups in Australia. More than<br />
380,000 Australian residents were born in<br />
Italy, and Italians have had a profound impact<br />
on Australia's way of life. Many of our major<br />
developmental projects since the last war would have been impossible without Italian workers<br />
and engineers. Your great state enterprises,<br />
such as IRI and ENI, have been an example and<br />
an inspiration to me and my Government in the<br />
work we are doing. I mention one matter of<br />
great interest to Italy-the sale of Australian<br />
uranium. The Australian Government recognises<br />
the importance of uranium to Italy. We will<br />
ensure that Italy gets an equitable proportionalong<br />
with our other major trading partners-of<br />
the uranium we have to export.<br />
I am grateful for the welcome you have given<br />
me and for the valuable talks we are having<br />
together. There are important bilateral issues<br />
between our countries, but the most urgent and<br />
enduring interests we have in common encompass<br />
a wider field-a closely shared and<br />
deeply felt commitment to the ideals of peace,<br />
security and rising living standards for all<br />
peoples. Perhaps we will come to see that<br />
higher living standards do not necessarily<br />
mean-and can no longer mean-more<br />
material goods. For many nations, expectations<br />
of greater prosperity of this kind have had to be<br />
postponed. Whether they will be restored depends,<br />
I believe, on the restoration of faith in the<br />
democratic order, of confidence in our society<br />
and in ourselves. For my part, I believe the<br />
world will overcome its present problems. I am<br />
confident that in the meantime the cultural, and<br />
indeed the spiritual, traditions of Italy and her<br />
people will help sustain mankind in its adjustment<br />
to a new social order, to a new scale of<br />
human values, that will be more just, more humane,<br />
more generous and more selfless than<br />
those we have known before. </p>
