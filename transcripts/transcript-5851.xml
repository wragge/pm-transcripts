PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 7 JULY 1982<br />
PURCHASE OF HISTORIC KETCH " FALIE"<br />
The Commonwealth Government is pleased to be associated<br />
with the purchase of the historic ketch " Falie" by the<br />
Government of South Australia. The Commonwealth has agreed<br />
to meet the full cost of $ 180,000 for purchasing the vessel.<br />
Last February the Premier of South Australia, Mr Tonkin,<br />
and I announced that the Commonwealth would make a gift of<br />
ft.$ 2 million to South Australia as a contribution to the<br />
State's Sesquicentennial celebrations in 1986. 1 believe<br />
that the purchase of the " Falie", in recognition of the<br />
importance of the coastal grain trade to the economic life<br />
of South Australia over many years, is a highly commendable<br />
project and worthy to receive this first instalment of the<br />
Commonwealth's $ 2 million gift.<br />
We wish the Government and people of South Australia well<br />
as they undertake the restoration of the " Falie". </p>
