22 May 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
SPEECH TO MACQUARIE FEC LUNCHEON,<br />
FAULCON BRIDGE BLUE MOUNTAINS<br />
E O E<br />
Thank you very much Kerry. To my other Parliamentary colleagues, Jim Lloyd, the<br />
Member for Robertson and the newly appointed Senator for New South Wales, Marise<br />
Payne, my former Parliamentary colleague, Alasdair Webster, the Mayor of<br />
Hawkesbury and the city of the Blue Mountains, other distinguished guests, ladies and<br />
gentlemen. It is always a pleasure to come back to the mountains. I first visited the Blue<br />
Mountains in 1946 and stayed at a guest house, since demolished, in Katoornba Street<br />
and came back on regular occasions through the 1950s and 1960s and more recently,<br />
apar-t from political ties, a few family ties have brought me on a regular basis to the<br />
Blue Mountains. And of course as a political cause, coming to this part of the world is<br />
always a great delight and I certainly remember the lunch that I attended here at a time<br />
when we were sort of gathering ourselves together for the great assault on the then<br />
Keating Government. It seems a hell of a long time ago. A lot of water has passed<br />
under the bridge and a lot has been achieved and a lot has changed. One thing I can<br />
say is that you've got a terrific Member in Kerry Bartlett, he really is first class.<br />
( inaudible) of a representative capacity. He really is a man of the mountains, if I can<br />
put it that way, in the sense that he understands the communities that make up the<br />
Macquarie electorate. It is an unusual electorate, I don't mean that critically, I mean<br />
that admiringly. It is an unusual electorate because it's made up of one single<br />
population centre but a series of population centres. It's got a lot of different character<br />
about it and it's got a lot of special affinities with the history of Sydney and the history<br />
of Australia and you have a really first class representative. </p>

Now I have come to the Blue Mountains especially today not only to attend this lunch<br />
but also to announce formally the launch of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia and<br />
the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia is the biggest ever capital investment by any<br />
Government of any political complexion in the environmental futture of Australia and I<br />
launched it at Wentworth Falls about an hour and a half ago and I am very proud of<br />
the fact that this project has been formally launched here in the Blue Mountains<br />
because Kerry reminded me when we were at Echo Point that I think after the Opera<br />
House, it's the second most visited place in Australia for overseas tourists and you<br />
could have believed it today. There were tourists from everywhere. It was a<br />
wonderfu~ l sight to be there and to remind myself of what a beautiful part of the world<br />
the Blue Mountains really is.<br />
Now that Natural Heritage Trust wvill provide $ 1.25 billion of capital investment in the<br />
environmental future of Australia and there will be some major projects like cleaning<br />
up the Murray Darling basin and tackling the salinity problems of Western Australia<br />
and Eastern Australia, but there will also be some small projects and I am very happy<br />
to announce today that we're going to allocate $ 1 million towards the development of<br />
a framework of integrated policies and mechanisms for the Nepean, for the<br />
Hawkesbury/ Nepean catchment and this $ 1 million is going to be administered by the<br />
Hawkesbury/ Nepean Trust and it will get strong community support and this<br />
catchment, that is the Hawkesbury/ Nepean catchment provides the bulk of Sydney's<br />
water supplies, has a veryv rich biodiversity, has over 500 plants and 2000 animal<br />
species, many of which have enormous conservation significance.<br />
Now this contribution of $ 1 million ou~ t of the Trust will make an important<br />
contribution towards the development of a more integrated approach to, or the<br />
potential of the catchment area and I am very, very happy after plenty of urging and<br />
arm twisting from the local Members, Jim Lloyd is here today too to sort of remind me<br />
that it's not just coming to the electorate of Macquarie but it will also be a very<br />
significant benefit to his electorate and I am very, very happy to announce that today.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, there are a few other things that I'd like to talk about. I'd like<br />
to talk about the recent budget. I would like to echo what Kerry Bartlett had to say<br />
and that is that nobody in this room and nobody anywhere in Australia should ever<br />
forget it. We did inherit a deficit of $ 10.5 billion. We were told by Mr Keating and<br />
Mr Beazley that the budget was in surplus. We found, I found the Sunday morning<br />
after the election, and I wasn't at my most energetic self, I've got to say, the day after<br />
the election I was at my most excited self but I wasn't all that energetic, I don't know<br />
why. Perhaps I hadn't slept a lot the night before and perhaps I celebrated a touch but<br />
I found on Sunday morning when those three officials from the Department of Prime<br />
Minister Cabinet walked in and presented me with a black book, or whether it was a<br />
blue book I forget now, but they presented me with this book that had all the<br />
information and I immediately looked up the thing to see what the underlying deficit<br />
was and it wasn't what we were told and in fact, the underlying deficit then was $ 10.5<br />
billion and by the end of the last year of our first term of government we will have<br />
turned that around to a surplus of $ 1.6 billion. And I know to a lot of people that's<br />
not very exciting. They say, oh well, that's just money. Your money. Not mine, not<br />
Peter Costello's, but your money, and what we've done is to fulfil the first obligation<br />
of any government and that is to make sure that the country lives within its means. </p>

You've got to do it. You run a business, you've got to do it. You run a household<br />
you've got to do it. If you run a nation you've got to do it and for too long we tried to<br />
do it otherwise. I mean, over the last six years this country ran up total debts of<br />
billion and in that period we created a miserly 16 000 jobs. That's 6 years up to the<br />
time that we came to power. By the year 2000 we will have halved, we will have cut<br />
by 50% the accumulated national debt of Australia compared with what it was in 1995.<br />
In the coming financial year we will repay $ 5 billion of the debts that were run up by<br />
Mr Keating and Mr Beazley $ 5 billion will be repaid and it's not a mere book entry<br />
because when you repay debt as you all know, you don't have to pay interest on it and<br />
that means that you keep getting better each year and equally, if you keep borrowing<br />
you keep getting worse each year, not only by the amount you borrow but also by the<br />
interest you've got to pay on the amount that you borrowved.<br />
Now I know in the process of doing this we have undoubtedly done some things that<br />
people don't like. I am sorry about that but it has been necessary. There's just no<br />
point of being in government unless you are prepared to do things that you know are in<br />
the long term interests of the country and Peter Costello and John Fahey and 1, as the<br />
three people principally responsible but the entire Government, and I acknowledge the<br />
strong support of the backbenchi and the understanding and the forbearance of newly<br />
elected members for some of the decisions that had to be taken. We set ourselves that<br />
task and I am very proud to say that in year three we will have got Australia back into<br />
the black and that is of enormous significance to the long term stability and the long<br />
term prosperity of Australia. The extraordinary thing is that we've been able to do that<br />
while at the same time we have delivered on all of the major promises that we made in<br />
the campaign and this morning I delivered by formally launching the Natural Heritage<br />
Trust of Australia, 1I delivered on the final major promise that I made at the last<br />
election campaign. Let me remind you, we promised a $ 1 billion family tax package<br />
delivered on time, in full on the first of January.<br />
We promised to deliver tax incentives for private health insurance and they will come<br />
in, in full without deduction on time on the first of July of 1997. It's a great pity that<br />
the former government hadn't taken the advice of its then Health Minister to introduce<br />
those subsidies five years ago. If they had have, some of the people who have recently<br />
dropped out of private health insurance wouldn't have done so because they could<br />
have afforded to remain in private health insurance.<br />
We have over delivered in a number of areas. From the first of July this year<br />
everybody in small business will be able to sell a business and invest up to $ 5 million of<br />
the proceeds of the sale of that business in the purchase of another business, without<br />
paying.., of any kind, not of the same kind, you can go from a restaurant to a software<br />
company. As far apart as that and that's pretty far apart. ' You can go from a<br />
restaurant to a software company and up to $ 5 million of the proceeds of that sale will<br />
be completely exempt from capital gains tax. Now that is a very significant change to<br />
the structure of capital gains tax in this country and it delivers more than what we<br />
promised to do in that area so far as capital gains tax is concerned.<br />
I am also very happy to say that the promises we made to self funded retirees in this<br />
country have also been over delivered. We said that we would lift the tax threshold for </p>
<p>Fax f rom 4 It 23/ 05/ 97 11: 09 Pg: 4<br />
MAY 23 ' 97 10: 49<br />
self funded retirees to the same lev'el as that applying to pensioners and this year will<br />
see the delivery of that commitment, this coming financial year. the delivery of that<br />
commitment in full. We also promised a far more modest savings initiative in the lead<br />
up to the election. It had a means test of $ 35 000. We are beiniz criticised, there's a<br />
new definition of broken promises in Canberra. If you deliver more than you<br />
promised, that's a broken promise. , I mean, that's the broken promise a la. the Labor<br />
Party and some members of the Parliamentary Press Gallery.<br />
I mean, it's amazing. They held up this document of mine and I said it in the election<br />
campaign it would have a means test and because we have delivered a more generous<br />
rebate and we don't have a means test, I have broken my word, I mean, amazing,<br />
absolutely amazing. In other words, if we had cut the deficit in one year instead of<br />
three that would have been a broken promise. It's an amazing sort of approach that<br />
some of these people really have. What was contained in the budget in the area of<br />
savings is a very significant recognition of the years of grit and the years of providence<br />
and careU living and saving for the future which has been the practice of so many self<br />
fuinded retirees in Australia. We have an across the board, non means tested,<br />
savings tax rebate and it represents for the first time an Australian Government actually<br />
doing something serious about encouraging savings. For years and years and years I<br />
have gone around this counter. I have met people, I have gone to lunches, I have gone<br />
on radio programmes, been berated by interviewers, questions interrupted, abused,<br />
everything, and people have said, what are you going to do about savings? We save<br />
and we pay tax on the money before we put it in the investment and then when we earn<br />
some interest we get taxed on it again and for the first time since Federation the<br />
Governmnent has done something about that so that represents over delivery of another<br />
very, very important commitment that we made before the last election campaign.<br />
Of course ladies and gentlemen, in the area of small business which has always been<br />
very important to me politically and it's always been very important economically to<br />
the future of the country and I remain as convinced as I was during the election<br />
campaign that revitalising small business, giving it more incentives, giving it more tax<br />
breaks, getting rid of unnecessary red tape, freeing the industrial relations system to<br />
allow small business to breathe a little easier and operate a little more efficiently and<br />
more expansively that that really holds the key to job generation in this country.<br />
You won't reduce unemployment in Australia by looking to the big companies. What<br />
you've got to do is create an economic climate where the businesses that employ 3 or<br />
4 people can afford to employ 5 or 6 people. That is the key, that's the way you<br />
reduce unemployment in this country, you don't look for large companies, they're a<br />
into downsizing. You don't look to governments because governments are responding<br />
quite properly to the desire of taxpayers to be efficient and to focus on the core<br />
responsibilities of government. What you've got to do is create a climate in which the<br />
3 and 4 small businesses become 5 and 6 smali businesses. And when you can do that,<br />
then you really do have the prospect, in a significant way, of reducing unemployment<br />
in this country. There are other forces that have an impact on unemployment but tha<br />
is a very, very major part of the equation.<br />
Now what have we done with small business. We have of course from the I1st of July<br />
introduced a very major tax concession in the area of capital gains tax. We have </p>
<p>Fax from 4 11 23/ 85/ 97 11: 09 Pg:<br />
MA1Y 23 ' 97 10: 50<br />
changed the industrial relations system so that in future it will be easier and more<br />
beneficial to negotiate workplace agreements and workplace contracts between small<br />
business and employees. Importantly, we have changed quite significantly the unfair<br />
dismissal laws and we've tackled the unfair dismissal laws in two stages. The first<br />
stage was to throw out the Brereton unfair dismissal law which really acted as a<br />
disincentive to take on people. I mean I lost count of the number of men and women<br />
in small business around Australia who came up to me at gatherings like this and said<br />
I'd take on some extra staff only I'm frightened I mightn't get somebody who worked<br />
out and if I try and get rid of them, they'll have me in court and I can't afford to settle<br />
for $ 15 or $ 20 000. 1 don't have that much money.<br />
And that has been a reality, it's been a reality now in this country for several years.<br />
Well we changed that, we took away the worst excesses of the Brereton unfair<br />
dismissal law but of course not having the numbers in the Senate to go quite as far as<br />
we would have like to have gone in the first time around. We tried again a few weeks<br />
ago to go even further. And that is, we put up a proposal in my small business<br />
statement which said that any small firm in Australia that employed fewer than<br />
people, and that is a very large number of small businesses in Australia, something like<br />
to 50 per cent of all small businesses in Australia employ fewer than 15 people.<br />
And what we said in relation to them was that for all of those firms they would be<br />
completely exempt, totally exempt from any kind of unfair dismissal law in relation to<br />
somebody who had been employed for less than 12 months.<br />
Now I think that's a pretty fair deal. You say to somebody right, I'll give you a go for<br />
a year. If it works out normal rules apply, but if it doesn't work out in the first twelve<br />
months well, we ought to par-t friends and that's it. Now I think anybody who runs a<br />
small business and I'll bet there are a lot of people in this room who are involved in<br />
small business, know that is the reality. And it's no good writing laws, writing unfair<br />
dismissal laws on the assumption that a five person restaurant business has the human<br />
resources department like BH-P. I mean it's a bit unrealistic. They don't and you've<br />
got to write laws that suit the small firms. So we proposed that and I thought that was<br />
pretty reasonable, but oh no, no that's exploitation according to the Labor Party. The<br />
Labor Party and Democrats and Senator Harradine, they're all going to vote against it,<br />
so we'll see. When that law comes up in the Senate there's going to be a motion of<br />
disallowance so we're told and if it's disallowed, well let me say on behalf of the<br />
Government we'll put it inside a Bill and we'll roll it up to the Senate again and we'll<br />
see what happens when they do that.<br />
We've also made a number of other changes in the small business area. We've done<br />
quite a lot to reduce the paperwork burden and we're also brought in a law that says<br />
that if you run any kind of business and the aggregate value of the fringe benefits you<br />
give to your employees, the aggregate value of the fringe benefits you give to your<br />
employees is less than $ 5 000 a year, then you have no obligation at all, no obligation<br />
at all to keep any records for the purposes of filing a finge benefits tax return. Now<br />
that once again is a very significant little change.<br />
Now all of these things are incremental and they all over a period of time will change<br />
the climate. We've seen some reductions of 1.5 per cent in across the board interest<br />
rates. Now I know the competitive environment for small business interest rates is not </p>
<p>Fax from 4 It 23/ 05/ 97 11: 09 Pg: 6<br />
MAY 23 ' 97 10: 51 P. 11<br />
as good as what it is for housing, I know that. And I think we need more competition<br />
in the banking system and not less. And that is one of the things that is going to<br />
motivate our response to the Wallis Inquiry and it's one of the things that is going to<br />
motivate our response to the way the whole of the financial system operates. I mean<br />
it's amazing what a bit of competition does. And we should never ever forget it when<br />
people come up to you saying, look, really you can have too much competition. I<br />
don't think you can have too much competition, you know, I think it's actually not a<br />
bad idea to have a lot of competition and that applies in a lot of areas. Competition is<br />
a good test and you need competition in areas like banks. I mean look at the housing<br />
area. The thing that has driven the sharper than average fall in housing loans over the<br />
last 12 months has been the entry of organisations like Aussie Home Loans and RAMS<br />
and those specialist housing providers. Now they have had a very, very significant<br />
impact and I think it's very, very important that we always keep that in mind, And if<br />
we could see something like that occur in the small business area, then I believe that<br />
would be exctraordinarily beneficial to small business community.<br />
Now ladies and gentlemen there are one or two other things around at the present<br />
time. And let me just mention one of them.<br />
We made an announcement yesterday that we were going to reduce Australia's<br />
migrant intake by about 10 per cent of what it was last year. Nowv there's been a<br />
rather curious response to that particular announcement and let me deal with some of<br />
the responses that have been made.<br />
The first thing that I want to say is that what we have done is not only reduce the<br />
overall size of the program but we have also quite unapologetically continued the shift<br />
towards having a greater proportion of migrants who come into Australia in the skilled<br />
category and a lower proportion in the family reunion category.<br />
Now I think that is a more balance immigration program. Let me remind you that the<br />
Government remains completely and utterly committed to a non-discriminatory<br />
immigration policy, utterly and strongly committed to non-discriminatory immigration<br />
policy. And I take the opportunity to say this because whenever you do anything<br />
about the level of immigration, you have the noisy people out there who say oh, you<br />
know it's racially motivated. Now let me say on behalf of the Government I couldn't<br />
repudiate that more strongly and more deeply because it was a Liberal Government<br />
that introduced non-discrimi nation into Australia's immigration program and we will<br />
never support an immigration programme that is based on notions of racial<br />
discrimination. I also notice that the rather empty populist who represents the seat of Oxley in the<br />
Federal Parliament, MArs. Hanson, is running around saying ' Oh, I did it. You know I<br />
persuaded them.' Well could I remind her, could remind the rest of Australia that my<br />
belief that there is a link between certain levels of immnigration and high unemployment<br />
goes back to 1991, which is five or six years ago, long before anybody had heard of<br />
the current occupant of the seat of Oxley. I think in those days it was certainly<br />
represented by somebody else. And this notion that we have in some way we have<br />
responded, I mean we cut the migrant programme last year, we've cut it again this<br />
year. We think it's right for Australia at the present level. </p>
<p>Fax from 4 11 23/ 05/ 97 11: e9 Pg: 7<br />
MAY 23 ' 97 10: 51 P1<br />
You've always got to adjust the immigration program according to the economic and<br />
social needs of the nation. Arnd you've always got to ask vourself what is in the best<br />
interests of Australia. And some of the old paradigms about immuigration have<br />
changed. You can't look at immigration in the 1990s in the way you looked at it in the<br />
1950s anid ' 60s. And those who say that it is beneficial for employment levels are, in<br />
my view, locked into the paradigms of the 1950s and 1960s and they don't understand<br />
the globalisation forces that are at work and impacting on the Australian economy in<br />
the 1990s. They don't understand the fact that amongst some groups within the<br />
Australian community, unemployment levels amongst recently arrived people in this<br />
country are as high as 45 and 50 per cent. Now that is not fair to them, it is not fair to<br />
the rest of the Australian community. And you have to adjust your program<br />
accordingly and you ought to be able to do it without any of these stupid allegations of<br />
racism, you ought to be able to do it without people who have had nothing to do with<br />
it claiming the credit, and you ought to be able without unreasonable criticism from<br />
people who are locked into the paradigms and attitudes towards migration of 1950s<br />
and We have made these changes because as a Government we believe, and I certainly very<br />
strongly believe that there is a link between the current high levels of unemployment<br />
and current levels of immigration and the current composition of the immigration<br />
programme and that is why wve thought it was in the national interest of Australia to<br />
make those changes and there was no other forces at work or no other pressures in<br />
operation. Ladies and gentlemen, the very, very last thing that I want to say to you is that it is<br />
great to be back, almost back on the stump. I mean I was down at Echo Point, we<br />
were down at Wentworth Falls, I'm back here in Kerry's seat talking to a very, very<br />
large gathering of supporters and people interested in the policies of the Government.<br />
It has been a very, very important 14 months.<br />
I mean one of the things I have tried to do is to keep in touch with people. I haven't<br />
always succeeded and like any other person occupying the sort of position I do, there<br />
obviously area areas where people have been critical and I accept and I understand<br />
that, it's part and parcel of the job. But what I have tried to do is not lock myself up in<br />
a little cocoon in Canberra. What I have tried to do is to move around this country. I<br />
think I'm the first Prime Minister of Australia for more than 10 or 20 years who's<br />
addressed a large, anybody come along, open air rally in rural Australia. I don't<br />
remember Mr Keating or Mr Hawke doing that. I do remember them for having some<br />
manicured forays into rural Australia, you know, visiting selected farms and having<br />
visited this or that, I mean that's easy to do. But I think what politics is all about often<br />
is going out and being prepared to stand up and if somebody wants to have a go at<br />
you, let them have a go at you. That's politics, that's Australian politics. That's what<br />
we believe in this country. We don't want cocooned Prime Ministers. We don't want<br />
cocooned leaders and cocooned politicians, we want people who are prepared to go<br />
and listen to their critics and to go back at them. And can I say that I intend to over<br />
the next 14 months to do that sort of thing on a regular basis because it is very, very<br />
important in mntaining contact and maintaining a link between myself and my<br />
Government and the people of Australia. </p>
<p>Fax from 4 It 23/ 05/ 97 11: 09 Pg: 8<br />
MAY 23 ' 97 10: 52 P. 13<br />
Ladies and gentlemen it still remains the greatest privilege that could come the way of<br />
any Australian to be Prime Minister of this magnificent country. And it's enormously<br />
refreshing for me to be back here today to be amongst supporters and friends and some<br />
interested observers and 1 am sure the odd critic. Well good on you because that is<br />
what the system is all about. Again can I say how well you are represented by Kerry<br />
Bartlett and what a tremendous impression that he is making as a very thoughtfual and<br />
understanding, effective backbencher, confidently getting on with the job, quietly<br />
winning concessions, quietly and effectively persuading ministers to do the right thing<br />
by his electorate and that's what the electorate of Macquarie needs and that's the sort<br />
of representation that Kerry Bartlett is giving. </p>
