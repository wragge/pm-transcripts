EMBARGO: AG NST DELIVERY<br />
CHECK AINST DELIVERY<br />
FOR MEDIA 2 APRIL 1979<br />
AUSTRALIAN MINING INDUSTRY COUNCIL<br />
It is a great pleasure to bc addressing the Australian Mining<br />
Industry Council tonight. As you know there is a national strike<br />
of certain transport workers. It is having a serious effect<br />
on Australian industry. The irresponsibility of the Transport<br />
Workers' Union leadership which is prepared to cut off<br />
essential food supplies to the cities knows no bounds. As<br />
a result of their action the Department of Industrial Relations<br />
is preparing a case to go before the Federal Court for<br />
deregistration of the Union.<br />
The trade union leaders seem incapable of grasping the fact<br />
that they and their members are part of the community that<br />
they are injuring by their actions. There are processes by<br />
which the Union's case can be properly heard. The Government<br />
will not tolerate -, the community will not tolerate the<br />
situation in which as a first step in the bargaining process<br />
trade unions inconvenience and harm the public in this<br />
case including hospital patients, families, and small children.<br />
There is no way that a trade union leadership can prevail<br />
against the resolution of Government and the determination of<br />
citizens. But it's an ill wind that doesn't blow some good.<br />
The strike also restricts the mobility of politicians.<br />
They cannot attend as many speaking engagements. Fortunately,<br />
your meeting was in Canberra and I still remember how to drive.<br />
I am happy that I made it and can speak to you at a time when<br />
economic and business conditions are improving.<br />
We have had to negotiate a difficult path to reach this point.<br />
In any complex economy there is a long lead time between<br />
initiating correct economic policies and their producing the<br />
desired results. We have had to deal with Labor's economic<br />
legacy and overcome it. This has taken effort and determination<br />
but now many people can see that our policies are working.<br />
No doubt you would like me to tell you what the future holds<br />
which reminds me of the qualifications required of an economist.<br />
It is the ability to foretell what will happen tomorrow, next<br />
month, next year, and to explain afterward why it did not happen.<br />
What has happened is that the Government has set the conditions<br />
for economic recovery in Australia and business is taking<br />
advantage of this. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Confidence in our country's growth prospects has increased<br />
with the release of major economic Surveys. The February<br />
Metal Trades Industry survey found three quarters of the<br />
respondents expecting improvement in general business and<br />
employment conditions in 1979. The March Confederation of<br />
Australian Industry and the Bank of New South Wales survey<br />
found a majority of respondents predicting an improvement in<br />
the general business situation. Your own Council survey suggests<br />
that mining companies expect to increase their investment in<br />
1979 by 32 percent, and this is on top of an increase of<br />
51 percent in 1978.<br />
A succession of economic statistics show that this confidence<br />
is well based. The National Accounts released on Thursday show<br />
that real GDP in the December Quarter 1978 was 5.5 percent<br />
above the previous December Quarter and real non-farm GDP grew<br />
by 4.3 percent for the samer period. While the National Account<br />
figures are always subject to revision, this result is the<br />
best for a long time. It confirms the thrust of economic surveys,<br />
and the general mood of confidence.<br />
The growth in GDP for 1978-79 is expected to be the highest<br />
for some years. Private investment grew by 24 percent in 1978<br />
and reamins at a high level. A number of industries are<br />
reporting that order books are filling up. Moreover, BLIP's sales<br />
within Australia rose 17 percent in the six months to November 1978.<br />
As a result of our sales tax reductions and the introduction of<br />
world class models, the motor vehicle industry is showing signs<br />
of renewed strength with February registrations seasonally<br />
adjusted growing by 13 percent over January.<br />
The February seasonally adjusted private new dwelling approvals<br />
were 14 percent higher than in February 1978. Our rural industries<br />
are having their best year for a very long time. Company profits<br />
are rising and a number of major companies have reported<br />
increases in interim after tax profits of over 20 percent.<br />
Australia is now more competitive than it has been for seven<br />
years. Australian industries are again a force to be reckoned<br />
with here and abroad. In the three months ended February 1979,<br />
total exports seasonally adjusted were 13 percent higher than in<br />
the previous three months.<br />
In the employment area, seasonally adjusted civilian employment<br />
has increased for each of the last seven months the first time<br />
this has occurred for five years and seasonally adjusted<br />
overtime and vacancies are rising..<br />
Our policies have brought inflation down dramatically. Under our<br />
predecessors it was 17.5 percent in the year to March 1975.<br />
It is now about 8 percent. We are determined to maintain the<br />
policies that have made this progress possible. We will keep<br />
up the fight against inflation. .3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
We will maintain the policy of expenditure restraint. We<br />
will continue to keep the growth of the money supply within<br />
sensible bounds, which will allow the economy to grow in real<br />
terms while continuing to bear down on inflation. We will<br />
continue to argue in the strongest possible terms for wage<br />
restraint. Because of our policies, business can look to the future with<br />
confidence and plan with certainty. Steady responsible<br />
economic management and good long-term prospects for Australia<br />
are important for all businesses. They are crucial for the mining<br />
industry where planning horizons are long, and financial<br />
requirements large.<br />
Bearing in mind the economic disarray that we faced on coming<br />
to office, the progress that has been made over the last three<br />
years is outstanding. We have put behind us Labor's policies<br />
and Australia's development is going ahead again. By June we<br />
expect capital expenditure in resource development projects to<br />
have approximately doubled in two years.<br />
On the trade scene there is a much brighter outlook for metal<br />
prices and markets. New markets are emerging for our iron ore<br />
and coking coal. The expanding markets in the Asian region<br />
such as Korea are particularly promising. The modernisation<br />
and expansion of the steel industry in China has opened up an<br />
important new market for Australian iron ore. This is good news<br />
for Australia because mining is a vital sector of our economy.<br />
In 1969-70 mining accounted for less than 30 percent of our<br />
exports. Today mining accounts for nearly 40 percent of<br />
Australia's export earnings.<br />
The Government has provided special incentives to the mining<br />
and petroleum industries because we are confident in your future.<br />
These include the extension of tax-depreciable capital expenditure<br />
to cover port development, increases in depreciation rates for<br />
transportation facilities and accelerated depreciation for<br />
allowable capital expenditure on mine or oil field development..<br />
Mining companies are, of course, also eligible for the investment<br />
allowance. The assist the industry, and to help State Governments finance<br />
infrastructure, we supported the Loan Council decision giving<br />
State Government instrumentalities improved access to Australian<br />
and overseas funds. The first infrastructure financing<br />
arrangements will amount to more than $ 1.7 billion. It will<br />
support projects such as the $ 700 million Worsley alumina<br />
project in Western Australia and the $ 620 million coal loading<br />
project at Hay Point in Queensland. These projects are only<br />
some of the new mining and mineral processing developments in<br />
Australia. The impressive list of new announcements includes<br />
the $ 500 million Gladstone aluminium smelter, the $ 200 million<br />
Wagerup alumina project and the Ranger and Narbalek uranium<br />
projects. It is the Government's policy to encourage developments<br />
such as the Gladstone aluminium smelter which involve further<br />
domestic processing of our resources. The realities of economnics<br />
put Australia increasingly in a strong position to process minerals.<br />

We are an energy rich nation. We are about 70 percent<br />
self-sufficient in crude oil. We have extensive resources<br />
of coal suitable for power generation, for energy use and for<br />
export. We have substantial reserves of natural gas and our<br />
reserves of uranium are of world rank. We have appropriate<br />
energy policies designed to encourage the search for and<br />
development of our energy resources, as well as ensuring<br />
that these scarce resources are not squandered.<br />
Of particular importance in this context is our crude oil<br />
pricing policy. For some years oil in Australia was priced<br />
at an unrealistically low level. The Commonwealth's policy<br />
of bringing oil prices to world parity will serve the Government's<br />
fundamental energy objectives of encouraging the exploration<br />
and development of our oil resources,' greater economies in<br />
the use of energy, further use of alternatives to oil, and<br />
intensive research in the development of alternatives to oil.<br />
Some countries have attempted to insulate their econom ies from<br />
movements in international oil prices. This has resulted in<br />
them using an excessive amount of the world's energy. It cannot<br />
stave off the necessity of adjusting to the reality of<br />
international oil prices. It can only make the inevitable<br />
adjustment more painful. Our policies in relation to LP gas<br />
support our oil policies. We give a continuing preferential<br />
excise concession to LPG as against motor spirit. To<br />
provide a substantial incentive to producers to expand their<br />
markets we have also removed the price of naturally occurring<br />
LPG from the ambit of the Prices Justification Tribunal.<br />
Another aspect of our energy policy relates to research<br />
and development. This year the Government has made available<br />
million for a specific energy research and development<br />
programme. This amount is over and above that provided through<br />
norma. funding to such bodies as the CSIRO, the Atomic Energy<br />
Commission and the Bureau of Mineral Resources.<br />
The Government has established the National Energy Research<br />
Development and Demonstration Council to help co-ordinate<br />
energy research in Australia and to advise the Government on<br />
research developments in Australia and overseas. The Government<br />
has also established a coal research programme, financed by<br />
a levy of 5 cents per tonne of coal production. As this<br />
programme develops in coming years the returns to industry<br />
from its activities should be substantial, for instance<br />
by deriving alternative uses for coal.<br />
Our oil policies in conjunction with our taxation and<br />
investment incentives have seen a large addition to our known<br />
reserves and a substantial increase in exploration activity.<br />
Australia's oil reserves have been upgraded by over 600 million<br />
barrels which constitutes about three years additional supply<br />
at current levels of consumption. </p>
<p>Oil exploration activity is at a high and rising level.<br />
According to industry estimates between 83 and 143<br />
exploration wells could be drilled in 1979. Even the lower<br />
end of this forecast would constitute the best result for<br />
seven years. Esso and BHP are committed to investing over<br />
$ 1,000 million in exploration and development activity over<br />
the next five years. By 1985 it is estimated that 30 percent<br />
of Australia's crude oil production will be derived from<br />
fields which have become directly viable as a result of our<br />
energy policies and incentives. This revival is of obvious<br />
importance if we are to maintain an appropriate level of<br />
self-sufficiency towards the turn of the century.<br />
Recent events in Iran and the associated disruption in the<br />
world's oil supplies, combined with last week's announcement<br />
in Geneva of a 9.1 percent rise in official OPEC prices,<br />
have again underlined the importance of the Government's<br />
energy policies. Our comparative advantage in energy will be<br />
of immense advantage to Australian miners an advantage<br />
which will increase with every passing year.<br />
We are a favoured country for international investment because<br />
of our resources, because of our valuable energy supplies and<br />
our labour force, and as importantly because we have a<br />
stable political climate. This is of crucial importance in<br />
developing confidence and the predictability that is essential<br />
to successful economic enterprise. Our political stability<br />
creates confidence in Australia as a reliable economic partn'er.<br />
Recent developments in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa<br />
have underlined the importance of political stability and<br />
have highlighted the risks and uncertainties that have become<br />
a characteristic of thc present international scene. The<br />
strategic environment is changing rapidly and some of the<br />
world's most resource rich regions have become the focus<br />
of political instability, throwing into doubt the access<br />
to resources by the world's industrialised nations.<br />
In a world troubled by instability and uncertainty and<br />
with political unheaval and turmoil in many of the world's<br />
potential resource producing countries, Australia has a major<br />
role to play. We must make the most of the opportunities<br />
which are now emerging.<br />
The economic outlook for Australia is promising. The Commonwealth's<br />
firm and successful policies have been essential to achieving<br />
this, but no less important is the fact that there are companies<br />
with vision, companies which realise that our resource rich<br />
nation has the potential to assume a far more important role<br />
in world trade. Only the private sector can develop our<br />
resources. No Government initiative can replace the private<br />
sector's vital role. We have provided a stable and certain<br />
framework within which companies can operate. We look to<br />
Australian enterprises to succeed in this favourable environment.<br />
