SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF COUNTER-TERRORIST TRAINING FACILITIES<br />
SPECIAL AIR SERVICE REGIMENT<br />
SWANBOURNE " 3 OCTOBER 1991<br />
General Grat: Lon,<br />
Colonel Lewis,<br />
distinguished guests,<br />
ladies and gentlemen<br />
It gives me great pleasure to be here today to open the<br />
Special Air Service Regiment's counter-terrorist training<br />
facilities. Over the years I have heard a great deal about the<br />
Regiment's capabilities and it is reassuring to see at<br />
first-hand your high level of skills and expertise.<br />
As we are all aware, there is a certain aura about the<br />
Special Air Service Regiment.<br />
The Regiment is recognised as a highly trained force that<br />
Australians will be able to rely upon in the most<br />
exceptional of circumstances. Its worldwide reputation has<br />
been earned t: he hard way, through years of training and<br />
commitment, and from the numerous sacrifices which are part<br />
of becoming a highly dedicated and professional military<br />
force.<br />
This Government regards terrorism as a horrifying and<br />
senseless phenomenon which is beyond justification,<br />
regardless of the circumstances.<br />
Australia must be prepared to act resolutely where terrorism<br />
threatens innocent life, and, as a final resort, to sanction<br />
the use of force.<br />
While Austral~ ia has, in many ways, been lucky in avoiding<br />
terrorism, we have not escaped unscathed. We cannot assume<br />
on the basis of geography or some misplaced sense of<br />
optimism that: Australia is removed from the world of the<br />
terrorist. </p>
<p>And as the Gulf War demonstrated, the threat of terrorism is<br />
with us and will remain with us for a long time to come. As<br />
a Government we must, and will, continue to face up to this<br />
threat and ensure that Australians are protected from<br />
terrorism.<br />
We will continue to work towards the peaceful resolution of<br />
conflict, wherever it may occur. We will continue to be at<br />
the forefront of nations seeking international co-operation<br />
in the fight against terrorism. We will continue to support<br />
international moves to ensure that terrorists are held<br />
accountable for their actions. And we will continue to<br />
ensure that Australia has a balanced and effective defence<br />
against terrorism.<br />
And in particular, we will continue to look to the Special<br />
Air Service Regiment to provide a counter-terrorist<br />
capability that is the equal of any in the world.<br />
Australia has come a long way since the tragic Hilton<br />
bombing incident in 1978. The Commonwealth, in close cooperation<br />
with the States and Territories, has worked<br />
solidly at developing sensible and balanced counterterrorist<br />
arrangements. This was clearly demonstrated<br />
during the Gulf crisis, when Australia's counter-terrorist<br />
authorities operated effectively at a higher level of alert<br />
for an extended period of time.<br />
It is of great satisfaction to the Government that no<br />
Australian suffered injury as a result of terrorism during<br />
the Gulf War.<br />
These Special Training Facilities form an important element<br />
of Australia's counter-terrorism arrangements. Their very<br />
existence and the skills which they hone may well contribute<br />
in a measurable way to deter an act of terrorism. They are<br />
also concrete evidence of this Government's continued<br />
commitment to deal firmly and realistically with the threat<br />
of terrorism.<br />
And while I sincerely hope that the skills of the Regiment<br />
will never be called upon for this purpose, I recognise that<br />
a highly trained and suitably equipped counter-terrorist<br />
force is an unfortunate necessity in an unpredictable and<br />
often violent world.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
These world class training facilities represent, in many<br />
ways, a quantum leap in technology. They are a tribute to<br />
the ingenuity and imagination of the designers and engineers<br />
from both the Australian Defence Force and the Australian<br />
Construction Service. </p>
<p>3.<br />
We must never~ forget, however, that these facilities are<br />
secondary to the men and women of this Regiment. It is to<br />
you that Australia will look, as a last resort when<br />
everything else has failed, to resolve a terrorist incident.<br />
In such circumstances this country will need your expertise<br />
and your professionalism.<br />
I am confident that, should the need ever arise, you will<br />
live up to these high expectations.<br />
I am also confident that as Australia moves towards the<br />
twenty-first century, we will continue to have a<br />
counter-terrorist capability that is amongst the foremost irk<br />
the world.<br />
I am confident of that because of two key qualities which<br />
are character~ istic of the Australian Defence Force as a<br />
whole, but which are particularly reflected in the Special<br />
Air Service Regiment, and among that elite most clearly in<br />
the Tactical Assault Group. Those two characteristics are<br />
the real foundations of the fine new facilities we are to<br />
open here today.<br />
The first of those characteristics is great dedication to<br />
technical expertise. Throughout the ADF, technical<br />
expertise is a matter not just of pride but of life and<br />
death. But as we have seen here this morning, nowhere is<br />
that more literally true than in the Tactical Assault Group.<br />
My government places confidence in the SAS because we know<br />
that it can do its supremely difficult job so well. This is<br />
a profession of perfectionists; near enough is simply not<br />
good enough. These buildings are a testament to their<br />
commitment to perfecting the skills which we in the<br />
Government, and which all Australians, rely on them to<br />
maintain at a razor pitch.<br />
But like perfection in any field, the extraordinary skills<br />
of the men and women of the Special Air Service Regiment are<br />
not perfected without great cost. To all of them, the<br />
effort in sheer hard work, punishing training, demanding<br />
exercises, and the psychological strains unique to their<br />
profession constitute an extraordinary price to pay. So all<br />
of them, all of you here today, show to an extraordinary<br />
degree the second of the two characteristic qualities of the<br />
ADF which I mentioned the quality of dedication and<br />
sacrifice. But as Colonel Lewis has said for some the sacrifice has<br />
been even greater. Their dedication exemplifies your<br />
commitment. Their spirit animates your regiment. It is<br />
therefore alt~ ogether fitting that this new facility should<br />
bear the name of one of their number: Sergeant Ewan Miller.<br />
I am honoured to declare open the Sergeant Ewan Miller<br />
Special Training Facility; and to those of you who will work<br />
here, my best: wishes, and more importantly the best wishes<br />
of the people of Australia. </p>
