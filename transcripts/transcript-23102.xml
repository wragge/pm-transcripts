    <content><![CDATA[<p>A Kmart Wishing Tree has been erected in the Prime Minister’s office to help the good work the Salvation Army does to ensure a happier Christmas for thousands of Australian children and families.</p>
<p>Right up until Christmas Eve, visitors and guests to the Prime Minister’s office will be encouraged to bring a gift to place under the tree. The Salvos will distribute these gifts to people doing it tough this year.</p>
<p>Six million gifts have been donated since the Kmart Wishing Tree was established 26 years ago. Last year alone, nearly 450,000 gifts were distributed by the Salvos to all corners of the continent.</p>
<p>The target for 2013 is 500,000 gifts by Christmas Eve and I hope that Members of Parliament, Senators, parliamentary staff, the Press Gallery, broader diplomatic corps in Canberra and visitors to Parliament House can play a part in reaching that total.</p>
