FREEDO1,1 tINDE',-R THE LAW<br />
Of late, we have heard a great deal a&amp;-out the problem of<br />
freedom under the law, and what it means.<br />
Democracy and the guarantee of individlual human ri-ghts to<br />
freedom and inderendence dernend on two concents. They are: the rule of<br />
law and thne maintenance of p~ ubli'% c ord! er;-and kegu] Lar free Parliamentary<br />
elections. The rule of law means that everybody has equal freedom and<br />
equal rights under Jlavs t-hich are administered fairly, impartially and<br />
honestly. That mcans freedom for ' cvcry*) ody, without any sort of discrimination.<br />
To be effective' the rule of law requires discipline and the<br />
use of sanctions which, in turn, require legal enforcement. That is what<br />
the maintenance of nublic order means.<br />
It is truly said that witi-out law is without liberty. When w,-<br />
speak of freedom we mean your freedom under the It is not a licence<br />
to do as you please without reastraint, or without respect for the rights<br />
of othe-rs. For some, particularly zsore young neo ple, these ideas may now<br />
seem dull and boring. For somo*. it may seoem fashionable or exciting to<br />
becom3 involved with the' so-callad conscientious breaking of tho law,<br />
through civil disobedience. Such * po'le are easily exploited and<br />
manipulated by a small hard-core group of militant activists hecause of<br />
their relatively innocent Political idealism. Thi. s hard--core group<br />
makes no pretence whatsoevor of rcsnect for t'he law or concern for<br />
democracy, although as -most of us know, thcy ful. ly exp~ loit democratic<br />
fre; e doms to oreach their own nronacaanda.<br />
Our political op~ ponents try to ridicule and degrade froedom<br />
undcir the law with a smokescreen of self righteousncss, or wvith attacks<br />
on the nolice. Let11 us look at the facts about this kind of civil dis.-<br />
obedionce. In 19i79, thore wer 18 such i4ncide--nts throughout Australia,<br />
In 19170, total was 3A. In 1971, it morc than doubled to 88. 1972<br />
is going to be much worse:. This month alono, there have:_ boen 16 incidents,<br />
almost as many as for the 171olce of 1969. ./ 2 </p>
<p>Of these at least 25 per cent are claimed by self-styled<br />
" liberation army" groups. These grouns have a distinct terrorist flavour<br />
and their aim is destruction rather than dissent.<br />
The foremost objective of the Liberal Party platform is " An<br />
Australian Nation Dedicated to Political Liberty and the Freedom and<br />
Dignity of Man". We believe in the right of dissent. But dissent must<br />
be within the law. Repeated campaigns of civil disobedience of the kind<br />
I have mentioned tend to weaken the authority of the law. It is the<br />
old story of dripping water. Each particular act may not be important<br />
in itself but each one does its bit to bring the whole notion of the<br />
rule of law into contempt, and each act encourages the idea that the<br />
law can be brushed aside or crushed if it interferes with political<br />
objectives of others. That is where we differ so strongly from today's<br />
Labor Party. So I want to emphasise that Labor deliberately promotes and<br />
oublicises the notion that if a law interferes with oolitical purposes,<br />
it can be brushed aside. What a contrast between today's Labor leadership<br />
and when John Cur-in led the Labor Party He said it would be<br />
treading on dangerous soil to set the Labor Party up as a non lawobserving<br />
party by accepting a policy of revolt against the law.<br />
Many Australians must wonder why, and how, the Labor Party<br />
abandoned John Curtin's principles.<br />
Last year we amended the Commonwealth law about -public order,<br />
and one of Australia's leading constitutional lawyers an acknowledged<br />
expert commented " The underlying theory of all these provisions is that neaceful<br />
assembly and procession should be allowed, but not to the<br />
extent of nersistent occunation or sit-in.<br />
" This", he said, " Won't please the many contemporary'civil<br />
libertarians who are prepared to give the demonstration<br />
priority over all other public occupations, but I should<br />
think it corresponds to the majority view on the proper<br />
limits of civil nrotest.'<br />
We think the same way that is why we strengthened the law.<br />
These principles are the guarantee of your freedom.<br />
That is why we stand for freedom and liberty within the<br />
authority of the law.<br />
The law is there to protect you. </p>
