PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA,<br />
TUESDAY 13TH NOVEMBER 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well ladies and gentlemen any questions.<br />
QUESTION: The Singapore Foreign Minister, Mr Rajaratnam said<br />
that he wants to raise with you the question of the defence of<br />
South East Asia and the Five Power Arrangement. He suggested<br />
that relations between Singapore and Australia could break down<br />
if the Five Power Arrangement collapsed. Do you see any<br />
differences of opinion with Singapore over the defence of the<br />
South East Asian region?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Five Power Arrangements are supported by<br />
the Australian Government, I expect that they will continue.<br />
Any differences that there have been between Australia and<br />
Singapore were raised by Mr Lee Kuan Yew at Ottawa early in<br />
August, with one exception, they were all matters of differences<br />
of view which had arisen under the McMahon or earlier Governments.<br />
I am looking forward very much to seeing Mr Rajaratnam, I've<br />
known him for many years. I will be happy to discuss any matter<br />
he chooses to raise.<br />
QUESTION: Unclear<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The repatriation of students.<br />
QUESTION: In your interest to have your concept of an Asian<br />
co-operative grouping formed, would you give way on the membership<br />
of the United States and the Soviet Union if necessary. Would<br />
you accept their admission?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I won't speculate on membership as extensive<br />
as that. I have never suggested it.<br />
QUESTION: I would like to ask a question on Parliamentary<br />
Privileges, particularly in view of the fact that an increasing<br />
number of Australians will be coming before Parliamentary Committees<br />
and being subject to these archaic laws. On the 9th of December<br />
1971 in the House of Representatives, your said: " My own Party<br />
is committed to the proposition that Procedures and Privileges<br />
of Parliament, we used the term in the plural because we think<br />
it should apply to State Parliaments as well and their committees,<br />
should be adapted to contemporary standards of efficiency and<br />
justice." Will you continue along this line?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am committed to that proposition, because I<br />
think I helped to frame it when it was put in the Australian Labor<br />
Party's Platform at the Conference in mid-1971. I have already<br />
raised many of the matters in the Platform concerning Standing<br />
orders of the Parliament in the Standing orders Committee of the<br />
House of Representatives. I think the Speaker is trying to arrange<br />
a meeting of that committee this coming week. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
QUESTION: Will you raise the Privileges matter at that meeting?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not sure that I will be raising that.<br />
offhand, one of the matters I have asked them to consider and<br />
I asked them to consider this some months ago is procedure for<br />
rostering ministers in one House to answer questions without<br />
notice in the other House. As you know, this is done in the<br />
Indian Parliament, where Ministers have to be members of Parliament,<br />
and obviously it happens in many of those parliamentary systems<br />
where Ministers can't be members of Parliament but are rostered<br />
to answer questions in each House of the Parliament. That<br />
happens in the Low Countries and in France. So I raised this<br />
at a very early meeting of the Standing Orders Committee after<br />
we became the Government. I forget the other matters. That<br />
particular matter I mentioned there ' is specified in the Labor<br />
Party's Platform.<br />
QUESTION: Just of this privileges matter, sir, you did describe<br />
the present privileges position as archaic in 1971, but what<br />
are youf doing about not making it archaic?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: As I have told you, I have raised one matter<br />
that I can recall, one matter which I raised at the earliest<br />
moment, a matter which is specified in the Party's Platform,<br />
specified largely on my initiative. I believe Mr Chalmers is<br />
referring to the fact that it is a breach it is a contempt<br />
of Parliament for a newspaper to publish a report of a<br />
parliamentary committee before it has been presented to the<br />
Parliament. This is a matter which is concerning many Members<br />
of Parliament at the moment. As the Standing Orders are at<br />
the moment, and I believe as they always have been I think we<br />
get it from the British too -it is a contempt of Parliament<br />
for a newspaper ( and in this respect the position of a journalist<br />
or an editor of a newspaper is the same as any other citizen)<br />
it is a contempt of Parliament for the report of a parliamentary<br />
committee to be published before the Parliament itself has<br />
received the report from its committee.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, would you agree to appear in a face-to-face<br />
debate with Mr Snedden on the prices and incomes referendum?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This matter was raised with me at the National<br />
Press Club Luncheon, which I attended at the invitation of<br />
many of you, last Thursday. The suggestion was that in the week<br />
before 8 December referendums on prices and incomes, the National<br />
Press Club should have a luncheon to discuss those issues, as<br />
it always does on the eve of a House of Representatives elections<br />
and I think, the. Senate elections. The proposition was that<br />
instead of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition<br />
appearing separately at luncheons before the club, as happens<br />
on the eve of elections for the House of Representatives or the<br />
Senate, they might appear together. I said I would be happy to<br />
do so. I made the suggestion that whoever gave an opening speechwhatever<br />
order that was there should be a summing up in the<br />
reverse order. Presumably, the order would be Prime Minister,<br />
Leader of the opposition, then questions from all of you, then<br />
Leader of the Opposition and Prime Minister summing up. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Since the National Press Club has become something<br />
of a shambles because of seven million outsiders attending it,<br />
would you be prepared to do the same thing in a television<br />
studio instead?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Let me see what happens with the National Press<br />
Club invitation. I think I can say it was an invitation it<br />
was certainly a suggestion to which I responded positively.<br />
In other words I suppose, to put it in ordinary English, to which<br />
I said yes.<br />
QUESTION: My quest * ion is in relation to the referendum. In an<br />
address to the Australian Electrical Manufacturers Association<br />
in Canberra on September 17, you said that if the referendum<br />
on prices was carried, the first move would be against land<br />
prices, and you continued that by Christmas legislation would<br />
be passed to stabilise land prices. Could I ask you, sir,<br />
that in view of the time it takes for writs to be returned, is<br />
this going to be possible and, if not, do you think the House<br />
will be able to get up on December 6 which was proposed earlier<br />
on? PRIME MINISTER: You have a good point there. I did say that.<br />
Subsequently, I realised that there would have to be time for<br />
the return of the writs or any challenges I don't think challenges<br />
are likely but we have to await the return of the writs before<br />
the Parliament can pass bills under the new constitutional power<br />
conferred at the referendum. You asked me also when the Parliament<br />
would be getting up. I doubt if the Parliament will be getting<br />
up on 6 December. I can't be certain when the Senate will get up,<br />
but I doubt whether the House of Representatives will get up<br />
*. on the 6 of December.<br />
QUESTION: Will it still be possible to get it through before<br />
Christmas? PRIME MINISTER: The return of the writs takes longer than<br />
Christmas. QUESTION: It is not generally known, but I hope you won't mind<br />
it being made known, that you are a fairly learned bloke in<br />
matters of theology, with as good a knowledge of doctrine and<br />
Church history as any man I know who is in holy orders. Can you<br />
tell us whether in this post-or sub-Christian country in which<br />
we now live but above all in this post-conciliar period when<br />
people have arrived at the idea of God which I think you arrived<br />
at many many years ago, where we are getting to the essence of<br />
what Christian belief is would you agree that in China there is,<br />
in fact, a spirit of applied Christianity which is obvious<br />
throughout all Chinese life economic, social, political and<br />
the kind that we in this decadent, bourgeois, western democratic<br />
state--<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You can call me bourgeois but you are not going<br />
to call me decadent.<br />
QUESTION: The point I would like you to say something about,<br />
although I realise there are more interesting political matters </p>
<p>-4-<br />
than this, is whether you would agree that there is an<br />
extraordinary parallel between Chairman Mao's dictum " We must<br />
be modest and prudent, avoid arrogance and rashness and serve<br />
the people"<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I follow that myself.<br />
QUESTION: Well, not yourself actually, but another -' the Lord<br />
Christ, who said 2,000 years ago, " He who shall be chiefest<br />
among you shall be the servant of all". Would you care to give<br />
us your thoughts on this parallel if, in fact, there is one<br />
between Chairman Mao's somewhat lengthy thing and Jesus Christ's<br />
somewhat pithier--<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know that I would respond to questions<br />
on this subject to anybody other than yourself. It is about<br />
years since we last spoke in Canberra. I want to make it<br />
plain that I don't hold myself out as an expositor of Christian<br />
doctriLne or ethics. I find them interesting and I wouldn't be<br />
altogether unacquainted with them, but I do not assume the role<br />
of explaining or propounding them. Also, you will realise<br />
there are risks in making any comparisons between communism and<br />
Christianity between Mao and our Lord. Nevertheless, I would<br />
think it clear, as many of you have now had the opportunity of<br />
observing for yourselves in China, that there is a degree of<br />
dignity accorded to individuals whatever their calling, whatever<br />
their age, which we do not find in countries which have been, and<br />
still claim to be, Christian. There is a r . espect for one's<br />
fellow man and woman to be seen in China which, I believe, is<br />
admirable.<br />
QUESTION: Last week in Parliament you said that you expected<br />
that ministers would answer in the spirit of the answers which<br />
you had given to questions. Since then in the last week<br />
ten ministers failed to give an answer on' interdepartmental<br />
committees in the same spirit that you did. Will you make sure<br />
they do give an answer?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: They have not failed to answer questions in the<br />
spirit in which I have answered questions. I will take you back<br />
to the position which applied before the elections. Preceding<br />
Australian Governments, in answer to questions about what they<br />
were doing on certain subjects, would answer: " We have established<br />
an interdepartmental committee". After Mr McMahon became<br />
Prime Minister, no answers were ever given to questions about what<br />
departments were represented on those committees, when the<br />
committees were appointed, when they had reported or when they<br />
were expected to report. What the Labor Party in Opposition and,<br />
not least, I myself constantly complained about was that the<br />
Government was hiding behind interdepartmental committees. It<br />
was using them as an alibi for failing to act or deferring action.<br />
I have made it plain and all my ministers have also made it plain<br />
and there has been a complete set of questions put to all of them<br />
we have all made it plain that if any question is asked about<br />
the membership or the timetable or the charter of an interdepartmental<br />
committee it will be answered. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Would you accept that it is difficult to ask a<br />
question about any specific interdepartmental committee if your<br />
ministers will not enable you to know the names of any committees<br />
that exist?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. We have frequently announced the matters that<br />
are being considered by interdepartmental committees. I take you<br />
back to the earliest conferences that I held with you, when I<br />
referred to the appointment of interdepartmental committees<br />
to consider revaluation assistance. You asked me what departments<br />
were on them; I told you.<br />
QUESTION: Before any mining licences are granted for uranium<br />
mining in the Northern Territory, will local Aboriginal groups<br />
be asked whether or not they want such mining and, secondly, if<br />
they do want such mining will that mining be on their terms and<br />
conditions in regard to Aboriginal equality and Aboriginal<br />
financial return from that mining?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This matter is still being considered.<br />
QUESTION: The Queensland Premier has blamed Canberra, or your<br />
Government, for its attitude towards foreign investment rates<br />
for the failure of a foreign group of companies to go ahead<br />
with an aluminium smelter at Weipa. Do you accept that criticism?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We don't propose to down-value the Australian<br />
dollar in order to accommodate the foreign companies interested<br />
in a smelter at Weipa.<br />
QUESTION: Following on from the interdepartmental committees,<br />
I understood from what you said in the House that you would<br />
instruct your ministers not to give the answer which they have<br />
all given so far on interdepartmental committees that you would<br />
instruct your ministers to tell the Leader of the Opposition, if<br />
he asked, which interdepartmental committees each specific<br />
minister, or each specific minister's department, was represented<br />
on. Do I understand from this answer that this is no longer the<br />
case? PRIME MINISTER: You are not correctly quoting what I said about<br />
my ministers. My ministers have said precisely what I said;<br />
they have quoted what I said. I believe I said it on 20 September.<br />
I have repeated the gist of it now to Mr Farmer: namely, that<br />
any questions about particular interdepartmental committees,<br />
their composition, their charter, their timetable, will be answered;<br />
and my ministers have done that in respect of any that have been<br />
named. They will do it in respect of any that are named.<br />
QUESTION: But with respect, you yourself gave an answer to<br />
Mr Snedden which described which interdepartmental committees the<br />
Prime Minister's Department was represented on. Your other<br />
ministers have not. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, let's be precise. I went further than the<br />
undertaking I gave on 20 September by giving, in answer to a<br />
further question Mr Snedden asked about which interdepartmental<br />
committees had been established since we took office on which<br />
we were represented, by giving him that information. He then<br />
asked some further questions about the membership of those<br />
committees and I answered that. But I gave no undertaking that<br />
my ministers, or I myself, in general, would answer such questions.<br />
The original undertaking I gave on 20 September has been followed<br />
by my ministers. It will continue to be followed by my ministers.<br />
They have quoted it; they follow it.<br />
QUESTION: What progress has been made in renegotiating the<br />
agreement on the U. S. communicationq base at North-West Cape?<br />
Can you say when Mr Barnard will be visiting Washington for talks<br />
on joint control of the base, and could you say whether members<br />
of Parliament have asked to see the bases in accordance with the<br />
terms laid down by Mr Barnard earlier this year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Mr Barnard will be going to the United States<br />
in the recess.<br />
QUESTION: If my memory serves me right, you told Mr Anthony<br />
that decisions relating to tariffs would be announced in the<br />
Parliament before they were announced to the Caucus.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, on a matter of substance. I told Mr Chipp that.<br />
QUESTION: But that was the gist of what you were saying?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, of course, in general.<br />
QUESTION: It was my understanding from a Caucus briefing that<br />
Caucus could ask to consider these matters before they went<br />
to the Parliament. And my understanding -is that you have before<br />
you the colour. television report of the Tariff Board and the IDC.<br />
Could you tell me what procedures will be followed at this stage?<br />
Will the Cabinet make the decision, then tell the Parliament,<br />
or will it go to Caucus first?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The former.<br />
QUESTION: Could you say why the Cabinet has not yet considered the<br />
question of four weeks' annual leave for employees other than<br />
Commonwealth employees in the Australian Capital Territory,<br />
particularly in view of the decision of the Queensland Industrial<br />
Commission that workers in that State should have four weeks' leave?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Cabinet has considered this matter and it<br />
believes, as appears from the Australian Labor Party platform,<br />
that this matter should be determined by arbitration, and, as you<br />
point out, it has since been determined by arbitration in<br />
Queensland. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
QUESTION: Have you had time to confer with Senator Willesee on<br />
the offer by 33 South Australian medical students to go to<br />
Ethiopia? PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
QUESTION: Do you know when you will-be able to confer with him?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I said I would have the matter looked into.<br />
I didn't undertake to confer with Senator Willesee directly.<br />
This was a question asked by Mr Hurford, the M. P. for Adelaide,<br />
yesterday afternoon. I'm certain it is being acted on already.<br />
I am certain that the department is investigating the matter<br />
already. I hadn't heard about it bqfore Mr Hurford asked his<br />
question without notice.<br />
QUESTION: Figures released in a Question on Notice answered by<br />
Mr Grassby today indicate that of 26,013 migrants who came to<br />
Australia on assisted passages for the first six months of<br />
this y~ ar, only 80 were from Asia. Given Mr Grassby's answer<br />
on no applications for migration from Japan, but in the context<br />
of the fact that there is great interest to migrate to Australia<br />
from Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines, do you agree<br />
with allegations that Australia's immigration policy still has<br />
a bias in favour of whites?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There is no official bias on racial grounds at<br />
all. There is an inevitably greater number-of Caucasians coming<br />
to Australia than people of other racial origins because the<br />
basis of the immigration program has been switched from official<br />
recruiting to family reunion.<br />
QUESTION: Do you give the Labor Party any chance of winning<br />
the New South Wales State elections and, if so, by how many<br />
seats? PRIME MINISTER: I'm not going to comment on that.<br />
QUESTION: I'm confused and a little bit disturbed by your answers<br />
on IDCs, and I would like to ask a very brief and blunt question.<br />
Why shouldn't your ministers tell Mr Snedden which interdepartmental<br />
committees their officers are members of. What is the difficulty?<br />
Is there such a vast number that it would take the Public Service<br />
months to work it out?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It is just the degree of time taken up, money<br />
spent in compiling answers to questions when there may, in fact,<br />
be no particular point that Mr Snedden wishes to establish. If<br />
he wants to name any committee he will be told what departments<br />
are on it and what its terms of reference are and what date it<br />
did report or is expected to report. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
QUESTION: Can't you agree with the point made by Mr Spigelman<br />
of your office that it is impossible to ask questions about<br />
committees when you don't know whether the committees exist or<br />
not? And it is surely reasonable in the interests of open<br />
government that people who are outside the Government should be<br />
entitled to know what interdepartmental committees exist?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No; primarily, we are concerned in what<br />
decisions Governments make and how they reach those decisions.<br />
If there is any departmental committee which the Government sets<br />
up, and somebody wants to know about that particular committee,<br />
he will be told. But it has never been suggested, and I don't<br />
propose to initiate, publishing all the interdepartmental<br />
committees which the Government may jestablish. I have pointed out<br />
in answers to questions by Mr Snedden that there are some matters<br />
of international or commercial relevance where it would be quite<br />
wrong to identify the existence of a committee or its membership.<br />
There have never been so many reports to Parliament by bodies<br />
advising the Government never.<br />
QUE STION: I understood that in the early weeks of your<br />
Government you did have inquiries made for a consolidated list<br />
of the interdepartmental committees. Have you ever been given<br />
that consolidated list?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I forget.<br />
QUESTION: What are we going on about? I mean there are all sorts-<br />
I don't understand, you see, all this curiosity about<br />
interdepartmental committees. Ever since we were boys here in<br />
Canberra there have been committees, interdepartmental, formal<br />
And informal, and all the rest of it. Surely what matters is<br />
what comes out in the end. What is the reason for being so<br />
testy about it I don't think it matters two hoots.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:. The important thing is that people ought to know<br />
what the Government decides and why it has decided it and that has<br />
been done to a degree that has never been done by any Australian<br />
Government before.<br />
QUESTION: When you were in Opposition did you find it frustrating<br />
that you were unable to get the information that you are now<br />
denying to Mr Snedden?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I would have been very pleased indeed to<br />
get all the information that I now give. </p>
