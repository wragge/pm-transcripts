PRIME MiNISTER;<br />
I don't have any comment He's a private citizen and I'm not going to make comments<br />
on what he does. That's his business and I'm not going to reflect on it in any way.<br />
JRNLST: ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We'll be looking at it very closely. I think the report has exploded all of those conspiracy<br />
theories that were swilling around&gt; We'll have a very close look at it We didn't<br />
appoint the man to ignore his views. Equally, I can't certify that every single<br />
recommendation is going to be adopted but it seems to have been quite well received and<br />
it's obviously got a lot of intelligent recomrnmendations. The Govemrnment will look at it<br />
very closely and quite speedily I would expect. 25/ 01/ 97 13: 31 Pg:<br />

PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Senotor \ has already dealt with the question of funding and I support what he said and<br />
don't have anything further to add. Thank you.<br />
JRNLST ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MJNISTER:<br />
Well it's a daft report and the Governmenct will take a decision when it gets the final<br />
report and I invite people who are concerned about the recommendations in the draft<br />
report to respond with their concerns. I have said in the past that I regard the retention of<br />
a strong motor vehicle industry as being very important in Australia and I understand the<br />
importance to the industrial base of South Australia of the motor vehicle industry bht I<br />
am not going to at this stage pre-empt how the Government may respond to a fnal ieport,<br />
particularly when we're stil in the draft report stage.<br />
Thank you </p>
