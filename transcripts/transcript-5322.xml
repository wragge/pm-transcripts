PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT THURSDAY, APRIL 10 1980<br />
PRESS CONFERE'ICE, CANBERRA<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I though it might be useful if I called this confer6V.-ir r-Ã± ation<br />
to the Office of National Assessments because there h4beKa good<br />
deal' of writing going on about the subject and a good deal of it<br />
as far as I am aware anyway, is not accurate. There are some things<br />
that are certainly inaccurate in relation to my own., views,. and in<br />
fact, do not coincide with what Ihave publicly; stated in the<br />
Parliament itself. It is worth recalling that the Office of National<br />
Assessments was established as a result of one of the main<br />
recommendations by Mr Justice Hope when he was looking at<br />
Australia's security organisations. It was out of that recommendation<br />
that the Office camne to be formed. Mr Justice Hope had drawn<br />
attention to the fact that the Government didn't have one body<br />
drawing together assessments from all the factual knowledge available<br />
to government. The Joint Intelligence Organisation which had done<br />
part of this work in the past was more narrowly based, more defence<br />
orientated, and in modern circumstance, governments need assessments<br />
on a much wider range of matters than ones that are purely defence<br />
related. There are economic matters, political matters and a whole range<br />
of subjects of importance to governments in the modern age where<br />
information available to government needs to be assessed in as<br />
impartial and objective atmosphere as is possible. That was the<br />
reasons for the establishment of the Office of National Assessments.<br />
I believe that the Office has undertaken that work well, and I also<br />
believe that the basis and the nature of the assessments that are<br />
available to government is much better, and much more broadly based,<br />
than those that did come from the Joint Intelligence Organisation.<br />
That in itself is not a criticism of JIO, because its charter was<br />
different, it was a different kind of organisation. But, I wanted to<br />
make the point that ONA came out of a recommendation by Mr Justice Hope,<br />
that was d&amp; e; igned to make sure that governmen'ts had available to them<br />
the best possible assessments on a range of strategic, political and<br />
economic matters that are important to governments when they come<br />
to decisions on a wide variety of subjects.<br />
So much for background. The role of ONA is important. It will continue<br />
to be important. I think it has filled its task well, and the quality<br />
of its assessments have been good. We all know there are problems<br />
at the present time, but I have got confidence in the way the<br />
Director General is handling those particular problems. It was he<br />
called in ASIO to examine certain matters. There will be a report.<br />
The Director General, I have no doubt, will act upon that report<br />
as-* he thinks fit. I do know he is concerned to get to the truth of<br />
the matter, and that any decisions need taking as a result of it,<br />
well then they will be taken.<br />
But, I went over to the Office of National Assessments this afternoon<br />
to tell the numbers of the office very much what I have told you<br />
that I have confidence in what they are doing, it has been important<br />
to government, and that the work is necessary and must continue, and<br />
that I have confidence in the way the work has, been undertaken. I do<br />
not believe that there has been or I am certainly not conscious of<br />
major attempts by people in Foreign Affairs, for example, to get at<br />
the Office of National Assessments. </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime Minister: ( Cont<br />
One of the factors that that has been related to in the writings<br />
is what has happened to Afghanistan and the possibility of different<br />
assessments in relation to that. But, people in the Department of<br />
Foreign Affairs have seen detente very much go out the window<br />
with the Russian invasion of. Afghanistan. The advice coming to us<br />
overall, has been pretty rugged and pretty determined in relation<br />
to what Australia might do.<br />
People, and I have said this in the Parliament, might vary on the<br />
Soviet's reasons for going into Afghanistan, but there is certainly<br />
no difference between the government and the government's advisors<br />
on the dangers and the consequences that flow out of that invasion<br />
and-occupation of Afghanistan. Whatever their motives for going there,<br />
as I said in that first statement, the consequences are more important<br />
than motives for the first or actual move,-because it is agreed that<br />
if new opportunities are likely to unfold, they will take advantage<br />
of it. If opportunities don't unfold, they are also prone to create<br />
themn. But, in a sense, for today, that is by the way.<br />
What I did want to say, is that I have confidence in Bo. Furlonger<br />
as Director -General, I have conf idence in the of fice., Tey:-have served<br />
the Government well -There are difficulties at the present time. I<br />
am confident of Mr Furlonger's capacity to overcome those difficulties,<br />
He has the authority to do so, and I know he has the determination to<br />
do so.<br />
Question: Prime Minister, have you made that declaration because you fear that<br />
stoiies over the past week have damaged ONA?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It is not a question of fear. Quite obviously the sort of stories<br />
that have occurred are damaging, and there is a likelihood that there<br />
will be more stories. There will be stories over the weekend I would<br />
imagine, and Michelle, you won't mind me saying it, but the story in<br />
the middle of the Age today was one whidh made me think that perhaps.<br />
I ought to move as I have done to speak to people in the office<br />
itself and to have this press conference, because within my<br />
knowledge, much of that story is just not accurate. And I am not<br />
picking up the Age but it just happened to be on the front page<br />
and it happened to be written today. I think it is very hard for<br />
people who basically don't speak to the media, they are not able<br />
to get on their own feet and defend themselves, that the Prime Minister<br />
might be after elements in the office about this or about that. They<br />
wonder what the truth is. They wonder then, perhaps, whether the<br />
Government does hold the office in high regard, or whether it doesn't,<br />
and they wonder whether we feel that they have in fact been fulfilling<br />
a role as the Government originally determined as a result of<br />
Mr Justice Hope's report.<br />
So, that is the reason I went over to the Office of National<br />
Assessments. It is also the reason why I am holding this press<br />
conference. Question: What do you actually see as the difficulties. in the office at the </p>
<p>-3<br />
Question: ( cnt.)<br />
moment, and I would ask you to be specific on that because you are<br />
saying what you want to avoid is inaccurate speculation about the<br />
office....<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
The difficulties I think are largely internal to the office.<br />
Mr Furlonger might like to comment about that, but the things that<br />
I think can be very damaging and make life very difficult and<br />
painf ul f or members in. the of fice is when they read things about my<br />
attitudes, my motives, things that I am alleged to have said or<br />
other Ministers might have said about the worth of the office<br />
and this sort of thing. That I think is something which has been<br />
written. It looked as if it was going to go on being written because<br />
of some questions that had been put into my office this morning, so<br />
I thought I ought to try and stop it.<br />
As far as I am concerned, it is just not true.<br />
Question: How do you view, then, the loss of whatever it is, lost, of a<br />
top secret document, a highly confidential document?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Obviously Mr Furlonger regards that as serious or he would not have<br />
called in ASIO and advised me after he had called in ASIO. I state<br />
that in that order to show that the Director General hims~ lf regarded<br />
it as a very serious matter and acted upon it, and advised me of what<br />
he had done. I also, obviously, regard it as a serious matter, but<br />
I have also said that I am confident in the way the Director General<br />
is handling the matter.<br />
Question: Justice Hope, six months ago, publicly warned the Government in a<br />
report to Parliament that there was a lack of security within<br />
Government Departments. HE-didn't name them, he specifically spelled<br />
out the security of handling documents. Six months later we find<br />
out that a top security document has disappeared. Surely you must<br />
be more than concerned?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I have already said that I regard it as serious. The Director General<br />
regards it as-serious -He called in ASIO as a result.<br />
Question: You said the problems in ONA are mainly internal. How does the loss<br />
of a classified secret document an internal problem?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It happened within matters Bob, you might like to answer that, but<br />
it seemed to me that it occurred out of events within the organisation<br />
itself. I think it also plain that there have been one or two....<br />
Question: . you could say that about the inaudible., case, couldn't you? </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, you could say it about one or two personality problems within<br />
the office and I think that is what I was referring to. Obviously<br />
the loss of a document of that kind is one I have already said ' I<br />
regarded as serious, and it must be a concern to the government as such<br />
But it is also important to know whether or not I have confidence in<br />
the way the matter, up to this point is being handled.<br />
Question: Do you think the document was lost, or do you think this was the<br />
act of some internal saboteur?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I am not going to try and pre-empt what ASTO might have in its<br />
report. Question: Does the personal expression of confidence that you gave to the<br />
ONA this afternoon extend to each individual member of the office?<br />
Prime Minis ter:<br />
It extended to the organisation as such, and the work that the<br />
organisation and its members as such, as a collective body of people,<br />
have been undertaking.<br />
Question: Do you believe that the two ONA officers who provided information,<br />
to the Labor Party were acting in a disloyal fashion? Can you tell<br />
us, what'if any, action has been taken against those officers<br />
and can you tell me whether you are happy with the action that has<br />
been taken or the lack of action if no action has been taken?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think if you read my statement in the Parliament on that you would<br />
have an answer to most of those questions, because I made it<br />
perfectly plain in that statement in the Parliament, the nature of<br />
the advice that they had passed on to an officer * of the library which<br />
would seem to be not consistent with the basis of other things that<br />
are written in other places, or for that matter, would seem to be<br />
not consistent with the sort of speeches that came out of the<br />
Opposition, and the nature of the advice that was given by those<br />
two officers to the officer of the library, was written down in<br />
their own terms and signed by them. So they made it perfectly plain<br />
what they had said. Any question of disciplinary matters is a matter<br />
for the Director General, but I did say in that statement, that I<br />
regarded the fact that when they were challenged about what they<br />
had done, they made it perfectly plain, there was no attempt to hide<br />
it, and made a full statement of what had occurred, why, the<br />
motivation, and of what they had said, as a mitigating circumstance.<br />
Any question of any other action is for the Director General.<br />
Question: Can you tell us what action has been taken by the Director General? </p>
<p>Prime Minister:<br />
Disciplinary matters are matters for the people in charge of the<br />
officers concerned, and I would prefer that Mr Furlonger answer that<br />
question if he wants to.<br />
Mr Furlonger:<br />
Prime Minister, I would say that I have taken certain additional<br />
action, but I don't think I am prepared to say publicly what that<br />
action is.<br />
Question: Could you say how much progress has been made in trying to relocate<br />
the document?<br />
Mr Furlonger:<br />
No, I can't at this stage comment on the ASIG investigation. I think<br />
it will take another week possibly. I am not sure yet just how long<br />
will take. But I do want to make it clear, as the Prime Minister ha~ s<br />
said, it was my initiative that caused ASIO to come in, and my only<br />
objective is to get at the truth, and when we know what the truth<br />
is, then I Will consider what further action, if any, needs to be<br />
taken. Question: Do you deny, categorically, the reports that there is a faction<br />
fight Wi thin ONA, that you are under seige from various other<br />
intelligence organisations and that the reports we have read<br />
are that ONA is divided into various factions w~ hich are trying<br />
to knock each other ofcf?<br />
Mr Furlonger:<br />
I think that if you look at the statement made by all the ONA<br />
staff the other day, which was a united statement, made in support<br />
of me and in support of the organisation, and in support of ONA,<br />
and in which they denied that there were any factions, I think that<br />
that answers that question.<br />
In so far as other intelligence bodies are concerned, it is not true<br />
that there is tension existing between ASIO and JIO and the other<br />
bodies. We have very good co-operation with all the other intelligence<br />
agencies,-and I expect that to continue.<br />
Question: Mr * Furlonger, what was the time period between you'calling ASIO<br />
and when you believe the document went missing?<br />
Mr Furlonger:<br />
No, I am not prepared to comment on the matters that will be covered<br />
in the ASIO report.<br />
Question: Are you willing to tell us when you see the report, whether you<br />
will let us know, the Prime Minister let us know, in broad outline ./ 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
Question: the conclusions..<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I don't think we can pre-empt the result of the report. It might<br />
recommend aftion it might not. I think we have got to get that report<br />
and then make a judgement about it<br />
Question: But can you tell us when you get it, can you give us an outline<br />
when it is completed and when you get it?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
T hat -is asking me to make a judgement before I know what is<br />
likely to be in the report. I would sooner get that particular report<br />
and then see-how it would be best handled.<br />
Question: Except that you are giving a very fulsome expression of confidence<br />
in general in ONA today, can you tell us in a week or whenever this<br />
report is ready, whether you still feel that that is justified?<br />
Prime Minister::<br />
Let's see what happens then. Noone has suggested that there aren't<br />
some problems. There obviously are. And I haven't suggested that there<br />
aren't some problems. What I have had confidence in and do, is the<br />
nature oJf: the work that ONA has done, the kind of assessments that<br />
they have provided to government ' s on a wide range of matters and<br />
as I believe, of high quality. That doesn't mean to say the government<br />
agrees with all parts of it. You get assessments, you get advice.<br />
Governments have to make their own decisions. But that is the nature<br />
of it. In relation to the current problems, I have confidence in<br />
what the-Director General has done to this point in handling those<br />
particular matters, and I support him in doing' that. He didn't ask<br />
that he should do this or that, he has taken his own action in<br />
relation to it within his own responsibility. And I support that.<br />
I think it is important, therefore, to have clearly in mind, what<br />
we are talking about and what has been said, because there are<br />
problems. The extent of action, if any that will need to be taken,<br />
will depend significantly upon that report that comes from ASIO.<br />
But, I do remember the time when governments did not have the kind<br />
of cons -erted assessment machinery that is now provided by ONA, and<br />
the advice that then came to governments was much inferior in some<br />
cases it was entirely absent.<br />
There is one other way that the Office of National Assessment<br />
works which I think we might have forgotten. In relation to economic<br />
matters, there is an economics assessment board which has representative!<br />
of Treasury and other people on it, and while the Director General<br />
has final authority for the assessment that comes forward, I am not<br />
aware of clashes, between the various assessments board on economic<br />
matters or the general assessments board, the national assessments<br />
board which includes officers from Foreign Affairs and JIO.-/ 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
Prime Minister: ( Cont.)<br />
So, in the assessing machinery itself, it is not ONA standing apart,<br />
the machinery draws in the operative departments or instrumentalities,<br />
in areas where their advice and expertise is necessary. I think that<br />
is something which has been a little forgotten in discussing ONA,<br />
maybe something secluded in a part, in fact, it is not.<br />
Question: inaudible... problems usually exist within ONA?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
There is the problem of lost document to start with.<br />
Question: You said problems. What are the other problems?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think it is very plain that there have been some problems<br />
involving people.<br />
Question: Would these include disloyal elements?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Look, you are using those sorts of words. I am not going to use<br />
that sort of word.<br />
Question: With the ASIG investigation, is it empowered merely to track down<br />
this document or examine material handling procedures within ONA,<br />
or is it also empowered to examine the source of some of these<br />
stories that are * appearing in the media and wi~ ich you say are<br />
inaccurate? Prime Minister:<br />
Mr Furlonger commissioned the inquiry, so perhaps he had better<br />
answer that.<br />
Mr Furlonger:<br />
I have asked ASIO to first of all, look into all the circumstances<br />
surrounding the missing document, and that could well lead them to<br />
a fairly wide f ield. I have also asked them to review our security<br />
procedures, and I made it plain to them that I don't interpret their<br />
investigation in a narrow, legalistic kind of sense. I want a full<br />
inquiry that will get to the bottom of all the circumstances that<br />
relate both to the missing document and to our own security proceedings<br />
Question: would you say that in that case, in the future, officers of ONA will<br />
not be allowed to answer inquiries from politicians other than / 8 </p>
<p>-8<br />
Question: ( cont.)<br />
responsible ministers, or that they will not any longer be allowed<br />
to answer inquiries from the Parliamentary library or similar<br />
organisations? Prime Minister:<br />
The library has its own rule, and it makes its own, that it is meant<br />
to get advice from sources where the advice is publishable. That is<br />
a library, and if you want to question that rule you should go to the<br />
library...<br />
Question: whether the ONA'advice-* is publishable in a sense.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Basically, their assessments are not publishable.<br />
There are specific ways in relation to the opposition for example,<br />
or for that matter, other members of Parliament if they are going to<br />
get access to the assessments, but for the leader of the opposition,<br />
the deputy leader of the opposition if they ask for a briefing on<br />
various matters, I'would have thought it would be given. I don't<br />
know of an occasion when briefing has been refused, but in fact,<br />
most of the briefings have come when the facilities have been of fered. 1<br />
There seems to be an incapacity in the opposition to ask.<br />
Question: use the results of that briefing in Parliamentary speeches in the<br />
same way as they would be allowed to use the results of the<br />
Parliamentary research service.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Obviously, a lot of the work that ONA does and the briefings if they<br />
are to be as full as possible, depend upon c)~ assified material, which<br />
is not publishable.<br />
Question: Do the internal problems that you referred to earlier include any<br />
expressions of concern or any complaints at all from any country<br />
outside Australia...<br />
, Prime Minister:<br />
No. None that have reached me at all.<br />
Question: Two questions -you said in the Parliament that these people only<br />
provided unclassified material to the library. That means that it is<br />
publishable, doesn't it, if it is unclassified?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
well,, it if is unclassified.. / 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
Question: If it is unclassified, would it be publishable?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Unclassified would be publishable, if ihat it all that it is.<br />
Question: I am quoting you there, so what they gave the library...<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I hope you are quoting me accurately.<br />
Question: you used the word unclassified in Parliament, you defended these<br />
people. You said presumably what they gave to the library was<br />
publishable. Prime Minister:<br />
No, I think that you are doing it the wrong way around, because,<br />
basically, the kind of judgement that anyone working closely in<br />
ONA has access to classified information. It is not a question of I<br />
the leader of the opposition having access to briefings. He has<br />
got access.<br />
Question: I am not thinking of the leader of the opposition, I am thinking of<br />
the Parliamentary library.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It is their own rule about publishable material so if you want. to<br />
question that then you go to them for it.<br />
Question:* My second question is going to be did you have any role in the<br />
bouncing of Jim Dunn?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, none. You probably knew about it before I did.<br />
Question: You have already made a public statement about the transfer of<br />
Mr Andrew CarphVell from ONA. Why will you not publicly define the actions<br />
being taken against him unnamed inaudible?<br />
Mr Furlonger:<br />
I think I prefer not to comment.<br />
Question: I think it is a curious situation because we are told-that some action </p>
<p>10<br />
Question: ( cant.)<br />
against them, the Prime Minister has made a statement to Parliament<br />
about it, yet we are not informed what sort of action has in fact<br />
been taken. I mean, I would have thought this was a fairly serious<br />
issue. Have these people been disciplined or haven't they?<br />
If they have been disciplined, what has happened to them?<br />
Mr Furlonger:<br />
Well, they have been disciplined but it is an internal public service<br />
matter, and<br />
Question: So was Andrew Campbell. and yet you made a public statement which some<br />
people thought was libellous. So what is the difference?<br />
Mr Furlonger:<br />
I think I would prefer not to talk about Andrew Campbell at this point<br />
in time.<br />
Question: Can you tell us why you differentiate between the two cases?<br />
It seems quite illogical to me, and I think to everyone else<br />
here to Condemn one man and explain what has happened about him,<br />
yet you won't do the same in the case if this fellow.<br />
Mr Furlonger:<br />
Well, you used the word libellous, and that is one reason for-not<br />
talking about Andrew Campbell.<br />
Question:<br />
But the other two are unnamed so that doesn't figure in the<br />
consideration there, surely.--<br />
Mr Furlonger:<br />
I think I would prefer to leave this question of the other two.<br />
Let's see what comes out of the ASIO report. We-will look at the<br />
totality then, and what further action may or may not need to be<br />
taken. Question: Is there a link between this missing document and the two people?<br />
Mr Furlonger:<br />
I am not suggesting Anything.<br />
Question: Obviously you are btinging us into the position where on the one.<br />
hand this press conference is called because of ambiguities and<br />
misunderstandings and inaudible misrecording because we are not<br />
given all the information on all the folk. Now, with respect to<br />
both of you, and if we are on a question such as this, given factual </p>
<p>11<br />
Question: ( cant.)<br />
answers, it is going to continue and it is your fault.<br />
Mr Furlonger:<br />
Well, we can't give you all the facts until ASIO's report is complete.<br />
Question: but what we have done to these two , urely, you must know<br />
that, Mr. Furlonger?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Normally if there is a disciplinary matter for an officer in charge<br />
of an instrumentality, and members of the staff, members of the<br />
public service, that is a matter for the public service. If the<br />
officers themselves wish to appeal against any disciplinary matter<br />
there are provisions to appeal in the public service it is not<br />
normal for public statements to be made about this.<br />
Question: There was one though made about Andrew Campbell.<br />
Official: Thanks very much.<br />
Question: Can we askyowl. et4-her you are going to Salisbury, Prime Minister.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Yes. Question: You are going?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Yes. Question: Do you care to say more about that before we leave?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I will be leaving next Tuesday and will back on Saturday or Sunday<br />
week. Question: Are you going anywhere else?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No./ 12 </p>
<p>12<br />
Question: How long will you be in Salisbury?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Two nights.<br />
Question: I will just ask one more question on ONA. There have been quite<br />
a few stories about how this so called Belgrade document which is<br />
supposed to refer to a group of people operating inside ONA. I was<br />
wondering whether you are aware of such a document?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No. </p>
