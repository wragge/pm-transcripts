PIMEMNSE Wednesday April4_ 4 1982<br />
from the Press Office SUMMARY OF NEWSVOICE<br />
The strong surplus in the balance of payments last month<br />
was due to a big increase in the amount borrowed from overseas.<br />
Report.<br />
There has beena a further slump in Australia's home building<br />
industry. Figuares out today show another fall in lending to<br />
home owners by savings and trading banks. Report.<br />
The ANZ Bank today announced it would increase its interest<br />
for large borrowers from this Friday. It said its rate on<br />
advances over $ 100,000 would rise by 1% a year to 17.25%.<br />
The ANZ said the increase had become necessary to offset<br />
inpart recent sharp rises in the cost of deposits.<br />
The US Secretary of State has postponed a second trip to<br />
Buenos Aires to report to President Reagan on the progress<br />
of discussion to resolve the Falklands crisis. After his<br />
return, Mr Haig had little to say except that both countries<br />
were considering new ideas. In a letter to the UN Security<br />
Council, Argentina says it will comply with the council's<br />
demand for the withdrawal of its troops from the Falkland<br />
Islands if Britain recalls its naval task force. It says<br />
Britain would also have to recall what it called attempts<br />
to return the previous colonial situation on the island.<br />
Britain replied that Argentina's failure to comply with the.<br />
UN order to withdraw from the Falklands had made it necessary<br />
for Britain to take self defensive measures. In the meantime,<br />
preparations for a military conflict are going ahead.<br />
The Prime Minister said today there was no question of<br />
Australia being directly involved in the Falkland Island<br />
conflict. Mr Fraser was speaking on the ABE's national Morning<br />
Extra prograrrme. Report. During the hour long phone in programme,<br />
Mr Fraser answered questions from listeners around. Australia<br />
on topics ranging from the price of farm fuel to the standards<br />
of Australian. speech. A number of questions concentrated on<br />
Australia's defence capabilities. On the Falklands crisis,<br />
Mr Fraser said Australia was not bound by decisions made<br />
by the United. Kingdom.<br />
Prime MinistEr:<br />
I am sure thEat the United Kingd. om would not be expecting Australia<br />
to join them in battle in this particular conflict if it<br />
develops that way. Whatever support we can provide them, morally,<br />
and through some trade sanctions and through some financial<br />
sanctions, anid these things have already been announced, of<br />
course we will do. But it is not the kind of circumstances<br />
in which I would expect to see Australians involved, directly.<br />
A Darwin listener, Mr Mason, told the Prime Minisbr of his<br />
concern at the level of defence preparedness of the Northern<br />
Territory. Mr Mason:<br />
We liken Darwin and the Northern Territory to be very, very similar </p>
<p>N ewsvoice14.4.82<br />
Mr Mason: ( cont.)<br />
to the Falkland Islands, with our lack of defence up here<br />
in the Territory.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I don't think so.<br />
Mr Mason:<br />
We people up here do think so.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, if I could make a comment or two about that. The Falkland<br />
Islands are a very long way, about eight or nine thousand<br />
miles from the United Kingdom. They are remote from the main<br />
centres of British power and influence. Now, the Northern<br />
Territory is all part of one island continent, and the Australian<br />
defence effort is based to make sure that we secure the<br />
protection of Australia against any possible threats. I can<br />
understand that there can be a feeling of isolation but really<br />
in military terms, the situations are not the same, they really<br />
aren' t.<br />
The NSW Supreme Court has begun hearing a challenge against<br />
a State government Minister's refusal to allow a State ward<br />
to have an abortion. The decision by the Youth and Community<br />
Service Minister has led to heated arguments inside the cabinet.<br />
Tasmania' s Director of Road Safety has attacked what he calls<br />
the often ridiculous publicity given to the Easter road tolls.<br />
Report. An American expert on new antibiotics today warned Australian<br />
doctors not to0 consider their costs when lives are threatened.<br />
Caltex has deferred some $ 20 million in investment in NSW<br />
because of the State's petrol pricing controls.<br />
Queensland's cabinet ministers will be among those hard hit<br />
by a campaign of bans and limitations imposed by government<br />
blue collars in support of a 35 hour week. At a mass meeting<br />
in Brisbane this morning, over 1,000 menand women from a dozen<br />
different uni~ ons overwhelmingly rejected the government's final<br />
offer of a 38 hour week. Services like air conditioning and<br />
plumbing willi be affected.<br />
Two officials from the BLF in South Australia today refused<br />
to answer questions at the Royal Commission into the union<br />
in Melbourne.. The South Australian Secretary of the union, Mr Owens<br />
and an organiser, Mr Porter, read a prepared statement to the<br />
commission and then remained silent during questioning.<br />
