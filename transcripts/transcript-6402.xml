PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT IKE WALSH SHOW -4 JUNE 1983<br />
E E&amp; O0EPROOF ONLY<br />
* WALSH: I'd like to start off with an example, if I could,<br />
before we get on to the overall view of this thing. And it's<br />
one that I just picked out because it would seem, and we've asked<br />
a lot of people in the last couple of days, what they thought<br />
about it. It would seem that most of the public are quite happy<br />
with what's happened. But there's just one I'd like you-to<br />
explain to people. A married couple can have a house that's worth<br />
anything. It could be worth-any amount of money.<br />
That's right.<br />
* WALSH: Right, the house is not counted. Now they're allowe~ d<br />
-tohave in the bank a~ s a married couple $ 100,000.<br />
That's $ 100,000 of any sort of assets at all and they<br />
keep getting the full pension.<br />
* WALSH: That's a car, paintings in the house.<br />
Yes.<br />
WALSH: Alrighit, O. K. Now if one of two died, or when one of the<br />
two dies, the single person allowance to $ 70,0.00 what would<br />
happen to someone in that situation. Like the husband dies, they've!<br />
had $ 100,000 worth of assets, they're now only allowed to have<br />
$ 70,000 to get the full pension.<br />
Well there's a provision that was put'up by the Gruen<br />
panel which allows a period of changeover so that there has been<br />
no intent at all, Michael, of allowing that factor, the death of<br />
the spouse, to cause any hardship. So there's that period of<br />
takeover of the new situation. The second thing, Mike, is -there<br />
is a hardship provision in the arrangements that will be brought<br />
in in the legislation so that we're not in any way going to<br />
allow the fact of sudden death. to cause any problem. But what<br />
you should appreciate, Mike, is that under the provisions that<br />
if we look at the case where the two are alive with the home<br />
and $ 100,000 of assets it's full pension. It wouldn't be until<br />
you got up to a figure of $ 175,000 of assets that the pension<br />
would cut out altogether.<br />
WALSH: Right, it's only scaled down. </p>
<p>Yes, and it's people between $ 100,000 and $ 175,000 of<br />
assets that's gradually scaled down from a-full pension of<br />
$ 100,000 of assets plus home to $ 175,000. The statistic I'd<br />
like to put in Mike which I think will reassure all your viewers,<br />
and as you rightly say, I think it is very widely accepted now<br />
is that of all pensioners who[. exist in the cateagoriesthat<br />
are going to be covered by the assets test, only 2% or 45,000,<br />
45,000 right throughout Australia or 2%, will be affected. And<br />
that gives you an indication I think of the reasonableness with<br />
which the Government is approaching this issue. There is a problem<br />
which I think-is understood by virtually everyone in Australia<br />
except Mr Peacock that very wealthy asset rich people like<br />
yourself or myself or John Laws that I was talking to this morning,<br />
it's silly that we should be paid a pension. And we think that<br />
if we can look at this very top level of asset rich people,. it<br />
does give this and succeeding governments, Mike, the capacity.-.<br />
and through time a larger capacity, to have more available t~ o<br />
help those pensioners who really are in need of assistance.<br />
And that's an equitable, decent thing for this Australian society.<br />
WALSH: Yes I agree. There's been a-tendency to*. think that a'.<br />
pension is a God-given right and I guess I'm talking of old age<br />
pensions especially. But in fairness if you've got the dough<br />
you shouldn't be expecting the country to carry-the burden.<br />
Because the huge problem, as I see it and this must be a difficult<br />
one for a politician to win and still maintain your popularity,<br />
is that fact that a) the country is greying, b) that the pensions<br />
cost an awful lot of money and c) that the money has to come<br />
-from somewhere. Well.<br />
WALSH: So we have to be a bit realistic about it.<br />
You've put your finger and the interesting thing,.<br />
Michael, is that not only do we realize that, but large numbers<br />
of influential people within the Liberal Party who are honest<br />
about this, say the same thing. I mean, you were just talking<br />
about the football, let me just point out to you that when I<br />
sat down at lunch at the football on Sunday at my table was<br />
Mr. John Elliott, a leading figure in the Liberal Party in<br />
Victoria said by some to be the man who is going to come in<br />
to take over from Andrew after the next election and when I<br />
went and sat down at the table.<br />
WALSH: Bob, you can't resist having a shot. Well done.<br />
Well, he just lent across the table and said congratulations.<br />
I said on what. He said on the assets test. He said you are<br />
right. He said, I will write you a letter to that effect. But<br />
also, Mike, can I just read to your vast viewing audience what<br />
the Liberals said in opposition.<br />
First Senator Chaney. Senator Chaney was then their Minister<br />
for Social Security In October 81 this is what he had to say.<br />
It is a very brief quote, Mike. I'm quoting: </p>
<p>" I think we cannot escape the fact that there are some<br />
genuinely needy pensioners in this country who do not<br />
receive enough help, while some other people by the<br />
advantageous arrangement of their assets, are able to<br />
draw on the system to a greater extent than their real<br />
degree of need would seem to justify."<br />
And that is exactly what we are doing.<br />
Mr. Howard has exactly the same view and he expressed it in<br />
November of last year when he said he didn't agree with our<br />
particular form of assets test, that we were proposing then.<br />
And he was right. We agree that we have got a better position<br />
now. So, they understand that it is right and what Professor Gruen<br />
has said on behalf of the Panel the other day was right when<br />
he was talking about the Liberals. And this was after saying<br />
that the Government hadn't handled it right in the first place<br />
and I conceded in the Parliament we didn't get it right first:<br />
up, but we got it right now. But this is what Professor<br />
Gruen said of Mr. Peacock and those that were making these<br />
noises now. He said that they " deserve to be regarded as<br />
supremely opportunistic cynics". In other words, they know<br />
that what we are doing is right, but they are trying now to<br />
frighten people on a basis which is totally unfair because,<br />
I think as you recognise, and I know virtually all of your<br />
viewers would recognise, if we can get something like 2% of<br />
existing pensioners, who by any reasonable test, Mike, don't<br />
need the public benefit And that gives to governments and to<br />
our Government the opportunity to do more for pensioners who<br />
are in need, that is what ordinary decent Australians want to<br />
happen and it is what going to happen.<br />
WALSH: Yes, but the interesting one for me is that Gruen's<br />
recommendation would have saved the Government about $ 300<br />
million a year.<br />
No, no.<br />
WALSH: As I understand it, well, do you want to correct that:?<br />
No, MIchael, let me get that right. -The first test<br />
that we were talking about would have raised that sort of moneyan<br />
enormous amount of money.<br />
WALSH: That is the one you ditched.<br />
Yes, we ditched that one.<br />
WALSH: John Short in Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald estimates<br />
about $ 60 million will be saved by your current situation.<br />
In the very first year when we implement it it will not<br />
save us some money, it will cost us a little bit, because that<br />
is the cost of setting it up. But once you have done that, in<br />
the first full year it should save at least $ 45 million, Mike,<br />
and perhaps a bit more as we go on. / 4 </p>
<p>WALSH: Yes, but when you were doing your house-keeping,<br />
did you at the time think we need that $ 300 r~ illion and now<br />
you have only got 45 million. I'm just scared to where the<br />
hell you are going to get the rest.<br />
No, no, no. We were looking at this last year. We<br />
were looking at other things in the tax avoidance area and<br />
our attempts to get something like $ 260 million there were<br />
frustrated by-the Liberals who allowed the tax avoiders to<br />
get away with that amount of money by knocking over our<br />
legislation. In this area, Michael, we have demonstrated that<br />
we are not going to push further into this area because we are<br />
going to index the amount. In other words, those figures that<br />
I have given you for the married couple, their home, plus<br />
$ 100,000. We won't just leave it at 100,000 and let inflation<br />
whittle it away we'll provide that that be indexed each 12<br />
months, so that will go up. Could I just make the point,<br />
Mike, that could be of interest to some of your viewers too<br />
the case of those pensioners who haven't got their own home<br />
and say perhaps are living with their relatives or in nursing<br />
homes, we have added another 50,000 so the married couple who<br />
are living with their relatives, their kids, or in a nursingT<br />
home, could have assets up to 225,000 before they lost their_<br />
pension or they could have 150,000 in assets and still get the<br />
full pension.<br />
WALSH: Right, that is a good one to point out. Now, there is<br />
just one thing on thlat, though. You are now worried about the<br />
loss of revenue, in other words.<br />
Well, let me make this point to your viewers, Michael.<br />
When you are talking about taxation, I as Prime Minister and<br />
my Government, we don't want tax so that we can point and say<br />
look at all that tax we have got. What taxation is about is<br />
very simply this that the community, members of the community,<br />
whether they be individuals or businesses, realize that the~ y<br />
have to pay tax because there are things that individuals and<br />
companies and farmers want governments to do for them. They<br />
want us to defend the country, they want us to build roads and<br />
bridges and schools and hospitals. So what taxation is about<br />
is not just for the government to get money. The real thing<br />
that we have got to try and do and what I am certainly committed<br />
to is to try through the consultation process, Mike, with the<br />
community to see what is the fairest way of raising those -taxes<br />
to do the things that people need and want to be done. So<br />
that is what we are about. With this particular area we<br />
obviously I'm committed and all my public career has been<br />
committed to trying to look after the elderly and those who<br />
need help. It is really about the top we think, that we<br />
don't need to pay them pensions and in that way we can help<br />
those in the community who need help and it gives us income<br />
to do other things. Now, as far as other taxes are concerned,<br />
Mike, what this Government will be doing will be sitting down<br />
with community organisations, welfare organisations, the business<br />
community and also with the trade union movement everyorne who<br />
has got a right to be involved in this and say, now, let's </p>
<p>together work out the fairest way of raising those taxes<br />
which are going to enable us to do the things you want.<br />
Now, in this next Budget, for instance, Mike, we will be<br />
cutting taxes you know personal direct taxes, because<br />
there is a need to do that and then as we go through into<br />
next year and the year after we will talk with the whole<br />
community and say, now, we know these things you want<br />
government to do what is the fairest way of raising taxes.<br />
Now one suggdstion that is made, for instance, is perhaps a<br />
broader tax on retail goods. Now, I don't know whether<br />
that is a thing that the community would like to see done rather<br />
than others. But I think what we have demonst ' rated, Michael,<br />
in just over 12 months in office is that we are not going to<br />
impose something on the Australian community. We are going to<br />
talk with them and their representatives to see that we get<br />
the fairest decision and I hope that people will give us<br />
marks for when we look at something in the first instance as<br />
we did with the first assets test. We got that wrong. I<br />
say that quite openly to the people of Australia. The thing<br />
that we worked out then wasn't the best and I came to realise<br />
that it wasn't and that is why I said, let's stop that. Let's<br />
have a community consultation and try and get it right.<br />
WALSH: Well that is an interesting approach and a new one in<br />
this country and I wish you good luck with it because it<br />
seems to be working so far.<br />
P. M. Thanks Mike. J1<br />
WALSH:. Something I wou~ id like to ask you while I have you<br />
here, Mr. Hawke, Bob. Is this thing we are going through in<br />
NSW where Medicare is getting a pretty heavy bashing from the<br />
medical profession and we have seen mass resignations of<br />
orthopaedic surgeons and plastic surgeons. What is your<br />
feeling on the whole thing? It looks as though they are<br />
brick walling pretty well.<br />
Well, let me make a couple of points, Michael. First<br />
of all this particular issue now is confined to NSW. I will<br />
be talking to Dr. Blewett, the Minister, to see if there is<br />
anything at this stage that we can do to help in the resolution<br />
of this problem. But I would like to say this -1tat Medicare<br />
is working remarkably well. Some interesting statistics I<br />
just looked at on the weekend 96% of all Australians are now<br />
registered which is remarkable when you think it has only been<br />
going such a short time. About 48% of all claims are now<br />
being direct bulk billed by doctors which is a higher<br />
proportion than we thought and so I can really say to the<br />
people of Australia through your program that it is being~<br />
implemented more smoothly and effectively in a shorter period<br />
of time than we hoped. </p>
<p>WALSH: But this is a pretty big hiccup, isn't it, having<br />
these people resign?<br />
Well, it is and let me say I don't want to go in<br />
for doctor bashing. A lot of them around Australia were taking<br />
some direct industrial action there earlier this year. I sat<br />
down and talked with them with Dr. Blewett and I think we have<br />
really got that general problem about section 17 sorted out.<br />
I hope that this particular problem in NSW will also lend itself to<br />
resolution. I am quite clear from everything that has come back<br />
to me that the great majority of Australians welcome the<br />
situation which is now emerging where we have got universality<br />
of coverage, Mike. There are not going to be any Australians<br />
now, as there were before something like 2 million of them<br />
who weren't covered for illness and hospital coverage. We have<br />
got universality and we have got a system which is more related<br />
to peoples' needs. It is going to work. It is already working<br />
very well, but these sorts of problems that you refer to, they<br />
need some talking to. We will get there.<br />
WALSH: OK, well thanks for joining us today and good luck<br />
with the whole thing, especially the assets test. It does<br />
look as though it has settled down. And in fact for people<br />
in ths country it is a bit strange to get used to this sort of<br />
consensus style of government, but as long as you stick to it,<br />
I'm sure we all wish you great success.<br />
-Thanks M1ikejt </p>
