TRANSCRIPT OF UM3ITND INTERtVIEPW WITH ALAN HOG", 7.30<br />
RNEOTr GIADSTONE, 16 FURY 1990g<br />
R &amp; O0E-PROOF ONLY<br />
HOGAN: Prime minister, as we head into this election<br />
campaign, do you detect that many Australians are<br />
disillusioned with politics and politicians, including your<br />
own Party?<br />
PM: There is an element of ( i] Rilluiofl. T think Alan, what<br />
I was saying earlier today that we have got to recognize<br />
that not only in this vountry but around the world, the<br />
environment, and I'm not saying that is the only issue, but<br />
the environment has taken up a sector of politics which<br />
wasn't occupied before. It's become a predominant concern<br />
of many people, and understandably so in my judgement.<br />
That's not the total explanation.<br />
HOGAN: Do you suggest that because people are worried about<br />
the environment they are disillusioned with politicians?<br />
PM: No, I'm saying that they are putting a different test,<br />
if you like, upon politicians I think. of the electorate<br />
is putting a different test on politicians now than they did<br />
before, although it's not the total answer.<br />
HOGAN: To get to this campaign, would it be a sufficient<br />
victory to you to win simply because you are the lesser of<br />
two evils?<br />
PH: No. It wouldn't be satisfying. It would be enough I<br />
suppose. I mean there would be that and let me say quite<br />
honestly that one of the elements in what I think will be<br />
our victory, and I hope will be, will be a judgement by the<br />
electorate, that they simply will not have Mr Peacock and<br />
the Opposition. That will be a factor. But I also believe<br />
that by the time this campaign is over Alan, and I will have<br />
been all around Australia I will have explained in detail<br />
and be subject to questioning by you and your colleagues-I<br />
will put the positive side, both of the Government's<br />
achievements and of our program for the future. So it will<br />
be a combination I can speak to you quite honestly-</p>
<p>part of it will be an appreciation, a positive appreciation.<br />
I have no doubt that part of it will be a conviction that<br />
the other Side is not ready to govern. I mean, I said this<br />
morning, and I mean it, it has affected my Party in the<br />
past. The Australian electorate tends to say to a party<br />
it has historically and I think it will currently say,<br />
that if you can't govern yourselves, you can't govern the<br />
country. HOGAN: Do you detect seven years on, less popular<br />
enthusiasm for you than there were for you in those heady<br />
days in 1983?<br />
PN: I don't think that I would ever be able to maintain the<br />
Peaks that I achieved in ' 83 and ' 584. 1 hope I can say this<br />
to you honestly I do have a great sense of pride in the<br />
fact that it's just not my analysis but what the<br />
professionals say is that it is remarkable how high the<br />
S aipnp rsaoyvainlg rtahtaint. g haI s justsat yeamd uppro uadn d thIa td own'hta t haI vere gaanryd parso blaems<br />
love affair with the Australian people seems to have been<br />
going on pretty solidly.<br />
HOGAN: There's no doubt that you're ahead in moat of the<br />
polls. But one poll I saw recently was small business<br />
employers, 80% of whom said they would vote against the<br />
Labor Party in this election. D~ oes that either surprise or<br />
disappoint you:<br />
PM: I wouldn't believe that a whole of small business can<br />
I don't know who took it and just how you<br />
HOGAN: Arthur Anderson.<br />
PM: Arthur Anderson<br />
HOGAN; On a sam~ ple of a thousand.<br />
PN: Yes, a thousand. Well there are 750,000 small<br />
businesses around Australia and I think that's the figure<br />
HOGAN: L~ et's not argue about the sample. Do you detect<br />
that small business people don't like you anymore.<br />
HOGAN: No, I don't. It would be surprising if the<br />
intelligent group of small business didn't like us and were<br />
prepared to vote against us because they have an<br />
alternative. The alternative had 7 years before us and what<br />
do they do for small business? They produced the worst<br />
recession in 50 years. They produced a situation where<br />
small businesses had no chance. Unemployment was growing.<br />
What we've done is to give massive employment growth,<br />
massive economic growth and small businesses prospered in<br />
that. We've reduced their tax burden. we've increased the </p>
<p>amount that they are able to keep without punitive taxation.<br />
So anl intelligent appraisal of self-interest, and that's<br />
always a pretty, you know# significant thing that people in<br />
the end do. A significant appraisal of ones self interest<br />
shouldn't leave them to vote against us.<br />
MOGAN: The Opposition says a vote for Bob Hawke is a vote<br />
for Paul Keating. Would that be a bad thing?<br />
PH: Well it would be an irrelevant thing. It would be like<br />
most of the things they say, untrue. Because I have said<br />
and I know what the facts are I will lead the Party in<br />
this election, and we've started on that, on that. I<br />
hope and believe I'll lead them to victory and I will be<br />
Prime Minister for the full term of the fourth Hiawke<br />
Government. HOGAN: For the record, will you stand as Labor leader in<br />
the election following this one?<br />
PM: I was asked that this morning, Alan. I said I would<br />
lead the Party into the next election and as my thinking is<br />
now, I'd probably retire some time during that next period.<br />
HUJG": Let's turn to economics for a moment.<br />
PH: I thought we'd been there a bit.<br />
HOGAN: No, not yet.<br />
PX: Can we establish some economic facts about Labor's 7<br />
years in Government. It is true that while you've been<br />
Prime Minister real wages and productivity have declined and<br />
overseas debt has increased?<br />
PK: Sure, we'll establish facts about the economy. It is a<br />
fact that there has been a decline in real wages but it's<br />
also the fact that there's been a significant increase in<br />
real disposable household income. That's because the<br />
disposable income of a fellow who depends not simply upon<br />
wages but it depends upon these other things. The amount of<br />
employment in the household, what's hatppened to social<br />
welfare payments and social justice payments, and what's<br />
happened to tax. So when you take a combination of what's<br />
happened to movements in money wages and what's happened to<br />
tax and what's happened to employment and what's happened to<br />
social justice payments, there have been significant real<br />
increases in household disposable income, fact one. Fact<br />
two in regard to debt, yes there has been an Increase in<br />
debt but there has been a decline and a removal of my<br />
Government's debt because we have wiped out the inherited<br />
nine and a half billion dollar deficit whiuh was the legacy<br />
from the incompetent conservatives and transformed that into<br />
a mirror image surplus of over $ 9B, and that's transformed </p>
<p>the Commonwealth from a borrower anid a heavy borrower and<br />
maker of demand upon public savinigs into a situation where<br />
we are in nett credijt. Now the next thing to say about debt<br />
Alan, is that debt is something we have to and I'll say<br />
something about that in a moment. But remember that a lot<br />
Of that debt is good, I mean if I show you the North West<br />
Shelf, magnificent project. A lot of debt is reflected in<br />
that, debt which was incurred to build that. Now that's<br />
earning us foreign income. so we've got to recognise it,<br />
there's a plus in that, But I'm riot complacent about it and<br />
that's why we're pursuing these fiscal policies which are<br />
reducing our demand upon savings so that there will ba a<br />
greater capacity for the Australian private sector to<br />
finance its investors from within Australia.<br />
HOGAN: can I ask you a multiple choice question, Sir? A, B<br />
and C. Is the economy in good Shape, as good as it<br />
Could be or not very good?<br />
PM4: It's in good shape. Any intelligent and committed<br />
community can always do better. It is in infinitely better<br />
shape than it was when we came to office. I mean just a few<br />
facts. Employment growth in our 7 years, five times faster<br />
than it was in the previous 7 years, employment growth under<br />
us, twice as fast as the rest of the world. Economic<br />
growth, twice as fast as it was in the previous period. Now<br />
HOGAN: Interest rates are pretty high too.<br />
PM: But it hasn't reached the peak that it did under the<br />
conservatives and they are coming down.<br />
HOGAN: Look<br />
PM: And as I said Alan, I'm not a masochist or a sadist. I<br />
don't want to hurt myself and I most certainly don't want to<br />
S thiugrhtt yowuarg esv iepwoelrisc. y arBiud t weI whaedr e tisgthitl l fiIsmcpaolr tipnogl icmyo, r e It hhaand we<br />
could pay for. The responsible but the hard thing to do<br />
and it's cost me in political points in the latter part of<br />
last year but what I had to do it I was going to be a<br />
responsible leader was to keep interest rates high with<br />
tough monetary policy. It's working, it working, the<br />
policies are working, demand is coming down and fortunately<br />
the judgement, not just of Bob Hawke but of the banking<br />
industry, is that rates are coming down. We had to do it a<br />
bit tough and I0m sorry. I say to your viewers if there was<br />
an easier way of doing it, it would've been done. The<br />
policies are working and you've got a * table basis for<br />
growth into the future.<br />
HOGAN: TIwo specific policy questions before we go. One on<br />
media ownership, overseas ownership of media. Will you </p>
<p>allow 40% overseas ownership or 20% overseas ownership?<br />
PM: Well I wouldn't think 4o% had a lot of legs. The<br />
HOGAN: But is that a policy statement?<br />
PM: well it is not avoiding you it'R simply saying~<br />
this; that I'm very uunfident of what I think the concern of<br />
Australian's about the ownership of media in general arnd I<br />
think television in particular and what Ralph Willis, the<br />
Minister, is doing is he's coming up with some proposals but<br />
Obviously that's got to go onz hold during the campaign and<br />
HOGAN: So you will not have a policy on that during the<br />
campaign? PK4: I mean the processes of policy formulation on specific<br />
issues and decision making, I mean that process goes ini to<br />
recess. I mean once Monday comes we do not, in the<br />
conventional terms, have the authority to be making<br />
decisions. Ralph Willis will be on the campaign trail like<br />
the rest of my Ministers.<br />
HOGAN: I'm not quite followinyj this, Prime Minister. You<br />
say you're not going to have a policy on overseas ownership<br />
of media?<br />
PM: I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying in terms of the<br />
formulation. I mean the Minister has said that he is<br />
considering the issue and he's going to be bringing<br />
submissions to the cabinet. All I'm saying in that those<br />
processes of Ministers bringing submissions to Cabinet<br />
during a campaign to go to an election, you don't have, by<br />
convention, the Cabinet processes going on. I'm saying that<br />
as soon as the election is over the Minister will come to us<br />
with a proposal as to whether there's got to be a change in<br />
the legislation. I mean there is legislation there. The<br />
position that's been put now is that there are holes in the<br />
legislation which can produce an unintended consequence.<br />
HOGAN: public won't know you're policy on this before<br />
the election?<br />
PM: Not at all. I mean the fact is that we have indicated<br />
that the election that there is a concern here and the<br />
Minister is working on it. But just as all my Ministers on<br />
a range of particular issues would've been preparing<br />
submissions to bring to Cabinet to finalise a new position.<br />
So here, Mr Willis will have to wait until after the<br />
election and we will then make a decision. But I0m qoing to<br />
be busy and Mr Willis is going to be busy in the period<br />
between now and the 24th campaigning then we'll pick up the<br />
process of decision making. </p>
<p>HOGAN: I'm rcluctan. to leaive this altoqether at this<br />
point. But are you clearly saying the public will not know<br />
your policy on overseas ownership of media before the<br />
election? PM: There will not be a finalised position because the<br />
process of decision making involves a minister saying to me<br />
HOGAN: But you can tell him now to make the decision. You<br />
could make the decision for him.<br />
PM: It's not the way I operate. We have Ministers, a very,<br />
very good ministry. I mean if I attempted to make a<br />
decision in every area of every portfolio, what a metss it<br />
would be. Now be realistic, Alan. A minister has to accept<br />
his responsibilities of bringinzg a submission to the<br />
cabinet. That will be brought. There won't be any dodging<br />
of the issue, I can assure you and if there is a need for a<br />
change in the legislation because now while the legislation,<br />
it was said, produced a limit of 20, what has been put now<br />
is that there are loopholes there which could give you<br />
almost unlimited overseas ownership. Well that's not on.<br />
We'll give you that statement now. That is not on and I<br />
will be looking with interest what the Minister brings to<br />
ensure that there are acceptable limits to oversG! e<br />
ownership. HOGAN: A Queensland question before we go. Why is the<br />
Queensland Environment Minister complaining that the Federal<br />
Government isn't doing enough to protect North Queensland's<br />
rainf orests<br />
PM: He's not saying that, that we're not doing enough to<br />
protect the forests. There has been some suggestion I see,<br />
of some difterence, but I've had just same advice this<br />
morning, I can say to you and your viewers that the issues<br />
that have arisen between the Queensland Government and<br />
ourselves will be resolved to the~ satisfaction of both<br />
Bides. HOGAN: That's fortunate going into an election I would<br />
imagine. PH: It's necessary at any time. I mean I have no doubt of<br />
my capacity to work very closely with my good friend, Wayne<br />
Goss. HOGAN: Finally zIir, is it too early to predict the outcome<br />
of this election? Is Labor going to lose seats or win them?<br />
PM: I'm not complacent and cocky about it but I think we<br />
have reason to be confident. I've got to work hard in this<br />
election, I will and so will my Ministers. I see no reason </p>
<p>for losing seats. I see some areas where we can pick them<br />
up but I'll be taking this campaign very seriously.<br />
HOGAN: Prime Hinister, thanks very much for your time.<br />
PM: It's been a pleasure, Alan.<br />
