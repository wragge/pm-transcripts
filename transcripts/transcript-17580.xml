The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard today announced additional assistance for primary producers and small businesses affected by flooding last month in Carnarvon and the Upper Gascoyne in Western Australia.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister has agreed to a request from the WA Premier, Colin Barnett to activate a joint Commonwealth State Government assistance package of clean-up and recovery grants worth up to $15,000.</p>
<p>These one-off "Category C Grants", will cover primary producers and small businesses in Ashburton, Carnarvon, Exmouth, Murchison, Northampton, Shark Bay and the Upper Gascoyne - areas that have been declared natural disaster zones.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the grants would support primary producers and small businesses doing it tough as a result of the extensive flooding.These one-off grants will help reduce impact of the floods on local economies and ensure businesses are able to get back on track as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The new assistance is in addition to the joint Commonwealth State payments and support that were activated in flood-affected regions by the WA Government on 20 December.</p>
<p>The Category C Grants, provided under Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA), will:</p>
<p> * 	Help primary producers with general clean up costs including the removal of debris and dead livestock, purchase of fodder and replacement trading stock and repairs to damaged equipment and property access; and<br />
 * 	Help small businesses affected by flooding to conduct repairs and resume trading as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Existing joint Commonwealth/WA Government NDRRA assistance being provided includes:</p>
<p> * 	Emergency assistance payments for people who have suffered personal hardship or distress;<br />
 * 	Interest rate subsidies for small businesses and primary producers as part of loans up to $150,000;<br />
 * 	Professional advice grants of up to $1,500 and freight subsidies for primary producers (up to 50 per cent for the cost of transporting livestock, fodder or water for livestock or building or fencing equipment or machinery as a direct result of a natural disaster)<br />
 * 	Restoration of public infrastructure; and<br />
 * 	Certain counter disaster operations.</p>
