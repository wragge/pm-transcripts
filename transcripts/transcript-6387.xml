SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIAN MINING INDUSTRY COUNCIL ANNUAL DINNER<br />
CANBERRA 2 MAY 1984<br />
Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
I particularly appreciate the opportunity to join you this<br />
evening. I think you will all agree we are in the midst of a very<br />
important phase in Australia's economic development.<br />
1983 was the year in which economic recovery began<br />
in which significant inroads were made into<br />
unemployment and employment rebounded from the<br />
depths of recession;<br />
in which the inflation rate was significantly<br />
reduced; in which a number of measured steps were taken to<br />
begin the process of structural adjustment and to<br />
improve the flexibility of the Australian economy.<br />
1981' was also the year in which Australia gave itself a new<br />
deal in industrial relations and benefitted greatly from the<br />
consequent decline in the incidence of industrial<br />
disputation. I appreciate that not all sectors have as yet been able to<br />
participate fully in the general economic upturn.<br />
For some segments of the mining industry, in particular, the<br />
outlook is not as encouraging as for other sectors in the<br />
economy. A variety of factors contribute to this rather<br />
unique situation of some parts of the mining industry.<br />
A major factor is that one would normally expect some<br />
slowing as the several large resource projects undertaken<br />
over the past few years come to fruition. </p>
<p>Those projects had a genesis in an economic climate, and the<br />
associated perceptions of the future, which is quite<br />
different to what we are experiencing today.<br />
A particular feature of that climate was a view that the<br />
1980' s and 1990' s would be marked by the levels of supply<br />
and demand for energy resources which were experienced in<br />
the 19701s.<br />
For a number of reasons that expectation has not been<br />
realised. These include that energy conservation and the pattern of<br />
substitution between energy sources has turned out to be<br />
less favourable to Australian producers than then thought.<br />
At the same time there has been a substantial decline in<br />
demand resulting from the global recession from which the<br />
industralised countries are now emerging.<br />
These factors have resulted in a difficult trading<br />
environment and have contributed to a squeeze on volume and<br />
value of sales, and hence profitability. Recovery from this<br />
situation will be governed both by the pace at which sales<br />
pick up and by improvements in the competitiveness of the<br />
industry. Both the domestic macro-economic outlook and the prospects<br />
for the international economy suggest,, however, that in the<br />
longer term, the Australian mining industry can anticipate a<br />
better operating environment.<br />
Central to this view is that, nationally, conditions are now<br />
in place on which to build sound economic recovery with<br />
improved profitability, employment, and living standards.<br />
A key of Labor's economic policy approach and critical to<br />
its success is the Prices and Incomes Accord.<br />
The Accord has ushered in a new era of better industrial<br />
relations and a new approach to economic management in<br />
Australia. Despite a strong upturn in economic activity, the number of<br />
working days lost due to industrial disputes in Australia in<br />
1983 was the lowest since 1967.<br />
As you would all know Award wages have grown in line with<br />
half-yearly indexation arrangements with very little<br />
movement outside of that. 3<br />
award waqyes grew by only 4, per cent in 1983,<br />
compared to 11 1/ 4 per cen~ in 1982 </p>
<p>Individual unions have made public commitments to the<br />
Arbitration Commission and indirectly to the Australian<br />
people not to seek extra-indexation payments.<br />
And, overwhelmingly, these undertakings have been honoured.<br />
Under the terms of the Accord, wages growth over the next<br />
twelve months will be low by international standards:<br />
The March quarter CPI, just released, has shown a<br />
fall of a striking 0.4 per cent, the lowest outcome<br />
in 30 years.<br />
This movement, of course, reflects the impact of Medicare on<br />
the price to consumers of medical and hospital services.<br />
But not just the Medicare effect. Excluding the hospital<br />
and medical services component, the CPI rose only 1.2 per<br />
cent in the March quarter<br />
Half the rise of the December quarter; and almost a<br />
percentage point less than the rise of the 1983<br />
March quarter<br />
This is the lowest rise in the overall CPI in six years; and<br />
provides further testimony of the moderation of inflation<br />
which our policies have brought under the terms of the<br />
Accord. This, together with signs of some renewed inflationary<br />
pressures among our competitors, has substantially improved<br />
Australia's competitive position.<br />
I would add in this regard that it is now likely that award<br />
wages growth over the course of 1984 could be as low as<br />
per cent.<br />
Indeed it is notable that by the second half of 1983 the<br />
non-farm profit share of GDP had risen to 15.4 per cent, the<br />
highe, st level since the second half of 1973. At the same<br />
time'the wage share had fallen to 63 per cent, the lowest<br />
level since the second half of 1970.<br />
Under the current indexation arrangements and a climate of<br />
broad adherance to the Commission's rulings, a further<br />
decline in real unit labour costs and an increase in<br />
corporate profits can reasonably be expected for the rest of<br />
1983/ 84 and through into 1984/ 85.<br />
This will provide our industries with a valuable competitive<br />
fillip at a time when international inflation is likely to<br />
be picking up.<br />
The decline . in Iinflation has also been reflected in a<br />
general downward trend in most long-term interest rates<br />
since mid 1982. </p>
<p>Share market prices have also reflected the long-term<br />
improvement in business conditions.<br />
These developments have significantly facilitated the<br />
servicing of debt and have improved the climate for<br />
refinancing. In the context of the scope for non-inflationary<br />
expansionary policies which the Accord had established, the<br />
Budget in 1983-84 provided stimulus to the economy at a time<br />
when private sector demands were weak.<br />
In this regard the 1983-84 Budget is recognised as having<br />
been outstandingly successful. It struck the right balance.<br />
Furthermore the 1983-84 Budget deficit is s3till on target<br />
an achievement our predecessors were incapable of<br />
delivering. Our aim in the 1984-85 Budget will be to maintain and<br />
broaden the recovery that is now underway. We will again<br />
strike the balance which is right for 1984-85.<br />
While it is not possible to be precise about numbers at this<br />
stage, the Government's aim is to reduce significantly the<br />
deficit in 1984-85. What we wish to achieve is a<br />
significant reduction in the share of the Commonwealth<br />
deficit as a percentage of GDP. We expect to do this while<br />
also achieving some significant alleviation of the personal<br />
income tax burden on lower and middle income groups.<br />
Such a reduction in the demands made by the public sector on<br />
financial narkets is the responsible course given that the<br />
economy is now growing again and that there is some evidence<br />
that the private sector's demand for funds is picking up.<br />
The actual deficit will need to have regard for balance in<br />
the pursuit of our objectives. These include a. wish not to<br />
put undue pressures throu gh the financial markets on<br />
intergst rates or on the exchange rate. As a Government we<br />
have'been and will remain very mindful of the relevance of<br />
such factors for the profitability and competitiveness of<br />
Australian industry. We would, nevertheless, be<br />
irresponsible to cut spending programs so sharply as to<br />
undermine or put at risk the recovery in domestic demand and<br />
profitability, and the viability of the Accord.<br />
The prospect next year is for declining, not rising domestic<br />
pressures on interest rates and the exchange rate. These<br />
prospects will provide substantial benefits to the mining<br />
industry.<br />
-1 woul~ d add tha~ t t-he--decisl6n taken last year flb float the<br />
dollar was enthusiastically greeted by exporters, including<br />
many of you here this evening. </p>
<p>It was acknowledged to be a sound and rational move.<br />
The exchange rate will no longer be artificially manipulated<br />
by non-participants attempting to second guess the market.<br />
The exchange rate is now attuned to market: realities.<br />
In respect of home markets it is clear that 1984 will<br />
continue to be a good year for Australian industry<br />
generally, which will also go some way towards improving<br />
prospects for the mining industry.<br />
Both the housing industry and consumer spending seem set to<br />
remain strong in 1984.<br />
These developments, the likely rebuilding of stocks, and the<br />
pickup in the general level of domestic manufacturing<br />
activity provide a firm base for an expansion of domestic<br />
demand for metals and metal products.<br />
We are aware that a pick-up in business investment is<br />
necessary if we are to have sustained economic growth. But<br />
we recognise that decisions about the timing and volume of<br />
investment are of course for business to make in the light<br />
of commercial judgement.<br />
The Government also recognises that the readiness of firms<br />
to undertake investment normally emerges at the later stages<br />
of the recovery cycle.<br />
What we contend is that the Government has put in place the<br />
macroeconomic policies which are producing an environment<br />
increasingly conducive to renewed business investment.<br />
I appreciate that while there are indications that 1984-85<br />
will be a better year for business investment than 1983-84-<br />
and the The Government considers it important that it<br />
should be this will not be the case in many segments of<br />
the mining industry.<br />
As I'iientioned earlier there are forces at work unique to<br />
the industry affecting the supply of and demand for many<br />
minerals, which are a deterrent to renewed growth in some<br />
areas.<br />
But at the same time it is encouraging that prospects for<br />
world recovery into 1984 and beyond are good.<br />
The United States' economy, which has become the fundamental<br />
engine of growth in this upturn, has grown vigorously during<br />
1983 and into the early months of 1984.<br />
Current . foreoasts by world agencies have coh õ 6r~ a't'vely put<br />
United States growth in 1984 at around 5 per cent. </p>
<p>The Japanese economy is also exhibiting encouraging signs of<br />
growth, with a forecast for growth of 4.1 per cent in fiscal<br />
1984. The international recovery remains rather narrowly based in<br />
other industrialised countries, but the signs of pick-up are<br />
unmistakable. Economic activity in the newly industrialising econom ies of<br />
East and South East Asia, continues to be strong.<br />
To date, the world recovery has been achieved without a<br />
resurgence of inflation.<br />
Fears have been expressed, however, that the US recovery may<br />
be too rapid. This may, subject to the stance of US<br />
monetary policy, fuel higher inflation as time progresses.<br />
Some may see short-term advantage in such a prospect.<br />
To date, the pick-up in world activity has had only a patchy<br />
impact on the demand for our major mineral exports and the<br />
prices which are paid for them.<br />
Faster recovery abroad and faster inflation abroad will tend<br />
to benefit both Australia's competitive position, and the<br />
profitability and volume of our exports in the short run.<br />
But the price which the economy would pay in the long-term<br />
would be an international recovery which is short lived and,<br />
therefore, a renewed downturn in our trading prospects.<br />
But it would be wise not to be unduly pessimistic.<br />
In calender 1983 the volume of our non-rural exports rose<br />
rapidly by about 11 per cent.<br />
This growth was broadly based, reflecting a rise in Japanese<br />
purchpses of iron ore and coking coal; increased exports of<br />
gas;' and strong growth in manufactured exports.<br />
The current situation facing Australian coal exporters<br />
merits particular comment.<br />
The long-term electricity supply plans of our trading<br />
partners Japan and Korea, point to significant prospects for<br />
future exports of Australian steaming coal.<br />
Of course, I am not suggesting that we are assured of future<br />
expansion of these exports. The current oversupply<br />
situation, bilateral trade pressures and policies directed<br />
. at -diver~ i f-ication of snurces 6f sdpply ' Must't~ mpgr thi's<br />
assessment. Nevertheless current trade forecasts suggest<br />
that we could double or even treble our steaming coal<br />
exports by 1990. </p>
<p>These projections atand even in circumstances where there<br />
has been a lower than expected growth in power demand in<br />
recent years and a consequential slowing of the rate at<br />
which steaming coal is being substituted for oil.<br />
The outlook for coking coal is less clear. While our<br />
exports are growing and record export tonnages are likely<br />
for 1983-84, future sales contracts with Japan remain<br />
uncertain. Total exports by 1990 may only increase<br />
marginally from their current levels.<br />
There is no question that price cuts and tonnage reductions<br />
in the Japanese market will increase pressures upon the<br />
local industry. We are indeed aware that a critical stage<br />
has been reached in the coal industry's development and we<br />
have made it the focus of several important policy<br />
initiatives. Since assuming office we have implemented an export control<br />
administration which is directed to the optimisation of our<br />
market strength by unifying our selling position. In this<br />
endeavour we have sought to work closely with the industry<br />
to reach broad agreement on market strategies.<br />
We are now examining ways in which this process could be<br />
improved. It has been with reluctance that the Government today<br />
approved pricing proposals submitted by the Australian<br />
industry for the sale of hard coking coal to Japan.<br />
As the Minister for Trade Mr Bowen said earlier today, the<br />
Government was very concerned that the Australian<br />
negotiating position had been undermined by some companies<br />
having agreed to price cuts, and indicating their intention<br />
to abandon agreed parameters and settle without Government<br />
approval. Thereafter, as Mr Bowen has said, the negotiating<br />
position of the remaining Australian companies collapsed.<br />
it be~ ame untenable for the Australian Government, in these<br />
circuimstances, to expect any revision of the pricing<br />
arrangements imposed by the Japanese mills.<br />
Future prospects of the iron ore industry are interwoven<br />
with those of coking coal.<br />
Although some predicted that the international situation<br />
would not improve until 1986, there are now signs which are<br />
more encouraging. 1984 Japanese steel production estimates<br />
are up to 104 million tonnes. This, together with the<br />
recovery in the domestic steel industry, should be<br />
encouraging news for iron ore producers f or 1984. </p>
<p>In addition, we have the potential to expand into other<br />
markets in Asia. Sales to China and Taiwan in 1983 enabled<br />
us to make up the shortfall in exports to Japan. Along with<br />
Korea, these countries offer scope for export growth in<br />
future years.<br />
However, the Government is not simply waiting for an upturn<br />
in the trade cycle to provide a panacea for the ills of the<br />
mining industry. We have taken positive measures in the<br />
search for new market opportunities and to address<br />
structural problems in the industry.<br />
We are now reviewing in consultation with the New South<br />
Wales Government, the operations of the Joint Coal Board to<br />
see how it can be improved.<br />
We have also established the Australian Coal Consultative<br />
Council in order to improve the ongoing dia]. ogue between<br />
management, unions and Government.<br />
Similarly we have encouraged the creation of' an Iron Ore<br />
Consultative Council. This represents a very positive step<br />
towards fostering a spirit of consultation and co-operation.<br />
More broadly based and necessary consultations are also<br />
being encouraged. I appreciate, for example, the concern of<br />
the mining industry to be fully consulted on any legislation<br />
proposed by the Government on aboriginal land rights. For<br />
reasons such as this the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is<br />
seeking to establish a Forum through which the relevant<br />
concerns of aborigines and the mining industry can be raised<br />
and considered in detail.<br />
Our program of assistance to the steel industry has also<br />
provided tangible benefits to the iron ore industry.<br />
The measures taken should lead to a steel industry which is<br />
well placed to take advantage of new opportunities. They<br />
will a~ lso contribute to the continued viability of the iron<br />
ore Industry.<br />
The joint initiative for iron and steel co-operation with<br />
China will also contribute to maintenance of a viable and<br />
competitive Australian steel industry.<br />
This is a most important initiative.<br />
The Joint Study Group, the establishment of which was agreed<br />
between Premier Zhao and myself in February, met formally in<br />
Beijing a couple of weeks ago. Concrete possibilities were<br />
identified and discussed in each of the areas that Premier<br />
Zhao and I had considered. </p>
<p>Simultaneously Australia's private corporations with whom<br />
the ultimate commercial decisions on trade and investment<br />
will rest have been engaged in detailed discussions of<br />
specific commercial opportunities in this area. CRA, under<br />
Sir Roderick Carnegie, has already discussed a range of<br />
concrete proposals for co-operation in iron and steel. As<br />
well, delegations from BHP's minerals and steel divisions<br />
have visited China recently to discuss a number of<br />
substantial proposals.<br />
This considerable level of activity will shortly be<br />
complemented by the visit to Australia, starting on 10 May,<br />
of the Chinese Minister for Metallurgy. He will familiarise<br />
himself with the Australian iron and steel industry, advance<br />
discussions with Australian companies and hold further<br />
discussions with the Australian Government.<br />
In short, there has already been very considerable progress<br />
with this major development in co-operative relations<br />
between Australia and China. The Government will continue<br />
to pursue its interest in ensuring a satisfactory framework<br />
within which Australian industry might secure the very real<br />
opportunities which exist.<br />
It is, as I have said, for the companies concerned to make<br />
the necessary decisions. I am confident, nevertheless, that<br />
with the continued co-operation of all parties quite<br />
substantial benefits will be realized by all concerned.<br />
Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
My Government recognises the vital role which the private<br />
sector has to play in securing Australia's economic future.<br />
Our policies are framed to provide an environment conducive<br />
to private sector recovery.<br />
Macroeconomic policy is supporting domestic demand in the<br />
short,-term, while putting the maximum feasible restraint on<br />
domestic costs. These are creating the conditions for<br />
durable recovery in the private sector. The Government aims<br />
to remove distortions in the Australian economy wherever<br />
possible and thus improve our ability to compete in world<br />
markets into the future. Our initiatives are measured and<br />
realistic. They are being developed in consultation with<br />
the business community and the trade unions.<br />
They require the co-operation of all parties to be<br />
successful and I have no doubt that they will continue to<br />
receive broad support. </p>
<p>The final message which I wish to convey to you this evening<br />
is the firm confidence I hold in our future. In saying this<br />
I do not wish to resurrect the damaging " boom" rhetoric of<br />
the previous Government. Nor would I wish to underestimate<br />
the challenges we face; one the Government is particularly<br />
concerned with, for example, is the promotion of necessary<br />
structural change in Australian industry.<br />
My message to you is more specific. It is simply that<br />
despite the short-term problems which still plague the<br />
resources sector including worldwide overcapacity and<br />
depressed prices it is essential that we remain a nation<br />
with an efficient and competitive resources sector.<br />
This is a fundamental factor which will ensure Australia's<br />
underlying strength for the future. </p>
