FOR PRESS P. M. No. 47/ 1964<br />
EXCHANGE OF MESSAGE3<br />
The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, last week<br />
sent the following message to the Acting Prime Minister of<br />
Israel, Mr. Abba Eban " You will have heard from your Ambassador<br />
that, on medical advice, I am required to cancel<br />
my visit to Israel next week. This gives me<br />
personally and officially the greatest possible<br />
regret, I would like you to know how grateful I am<br />
for the invitation extended to me by your Prime<br />
Minister and for the arrangements which you and<br />
your colleagues had made to receive me. I am<br />
most disappointed not to be able to visit Israel<br />
at this time. I would like you to convey my<br />
personal regrets also to the President of Israel,<br />
Mr. Zalman Shazar."<br />
The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Monzies, has received<br />
the following message from Mr. Abba Eban, Acting Primo Minister<br />
of Israel " While I am naturally disappointed by<br />
your inability to be with us this week, my first<br />
thought and that of my colleagues is for your rapid<br />
restoration to complete health. Please accept<br />
Israel's best wishes for your recuperation together<br />
with an expression of hope that we may have the<br />
privilege of receiving you in our country in the<br />
near future."<br />
CANBERRA, 17th June, 1964. </p>
