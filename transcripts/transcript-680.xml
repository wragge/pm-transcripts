P. M. No. 8/ 1963<br />
FOR PRESS EUROPEAN CO'GiON MARKET<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Rt. Hon. R. G, Menzies<br />
" I am expecting to receive a message from Mr.<br />
Macmillan which will, no doubt, convey some assessment of<br />
the present position and of the future possibilities.<br />
I will have this matter discussed when Cabinet meets on<br />
0 Tuesday next. Meanwhile, it should not be overlooked that<br />
the result of the breaking-off of the negotiations is that<br />
the existing Commonwealth trading arrangements continue.<br />
Whether any move should be made, however, to<br />
alter these arrangements or to strengthen them in any way<br />
or to make any fresh departure will be matters that will<br />
need to be discussed by the Cabinet itself."<br />
On the question of an early meeting of Prime<br />
Ministers, Mr. Menzies said he would not offer any views<br />
until he had discussed it with the Cabinet. " It must be<br />
remembered," he said, " that any meeting of Prime Ministers<br />
required some preparatory work and some clear idea of the<br />
nature and content of the matters to be discussed."<br />
CANBEPRA, January, 1963. </p>
