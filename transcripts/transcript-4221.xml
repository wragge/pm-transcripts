BROADCAST: 3H UNDAY Z. AtUGUST<br />
3YB -THURSDAY 2 SEPT.<br />

PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 29 AUGUST 1976<br />
ELECTORAL TALK<br />
Last week the Australian Labor Party's leader presented<br />
his formal alternative to the Government's Budget. One<br />
central fact emerged from his statement. And that is that<br />
he has not learnt or understood that before anything else<br />
inflation must be controlled.<br />
He has not been able to understand that in present circumstances<br />
inflation and unemployment and inextricable linked.<br />
He does not understand.-or does not want to understand that<br />
there cannot be any su'stained return to national growth and<br />
prosperity until inflation and inflationary<br />
expectations are curbe<br />
The Leader of the Opposition said, and I quote:<br />
" People come last" in the Liberal Budget.<br />
This is nonsense. I have said before and I repeat this is<br />
a Budget of reform, People come first.<br />
No aspect of our Budget demonstrates our concern for people more<br />
than the attack on inflation. I want to make the point clear.<br />
Unless inflation is seen to be coming under control there will be<br />
no increased investment, no long term sustained increase in consumer<br />
spending and no genuine increase in employment.<br />
Inflation must be controlled before unemployment can be<br />
reduced on a sustained long term level. There are no<br />
short run panaceas.<br />
As we have said all along even before we were electedthe<br />
job ahead will take time. The key to how quickly we progress<br />
depends on. what happens to inflation in the period ahead.<br />
We have set a planned, controlled and steady course to control inflation,<br />
Wle are determined as the Budget demonstrates to reduce the<br />
annual inflation rate below 10 percent before the end of the<br />
financial year. What a far cry this will be from the 17 and 18<br />
percent galloping inflation rate that highlighted the Whitlam years.<br />
Just what did this rampant inflation do to Australia? It<br />
cost tens of thousands of jobs, sent industry broke and bankrupt,<br />
crippled the rural sector and smashed the savings of the poor and<br />
the pensioners. It just about brought this nation to its knees. </p>
<p>Yet once again Mr Whitlam. has shown that he would go on spending.<br />
He is unrepentant. He doesn't learn easily. He fails to understand<br />
that his big spending approach simply leads to more inflation<br />
and more unemployment.<br />
I repeat, the budget document is a budget for the people-of<br />
Australia because it recognises the one central fact inflation<br />
must be controlled before we can return this nation to sound,<br />
stable, manageable growth.<br />
The Government's budget is also a budget that puts people first<br />
because it attacks the problems of taxation. For the first time<br />
in years it has taken the course of not raising any major tax at all.<br />
Anyone with the faintest concern with what is happening in<br />
Australia will know that taxation has become a major problem<br />
for individuals, families and businesses. Australians pay too much tax.<br />
We have blocked this unlegislated tax grab by Canberra.<br />
This Government is committed to tax reform. We have already<br />
introduced full indexation on personal income tax and we have<br />
started reforms in the complex area of business taxation.<br />
Tax indexation now in operation puts earnings back into the<br />
hands of individuals-and eliminates as far as possible total<br />
dependence on big government-programmes. We will continue<br />
to pursue vigorously our reforms in this vital area.<br />
Our approach to this probleml differs markedly from Mr Whitlam's.<br />
He does not see, or do ' es not want to see, that excessive taxes<br />
erode incentives and make Australian families increasingly<br />
dependent on what politicians choose to provide. In other words,<br />
Australians under Labor had to meekly surrender their priorities<br />
to a-Canberra based socialist government that believed that all<br />
power should rest with a few.<br />
Mr Whitlam. has again shed crocodile tears about this Government's<br />
method of putting responsibility back : into national management.<br />
Mr Whitlam mouths: meaningless words about our so-called:<br />
" heartlessness" and " skinflint mentality".<br />
Through this mindless rhetoric he and his party are incapable of<br />
understanding that the mere spending of money fuelled by inflationdoes<br />
nothing to meet the deep seated needs of the poor and<br />
underprivileged. He seems incapable of understanding that it is not<br />
enou gh that programmes are worthy. As I have often said, worthy<br />
goals are limitless -but resources are limited.<br />
It has been a tragedy for this young nation that both government<br />
programmes and the hopes and plans of individuals have had to be cut<br />
back because our national resources have actually been diminishing.<br />
It has been a tragedy that for three years we had a government<br />
which had neither courage nor the common sense to set and<br />
keep responsible priorities.<br />
We now have a Government that does have responsible attitues and<br />
has taken responsible action. Our first budget demonstrates our<br />
priorities and our desire to set Australia firmly towards prosperity.<br />
The budget provides jobs, restrains taxes, encourages initiative and<br />
helps those in need. It is a budget that Australians voted<br />
for last December. </p>
