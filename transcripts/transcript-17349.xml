    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister tonight announced the membership of the Expert Panel for the review of capital city strategic planning systems, at the Australian Council of Local Government (ACLG) dinner held in Parliament House.</p>
<p>Key challenges face Australia's cities including managing population and economic growth, addressing climate change, improving housing affordability and tackling urban congestion.</p>
<p>The Panel's role will be to support the COAG Reform Council, which will review planning systems to ensure they meet the agreed national criteria to make Australia's cities more productive, sustainable and liveable.</p>
<p>The Panel will be Chaired by the Hon Brian Howe, a pioneer of urban development who, through the Building Better Cities program, brought the Commonwealth back into city policy two decades ago.</p>
<p>The Deputy Chair will be Ms Lucy Turnbull who brings real-world local government experience as a former Lord Mayor of Sydney.</p>
<p>Members of the Panel are: Mr Rod Pearse OAM, Ms Jude Munro, Mr John Denton, Ms Sue Holliday, Professor Duncan Maclennan CBE FRSE AcSS, and Ms Meredith Sussex AM. Dr Geoff Gallop, Deputy Chair of the COAG Reform Council, will also take a particular responsibility on behalf of the COAG Reform Council for this initiative. A short biographical note on each member is attached.</p>
<p>The Panel provides a blend of experience, drawing its membership from people with backgrounds from the Commonwealth, state government, local government, academia, the private sector, design and planning.</p>
<p>This Panel has a critical role to play in the implementation of the landmark reform agreed at the December 2009 meeting of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) that will see high quality capital city strategic planning systems by 2012.</p>
<p>High quality city planning systems will also ensure that infrastructure investments - including investments by the Commonwealth in nationally significant infrastructure in our cities - deliver the best possible returns.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth must have confidence in the integrity of a capital city's strategic planning system if it is to continue to invest in that city.</p>
<p>In undertaking its review of strategic capital city strategic planning systems, the COAG Reform Council will consult Local Government.</p>
<p>Local Government are key partners in the governance of our capital cities and this partnership will be extended.</p>
<p>Local Government will have vital roles in the planning of our cities and in ensuring that those plans meet the needs of local communities.</p>
