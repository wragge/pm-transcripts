PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED BY GLENN TAYLOR -BRISBANE CH. 7<br />
STATE AFFAIR WEDNESDAY 24 OCTOBER 1984<br />
TAYLOR: At this stage -its early in the campaign but nevertheless<br />
aeveral subjects have emerged as alection iaques<br />
Already. Some of them have been raised right bero in<br />
Queensland welcome to you'Prime Miniater.<br />
Tax seems to be becoming predominant as the isBU* and<br />
an-you used yo'urself the ex pression the politics of<br />
fear today it is almost a situation of countervaLlinig<br />
fear. The fear on the one hand of Labor's capital<br />
gains tax on t~ he other hand, your fears of indirect taxes<br />
by a coalitionk oovernment.<br />
PM4: Well I don't think that adequately analyses what will1<br />
be In the mind s of the. eleectorate with regard to ta~ x as<br />
ana issue.. I liave made it ~ quite clear that I'm happy<br />
abo~ ut tax plaing a prominent part but it will be only<br />
a part tbut the electorate'will see of the major il3sua<br />
In their mind, that Is the : economy the management of'<br />
the economy@ What's happened iince M~ arch of 1983<br />
under ' us, includini what we've done in tax and comparIng<br />
that with the record of out, predacessors and within that<br />
context X'm more than happy that they should talk about<br />
-tax because they have the 4orst record on tax of any<br />
government in the history 6f Federation.<br />
TAYLORI: But is there qny substance IT the fears raised about a<br />
capita, gains*! tax In view Of statements raised by<br />
Senator Butto4 and also M-r'Stonol<br />
PH4: No basis for fear at all. On the contrary I have made<br />
it clear over, home period, ' before the election was even<br />
called that~ w w ere undertaking a thorough-going roview<br />
I S </p>
<p>-2.<br />
ove3rhaul, begicnning the processesb of an overhaul<br />
Of the tax system. See wbiat you've tot to remember<br />
1B that over toe last thirty-five years in this<br />
country since 1949-, for* 30 6f those years the<br />
conservatives have been in power, the existinlg tax<br />
system to a very large extent represents 30 years of<br />
conservatism. The people of Australia reckon its<br />
unfair the exiatirig tax'system, and they're right,<br />
so what I've been saying 1B that we will have a procoss<br />
of review, eivb the people the opportunity of saying<br />
what tbey want. 2 to look at, !# hat they think may be<br />
appropriate, and we have said within that the peopJle<br />
will want to tallk about tbe possibility of * a capital1<br />
gains tftx. No bringinS in. of' a now tax that doeSnk't<br />
exist, there's a capital gains tax there now. Whitt<br />
a lot of people are concerned about is tbat the tax<br />
avoidance induatry, which hais flourished under the<br />
liberals has cost the ordinary taxpayer billions of'<br />
dollars over the last tew years because the Liberals<br />
vouldn't-smash'it. There 4s. some sugsostion that<br />
some refinements of that exiating qapital'tax law may<br />
be desirable to really help: have the complete armoury<br />
against tax avoidance, VWetre simply saying that In<br />
the review that should take place and in which the people<br />
will be able to be* involved, that's Something that can<br />
be looked at.<br />
TAYLOR~: So all optlons will be opon and one of tihose options<br />
may be a capital gains tax.*<br />
What I'm saying is there is a capital gains tax, the<br />
conservatives bad a capital gaing tax, they support a<br />
capital gains tax Its there. . And Mr Peacock s&amp; y-3<br />
he supports the existing bapital. gains tax. What lie<br />
is saying he wbuldul't look ' at anything. which would help<br />
010se down the, tax avoidance industry rurther. Noll I<br />
believe the overwhelming majority of Australians Wotild<br />

<p>I 3.<br />
TAYLOM. PM: T'AYLOR: PM': like to have o+ n in a tax review a looking-~ at that<br />
existing law tb . gee whether" any changes in that<br />
may make for'a. more efficient fight against'tax<br />
avoidance. They would regard this government<br />
as being very,: very short In Its duty It it closed off<br />
the option of having that investigated,<br />
Coming back to my original j oint, if people shouldn't<br />
wuorry too miuch about a capitalgainstax, what do they<br />
have to fear ' riouj the Liberale indirect taxes that you<br />
say they have in their-pac~ cage?<br />
Well I suppoae'no words are more eloquent in saying what<br />
they've got to fear than the vords ot Mr Hloward on the<br />
12th of March 1981 in the Federal Parliament when he told<br />
the people of Australia what they had to fear. * He said<br />
why the government then wouldn't move in this direction,<br />
He'said we havb refused to nove in the direction of' this<br />
increase in indirect taxes because it would mean economic<br />
disaster, it w~ uld moan more inflation and the undoing<br />
of gene'ral ecooomic policy: He was right then and I<br />
simply ask tbe' people of Aubtralial and Mr Howard In<br />
particular, was he telling the truth in March 1981.<br />
If he was, qnd he was, what,' s 4ifferent in December 1984?<br />
to on the one band wehave the apectre of capital gains<br />
-being raised 4~ the Liberal Party and on your side the<br />
bpectre offndirect taxes with those sort<br />
I've dealt with capital gains, here we have the reality<br />
of thOese . people the conserv . atives, liberals and national<br />
party have said they've had twelve ibobths and they've<br />
said that this: ie a well-thought-out policy through<br />
12 months, and; that well. 4hought-through policy is<br />
. exactly the policy which three years ago Mr Howard said<br />
was a recipe for economic disas'ter. ' He also said on<br />
Monday night# ' after launcin. g it'on the. Monday, he said<br />
that this was An appropriate policyt one where the Prime<br />
Minister would get tax relief of $ 65 and the lower-income<br />
and a lot or otiher people get nothingt Now that came after </p>
<p>I -4<br />
TAYLOR: PH:<br />
TIAYLOR: PM: # 40/ 5<br />
12 4onths of th ' inking and the next day someone got<br />
onto him and said weld bette'r not say that so he<br />
put out tswo new* PPess releases saying it's not that,<br />
way. If you get re-*; lectod to off-ice, bearing in mind<br />
that there wa thirty years -of a cumbersome tax<br />
system that hasilt been changed or modified in any<br />
greatway, how soon would you review change, reforat<br />
it' you like, 0 th. e Australian taxation system?<br />
Well I think th. Australian people want us to do it<br />
carefully they won't be wanti4ng uto rush in<br />
so I would be thinaking that we would Invite the peoiple<br />
of Australia to'be involved. with us in this process,<br />
and at some poi Int during 1985 to have a more detailed<br />
opportunity of : being Involvad in that process. loll<br />
be-baying a little bit wore.* about this in come detail1<br />
within a matter: of days so that the people will have<br />
some concept ot. the tiioet~ ble before them,<br />
So it's3 going to be tax reform by consensus?<br />
or Courseb I mean what's distinguiahed the Australian<br />
economy under 4~ govlernment, what's made It the most<br />
sUccessful ecor~ omy In the world, the fastest-growing<br />
econ~ omyin the world, is precisely that's the way we<br />
went about fit. I didn't s~ t in Canberra'and say look<br />
this is good : idea, that'ls e good idea, that's a good<br />
ideal here it is it's done1 : Vve talked and my Ministers<br />
have talked witjh the trade tinions, with tbe business<br />
community, with the States, with local government, and<br />
we have got ou? 4 ideas together and4 got a large degree<br />
* of consenous. Now that'd worked for the Australian<br />
people, it's made us the fast6st.-growing economy in the<br />
world. Now the Australlan. poople. are going to want us<br />
to have the sam~ e sort of approach to share their thinking<br />
with us and our thinking with them. It' worked and </p>
<p>iI.<br />
-it will work again.<br />
TAYLOR: Mr Hawke, ft'ssaid that a government's as good as<br />
the oppositionthat keeps it on its toes, yet you<br />
point to having sO much support, and the opinion polls<br />
tend to back that up, is there a danger then, not or<br />
3ust' smugness but of perhapp almost lax governmept?<br />
PMf. No,. there's no danger of lax government because we<br />
have our own integrity and incentive to good government.<br />
We have a commtment to the welare of the people of<br />
Australia but in a sense you do touch on a relevant<br />
point. It is a tragedy. think that the Opposition<br />
is so one'ncoonpetent and b untunod-nto the concerns<br />
of the Australian olectorate. See in the Opposition<br />
we'. ve been aitfing there in the government we've been<br />
Mitting there . aiting for the Opposition, week after week,<br />
to ask quostions of Miniisters about their economic<br />
management of the country. We never ge theme Now<br />
I think it is the case that Hinristers would be more<br />
alert in the parliament, be more on their toes, if they<br />
knew that each:* day they wer, to be asked questions.<br />
So it is a ter'ible innult to the Australian people by<br />
the Opposition to be going on with this question about<br />
crime, spending weeks and weeks sayingfthat I'm a c'ook<br />
and controlled'bycrooka and that sort Of nonsense<br />
everyone knvse that's not true, and yet that's what took<br />
up their time'<br />
TAYLOR: You claimed to1ay that the Liberals are afraid to<br />
campaign on tbe economy. They seem to have been<br />
campaigning prptty heavily and they've pushed tax,<br />
capital gains ' and Other taft'atton mattersto the toretronto<br />
FPM: o the're not talking aboiit, the economy, they are<br />
saying that lr the future they are putting up a fear<br />
campaign.-look this Is what the government might do<br />
in the future: They're nct talking about the economy<br />
and our eoonomic management they you cast you're mind<br />
back, what bave they had to say during the campaign </p>
<p>-6-<br />
about the economiic performance6 of' Australia from<br />
March 83 until', November Whtave they bad<br />
to say about it?' No no yoj're saying they are<br />
talki2hg about the . economys yell I'm asking youthey've.<br />
talked~ about so . me-. future poosi~ bility with<br />
regard to tax, and I'm sayiing you tell me where<br />
they've talked, about the economy, what's happened<br />
betueen March 63 and now., they haven't. They haven't<br />
in the parliament and they ha'ien't in the cimpaign.<br />
Why? Because they know thAt you can't attack a<br />
government whic~ h has px'odueod the highest rate of<br />
e cQlnomi'c growt in the world, which io so markedly<br />
apectacular4L more succooful than they were<br />
in government,:<br />
Now do-you see the non-. Labor vote going in Oubensletnd?<br />
Those people'who, no matte what you say, aren't go'ing<br />
to vote for Bob Hawke?<br />
There are some of those yes', ' of course, Itis very<br />
d~ jrricult to tell at this stae because Queensland's<br />
going to be a very fascinating' State because the<br />
greatest bltteik-xtos and heat Is not going'to be between<br />
the non-Labor arties and Labor its between theq Liberals<br />
a nd the National Party up hero, that's one level of the<br />
bitterness; and tbe . other. eV ol . ia of the Federal Liberals<br />
and Nationals against the Sita Nationali. ir Job<br />
bjelke-Feteraen bias said b kin May that he didn't want<br />
to appear on the same platform as Mr Peacock and they're<br />
having a fight aB to who is the mroe moral whether it's<br />
inclair js more moral ' tban Hr Peacock or whethoir<br />
they're both a'Unificafltly 1-ess moral than Sir Joh<br />
so we're goinj to have groat debates and rights between<br />
thou4. Now how the non-Labor vote will be split up in<br />
thosep circumstnces is hot ( or me to asay, but its gobing<br />
to be interesting to watoh the brothers togother,<br />
Can I * et youton. one specific Issue as it affects<br />
Queensland t hat or land righta,, whore the Queensland<br />
t6e~ n very much against land rights Whitt's<br />
your opinion on that?<br />
TAYLOR: PH I<br />
TAYLOR: </p>
<p>PM: Yes. I mlade i* quite cloa'r over recent times our<br />
position on this. The people of Australia,-inclueling<br />
the people of* 9ueansland, in 967 passed referendum,<br />
by an overwhelioing majority' that responsibility for<br />
land rights should be with the Federal Parliament<br />
and that i's a concurrent po1~ er, but that there should<br />
be power In the Federal Parliament. How that was In<br />
1967, not under a Labor SoVenmento under a conservative<br />
government a Liboral-National Party government I<br />
think they pro6ably called themselVes the Liberal..<br />
Country Piarty.. They went to the poople of Australiap<br />
in~ 196? 1 and sAid it ia a popriate that the national<br />
ptarliament shodld have legi~ lative power over land<br />
rights: n~ ow what I am saying and aa the inheritor,<br />
of the power given to me. and to the. na~ ional parliament<br />
by the Liberaland Hational'Party,. I've inherited the<br />
power tboy gav6 TIm paying that* I will not seek to<br />
impose that poWer, -I'm sayipig that. I will consult<br />
VIth the States, that V11l pqnsult with the Aboriginal<br />
people, .11l c~ nault with tire miners,, I'll consult with<br />
the r'armers that proceP6' bas been going on. We' 1ve<br />
demonstrated in Western AU~ tP41ia-that we can get agreement<br />
with the minerb1 farmers an the S'tate government. Now<br />
my Minister will continue this prooosof negotiation<br />
qaid consultation uith the State of Queensland and if all<br />
other statoo cbn,' throush that process of consultation,<br />
reach agreement, I suppose It's leg~ itimato to hope that<br />
that may happen ina Queehidla~ 1d too.<br />
* TAXLOR.; Bob Havkel thank you ' very much for joini-ng us on<br />
-State Affair.<br />
