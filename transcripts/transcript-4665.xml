I,. EMBARGO: 10.00 a. m.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 3 APRIL 1978<br />
ADDRESS AT NATIONAL ABORIGINAL. CONFERENCE<br />
The establishment of the Council for Aboriginal Development and<br />
now this inaugural meeting of the National Aboriginal<br />
Conference effectively sets the seal on a real turning point<br />
in the development and administration of. Aboriginal and<br />
Torres Strait Islander affairs in Australia.<br />
Let this be the year when, whatever else we may be able to do,<br />
Australia finally achieves real equality of man with man, equality<br />
of opportunity, black with white, equality of all Australians before<br />
the law.<br />
The past history of the Aboriginal people since the white settlement<br />
in Australia has been marked by neglect, deprivation, grinding<br />
poverty and persecution. While not wishing to dwell on past<br />
events neither should we forget them. These events occurred<br />
because of the unthinking treatment of Aboriginals as at best<br />
second class citizens disqualified from equal treatment with<br />
other Australians because their colour was not white, because<br />
their culture was not European. Some people even tried to<br />
rationalise these abhorrent practices with half-baked<br />
arguments that Aboriginals were somehow inferior, that it was<br />
justifiable to treat Aboriginals with complete disregard for their<br />
human rights and liberties.<br />
In their ignorance and prejudice they ignored the rich and complex<br />
culture built up by Aboriginals over thousands of years. This<br />
attitude of wanton discrimination was not simply misconceived<br />
and pernicious, it physically degraded those who suffered at its<br />
hands. Even more, it morally degraded those who practiced it.<br />
The denial of fundamental human rights to any group in a society<br />
diminishes that society. We must all be resolved that such<br />
discrimination and bigotry will never happen again. All Australians<br />
are entitled to be treated equally under the law whatever their<br />
colour, whatever their race. All are entitled to equal respect<br />
and equal protection. The Government is resolved to put to an<br />
end the hurt, indifference and intolerance which almost<br />
destroyed the Australian Aboriginals and their culture.. ./ 2 </p>
<p>We are committed to ending the offensive paternalism of past<br />
policies, and we will oppose to the utmost the remnants of bigotry<br />
and intolerance towards Aboriginals still existing in our<br />
society. We will continue to pursue programmes which encourage<br />
Aboriginals to control their own affairs. Our basic commitment<br />
is that all Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders be as free<br />
as other Australians to determine their own varied futures.<br />
For it is this basic right which is essential for the building up<br />
of their sense of pride and self-esteem. Aboriginals have the<br />
fundamental right to choose whether to retain their distinctive<br />
traditional identity and culture, or, if they wish, to adopt<br />
partially or wholly a European lifestyle.<br />
The key feature of the Government's policy regarding Aboriginal<br />
advancement is summed up in the term " self-management".<br />
It was never good enough for politicans or bureaucrats whether<br />
at the State or Federal level to impose on the Aboriginal people<br />
their conception of what was good for the Aboriginal people.<br />
Aboriginals have the same right as every Australian citizen<br />
to determine what is best for them. That is why the work of this<br />
Conference is so important. I look to this Conference to be<br />
a forum for open expression, both in bringing forward new and<br />
creative ideas, and in evaluating existing programmes.<br />
You have the opportunity to articulate the needs of those<br />
whose voices may not otherwise be heard.<br />
One of the greatest challenges which will face you as members<br />
of this Conference will be to help us in devising effective social<br />
programmes which can bring an end to the cycle of poverty, sickness<br />
and loss of dignity still to be found in many Aboriginal<br />
communities. We have adopted a community-based approach to<br />
funding to ensure that the needs of communities are met in a<br />
coordinated way. The underlying theme of current spending in all<br />
Departments on Aboriginal projects some $ 176 million this year<br />
is the directing of resources into areas of greatest need in<br />
order to make the best use of available funds.<br />
To enable this to be done, the Government has established a<br />
programme to obtain accurate profiles of all Aboriginal communities<br />
so that their needs can be assessed and priorities properly<br />
determined. We wish to see Aboriginals exercising an<br />
increasing influence at national, regional and community levels<br />
in the determination of these priorities. Participation by<br />
yourselves in area and community programming conferences will<br />
help us to achieve this goal.<br />
Of course, money alone is not the solution to problems of dispossession<br />
and dispersal, persecution and discrimination, all of which have<br />
contributed to a substantial denial for Aborigin~ ils of the right<br />
and mteans to live their lives according to their own values.<br />
one measure which will make, I believe, a significant contribution<br />
to restoring pride and justice to Aboriginals is the Northern<br />
Territory Land Rights legislation. This Act, which closely<br />
follows the recommendations of Mr Justice Woodward's Land Rights<br />
Commission) recognises the fact that the cultural identity and<br />
lifestyle of Aboriginal communities is inextricably bound<br />
up with their land. The Government will, in the next few weeks, </p>
<p>be taking further legislative action to ensure that title to<br />
Aboriginal reserves in the Northern Territory will pass to<br />
Aboriginal land trusts in the very near future.<br />
On the matter of Aboriginal communities on Mornington Island and<br />
at Aurukun, I should say that the Minister for Aboriginal<br />
Affairs, Ian Viner, will be reporting to Cabinet later<br />
today on his recent visit there. I can assure you the Government<br />
has taken very seriously the recent developments at Auri~ kun<br />
and Mornington Island, and we will be giving the highest priority<br />
at Cabinet today to consideration of the Minister's report.<br />
The Commonwealth has a Constitutional obligation to Aboriginals.<br />
These communities have turned to us. We will not fail them.<br />
We are taking other steps too, which will help translate<br />
self-management into reality. We are developing plans for<br />
a National Training Programme so that Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander communities can develop the necessary skills to manage<br />
effectively their community's affairs. We are examining the need<br />
to increase the number of Aborigd~ nal heath workers as a means<br />
of providing Aboriginal communities with more effective health<br />
care services. we are proceeding with a programme of community<br />
based health services. We are employing Aboriginal administrators<br />
for the most successful trachoma eradication programme under which<br />
so far more than 60,000 persons have been examined a programme<br />
which, I am glad to say, is to resume shortly in Queensland.<br />
More funds are being allocated in helping Aboriginals in the<br />
prevention and control of alcohol abuse. The National<br />
Employment Strategy for Aboriginals announced last year is<br />
assisting Aboriginals in remote areas to find work. The<br />
National Aboriginal Education Committee which we have established<br />
is providing a range of expertise in this area of education and<br />
a special understanding of Aboriginal needs and problems<br />
in education.<br />
In all these areas there is one unavoidable fact that must be<br />
faced. Because of generations of neglect and discrimination<br />
against Aboriginals in education, health, employment and housing,<br />
it will take a long term effort to overcome all the present<br />
disadvantaged. It will require persistence and determination<br />
for all Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal who are genuinely<br />
concerned about Aboriginal welfare to see that present hopes and<br />
initiatives are transformed into reality.<br />
Thfis Conference has the opportunity and indeed the responsibilityto<br />
provide to Government a significant input in the planning and<br />
implementation of policies and programmes which affect Aboriginals<br />
and Torres Strait Islanders. I believe this can be done in a<br />
spirit of goodwill and cooperation on all sides. </p>
<p>4.<br />
Throughout all our work together we must never forget that any<br />
policy based on the superiority of one race over another is<br />
a policy doomed to failure. Just as the Government's<br />
policies towards Southern Africa are founded on this fundamental<br />
principle so in Australia we must achieve nothing less than<br />
real equality of all Australians equality of rights, equality<br />
of opportunities, equality of protection under the law.<br />
Madame Chairman, I have much pleasure in formally declaring the<br />
first annual meeting of the National Aboriginal Conference open, and<br />
Iwish you well in the deliberations you have ahead during the<br />
next few days. </p>
