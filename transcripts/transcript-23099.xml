    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government will provide $1 million to the White Ribbon campaign to help reduce violence against women, particularly in culturally and linguistically diverse communities.</p>
<p>For the past decade White Ribbon Day has been working to stop violence against women through education, preventative programs, partnerships and creative campaigns.</p>
<p>The Government is committed to doing all it can to stop any form of violence against women.</p>
<p>One in three Australian women over the age of 15 has reported experiencing physical or sexual violence at some point in their lives.</p>
<p>The $1 million funding announced today will expand the activities of the White Ribbon campaign with a particular focus on new and emerging culturally and linguistically diverse communities across Australia.</p>
<p>This commitment builds on our plans to ensure the <em>National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and Children 2010-2022 </em>is implemented.</p>
<p>I am proud to be one of nearly 2,200 White Ribbon Ambassadors across Australia working to create a cultural shift that leads to the end of violence against women.</p>
