    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>Long ago, my next guest decided that he wanted to be a writer.</p>
<p>   Somehow he ended up a lawyer, he hasn't practiced for many</p>
<p>   years. At High School, he failed maths and yet somehow became the</p>
<p>   Federal Treasurer. His passion has always been cricket, yet the</p>
<p>   best he could ever do was get 6 wickets for 56 for a Methodist Church</p>
<p>   side against the Catholics at the local park. Now despite all those</p>
<p>   setbacks he was probably enough of a cock-eyed optimist to believe</p>
<p>   that he has had a fortunate life. Would you please welcome John</p>
<p>   Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Are you spilling my bowling average again are you?</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Oh I'm sorry, I want to see the results of that too. But I</p>
<p>   just thought I might show you today's Sydney Morning Herald,</p>
<p>   this morning's, it's got a plug for you on this programme</p>
<p>   tonight with a photograph. I just want to clear this up. It says</p>
<p>   "I bet you a million bucks the words tax plan get a guernsey</p>
<p>   tonight". Now, can we get a commitment that they won't?</p>
<p>   We might split the million bucks. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We could share it with them.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Share it with everybody. Okay, a million dollars. Because you know</p>
<p>   journalists can be trusted, and they can be taken at their word.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Absolutely. It's always been my uniform experience.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Do journalists tell more lies than politicians?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh now that's one of those, to use the old language : ÂHave</p>
<p>   you stopped beating your wife?', sort of questions. </p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Was Graham Richardson honest when he said politicians lie?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They don't all lie. Some do. Some don't. And there are</p>
<p>   some honest ones on both sides, and my experience has been that</p>
<p>   most people who go into public life are very dedicated, and not</p>
<p>   all of them, but most of them are, and I've got to stick up</p>
<p>   for the profession and say that they are unfairly maligned on a</p>
<p>   lot of occasions and I've found a lot of dedicated people in</p>
<p>   the Labor Party, and I've found a lot of dedicated people in</p>
<p>   my Party. So I think we get a rough trot on occasions but I don't</p>
<p>   expect any sympathy for that.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Well, Kim Beazley says...Well, you won't get any I'm</p>
<p>   sure.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I won't get any.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Kim Beazley said here last week that he loves politics, he loves</p>
<p>   the profession of politics.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I do too. That's why I've stayed in for 24 years.</p>
<p>   If you didn't love it you'd run a hundred miles from it,</p>
<p>   because it is so intensely personal, your activities get scrutinised,</p>
<p>   criticised, dumped on, and you really do have to have a passion</p>
<p>   for it to stay with it.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>But you are probably hated, we mentioned journos. You are probably</p>
<p>   hated, as much as journalists, if not more, and used car salesmen.</p>
<p>   Why would you love something when people hate you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I guess there is a certain adrenalin in it, and can I say you do</p>
<p>   get a buzz out of doing something that you think is good for the</p>
<p>   country. Now, I think...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's sounds twee when people say that but...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it does sound... it does. But can I say that I felt tremendous,</p>
<p>   although it was a tragic circumstance, but I felt tremendous about</p>
<p>   getting that uniform gun ban, because I really felt that if I did</p>
<p>   nothing more I would have made Australia a safer place particularly</p>
<p>   for women and children.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>I agree, I think you did. Do you still get to the mirror and shave</p>
<p>   in the morning and say "Good morning Mr Prime Minister"?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I still scratch myself and wonder. I mean, it is a tremendous</p>
<p>   ... it is one of the terrific things about this country, I mean,</p>
<p>   I had an ambition when I was young to go into public life, but it</p>
<p>   is still possible if you pour your heart into something in this</p>
<p>   country to get it. And it's not a country built on privilege</p>
<p>   or wealth, which is one of the tremendous things about it, and makes</p>
<p>   it different from any other country in the world and it really is</p>
<p>   one of the things that makes it the most fantastic place in which</p>
<p>   to live. It really is. I still have a great sense of excitement</p>
<p>   that I had the privilege of becoming Prime Minister of this country.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>But if someone shouts out Prime Minister, you now look around,</p>
<p>   you don't look for someone else?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I've got to that. They often shout out other things too</p>
<p>   but....</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>When was the last time you mowed the lawn or fixed a fuse?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, it would have been two-and-a-half years ago, just before I</p>
<p>   became Prime Minister.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I used to mow the lawn quite regularly at our place in Wollstonecraft.</p>
<p>   I wasn't too good on fuses, Janette is much better on fuses.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>You said 15 years ago when you were leader of the Opposition, you</p>
<p>   said, if I had to make the stark choice between politics and family,</p>
<p>   I'd have no hesitation in putting the family first. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, that's right.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Have you been able to maintain that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I have. I mean, I'm very very lucky that I've got</p>
<p>   an affectionate family. The best thing that has happened to me was</p>
<p>   my family. I was lucky with my mother and father, they are long</p>
<p>   dead, but I was very lucky with them and I was very lucky with the</p>
<p>   woman I married and we've had three fantastic children and</p>
<p>   I'm really just so grateful. I mean, I feel on occasions as</p>
<p>   though I've almost had too much in life to have had that wonderful</p>
<p>   family and also to have had the privilege of becoming Prime Minister.</p>
<p>   You sort of feel a bit giddy with it. But I really have been very</p>
<p>   lucky. My kids and my wife have been very supportive of me and they've</p>
<p>   kept me going when I've sort of felt battered and bruised and</p>
<p>   unwanted and they still do. They are the greatest people in the</p>
<p>   world.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Well, did you face that choice when Janette had cancer?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, no. Like any other husband I was terrified when I found out</p>
<p>   Janette had cancer.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Was that the scariest thing that's ever happened?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes. I mean, I was petrified. And I now know what millions of</p>
<p>   my fellow countrymen and women go through. I mean, a lot of people</p>
<p>   go through this experience but she's a tremendously gutsy person</p>
<p>   with a wonderful spirit, and I mean, she never said well John you'll</p>
<p>   have to give up politics.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>But she'd say the opposite, she would ....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Quite the reverse. It would have been the last thing that she would</p>
<p>   have said but I mean, I was obviously distracted from anything else</p>
<p>   for a few days.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Did you cry?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, of course I did. Of course I did. And so did my children,</p>
<p>   of course. I mean, you would. You're human. She's the</p>
<p>   most special person in the world to me and we got through it, and</p>
<p>   she's got tremendous spirit and guts and determination and</p>
<p>   it happens, it could happen to anybody. Anybody. I mean illness</p>
<p>   has no ... it cuts a swathe through everybody and good health</p>
<p>   is an asset....</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>But she would have known, as you knew, that you've spent at</p>
<p>   least 20 years heading towards being Prime Minister. You've</p>
<p>   got the job for three or four months and suddenly the crisis hits.</p>
<p>   At that stage, you are not lucky are you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, but I'm lucky that she's come through as well. And</p>
<p>   we are all lucky that we were close, and when you have a crisis</p>
<p>   like that, the thing you most need is the love and support of the</p>
<p>   people nearest and dearest to you and that's what she had.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Was there a moment in those four or five days John in which you</p>
<p>   thought, I have no choice, I really have to concentrate on her and</p>
<p>   forget..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look of course there was. I really, for a period of time there</p>
<p>   I was, it was very hard to focus on other things. I think people</p>
<p>   understood that. Fortunately, the operation was successful and it</p>
<p>   ... it's really good now, and we are very grateful for the</p>
<p>   hospital, it was a great, you know the King George V hospital in</p>
<p>   Sydney, a very very fine hospital who did a fantastic job, and a</p>
<p>   very good surgeon. </p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Is that a time that you feel regrets or even guilt about the fact</p>
<p>   that all the time... almost like when you lose parents, all the</p>
<p>   time you've spent away, all the time in Canberra, all the birthdays</p>
<p>   you missed, all the sports events you didn't go to?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, believe it or not you can if you organise yourself properly,</p>
<p>   you can still spend an enormous amount of time with your family</p>
<p>   in politics. And I think it is a question of organising your time.</p>
<p>   I gave myself a couple of golden rules when I went into Parliament.</p>
<p>   One of them was that I would ring my family twice a day. One of</p>
<p>   my colleagues at that time Peter Nixon, gave me that advice, and</p>
<p>   I stuck to it and it worked.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Have you done it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I've really stuck to it, and Niko said to me, and he'd</p>
<p>   entered Parliament at a very similar age and his children where</p>
<p>   the same and I asked him for advice, and he said one of the things</p>
<p>   that you ought to do is ring twice a day and he said if you say</p>
<p>   you are going to be home for something, be there. Because what children</p>
<p>   remember is when you don't turn up when you say you will turn</p>
<p>   up. It's the disappointment that children remember rather than</p>
<p>   the number of days that you may be home, or the number of nights,</p>
<p>   but if you've promised a child that you are going to do something</p>
<p>   and you don't do it, they remember that.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>So you were there for all their births?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I was present for all of their births. Yes.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Tell me.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah I was.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>I know but...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's true!</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>I don't doubt it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You know, I've asked.... Each of them would verify it.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>The first one though. The birth of your daughter. I mean was that....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh it was fantastic. It was a great experience. It's a huge</p>
<p>   experience. I mean, I was a ... I guess it wasn't done so</p>
<p>   frequently Â Melanie is now 24 Â then, as it is a commonplace</p>
<p>   thing now, but because in my parents' age I mean....</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>The old man would have ....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh he was a mile away. I mean, I remember, I sort of let slip to</p>
<p>   my mother at the time that I'd done it, and she was sort of</p>
<p>   horrified because when I was born, and I was the youngest in the</p>
<p>   family, that sort of thing just didn't happen.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Was it love at first sight with you and Janette?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I was very struck, yes, I suppose you'd call it that.</p>
<p>   I thought she was fantastic and we got married within one year.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>What, no chance to let her shoot through?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I thought I was pretty lucky.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>What was the attraction?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>She was very good looking and she had a great personality and we</p>
<p>   got on like a house on fire.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Had she been a member of the Labor Party would you have married</p>
<p>   her?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh I'd have converted her.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Hang on. You'd have converted her?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>She probably would have converted... no, that would never have</p>
<p>   happened!! I don't think we would have. Janette's a very</p>
<p>   very strong willed person and I'd have...</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>You've explained that... there was a headline here John,</p>
<p>   I mean, obviously if she didn't .... You would be sitting</p>
<p>   here as a member of the ALP today.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No that would never happen.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>All right simple question. Simple question. Have you ever been</p>
<p>   drunk?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. </p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>You dropped your head then a bit.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Not often, but I have. I have to confess I have, but...</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Are you a good drunk or a bad drunk?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm a happy one.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>You talk a lot about the family unit, about the average Australian</p>
<p>   family. What is that John?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there's no one sort of numerical sequence in number</p>
<p>   that's an average family. But I mean, people think of it as</p>
<p>   Mum and Dad and children, but it is not just Mum and Dad. I mean,</p>
<p>   there are a lot of people who experience broken marriages and relationships</p>
<p>   and there are Mums left on their own or Dads left on their own to</p>
<p>   bring up children. They are all families. I think it is the best</p>
<p>   environment for children to be brought up is still a stable two</p>
<p>   parent family where there is both a role model in the mother and</p>
<p>   a role model in the father.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Does it matter if they are married?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it helps. I mean, I am a great believer in marriage. I'm</p>
<p>   not a person who sort of lays down moral guidelines on other people</p>
<p>   but I think there should always be a margin for marriage in our</p>
<p>   community. I think the sense of public commitment between two people</p>
<p>   adds to the sense of security and love and stability for the children.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>We're reaching the stage of course where almost half the population</p>
<p>   couples are not married. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's not... that percentage is not as high where</p>
<p>   there are children. There are a lot of people who marry when they</p>
<p>   decide to have children. I think they see the extra public commitment</p>
<p>   as being desirable and providing a greater sense of security. And</p>
<p>   these things are questions of balance but the best thing you can</p>
<p>   do for your children is to give them love and security and if there</p>
<p>   is some kind of more formal commitment that often helps, but I accept</p>
<p>   that unmarried parents can be very good and very loving.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>If your daughter said Ralph and I are moving in together, we are</p>
<p>   in love, we are not going to get married, we're living together</p>
<p>   Â would you care?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I guess I'm of an age where I would think about it a</p>
<p>   bit, but my love for her would be so great that if she were happy,</p>
<p>   I'd be happy. I mean, I'd want for her to be happy. And</p>
<p>   I mean...</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>And if Ralph....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Who is this Ralph?</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Oh, you haven't heard of Ralph?</p>
<p>But if Ralph had an earring through his nose and tattoos and orange</p>
<p>   hair....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think there's a fair possibility she wouldn't bring</p>
<p>   him home.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Well, let's say what about if one of your two sons said, Dad</p>
<p>   I'm moving in with Ralph. I'm gay.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, once again I'd be disappointed, and having sort of observed</p>
<p>   them and who they bring home, I think it is very unlikely, but nonetheless....</p>
<p>   But I would be disappointed, but that wouldn't stop me loving</p>
<p>   them, or stop them...</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Because their life would be a little more difficult.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think it is just a combination of circumstances.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>How about those who say at the moment, you are a racist. Is there</p>
<p>   anything worse than that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, those sort of comments have hurt me a lot. This is a criticism</p>
<p>   that I should have said this or that about Mrs Hanson, this silly</p>
<p>   idea that if I had made one definitive speech two years ago she</p>
<p>   would have been knocked out of the ring and carried off and that</p>
<p>   was the end of it is ridiculous.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>But that tag racist, I mean, there's nothing really more offensive</p>
<p>   is there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, some people have said that, and I find that very offensive,</p>
<p>   I mean, and other people come along and say look, you know, he's</p>
<p>   not a racist Â but Â now that's ... that doesn't</p>
<p>   fool me either.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>You mentioned "when did you stop beating your wife" line</p>
<p>   at the start. How do defend that? If someone comes along and says</p>
<p>   ....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I suppose I can just hope that people understand that my,</p>
<p>   the character of my life and the association that I've built</p>
<p>   with people of all different races and backgrounds and the tolerance</p>
<p>   that I practise. I mean what really matters is how you live your</p>
<p>   life not a particular label that's put on you, but those sort</p>
<p>   of labels can be hurtful and I have found that one, and still do,</p>
<p>   deeply offensive because I don't have a racist bone in my body</p>
<p>   and I do find that extraordinarily offensive and it is against everything</p>
<p>   that I've always sort of believed about the equality of men.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Are you proud of the fact that you are almost on the other side</p>
<p>   of the fence or the track from your standard Liberal Leader, the</p>
<p>   fact you not only come from Sydney, which is unusual for the Liberal</p>
<p>   Party, but also you didn't come from money, you didn't</p>
<p>   come from old blue blood...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And I'm the only Liberal Prime Minister of Australia to have</p>
<p>   gone to a Government school.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>Are you proud of that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I am. Not that I'm against independent schools. I've</p>
<p>   sent my three children to independent schools at a secondary level.</p>
<p>   I sent them to government schools at a primary level and I went</p>
<p>   to a government high school in Sydney and I'm quite proud of</p>
<p>   it, it was a good school, but I think there is a lot of very good</p>
<p>   schools in the independent system and the ones we've sent our</p>
<p>   kids to have been, we've been very happy with that education.</p>
<p>   But I think what it demonstrates is that we have a, how the Liberal</p>
<p>   Party is very, and I don't want to get political on a programme</p>
<p>   like this but how the Liberal Party is quite diverse and different.</p>
<p>RAY MARTIN:</p>
<p>How about the cartoonists, the comedians, the columnists who have</p>
<p>   been punching you up for 20 years. Do you listen to them, do you</p>
<p>   take any note, does it hurt?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
