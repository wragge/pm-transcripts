    <content><![CDATA[<p>Agreement has been reached with the United States that Australia will</p>
<p> contribute a unit from the Special Air Services Regiment and two Boeing</p>
<p> 707s for transport/air-to-air refuelling to support the international</p>
<p> coalition against Iraq being formed in the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>The National Security Committee of Cabinet has this afternoon approved</p>
<p> the deployment of these ADF elements to the Gulf. The contingent will</p>
<p> depart tomorrow in order to prepare themselves for participation in</p>
<p> coalition military operations should that prove necessary.</p>
<p>Discussions are continuing on the possibility also of providing specialists</p>
<p> for back up in medical and technical support roles.</p>
<p>The Government continues to hope that force will not be needed. We</p>
<p> strongly support diplomatic efforts to persuade Iraq to comply fully</p>
<p> with UN Security Council resolutions requiring it to dismantle its</p>
<p> chemical and biological weapons programmes and allow inspections.</p>
<p>There is still time for Iraq to reconsider.</p>
<p>The decision to deploy the contingent is not a decision to commit</p>
<p> our forces to active operations. Such a decision would be made only</p>
<p> if it became clear that resort to force remained the only option.</p>
<p>The decision to deploy now has been made to ensure that our contingent</p>
<p> has the maximum opportunity for training, familiarisation and acclimatisation.</p>
<p>The Australian contingent will remain under Australian national command</p>
<p> and will be placed under operational control of the coalition commander</p>
<p> for agreed tasks.</p>
<p>I welcome New Zealand's announcement that it will contribute</p>
<p> an SAS unit and two Orion reconnaissance aircraft to the coalition</p>
<p> and we are discussing with New Zealand ways in which our contingents</p>
<p> can work together.</p>
<p>The decision to commit forces is a difficult one which the Government</p>
<p> would have preferred not to have to face. But we cannot ignore the</p>
<p> threat to stability posed by Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons</p>
<p> of mass destruction and his flouting of the United Nations.</p>
