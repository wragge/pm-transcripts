<p><br />JOURNALIST: MrÂ HawkeÂ are we in a recession?</p>
<p>PM;, Well, technically, no and I'm not trying to avoid your<br />question. The economists' definition of a receasion is when<br />you have two quarters in succession of negatve growth.<br />We're not in that position but I don't avoid theÂ fact that<br />there are economic problems for a lot of people. But as<br />I've explained in the Parliament as I think is understood by<br />the people. We have not deliberately tried to create a<br />hardship for Australia but there's a simple statistio which<br />must be understoodÂ it's not complex economio jargon. in<br />the last year we increated, as a notion, we increased our<br />expenditure by 8 per cent. We only increased our production<br />by four per oent. We made up for that four per O* nt gap by<br />just borrowing from overseas people from their savings to<br />finance our extra consumption. Now you can't go on doing<br />that. So we had to slow down the level of Australia's<br />activity so we could cope because if we hadn't done it<br />ourselves the rest of the world would have done it for us in<br />a very vioious way. Now I think people know Bob Hawke over<br />all these yeare. He's not one who trie to hurt. He trie<br />to help. We had to do that because if we hadn't done that<br />the world would have done much worse things. So we've<br />slowed things down and now we're reaching a point where our<br />Imports are tolling and our production Is greater then our<br />consumption. Now</p>
<p><br />JOURNALIST; Prime Minister</p>
<p><br />PM: Now just a minute. NOw that's what had to be achieved.Â We've done that and I think therefore as we go into 91 weÂ will see the recovery take place in a sustainable way.</p>
<p><br />JOURNALIST: Prime Minister last night the Australtan dollarÂ fell through US77 cents, Will this Impaot on fuel pricesÂ and therefore the CPI?</p>
<p><br />PM: It's Impossible to predict because what's happened to<br />international oil prices is quite remarkable. Let me justÂ give you a couple of figures which will show what I mean.<br />Before the Gulf crisis the price of oil was US$ 20 a barrel.<br />it moved gradually up and then it jumped to over 840 aÂ barrel between a week and two weeks ago. Now it's down toÂ about 36 and we can't make any decisions at a point where<br />it's moving So unpredictably and when we're not sure what'sÂ going to happen in the Gulf. What we all hope in that the<br />crisis will soon end. In those circumstances, you know, we<br />will get back to normality in petrol pricing. It just would<br />be irresponsible to make a decision at this point on that<br />issue.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:Â Â How strong will the recovery be, Mr Hawke?</p>
<p><br />PM: What we've got to do for some time, as a nation, is toÂ make sure that our increase in production is above our<br />increase in consumption. But I think we're capable of doing<br />that. We haven't had the collapse in the employment market<br />that oharacterisad the 82-83 period. I want to see that we<br />can continue the reoord employment growth. Not necessarily<br />S at the same rate. In this period of office we've created<br />1.6 million new jobs. Ninety per cent of them in the<br />private sector. That's been e rate of job creation more<br />than twice as fast as the rest of the world. That's been<br />great for Australia and I want to see us retaining<br />employment growth as we go into 91 and through 92. 1 think<br />we'll do that but we mustn't as a nation think again that we<br />can just go on consuming, through private consumption and<br />investment, we can't consume more than we produce. That's a<br />discipline as a nation that we have to keep upon ourselves.</p>
<p><br /><strong>JOURNALIST</strong>:Â inaudible.</p>
<p><br />PMt Just a minute. One at a time. I'll get to yours.</p>
<p><br /><strong>JOURNALIST</strong> What are your expectations though in terms ofÂ growth and employment growth in the next six months?</p>
<p><br />P14: We think that the GDP for 91 will be positive. As to<br />Just precisely what the level of growth will be you just<br />can't now, in these volatile oircumstencea, put a precise<br />figure upon it because since we framed the budget you've got<br />the Gulf crisis-. That does introduce uncertainties. We<br />believe that growth will be positive for the year and<br />employment growth with It will be positive. We have saoid<br />that there might be some increase in unemployment but that<br />employment will remain positive. You had a question here.</p>
<p><br /><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong> The recovery, Prime Minister, are you saying itÂ will happen in the new year or at the beginning of the nextÂ financial year'?</p>
<p><br />P14: I'm saying that it will happen as we go into 91. ItÂ will happen during 91 in my judgment.</p>
<p><br /><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong> Well that appoers to be at odds with what youÂ maid to the Business Council last night</p>
<p><br /><strong>PM: </strong>Â I know what I said. I mean I was the one who said it.Â You'll see that it's not at odds.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST</strong>:Â Ig the Deputy Governor of the Reserve BankÂ wrong when he says parts of the economy are in a deepÂ recession?</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> No. Of course he's not. I mean the economy is made upÂ of parts and if you look at the rural sector there are partsÂ of the rural sector which are In very deep problems. meanÂ you take the wool industry and the wheat sector. They are<br />in very deep problems. Sacause In those circumstances,Â overwhelmingly, because of the collapse of internationalÂ prices. No-one can deny it. We've asserted it. We've metÂ with representatives of the National Farmers Federation and<br />the Grains Council. We tecognise, for instance, that thoseÂ sectors are in v ary deep problems.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong> 1f we're not trusting though the two terms ofÂ negative growth as a definition for recession, I mean, howÂ should we be defining it then?</p>
<p>PM I didn't * e8y you don't aooept that. Where did you getÂ that question from?</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong> Why ore you and the Treasurer reluctant to useÂ the word recession?</p>
<p><strong>PM: </strong>It's not a question of reluctance. I mean, I've got upÂ in the Parliamenr] t and said I don't resist the definition.Â The definition which is accepted by the economists. I meanÂ I don't run the economics profession. That In the technicalÂ definition of two successive terms of negative growth. ThatÂ hasn't ooourred. Z don't hide behind that technicalÂ definition to say that no we haven't got problems. We haveÂ and I've said that in the Parliament. But the point I'mÂ making, and which has got to be understood, is if we hadn'tÂ taken the action deliberately that we have with tight fiscalÂ policy, tight wages polioy and tight monetary policy to slowÂ the eoonomy down, as we now have, then the rest of the worldÂ would have imposed a much worse solution upon us.</p>
