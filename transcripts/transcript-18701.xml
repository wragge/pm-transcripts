The Australian Government today welcomed the formal start of transition to Afghan-led security responsibility in Uruzgan province, where the majority of Australian military personnel in Afghanistan are based.  </p>
<p>Australia's Ambassador to Afghanistan attended a ceremony held by the Afghan Government today in the provincial capital of Tarin Kot to mark the beginning of transition. </p>
<p>The start of transition in Uruzgan reflects the progress made by Afghan, Australian and International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) military and civilian teams in training and mentoring the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and strengthening security and development.  </p>
<p>It is a welcome sign transition in Uruzgan is on track for completion over the next 12 to 18 month period.  Australia has played a key role in readying Uruzgan for transition.  </p>
<p>Australia's Mentoring Task Force and Special Operations Task Group have worked closely with their Afghan and ISAF counterparts to improve security and build the capacity and confidence of the ANSF.</p>
<p>Australia's civilian efforts in Uruzgan have also played an important role through the funding of infrastructure upgrades, improving local governance and helping provide better access to education and health care as part of the Provincial Reconstruction Team.</p>
<p>Australia will continue to work closely with our Afghan and ISAF partners in Uruzgan during the transition period so the ANSF can assume full security responsibility at the end of transition.   </p>
