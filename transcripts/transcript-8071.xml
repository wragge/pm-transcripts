PRIME MRAINISTE<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, HOTEL ROSSI, VANUATU<br />
31 JULY 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you tell us about your meeting with Mr<br />
Namilau this morning?<br />
PM: I can tell you something about it. Obviously there<br />
were some parts of our conversation which<br />
confidential between us. But I covered a range of<br />
matters with him as he did with me. We talked about<br />
issues that are peculiarly within the province of Papua<br />
New Guinea. We talked about some bilateral matters and<br />
we talked about some regional matters. As far as the New<br />
Guinea area was concerned, Papua New Guinea, obviously<br />
Bougainville took up a fair amount of our time. I<br />
clearly can't go to all the details of that. He was kind<br />
enough to give me the most up-to-date information about<br />
the talks on the New Zealand naval ships. May I take<br />
this opportunity in front of this media gathering to pay<br />
again, as I have before, my tribute to the Government of<br />
New Zealand for providing this facility. I obviously<br />
can't go to what he told me in detail about that, but<br />
what is clear to me is that the Government of Papua New<br />
Guinea is committed to trying to make these talks work.<br />
But it's going to take two to tango. There's got to be<br />
an equal commitment on the part of the representatives<br />
from Bougainville. As I understand it the<br />
representatives from Bougainville put fairly specific<br />
positions to the representatives of the Government of<br />
Papua New Guinea yesterday. They will be responded to by<br />
the Government of Papua New Guinea today. I hope that<br />
there may be some possibility of the talks continuing to<br />
a successful conclusion but on the basis of what I know<br />
so far it's a very difficult situation there in those<br />
talks. But I can't go any further than that. On other<br />
matters, I discussed with the Prime Minister, the<br />
decisions that have been recently made by the<br />
international community to provide additional financial<br />
facilities and economic assistance to the Government and<br />
indicated that we had been pleased to be able to be<br />
identified with that. The Prime Minister expressed<br />
confidence that they would be able to overcome their<br />
economic difficulties at the same time acknowledging that<br />
this was not an easy road in front of them and there had<br />
to be an appropriate exercise of restraint within Papua<br />
New Guinea if they were going to meet that objective. We </p>
<p>discussed my visit to Papua New Guinea which will take<br />
place at the beginning of September which I'm looking<br />
forward to. And I'm going to have the opportunity of<br />
getting out of Port Moresby and having a visit around the<br />
country with the Prime Minister. I'm looking forward to<br />
that very much. He also asked me to talk with him about<br />
the situation in New Caledonia and I was able to share<br />
specific thoughts with him about that, as with the<br />
question of Johnston Atoll. So without being exhaustive,<br />
that's the range of the matters that was dealt with.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, was there also some discussion of<br />
specific help Australia might give in rehabilitating<br />
Bougainville once some sort of consensus is reached?<br />
PM: No, we didn't go to that because the Prime Minister<br />
knows that we have a very real interest in trying to see<br />
that matter resolved. He knows that if they are able to<br />
reach a peaceful resolution of this matter that we will<br />
stand ready within the general framework of our<br />
assistance to Papua New Guinea to be of assistance there.<br />
But the real immediate issue is getting a resolution and<br />
that's not easy.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you now expect the<br />
meeting you hope to have with Ratu Mara tomorrow to go<br />
ahead or has Australia's description of the new Fiji<br />
constitution as being ' seriously flawed' led to the<br />
possibility of Fiji cancelling these talks?<br />
PM: Well I don't know at this stage. All I've had<br />
reported to me is some suggestion that the Prime Minister<br />
may not wish to have those talks. That has not been<br />
conveyed to me. I haven't yet had the opportunity of<br />
speaking to him. I was going to try and take an<br />
opportunity at the morning tea break but others were<br />
speaking with the Prime Minister and it wasn't, I didn't<br />
have a courteous opportunity to speak with him. I want<br />
to do that if I can today. So I really haven't got any<br />
more comment to make on it at this point. I've heard<br />
these alleged reports that they don't want to meet. I<br />
don't know that that is the position. I probably will<br />
know before the end of the day and perhaps when we talk<br />
again subsequently we can therefore talk about it on a<br />
more informed basis.<br />
JOURNALIST: To what extent is Australia and New Zealand<br />
upon Fiji become a little isolated rest of<br />
Melanesia and Polynesia?<br />
PM: Well I don't really know what the relative positions<br />
are between Australia and New Zealand and Polynesian<br />
countries or the Melanesian countries. Because as you'll<br />
appreciate, firstly, Fiji is not on the Forum agenda.<br />
And to this point it certainly didn't arise at the<br />
Retreat nor has it been raised with me by any of the<br />
Forum countries. So to the extent there was any<br />
discussion about this, if there is it will be between the </p>
<p>Fijian Prime Minister and myself. But, as I say in a<br />
previous answer to the question, I'm not really in the<br />
position to be definitive about that at this stage.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on the Johnston Atoll issue,<br />
there's been a lot of argy bargy I guess you'd call it<br />
from various groups, Greenpeace etc. What chances do you<br />
think Australia and New Zealand have of persuading some<br />
of the Pacific Island Countries that it is<br />
environmentally safe?<br />
PM: Let me make this point first. I haven't come here<br />
with a brief that dogmatically I am going to tell the<br />
Forum countries what the right position is. We thought<br />
we had the responsibility, given the fact that we have<br />
available to us a range of scientific capacities which by<br />
definition aren't available to our friends in the Forum,<br />
that we should have this issue examined by these<br />
authorities. Now I want to make it clear that no brief,<br />
no Government brief was given to those authorities to<br />
which we remitted this question. In other words, we<br />
didn't say look, our position as a Government is that we<br />
are in favour of this, give us a report which justifies<br />
that position. These authorities, the CSIRO, and the<br />
Materials Research Laboratory DASET looked at this<br />
without such riding instruction. Therefore my position<br />
is one based on my assessment of what I know to be<br />
objective assessments that have been made by those<br />
authorities. I repeat, and it's very important I know<br />
the Australian journalists will understand that, the way<br />
we operate in Australia but it's very important for<br />
everyone else to understand that that was a position and<br />
is a position. Now I have regarded my responsibility in<br />
coming therefore to this Forum to share with my Forum<br />
colleagues that information. Without going to the detail<br />
of that information, it is information and an assessment<br />
which leads me to the conclusion that taking all factors<br />
into account it is appropriate that the limited proposals<br />
in regard to the Johnston Atoll should proceed. And when<br />
I say limited proposals let's be quite clear what those<br />
limits are. That is that the facilities there should be<br />
used in regard to, firstly, the material which is<br />
currently on Johnston Atoll. Secondly, from the Federal<br />
Republic of Germany. And third any other material that<br />
may still be in the Pacific. And that it is appropriate<br />
that those materials should be disposed of there under<br />
the process which is involved. Now I know that there are<br />
those who have a different view. That's life. It'll be<br />
a question of me putting the material and Mr Palmer<br />
putting his view. I would hope that our colleagues can<br />
be persuaded on the basis of this material. I finally<br />
make the point that as far as Australia is concerned, we<br />
come to this in a rather special situation because I<br />
think it can be said that and I think it is recognised<br />
internationally that no country probably has done more<br />
in the area of trying to have established an<br />
international convention against chemical weapons than<br />
has Australia. Now we've done that in a number of ways. </p>
<p>In the continuing work of the Committee of Disarmament in<br />
Geneva. Secondly with our regional initiative. Thirdly,<br />
very importantly, with the international conference that<br />
was held in Canberra at the end of last year, the first<br />
of its kind, which brought governments and the chemical<br />
industry together. So you can see the basis on which I<br />
say Australia is uniquely involved in this area. Because<br />
we have pushed so hard to get its international<br />
convention the question of the safe destruction of<br />
chemical weapons is for Australia an issue of singular<br />
importance. All our involvement and experience in this<br />
area means, I think you can understand, that we are not<br />
going to bring to this issue some cavalier treatment.<br />
The issue is far too fundamental and of continuing<br />
importance to Australia to do that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Part of the nervousness though concentrates<br />
on whether or not the US will stick to that promise of<br />
not sending their large cache of weapons to Johnston<br />
Atoll once the process is finished. How confident are<br />
you that that's going to be the case?<br />
PM: I'm very confident it will stand. Let me take this<br />
opportunity of being quite dogmatic on this point. We<br />
will be saying to our United States friends that the<br />
position that we're adopting on this matter, and<br />
particularly our espousal of this position within the<br />
Forum, is based upon that proposition that that<br />
commitment will be adhered to. And indeed we have<br />
confidence that it will be. We have no reason to doubt<br />
it because there is the intention to go ahead with the<br />
construction of eight sites in the United States, on<br />
mainland United States. We believe that the United<br />
States would adhere to that position. We will certainly<br />
expect them to.<br />
JOURNALIST: If you're confident about the report, why<br />
not make it public?<br />
PM: Well it may be that that will be done. But I'm<br />
certainly going to make the substance of the reports<br />
available to my friends here in the Forum. We're not<br />
just going to put them in our pocket.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why not make them generally public?<br />
PM: Well, I suppose it's a matter of courtesy really.<br />
If we've got on the agenda with our friends here this<br />
item, I mean it might be the courteous thing to do and<br />
I'm always courteous that they will be made available<br />
to our friends here. The question then of their<br />
publication is a matter we'll look at. I mean speaking<br />
for myself, I don't see any problem about that. But I'll<br />
want to discuss it with some of my colleagues. But I see<br />
nothing to be afraid of in releasing them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are the reports compiled from only US data<br />
or has Australian data been collected as well? </p>
<p>PM: Obviously the US data was very important. But let<br />
me make this point, unless there is any doubt about it<br />
anywhere, that there is a proven competence amongst the<br />
Australian Government's advisers in these areas. In<br />
particular I've referred to the Materials Research<br />
Laboratory. Let me say that that Materials Research<br />
Laboratory is a designated facility by the United Nations<br />
for the analysis and examination of alleged chemical<br />
weapons use. That is the status of that body. The head<br />
of the Laboratory's Protective Chemistry Division, Dr<br />
Peter Dunn, has actually carried out investigations of<br />
chemical weapons use including the question of the<br />
disposal of chemical weapons on behalf of the Secretary-<br />
General of the United Nations. So you can see that<br />
people that have been involved in these analyses and are<br />
making these recommendations are people with a competence<br />
recognised at the highest international level. Let me<br />
say that as well as using the material supplied by the<br />
United States, they also considered material that was<br />
supplied by Greenpeace and by other independent agencies.<br />
Also it wasn't just a question of looking at data but<br />
during their work they had the opportunity to, an<br />
extended opportunity I might say, to review the US<br />
official data and they had the opportunity of questioning<br />
on this matter. So I believe that everything was done<br />
which possibly could be done by these independent bodies,<br />
and I repeat, doing their work without any riding<br />
instructions from the Government.<br />
JOURNALIST: When you say you're going to release the<br />
substance of the reports, does that mean you won't be<br />
releasing the full reports?<br />
PM: Well it may be that we will. All I'm saying is that<br />
at this point I want to have some further discussion with<br />
my colleagues because I don't want just to sit here<br />
unilaterally and say yes that's what will happen. I want<br />
to have some discussion. But I'm simply saying that my<br />
predisposition is towards releasing them.<br />
JOURNALIST: The full reports?<br />
PM: I would think so. I'd need to take some advice and<br />
have some discussion of it but that's my predisposition,<br />
yes. JOURNALIST: What CSIRO comment on the fact that the<br />
environmental impact statement from the US army actually<br />
says that they will not have to comply with the US<br />
Federal Clean Air Act and the US Federal Land<br />
Conservation Act?<br />
PM: All I can say is that, having read the CSIRO report,<br />
it was quite clear that the CSIRO report comes down on<br />
the favour of the proposition that the methods that are<br />
being employed there represent the best of techniques </p>
<p>that are available when, taking all the considerations<br />
into account, it should be supported.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is the Australia-New Zealand position so<br />
identical that you agree with Mr Palmer that you would<br />
eventually like to see that facility disappear so that it<br />
no longer acted as an attraction for people who might<br />
want to dispose of other wastes?<br />
PM: The answer to that question follows from what I said<br />
earlier, that there are three categories of material that<br />
will be involved in the facility at Johnston Atoll. I<br />
repeat, what's on the atoll now, material that's still in<br />
other parts of the Pacific and material from the Federal<br />
Republic of Germany. Our view is that that and no other<br />
should be the subject of the processes there.<br />
JOURNALIST: So does that mean the New Zealand-Australian<br />
positions are identical?<br />
PM: I gather from the discussions that I've had with the<br />
Prime Minister of New Zealand that our positions are<br />
identical. But I'm not here to speak for the Prime<br />
Minister of New Zealand. I think you're going to have<br />
the pleasure of questioning him in about five minutes or<br />
SO. It's appropriate that if you want to know the New<br />
Zealand position you ask the Prime Minister of New<br />
Zealand. JOURNALIST: Within the limitations that you ' ye just<br />
outlined about the use of Johnston Atoll, will you be<br />
pushing for, or seeking to have an expression of support<br />
for that chemical weapons disposal process in the final<br />
Forum communique?<br />
PM: Well it's on the agenda here. I'll be putting my<br />
view as to what I think is the appropriate position.<br />
I'll listen to what my friends in the Forum have to say.<br />
In the light of all the discussion I'll be then, within<br />
the Forum, expressing what I think would be the<br />
appropriate Forum position to be put. We'll see what<br />
happens in the debate about that. But clearly I haven't<br />
come here just to say well that's what we think, and<br />
leave it at that. Because I believe that we have been<br />
given advice which is objective and appropriate as a<br />
position to be adopted. I will be saying that I think<br />
that ought to be the Forum position but I want to hear<br />
what the others have to say.<br />
JOURNALIST: At this stage does it appear that it's just<br />
you and, well you think New Zealand is behind you, do you<br />
think it's just you and New Zealand against the rest of<br />
the Forum members or do you know from discussions that<br />
there are other Pacific Island Countries that support<br />
your view?<br />
PM: Not all the Forum leaders were at the Retreat so I<br />
can't answer that question with precision. I would have </p>
<p>to say on the evidence of the Retreat that there were<br />
question marks and serious question marks being raised by<br />
a significant number of our colleagues. But that was a<br />
very preliminary stage. I haven't had the opportunity of<br />
hearing a detailed exposition of our scientific reports.<br />
So what their view will be at the end of the debate I<br />
really can't say.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did the US ask Australia to assist in<br />
reassuring South Pacific Forum members<br />
PM: There was no specific request to me. I have no<br />
doubt that in the discussions that have taken place at<br />
other levels between officials and so on that there would<br />
have been a view put that they thought that this was the<br />
right position, that they hoped we'd be able to support<br />
it. But I've had no direct request to that effect. I<br />
don't operate on this basis. I mean no-one determines<br />
Australia's position for it. We're not here as an<br />
intermediary for the United States or anyone else. I<br />
make up my mind on the basis of material put before me,<br />
whether it's on this issue or any other that's here, or<br />
like on the discussion that we've had this morning in the<br />
Forum about dialogue partners. I make up my mind on the<br />
basis of what I think is the correct position and then<br />
put that. I'm not here, as I say, as a surrogate for or<br />
an intermediary for anyone.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the question of the move at the Forum<br />
this morning for Taiwan to join the post-Forum dialogue,<br />
do you have a comment on this and does it complicate<br />
Australia's one-China policy?<br />
PM: No, I'm very pleased to say that the position that I<br />
espoused on this is the one that has been embraced by the<br />
Forum. I made the point that I think it's a fundamental<br />
principle of the Forum that the Forum doesn't seek to<br />
impose decisions on its members which can infringe the<br />
foreign policy rights of individual members. The facts<br />
are that as far as the Forum is concerned there are some<br />
countries, like for instance ourselves, New Zealand,<br />
Vanuatu, who recognise one government of China, the<br />
Peoples Republic, mainland China. There are others who<br />
have not adopted that position, as is their right. it<br />
was therefore my judgement, and the view that the Forum<br />
adopted, that it was not appropriate to make a decision<br />
in terms of inviting Taiwan as a dialogue partner which<br />
would in fact impinge upon and derogate from the rights<br />
of individual members. Rather I think they've adopted<br />
the eminently sensible position to say well let this<br />
issue be examined in the next twelve months and<br />
particularly let it be examined in the light of whether<br />
APEC may in fact find some formula which can accommodate<br />
acceptable positions. That seems to me to be the right<br />
approach. It's certainly the one which I advocated.<br />
JOURNALIST: From your knowledge of the American position<br />
on Johnston Island, do you believe that they would be </p>
<p>prepared to reconsider their plans if the Forum didn't<br />
like them or is it a fait accompli?<br />
PM: There are two things that have to be said which are<br />
relevant to that. Firstly that there is a testing period<br />
which has to be followed and we would be and the second<br />
is related to it that I certainly would be advocating<br />
that the Forum send a scientific mission to the facility<br />
to examine it. Let me say this, that if out of that<br />
testing period and the examination of the facility by a<br />
Forum scientific group, if out of those processes any<br />
serious question were to arise as to the adequacy and<br />
safety of the operation of the facility then it would be<br />
right that the Forum, including Australia, should press<br />
strongly on the United States that they should not go<br />
ahead, at least should not go ahead without modification.<br />
That would be Australia's position and I presume it would<br />
be that of the Forum. But whether, I mean they have said<br />
that a) that this testing period is going ahead, and b)<br />
have indicated that they would welcome a Forum scientific<br />
mission. I would expect, as I say, if out of those two<br />
processes serious questions were raised then they should<br />
be asked to consider modifications. I don't believe that<br />
they're going to be doing those two things without some<br />
serious purpose. There's no point in having a testing<br />
period or inviting a scientific mission if you're not<br />
going to allow the possibility emerging out of those<br />
things for some modification.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can I just go back to Bougainville for a<br />
second. I think you mentioned earlier that you saw some<br />
difficulties in the negotiating process. Are you able to<br />
say what those difficulties are that you see and on<br />
balance are you optimistic about<br />
PM: The answer to that Glenn is yes I'm able to but I'm<br />
going to because the information that I have is in<br />
confidence at this stage. It would not be appropriate.<br />
JOURNALIST: You very benevolently last night broke your<br />
London convention to give us a short statement on the<br />
Hogg initiative<br />
PM: It was a very very brief and considered and complete<br />
breaking of it to which nothing is to be added.<br />
JOURNALIST: Not even to give us any indication<br />
PM: Not even to do anything, not even to your<br />
blandishments. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, on the Australian scientific<br />
report, would there have been more benefit if that<br />
assessment was made available to Forum nations earlier,<br />
even if it was only last week, so they would have had<br />
more time to examine the details rather than having to do<br />
it at the Forum itself? </p>
<p>.1 9<br />
PM: I think the nature of the reports are such that they<br />
are capable of analysis and understanding reasonably<br />
quickly. JOURNALIST: New Zealand and Australia take a similar<br />
line on issues such as Johnston Atoll and Fiji even<br />
though it's not on the agenda. Do you think the two of<br />
you run the risk of giving the impression that you're<br />
trying to heavy the rest of the members?<br />
PM: Certainly not. If you were able to hear them for the<br />
way we put our contributions, we don't put them in the<br />
sense of trying to heavy. I mean let me make this point,<br />
as I have before, at previous Forums. Again I don't<br />
speak for New Zealand, that's the right and duty of my<br />
friend Geoffrey Palmer. But let me say this for<br />
Australia. We have a line, a difficult line at times,<br />
that we have to walk. That is we are the largest, most<br />
economically powerful, most resource rich country of the<br />
Forum, and that's acknowledged. And I believe that we<br />
have, that there are great responsibilities that flow<br />
from that fact and not the least of those<br />
responsibilities is the obligation that we have to<br />
provide aid in financial terms, in material resource<br />
terms and in personnel terms to the smaller members of<br />
the Forum. That's in my judgement a responsibility and<br />
obligation that we have. The line we have to walk and<br />
I always try and make sure that that line is adhered to<br />
is in accepting that responsibility and then on the other<br />
side not to think that that gives us some right to impose<br />
our views on the Forum. That's a difficult line but it's<br />
one which from 1983 I've steadfastly and assiduously<br />
tried to walk and I hope successfully.<br />
ends<br />
