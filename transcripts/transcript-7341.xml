CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EKBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
THE HON. R. J. L. HAWKE, AC NP<br />
" AUSTRALIA 1988 AND BEYOND"<br />
CONFERENCE COSPONSORED BY THE ASIA SOCIETY AND TIHE<br />
AMERICAN AUSTRALIAN ASSOCIATION<br />
NEW YORK 20 JUNE 1988<br />
Ladies And Gentlemen,<br />
An early edition of Baedeker the great nineteenth century<br />
travel-guide had this commonsense piece of advice for<br />
visitors to New York:<br />
" Tips are of an appallingly high scale in this city end<br />
must by no means be omitted if efficient attention is<br />
desired. If, however, the traveller does not intend to<br />
visit again, the formality may be omitted."<br />
Well I like New York and I have every intention of paying<br />
future visits here. So I shall follow Baedeker s advice and<br />
not omit the formality of offering a tip in the form of these<br />
after-dinner remarks.<br />
It is good to be back in thia great city, in the middle of<br />
Australia's Bicentennial year.<br />
And it's good to be with the American Australian Association<br />
end the Asia Society which over the years have played a<br />
leading role in helping to develop American understanding of<br />
Australia's part of the world.<br />
To men and women such as you, who follow world events closely<br />
as a matter of habit, the astonishing developments In Asia<br />
over the past quarter of a century will be familiar.<br />
But It is still worth reminding ourselves of the enormous<br />
political and economic transformation thv regfnn hay'<br />
undergonn In that periud. 7: 1 </p>
<p>Where not so long ago, the region evoked in our minds Images<br />
of conflict, di'vision and vulnerability, the words which now<br />
come more readily to mind Arm stAbility, flexibility,<br />
confidence and 9wowth.<br />
Where twenity years ago the We stern Pacif ic region's GDP was<br />
equivalent to ono-th0rd 04 Amnerica's, today it Is over two<br />
thirds of what 1i of rooizse, a much larger US economy.<br />
The Pacific R~ im now contains the world's fastest growing<br />
economies, which export and Import across the Pacific more<br />
than the older aconomies trade across the Atlantic.<br />
That kind of mconomic success hasn't happened by accident.<br />
it has been the result of a de~ liberate determination to adopt<br />
outwaid-looking and extraordinarily adaptable domestic<br />
policies. And l. et mo stress, an absolute prerequisite was a<br />
sympathetic inti~ rnational trading environment.<br />
The expectakion thpt this k~ ind of success will continue<br />
indefinitoly hie -led to confident predictions that the n~ ext<br />
century will Fn ita " 1hAcIfic Century".<br />
Certainly, tho oviderce for the Pacific Century scenario is<br />
easy to see the stronqth and resilience of the Japanese<br />
economy, the floxib) llty and confidence of the newly<br />
industrialising natlins, the steady political and economic<br />
emergence of Chiii. inh tb* world sceno, the tp-establishment,<br />
of democracy In the Philippines, the greater liberalisation<br />
in South lNoien~, tile continmed demonstrAtion of regional<br />
cooperation byf , n ASEAN nntlona not to mention the<br />
incroaxing relianl ' nehntof the Australian economy.. I<br />
Out will thiz tznmendous dyna'nism continue Into the future?<br />
V) 11 those m~ utually reinfoxcing hallmarks, political<br />
9 ability and xwkingj XivIng standa~ rds, continue to benefit<br />
the millions of Asnn0; 7ens who now enjoy thorn?<br />
I an essentielly an T~ tils~ t about the future of our region,<br />
so I answer each of theso 9eitions I~ n the affirmative.<br />
ut I am also n~ reallst and, as a practising politician, I am<br />
fully aw. are tbAt rosy predictions are for from being<br />
sell-fulfiilinp however ro~ ssurlng they may be.<br />
Lo~ st Year X hAd UMe hon0K 09 delive~ ring the Singapore<br />
Lecture. I sold then that to magim~ rse th~ e benefits of<br />
continued economic growth Implicit in the Pacific Century<br />
prediction, wo nust continue to work hard wo must continvue<br />
to pursue with deteicmination and diligence the<br />
outward-looking and adaptable policies which have been the<br />
source of thle rrmqion's 0 ucce. ss so far. </p>
<p>We have MIUCh to be confident about but we should never allow<br />
that confidenco to lapse into complacency.<br />
On the basis oft those general comments let me examine in more<br />
detail the principal developments In the region which will<br />
determine Its nature a5 we enter the next<br />
century particularly in the region's largest nation, China,<br />
and its largest economy, Japan.<br />
I will keep to the end what I consider, with a justifiable<br />
sense of pride,* to be the beat news of all: that Is, the<br />
dramatic way In which Australia over the past five years has<br />
ecoristructed and reoriented itself to participate in the<br />
region's econom~ ic growth, and to provide as well as the<br />
most politically stable an excellent base for Investors<br />
qeekinq to got Involved in the myriad opportunities that the<br />
tegion offers.<br />
Without doubt, some of the most exciting developments In the<br />
Western Pacific are now taking place in China.'<br />
China has emcr~ e4 from the self-destructive madness of the<br />
Cultural Revolution to embark on a path of effective and<br />
Tational modernisation and openness to the outside world.<br />
Viewed from anrf angle political, strategic, commercial,<br />
cultural this is a truly momentous transition.<br />
We in Australip have been following these events closely<br />
* ince the reform process was launched nearly ton years ago.<br />
Indeed we have more than just followed them. We've been<br />
actively engaged In a major and consistent effort to Invpolve<br />
Australia An the closest possible cooperation vithiChins as<br />
It undertakes Its reforms, an effort which the Chinese have<br />
fully reciprocated.<br />
Through the strikingly successful rural reforms of the early<br />
1980., the urban reform decisions of 1901 and the Party<br />
Congress last year, the cumulative achievements are huge In<br />
tcale and significance.<br />
Consider these Indicators:<br />
China's output has more than doubled since the reform<br />
process began.<br />
China is aheed of its announced target of quadrupling<br />
1980 output by the end of the century.<br />
This Is the third 7ear In succession in which Chinese<br />
manufactured exports have grown by a third.<br />
Last year, China became the largest supplier of textiles<br />
to the United States. 713 3 G; </p>
<p>4<br />
Over the last five years, I have been privileged to spend<br />
Very many hours wit hkey figures inl the ChInese leadership.<br />
on that basis, my own assessment is that the process of<br />
reform Is Irreversible.<br />
No-one, least of all the Chinese leadership, expects the path<br />
to modernisatioi in China to be without difficulty.<br />
But the Chinese leadership in unequivocally comjuitted to<br />
strong, sustained outward-oriented economic growth, based on<br />
doziestic economic reform.<br />
Since the sino-British agreement on Hong Kong In 1984 there<br />
has been a spectacular growth in trade between Hong Kong and<br />
mainland China.<br />
Ch Ina has recontly espoused a radical, Internationally<br />
oriented strategy for the dovelopuient. of the coastal<br />
provinces, designed to foster the growth of labour-Intensive<br />
exports using Amported raw materials.<br />
It Is the cloarest signal yet that China Is determined to<br />
reap the full economic potential of close Integration with a<br />
dynamic regior) nl economy.<br />
It is my assessment that# for all the simplistic talk in the<br />
West about liberals verses conservatives in the Chinese<br />
system, there As no opposition to the modernisation process<br />
sufficiently 5trony to derail It.<br />
At! the namn time as we are seeing these radical changes In<br />
China, we are now at another pivotal point In post-war<br />
Japanese history a process of change which despite all-the<br />
dIfferences between the two'economies Is at least ai<br />
Important to the future of the region.<br />
I say that because these changes, driven by Japan's large<br />
external surpluses and the associated rapid appreciation of<br />
the Yen, ar. necessary not just to secure economic and<br />
financial stability In Japan. They are also fundamental to<br />
the very functioning of a viable world trading systom.<br />
Japan's very success in emerging as an economic super-power<br />
has forced it to grapple ag3in with the task of reshaping the<br />
stiucture of Ate economy.<br />
It has already made an impressive start.<br />
For any ono even remotely familiar with Japan's extraordinary<br />
success in exporting goods which have penetrated households<br />
throughout the world, it Is a truly remarkable fact that<br />
domestic demand has now completely replaced exports as the<br />
primary engine of Japan's growth. </p>
<p>This has set In train major changes ih industry composition<br />
in Japan, with greater emphasis on the non-traded sector.<br />
Moreover, Japan is now importing strongly including<br />
importing manufoctured goods.<br />
This has further spurred industrialisation throughout the<br />
region, not least in China and ASEAN a process made<br />
possible by the region's complementary resource endowmonts.<br />
Moreover Japan is increasingly locating its less competitive<br />
industry offshore, directing investment and technology to<br />
more labour-Intensive countries.<br />
The so called Newly Industrialising Countries are<br />
experiencing rising living standards, improved balance of<br />
payments and, in some cases, reduced external indebtedness<br />
largely as a result of their flexible economic approach which<br />
has allowed them to follow the Japanese path to success and,<br />
more recently, to exploit the opportunities Japan's success<br />
has opened for them.<br />
A recent OECD report forecast that next year the contribution<br />
of the HICs to world trade will have increased by half since<br />
1986 and will be virtually as large as Japan's.<br />
Clearly, lito Japan, the nost successful of these cowitries<br />
also have a responsibility to play their part in fostering<br />
sustained growth. Just as flexibility has been the source of<br />
their success, it must remain the hallmark of their economic<br />
policy making.<br />
Specifically, they have the responsibility to promote freer<br />
trade and to allow their exchange rates to reflect 1conom. c<br />
fundamentalsø<br />
Again it Is good to see that there has also been some<br />
progress recently on this front, particularly via the foreign<br />
exchange markets.<br />
In other words, economic reconstruction in Japan is providing<br />
a new Impetus to growth elsewhere in the region.<br />
But Japan still has more to do.<br />
We are already seeing Japan's economic power being translated<br />
into a greater leadership role in international affairs<br />
gernerally. This Is, I believe, a quite legitimate process<br />
and is, in any case, inevitable.<br />
But the immediate test of Japan's capacity to adopt and<br />
maintain a higher profile arises in the economic arena.<br />
Specifically, Japan's leadership role will be tested, and<br />
should be judged, by its willingness to allow greater access<br />
to its domestic market. 7-3 3 8<br />
S. </p>
<p>6.<br />
We are already starting to see a liberalisation of what have<br />
hitherto been very protectionist barriers. There is still a<br />
long way to go, and both of our countries are pressing hard<br />
to speed up the pace of reform. But, as the Maekawa report<br />
showed, the right questions are being asked in Japan and the<br />
right answers are starting to be applied.<br />
In all of these ways, thpn, we face a time In which important<br />
decisions will need to be made in order to secure continued<br />
regional prosperity Into the next century. Across the whole<br />
region, nations of differing levels of economic development<br />
are responding, as they must, in similar ways to similar<br />
Imperatives.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Whether we like it or not, there Is another important actor<br />
in the Asia/ Pacific region the USSR.<br />
We do not have the choice of telling the Soviet Union that it<br />
has no right to develop political and economic relationships<br />
In the region. The real question is whether its interests in<br />
the Pacific are to be pursued constructively or not.<br />
As I said last year, I would welcome a constructive Soviet<br />
Involvement and I emphasise a constructive involvement in<br />
political and economic developments in theAsia-Pacific<br />
region.<br />
For the greetor part of the post-war era, Soviet involvement<br />
In the Western Pacific has rightly been regarded with<br />
suspicion. We must still continue to be cautious. We must<br />
base our judgements on deeds not words. I<br />
Dui I believe that the more rational and creative path<br />
suggested by Hr Gorbachev holds out positive prospects. We<br />
should be prepared to engage In dialogue, and, on the basis<br />
of mutual gelf-interest, explore cooperation with the<br />
Soviets. We Intend to do that.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
According to Mark Twain, In Boston they ask, How much does he<br />
know? In Philadelphia, Who were his parents? But in New<br />
York they ask, how much Is he worth?<br />
to I owo It to you, having reviewed the region, to tell you<br />
what Australia is worth in our Bicuntennial year.<br />
five cr six yeavs ago I as s* re that many of you would have<br />
dovbted Xvsttslia's capaciZy to participate in the brge: manrg<br />
growth of trade in manufactures and services. As a prospect<br />
for direct Investment in those sectors, Australia's worth<br />
might have been rated relatively poorly. " 13 ') 11) </p>

~ Veaent could not sensibly be made today,<br />
Australia has now addresged the major economic Impediments of<br />
five years ago and has done to while also opening out<br />
markets to the dynamism of International trade.<br />
Again, look at the broad Indicators of our performance:<br />
with the cooperation of the trade union movement, real<br />
labour costs have substantially fallen and industrial<br />
disputes have been more than halved;<br />
we are steadily improving work practices and reforming<br />
the education and training systems;<br />
Inflation is now heading back towards 4 1/ 2 per cent or<br />
so by the middle of next year about the same as the<br />
OECD forecasts for the United States;<br />
we have conveited e prospective budget deficit, just<br />
five years ago, of over i per cent of CD3P to a<br />
prospective surplus of about 1 per cent in the coming<br />
fiscal year. By comparison the OECD forecasts the<br />
United States will have reduced Its budget deficit from<br />
just over 5 per cent of CDP to about 3 1/ 2 per cent. go<br />
If I apeak on this visit of what further you need to do<br />
about your deficit as I will I speak from a position<br />
of strength;<br />
In Australia, the deficit has been cut through real cuts<br />
in Government outlays. They will fall by 1. 5, per cent<br />
In the coming year, the third year of real dcIne and<br />
this despite well targeted improvements in programs to<br />
assist the disadvantaged. in line with intern ktional<br />
trends the tax bass has been broadened, and corporate<br />
and personal tax ratos cut;<br />
just lost month the government announced further<br />
measuron to lift australia's economic performance,<br />
including business tax cuts and further tariff reform.<br />
four years from now, effective protection for<br />
manufacturing will have been cut by 30 per cent. future<br />
investm~ ent decisions will not bo tax-driven or<br />
tariff-driven but will be taken In the pursuit of real<br />
economic returns.<br />
For an American a'. dience there may seem to be a number of<br />
paradcxes here.<br />
In the first place, it may seem paradoxical that a Government<br />
like mine, proud of and committed to Its social democratic<br />
goals, should preside over real wage cuts and sweeping<br />
deregulation. 78/ It) </p>
<p>~ ijtro-s--rneulno paradox, because there measures have<br />
been absolutely essential for Australia to build the<br />
foundations of real and sustainable growth, and to maintain<br />
and gradually lift living standards for all Australians.<br />
underpinning our success has been a degree of cooperation<br />
between the Government and the Australian trade union<br />
movement which the M~ anaging Director of the INFO Michel<br />
Candessus, noted recently has added a new element to the<br />
economic policy making mechanisms of Government.<br />
This approach has enabled Australia to address Its manifest<br />
uncompetitiveness of 5 years ago and overcome a subsequent<br />
massive and sharp deterioration in our terms of trade, while<br />
also creating jobs at twice the OECD average rate with So<br />
per cent croated In the private sector. By any standards<br />
that has been quite a treble.<br />
A second apparent paradox may be that a country with a<br />
balance of payments deficit about as large as the United<br />
States, relative to GDP, should cut tariffs as we are doing.<br />
But we havo been working over five years to internationalis.,<br />
the Australian economy: the Aussie dollar is floating;.<br />
exchange control has boon eliminated; foreign Investment<br />
restrictions have been reduced to the minimum; and,<br />
consistent with that approach, protection io being reduced.<br />
The reason In' that we appreciato the potential -gains to<br />
Australia from trade and particularly from greater enseshment,<br />
with our dynoimic region.<br />
We want to cApitalise on the advantages of our geography. . And<br />
that requires the kind of flexible, innovative, expokt<br />
oriented indostry structure which is needed to compete on<br />
equal terms with the world's best manufacturers and service<br />
providers. And we want to give our efficient agriculture and<br />
mining sectors the best possible chance to expand further by<br />
giving than the lowest feasible input costs.<br />
I am pleased to say that we are having considerable success.<br />
Last year, our exports of manufactured goods Increased by<br />
per cent. Over the last five years the share of manufactured<br />
goods in our merchandise exports has risen from 21 per cent<br />
to 26 per c * ent. And, of course, tourism is rapidly growing<br />
as a aaJor expottr earnor in fact at twice the rate of<br />
marviiandiso exportE.<br />
I'ndeed ouv current. account deficit has been cut from over<br />
6 per cent of GDP just 2 yearg ago to 3 1/ 2 per cent or less<br />
ovfir tho neuxt twelve months or so.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, 7834 </p>
<p>In other tords Australia has learned, and is applying, the<br />
lesson behind the apparent miracle of the Western Pacific<br />
region: that is, the growth-generating power of a liberal<br />
trading environment.<br />
It Is not my place tonight to prescribe for the United States<br />
the specific and detailed remedies necessary for it to derive<br />
maximum Lbviitit from the dynamism of our rogion.<br />
But, as one of your closest friends, Australia does have both<br />
the right and, I believe, the obligation to say that it is<br />
clear you have two special responsiDili Les: reduvlivy VuuL<br />
fiscal deficit and seeking faster liberalisation of global<br />
trade.<br />
I am told that thpre RAAm to be a widespread Impression here<br />
at the corporate leadership level that Lbjuzw ate no problems<br />
between the United States and Australia.<br />
Unfortunatqly, aisy such impression ignoros a rol<br />
paradox. No two countries, I think, enjoy a closer alliance<br />
relationship of first class integrity than Australia and the<br />
United States. But that is not mirrored in our trading<br />
relationship.<br />
As I said In Chicago earlier today, Americang must not<br />
underestimate how much your protectionigt actiong directed<br />
against Japan or the European Community in fact destroy the<br />
livelihoods of Auatialian farmers. And thooo aotiona<br />
ultimately limit our prospects, and indeed yours, for growth<br />
and prosperity. The paradox is real and it is hurtful.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
I have outlined Australia's broad program of reform largely<br />
in economic terms. But I would not want it thought that the<br />
task of responding to and implementing change is one Just fo;<br />
the eoonomists among us. Heaven forbidl<br />
Enduring change, genuine Australian enmeshment in Asia,<br />
requires action across the spectrum of Government policy<br />
including some fundamental attitudinal changes by the<br />
Australian people.<br />
It requires the development of an export culture: a<br />
determination to take on the best and win.<br />
It requires learning how to provide foreign tourists with<br />
high quality service and foreign students with excellent<br />
educational resources.<br />
It means working to create a society aiverse in its sialls<br />
and cultures and faiths by maintaining an Immigration progra<br />
thoroughly free of discrimination. 834;-, </p>
<p>It means In other words applying In our homes, our factories,<br />
our boardrooms, our streets and shops the Unavoidable lessons<br />
of the Interdependence which Increasingly characterises our<br />
region and the world.<br />
it would be foolish to pretend that these attitudinal changes<br />
are easily m~ ade, or that long established habits In some<br />
cases, prejudices die quietly.<br />
Australia has traditionally been oriented to Europe and the<br />
United States. In our view of Asia we have not been free of<br />
the ugly taint of racism or xenophobia. But as we prepare to<br />
take up a more active role in Asia, I believe Australians<br />
will be able to leave those attitudes where they belong in<br />
the history books.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
It is especially true that our hopes for economic progress<br />
depend substantially on whether we can continue to live in a<br />
region which Is stable and peaceful.<br />
Australia plays a full and active role in the diplomacy of<br />
the region. We are building our defence self-reliance to<br />
boost our capacity to protect the broad strategic interests<br />
of the West. And we are working to increase our defence<br />
cooperation with our regional friends.<br />
Australia has also shown'its capacity to take the lead where<br />
constructiva and creative action is required. Perhaps most<br />
significantly we helped create the South Pacific Niuclrear Free<br />
Zone. The nationg of the region who support the Zone,<br />
including Australia, do so because it is an important nov<br />
means of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. At<br />
the same tiimeo as the United States recogniseso It Is fully<br />
consistent with Australia's alliance obligations under ANZUS<br />
and your strategic Interests in the region.<br />
I believe we are witnessing a time of enduring progress in<br />
arms control. President Reagan and Ceneral Secretary<br />
Gorbaphev havo established a climate of practical cooperation<br />
which I fully expect will yield further reductions In nuclear<br />
arsenals. It is in this climate that my Government sees merit in<br />
exploring a now step in arms control for the Asia-Pacific<br />
region. This would be a regional effort against chemical<br />
weapons proliferation.<br />
I want to announce that just before leaving Australia I<br />
asked my colleague, Foreign Minister Bill Hayden, to set in<br />
train an examination of how this concept could be developed<br />
and pursued in co-operation with regional countries. </p>
<p>certainly, chemical warfare is an abhorrence. Australia has<br />
very actively supported and contributed to the effort to<br />
establish a Comprehensive Chemical Weapons Convention In the<br />
Committee on Dsarmament In Geneva.<br />
But at the same time we may be able to complement these<br />
global efforts at a regional level.<br />
I know the proposal raises complex Issues. However, I<br />
believe the effort to examine a regional approach can<br />
certainly serve Australia's interests and, more than that,<br />
the interests of the region as a whole.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
In all those ways economically, socially, politically and<br />
in the field of security Australia is credontialled and<br />
equipped as never before to take a constructive role In the<br />
Asian region.<br />
I remember Steinberg's famous New Yorker cartoon which shows<br />
the civilisod world affectlyely grnatnq on the far bank of the<br />
Hudson River.<br />
Shortly past the river, a spare ly " settled desert begins. in<br />
the distant nothingness the words WPacific Ocean' are neatly<br />
pencilled In.<br />
The cartoon showc how large In your eyos the 01g Apple<br />
stands. Faixr enough. You are certainly entitled to that.<br />
But New Yorkers are also known for their hard realism. Wore<br />
a new version of the cartoon to be drawn In 198, I' like to<br />
think that in the place of the distant Pacific nothingness we<br />
would surely see the outlines of Seoul and Shanghai,<br />
Singapore and Tokyo, and also of Sydney and the other<br />
Australian cities which are Increasingly making their<br />
presence felt In the region.<br />
For those centres of economic growth In Asia and the Pacific<br />
will Increasingly nove from the horizon to the foreground.<br />
They must Increasingly command the attention and demand the<br />
Involvement of anyone in America who would help fulfil the<br />
promise, and reap the rewards, of the Pacific Century.<br />
A~ nd, my friends, may I conclude with this proud assertion<br />
by their record of shared commitment In war and In peace to<br />
the defence of freedom and the liberty of the individual, by<br />
the friendship of their two peoples, by the quality and<br />
abundance of their human and material resources, no two<br />
countries are better able, together, to reap those rewards<br />
for themselves and for the people of the region than are our<br />
two groat nations, Australia and the United States. </p>
