FOR MEDIA 2 DECEMBER 1989<br />
I welcome and endorse the positive and speedy response by<br />
President Bush to the request for assistance from<br />
President Aquino.<br />
United States action to help counter the illegal attempt<br />
to overthrow the freely-elected Government of the<br />
Philippines is playing an important part in enabling it<br />
to reassert its authority.<br />
At the end of a year in which democracy has triumphed<br />
through ' people power' in large parts of Eastern Europe,<br />
it would be a tragedy if Philippines democracy fell to<br />
force of rebel arms.<br />
President Aquino has Australia's full support for her<br />
efforts to restore the authority of the duly elected and<br />
properly constituted Government of the Philippines. </p>
