PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT WEDNESDAY, 12 MARCH, 1980<br />
PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED BY VINCENT SMITH, 2UE, SYDNEY.<br />
LIVE, TALK-BACK<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
with me, as my special guest in the studio, is the Prime Minister<br />
of Australia, Mr. Malcolm Fraser. Mr. Fraser, thanks for joining<br />
US. I wanted to, before you arrived in fact I was backgrounding the<br />
situation, it occurs to me that there is a great deal of concern<br />
in the community about the atmosphere of belligerence that builds<br />
up in a situation like this where people are desperate for petrol,-<br />
where people are perhaps going to become more desperate. Does the<br />
Government concern itself with its laws having the effect of<br />
perhaps accelerating that of belligerence?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think a Government is always concerned about belligerence and<br />
confrontation, and would want to avoid it. You cannot always<br />
avoid it. Sometimes the price of avoiding it is just to allow<br />
yourself, or allow the community, to be completely run over.<br />
That is a very high price to pay. Reasonableness is something<br />
that you need somebody to reciprocate. That is not to say that<br />
one party do a dispute cannot or should not be the first to be<br />
reasonable. But, if people get back into the corners in the ring<br />
and are only going to snarl at each other, well, you can get a<br />
very dangerous and unpleasant situation developing. There is no<br />
doubt about that. The Government would be concerned about it.<br />
Vincent Smith-<br />
Would the Government, though, not be prepared to consider amending<br />
a law. Perhaps even a cooling-off period whereby it backed away<br />
from some of the laws which it has been enforcing.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
But it depends on the reason for it. I would like to get at that<br />
in a slightly different way if I could, because there are people<br />
who say that law has got no part in industrial relations, that<br />
this is a question of human relationships between management and<br />
labour, that they got ultimately to get down and reconcile themselves<br />
to opposing points of view and come to a negotiated agreement.<br />
That is very often true. But we also have to understand that<br />
trade unions have enormous power. Some of them have incomes up<br />
to $ 8 million or $ 10 million a year. They have not in the past<br />
been accountable for the way they spend that money. They can hold<br />
up any industry. They can boycott any company if they determine<br />
to. They could send any particular company or individual bankrupt,<br />
if they determine to. If you are going to say that the trade<br />
unions should not be subject to law in the conduct of their<br />
relationships with the wider community, then we are saying something<br />
terribly serious about the nature of life in Australia. I think<br />
today any significant union has more power than any corporation<br />
or company. Yet nobody says that company directors should not be<br />
subject to the law. If they break the law, they are prosecuted, / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime minister ( continued)<br />
or they go to gaol. People say " they have broken the law, there<br />
is a penalty". That is it.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
Are you addressing yourself specifically, though, to Section<br />
of the Trade Practices Act?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
What I am saying more specifically is that the conduct of<br />
industrial relations has got to be held against the background of<br />
law. You cannot just rely on reasonableness. You just cannot<br />
rely on conciliation and negotiation, because unions have too much<br />
power in a number of instances. If you are going to say that<br />
people with as much power as that within our community can operate<br />
without the restraint of law, without any framework of law,<br />
then we are going to have an unlicensed situation where the rest<br />
of the community would pay an enormously heavy price. So, what<br />
I am saying is that there have got to be laws. I do not believe<br />
that in the face of a union seeking to confront a particular law<br />
the Government should then turn around and say " all right, we<br />
will modify or change that law". If you basically believe in the<br />
reasonableness of it, well then the law ought to be upheld.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
or its workability and the cost of enforcing that law. Say, for<br />
example, hypothetically, a child were to die as a result of the<br />
petrol shortage. Would it be that child's life that is the cost.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
You are making that kind of judgement. Let's say a company goes<br />
bankrupt because a trade union determines how that company does<br />
its business, because a trade union says ' you cannot buy from<br />
that supplier, you cannot use these truckdrivers, you have got<br />
to use other truckdrivers, and if you do not do what we say,<br />
we are going to boycott you completely and send you out of<br />
business'. As a result of that, other people get hurt. The<br />
family loses its home and all the rest. So putting up your<br />
sort of hypothetical example against another: if you allow<br />
a company to be boycotted and if you allow it to be destroyed as<br />
a result of that, then you saying that can happen to any other<br />
company. It could happen to this radio station if you do or say<br />
things which a union does not like. Giving that kind of power to.<br />
a body such as a trade union is something that cannot be tolerated<br />
in a civilised society.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
Even in a pluralistic society. I mean, there is no question,<br />
the Transport Worker's Union is abusing the power which a trade<br />
union has at the moment, because it is ignoring the Rule of Law,.<br />
it is ignoring, I guess, logic and reason within the community.<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Prime Minister<br />
If they understood it, or the community understood it, the<br />
argument is not an argument between unions, it is not really an<br />
argument about rates of pay, it is an argument as to whether<br />
which members of the same State registered union should be doing<br />
certain work, which really makes it a total absurdity.<br />
Vincent Smith-<br />
They are now shifting the emphasis towards that, aren't they.<br />
They have been raising 45D as the prime thing. Last night they<br />
seemed to change towards their conditions of work and employment.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
They are still members within a union. We have all seen very<br />
damaging demarkation disputes when it is between two different<br />
unions in Australia. That is bad enough and silly enough. But<br />
when it is members of the same State registered union, some of<br />
whom are saying to others " we are going to do that work but<br />
John Smith, a member of the same union, is not allowed to do that<br />
work", I would have that that is a very sad, absurd basis for<br />
an industrial dispute. If they have a quarrel about the terms<br />
and conditions of one group of employees against another, there<br />
are ways of having that examined: go to a tribunal, get it<br />
examined, get a judgement. You do not have to hold up the nation<br />
for that.<br />
Vincent Smith-<br />
I don't think anybody is really arguing that the Transport<br />
Worker's Union is being totally and unutterably unreasonable<br />
in this situation. But what people have been saying, and I am sure<br />
I have been asking it of myself, and when my wife rang me this<br />
morning to say that a lot of the women at the school were talking<br />
about going and virtually panic-buying food, then we've got a<br />
very serious situation. Doesn't it then become a responsibility<br />
of a Government to step in and try to find ways in which it might<br />
be defused.<br />
Prime minister<br />
I think it is a responsibility of Government. But what I would say<br />
is that the way of defusing it is not to allow the law to be run<br />
over, or not to allow the protections of the law for a particular<br />
individual to cease. Because if you are going to say that everytime<br />
an unreasonable union puts the community at large at risk you are<br />
then going to change the law or modify it, you are really saying<br />
that you will give in everytime that an unreasonable union starts<br />
to make it inconvenient or difficult, or even damaging, for the<br />
public. ./ 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
Does that necessarily mean that?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
I think it does. Because you are taking the example of<br />
difficulty. There was a dispute in Victoria, mostly, some<br />
time ago, and people would not deliver milk to hospitals and<br />
all the rest. As a result of that, we gave ourselves some<br />
additional powers under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act<br />
and those powers are now law. If, in this dispute, hospitals<br />
started to go short of supplies, or whatever, and the safety,<br />
health or welfare of the community started to be threatened,<br />
we could use those powers. If we had to, we would. But, if you<br />
are going to say that everytime the community is put at risk that<br />
we must give in, that the union must get whatever it had demanded,<br />
then you are really saying that companies can only do what the<br />
union determines, governments can only do what the union determines,<br />
people can only be allowed a freedom within what the union itself<br />
determines. That: would destroy the basis of Australian society.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
Do you think the basis of Australian society is at threat now,<br />
with the condition<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Oh no. Because I have enormous confidence in the commonsense and<br />
the decency and the spirit of independence of the Australian<br />
people. Vincent Smith<br />
But isn't that at risk right now, given the frustrations and the<br />
belligerence that is emerging in this situation.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It is being challenged by the Transport Worker's Union. It is.<br />
Vincent Smith-<br />
But it also becoming a part of the community. People are bickering<br />
about places in queus. People are bickering about, obviously will<br />
be, about whether they are entitled to a piece of food on a<br />
supermarket shelf.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
This sort of thing happens when there is a difficulty. The kind<br />
of confrontation of the Australianpeople because that is what it<br />
it that the TWU is now involved in that can create difficulty.<br />
It can create hardship. But it will not challenge, it cannot succeed,<br />
in diminishing or destroying the fundamentals of Australian freedom,<br />
because these things are too deeply embedded. The wrath of the<br />
Australian people against the union would be so great that the<br />
members of the union itself would desert their leaders if they<br />
pressed that kind of view too far. Ultimately, what can succeed<br />
or not does get back in part to what a community will tolerate. </p>
<p>Vincent Smith<br />
Do you accept that N. S. W. is in a crisis at the moment?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
I think it is in a very difficult position. I do not like using<br />
the word crisis because it is used for so many things that are not<br />
a crisis.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
( Inaudible) without diminishing its meaning.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
But not only in N. S. W. There is the potential for this dispute<br />
spreading right around Australia. We had a long discussion<br />
about this in the Federal Government yesterday. I have spoken to<br />
Tony Street about it on a number of occasions. He has been in<br />
close touch with Sir John Moore, who has not really got any<br />
jurisdiction in relation to it because it is a State registered<br />
union, and as I have been advised, basically operating in the<br />
critical areas under a State award. But, in a sense, by grace,<br />
people have been in consultation with him. Obviously we need to<br />
hope that that can lead to a sensible conclusion of it.<br />
Vincent Smith-<br />
Sir John would now have some jurisdiction because the Victorians<br />
are out for 48 hours the Victorian members of the Transport<br />
Workers Union. We have the Federal union involved now,<br />
through Ivan Hodgson.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Whether or not he has specific jurisdiction; earlier this morning<br />
I was told it was by grace. But this again underlines another<br />
matter. Vincent Smith-<br />
Can we come back to that after this news break. We have news<br />
coming up in about 25 seconds. I would like to come back then<br />
and discuss this a little further with you and perhaps take some<br />
calls on 9295555, which our number. Our guest in the studio is<br />
the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr. Malcolm Fraser. We are<br />
discussing largely our problem with petrol; whether we are going<br />
to see any petrol flowing as a result of discussions today. You<br />
may have some questions you want to put to the Prime Minister on<br />
929555. We entertain those questions after this news break which<br />
is coming up in about 5 seconds.<br />
( News Break) / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
Vincent Smith-<br />
Our guest in the studio is the Prime Minister, Mr. Malcolm Fraser.<br />
What we will do, we have a race coming up in about three minutes<br />
and we will try to hold that race for some time and we will try<br />
quickly to get a couple of calls in, or at least one call, before.<br />
we go to that race.<br />
CALLER I would like to ask the Prime Minister a question please.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, why can't it's two parts why can't the<br />
Federal Government intervene, and secondly, why is it that Mr. Wran,<br />
who never stops complaining about the unemployment in the State<br />
of why is it that he cannot act when he brought down his<br />
emergency legislation over the truckies dispute. I am becoming<br />
a very confused housewife and mother, with politics.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, I am not surprised at the confusion, because I think it is<br />
sometimes a difficult situation. The Federal Government, as this<br />
began, did not have much jurisdiction because, as I am advised,<br />
all the members who were involved in the dispute were members of<br />
a State branch of the Transport Worker's Union a State registered<br />
union. I had also been advised that they were operating under a<br />
State award but there is some question about that so I am trying<br />
to check it now. In spite of that, Sir John Moore has been having<br />
discussions with the parties. Those discussions are proceeding.<br />
He is the highest authority in Australia so far as the<br />
Commonwealth is concerned. So whether or not we have legal<br />
jurisdiction, Sir John Moore is involved because of our very real<br />
concern. Now, on the question of the State's emergency legislation,<br />
of course it could use that legislation if it wanted to use that<br />
legislation. There was a time earlier when the State was out of<br />
petrol over the Kurnell Oil Refinery dispute. That was another<br />
jurisdictional argument. The men wanted to be operating under a<br />
State award but the rest of the industry was on a Federal award.<br />
I think the only time the legislation has been applied, as you say,<br />
is over the truckies.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
That comes back to the proposal which you made, which was made<br />
at the last Premieres Conference. That is, to take an approach<br />
to try to bring all unions into one jurisdiction, so that we don't<br />
have those. Is there any progress being made on that, Prime Minister?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Not a great deal. Tony Street has been having meetings with the<br />
State Labour Ministers. All the Premiers endorsed this examination.<br />
There is in fact a meeting scheduled, I think, for tomorrow or<br />
the next day. I am going to today write to the Premiers asking that<br />
they give a new sense of urgency to the discussions, because so<br />
many of the disputes do involve a divided jurisdiction. It is<br />
then possible for the State to say it is our responsibility, and<br />
for us to say " no, you ought to be handling it". I would much sooner<br />
there was a clear jurisdiction. Even though there are real ./ 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
Prime Minister-( continued)<br />
difficulties involved, I would sooner the Commonwealth was<br />
clearly responsible than that Governments be allowed to be in<br />
the position of arguing " no, Mr. Wran you should be doing it", and<br />
Mr. Wran says " no, Fraser, you should be doing it". That is a<br />
most unhelpful situation when you have that sort of argument.<br />
Vincent Smith-<br />
And that does give rise to bitterness and ill feeling, that is<br />
unproductive. Prime Minister<br />
I think it gives rise to the sort of confusion which my<br />
questioner admitted to. I do not blame the community for that.<br />
Vincent Smith-<br />
The other interesting jurisdictional question that is raised in<br />
this whole dispute is the question of the jurisdiction of the<br />
Federal court, which has handled Section 45D of the Trade Practices<br />
Act, and the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Commissioner,<br />
Sir John Moore, if he were to rule that there ought to be some<br />
approach to Section 45D. Which jurisdiction would have precedence?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think it is very unlikely that Sir John Moore would say much<br />
about 45D because that is part of the Restrictive Trade Practices<br />
legislation. It is necessary for that legislation to be equal<br />
handed in its impact. I was making the point before, companies<br />
and company directors operate under very heavy legal restraints.<br />
There need to some legal restraints in the union area.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
I hate to do this to you, but can we cross to a race?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, that is much more important.<br />
CALLER<br />
Mr. Prime Minister. Thank you for speaking to me. When Section<br />
was put into this Act some three years ago I think, Mr. Hawke<br />
and various other unions and employers associations, including<br />
George Polites, said that they did not think it was a very good<br />
idea; that if ever it was used it would be rather grim for<br />
Australia with the unions and strikes and for the good of<br />
Australia and the business of Australia. Two part question: if<br />
a Liberal Government was in the State of N. S. W. now, and the TWU<br />
took them on and struck, well they could do it. It is not just<br />
because it is a Labor Government that we have copped all this<br />
unpleasantness and strike. It can happen in any State. I love<br />
Australia and what I would like to see is less stirring, politically,<br />
and more round-table conferences. And let's get on with the job<br />
and say because the State happens to have a Labor Government in, it<br />
/ 8 </p>
<p>-8<br />
CALLER ( continued)<br />
is the Labor Government's fault. It is the union's fault, and<br />
that was put into this Section 45D. The court has used<br />
it and I failed to see how, if Sir John Moore comes to a decision,<br />
how it can be overcome because the court has ruled, in another<br />
court not the Arbitration Court that so-and-so, the TWU, have<br />
got to deliver petrol to this man. Now, to me it is an absolute<br />
mess and I think it is all caused and go back to the beginning of<br />
it, of Section 45D being put into the Act.<br />
Vincent Smith-<br />
I think what your question is: is Section 45D going to solve<br />
a strike?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Let me say at the outset that we shouldn't pre-judge what has<br />
happened in the discussions with Sir John Moore. I think we should<br />
all hope that they will be successful through consultation as<br />
you have plainly indicated, you believe it ought to be.<br />
I know trade unions do not like Section 45D. I am not aware that<br />
employers had opposed it. There have been many disputes over the<br />
last three years in which action has been commenced under 45D and<br />
a dispute has ended. In other words, the presence of 45D has led<br />
to a reduction in disputes in a number of areas because it has been<br />
effective in ending a secondary boycott. The trade union movement<br />
and Mr. Hawke, oppose any law that puts any restraint on any<br />
trade union. It is not just a question of 45D. Those sections of<br />
the Arbitration Act that put a restraint on a trade union, they<br />
also oppose. If we are going to say that any law that the trade<br />
union movement or its leaders do not like we have to alter or<br />
abolish, then we are going to allow the trade unions, that have<br />
immense power, to do what they like with the people of Australia,<br />
with companies or with Governments. Under those circumstances,<br />
Australia would very quickly become ungovernable.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
Prime Minister, could I ask you a question. It is said that<br />
elements, and the essential elements of 45D, are embodied in<br />
Common Law and in existing industrial law and that therefore that<br />
section is not really necessary within the statutes.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I do not think, as I have been advised, that Commonwealth law<br />
or industrial law would give the same sort of protection as<br />
It is a secondary boycott situation. It is designed quite<br />
specifically, to prevent, in a sense, third parties getting caught<br />
up in an industrial dispute. Let's take another example: if<br />
the Transport Worker's Union take a dislike to a particular<br />
company or the way it is operating, they say that they are buying<br />
the supplies from the wrong supplier, and they say we will only<br />
allow you to be supplied and carry your goods so long as you<br />
buy your raw materials from instead of buying them from<br />
That is the sort of power that they are trying to exert. It is<br />
not a proper use of union power. Again, we need to come back that<br />
this is an argument within a union. All members of the State / 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
Prime minister ( continued)<br />
branch, State-registered Branch, of the Transport Worker's Union<br />
and the union is saying " some of our members must do this work,<br />
but other of our members should not do this work". It really<br />
does seem to be an absurd proposition for the union to be taking.'<br />
Vincent Smith-<br />
But on the State branch, are not members who work for AMOCO Federal,<br />
they work for members of a Federal union? So we really have<br />
a jurisdictional problem.<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
No. I think they are under a Federal award but under a State<br />
branch of the union. That is the latest information I have.<br />
But I am also advised that the people that Mr. Laidley had been<br />
employing were members of the same union, but under a State award.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
Nevertheless, is Section 45D going to in fact solve a strike ever?<br />
The last time we had a major one was the Gorman dispute in<br />
Victoria which came almost as far as this one has gone. At that<br />
stage Mr. Gorman pulled back from his position. This time<br />
Mr. Laidley has said he is not going to pull back. He is going<br />
to fight on. It will precipitate giving, and accepting all the<br />
points you made about the principle of the individual's right to<br />
operate in this community as opposed to the trade union. What<br />
about my right as an individual to petrol. Does there no-, ccme a<br />
time where a Gover-nment has to step in and say " well, look, the<br />
reality of the situation is that the law isn't working".<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. I do not think so at all. In industrial law we all know<br />
at times there are going to be difficulties. We all know that the<br />
trade union movement will try and challenge laws that put any<br />
restraint on their actions. But we really do need to look at the<br />
massive power that those unions have. If we are going to say<br />
any law that they challenge is creating a difficulty, a hardship<br />
for the community therefore the law must be removed, is just saying<br />
the community can operate in the way in which the leaders of that<br />
particular trade union determine. You are not really free if you<br />
can only get petrol the way the trade union determines, because<br />
you never know. You might have it this week, but they might say<br />
next week you cannot have it. You need to be able to get petrol<br />
and your freedom is dependent upon knowing you can get petrol,<br />
because nobody has the power within this community to challenge or<br />
to inhibit your right to get that petrol. </p>
<p>10<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
What I am getting at, is trying in the short term to resolve<br />
the problem so that we can have our petrol and then get down<br />
to the much longer term issue of resolving the question of just<br />
where a trade union movement fits into a pluralistic society.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
But you see what is happening is that the trade union is using<br />
your wish, and everyone else's wish to have petrol, and to be<br />
able to buy it when they want it, to achieve an illicit and<br />
improper objective. In other words, they are trying to use yours<br />
and everyone's natural inclinations as a lever in their cause.<br />
* This is why, for example, we introduced legislation some time ago<br />
giving us additional powers if a union was taking action designed<br />
to affect the safety, health or welfare of the people. If a<br />
union was taking an action which was going to deny milk to hospitals,<br />
to take a clear example, and therefore the welfare of children<br />
or all sorts of people in hospitals, that affects their safety,<br />
it affects their welfare. Then we have substantial powers to deal<br />
with that. But just because it is a hospital and people could be<br />
damaged if they do not get that milk, is not a reason for saying<br />
the law should be abolished, the unions should have the power<br />
to do what they like.<br />
Vincent Smith-<br />
Mr. Fraser, just before we go any further on the petrol strike,<br />
we were talking about a story which appeared in the Financial Review<br />
this week about Australia reneging on some of the offers you made<br />
to the United States in terms of docking facilities at Cockburn Sound<br />
in Western Australia. That story originated from?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
well, it originated from the Washington correspondent of the<br />
Financial Review. The story is not correct. One of the things we<br />
discussed when I was in Washington was the home porting, or base<br />
porting, of American ships in Australian ports. They spoke about<br />
a number of things. They spoke about the possibility of home<br />
porting a carrier task force which would have been two or three<br />
ships. We pointed out that a very substantial investment would be<br />
involved; a lot of housing if families were going to be moved.<br />
We said we were willing to examine it, make the facilities<br />
available. Clearly, there would be investment involved from you,<br />
there would be investment involved from us. But there has been no<br />
firm proposal. I would be delighted to get a proposal on that<br />
particular subject from the Americans. I would hope that it could<br />
be accepted and worked through. The suggestion that the Americans<br />
had had a rejection on it well, I don't know where it came from,<br />
but it is just not true.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
What in effect was that the Australian offer when you were<br />
in Washington was a much broader one. / 11 </p>
<p>Prime Minister-<br />
Oh it is. We had offered the use of facilities across a wide<br />
range of front, and the Americans are examining what they want<br />
to pick up.<br />
Vincent Smith-<br />
Coming up with some specific proposals. So there has been<br />
no rejection?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No rejection in that area at all.<br />
Vincent Smith-<br />
Okay. Let's get back to the dispute here, which I think most<br />
people are more concerned about.<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
Well, I think they are. It is a lot closer to home at the<br />
moment. CALLER Mr. Prime Minister, the consensus of what you have said previously<br />
this afternoon, is that virtually the unions are using the needs,<br />
I won't say the desires, but the needs of the people of this country<br />
to further their political or monetary aims.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Political it might be because the TWU are arguing that one group<br />
of their own members should be doing certain work, rather than<br />
another group of the members of the same union, so I suppose that<br />
it is a political aim in union terms.<br />
CALLER I feel, I mean I am completely confused and a lot of other people<br />
are in the same boat, I feel sure of that. I feel they are lacking<br />
in positive leadership. We have had statements of, really I<br />
consider minor nature, term it that, from Mr. Street, yourself<br />
and Mr. Wran. Now, I just feel it is about time that someone got<br />
up and made a positive statement of what is going to happen.<br />
We are just muddling along. Day to day we are listening to bulletin<br />
after bulletin on the air not knowing where the hell we are going..<br />
Now, can we get someone to tell us where we are heading?<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
I think that is largely what I have been trying to get at.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
In the industrial arena it is sometimes very difficult. Even<br />
though there were doubts about whether he had jurisdiction or not,<br />
the President of the Arbitration Commission, Sir John Moore, has<br />
/ 12 </p>
<p>12<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
been having meetings between the parties. He is having<br />
meetings between the parties this morning, this afternoon.<br />
Obviously, the objective there is to reach agreement and to have.<br />
it resolved. Now, while that is going on, while the parties<br />
are in conference, it is not very helpful<br />
CALLER ( Inaudible).<br />
Prime-Minister<br />
I was going to say it would not be very helpful for Governments,<br />
whether it is my Government or for the State Government, to be<br />
making statements about what they may or may not do. We have to<br />
give the negotiation, the consultation, under the chairmanship<br />
of Sir John Moore, a chance to work. Governments at a certain<br />
stage can say that they are going to apply a certain provision<br />
of the law. Mr. Wran could say he is going to invoke his emergency<br />
legislation to protect the people of Sydney from the dispute.<br />
But I do not think any of that would be helpful while there is a<br />
consultation going on, which we all hope will resolve the matter.<br />
Vincent Smith-<br />
Could not for example Prime Minister, Senator Carrick, the<br />
National Development Minister, have presented a plan which says<br />
if the strike goes beyond a weekend and reaches this critical<br />
stage, this is what the Federal Government would propose to do<br />
for the emergency distribution of petrol nationally, because that<br />
is part of Senator Carrick's portfolio.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
But if all members of the Transport Worker's Union are going to<br />
go on strike al-nG not be prepared to drive petrol tankers, the<br />
very most you would be able to do is to have petrol suppliers<br />
distributed for the most stringent emergency services: hospitals,<br />
doctors, this sort of thing. It would not be possible to have petrol<br />
supplied to the general community, either for normal business<br />
purposes or for private purposes.<br />
CALLER<br />
Well-, 1i' 1rP. ri .1,-e Minister, if that occurs, and it seems quite<br />
likely tha'C mLight occur-<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes it could. ItL could.<br />
CALLER Well, where do we go from there. This is what we are after.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
If you say where do we go from there, if the consultation cannot<br />
succeed, we could be in for a long, drawn-out grind, because the / 13 </p>
<p>13<br />
Prime minister ( continued)<br />
Federal Government is not going to allow the law of the land<br />
which is designed to protect the people of Australia to be defeated<br />
or frustrated by any particular trade union leadership. I have<br />
said earlier today<br />
CALLER I couldn't agree more with that, but when will this occur.<br />
We have been years past now<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There have been a number of occasions when we have used pretty<br />
powerful weapons, legal weapons, against trade unions over the<br />
last three or four years, especially in the area of the<br />
Commonwealth's own employment, where have greater powers than<br />
we have in the other arenas. You will remember the Redfern<br />
disputes and the Telecom disputes. I think it was the application<br />
of law and the application of quite rigid penalties that<br />
achieved a resolution of those areas. If we have to do it again,<br />
we will do it again.<br />
CALLER It seems like a many-headed monster, this thing. You lop one<br />
off and the other one comes up.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well., it is. In industrial relations it is, if you like,<br />
a continuing story of human relationships. There is no one single<br />
head to it. You have a whole variety of unions. You have a whole<br />
variety of companies. Some of them conduct their affairs much<br />
better and more sensibly than others. But at any point, if there<br />
has been a breakdown, you get the possibility of a dispute<br />
occurring which can do a good deal of damage to the people involved<br />
and to society as a whole. What I am saying is, that I do not<br />
think the matter of industrial relations is a battle, if you want<br />
to call it that, is ever won for all time.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
Prime Minister, given the fact that it is one of those continuing<br />
relationships, a continuing relationship between people, does it<br />
not require some sensitivity, some flexibility, and even an ability<br />
on the part of Government from time to time to say " let's question<br />
this law, is it workable, is it going to work, is it going to<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We can do that, yes. But you see, I would say that 45D has worked.<br />
I would also say that 45D has been a very necessary protection<br />
to many industries. I was being told of a position in the United<br />
States the other day when there was a boycott placed on a / 14 </p>
<p>14<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
particular company. They went to law. They got an injunction.<br />
The employee was fined $ 1,000 and told to be back at work and to<br />
deliver the concrete. Because of his respect for the law, he<br />
paid the $ 1,000 fine and was back the next day delivering<br />
the concrete. It was on a building job. In the United States,<br />
one of the great differences between Australia, in the United<br />
States their trade unions expect to be subject to the law just<br />
as companies are subject to the law. If a company gets caught<br />
by the law it has transgressed, and directors get charged or<br />
they get fined or the company, or somebody gets put in gaol,<br />
nobody says that it a terrible thing, the law has failed.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
It is a different system there though.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. It is not really a different system. It really is not.<br />
Not all that much different.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
There is not an industrial jurisdiction though?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes there is. There is a Labour Relations Board. If they cannot<br />
come to an agreement by collective bargaining, they can appeal<br />
to the Labour Relations Board. It does much of the work that our<br />
Industrial Relations Bureau does. If they cannot get agreement<br />
through collective bargaining, they can appoint an arbitrator, and<br />
I think sometimes a compulsory arbitrator. The names are different,<br />
the terminology is different.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
But it does devolve eventually to the civil law?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think so, yes. But here it can too. Yes, I think you were<br />
asking something else.<br />
CALLER What worries me more than anything else is the fact that we<br />
are slowly being bled to death. I mean, you could not calculate<br />
what a strike like this is costing this country. </p>
<p>15<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, you can calculate it in tens and tens of millions of<br />
dollars. CALLER It is affecting everyone. Every business in the country<br />
is losing money. Every worker is losing money. Every family,<br />
Everyone is losing. Really, you say you can calculate it.<br />
I don't think you could calculate it. I think it<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, there are ways of calculating the money lost and<br />
CALLER ( Inaudible) if you did put it all together.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We do not have to calculate it, we accept, and I agree with you,<br />
that the cost is enormous. But I would also say that the cost of<br />
allowing unions to operate in a unrestrained way outside any law,<br />
no framework of law to protect the community, the cost of that,<br />
over time, would be infinitely greater because it would destroy<br />
the freedoms which are important to all of us.<br />
CALLER I agree with you Mr. Fraser that this is not a crisis. of course<br />
it will end, won't it? The petrol strike, all strikes, end.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It is a question of how much damage and how many people are hurt<br />
before that happens.<br />
CALLER I doubt there will be an awful lot. There will be some dollars<br />
go down the drain. But here at Castle Hill, where I live, we<br />
are enjoying the strike quite frankly, at least I am. Our village<br />
has become a little more peaceful. I hope you come to our Show<br />
next weekend.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I was at it last year I think, wasn't I?<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
Not if there is no petrol.<br />
CALLER Well, I can lend you some petrol. I've got some and I have access<br />
to some more. But do come if you can, it is quite charming. / 16 </p>
<p>16<br />
CALLER First of all, goo~ d afternoon. You have got Section 45D in the<br />
books and both you and Mr. Street have both said that it is a<br />
good law and it is a law and it is there and it must be obeyed.<br />
Now, seeing that that law is there and it is to be obeyed, will<br />
the politicans give an undertaking to obey the electoral laws,<br />
especially would you give an undertaking to make sure they all<br />
observe the law as far as putting their expense statement and<br />
they don't spend beyond the amount of money they are allowed to<br />
spend.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
Section 151 of the Electoral Act. That's what I was going to raisewith<br />
you anyway.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There is more than one section in the electoral act. There are<br />
sections which indicate that parties have got to put in returns.<br />
Others that indicate individuals have got to put in returns and<br />
organisations that are involved in elections also have to put in<br />
returns. Because of the problems that occurred in Tasmania,<br />
we are now examining those aspects of the law to try and make sure<br />
that there is a clarity about it and that individuals and parties,<br />
organisations, will know precisely what their obligations are.<br />
CALLER But this law has obviously not worked, the same as 45D really is<br />
not a law that can work.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think 45D has worked. It has been used on many occasions.<br />
CALLER ( Inaudible) it has got to the stage where an injunction has been<br />
put. ( Inaudible) tanker drivers out and you have crippled one<br />
State and you look like crippling a few other States.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Oh, now wait a minute. I think that you need to understand what<br />
this is about, because there was a person who was running a small<br />
business, it was an oil distribution business, a-d in relation to<br />
that particular business the employer was employing people belonging<br />
to the State branch of the Transport Worker's Union. Then he bought<br />
a petrol retail business, was using his same drivers still members<br />
of the State Transport Worker's Union but then the union says<br />
/ 17 </p>
<p>17<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
" tyou can't use those blokes, you've got to use other members<br />
of the same union". In other words, the union was trying to tell<br />
this particular businessman exactly how he could run his<br />
business. If you want trade unions to have that kind of power,<br />
I am afraid I do not, and the majority of Australians will not.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
Now, what was your point?<br />
CALLER My point is that this is a site that was historically supplied<br />
by company drivers, were shut for a period of 8 months, and it<br />
has re-opened.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
But Mr. Laidley re-opened it.<br />
CALLER Mr. Laidley re-opened it, but nevertheless he still wants to<br />
supply a site which was historically supplied, when it was opened.<br />
The company closed it, not the drivers, originally.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
But it was closed, and it wasn't operating, and then Mr. Laidley<br />
decided to re-open it.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
He was providing more jobs as a result, and they are still members<br />
of the same union. Do you run a business?<br />
CALLER Mr. Laidley's people get far less than what a company driver<br />
gets. Prime Minister<br />
Do you run a business?<br />
CALLER Yes. / 18 </p>
<p>18<br />
Prime Minister<br />
What sort of business?<br />
CALLER Oh, a small business.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes, but what sort, hardware, groceries or what?<br />
CALLER No. Light engineer.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Light engineer? Where do you buy your materials?<br />
CALLER The same place as anyone else does, from the suppliers, the<br />
wholesalers. Prime Minister<br />
Yes, but would you like it if the union said to you let's say<br />
the union sets up a wholesale business the Transport Worker's<br />
Union goes into business, sets up a wholesale business, and then<br />
they come along and say to you " you can only buy your supplies<br />
from the Transport Worker's Union company"<br />
CALLER But if I was continually supplied by a company driver from my<br />
wholesaler, which I am now, there is no way in the world that I<br />
would want to buy a truck and go down to MacPhersons and..<br />
bring it back.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That is not the point I am making. I am making the point that<br />
if the Transport Worker's Union wanted to set up a wholesale<br />
business and provide you with the sort of supplies that you<br />
normally buy, and then just tell you that that is where you have<br />
got to buy them from, would you like that?<br />
CALLER That is not the case in point at all. ./ 19 </p>
<p>19<br />
Prime Minister<br />
But it would be, wouldn't it. That is the sort of power<br />
they are trying to use.<br />
CALLER That's got nothing to with it. It's just playing a game on<br />
words. Prime Minister<br />
I do not think so.<br />
CALLER ( Inaudible) give an undertaking that if the law is not changed<br />
the Electoral Act will be strictly observed at the forthcoming<br />
Federal Election?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, the law is going to be changed.<br />
CALLER It is going to be changed? Well, then why can't you change<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That was an obvious question, wasn't it? Because we believe<br />
has been successful.<br />
CALLER I am a businessman in the city, slowly going broke because of<br />
these unionists. I speak to a lot of people, particularly in the<br />
city. You would have millions of people here standing up and<br />
cheering if you and your Government would show some backbone and<br />
some guts and get that petrol to us, and not to the few people who<br />
don't deserve it.. If you would stand up to these unionists, if<br />
you would deliver the petrol and you would tell these unionists<br />
to go to hell and leave their jobs if they are not happy with what<br />
they are doing: why don't you help the people of Australia instead<br />
of talking a lot of nonsense which you and Mr. Street have been<br />
talking instead of getting down to basic facts.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I do not think we are talking a lot of nonsense. The only way<br />
that you are going to be able to get the supplies that you need on<br />
a continuous basis, if organisations that are powerful in this<br />
country adhere to the law which is designed to protect you and<br />
everyone else. I do not think. anyone wants the circumstance where </p>
<p>20<br />
Prime minister ( continued)<br />
they have got to run their business -the way a union tells them.<br />
CALLER I agree with you Mr. Fraser, but you've got the power. Put the<br />
army in. Get the petrol to the people. Do something positive<br />
instead of talking and talking and talking and getting nowhere.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, in relation to emergency supplies of petrol into the city<br />
of Sydney, it is the State Government that has the powers to do that.<br />
If you are going to use other means for emergency distribution<br />
of petrol, the most you would be able to cover would be<br />
emergency supplies, hospitals, doctors, and matters of that kind.<br />
Without people prepared to drive trucks and run them in the normal<br />
way, you would do no more than be able to keep emergency supplies<br />
going. You could not keep the normal business of this nation going.<br />
Vincent Smith-<br />
Prime minister, would you like to have a knockdown, drag-out<br />
stoush with the trade union movement to determine this, I think<br />
over-simplistic question, of who is running the country; the<br />
Government or the unions.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think the price of that, in terms of hardship done to a great<br />
many people, would be enormous. I would not want that sort of<br />
brawl at all. But at the same time, having said that, I hope that<br />
no member of the Transport Worker's Union will take that as showing<br />
an lack of determination on the part of the Federal Government.<br />
Vincent Smith-<br />
What could that resolve?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
All it can do is to teach lesson; and that is, that people have<br />
got to operate within the normal framework of law. If people have<br />
got an industrial dispute, there are the State tribunals or<br />
Federal tribunals to go and get it resolved and get a judgement<br />
from a third party, from the umpire. There is not a need to have<br />
a strike, to put on bans and limitations, and cause inconvenience<br />
in -the whole community. It seems to me that you sometimes get<br />
union officials who go on getting paid no matter how much harm<br />
comes to their members because the members are on strike and losing<br />
salary, who think that they have got to make a big fellow of<br />
themselves by demonstrating how tough they are in terms of a dispute.<br />
I think that is an element in some. / 21 </p>
<p>21<br />
CALLER I would like to ask Mr. Fraser a question with regard to the<br />
secret ballot. Why is it that we cannot have a secret ballot<br />
in this way: if a secret ballot or members were if it was<br />
brought into law both at a Federal and a State level, that all<br />
members of a union would have to vote in a secret ballot before<br />
a strike could be called, those votes to be counted by members<br />
of the electoral office. Now, surely, if that were to happen,<br />
the amount of money that it costs to do this, would surely be more<br />
than offset by the man hours which would be lost by such a strike<br />
and the disruption to business.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think there is a good deal in what you say about that. One of<br />
the problems is that in some unions it would be very hard to<br />
organise from a practical basis. In the waterfront for example,<br />
where everyone is gathered in virtually one place, it would be<br />
much easier to organise, but in the metal trades industries where<br />
you might have 6,000 or 8,000 shops right around Australia, many<br />
of them quite small, employing only 4 or 5 or 6 people, a ballot<br />
of the kind that you have mentioned could be very difficult<br />
to organise. There is a time scale involved and what happens while<br />
you are waiting to do that. This is a matter that the ' Covernment<br />
has examined on many occasions. We have introduced secret ballots<br />
for the election of union officials, and that is working well.<br />
CALLER But the actual men there are many men who are on strike who want<br />
to work. Their right to work should be protected. They are<br />
afraid to vote against it at union meetings because of physical<br />
injury to themselves, or damage to their property, which has<br />
happened. Now, these men, their right to work should be protected.<br />
All right, it is difficult, but in your own words " life was not<br />
meant to be easy". I don't mean that in any rude sense at all.<br />
I quite agree with you. But, I think we have got to try to do<br />
something. The unions are so rabid<br />
Prime Minister<br />
What makes it so hard, I am not saying it is not, but what does<br />
make it so hard for the people who want to work either to just go<br />
to work and turn up to work, or to speak out more vigorously at<br />
union meetings in favour of working.<br />
CALLER But if they do speak out, they are afraid because they are men<br />
with families. So many of them, I know, I have heard of it<br />
Prime Minister<br />
You mean they would get beaten up? / 22 </p>
<p>22<br />
CALLER ( Inaudible) physical injury to themselves and damage to their<br />
property. Some of the union members, the active factions, they<br />
are nothing but thugs.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think that happens in some cases. I have heard of many cases<br />
of intimidation. That makes it all the more reason when such<br />
people get into a position of union authority that they should<br />
not be allowed to run over the community.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
The problem of secret ballots though is an enormous one and<br />
secret ballots in a situation like this can involve hours and<br />
hours, days and days, of checking who is a member of what.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It is one of the problems: who is eligible to vote and if you<br />
are having a vote all around Australia it could be some days<br />
before you get a result.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
And in fact if the membership then confirms a strike, like this<br />
one, you are stuck with something that is much stronger than you<br />
really had intended.<br />
CALLER What I wanted to know: if a poll was put to the people of<br />
Australia, who are a little bit tired of being held to ransom<br />
every five minutes<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I agree with you completely.<br />
CALLER ( Inaudible) . But we are inconvenienced, sligtly sometimes, more so<br />
at other times. It affects us financially. I think if the<br />
average Australian was asked whether they wanted this law upheld<br />
to make a point, you might find they would all say yes, the number<br />
of people I have spoken to.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think they would say yes, because I believe people are fed up<br />
with the abuse of union power.' It is not as though a lot of<br />
people are not reasonably well paid, and it is not as though there<br />
are normal and proper ways of trying to get a grievance heard.<br />
There are. The message we have to get across is that there is no<br />
need for people to lose their own wages and to damage the rest of.<br />
the community to get a grievance heard. / 23 </p>
<p>23<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
But they do damage the rest of the community.<br />
CALLER ( Inaudible) if the hardship gets worse. I think we have reached<br />
a stage where we can say to ourselves it might get really tough,<br />
and if it does, if it is going -to make a point rather than have<br />
these continuous strikes that are affecting us and taking from<br />
our way of life, that if we have to face up if the Government<br />
gets to the stage where they say we are not going to back down<br />
on the law, you have got to stay with it maybe the unions<br />
and the people will suffer. But I think in the long term we<br />
might get a good result.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think you would get a good result in the long term, but if you<br />
did back down on it, I think then the community would be held<br />
to ransom.<br />
CALLER unions are in and the Government is out.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
You might as well, and the community would be held to ransom.<br />
But there is one reason why I think it is slightly worse in this<br />
particular State. There have been at least two occasions where<br />
there have been very significant disputes and the State Government<br />
has in fact backed the union. In one case, it legislation to take<br />
a matter out of the hands of the State industrial tribunal, and<br />
there is therefore a view in N. S. W. amongst some unions that if<br />
they make enough of a fuss and create enough difficulty, the<br />
State Government will. give them what they want. I am quite sure<br />
that is one of the things that has helped to contribute to the<br />
rash of disputes in N. S. W.<br />
CALLER State and the Liberal Government got on the same terms, faced<br />
up to what was happening and ( inaudible) each other these.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That would certainly help. I did propose to all the States about<br />
a year ago that we should talk together about the problems in<br />
industrial relations and try to get clearer areas of responsibility,<br />
try and get a basis on which we can support each other instead<br />
of having a divided jurisdiction and one that leads only to<br />
confusion. Unfortunately, the discussions that have taken place<br />
between State arid Commonwealth Ministers have not yet resulted<br />
in much. I am approaching the Premiers again today asking that a new<br />
sense of urgency be placed behind that particular examination. / 24 </p>
<p>24<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
Would you expect to get some results from that Prime Minister?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
I would have been hoping for results for the June Premiers'<br />
Conference. It cannot affect this particular dispute, but<br />
unless the rate of progress is speeded up a good deal, that<br />
will not occur.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, I think one question raised by that last<br />
caller was just how far you are prepared to prosecute Section<br />
Will you go ahead with fining people a quarter of a million<br />
dollars, with sending people to gaol if they don't pay?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
Obviously we would hope that there will be a resolution to the<br />
matter. It is in conference at the moment. But the Government<br />
has made up its mind. We discussed this at length yesterday.<br />
But we are not going to allow trade unions to flaunt the law.<br />
The law will be upheld.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
So you push it to the limit?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
Just let me say the law will1 be upheld.<br />
CALLER I have a small business in the South Sydney shire. My business<br />
has been seriously hampered by this dispute. Now, the key figure<br />
in the dispute is well protected by the law and ( inaudible),<br />
loss of revenue, etc. etc.<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
How do you mean the key figure is protected?<br />
CALLER Well, he has a course of redress. He is suing his particular<br />
union for not supplying.<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
He has taken out an injunction. But the fine paid for that<br />
injunction does not go to that particular person.<br />
CALLER No. I fully realise that. Yes. I fully realise that. But now<br />
what about us people who rely on a particular commodity, mine is<br />
distillate. I have cgot to obtain that. It has seriously affected </p>
<p>25<br />
CALLER ( continued)<br />
my particular business. I have no course of redress and one<br />
thing and another where I could go back and try and get any<br />
injunction against this particular gentlemen who is the key<br />
figure in the whole situation.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Or against the trade union that called the strike on.<br />
CALLER I think the law is wrong there. If it is a law there for one,<br />
it should be there for-everybody.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
But Mr. Laidley is likely to lose out also. He is not making<br />
any money and has not been for some time.<br />
CALLER I fully realise that. I admire him on his stand. But then when<br />
it comes to the crunch that every industry and people who<br />
can ill afford to have any time off from work are being stood down,<br />
or there is a good possibility that they will be stood down<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The point you are raising represents one of the tragedies of<br />
an industrial strike, because the people who are striking, the<br />
other industries that are hurt people like yourself the cost<br />
is enormous. It is never made up. It is lost and it is often<br />
lost for all time. It is all so unnecessary when all people have<br />
to do is to go to one of the industrial tribunals and have a case<br />
heard, so long as they are prepared to accept the umpire's verdict.<br />
We do not solve your position, or that of other people, by giving<br />
in to the trade unions.<br />
CALLER I am calling regarding the petrol. I think it is time that<br />
you should de-register the union.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There is a discussion going on at the moment with Sir John Moore<br />
and the parties concerned. We will be waiting to get a report<br />
of that discussions, and hopefully it will resolve the matter.<br />
But if it does not, the Government will have to look at what<br />
options are available to it. -Obviously, de-registration is one<br />
of the options. / 26 </p>

That won't solve the problem though, will it?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It does not solve the problem, but it takes a lot of protections<br />
away from the union officials and the union members; protections*<br />
under the law which obviously help them in the conduct of<br />
their business.<br />
Vincent Smith-<br />
It puts them outside the arbitration system though?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It can, but at the same time, unions have generally found that<br />
the protections that they get within the system a very substantial<br />
advantage. Vincent Smith-<br />
Prime Minister, just if we can clear up the confusion that seemed<br />
to appear earlier in the programme: the drivers who work for<br />
AMOCO are under a Federal award, they are members of teN. S. W.<br />
Branch of the Transport Worker's Union of Australia, and entitled<br />
to vote on both State and Federal matters. So really members of<br />
both branches.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
They are members of two unions in a sense. The State branches<br />
are a separately constituted union, as I understand it.<br />
Vincent Smith-<br />
And the agent's drivers are members of the State branch only and<br />
they are entitl. ed to vote only on State matters.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes.<br />
Vincent Smith-<br />
Clear that one up. Prime Minister, thanks very much for your time<br />
today. I know it is a stressful time for everybody in Australia.<br />
There is particular pressure on you, because I think if there is<br />
one thing that emerged from all those calls today, people are<br />
looking to the Federal Government for some sort of a lead in this.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
They always will, even if a matter, and I am not saying it is, in<br />
the ultimate, but even if a matter is a responsibility of a<br />
State Government, if it is one of major national concern, they<br />
do look to the Federal Government. That is why again, I hope, that<br />
the States will help us in getting to a better sense of<br />
responsibility and capacity in the industrial jurisdiction, so<br />
that we will not have people being able to ar~ ue this is<br />
Mr. Wran's responsibility or it is my responsibility. / 27 </p>
<p>27<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
I do not mind if it is all ours, but let's at least get the<br />
responsibility clear, so that somebody has got the capacity<br />
to do something about it.<br />
Vincent Smith<br />
Thanks for being our guest today. 000---<br />
