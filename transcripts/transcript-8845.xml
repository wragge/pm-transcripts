PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRINIE MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, ImP<br />
OPENING OF MICHAEL LAVARCH'S CAMPAIGN OFFICE, STRATHPINE<br />
QUEENSLAND, 7 APRIL 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you for that very gcnerous round of applause, and could I thank the Premier,<br />
Wayne Goss, for that generous introduction, and say how pleased I am to be here with<br />
Michael and Linda. My Parliamentary Colleagues, Party President and other members<br />
who are supportive of the Queensland Labor Party, Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
It is always interesting after an election to see what thc-published plls say, because they<br />
are more likely to get it right after the event than before the event' pairticularly with exit<br />
polls and the rest. What the last week or two has shown is that Government support has<br />
risen and Coalition support has fallen remarkcdly. I think we are entitled to say, or to<br />
conclude from that, the public have thought about the election in the three weeks or so<br />
since, and have decided that they have done the right thing. They thought their decision<br />
was right. These were not just confluences of circumstances which lead them to a<br />
particular decision, that upon more mature reflection they might like to reconsider. I think<br />
if the polls give us any indication, they arc only into indications and not levels, the levels<br />
invariably are not that accurate. But as indications, it is an indication that the public had<br />
thought that it was right. What we did was right. And that I think is very good for the<br />
country, very good for the Government, because I think that for that sense of appraisal to<br />
have taken place is important.<br />
And of course they don't go against the background of a Coalition Party which has<br />
literally dropped its bundle. We have seen in the weeks since the election, the Coalition<br />
now without a policy, without any idea of'what basis of appeal they believe they should<br />
have for Australia, let alone for themselves. So they have a candidate fielded in this<br />
election for the electorate of Dickson who is a candidate campaigning on a policy that<br />
doesn't exist, and the only policy tliat exists of course, as Wayne indicated in his speech,<br />
one borrowed from Thatcher in the late 1970s, what was basically an agenda policy of the<br />
Treasuries of the Western World in the 1970s the British Treasury, the Australian<br />
Treasury and which where having the world moved on the Coalition picked it up and<br />
ran mightily with it. </p>
<p>TEL<br />

But again, as Wayne intimated, their policies not only lack breadth and depth, but it<br />
lacked any sense of charity. I[ think the public thought to themselves, there has got to be<br />
more than one's nose to the grindstone, there's got to be more than this concept of no gain<br />
without pain, there had to be something better, something broader, something deeper, a<br />
greater sense of community than that which wc have been offered by the Coalition, and<br />
one which is going to seriously disadvantage many Australians, particularly working<br />
Australians. So it is very, in a sense, interesting that in one of thc fastest Vrowing ports of Australia we<br />
are now going to have another contest, another election. An election for the seat of<br />
Dickson, an election which has arisen in quite extraordinary circumistances and where we<br />
are also proposing another quite novel feature of thc clection, and that is the Labor<br />
Government of the Commonwealth is saying to the people of Dickson should you<br />
consider our candidate, and consider him worthy to be elcted as Member for Dickson, we<br />
will make him a member of the Cabinet of the Commonwealth.<br />
This says a number of things. The first thing it says is that we would not have presumed<br />
to have sworn Michael Lavarch as Attorney General, but rather made clear we would<br />
nominate him upon the people's choiZac'flist poinf7 Second point is that he is coming as a<br />
member of Parliament from the State of Queensland and as a very young man to a senior<br />
ministerial job. The first law officer of the Commonwealth at the age of 31. Those two<br />
points are very important. The third is, that he comes representing a community which is<br />
growing very strongly, where there is a demand for services, whcre hc is perhaps as<br />
representative as anyone might wish to be from one of the growing areas of Australia, and<br />
saying we put a premium on that sort of an area in this country being represented in the<br />
cabinet of the government of Australia. Because our Govenment is about governing<br />
broadly and governiing for people who are not advantaged by wealth, and not advantaged<br />
by great circumnstance and who often live with the vagaries and difficulties of a rapidly<br />
growing suburb or region. Michael talked about the services which this area needs and<br />
those which chc Commonwealth has proposed, and has introduced over time, but whcre in<br />
an area growing twicc as fast as this, in a State which is the fastest growing State of<br />
Australia, Queensland, that so typically chat we have chosen such a person to represent us.<br />
I think on those three counts, I hope thc people of Dickson cake the view that they would<br />
choose wisely in choosing Michael Lavarch, someone who has already served Queensland<br />
in the seat of Fisher, who has served in local Govcrniment who understands the<br />
community, is of the community, is from the community and will represent the<br />
community. I don't think any party can offer much more than that to any constituency, to<br />
any electorate, and I think that we are offering. We are offerig as well the opportunity<br />
for the people of Dickson to bc part of the generational change in the Government of the<br />
Commonwealth. TEL.: Rpr. 93 17: 20 No. 006 P. 02/ 05 </p>

This is an important thing. Governments, particularly governments that have had ten<br />
years In office, need that change, they need that horse power, that charge, the energy<br />
which comes from fresh ideas and fresh faces. Yesterday we had our first Cabinet meeting<br />
of the newly sworn Cabinet and just the change in the composition and the relative age of<br />
the members. I said to Brian Howe who was sitting beside mc, we are now a couple of<br />
oldies in here. It was true I think, and the conversation had some zest. People had read<br />
the brief and they wanted to put their view, and felt all of that electricity and charge that<br />
one felt in the flush of the Government's clcction in 1983 through thc 1980s. Secing it<br />
thcrc again really is very, very encouraging indeed.<br />
That is why I think that Michael Lavarch's elect ion in Dickson can just accelerate that<br />
process by seeing a Queenslander in one of the real jobs, the strong portfolio of the<br />
Commonwealth, the Attorney-Generalship of this country.<br />
We say that we would usc our mandate well, we will use it conscientiously. And<br />
everything we have done since thc election should demonstrate to the public that that is<br />
so. That nothing will be taken for granted, that the public have taken us on trust and it is<br />
trust that we will return to them, and that we will use both the opportunities and the time<br />
to the best of our advantage and theirs.<br />
All of that augurs well for Australia, and I might it augurs well for Queensland. Because<br />
always I get a charge from the throb of Queensland, you get that throb about the place<br />
because it is growing, it is expanding, it is moving, there is optimism here. I just spent a<br />
week in North Queensland, and I was making the point to the Premier on the way across<br />
that coming through this electorate, the growing area, it's got all the buzz of a place on the<br />
move as one gets right throughout Queensland. We do have great opportunities in<br />
Australia and one of the places of opportunities is the State of Queensland, and it is<br />
governed by a governmcnt which is going to be doing the same things and thinking the<br />
samec way as the Commonwcalth Government so that we advance together, we use the<br />
huge power of the Commonwealth with the co-operation of Wayne and his Government<br />
in ways that I think Premicis like Joh Bjclkc-Pctcrscn and others just let opportunities slip<br />
by, by naked, narrow, politicising of State and Commonwealth dichotomics, having<br />
attacks upon the Commonwealth government, who ever it might be, which was not really<br />
productive for the people of Queensland.<br />
That has all changed. Wc have got a very co-opcrative relationship and one where the<br />
Commonwealth today is doing things which formerly was the preserve of the States and<br />
where the States were doing things for the Commnonwealth in areas which were only done<br />
by us. I think the changes we made at thc Commonwealth Council of Australian<br />
Governments, where we can sit down and discuss non-financial matters in things like<br />
education, in railwvays, in coutis, in the micro-economy), in packaging, in standards and all<br />
these other things, are things where co-operativc Fceralisni does mean something in the<br />
hands of good pcoplc and pcopic who want to do things. </p>

So I am very encouraged, naturally I suppose, by the events of the last month, but I'm<br />
particularly encouraged by the circumstances we find ourselves in with thc Government<br />
here In Queensland and in Australia generally.<br />
Let me say a few special words for our friends in the Opposition. don't want to leave<br />
them out. TeNtoaPnyof course, laid a dead hand on Australia for most of the<br />
post-War years. If there is one reason why Australia has got structural problems today it<br />
is because of the hayseeds of thc National Party. Even those rare well springs of<br />
inspiration that might have comne from Libcral Party ministers in Coalition governments<br />
were extinguished by the dead hand of the National Party. Whose view has always been,<br />
and it has been particularly true in education. Michael, Wayne, Linda and I were just at a<br />
Statc Highi School and wvc were talking about the opportunities for kids and the<br />
importance of higher education, tertiary and vocational educat ion. The National Party<br />
were not big on education, they wanted people educated no further than primary school<br />
and then happily voting for the National Party. That was thcir model, the model they<br />
work In. Holding up a TAFE or a univcrsity to the National Party is like some institution<br />
they moved back from. They just don't like what it stands for.<br />
Thc National Party have bccn a force in Queensland. They filled a void, a political void<br />
not a community void, and now their National Party in coalition with the Liberal Party<br />
just don't know what they stand for. They have got no idca what they stand for, they have<br />
not developed any model of Australian society, they don't know where thcy want to see<br />
the place, they don't know how they want to sce it, they are still fighting reas guard actions<br />
on cverything that you Imagine and adopting the most right wing ideology where ever it is<br />
possible. John Hcwson said that if lie was forced to dump the GS1he would resign. Well he was<br />
forced to dump the GST by his party and he is still there. So that means he never meant it<br />
or the GST was just a device. Whatever it means, it means the L. iberal Party is in a state of<br />
ideological and policy chaos.<br />
And we say to the public of Qucensland in the electorate of Dickson don't elect a party<br />
that docsn't know what it wants to do for you. Don't elect a party that not only doesn't<br />
know what it wants to do for you, but of course is not going to be in office.<br />
So this is a time when the conservative forces in this country have got to re-think a<br />
position for Australia beyond thc morbid ideological positions thcy have thought in the<br />
past. Let's hope that they understand that Australia is a country with great opportunities,<br />
that it is a country that will always be best when people are looking up, ilot looking down,<br />
that we can havc progress without pain, we can if we give people the opportunity and put<br />
faith in them, thcy can do good things, and close as we are in the Asia-Pacific where such<br />
opportunities abound and where we have already made inexplicable links, that our future<br />
is as a country which is very proud of its identity and understands what it is and goes to<br />
the world making that clear. </p>
<p>TEL: 7. Apr. 93 17: 20 No. 006 P. 05/ 05<br />
I don't know whether you noticed two days ago in the international press one central<br />
newspaper in China making this very point about Australia saying they are shaking off the<br />
colonial yoke, in all ways Australia is now ready to join the region, we welcome them.<br />
IThis is the point they don't understand. And there they all were the Nats, over at the<br />
school waving their banners half an hour ago, and most of the slogans are all the remnant<br />
issues that thcy will fight to the death as the country moves on.<br />
I say this to the people of Dickson, let's move on.<br />
Leave them behind, they have nothing to offer. Maybe at some point in the future they<br />
will, it is going to be a long way off. The public have made a wise decision in re-electing<br />
the Government, and as a result the Government has taken their mandatc conscientiously<br />
and given them a young, vibrant Cabinct in return and comnmitment to the policies we<br />
espouse and the philosophy of Australian life we espoused in the election campaign.<br />
So I[ can only enjoin them to re-elect Michael LUvarch to the House of Representatives,<br />
and on so doing it would be my great pleasure then to recommend him to the Governor<br />
General as Attorney-General to the Commonwealth so that one of the fastest developing<br />
areas of Brisbane, of Queensland will be represented right in the key forum of the National<br />
Government the Cabinet -and where the State of Qucensland in gencral will find his<br />
representation being enhanced by that very high office.<br />
So to all of you who havc fought the last election and found that you were was scratched<br />
just before the racc, my commiserations, but let's say it was the preparation for a bigger<br />
event, another clection, pcrhaps a more meaningful endorsement of the Labor Party and its<br />
young, talented candidate in the electorate of Dickson.<br />
Thank you. </p>
