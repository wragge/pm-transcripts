COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT.<br />
DIGEST OF DECISIONS<br />
AND ANNOUNCEMENTS<br />
IMPORTANT SPEECHES<br />
BY<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
( THE RIGHT HON. J. B. CHIFLEY). </p>
<p>MIGRATION.<br />
PASSPORTS--RESTRICTIONS, RELAXATIONS.<br />
On 18th June, 1946, the Minister for Immigration ( Mr. Calwell) announced<br />
that restrictions imposed under National Security Act Regulations on the<br />
issue of passports would be lifted from 1st July, 1946. Passports for Japanl<br />
would be excepted. Any person would then be able to secure a passport<br />
to leave Australia by complying with the usual conditions. Restrictions<br />
on the issue of passports to doctors and nurses would be lifted. Previously,<br />
passports had been issued only to doctors and nurses wishing to do postgraduate<br />
courses or gain experience in overseas hospitals. Persons going<br />
to Britain must undertake to remain away for twelve months or until shipping<br />
facilities became available for their return without inconveniencing<br />
persons in the priority classes.<br />
BRITISH MIGRANTS-CHILDREN.<br />
On 2nd July, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
Legal guardianship of British children who were evacuated to Australia<br />
during 1940 for the duration of the war was vested in the Minister for the<br />
Interior ( later changed to the Minister for Immigration), and through him<br />
in the various State Child Welfare Departments under National Security<br />
( Oversea Children) Regulations. Of the 577 children who came to Australia,<br />
over 100 are remaining here, some temporarily to complete educational<br />
courses or apprenticeships and others permanently.<br />
Cabinet decided to-day that, with the expiry of the National Security<br />
Act on 31st December, 1946, legislation be introduced to enable the Minister<br />
for himnigration to continue as the legal guardian of overseas children who<br />
remain in Australia and also as the legal guardian of children brought to Australia<br />
under any governmental or non-governmental immigration organization."<br />

<p>STRIKES-PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH.<br />
In Parliament.-On 4th July, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley)<br />
said-Rightly or wrongly, and I am not entering into that at the moment,<br />
men in Queensland are on strike. I am not attempting to condone the<br />
strike I merely point out that if the men have decided that they will not<br />
work, they cannot be forced by law to go to work. What then is the next<br />
step They may be fined, and if they do not pay the fine they may be<br />
sent to jail. But the application of such a policy has never been successful<br />
in settling an industrial dispute. 1 defy anybody to prove to me that such<br />
action has ever produced industrial peace or effected a settlement of an<br />
industrial dispute. I have been associated with many industrial disputes.<br />
Even if a mistress has a difference with her house-maid, I am expected to<br />
intervene. The Leader of the Country Party ( Mr. Fadden) wants me, on<br />
behalf of the Government, to intervene in the Queensland meat dispute,<br />
Ilthough the State Industrial Court is in control of it and the State Govltenent,<br />
under its emergency powers, is operating the. relevant legislation<br />
to deal with it. What form of intervention does he propose Does he<br />
want me to order the men back to work<br />
I cannot visualize the Commonwealth Government intervening in this<br />
dispute, regrettable though it is. I do not attempt to condone it. The<br />
State Industrial Court, and the State Government with its emergency powers,<br />
has all the law that is needed. Will the enforcement of that law bring<br />
the dispute to an end We know that it will not. Intervention ly tile<br />
Commonrwealth Government would only make confusion worse confounded.<br />
All the parties to the dispute have been strong-minded, and have<br />
hotly supported the stand they have taken. There is too much strongmindedness<br />
in many industrial disputes. I do not deny that I would have<br />
tried to induce the parties to come together. I could not, of course,<br />
approach the Industrial Court. I do not know whether the State Government<br />
or the Premier would be able to make any approach to the court,<br />
because it has made the declaration, You must go back to work before<br />
we shall do ; nything'. The employers say, We will not meet you until<br />
you go back to work The reply of the employees is, We will not return<br />
to work except under pre-strike conditions'. Mr. Fadden has urged that<br />
the Commonwealth Government should intervene because of the influence<br />
that is being wielded by Communists. I have received hundreds of telegrams<br />
from those whom he has described as Communists, asking me to<br />
intervene in total disregard of the State Industrial Court and the State<br />
Government. To do that would be to destroy the effect of the Queensland<br />
law and the judgment of the Industrial Court; not that that would worry<br />
me very much, because I believe that there are some faults on that side.<br />
In my opinion, had the employers been prepared to give way a little, the<br />
strike could have been settled.<br />
Mr. Fadden wants me to override the State Industrial Court and the<br />
State Government, by the exercise of a power possessed by the Common.-<br />
wealth in other words, to flout the Queensland law and the State court.<br />
We have been unable to discern in what way any law that we could operate<br />
would be more effective than the laws which the Queensland Government </p>
<p>has the power to operate. Their application, of course, does not get the<br />
men back to work. There a great deal that I could say about the dispute<br />
but I do not waut to add fuel to the fire. I have been very disappointed<br />
at the trend of events. As a matter of fact, almost every day since I<br />
returned front abroad I have been told that negotiations were proceeding<br />
, and that the dispute would be settled. Yet it has dragged on from day to<br />
day. I do not want Mr. Fadden or this House to believe that I am happy<br />
about the position. If the Commonwealth were to engage in a fight not<br />
nily with the strikers, but also, if you like, with the'employers, the Queensland<br />
Government and the State Industrial Court, the state cf affairs would<br />
be akin to legislative anarchy. Had the Commonwealth Government issued<br />
an order stating that the meat-workers should return to work under prestrike<br />
conditions, the order would have been obeyed. But that would<br />
have been a complete flouting of the Queensland Industrial Court. It<br />
would have 1le e totally at variance withl the wishes of the State Government<br />
; aid would have been violently opposed by the employers. Merely because<br />
we did not wish to flout other laws that were operating in respect of the<br />
matter, such an order was not issued.<br />
The matter does not involve a return to work at award rates.<br />
Apparently, some agreements between the employers and employees have<br />
been operating for a period of years, giving to the employees considerable<br />
benefits which are not provided for in the award. At least, that claim is<br />
made by the employers and the court. The matter does not . touch the<br />
tour men who were dismissed from their employment in a bacon factory.<br />
I believe that their dispute could have been settled by the court separately.<br />
The Communists, near-Communists, or Cryptos-call them what you willare<br />
the very people who have been asking us to step in and override the<br />
State laws by saying to the employees, ' Go back to work on pre-strike<br />
conditions The dispute is most unfortunate. I do not make any apology,<br />
nor does the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Scullv), for having asked the<br />
Meat Controller to see whether personal contact would produce a better<br />
feeling and result in the men returning to work.<br />
We cannot drive men back to work. They are really in no different<br />
position from that of the milk producers who refused to supply milk. Men<br />
have the right to refuse to work. I admit that it is unjust to the community.<br />
In the final analysis, I suppose men have the right to dispose<br />
of their labour just as the man who produces wheat or any other commodity<br />
has the right to dispose of it.<br />
I believe that if suitable action had been taken to bring employers and<br />
employees together a settlement might have been reached long ago. However,<br />
I cannot see why the Commonwealth Government should attempt to<br />
override the State Industrial Court in opposition to the State Government,<br />
, or why we should attempt to override the State emergency legislation."<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT-FIGURES.<br />
In Parliament.-On 4th July, 1946, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction<br />
( Mr. Dedman) said-<br />
The total number of persons unemployed in Australia on 21st June,<br />
1946, was 11,100, about 60 per cent. of whom were receiving unemployment </p>
<p>benefit. The other 40 per cent. were receiving a re-employment allowance<br />
as ex-servicemen while awaiting employment in the type of work thrlv<br />
desired." PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.<br />
POULTRY FARMING-EGGS, CONTROL, CESSATION FIXED.<br />
On 19th June, 1946, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Scully) announced<br />
that the control of the egg industry under National Security Act Regulations<br />
would continue in operation until 31st December, 1946, when the Act expired.<br />
It was previously proposed that control should cease on 30th June, 1946,<br />
in view of the establishment of a central organization by the several State<br />
Egg Marketing Boards known as Egg Boards of Australia Limited which<br />
intended to take over control of the industry as from 1st July, 1946.<br />
Circumstances precluded the company from commencing operations and he<br />
had authorized continuance of Commonwealth control until 31st December.<br />
1946, before which date the position regarding the organization should he<br />
clarified. EXPORTS TO BRITAIN--EGGS.<br />
On 19th June, 1946, Mr. Scully announced that exports to the British<br />
Ministry of Food from Ist July to 31st December, 1946, would be 1,000,000<br />
cases of eggs, equivalent to 30,000,000 dozen eggs as well as about 20,000,0C. 1<br />
lb. of frozen egg pulp, equivalent to nearly 17,000,000 dozen eggs.<br />
COTTON-BOUNTY.<br />
On 2nd July, 1946, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Fraser) said that<br />
the Raw Cotton Bounty Act would expire on 31st December, 1946, and the<br />
Government had decided to introduce legislation to extend the operation<br />
of the Act sc that producers would be guaranteed that the present net<br />
return of 15d. per lb. of raw cotton above the grade known as strict good<br />
ordinary" would be continued on cotton produced in Australia during<br />
1947 and each year until 31st December, 1951. The guaranteed net returns<br />
would be computed after taking into account the net return from by-products<br />
of raw cotton. Raw cotton of '. strict good ordinary" or lower grades<br />
would continue to receive bounty at half the appropriate rate as provided<br />
under the Act. The bounty had been extended subject to'the Queensland<br />
Government making every endeavour to implement undertakings given<br />
during 1939-40 to improve the efficiency of cotton growing.<br />
PARLIAMENT.<br />
BROADCASTING-BILL INTRODUCED.<br />
In Parliament.-On 19th June, 1946, the Postmaster-General ( Senator<br />
Cameron) introduced the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Bill.<br />
Senator Cameron said-<br />
The broadcasting of the proceedings of the Commonwealth Parliament<br />
has received the careful consideration of the Government, and it has decided<br />
that arrangements be made for these broadcasts to be introduced during </p>
<p>tihe present session. Investigations have demonstrated that it is not<br />
practicable to ( establish a separate network of medium-wave stations to<br />
broadcast the proceedings of Parliament. In any case, the establishment<br />
of such a network would involve an expenditure in the neighbourhood of<br />
' 500,000. The Goverunment considers that it would be preferable to commence<br />
the service on some modified plan which would not cause so much disturbanice<br />
to existing programme arrangements. The Government has reached<br />
the conclusion that the service should be commenced on an experimental<br />
basis, the broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings being confined at the<br />
outset to the second national station in the capital city of each State and<br />
in Newca: ttle. If, as expected, the innovation proves acceptable to the<br />
public, it will 1) 0bnee cessary to determine from time to time the extent to<br />
which the facilities it is intended to use at first should be expanded. Accordingly,<br />
provision has been made in the bill for the employment of such of the<br />
other national stations as may be prescribed. Consideration would, of<br />
course, be given to the use of short-wave stations.<br />
The Government holds the. view that control of the broadcasts should<br />
lie exercised by Parliament itself through a joint parliamentary committee.<br />
The bill accordingly provides for the appointment of a committee including<br />
the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.<br />
It will be appreciated that there are a number of details to be settled in connexion<br />
with the apportionment of broadcasting time between both Houses<br />
of the Parliament when they are sitting simultaneously, and in regard to<br />
the rights of members, technical and programme arrangements. It is the<br />
Government's desire that the joint committee should examine all these<br />
questions and recommend to Parliament the general principles on which<br />
the broadcasts should be undertaken. After the adoption of its recommendations<br />
by both Houses, the joint committee will control the subsequent<br />
arrangements. From tinm'' to time questions may arise which will require<br />
prompt attention and it is desirable that the joint committee should have<br />
authority to delegate, to a sub-committee, its powers to determine the days<br />
on which, and the periods during which, the proceedings of either House<br />
shall be broadcast.<br />
" The Government accepts the view that the immunities and privileges<br />
applying to debates within Parliament should be extended to the broadcasts<br />
parliamentary proceedings.<br />
The Bill embraces the foregoing conclusions and, in anticipation of<br />
it being acceptable to Parliament, arrangements have been made, with the<br />
concurrence of the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House<br />
of Representatives, for the erection of a control booth in each House and for<br />
the installation of such equipment as is necessary to enable the broadcasts<br />
to be undertaken. It should be practicable to commence the broadcasting<br />
of parliamentary proceedings before the end of the present session, the actual<br />
' late being determined'by the joint committee, which will be selected as<br />
; oon as the measure becomes law." </p>
<p>In Parliament.-On 20th June, 1946, Senator Cameron moved the<br />
following amendment:-<br />
One of the members of the committee shall be the President of the Senate, one<br />
member shall be the Speaker of the Hou.' e of Representatives, and, of the other four<br />
members of the committee, two shall be members of, and appointed by, the Senate<br />
and two shall be members of, and appointed by, the House of Representatives.<br />
[ The amendlment w~ is carried.]<br />
In Parliament.-On 4th July, 1946, the Minister for Information ( Mr.<br />
Calwell) moved an amendment to the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting<br />
Bill to provide that the Joint Committee on the broadcasting of<br />
parliamentary proceedings -hlould comprise nine members inst-:: r! of six.<br />
[ The amendment was carried and, later, was carried in the Senate.]<br />
[ The bill was passed.]<br />
In Parliament.-On 5th July, 1946, the Speaker ( Mr. Roscvear), chairman,<br />
the President ( Senator Brown), Senators Arnold and Gib-, o, Messrs.<br />
Corser, Fraser, Haylen, Holt and Sheehan were appointed members of thl<br />
Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings.<br />
In Parliament.-On 5th July, 1946, the Joint Committee submitted the<br />
following report:-<br />
Days on which proceedings shall be broadcast: The proceedings of Parliament.<br />
shall be broadcast on each day on which either House is sitting.<br />
Period during which proceedings shall be broadcast: The broadcast shall commence<br />
on each sitting day at the time fixed for the meeting of the House whose opening<br />
proceedings are to be broadcast on that day as determined by the Joint Committee.<br />
and shall cease when the adjournment is moved in the House which is being broadcast<br />
at that time.<br />
Allocation of broadcasting time between the Senate and tie House of Representatives:<br />
The allocation of broadcasting time between the Senate and the House of Representatives<br />
shall be in accordance with the views of the Joint Committee, or its sub-committee,<br />
on the importance of the impending debate and the public interest attaching thereto.<br />
The committee recognizes that in practice more time will be allotted to the House of<br />
Representatives than to the Senate.<br />
Re-broadcast of questions without notice and answers Within the limits of time<br />
available, questions without notice and answers in each House shall be re-broadcast<br />
between 7.20 p. m. and 7.55 p. m. on each sitting day.<br />
Broadcast and re-broadcast through national stations: No broadcast or re.<br />
broadcast of the proceedings of either House shall be made except through national<br />
broadcasting stations unless the Joint Committee otherwise determines.<br />
[ The report was adopted.]<br />
PRIVILEGE-PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS.<br />
In Parliament.--On 4th July, 1946, the Acting Attorney-General<br />
( Mr. Holloway) introduced the Parliamentary Papers Bill. Mr. Holloway<br />
said-This bill proposes to give absolute protection against civil or criminal<br />
proceedings, for example proceedings for libel, in respect of the publication<br />
under the authority of a parliamentary committee of any document laid<br />
before the committee or of any evidence given befo: re the committee.<br />
The Parliamentary Papers Act, which the bill proposes to amend, provides,<br />
amongst other things, that no action or proceedings, civil or criminal<br />
shall lie against any person for publishing any document published under<br />
the authority of the Senate or the House of Representatives. Tlhe act does<br />
not apply to publication under the authority of a parliamentary committee </p>
<p>but where the evidence given before a parliamentary committee is tabled<br />
in either House of the Parliament and ordered by that House to be printed<br />
the protection given by the act applies.<br />
However, when evidence is tabled and ordered to be printed, a large<br />
number of copies must be printed to meet the requirements of the circulation<br />
list for parliamentary papers. For example, on the tabling of the report<br />
of the Standing Committee on Broadcasting regarding proposed staff<br />
regulations for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the number of<br />
copies printed was 660. It is considered that the expense of printing the<br />
weidence before parliamentary committees as a parliamentary paper is not<br />
always justified. As an instance, the Standing Committee on Broadcasting<br />
considers that the number of copies of the evidence given before it which,<br />
generally speaking, need be printed is about 40. I feel sure that where a<br />
committee itself arranges the publication of evidence before it with the<br />
object of saving public money, it should not be deprived of the protection<br />
of the Parliamentary Papers Act. It may be that the publication is already<br />
privileged either at common law or by virtue of section 49 of the Commonwealth<br />
Constitution, but it is considered desirable to put the matter beyond<br />
doubt. The bill is designed to achieve this object and applies to documents<br />
; nd evidene, published after 23rd September, 1943." [ The bill was passed.]<br />
ENEMY ALIENS.<br />
OVERSEAS INTERNEES-INQUIRY, MR. JUSTICE SIMPSON'S<br />
REPORT.<br />
In Parliament.-On 19th June, 1946, the Minister for Immigration<br />
Calwell) said-<br />
Mr. Justice Simpson was appointed by the Government to inquire<br />
into the cases of a number of enemy aliens who were still being held in<br />
internment. He was asked to report to the Government as to which<br />
persons should be released to remain in residence in this country, and as<br />
to which persons should be repatriated to their homelands. The Government<br />
has decided to carry out Mr. Justice Simpson's recommendations in<br />
their entirety. A number of perons are being held in internment pending<br />
repatriation they will be repatriated as soon as shipping is available.<br />
If shipping is not available before the expiration of the National Security<br />
Act, special legislation will be enacted to enable me to give effect to<br />
Mr. Justice Simpson's recommendations."<br />
On 2nd July, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
When the National Security Act ceases on 31st December, 1946, there<br />
will be no power by which enemy aliens interned during the war and whose<br />
repatriation has been recommended by a Supreme Court judge in the<br />
interests of public safety and the defence of the Commonwealth can be<br />
repatriated. Further, because of lack of shipping, it may not be possible<br />
to give effect to the judge's recommendatious before the act expires.<br />
S" Cabinet to-day decided that the Minister for Immigration ( Mr. Calwell)<br />
prepare a bill to provide for the repatriation of aliens who were interned </p>
<p>during the war and after an inquiry by a judicial authority are deemed to<br />
be a menace to the security of the Commonwealth the control of the movements<br />
of aliens interned during the war and released while awaiting<br />
repatriation following a judicial inquiry which deemed them to be a menace<br />
to the security of the Commonwealth and the repatriation of aliens who,<br />
after a judicial inquiry, are deemed to be a danger to the security of the<br />
Commonwealth." NATIONAL UNIVERSITY.<br />
BILL INTRODUCED.<br />
In PI'rliaentl.--On 19th June, 1946, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction<br />
( Mr. Dedman) introduced the Australian National University<br />
Bill. Mr. Dedman said--<br />
The Government is anxious that the national university which this<br />
bill seeks to establish should be established in such manner that it will bring<br />
credit to Australia, advance the cause of learning and research in general,<br />
and take its rightful place among the great universities of the world. For<br />
this reason I will sympathetically consider any amendment, with th,.<br />
object of helping the university achieve these ends.<br />
" Australia has gained a justifiably high reputation in university<br />
teaching and research, and the Government believes that the establishment<br />
of an Australian national university at Canberra will bring still further<br />
credit to our country, not only by the work done within its own walls by its<br />
own staff and research students, but also by collaboration and co-operation<br />
between its members and the research workers and teachers of the other<br />
Australian universities. With the help and encouragement of other<br />
universities, anid of all men and women'of good will, the national university<br />
will soon be in a px: ition to take its share in solving many complex problems<br />
which are the joint responsibility of all universities.<br />
The establishment of a university is a matter of considerable complexity<br />
and a very great responsibility. For this reason the Government<br />
has not acted hastily. I have discussed the problems involved with the<br />
Minister for the Interior ( Mr. Johnson), with other Ministers concerned.<br />
with the Vice-Chancellors of the Universities of Sydney and Melbourne<br />
and with groups of distinguished scientists who have been called together<br />
by the Inter-Departmental Committee on Education to advise on the<br />
general and detailed questions associated with this project. In addition.<br />
the Government has had the help and advice of the Canberra University<br />
College Council.<br />
The essence of democratic government is that all national issues must<br />
ultimately be decided by the people themselves. To me it is more than<br />
ever important at tais stage in Australia's development that the Australian<br />
people should have available everything they need to permit their decisions<br />
to be made wisely and after a full understanding of the issues involved.<br />
Both in Australia and in the world at large, innumerable problems await<br />
solution if the future is to be made safe and the people placed in a position<br />
to enjoy the fruits of the developments in science and in human relationships<br />
during the last six years. The first thing that must be done is to </p>
<p>ensure that these developments are studied in relation particularly to their<br />
. Lpplication in Australia. Progress in physical science has culminated in<br />
the harnessing of atomic energy and this has brought the world to its final<br />
crossroads. Mishandled, these discoveries in the physical world can make<br />
peace and prosperity impossible. Properly used' they may introduce an<br />
era of happiness and prosperity unparalleled in world history. It is essential<br />
that Australia, in common with the other nations of the world, should do<br />
ieverything possible to foster that careful research which will allow us to<br />
become the masters, not the servants, of our physical environment. In<br />
medicine, too, the outstanding achievements of the war years await full and<br />
proper application to the civil needs of our people. Once again this implies<br />
patient research by all the talent at our disposal and demands the establishnient<br />
of appropriate institutions at which this research may be conducted.<br />
The Government feels that the university now proposed for Canberra is<br />
nHe appropriate place in which this research may be carried out. On the<br />
side of human relationships, our continued development, and a full under-<br />
-tanding of our problems, requires that we encourage research into the<br />
social sciences. Here, more than in any other field of learning, Australia<br />
lhas an outstanding contribution to make to the world at large. In<br />
economics, history, law, anthropology, and in all the related social sciences,<br />
Australia i n a particularly advantageous position.<br />
We lave also greatly increased responsibility to shoulder in relation<br />
to other people, and particularly to those with whom we are associated<br />
aI a Pacific power. The whole field of Pacific studies awaits fuller development<br />
than it has previously received in Australia. Our relations with the<br />
East, with the Americas, with the East Indies, New Zealand, New Guinea<br />
, ad all the Pacific islands, must be carefully studied so that they may<br />
l,' come friondly and fruitful if our future is to be safeguarded and if we<br />
to make our full contri! bution in the councils of the nations. Here,<br />
iur opportunities are unique. Our remoteness enables us to consider the<br />
fundamental issues involved, free from the day to day fears and turmoil<br />
tliht beset, many of the great Powers. For that reason we have a duty<br />
to the world at large which we must recognize if we are to be accepted as<br />
a world Power.<br />
The Iill is very straightforward and needs little amplification. It<br />
follows in broad outline the general plan of government which operates<br />
successfully in other universities, both in Australia and overseas. It will<br />
be noted that the functions of the university lay particular stress on postgraduate<br />
research and the research schools of immediate importance to<br />
Australia are set out, but nothing in the bill prevents the establishment<br />
of other research schools that may appear essential to the governing body<br />
f the university. It is recognized that facilities must be made available<br />
in Canberra to meet the increasing needs for undergraduate studies anud<br />
for special training for officers of government departments and provision<br />
is made to enablb this to be done.<br />
The governing authority of the university is to be council consisting<br />
of not more than 30 members and to be composed partly of elected members<br />
and partly of members appointed by the Govcrnor-General and by the </p>
<p>Parliament. The university must be free to administer its own affairs<br />
without any pressure from outside, otherwise decisions on highly complex<br />
technical matters may be taken which are not in the best interests of the<br />
university, and which may prevent it from carrying out its work efficiently.<br />
The appropriate safeguards against such outside interference are contained<br />
in the bill which specifically refers all matters connected with the<br />
government of the university to the council.<br />
" I do not anticipate that the university will be in full operation for<br />
some time, but it is essential that as much basic planning as possible be<br />
completed so that the necessary plans can be laid for buildings and other<br />
essential work. The acute shortage of labour and materials for building<br />
will prevent an immediate start being made on any accommodation for the<br />
university. I propose that the bill be amended to permit the appointment<br />
of an interim council to carry out the work of the council until that body<br />
can be properly constituted and appointed, and in particular to undertake<br />
the preliminary work relating to the planning of the university.<br />
The Government is concerned that the university should be able to<br />
plan ahead, particularly cn its research side, and I propose to provide the<br />
university with a grant which will be reviewed every five years rather than<br />
to leave it dependent on the funds voted annually by Parliament. The<br />
Government proposes to make available in the first five years, commencing<br />
with the financial year 1951-52, the sum of œ 325,000 a year. The amount<br />
will be reviewed every five years thereafter. In the period before July,<br />
1951, such amount will be made available, to a maximum of œ 325,000 a<br />
year, as is actually needed to meet running expenses. The Government<br />
will provide sufficient funds to enable the university to start with buildings<br />
worthy of the objects for which they are built and in keeping with the best<br />
types of architecture in the Capital Territory. Accordingly the Government<br />
has approved œ 872,500 for buildings for the university. This amount<br />
will not be required immediately, nor will it be drawn from any one budget.<br />
The vice-chancellor, as the administrative head of the university,<br />
will be, in many ways, the key member of its staff. In the first instance,<br />
it is proposed that the vice-chancellor be appointed by the Governor-<br />
General for five years. All subsequent appointments to that office will<br />
be made by the council. It is vital that the vice-chancellor be a man of<br />
outstanding administrative ability, and, if possible, of high academic<br />
standing. I believe that he must at all costs secure men of world reputation<br />
to supervise the work of the various research schools." [ The bill was passed.]<br />

MEMBERS RE-APPOINTED.<br />
On 20th June, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) announced that<br />
Dr. L. H. Allen ( chairman), Prof. J. F. M. Haydon and Mr. K. Binns had<br />
been re-appointed members of the Literature Censorship Board for three<br />
years from 25th June, 1946. Sir Robert Garran had been re-appointed<br />
Appeal Censor for the same period from the same date.<br />

POST-WAR-RIFLE CLUBS.<br />
In Parlirmeni.-On 20th June, 1946, the Minister for the Army ( Mr.<br />
Forde) said--<br />
The Government has authorized the re-establishment of rifle clubs as<br />
from 1st July, 1946. The departmental organization for the administration<br />
of the rifle club movement will be on the lines in force before 1931, when<br />
the rifle clubs were a civil movement under the Department of Defence.<br />
POST-WAR-BRITISH COMMONWEALTH CONFERENCE.<br />
On 27th June, 1946, the acting Minister for Defence ( Mr. Forde)<br />
announced that Lieutenant-Generals S. F. Rowell, C. A. Clowes and F. H.<br />
Berrvnan, and Brigadier R. King would attend a defence conference of the<br />
commanders-in-chief of all British army commands at home and overseas<br />
and of representatives of the Dominions in Britain in August, 1946.<br />
WOOL.<br />
MANUFACTURES-SUBSIDY.<br />
On 20th June, 1946, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Fraser) announced<br />
that subsidy would be paid to maintain existing prices of wool to Australian<br />
manufacturers for utilization in goods for domestic consumption, when<br />
auction sales recommenced after 30th June, 1946. The purpose of the<br />
subsidy was to enable Australian manufacturers to compete with overseas<br />
buyers in a manner that will avoid interference with normal auction purchases.<br />
Subsidies would be paid to manufacturers to re-imburse any excess<br />
paid in purchasing at prices for domestic consumption but not in excess<br />
of the average market level for individual wool types at a series of auction<br />
sales. That ensured that manufacturers would not bid extravagantly on<br />
the assumption that the Conunmmonwealth Government would meet deficiencies<br />
resulting from unlimited bidding.<br />
WHEAT STABILIZATION SCHEME.<br />
POST-WAR-BILL INTRODUCED.<br />
In Parliament.-On 20th June, 1946, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr.<br />
Scully) introduced the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill. Mr. Scully<br />
said-Wheat has been a troubled industry for many years. For a decade<br />
before the war, it was frequently in a depressed condition and constant<br />
assistance from governments was. required. Prices were low and growers </p>
<p>could not obtain a reasonable living from their labour. Other wheatproducing<br />
countries were in a similar plight, and wheat presented the<br />
world's greatest agricultural problem. The need for stabilization in Australia<br />
was recognized, but it is beyond the power of any Commonwealth<br />
Iovernment to stabilize the industry. Joint action by all Australian<br />
governments is necessary, because both States and Commonwealth are<br />
vitally affected by matters concerning the wheat inditstry. Although the<br />
prcblem is old, to date it has not been possible to get agreement on a plan,<br />
and the method of operating it.<br />
The bill is intended to give security to the wheat industry in Australia.<br />
It provides growers with a guaranteed minimum price for wheat for five<br />
years, and has the machinery to maintain minimum price guarantees as a<br />
permanent feature. The effect will be to remove the feature which disturbed<br />
the industry most in the past; that is, the impact of unduly low<br />
prices. It will be replaced by a system under which wheat farmers will<br />
know, for a period of years in advance, that they will receive a definite<br />
price for their wheat. They can plan their farm programme with an assured<br />
return, and with the knowldge that they will not be ruined by market<br />
changes which cannot be foreseen or controlled. The stabilization proposals<br />
represent the considered judgment of governments and growers, first, as to<br />
the measures needed for tlh industry, and, second, as to the best way to<br />
effect them. Co-operation with the States is an essential part of the plan.<br />
The States control production, and production must be regulated according<br />
to the markets available for our wheat. In marketing, Commonwealth and<br />
States must use their constitutional powers in harmony if the plan is to be<br />
effective; neither can provide effective marketing unaided. In the plan<br />
now proposed. the States have shown their willingness to co-operate with<br />
the Commonwealth. It has been discussed in detail with State Gove lnmn.-<br />
its, and they have agreed to bring complementary legislation befdre<br />
their parliaments. The Government has consulted wheat-growers' organizations.<br />
The' plan was discussed with the Wheat Growers' Federation in<br />
December, 1945, and growers' views on its details were then expounded<br />
fully. The various points stressed received consideration and it has been<br />
possible to meet them in full. The bill represents the greatest practicable<br />
measure of co-operation between governments and growers to settle the<br />
problem of the wheat industry.<br />
The plan provides a miinimum guaranteed price for wheat for the<br />
period 1945-46 to 1949-50. It provides for review during the currency<br />
of the scheme, with a view to its extension beyond the five years. Growers<br />
will contribute to ai stabilization fund, when prices are high, and the<br />
contribution will be not more than 50 per cent. of the excess of the export<br />
price above the guaranteed minimum price. The Commonwealth will<br />
meet any deficiency in any one year should the stabilization fund become<br />
exhausted. A central marketing organization will be responsible for the<br />
marketing of the Australian wheat crop, and production will be regulated<br />
in accordance with thl markets available. The guaranteed price for the<br />
seasons 1945-46 to 19,19-50, is 5s. 2d. a bushel f. o. r. ports for f. a. q. bagged<br />
wheat. This miinimum will apply to the whole of the marketed crops. </p>
<p>At present, a home-consumption price applies to wheat used locally for<br />
flour. This will be extended to cover other wheat used locally. There is;<br />
in addition, the very important point of the guarantee for export wheat.<br />
Control over local wheat prices is always possible, but the grower will now<br />
get protection against slumps which have been a regular feature of world<br />
markets, and the Commonwealth will take a financial risk to give that<br />
protection. It is intended that the guaranteed price will apply for five<br />
seasons, but, . before the period is up, the plan will be reviewed, and a fresh<br />
guarantee given for a further period. The intention is to have regular<br />
reviews, and to maintain always a guaranteed price for some seasons ahead.<br />
The first period has been fixed as a reasonable period of security and a<br />
reasonable period for a fixed commitment. The guaranteed price is the<br />
minimum return, and growers will get more when export prices are high.<br />
They are given a definite floor price.<br />
A contribution from growers is provided for. It is considered that,<br />
in principle, a government guarantee, which is really a guarantee from the<br />
taxpayer should be accompanied by contributions from growers when<br />
prices are high. This principle is accepted by growers and a 50-50 contribution<br />
is generally conceded to be fair. When prices are high, growers will<br />
contribute up to 50 per cent. of the excess above the guaranteed price of<br />
export wlheat. The money so subscribed will go into a stabilization fund,<br />
and will be used to meet the guarantee when prices fall. The fund will<br />
be a trust fund. There is no intention of building up an excessively large<br />
fund, and, if prices remain higher than is now expected, the contribution<br />
will be reduced below 50 per cent. The effect is that growers will make a<br />
reasonable but not an excessive contribution, and the Commonwealth will<br />
meet the guarantee if a run of low prices exhausts the fund. This means<br />
that growers will share in the extra amounts from high price years, and are<br />
assured in advance against a price below 5s. 21.<br />
It is not proposed, that returns shall be permanently out of line with<br />
the export price, nor that the industry will be continually subsidized. Twothirds<br />
of our wheat goes on to the export market, and we must compete<br />
with other countries for our markets. The plan gives time for adjustments<br />
to meet changing world conditions, and it protects growers against a rapid<br />
fall on the export market. It cannot relieve them of the need to meet<br />
world competition in the export trade. It is hoped, however, that an<br />
effective internatiolal agreement will protect . export markets in future.<br />
For the next five years, come what may in the export field, growers are<br />
guaranteed against the effect of a world slump. They will not receive in<br />
any one of the five years less than 5s. 2d.<br />
The difficulties of making a guarantee effective can hardly be overcome<br />
without a central organization for marketing. A wheat board will be set<br />
up to handle and sell the crops with the benefits of war-time experience<br />
and of an efficient organization. The board will succeed the war-time Wheat<br />
Board and carry on its -work. In its new set-up it will operate under joint<br />
powers conferred by Commonwealth and States, and the statutory power<br />
to operate will relate almost entirely to wheat covered by the State acts.<br />
Regulation of production is a part of the plan in which action would<br />
be impossible without full State co-operation. The long history of wheat </p>
<p>gluts and wheat shortages has shown how easy it is to go from one extreme<br />
to the other. Wheat gluts build up fast, and the low prices which result<br />
have had a disastrous effect in past years on wheat farmers here and overseas.<br />
Over-production must be avoided in the future. We wish to produce all<br />
the wheat we reasonably can, and to sell it at a price fair to growers and<br />
consumers. We want to avoid temporary high-price expansion in the<br />
industry which would leave it over-capitalized and unable to carry on when<br />
prices recede. Deliberate regulation according to markets available is a<br />
new departure, but it offers the best prospect for avoiding a return to the<br />
disastrous see-saw from glut to scarcity. It may seem odd at present to<br />
be thinking of regulating wheat production. Australia is now trying to<br />
produce the maximum crop and to supply everything possible to meet overseas<br />
needs. But we must prepare for whatever may come in the future,<br />
and it is likely that, within a short time, a wheat glut may recur. If it<br />
does, farmers will again be faced with depression, and precautions against<br />
that must be taken now.<br />
Normal pre-war basis of production can be maintained and it will be<br />
practicable to include in the industry soldier settlers and farmers' sons.<br />
I hope that conditions of world trade in the years to come will give an<br />
outlet for all the wheat which Australia can produce. If so, there will be<br />
room for expansion to the limit of economic productive capacity. It must,<br />
however, be realized that farmers cannot go into the wheat industry one<br />
season, and out of it the next. Once in it, they are committed to heavy<br />
outlay and years of production. Boom years are a menace because of the<br />
danger of high land prices and over-capitalized farms, leading to a financial<br />
structure which is not able to meet low or medium price years. For that<br />
reason, the production basis must be decided with the greatest care. The<br />
plan is intended to make the wheat industry sound financially. Regublltion<br />
Sof production-not restriction of production-has been recognized over<br />
the years us one requisite for any plan. That is recognized not only by<br />
governmnts but by the growers; and growers are willing to co-operate<br />
in regulation of the industry to secure the wide benefits of stabilization.<br />
Regulation of production was brought in as a war-time measure, and now<br />
can readily be adapted to peace-time needs. It is a State function, and<br />
Commonwealth and States will co-operate to secure uniformity in administration.<br />
There aire two Commoniwealth bills, and complementary legislation<br />
will be necessary in each State. It is considered the State legislation can<br />
be covered by one act, and one object of the discussions was to secure<br />
uniformity among the States. The Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill<br />
provides the mechanism for carrying out the plan I have outlined, and for<br />
co-operating with the States in all necessary matters. The Wheat Export<br />
Charge Bill completes the work by providing for the charge which forms the<br />
Urowers' contribution to the hill. Difficult problems will be met in administration.<br />
I am confident that they will be overcome by the partnership of<br />
Commonwealth and States.<br />
The Wheat Charges Bill, to be introduced later, provides for a maximum<br />
contribution of 50 per cent., or a lower rate if prescribed, of the difference<br />
between the guaranteed price of 5s. 2d. and the average export price in </p>
<p>; any one year or such part of the export price as is prescribed. It is proposed<br />
for the 1945--46 crop, that the contribution be 50 per cent. of the difference<br />
between 5s. 2d. and 9s. 6d. bagged. The average export return isestimated<br />
to be ] 0s. Growers will be paid from the pool on the following basis:-<br />
2d. a bushel for domestically consumed wheat, and for export wheat<br />
2d. a bushel plus 50 per cent. of the difference between 5s. 2d., the guaranteed<br />
price, and 9s. 6d.-which is 2s. 2d. and a further 6d. on export<br />
wheat, this being the difference between 10s. and 9s. 6d. It is estimated<br />
that, for the whole of the wheat marketed local and export, the grower will<br />
receive 6s. 7d. a bushel f. o. r. at ports bagged.<br />
Summarized, the two bills provide-<br />
The preservation over five years of a price of 5s. 2d. a bushel f. o. r. at ports. bagged<br />
for all wheat consumed within Australia.<br />
A guarantee by the Government of a minimum price for export of 5s. 2d. a bushel<br />
f. o. r. at ports bagged.<br />
When the export price exceeds the guaranteed price, growers to contribute to a<br />
fund to an amount not exceeding 50 per cent. of the difference between the export price<br />
and the guaranteed price of 5s. 2d.<br />
When the export price falls below 5s. 2d., the fund will be called upon to provide<br />
the amount necessary to bring the export price up to 5s. 2d.<br />
If and when the fund is exhausted in any one year, the Government under its<br />
guarantee will provide, out of general revenue, the funds necessary to bring export prices<br />
up to 5s. 2d.<br />
For the 1945-46 crop, the Government proposes that the grower will be paid on<br />
export wheat 5s. 2d., plus 2s. 2d., plus the excess of export returns over 9s. 6d. Under<br />
this arrangement, it is calculated that, for the whole of his sales, export and local, the<br />
grower will receive 6s. 7d. a bushel f. o. r. at ports bagged.<br />
The scheme, including the guarantee, is to operate for five years. During its<br />
: urrency, however, reviews will be made with a view to continuing it under conditions<br />
which may or may not be revised, beyond five years.<br />
The plan is designed to provide for stabilized returns over a period of years. Funds<br />
will be held on account of growers in years of high prices and paid out in years of low<br />
prices. But the Government underwrites the scheme to the extent of guaranteeing<br />
that, whatever be the rise or fall of the market over five years, the farmer will get a<br />
return not less than 5s. 2d. a bushel f. o. r. bagged at ports. [ The bill was passed.]<br />

EXTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS.<br />
FUTURE POLICY-TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BILL INTRODUCED.<br />
In Parliament.-On 20th June, 1946, the Minister for Information<br />
( Mr. Calwell) introduced the Overseas Telecommunications Bill. Mr.<br />
Calwell said-<br />
This bill deals with the transfer to national ownership of the external<br />
telecommunication services now owned and operated by Amalgamated<br />
Wireless ( Australasia) Limited and the establishment of a statutory<br />
corporation to operate both radio and cable services linking Australia with<br />
other countries. This bill is one of similar pieces of legislation which will<br />
be enacted by the parliaments of all self-governing countries in the British<br />
Commonwealth and Empire. The step being taken in Australia is part<br />
of a unified plan. recommended by the British Commonwealth Telecominunications<br />
Conference in July and August, 1945. The conference reached<br />
the unanimous conclusion that, to secure the desired strengthening and </p>
<p>better ordering of the British Commonwealth telecommunications system,<br />
a fundamental change in the present organization was necessary. The<br />
conference recommended-<br />
That the private shareholder interest in the ownership of overseas telecommunication<br />
services of Britain, the Dominions and India should be replaced by public ownership.<br />
That the government in each country should acquire the ownership of the telecom.<br />
munication assets in its territories.<br />
That the type of organization established in each country to own and operate the<br />
external telecommunication services should as far as possible be uniform.<br />
That a Commonwealth Telecommunication Board be established to replace the<br />
Commonwealth Communications Council, with functions mainly advisory in character.<br />
but extending to all the national organizations throughout the Empire instead of being<br />
related only to the London organization as under present conditions.<br />
The conference also worked out a system of pooling of net revenues.<br />
in a central fund, from which out-payments for the maintenance of the<br />
board and the maintenance of the submrine cables could be met, after<br />
which the residues would be returned to the respective national bodies.<br />
Legislation to give effect to the recommendations of the conference<br />
has been introduced in the British House of Commons and provides for the<br />
acquisition of the shares of Cable and Wireless Limited, apart from the<br />
2,600,000 shares which it already owns, : nd the payment of compensation<br />
to the shareholders. Another bill is to be introduced later for the establishment<br />
of the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board and for the carrying<br />
into effect of the full scheme recommended by the 1945 conference.<br />
The bill before this House provides for the full implementation of the<br />
recommendations of the conference and the ratification of an overall agreement<br />
in the form set out in the first schedule to the bill. The bill provides<br />
for the establishment in Australia of a government commission as a<br />
corporate body, to acquire the ownership of and to maintain and operate<br />
the overseas telecommunication services at present conducted by Amalgamated<br />
Wireless ( Australasia) Limited and by Cable and Wireless Limited<br />
in the -territories of the Commonwealth of Australia. The commission will<br />
be called the Overseas Telecommunications Commission ( Australia).<br />
Provision is made for the assessment of the compensation which will he<br />
payable to Amalgamated Wireless ( Australasia) Limited. The bill provides<br />
that the amount may be determined by agreement between the commission<br />
and the company. In the event of agreement not being reached, the<br />
amount may be determined by a compensation board. If either party is<br />
dissatisfied with the amount of compensation determined by the board,<br />
an appeal may be made to the High Court. The assets of Cable and Wireless<br />
Limited to be taken over by the commission will be transferred by the<br />
British Govermnent to the commission at an agreed price to be paid in cash<br />
Employees of the two companies who have been exclusively employed<br />
by them on telecommunications in Australia for three years or over, and<br />
for whom suitable employment can be found by the commission, will become<br />
entitled to appointment to positions in the service of the commission, with<br />
preservation of their accrued pension, superannuation, furlough and other<br />
rights. If it is not found possible to re-engage all the employees affected.<br />
it is proposed to come to an arrangement with the companies so that the<br />
employees affected will not be placed at a disadvantage. </p>
<p>The commission will acquire, operate and maintain all the overseas<br />
telecommunication services hitherto owned and operated in Australia by<br />
Cable and Wireless Limited and Amalgamated Wireless ( Australasia)<br />
Limited, including in the latter case the operation of coastal and island<br />
radio stations which handle wireless traffic with ships at sea and similar<br />
traffic exchanged within and between territories of the Commonwealth.<br />
The national corporations throughout the Empire will undertake research<br />
: tad developmental work to improve the efficiency of services. This work<br />
will be co-ordinated by the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board in<br />
London, and that board will also undertake research work on behalf of all<br />
partner governments. It is contemplated that the commission shall, if<br />
so desired by another national body, undertake to act as agent on agreed<br />
terms in maintaining and operating overseas telecommunication services in<br />
regional areas adjacent to Australia.<br />
Power is conferred on the Miiister to approve of any contracts where<br />
-upply, either directly or indirectly, of imported equipment or material<br />
of a value exceeding œ 5,000 is involved. This provision will ensure that<br />
lue consideration is given by the commission to the use of equipment manuf1ctured<br />
in Australia before steps are taken to import material of any<br />
ippreciable value from abroad. The powers conferred on the commission<br />
io not detract in any way from those entrusted to the Minister administering<br />
the Wireless Telegrapliy and the Post and Telegraph Acts.<br />
Conditions under which advances will be made to the commission shall<br />
be determined by the Treasurer. The form in which the commission will<br />
keep its accounts will be subject to the approval of the Treasurer and to<br />
inspection and audit by the Auditor-General. Annual reports and financial<br />
statements of the commission, accompanied by a certificate of the Auditor-<br />
(' cncral. will be submitted to Parliament.<br />
The c-inmluission will arrange free handling of meteorological telegrams<br />
exchanged with ships at sea and of similar messages exchanged between<br />
Commonwealth meteorological offices and stations. The commission will<br />
handle free on behalf of the Post Office other telegrams for transmission<br />
within the Commonwealth in cases cf interruption to land-lines, in return<br />
for which the Post Office will arrange free transmission of messages relating<br />
to the commission's administrative affairs.<br />
The duties and functions of the Commonwealth Telecommunications<br />
Board are set out in detail in the overall agreement which becomes a part<br />
of the bill. The costs of the board are to be met in agreed proportions<br />
from the net revenues of the several national bodies.<br />
In the overall agreement, a form of tripartite agreement is drawn up<br />
for execution in due course by each partner government concerned, the<br />
Commonwealth Telecommunications Board and the local national telecommunications<br />
body. This tripartite agreement defines the relationship<br />
which will exist between the several parties thereto and, in particular, to<br />
mutual responsibilities of the local national body and the Commonwealth<br />
Telecommunications Board. It provides for the establishment of a central<br />
fund into which the national bodies will pay annually their net revenues. </p>
<p>" Of the subscribed capital in Amalgamated Wireless ( Australasia)<br />
Limited, amounting to œ 985,518, the Government owns 500,001 fully paid<br />
shares and private interests 485,517 shares. Under the agreements to which<br />
I have referred the measure of control exercisable by the Government is<br />
incommensurate with its majority shareholding. The agreements are so<br />
greatly in favour of the company that, apart from approval or veto of'<br />
tariffs and the granting or withholding of licences for new services and--<br />
even this later right by the Government has been denied by the company-.<br />
the Government has virtually little or no control at all over the policy of th,<br />
company. Government representation on the Board of Directors is limited<br />
to three out of a total of seven directors constituting the board. Effective<br />
co-ordination and control of overseas telecommunication services in<br />
Australia in the national interest is impracticable of realization so long as<br />
two separate companies own and operate the two respective means of<br />
overseas communication, cable and radio. The transfer of the services of'<br />
both companies to the Government will enable their complete co-ordination<br />
under a single operating authority, and will ultimately enable cheaper rates<br />
to be offered to the users of the services through the avoidance of existing<br />
duplication of effort and of overhead costs resulting from the conduct of<br />
the respective services by two separate undertakings. The acquisition by<br />
the Government of the telecommunication assets of Amalgamated Wireless<br />
( Australasia) Limited will involve a reconstitution of the company to enable<br />
it to continue as a manufacturing, commercial broadcasting and patentholding<br />
sales and servicing organization. The Government proposes to<br />
retain its proportionate shareholding in the reconstituted company, if the<br />
private shareholders of Amalgamated Wireless ( Australasia) Limited so<br />
desire. Provision for this would not be appropriate in this bill, and<br />
suitable steps towards this end will be taken later, if necessary."<br />

On 22nd June, 1946, the Minister for Housing ( Mr. Lazzarini) said that,<br />
because of National Security ( Landlord and Tenant) Regulations, there<br />
had been an overall rental reduction of 14.4 per cent. in shared accommodation<br />

NEW AGREEMENT-JOINT ORGANIZATION, FIRST MEETING..<br />
On 23rd June, 1.946, the Prime Miniister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
" The first meetings of the Dominion and British directors of United<br />
Kingdom-Dominion Wool Disposals Limited have been held in London.<br />
The company has been entrusted by the Governments of Britain, Australia,<br />
New Zealand and South Africa with the double task of effecting orderl * y<br />
disposal of accumulated war-time surpluses of wool and at the same tim' 4<br />
maintaining anl appropriate degree of stability in prices.<br />
It will attempt to achieve the first objective by offerinc, at auctionl<br />
its stocks of wool alongside current clips in accordance with supply and<br />
demand in the world's markets and to achieve the second objective by<br />
regulation of offerings and by means of reserve ' prices at which it will be<br />
prepared to buy in growers' wool at auction. It will, at all times, endeavour<br />
to act impartially towards tbe interests of the various parts affected or<br />
likely to be affected by its decisions and the company makes the following<br />
preliminary announcement:<br />
His Majesty's Governments in Britain, Australia, New Zealand<br />
and South Africa have considered the recommendation made by tho<br />
Joint Organization pursuant to the terms of paragraph 6 of the Wool<br />
Disposals Plan and have decided that the initial general level of<br />
reserve prices for DoiioDs' Wools sold in the Dominions shall be<br />
the same as tbe present average selling price, ex store, in the<br />
Dominion concerned. It is the intention that this inlitial level shall,<br />
in the absence of circumstances at present quite unforeseen, be<br />
maintained throughout the wool year 1946-47.<br />
Individual reserve prices for the wool year 1946-47, apart fronm<br />
exceptional cases, will not be changed throughout the year.<br />
The sale of wool at fixed prices b or on behalf of, the Joint<br />
Organization will cease on 30th June, 1946.<br />
Orders agaiinst which allocation of wool has no~ t been made, oil<br />
or before 30th June, 1946, will be cancelled. </p>
<p>Sales by auction will commence in Australia at the beginning of<br />
September, in South Africa at the beginning of September, in New<br />
Zealand of crutchings and of old wool at the beginning of September<br />
and of new wool in November, and in Britain in September. The<br />
precise dates on which auctions will commence and details of the<br />
selling programme will he announced later.<br />
Details in broad technical descriptions of the stock estimated to be<br />
held by the organization at 30th June, 1946, will be announced as soon as<br />
possible." On 27th June, 1946, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Scully) announced<br />
that the Wool ( Contributory Charge) Assessment Act and the Wool<br />
( Contributory Charge) Act, assented to on 11th October, 1945, as an<br />
essential part of the plan for the stabilized marketing of accumulated stocks<br />
of wool in conjunction with current clips, had been proclaimed to operate<br />
as from 1st July, 1946.<br />
In Parliament.-On 27th June, 1946, Mr. Scully said-<br />
The agreement between the Governments of Britain; Australia, New<br />
Zealand and South Africa for the disposal of accumulated stocks of wool<br />
and of oncoming clips provided for decisions by the four Governments,<br />
of a reserve price for the season, below which sales would not be made, and<br />
for a contributory charge which would be struck in each country to meet<br />
the industry's share of the cost of administration. The general reserve<br />
price agreed upon is that price at which wool is at present being sold<br />
ex store. For Australia, this is, on average, 18. l1 ( Aust.) a lb. The<br />
contributory charge decided upon by the Comuonwealth Government is<br />
per cent. of the value of the wool, which works out at .91d. ( Aust.) a lb.<br />
average. The price of 18.15d. a lb., less the cnurributory charge of .91l., gives<br />
a net average return of 17.24d. and this is 1.79d. ( Aust.) more than<br />
the average price of 15.45d. ( Aust.) over the whole clip payable by Britain<br />
under the war-time agreement. This must be considered very satisfactory<br />
to growers, because it gives to them, in effect, an overall minimum<br />
guaranteed return substantially greater than that received by them under<br />
the war-time contract." WAR ARCHIVES.<br />
On 25th June, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
In 1942, the then Prime Minister ( the late Mr. Curtin) formed a War<br />
Archives Committee under the chairmanship of Dr. C. E. W. Bean, who<br />
was historian of World War to investigate measures for the preservation<br />
of Australian records and documents relating to World War II.<br />
I have now approved of the scope of the committee being broadened<br />
so that its functions include the preservation of all Conunonwealth records<br />
and not only records relating to the war. The committee will be known<br />
as the Commonwealth Archives Committee. Its functions will be to study<br />
archival principles and practices and to submit recommendations for the<br />
establishment, when circunistances permit, of a permanent archival system </p>
<p>23<br />
for the Commonwealth. Pending the establishment of such system, it will<br />
advise the Government on general questions of collection and preservation.<br />
of records, for the collection or preservation of which adequate steps are<br />
not being taken by a Commonwealth authority, and will formulate proposals<br />
for the preservation of records and documents or Commonwealth<br />
departments, and lay down broad principles to be observed by Commonwealth<br />
departments and provisional archival authorities. The members of<br />
the committee will be---<br />
Dr. Bean ( chairman), Messrs. H. S. Temby ( Prime Minister's Department).<br />
P. Hasluck ( Department of External Affairs), J. G. B. Castieau ( Attorney-General's<br />
Department), K. Binns ( Commonwealth Librarian), LL-Colonel J. L. Treloar ( Director.<br />
Australian War Memorial), Mr. A. W. Bazley ( Assistant Director, Historical Records,<br />
Australian War Memorial), and a representative of the Department of the Interior.<br />
TEXTILE TRADE.<br />
WOOLLEN TEXTILES--EXPORTS.<br />
On 26th June, 19416, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Fraser) said<br />
that export of woollen cloths related to all woollen and worsteds and<br />
included shipments to Unrra as well as commercial exports. Of the<br />
3,000,000 square yards exported during the current trade year, about<br />
2,000,000 square yards of woollen piece goods went to Unrra, and a large<br />
quantity of it was stock the trade was glad to dispose of as it was unsaleable<br />
in Australia. The remaining 1,000,000 square yards of commercial exports<br />
of woollen and worsted piece goods represented only 4 per cent. of the<br />
total production of woollens and worsteds and included all types of woollen<br />
cloth. Suitings exported represented only a small proportion as the<br />
Governmeut -had established strict quotas for worsted exports. Apart<br />
from a small quota to New Zealand, the only exports of worsteds were on<br />
a token basis to maintain overseas markets.<br />
BUDGET, 1945-46.<br />
APPROPRIATION BILL-EXCESS REVENUE.<br />
In Parliament.-On 26th June, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley)<br />
introduced the Appropriation Bill. Mr. Chifley said-<br />
The purpose of this bill is to obtain parliamentary appropriation for<br />
the expenditure of an additional œ 20,000,000 of revenue for war purposes.<br />
When the budget was presented in September, 1945, I estimated that total<br />
revenue would be œ 374,000,000. The. budget was framed to provide an<br />
appropriation from revenue for non-war items aggregating œ 166,000,000.<br />
The balance of œ 208,000,000 was appropriated for war purposes.<br />
It is now anticipated that some revenue items will exceed the estimate.<br />
With the end of the war and the relaxation of controls, there has been a<br />
marked buoyancy in customs and excise revenue, and indications are that<br />
the estimate will he exceeded by œ 7,000,000. Increased sales of civilian<br />
goods, mainly due to demobilization of the forces, may result in an increase<br />
of sales tax revenue of œ 5,000,000. Income tax may yield an increased<br />
amount of œ 5,000,000. Estate duty and s: ome other items of revenue will<br />
show small increases. </p>
<p>It is anticipated that non-war expenditure will be approximately the<br />
same as the budget estimate. An accurate forecast of the total revenue<br />
for 1945-16 is difficult, but the improvement will be from œ 15,000,000 to<br />
œ 20,000,000. To permit this increase of revenue to be utilized to meet<br />
war expenditure, it is necessary to provide an additional appropriation<br />
of œ 20,000,000. The budget provided for total war expenditure of<br />
œ 360,000,000. Owing mainly to the acceleration of demcbilization, this<br />
estimate will be exceeded. The appropriation of œ 20,000,000 will enable<br />
the actual improvement of revenue to be applied to war expenditure, thus<br />
reducing the amount chargeable to loan." [ The bill was passed.]<br />
IMPORTS.<br />
CIGARETTE PAPERS.<br />
On 26th June, 1946, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Fraser) announced<br />
that, in view of the shortage of cigarette papers in Australia, licences would<br />
be issued for the importation of reasonable quantities of cigarette papers.<br />
BANKING CONTROL.<br />
LEGISLATION-COMMONWEALTH BANK ACT, INDUSTRIAL<br />
DEPARTMENT.<br />
In Parliament.-On 26th June, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley)<br />
said that to 20th March, 1946, applications to the Industrial Loan Department<br />
of the Commonwealth Bank totalled 964. of which 782 had been dealt<br />
with. Applications totalling 501 and involving œ 78, T738 had been granted.<br />

GOVERNMENT'S PLAN-NATIONAL WORKS COUNCIL, LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT AREAS.<br />
On 1st July, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
SThe question has beeni asked whether the Commnonwealth Government<br />
would give financial assistance to local authorities to implement their plans<br />
for local works, improvemlents and facilities, or arrange For the granting<br />
of interest free loans to such bodies. </p>
<p>26<br />
It must be remembered that these local authorities are self-governing<br />
bodies, responsible to the electors, and that powers exist under State law<br />
for them to raise loans, as well as obtain revenue by the levying of rates.<br />
As to concessional interest rates, I think it would be difficult to justify the<br />
selection of one class of borrowing for favoured treatment in this respect.<br />
Moreover, a concession to one class of borrowers presents the problem of<br />
adjusting upwards the rates to other borrowers if a net loss in interest<br />
receipts from all advances--involving an additional charge on the Budget--<br />
is to be avoided.<br />
The Commonwealth Government is aware of the problems associated<br />
with the financing of public work programmes and has actively pursued a<br />
policy which will provide the most favorable terms over the widest field<br />
of prospective borrowers. I refer particularly to the fact that borrowings<br />
by governments, and semi-and local government authorities, may now be<br />
negotiated on more favorable terms than ever before and this is directly<br />
. ttributable to the policy of low interest rates by the Commonwealth.<br />
It is essential to the continued success of financial policy, that all<br />
. pproaches to the market for loan funds should be properly co-ordinated.<br />
This is particularly important during the next few years, when it will be<br />
necessary to introduce the public works requirements of Commonwealth,<br />
State and local government bodies in an ordered way so as to avoid undue<br />
, competition for available building and works facilities. Similarly, it is<br />
-sscntial that financial needs be co-ordinated and related to available money.<br />
The fact that the Commonwealth, foreseeing these potential needs,<br />
: onvened the National Works Council, and was instrumental in having a<br />
long-term public works programme planned by the States, must not be<br />
interpreted as an indication that the Commonwealth Government desires to<br />
usurp the sovereign responsibilities of the States in the field of local government,<br />
nor that it is prepared to support a financial arrangement which<br />
would give strong preference to local government bodies in respect of public<br />
works finance which could not be extended to other Commonwealth and<br />
State financial requirements for public works and buildings programmes.<br />
At its first meeting in January, 1944, the National Works Council<br />
agreed to. the preparation of a programme of public works in three classifications<br />
of urgency and amounting in all to roughly œ 200,000,000 as a reservoir<br />
of worhs to facilitate the stabilization of the early post-war economic<br />
condition. It was resolved that the programme for each State should be<br />
endorsed by that State Government and that the administering authority<br />
of the programme should indicate its agreement to accept the financial<br />
responsibility entailed. Among the items included in the States' programmes<br />
would be works planned by local government authorities and<br />
authorized by the State Government concerned as sufficiently urgent to be<br />
included in its programme. At the second meeting of the National Works<br />
Council in August, 1944, progress was reviewed and it was again emphasized<br />
that the responsibility for the financing of the works programmes planned<br />
rested on the States. Local government authorities should, therefore,<br />
submit their loan proposals to their State Governments." </p>

UNITED NATIONS FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATIONAUSTRALIAN<br />
BODY.<br />
On 2nd July, 1946, Mr. Chifley said---<br />
The Fcod and Agriculture Organization is now becoming effectively<br />
established as an integral part of the new international machinery of the<br />
United Nations. The first conference, to which Australia sent a delegation,<br />
was held in 1945. Following the conference, steps have been taken to build<br />
up a permanent secretariat to carry out its functions.<br />
In 1944, Full Cabinet approved of an inter-departmental committee<br />
being established, comprising representatives of the Departments of the<br />
Treasury, External Affairs, Post-war Reconstruction, Commerce and Agriculture,<br />
and Health, to consider matters associated with the subject as<br />
they arose and to report to the Minister for External Affairs. A request<br />
has now been received from the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture<br />
Organization that an Australian committee be set up to provide a<br />
liaison between the appropria: e agencies in Australia and the secretariat<br />
of the organization.<br />
" Cabinet decided to-day that the Inter-departmental Committee be<br />
S replaced by an Australian Food and Agriculture Organization Committee<br />
to be set up in conformity with the request of the Director-General of F. A. O.,<br />
comprising representatives of the Departments of the Treasury, External<br />
S Affairs, Commerce and Agriculture, Information, Interior, Health, and of<br />
the Bureau of Agricultural Economics ( now with the Department of Post-<br />
S war Reconstruction), the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research,<br />
the Commonwealth Statistician, and the Forestry and Timber Bureau.<br />
The Australian F. A. O. Committee has the following duties and responsibilities<br />
To advise the Government on policy questions in regard to F. A. O.<br />
To collect information and statistics required by the F. A. O. secretariat from<br />
Australia and to approve such matter before despatch.<br />
To disseminate information provided by F. A. O.<br />
To bring to the notice of appropriate authorities any action required on their part<br />
S to carry out the purposes of F. A. O.<br />
To prepare the draft brief for Australian representatives attending conferences and<br />
other meetings of the F. A. O.<br />
To furnish a quarterly progress report to Cabinet and to report at other times as<br />
circumstances require.<br />
To arrange suitable publicity for F. A. O. activities through the Department of<br />
Information.<br />
S To co-operate with State authorities through the Department of Commerce and<br />
Agriculture and the Australian Agricultural Council.<br />
WORLD ORGANIZATION--ATOMIC ENERGY.<br />
In Parliament.-On 3rd July, 1946, Mr. Chifley said--<br />
On the general subject of the control of atomic energy and the materials<br />
used in the manufacture of atomic bombs, a conference has been sitting for<br />
some time. The Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt) is representing<br />
Australia. I cannot say what final decisions are likely to be reached, but<br />
the general view has been expressed by this Government, and has been<br />
submitted to the conference, that the control of atomic energy should be<br />
placed under the United Nations. Having regard to the dreadful possibilities<br />
of the use of uranium and other ingredients in the production of </p>
<p>atomic bombs, and to the future peace of the world, our belief is that this<br />
new discovery should be developed to produce industrial power and not<br />
hombs for war purposes. Dr. Evatt is making this clear at the conference."<br />
SECONDARY INDUSTRIES COMMISSION-PLYWOOD INDUSTRY<br />
PANEL.<br />
On 3rd July, 1946, Mr. Dedman announced the formation of a Plywood<br />

Guinea ( Mr. J. B. McAdam), Messrs. J. F. Brett and C. R. Paterson ( Australian Plywood<br />
Board), Mr. C. Mitchell ( Associated Country Saw Millers of New South Wales), the<br />
secretary of the Furnishing Trad-es Union ( Mr. O. Schreiber), the secretary of the<br />
Timber Workers' Union ( Mr. J. A. Weir), and Mr. A. H. Crane ( Forestry Division,<br />
Queensland Department of Lands).<br />
The panel would report on--<br />
The pro-war and post-war requirements of plywood by types to determine the degree<br />
of permanency of any increased demand.<br />
The present day relation between established demand and. available supplies<br />
expressed in terms of local production capacity, plus importation potential.<br />
The location and availability of logs with particular reference to unexploited home<br />
: and adjacent island stands of timber.<br />
Action to secure an adequate supply of logs for the plywood industry to meet<br />
current and expected demands.<br />
WHEAT POOLS PAYMENTS.<br />

AUSTRALIAN WAR EFFORT AND CAPACITY.<br />
CONTROL OF TINPLATE--RE-INSTITUTED.<br />
On 27th June, 1946, the Minister for Supply ( Senator Ashley) announced<br />
that as from 1st July, 1946, control of the end use of tinplate, which had<br />
been relaxed in October, 1945, would be re-instituted. Action had been<br />
necessary because of serious cut-hacks in allocation:; of tinplate from the<br />
United States and because substantial supplies of tinplate were not yet<br />
coming forward from Britain. The Government was taking steps to meet<br />
the position and had despatched a mission to Britain and the United States<br />
to ensure that Australia's needs were fully known.<br />

been approved, involving œ 2,924,105. TAXATION.<br />
COMPARISONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES.<br />
On 28th June, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chilley) said that staterients<br />
comparing the level of taxation in Australia with that of other<br />
countries were misleading, unless qualified by a proper understanding of<br />
the relative values of the several currencies and other relevant factors,<br />
including the level of indirect taxation, such as customs and excise duties,<br />
the level of social services expenditure, the standard of living in each<br />
: ountry and whether the exchange rates were free or pegged. I </p>
<p>Tables of tax payable in sterling countries as compared with tax payable<br />
in non-sterling countries should be treated with great caution before<br />
drawing any conclusions from them. In the following table, setting out the<br />
tax payable on selected incomes in Australia, New Zealand and Britain,<br />
in each case the tax payable had been expressed in the currency of the<br />
country concerned. The amounts shown in the statement included the<br />

AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING COMMISSION.<br />
REVENUE FROM LICENCES.<br />
On 2nd July, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
In June, 1945, Cabinet approved of the continuation of a special payment<br />
to the Australian Broadcasting Commission of such additional amount<br />
; Is is equivalent to Is. a full licence fee and 6d. a half licence fee for a period<br />
of twelve months on the basis of licences in force on 30th June, 1945. This<br />
was a further continuation of an arrangement approved in May, 1944.<br />
Cabinet to-day decided to continue still further this special payment<br />
tor a further v.: ar, pending a report on the subject by the Parliamentary<br />
Standing Committee on Broadcasting."<br />
SOCIAL SECURITY.<br />
TUBERCULOSIS PATIENTS-COMMONWEALTH GRANT.<br />
On 2nd July, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-<br />
The Tuberculosis Act, passed by Parliament in October, 1945, came<br />
into operation on 1st January, 1946, and provided for Commonwealth<br />
grants for diagnostic facilities, after-care facilities, payment for patients in<br />
State hospitals and special allowances to a sufferer or his or her dependants.<br />
In regard to special allowances, the then Minister for Health ( Senator Fraser)<br />
and I were directed by Cabinet to discuss with the State Ministers for Health<br />
the question of the States distributing, on behalf of the Commonwealth,<br />
the grant to be used as a special tubercul,) sis allowance.<br />
To provide for policy and administrative questions arising from the<br />
Act, Cabilnet to-dav decided that the Act be amended to provide that an<br />
amount of œ 250,000 a year may be payable to States, the allocation to each<br />
State to be determined by the Minister, on condition that the States distribute<br />
the grant to or in respect of sufferers from tuberculosis or their<br />
dependants in necessitous circumstances to achieve the object of encouraging<br />
sufferers to cease work and take treatment; to assist in preventing the<br />
spread of the disese and to promote the better treatment of the disease;<br />
and that payments received by individuals in accordance with the proposed<br />
new section shall not be regarded as income for the purposes of the Invalid<br />
and Old-age Pensions Act and of the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits<br />
Act. This will ensure that the tuberculosis special allowances are-excluded<br />
from the means tests imposed in these two Acts, thus making the allowances<br />
additional to any benefit the sufferer may be eligible to receive direct<br />
from the Commonweilth by waY of sickness benefit or invalid pension."'<br />
AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING ACT.<br />
VENEREAL DISEASE, SEX TALKS.<br />
On 3rd July, 1946, the Postmaster-General ( Senator Cameron) announced<br />
that the Parliamentary Broadcasting Committee had recommended that<br />
broadcast talks on venereal disease and sex matters should net be permitted.<br />
The Government had adopted the recommendation and broadcasting stations<br />
had been requested to refrain forthwith from broadcasting such talks. </p>

PRICES.<br />
U. S. REVOCATION-EFFECT ON AUSTRALIA.<br />
On 3rd July, 1946, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Fraser) said that<br />
the effect on Australian prices of the abandonment of price control in the<br />
United States would depend on the. extent and direction of the inflationary<br />
forces in America. It was not known whether American exports would be<br />
affected or whether any increase in price would be significant. In any<br />
case, it would be some months before goods purchased at currnat or future<br />
prices would be landing in Australia and there was no present indication<br />
that the local retail price level would be affected. It was difficult to make<br />
any forecasts but Australia would watch developments in the United States<br />
with great interest both from the point of view of the lesson to be learned<br />
from the experiment, and the effects on the Australian economy.<br />

MEAT AGREEMENT.<br />
EXPORTS-CONTROL, BILL INTRODUCED.<br />
In Parliament.-On 3rd July, 1946, the Minister for Commerce ( Mr.<br />
Scully) introduced the Meat Export Control Bill. Mr. Scully said-<br />
The purpose of this bill, to amend the Meat Export Control Act, is to<br />
provide for the reconstitution of the Australian Meat Board, and to grant<br />
to the board additional powers necessary to enable it to carry out work in<br />
relation to the long-term purchase agreement covering ncat for export,<br />
entered into between the Commonw,. ealth Go-vernment and the British<br />
Government. The Australian Meat Board will consist of twelve members, including<br />
a Commonwealth Government representative, who will be appointed by the<br />
Governor-General. He will be employed full-time on the business of the<br />
board and will be chairman. Of the remaining eleven members, seven<br />
members, constituting a clear majority of the board, will be representative<br />
of producer interests. Producer members, comprising four representatives<br />
of the lamb and mutton producers, two of the beef producers, and one of'<br />
the pig producers, must be bona fide producers, and must be persons<br />
nominated by producer organizations constituted on a Commonwealth<br />
basis. Members appointed to represent the meat exporting companies arc<br />
to be appointed after consultation with representative organizations of<br />
meat exporters. The member appointed to represent the employees will<br />
be appointed after co:, ulltation with the Federal Council of the Meat<br />
Industry Employees Union. The member appointed to represent the<br />
publicly-owned abattoirs and freezing works will be appointed by th'e<br />
Governor-General. </p>
<p>J'I<br />
The bill gives the person presiding at a meeting tile right to dissent<br />
from any decision of the board. This right is necessary because of the<br />
Conmmn: nwealth Government's financial interest in the operations of thet<br />
board. It is essential that the chairman shall have the right to bring to<br />
thef Minister's notice immediately any resolutior which lie considers may<br />
involve the Commonwealth Government in any way on a point of principle<br />
or, on question of financial losses or gains.<br />
So that all sections of the industry may be in a position to present<br />
their views on matters affecting the ilndustry, provision has been made for<br />
th' settini. g-up of State conmmittees. It will be competent for any duly<br />
constituted State organization representing a section of the meat industry<br />
to: ; ppl\ fcr representation on the State committee.<br />
SAs the ainiistration of the long-term purchase agreement for meat<br />
between the Commonwealth Government and the British Government will<br />
li, a function of the board after the expiration of the ANatioil Security Act,<br />
provision has been malde for the powers of the board to be extended to<br />
includ the following<br />
To purchase on behalf of the Conimonwealth Government any meat, meat product,<br />
or edible offal.<br />
To sell on behalf of the Commonwealth Government any meat, meat product, or<br />
edible offal.<br />
To manage and control as necessary, the handling, storage aifd shipment of any<br />
meat, meat product, or edible offal.<br />
Subject to the approval of the Commonwealth Government, to obtain advances<br />
from the Commonwealth Bank under Commonwealth Government guarantee, for use<br />
in the purchase of meat for export and the payment of expenses incurred in connexion<br />
therewith. Attention is directed to the provision, of. special interest to producers,<br />
that. the colnitions attaching to the issue by the board of an export licence<br />
liav bieen extended to n ake it obligatory on the licensee, where the prodlucer-<br />
wnier of such stock so requests, to treat stock on account of the<br />
o) wn'r n weigh t and grade basis." [ The bill ats ipssed.]<br />
In Parliament.--On 3rd July, 1946, Mr. Scully introduced the Meat<br />
Industry Control Bill. Mr. Scully said<br />
The purpose of this bill. which is supplementary to the Meat Export<br />
Control Bill, is to transfer to the Australian Meat Board the powers arnd<br />
functions at present exercised by the Controller of Meat Supplies and the<br />
Meat Canning Committee under National Security Act regulations. It will<br />
b) e appreciated that the transfer is to be temporary, and that, with the<br />
expiration of the National Security Act, this act will cease to have the force<br />
of law. Notwithstanding that, the interests of the Commonwealth Government<br />
and of the meat industry, insofar as they relate to actions taken 1v<br />
the Controller of Meat Supplies and the Meat Canning Committee ander<br />
Nationa. l Secu-i ity Act regulations, must be protected. The bill provides<br />
that these rights and obligatilns shall be assumed by the Australian Meat<br />
Board. Since the rationing of meat and the control of meat prices n. re<br />
nmatters which, for the time being ; t least, are closely linked with the<br />
4420.--2 * i </p>
<p>general control of the meat industry, provision has been made for the temporary<br />
appointment to the Australian Meat Board of additional memhers,<br />
one to represent the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner, and one the<br />
Director of Rationing. These members will automatically cease to hold<br />
office upon the expiration of the National Scc rity Act."<br />

NATIONALITY.<br />
NATURALIZATION-NEW GUINEA.<br />
In Parliamnent.-On 4th July, 1946, the Minister for Immigration ( Mr.<br />
Calwell) introduced the Nationality Bill. Mr. Calwell said-<br />
Under existing nationality law, an essential requirement for the grant<br />
of a certificate of naturalization is that an applicant shall have resided for<br />
a prescribed period within the British dominions. The Territory of New<br />
Guinea does not form a part of the Briti., h dominions for the purposes of<br />
nationality law, and residence in the territory cannot be counted as<br />
residence for the grant of naturalization. This means that the only way<br />
open at present to a person living in the territory to acquire British nationality,<br />
which will be recognized in Australia, or other parts of the Empire,<br />
is to abandon his domicile there and take up residence in Australia or some<br />
other part of the British Commonwealth. The purpose of this bill is to<br />
enable a resident of the territory to qualify for naturalization as a British<br />
subject while maintaining his residence in the territory.<br />
Commonwealth Crown Law authorities have expressed the opinion<br />
that it is nQt possible to grant to residents of New Guinea naturalization<br />
which would be effective throughout the British dominions. The Government<br />
has decided that the next best should be given to residents of the<br />
territory; that is, that they shall be accorded the privilege of qualifying<br />
for the grant of British nationality which will have effect in the Commonwealth<br />
and its territories. The hill makes that provision.<br />
It is not the Government's intention that this shall be the final word<br />
on the subject. It is proposed to hold a conference of representatives of<br />
Britain and the Dominions in the near future to discuss certain nationality<br />
questions. It is intended to raise at that conference the matter of making<br />
provision that residence in New Guinea shall he regarded as a qualification<br />
for the grant of a certificate of naturalization which will be effective, not<br />
only in Australia and its territories, hut also throughout the whole of the<br />
British Commonwealth.' [ Th7e bill wlr pased.]<br />
JUDICIARY.<br />
ARBITRATION C. OURT-PENSION RIGHTS.<br />
In Ptli,, went.-On 4th July, 194i, the Minister for Labour ( Mr.<br />
Hollow iv) introduced the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Bill. Mr. Holloway said<br />
The object of this hill is to provide that, where a judge of the Common-l<br />
weallth Arbitration Court has, before his appointment, served in any judicil<br />
dflir, und.' r a State, his service umnder the State. up to a period of ten yeo,' rs, </p>
<p>shall be deemed to be part of his service as a judge of the Commonwealth<br />
Arbitration Court for the purpose of calculating his pension rights. Under<br />
the act in its present form, account may be taken of prior service in a<br />
judicial office under the Commonwealth for the purposes of pension rights,<br />
hlt no such provision is made in respect of prior service in a judicial office<br />
under a State.<br />
In other legislation, for example, the BaInkraptry Act, a limited period<br />
of prior service in a judicial office under a State may be taken into account<br />
for the purposes of pension. The idea is to establish a permanent basis<br />
for settling matters of this kind. Recently, several new judges have been<br />
appointed, and most ce them have served in a judicial capacity in a State."<br />
[ The bill was passed.]<br />
PATENTS.<br />
BILL INTRODUCED.<br />
In Pirliamein't.-On 4th July, 1946. the Acting Attorney-General ( Mr.<br />
IIllowa.) introduced the Patents Bill. MJr. Holloway said-<br />
The principal object of the bill is to remove certain disadvantages<br />
which have occurred by. reason of the deltayv at present existing in the<br />
examination work of the Patent Office. That delay has ibeen brought about<br />
in plart , y the fact that a large nmber of exaniiners of patent. s--representing<br />
over 60 per cent. of the stal'f-were released during the war fromn<br />
the Patent Office for service in the forces and in other departments. The<br />
de! ay has also been partly brought about by reason of an abnormal and<br />
entirely unpredictable increase of the number of applications for patents.<br />
This increase appears to be largely due to the great industrial development<br />
which has taken place in Australia in recent years. Many overseas manufacturers<br />
discovered during the war that the Australian market was worth-<br />
\ vhile. and that they cannot obtain royalties for the use of their inventions<br />
in Australia unless they patent them here. Tn 1939, the nunmb" r of applications<br />
for patents was 5,700; last year it was 7,300; and it is expected<br />
that. this year the iiumbier will exceed 10,000.<br />
Every effort is being made to obtain the services of additional<br />
examinrs of patents. It takes at least three years to train an examiner<br />
full-in his work, and some considerable time will elapse before any substantial<br />
reduction is made of the arrears of examination work in the Patent<br />
Office. Anv serious delay in the examination of patent applications has a<br />
dlerimental effect on inventors, and -m industrial development.<br />
This bill proposes to amend, the law so as to provide for the publication<br />
complete specifications forthwith after lodgment at the Patent Office<br />
anld for a patentee whose invention has been used after publication to be<br />
entitled to damages for infringement committed from the date of publication<br />
forthwith after the lodgment instead of from the date of publication consequent<br />
upon acceptance. Damages are recoverable only if a patent is<br />
ultimnately sealed on the application and only in respect of valid claims.<br />
As a corollary to the provisions referred to, the bill gives protection to<br />
persons who may be threatened with infringement actions by applicants<br />
4420.--</p>
<p>on the basis of questionable or iivali I claims, and prohibits the miking of<br />
falso representations that articles are patented or the subject of ienlinr<br />
applications. SThe bill proposes to imake periai. neit a; practice aidopte! durig the<br />
war under ntional Security Act Regulations of not examiniung a pr, ov isiotial<br />
specification until the complete specificetionll has len lodged. lI -aaiy<br />
cases, applications are acconipanied I* v provisional specifications onvl and<br />

PROPOSED VISIT BY MR. ATTLEE--POSTPONED.<br />
On 6th Jub-. 1946 the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said--<br />
SThe B3ritishl Prime Minister and Mrs. Attlee have been looking for1ward<br />
to visiting Australia and New Zealand at the invitation of their governments.<br />
It was announced in April, 1946, that Mr. Attlee planued to leave Britain<br />
in the last week of July, 1946, ibut that his plans were liable to revijion if<br />
there should bie any public matters, requiring his personal attention, which<br />
necessitated his presence in Britain in the period concerned. He has now<br />
regretfully reached the conclusion that the decision recently announced to </p>
<p>summnioii the Peace Coaference at Paris onil 29th July, 1946, added to the<br />
other pressing problems which confront the British Government at present,<br />
render it impossible for hin to be absent froulnt Britain dluring the period<br />
proposed for thile visit to Australia. and New Zealand. He has, accordingly,<br />
informed mec that lie keenly regrets that. lie is obliged to cancel the arrangenernts<br />
! L postponie the visit.<br />
Both Mr. and Mrs. Attlee are acutely lisappointed at the loss of this<br />
opportunity to see Australia and New Zealand, to meet their governments<br />
and people and to express, on behalf of the people of Britain, the appreciation<br />
of Britain of the minagnificent contribution made hY both the fighting<br />

SFollowing dibcussionts between the lMinister for External Affairs ( Dr.<br />
Evatt), the President of the United States ( Mr. Truman) andrl the Acting<br />
Secretary of State ( Mr. Dean Acheson), formal arrangements have now<br />
been completed betten the Australian and LniIod States Governments<br />
for the raising of the rank of their legations at Canluberra and Washington<br />
to embassies. and of the office of Minister to that of Ambas ador. This<br />
step is the natural consequence of the iicrea. ingly closer and cordial relations<br />
betweenll Australia and the Unitel States and reflects the added importance<br />
of the Pacific area in the eves of both goverimients. The move also serves<br />
as a recoanition of th. e major contribution made by Australia to victory<br />
in World War II., and of the important part which she continues to play<br />
in regari to the pireservation of security inii the Pacific.<br />
President Truman proposes to submit to the Senate the noillinatio<br />
of Mr. Robert Butler of St. Paul, Minnesota, as first United States<br />
Ambassador to Australia. Mr. Butler served in World War I. and is<br />
to-day one of America's leading constructional engineers. He is also<br />
actively connected with the governing bodies of various educational<br />

re-establishment. Arrangements had been made for a committee<br />
representative of the Ministry of Post-war Reconstruction, the Repatriation<br />
Commission, the Department of Social Services, the Treasury and . the<br />
Department of Labour to carry out detailed planning. The Australian<br />
Red Cross Society had been invited to take part ith a view to it assuming<br />
a full and official part in the development of the planning. Establishment<br />
of a psychiatric out-patients' service in each State was an essential of the<br />
plan, together with further development by the Department of Social<br />
Services of its rehabilitation centres in State capitals. f r1<br />
