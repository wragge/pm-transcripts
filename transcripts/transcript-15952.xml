    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia will join an international force under the United Nations Assistance Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) to help implement a plan to restore peace and stability to the strife torn region of Sudan.</p>
<p>Working under the code name Operation HEDGEROW, nine ADF Officers would be employed within the UNAMID Headquarters in logistics, movement and operational areas.</p>
<p>ADF participation in UNAMID is subject to final agreement by the Government of Sudan.</p>
<p>These appointments will provide ADF officers with an opportunity to serve within the UNAMID Headquarters and demonstrate the high level of confidence that the UN places in the ADF.</p>
<p>Darfur has been a continuing tragedy and the Australian Government has a responsibility to act and this contribution demonstrates our commitment to the UN and restoring peace and stability in Darfur.</p>
<p>An estimated 200,000 people have died from the combined effects of war, famine and diseases since 2003 and an estimated two million people have been displaced.</p>
<p>When fully deployed, UNAMID will become the UN's largest peacekeeping operation with an estimated 20,000 troops and 6,000 police and civilian personnel.</p>
<p>The Australia Government has also pledged five million dollars in humanitarian assistance to the people of Darfur. Preliminary planning has commenced for the ADF deployment to UNAMID.</p>
