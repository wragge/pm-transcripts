SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES<br />
AT THE OPENING OF THE JANET BIDDLECOMBEWING OF THE<br />
QUEEN ELIZABETH HOME, BALLARAT, 12TH SEPTEMBER 1959<br />
Sir, I would like to make it quite clear that I am<br />
here today by the direct orders of a man called Dudley Erwin who<br />
had ascertained something of my past and who said I had to come.<br />
I claim no virtue for it, because when I said " Yes" I hadn't<br />
realised that the second semi-final was on, and perhaps I: m<br />
happier here than I would be there, having regard to the scores<br />
that have been announced.<br />
This is quite an occasion. I am not going to spoil<br />
it by making a long speech to you, but the Queen Elizabeth Home,<br />
commemorates a great woman, and the Janet Biddlecomb Wing ( and<br />
I have listened with fascination to what Major Russell has said<br />
about her) commemorates a great and kind-hearted woman. So this<br />
is an occasion, and a particularly interesting occasion for me,<br />
because from the outside I've known a good deal of the history<br />
of this place. When I was a small boy, as you've been reminded, I was<br />
schooled for some years in Ballarat, sometimes very successfully<br />
and sometimes not. And I lived with an old Scots grandmother in<br />
Dana Street just over the road, and at that time this place, was<br />
known as " The Benev" to us who were bouncing boys in the neighbourhood.<br />
And I must tell you it wasn't a very attractive<br />
place. I know that a lot of kind people took an interest in it<br />
but it was a depressing looking place; it depressed me, even<br />
when I was a boy, and a boy takes a lot of depressing, A corrugated<br />
iron fence on the other side of the road from my grandmother's<br />
house, had on it, even when I was a boy of 12, the last<br />
scrolled scores of the street cricket match engaged in by my<br />
father and by his brothers, so you see it goes back a pretty<br />
fair way. The fence has gone and the old benevolent institution<br />
is not recognisable any longer. Now this seems to me to be a<br />
sort of microcosm of what's been going on in the world, because<br />
honestly in those days, and I don't think that a long memory exaggerates<br />
the facts, one felt, even as a child, a sense of pity<br />
for the people who lived there the old men who sat on forms<br />
outside the old building, or walked somewhat precariously down<br />
Ascot Street to the corner for some purpose thatl wasn't allowed<br />
to enquire into at that time. But everything was well, I<br />
think the right word to use is this, that it did not seem to me,<br />
even as a child, to be consistent with human dignity, and-what<br />
we have learned in these modern times, with these wonderful.<br />
places, is the importance of individual human dignity nobody<br />
looking down, but everybody looking across, meeting people in<br />
a perfectly normal, social sense; people living in quarters, not<br />
shabby quarters, not the poor things that one can remember, but<br />
living in bedrooms and using dining-rooms, and using sittingrooms<br />
and sun balconies and so on. which are good and in which<br />
they can meet each other with pride and receive their friends<br />
with pride. This is tremendously important. I'm perfectly certain<br />
that in the 19th Century a great deal of what they were<br />
pleased to call " charity" was almost a loss of dignity on the<br />
part of the recipient. We have, with all our blunders and<br />
we've made many at least realised that human dignity matters<br />
and we must never undermine it. And that is why I like these<br />
things that have developed, because people go on living, meeting<br />
their friends, living their own lives, not in an institional<br />
atmosphere, but as they would like to have lived their own lives<br />
if they had been able to retain their own homes and maintained<br />
them. This is tremendously important; this, I venture to say, </p>
<p>is one of the great social revolutions of our time!, and that is<br />
why I am here, and that is why my~ wife is here. We think this<br />
is one of the proudest things that we have been privileged to<br />
witness in our own public life.<br />
I must tell you that the Commonwealth provision for<br />
Grants for Aged Persons' * Homes which began only a few years ago,<br />
began with a conversation at a table in my own home in which my<br />
wife was the talker and I, for once was the listener. And she<br />
said something to me " Look" she said " Don't ask me to understand<br />
a lot of these things that you're doing, but I tell you one<br />
thing about aged people in Australia a home to live in, a<br />
house to live in, a flat to live in, a roof to live under, their<br />
own vine and fig-tree, I-this is the most important lot in Australia.<br />
Now why don' tou do s-omething about it?" Well I know<br />
there are a lot of men here who think they're ruling the roost<br />
when they're at home but I've never suffered from that illusion.<br />
The moment I was told " Why don't you do something about it" I<br />
said " All right, dear, Yes", swallowed two or three times went<br />
over to the Cabinet and propounded, having done a little thinking<br />
about it on the journey, propounded this idea of the Commonwealth<br />
granting Å C for : C on Homes for Aged Persons. And such a<br />
success did it become'that within two years I think it was but<br />
Senator Wedgwood will recall we made it for a Never<br />
was money better spent. It didn't discourage individual effort.<br />
Nothing that the Government of Victoria does, or that the Commission<br />
does, or that the Commonwealth doe s, ought to discourage<br />
individual effort, because Government Departments, with all the<br />
wisdom of their outlook which they occasionally achieve, cannot<br />
build into the bricks and mortar of a place like this, that<br />
spirit of kindliness which only individuals can produce. And<br />
every individual who does something for a place likc this, every<br />
individual who comes to it, who sits and talks, not condescendingly,<br />
but on ordinary normal terms, distills a feeling of humanity<br />
which is of the very essence of this home. I hope it<br />
will go on like that.<br />
I think we have shaken ourselves free of some of the<br />
old ideas of charity " Now abideth faith, hope and charity"<br />
I think that is a wonderful chapter in Corinthian -but I don't<br />
like the word " charity" because it has changed its meaning in<br />
the course of centuries, and therefore, I prefer the newer version<br />
" Now abideth faith, hope and love and the greatest of these<br />
is love". It is so true. It is so easy to find a little money<br />
and think that we've done our duty to pay our taxes and say<br />
" Well, after all, I pay my taxes, let the Government look after<br />
it" l. I don't want somebody to say to me some day, nor to you,<br />
" Well we've paid our taxes, if you're in trouble let the Government<br />
look after you". I would like to think that a few human<br />
beings were interested in me, wouldn't you? And i~ f we all<br />
think that way, and if everybody in Australia manages to think<br />
that way, then it won't be only Governments that find the money,<br />
though they will undoubtedly go on finding more and more, but it<br />
will be individual human beings who will feel, Sir as they respond<br />
to your prospective appeal for Å C5O, OOO " Well, at any<br />
rate I'm paying my little mite" towards a place, which, as I began<br />
with saying and as I end with saying, embodies in itself a<br />
complete revolution that has occurred in our country in relation<br />
to social service, in relation to the care ofelderly people.<br />
Perhaps I speak with perhaps some warmth on this matter, because<br />
I think the last remark I ought to make to you, Mr Nicholson, is<br />
that, by Christmas time I'll be qualified to enter.<br />
So my wife and I are both delighted to be here; I have<br />
the greatest honour in the world in declaring this Wing open. I<br />
mention with honour the names of the two great ladies, one our<br />
Sovereign, and the other your benefactor, whose names are associa<br />
-ted with this home. I shall now, having done that, step down,<br />
with all the comfortable feeling that a husband has when he knows<br />
that the things which remain to be done must be done by his wife, </p>
