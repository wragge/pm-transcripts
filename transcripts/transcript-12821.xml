Today I met Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri.  We had a useful discussion about how we can advance our joint efforts to bring the perpetrators of the Bali atrocities to justice and strengthen the fight against terrorist threats in the region.<br />
I am pleased to announce that Australia will provide an additional $10 million over four years to assist Indonesia build its counter-terrorism capacity.<br />
They will involve new efforts to enhance travel security by strengthening airport, immigration and customs control systems and capabilities.  We are also looking at how we can assist Indonesia to restrict the flow of financing to terrorists, and help build the capacity of the Indonesian police on counter-terrorism and transnational crime.<br />
The details of these capacity building programmes will be developed in consultation with the Indonesian government.   </p>
