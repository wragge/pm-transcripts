ELECTORAL TALK<br />
Australian companies are making a valuable contribution<br />
to our national recovery with each new investment decision<br />
regardless of size.<br />
But companies can do more not just for themselves, but<br />
for the benefit of all Australians.<br />
Company management can spend more time and effort in taking<br />
employees into their confidence.<br />
Management can spend more time recognising that they<br />
have common interests with ' those down on the shop floor'.<br />
Today an increasing number of businesses are making a special<br />
effort to inform employees about the company's performance<br />
and prospects. An increasing number are starting to issue<br />
special reports to employees and involving them in discussions.<br />
Some companies are telling their workforce how inflation affects<br />
their particular business; what has, happened to the cumpany's trade<br />
over the last few years; the prospects for new investment<br />
and the prospects of the company providing more jobs.<br />
These companies understand that their workers are not just<br />
another ingot of steel or another element of inanimate<br />
object in the production process.<br />
Unfortunately, however, there are too many Australian companies<br />
who do not pay enough attention to this critical area.<br />
If these companies follow the example of the best, then.<br />
there would be less time lost through strikes and a reduction<br />
in the number of disputes.<br />
Surely t". c managers who simply see their workforce as a cost in the<br />
business of maKin-a product must understand they are retarding<br />
national recovery.<br />
This kind of inward looking and inward thinking out-dated<br />
industrial relations attitude must have a far reaching affect<br />
the industrial scene in Australia. / 2 </p>
<p>This attitude not onl~ y affects their owD co,.; pany's<br />
performance but rubs off onto neighbouring companies<br />
and others in the same industry.<br />
When a company opens a new plant, or unveils a new development<br />
why does it sometimes happen only in front of a bevy<br />
of ma-Jnagement people, customers, suppliers, industry heads<br />
and politicians?<br />
Employees should always be invited. Their wives and children<br />
should be part of the ceremony too.<br />
For without these employees and their families -there would<br />
be no new plant, no new technological development -and no<br />
industry to run.<br />
Australian companies have a special obligation to help make<br />
people understand that there are interests held in common.<br />
They are in a unique position to demonstrate that there<br />
doesn't have to be competition for influence and power.<br />
I look for evidence that more companies understand th-.. t employees<br />
and management do have interests in common.<br />
Companies are also in the best position to persuade people of<br />
the virtues of the free enterprise system.<br />
In a free enterprise system the employee has a choice of<br />
employers, a choice of industry, a choice of products.<br />
Collectively, he exercises a great deal of control over the<br />
market place. He controls what products sell, and what<br />
remain on the shelf. He therefore affects profits.<br />
Pre-emi~ nently, private enterprise gives employees a standard<br />
of living not matched by any other system.<br />
But how mnany Australian companies really try and persuade<br />
their employees who may not believe in the free enterpri-,&gt;-,<br />
system that it does offer the best life for Australians<br />
and -not just for employers, for management or for company directors.<br />
There is a job -which mana 4gement can undertake in a quiet<br />
and logical sense that could help transform society and help<br />
make. Australia a better place for all of us.<br />
