OPENING ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR HAROLD<br />
HOLT, PRESENTED ON TELEVISION AND RADIO ON<br />
9TH NOVEMBER, 1967<br />
Twelve months ago, you returned my Government<br />
with a record majority in the house of Representatives. You<br />
gave us warm and powerful support for reasons which seemed to<br />
you to be vitally important important for Australia's securityimportant<br />
for its economic welfare important for the security<br />
and welfare of yourselves and your families.<br />
The greatest issue before you was whether we<br />
should desert our allies in time of conflict and this is what<br />
we would be doing if we withdrew our forces from Viet Nam. This,<br />
in effect, was what the Australian Labor Party proposed to you.<br />
This, in basic English, is what it still proposes under its<br />
new leadership. Wrapped up in this question last November<br />
and now is what reliance would Australia be able to place on<br />
its treaty arrangements with the United States arrangements<br />
which mean so much to our security if we were to walk out<br />
on the Americans in Viet Nam,~ That danger of a weakening of<br />
our treaty arrangements remains while Labor persists with<br />
its policy of withdrawal. At issue also last November and now is our<br />
growing relationship with the free countries of Asia.<br />
Several of these are contributing as we are to the<br />
resistance in Viet Nam to communist aggression. They are<br />
fearful that this expansion could imperil their security,<br />
So are others not actively engaged, such as Malaysia,<br />
Singapore, Laos and Taiwan. Not only is the security of all<br />
these countries threatened, but also at risk are the bright<br />
prospects revealing themselves for us all by increased trade<br />
and growning co-operation for mutually helpful peaceful<br />
purposes. These were aspects of Australia's external<br />
position before you last November.<br />
They are still before you, but importance has<br />
been heightened. It has been heightened by the British<br />
announcement, made since the last election of plans for a<br />
phased withdrawal of forces from the Malasia/ Singapore area,<br />
But external policy was only one issue,<br />
vital though you rightly believed it to be. You were also </p>
<p>-2<br />
conscious that under the sound and stable government we had<br />
given, Australia was making remarkable economic progress.<br />
Indeed, only one industrialised country Japan can point<br />
to a higher rate of increase in its national product over<br />
the last five years. That progress, and the prosperity<br />
which accompanies it continue. You had good reason to believe<br />
then as you have now that the fanciful doctrinaire<br />
economic and social policies put forward by the Labor Party would<br />
endanger this steady progress. They would certainly involve<br />
an astronomic increase in government expenditures.<br />
In the coming Senate election, many less<br />
important issues will be argued before you by our opponents.<br />
Attempts will be made by them to distract you from issues<br />
fundamental to the nation's welbi But you refused to be<br />
diverted last November. Since then, the Labor Party has gone<br />
through a process of face-lifting. It has tried to project<br />
a more attractive image under a new and younger leadership.<br />
But all the evidence proves that the basic policies remain<br />
unchanged. The gulf between the views of the Government<br />
and those of the Opposition on external and domestic matters<br />
remains as wide as ever.<br />
This particular campaign produces another major<br />
issue, Although the Government enjoys a record<br />
majority in the House of Representatives, it is in a minority<br />
in the Senate, You may wonder why this is so. The immediate<br />
reason is the death last year of two Liberal Senators, but<br />
the Senate is always close to an even division, because its<br />
members are elected by proportional representation, while<br />
the Members of the House of Representatives are elected as<br />
a direct consequence of the choice of individual electors..<br />
In the coming election, therefore, you are not<br />
electing a government, you are electing thirty Senators<br />
five from each of the six States. I hope you will see to it<br />
that the majority of them will be government Senators!<br />
I say this for the plain reason, which you will<br />
readily understand, that if government is to be effective, the<br />
Government of the day should be able to count on majority<br />
support in both Houses of Parliament,<br />
You rejected the policies of those Labor Senators<br />
who oppose us in the Senate today.<br />
Are we to be able to get on with the country's<br />
business and carry out the mandate you gave us twelve months<br />
ago, or are we to continue a situation where a combination<br />
of Senators whose policies you have I repeat rejected,<br />
whether from the ALP, the DLP or as Independents, can take<br />
the business out of the Government's hands whenever they<br />
choose? To give the final say to those you rejected<br />
so decisively twelve months ago, would be, I think you will<br />
agree, both absurd and an abandonment of democratic principle.<br />
The official platform of the ALP says it will<br />
abolish the Senate. But, under its new leadership, the ALP </p>
<p>-3<br />
has used its representation there, regimented by the vote of<br />
the full Caucus, to thwart the democratically elected majority<br />
in the House of Representatives. A typical instance was its<br />
action in holding up for six months the improvements proposed<br />
by the Government to the Aged Persons Homes Scheme.<br />
The Government has two years of its three-year<br />
term to run, but the numbers remain against us in the Senate.<br />
Unless you resolve this situation favourably for the Government,<br />
Australia faces a period of political uncertainty and confusion.<br />
Effective government is impossible unless we can carry out the<br />
policies and programmes you have endorsed. And this becomes<br />
the more necessary in what is clearly a very difficult period<br />
ahead when you consider the international scene.<br />
The broad question you have to decide is whether<br />
you give the Government the means to do its job in the firm,<br />
speedy, decisive way you would wish it to perform.<br />
In the course of the campaign, I shall be telling<br />
you in more detail what we have done at home and abroad since<br />
you elected us for a three-year term last November. I said then<br />
that what we promised we would perform and, indeed, that we would<br />
be doing more than we promised.<br />
This has been done, and more than we promised<br />
has been done and we shall continue to do more as opportunity<br />
offers. We set speedily about the task of giving effect<br />
to our policy undertakings. As soon as the new parliament met,<br />
we busied ourselves putting our promises on to the Statute Book,<br />
We went a stage further in liberalising the means<br />
test. We gave further help to the disabled by the Sheltered<br />
Employment Assistance Bill. We doubled the amount annually<br />
available for science facilities in independent schools. We<br />
established a Commonwealth Ministry of Education and Science.<br />
We made it possible for more young people to<br />
benefit from the Homes Savings Grants Scheme. At the time of<br />
this further liberalisation, some 77,000 young couples had<br />
received home savings grants totalling over thirty-four-and-ahalf<br />
million dollars to assist them to own and establish a<br />
home. We have given effect to our promise to provide an<br />
additional $ 50 million for beef roads.<br />
We have broken new ground in a number of directions<br />
not mentioned last November.<br />
Here is the picture, without going into detail:<br />
In the area of Social Welfare: we have extended<br />
child endowment; we have given social service benefits to the<br />
mentally retarded; we have moved to assist deserted wives; we<br />
have done more to lift the tax burden on elderly people; and<br />
we have worked out a scheme to assist pensioners who need<br />
hearing aids. These may seem small in the national picture, </p>
<p>-4<br />
but each of them meets a special need.<br />
I should add that, following the referendum,<br />
I have set up an Office of Aboriginal Affairs in my own<br />
Department. In the area of National Development, since<br />
last November's election, we have introduced legislation to<br />
cover the new discovery of off-shore oil, which will encourage<br />
investment and iron out problems between the Commonwealth and<br />
the States. In this field of development just to show you<br />
what constantly goes on we have helped Tasmania with the<br />
Gordon River Project and assisted the South Australian gas<br />
pipeline project. We have announced substantial financial<br />
help for the Ord River project in Western Australia and the<br />
Nogoa Dam project in Queensland,<br />
Emergency assistance is constant five States<br />
have been helped with their drought, bushfire and flood<br />
emergencies. I emphasise, however, that I shall not be<br />
outlining a new three-year programme when we still have two<br />
years to run under our presend mandate, We should all be quite<br />
clear about this. The Labor Party may tell you what it would<br />
do if it were in government. But it is not in government, and<br />
is not making a bid for government at this time. You will<br />
remember its spokesmen saying recently that this was not the<br />
time to challenge the Government decisively not even in the<br />
Senate, We were told then that the Labor Party is not yet<br />
ready, but that it will be ready in 1969. We shall be ready<br />
also'.. But what you are to resolve at this moment is whether<br />
the Government you have chosen is to have a majority support<br />
in the Senate in the interests of effective government.<br />
You have much to preserve,. Through the long<br />
period of Liberal leadership, the progress of the Australian<br />
economy has been sure and steady-Our political and economic<br />
stability have greatly promoted our development and our standing<br />
in the eyes of others. We enjoy one of the highest standards<br />
of living in the world. No free industrialised country can<br />
point to as high a level of employment, so consistently<br />
sustained, over a long period of years.<br />
A bigger percentage of Australians own, or are<br />
in process of acquiring, their own homes than exists in any<br />
other part of the world. In the availability of motor vehicles<br />
to the population, we rank second only to the United States.<br />
We are devoting a bigger proportion of our Gross National<br />
Product to investment than any country other than Japan. Over<br />
our period of office, we have increased the provision in the<br />
Butget for social welfare from $ 185 million to $ 1,071 million,<br />
We have increased the provision for defence from $ 108 million<br />
to $ 1,118 million. Even when allowance is made for the increase<br />
in population and changes in the value of money, these facts<br />
confirm spectacular progress. Just think of the diversity of<br />
this great continent, the nature and tempo of its development. __ 7 </p>
<p>5<br />
You would need to travel thousands of miles to understand fully<br />
what is happening. The growth of new towns and new ports in<br />
response to the exploitation of fantastic mineral discoveries<br />
is one exciting part of the picture.<br />
Changes in the past have not only been remarkable<br />
in themselves. They are pointers to the kind of future we want<br />
and for which we plan. We can be confident of this future if<br />
we are given peace, and if we can maintain a continuing<br />
partnership between Government and Industry in a free enterprise<br />
system. We must also think in terms of priorities.<br />
Defence ranks high in our national priorities. This year we are<br />
provising $ 1,118 million, an increase of eighteen per cent over<br />
last year. Five years ago our defence bill was $ 428 million,<br />
nearly $ 700 million less than the estimate for this year. We<br />
have achieved this expansion without serious distortion or<br />
disruption of the domestic economy. It is a high price to pay,<br />
but security is never bought cheaply. And we are firmly<br />
convinced that our domestic programme, the education and health<br />
of our people, our responsibility to the very young and to the<br />
very old all of these things depend upon our security as<br />
a relatively small nation in a large and dangerous part of the<br />
world. Our opponents depict the Government and its<br />
supporters as people who have little concern for those in need<br />
of help whether aged, invalid or disabled, or younger people<br />
having a need for education or, as they marry, a need for<br />
housing. Our record of performance over our period of<br />
Government since you rejected Labor in 1949 gives the lie to that<br />
line of propaganda. Let's follow the figures. The vote for<br />
social welfare in the last Budget introduced by a Labor<br />
Government, provided a total of One hundred and eighty-five<br />
million dollars. Our Budget for this year provides One<br />
thousand and seventy-one million.<br />
Not only has the total provision grown enormously,<br />
but the percentage of the total budget we devote to social<br />
welfare is a higher percentage than in the last Labor Budget.<br />
What is more, this increase in amount and percentage has been<br />
achieved despite the increased provision we have made for<br />
national defence from the low figure of One hundred and four<br />
million dollars in Labor's last Budget to One thousand one<br />
hundred and eighteen million dollars this year.<br />
We have greatly widened the eligibility for<br />
assistance to the aged and invalid. The education of the<br />
young, the provision of housing, the care of the sick and<br />
disabled have led us to introduce many new benefits not in<br />
existence when we came to office. Let me name a few of them:<br />
the provision of pharmaceutical and<br />
medical benefits generally; </p>
<p>-6<br />
the special schemes in these fields for<br />
pensioners;<br />
o the assistance given to provide homes for<br />
the aged;<br />
grants to universities;<br />
the other new policy measures in the<br />
education field which have produced an<br />
increase in Commonwealth provisions for<br />
education from less than Eighteen million<br />
dollars in Labor's last budget to One<br />
hundred and ninety-four million dollars<br />
this year,<br />
All these measures illustrate a concern that the<br />
wealth of a prospering community should contribute to the wellbeing<br />
of people in real need,<br />
These spectacular increases would not have been<br />
possible unless we had succeeded by our policies in developing<br />
and enlarging our economy,<br />
I would like to tell you now a little about our<br />
thinking and hopes in one or two areas of policy which concern<br />
us all,~ The first is education. The sincerity of our<br />
belief that education is important to every Australian and vital<br />
to the nation is, I suggest, proved by our record. We now have<br />
a Ministry of Education and Science. This year, the provision<br />
for education in our budget increased by thirty-five per cent<br />
over that of last year. Large though the growth of the education<br />
vote has been over recent years, this does not prevent us looking<br />
at targets for tomorrow,~ I know my colleague, the Minister for<br />
Education and Science, would like to help children of preschool<br />
age who are put at a disadvantage because of a bad home<br />
environment. At the other end of the scale, he wants to help<br />
talented youngsters who at present cannot pay their way through<br />
universities. He feels, also, that the success of our scheme to<br />
provide science laboratories and equipment invites us now to<br />
look at the Humanities, to the school libraries,<br />
I mention this background of thinking to let<br />
you know we regard policy-making as a continuing process, not<br />
merely as an electioneering device every three years.<br />
Let me give you another illustration, We have<br />
always said, and I repeat the undertaking, that we will continue<br />
to improve our national health scheme. In many parts of the<br />
world, our scheme is regarded as a model., But no plan meets </p>
<p>-7<br />
all human needs, We know we have not yet properly covered<br />
the emergency of long illness. There is anxiety about this,<br />
particularly in old people. Here then is another area of<br />
genuine human need which will take a high priority in our<br />
thinking, What we can do is, of course, governed by<br />
what we have. Money can't be plucked out of the air. But we<br />
do plan constantly to make further progress towards our social<br />
objectives, I come back now to the issue of national security<br />
on which you voted decisively for my Government a year ago.<br />
Let me re-state our foreign policy aims in<br />
relation to South-East Asia of whiL_': Vietnam is a signifcant<br />
part. Our military commitment in South Vietnam arises out of<br />
our larger and long-term assessment of the security of South-East<br />
Asia and our belief that the new nations that have come into<br />
being there should be allowed to survive as independent<br />
communities. We believe this in their interests and in ours.<br />
When we committed ourselves to the defence of<br />
South Vietnam, we did so in the belief that the fact of aggression<br />
in South Vietnam was real, as was the threat of its expansion<br />
through other parts of South-East Asia, We have no cause to<br />
alter our assessment, We believedthen, and we still believe,<br />
that a successful communist takeover of any of the directlyaffected<br />
nations would not only be disastrous to the peoples<br />
of those countries, but would weaken, and in time destroy, the<br />
capacity of other nations of South-East Asia to maintain their<br />
own independence. We share the view of the Government of the<br />
United States and of the governments of the free countries of<br />
South-East Asia and the Pacific that the transfer of the area to<br />
communist control, either by subversion or aggression, would<br />
doom the peoples of the area to domination and servitude.<br />
Who can deny that the unchecked advance of<br />
communist subversion and aggression in South-East Asia would be<br />
a threat to our own national interests? Our powerful ally,<br />
the United States, has assessed that it would be a threat to its<br />
national interests. For us, in our geographical and strategic<br />
position, the threat would be very much greater,<br />
But there is a more positive and constructive<br />
side to our policies. The new nations of South-East Asia,<br />
although beset by difficult political and economic challenges,<br />
are real national entities with commendable purposes and a<br />
vision for their future progress which is worth backing. Their<br />
chances must fail unless external aggression and subversion<br />
are held at bay. Already the other free nations of the area<br />
have benefited from allied intervention in South Vietnam. They<br />
have been able to go ahead with economic development and there<br />
is today more genuine co-operation for peaceful, constructive<br />
purposes than these countries have ever previously known.<br />
These are the bedrock reasons for our policy<br />
and our commitment. </p>
<p>-8<br />
The course of the immediate conflict in South<br />
Vietnam does not alter the fundamental reasons for our policies.<br />
But I have re-stated them here, because it is for you to weigh<br />
them against the newest policy decisions of the Australian<br />
Labor Party, It is clear from the decisions taken by the<br />
Federal Conference of the ALP at Adelaide, that the Party has,<br />
in substance, the same policy on Australia's military presence<br />
in Vietnam that it had at the general election last year. The<br />
United States is given an unacceptable ultimatum, But if it<br />
is not accepted, Labor says that Australian troops will be<br />
withdrawn. A Labor Government would scrap the foreign<br />
policy which the Australian people Dverwhelmingly endorsed a<br />
year ago. It would, for all practical military purposes, turn<br />
its back on South Vietnam, and reduce our American alliance to<br />
a meaningless set of pious words.<br />
The issue is not whether we want peace in Vietnam.<br />
We all want peace in Vietnam. The issue is whether an<br />
Australian foreign policy, which attaches immense importance<br />
to the American alliance and to the independence of the free<br />
countries of South-East Asia, is to be preserved or destroyed,<br />
So the Senate election, among other things, is<br />
an opportunity for the Australian people to say again where they<br />
stand in relation to their own vital national interests., This<br />
is, I repeat, even more important than at the time of the<br />
House of Representatives election a year ago. Since then the<br />
intentions of Britain east of Suez have been made known.<br />
While you are making your assessments about our<br />
position internationally you should take into account the<br />
British Government's decision to make a phased, but total,<br />
military withdrawal from the mainland of South-East Asia by<br />
the mid-seventies. Australia, its allies, and its friends will,<br />
as a consequence, be engaged in close and far-reaching consultations.<br />
I put it to you that we must, in these circumstances,<br />
have in office a government with a consistent and intelligible<br />
foreign policy a government which can work in close<br />
co-operation with allies who see the needs of the area much as<br />
we do. I mention, in particular, our American allies.<br />
I was sharply reminded of the Labor Party's<br />
isolationism in foreign affairs when I attended the opening of<br />
the United States Naval Communication Station at North West<br />
Cape as recently as September 16. Here was tangible, exciting<br />
proof of the reality of our ANZUS Treaty with the United Statesa<br />
dramatic example of the " effictive self-help and mutual aid"<br />
described in Article 11 of the Treaty.<br />
But have you forgotten that if the Labor Party<br />
had been in power in 1963 there would have been no North West<br />
Cape Station? When the United States Naval Communication<br />
Station Agreement Bill was before Parliament, the Labor Party<br />
produced an amendment designed to deny to the United States<br />
sole control of the station. The Labor Party served notice of<br />
impossible terms on the United States. When defeated on this, </p>
<p>9-<br />
the Labor Party moved that the third reading of the Bill should<br />
be postponed for six months-This, in plain language, was an<br />
attempt to kill the Bill,<br />
But today we don't hear any apology from the Labor<br />
Party for its wrong thinking in 1963, Instead we find a<br />
perpetuation of the folly in Labor's present attitude to our<br />
obligations under the American alliance. But there is nothing<br />
new about the Labor Party's dangerous isolationism in foreign<br />
policy. It emerges all along the line, It is a danger signal<br />
a warning we should all take note of<br />
So I say again that the issues of national<br />
security are still paramount-Let me put it to you in the<br />
simplest terms: The security of this country depends very<br />
largely upon how far we can have South-East Asian countries<br />
kept out of the hands of the communists. If -these countries did<br />
fall to communism, we in Australia would be a very exposed and,<br />
in terms of trade and area co-operation, a much more isolated and<br />
restricted nation.. That's the heart of the political argument in this<br />
country, We believe -and the majority of Australians shared<br />
our belief a year ago -that the external policies of the Labor<br />
Party are to put it bluntly -suicidal,<br />
So I ask you to take this Senate campaign very<br />
seriously. It so happens that the Labor Party's leaders in the<br />
Senate enjoy the support of the Party masters outside<br />
Parliament who would weaken the alliances which are the keystone<br />
of our security. All that we have worked for and built up<br />
over the years could be quickly and disastrously undermined if<br />
the voice of the Labor Party's policy-makers became the voice<br />
of Australia, As I said earlier, political instability and<br />
uncertainty are inevitable when a government with a big majority<br />
in the House of Representatives is in a minority in the Senate.<br />
We want that position resolved in the interests of effective<br />
government. But we also hope that you will record a positive<br />
Senate vote for the Government as a reaffirmation of what you<br />
said a year ago. What we plan for the well-being of Australians<br />
and the development of our country must not be put at risk,<br />
I put it as high as that with confidence,<br />
because I don't think the Australian people change their minds<br />
from day to day on basic questions of national security and<br />
survival nor, for that matter, on basic questions of their<br />
country's economic strength and their own welfare. </p>
