    <content><![CDATA[<p>Fellow members of the great Australian family.</p>
<p>When the histories of nations are written, there are times which sorely test each nation's soul. </p>
<p>Whether through the carnage of human conflict or through the terrifying forces of nature unleashed.</p>
<p>This nation Australia has just been put to such a test.</p>
<p>And you the people of Australia, you the people of Victoria, and most especially you the people of these fire-ravaged communities - you have faced the test - and you have not been found wanting.</p>
<p>As a people, we weep for the lost. </p>
<p>We tend the injured. </p>
<p>We console the suffering.</p>
<p>And yet our work has barely begun.</p>
<p>In meeting this great test, as a people, and as a nation, we have drawn deep on our ancient values and given them fresh voice in our modern age. </p>
<p>Values of courage. </p>
<p>Values of compassion. </p>
<p>Values of steely resilience. </p>
<p>These are Australian values. Values also of our deepest common humanity.</p>
<p>For on Black Saturday, what we saw at work was the worst of nature yet the best of humanity.</p>
<p>What is courage?</p>
<p>We know it by instinct. We see it. We feel it.</p>
<p>Courage is a fire fighter standing before the gates of hell - unflinching, and unyielding and with eyes of steel saying this: "Here I stand, I can do no other". </p>
<p>Courage is neighbour saving neighbour.</p>
<p>Courage is stranger saving stranger.</p>
<p>Courage is all these things as brave women and men in their lives and in their deeds these last weeks have written a new chapter in our nation's story.</p>
<p>A new army of heroes where the yellow helmet evokes the same reverence as the slouch hat of old.</p>
<p>Courage. And compassion.</p>
<p>In recent days, we have witnessed unspeakable suffering.</p>
<p>We have lost mothers and fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters, the tiniest of children, family and friends and neighbours.</p>
<p>All these are precious lives. No words can provide solace for grief so personal.</p>
<p>But simply know this: you who suffer are not alone.</p>
<p>This great Australian family, here assembled and across the nation today, is with you. And led by an almighty army of Australian volunteers stretched across this vast continent. </p>
<p>And beyond our shores, know too that you are also surrounded by an ocean of compassion from every country on God's earth.</p>
<p>In some countries, tragedy exposes the fault lines in a nation. </p>
<p>The strong abandoning the weak; one region indifferent to the sufferings of another, one culture uncaring as to the needs of another. </p>
<p>But ours is a different nation. Our nation has been as one.</p>
<p>Australia - a nation of compassion. Courage and compassion. And the third of these great values: resilience.</p>
<p>What we have seen in each of these communities is resilience writ large. </p>
<p>Resilience reflected in the absolute and resolute determination to rebuild. </p>
<p>And this is where the nation comes in.</p>
<p>A solemn contract with each of these communities to rebuild: brick by brick, home by home, school by school, church by church, street by street, community by community. </p>
<p>Governments of all persuasions and at all levels have failed communities in the past. Let us resolve not to fail these communities in the future.</p>
<p>To say this is easy. To do this will be hard and the path will be uneven. </p>
<p>But let us resolve, learning from the mistakes of the past, to rebuild together.</p>
<p>To rebuild Marysville, Narbethong and Toolangi.</p>
<p>To rebuild Kinglake, Kinglake West and Flowerdale.</p>
<p>Strathewen, St Andrews and Humevale.</p>
<p>Wandong, Heathcote Junction and Upper Plenty. </p>
<p>Churchill, Callignee and Koornalla. </p>
<p>Steels Creek and Yarra Glen. </p>
<p>These names and others that are now etched deep in the nation's memory.</p>
<p>For the truth is this: each of these communities is Australia - and we would be a lesser Australia without any of them. So let us to the task.</p>
<p>Last Sunday as I travelled on the road to Kinglake, it was as if I was walking through the valley of the shadow of death.</p>
<p>Last night I spoke with a young woman from a community nearby who had lost everything but survived. She told me she had spent yesterday with her Dad, starting to clean up the wreckage.</p>
<p>She told me the first thing they did was to plant a charred sapling in the burnt ground as their flag pole - and put up our nation's flag.</p>
<p>She told me she and her Dad then sat quietly together just looking at the flag - and then to work.</p>
<p>Our nation's flag now flies across the charred remains of these precious communities - flags by the hundred.</p>
<p>Flags of courage. Flags of compassion. Flags of resilience. Flags of hope.</p>
<p>Great Australian values that will see Australia through this great testing of our nation's soul.</p>
<p>So let us resolve today that from this time forth, on every 7th of February, this nation's flag will fly at half mast, this nation will pause for a moment's silence, to honour those lost and to reaffirm afresh, this great rebuilding for the future.</p>
<p>As we rise together in hope, from the ashes of despair.</p>
