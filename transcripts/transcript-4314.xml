FOR PRESS 9 FEBRUARY 1978<br />
AUSTRALIAN. AMBASSADOR TO UNESCO<br />
The Prime Minister announced the appointment of Sir John Kerr<br />
as Australian Ambassador to UNESCO.<br />
Sir John, former Governor-General of Australia, retired in<br />
December and is at present on a private tour overseas.<br />
The position of Ambassador to UNESCO was created during the<br />
administration of the former Government. The Ambassador was<br />
withdrawn in September 1976 and his functions reverted to the<br />
Ambassador to France, His Excellency Mr H. D. Anderson, O. B.. E.<br />
Since then, the commitments to Australia arising from its<br />
membership of UNESCO, coupled with our growing relations wiLth<br />
France, have led the Government to conclude that the two functions<br />
should again be separated.<br />
The Prime Minister said that he regarded Sir John Kerr as<br />
admirably qualified for the post of Ambassador. Apart from his<br />
distinguished career in the law and as Chief Justice of New<br />
South Wales, his knowledge of Australia and Australians, together<br />
with his wide experience of educational, cultural and other-aspects<br />
of public life, would be valuable assets to him in representing<br />
Australia in this important international organisation.<br />
Sir John's appointment will be for three years. He will bE!<br />
based in Paris. AUSTRALIA </p>
