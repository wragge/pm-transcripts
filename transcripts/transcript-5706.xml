FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 4 DECEMBER, 1981<br />
ALCOA SMELTER AT PORTLAND<br />
I am delighted that negotiations between ALCOA and the<br />
State have placed ALCOA on a " secure footing. The people<br />
in Portland have been enormously worried over recent weeks.<br />
Those concerns can now be put aside and positive planning<br />
ca~ i proceed for the future.-The dreams we have for Portland<br />
are in the process of becoming a reality.<br />
