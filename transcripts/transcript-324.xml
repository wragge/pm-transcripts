P. M. No. 24/ 1961<br />
FUNDS FOR HOUSING<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, said today that the<br />
Government had decided on further action, through the<br />
Cormonwealth Savings Bank and through the War Service Homes<br />
Division, which would provide a prompt stimulus to home<br />
building. An increase in the rate of home building would<br />
produce useful consequential effects in the timber, textile and<br />
furnishing industries, as well as those producing other types of<br />
domestic equipment and supplies.<br />
Earlier this year the Reserve Bank had askod the<br />
Savings Banks to increase their rate of lending for housing in<br />
the present quarter, and they were doing this. The Trading Banks<br />
were also currently lending for housing at a higher rate than in<br />
the March quarter. The two member banks of the Commonwealth<br />
Banking Corporation involved in these arrangements the<br />
Commonwealth Trading Bank and the Commonwealth Savings Bank<br />
were playing their full part. It had now been arranged as a<br />
special move for the Commonwalth Savings Bank to expand<br />
substantially its rate of lending for housing during the next<br />
few months. Port of the funds to be made available would be<br />
lent direct to individual borrowers from the Savings Bank, but<br />
a large proportion would be placed through building and housing<br />
societies. Assurances had been received from the building<br />
societies that they are in a position to make quick use of<br />
additional funds.<br />
With regard to Uar Service Homes, the Government would<br />
in the existing circumstances make, for the time being, a<br />
special arranement to eliminate waiting times for new homes.<br />
Details would be announced shortly by the Minister for National<br />
Development, Senator Spooner.<br />
Prior to this decision, applicants for new houses were<br />
required to wait from three to eighteen months according to<br />
the way in which they arranged for their houses to be built.<br />
Under the new arrangement, finance would be promptly available<br />
over the coming months for the building of new War Service<br />
Homes with no waiting tine at al]..<br />
Mr. Menzies said that the Govrnment had, throughout<br />
its term of office, recognised in a practical ' ay the<br />
importance of sustaining home building at a desirable level.<br />
Apart from action taken through the banking system, the total<br />
amount of finance provided through the Commonwealth Budget in<br />
1960-61 for 4ar Service Homes (œ 35 million) under the Housing<br />
Agreement with the States (œ 37 million), and in other ways was<br />
more than œ 80 million. Legislation had been passed in the<br />
latest Session of Parliament to enable a renewal of the<br />
Commuonwealth/ States Housing Agreement.<br />
