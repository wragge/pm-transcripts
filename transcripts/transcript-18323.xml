Prime Minister Julia Gillard and NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell today celebrated the 100th test match at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) by announcing a $186 million upgrade to the Bradman, Noble and Messenger Stands.</p>
<p>The NSW Government will contribute $86 million to the project, while the Australian Government and the Sydney Cricket and Sports Ground Trust will contribute $50 million each.</p>
<p>Work will start shortly after the Australia v India One Day International in February with the project scheduled to be completed before the 2014 Ashes test match between Australia and England.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister called the Sydney Cricket Ground an iconic sporting arena in NSW and Australia.</p>
<p>Today marks the beginning of the next stage of SCG's development to ensure it maintains its rightful place as a world-class sporting facility.</p>
<p>This is an exciting project, not only for Sydneysiders but for all Australians, who have grown up watching the New Year's Test and relishing in the history and tradition of the ground.</p>
<p>Mr O'Farrell said the upgrade to the ground was a fitting way to celebrate the SCG's 100thtest match.</p>
<p>âThe world's finest cricketers have stepped onto the hallowed turf of the SCG and it's only fitting NSW has a ground to match their exploits,â he said.</p>
<p>âThe new development will ensure spectators have fantastic facilities, while preserving the history of the Members and Ladies Stands.</p>
<p>âThis is a win for cricket and AFL fans and the upgrade will create hundreds of jobs during its construction providing a great boost to the building industry,â Mr O'Farrell said.</p>
<p>Spectators have been made the priority with no columns in the new seating area ensuring sightlines are unaffected, and up to 85% of seating being under cover.</p>
<p>Replacement of the Noble, Bradman and Messenger stands is aimed at improving spectator enjoyment and also providing state-of-the-art facilities for corporate and media interests.</p>
<p>Plans also include the largest video screen at any Australian sports ground, 700 person dining room, three new bar areas and secure player facilities.</p>
<p>Once construction is complete the capacity of the SCG will increase from 45,000 to 48,000.</p>
