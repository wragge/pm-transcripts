PRIME MINISTER 1 JULY, 1980<br />
ADDRESS TO PUBLIC FUNCTIO'N<br />
BR00131. WESTERN AUSTR--ALIA<br />
Thank you very much indeed for that welcome. I am glad that<br />
you have said the things you have about your owm concerns,<br />
because one of the very real values to me in coming to the<br />
north west of Western Australia and spending the best part<br />
of a week in the northern and western part of the Kalgoorlie<br />
electorate, is to hear what people have to say and to know<br />
what you are concerned about. Therefore, it gives me an idea<br />
in the way in which Government policies can perhaps be modified<br />
to meet those concerns where we believe it is fair and proper.<br />
It is always a very welcome thing-when Tamie and myself get<br />
out of Canberra and get to some of the more distant parts<br />
of Australia. It is part of the job as Prime Minister that we<br />
both enjoy best. I certainly do.<br />
I would like to make a comment or two about the things that<br />
you mentioned-if I could. Also, maybe about a couple of other<br />
things. I agree with you that it is a very long while since zone<br />
allowances have been reviewed. But also I want to tell the<br />
story about how we have been told by our own legal advisers<br />
that we could not adjust the zone allowance because the allowance<br />
in any case is unconstitutional; and if you made the adjustment<br />
to it, it would be challenged. Therefore, you should not do<br />
anythingy. You should just leave it alone. But then having been<br />
told that, I wanted to put that as a reason in any correspondence<br />
to people who had written to me, to people whio had spoken to<br />
me on the subject, as to why the Governmiient had not been able<br />
to act. Because we had certainly not acted in these matters<br />
on the basis of policy, but on the basis of what had been the<br />
advise that we had been given. But then I was also told that<br />
it would be : very u-nwise to tell anyone that that was the reason<br />
why we could not act. Even though it was the real reason we<br />
should not say so. Well, that being so, so far as I am concerned,<br />
that-particular reason just does riot exist. We are looking at<br />
the zone allowances in relation to the next Budget and doing it<br />
in a very realistic way. </p>
<p>-2<br />
If you say you are looking at something, that is not a promise.<br />
You will have to listen in to John Howard on 19 August to see<br />
what we do or do not do. But what I am saying is-that that so-called<br />
legal reason for not adjusting the zone allowances has been washed<br />
right out of our hair. We will be looking at it. If decisions are<br />
taken, a good deal of the ' credit will go to Mick Cotter who has<br />
been arguing very strongly about the zone allowance, about the need<br />
for an adjustment.<br />
One of the best decisions because it is a firm decision that we<br />
have taken is to put up that satellite. It is going to take some<br />
time. The planning is going ahead. It is going to take a few<br />
years before it becomes operative. But we are doing it because<br />
we are conscious of the sense of isolation, the sense of remoteness<br />
and the difficulties with telephones, telecommunications and also<br />
the inability in a number of areas to get other forms of<br />
conmunication television and what have you. When that satellite<br />
is operational, it basically is going to mean that people in<br />
Australia, wherever they are, whether it is the country towns or<br />
whether it is in the north west Kununurra or Derby or Broome<br />
they are going to get the same kinds of communications that are<br />
available to people in Perth and in-capital cities. That, in a<br />
sense, should help to build feeling and understanding of the<br />
community in Australia of a kind that maybe has not been possible<br />
because of remoteness and distance and isolation, and the difficulty<br />
of communication. The fact that the satellite planning is going ahead<br />
and it will be proceeded with as rapidly as we can, but it is a<br />
major project that will take time. That is not a reason for not<br />
trying to improve communications meanwhile. In a number of areas<br />
television will be available from October onwards through the north<br />
west of Western Australia.-the ABC station.. . The start was made.<br />
then progressively over a fair number of areas. Mick, what is the<br />
starting date here? October. The starting date here is October.<br />
Also, Mick Cotter has put in a special plea for upgrading the<br />
telephone system because of the problems and breakdowns, which I<br />
have been told about wherever I go. Unfortunately well, I will take<br />
it as though it had hap'pened differently but, unfortunately the<br />
telephonists along the route had not been told to give me the<br />
0proper treatment and whenever a ' phone call for me had been booked<br />
I had been connected through whether it was to Sir Charles Court<br />
or whoever else very quickly and very clearly on a wonderful line<br />
that did not break down. That is the only sign of lack of organisation<br />
that 1 have noticed over the last two or three days. With the<br />
normal sort of competent Western Australian organisation I would<br />
have expected that at least I would find it very difficult, if not<br />
impossible to make any kind of telephone calls at all. But in spite<br />
of that, I am prepared to accept the overwhelming body of evidence<br />
which has been presented to me, that in a number of areas improvements<br />
are needed.<br />
Again I cannot promise what we can get Telecom to do, but I know<br />
Mick Cotter has been arguing the case for quite some time, and I also<br />
will look into it with Tony Staley, the Minister in charge. as soon as<br />
I get back to Canberra. </p>
<p>-3<br />
The question of domestic air fares' is a difficult one. I can<br />
understand how important it is and also how expensive it is.<br />
Because there is no easy solution, we have established a special<br />
air fares inquiry to examine the basis of domestic air fares which<br />
might provide a means of giving some kind of solution to the problems<br />
of distance and to the kind of problems that you get out in<br />
Western Australia and also in some other places. Tasmania has<br />
special problems because they have no land communication and<br />
depend very' greatly on air. So it is not only the problems of<br />
remoteness on the mainland, of Australia, there are other+ matters<br />
that also need looking at.<br />
I took out comparisons in domestic air fares they are of course<br />
more expensive than international ones, as everyone knowsto<br />
see what the position was in the United States or within Europe<br />
which really is one system in a sense in an air fare sense one<br />
country.", The internal Australian fares are basically a bit cheaper<br />
than in the United States, and a very great deal cheaper or if you<br />
like less expensive than in Europe. That does not mean we sit back<br />
* and say there is nothing we can do lout it. The matter has to be<br />
examined. Ralph Hunt is re-negotiating the two-airline agreement<br />
now. We want to try and loosen it up, establish more competition, and<br />
try and get better services that way. That is one way. How far we<br />
can in fact loosen the two-airline agreement to make more competition<br />
has yet to be determined. But we have given Ralph Hunt some we<br />
have determined guidelines for discussion with the two airlines.<br />
The very fact that TAA is going to bring in one form of new aircraft<br />
the European Airbus and that Ansett are going a different route,<br />
they are going to get 737s which is a very good aircraft, and then a<br />
Boeing Airbus the very fact that they will have different aircraft<br />
for the first time for a long while, carrying different numbers of<br />
passengers and aircraft having different characteristics, will meanI<br />
that they will be running different schedules at different times,<br />
different frequencies, and that in itself 1 think is going to be of<br />
some advantage to the travelling public. The problem of costs of<br />
air fares to you is a very real one. We will be looking closely at<br />
the report of the air fares inquiry when that is available to us.<br />
There are other matters which briefly, I would like to touch on.<br />
Our fuel pricing policy is one which affects people in remote areas,<br />
and is not a policy that we as a Government liked having, to introduce.<br />
As a farmer, it is not a policy whose effects I like. I am sure that<br />
is the same for a great many people right around Australia. But we<br />
introduced the policy because we are quite certain in our minds, that<br />
it is right for Australia. While we have about 65% self-sufficiency<br />
in petrol, if there were no exploration and no development,' no<br />
development of alternative forms or sources of energy, that<br />
self-sufficiency will run doi~ m very, very quickly as we get to the<br />
latter part of the 1980s. When that happens, we would be forced to+<br />
go if we did not have some alternative forced to go onto the<br />
international market with spot prices much, much higher than the<br />
prices that we now pay, much higher than the benchmark world parity<br />
price which is the Saudi Arabia price; where prices may be<br />
40% or even 50% higher than that. We would in a sense, be<br />
beggars for fuel. The price all of us would have to pay then, would<br />
be much higher than the kind of prices paid now. / 4 </p>
<p>Quite apart from that, it would be~ a very selfish policy for us<br />
in our time and our generation, to use up all the Bass Strait<br />
resources and to use it up cheaply, and not make allowance and plan<br />
for Australia in the years ahead. It would be a policy for ourselves<br />
and it would be a policy against the best interests-of our kids<br />
and the future of this country. I think that would be a very<br />
selfish way to approach. our present problemns. But the policy is not<br />
only leading to some reduction in the use of petrol, Esso and BHP<br />
have commnitted themselves to $ 1,200 million worth of exploration<br />
and development over the next three or four years as a result of<br />
the policy. That will lead to greater reserves, greater development.<br />
I think even more important than that, the vast shale oil<br />
reserves in Queensland are now likely to be developed, and our hope<br />
and objective is that the Rundle shale oil deposit the first of<br />
them: that is, an agreement between the-Rundle partners and Esso<br />
should come on stream about the time the Bass Strait reserves start<br />
to run down. On the present pricing policies, we are told that<br />
the development of fuel oil shale will be profitable. It is going<br />
to cost several billion dollars. -I am told this may be as much<br />
as two or three times the total capital cost of the N~ orth West Shelf;<br />
and that is going to be about $ 4,000 billion. The capital needed,<br />
the funds needed, to convert shale to oil in the quantities that<br />
will be required for Australia's purposes are huge ones indeed. It<br />
just will not happen if those who invest their funds are not going<br />
to get a profit out of it. As a result of our policies, it now looks<br />
as though that Rundle project will go ahead. If that is so, that<br />
will just be the first of a number of shale oil developments leading<br />
to Australia's self-sufficiency and self-reliance in the years ahead.<br />
Beyond that of course, to try and make the policy less unpalatable<br />
in the distant parts of the country, we have a freight equalisation<br />
policy, which this coming year will cost about $ 130 million. That<br />
does subsidise the cost of freight movement to within half a cent<br />
or a bit less a litre. Other things being equal, that should mean<br />
that the price in places outside of Perth is not going to be more<br />
than a couple of cents a gallon in the old terminology above<br />
the capital city price. But that is not the way it is, because<br />
retail margins-which we found in effect vary with good reason,<br />
0 sometimes, but that is within the province of the States. do vary<br />
greatly in different places, and also I an afraid the wholesale price<br />
of petrol also varies in deliveries ' in different areas. These<br />
matters are being looked at, but what will come out of that examination<br />
at the moment I cannot predict. The freight equalisation policy does<br />
reduce the cost in-remote country areas very considerably: less than<br />
it would otherwise be. The extent of it can be judged by its total<br />
cost of about $ 120 $ 125 million in this coming financial year.<br />
Mr. Shire President, you mentioned problems of defence. We are giving<br />
much greater attention to matters in the Indian Ocean. We co-operate<br />
in surveillance in the Indian Ocean with the United States. We have<br />
offered them access to our ownm facilities in Cockburn Sound, and to<br />
our air bases if they should need them for their own foi'ces to assist<br />
in-their own deployments. I know they have had teams out here<br />
examining the Cockburn Sound naval base and were very impressed by the.<br />
facilities. What kind of result, they come to I am not able to judge<br />
at the moment, but they were impressed. The additional costs they<br />
would have to provide to those facilities for their use was a good<br />
deal less than I think they had anticipated. That is a very real<br />
possibility. We are home porting, by 1983; our own ships. </p>
<p>They are base ported there now, but their families are still at<br />
other places. When they are ho-, e ported, that means their families<br />
will be based also at Cockburn Sound. Then, genuinely, we will be<br />
meeting our~ obligations for a two-ocean navy.<br />
We are looking at-a location for another patrol home base and<br />
that is going to be very important somewhere off this north w., est<br />
coastline. The new air base at Derby is -going to start construction<br />
this coming yrear. It will cost just short of about $ 50 million.<br />
It W~ ill be a very major facility. This morning we went out to look<br />
at the area w-here it is going, to be built, and we are very glad to<br />
have the full co-operation of the W . estern Australian Government in<br />
matters in relation to that, so that construction can start as<br />
soon as possible. it will be a major airfield, capable of taking,<br />
any kind of aircraft, capable of mounting any kind of military<br />
operation or exercise that might be necessary.<br />
As a result of changes over the last year or two in particular, we<br />
are pursuing an upgraded defence effort. Weare also going to, over the<br />
next 12 months, increase the size of the reserve Army forces, the<br />
citizen forces, from 22,000 to about 30,000 throughout the whole<br />
country. We will be looking for the co-operation of all employers<br />
and the young men in Australia in enabling us to meet that objective,<br />
because we think these things are important for the future of the<br />
country. The last thing, and I think the most important. There is a feeling<br />
of optimism throughout Australia. I can see an enormous feeling of<br />
optimism in Western Australia, very much as a result of the policies<br />
and energies and initiative of Sir Charles Court, who is truly a<br />
great Premier who has worked for this State over such a long period.<br />
But also I believe, because we have now got a general economic<br />
position in Australia that is a much healthier position. Our rate<br />
of inflation, while too high, is less than half that of the United<br />
Kingdom, about 5 percentage points less than the United States, and<br />
despite inflationary pressures that have affected us and every<br />
country in the world over the past couple of years, the increase in<br />
Sthe rate of inflation in Australia has been much less than nearly<br />
Wevery other industrialised country; much less than Japan and Germanythe<br />
increase less than Japan and Germany, which have traditionally,<br />
over all this difficult period, managed their economies well. That<br />
of course mneans that our exports are more como,, etitive. Our -manufactured<br />
exports are growing rapidly. Our farmers are able to do better. NI" ore<br />
people are encouraged to invest in the great mining and mineral<br />
processes of this State and of other parts of the Commonwealth.<br />
Because we do have significant reserves of energy, not petrol, but coal<br />
and natural gas, and because we can produce electricity cheaper than<br />
many countries, we are attracting to Australia more investment from<br />
overseas, mnore processing. There is $ 4 billion in aluminium processing<br />
being invested right at this moment in nearly every State. That is<br />
just an example of what I believe will be happening as we go through<br />
the decade of the 1980s. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
For the rural industry, we have negotiated better markets. I<br />
do not think we will ever again see the kind of situation where<br />
we lost our market in Europe in one year and then totally lost our<br />
market in beef in Japan the next, without any protest really from<br />
the Government of the day. The Japanese market has now built up<br />
again to a good level and is growing. In Europe, even there the<br />
door has opened a little, and the markets in the United States<br />
have security and are guaranteed, which they have not had in the<br />
past. That'access which we have negotiated for over the last two<br />
or three years is of vast importance to the beef industry in very<br />
large parts of Australia. Rural industries, providing we get the<br />
seasons and the rain that is necessary, i think are entitled to<br />
look to a reasonable position over the coming period.<br />
