SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE RT. HON. R. G.<br />
MENZIES, AT THE ANNUAL MEETIN4 ROYAL PRINCE ALFRED<br />
HOSPITAL. SYDNEY. ON THE 9TH DACEMBER. 1960.<br />
Sir, and Sir Charles, and ladies and gentlemen:<br />
I'm in a very low state today, having been out of my<br />
bed last night until 4+ o'clock helping to make a mess of<br />
Parliamentary proceedings. And I am therefore liable, I warn<br />
you, at any tick of the clock, to go to sleep, even before you<br />
do. ( Laughter) But at any rate I have been fascinated this<br />
afternoon by a variety of matters. One in particular is that a<br />
mystery has been solved. I knew that my distinguished<br />
colleague, Dr. Cameron, was an old Royal Prince Alfred man he<br />
never ceases to let us undorstand that; it seems to be almost<br />
a point of pride.<br />
I also knew that, like his predecessor in the office<br />
of Minister for Health, he has an almost diabolical faculty for<br />
getting a few more millions out of us evcry year, than in the<br />
year before; and occasionally, as he knows I will take him on<br />
one side in a fatherly way, and rebuku him lor this<br />
extravagance. , Today the mystery is solved he was trained under<br />
this chap. ( Laughter)( Applause) I realise now that whenever<br />
Don Cameron is having a civilised and cautious moment, this man<br />
gets hold of him, and addresses him, and throws in a few<br />
humorous and disarming remarks and gets away with the booty.<br />
( Laughter) Well, Sir, I hope you will continue to get away with<br />
the booty. I was very delighted to have the chance of coming<br />
here for two or throe ruasons, with all the details of which I<br />
won't weary you.<br />
But I did observe that this Hospital began as a<br />
University School of Medicine. I put it in a very approximate<br />
way. That has not been the uniform pattern in Australia, not<br />
the normal line of development in Australia.<br />
It does mean that it has had, and continues to have<br />
a close communion with the University in point of ideas, and in<br />
point of space. The; r-,' ore it-stands as a great instrument of<br />
healing and a great ins trument of instruction. I can~ t imagine<br />
a more remarkable and romantic history, than this Hospital has<br />
had. But until I came out here this afternoon I had no<br />
idea that it was far more than what I think of as a hospital<br />
you know, a hospital, a good modern hospital, with superb<br />
accommiodation for the patients, and even more superb acconmmodation<br />
for the nurses, which I think is a splendid idea,<br />
You see these tall buildings standing up into the<br />
sky? This, Sir Herbert describes in a rare flash of modesty,<br />
as a village it struck me as being a city! This enormous<br />
jurisdiction of his is so great that really he should have been<br />
made Lord Mayor ( Laughter) of Royal Prince Alfred. I will<br />
convey that suggestion to my distinguished colleague from the<br />
State Government. But it really is a fantastic thiing. You are used to<br />
it; Itm not. All this car-e to Lie with the charm of novelty </p>
<p>0 2.<br />
that you should have, not only what you can recognise as HQspital<br />
buildings, nurses' homes and so on these are orthodox. and<br />
identifiable._-but you go along the. . streetl<br />
I have been taken up. to. a centre-just-up the street<br />
which I found quite fabulous, in which rehabilitation is going<br />
on, in which people are being given all the psychological<br />
stimulus of being able to work, and produce things and feel that<br />
they are doing something for themselves and doing it side by<br />
side with other people who are handicapped; and being, in the<br />
case of the last building I went into, managed by two people who<br />
are themselves, not without physical handicaps.<br />
This is, I think, a tremendous, exciting sort of<br />
thing. I em sure that if I had time to go around all the<br />
streets in this hospital city I would find not only some tumbledown<br />
looking houses which I haven't failed to observe but I<br />
would find studded here and there, some new manifestation of an<br />
activity of a hospital which I venture to say nobody, when I was<br />
a boy, ever thought of.<br />
That, to me, is the remarkable thing. What was<br />
orthodox, years ago, still remains orthodox in a sense; but it<br />
has had added to it as the imagination of men and women has<br />
laid hold of subjects and problems an almost infinite variety<br />
of activities designed to restore the body, and the mind and<br />
the spirit. Now those things happen in the world; they are among<br />
the great evidences of civilisation in a century which has not<br />
been conspicuous for civilisation. But here you have great<br />
evidences of the essence of humanity.<br />
I have had a good deal of experience in another field,<br />
as you know, and I long since learned that the ancient<br />
philosopher was right when he said: " I seek a man, I seek a man".<br />
There's hardly a problem that I have over had to look at which<br />
was intrinsically difficult of solution by an intellectual<br />
process, but which could not really be solved in practice unless<br />
you could put your hand on the right man to take responsibility<br />
for it, to direct it, to imagine it, to see it through.<br />
We are so much disposed, ourselves to attend to our<br />
own affairs in life that we occasionally fail to identify the<br />
true leaders of community effort. But every now and then you<br />
will come across one. You have one, today, in the chair.<br />
( Applause) I can't imagine that what has gone on in this great<br />
Hospital could have gone on as far or as fast if it were not for<br />
this cheerful, dynamic, driving personality of Sir Herbert<br />
Schlink. Therefore, we ought to praise famous men and I would<br />
like, on your behalf, to praise him today. Bcauso this is a<br />
grea life work.<br />
There is another thing that I would like to say just a<br />
word or two about. Reference was made both by Sir Herbert and<br />
Sir Charles about the teaching hospitals, which of course,<br />
brings us at once to the broad, educational field.<br />
I, of course, discard this rather hilarious<br />
epigrammatic remark made by the Chairman, that he would sooner<br />
be healthy than educated. He can afford to say that because<br />
he is both. ( Laughter) Therefore I twit him with having made<br />
the most purely academic observation this afternoon, that I ever<br />
heard him make. </p>
<p>The truth of the matter is and this is how I have<br />
approached this problem myself that thG teaching hospitals in<br />
their teaching aspects are part of the educational structure,<br />
and ought to be looked at as part of the university structure<br />
of the country. You can't just detach them and say that one has<br />
no relation to the other.<br />
That is why, when the now Universities Cormission was<br />
appointed, it took early steps to establish a committee of<br />
advice on this very matter, I having stated to them that I<br />
thought that this was properly to be considered as part of the<br />
overall university problem of the country.<br />
I see here this aftornoon representatives of the<br />
residential colleges. There again is an evidence that you<br />
can't look at the problem of university education, except in the<br />
most comprehensive fashion; you can't cut it down to a few<br />
narrow ideas. It is ten years now since I was told by one or two<br />
members of the first Committee which I established on this<br />
problem that residential colleges in universities were luxuries<br />
and that they really ought to look after themselves.<br />
I reject that idea. I reject it because I am a great<br />
believer in education, a great believer, if I may make so<br />
unpopular a remark, in scholarship, and, if you like, in pure<br />
scholarship at that.<br />
Because here is one of the great humanising things,<br />
the great civilising things in the mind of can. To set a<br />
university up, and say, " Well residential colleges arc a luxury,<br />
they are to get nothing; the rest of it is to get something<br />
teaching universities, they are nothing to do with the<br />
university; they are something that hospitals attend to,<br />
therefore they are out of the picture", is a false division.<br />
I know that whenever I talk like this, and set up a<br />
Cozmittee, or a Commission, I have to conceal myself for some<br />
time thereafter from the stony glances of my colleagues and<br />
friends in the Treasury. Mr. Shehan is nt the only man who<br />
prays every morning to have strongth to deal with the<br />
Treasury. ( Laughter)<br />
But Treasuries are not so uncivilisod as people<br />
suppos. I think when we began as a Commonwealth Goverrnment to<br />
deal with the university problem as such, and to rake Grants<br />
back in 1950, the Grants were of modest proportion. I haven't<br />
the figures by me, but they would probably fall short of a<br />
million pounds in the year. But it was a beginning.<br />
It was a beginning in a field in which the Commonwealth<br />
itself did not have a direct or primary responsibility. It was<br />
a beginning in what is, broadly, a State field.<br />
But in the State field the burden of education, year<br />
by year, has grown. I think myself that there has been an<br />
enormously enterprising approach to it on the part of State<br />
Governments. In the State of New South Wales the growth in<br />
expenditure on education affairs has, I think been remarkable.<br />
And the sane goes for other States that I could refer to.<br />
But the Universities teaching at that level, living<br />
education at that level, were in a financial condition in which<br />
the choice would very soon have been between positively<br />
bankrupting State Budgets, or bankrupting universities or<br />
forcing them into charging such fees that the universities,<br />
instead of being, as they are now, the most democratic of all </p>
<p>comr. unities, right have become what an old political opponent of<br />
mine once described as the ' bare gardens of the idle rich'.<br />
Therefore we had to go on the Murray Cor. mission,<br />
the present Cormmission.<br />
Just so that you will see that Governments are not<br />
unaware of this problem let me tell you that in the three years<br />
covered by the Murray Committee's Report, which positively<br />
rocked us, financially, with its magnitude, the Comonwealth<br />
Government provided something of the order of œ 20 to œ 21<br />
million. And, under the first Report of the new Universities<br />
Commission, which contains increased provisions for<br />
universities increased provisions -for residential colleges, and<br />
so on, the œ 20O to œ 21 million rises to œ 39 to 40 million. Now<br />
these, for anybody except Sir Herbert Schlink, are big sums of<br />
money. ( Laughter) That is not the end of it. But there is one word of<br />
warning I would like to utter on this matter. It isn't really<br />
everybody who can benefit by university training. I know there<br />
is a great theory that everybody can and will.<br />
But when I open the newspapers, and when you open the<br />
newspapers, and see the appalling failure rates in first year,<br />
you begin to say to yourself, " Shouldn't the whole of this<br />
conception be revised a little? Are we necessarily right in<br />
continuing to have universities developed in the future on the<br />
classical 19th century model?" Or, should we try to get more<br />
variation into this some people going to a university in the<br />
sense that we understand it, because they have the talent to<br />
produce brilliant results; and others, perhaps to other types<br />
of technological institutes, or whatever it may be?<br />
This is a broad problem, and the Universities<br />
Commission is going into it right away. And for the very good<br />
reason that so great, and of course so healthy, is the demand<br />
for university training today, that the undergraduate population<br />
will become fantastic before we are 20 years older.<br />
I think I an right in saying that at the end of<br />
years, 25 years, certainly no more, there would be a demand,<br />
provided the thing went as it does now, for 100,000 undergraduates<br />
in Australian universities.<br />
That would mean an expansion which would be equivalent<br />
to establishing, in every period of about five years, a couple<br />
of new universities in Australia.<br />
These are troemendous tasks, and we must all look at<br />
them with a good deal of caution, with a good deal of sympathy,<br />
with a good deal of interest. They are going to provide<br />
problems for my successors, and for your successors. No doubt<br />
they will grapple with them. But they will grapple with then<br />
all the better if the public continually understands that there<br />
is a price to be paid for admiralty, even in the area of the<br />
mind. Now the only other matter that I want to say a word<br />
about is this. I an the least of all God's creatures when it<br />
comes to knowing about hospitals rmy wife is by way of being a<br />
species of expert becauso she had a great deal to do with them<br />
in the city of Melbourne. But I was always impressed, from the<br />
very beginning, with the astonishing work done by auxilliaries,<br />
not merely because of the intrinsic product, but because of the<br />
ihuane spirit that they helped to contribute to the hospital<br />
itsel </p>
<p>a I have been disturbed as many of you have by the<br />
tendency, particularly in recent years, to say, " Well we pay<br />
high taxes let the Government attend to it. It is the<br />
Government's business to run it to pay for it". " I pay my<br />
taxes", says somebody as if that wore an act of virtue instead<br />
of being one of compulsion. ( Laughter) " I pay my taxes, let<br />
the Government look after it".<br />
There was never a truer observation made than the<br />
observation addressed to men, this was, it doesn't need to be<br />
addressed to women that every nan in the course of his life<br />
ought to perform some unpaid duty to his follow men; preferably<br />
he ought to do it at a loss. This is the essence of the spirit<br />
of service. You think of all the nen who have served the conmunity<br />
handsomely, in Church or State, you won't think of too nany who<br />
have done it because there was a profit in it.<br />
This spirit of sacrifice, of contribution is vital to<br />
a healty commnnunity. And I hope that we won't get to a stage<br />
when auxilliaries are a thing of history when voluntary donations<br />
will dry up because " I pay my taxes and there's nothing more to<br />
be done". Because if that were to happen and this applies<br />
also to this phenomenal record of honorary services in the<br />
hospital itself if that were to happen, if we all said<br />
S" Leave it to the Government, I've paid my taxes, I'n going to<br />
the races, or I'm going to do something else", then I believe<br />
that though medicine might be efficient, and hospitals might be<br />
clean, and the food night be admirable, and the nursing skilful,<br />
something would have gone out of the place.<br />
Don't forget this: we've got a lot of Governnent<br />
Departments sone people think too many, though, as a rule,<br />
they come along to ask for nore when some problem arises but<br />
there is no Government Department in Cornmonwealth or State that<br />
provides for the people the milk of human kindness. That is a<br />
D personal perquisite, that is a personal responsibility, that is,<br />
in its ultimate expression, the great proof of the Divine in<br />
man. I hope it never disappears.<br />
I was delighted to hear what Sir Charles Bickerton<br />
Blackburn had to say about honorary staff. As he said it, I<br />
thought " How cynical people become ' Oh, he's an honorary at<br />
the hospitali I wonder what the game is. I , render what<br />
advantage he's aftur. I wonder whether he is making himself<br />
good with so and so, and so and I get so tired of this.<br />
Cynicism can destroy a nation more quickly than any<br />
other thing. But a spirit, a social spirit, a community<br />
spirit will make that nation healthy, whatever may cone or go.<br />
So, Sir, I an delighted to be here and to have the<br />
opportunity of joining with you on a very remarkable occasion.<br />
( Applause) </p>
