CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER TO<br />
WOMEN'S ADVISERS CANBERRA 10 MAY 1984<br />
I am happy to welcome here tonight Australia's principal<br />
advisers on the Status of Women. I particularly want to<br />
welcome those of you who have travelled from Perth,<br />
Brisbane, Hobart, Darwin, Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne to<br />
attend this two day meeting with members of the Office of<br />
the Status of Women within my Department.<br />
This is the first time since these meetings began to be held<br />
that the Governments of Queensland and Tasmania have sent<br />
representatives and I particularly welcome this recognition<br />
by those two Governments of the importance of seeking out<br />
and heeding the views of women.<br />
I also want to welcome here tonight the members of the<br />
Permanent Heads Task Force on the Status of Women, the<br />
Secretaries of the nine departments and the Public Service<br />
Board whose policies are most directly relevant to improving<br />
the status of women. Sir Geoffrey Yeend, the Secretary of<br />
my Department, leaders to this important and innovative Task<br />
Force. Through it the Government aims to secure the highest<br />
possible level of administrative support for implementing<br />
our policies on women.<br />
That we have already made tremendous progress in meeting<br />
this goal is evident from the report which has been made<br />
available to the advisers attending today's meeting. This<br />
document was prepared by the Office of the Status of Women<br />
at the direction of Senator Ryan who assists me in matters<br />
to d'o with the status of women. It sets out in great detail<br />
the progress the Federal Government has made towards<br />
fulfilling its platform and policy speech promises on the<br />
status of women. This document will be circulated as widely<br />
as possible in order to demonstrate that the Government has<br />
taken seriously its obligations to women. </p>
<p>2.<br />
1 am very pleased to see here tonight thE! Opposition members<br />
who have given the greatest support to constructive measures<br />
towards improving the status of women. They, I know, believe<br />
there should be a large degree of bipartisanship on such<br />
important matters as removing discrimination from the<br />
workplace, and encouraging women and girls to improve their<br />
levels of skills, and hence their ability to raise their<br />
labour market prospects.<br />
The Government has already set in train a number of policy<br />
initiatives or reviews designed to assist us to achieve<br />
these goals. We have enacted the Sex Discrimination Act and<br />
will be in a position to proclaim it within a month or so,<br />
after we have appointed a Sex Discrimination Commissioner.<br />
We have asked the Kirby Review of Labour Market! Training<br />
Schemes to report to us specifically on how we can improve<br />
labour market training prospects for Women. We have been<br />
pursuing the objective of equal participation by women in<br />
the Community Employment Program and we have set out to<br />
ensure that girls have equal access with boys to our<br />
participation and equity program and our computer awareness<br />
program two important measures within our education<br />
policies designed to improve retention rates and levels of<br />
marketable skills.<br />
I am also pleased to be able to state that our policy and<br />
guidelines for the appointment of women to senior<br />
administrative posts and to Government boards and<br />
authorities has become a settled part of Government<br />
appointments procedures. Since we achieved office we have<br />
appointed more than 70 women to Government boards and<br />
authorities, including as we announced last week, the<br />
important appointment of Professor Di Verbury as General<br />
Manager of the Australia Council. Professor Verbury's<br />
appointment makes her the highest ranking female<br />
Commonwealth Government officer.<br />
Since we gained office we have made every effort to promote<br />
women of merit within the public service. Tonight I am<br />
pleased to be able to welcome Helen Williams, Ann Kern and<br />
Jocelyn McGirr, the first women ever to be appointed as<br />
Deputy Secretaries in Federal Departments. I am also very<br />
glad' to welcome Hazel Moir and Sue Hamilton, both of whom<br />
began work today as Assistant Secretaries in the Office of<br />
the Status of Women. They join the increasing numbers of<br />
women who have moved into the ranks of the Second Division<br />
of the Public Service.<br />
This week the Federal Government has introduced the first of<br />
its several pieces of legislation to begin reforming the<br />
Australian Public Service. Included in these reforms are<br />
the introduction on Equal. Employment Opportunity Programs in<br />
each Department and Authority. There wil. l now also be a<br />
requirement that Departments make every effort to promote<br />
women of talent to important positions within their ranks. </p>
<p>I plan to table the Government's Policy Discussion Paper on<br />
affirmative action in Parliament on 29 May. I know you are<br />
all looking forward to it and contributing to the<br />
Australia-wide discussion of its proposals which will ensue.<br />
You will recall that, when we introduced our Sex<br />
Discrimination Legislation, many of the State Women's<br />
offices were deluged with public inquiriE's about that<br />
Federal Government initiative.<br />
With this experience in mind, we are going to set up an<br />
affirmative action hotline staffed by members of the Women's<br />
Telephone Information Service in each State capital city.<br />
We hope that most enquiries will be effectively dealt with<br />
in this way.<br />
I would nevertheless appreciate whatever contribution you<br />
can make to community understanding of the assumptions and<br />
expectations involved in this important policy area.<br />
I take the view, and it is shared by my Ministers, that we<br />
ultimately will be able to have more progressive government<br />
and a better society if long lasting social reform is<br />
implemented on the basis of genuine consultation and<br />
co-operation in the development of policy. This is what we<br />
are seeking to do in our approach to affirmative action.<br />
As we approach both the Premiers' Conference next month and<br />
the Federal Budget in August the Government is very<br />
conscious that our prime task is to pay heed to the task of<br />
governing the country well for all Australians, male<br />
Australians and female Australians ( of whatever racial or<br />
ethnic origin).<br />
We recognise nevertheless that there are certain issues<br />
which may be raised at this meeting which are relevant both<br />
for the determination of the allocation of funds to the<br />
States in this year's Premiers' Conference and in the<br />
forthcoming Budget.<br />
I will give careful consideration to whatever emerges from<br />
this meeting for items on the Premiers' Conference agenda.<br />
I can also assure you, as I have done before, that when the<br />
Government comes to framing this year's Budget it will do so<br />
with full cognizance of the impact the decisions it makes<br />
could have on women. We shall ensure that within the<br />
overall economic objectives of the Government the important<br />
decisions we make this year on the budget. are made with full<br />
knowledge of their impact on Australian women.<br />
A </p>
<p>I look forward to hearing a full report on the outcome of<br />
your two-day meeting and trust the rest of your<br />
deliberations will be useful and will continue the<br />
co-operative approach to this important policy area which I<br />
know has always characterised your meetings. </p>
