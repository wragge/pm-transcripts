PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, WARREN SNOWDON'S OFFICE, ALICE<br />
SPRINGS, 30 MARCH 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, were you able to give the<br />
Aboriginal people a timetable for the introduction of the<br />
ATSIC Bill or for the completion of the ATSIC Bill?<br />
PM: I spoke to them about that, but that's something that's<br />
got to go to the Cabinet on Monday and iL's not appropriate,<br />
ye told them in conference the broad outlines of what I<br />
think wil. be happening. But it's qot to go to the Cabinet<br />
and you'll become aware of it in due course.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do they want any major changes?<br />
PM: No I didn't talk about major changes at all.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you hopeful of legislation this session,<br />
this year?<br />
PM: I1 hope so.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are they prepared to offer support for Minister<br />
Hand? PM: There was no question, other than of support for Mr<br />
Hand. Why should there be?<br />
JOURNALIST: What about their concerns of a new legislation<br />
in the Northern Territory affecting sacred sites?<br />
PM: Yes, we talked about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Were you able to give<br />
PM: Well the situation there is that Minister Hand took up<br />
with the Northern Territory Government the concerns that have<br />
been expressed to him by the Aboriginal people. In the light<br />
of Minister Hand's discussions with the Northern<br />
Territory Government they have undertaken to introduce<br />
amendments. So they, I understand, will come in at the end<br />
of April or the beginning of May and so we Just have to wait<br />
and see whether those amendmdents meet the legitimate<br />
concerns. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Was there any discussion of the treaty that you<br />
talked about last time you were here?<br />
PM: No there wasn't.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what's your reaction to Mr<br />
Namaliu's decision to defer his visit to Australia?<br />
PM: Well that's perfectly a matter appropriate for him to<br />
be taking into account. He's got problems in Bougainville<br />
and he and the Cabinet discussed those and the Cabinet<br />
decided it was not appropriate for him, with the troubles<br />
they've got there in Bougainville, for him to be out of the<br />
country. It's a perfectly understandable decision. It's a<br />
postponement, not a cancellation.<br />
JOURNALIST: Was there any discussion on stock routes and<br />
stock reserves?<br />
PM: And excisions? Yes, we talked about that. Yes we did.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will the Federal Government be doing anything<br />
about that?<br />
PM: Yes, I'm going to be discussing this matter with Mr<br />
Hand. I want to find out from him exactly where he's reached<br />
on it. I think there will be a submission coming to the<br />
Cabinet shortly but I've undertaken with my friends here to<br />
raise that matter with him and see just when it will be<br />
coming to Cabinet.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you got anything to say about the visit of<br />
Vice President Quayle for the Coral Sea celebrations?<br />
PM: No, other than to say that it's a very significant<br />
decision. He's the Vice President of the United States, a<br />
half head away from the Presidency as it's often put, and he<br />
will be a welcome visitor to Australia.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what's your reaction to Fred Chaney's<br />
preselection<br />
PM: Oh yes, he made it at last did he? Well, I am not<br />
concerned about it, perhaps John Howard is, he ought to be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, are you concerned about<br />
PM: He's not going down to the Lower House for the good of<br />
his health or the good of John Howard's health.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think he'd make a good Opposition leader?<br />
PM: Room for improvement isn't there? </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke are you concerned about the security of<br />
Commonwealth drivers? There've been some revelations this<br />
morning? PM: Well, I just saw the reference to that. I don't think<br />
that that reference to one driver should induce me to a state<br />
of panic about the condition or state of Commonwealth drivers<br />
generally. JOURNALIST: Should they be checked, their bona fides be<br />
checked?<br />
PM: I think all our bona fides should be checked even the<br />
media, don't you?<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, were the Aboriginal people happy about<br />
the amount of consultation there's been on the ASTIC Bill?<br />
PM: Yes, I mean they raised no concerns with me about that.<br />
Their concern is that the legislation get through. They seem<br />
totally committed to it.<br />
JOURNALIST: And you think that'll happen before the next<br />
election? PM: I trust so, yes, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, has there been any progress on the<br />
treaty, was there any discussions?<br />
PM: No, there was not any discussion here. My friends<br />
didn't raise it with me here, but I've just recently, this<br />
week had discussions with Minister Hand about it and he will<br />
be coming to me within the very near future, within the next<br />
week I think, with further details about the processes that<br />
he has underway for furthering the consultations in the<br />
Aboriginal community and also in the non-Aboriginal community<br />
because it's quite clear that we need to not only have the<br />
Aboriginal people themselves discussing the sorts of things<br />
that they want to see in such a treaty but we have to have<br />
these things discussed in the general community and he has<br />
developed ideas about that to further these processes. He'll<br />
be coming back to me, as I say, very shortly on that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you support the idea of using someone like<br />
former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser to be<br />
involved in those sort of discussions?<br />
PM: I think those concepts make a lot of sense. I mean I<br />
think the idea of getting a group of Eminent Persons whose<br />
stature, commitment is beyond question. That sort of concept<br />
makes sense and I think it is maybe that sort of thing that<br />
the Minister will be developing with me.<br />
