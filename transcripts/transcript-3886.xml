PRESS STATEMENT NO. 558<br />
16 September 1975<br />
AUSTRALIAN INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR MINERAL EXPLORATION<br />
EXPENDITURE IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, announced today<br />
that transitional provisions in the Income Tax Assessment<br />
Act 1975 relating to the allowance of deduction, for<br />
Australian income tax purposes, of mineral exploration<br />
expenditure incurred by Australian companies in Papua New<br />
Guinea would be extended.<br />
Amendments to the Australian income tax law<br />
effected by the Income Tax Assessment Act 1975 provide that,<br />
subject to transitional provisions, deductions will not be<br />
allowed in Australia for mineral exploration expenditure<br />
incurred by Australian companies in Papua New Guinea after<br />
Papua New Guinea attains independence. When the amending<br />
legislation was being considered by the Australian<br />
P arliament the Australian Government indicated that it<br />
0 would be giving sympathetic consideration to a request<br />
for extension of these transitional provisions that the Papua<br />
New Guinea Government has foreshadowed it would make.<br />
Extended transitional provisions now agreed<br />
would apply to Australian companies which, at 16 September<br />
1975, held prospecting authorities issued by the Papua<br />
New Guinea Government. The extended provisions would also<br />
apply to Australian companies which at that date had entered<br />
into farm-in arrangements with holiders of such authorities<br />
or had made arrangements with the Papua New Guinea Government<br />
giving them rights in respect of such authorities.<br />
These companies will be allowed deductions in<br />
Australia for mineral exploration expenditure incurred by<br />
them up to 30 June 1978 in the areas covered by those authorities,<br />
on the same basis as applied to such expenditure incurred in<br />
Australia. Legislation to give effect to this extension<br />
would be introduced in the Australian Parliament as soon<br />
as practicable. There will be no cost to the Australian<br />
Government revenue in 1975-76 because of this extension.<br />
