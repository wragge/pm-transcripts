    <content><![CDATA[<p>For nine months, this Government has purposefully, methodically and effectively put in place our plan to build a strong and prosperous economy.</p>
<p>This coming week marks the start of some important new policy initiatives.</p>
<p>From the 1st of July, the new Work for the Dole programme starts in 18 areas across our country. This programme will cover the whole country by the 1st of July next year. Unemployed people supported by the taxpayer should give something back to the community, while at the same time boosting their skills and self-confidence. Thatâs why Work for the Dole is so important.</p>
<p>Then thereâs the new Restart employment incentive to encourage businesses to employ older people because ability, not age, should be the test for employment.</p>
<p>Thereâs a new Job Commitment Bonus payment to encourage long-term unemployed young Australians to find a job and to keep it.</p>
<p>There will also be financial assistance for long-term unemployed people to move to take up a job.</p>
<p>And from this week, thereâll be new concessional Trade Support Loans available to apprentices learning a trade. This will help apprentices to complete their studies.</p>
<p>All of the Governmentâs policies are focused on getting more Australians into work â because the best form of welfare is a job.</p>
<p>You can find out more about our employment incentives and support at <a href="http://www.employment.gov.au/">www.employment.gov.au</a></p>
<p>This week also marks the start of the new Senate.</p>
<p>The new Senate can help us to strengthen the economyÂ by urgently passing the Coalitionâs legislation to scrap the carbon tax.</p>
<p>Scrapping the carbon tax will see the average family about $550 a year better off â and it will make all our businesses more competitive.</p>
<p>I do look forward to working with the new Senate â because by working together we can help create more jobs and build a stronger economy for every Australian.</p>
