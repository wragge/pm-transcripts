    <content><![CDATA[<p>As both a friend of Israel and a supporter of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people, I was appalled to learn this morning of the terrorist outrage overnight against innocent civilians in Tel Aviv. My heartfelt sympathies - together with those of my government and Australians everywhere - go out to the families and loved ones of those killed and injured in such horrific circumstances.</p>
<p>This blatant act of terrorism is all the more deplorable since it occurs during a unilateral Israeli ceasefire, declared in response to the Mitchell report's call for an immediate cessation of violence and a resumption of peace talks.</p>
<p>Both sides need to act decisively and with courage to prevent a further decline into senseless violence. Australia joins other members of the international community in calling on all those concerned to recognise the devastating implications for both sides of a deepening cycle of provocation and retribution. The only solution is one arrived at through dialogue between the parties, in which terrorist violence plays no part.</p>
