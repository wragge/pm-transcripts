TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
AND HIS EXCELLENCY, MR VACLAV HAVEL, PRESIDENT OF THE<br />
CZECH REPUBLIC, JOINT DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE,<br />
CANBERRA, 28 MARCH 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Can I begin by saying how pleased I am to see His Excellency, the<br />
President, here in Australia. He does us a singular honour in coming.<br />
He's the first Head of State of the Republic to visit this country and,<br />
that is, way back through this century, and he, as I said, does us a<br />
singular honour. We've had the opportunity to speak today but I could<br />
not let this opportunity pass without paying tribute to the great moral<br />
courage that he has displayed in years past in his indignation at the<br />
denial of rights and liberties and his courage in fighting for them and<br />
speaking out, and now his role in trying to pilot with others the Czech<br />
Republic's future in the modern world. We salute you for your role in<br />
the past, and now, and we wish you well. Can I say also that I was<br />
very chuffed that the President stopped into Darwin and visited<br />
Kakadu and took an interest in Australia's oldest archaeology the<br />
rock carvings and paintings of our indigenes. In saluting them, you<br />
salute us. That was very kind of you, and in that way, you have seen<br />
more of Australia than perhaps any other Head of State. We did have<br />
the opportunity to discuss economic and social policy matters, both<br />
within our countries and between our countries, and within Europe and<br />
between Europe and the Asia-Pacific, and I think it was a, for my part,<br />
a very useful exchange of views and I hope that the President enjoyed<br />
it also. I might now invite him to make some introductory comments.<br />
VH: First of all, I thanked Prime Minister Keating for this opportunity for me<br />
to visit Australia and I expressed my gratitude for the warm welcome<br />
given to me and for the excellent organisation of my visit. During our<br />
talks I informed the Prime Minister of the situation in the Czech<br />
Republic. I mentioned our economic reform as well as the<br />
opportunities that we see for intensifying our co-operation with<br />
Australia. We also discussed the situation in the present day world<br />
and in that respect, we fully agree that in a world covered by one<br />
global civilisation, no isolation is imaginable any more. And just as the </p>
<p>APEC nations are interested in the developments in Europe, we for our<br />
part, take an interest in what is happening in this region. The Prime<br />
Minister has raised the subject of the European situation and we have<br />
discussed the European integration processes and the role that<br />
individual countries are playing in that, and he has expressed his hope<br />
and his support for the Czech Republic and other central European<br />
nations to be admitted soon into the family of European democracies.<br />
Let me also stress how profoundly I appreciate the multicultural<br />
dimension marking the Australian policy at present. As Prime Minister<br />
Keating explained to me, this dimension grows out of what I perceived<br />
as the most important thing it grows out of respect for the human<br />
individual, for the individual human being and his human rights.<br />
PM: Well, I think we might open briefly the questions because as you may<br />
know, the President and I have a luncheon appointment with other<br />
people which is really about now, so, maybe we should have just a<br />
short question period.<br />
J: have you discussed also confirmation of Australia into a republic<br />
and possible role of President Havel..<br />
PM: No, I didn't, but I take the opportunity in your question to note that in<br />
His Excellency, he more than adequately represents his country as<br />
Head of State, and it's my great wish that an Australian person should<br />
also too represent their country as Head of State, and not the monarch<br />
of another country.<br />
J: I noticed in a very short time you moved from being a intellectual for<br />
head of your country who has dedicated himself to giving the<br />
Government back to the people, how difficult has that task proved?<br />
VH: It's true that unlike most of the best of politicians, I came to politics<br />
virtually overnight. I was just thrown into the river and had to start<br />
swimming. It was a tremendous, interesting experience.<br />
PM: Maybe it's the best way.<br />
J: ( inaudible) eastern Europe.... Czech Republic?<br />
PM: The economic links? Well, I think, I mean, your country has always<br />
had a deep democratic tradition a latent, deep democratic tradition<br />
that the best foundation stones for any bilateral relationship for this<br />
country. Secondly, in the past you have been a fully developed<br />
country. You are heading back to that status now. We've got a<br />
number of our major companies investing in the Czech Republic. I<br />
would like to see more but I think the Czech Republic's full<br />
membership, if you like, of the European Community will give it its best<br />
opportunity to not only trade with Australia and with Asia, but also with<br />
Europe. So, we regard it as a very obvious country for us to do </p>
<p>business with in eastern Europe and I think the investments we have<br />
on the ground now demonstrate that point.<br />
J: ( inaudible)...<br />
PM: Well, I think that he regards he made the point himself about the<br />
dignity of every human person, about the rights of people. He's<br />
indicated his interest in our older society our indigenes. These are<br />
all common threads, I think, between the policies that this Government<br />
pursues and I know that in this country, some commentators would like<br />
the Government to keep its nose to the, sort of, mortgage grindstone,<br />
forgetting all of these great things that President Havel has himself<br />
stood for when it comes to the interests of people and the important<br />
interests of culture and identity. I think that might probably be the end<br />
of it, thank you. We would like to make this press conference longer<br />
than perhaps we are able to make it, but could I take this opportunity<br />
to thank the President most sincerely for participating and thank you,<br />
and no doubt he will see you tomorrow at the Press Club. Thank you. </p>
