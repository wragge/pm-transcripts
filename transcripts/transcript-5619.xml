P AUMS TRALIAIS<br />
PRIME_ MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA. THURSDAY, 16 JULY 1981<br />
BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION LEGISLATION<br />
The Minister for Communications and myself have made it plain<br />
that there were extensive discussions in the preparatory stages<br />
of the Broadcasting and Television legislation, and so there<br />
should have been. It is Government practice to consult on<br />
legislation where appropriate. As I said in the Parliament<br />
on 5 June, you have to have discussions of highly technical<br />
matters with the proposals in front of you.<br />
Those discussions have resulted in legislation which the<br />
Parliament has passed with a high degree of support. It is<br />
better-legislation than was there before. It is fair legislation.<br />
I did have discussions, including discussions over drafts,<br />
with Mr Searby, whom I have known for many years. He has<br />
advised-me that-he-did-nat-pass -on the -substance Of those<br />
discussions to people in the News Limited organisation.<br />
I also had discussions with Sir Keith McPherson and representatives<br />
of the Herald and Weekly Times. I did not have discussions with<br />
Mr Packer's Consolidated Press organisation. That is the<br />
substance of-my involvement in discussions in relation to this<br />
matter. 000---</p>
