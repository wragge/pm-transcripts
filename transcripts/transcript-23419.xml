    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am delighted to announce Her Majesty The Queen has agreed to my recommendation to extend the eligibility for the <em>National Police Service Medal </em>to recognise service on or after 14 February 1975, the date on which the Australian Honours system was established.</p>
<p>This will extend eligibility for the <em>National Police Service Medal</em> to an estimated 20,000 former police officers.</p>
<p>The <em>National Police Service Medal</em> recognises the special status that sworn police officers have because of their role protecting the community.</p>
<p>The <em>National Police Service Medal</em> was established in 2010 to recognise 15 yearsâ ethical and diligent service by Australian sworn police officers in active service on or after 30 October 2008.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, police officers whose services concluded between 14 February 1975 and 30 October 2008 were ineligible for this distinguished medal.</p>
<p>The Australian Government believes that these dedicated police officers who have served our local communities should have their service recognised.</p>
