    <content><![CDATA[<p>The second report card on the Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan has been released today, highlighting a surge in jobs growth on the back of the Australian and New South Wales governments’ $3.6 billion infrastructure investment in the region.</p>
<p>Significant progress on road projects has seen local businesses already capitalising on the upgrades designed to transform growing population centres and service the proposed Western Sydney Airport at Badgerys Creek.</p>
<p>The report card shows that in the past 12 months work on three major road projects has begun, including the 35-kilometre $1.6 billion upgrade of The Northern Road, which is currently generating more than $30 million worth of contracts for Western Sydney suppliers and contractors.</p>
<p>The governments’ investment is revitalising roads in one of Australia’s fastest-growing regions ahead of the opening of the proposed Western Sydney Airport in the mid-2020s — a critical project delivering the jobs and growth the region needs while ensuring long-term aviation needs are met.</p>
<p>The report card dovetails with recent progress in planning for the airport project, including finalisation of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on 15 September. Work is underway to prepare the airport site and a joint discussion paper on Western Sydney's rail needs has been issued seeking public feedback.</p>
<p>The joint investment is stimulating work for local industry, as highlighted by a 240 per cent increase in the number of local businesses working on these projects compared with last financial year.</p>
<p>With more than 150 local contractors and suppliers now benefiting from the delivery of key road projects, including Bringelly Road, Werrington Arterial Road and The Northern Road already in construction, this shows the immediate boost for local businesses.</p>
<p>In addition, the number of full-time workers directly employed on these projects has increased by about a third, to more than 430 jobs.</p>
<p>This number will continue to grow, further contributing to around 4,000 direct and indirect jobs during the 10-year programme, which is on track to open ahead of the new airport in the mid-2020s—itself a catalyst for tens of thousands of quality jobs for the region.</p>
<p>With the peak annual expenditure forecast in the 2018-19 financial year, even more opportunities lie ahead as more of the major stages of work move towards the delivery stage.</p>
<p>Both governments are committed to making sure quality infrastructure is in place ahead of time to cater for the additional one million people expected to live in Western Sydney by 2031.</p>
