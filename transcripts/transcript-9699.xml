SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
AUSTRALIA REMEMBERS GALA TRIBUTE, PALAIS THEATRE, ST KILDA,<br />
13 AUGUST 1995<br />
Tonight, and throughout this year of Australia Remembers, we have celebrated<br />
the spirit of a generation of Australians.<br />
It has been a bit like a giant birthday party for our parents and grandparents a<br />
kind of national golden wedding in which we celebrate the bonds between us<br />
all. And it has been at least as good for those giving the party as for the guests of<br />
honour. It has been a chance for all of us to reflect on the gifts this generation gave us.<br />
And to remember the price they paid in doing it.<br />
What great parents and grandparents they have been.<br />
They gave us the greatest gifts anyone can have. They gave us peace and<br />
freedom. They gave us this country and a way of life we can call our own.<br />
To do it, they gave up their own freedom. They gave up their lives. They gave<br />
all their labour. And all their love.<br />
They gave us an example to live by.<br />
If we want to know what courage or duty or mateship mean, we can turn to<br />
them. If we want to know what it means to be Australian, we can turn to them.<br />
If we want to know what we can achieve as Australians, we can turn to them.<br />
Many things have changed including the music but the essential things<br />
remain. The fundamental things apply. </p>
<p>2<br />
Even half of their courage, half of their love of Australia, half of their spirit will<br />
take us a very long way in life.<br />
This concert has been a celebration of their spirit.<br />
Tonight we will all take some of it away with us.<br />
I thank everyone who made this event possible: and I know I speak for all<br />
Australians when I say, above all, thank you to those who, at home and<br />
abroad, fought the war and saved Australia. </p>
