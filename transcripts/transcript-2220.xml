REVIEW OF FINAN4CIAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS<br />
ARRANGEMENTS<br />
MR. GORTON I shall read a statement which has<br />
been prepared for me and which I believe is to be circulated.<br />
The main purpose of this meeting is to further discuss the new<br />
general revenue grants arrangements between the Commonwealth<br />
and the States to apply from the beginning of 1970-71. These<br />
arrangements embrace both the method of determining the annual<br />
general revenue assistance to each State, and the forms of<br />
such assistance, and they are therefore of very great<br />
importance in determining the future pattern of Commonwealth-<br />
State financial relationships.<br />
Dealing with the particular question of general<br />
revenue grants, at our meeting in February I expressed a<br />
willingness on behalf of the Commonwealth Government to discuss<br />
matters relating to the financial assistance grants and to look,<br />
as you had suggested, at the base total and to look, as you also<br />
suggested, at such aspects as the betterment factor. I also<br />
expressed a willingness to discuss and seek to ameliorate one<br />
of the problems of the States which has been frequently put<br />
forward; that is, the difficulty which you have seen arising<br />
as a result of some of the loan money which the States secure<br />
being provided, in fact, from revenue gathered by the Commonwealth<br />
rather than by money borrowed from lenders in the normal way.<br />
In the intervening months we have had discussions between our<br />
Treasury officials, that is of the Commonwealth and the various<br />
States, and I think these discussions have been helpful to both<br />
of us. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Today it is my purpose and my responsibility on behalf of the<br />
Commonwealth Government to put before you proposals for the ensuing five<br />
years commencing on 1st July next. In offering assistance specifically<br />
directed at helping the States to meet interest and sinking fund charges on<br />
the State debt we have had in mind the concern which Premiers have<br />
expressed at the annual growth of State debt and particularly at the rate this<br />
debt has been growing in relation to the rate of growth of Commonwealth<br />
debt. We have also taken into account our undertaking to bear in mind,<br />
during our present review, the question of offsetting any additional financial<br />
burden on the States which might arise from the Commonwealth's<br />
decision in 1968 to remove the income tax rebate on Commonwealth loan<br />
interest. In the Commonwealth's consideration of these proposals, we<br />
have aimed at providing an average annual rate of increase in total<br />
Commonwealth revenue assistance to the States substantially above the<br />
increases that would have been produced if the present grants arrangements<br />
continued unaltered. For example, if on the basis of past trends in<br />
increases in average wages and population the present grants formula<br />
would have resulted in the grants growing at an average of 9. 9% each year<br />
over the next five years, we have calculated that the overall effect of the<br />
Commonwealth's new proposals would be to increase that average rate of<br />
growth to at least 12. 5% per year. </p>
<p>I turn now to outline in broad terms what we have in mind<br />
for each of the four sections of the Commonwealth proposals. Later I<br />
shall circulate proposals setting out their es6ential features. On the<br />
question of taking over State debt and of interest-free capital grants, we<br />
propose that the capital grant begin at $ 200m in 1970-71 this is the sum<br />
of money which we propose to make available as a grant rather than, as<br />
has happened in the past, as a loan and that it should thereafter increase<br />
at the same rate as the total works and housing programmes. The States'<br />
formal Loan Council borrowing programmes will be lower each year by<br />
an amount equal to the capital grant, of course, and the payment of the<br />
grant by the Commonwealth will be conditional on agreement being reached<br />
on the size of the total borrowing programme. As the primary purpose of<br />
the grant will be to relieve the burden of debt charges on non-revenue<br />
producing capital expenditure, it will be designed to help finance expenditure<br />
on capital works and services from which debt charges are not recouped,<br />
such as schools, police buildings and the like. However, while we would<br />
appreciate from you an informal assurance that the funds will be used in<br />
this way that is, for non-recoupable purposes there will be no specific<br />
or legal conditions attached to the expenditure of the grant. </p>
<p>As the grant will not form part of the States'<br />
borrowing programmes, its distribution between the States<br />
will not be a matter for legal determination by the Loan<br />
Council. While it will therefore probably devolve on the<br />
Commonwealth to accept final responsibility for determining<br />
the distribution of the total grant each year between the<br />
States, we are hoping that it will be possible to agree to<br />
the distribution with you beforehand and in a co-operative<br />
way. It is not possible to estimate precisely the<br />
deb. t charges savings to the States that will result from this<br />
proposal in the year each grant is made, although in future<br />
years the saving will obviously be a full year's interest<br />
and sinking fund. The savings in the first year will<br />
depend on the timing of loan raisings during the year, and<br />
the overall savings will depend, among other things, on the<br />
size of the States' borrowing programmes in the future,<br />
on trends in interest rates and so on. However, on the<br />
basis of recent trends in increases in loan programmes and of<br />
present interest rate patterns, we estimate that over the<br />
years 1970-71 to 1974-75 the total debt charges savings to<br />
the States from this annual grant will be of the order of<br />
$ 148m, which is additional to some sall saving in 1970-71<br />
which we have not included in the tables which will be<br />
circulated subsequently. In other words, we are saying that<br />
there will be a saving to the States from this in the first<br />
year but it is difficult to estimate how much that saving will be. </p>
<p>It may only be as much as $ 1 million. We are therefore discounting<br />
it, not counting it in as assistance-to the States, and saying that it<br />
is in the second year of this programme that the States will receive<br />
the full benefit of this $ 200 million, because they will not be<br />
paying interest and sinking fund on $ 200 which they would<br />
otherwise be paying interest and sinking fund on, and that will<br />
be the basis of our calculations on this.<br />
On the question of the taking over of existing State debt,<br />
I understand that officers have agreed that for a number of reasons<br />
it would be impracticable for State debt to be taken over by the<br />
Commonwealth before June 1975 except in a notional sense. That<br />
doesnot matter because it is proposed that from 1970-71 to 1974-<br />
the Commonwealth will reimburse the States by way of section<br />
96 grants for the interest and sinki g fund charges on a progressively<br />
increasing amount of State debt. So that although the debts are<br />
not actually taken over, the cost of the debts to the States is taken<br />
over. Specifically, we propose that $ 200 million of State debt be<br />
taken over, in the sense just explained at the beginning of each of the ,. ext<br />
years so that by the commencement of 1974-75 the Commonwealth will<br />
be meeting the debt charges on a full $ 1,000 of State debt. The<br />
arrangements for the formal transfer of the debt from the States<br />
to the Commonwealth in June 1975 will be a matter to be settled<br />
later. </p>
<p>I understand that Commonwealth and State officials agreed an appropriate<br />
parcel of $ 1,000m of State debt that is after going through the various debts<br />
which were outstanding the officers agreed that a debt maturing at such and<br />
such a date and at such and such an interest rate, and then another debt,<br />
would make up the parcel which would be taken over. They agreed on a<br />
parcel of $ 1,000m of State debt carrying an average interest rate of 5.<br />
which is significantly higher than the average interest rate of around 5% on<br />
all existing State debt. I do not propose to go through the precise<br />
arrangements here, but the Commonwealth accepts the conclusions reached<br />
by the committee of officials appointed to examine possible procedures and,<br />
with the additional arrangements I have a! hi.. q .) utlined, we propose to<br />
proceed along the lines recommended by the officials. The arrangements<br />
are summarised in the document shall be circulating to you.<br />
The grants, which will cover the average interest charges of<br />
5% together with the annual sinking fund contributions of 25% on the debt<br />
taken over, will be $ 11. 5m in 1970-71, $ 23m in 1971-72, $ 34. 5m in 1972-73<br />
and so on, giving a total 5m available to the States over the next<br />
five years. I point out that there has been some discussion as to the<br />
method of taking ove; this $ 200m of debt. It had been suggested that<br />
perhaps in the first year we would take over half of it, say, in September<br />
and the other half in March, and only from those debts would we reimburse<br />
the States for the interest and </p>
<p>sinking fund the Commonwealth had to pay. But after discussion, we<br />
believe that when we as a Commonwealth said we would take over $ 200M of<br />
State debts each year it would be accepted by the States that we would take<br />
over that $ 200M at the beginning of the year and pay the interest and sinking<br />
fund at that date for that year, and this is what we propose to do.<br />
It is the Commonwealth's view that the distribution between the<br />
States of the debt notionally taken over ( and hence the distribution of the grants<br />
to meet the debt charges) shouldbe in proportion to total outstanding debt under<br />
the Financial Agreement as at 30 June 1970.<br />
As I have mentioned, the two proposals on debt should substantially<br />
reduce the rate of growth of debt charges over the next 5 years. The actual<br />
saving in debt charges as a result of the two debt proposals that means the<br />
actual additional resources available to the States as a result of the two debt<br />
proposals, is estimated as follows: $ 11.5 M in 1970-71, $ 37M in 1971-72,<br />
$ 63. 3M in 1972-73, $ 90. 4M in 1973-74 and $ 118. 3M in 1974-75, giving a total<br />
of $ 320. 5M over the quinquennium. This is the amount that these two<br />
proposals will add to the resources of the States, subtract from the resources<br />
of the Commonwealth and inject into the spending capacity of the economy.<br />
In addition to this substantial assistance for debt charges, we propose a decided<br />
improvement in both the amount and the rate of growth of the financial<br />
assistance grants themselves. We suggest </p>
<p>that for 1970-71 the formula grants paid to each State will be determined<br />
by applying the present formula to the formula grants paid to each State<br />
in 1969-70, that is by applying the present betterment factor to the grants<br />
received by each State in 1969-70, which I believe would add $ 100m to the<br />
amount available to the States this year, with the continuing addition in<br />
the case of Queensland of $ 2m to the 1969-70 base but, of course, not<br />
including any special assistance approved last February or other adjustments<br />
made since then. In addition, a further amount will be distributed between<br />
the States in the same proportions as their new 1970-71 formula grants,<br />
and this amount will then be included in the base for determining the formula<br />
grants for 1971-72.<br />
For purposes of determining the formula grants after 1970-71 we<br />
are proposing to improve the grants formula by improving the betterment<br />
factor from its present 1. 2% per annum to 1. 8% per annum, an increase of<br />
in the size of this element of the grants formula.<br />
Taken together we envisage these improvements, excluding the<br />
debt assistance and grants in lieu of loan which I have already mentioned, on<br />
the basis of present estimates of increases in average wages and population<br />
will mean that the total financial assistance grants excluding the ones I<br />
have mentioned should be some $ 384m higher in this forthcoming quinquennium<br />
than they would have been under the existing formula.<br />
We have given very careful consideration to the position of<br />
Queensland and have come to the conclusion that in spite of the considerable<br />
improvement that has been effected in its share of the grants over the last<br />
years, the grants being received by that State are still too low relative to the<br />
other States. </p>
<p>We therefore propose to continue the arrangements existing during<br />
the present quinquennium of adding $ 2m each year to the base on<br />
which Queensland's grant is calculated.<br />
Other States have also requested an improvement in<br />
their share of the grants, mainly based on arguments about per<br />
capita relativities. We have not been sufficiently persuaded<br />
by such comparisons and we are not prepared at the present time<br />
to suggest any special action to adjust the shares of States<br />
other than Queensland, except for what I shall now say about<br />
Western Australia. An additional grant of $ 15.5m was paid to Western<br />
Australia in 1968-69 and 1969-70 in lieu of the grant it<br />
had previously been receiving on the recommendation of the<br />
Commonwealth Grants Commission. When the State withdrew from<br />
the Commonwealth Grants Commission in 1968, it was agreed<br />
around this table that the sum of the State's 1969-70<br />
financial assistance grant and the $ 15.5m would form the<br />
base of consideration for purpcses of he present review.<br />
Since 1968-69 Western Australia has been receiving increases<br />
in its base grant and they have been escalated, but the<br />
$ 15.5m has not been incorporated in the base grant and has<br />
not been subject to escalation but has been merely paid from<br />
the Commonwealth revenue in lieu of the Commonwealth payout<br />
through the Grants Commission. </p>
<p>I am sure that it will be appreciated that there<br />
could be no prior commitment by the Commonwealth to continue<br />
to pay any particular amount to a State. We have noted that<br />
since 1967-68 there appears to have been a significant<br />
improvement in the relative capacity of Western Australia<br />
to finance its Budget expenditure at a standard at least<br />
comparable with that of other States. This means that, if<br />
the State continued to receive its present share of the<br />
revenue grants, including the special amount of $ 15.5m,<br />
the situation would become increasingly unfair to the other<br />
States and could result in a significant distortion in the<br />
allocation of governmental funds between the States.<br />
We are aware, of course, that the rapid rate of<br />
population growth and economic development in Western<br />
Australia has brought considerable problems, particularly<br />
on the capital side, and we are therefore prepared to give<br />
sympathetic consideration to that matter. The question<br />
of any special increase in shares of the Loan Council<br />
borrowing programmes is, of course, a matter for the Loan<br />
Council to decide. I make it clear, however, that the<br />
Commonwealth, subject to agreement on other matters,<br />
will support in the Loan Council a special increase of<br />
$ 3m in the State's 1970-71 borrowing programme for larger<br />
authorities. It is not possible to estimate accurately the<br />
effect that the proposals I have outlined will have on </p>
<p>the total revenue assistance provided to the States over the next 5 years.<br />
The actual amounts and rates of increase in total revenue assistance<br />
each year will depend, amongst other things, on the rate of increase in<br />
average wages and in population. However, on the assumption that these<br />
are much the same over the next 5 years as they have been over the 5 years<br />
of the present grants arrangements, total revenue assistance will be<br />
approximately $ 54m more in 1970-71 and over $ 700m more over the next<br />
years, than if the present grants arrangements had continued unaltered.<br />
These are, of course, very substantial additions indeed. Let me point<br />
out that when one says $ 54m more one means $ 54m more than the $ loo100m<br />
more that the existing formula will provide.<br />
As is well known, the distribution of the financial assistance<br />
grants is weighted in favour of the 4 less populous States in that their grants,<br />
in per capita terms, are higher than those of New South Wales and Victoria.<br />
In addition, Tasmania receives an annual special grant on the<br />
recommendation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission while Western<br />
Australia has recently been receiving an additional grant in lieu of the<br />
special grant which it previously had.<br />
The general principle underlying the distribution of the<br />
general revenue grants is that each State should be enabled to provide<br />
government service s of a standard broadly comparable with those of each<br />
other State without imposing higher taxation or other charges. However, </p>
<p>12.<br />
the principle is rather easier to state in general terms than it is to apply in<br />
practice and there are many problems both of a practical and conceptual nature<br />
which arise in attempting to determine the correct distribution of the grants.<br />
While we believe that the present distribution of the grants is a fair one, we<br />
do not believe that it is necessarily correct in precise terms. With the<br />
grants being so large an element in the State's finances, we think that it is<br />
of considerable importance that the distribution should come as close as<br />
possible to achieving the general objective I have just stated.<br />
But there are many difficulties in attempting to determine the<br />
correct distribution. These difficulties, if anything, have become more<br />
significant as a result of the very rapid changes recently occurring in the<br />
finances of some States. We encountered some of these difficulties in the<br />
course of the present arrangements when we examined the requests made to<br />
us by individual States. I strongly feel that it would be desirable to have<br />
independent investigation and advice on this question for the purposes of<br />
the next review of the arrangements. I believe that if the Premiers<br />
were disposed to accept this the best approach might be for the Commonwealth<br />
Grants Commission to be given this task.<br />
As the Piemiers know, the Commission has in the past been<br />
responsible for recommending annual grants to the three less populous States,<br />
but only Tasmania now </p>
<p>remains a claimant State. Whether it continues to do so or not will be a<br />
matter for it to decide. But in any ': ase the Commission c-: uld be given the<br />
task of recommending on the distribution of the grants between all the States,<br />
not necessarily annually but mainly for the purposes of the regular reviews<br />
of the revenue grants arrangements But the success of any scheme along<br />
these lines would obviously depend on full co-operatihn bc-. given by the<br />
States. I therefore ask the Premiers to consider that suggestion and at<br />
a later stage to let us have their opinions.<br />
We would also be prepared to consider the possibility of<br />
giv: . g the Commission the task of examining the share of the grants<br />
paid to a particular State between reviews of the grants arrangements.<br />
For example. Western Australia may wish to put a case before the<br />
Commission as to the appropriate. -ss of its proposed share ef the grants.<br />
If we were to implement these proposals there would of co.,, rse, be a<br />
number of matters to decide as to the way the Commission would work<br />
and we would obviously have to give ' lose thought to them As I say,<br />
I wuld welcome the views of the Premiers on this whole quLstion.<br />
I think that the proposals cutlined constitute a significant contribution<br />
towards an improvement in Commonwealth-State financial relationships. It<br />
will be said, no doubt, that they will not solve all th-financial problems with<br />
which the States are faced. We, for our part, well apprcci-'.-e the continuing<br />
pressure on governments to improve the standard and rang.; f services<br />
provided by governments. But we have got to have regard tc: the limitations<br />
imp. sed L; the supply of real resotr es. In recent !-ears expenditure at </p>
<p>all levels of government has been in reasing at a signifian. n ly faster rate than<br />
gross national product, a: cd ihe oYf oCtaolm monwealth reven.; e assistance proposed<br />
should ensure the States of a source revenue that will grew significantly faster<br />
than the gross national product, H. wever, progress si: n. cessarily be<br />
achieved in stages and we must havc regard to the ne'ed t" provide scope for the<br />
growth of the private sector of the economy. If we are to pr-' ide such a<br />
substantial increase in revenue assistance and in res'-urces available to the<br />
States it should be on the basis that there are no signifi: an' -hanges in the<br />
financial relationships between the Commonwealth and th. ates during the<br />
peri'd cf th-agreement. In parti-Llar. we would expect rh3. the States and<br />
their authorities will continue to pay pay roll tax and that the distribution of tax<br />
res.-'-Irces between the Commonweal.. h and the States will remain unchanged<br />
W' are aware, of course that it has been one -f " he States' main<br />
arguments that they should share in the natural growth of r venue on income tax<br />
and while I do not accept that there should be any fixed rela-ionship between<br />
inc-. me tax collections and the reve-nue grants any fixed relationship between the<br />
growth of income tax revenue and the growth of revenue grants I would mention that<br />
we -xpect the growth of revenue assistance under the prop-sals outlined to be close<br />
to, if not in excess of the rate of grcwth in the total -f incc. me tax collections from<br />
individuals and companies at the presently prescribed rates<br />
Well, gentlemen, those are the matters which I s-: e as our having to<br />
discuss: First, a taking over of $ 200m of State debt each , e: r at the beginning<br />
of th year and the paying of interest and sinking fund on it, secondly, the provision<br />
each year of $ 200m of grant which would otherwise haive been loan; thirdly, the<br />
question of what additions should made to the bas-grants for 1970-71, and what new<br />
betterment factor should be used to escalate this over the 5 Jears coming. </p>
<p>I hope that some tables on these matters have been circulated to the Premiers.<br />
It is possible that the Premiers may wish now to examine them during an<br />
adjournment. MR ASKIN Yes, that is the situation as far as I am concerned<br />
and I think the other Premiers feel as I do. As you know we submitted<br />
our case in writing last February and I still think that what we suggested then<br />
is the best way to preserve the federal system. You put up alternative<br />
proposals and they are quite involved. I would like to say quite a lot about<br />
the adequacy of some of the amounts under the different sub-headings or<br />
rather, as I see it, the lack of adequacy. However, I think that should wait<br />
until we have had a talk amongst ourselves. Most Premiers would probably<br />
want to have a talk with their advisers first and then we will get together as<br />
a team to discuss what is involved and the implications of the proposals<br />
you have just put. It may be some time before we are ready to meet again,<br />
because there is quite a lot of meat in these various proposals. At this<br />
stage I can only say that I hope we will be able to prevail upon you to do<br />
a bit better than you have already set out, but to do that I know we must come<br />
back with some cogent arguments. I am sure you will understand that I have<br />
just made a few brief remarks and that I will want to speak at length on<br />
the base grant, betterment factor and so on. I do not think that this is the<br />
appropriate moment to do that and, subject to the concurrence of my<br />
colleagues, I suggest we adjourn so that we may talk separately first and then<br />
together. </p>
<p>SIR HENRY BOLTE Should we go into Loan<br />
Council now? MR. GORTON It is up to the meeting. I thought<br />
the Premiers might like to examine these proposals first<br />
in Premiers Conference, come back and make a few more<br />
comments on them before we go into Loan Council. The<br />
Premiers will have to move out of this room to study the<br />
proposals. MR. ASKIN I think Loan Council to some extent<br />
depends on a study of the first proposals. I would like<br />
to get these cleared up one way or the other. I recognise<br />
the importance of Sir Henry's suggestion, but Loan Council<br />
will depend closely on matters decided here. I think we<br />
should try to dispose of these matters first. Would it<br />
be possible for us to have a copy of your statement?<br />
MR. GORTON I would hope so. This time it was<br />
written out beforehand. It will get to you as soon as<br />
possible. Mr. Bjelke-Petersen, do you agree?<br />
MR. BJELKE-PETERSEN Yes. I think we ought<br />
to get together ourselves first. This is fairly involved<br />
Mr. Gorton. MR. GORTON That is what we will do, and I<br />
will be at your command when you are ready. Could I just say </p>
<p>1i7.<br />
that I understand what the Premier of New South Wales has<br />
said about adequacy. However, on two of the matters that are<br />
before us I thought there was virtually complete agreement. The<br />
first of those is the taking over of $ 200M of State debt. I thought<br />
the officers had agreed on that. I thought you would be pleased<br />
that we had decided to take over the interest and sinking fund charges<br />
as from the beginning of the year. I thought we had agreed on the<br />
$ 200M a year grant, which otherwise would be a special loan.<br />
I do not know how the Premiers feel, but I do not anticipate much<br />
discussion on those two points.<br />
MR ASKIN I think the main discussion will centre on<br />
the first two items of the 5-point proposal you made last February<br />
that is, the base grant and the improvement, which you said at the<br />
time would be adequately improved, and the betterment factor.<br />
MR GORTON That is what I thought, too.<br />
MR ASKIN These will occupy most of our time.<br />
SIR HENRY BOLTE Except that there could be a<br />
formula used to decide how to apply these other proposals.<br />
MR GORTON There will be discussion clearly<br />
on whether the distribution should be as we have suggested<br />
it is only a suggestion on the question of taking over State<br />
debt and whether that will be distributed in proportion to the<br />
total debt of the States. </p>
<p>SIR HENRY BOLTE Or would be in proportion<br />
to the recoup percentage of the States?<br />
MR GORTON That I am sure will be the subject of<br />
discussion amongst the Premiers, but the total amount is<br />
agreed. The payment of interest and sinking fund charges is<br />
agreed. I shall listen with great interest to how various<br />
Premiers think it should be distributed, but the total will be<br />
the same. Then we shall adjourn now until the ringing of the<br />
bells. The Conference adjourned </p>
