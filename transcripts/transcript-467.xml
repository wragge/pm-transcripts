Statement by the Prime Minister ( Rt. Hon. RoG. Menzifsj<br />
The Commonwealth, after discussion writh the<br />
Premiers, has amended its proposals to provide that the<br />
amount it would advance to the States for housing<br />
construction in .961-62 should be increased by œ 7-mi, instead<br />
of In place of the earlier proposal that total<br />
borrowings of smi.-government and local authorities for<br />
1961-62 should be increased by œ 10m. it now proposed an<br />
increase of .œ 7mo in the programmes of authorities intending<br />
to borrow more than œ 1l00,000, during the year. At the same<br />
time it suggested that smaller authorities with programmes<br />
less than fœ 10,000 should be permitted to borrow as much<br />
during the remainder of the year as they found themselves<br />
able to do. The Coimmonwealth proposal for the distribution of<br />
the fOœ 0,, non-repayable grant remains unchanged,<br />
