Students with disabilities will get more support to help them finish school and find a job under a new National Partnership signed by Prime Minister Julia Gillard and NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell today.</p>
<p>The Gillard Labor Government is providing an extra $47.9 million to support children in NSW Government schools under the national $200 million More Support for Students with Disabilities initiative.</p>
<p>This important initiative is part of the Gillard Government's commitment to making sure all Australians have the best opportunities to learn and get a job  -  regardless of their personal circumstances.</p>
<p>The extra funding will be delivered through a new National Partnership that will allow schools to make the best choices for their students so they can learn more easily and engage with their classmates, teachers and support staff.</p>
<p>For example, schools could use these funds to purchase new assistive technology like computer software, audio and visual tools and low vision aids.</p>
<p>The funding could also help schools make decisions about additional teacher and support staff training, extra hours of in-class support and further teachers' aides.</p>
<p>Funding for non-government schools in NSW under the initiative will be provided through funding agreements that align with this National Partnership.</p>
<p>We know that having the right support at school makes a world of difference for the future of students with disabilities.</p>
<p>Without this type of support for schools, students with disabilities are less likely to complete Year 12, putting them at greater risk of unemployment and social exclusion.</p>
<p>The workforce participation rate for people with disabilities is currently only 53 per cent, meaning thousands of Australians do not have the benefits of a job.</p>
<p>We can make a difference by starting in the classroom and helping every child reach their full potential.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government is determined to make sure people with disabilities and their carers get the best support and the care they deserve.</p>
<p>Work is also underway to develop the first ever National Disability Insurance Scheme - an historic reform that will ensure Australians with disabilities have access to the services they need to participate in society.</p>
<p>The Government is also working with the states and territories to develop a nationally agreed model of collecting information about students with disabilities.</p>
<p>This will allow us to develop the first Australia-wide picture of how many students are in our schools, where they are located and the level of support they are already receiving.</p>
<p>Other measures introduced by the Gillard Government include the $220 million Helping Children With Autism initiative, the $147 million Better Start for Children with Disability program and the creation last year of a new Schools Disability Advisory Council.</p>
<p>We want every student in Australia to have access to the best possible education - the agreement signed today is an important step towards achieving that goal. </p>
