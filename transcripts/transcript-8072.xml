TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, USP CENTRE, VANUATU<br />
1 AUGUST 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there agreement on JACADS?<br />
PM: No, that hasn't been decided yet. They're still<br />
considering the various positions and we'll come back to<br />
that after lunch.<br />
JOURNALIST: been any formal discussion on JACADS Mr<br />
Hawke? PM: There's been formal discussion. It's been discussed<br />
in the Forum. But there are differences of emphasis.<br />
They're trying to get some resolution together which may<br />
bring the different points of view together. That's<br />
going to be resumed<br />
JOURNALIST: What is the sticking point in<br />
PM: No specific sticking point. There's just a<br />
difference of approach on the issue. Now there's<br />
discussions going on over lunch and that will be resumed<br />
after lunch. I mean, that's the way<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you forward the reports?<br />
PM: Yes, they were given the full reports, full reports.<br />
JOURNALIST: What was the response to those?<br />
PM: Well they haven't specifically, you know, addressed<br />
the reports in the comments that have been made.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you put forward the suggestion of<br />
sending over the scientific mission?<br />
PM: Yes, I suggested that would be a good idea.<br />
JOURNALIST: What response did you get?<br />
PM: I don't know how many I mean this is getting<br />
boring. I'm telling you that the matter is not resolved.<br />
There have been initial discussions. There are now<br />
informal meetings going on over lunch. We'll resume it </p>
<p>2<br />
after lunch. I mean so don't let's go back over it four<br />
times. JOURNALIST: To change the subject then Ratu Mara.<br />
Will you be seeing him today over lunch or after lunch?<br />
PM: No he won't be at lunch. I may be seeing him after<br />
lunch. I don't know yet.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is the fact that he's not going to come to<br />
the lunch any form of snubbing?<br />
PM: I don't know. He didn't come to the New Zealand<br />
lunch and he's not going to be at our lunch. So I may<br />
see him afterwards. I really haven't got anything to add<br />
to that.<br />
JOURNALIST: How would you describe that sort of<br />
behaviour? PM: I've got no comment about it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, has the issue of observor<br />
status for the FLNKS come up?<br />
PM: Yes, just before lunch and that's another matter<br />
that will be dealt with after lunch. So you're not doing<br />
too well are you?<br />
JOURNALIST: What can you tell us?<br />
PM: Well I can tell you that the timing of the press<br />
conference is inopportune. It would be much better to<br />
have it after lunch.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can we have it after lunch?<br />
PM: Yes of course you can have one after<br />
JOURNALIST: back to Ratu Mara then. Are you<br />
regretful at this stage at all about the comments the<br />
Australian Government has made on the Fijian<br />
constitution? Did we go in too hard?<br />
PM: No, I think the comments that were made by<br />
spokespersons for the Foreign Affairs Department were<br />
comments that in the light of Australia's historical<br />
position were justified. There's more to be said. I hope<br />
I'll have the opporunity of discussing this with the<br />
Prime Minister of Fiji. That's up to him.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you disappointed that he's not coming to<br />
your lunch today?<br />
PM: I'd rather he was there, yes.<br />
ends </p>
