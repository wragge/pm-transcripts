TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PORT BOTANY, 15 MAY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Nick Greiner has offered to decrease state<br />
borrowings at the next Premiers Conference. What's wrong<br />
with that?<br />
PH: who said there was anything wrong with it? He can<br />
afford to and we'll be making the decisions on Thursday at<br />
Canberra at the Premiers conference and Loan Council<br />
meeting, affecting not only New South Wales but the other<br />
States and the Commonwealth as a whole which are necessary<br />
to see that the welfare of the Australian economy is<br />
protected. JOURNALIST: Will the country's borrowings be decreased?<br />
PH; Well, I think it's not a bad idea to leave the<br />
announcement of the decisions till the Premiers Conference<br />
rather than to do it three days beforehand in however<br />
congenial the environment is here.<br />
JOURNALIST; Your comments on the Tasmanian election<br />
results?<br />
0 Pm: Well the Tasmanian election result is one which causes<br />
me a degree of satisfaction. obviously we would've liked to<br />
have won, but I think that was asking probably too much to<br />
win a majoritygin your own right in those circumstances.<br />
There was a significant swing to the Independents because<br />
that swing came from the Liberals. That took care of<br />
We held our vote up.* To the extent that the Tasmanian<br />
election shows an increasing tendency for the electorate to<br />
concern itself with environmental issues, that's a good<br />
thing because our record in that area is impeccable. From<br />
day one when we saved the Franklin In Tasmania and the<br />
series of decisions we've taken in regard to the<br />
rainforests, Kakadu, Barrier Reef and so on, this Government<br />
has got the best environmental record in the history of this<br />
country at the same time as we've had significant economic<br />
development. So we welcome, in a sense, the increasing<br />
public awareness of-the importance of environmental issues.<br />
JOURNALIST: Greens Party in maybe forming a coalition?<br />
PM: No. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
JOURNALIST: What sort of representations Tasmanian<br />
Government at the Premiers Conference?<br />
PM: The representative there will be the Premier, mC Gray.<br />
Mr Gray is still the Premier. Now how he will be influenced<br />
in what he has to say by the considerations of Saturday is a<br />
matter for him, but the formal representative of Tasmania on<br />
Thursday unless between now and then there's been some<br />
changes and r don't think there can be because I don't think<br />
the polls will be declared. it takes a fairly long'<br />
time under the Hare Clark system Tasmania will be<br />
represented by Mr Gray.<br />
JOURNALIST; Prime Minister, are you suprised that a<br />
consumption tax is being moved by Mr Elliott?<br />
PM; Well when ou look at what's happening on the<br />
conservative side of politics I'm not surprised by anything.<br />
I mean you ask am I surprised by the moving of the<br />
consumption tax, well I said yesterday that what clearly<br />
emerged is that Mr Peacock's been established as Leader by<br />
default. it is now out in the open. Mr Elliott was<br />
considering running for the Parliament. He had a numuber of<br />
votes tied up. He made his decision that he wasn't going to<br />
run but said he would allow Mr Peacock to do the job of<br />
hatcheting Mr Howard. So Mr Peacock is there, as it were,<br />
Mr Elliott's hatchet-man. Not surprisingly Mr Hioward has<br />
said that there's funny ideas about loy aty in the Liberal<br />
Party. it's surprising he said that the President of the<br />
Liberal Party, Mir Elliott, was party to this conniving and<br />
didn't tell him what was going on. But the whole plot is<br />
emerging quite clearly now. mr Peacock has said was<br />
economically illiterate# but he's done a little bit of an<br />
apprenticeship. He's learnt to turn over the pages of the<br />
Treasury Bulletins and knows roughly what page to turn to to<br />
find out where some of the relevant statistics are. So he's<br />
done a little bit of an apprenticeship, but the President of<br />
the Party will be calling the shots. He's saying ' there<br />
will be a consumption tax but we'll do a little bit of<br />
deception Andrew. we won't have it in the first term, but<br />
I'm telling you, as the man whole calling the shots, that<br />
the consumption tax will be on in the second term' and it's<br />
all nicely hypothetical because the Australian people aren't<br />
joing to buy that. The other interesting development is the<br />
increasing amount of dissention which is arising each day<br />
now following the coup of last week because we now have the<br />
remarkable situation of the dinner it must have been a<br />
chummy little event down at, where was it, Bathurst or<br />
wherever in the country they met on Sunday night with<br />
Senator Puplick getting up and saying ' of course mr Howard<br />
was offered the shadow Treasury'. Mr Howard getting up and<br />
saying ' that is a lie'. Now, that's followed by today's<br />
statement of one of the leadership team, senator Austin </p>
<p>-3-<br />
P11 ( cont): Lewis, saying that his new leader, Mr Peacock,<br />
has made a mistake and that John Howard should be on the<br />
front bench, should have had the choice of his portfolio.<br />
so what a happy little bunch of pilgrims they are.<br />
JOURNALIST: mr Hawke, does any of this change your<br />
Government's election strategy?<br />
PM; Look, that really is getting old hat, if I may say so.<br />
Who was the person who talked about an early elect ion? it<br />
was a bloke called John Howard., Do you remember him? He<br />
was a leader of the Liberal Party who saw that he was under<br />
some sort of challenge, he didn't realise how imminent it<br />
S was, and said that Bob Hawke, by bringing in the tax cuts in<br />
July, was going to have an early election. I've made it<br />
quite clear that that was the delivery of a promise i'd made<br />
twelve months ago. That if we got a proper wages outcome#<br />
which we have, then the tax cuts would be coming in on the<br />
first of July as part of a wage/ tax deal. So I deliver on a<br />
promise that I made twelve months ago and the late Leader of<br />
the Liberal Party says ' we're going to have an early<br />
election'. Now I didn't say at any stage there was an early<br />
election, so I haven't had any change of plans. As ternpting<br />
as the spilling of all the blood and guts and gore of the<br />
conservatives all over the Parliamentary floor and around<br />
Australia some people might regard that as tempting. I<br />
don't. we'll be going on with the business of managing the<br />
Australian economy. The Australian Parliament is now about<br />
two years, well, not yet two years, into its life, we were<br />
elected in July of ' 87* and we will go on governin, we've<br />
got to do some tough things. we've got to restrain the<br />
economy somewhat, we're still operating at somewhat too high<br />
a level, so we're going to have to try and get the level of<br />
activity down because we can't sustain the high level<br />
of imports we've got. But we'll go on governing, making the<br />
necessarily tough decisions that will be made, but also in a<br />
situation where the living standards of Australians are<br />
going to be able to rise because of the very substantial tax<br />
cuts that will be coming into their pockets from the first<br />
of July. so we go on with the business of sitting down,<br />
hard work of Government, making the decisions that are<br />
necessary while the conservative opponents, with each<br />
passing day shwtotig. Oe, tey'e got no policies<br />
and secondly, and one of the reasons wy they've got no<br />
policies is because they hate one another with an intensity<br />
unrivalled in the history of Australian politics.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, how disruptive do you think mr<br />
Howard is going to be in the ensuing months<br />
M Well it's a bit unfair to Mr Howard to accuse him of<br />
being disruptive. I mean what happened? I mean it's fair<br />
game and I can speak with a reasonable amount of<br />
historical experience and authority in this matter it's </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PH ( cant): fair game for someone to want to get the<br />
leadership if they think they can do it better. No-one,<br />
including Mr Howard, has objected to that and to his credit<br />
he said ' well that's fair enough if mr Peacock wants to<br />
knock me of f he can'. But he's not been the one that's been<br />
disruptive. He considered his position and said that he<br />
would wish to be in the shadow cabinet, nominated reasonably<br />
two positions, Foreign Affairs and Defence. Now in one of<br />
the most calculated and ungracious acts of a new Leader, I<br />
think in the history of Australian politics, Mr Peacock said<br />
' really, truly?, it went like that. To John Howard,<br />
offered him Education, said ' I can't give you Defence<br />
because I want to put Defence in the hands of that genius,<br />
Jim Carlton'.<br />
JOURNALIST; DO you see your Opposition<br />
PM: Now, just a minute. To talk about Mr Howard being<br />
disruptive in those circumstances requires a rather<br />
remarkable feat of intellect. I mean he said ' well I'm<br />
prepared to serve with you', but Mr Peacock said ' well<br />
Sou're not good enough for Defence, Jim Carlton's much<br />
etter'. Now if there's any disruption, it's there and now<br />
it's paying of f because the Liberal Party is now in<br />
unprecedented turmoil. I mean I can't remember any time<br />
that it's been in more turmoil than it is now because you've<br />
got the actual leadership, the new leadership, blew it<br />
saying ' this new Leader, Peacock, has blown it'.<br />
JOURNALIST: Getting back to Tasmania for a moment<br />
PH: Yes, we are going around the world aren't we? Across<br />
to Tasmania, across the Tasman, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: will the result down there mean any sharpeninig<br />
in your own environmental policies?<br />
PM: No. What I have in preparation already, well in<br />
preparation not in reaction to any Tasmanian result, is a<br />
major statement on the environment. That is well under<br />
preparation now, which will bring together a number of<br />
developments that I have asked to be initiated which will<br />
deal with the global issues of the Greenhouse Effect, the<br />
depletion of the ozone layer, particularly Australian issues<br />
like soil degradation and we'll be making a major statement<br />
in June or July which will be, I think, the most<br />
comprehensive statement that any Government in the world is<br />
able to make. I don't think there's any Government which,<br />
on the whole range of environmental issues, has on the<br />
record and in the books, processes to deal with the whole<br />
range of environmental issues. we're extremely proud of<br />
what we've done and we are committed to having a<br />
comprehensive attack upon all these issues which are of<br />
properly increasing importance to the Australian electorate.<br />
