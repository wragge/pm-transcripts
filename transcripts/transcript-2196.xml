FOR PRESS P. M. No 38/ 1970<br />
C. S. I. R. 0. SCIENTISTS STUDY OIL SLICK<br />
Two C. S. I. R. 0. scientists both members of the Division<br />
of Fisheries and Oceanography are being sent to Queensland to study the<br />
effect of the oil that has escaped from the OCEANIC GRANDEUR.<br />
The Government felt that in view of the forthcoming Royal<br />
Commission into oil drilling on the Great Barrier Reef, it would be<br />
valuable to gain as much knowledge as possible from the tanker incident.<br />
