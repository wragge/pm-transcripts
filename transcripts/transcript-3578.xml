PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 4<br />
6 January, 1975<br />
TASMAN BRIDGE TRAGEDY<br />
The Prime Minister's Office has released the text of the<br />
message sent by the Prime Minister to the Premier of Tasmania<br />
following last nights Tasman Bridge tragedy.<br />
" I am shocked by the news of the disaster in<br />
Tasmania. While details of the loss of life are not fully clear<br />
it is plain that Australians have suffered another grievous<br />
and unexpected tragedy. The city of Hobart has lost a vital<br />
link for transport and communications. The whole of Tasmania<br />
has been dealt a heavy blow. My deepest sympathy goes out to<br />
all families and relatives of the victims. I pledge the full<br />
and ready co-operation of the Australian Government in<br />
restoring the bridge and making good the loss and disruption<br />
suffered by the Tasmanian people. My Government stands ready,<br />
in consultation and co-operation with the State authorities, to<br />
do everything possible to alleviate this disaster and irv-estigate<br />
its causes. E. G. Whitlam."<br />
