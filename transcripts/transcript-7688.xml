' a TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH PETER THOMPSON, ABC AM, 21 JULY<br />
1989 E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
THOMPSON: What's been the key factor in the greening of Bob<br />
Hawke? PM: well, the first thing to say about the greening of Bob<br />
Hawke is it's not a recent phenomenon. In the election<br />
campaign which brought us to Government in the beginning of<br />
' 83 1 then led I might say against some opposition within<br />
my own Party and certainly against the total opposition of<br />
the Liberal and National Party I led the fight to save the<br />
Franklin because I was convinced then that to dam the<br />
Franklin would be both environmentally obscene as well as<br />
being economically unnecessary. So I've been there before<br />
it became fashionable. I suppose in these things too, the<br />
more you're in office, the more information you get across<br />
your desk, Peter, and I've come increasingly to understand<br />
two things. Firstly, that environmental issues are of<br />
increasing importance, not just in an aesthetic sense, if<br />
you want to put it that way, but truly in a survival sense.<br />
Secondly, to understand that environmental concern is<br />
compatible with a commitment to economic growth.<br />
THOMPSON: The green vote in Tasmania, less than two months<br />
ago, is that significant in the Government's estimation?<br />
PM: No, there's a lot of cynicism about that. It is a<br />
matter of recorded, provable, indisputable fact that our<br />
work on the preparation of this statement commenced well<br />
before the Tasmanian election. Some people are saying it's<br />
a reaction to that. of course, as in a lot of the cynicism<br />
around this country, that simply is not true and is provably<br />
not true. But let me say this, the Tasmanian election was<br />
not an isolated event.-If you look around the world,<br />
including at the European elections, that is for the<br />
European Parliament, just a few weeks ago which took place<br />
while I was in Europe, it is the case that people everywhere<br />
are demonstrating their concern about environmental issues<br />
and in many ways they are doing this in many ways and<br />
that they're including, by a larger vote for parties<br />
particularly identified with environmental issues. </p>
<p>A -2-<br />
THOMPSON: Well turning now to soil conservation, the $ 320<br />
million which has been earmarked for the decade. How will<br />
that money be spent?<br />
PM: Well, there'll be a number of ways in which that will<br />
be done. Particularly there'll be work in the Murray<br />
Darling Basin, there'll be the provision of money to groups<br />
which will in fact be formed around the country to cooperate<br />
in protecting the soil. Very largely we will be making sure<br />
that what we do is done in a way which is cooperative with<br />
people in the areas particularly affected because you can't,<br />
you know, do these things simply from Canberra. That's why<br />
we are saying there will be a decade of Landcare and under<br />
that, through that decade, you will have a number of things<br />
being done to take up that $ 320 million. There'll be a<br />
Landcare liaison group which will be established and it'll<br />
comprise representatives of not just of Commonwealth<br />
Departments, but they will then be working with other groups<br />
to ensure that the National Soil Conservation Program will<br />
be given effect to. Let me point out that over the next two<br />
years in particular $ 49 million will be provided to that<br />
National Soil Conservation Program.<br />
THOMPSON: Not direct money to farmers?<br />
PM: No, there'll be assistance to those who are prepared<br />
themselves and with groups to undertake particular<br />
developments and protective devices on their own programs.<br />
For instance, we'll be providing about $ 6 million to fund<br />
projects, actual projects of Landcare groups and<br />
coordinators and, with the preparation of farm and regional<br />
plans, the idea is to seed the money into groups which are<br />
going to be working with farmers and those who are going to<br />
be themselves undertaking these programs.<br />
THOMPSON: Is there a fundamental contradiction of some sort<br />
between the Government's economic mission, the more widely<br />
perceived economic mission of Australia, to increase exports<br />
and also land care and conservation. For example, if<br />
Australia is to process more raw materials that will<br />
undoubtedly increase greenhouse gases. If we're going to<br />
have tourist development on the coast, that will have an<br />
impact there.<br />
PM: No, it's a question of the way in which these things<br />
are done. Now just let me take the second part first, the<br />
coastal development. No-one is arguing that there won't be<br />
any development, any further development of tourist resorts.<br />
The point is that what we must do now, in our judgement, is<br />
to ensure that in the use of our coastal zone there is not<br />
just the one criterion which is employed that is the<br />
tourist dollar. So that is why we are going to be doing<br />
these things. Firstly we have referred the whole question<br />
of coastal zone development to the Resources Assessment<br />
Commission which we have now established and that will<br />
enable representations to be made by all interest in the<br />
community as to the overall principles and concerns and </p>
<p>46 -3-<br />
PM ( cont): issues which ought to be taken into account in<br />
this development. This will be a fairly lengthy process.<br />
We're also establishing a national working group on coastal<br />
management which will provide for input directly from the<br />
tourism industry, from environmentalists, from state and<br />
local governments, so that together we are going to be able<br />
to develop a consideration of what are those sorts of<br />
principles and processes which ought to be involved in<br />
development. As I say, it doesn't mean there won't be any<br />
further development, but it does mean that in the future<br />
there'll be a much greater consideration taken into account<br />
when projects are put forward of what impact on the<br />
environment would the development of that proposal have.<br />
Now, we're doing those things and in the same time while it<br />
is the case that these matters in the end under the<br />
Constitution are the responsibility of the States, we<br />
nevertheless have a reserve power in two respects. We have<br />
the corporations power and we have the power in regard to<br />
foreign investment. If you took an absolutely worst case<br />
scenario where a state, and really we've got two left now.<br />
We've got Queensland which has an awful record. In NSW<br />
we've just got to keep our fingers crossed in regard to the<br />
way they approach coastal development. But were a state to<br />
take a position in regard to some project by a company, and<br />
particularly if it's a foreign company, which was manifestly<br />
against proper environmental considerations then we wouldn't<br />
hesitate in those circumstances to use our powers.<br />
THOMPSON: So you think you have sufficient powers and don't<br />
need a referendum clarifying those powers?<br />
PM: No, I'm not saying that Peter. I'm saying, if you'd<br />
listen carefully to what I was saying, our powers are<br />
indirect in a way. They derive from the corporations power<br />
and they derive from foreign investment powers. obviously<br />
it would be in my judgement best if there was an unqualified<br />
power in the federal constitution in regard to the<br />
environment. Because the simple fact is environmental<br />
problems have no respect for state boundaries. The sorry<br />
history of referenda in this country is that unless you have<br />
bipartisan support your chances of getting them carried are<br />
just about zilch.<br />
THOMPSON: You wouldn't have one without bipartisan support?<br />
PM: What I'm saying is we will try and develop a community<br />
understanding of these issues and we'll just express the<br />
hope that the Opposition, which up to this point has a<br />
hopeless record on environmental issues, that they will see<br />
the light and would become supportive of creating that<br />
attitude in the community so that a referendum could be<br />
passed. But we're certainly not going into a situation of<br />
dividing the community in a situation where the opposition<br />
won't carry their responsibility. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
THOMPSON: Can I get back to growth. The second part of the<br />
question I asked about processing raw materials and<br />
increasing Greenhouse gases. The Australian Conservation<br />
Foundation feels that your lack of direct commitment on<br />
reducing Greenhouse gases is the number one weakness of your<br />
statement. PM: No. You're right in saying Peter that some of them<br />
have expressed concern by the absence of an actual target.<br />
But let me say this. That what we accept as a government is<br />
that we have a responsibility as part of the total<br />
international community to ensure a reduction of the range<br />
of Greenhouse effects which include carbon dioxide, methane<br />
and nitrous oxide. What we have said is that we intend<br />
within Australia to do everything we can to pursue a greater<br />
efficiency in energy use. What we also intend to do is to<br />
discuss internationally whether in fact in regard to some<br />
areas of production it may not be better to do those in<br />
Australia where we are significantly more efficient energy<br />
producers and consumers. So that in net terms if that were<br />
to happen Australia would be making its contribution. In<br />
other words certain enterprises and functions undertaken in<br />
Australia as compared with overseas would in global net<br />
terms involve a reduction. Now we also intend, as I say, to<br />
look at the areas of methane gas reduction where we may be<br />
able to do even more than others. So that we accept the<br />
obligation as part of the international community to reduce<br />
the Greenhouse gases and we will do that.<br />
THOMPSON: Just before we go. Yesterday was your<br />
comprehensive statement on the environment. Next month<br />
gives you a chance for a comprehensive statement on the<br />
economy in the Budget. Is there light at the end of the<br />
tunnel?<br />
PM: There has always been light at the end of this tunnel<br />
that people are talking about. The Australian economy<br />
you've got to understand is going through a problem of<br />
strength and not of weakness. The problems that we have got<br />
and that we're dealing with are characterised by too strong<br />
a growth. That has meant that we have had to impose<br />
restraints, particularly in regard to interest rates. As<br />
I've said before. I'm an intelligent politican. I don't<br />
have interest rates high just for the fun of it. I'm not a<br />
masochist or a sadist. They are there deliberately to try<br />
and reduce the level of activity. Activity which has seen<br />
the creation of one and a half million new jobs, an economy<br />
which is growing strongly. We've got to bring that back so<br />
that we can sustain the level of imports by our own level of<br />
export activity. So the light has always been there of a<br />
strongly growing economy. What we've got to do is to bring<br />
that back to sustainable levels. On that point let me say<br />
Peter there is evidence, not yet overwhelming and conclusive<br />
evidence, but there is evidence I believe of the beginning<br />
of that slowdown of activity to acceptable levels.<br />
i J </p>
<p>THOMPSON: Just a final one. Earlier this year you said<br />
living standards would rise in the forseeable future. Is<br />
that still possible?<br />
PM: In 1988-89, the financial year just finished, that has<br />
obviously happened. You've had a significant increase in<br />
employment, significant increase in company incomes,<br />
significant increase in farm income and wages moving in line<br />
with inflation. So it's happened in the financial year that<br />
I was talking about and in this year ahead the exact outcome<br />
of course will depend upon the ability of the economy to<br />
achieve just what I was talking about. That is reigning in<br />
the excess levels of demand. But you will have in this<br />
situation a continuing high level of farm income because<br />
commodity prices are going to stay up, company income looks<br />
reasonably good and you will have wage increases in line,<br />
approximately, with what's going to be happening with<br />
inflation. But the exact outcome of course will depend upon<br />
how we as a community handle the degree of restraint that is<br />
still necessary.<br />
THOMPSON: Prime Minister, thanks for the taking the time to<br />
join us this morning on AM.<br />
PM: It's been my pleasure Peter. Thank you.<br />
