Belgium Speech by the Prime Minister of Belgium, M. Leo Tindemans, at a<br />
dinner in honour of the Prime Minister of Australia in Brussels on<br />
16 December 1974<br />
I take great pleasure in welcoming you to Belgium<br />
and also in welcoming Mrs Whitlam, the<br />
Minister of State, and the important Australian<br />
Delegation.<br />
While our two countries are geographically<br />
separated by a great distance, this does not<br />
necessarily mean that our political and moral<br />
aims are different. Quite the contrary, our two<br />
countries are fundamentally attached to political<br />
democracy and improvement in international<br />
relationships, in order to keep peace in the<br />
world and to develop that peace based on a<br />
greater justice.<br />
There also exists a convergence in the foreign<br />
policies followed by our two countries lately,<br />
among others in the United Nations Organisation,<br />
in order to contribute to international<br />
detente. This is in particular the case with the<br />
action we are developing within the framework<br />
of the Non-Proliferation Treaty with the aim of<br />
organising control of nuclear tests.<br />
It was with great interest that I learnt about the<br />
main trends of your home and foreign policy.<br />
At home your Government at present aims at a<br />
greater centralisation and reinforcing of the<br />
responsibilities of the state in the economic and<br />
social field.<br />
As to foreign policy, your country is concerned<br />
about a greater independence and endeavours<br />
to show a characteristically Australian identity.<br />
I believe that our two countries are becoming<br />
more and more aware of the fact that we are at<br />
the start of a period that forces us to consider our<br />
international relationships and to place us in a<br />
renewed framework. The present world can hardly be content with<br />
the bipolar balance that has dominated these<br />
international relationships.<br />
Your country, just like ours, is anxious to contribute<br />
to the development of subcontinental<br />
organisations or communities of nations, after<br />
the manner of our friendly countries of Western<br />
Europe within the framework of the European<br />
Union. I hope that the efforts we undertake in a parallel<br />
direction in this international community will<br />
bear fruit in the near future, in order to make the<br />
same aims prevail.<br />
I also hope that the bilateral relations between<br />
your country and Belgium will be reinforced in<br />
the years to come. These relations already<br />
assume a very important nature in the trade<br />
field. Your country exports to our country important<br />
quantities of iron ore, textile and food products;<br />
we export to your country manufactured goods<br />
which seem to be particularly appreciated by<br />
your Government. I am thinking for instance of<br />
the electronic sector.<br />
It would be desirable if our business relations<br />
could be developed in other fields, in the sector<br />
of uranium, and especially if a more intense<br />
industrial co-operation could be envisaged<br />
between our two countries, for instance through<br />
participating in industrial co-operation agreements.<br />
Prime Minister, today was the first day of your<br />
visit to our country.<br />
I believe our first discussions have been fruitful </p>
<p>so that one can envisage concrete progress in<br />
the above-mentioned fields.<br />
I hope that tomorrow you will be able to go<br />
deeply into the different aspects of our future<br />
collaboration, not only as to what concerns our<br />
own country, but also in regard to the relationships<br />
with the European Economic Community.<br />
The Prime Minister with the Prime Minister of Belgium, </p>
<p>Speech by the Prime Minister of Australia at a dinner given in his<br />
honour by the Prime Minister of Belgium in Brussels on<br />
16 December 1974<br />
Thank you, Prime Minister, for the warm and<br />
gracious welcome you have accorded my wife<br />
and me and the members of my party. It is<br />
fitting that my visit to Europe should begin here<br />
in Brussels, the very capital of Europe, a city<br />
ancient in its culture and history yet symbolising<br />
all that is modern and contemporary in the<br />
new Europe. It is fifteen years since an Australian<br />
Prime Minister made an official visit to<br />
Belgium and the other capitals of Europe. Ten,<br />
or even five years ago, no Australian Prime<br />
Minister would have visited Brussels before<br />
going to London. No Australian Prime Minister<br />
would have discussed in Brussels matters<br />
affecting not only Australia's relations with Belgium<br />
but her relations with Britain and Europe.<br />
For our part, nothing could illustrate more<br />
clearly the momentous changes that have<br />
occurred in recent years-in Belgium, in Britain,<br />
in Europe, in Australia, in the world at large. I<br />
welcome the opportunity to reaffirm the<br />
strength of our friendship. Throughout this era<br />
of historic change relations between Belgium<br />
and Australia have grown and strengthenedfounded<br />
as they are in common cultural traditions<br />
and based on the enduring Western<br />
values of liberty, democracy and the rule of law.<br />
There is an impression abroad-in Australia and<br />
elsewhere-that Europe no longer matters to<br />
Australia, and that our destiny now lies exclusively<br />
with Asia, Japan and the nations to our<br />
north. That is a false impression. It is true that<br />
Australia has developed closer and more realistic<br />
ties with Asia and Japan. Our trade with<br />
those nations has increased three-fold in the<br />
last twenty years, and Japan is now our biggest<br />
single trading partner. No one welcomes more<br />
than I do the historic trends that have brought<br />
Australia closer to the nations of her own region,<br />
deepened our friendship with our neighbours<br />
and sharpened our sense of regional responsibility.<br />
No one has worked harder to encourage<br />
those trends. But it would be a grave mistake to<br />
suppose that our greater involvement in Asia<br />
means a lesser involvement in Europe. Australia's interests in Europe are of great and<br />
growing importance.<br />
Britain and Europe take roughly one-third of our<br />
exports. Our involvement in Asia and our involvement<br />
in Europe are not mutually exclusive.<br />
They are complementary. They reflect not only<br />
our desire-a natural desire-to enlarge our role<br />
in the world, but a growing trend towards interdependence<br />
between all nations. On my first<br />
visit to Brussels as Prime Minister I reaffirm<br />
Australia's profound and lasting interest in<br />
Europe, our support for the European ideal, and<br />
our desire for stronger and closer ties with all<br />
European nations.<br />
Australia has always given her full support to<br />
the concept of a united Europe. It is true that we<br />
have sought to safeguard our own trading<br />
interests as best we can, but on the wider issue<br />
of European unity there has never been any<br />
question of our support for the high principles<br />
and noble aspirations that guide and sustain the<br />
European community. Australia believes deeply<br />
in the value of regional co-operation at the<br />
economic and political levels: in our own region<br />
we have done our best to promote it. How natural,<br />
then, that we should support one of the<br />
greatest and most successful examples of<br />
regional integration ever attempted by sovereign<br />
nations. I acknowledge the anxiety that<br />
many Australians felt at the prospect of Britain's<br />
entry. Speaking for myself, it seemed to me a matter of<br />
profound historical justice, of singular ' rightness',<br />
that within the space of a week in 1971,<br />
two of the world's greatest nations were committed<br />
to membership of organisations to which<br />
they were destined to belong-China was<br />
admitted to the United Nations General Assembly,<br />
and the House of Commons voted in favour<br />
of Britain's entry to the European Community.<br />
May I say, Prime Minister, how greatly Australians<br />
admire your own contribution to the<br />
cause of Europe and Belgium's central role in<br />
that cause. This city, always one of the loveliest </p>
<p>in Europe, now enjoys a new eminence and a<br />
proud status as the institutional capital of the<br />
European communities and the headquarters of<br />
its most significant and enduring security alliance.<br />
Australians for many years honoured<br />
your predecessor, the late Paul-Henri Spaak, as<br />
a statesman of world stature and one of the<br />
founding spirits of the Common Market.<br />
It is appropriate that you, Sir, have been<br />
charged by the recent conference of Heads of<br />
Government of the Community with the task of<br />
reporting to them on the prospects and progress<br />
of European political unity. In that difficult and<br />
complex undertaking, I have no doubt that your<br />
efforts will bring closer the fundamental and<br />
guiding objective which for twenty years has<br />
provided the inspiration and philosophical basis<br />
of the European experiment-the belief that<br />
independent states may one day submerge<br />
their political differences and come together in a<br />
political union.<br />
There are pressing reasons why nations'of all<br />
kinds must seek a unity of purpose, a greater<br />
measure of co-operation and understanding.<br />
The whole world-Australia no less than Belgium,<br />
our own region no less than Europe-is<br />
beset by problems of unprecedented difficulty,<br />
of daunting complexity, of great danger. Overpopulation,<br />
pollution, the energy shortage, terrorism,<br />
racial tensions are some of the most<br />
urgent. Overhanging the economies of the<br />
Western nations are the twin problems of<br />
unemployment and inflation. Because these<br />
problems are global in their scope and origin,<br />
the solutions to them must be international<br />
solutions. It is folly to pretend that they will be<br />
solved by nations, or even groups of nations,<br />
acting alone or in isolation.<br />
What is at stake is not just the ability of democratic<br />
states to manage their economies, but<br />
people's faith in the ability of democracy to survive.<br />
Must the democracies concede that only<br />
authoritarian regimes can cope with inflation<br />
and employment? This is a battle that the<br />
democracies must win, not just for the sake of<br />
their economies, but for the sake of their democratic<br />
institutions. Here in Europe, where the<br />
highest living standards are combined with the<br />
highest measure of personal freedom and a<br />
unique abundance of cultural and artistic riches,<br />
the advanced industrial nations have a supreme incentive to preserve the strength of their system<br />
and overcome the social economic and environmental<br />
problems that threaten its survival.<br />
No nation has pursued a more active policy of<br />
international co-operation than Belgium during<br />
the past quarter of a century. I pay tribute to that<br />
effort. You are a member of the United Nations,<br />
a member of NATO, a member of the Council of<br />
Europe and Western European Union. You are<br />
one of the Benelux countries. You are a member<br />
of Euratom, the European Coal and Steel Community<br />
and, of course, the EEC. Your support for<br />
the Atlantic Alliance and an integrated Europe<br />
has provided the basis of a viable Belgian<br />
foreign policy. There is not a better example of<br />
the ability of a small power to set an example of<br />
co-operation and exercise an influence for good<br />
out of all proportion to its size and population.<br />
There is another reason why European union is<br />
profoundly important for the world. It has a<br />
poignant relevance to my own country no less<br />
than yours. Thousands of Australians fought<br />
and died in Belgium during the two world wars.<br />
Ypres, Mons, Messines are names firmly<br />
engraved on the consciousness of the Australian<br />
people. I visited this morning the tomb of<br />
the Unknown Soldier and every year the Australian<br />
Ambassador in this city attends a<br />
ceremony at the Menin Gate in memory of the<br />
Belgian and Australian soldiers who fought as<br />
comrades in arms. We recall the suffering of<br />
those days, not to glorify war but to reaffirm the<br />
spirit of peace which is so much a part of the<br />
spirit of the new Europe. All your plans, all your<br />
hopes, all your ambitions for a greater and more<br />
prosperous Europe rest on the preservation of<br />
peace. If your Community achieves nothing<br />
else, the world will rejoice that for the first time<br />
the threat of war has been lifted from a continent<br />
ravaged by the most terrible wars in<br />
history. In this context I commend the action of your<br />
Government in ratifying the nuclear nonproliferation<br />
treaty. Australia has worked<br />
consistently for the strengthening of that treaty.<br />
We regard it as crucial to the preservation of<br />
peace and the survival of civilisation. The<br />
alternative is a nightmare world in which dozens<br />
of nations may possess nuclear weapons by the<br />
early 1980s. Yet six years after the treaty was<br />
concluded and four years after it came into </p>
<p>force, some states-including some states in<br />
Europe-have still to ratify the treaty or make<br />
clear their renunciation of nuclear weapons<br />
development. Australia and Belgium are comparatively small<br />
powers. Remote as we are from each other in<br />
terms of distance, we have a great deal in common.<br />
We are affluent nations in a world of widespread<br />
poverty. We are highly industrialised.<br />
We are devoted to regional co-operation. Our<br />
bilateral trade, though modest in scale, has<br />
grown steadily and exhibits a remarkable balance.<br />
Australia's exports to Belgium in<br />
1973-74 were worth $ A59000000: Belgium's<br />
exports to Australia were worth<br />
$ A57 000 000. Australia's ties with Europe<br />
have been strengthened since World War II by a<br />
vast immigration program. It is a reminder to us<br />
that modern civilisation in Australia sprang from<br />
the great tide of European colonisation in the<br />
19th century-a process of colonisation in<br />
which Belgium played her part.<br />
To the north, east and west of Australia there<br />
are many nations which were once parts of<br />
European empires. These links with Europe<br />
have left an enduring mark on the newer<br />
nations of Africa, Asia and the Pacific. Australia,<br />
like many other states in her region, has set her<br />
own firm and independent course in world<br />
affairs. In doing so we acknowledge our historic<br />
and cultural debt to Europe and look to the<br />
nations of Europe for support and collaboration<br />
in overcoming the problems shared by all mankind.<br />
I take heart from the great achievement in<br />
international co-operation we have witnessed<br />
in Europe itself-an achievement in which your<br />
own country has played a lasting and a leading<br />
role. </p>
<p>Speech by the Prime Minister of Australia at the International<br />
Press Centre in Brussels on 18 December 1974<br />
I am conscious that my visit to Europe-the first<br />
by an Australian Prime Minister for fifteen<br />
years-coincides with a growing sense of crisis<br />
in international economic affairs. Continuing<br />
high rates of inflation, the threat of emergent<br />
recessionary forces, severe balance of payments<br />
problems for many countries, strains on international<br />
monetary mechanisms and the accentuation<br />
of the problems of the developing countries<br />
constitute pressures of a magnitude and<br />
diversity which the world has not faced since<br />
the war. The European Community is the largest single<br />
trading bloc in the world. The impact of these<br />
developments on the relationships between the<br />
Community and other countries and between<br />
member nations within the Community is of<br />
major significance to all the world's trading<br />
countries. As the Head of Government of a trading<br />
nation of growing significance, I believe<br />
these events demonstrate with unmistakable<br />
force the interdependence of the world's economies.<br />
Such a comment may sound trite. There<br />
are times, however, when restating the obvious<br />
