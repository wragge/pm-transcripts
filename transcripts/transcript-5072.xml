PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT<br />
INTERVIEW WITH " TODAY TONIGHT" SHOW<br />
BRISBANE 16 JUNE 1979<br />
Question: Prime Minister, on Thursday you have a threatened national<br />
stoppage. Is it your intention to do anything about it,<br />
to in-ervene?<br />
Pr i-. e Minister:<br />
I been keeping in very close touch with Mr Viner, and<br />
I hae also spoken to Des O'Neil, who is the Acting Premier,<br />
in relation to this particular matter. It is very serious,<br />
but I doubt really if everyone understands precisely what<br />
has happened. I have been advised that there was a<br />
compulsory hearing in relation to a dispute in the Pilbara,<br />
which was actual! v in process, and that a number of people<br />
we-z along, disrupted the hearing, prevented it going ahead,<br />
and virtually called a meeting disrupted it on the<br />
doorsteps of the hearing. Now, I don't think that message<br />
has got through, and, if that is correct, I think it might<br />
put a slightly different view of what has occurred.<br />
In addition to that, of course, nobody can be above the<br />
law. If a law is bad, people can look at that in calm<br />
circumstances and then examine it. But the law in Western<br />
Australia, again as I am advised, is related to meetings<br />
in a public place. I am told that there have been several<br />
hundred meetings under the law and no problem whatsoever.<br />
I have also been advised that the particular people concerned<br />
mirht well have gone along and advised the police that they<br />
were going to break the law. In other words, they knew what<br />
it was and the law had not been oppressive, I don't think,<br />
as I am advised that...<br />
Question: Ycu don't believe that it is oppressive?<br />
Prime Minister: ajm advised, I don't believe that there are<br />
al--c: ses. I n wn-ch the right to hold a meeting had been<br />
witheld. And there is a question of the protection of the<br />
general public when meetings are in public places, no question<br />
of private places. Against that kind of background, I think<br />
we want to make quite certain that we have a full understanding<br />
of the facts before we go in and say that a law should not be<br />
upheld. So often people say that in industrial cases the law<br />
should not apply, the trade unionist is above the law. Now,<br />
our society just won't work that way, and it is saying something<br />
terribly serious and terribly dangerous if we are going to<br />
say that any particular trade unionist has carte blanche to<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
do what he likes break any law if it is in the name of<br />
trade unionism.<br />
Question: Sir, that very attitude, it would seem to me, is going to<br />
exacerbate the situation, because it is not the interpretation<br />
of the trade unionists, put on what has happened in Western<br />
Australia. Prime Minister:<br />
I know. But also what I have just said as to the facts, I think,<br />
is not understood. Now, I said if what I have been advised<br />
is :: rrect. I put that proviso on it. I have no reason to<br />
believe it is not correct, but I haven't been able to check<br />
and: ' double-check up to this point.<br />
Ques tion:<br />
All right, then let's put it this way. You don't want a<br />
national stoppage on Thursday, do you?<br />
Pr-me Minister:<br />
No, of course we don't.<br />
Question: Is there much you can do to avoid that happening?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think it might be very difficult, but one of the things<br />
that would certainly help is understanding of what the<br />
circumstances were about. Now, if again, as I have been<br />
told, the people concerned had in fact disrupted a compulsory<br />
hearing called to settle a particular dispute, if that had<br />
been done deliberately and designedly, well then I'm not too<br />
sure that that is something that the authorities should<br />
ignore. I think that is a serious matter.<br />
Question; So, you are really going to stand by the West Australian<br />
government by the sound of it.<br />
Pr-e : i~ izer<br />
What I have said is subject to confirmation in relation to<br />
the facts. But I think we need, again, to understand that<br />
if we are going to say that a particular group of people are<br />
beyond the reach of the law within Australia, then we are<br />
saying something that has fundamental consequences for the<br />
nature and development of Australian society. We know very<br />
well that trade unions exert very great power. Sometimes<br />
they use that power with a real degree of irresponsibility. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
Nobody ever says that companies, that individually have much<br />
much less power than I think the trade union movement, should<br />
be beyond the law, and if a company or company director<br />
breaks the law, it comes down on him like a ton of bricks.<br />
It is only in the trade union area, and for the very reason<br />
that unions are so powerful, for the very reason they can have<br />
so much influence, for the very reason that they can cause so<br />
much harm and disruption not only to the general community but<br />
also to their own members, they cannot be placed above the<br />
law. Question:<br />
All rj-ight. They have the power to bring this nation to a<br />
standstill on Thursday. You have the power to stop it.<br />
I t. "-that most people would say stop it Prime Minister.<br />
Cerainly that is what is being said in the papers today<br />
and the employers.<br />
Prime 4inister:<br />
I think that is one thing too but I'm not too sure again<br />
how many employers in the Eastern states understand what it<br />
is a1l about. You have the power to stop it people have<br />
the tower to give in to every union demand. If that is the<br />
onl-,_ way it can be stopped, that also is saying something<br />
very fundamentally serious about the nature of Australian society.<br />
Question: Have you told the -; est Australian government not to yield?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, I have discussed it with Des O'Neil, I have discussed the<br />
matter with Ian Viner, and against that background I have<br />
been principally wanting to make myself fully advised as to<br />
the facts of what had occurred. Frmi what I have been told as to<br />
the facts at the moment I think it would be very difficult to<br />
see a cause for intervention by the Australian government to<br />
disrupt the processes of the law. Sir Charles Court has said<br />
that after the matter is over he is prepared to look at the<br />
law and the application of the law. He has made that perfectly<br />
pla--. But against the background that there would have<br />
appeared to be a very deliberate attempt to disrupt a<br />
comzp-sory conference designed to settle an industrial dispute<br />
between management and labour in the Pilbara.<br />
Question: Can I put it to you though that it may simply be this: someone<br />
exercising the fundamental right of assembly. That is quite<br />
democratic. Prime Minister:<br />
Yes, there is a fundamental right of assembly, but is there a<br />
fundamental right to disrupt a compulsory conference called<br />
by the industrial authorities? Is that the way we are to<br />
conduct our business? ./ 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
Question: All right. An illegal assembly is what you are saying.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It would have been very easy for the people concerned, as I am<br />
advised, to make it a legal assembly very easy.<br />
Question: Prime Minister, let's change the subject. I think I would<br />
be pretty right in saying that the average Queenslander, at<br />
the mo-ment, is very suspicious about the way the Federal<br />
Gove.. ent and the State Government have gone about dissolving<br />
the : u-estion whether there is to be drilling on the Great<br />
Barri_ r Reef. I think most Queenslanders believe that at<br />
som.= oint in time the Reef will be drilled. Do you think<br />
I an. rong?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think probably. I haven't had that view put to me over the<br />
last four days when I have been travelling quite widely in<br />
Queensland. I think you need to understand what has happened.<br />
We made a decision to support the Royal Commission findings<br />
in relation to the Barrier Reef. There will be short and long<br />
term research, and no question of drilling arises until after<br />
that research is undertaken and then we look at it. So, there<br />
certain. y can't be any immediate problem. Secondly, we have<br />
come to final and complete arrangements about the management<br />
of the Reef itself. The authority of the Great Barrier Reef<br />
Marine Park Authority, under its present act, remains totally<br />
unimpaired. Now, certainly I announced with the Treasurer<br />
that there would be a ministerial council that would monitor<br />
and survey what is happening and make recommendations to<br />
Government. But if there isn't agreement on that Ministerial<br />
Council, it is the Federal Government that would have to make<br />
up its mind, and under its own act the authority of the Great<br />
Barrier Reef Marine Park not only operates over the full region<br />
of the Reef, but it will also operate over that area of the<br />
Reef that will encroach on Queensland's three-mile territorial<br />
sea. where we want. to give the States practical power for a<br />
nu..-ber of other reasons not related to the Reef. But we wanted<br />
to do that in a way that wouldn't prejudice or diminish<br />
the responsibilities and authority of the Great Barrier Reef<br />
D-A-4-rty So, T think the government of Queensland<br />
has Deer ve-reasonable indeed in this particular matter.<br />
The-7 didn't press us to alter the Commonwealth act. They<br />
accepted that as a fact of life, and they have accepted as a<br />
fact of life that it should cover the whole region of the<br />
Reef. </p>
<p>5<br />
Can suggest, though, that all that is very confusing. That<br />
wan Scme Queenslanders want is an assurance, a very firm<br />
assurance, that there will never be oil drilling on or near<br />
the 2arrier Reef. All you have said so far really is that<br />
there u7on't be any drilling on the Reef.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, we've said much more than that. We have said that there<br />
is going to be a great deal of research undertaken before<br />
anv decisions are made. Secondly, we have made it perfectly<br />
plain that the power of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park<br />
Authority is totally unimpaired. It will be conducting its<br />
proper activities, the proclamations will be going ahead,<br />
and really in this particular matter there is nothing<br />
whatsoever to be concerned about.<br />
Question: So, the possibility is there though, is it not, that given<br />
the right conditions, given the right recommendations, that<br />
drilling could go ahead on the Barrier Reef?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Certainly not in any kind of short-term time train, because<br />
thE -esearch has got to be undertaken first, recommended by<br />
ti son, and depending upon the result of that<br />
res-arch then governments can make decisions. But you are / 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
asking me to say in a thousand years time can I give a<br />
guarantee something won't happen, obviously I can't. There<br />
will be different governments in power and all the rest<br />
as you go down the track into the distant future. But the<br />
Great Barrier Reef's safety is assured absolutely.<br />
Question: Do you have a personal view on it, even with all the recommendations.<br />
Science makes mistakes, we all know that.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I have a personal view that governments should not take any<br />
risks whatsoever with the Reef. You mightn't know, but I was<br />
a fundation member of a conservation foundation long before<br />
conservation and environmental matters were a popular issue.<br />
I have been instrumental in getting the world wildlife fund<br />
estZilished in Australia. The record of this government in<br />
env-; rcnmental matters I think is second to none. Sir Peter Scott<br />
the other day, as the President of the World Wildlife Fund,<br />
indicated that in environmental matters, with its decisions on<br />
wha-ling, policies on whaling, Kakadu National Park, Fraser Island,<br />
all of these matters, we have set a world lead. Australia's<br />
nam. e stands very high. The decisions we have taken in relation<br />
to the Great Barrier Reef stand in the same vein. Nobody is<br />
going to take a risk with the future of the Reef.<br />
Question: Prime Minister, one thing that does worry Queenslanders too,<br />
and it relates to the Reef again, and that is inadequate<br />
surveillance really. As you know, Taiwanese are taking out<br />
hundreds of tons of clams off the Reef. Do you regard the<br />
surveillance of -hat area as adequate?<br />
Pri:-e Minister:<br />
Well it has greatly improved under the new surveillance<br />
arrangements that have been introduced over recent months.<br />
Obviously we have to make an assessment later as to how the<br />
new arrangements are working, whether they themselves are<br />
adequate. We hive. made quite sure, because of the involvement<br />
of . rv light aviation that the shortage of Avgas is not<br />
going to reduce surveillance around the Australian coast.<br />
The army, with their aircraft will be filling in the gaps,<br />
not -sinc Avgas, I think their turbine aircraft can use a<br />
dif-ferent fuel. So surveillance, around the Queensland coast<br />
and across the north of Australia is something which we are<br />
taking very seriously. The arrangements that my Government<br />
introduced to undertake that are certainly giving us a much<br />
better coverage than we have ever had before. Now, whether<br />
that is totally adequate or not, we'll have to make a<br />
judgement about it. But we also have to get some kind of<br />
return for what we do with surveillance. If you are going to<br />
be watching every piece of water 24 hours a day with the<br />
coastline Australia has, that is then an operation which would<br />
cost a massive amount of money. / 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
Question: You raised the question there of Avgas, and that does concern<br />
a lot of Queenslanders.<br />
Prime ' niSter:<br />
It greatly concerns the Government also.<br />
Question: Is t&gt; ere much you can do about it?<br />
Pri= a MIinister:<br />
Ove-rcent days we have been conducting a survey of all the<br />
oil = zmpanies. We want to assess as to whether or not there<br />
is a y direct action that the Government can take which would<br />
help in this particular matter. If we have to go into<br />
Government purchasing to increase and enhance oil supplies to<br />
Australia, then I'm quite certain we will stand ready to do<br />
that But there would be not much point in going to government<br />
pur :&gt; ase if that meant that by other means, other devices, the<br />
oil companies reduced their allocation to Australia. There will<br />
be a report ready for the Government very shortly. It's not<br />
not only in Avgas. The whole oil scene is one for concern, and<br />
I think we will need to be introducing some measures in<br />
relation to conservation, in relation to encouraging people<br />
to move to other : orns of energy perhaps much more rapidly.<br />
Question: Do you think we are going to have rationing very soon?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Wel! obviously one would hope that we can avoid that. And I<br />
think it's too early to make a judgement about it. But I<br />
certainly can't put a guarantee that that could not arise.<br />
In some countries thete has been enforced rationing by the<br />
lac: of availability of oil, and it is not helped when the<br />
Unlz= d States continues with oil, fuel, that is too cheap<br />
because they haven't got a world parity pricing policy, and<br />
I was even advised that they are subsidising the import of<br />
heating oil by $ 5 a barrel. That doesn't sound to me like a<br />
ccTsr= vation measure.<br />
Question: It doesn't look good thought does it at the moment for<br />
Australia? I think a lot of people would expect real energy<br />
cutbacks very soon.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well Australia needs certain things, because we're a large<br />
country. People have to travel by road or by air under very </p>
<p>8<br />
substantial differences and therefore fuel is very important<br />
to them. Having said that we're much, much better placed than<br />
many countries. We have coal, we have uranium we have substantial<br />
quanitites of natural gas and therefore we do have alternative<br />
sources of energy within our own control. On the longer term,<br />
there is research being undertaken about<br />
with a German group and there's the possibility of shale ore<br />
development in Queensland and I certainly hope the Queensland<br />
Government will do everything it can to process that as rapidly<br />
as possible, because I think we're going to be in a long-term<br />
situation and the more self-sufficient we are the better but those<br />
developments aren't going to help break in the shorter-term<br />
situation and I think maximising the use of natural gas both in<br />
the Sydney area has been enormous over the last ] 2 months<br />
because of the opening up of the pipe-line. There's been a<br />
ver-: substantial conversion of taxi fleets in Melbourne and<br />
Syne; to gas-fired cars and maybe there's an opportunity for<br />
muc* creater activity there. New South Wales and South<br />
Austra. Lia could help much more by not insisting that their States<br />
gc on-o higher emission standards which will make the cars more<br />
expansive in the use of energy, less efficient and more expensive<br />
an. i's the very wrong time for Government to be taking decisions<br />
bu-zrom late cars use maybe 4% o5 5% more petrol for the same<br />
ae. So there are a number of things we are looking at as a<br />
matter of urgency. There are a number that we'll be wanting to<br />
put to the States and a number of matters that we'll be looking<br />
at on our own account. Now I hope all of this, which is under<br />
the most vigorous examination by our officials will be ready for<br />
the Government's determination quite shortly.<br />
Question Prime Minister, thanks very much for talking to us. </p>
