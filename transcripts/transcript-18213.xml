I welcome you all to Australia, to Western Australia, and to the magnificent city of Fremantle.</p>
<p>I acknowledge the young people in the working group who organised this forum.</p>
<p>Your efforts are very much appreciated.</p>
<p>Appreciated and timely.</p>
<p>Because young people are our source of hope and inspiration for the challenges of tomorrow.</p>
<p>The future of our world as well as the future of the Commonwealth will be shaped by you.</p>
<p>Looking around this room today, there is great cause for optimism about that future.</p>
<p>I see that optimism in your faces.</p>
<p>I think of the life journeys that have brought you here from over 40 countries.</p>
<p>You've come from so many backgrounds and circumstances, many involving adversity.</p>
<p>And I know how passionate for change each of you have become in your own lives.</p>
<p>There are delegates here involved in peace building, climate change networks, social enterprises, peer education, health work.</p>
<p>Each of you has a remarkable story to tell.</p>
<p>Like John Loughton from Scotland, who grew up in a community where crime and youth exclusion was high.</p>
<p>He had first hand experience of being bullied, drug abuse taking hold of the family, and growing up in a home where no-one had ever worked.</p>
<p>But instead of giving in, John used his difficult beginnings to create positive change.</p>
<p>He became an anti-poverty campaigner at the age of 10 - yes 10.</p>
<p>And he's here today because he believes in a Commonwealth where your life chances are defined by your ambitions and abilities, not by your background.</p>
<p>Al-Karim Khimji tells another extraordinary story.</p>
<p>He grew up in Canada and received vital skills and motivation from the Duke of Edinburgh's Award.</p>
<p>From there he took a very non-traditional path to work in micro-finance and development funding in Afghanistan and Egypt.</p>
<p>Al-Karim's high-achieving life has shown what young people can achieve when they have the chance to participate and engage.</p>
<p>I am also deeply inspired by a courageous young Indigenous woman from the great State of Western Australia, Madeline Anderson.</p>
<p>Growing up, Madeline saw first hand many of the issues affecting her community.</p>
<p>And she was inspired to develop a program that empowered young people to encourage their family members in breaking the cycle of poverty and disadvantage.</p>
<p>Today Madeline mentors young mothers completing their secondary education.</p>
<p>She also helps women who are affected by domestic violence and inspires them to develop into leaders in their communities.</p>
<p>Friends, these are stories of achievement.</p>
<p>Stories of hope.</p>
<p>And they reflect the boundless energy that exists in every corner of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>They also reflect the fact that half of the Commonwealth's population is under 25 years of age.</p>
<p>Never have so many young people been alive at one time in the history of the world.</p>
<p>And never have they been more interlinked.</p>
<p>Our world is already being remade by the combination of young people and social media.</p>
<p>Young people are demanding their freedoms.</p>
<p>They are refusing to accept old excuses and old limitations.</p>
<p>And they are determined to make a difference in their own lives and their own communities.</p>
<p>Because our world needs a difference to be made.</p>
<p>We are not succeeding as we should in meeting the great challenges of our time:</p>
<p>Global warming.</p>
<p>Food security.</p>
<p>Financial stability.</p>
<p>Poverty alleviation.</p>
<p>Women's rights.</p>
<p>Progress is too slow on all these things.</p>
<p>And young people have every right to feel a sense of urgency.</p>
<p>So be active.</p>
<p>Let your voice be heard.</p>
<p>And be informed by the values we hold dear as a Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Those defining values of fairness, democracy, equality and opportunity for all.</p>
<p>We call these Commonwealth values.</p>
<p>But in truth, they are human values.</p>
<p>Values that draw from us dreams of a better future; that draw us together in idealism.</p>
<p>At age 50, I am more idealistic than at any point in my life.</p>
<p>Yes, more realistic about the means to get there and the constraints along the way.</p>
<p>But no less idealistic about the brighter future that is within our grasp.</p>
<p>So be idealists.</p>
<p>Speak with passion and commitment.</p>
<p>Because you represent the future, and the success of that future depends on you.</p>
<p>Thank you all for making the journey to Perth.</p>
