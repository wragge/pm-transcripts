    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the Australian Government will contribute $100,000 to ANGLICARE Sydney to mark the welfare organisation's 150th anniversary. The Australian Government's donation will contribute to the establishment of a foundation for ANGLICARE Sydney's Street Outreach Program, which was established in 1991 to provide support for homeless youth, and youth at risk of becoming homeless, in Parramatta.</p>
<p>  For the past 150 years ANGLICARE has been tireless in the day-to-day support of disadvantaged Australians across the country.  ANGLICARE is a major provider of individual and family support, including emergency assistance for people in times of crisis, residential aged care services and migrant services.</p>
<p>ANGLICARE has also taken a leading role in helping to address youth homelessness.  This problem is a particular concern of ANGLICARE Sydney.</p>
<p>  ANGLICARE Sydney has worked with hundreds of young men and women, offering them support and assistance with finding shelter, and establishing new pathways to better relationships, education and vocation.  Without early intervention, youth homelessness can have serious and often life-long impacts on young people in terms of mental and physical health and marginalisation from society.</p>
<p>  I congratulate ANGLICARE on its 150th anniversary and I thank the organisation for its tremendous service to the Australian community.  </p>
