    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of the Government and people of Australia I extend to the President and people of the Republic of Indonesia our condolences on the passing of former Indonesian President Soeharto. </p>
<p>Former President Soeharto was one of the longest-serving heads of government of the last century and an influential figure in Australia's region and beyond. </p>
<p>He presided over the government of what is the world's fourth most populous country and its largest Islamic nation. </p>
<p>Until the catastrophic Asian financial crisis of 1997, he oversaw a period of significant economic growth and modernisation at a time when Indonesia faced fundamental political, social and economic challenges. </p>
<p>He was influential in the successful development of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (ASEAN) and of APEC.  </p>
<p>The former president was also a controversial figure in respect of human rights and East Timor and many have disagreed with his approach. Now the world's third largest democracy, Indonesia is a close friend and neighbour with which Australia shares vital political and security interests.</p>
<p>Indonesia's success as a modern democracy is a major interest not just to Australia, but to our region and the world.</p>
