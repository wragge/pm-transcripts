OPENING OF ARTS BUILDING, UNIVERSITY OF<br />
JESTERN AUSTRALIA, PERTH, W. A.<br />
29TH APRIL, 1964<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Mr, Chancellor, Mr. Dean, Mr. Court and Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
I see considerable changes since I was here last.<br />
On the last occasion, as you have been reminded, I opened a<br />
building belonging to what I suppose might be called the<br />
Students Union. I received a very merry reception ( Laughter)<br />
which I enjoyed, having led a few of them in my own time.<br />
Today I am astonished to find the docility of the<br />
students ( Laughter). They looked at us as we marched in here<br />
with absolute respect ( Laughter). Jeli, it appeared to be so.<br />
One or two almost had an appearance of veneration. ( Laughter)<br />
At least it appeared to be so, and so these changes come, but<br />
such is the fallibility of human memory that I ought to begin at<br />
once by saying that I declare this building open. ( Laughter)<br />
( Applause) You never know, I might do it again. It depends<br />
entirely on whether, having made a few brief remarks, I look<br />
around and my wife waggles an eyebrow at me to remind me that<br />
I really ought to do it twice. ( Laughter)<br />
Sir, it is a great pleasure to do this task because<br />
it is a great pleasure to visit this University. I have always<br />
had more than a sneaking idea that a university ought to be a<br />
place that has some beauty, some charm, something to remember,<br />
something more than a towering skyscraper as you see in some<br />
cities, something that has atmosphere, something that in due<br />
course will evoke memories, and I am bound to say that this<br />
university is enviable in those respects. I know that some of<br />
the new buildings are not, perhaps from one point of view, as<br />
beautiful as others but then I am an old-fashioned Tory on<br />
architectural matters. You see, I like this building; I think<br />
it is wonderful, and one of the fascinating things to me is my<br />
old friend, Professor Alexander, who has always masqueraded to<br />
me over many years as a species of bolshevik ( Laughter)<br />
( Applause) has been giving me from time to time broad hints<br />
in a very friendly way that it is time I saw the error of my<br />
ways, I'm delighted to find that at long last the wheel has<br />
turned full circle in his case ( Laughter) and that we both<br />
agree that this is a lovely building. So hero we are. This is<br />
a new act. ( Laughter) I can say that about him because he is<br />
an old friend of mine and I value his friendship and the fact<br />
that he is a friend of nine was one of the reasons that helped<br />
to persuade me to come over to perform this very pleasant task.<br />
Now, Sir, it will hardly be said about me, though<br />
I an the least scientific of mortals, that I am not interested<br />
in science, the teaching of science, the development of science,<br />
because when I look back on all the new science labs, that I<br />
have opened at schools and upon various things that my own<br />
government has been able to do, I realise that we have and<br />
have, shown some practical understanding of the importance of<br />
science, If I ever had a temptation to forget it then all I<br />
would need to do would be to look around and see the Universities<br />
Connission and see your representative on it, Professor Bayliss,<br />
helped by a bias in favour of this university ( Laughter).<br />
I wouldn't run any risk of not being aware of the importance<br />
of science, but I always come back to the tremendous importance<br />
in this world of the humanities. Now, I may have to say something / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
about this tonight; therefore I won't waste any powder and shot<br />
on it because you will all be there tonight ( Laughter) and you<br />
will have to listen to me a second time.<br />
But, Sir, an arts building, designed to further the<br />
study and understanding of the humanities, covering in its range<br />
languages, ancient and modern, literature, history, philosophy,<br />
all of these matters which are so easily forgotten in the modern<br />
world where a lot of very successful people profess a distaste for<br />
history. Indeed, wasn't it Henry Ford I who made that superb<br />
remark whichreverberated around the world " History is bunk".<br />
Well, that is one point cf view. It's a very poor point of view,<br />
because I happen to be one of those who believe that one of the<br />
first things, if you are to create a civilised man or woman, is<br />
to induce in him or her some knowledge of men, past as well as<br />
present, some knowledge of events, past as well as current,<br />
because if there is anything calculated to bring proportion to<br />
an otherwise educated r. ind, it is a knowledge of history, an<br />
understanding of it; not an understanding simply of those things<br />
that we used to have pushed into us when we wore very small<br />
boys a long list of dates, of kings and battles but an<br />
understanding of the great social development that has occurred<br />
right through history in one country and another.<br />
This is a necessary thing if we are to have a sense<br />
of proportion if we are not to be in all our controversies<br />
purely ad captandum as we too frequently are in the modern<br />
world. It is so important to learn, not just from machinery,<br />
from plant, from tust tubes important as all these things<br />
are you must do more than that. It is necessary to learn<br />
from men I will use " men" as including women for the sake<br />
of brevity to learn from men. ( Laughter) Yes, I know, I see<br />
the point you have made. Ihave known wcrenwhowere more long-winded<br />
than men; I have known men who were nore long-winded than women.<br />
It's a toss-up in the long run, but I will use " mon" as including<br />
women in the best statutory fashion. We must learn from r. en, we<br />
must learn from history, we must learn from literature.<br />
Do you know that I an frequently shocked to discover<br />
that there are r. en in the world of considerable scientific<br />
attainments who are, when it cones to expressing themselves in<br />
word or in writing, almost illiterate, and this is ridiculous,<br />
on the face of it. Who can be a great scientific discoverer<br />
unless he can convey to other people the nature of his discovery?<br />
Who can conduct scientific research work of real value to the<br />
people of the world unless he is able to explain it to other<br />
people? Who, indeed, in any avenue of life can reach the top<br />
nark unless he has the power of communication?<br />
I have known a number of men in my life which is<br />
now going on a number of rien of enormous distinction in some<br />
particular field, whether it was in the field of military<br />
activity or engineering or whatever it night be and when I found<br />
them to be in the very top flight I suddenly discoverd by<br />
contact with then that they had all these things the power to<br />
express themselves with clarity and lucidity and justice so that<br />
other people heard and understood and were prepared to follow.<br />
Now this is so true, isn't it? And it is a very great pity to<br />
find too many people, otherwise trer. ondously good at their<br />
particular specialty who make some stumbling explanation of it<br />
and who, when you put an enquiry say, " Well, anyhow, you know<br />
what I mean." Now, the great function of a department of arts is to<br />
produce balanced, educated, civilised people, not necessarily<br />
specialists in some field but people who, having achieved a broad<br />
e / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
cultivation of the mind, are capable of quick learning, of human<br />
understanding, of exposition and of objective judgment. This<br />
is what I believe the humanities to be concerned about, whether<br />
they achieve it through the teaching and study of literature, of<br />
history, of languages, of philosophy or whatever may be, in the<br />
broad curriculum. Now, Sir, it is a very interesting thing, I am sure,<br />
because my friend. Professor Bayliss, as a member of the<br />
Universities Commission, would bear this out, that although I<br />
many of us thought that with all the concentration of the public<br />
mind and headlines on physical sciences, on scientific discoveries,<br />
on technological developments, from the more simple forms up to<br />
sputniks and satellites I had thought that all this, by<br />
romanticising these matters, would produce a tremendous growing<br />
demand for space in the universities. Yet the fact is, so<br />
far as I know there may be one or two exceptions the<br />
restrictions on numbers going into the universities have needed<br />
to be on the humanities side not on the science side. There is<br />
a greater and growing demand on the humanities side so far than<br />
there is on the science side, at least that was so the last time<br />
I obtained some statistics about it.<br />
I wonder why that is. In other words, I permit<br />
myself, just for five minutes, to put the question to myself<br />
and to you: Why does this come about? Why is there such a<br />
demand on the arts courses? I think it is a very interesting<br />
question and I sat down the other day to ask myself whether I<br />
could think of the answers to it. Well of course, there was<br />
one, a cynical answer, quite easy, and that would be that arts<br />
subjects seem easier than scientific ones. That's a rather<br />
cynical proposal. I have known some people who I think might have, in<br />
a candid moment, said, " Yes, that will do me". You know, the<br />
mathematicians....... although, of course you have a school<br />
of mathematics in this department..... bu the mathematicians<br />
are a horror to ordinary unmathematical people. There is one<br />
thing I always thought about my colleagues who were great<br />
mathematicians and that is that they had a slight advantage,<br />
I might write a superb so I thought paper in English and<br />
get 85 marks out of 100 because it was all a matter of opinion.<br />
Same in history; same, with moderate concessions, in Latin<br />
( Laughter) but my mathematical colleagues, they got 100 or they<br />
got none. Well, I was almost among the none ( Laughter) and<br />
therefore a lot of people I think, may imagine that it is<br />
easier. I don't think here are too many who have that point<br />
of view. I suppose there are some people who take up the study<br />
of the humanities or some of then this certainly doesn't apply<br />
to the classics because they think they call for somewhat less<br />
precision of thought. And of course everybody here knows that<br />
any man who engages in precision of thought, even in my humble<br />
avocation, is always liable to be told that he is quibbling, that<br />
he is pedantic or that there is some other incurable disease which<br />
attaches to him. ( Laughter) And so there are quite a few people<br />
who say, " Well, I like a little bit of looseness of thought.<br />
I like a little bit of the broad sweep of humanity, old boy<br />
you understand me? ( Laughter) and therefore I think I might be<br />
attracted to become a Bachelor of Arts." Well, they are in a<br />
hopeless minority too and in today's world I would have thought<br />
a disappearing minority. </p>
<p>I have come to believe that there are very many<br />
people in the world parents as well as students, who<br />
instinctively react against what they feel to be a narrow<br />
specialisation, who instinctively react against the idea that<br />
a man should be educated for one specialty and for no other,<br />
whereas in fact, he ought to be educated to have a broad view<br />
of mankind, fitting him for a variety of occupations, because<br />
he has developed his mind before specialising in some technical<br />
matter. Now, there is a lot to be said for this, a groat<br />
deal to be said for this view. I always like to remember if<br />
there is one country in the world which, quite early in its<br />
history, established a tradition of scholarship, it was Scotland,<br />
where the ploughman's son was brought up, giving that he had<br />
intelligence, to believe that he was not just to be a ploughman,<br />
he was to learn something, he was to advance on the position<br />
of his father, and how many ploughmen's sons in Scotland went<br />
to Edinburgh or Glasgow and took degrees in arts, raising their<br />
educational horizon, raising their general mental capacity a<br />
tremendous number, a great tradition. And I suppose even in<br />
Scotland there were people by whom we are all plagued from<br />
time to time who said, " But this is useless learning. Why<br />
learn Latin?" ( I'm sorry I didn't learn it better myself) And<br />
if you replied, " Well, you will never really understand your<br />
own language unless you understand at least something about<br />
Latin," the answer is, " Oh, well, it's all right. It will do.<br />
People will know what I mean, they will know what I am getting<br />
at." This is really one of the important things in the world:<br />
to have a breadth of study,<br />
Now you look back in this century and some of us<br />
at least, have lived right through this century. There hasn'f<br />
been much deficiency, has there, in scientific exploration,<br />
not much deficiency in scientific growth, some glorious triumphs<br />
in the field of biochemistry and all these things that have to<br />
do with the preservation of life, some dramatic, amazing and<br />
sometimes horrible development in the great arts of destruction,<br />
but could anybody say that thetwentieth century has been marked<br />
by a growing understanding of human beings, by a better understanding<br />
by one nation of another, by a greater realisation that<br />
we are all human beings wherever we may be and that really all<br />
human things ought not to be alien to us? Has there been any<br />
adequate realisation of that? I venture to say not.<br />
I believe that in the second half of this century<br />
the proper study of mankind must be man in the true and vigorous<br />
sense if we are to avoid marrying the advance of science to<br />
constant or recurring human disasters. And that, Sir7 is why<br />
I believe in the hunanities, because they serve humanity, because<br />
they are vital to the survival of the human race, because in<br />
their very name, they serve two purposes the humanist, the<br />
purpose of the humanist, the purpose of the human being, living<br />
as a social being, wherever he nay be in the world.<br />
Now, Sir, this sounds awfully like a lecture on my<br />
part but I am provoked to do it on an occasion of this kind and<br />
before I open the building for the second timo ( Laughter), I<br />
want to explain to you that I have had to be on my best behaviour<br />
for today. I have had to give some rather shoddy imitation of<br />
being intelligent ( Laughter) because I an speaking to you today<br />
in the presence of two imen who have cost me and ny Government<br />
nore than any other non I know. ( Laughter) 1 </p>
<p>One of themlas over a long period of years disgorged<br />
Commonwealth grants on a scale sometimes terrifying, but still<br />
I am bound to admit he has never made a recommendation yet that<br />
we have rejected. And the other one, of course, I have already<br />
referred to the member of the Universities Commission.<br />
Dear me, I remember when Keith Murray came out. I got him, and<br />
I was in London and I borrowed him from Harold Macmillan and<br />
got him out and set him up with a first-class commission of<br />
enquiry and it was only when I had done all this that I was<br />
game to tell the then Treasurer what I was up to. ( Laughter)<br />
A bit of experience is not a bad guide on these matters<br />
and so I kept dark until I had the Committee established and<br />
then it went around and of course then it brought in its<br />
recommendations. Dear me, oh I read them and I gave instructions<br />
that they were to be circulated to Ministers on the<br />
morning of the Cabinet meeting. ( Laughter) I got them all to<br />
sit all day and at about midnight, I had a gene~ ral approval<br />
for the recommendations. And that is how it all began. When<br />
I look back on those modest beginnings -there were only about<br />
œ 3OM in recommendations in those days -and I look at what these<br />
boys do to me now well, every time I see Keith Murray<br />
w, if ch is occasionally fortunately, I say to him, " 4hat a mild,<br />
man you were". ( Laughtor)<br />
However, Sir, this building is one of the results<br />
and therefore, for the second time and I am like the character<br />
in " Alice" you know, and what I say twice is right ( Laughter)<br />
and so I say for the second time " I declare this building open"<br />
