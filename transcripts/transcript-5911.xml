AUST A<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 19 SEPTEMBER 1982<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
In the last week a number of things have happened which will.<br />
give Australians some encouragement that we can overcome<br />
our economic difficulties, And prepare for the world economic<br />
recovery when finally that comes.<br />
Last Friday the Conciliation and , Ar]; i. tr-ation Commission<br />
announced its recommendation that nearly all Commnonweal~ th<br />
public servants be granted pay increases of between about<br />
6% and 63 While the Government would have preferred the<br />
increase to have been smaller the increases awarded are<br />
about half of the increase sought by the unions. The fact<br />
that the Arbitration Commission took its decision in the--ight<br />
of current economic difficulties and that it has recogn. sed<br />
the need for wage restraint is most encouraging. It has<br />
also recognised the need for the public sector to give a lead<br />
in securing that restraint.<br />
There is a growing recognition not just in the Arbitration<br />
Commission but in the community as a whole that if we pay<br />
ourselves too much as we did last year, then the Australian<br />
economy will become less competitive, profits waill fall and<br />
our level of unemployment will rise still further. That growing<br />
recognition was apparent in earlier pay case decisions.. The<br />
Remuneration Tribunal recommended a pay increase for<br />
PDarliamentarians and senior public servants of a recommenrdation<br />
wVhich the Government accepted, and the Academic Salaries<br />
Tribunal has recommended a pay increase for academics of 7%.<br />
In Tasmania, a State particularly hard hit by the economic<br />
downturn, the Premier. has called for a public service<br />
pay freeze, while in Western Australian, South Australia and<br />
the Northern Territory, public servants have got increases<br />
of around In New South Wales Mr Wran last month, rejected<br />
a recommendation for a pay increase of 14.3% for his senior<br />
public servants. In doing this Mr Wran said: . it is essential<br />
that Governments exhort and practice wage restraint. The<br />
New South Wales Government takes the view that in the present<br />
exceptional economic climate a halt must be called to passing<br />
on cost of living increases as a full percentage of total wages."<br />
I completely agree with that statement and it shows that many<br />
membersof the Australian Labor Party, as well as other in the<br />
community, know that to revert to full wage indexa ' tion as the<br />
Labor Party's platform on industrial relations demands would<br />
only undermine our economy at this difficult time. / 2 </p>
<p>These recent pay settlements and in particular, Friday's<br />
recommendation on Commonwealth Public Servants' pay, show<br />
that most Australian governments, especially the Commonwealth<br />
Government, are setting an important example to the rest of<br />
the community. A number of leading companies have responded<br />
to the Government's call for restraint by either freezing<br />
salaries or granting very small salary increases to their<br />
executive staffs.<br />
Later this year there will be a number of important pay<br />
negotiations involving notably the metal workers, transport<br />
workers and the storemen and packers. Last year these unions<br />
got enormous pay increases and in. some cases shorter hours<br />
which not only undermined the competitiveness of those<br />
industries and therefore employment levels, but also set a<br />
benchmark which other unions were determined to equal.<br />
This year I am confident that last year's mistakes will be<br />
recognised and that unions will accept -the example set<br />
by the Commonwealth Government and. most State Governments in<br />
recent pay settlements. I am also confident that they will<br />
recognise the contribution the Commonwealth Government has<br />
made to helping all Australians at this difficult time through<br />
the recent Budget which will give considerable tax relief<br />
and increased benefits to all Australians.<br />
The strongest unions must realise that by acting selfishly<br />
without regard for those in the community who have little or<br />
no negotiating strength, people like pensioners and families with<br />
children to bring up, will be seriously damaged by excessive<br />
wage settlements. For its part, the Government will show<br />
absolute resolve to do all it possibly can to ensure that future<br />
wage settlements are not out of line with the pattern of settlements<br />
which have been emerging in recent months.<br />
Another positive sign in the economy in recent days has been<br />
the heavy fall in interest rates on Commonwealth Treasury<br />
bonds. These rates have fallen by about 14%. That decline is<br />
a reflection of lower interest rates overseas, in particular<br />
in the United States. Recent falls inanumber of private sector<br />
rates here in Australia and a growing confidence in the Australian<br />
economy as a result of the recent Budget.<br />
Although it is too early to conclude with complete confidence<br />
that overseas interest rates will contine to move downwards<br />
thereby bringing our own rates down further, this latest development<br />
is most welcome and will help further to rebuild confidence in<br />
our economy.<br />
These recent developments on wages and on interest~ rates are<br />
early signs that things will improve for all Australiians if<br />
international economic trends improve and if we continue to work<br />
together to restrain unrealistic wage settlements and are<br />
determined together to build Australia up.<br />
