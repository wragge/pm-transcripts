ST A<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS NOVEMBER 10,' 1976<br />
AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC SERVICE CO~ v1MISSIONERS CONFERENCE<br />
I understand that this is the first of these conferences of<br />
Austral asian-Public Service Commissioners to be hosted by<br />
the Australian Public Service Board for some time.<br />
I am informed that the conferences have been held on a<br />
regular basis since the first in Canberra in 1937.<br />
This is I2:-ressive record of co-operation.<br />
I am please-' to see delegates here from other countries in<br />
the region. Conferences of this kind are very useful exercises<br />
in inter-stza: e and regional co-operation. We recognise the.<br />
special duti-es which your organisations undertake and the special<br />
responsibilities you have.<br />
There is great value in the concept of independent central<br />
personnel authorities in our system of administration.<br />
Public Service Boards,' if they do their job properly, are<br />
not likely to be popular. They have the invidious task of<br />
restraining any tendency by individual departments or permanent<br />
heads to " empire-buildtThey also have the responsibility<br />
of preserving comparability of standards in a large and<br />
significant area of employment. Indeed it is no exaggeration<br />
to say that the well-being of public services in general<br />
depends greatly on the preservation of the independence and<br />
integrity of Public Service Boards and their equivalents.<br />
Public Service Boards do of course have an important responsibility<br />
to contribute to the improvement in the quality and efficiency<br />
of public administration.<br />
Consultations between members and senior officials of Public<br />
Service Boards from within Australia and overseas must facilitate<br />
a valuable exchange of information about ideas and trends in<br />
public administration.<br />
My Government is greatly concerned with issues of administrative<br />
management and public sector efficiency.<br />
Any Govern: nen:-is inevitably and properly faced with the limits<br />
of the rcs:_ _-7es available to it. / 2 </p>
<p>It is our aim to ensure that resources are related to<br />
need and are used to the fullest possible extent.<br />
The public sector has to be a lean and efficient<br />
instrument of Government policy, able to provide a<br />
responsive administration. Our decisions to reduce the<br />
size of the Australian Public Service are consistent with<br />
this obi! ective.<br />
We a-re al-1so concerned to press ahead with our policy of<br />
federalism which involves us examining the possibility<br />
of decene-ralising Government power and functions.<br />
In digso the Government relies to a very great degree<br />
on the efficiency, integrity and expertise of our Public Service<br />
at all levels. in rationalising the operations and-management<br />
of the bureaucracy and in facilitating the transfer of<br />
powers and functions between the Commonwealth and the states.<br />
While on the--a question of the size of the public sector it is<br />
notable tha_ t the state administrations have grown rapidly,<br />
as did zeCommonwealth Service, in recent years, and that<br />
there has, been a major expansion of state spending and<br />
state ac--fvity.<br />
The Government's policy of restraining growth in spending<br />
in the DU. Csector, as part of our overall strategy for<br />
manage~ men: of the Australian economy, clearly calls for<br />
complementary measures at the state level if it is to be<br />
fully successful.<br />
The Government is at the moment considering a number of issues<br />
in relation to Government administration issues which<br />
I am sure you will be discussing over the next few days.<br />
For instance, we have established machinery to examine the<br />
many recommendations of the Royal Commission on Australian<br />
Government Administration and will be progressively<br />
announcing decisions on those recommendations. The Royal<br />
Commission has produced a great deal the Government is<br />
closely examining present administrative practices and<br />
procedures in the light of the report.<br />
The consideration of the report by Ministers, Department,<br />
and the Public Service Board can in some ways be -regarded as<br />
a useful starting point for a wide-ranging examination of<br />
the efficiency and effectiveness of administrative procedures.<br />
Quite apart from the report of the Royal Commission, the<br />
Australian Public Service has been making progress on a<br />
wide-range of administrative issues.<br />
The Public Service Board's studies on manpower needs and the<br />
recently &gt; rdcdExecutive Development Scheme both cater<br />
for the n= eed to ensure that the administration continues to<br />
maintain high standards of policy advising and implementation.<br />
These ae-. aches are fully supported by this Government. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
We recognise the need for the encouragement of equal<br />
employment opportunities in the Public Service Board<br />
and fully endorse the efforts of the Public Service in<br />
this field.<br />
Proposals for staff exchanges between Commonwealth and<br />
State Departments, as well as with universities and<br />
business enterprises, are further means by which the skills<br />
and interests of staff can be developed and maintained.<br />
I understand that you will be discussing all these matters<br />
during the Conference and I trust that you will develop<br />
cooperative ventures in these areas.<br />
Mr Chairman, it gives me great pleasure to officially<br />
open the 20th Australiasian Public Service Commissioners'<br />
Conference and to extend a very warm welcome to all delegates<br />
and those wives who have accompanied them.<br />
I hope that you will find the Conference and its associated<br />
activities to be both stimulating and satisfying.<br />
To those guest from overseas, I would like to especially<br />
express a warm welcome and I hope your visit to Canberra will<br />
be a most enjoyable one. </p>
