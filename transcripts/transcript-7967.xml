FOR MEDIA 16 MARCH 1990<br />
In view of the misleading Statements made by the Coalition<br />
after my Campaign Launch on 8 March 1990 1 wish to make<br />
completely clear the funding basis for the new Co-operative<br />
Research Centres.<br />
This follows a letter to me from Professor Wicken, the<br />
President of the Federation of Australian Scientific and<br />
Technological Societies, expressing concern that this<br />
excellent initiative had been misrepresented by the<br />
Opposition, causing some confusion in the scientific<br />
community. A copy of Professor Wicken's letter is attached.<br />
I reiterate that:<br />
The scheme will be Introduced immediately upon our<br />
re-election and it is planned that the first 15 Centres<br />
will be established within the next 12 months.<br />
The Centres will be created by linking together<br />
outstanding research groups and providing additional<br />
resources. Facilities will be concentrated at the one<br />
location where possible. Where geographical<br />
co-location is not possible research consortia and<br />
networks could be established.<br />
The existing resources of staff, facilities and<br />
equipment will constitute the contribution of<br />
participating institutions. That combined contribution<br />
will be matched by new funds from the scheme. The<br />
participating institutions will not have to make their<br />
contribution in cash or by cutting back on existing<br />
activities.<br />
* The supplementary funds provided under the scheme will<br />
-L be flexible and may be used for staff salaries,<br />
buildings, equipment or research support.<br />
The total funds provided by the Government when all<br />
Centres are established will be $ 100 million per year.<br />
These funds are additional to existing funding<br />
arrangements and do not involve any offsetting savings<br />
from our appropriations to science or education. </p>
<p>2.<br />
I repeat that the establishment of the Centres will be the<br />
most significant step ever taken by a Commonwealth<br />
government to build on and draw together the strengths of<br />
Australian researchers.<br />
I am delighted by the enthusiastic response that the<br />
proposal has received from the science and technology<br />
community. </p>

Dsar Prime Minister,<br />
As you will be aware FASTS, long with other solentflo groups, has warmly<br />
supported your initiatives towards the establshment of Co-operative Research Centres<br />
by OSIRO, universities and the private sector. I am our You wUl be equally aware that<br />
the Coaldon's spokesperson for Sence, Peter Meauran, has ateoked the propoltion<br />
on the basis that t would take funds from the unIversites And CSIRO. The Mister for<br />
$ oleno, Barry Jones, did, test week, attempt some damage control, but I am finding<br />
that Mr, Mo3auran' press statements have created some confusion and oynlolsm In<br />
the olentdflo community. I believe that the Iuu eI of Such slonifliance that a<br />
statement from you bfotr the eleotion would be neonsary to allay the fears that I have<br />
desolbed. PAMTS would hate to ee this excellent Inliative founder through yet<br />
another variation at ' where's the money coming trom0<br />
I have also communicated these conoerns to the Chief Scientist, Professor<br />
Ralph Motor. Yours Federation of Australian Solentflo<br />
and Tsohnologloal Soceties. </p>
