SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINIISTER, MR. HAROLD HOLT 17th March, 1967.<br />
Senator Henty, Mrs. Henty Dr. Seamans and Mrs. Seamans,<br />
Mr. Buckley, any other distinguished guests here today and<br />
ladies and gentlemen and all associated with this great project:<br />
It is a personal pleasure for me for a variety of reasons<br />
to be here at this time if for no other reason than oecause, like<br />
you I am enjoying this bracing Canberra air and this beautiful<br />
Australian seting. At least, Dr. Seamans you will be able<br />
to report th-t Australia does live up to its' travel brochures<br />
as to its sunshine and the jeauty of its quite urique fauna and<br />
geography as you see it around us.<br />
It is not a very frequent occasion, of course for a<br />
Prime Minister to oe addressing himself to a matter of this kind.<br />
I have done so very rarely. Prime Ministers, if they are to<br />
succeed, are not so much concerned with outer space as keeping<br />
their feet firmly on the ground. Sometimes their onponents accuse<br />
them of oeing up in the air, even their most fervent admirers<br />
are not unkno,. n to say they are out of this world. So I come<br />
before you as one who addresses you with all the valour of<br />
ignorance on this rather esoteric are, of human activity which<br />
is exemplified for us in this rather awesome piece of equipment<br />
under which some of us at least are sheltering this morning.<br />
But it is a notale occasion in a chain of events which have<br />
had consideraole si nificance for Australia and which we hope are<br />
enabling Australia To play a useful and helpful part, not only<br />
in the space ' rogr-mme of the United States itself but in what<br />
has become one o? the happier ventures of mankind in which<br />
politics tend to be submerged and the aspirations of mankind<br />
the achievements of science, can be largely shared throughout<br />
the world. This particular tracking station, so auspiciously<br />
situated and so happily named I think Honeysuckle Tracking<br />
St-ition is a delightful name for an institution such as this.<br />
Attractive in rel-tion to almost any activity. If you were to<br />
come here Dr. Seamans, and say you were tracking square at<br />
Honeysuckle Creek there might be a different interpretation<br />
placed on your activities by Australians who would be familiar<br />
with that vernacular.<br />
iut here we have a new tracking station which is to<br />
play its own useful part in a great human -adventure. This<br />
venture into space is something which an older generation such<br />
as my ow-, n can scarcely comprehend. It's the stuff of science<br />
fiction, of space fiction of earlier times made reality in our<br />
own day and generation. And as , w reflect on these things it<br />
is fitting that w. e should give due tribute and regard to those<br />
pioneers in science down through the centuries, w o have made<br />
possible by their earlier adventures in the human mind and body,<br />
b the achievements of these pioneers of genius. They by their<br />
efforts have givn us the kind of instruments and the scientific<br />
method of experiment which makes this sort of achievement possible.<br />
I mentioned at the outset that it is a happy circumstance<br />
that t lose great powers who have interested themselves in this<br />
Particular area of human achievement, have aproached their<br />
tasks with the objective of oettering mankin s knowledge of its<br />
environment, and of contributing to peaceful purposes and to<br />
an improvement of man's standards of living. This vital<br />
aspiration is shared uy two great po'wers the United States<br />
of America and the Soviet Union, and with amazing technical / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
achievements to be put at the disposal of man's efforts to. shape<br />
his world for meeting his material needs and opening new doors<br />
to his understanding himself and the universe in which he lives,<br />
we owe much to these two great countries.<br />
The United States Aeronautics and Space Act became law<br />
on the 29th of July 1958, less than ten years ao. It was then<br />
stated, officially, as United States policy in That legislation,<br />
that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes<br />
for the benefit of mankind. In a modest way Australia had commenced<br />
to co-operate actively in the International Jeophysical Year in<br />
1957, by operating a tracking system known as Minitrack at Woomera,<br />
and now we have from that oeginning added Carnavon in iestern<br />
Australia Coby Creek in Queensland Voomera in South Australia,<br />
Tidbinbilla, Orroral Valley and now Honeysuckle Creek ( all of these<br />
last three in the The United States has financed the<br />
cost of construction, and by the end of the year the Space Authority<br />
will have spent more than 0100 million in Australia. You are used<br />
to juggling figures in billions, Dr. Seamans, but for Australia this<br />
is a considerable sum to ue spent inside the borders of our<br />
continent for these scientific purposes. The cost of operating<br />
the six Australian stations, apparently, is aoout 8-million dollars<br />
a year. There is an appropriateness, I think that Australia should<br />
be in the picture in this particular field, because Captain Cook's<br />
own voyage of exploration which led to the settlement of Australia,<br />
was made on oehalf of the Royal Society to ouserve a transit of<br />
Venus across the sun almost two hundred years ago. So we feel<br />
that we are appropriately placed to be playing a part now in<br />
another great exploration, that of space.<br />
We have been associated with the United States programme<br />
since its early days as the illustration I gave earlier would<br />
su gest. For nearly ten years now we have joined in facilitating<br />
American space activities. . e have helped to select sites and<br />
construct stations in Australia and their manning includes scientists<br />
and technologists from the Department of Supply and Australian<br />
industry atogether some seven hundred persons from these sources.<br />
The Australian government purchased and made available to the<br />
Space Authority nine hundred acres of freehold land for this<br />
present station. A practicable contribution to the space programme<br />
itself. This station is directly concerned with Project Apollo<br />
which will launch into space three manned capsules as a part of<br />
an experiment which will culminate in a voyage of some three<br />
days duration to the moon, 250,000 miles away. The Australian<br />
group of stations represent the largest complex of Space Authority<br />
stations outside the United States. I think I am correct in saying,<br />
Dr. Seamans, that in the Apollo Pro ect there will be three<br />
tracking stations which will oe following the course of the moon<br />
vehicle oeyond the 10,000 mile limit. One in the United States,<br />
one in Spain and this one here in Australia. And I think we can<br />
feel gratified and take some pride, indeed satisfaction, that in<br />
what proves to be one of the great historic events of man's<br />
exploration of his universe we shall be one of the three countries<br />
right in the picture, literally, so far as the concluding phases<br />
of the flight are concerned.<br />
Some people wonder whether all this vast expenditure that<br />
goes into the space programmes can oe justified. The answers are<br />
not difficult to find. Already we hive peen deriving Yreat oenefits<br />
from the programme of space adventure. If you take meleorology<br />
alone, and there is not a human oeing on earth who isn't daily<br />
concerned with the state of the weather. It is our most familiar<br />
personal greeting when we see each other in the course of the day. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
-eather can now be viewed on a global scale several times a day.<br />
This can be done regularly in regions of the earth which have<br />
previously defied around-the-clock meteorolofical o* servation.<br />
The poles, the oceans, the sparse areas of the Southern Hemisphere<br />
have now ueen brought into the range of . eather forecasting.<br />
and this also has an aspect which could commend itself to all<br />
of us in enabling us to avoid the worst effects of the havoc of<br />
hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons.<br />
For exa: iple, in 1961 quite early in the programme people<br />
were evapuated from the path of Hurricane Carla as a result of<br />
warnin? data received from the Tvros Satellite. In navigation<br />
satellites can play a helpful role. In international communication<br />
we have already received the first telecast between Britain and<br />
Australia. , e are but at the beginnings of this improvement in<br />
communication, and before we are all very much older the world can<br />
be in television contact as a normal and everyday event.<br />
There has been a notaole contribution to the knowled e of<br />
eography the study of geology. Our understanding is assisted<br />
by the information we receive from the special satellites designed<br />
and equipped for these purposes.<br />
Man's superior ability to explore and record details will<br />
provide valuable information as to measurements, direct photoraphs,<br />
soil and rock samples, a vast array, in short of scientific data.<br />
The initial landing on the moon proposed by 1970, may lead to<br />
longer journeys and wider exploration and culminate in the<br />
establishment of a permanent moon oase. A project which a few, yearj<br />
ago ; ould have been thought quite fanciful even if it were to appear<br />
in the realm of fiction.<br />
There have been other oenefits, already directly attributable<br />
to the space exploration efforts. 4reat advarces in materials such<br />
as ceramics, metals and plastics. Metal alloys specially developed<br />
have led to improvements. For example, they have been found ideal<br />
for the manufacture of artificial parts for the human oody, such<br />
necessary assistance to hip and elbow joints. Special knowledge<br />
of foods developed for astronauts may help the world in its search<br />
for the solution of food problems.<br />
For Australia we have a growin:-numuer of men and women<br />
technically trained to handle complicated concepts and the<br />
complicated equipment associated with space technology. Australia<br />
has found already many benefits to its own technological<br />
development. It may interest you to know that last month Qantas,<br />
with the co-operation of the tracking station at Cooby Creek<br />
experimented in air-to-ground voice communication ob satellite<br />
with encouraging results.<br />
foankind needs the incentive of space exploration in order<br />
to develop to full potential some of these great possibilities.<br />
This vast spurt of human imagination and technological progress<br />
is opening ne'; doors to experience and achievement. It carries<br />
with it at first its own hazards. Fortunately disasters have been<br />
few but we should all rememoer here today the sacrifice made by<br />
Jrissom, White and Chaffey as they were playing their part in this<br />
scientific evolution.<br />
ye welcomed here, and some of us in this gathering will<br />
no doubt recall with -reat pleasure the visit of a-. lter Schiirar<br />
and Frank 3orman and their wives. We nay tribute to the courae,<br />
skill and determination of these brave pioneers of tomorrow, who<br />
make it possible for us to realise the aspirations of this great<br />
verture. Finally, ladies mnd gentlemen, may I refer to this as / 4<br />
L </p>
<p>-4-<br />
another welcome illustration of the friendly and mutually helpful<br />
teamwork which over the years, and more particularly over recent<br />
years, has been demonstrated oetween the United States of America,<br />
our great ally, and our own country of Australia. This stands as<br />
a symbol for that firendship and for that teamwork and an alliance<br />
which, we hope, will endure for as long as our two countries remain<br />
national entities.<br />
So, as I open formally this tracking station and have with<br />
you a vision of what it can contribute to this protramme in the<br />
future, may I adopt the words of Tennyson as a fitling conclusion:<br />
" Forward, forward,<br />
Let us range<br />
Let the great world spin forever<br />
Down the ringing grooves of change."<br />
I declare this station formally open. </p>
