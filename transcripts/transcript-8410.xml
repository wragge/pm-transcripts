ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
BATTLE OF AUSTRALIA COMMEMORATION SERVICE<br />
BICENTENNIAL PARK, DARWIN, 19 FEBRUARY 1992<br />
Today we pay tribute to those who died here in Darwin in<br />
1942 Australians and Americans who gave their lives in the<br />
defence of this country and freedom everywhere.<br />
The raids on Darwin, the loss of life, the great destruction<br />
of this and other northern communities, the tragedies of so<br />
many Territorians forcibly expatriated from their homes<br />
these things we Australians have not properly acknowledged.<br />
Today we acknowledge them.<br />
Today we pay tribute to their courage, and recognise the<br />
debt we owe to the people of Northern Australia.<br />
No nation should fail to honour those who have given it<br />
devoted serviLce. No nation should forget its past.<br />
This and subsequent raids on Australia's northern ports were<br />
acts of unwarranted aggression, yet it has to be said that<br />
there were worse-actions during the Asia-Pacific War.<br />
The Japanese conquest and occupation of the region involved<br />
unspeakable suffering for large parts of the population, and<br />
for Allied prisoners of war, including many thousands of<br />
Australians. These events cannot and should not be forgotten.<br />
Indeed, among the countries of the region a common awareness<br />
of the history we share will strengthen the basis of' trust<br />
and cooperation in our relations.<br />
In Japan's case, more candid recognition of responsibility<br />
for past actions will enhance the wider acceptance and<br />
legitimacy of its emerging leadership role in the Asia-<br />
Pacific region. </p>
<p>Yet we would certainly be wrong to think that only Japan has<br />
lessons to learn from those events fifty years ago.<br />
The attack on Darwin was a striking symbol of the<br />
uncertainty of our position in the region.<br />
It was also unmistakeable proof of the inadequacy of our<br />
responses. Fifty years later, of course, there are still<br />
lessons to be learned.<br />
A lesson in strength and independence of mind, for instance.<br />
We might remember the folly of relying so totally, for both<br />
policy and defence, on Great Britain.<br />
Increasingly we had been living in a fantasy land of an<br />
exhausted Empire. We treated Asia with a mixture of<br />
condescension and fear or worse, we ignored it altogether.<br />
Yet there is a positive lesson to be learned as well we<br />
adapted. Australians, accustomed to regarding themselves as<br />
British, resolved to turn to the one country that could save<br />
the day without prejudice to their British origins they<br />
forged a friendship with the United States which endures to<br />
this day.<br />
It will do us no harm to reflect on the virtues of changing<br />
old preconceptions and being ready and willing to respond to<br />
new realities.<br />
To the generation of 1942 it was quite unthinkable that we<br />
might voluntarily become a part of Asia. That we might ever<br />
be friends with Japan was entirely out of the question.<br />
Yet we have made those changes. We have built friendships,<br />
trust and understanding. We are playing a creative role in<br />
the region, and the opportunity is there to expand that<br />
role.<br />
The bombing of Darwin was a tragedy. But it was also an<br />
awakening. And there is no doubt that we have learned from<br />
the experience.<br />
Yet there is much more to learn, and a good deal of it, I<br />
think, concerns our own society, our own attitudes.<br />
I<br />
It is significant, for instance, that it took 49 years for<br />
an Australian government to recognise the role that<br />
Aboriginal people played in the defence of Australia.<br />
During the war, groups of Aboriginals, including special<br />
Army units, patrolled areas which spanned almost the entire<br />
Arnhem Land coast. They were involved in the rescue of<br />
Allied airmen and the capture of enemy airmen. </p>
<p>Yet they received very little recognition and until last<br />
year little or no remuneration for their services.<br />
I am very glad that on this 50th anniversary we can at last<br />
pay tribute to all those Australians who served their<br />
country. The bombing of Darwin brought home to us how isolated and<br />
vulnerable so much of Australia was how difficult it was<br />
to make and defend a nation on such a vast continent.<br />
Today we might remind ourselves that we will do that so much<br />
better if we include in all our national goals, and all our<br />
national pride all our people.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, in the hour of peril in 1942<br />
Australians responded as you would expect a free people to<br />
respond they found in themselves and each other untapped<br />
resources of strength and purpose.<br />
They learned the value of cooperation.<br />
They made an all-in, national effort.<br />
Today there is, of course, much to learn from that as well.<br />
We must find in ourselves that same resolve and spirit which<br />
helped to turn the tide.<br />
If we do this we will be able to speak to the world about<br />
those things which Australia cherishes about freedom and<br />
fairness, about tolerance, and independence we will be<br />
able to have some influence, we will be able to pay our own<br />
way and we will be able to say that the memory of those<br />
people who died here in Darwin has been truly honoured. I<br />
