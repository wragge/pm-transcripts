FOR MEDIA 14 JUNE 1979<br />
GREAT BARRIER REEF<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser and the Premier,<br />
Mr Joh Bjelke-Petersen, conferred today on the future<br />
consultative arrangements for joint consideration of<br />
recom-mendations of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park<br />
Authority. This Authority is established by the Commonwealth<br />
Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act, which will continue<br />
unchanged. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is designed to<br />
provide for the progressive declarations and oversight of<br />
Marine Parks in the Region of the Great Barrier Reef. The<br />
boundaries of this Region will remain as defined in the<br />
Corroonwealth legislation.<br />
No provision has to date been made for both governments to<br />
co-ordinate policy at the ministerial level. Accordingly,<br />
it was agreed at today's meeting to establish a Ministerial<br />
Council comprising Commonwealth and State Ministers particularly<br />
representing marine park, conservation, science and tourism.<br />
The Commonwealth Ministers will be Phillip Lynch, the Minister<br />
for Industry and Commerce, whose portfolio responsibilities<br />
include tourism a major activity in the area of the<br />
Great Barrier Reef and Senator Webster, the Minister for<br />
Science and the Environment who is directly responsible for<br />
the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.<br />
The Queensland Ministers will be Mr Newberry, the Minister for<br />
Culture, National Parks and Recreation, and Mr Hodges, the<br />
Minister for Maritime Services and Tourism.<br />
Mr Fraser and Mr Bjelke-Petersen agreed that the first section<br />
of t-h_ Great Barrier Reef Marine Park the Capricornia<br />
secticn should be processed by the Ministerial Council as<br />
an L74Tediate task to enable-early proclamation to take place.<br />
They also agreed that as the sections of the Great Barrier<br />
Reef Marine Park are procliamed, the day-to-day management<br />
should be undertaken by officers of the Queensland National<br />
Parks and Wildlife Service, who, in discharging these<br />
responsibilities, will be subject to the Great Barrier Reef<br />
Marine Park Authority. The Authority will continue to have<br />
the responsibility for:<br />
recommending the declaration of Parks; / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
developing zoning plans and plans of<br />
management of Parks; and<br />
arranging for research and investigation<br />
relevant to Marine Parks.<br />
In relation to the Territorial sea, the Premier and the<br />
Prime Minister agreed that the arrangements with Queensland<br />
which will flow from the agreements of the June 1978 Premiers'<br />
Conference will be on the same basis as arrangements to be<br />
entered into in respect of other States, but with full<br />
regard to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act and to the<br />
Prime Minister's Parliamentary Statement of 4 June on<br />
Petroleum Exploration in the Great Barrier Reef.<br />
Both the Premier and the Prime Minister confirmed that it was<br />
the policies of their respective governments to prohibit any<br />
drilling on the Reef or any drilling or mnining which could<br />
damage the Reef.<br />
Mr Bjelke-Petersen and Mr Fraser agreed that -the program of<br />
short and longer termn research into the Great Barrier Reef<br />
eco-system referred to in that Statement will be monitored<br />
by the Ministerial Council, and will be closely supervised<br />
by -the Marine Park AuthoriLty.<br />
By creating an appropriate consultative mechanism these<br />
arrangements will serve to ensure that the Authority functions<br />
within the framework of the joint policies of the Commonwealth<br />
and Queensland Governments as they further develop.<br />
The two Governments will be consulting forthwith on implementation<br />
of these arrangements.<br />
Both the Premier and the Prime Minister affirmed that the<br />
basic policy intention of both governments was to ensure that<br />
the Great Barrier Reef area be recognised and preserved<br />
as an important feature of Queensland's and Australia's<br />
heritage. </p>
