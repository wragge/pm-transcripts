<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, a good [inaudible] Young Australian of the Year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Absolutely fantastic.  Wouldn't have liked to have been a judge.  It would have been very hard.  But I know it might sound like a clichâ€š to say it but it really isn't.  An occasion like this is totally inspirational because it shows an utterly positive side of young Australia and it shows what enormous reservoirs of talent and commitment and decency there are amongst young Australians and I found it quite inspiring.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you think stood James apart from the rest..?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look I don't want to get into comparisons.  He's a terrific choice.  They were all good and in all of these things there can only be one winner.  But his acceptance speech showed the quality of the man, but all of them were fantastic and it was a great inspiration and delight to be involved in the occasion.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And great inflation result today for government?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Great for the country.  It's what matters for Australia that's important in these things and it is a very good result for Australia.  It is an excellent result for Australia.  It shows that inflation is under control, it shows that the inflationary impact of the GST was no where near as great as even we thought it might be, and it is just very good news for our country and that's what matters.</p>
