FOR PRESS: P. M. 24/ 1263<br />
RESTRICTIVE TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION<br />
Statement-by the Pme Minister. the Rt. Hon, Sir RobertI1enzes<br />
Hysterical statements by the Leader of the<br />
Opposition, Mr. Calwell, such as his comment on my address to<br />
the Dinner of the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures, serve<br />
only to exhibit his over-excited state of mind.<br />
It was made quite clear, when the first statement<br />
was made on restrictive practices policy in the House of<br />
Representatives, that it was a general description of the kind<br />
of ideas the Government had. That statement was deliberately<br />
designed and timed to give ample opportunity for criticism and<br />
discussion before a bill was drafted for consideration by the<br />
Parliament. Sir Garfield Barwick, the Attorney-Gencral, has<br />
himself carried out this idea with enormous vigour. He has met<br />
organisations and groups of people in every State to 01-icit and<br />
discuss points of criticism, so that the Government might have<br />
them in mind before proceeding to the actual work of precise<br />
dra ftsmans hip. W4hen we recently saw the representatives of the<br />
Manufacturing Industries Advisory Council which, I should<br />
point out, is a standing body set up by the Government to give<br />
it advice those present for the Governnent were the Minister<br />
for Trade, Mr, McEwen, the Treasurer, Mr. Holt, the Minister<br />
for National Developmenu;, Sir William Spooner, the Att%, orney-<br />
Genra, Sir Garfield Barwick, the Minister for Primary<br />
Industry, Mr. Adermann, and myself, We all thought ti1iat the<br />
views presented on behalf of the M. I. A. C.-on the precise nature<br />
of which neither the Government nor the Council has made any<br />
statement were the most balanced and constructive tihat we<br />
had had presented to us. We will undoubtedly find them of great<br />
advantage to us in considering what the final shape of the<br />
legislation should be, As I said in Sydney, I regard this<br />
kind of consultation as of great value in clarifying issues<br />
and helping to achieve a sound and positive result.<br />
In the light of the foregoing it is quite clear<br />
that Mr. Calwellts strange attempt to suggest that Sir Garfield<br />
Barwick has been in some way rebuffed is the product of pure<br />
imagination; or at any rate of imagination.<br />
All Ministers had a hand in designing the<br />
original general statement and all will have a hand in the final<br />
outcome. I repeat that nobody has done half as much in<br />
this matter as has Sir Garfield in seeking out the points of<br />
criticism and in trying to achieve ultimately a result which<br />
will be sensible and fair to the community as a whole.<br />
CANBERRA September, 1963. </p>
