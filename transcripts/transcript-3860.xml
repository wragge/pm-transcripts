SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON E. G. WHITLAM4, M. P.,<br />
AT THE WOMEN AND HEALTH CONFERENCE,.<br />
BRISBANE, 25 August 1975<br />
one of the regular activities of the United<br />
Nations is to designate a" Ayear to focus attention upon<br />
a particular topic, to create an awareness of a*<br />
particular problem. With this end in view the United<br />
Nations proclaimed 1975 as International Wlomens Year<br />
in order to recognise the important contribution which<br />
women have made to the social, political, economic and<br />
cultural life of their countries and to intensify the<br />
action required to advance the status of women.<br />
For the first time an Australian government<br />
has * committed itself to an extensive program designed<br />
to achieve the aims of the year. Our reasons for so*<br />
doing are two-fold. First, the government recognises<br />
the importance of the United Nations and its activities,'<br />
in the area of human-rights as well as in other areas.<br />
Secondly, the government has shown its awareness of<br />
the problems which face women in our society today and<br />
its commitment to attempting to overcome them.<br />
Within the context of the United Nations<br />
objectives for the year equality, development and<br />
peace Australia has formulated three overall objectives<br />
for our International Women's Year program. The most<br />
important of these objectives is the need to reassess<br />
and change those attitudes towards women which are<br />
harmful and limiting. Together with this, the areas of<br />
discrimination against women in our society must be<br />
identified and a concerted att-empt made to overcome them.<br />
It is also intended that the year be a joyous one emphasising<br />
the creative and positive in women.<br />
It has been of basic concern to us that in " the<br />
course of this year we reach most if not all women in<br />
Australia. There are certain areas which affect, or<br />
potentially affect, every girl and woman in our society,.<br />
whatever her education, her cultural background, her<br />
economic status, her beliefs, her occupation or her way<br />
of life. The health of women is clearly one of the most<br />
impbortant of these areas and the Australian National<br />
Advisory Committee for the year has given it high priority.<br />
Primary emphasis has been-placed on the need to give<br />
women a better understanding of their bodies and of the<br />
many diseases and disorders from which women suffer at one<br />
time or another in their lives. Research in this area<br />
is quite inadequate and until recently no attempt had<br />
been made by governments to provide for these needs. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
A' great deal more needs to be known about the health<br />
of women, the causes of their health problems, and the<br />
correct treatment for them.<br />
Health conferences are a regular feature of<br />
the Australian scene but this is the first conference in<br />
Australia, and probably in the world, which has dealt<br />
exclusively with women's health.<br />
Health conferences are normally restricted to<br />
professional people and when they do involve " nonprofessiondls"<br />
they are restricted to one particular<br />
aspect of health. This conference is being attendedby<br />
people with widely varying backgrounds who have<br />
themselves decided the program's contents. This is<br />
yet another innovative and most important feature of<br />
the conference. It is obvious from the response to this<br />
conference that many people are concerned about women' s<br />
health needs in our changing society and many women<br />
are themselves becoming increasingly concerned that<br />
these needs be seriously and adequately considered.<br />
There is much to be learnt.<br />
It is appropriate for me to pay tribute to the<br />
Department of Health which in conjunction with the<br />
National Advisory Committee has organized this conference<br />
as its special project for the year. Each government<br />
department and agency was asked to develop a program and<br />
initiate special activities during 1975. The Institute<br />
of Criminology, for example, also in'conjunction with.<br />
the National Advisory Committee has already held two<br />
seminars, one on women as victims of crime, and one on<br />
the participation of women in the criminal justice system..<br />
Further, this conference is the first of three<br />
extremely important conferences each of which is concerned<br />
with issues of fundamental irnoortance to each woman<br />
and man in our society. The next conference, which<br />
begins next week in Canberra, is on Women and Politics.<br />
Its-aim is to create an increasing political awareness<br />
amongst women and to give women the knowledge necessary<br />
for them to bring about the policies, programs and other.<br />
changes which they so justly are demanding and so truly<br />
need. Australia is also to host a United Nations<br />
interregional conference in November on Women, the Media<br />
and the Arts: the Communication ofL Attitudles. This.<br />
conrerence will loo at tne way women are portrayed .1in all..<br />
forms of communication, be it advertising, daily papers,<br />
art, pop songs, Jokes, or literature. We are all well<br />
aware that too often quite unrealistic and even damaging<br />
images of women are communicated to us through these<br />
media and these images in turn reinforce already existing<br />
assemptions which limit and distort the capacities,<br />
potential and life patterns of women and girls.<br />
In the field of women's health the most significant<br />
initiative taken by the g-overnment has been the funding<br />
* of the Leichhardt Women's Community Health Centre. The<br />
aim of this centre is to meet a need expressed by women<br />
for a health service staffed by women and directed solely<br />
towards the special health needs of women. The proposal </p>
<p>3-<br />
put to the Minister for Health by a group of Sydney women<br />
received immediate attention. It was endorsed by the Hospitals<br />
and Health Services Commission and an initial grant of $ 33,000<br />
to establish the health centre was announced by the Minister.<br />
The centre makes an annual application for funds to continue<br />
and expand its operations. So far it has received a total<br />
of $ 285,735. Since then the government has funded a number of<br />
further such centres under the Community Health Program.<br />
Submissions for women's comtmunity health centres have been<br />
put before the Hospitals and Health Services Commission.<br />
The Commission has supported the establishment of<br />
women's health centres in the belief that such action is not<br />
only necessary in itself but would help to influence the traditi(<br />
health care system to cope more adequately and effectively with<br />
women's health problems. The Australian government is, as far<br />
as I know, the only government in the world that has listened<br />
and responded to such requests from women.<br />
Four centres are fully operational ( Leichhardt,<br />
Liverpool, Melbourne Perth); two centres are part-operational<br />
( Adelaide and Newcastle) and one, the Brisbane Women's<br />
Community Aid Association, has still to find premises.<br />
We are also funding women's refuges and'shelters. The<br />
concept of the refuge has grown out of a response to the<br />
desperate plight of many women. A women's refuge is a place<br />
for a woman, with or without children,. to go when she has nowherE<br />
else; she may be destitute or confused or needing to escape<br />
her existing situation.<br />
On 19 June, the Australian Minister for Health, Dr<br />
Everinghamn, announced a national plan aimed at helping women in<br />
social and domestic crisis situations. Through the Community<br />
Health Program, women's refuges in all states will receive<br />
Australian government funds to pay-for staff, rent, renovation<br />
of premises, equipment, food and other operating costs. Dr<br />
Everingham said 11 organisations would receive a total of<br />
$ 211,885 under the plan.<br />
Refuges have been approved for immediate assistance<br />
in Brisbane, Townsville, Glebe, Marrickville, Liverpool,<br />
Ringwood/ Croydon, Hobart, Launceston, Adelaide and Perth.'<br />
There are now women's refuges in every state and in<br />
the Australian Capital Territory. Perhaps the best known in the<br />
Sydney refuge, Elsie, the first women's refuge to open in<br />
Australia, which has been operating since March 1974.<br />
Many projects relating to the health and welfare of<br />
women have also been funded by the government on the advice<br />
of the National AdvisoryCommittee for International<br />
Women's Year. These have included the production of a<br />
film on cystitis, a conference on Women and Madness. a<br />
counselling service for parents who have feelings of<br />
violence towards their children, a research project on<br />
the difficulties encountered by women who have responsibility<br />
for aged parents or other dependents, a project into the </p>
<p>-4-<br />
incidence and seriousness of violence to women, the<br />
publication of a booklet giving accurate information on the<br />
availability of and techniques used for legal abortions<br />
and associated contraceptive matters, research on the<br />
particular problems of disabled women and the publication<br />
of research into women medical graduates. We have also<br />
invested in a television series on human reproduction<br />
in the belief that no area of human behaviour is more<br />
private and more sacred whilst at the same time having<br />
ineluctable public consequences. The. insights to be gained<br />
from such a series are not only important globally, a<br />
. necessary precondition to a rational understanding of issues<br />
relating to population and the future development of<br />
societies, but are of deep importance to every individual,<br />
for it is a woman's reproductive capacity which basically<br />
distinguishes her from man. All funding relating to the<br />
health of women, as in all other areas, has been within<br />
the guidelines which I tabled in Parliament in December<br />
last year. It is the government's policy that all persons<br />
should have ready access to family planning advice so<br />
that they may achieve the number and spacing of children<br />
they desire. It is also our policy that women should<br />
have access to all the knowledge required to enable them<br />
to make informed decisions in this area. The broad<br />
objective is improvement of the quality of life for both<br />
parents and children.<br />
The Australian government has taken steps towards<br />
the evolution of a national policy on family planning.<br />
In 1973/ 74 $ 300,000 was expended and in 1974/ 75 well over<br />
million was allocated to this program. We also appointed<br />
a consultant in family planning, Dr Stephania Seidlecky, who<br />
had previously been on the staff of the Leichhardt Women's<br />
Community Health Centre. Dr Seidlecky has already made<br />
many valuable contributions to the family planning program.<br />
There is at present no separate policy on women's<br />
health in Australia. Women's health needs are subsumed<br />
under policies relting to community and mental health,<br />
rural health, aboriginal health, rehabilitation and<br />
hospitals. There is, however, an historical exception,<br />
namely hospitals run by women for women as well as the<br />
more recent evolution of women's health centres and refuges.<br />
It was an understanding of the pressing need for<br />
health services relating directly to the health problems<br />
of women which gave birth in 1899 to the Queen Victoria<br />
Hospital in Melbourne and in 1922 the Rachel Forster<br />
Hospital in Sydney, hospitals staffed by and run for<br />
women. In recent years dissatisfaction with prevalent<br />
attitudes to women's health problems and the paucity of<br />
research into their causes and into their correct treatment<br />
have led to the establishment of womens community health<br />
centres. These centres have invariably been established<br />
by groups of women who, having seen a desperate need<br />
amongst women, be it for health care, shelter or rape crisis<br />
counselling, have voluntarily set about to find a solution.<br />
As well as helping to identify the health needs of </p>
<p>of women, there is one very important question which this<br />
conference should discuss. This is whether or not<br />
women's health needs should be integrated -throughout the<br />
various components of the health service system, as is<br />
at present proposed, or whether they should be separately<br />
considered, as is, for example, aboriginal health.<br />
The very concept of women's health is a troublesom'e<br />
one. it brings to mind those problems or illnesses that<br />
are associated with women: reproduction, suburban<br />
neurosis, valium-dependency, psychotic, disorders and so on.<br />
The concept of men's health jars for noL only does it<br />
not evoke any similar associations with men's illnesses,<br />
but it is no more and no less than the concept of health<br />
itself. In this time of change and of questioning it is<br />
more and more frequently poiLnted out that the seemingly<br />
infinite range of women's skills, abilities and interests<br />
are channelled into too few and limiting roles and that<br />
this causes a great deal of human unhappiness, misery and<br />
distress. This is a difficult claim to gauge but some light<br />
can be thrown on it by looking at phenomena such as<br />
successful and attempted suicide, psychiatric conditions<br />
and drug dependencies. Male suicide rates in Australia have remained<br />
remarkably constant since the 1870' s, as did female rates<br />
from 1870 to 1950, but since then the rate amongst. women<br />
has doubled. This increase has produced an overall suicide<br />
rate in Australia that is one of the highest in the world.<br />
This substantial increase in the suicide rate, particularly<br />
* amongst women over the age of 25, is linked with increased<br />
availability of sedative preparations and subsequent<br />
overdose. There has also been a two-or three-fold increase<br />
in attempted suicides, with twice as many women as men<br />
being treated for this.<br />
Further, there is an increasing incidence of<br />
psychiatric illness amongst women, with the two most common<br />
psychiatric diagnoses depressive states and psychiatric.<br />
neuroses being more common in women than men. Depressive<br />
states are most. co-mmon in women in their thirties, and<br />
psychiatric neuroses most co: mmron in women in their f ' ifties.<br />
More significantly they are twice as common in marri-id as<br />
in single women. Almost three timres as many married'as<br />
single women show severe neurotic symptoms, twice as many<br />
married women as married men have felt that a nervous<br />
breakdown was impending, and many mo e women than men<br />
experience psychological anxiety.<br />
over 10% of women in Australia are dependent on<br />
headache or sleeping pills. About 4 million prescriptions<br />
for valium. are made out each year, the majority of these<br />
prescriptions being written out for women. The abuse of<br />
pain killers can be blamed for about 20% of kidney breakdowns<br />
and again more women than men are so affected. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
These survey results taken together seem to indicate<br />
clearly an increasing distress in Australian women. They<br />
must however be interpreted cautiously for there is another<br />
phenomenon which could well have affected these results.<br />
It is also true in our society that men's lives are<br />
harmed by the limited range of roles and behaviour patterns<br />
which they are allowed. Many of these findings could be<br />
inaccurate because men are less likely than women to admit<br />
to psychological symptoms or to seek help from doctors,<br />
for this could well be seen as weak or' dependent<br />
behaviour and these are the characteristics that our<br />
society allows to women but not to men. Men suffer from<br />
what could well be called the Colonel Glenn syndrome.<br />
It is clear that ours is'a society in which the<br />
quite different expectations about what each sex should<br />
be like and how it should behave or think have become<br />
deeply embodied in its total culture. Anatomy has<br />
become destiny just because anatomical differences at<br />
birth determine which way we are taught to think or behave.<br />
Women are assumed to be naturally emotional, dependent,<br />
easily influenced, cunning s! nsitive, submissive, indecisive<br />
and lacking ambition; men to be naturally logical,<br />
aggressive, independent, objective, direct, decisive,<br />
self confident, and unemotional. These images of women<br />
and men are constantly, daily, reinforced within our<br />
society. Indeed they are constantly and daily reinforced<br />
in medical text books, health professional journals, and<br />
the promotional materials sent by drug companies. It<br />
has been pointed out to me that a recent English study<br />
* of drug advertisements showed basically only two images<br />
of women: the demure in ads for the Pill, and the harrassed<br />
in ads for tranquillisers.<br />
Ads for the Pill showed no women working whether<br />
in the house or in paid employment and little indication<br />
of their social background. Most of the women were<br />
affluent and young ( though not too young), sensible<br />
rather than flighty, demure rather than openly sexual.<br />
In marked contrast the women in the ads for<br />
tranquillisers and anti-depressants are usually older,<br />
with children, more dishevelled and less fashionable than<br />
in those for the Pill and mostly surrounded by piles of<br />
dirty crockery, children, and washing. The message.. in<br />
these ads range from: " lack of space and lack of privacy<br />
spawn unhappy people" ( the suggested solution to this being<br />
to prescribe a tranquilliser to remove the unhappiness)<br />
through to: " the ulcer prone businessman is a cliche of<br />
competitive society. Less recognised as such is the tired<br />
and tearful housewife, resentful of her role, subject<br />
to pressures virtually unknown in former generations"<br />
( the suggested solution being to restore perspective by<br />
tranquillising the disturbed brain chemistry).<br />
Health personnel, like the rest of us, usually<br />
deny that advertisements have any influence on their<br />
behaviour. It may well be true that such advertisements </p>
<p>do not lead these people to administer or prescribe a<br />
particular product but none of us can fail to be<br />
influenced by the overall message. These advertisements<br />
reveal a consistently limited image of women. Women are<br />
not portrayed as independent individuals, each with a<br />
place of her own in society.<br />
It is clear that there are limits to what governments<br />
alone can achieve in this area. Responsibility for change<br />
lies with all concerned. The basic problem, some of whose<br />
manifestations I have briefly touched upon, resides in<br />
the attitudes which individuals and institutions within our<br />
society have towards women, their health, and their bodies<br />
attitudes which women also have towards themselves and<br />
their bodies. The aim of this conference must be to understand,<br />
challenge and change these attitudes. * To do thissuccessfully<br />
all t--hose concerned in this area must listen<br />
and learn how women perceive the world, must understand what<br />
forces shape their experiences both in their formative and<br />
their more mature years, must question why the fullness<br />
of their experiences is so difficult to accept. Wle must<br />
cease to limit their potential, their potential to develop<br />
into diverse human beings.<br />
Good health care for women and effectLive delivery<br />
of family planning and related services must be based<br />
on adequate and sensitive research into causes and methods<br />
o-f treatment but ultimately it can only come -from a.<br />
correct understanding of how,, women feel about their bodies<br />
and a correct understanding of the lives they live.<br />
It gives me great pleasure then to welcome the<br />
participants to this conference, both Australian and<br />
overseas, and to declare this conference open. </p>
