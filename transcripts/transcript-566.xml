PRIMÃ± L MD! ISTER<br />
27th July, 1962,<br />
My dear Leslie, I refer to our conversation this afternoon<br />
about your stated and published views on the Common<br />
Market negotiations, You confirmed to me that you had stated your<br />
views, not only in Canberra on Wednesday night but in<br />
Melbourne on Thursday, and that when asked last evening<br />
by the representative of the A. B. C. you had Indicated<br />
that you stood by your statements.<br />
You made it quite clear to me that you were on<br />
these occasions speaking solely for yourself and were<br />
not prompted by any other Minister or, for that matter,<br />
by any official. As I pointed out to you, your estimate that<br />
the impact of British entry into the Common Market would<br />
be of minor importance to the Australian economy runs<br />
counter to the views formulated and expressed by Cabinet<br />
and pursued by Mr. McEwen and myself in two sets of<br />
heavy negotiations overseas this year,<br />
You told me with your usual candour that you<br />
could not honestly retract the views which you had<br />
expressed because they were views which you had held<br />
for some time. I need hardly tell you that I respect your<br />
views and your attitude. But Ministerial responsibility<br />
and Cabinet solidarity are of the essence of our system<br />
of Government. They are always important. They are<br />
no less important when a Government has a narrow majority.<br />
They are supremely important when a Government is engaged<br />
in advocating theo legitimate interests of Australia in a<br />
series of negotiations which we have repeatedly declared<br />
to be the most important in our time.<br />
I cannot allow a state of affairs to continue<br />
in which those of us directly concerned with the negotiations<br />
and with the forthcoming Prime Ministers' Conference can<br />
be met by the argument that our own Government contains<br />
and retains a Minister whose views are not those of the<br />
Cabinet. I am sad about all this as you know. I have<br />
done my best to try to devise some middle course, but I<br />
cannot find one. After all, the very integrity with which<br />
you hold your opinions would make it impossible for you<br />
to change them or to let it be thought that you had done<br />
so, Under all the circumstances, I must, with<br />
unfeigned regret, ask you for your resignation.<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
The Honourable L. H. E Bury, MI. Po,<br />
Minister for Air, </p>
