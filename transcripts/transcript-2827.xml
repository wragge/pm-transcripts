PRIME MIINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
AT JAKARTA<br />
THURSDAY 22ND FEBRUARY 1973<br />
Ladies and gentlemen: The Prime Minister will make some<br />
introductory remarks and then you can ask questions.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Ladies and gentlemen I am told you haven't yet<br />
got a copy of the communique. The delay is to add a passage<br />
following tne discussions that I had this afternoon with<br />
SriSultan Hamencku Buwonolx and the other ministers involved in<br />
economic affairs so I don't know if you want to wait unt ' il you<br />
do get the communique or whetner if it comes while you'r6 asking<br />
me questions you would like a phase to read it. I'm told the<br />
communique can't be nere until six o'clock at the earliest.<br />
Well ladies and gentlemen this limits it a bit I'm afraid.<br />
By way of preliminary all I need say is that my main objective<br />
in coming to Indonesia was to reinforce two tnings. The first<br />
is the continuity of Australian Government interest in<br />
Australia's nearest neighbour. Secondly to reinforce the personal<br />
relations which I'd achieved with President Soeharto on the many<br />
occasions I've met him since 1966. I believe both these objectives<br />
have been very satisfactorily achieved. Are there any questions?<br />
Q. Was there any special reason for your second meeting with<br />
President Soeharto?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. We had a long conversation yesterday you'll<br />
remember and we both thought that if the President's programme<br />
could be arranged it would be pleasant for us to have another<br />
conversation and this I'm happy to say was achieved.<br />
Q. What is your commentary regarding the outcome of the White<br />
Australia policy. Is it still useful now or still necessary?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There have been substantial changes in the<br />
Australian Government's immigration policy.' We now do not<br />
discriminate on the basis of race or nationality or colour among<br />
persons who are admitted to visit Australia or to settle in<br />
Australia. But those that come to settle in Australia are<br />
primarily now drawn not from government recruitment but from<br />
nominations by people who are living in Australia and who want<br />
close relatives to come and live there with them.<br />
Q. Were there discussions on future naval exercises?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This was not discussed. There was a passing<br />
reference to the success of the recent naval exercises between<br />
the Indonesian and the Australian navies. I'm sure there will<br />
be future such exercises not only between our naval forces but<br />
indeed between other sections of our armed forces.<br />
Q. Will there be another joint exercise this year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I didn't discuss my programme but there are<br />
certain to be future naval exercises. We were both pleased with<br />
tile results of the first one which was held recently. The </p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Barnard, is the<br />
M~ inister for Defence and he was here last year and he will be<br />
here again in the first week of April.<br />
Q. There is a report Prime Minister that there is a need for<br />
a military pact between Australia and Indonesia. How far are<br />
you adopting this idea?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There have been no discussions about a military<br />
pact between Indonesia and Australia during my visit or as far<br />
as I know ever. I don't think there has ever been a proposal<br />
for a military pact between Indonesia and Australia. There are<br />
as you know arrangements under which members of the Indonesian<br />
Armed Forces receive training in Australia and members of the<br />
Australian Armed Forces receive it in Indonesia.<br />
Q. The speech of yours at the State Banquet last Tuesday night<br />
have the impression that Australia would like to set up a form of<br />
co-operation in South Asia, of regional co-operation.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
Q. What's the Indonesian Government's and President Soeharto's<br />
reaction about your suggestion?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The communique has this passage in the middle<br />
of page 4. You've now got it have you. You see there:<br />
" President Soeharto welcomed Mr Whitlam's objective of the<br />
evolution of a widely representative Asian regional organisation.<br />
The President agreed that while such a concept was unlikely to<br />
come about in the short term he recognised its potential value<br />
in the longer term"<br />
Q. And what about ASPAC in the future. Australia has recognised<br />
Peking while Taiwan is one of the members of ASPAC.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. Its true that Australia, a member of ASPAC,<br />
has transferred her representation of China from Taipai to Peking.<br />
So too have two other members of ASPAC, Japan and New Zealand.<br />
So this really does very greatly limit the utility of ASPAC. it<br />
makes it anacharonistic as long as Taiwan is still a member of it.<br />
Q. It was reported that you did offer to President Soeharto to have<br />
a larger regional co-operation bigger than what we already have<br />
in ASEAN, which would merge ASEAN. Could you tell us what is<br />
behind this new Asian grouping you have in mind?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I never made in conversations with President<br />
Soeharto or at any time such an offer and I didn't in my statement<br />
with President Soeharto. Nor have I at any other time made the<br />
suggestion that there should be a merger of ASEAN with any other<br />
regional grouping.<br />
Q. Well, maybe the new form of regional grouping other than<br />
we already have.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, well perhaps it might help you, I think<br />
the Australian Embassy can probably give you a copy of it, but<br />
I did discuss this general question three weeks ago three and<br />
a half weeks ago when I opened the Australian Institute of<br />
Political Science Summer School in Canberra. Well perhaps it<br />
might help if I could read to you. ( Prime minister reads extract<br />
from A. I. P. S. speech). </p>
<p>3.<br />
" To meet the new realities and our perception of them.<br />
We shall be seeking new forms of regional co-operation. In its<br />
present form ASPAC no longer reflects those realities. In<br />
particular, the continued presence of Taiwan makes ASPAC<br />
anachronistic. Three of ASPAC's members, Australia, New Zealand<br />
and Japan, recognise Peking as the sole legal government of<br />
China. We will not be withdrawing immediately from ASPAC<br />
although we consider that unless there is a change in its present<br />
membership it cannot function effectively or continue for very<br />
long. In Wellington the New Zealand Prime Minister and I<br />
expressed our intention to work with our Asian and Pacific<br />
neighbours in making adjustments " i-o existing arrangements and<br />
seeki* ng new forms or' co-operation. We shall be conm:: ulting with our<br />
neicjibours including IndoneFsia, Japan and others, b-,: fore any<br />
final decisions are reachedl on how wo. should proceed. There is<br />
no question of seeking to change and enlarge ASEAN. We should<br />
like to see all our ASEAN neignbours in a larger regional<br />
association for Asia and the Pacific, but ASEAN itself is a<br />
sub-regional grouping which is doing valuable work and any<br />
enlargement of the organisation is a matter for its members.<br />
Regional co-operation will be one of the keystones of<br />
Australia's foreign policy for the seventies. We shall be<br />
charting a new course with less emphasis on military pacts.<br />
It will be based on an independent outlook on foreign affairs<br />
and will be directed towards a new regional community geared<br />
to the realities of the seventies.<br />
The guidelines of the regional community that I foresee will<br />
be an organisation genuinely representative of the region without<br />
ideological overtones, conceived, as an initiative to help free<br />
the region of great power rivalry that have bedevilled its<br />
progress for decades and designed to insulate the region against<br />
ideological interference from the great powers.<br />
I do not intend that Australia should try to impose a<br />
detailed formulation for setting up such a community and we shall<br />
not seek to intrude beyond our realistic capacity to participate<br />
and assist in tne realisation of this concept. We shall be<br />
patient and punctilious in our consultation and prepared at<br />
every turn to take account of and participdte in the genuine<br />
aspirations of the region. So you see that I did discount the<br />
idea of merging three and a half weeks ago.<br />
Q. ( ABC) Prime Minister. What were President Soeharto's<br />
objections to the short term value of this Asian concept that<br />
you put forward as regional co-operation?<br />
PRIM4E MINISTER: President Soeharto has no objections. He is<br />
concerned that the situation in Indo China should become clearer.<br />
Q. When do you visit Peking.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No arrangements have been made for me to<br />
visit Peking at all.<br />
Q. Or Tokyo?<br />
PRIME M4INISTER: It is probable that some of my colleacrues, about<br />
three of my colleagues and I will visit Tokyo at the end of next<br />
October because there is due about that time the second of the </p>
<p>annual meetings which take place between Japanese and Australian<br />
ministers. Last year the first meeting took place in Canberra.<br />
The next one is due to take place in Tokyo and the end of October<br />
seems to be the most convenient time.<br />
Q. Sir, since President Soeharto considers that the concept of<br />
regional groupings could not come about for short term purposes<br />
will you continue to seek for approval from other South East<br />
Asian countries?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Whenever I meet heads of government or heads<br />
of state or foreign ministers from any countries in South East<br />
Asia I will discuss this general concept. I have done so with the<br />
Prime Minister of New Zealand and the President of Indonesia.<br />
And there will be other occasions to discuss it in the next few<br />
months. For instance there will be a Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government conference in Ottawa in August and on that occasion<br />
tnere will be the Prime Ministers of New Zealand and Malaysia<br />
and Singapore as well as myself in attendance.<br />
Q. Have you established any framework for ministerial exchanges?<br />
What specific proposals were put to you on Australian investment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There have been no specific projects finalised.<br />
There are several matters under discussion but my visit was not<br />
intended to finalise any of these arrangements. As you can see<br />
I'm only accompanied by advisers from the Prime Minister's<br />
Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs. I don't have<br />
advisers from the Treasury or from other departments here with me.<br />
The Sultan gave me an aide memoire on the whole of this subject<br />
and of course I discussed many aspects of it this afternoon<br />
with Dr Sadli and Professor Widjojo and Dr Subroto and<br />
General Sudjono. You did also ask me about regular exchanges of<br />
visits by Ministers. There is no framework for regular visits<br />
by M'inisters each way although there are frequent visits as<br />
you know. There is one at the moment isn't there to Australia.<br />
And there are regular discussions between officials of the two<br />
governments on all these matters.<br />
Q. Prime Minister you said you would be talking to various<br />
Asian and Pacific leaders about this concept of regional<br />
co-operation? Can this be interpreted perhaps that your idea<br />
will slow down a little from what you may hvave had originally?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Q. Do you see any prospect of Australia calling together people<br />
who might be interested in talking about this.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have never expressed a view that Australia<br />
should call such a conference. Never. Obviously I don't discount<br />
that we could co-operate in calling such a conference but the<br />
programme for visits to Australia and by me to other countries<br />
hasn't changed. I've pointed out here just now the Commonwealth<br />
heads of government conference in Ottawa is in August has been<br />
arranged for about a month past and the meeting with the Japanese<br />
Ministers in Tokyo at the end of October has been discussed for<br />
about a month.<br />
Q. If there was a new regional association in the long-term<br />
how far ahead do you see it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: PIR IMwEoMuINlIdTnER': t discount the possibility of having </p>
<p>it in a couple of years. I wouldn't expect it before a couple<br />
of years. But I think there is a general realisation that the<br />
existing regional associations to which Australia belongs are<br />
inappropriate because they are transitory or because they're<br />
anachronistic or because they are losing members. There's the<br />
five power arrangements. That's the most recent one. Before that<br />
there were the ASPAC arrangements which I mentioned and before<br />
that again there were the SEATO arrangements. Well clearly none<br />
of these are arrangements which would be made now. And the<br />
sensible thing is to look for better arrangements. Ones which<br />
are more representative of the region and less idealogical or<br />
derivative than the existing ones.<br />
Q. A simple point. Your visit is to reassure continuity with<br />
the government. Can you specifically say the policy of the<br />
new government in terms of defence co-operation with Indonesia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I expressly welcomed the idea o f co-operation<br />
in my policy speech not only with Malaysia and Singapore but<br />
also with Indonesia, New Zealand and Fiji. I s9pecified those<br />
three additional countries with which we would be happy to have<br />
training procurement exercises.<br />
Q. The policy here is to develop a national resilience. And<br />
this has two prongs. The economic and internal security. Our<br />
defence co-operation will be therefore part of the second.<br />
Could you give a rationalisation of why our Australian aid<br />
priorities are spread over the two and not just concentrated<br />
say on the economic front.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I must make plain as I did to one of the<br />
first questions that the defence co-operation does not take the<br />
form of any pact. Indonesia has never entered into a military<br />
pact with any country. I doubt if any countries from now on<br />
will be entering into military pacts with any other countries.<br />
The day of military pacts has gone. Indonesia never went through<br />
that phase.. Indonesia believes that Australia can assist her<br />
in developing the skills of her armed forces. Australia is very<br />
happy to meet any such requests and Indonesia can also help<br />
Australia's armed forces in the development of their skills<br />
with particular application of course to this region and we<br />
appreciate the assistance which Indonesia has given. You do<br />
mention the policy of resilience or endurance. This policy comes<br />
out in all discussions I find. With the Sultan yesterday and with<br />
the President at our two " tete-a-tete and also on many<br />
occasions. As you noticed we've been together in cars or on<br />
platforms or at dinner. I can well understand the faith that<br />
Indonesians have in this principle. It is a particular<br />
application to their situation. Indonesia has resisted disruption<br />
and subversion. She has achieved independence and identity through<br />
her own efforts and Indonesia is indeed fortunate in the fact<br />
she doesn't have the racial, linguistic, the economic<br />
disparities that are characteristic of most other countries in<br />
the region. And even where there is diversity as in religion<br />
there is not dissension on that basis. Indonesia is very<br />
fortunate. Indonesia realises that she has a cohesion which<br />
is the basis of her strength. A cohesion extending over<br />
centuries. A cultural identity. A political identity. A social<br />
identity which can be a source of very great strength to the<br />
whole region and indeed of envy to most members of it.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, were you asked during your discussions<br />
with the Indonesian leaders for specific grants of aid on<br />
this particular trip? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Q. I was going to say if so, what were they?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: See answer to first question. No, no specific.<br />
Oh there was one, I beg your pardon there was one reference, the<br />
first time I believe but of course no decision was sought on it<br />
because it was a new concept. Perhaps you should check with<br />
Mr Woolcott afterwards as to the dates and quantities. My<br />
recollection is that the arrangements for particular assistance<br />
to Irian Barat expire next year. They started in 1968. They<br />
amounted to $ 30,000,000. The funds came I think from the<br />
Netherlands and the proposal was made that Australia might contribute<br />
to a continuation of this programme particularly to ensure that<br />
there was parity of development between Irian Barat and Papua<br />
New Guinea. I said I would certainly look at the proposal, refer<br />
it to my advisers for prompt consideration. I did however<br />
express the view that any assistance that Australia gave to<br />
Indonesia or to any part of Indonesia would almost certainly<br />
go through the government of Indonesia. This was a specific new<br />
suggestion that was made. There were no other specific<br />
suggestions. There was a discussion on existing or standing<br />
proposals which are the subject of discussion. It was never<br />
forecast that there would be any decisions made on any of these<br />
matters or that there should be any substantive discussion on<br />
them. Q. Did you happen to sort out the matter of the naval patrol<br />
boats which was left in abeyance in the visit of the previous<br />
Prime Minister last year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There was no reference to the specific programme<br />
of patrol boats. There was general reference to Indonesia's need<br />
of patrol boats in this very dispersed archipelago for various<br />
reasons of course. All sorts of, I don't know if the word was<br />
used, " smuggling". But that's the impression I got. There was<br />
a general reference to the desirability to improve maritime<br />
communications and to safeguard them. Mr Barnard I would expect<br />
would be discussing this matter more substantially when he comes<br />
up here.<br />
Q. It is concerning the aircraft, the Fl-ll. Australia tried to<br />
acquire this. I am wondering whether you still intend to acquire<br />
it. I believe that<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'll believe that they'll come when they arrive.<br />
You should understand that these aircraft have already been paid<br />
for by Australia. We paid for them so we might as well take them.<br />
We can't trade them in. We can't return them and they will be<br />
arriving I expect this year before the 10th anniversary of the<br />
contract being placed for them. Australian taxpayers have already<br />
paid for them so quite obviously we have to take<br />
we might as well take delivery of them. </p>
