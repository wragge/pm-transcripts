TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, HYATT HOTEL, CANBERRA, 22<br />
NOVEMBER 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Mr Farley has said that the<br />
Government's abandoned its policy for short term<br />
political expediency?<br />
PM: Well he's wrong, of course.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, did you offer an inducement<br />
to PM: I categorically deny these totally bizarre and<br />
unsubstantiated allegations. As I said last night, if<br />
anyone has done that from within the Labor Party I would<br />
move for their expulsion because I'd love to see him<br />
here. One of the things that's interesting about this<br />
bizarre Xrogqr-, ou-tbucrst is the curious silence of Andrew<br />
P eacock. Have you noticed, curiously silent? I wonder<br />
why Andrew won't say something about it. I wish he<br />
would. So why is he silent? It's a very, very seriousto<br />
coin a phrase of his a very, very serious allegation<br />
has been made. Now I categorically deny it. Why doesn't<br />
Mr Peacock say something about it? What about Dr Hewson,<br />
the standard bearer of purity in political campaigning?<br />
Here he has his Victorian President dipping his grimy<br />
hands into the buckets of mud and throwing them around,<br />
unsubstantiated allegations which I categorically deny.<br />
Now why don't we hear something from Andrew? Why don't<br />
we hear something from Dr Hewson? You know I'm<br />
fascinated. JOURNALIST: as * to where who, if anybody in the Labor<br />
Party, has done this?<br />
PM: As I say, if anyone has done it, if anyone has done<br />
it and I found out, a's I say, I would move for their<br />
expulsion on the grounds of political ineptitude as well<br />
as impropriety. But it's just a nonsense. I mean you<br />
don't need to be very politically astute to understand<br />
it. They are being hurt and properly hurt by the<br />
accuracy of the way in which I've hit the target about<br />
their capital gains tax and the name of their President<br />
has obviously been associated with this attack. Now this<br />
is a desperate attempt to divert attention from an area<br />
in which they have no defence. I mean in life if you<br />
have no defence on something what people tend to do is to </p>
<p>oorr -X rDI TIL. V:-T. V= Z ZrP I V Xi Xv RZ, NiO r VZ'<br />
-2-<br />
( PM cont) divert. But this will not be a diversion.<br />
They will have to face up to reality that their capital<br />
gains tax policy represents, as I have said and will<br />
continue to repeat, the most socially obscene and<br />
* economically insane suggestion that's ever been put<br />
before the community. It is a massive pillaging of the<br />
Australian public, a transfer of billions of dollars from<br />
the 994 of Australians to the wealthy 1t. It's in that<br />
sense that I've said that their President, who has openly<br />
boasted about his involvembnt with the formulation of<br />
this policy, it is their President, John Elliott, who<br />
typifies that obscenity and that economic insanity. Now<br />
that's not an attack upon Mr Elliott personally. He is<br />
their President, he boasts of being associated with the<br />
formulation of their policy, he would be a beneficiary.<br />
Now I have zeroed in remorselessly and will with that<br />
attack. They have no defence. You noticed in the<br />
reports from their party room yesterday, they are worried<br />
about the Hawke attack and the Keating attack because<br />
they should be worried, because the Australian people<br />
will not accept, as I say, that social obscenity and that<br />
economic insanity. Now what do they do in those<br />
circumstances? Make these bizarre, unsubstantiated<br />
allegations. Well come on Andrew, come on Hewson, speak<br />
up. And also John Elliott, when you come back you,<br />
please, speak up.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Pr-_ 1SoY7__~ i1n&amp; UtVLS<br />
recommiffndat ons, the abD-F-." the end<br />
of the century. What's your view on that?<br />
PM: I'll be speaking tonight on that subject. I can't<br />
pre-empt that. I suggest that you should be there and<br />
listen to what I've got to say. Let me say this; it is<br />
very, very clear that in the whole of my public life I amn<br />
one who believes in liberalised trade, domestically and<br />
internationally. So you will see that I'm not<br />
unsympathetic to what Dr Garnaut is saying. But for the<br />
JOURNALIST; inaudible<br />
PM: NQ, no, no, no. I'm not saying anything more than<br />
that. For the full exposition of my response and the<br />
Government's response to the Garnaut Report you'll have<br />
to contain yourself in patience until this evening.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, forty thousand farmers don't<br />
appear to agree with your policies.<br />
PM: You should've been in there listening to them.<br />
from us and what we're doing.<br />
ends </p>
