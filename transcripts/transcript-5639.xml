PRIME MINISTER THURSDAY, 20 AUGUST, 1981<br />
ADDRESS AT AUSTRALIA-JAPAN BUSINESS<br />
CO-OPERATION COMMITTEE LUNCHEON<br />
CANBERRA<br />
( As Delivered)<br />
I welcome very much the opportunity to be with you today, ; and<br />
I am glad to see that both organisations are growing in health<br />
and strength, in membership, and in the width of your activities.<br />
Both organisations are important. We recognised long ago, when<br />
the Australia-Japan trade treaty was first signed and negotiated<br />
on Australia's side by Doug Anthony's predecessor, John McEwan,<br />
in about 1955 or 1956, that it was not only to be a trade<br />
relationsh; iD. It needed to be a much broader one that that.<br />
Therefore, there had to be be interconnections between companies,<br />
between people from many different walks of life from both Japan<br />
and from Australia. Much has been achieved in the years since then,<br />
I believe probably much more than the signatories of that treaty<br />
envisaged in 1956.<br />
Your members represent many companies and statutory bodies wit~ h<br />
a very significant involvement in economic and trade relationships<br />
between Japan and Australia. The Committee has made a very valuable<br />
contribution in streng--hei'ing ties between our two countries over<br />
what is.-very nearly 20 years.<br />
There is no need to emphasise to anyone here the importance of the<br />
relationship between our countries. Japan is Australia's larqfest<br />
export market. Australia is certainly one of Japan's fastest<br />
growing export markets. But one thing which is particularly<br />
welcome; new Japanese investment in this country has grown from<br />
a little under $ 200 million two or three years ago to nearly<br />
$ 500 million in the year to March. This is something that we have<br />
sought to encourage. We are very glad indeed to see that it has<br />
taken place. Traditional investment in this country I suppose has<br />
mostly been from the United Kingdom and from the United States<br />
but one of' the features of the last 10 to 15 years is the broadening<br />
of other countries' interest in Australia as a place in which<br />
to invest. We welcome very much the growth of Japanese investment<br />
in this country. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
One of the very important principles which was established<br />
early in the life of this Government between Japan and Australia,<br />
is that there needs to be certainty and stability in trade in both<br />
directions. There can be no sound trade relationship if that is<br />
subject to undue, sudden, unforseen disruptions, embargoes, OnEt<br />
way or the other. The strength of the relationship between Japan<br />
and Australia has improved ver-y greatly with the broad, and as I<br />
understand, absolute recognition that that principle must be<br />
maintained.. It is an important, indeed an essential foundation,<br />
for a sensible and growing trade relationship and one which leads<br />
to an improved understanding between the countries involved.<br />
There are other areas where Japan and Australia stand together..<br />
Wle both have strong and growing economies. That is not somethiLng<br />
that can be said about many advanced industrial countries around<br />
the world at the present time. In that context, I would like to0<br />
say one or two things about the Budget that John Howard introduced<br />
a couple of nights ago. I strongly believe that that Budget's<br />
priorities are right. It needs to be seen, as the case with a. ll<br />
our Budgets, in the broadest perspective, maintaining balance*<br />
between different sections and groups within the Australian community<br />
but driving in a determined way towards objectives which will<br />
advance the living standards of all Australian families.<br />
The Budget with a domestic surplus, which on a comparative basis<br />
wi-th last year because there is an extra pay day in this year<br />
for the Corni. onwealth which costs something over $ 400 million, so.<br />
on a comparative basis with last year the domestic surplus rather<br />
-than the $ 1., 540 million the Treasurer announced, nearer $ 2,000 millic!:<br />
The overall. balance in the Budget must, for a considerable period,<br />
very nearly be a first again amongst advanced industrial countries.<br />
Getting rid of a domestic deficit that has to be funded by Governmen:<br />
borrowings or in some cases even by just plain straight printing<br />
money only does enormous damage. Having got rid of that situation<br />
I regard as a very significant achievement.<br />
I noted one of the editori-als which said that this was still big<br />
Government spending, or a big Government spending Budget. Well, if<br />
it is I do not know what words would be used for most other Budgets<br />
in most other counftkies around the world, because if you take out<br />
that extra pay day and it is. legitimate to do so expenditures<br />
have increased by less than one per cent in real terms over last<br />
year. Have in mind that within that there is a 5% to 6% 0 real<br />
increase in defence expenditure, over 14% increase in welfare<br />
expenditure which some people say is not enough but others say is<br />
too much. That increase is not insignificantly influenced by<br />
indexation of pensions but also by the fact-that there are more people<br />
in this community of pensionable age. So that again, is a very real<br />
area of increase.<br />
To judge whether or not a Budget is a big spending Budget or Wheth~ er<br />
it is a restrained Budget, as I am certain in my own mind that this<br />
is, it is important to look on the total claims that the Budget<br />
puts upon the resources of the community. When we came into office<br />
tho Federal Government was claiming nearly 31t of the total resources<br />
produced by the community. W,. e have that down to 27.6%. If you make<br />
so): Re adjustments for different accounting and different policies in<br />
one or two areas, the difference would be even more marked but again,<br />
with a continuation of policies, ' there is not the slightest doubt<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
that the proportion of resources t-aken by the Budget will<br />
fall further, but having reduced it from a little under 31%<br />
to 27.6% over four or five years is a very significant<br />
achievement indeed.<br />
The Budget obviously has to balance a variety of important factors.<br />
It obviously needs to achieve economic and employment growth.<br />
If the economy does not continue to grow as it has, then that<br />
upsets . business plans of. industry, it makes it diffi6ult if not<br />
impossible to achieve rising living standards for Australian<br />
families. At the same time,. while we have maintained balance,<br />
improved the domestic surplus, we have increased defence spending<br />
very greatly and greater.-assistance in somte special areas of need.<br />
One of the greatest contributions of this Budget ought to be<br />
relieve pressure in the markets on interest rates. That is something<br />
that not only affects businesses, it affects Australian families,<br />
home builders and it is important that those pressures be reduced.<br />
It is not possible to reduce those pressures unless demand is reduced.<br />
If we want to make room, as we do, for continuing expansion and<br />
growth in the private sector, then it is important that Governments<br />
and not just the Federal Government be as restrained as possible<br />
in their demands on the nation's resources. So the Budget, as we<br />
believe, will continue to strengthen Australia's growing but still<br />
recovering economy. You cannot go through the trauma and the<br />
difficulties of the middle 1970s without it taking some considerable<br />
time finally to leave the legacy ' of that behind. The Budget will<br />
very significantly contribute to our primary aim of establishing<br />
the circumstances in which there will be rising living standards<br />
for Australians.<br />
There are obviously several issues of concern: industrial relations<br />
and unions using great militancy, seeking unreasonable wage increases<br />
is something-that must concern all of us. I believe that we might<br />
be approaching a period where there is a little more sense in that<br />
particular environment. Tlhte discussions that we have been having in<br />
recent mn-ths with the new membership and leadership of the<br />
Australian Council of Trade Unions has established a basis of trust<br />
and understanding wh~ ich I believe is and will work to the benefit<br />
of this country. It is worth noting that in all the discussions<br />
that we have had, there has never been any attempt by anyone from<br />
either side to try and score points or make political capital out<br />
of the discussions and the negotiations tha * t have taken place.<br />
I certainly appreciate the relationship that has been established<br />
with the leadership of the Australian Council 6f Trade Unions, and<br />
I believe they also appreciate the access that they have to Government<br />
as a consequence of that.<br />
It might have been noticed that we have been adopting a slightly<br />
different approach in our own areas of employment. Ian Sinclair and<br />
other Ministers have demonstrated that approach. It is one of<br />
policy. In our own areas of employment if people want to be paid<br />
they are going to h ave to do the work they are asked to do and<br />
expected to do, otherwise they are suspended or stood down for<br />
whatever period is necessary and that happens forthwith in the<br />
first instance. I do not know how many people understand that about<br />
10: 30 one morning the air traffic controllers announced that thiey<br />
were going to ban all aircraft between Australia and the United States.<br />
On 11: 30 of that same morning, Ralph Hunt announced that anyone </p>
<p>4-<br />
participating in that ban would immediately be suspended from<br />
duty. At about 2: 00 on the sa-me day, the union lifted the bans.<br />
That I believe, is an example of the way in which employers and<br />
especially Government employers ought to be responding when there<br />
is a difficult circumstance.<br />
One thing where I really th ' ink there was a great deal of<br />
unnecessary hysteria for-a week or two I think it has now settled<br />
down but when the Arbitration Commission indicated the abandonment<br />
of wage indexation instead of a lot of people saying there is a<br />
vacuum, this is going to be disaster, the sky is the limit, I would<br />
have thought there should have been and would have been many people<br />
saying this is the best-thing that has happened in the wage fixing<br />
area for five or six years, because all indexation did was to<br />
establish a higher limit from which people then set out to negotiate<br />
for more. We all know that that is what occurred. There was a<br />
4% or 5% real increase in wages last year. Without indexation<br />
there is no vacuum. The Commission is there. All State Governments<br />
tell me that they support the centralised wage fixation system, and<br />
the ACTU also say the same thing'. There will be industry cases that<br />
will establish guidelines. There will be a National Wage Case in<br />
February that will establish guidelines. People will have to argue<br />
their-cases with a sense of reason and firmness and strength if' they<br />
want a result. With indexation of course, everythi4ng automatically<br />
jacked up onto a higher plateau every year or every six months.<br />
The fact that the circumstances have changed is now being much<br />
better understood. We had a meeting last week again, with the ACTLJ,<br />
with employers a nd with Premiers in relation to it. I think that<br />
the decisions that were made then should help to understand that<br />
there is a system and it is up to all * the parties to make that<br />
system work. It is worth no6ting that all Premiers of all polit~ ical<br />
persuasions agreed that they would lend their efforts and energies<br />
to achieving that.<br />
We need also, in looking at the re lationship between Japan and<br />
Australia, to make sure we understand the kind of world that we are<br />
living in. There are grounds for very obvious concern. World trade<br />
is slack. There is no growth in a number of important countries.<br />
In a number of countries inflation is entrenched, unemployment is<br />
high and in a number it is still rising. If we are looking around<br />
the world, I think we would both have to come to the conclusions.<br />
that in a number of places appropriate policies are not in place.<br />
We ought to be very glad therefore, to find a sense of renewal, of<br />
resolve, in the United States. I know it is uncomfortable when their<br />
interest rates rise to high levels, and when that has implications for<br />
other people but a strong and growing United States economy has<br />
great implications-for Japan, for Australia, for Europe, and to<br />
re-establish strength, to destroy inflation in that economy, is of<br />
vast importance to all advanced industrial nations. Indeed, it is of. L<br />
great importance to the whole trading -world. President Reagan's<br />
resolve to achieve this as a first priority of his Government is one<br />
which I believe is to be commnended. </p>
<p>1. It is always possible to argue about particular aspects of<br />
policy, but I have not the slightest doubt that the broad<br />
thrust of what he is about is right for the United States and<br />
in re-establishing the strength of that economy that is good<br />
for us, it is good for Japan, it is good for world trade generally.<br />
It will also have a by-product, because the more the United States'<br />
destroys inflation, the more competitive the United States<br />
becomes, the harder will other countries find it to continue with<br />
policies which are complacent about these particular matters.<br />
In a sense, it will therefore compel other major countries in<br />
Europe to adopt policies that will also return to a healthier<br />
situation than that which they now have. The alternative for them<br />
if they do not would be.--a continuing worsening of their own<br />
situation, a continuing destruction of their own competitivenes; s,<br />
and continuing increase in their own unemployment.<br />
I also think that Japan and Australia, both being wealthy count~ ries<br />
in a somewhat difficult world, and both being placed as we are<br />
one at the North and one at the South of the Western Pacific, need<br />
to understand that we live in a world where $ 800 million people have<br />
an annual income of something less than $ 200 Australian a year.<br />
They have none of the medical services, the water supply, things<br />
which everyone in this country and I would believe most people if not<br />
everyone in Japan, would take'utterly and to-tally for granted.<br />
I think Japan and Australia have a common view that more needs to<br />
be done in this particular area. It is not a question of morality.<br />
It is not a question of humanitarianism. It is a question of our<br />
own self interest. If one looks at the direction of Japan's trade<br />
an enormous amount of it depends upon markets in the Third World.<br />
If we look at our trade, a good deal of it depends upon markets<br />
in the Third World. If there can be rising living standards,<br />
greater economic take-off in more countries, that is going to<br />
create more opportunities for the industries of Australia and the<br />
industries of Japan. There is an enormous self-interest in seeking<br />
to establish the circumstances where world poverty can to some<br />
extent be alleviated. But,-we need to understand also that thereare<br />
two * sides to this coin. It is all very well to say that irore<br />
resource~ s need to go into the World Bank or that the<br />
Monetary Fund need 7 to accommodate itself to<br />
the wishes of the Third World in a way which might not quite bie<br />
so economically pure but a little more humanitarian and our owin<br />
direct aid might also perhaps need to be increased, but thE1se<br />
lead to the circumstance in which people are producing textil. es,<br />
people are producing electronic goods, even people are producing<br />
motor cars. Now, President Mitterand of France agrees with all<br />
the first things which I enunciated, but I then asked him what: happens<br />
when they start to produce these goods and they suggest that t: hey<br />
might want to sell them into the markets of France. That, he said,<br />
was a matter to be considered. Indeed it is a matter to. be<br />
considered, because as people start to produce, as they start to<br />
grow, as their economies start to join in, it is not good enough<br />
to say that the benefits of the market system are there for those<br />
who have arrived dnd are to be denied to those who have not yet<br />
arrived. Now, this involves some difficulty. It can involve some<br />
pain to many of our countries. ASEAN's exports to Australia h-ave<br />
been growing at nearly 40% a year for the last 10 or 12 years. </p>
