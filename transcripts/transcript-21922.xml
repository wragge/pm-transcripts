    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce a contribution of $10 million to the United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF).</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the UNDEF is to promote democracy throughout the world by providing assistance for projects that build and strengthen democratic institutions and facilitate democratic governance in new, emerging and consolidated democracies.</p>
<p>Australia was among those countries which urged the establishment of the fund in the lead-up to the UN Summit. The Australian Government believes the UNDEF will play a valuable role in highlighting globally the importance of democracy.</p>
<p>In 2005-06, an estimated $885 million will be provided through the Australian aid programme on activities directly related to improving governance. About $292 million will be spent on promoting good governance through other priority sectors such as planning and management of basic service delivery.</p>
<p>Current Australian projects that promote democratic governance include support to the Solomon Islands Parliament; assistance to the Indonesian Government for legal and institutional reforms; support for electoral reform in Papua New Guinea; and support for election processes in Iraq and Afghanistan.  </p>
