FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 18 SEPTEMBER, 1980<br />
STATEMENT TO THE HOUSE<br />
ON MULTI-NATIONAL EXERCISES<br />
I informed the House on 19 February, 1980, when I outlined<br />
the Government's response to the-Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan,<br />
that we intended discussing with our regional friends the<br />
further development of our defence relations with them.<br />
Amongst the specific measures that I mentioned then were<br />
combined exercises between the Australian defence force and<br />
Forces of our South East Asian neighbours.,<br />
The resilience of independent regional countries is an<br />
important element in contributing to regional stability, and<br />
the abiding security interests we have in common with our<br />
neighbours call for continuing consultation and co-operation<br />
in the defence field. The Government regards such co-operation<br />
as a long-term measure of major importance.<br />
I am pleased to be able to inform Honourable Members that I<br />
took the opportunity during the recent Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government Regional Meeting in New Delhi to hold further<br />
consultations on defence matters with the Prime Minister of<br />
Malaysia, Datuk Hussein Onn, and the Prime Minister of Singapore,<br />
Mr. Lee Kuan Yew. We all agreed that all three countries would<br />
gain much from the conduct by our respective defence forces<br />
of multinational exercises. It was agreed that we should<br />
initially look to conducting these under the auspices of the<br />
five power arrangements.<br />
Since returning from New Delhi, I have consulted with my British<br />
and New Zealan d colleagues. They have indicated that they endorse<br />
what is proposed. There * is therefore now agreement in principle<br />
between all parties of the five power arrangements..<br />
Honourable Members may be aware that the last major exercise<br />
involving all participants in the five power arrangements,<br />
including both ground-and air forces, took place in 1970.<br />
Air defence exercises are regularly held in the Malaysia and_<br />
Singapore area and there are frequent bilateral exercises<br />
involving ground forces of the various participants. For example,<br />
today there are Singapore soldiers in Townsville preparing<br />
to take part in an exercise with Australian troops. / 2 </p>

An infantry company of the. Malaysian Army took part in a<br />
similar exercise in Australia in May-June last year. Now that<br />
we are all agreed that exercises having a more distinctive<br />
multinational character should be re-instituted, we shall be<br />
taking early action towards this end. I have given instructions<br />
that Australia should move with full vigour to help put the<br />
agreement into practical effect.<br />
Singapore recently requested that the Singapore Armed Forces<br />
be permitted to carry out their own training exercises in<br />
agreed training areas in Australia. A small country, Singapore<br />
faces exceptional difficulties in finding adequate training,<br />
space for its armed forces on its own territory. The Singapore<br />
request is for facilities to enable them to exercise their<br />
commanders and units of their ground forces. Some naval training<br />
and air crew training is also envisaged.<br />
Included in the last-named is a request to deploy and maintain<br />
at Nowra Naval Air Station a small number of Skyhawk aircraft<br />
to facilitate advanced pilot training. We have been pleased<br />
to agree to Singapore forces conducting training exercises in<br />
Australia and have also agreed to their specific request to<br />
deploy Skyhawk aircraft to Nowra. All this has been discussed<br />
with Malaysia as a member of the five power defence arrangments.<br />
I have already emphasised Australia's abiding interest in the<br />
security of the area to our north. The Government is prepared<br />
to give sympathetic consideration to meeting the special needs<br />
of other regional countries. Indeed, I made this clear during<br />
my discussions in New Delhi. We are exploring with the<br />
Malaysian and Singapore Governments arrangements for high-level<br />
talks on a broad range of matters in the defence field<br />
including those I have already referred to.<br />
I have indicated to Prime Minister Hussein Onn and to<br />
Prime Minister Lee our readiness to have the Secretaries of the<br />
Departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs and the Chief of<br />
the Defence Force Staff visit Kuala Lumpur and Singapore for<br />
such discussions at an early date.<br />
