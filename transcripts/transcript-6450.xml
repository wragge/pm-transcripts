TRIA NSCRIT PIME.^ TSTER IHAlKE ' FORUMf PRESS-ONFERENCE<br />
28 AUGUST 19' 84 1.45 P. M.<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, most of the time this morninqg : as<br />
been spent on functional topics. The meeting commenced on<br />
consideration of the special problems of smaller Foru. states<br />
and our consideration of that matter was on the basis of a short<br />
paper that had. been prepared by Kiribati. They propose a<br />
committee of government representatives to direct itself really<br />
to the concern that Kiribati had that is shared by other smaller<br />
states that to some extent the co-operative arrangements that<br />
are often made within the Forum and from out of the Forum<br />
respecting Forum countries tend at times to pass the smaller<br />
states by because they haven't got the intrinsic country<br />
capacity or infrastructure to take advantage of some of the<br />
aid proposals that are involved. Now that was the feeling<br />
that was understood by members of the Forum and so a<br />
Committee of the smaller states to be chaired by Kiribati<br />
and comprising Western Samoa, the Cook Islands, Tuvalu,<br />
Nuie, Fiji and New Zealand are to look at that matter and<br />
to report to the next meeting of the Forum. The next item<br />
was under the heading of Forum Institutional Arrangements<br />
and this involved the weighty subject of the name of SPEC<br />
as to whether because SPEC didn't in fact contain the name<br />
Forum this did tend to confuse people. I admit<br />
early on it confused me. But there was an affection evidenced<br />
for the acronym SPEC and they couldn't bring themselves to<br />
change the title at this stage and so it will continue to<br />
as SPEC and continue the work of the Secretariat of the<br />
Forum and be responsible for the co-ordination of the economic<br />
co-operation efforts. And it may be that the matter may be<br />
considered again next year. The next item was the Pacific<br />
Forum Line. This really concerned the fact that within<br />
New Zealand Mr Harry Julian, who had been the New Zealand<br />
director of the Forum Line and Chairman of the Forum Line,<br />
he has ceased to be the New Zealand director and so it was<br />
indicated that there would be a meeting of the Forum Line<br />
directors in about the third week of September and of course<br />
the appointment of the Chairman is a matter then for the<br />
Board. I note that David Lange gave reassurances to the<br />
meeting that the Chairman's resignation will not impair the<br />
Line's operation and that his Government remains committed<br />
as was his predecessor to the operation of the Line.<br />
There was another item dealt with and I mention this very<br />
briefly. It was about supply of energy in to Forum Island<br />
countries some concern that they at times paid higher<br />
prices than appropriate for petroleum. There was very little<br />
discussion on this item because there is an ongoing study<br />
under the Pacific Energy Program and they will continue those<br />
discussions . nd that again hopeifully will be a matter of " a<br />
more substantive rePorc for the ne: t For. um. The Question cf<br />
the Solomon Island intrcduction to the Forum then of the<br />
Cispute thyv are currentlv havinc with the United States<br />

30 miles o; f ta cnoas and o1' i. iou1 . v: lv t. h ore -1 l<br />
:; ithin their exclusive eco'omic zone. The : mtter has ben<br />
discussed as to an appropriate form of resolution and officials<br />
of Australia and New Zealand and the Solomon Islands will be<br />
working on that this afternoon with a view to inclusion of<br />
an appropriate reference in the final communique. I think<br />
it's understood that ultimately the matter will have to be<br />
resolved in bilateral negotiations between the Solomon Islands<br />
and the United States Government and that ultimately this<br />
issue, not only-in respect of the Solomon Islands but of other<br />
regional island states, will depend upon the successful<br />
conclusion of a multi-lateral access agreement and in that<br />
respect we've noted that discussions are to take place on<br />
this issue in Suva next month. The next item that was dealt<br />
with was an item introduced by New Zealand in regard to the<br />
law of the sea. New Zealand introduced a paper to the Forum<br />
urging countries to sign and to ratify that agreement. The<br />
current state of play as I recall is that about 135 countries<br />
have signed, at this stage 12 have ratified. So the proposal<br />
urging further signatures and ratification was uncontroversial<br />
and was accepted. Then there was some fairly routine reports<br />
to Forum heads from SPEC itself, the Forum Fisheries Agency<br />
and the South Pacific Regional Environment Program and the<br />
University of the South Pacific. They were quite routine.<br />
There was virtually no discussion on those matters. Then<br />
under the heading of Other Business I took the opportunity<br />
there myself of reiterating some general points by way of<br />
background to the consideration we had had yesterday of a<br />
nuclear free zone to put it in. the context of our concern<br />
at the way in which the variety of international negotiations,<br />
particularly START and INF had broken down and the increasing<br />
tension in negotiations or absence of negotiations between the<br />
two superpowers and in that context referred to the work that<br />
was being done in the Conference on Disarmament as a result<br />
of initiatives on the subject of a comprehensive test ban<br />
treaty. And I raised that because it seemed to me it was<br />
appropriate to have that background in anything that we say<br />
in the cormmunique on the subject of the nuclear free zone.<br />
And that intervention that I made was accepted by the heads<br />
of Government and will be reflected in the communique.<br />
Michael Somare made a report on the situation regarding<br />
border crossers between his country and West Irian. And<br />
the substance of that report was that I think it could<br />
be available, I don't think there's any problem about its<br />
availability and I would think you could get copies of that.<br />
if you wanted it from the Director but the essence of the<br />
report is that following the outbreak of this incident in<br />
February when there was the flag incident initiated by the OPM<br />
in Irian Jaya Jayapura the talks took place in April between<br />
the representatives of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. And there<br />
was an expression of confidence by Michael Somare that this<br />
matter was being satisfactorily resolved between the two<br />
Governments. But that as I say if you want the fleshing out<br />
of that it is available and I think Michael Somare was particularlv<br />
keen to cot that stateent out in the licht of an unofficial<br />
paper that was circulated yesterday by some Vanuatu based group<br />
on this matter. And you will see when you read the statement </p>
<p>cont..: ' of ' Mic'hael Somare that * he refers to ' the fact that<br />
a memorandum of aQree'-. Mnt ',: 4ith ndo. nesia \. as sent last week<br />
which indicated that no problems are expected and he is<br />
looking forward to a far better understanding with Indonesia<br />
on this. One other matter well really four other slight<br />
matters the Solomon Islands had put a paper in in regard<br />
to the idea of an honours system for the region and I indicated<br />
that I thought we couldn't accept the idea in principle and<br />
if they wanted to pursue it they would need to put a more detailed<br />
proposal in to the Secretariat and in those circumstances the<br />
Solomon Islands withdrew their proposal. The representative<br />
Nakayama of the Federated States of Micronesia reported on the<br />
successful negotiations that were proceeding with the United<br />
States in regard to their constitutional position and I am<br />
pleased to say that in the course of making that report he<br />
indicated full support for the Australian proposal in regard<br />
to a nuclear free zone and indeed said that the constituents<br />
of that proposal were entirely consistent with the constitution<br />
of the Federated States of Micronesia. Twofold points towards<br />
the end Sir Walter Lini raised the question in respect of<br />
New Caledonia of whether given the fact that there is frequently<br />
reference to the lack of trained Kanaks in the professional<br />
and technical area and that that has been one of the elements<br />
of the problem in the early granting of independence, he<br />
raised the question of the possibility of educational scholarship<br />
facilities being made available by member countries to enable<br />
some acceleration of such training. And that was noted and<br />
the countries gave a positive response to it. That, in other<br />
words, didn't require a collective Forum decision but a positive<br />
reaction from individual . members. Finally the dates for the<br />
16th Forum next year were the 4th to 6th of August and to be<br />
held in Rarutonga in the Cook Islands. May I say this, that<br />
the officials will still be working on the communique this<br />
afternoon and it's intended to adopt that this evening when<br />
the reception is held we'll go into formal session very briefly<br />
to formally adopt the record and communique.<br />
JOURNALIST: So apart then, sir, than the communique the<br />
Forum's finished.<br />
Yes, and the feast tonight.<br />
JOURNALIST: Any dancing.<br />
And dancing.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did New Zealand present a paper today on diplomatic<br />
initiatives that Forum countries could take to put pressure on<br />
France over New Caledonian independence.<br />
P. M. No there was no paper presented. </p>
<p>-It. g'as. C er-ta. i. l. y not'to the Heids of Go'vrnmen-t,<br />
there was-no p-aper circulated by New Zealand ih regard Lo<br />
ways of putting pressure on France. I certainly cdidn' t see it.<br />
JOURNœ. ALIST: What position did you take on the Solomon Island<br />
That well it ., as a common position really that it<br />
was a matter for resolution between the United States and<br />
the Solomon Islands. We all agreed and while there were some<br />
differences of vie,, about just the words to be used there<br />
was no difference about the fact that it was an illegal action<br />
which was apprehended by the Solomons and that will be reflacted<br />
in the communique.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there going to be any criticism in the communique<br />
of the United States' attitude to the 200 mile<br />
Well what the form of expression will be is being<br />
resolved in discussions between officials of the Solomons,<br />
Australia and New Zealand. I mean in other words I can't<br />
say what the form of expression will be until we see the<br />
communique.<br />
JOURNTALIST: When you raised the topic of the test ban treaty<br />
did any other leaders speak on your background.<br />
No, they accepted what I've said that it was appropriate<br />
that a reference to that general. background should be included<br />
because it provides, if you like, the current international<br />
environment on these matters within which we'll be taking our<br />
initiatives. There was no dissent at all from that position.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke how did you find working alongside<br />
David Lange. I didn't work alongside him, he was at the other end<br />
of the table.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
Oh, I found it congenial. I don't wish to go into<br />
comparisons with is predecessor.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, sir, have you discussed with the<br />
leaders of Kiribati and Tuvalu the recommendation that their<br />
people should be given assisted inuigration aid to Australia.<br />
No.<br />
JOURNALIST: There's no suggestion though or might there be in<br />
the communique that Forum countries could agree to taking<br />
trade sanctions or retaliation against the Americans.<br />
P. M. No. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: What sort of titles did the Solomon Islanders have<br />
in. nind..ø I don't kno.. It didn't get to that stace.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why weren't you in favour of it Prime Minister.<br />
P. M. My Government has a very clear attitude to exogenous<br />
titles. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke do you believe that the slightly differing<br />
attitude that Australian and New Zealand have to nuclear<br />
disarmament as a central issue makes the relationshio between<br />
New Zealand and Australia slightly more tense than you would<br />
normally expect from two Labor Governments.<br />
No I wasn't conscious of any tension on this issue and<br />
in respect of the matters that we were dealing with here, of<br />
course, % e are at one. Because I repeat that we agree to the<br />
concept of a nuclear free zone and the position which I've put<br />
on Australia's behalf last year is one which is entirely<br />
consistent with their position. That is that in respect of<br />
the one matter of access of nuclear powered or armed vessels<br />
to a country's ports that that is a matter for decision<br />
by the country concerned. We are at one on that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does that put the ANZUS treaty at risk as a result<br />
of that. Does what.<br />
JOURNALIST: New Zealand's decision not to allo%., ships.<br />
Well I'm not aware that it's at risk.<br />
JOURNALIST: When do you next expect to carry on discussions<br />
with David Lange about the ship ban and ANZUS.<br />
Well, as I've made clear before, this is not a matter<br />
now for negotiation between Australia and New Zealand. We<br />
have had our discussions. I've put our point of view. Mr Lange's<br />
clearly aware of ,. hat our position is now as I've made clear<br />
on a number of occasions and I do again, I don't know why one<br />
has to keep repeating it, it has been made clear on many<br />
occasions, but I'll do it again that it is now a matter<br />
for discussion and negotiation between New Zealand and the<br />
United States. Those discussions are going on. That's a matter<br />
between those two countries.<br />
JOURNALIST: The PNG border question Mr Somare was merely<br />
making a report to the Forum was he about what was happening,<br />
he wasn't asking for any special agreement.<br />
No on the contrary it was a ma-tter of courtesy on<br />
his part. Ile was certainly not asking for anything. His*. </p>
<p>cont.:* ' position that he made quite clear ait the<br />
C} IOGRM meeting in Port Moresby earlier this month was when<br />
it was raised in fact by another of the cntries, he was<br />
very firm and correctly firm in my judgeoment, that this is<br />
a matter between two sovereign indiependent nations Papua<br />
New Guinea and Indonesia. And he was merely doing two things<br />
I think doing a courtesy to Forum members to acquaint them<br />
of those facts, not seeking endorsement acquainting them<br />
with the facts and in a sense, of course, responding to<br />
what he again might be regarded as improper references in<br />
an unofficially circulated paper yesterday.<br />
JOURNALIST: Therefore in fact the Forum was tacitly accepting<br />
the fact that it was a bilateral matter between PNG and the<br />
Indonesians. Not tacitly, explicitly.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, any thoughts of visiting New<br />
Zealand. Yes, sure.<br />
JOURNALIST: When do you think you might get around to it.<br />
Well I don't know. We haven't gjot a specific timetable<br />
in mind, but I'm certainly looking forward to coming over there<br />
some time in the future.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you been<br />
Oh yes, there is an interchange that Lange and I have<br />
* had. There's been an indication on bot~ h our parts that we would<br />
like to see one another in our respective countries.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you expect Lange to visit you too.<br />
I've got no attitudes about these things. We've both<br />
got our programs and the priorities that we have to fulfil and<br />
there's no standing on dignity as to who visits first at all<br />
either on his part or on mine.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you say Mr Hawke that you have a good rapport<br />
with Mr Lange.<br />
Oh yes, I would think so.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you actually spoken to him one-to-one since<br />
you ' ye been here.<br />
Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Was that at the retreat. </p>
<p>Ispb" ee" ttrha C," Isok.' o hin on . hisvesel"<br />
and just to even it up he spoke to iiie oii mine.<br />
JOURNALIST: Who circulatethe paper on wSat Mr Sombre<br />
was responding to.<br />
P. M. It was some group based in Vanuatu.<br />
JOURNALIST: You don't know what they're called do you?<br />
No, I don't know<br />
JOURNALIST: It's based in the Vanuatu Party Office.<br />
Is it. I didn't actually see one, it seems to have<br />
had a rather restricted circulation. But Michael saw it and<br />
he had a strong reaction.<br />
JOUPNALfST: Mr Hawke you've been to Tuvalu and you have seen<br />
some of the problems can you be able to tell. us what<br />
Australia may be doing in immuediate assistance<br />
P. M. Well we're already giving very substantial assistance<br />
and my visit here has confirmed that it's appropriate that<br />
we should continue to do that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, any special assistance?<br />
Well there's been no request for special assistance<br />
and we're not intrusive.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you see something-that might be<br />
Well I'm not one who becomes an instant expert. After<br />
a 24 hour visit it's much more appropriate that the Government<br />
of Tuvalu should indicate what it's areas of priority are.<br />
They know their needs better than I do.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister in view of the Papua New Guinea<br />
stand on West Irian is the Forum's view that it should take<br />
no notice whatsoever of a force of oppression and atrocity<br />
that's being committed in that part of New Guinea by the<br />
Indonesian Government.<br />
The Forum didn't direct itself to this issue because<br />
it accepted what is manifestly the correct position and that<br />
is that Papua New Guinea is the only, by the way, the only<br />
member country of the Forum which has contiguous boundaries<br />
with another nation, and that the matters between those<br />
two states and concerning their border is a matter for them.<br />
It didn't address itself to the issue. It wasn't on the<br />
agenda. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: -So t. h'e reason t. h'at.. the -Forum was.-so reluctant<br />
to debate the West Irian is it that Australia and Paaia<br />
and New Guinea are si:. ply scared of Inc3-. esia?<br />
Oh, we're not going to pursue with that ridiculous<br />
line of questions. Is there a sensible question.<br />
JOURNALIST: It think it's a reasonable question.<br />
Well we're not here to debate.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you argue for a less strong criticism of the<br />
United States over the Solomon Islands fishing<br />
I don't think it's approprialte that we go into the<br />
sort of particular contributions. But I'm prepared to say<br />
this, that generally I take the view that if what you're about<br />
is trying to resolve a dispute and to get back to a situation<br />
which is going to be to the benefit of the complainant, which<br />
in this case is the Solomons, then it makes more sense to<br />
direct and concentrate what you've got to say and do upon a<br />
method of resolving it rather than spending a great deal of<br />
time hurling accusations around. That's the attitude that I've<br />
always adopted and I do in this.<br />
JOURNALIST: Were many of the Forum members supportive of<br />
the Solomon Islands<br />
It was not evident, no.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister has anything gone further regarding<br />
Australia's patrol boat offer. Is that firmed up yet.<br />
P. M: Yes, I reported to the Forum in the course of the discussions on<br />
the Solomon Islands issue that requests for tender have been<br />
let, let last month the month before last and so those<br />
processes are now underway. We'll receive tenders and construction<br />
would start next year I would hope.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke what about the small countries. I understand<br />
Tuvalu, for example, claimed that it would cost $ 250,000 a<br />
year to run one of these patrol boats and their total income<br />
from fishing is something in the order of about $ 500,000.<br />
Yes, there is a problem in respect of some of the<br />
states with low incomes. Kiribati has the same sort of problem<br />
and that's one of the reasons why we want to make the boats<br />
an issue as relatively unsophisticated as is consistent with<br />
the discharcge of the function involved. The speed of the boat<br />
that we've been talking about is 20 knots. Now a couple of<br />
the island countries have suggested 25 and even in one case,<br />
knots. Now obviously the more that you increase the speed<br />
of the vessel, the more sophisticated is the vessel and certainly<br />
more e:
</p><p>P. M. . coht... And s6 '* had" t his exa'mLien'evd ' and " at this<br />
stage the view is that the 20 knot vessel would ge-erallv<br />
sta_ ng noc t he rñ ccu irc-cnts d be . uch r. ore likel to<br />
meet the very real concern that you raise. : ow it may be<br />
that in respect of some of the smallest of the states that<br />
have this problem, that there may have to be some consideration<br />
of the economics of allocating some of their other aid towards<br />
helping them in that respect. Because it depends, as you say,<br />
upon the level of income which they either have currently<br />
got or could But I don't believe that given the level<br />
of the aid program that that should not: be a matter that's<br />
capable of negotiation.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir the American Tuna Boat Association has made<br />
some points about the fact the Jeanette Diana was arrested by what<br />
they described as an Australian pleasure yacht which has guns<br />
mounted on it. Do you have any attitude to Australian companies<br />
providing patrol boats for military type purposes.<br />
It's a matter of an arrangement between the sovereign<br />
government of the Solomon Islands leasing a vessel. Now if<br />
you're going to say that sovereign governments have the rights<br />
to lease vessels, then they've got to g( jet them from somewhere<br />
don't they. They did and when we undertake our program of<br />
providing patrol boats for these purposes they will be provided<br />
under tender by private companies in Australia for the Australian<br />
Government. ENDS. </p>
