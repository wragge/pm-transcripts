    <content><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year.</p>
<p>Well ladies and gentlemen today is the first Cabinet meeting of</p>
<p>   the New Year and not surprisingly we will spend a little time reviewing</p>
<p>   Australia's economic outlook, which is very strong and very</p>
<p>   positive because of the corrective measures that my Government took</p>
<p>   in place when it assumed the reins of office in March of 1996.</p>
<p>If those measures had not been put in place, if we had not eliminated</p>
<p>   Mr Beazley's $10.5 billion budget deficit,</p>
<p>if we had not implemented other reforms that were opposed by the</p>
<p>   Labor Party then the Australian economy would have been buffeted</p>
<p>   and knocked around by the Asian economic developments of the second</p>
<p>   half of last year.</p>
<p>It is also appropriate that I inform you that I will be visiting</p>
<p>   Malaysia from the 22 to 24 February and then Papua New Guinea from</p>
<p>   25 to 26 February. And that Mr Downer, the Foreign Minister, will</p>
<p>   visit Jakarta early next week from the 25 to 27 January. In both</p>
<p>   cases the visits are appropriate and directly relevant to the continuing</p>
<p>   very close and important linkages that we have with the countries</p>
<p>   of the Asia-Pacific region. Given the difficulties of our friends</p>
<p>   and neighbours in the region this is not a time to reduce our association</p>
<p>   with the countries of that region, rather it is a time to extend</p>
<p>   the helping hand, to demonstrate, as we did in relation to the assistance</p>
<p>   we gave for Thailand and for Indonesia and also for Korea, the fact</p>
<p>   that Australia is a good regional neighbour. And most importantly</p>
<p>   we are strong enough and economically powerful enough to give assistance</p>
<p>   to these countries. It would have been otherwise if our opponents</p>
<p>   policies had been in force we would have been in a weaker position</p>
<p>   and we would not have been able to extend a helping hand to those</p>
<p>   countries.</p>
<p>Could I just before taking your questions, could I just take the</p>
<p>   opportunity, on behalf, I know of all Australians to congratulate</p>
<p>   the Australian swimming team for the absolutely remarkable performance</p>
<p>   that all of them put in at the championships in Perth. It was, as</p>
<p>   so many have remarked, probably the finest performance at a World</p>
<p>   Championship by an Australian swimming team for 30 or 40 years,</p>
<p>   perhaps ever. And to all of them I extend, on behalf of the Australian</p>
<p>   public, my very warm thanks.</p>
<p>And might I on a less happy note, say that I know that most Australians,</p>
<p>   particularly those who have an affinity with surfing would have</p>
<p>   been very touched by the tragic death of Mr Kelly, the Vice-President</p>
<p>   of the Maroubra Surf Club. And it is a reminder of the immense sacrifice</p>
<p>   that so many Australians in voluntary effort make towards making</p>
<p>   many aspects of the Australian life safe for the men and women of</p>
<p>   this country. And I know that I speak for all Australians in expressing</p>
<p>   my sympathy to his family, to the club, to the surf lifesaving movement</p>
<p>   of Australia. And once again on behalf of Australians I salute the</p>
<p>   tremendous voluntary efforts of that magnificent organisation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On the Asian currency crisis. Will the Government consider underwriting</p>
<p>   trade contracts for Australian exporters?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There are some considerations in relation to insurance that we</p>
<p>   will be looking at, and obviously we will take a sensible approach</p>
<p>   which is helpful to our relations with the countries involved.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will that be for both Korea and Indonesia as well?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is a matter that is before the Cabinet and beyond saying what</p>
<p>   I have said I am not in a position to answer.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is it of concern the way the exporters are saying that some of</p>
<p>   their deals are drying up?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Their deals would have dried up a lot more if this country had</p>
<p>   not been seen as economically strong. This country has weathered</p>
<p>   the Asian melt-down far better than would have been the case if</p>
<p>   other policies had prevailed. The domestic economy is very strong</p>
<p>   indeed and that is a direct result of the measures that we took</p>
<p>   in 1996 and 1997, all of which I might say, was strenuously opposed</p>
<p>   by the Mr Beazley.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You have had Treasury officials and other officials looking at</p>
<p>   the impact on the Australian economy of the Asian crisis. Have they</p>
<p>   given you any indication of any need to change the mid-year fiscal</p>
<p>   outlook?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So there will be no changes to those forecasts?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look there will be another review. I mean, we had a mid-year review,</p>
<p>   we don't change that. We will obviously bring out another review</p>
<p>   at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, you talk about extending a helping hand. What have you</p>
<p>   got in mind for Malaysia when you go to visit there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Malaysia's position, of course, has been a little different</p>
<p>   from that of Indonesia, Korea and Thailand and therefore the question</p>
<p>   of a package similar to what was put in place in relation to those</p>
<p>   countries does not obtain.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On another matter Prime Minister. The ALP has left a way open for</p>
<p>   a popularly elected President in its republican model decided on</p>
<p>   this morning. Do you think that is a dangerous idea?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am very surprised that the Leader of the Opposition hasn't</p>
<p>   declared his position on it. I thought he was a man who was willing</p>
<p>   to state his views on any issue, where they seem to have great trouble</p>
<p>   telling his party who it's President ought to be. He spent</p>
<p>   a great deal of his speech talking about leadership. If he is such</p>
<p>   a strong leader of his </p>
<p>party why doesn't he just tell them in plain terms that Barry</p>
<p>   Jones ought to be the President of the party for the next 12 months.</p>
<p>   I mean, we like Barry, we have even made him Deputy Chairman of</p>
<p>   the Convention. We all know that Kim likes Barry. Why doesn't</p>
<p>   he just tell them to choose Barry and why doesn't he get Mr</p>
<p>   Sword to withdraw?</p>
<p>I think an elected Presidency would undermine Australia's</p>
<p>   Parliamentary system of Government. I am not reluctant to state</p>
<p>   my view on that. I am prepared to say to the Australian people,</p>
<p>   despite the fact that surveys suggest that there is a lot of support</p>
<p>   for an elected President, I am prepared to say to the Australian</p>
<p>   people that if you want to fundamentally undermine the present Parliamentary</p>
<p>   system of Government, have an elected President. But then perhaps</p>
<p>   I shouldn't be talking about this issue because I heard Mr</p>
<p>   Beazley say on the radio this morning that the republic and Wik</p>
<p>   were second order issues. I might remind the Australian people that</p>
<p>   both of those second order issues were put on the political agenda</p>
<p>   by Kim Beazley and Paul Keating.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, will the Government consider any measures to boost Australia's</p>
<p>   tourism marketing in South East Asia given the drop-off in numbers?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It would be a very big mistake for anybody to engage in a knee-jerk</p>
<p>   reaction about what has happened to this or that industry as a result</p>
<p>   of the developments in the Asia-Pacific region. The tourist industry</p>
<p>   is a very resilient industry, it can focus very heavily on other</p>
<p>   markets. I am not going to get into the business of giving running</p>
<p>   responses to the understandable entreaties of different industry</p>
<p>   groups when they believe their circumstances may have been adversely</p>
<p>   affected. We were told a few months ago that the utterances of the</p>
<p>   Member for Oxley had damaged our tourist industry. That didn't</p>
<p>   turn out to be the case. I am not suggesting that the situation</p>
<p>   is analogous to that, but I simply make the point, that you shouldn't</p>
<p>   react in a knee-jerk fashion to these particular matters.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard would the Government consider talking to Australian banks</p>
<p>   about rolling over their loans to South Korean and Indonesian companies?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What the Australian Government did at an official level was to</p>
<p>   give assistance as part of the IMF package. The question of the</p>
<p>   relationship between commercial banks and borrowers of those banks,</p>
<p>   as always, is a matter between the banker and the customer. We were</p>
<p>   strong enough and we were willing to provide assistance to Indonesia,</p>
<p>   to Thailand and to Korea. We did it in an official way through participation</p>
<p>   in the IMF package and we believe that is the appropriate way in</p>
<p>   which to provide assistance to countries in the region that stand</p>
<p>   in need of help.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, we are heading into an election year probably. Will</p>
<p>   Cabinet look at the timing of the election? Specifically will you</p>
<p>   be discussing the timing of the release of your tax policy?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. But I can say now that you have reminded me of tax. I can say</p>
<p>   something about taxation. I noticed when he was interviewed yesterday</p>
<p>   on one of your programmes, that Mr Beazley said that he was going</p>
<p>   to reach back in that time-honoured Labor antidote when you have</p>
<p>   got a fiscal hole and that is you start talking about taxing the</p>
<p>   rich. Well I have got to say to Mr Beazley that that is the oldest</p>
<p>   thimble and pea trick in the political business. For example, if</p>
<p>   you put a five per cent tax surcharge on everybody in Australia</p>
<p>   who earns over $100,000 a year, you would collect the princely sum</p>
<p>   equal to half of one per cent of the total amount of revenue collected</p>
<p>   by the Federal Treasury at the present time. And that is $650 million</p>
<p>   is the extra money you would collect. And that is half of one per</p>
<p>   cent of the total amount of money collected by the Federal Treasury</p>
<p>   at present.</p>
<p>So I want you to keep that in your mind when over the next few</p>
<p>   months the elastic of that generalised promise is stretched beyond</p>
<p>   breaking point by the Labor Party whenever it is asked: well how</p>
<p>   are you going to pay for this or that promise? Tax the rich. Well</p>
<p>   even if you do tax the rich, by the tune of putting a 5 per cent</p>
<p>   tax surcharge on everybody earning $100,000 a year, then what you</p>
<p>   will be doing is collecting no more than another $650 million or</p>
<p>   half of one per cent of the total amount of revenue the Treasury</p>
<p>   now collects.</p>
<p>So perhaps Mr Beazley will have to invoke the definition of the</p>
<p>   rich of the latest convert to the Labor Party, Cheryl Kernot, who</p>
<p>   believes that anybody who earns more than $50,000 a year falls into</p>
<p>   that category.</p>
<p>We are going to hear quite a bit about soaking the rich but let's</p>
<p>   understand that not only is it a dubious proposition, economically,</p>
<p>   but in terms of providing the revenue to fund the promises that</p>
<p>   the Labor Party is going to make over the months ahead and has already</p>
<p>   made, it will be an abysmal and total failure.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, assuming that the Skase tapes are authentic, do you</p>
<p>   think they vindicate the Government's decision to keep funding</p>
<p>   the efforts to get the money back?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think what the Government has done in relation to pursuing Mr</p>
<p>   Skase is absolutely correct. It is appropriate that resources be</p>
<p>   spent in pursuing somebody who plumbed the depths of robbing ordinary</p>
<p>   Australians and as far as I am concerned I think there is a great</p>
<p>   feeling in the Australian community that this man ought to be pursued</p>
<p>   with all of the vigour which is available of the law, both here</p>
<p>   in Australia, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>I can't comment on the individual tapes because I have neither</p>
<p>   heard them nor do I have any direct evidence of authenticity and</p>
<p>   I am not going to comment on them. But I strongly support the measures</p>
<p>   that have been taken by Mr Donnelly to recover resources belonging</p>
<p>   to Mr Skase and his family and also to otherwise bring him and the</p>
<p>   members of that family to justice.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, are you concerned that international financial</p>
<p>   markets tend to lump Australia in with some of the other countries</p>
<p>   in the region, particularly in terms of dealing with our dollar?</p>
<p>   Is that a problem?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't want to talk about the level of the Australian dollar.</p>
<p>   I never have. I don't think it is appropriate to do so and</p>
<p>   I don't intend to break my rule. There is no doubt, in my mind,</p>
<p>   that foreign investors know the strength of the Australian economy.</p>
<p>   They know that it will probably be the fastest growing economy in</p>
<p>   the industrialised world this year. They know that it will probably</p>
<p>   out perform the G7. They know that if another Government had been</p>
<p>   in power it would not have been nearly as strong as it is now and</p>
<p>   the strength of the Australian economy and the extent to which we</p>
<p>   have been able to withstand the impact of the Asian downturn is</p>
<p>   very strong evidence of the wisdom of the policies that my Government</p>
<p>   has pursued since March of last year.</p>
<p>I had a quick read of Mr Beazley's speech to the ALP Conference</p>
<p>   this morning and I didn't notice any apology to the Australian</p>
<p>   people for the $10.5 billion deficit that he left behind. I didn't</p>
<p>   notice any apology from Mr Beazley for the vulnerable state in which</p>
<p>   he left the Australian economy nor any apology for the fact that</p>
<p>   if his policies had been in force at the end of last year the Australian</p>
<p>   economy would now be weaker, the employment prospects less and the</p>
<p>   outlook for investment and the outlook for Australians, generally,</p>
<p>   would be a lot poorer and a lot weaker.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Just going back to the start of the announcement, what is the reason</p>
<p>   behind the trip to Malaysia and Papua New Guinea, what message will</p>
<p>   you be taking to those...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, this will be my first visit to Malaysia as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>   In a sense it reciprocates the hospitality that I extended to Dr</p>
<p>   Mahatir last year but it is appropriate given the close relations</p>
<p>   between the two countries, the developments in the region and my</p>
<p>   desire to maintain the association between the two countries that</p>
<p>   the visit take place.</p>
<p>I think it is also important that I should visit Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>   The Bougainville peace talks have reached a very important stage.</p>
<p>   Australia is playing a very helpful and very constructive role in</p>
<p>   those peace talks and it will be an opportunity for me to renew</p>
<p>   my dialogue with the Papua New Guinea Prime Minister.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Just coming back to the economy. Some of the market economists</p>
<p>   are saying that we underestimate or we are being to complacent about</p>
<p>   the taxable income with the Asian turmoil, particularly in the next</p>
<p>   financial year. Have you had any advice on that matter?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. I don't believe we are the least bit complacent. In fact all</p>
<p>   of our actions are the epitome of a Government that took cautionary</p>
<p>   measures when it came to office. </p>
<p>I mean we were criticised for cutting the budget deficit. Mr Beazley</p>
<p>   reminds me of somebody who sets fire to the building and then says</p>
<p>   don't bother to call the fire brigade and then when it does</p>
<p>   arrive, he tries to cut off the hose and then says it would have</p>
<p>   burnt itself out any way. </p>
<p>I mean we were criticised by the Labor Party for cutting the budget</p>
<p>   deficit, we were criticised by others for being too severe in the</p>
<p>   measures that we have taken but if we had not fire proofed the Australian</p>
<p>   economy in the way that we did we would now be facing a far bleaker</p>
<p>   outlook than is the case.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you make of Mr Keating's comments last week....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>When he boasted about inflicting pain on the Australian people?</p>
<p>   It was just a reminder of one of the reasons why he was so resoundingly</p>
<p>   rejected in March of 1996. I mean it was an extraordinary comment.</p>
<p>   He was actuas an extraordinary comment.</p>
<p>   He was actually boasting about the fact that he hurt people. And</p>
<p>   his Deputy Prime Minister is the current Leader of the Labor Party.</p>
