    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased today to announce a significant joint initiative between Australia and Malaysia to improve teacher training and boost literacy in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>This new joint initiative will see around 30 master teacher trainers trained in modern teaching methods.</p>
<p>These master trainers will be trained in Malaysia and then return to Afghanistan and pass on these new skills to other teacher trainers.</p>
<p>Literacy levels in Afghanistan are amongst the lowest in the world and a key priority for the Afghanistan Government is to boost literacy as fast as possible.</p>
<p>This master teacher training will make a significant contribution to helping the Government of Afghanistan achieve this important goal.</p>
<p>This joint initiative is a new chapter of cooperation between Australia and Malaysia working together to achieve a more secure and stable Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The detailed arrangements for this new joint initiative will be finalised following consultations between AusAID and the Governments of Malaysia and Afghanistan over the next two weeks.</p>
