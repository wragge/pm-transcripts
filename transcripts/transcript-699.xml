FOR PRESS HOWAIRD FLOREY LABORATORIES<br />
UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that the<br />
Commonwealth had decided to contribute Å“ F100,000 towards<br />
the cost of the new Howard Florey Laboratories just<br />
completed for the Department of Physiology at the<br />
University of Melbourne.<br />
The Prime Minister explained that this contribution<br />
was additional to the amount already allocated to the<br />
University by the Commonwealth for the triennium 1961-63.<br />
A pleasing feature of the establishment of the new<br />
Laboratories was the part played by United States aid.<br />
This was at once a further instance of enlightened<br />
philanthropy from United States research foundations<br />
and a heartening tribute to the quality of Australian<br />
medical science.<br />
Ba ckground Note<br />
Sir George Paton Vice-Chancellor of the<br />
University of Melbourne is expected to make a statement<br />
today on the Howard Florey Laboratories. </p>
