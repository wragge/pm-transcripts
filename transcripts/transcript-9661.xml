OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CANBERRA<br />
The Prime Minister has sent the following letter, dated 7 July 1995, to Mr Christopher<br />
Edwards, Chairman of the National Small Business Forum.<br />
Over recent months issues affecting small business have become a particular<br />
focus for community and media attention.<br />
Sma business operates within an especially competitive and dynamic<br />
environment and from time to time decisions of various Governments can have a<br />
significant impact on operations. Interest rates and inflationary pressures are<br />
probably the most important macroeconomic matters for small business and in<br />
that area I am proud of my Governent's achievements. But, at any point, there<br />
will always be a range of more specific concerns facing small business and,<br />
accordingly, Senator Schacht, the Minister for Small Business, keeps me well<br />
informed on the issues raised at the Small Business Forum.<br />
One of those issues recently has been the legislation relating to unfair dismissals.<br />
I was pleased that the Government was able to announce the proposed changes<br />
to the unfair dismissals provisions of the Industrial Relations Act in the lead-up<br />
to the Forum held in June. I have been told that the proposals were well<br />
received by the members of the Forum and I am glad that we have been able to'<br />
respond to the concerns of the sector.<br />
A cooperative approach has been pursued by the Minister for Industrial<br />
Relations, Laurie Brereton, in consultation with his State counterparts, the<br />
ACTU and members of various employer groups. This demonstrates that the<br />
Government is committed to ensuring that not only do we have a system which<br />
provides workers with fair protection, but also an environment which is<br />
conducive to pnivate sector activity and employment growth. We are confident<br />
that the new unfair dismissal arrangements will mean that the system is<br />
reasonable and balanced for both employees and employers.<br />
It was also with the interests of small business in mind that the Government<br />
introduced the Corporate Law Simplification Bill. Its essential motivation is to<br />
reduce both the paperwork burden for small companies and the cost of<br />
compliance with Government regulation.<br />
I was disappointed, therefore, that the Senate failed to pass the Corporate Law<br />
Simplification Bill during the final week of the Budget session. The Government<br />
is commnitted to providing easier and cheaper access to the legal system for small<br />
business, and the provisions contained within the Bill would have done just that. 205 </p>
<p>It is difficult to understand why the Opposition prevented the passing of the<br />
legislation, especially when it knew that failure to pass the Bill in time for<br />
commencement at the start of the 1995/ 96 financial year would delay<br />
implementation of the legislation for a significant time. If I was in small business<br />
I would be wondering why Mr Howard and the Coalition have chosen to deny<br />
small business access to a simpler and cheaper legal system until at least I July<br />
1996. This action punishes around 850,000 small businesses in Australia and<br />
contradicts starkly the Opposition's claims to be red-tape cutters and to have a<br />
special concern for your sector.<br />
I welcome the role the Small Business Forum's continues to play in raising<br />
matters of concern and exploring avenues to address them. Your discussions<br />
with Senator Schacht form a valuable input into the Government's current<br />
consideration of our response to the Gardini Review of the Franchising Code of<br />
Practice as well as options for addressing small business concerns with<br />
' unconscionable conduct' as it relates to the Trade Practices Act.<br />
I understand that the Small Business Forum now has an agreed position<br />
concerning the effectiveness of the ' unconscionable conduct' provisions of the<br />
Act, and has called upon the Government to consider strengthening the<br />
provisions. Given that this has been a particularly difficult issue for the Forum to<br />
deal with, this should be seen as an important achievement.<br />
The Government will seek to ensure that a cooperative and responsive approach<br />
is adopted in addressing both the Franchising Code of Practice and the issue of<br />
unconscionable conduct. We seek solutions which will enhance the business<br />
environment for small and medium enterprises. That is, after all, our common<br />
objective. ENDS<br />
