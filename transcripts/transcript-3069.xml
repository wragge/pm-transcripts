EMBARGO: 9.00 P. Ml.<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. EG, WHITLAM, MP,,<br />
AT THE LORD MAYOR'S BANQUET, MELBOURNE TOWN HALL,<br />
FRIDAY, 9 NOVEMBER 1973<br />
IT IS JUST ONE WEEK SINCE I WAS SPEAKING AT A BANQUET<br />
IN THE GREAT HALL OF THE PEOPLE IN PEKING, Now I AM IN THE GREAT<br />
HALL OF THE PEOPLE IN MELBOURNE. I ASSURE YOU I FEEL PERFECTLY<br />
AT HOME IN BOTH THESE GREAT SEATS OF POWER, AMONG THE REPRESENTATIVES<br />
OF THESE TWO POWERFUL RULING ELITES. ONE FINDS THE SAME WARMING<br />
INFLUENCES OF FOOD AND WINE TO BRIDGE THE GREAT GAP IN IDEOLOGY.<br />
ONE FINDS IN PEKING, IN MELBOURNE, THE SAME PERMANENCE, THE SAME<br />
SOLIDARITY, THE SAME SELF-CONFIDENCE WHICH CHARACTERISES ALL GREAT<br />
ESTABLISHMENTS. THE MANDARINS OF MELBOURNE ARE AT LEAST AS FAMOUS<br />
AS THOSE OF PEKING. AND ONE INDEED FEELS SOMETHING OF AN<br />
INTERLOPER, A MERE PRIME MINISTER AND ONE FROM SYDNEY AT THAT.<br />
I COULDN'T HELP BUT FEEL, LAST YEAR, AS I SAT LISTENING TO MY<br />
DISTINGUISHED PREDECESSOR, THAT A PRIME MINISTER FROM SYDNEY EVEN<br />
A CONSERVATIVE ONE WAS NOT EXACTLY TAKEN TO THE HEARTS OF THE<br />
MEMBERS OF THE MELBOURNE ESTABLISHMENT. ONE IS MADE VERY AWARE<br />
PRIME MINISTERS COME AND PRIME MINISTERS GO BUT YOU GO ON FOREVER.<br />
NEVERTHELESS, THERE HAS BEEN SINCE YOUR LAST BANQUET<br />
A CHANGE IN AUSTRALIA'S GOVERNMENT. As I LOOK AROUND, I SEE HOW<br />
MANFULLY YOU ARE BEARING UP UNDER THE WHIPS AND ARROWS OF OUTRAGEOUS<br />
FORTUNE WHICH HAS PLACED THE SOCIALISTS IN CANBERRA. I MIGHT EVEN<br />
SAY YOU LOOK AMAZINGLY PROSPEROUS AND INDEED IF I CAN BELIEVE THE<br />
FINANCIAL PAGES AND THE ADVERTISING PAGES OF THE GREAT MELBOURI\ E<br />
DAILIES, MOST OF YOU ARE, AND I CAN TELL YOU WITH ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE,<br />
THAT YOU WILL REMAIN SO AS LONG AS I REMAIN PRIME MINISTER, I DON'T<br />
REALLY THINK ITS DIFFICULT TO LEARN TO LIVE WITH EACH OTHER, AND I<br />
THINK YOU MIGHT EVEN COME TO ENJOY IT. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I FOR INSTANCE, FIND I CAN LIVE WITH YOU PREMIER. I HAD<br />
OCCASION TO SAY YESTERDAY IN REFERENCE TO MY HAVING GIVEN UP THE<br />
FOREIGN AFFAIRS PORTFOLIO THIS WEEK THAT WE HAD GOT RIGHT THE GREAT<br />
AREAS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES, WITH<br />
JAPAN, WITH CHINA, WITH INDONESIA, INDEED, THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT<br />
UNSETTLED AREA OF OUR DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH A HOSTILE POWER IS<br />
THE GOVERNMENT OF QUEENSLAND. BUT YOU PREMIER WILL EVEN COME TO<br />
DINNER WITH ME. I KNOW HE HAS DIFFICULTY WITH SOME OF HIS<br />
MINISTERS, BUT WHEN WE SPEAK TOGETHER, AND WHEN HIS MINISTERS SPEAK<br />
WITH MINE, WE CAN WORK TOGETHER.<br />
THE MOST IMPORTANT AREA OF CO-OPERATION CONCERNS THE<br />
PLACES WHERE MOST AUSTRALIANS, WHERE MOST VICTORIANS LIVE IN<br />
THE CITIES AND CENTRES, AND IN THE AREA OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SO WELL<br />
REPRESENiED HERE TONIGHT. WE HAVE THE BOLD SOCIAL EXPERIMENT IN<br />
IMPROVING THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT AND OFFERING A GREATER CHOICE TO<br />
THE PEOPLE OF VICTORIA AT ALBURY-WODONGA. WE ARE CO-OPERATING<br />
WITH THE VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT, IN ITS OWN PLANS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT<br />
OF GEELONG AS A GROWTH CENTRE. THE PREPARATIONS ARE PROCEEDING<br />
JOINTLY AND BOTH GOVERNMENTS HOPE WE WILL BE ABLE TO EASE THE<br />
PROBLEM OF MELBOURNE GROWTH EARLY AND SUBSTANTIALLY, WE HAVE MADE<br />
A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AVAILABLE THIS YEAR FOR ACQUIRING STRATEGIC<br />
AREAS OF LAND FOR URBAN RECREATION AND CONSERVATION AT W4ESTERN-PORT<br />
BAY, THE MORNINGTON PENINSULA AND THE DANDENONG RANGES, WE ARE<br />
CO-OPERATING IN ESTABLISHING A CONTINUING MAJOR PROGRAM TO RETARD<br />
THE RISE IN RESIDENTIAL LAND PRICES IN MELBOURNE. WHEN THE<br />
COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY WE HAVE ESTABLISHED ON THE ' ATIONAL ESTATE<br />
REPORTS, WE CONTEMPLATE IMMEDIATE ACTION IN CONSULTATION WITH<br />
VICTORIA TO FOLLOW UP IN VIGOROUS SUPPORT OF THE STATE'S NATIONAL<br />
TRUST AND PRIVATE CONSERVATION ORGANISATIONS, </p>
<p>4 -3-<br />
DISCUSSIONS ARE NOW WELL ADVANCED WITH THE VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
AND LOCAL COUNCILS ON SPENDING TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN<br />
THE DEPRIVED WESTERN SECTORS OF MELBOURNE, LOCAL COUNCILS HAVE<br />
BEEN ACTIVE IN FORMING AMONG57THEMSELVES A ', ESTERN ; REGIONS COMMISSION.<br />
11E ARE ALSO WORKING WITH THE VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT ON A'JOINT<br />
STUDY ON THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE PROVISION<br />
OF LOCAL SERVICES ON. A STATE-WIDE BASIS. I PERHAPS SHOULDN'IT<br />
MENTION SO INDELICATE A SUBJECT HERE BUT WE ARE WELL ADVANCED IN<br />
REACHING OUR GOAL OF OVERCOMING THE BACKLOG IN SEWERAGE BY 1980.<br />
IREMEMBER WHEN I FIRST HAD THE TEMERITY TO RAISE. THIS AS A NATIONAL<br />
ISSUE, JOHN GORTON SAID I SOUNDED LIKE A jIAYOR OR A-SHIRE PRESIDENT<br />
RATHER THAN A NATIONAL LEADER. IDON'T KNOW IF I WAS MEANT TO BE<br />
INSULTED, BUT I WASN'T. THE NEW GRANTS COMMISSION IS IN BEING<br />
TO HELP MEET THE GROWING NEEDS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND TO REDUCE<br />
INEQUALITY BETWEEN REGIONS,<br />
SO THERE HAS BEEN THIS WIDE RANGE OF CO-OPERATION ON<br />
URBAN AFFAIRS. WHAT WE HAVE TRIED TO DO IS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE<br />
CONVENTIONAL IDEA THAT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND<br />
THE STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE LIMITED TO THE FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP<br />
IN TERMS OF SECTION 96 OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT BRINGS TO THE CONFERENCE TABLE MUCH MORE THAN ITS<br />
CHEQUE BOOK. IT BRINGS NATIONAL ATTITUDES, A SENSE OF NATIONAL<br />
OBJECTIVES AND PRIORITIES. IT BRINGS NATIONAL ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT<br />
AND NATIONAL ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES, OF COURSE OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS<br />
DON'T ALWAYS AGREE, BUT ALREADY IN THIS YEAR OF 1073 TII'-HAS BEEN<br />
ESTABLISHED A NEW AND EFFECTIVE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND<br />
VICTORIA IN A CONCERTED THRUST TOWARDS SOLVING OR AT LEAST REDUCING<br />
THE GREAT PROBLEMS OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT, SO CENTRAL TO THE WELLBEING<br />
OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR PEOPLE. </p>
<p>-1t<br />
I MIGHT JUST SAY THIS: ONE OF THE REASONS WHY MANY<br />
PEOPLE, PERHAPS EVEN SOME OF YOU, FEEL DISCOMFITED BY THE PROCESS<br />
OF CHANGE, IS JUST THAT FUNDAMENTAL FACT THAT THERE WAS NO CHANGE<br />
FOR SO LONG, THAT THERE WAS NO CHANGE FOR 23 YEARS. IN THIS WE<br />
WERE UNIQUE AMONG THE ENGLISH SPEAKING DEMOCRACIES. THERE HAD TO<br />
BE CHANGE AND PROBABLY THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MANY OF THE SAME CHANGES<br />
MADE, PARTICULARLY ON MATTERS AFFECTING RESOURCES AND INVESTMENT<br />
EVEN IF THE GOVERNMENT HAD NOT CHANGED LAST DECEMBER. THE SEEMING<br />
STABILITY OF THE PAST WAS LARGELY ILLUSORY, ARTIFICIAL,<br />
REFLECTING AN ESSENTIALLY ABNORMAL, THOUGH LONG ENDURING, POLITICAL<br />
SITUATION. IT IS CHANGE WHICH IS NORMAL AND NATURAL IN<br />
PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY. I THINK IF YOU ACCEPT THAT BASIC FACT,<br />
YOU WILL FIND LIFE UNDER LABOR PREDICTABLE AND REFRESHING AND<br />
IT MAY EVEN BE, AS I CERTAINLY FIND IT, EXCITING AND<br />
EXHILARATING FOR US ALL AS AUSTRALIANS. </p>
