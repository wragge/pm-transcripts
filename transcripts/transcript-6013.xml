EMBAlCO:<br />
K PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 6 FEBRUARY 1983<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
T have explained over the last week why the election is<br />
' important and why it is being held at this time. In the last<br />
day or two we will have all-read reports in the paper that the<br />
Labor Party would fight this election on a progarn of reconciliation.<br />
There are one or two questions I would like to ask about that. If<br />
the LAbor Party wants reconciliation, why is the Labor Party<br />
itself so divisive, why does it threaten the consensus we have<br />
had for a long while on defence and education and above all., on<br />
the wage pause?<br />
The Federal Government successfully negotiated the wage pause<br />
with all State Governments, Liberal, Labor and National Party.<br />
it is rare for such a consensus to be reached. But the pause has<br />
not only been supported by every Government, it is respected<br />
and supported by the majority of Australians. Everyone knows<br />
that the $ 300 million the Conunonwealth alone will save in<br />
wages will provide jobs and the pause will help to make our<br />
industries competitive and profitable.<br />
A week or so ago even Mr Hayden recognised economic reality<br />
and gave grudging support to the pause. Then the unions, or<br />
possibly Mr Hawke, cracked the whip and Mr Hayden returnecd to<br />
full opposition to the wage pause. By opposing the pause the<br />
Federal Labor Party and the trade unions the two cannot be<br />
separated are the odd ones out. Federal Labor voted against<br />
it in Parliament in both Houses and since then Labor's Deputy<br />
Leader has incited people to take industrial action against the<br />
pause. When asked whether Labor would support industrial<br />
action, the Deputy Leader said on 27 January " yes, you have<br />
got to do that"..<br />
Mr Hawke's statement last Friday that the wage pause would<br />
continuie until a national economic summit is called, is<br />
meaningless. The pause would only continue for a week or so,<br />
because the summit would be his first act.<br />
it would seem clear from everything Labor has said that it<br />
in fact supports the 8% claim by the oil workers. The Deputy<br />
Leader of the opposition made that clear when he said the unions<br />
were entitled to take industrial action, yet the key people in<br />
the dispute the electricians on strike are earning up to<br />
$ 30,000 a year. If these demands were met it would start a ne~ w<br />
major wage round, undermininq the whole basis of the wage pause. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Now, in these circumstances the Federal Labor Party cannot turn<br />
around an. d say everyone else is being confrontationist and it<br />
is the Only Party capble of reconciliation, because the<br />
reverse is the truth. It. is the Federal Labor Party which i,<br />
confronting all eight Governments. It is the Federal Labor<br />
Party which is being destructive. It is the Federal Labor<br />
Party which is breaking the unity, the cor: nensus of Australia.<br />
The ANZUS Treaty has been regarded as an integral part of<br />
Australia's defence for decades and it has been supported<br />
by all major pcrties. But the Victorian Government has made it<br />
perfectly plain it does not welcome visits to Victorian ports<br />
by American nuclear ships. As I have often explained, that<br />
means keeping all American ships out of Victorian ports because<br />
by saying whether their ships are nuclear armed or not, the<br />
United States would be giving vital defence secrets to the<br />
Soviet Union and they obviously cannot do that. The Victorian<br />
Government's attitude has been reinforced by the Deputy<br />
Leader of the Federal Opposition who has said that " we cannot<br />
allow Australia's defence forces to become inter-linked with<br />
those of the United States".<br />
The Commonwealth Government had to press the Victorian Government<br />
very firmly and insist that the visits would continue to take<br />
place, but the Federal Labor made no effort to stop the Victorian<br />
Goverment and if Labor took that view in Government it would<br />
make it impossible for the Americans to fulfill their obligations<br />
under ANZUS. The American alliance is a long-standing policy<br />
which is acceptable to nearly all Austalians. Why then does<br />
Labor challenge some essential elements of it? What sort of<br />
ally are we if we say to the United States, we want your help<br />
but your ships cannot visit our ports?<br />
If Labor believes in reconciliation, why does it threaten<br />
to take away the inalienable right of every child to some<br />
Government support for his or her education, a right that had<br />
come to be accepted by all political parties? Labor is thus<br />
creating insecurity and uncertainty and is denying a choice<br />
in education to thousands of families who are not as well-off<br />
as some others.<br />
These are three issues on which the Labor Party is seeking<br />
to breach what, without them, would be a full national consensus.<br />
One of the reasons why the Labor Party is divisive is that they<br />
are a party of factions, and one of the strongest of those<br />
factions is the Socialist Left, totally opposed to almost<br />
everything that Australia stands for. If the Labor Party wants<br />
reconciliation, why do they have in the platform a commitment to<br />
turning Australia into a republic? Why do they want to tear<br />
up our flag and get a new one? That is a further commitment in<br />
their platform. Why do they raise these issues if they want<br />
reconciliation? I don't suppose they will want to talk about them<br />
during this campaign, but as platform items, all Labor members of<br />
the Labor Party would be committed to put them into effect.<br />

<p>-3-<br />
Agaiiist the backgiound of their recent actions and committed<br />
policies, their slogan about bringing Australia together is<br />
total humbug. Labor's internal divisions make it very difficult<br />
for them to reach decisions or, policies. For example, they<br />
oppose the wage pause even though they have absolutely no<br />
economic policy of their own. I asked a large number of people<br />
last week i f they could name one single policy of the Labor<br />
Party which is relevant to the current economic circumstances<br />
of Australia. One or two said " oh, they would call a conference",<br />
but a conference isn't a policy. We consult with people all<br />
the time, the unions, management, the State Governments. Tt is<br />
a continuing process, but it is not a policy.<br />
Thev fa ct that nobody could think of a single Labor policy<br />
which is relevant to the Australian economy in 1983, and that<br />
Labor offers no more than a threat to the national consensus<br />
says something very fundamental about this Labor Party. It<br />
shows that not only is the Labor Party thoroughly divided,<br />
divisive and confrontationist in its approach, but also<br />
that a Labor Government would lead to enormous insecurity<br />
for Australian families.<br />
If anybody wanted to risk the future and elect a Labor Government,<br />
it would be the greatest gamble in the history of their own<br />
lives. </p>
