CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY WA BRANCH<br />
RURAL AND REGIONAL SEMINAR<br />
BUNBURY 6 AUGUST 1988<br />
At the outset I want to congratulate the West Australian<br />
branch of the Australian Labor Party on its initiative in<br />
organising this biennial seminar over the last six years,<br />
and to thank them for inviting me to deliver the keynote<br />
address. This seminar priovides a valuable forum for Labor to outline<br />
to Party members and to the wider community the breadth of<br />
its vision for the five million Australians who live outside<br />
the major metropolitan cities.<br />
Those five million Australians make up less than one-third<br />
of the Australian population but they are engaged in<br />
producing almost 80 per cent of all the goods we export.<br />
They are, and they will remain, the backbone of the<br />
Australia's trade effort for the foreseeable future.<br />
This seminar is timely, because it allows us to focus, as we<br />
enter the third century of Australian nationhood, on what<br />
Labor has been able to do, and on what we must continue to<br />
do, to ensure the continued efficiency and strength of our<br />
great primary industries.<br />
When I was first elected Prime Minister in 1983 1 promised<br />
to govern in the interests of all Australians.<br />
our record of achievements on behalf of Australia farmer s,<br />
and country dwellers generally, demonstrates that that<br />
pledge has been fully met.<br />
Since we came to office in March 1983 Australia has had to<br />
deal with a series of major economic difficulties, most<br />
particularly the collapse in our terms of trade in 1985 and<br />
1986. In each case our responses have made us a stronger<br />
country, a fairer country and a country far better equipped<br />
to face the future.<br />
Ahead of us lies the task of articulating and pursuing our<br />
vision of how we want Australia to grow in the 1990' s. 869 </p>
<p>2.<br />
our vision is an Australia which is fair, prosperous,<br />
competitive and independent.<br />
It is an Australia in which all our children will have a<br />
full and equal opportunity for the development of their<br />
talents within an education and training system which is<br />
both adequate and relevant;<br />
am Australia where those who are actively engaged in the<br />
productive processes will be equitably rewarded, and<br />
where those who are not so engaged the young, the<br />
elderly, the disabled will be decently sustained by<br />
the community;<br />
an Australia whose economy will be able to cope with the<br />
challenges of a rapidly changing world, enmeshed in our<br />
dynamic region;<br />
an Australia able to contribute to a better and to a<br />
more peaceful world;<br />
and it is an Australia in which our national goals of<br />
justice and fairness are achieved, not by the savage<br />
conflict of competing interests and groups but through<br />
national co-operation.<br />
These are goals for all Australians goals which are<br />
equally relevant to people living in the cities and to<br />
people living in the country.<br />
when we say we have created over one million jobs,<br />
when we say we have made a fairer taxation system, which<br />
will produce significant personal tax cuts next year,<br />
when we say we are bringing inflation down,<br />
when we say we are well down the track * to stabilising<br />
international debt,<br />
when we say we have lifted the number of kids staying on<br />
at secondary school from 36 per cent in 1982 to<br />
53 per cent in 1987 and we will achieve 65 per cent<br />
early in the 1990' s,<br />
when we say we have introduced a new Family Allowance<br />
Supplement which delivers unprecedented amounts of cash<br />
assistance to the poorest families among us,<br />
we are talking about major achievements for all Australians,<br />
wherever they live.<br />
One of the principal characteristics of this Government has<br />
been its capacity to achieve these reforms, not through the<br />
confrontation which was the hallmark of our predecessors,<br />
but through consultation.<br />
870 </p>
<p>3.<br />
And to a rural and regional audience such as this, I can<br />
make the proud claim that in few areas has this process of<br />
constructive consultation been more productive than in the<br />
Government's relations with the Country Women's Association.<br />
Let me take this opportunity to recognise in particular the<br />
leadership and drive that has been displayed by the outgoing<br />
President of the CWA, Dorothy Ross.<br />
It was at the suggestion of Dorothy Ross that the Government<br />
decided to conduct the recent invaluable survey on the needs<br />
of Australia's rural women.<br />
But I do not want in this keynote address merely to outline<br />
wl~ at we have already done. Because the road back to<br />
prosperity is a long one which will continue to involve hard<br />
decisions for some years to come.<br />
Nowhere is this more true than in the fundamental area of<br />
economic reconstruction an issue close to the heart of all<br />
Australians and especially to those involved in the rural<br />
economy. You know only to0 o well the vulnerability of our economy to<br />
sharp fluctuations in commodity prices.<br />
Reducing this vulnerability means tackling the task of<br />
reconstruction the hard and long term task of transforming<br />
our highly protected, and consequently relatively weak,<br />
manufacturing sector into one which can compete on world<br />
markets and win; and at the same time ensuring that<br />
agricultural and mining industries, already among the most<br />
efficient in the world, can withstand the sharp changes in<br />
exchange rates and market corruption which presently<br />
characterises the world's trading and financial systems.<br />
The response of conservative governments to this problem<br />
over the nearly three decades they ruled Australia since<br />
1949 was one of neglect and pretence: neglect of the<br />
fundamental realities of Australia's exposed world economic<br />
position and pretence that we could continue to support<br />
ourselves by simply hiding behind higher and higher tariff<br />
walls. Labor's response has been a determined and deliberate effort<br />
to provide the real answers.<br />
Iboth our international diplomatic initiatives and our<br />
reforms of domestic industry structures, we are ensuring<br />
that rural industries can continue to generate the national 871 </p>
<p>4. Au th<br />
do t r<br />
First, we are attacking world trading problems, and<br />
especially the problem of agricultural trade protection, as In<br />
the central element of our international diplomacy. This p<br />
has been a constant and frequent element of my own pr<br />
presentation of Australia's views in a number of<br />
international forums forums such as the EMF Symposium in In<br />
Davos, January 1987, the GATT in Geneva in October 198.7 and pa<br />
most recently during my trip to the United States in June. ef<br />
We are taking an active role in the Uruguay Round of the g<br />
multilateral Trade Negotiations expecially through ourI<br />
leadership of a major new force in trade negotiations which pr<br />
we initiated, the Cairns Group of fair trading nations.<br />
In each of these forums we have made it clear that there is<br />
a continuing threat to free and fair world trade.<br />
This threat comes from three main sources:<br />
the restrictive agricultural policies of the European<br />
Community and the USA's reaction to those policies,<br />
Japan's reluctance to open its markets,<br />
the large trade imbalances between the major economies,<br />
and their counterparts in inappropriate domestic fiscal<br />
policies.<br />
Efficient agricultural exporters, including Australia, are<br />
fed up with being caught in. the crossfire of competitive<br />
subsidisation by the US and the European Community. s<br />
We are also fed up with being illegitimately denied accessV<br />
to markets. a rE<br />
It is true that in recent times we have had some significant<br />
successes. For example, new arrangements have been<br />
negotiated with Japan which, over time, will dramatically it<br />
increase the Japanese market open to our beef producers. ti<br />
As a result, Japanese beef imports will grow at Bi<br />
60,000 tonnes a year for the next three years. k<br />
The Labor Government can point to a number of ways in which<br />
our trade diplomacy has produced tangible and lasting I<br />
results for Australian primary producers. a<br />
But the reality is that more needs to be achieved, quickly.<br />
So we will continue to press our case to free up markets and<br />
to ensure efficient producers like Australia get a fair go.<br />
The next opportunity for progress will be the mid term<br />
review of the current round of multilateral trade<br />
negotiations which will be held later this year in Montreal.<br />
872<br />
I </p>
<p>Australia will be seeking a commitment from other nations to<br />
the early winding back of agricultural subsidies as a<br />
downpayment on an overall strategy over time to eliminate<br />
trade-distorting subsidies.<br />
in all of my international presentations, I have made a<br />
point of saying that Australia is practising what we are<br />
preaching on tariff matters.<br />
In the May Economic Statement the Government announced a<br />
package of structural reforms designed to improve the<br />
efficiency of primary industries in the context of a more<br />
general package to speed our industrial reconstruction.<br />
I do not wish to be exhaustive, but our main objectives in<br />
primary industry have been threefold:<br />
to enhance the productive capacity and life<br />
opportunities of non-metropolitan Australians through,<br />
for example, improving the access and relevance of<br />
education and training programs;<br />
to develop a more responsive and productive industry<br />
structure by providing clearer market signals to<br />
producers and lower costs through substantial reductions<br />
in protection given to manufacturing; and<br />
to provide a more efficient infrastructure for primary<br />
industries, for example through more efficient grain<br />
handling arrangements, and increased funding for soil<br />
conservation and disease eradication.<br />
Economic reconstruction is too frequently seen as something<br />
which affects only the big cities and only the manufacturing<br />
sector. The truth is that rural industries and rural residents have<br />
a key role to play in the creation of new and better<br />
rewarded industries in Australia.<br />
if agriculture in Australia is to reach its true potential<br />
in our third century it will do so by positioning itself at<br />
the forefront of new technology.<br />
Biotechnological change is extremely rapid. industries that<br />
keep up with it will be the prosperous industries of the<br />
future..<br />
In order to keep our place as one of the world's foremost<br />
agricultural nations we must also become one of the foremost<br />
in research and development.<br />
To achieve this we must allow indeed encourage that<br />
industry to operate in the international market place. 873 </p>
<p>I<br />
6.<br />
I have every confidence that Australia has the potential to<br />
foster an agricultural research and development industry,<br />
selling its services into growing markets such as China, the<br />
Soviet Union, the Pacific Basin, and perhaps even Europe and<br />
the United States.<br />
The Government will continue to support research across a<br />
broad range of agricultural industries, We will continue to<br />
provide matching funds for research. Indeed we stand ready<br />
to contribute to each industry research fund up to 0.5% of<br />
the gross value of production in the particular industry.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, vif to<br />
At the outset of my address I said that this was a timely<br />
seminar-because, in our Bicentennial year, it focused our Thc<br />
attention on what we must do as a nation to ensure the go%<br />
continued efficiency and strength of our primary industries. ree<br />
This seminar is also timely in a more specific sense because<br />
it coincides with the renewed speculation from the<br />
conservative side of politics about the amalgamation of<br />
Liberal and National Parties.<br />
That leading National Party figures such as Doug Anthony and<br />
Peter Nixon should see merit in combining forces with the<br />
Liberal Party is a significant development in Australian<br />
politics. They have identified a number of trends in rural Australia<br />
that they argue put a question mark over the continued<br />
separate existence of the National Party.<br />
Let me quote one sentence from a recent newspaper article by<br />
Doug Anthony on the amalgamation issue which highlighted one<br />
of these trends:<br />
" The rural zeal against city dominance that-gave birth<br />
to the ( National) Party in earlier days has become more<br />
temperate with improvements in health, education,<br />
communications and rural industries."<br />
What Doug Anthony does not state explicitly but what<br />
obviously is at the root of his concern is that thoseimprovements<br />
in health, education, communications and rural<br />
industries have largely taken place since the conservatives<br />
have been out of office.<br />
They are improvements which have been delivered to rural and<br />
provincial Australians by State and Federal level Labor<br />
Governments. My colleague the minister for Primary Industries and Energy<br />
John Kerin has spoken about the way in which Australian<br />
politics has been characterised by " myths" about rural<br />
Australia 874 </p>
<p>the myth that the erstwhile Country Party is the<br />
" natural" party of the bush<br />
and the equally potent and dangerous myth that Labor has<br />
nothing of relevance to say to much of the rural<br />
constituency.<br />
I believe the achievements of Labor in Government, and our<br />
vision for the future, have comprehensively put those myths<br />
to rest.<br />
The truth of Australian politics today is that it is Labor<br />
governments, at the State and Federal levels, that have the<br />
real interests of rural and regional Australia at heart. 875 </p>
