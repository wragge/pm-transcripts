F76/ 94<br />
FOR PRESS 20 May 1976<br />
CHILD CARE<br />
In 1972 the LCP Government took the first steps at the Federal<br />
level to assist in the provision of adequate facilities for<br />
child care by introducing the Child Care Act 1972-73. The<br />
Government recognises the importance of children's services<br />
and strongly supports their continuation in co-operation with<br />
State Governments, local government, and community organisations<br />
and groups.<br />
$ 73.3 million will be allocated for this purpose in 1976/ 77,<br />
a reduction of $ 5.8 million from the Department's forward<br />
estimate. In real terms this figure is about the same as the<br />
estimated amount expended on children's services in 1975/ 76.<br />
The important point is the priority the Government is giving to<br />
the uDrovision of child care within the overall Program.<br />
Over the past three years pre-school education has had a<br />
considerable boost through the provision of substantial<br />
Commonwealth funds. Approximately 75% of Commonwealth<br />
expenditure on children's services has gone to pre-schools<br />
in the States.<br />
Many children from needy families however have been not only<br />
without the advantages of pre-school education but too often<br />
without the benefits of basic, adequate care. It is essential<br />
to concentrate the Government's resources in areas of greatest<br />
need, and the Government wishes to give greater emphasis to<br />
child care for children of needy families in the development of<br />
the Children's Services Program. ./ 2 </p>
<p>We expect this new emphasis in the Program will be generally<br />
welcome. In our negotiations with the States we will be<br />
examining means for meeting this priority within the level of<br />
funds provided. SUPPORT FOR THE ARTS<br />
The Government's intention is to continue actively to support<br />
the arts in Australia.<br />
The total bids for 1976/ 77 for the Australia Council, the<br />
Australian National Gallery, the Australian Film Commission<br />
and the Film and Television School amounted to $ 40.5 million.<br />
The Government will provide $ 33.8 million and this compares<br />
with a total original appropriation of $ 40.6 million for the<br />
current year. Unnecessary expenditure has been eliminated,<br />
but no important or worthwhile programs should suffer.<br />
The Australia Council's bid for 1976/ 77 has been reduced from<br />
$ 22.8 million to $ 19.4 million, exclusive of administration,<br />
and this compares with the 1975/ 76 appropriation of<br />
$ 23.7 million including administration. Major programs are<br />
expected to continue.<br />
The Australian National Gallery's bid has been reduced from<br />
$ 4.7 million to $ 3.5 million. In 1975/ 76 the appropriation<br />
was $ 5.8 million but the Government was able to hold<br />
expenditure to $ 2.6 million. Emphasis will continue to be<br />
given to collecting Australian art, and the amount provided<br />
in this area will be increased.<br />
The Government intends to encourage Australian film and<br />
television, but the Australian Film Commission's bid of<br />
$ 8.8 million has been cut to $ 7.4 million, slightly above the<br />
million provided this year.<br />
The Film and Television School sought $ 4.2 million which has<br />
been reduced to $ 3.5 million. The appropriation for 1975/ 76<br />
was $ 4.1 million. </p>
