Acting MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS<br />
FOR PRESS AUSTRALIA AID TO REFUGEES IN INDO-CHINA<br />
The Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Whitlam, announced<br />
today that a contribution of $ 200,000 was being given as an initial<br />
response to an urgent appeal from the International Committee of<br />
the Red Cross for funds to assist its Indo-China Operational Group<br />
in making purchases for refugees in Cambodia and Vietnam. A<br />
Wcheque for this amount was given to the President of ICRC by the<br />
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Senator Willesee, in Geneva yesterday.<br />
The Australian Government is giving money to the ICRC and<br />
similar organisations because they are uniquely qualified to assist<br />
refugees on both sides of the existing lines of military control.<br />
Clear information about the requirements of the vast numbers<br />
of displaced persons in Cambodia and Vietnam is difficult to obtain<br />
under present circumstances but the immediate cash grant will allow<br />
purchases of food, tents and medical supplies. As the situation<br />
develops, Australia will look sympathetically at the possibility of<br />
giving further aid through the Red Cross and similar organisations.<br />
Mr Whitlam commended the extremely valuable work being carried<br />
out by the Red Cross and by other mult'Cilateral organisations in<br />
the very difficult conditions in Indo-China. Earlier contributions<br />
to the Red Cross for Indo-China relief made by Australia were<br />
$ 277,000 in 1973/ 74 and $ 100,000 in November 1974. Contributions<br />
were also made in November last to the United Nations High Commissioner<br />
for Refugees ($ 500,000) and to UNICEF ($ 400,000).<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the Australian Government was in close<br />
contact with all the international humanitarian organisations caring<br />
for refugees in Vietnam and Cambodia and he anticipated that<br />
substantial further contributions would be made by Australia if the<br />
situation so required.<br />
