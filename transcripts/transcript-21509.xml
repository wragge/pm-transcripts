    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well ladies and gentlemen, good morning, I'd like to welcome you to this news conference. I have a couple of remarks to make and then I'd be happy to answer any questions.  The Parliament will meet on the 16th of November, that is the first available date for a sitting of parliament, after all the formalities concerning the return of the writs and so forth being completed.  There'll probably be a two week sitting, three weeks if necessary.  During that sitting the Government will introduce legislation to give effect to a number of things that were announce either during the campaign or immediately before - including the 100 per cent Medicare... rebate, I'm sorry 100 per cent scheduled fee proposal, or 100 per cent Medicare.  The proposals to enhance the private health insurance rebate for people 65 and over.  And also some other legislation, if it can be prepared in time, to give effect to promises that we made during the election campaign.  It is important that the new Government get down to work immediately and although it's been a very long campaign the business of the nation and our concern to get on with the tasks that we've been given by the Australian people takes priority.  I've spoken to Mr Anderson and it's been agreed that the Coalition between the Liberal Party and the National Party will continue and under the arrangements that obtained and I have spoken to His Excellency, the Governor General, and been able to assure him that we will be able to provide a stable Coalition to form the next government of Australia.</p>
<p>I would expect to announce the new Ministry some time next week.  There are one or two seats which affect people currently in the Ministry which are not yet finally resolved and until that happens it's not possible to form the Ministry. But I can indicate that current ministerial responsibilities will continue until the new ministry is formed and there will at an appropriate time in the next week be a meeting of the new Parliamentary Liberal Party. It's still not possible to know exactly who's in that because there are a number of seats, particularly in South Australia and Western Australia that the results of which are yet to be known. But overall it's clear that the Government will have a bigger majority than it had in the old parliament, just how much bigger that will depend upon the outcome in about eight or nine of the seats where the result is currently in doubt.  But we are very keen for the Parliament to sit as soon as possible and I want to say to the Australian people that we respect the mandate that's been given to us, it's a very strong, a very empathetic mandate, we are very keen to get on with the job of implementing as many as we can of the policies that we took to the public during the election campaign and we want to get that well underway before Parliament adjourns for the Christmas recess.</p>
<p>I will be required to undertake two important overseas trips in November, one of them is to the APEC meeting which will be at the end of the first parliamentary sitting week.  The APEC meeting on this occasion is being held in Santiago in Chile.  It will be an opportunity in bilateral discussions to meet the new Indonesian President, Bambang Yudhoyono, and it's a very important bilateral meeting as well as the evident importance of APEC as a great regional forum. And also very importantly at the end of November the New Zealand Prime Minister and I will be going to the ASEAN meeting in Vientiane in Laos and this is a very important gathering and an important dialogue between ASEAN countries and the Australia and New Zealand Prime Ministers and it's a meeting I discussed on the phone last night with the Prime Minister of Thailand who was good enough to ring him to offer his congratulations on the Government's victory. And I also spoke yesterday to the New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark, and as I've indicated previously both President Bush and the British Prime Minister Tony Blair telephoned me on Saturday night to offer their congratulations and I also received a similar telephone call from my conservative counterpart in the United Kingdom, Michael Howard.</p>
<p>Any questions?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You've had a day and a half now PM. Has it sunk in?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, not entirely, it is certainly a remarkable win and I'm very grateful. I'm humbled as I said on Saturday night and I really mean that.  I did not think the victory would be as great as it turned out to be. I guess I felt on balance that I would win. I thought we might win with the loss of one or two seats, perhaps three or four. I thought the outer-limit of the result was probably hanging on to what we had, although I was quite concerned about one or two seats, one of which turned out not to be a problem at all, another of which has turned out to be quite a problem, that's Adelaide of course. I was somewhat pessimistic about McMillian, but that turned out to be an extremely emphatic result, in fact the result in Victoria was good across the board. It was good across the board everywhere but the indications previously had been that we were a little softer in Victoria than we turned out to be and I'm very grateful that that was not the case.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is there one particular highlight, Greenway, in Tasmania, Tasmania?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well certainly, Greenway is a wonderful further strike deep into the traditional heartland of the Labor Party in Western Sydney.  Western Sydney blazes brightly in the Liberal firmament, if I can put it that way, we're very proud of our members in Western Sydney, Louise Markus is a wonderful candidate, you see her talking to people and the constituents that she's helped, she's already helped about 800 or 1,000 people in different ways since she'd had her office open and she will just continue on with that work and she is a great example of what you would call a community-based politician and she will a very good job and she will be very, very hard to shift.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) Mr Howard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well sensibly.  The likely outcome in the Senate is that we will have 38.  As to whether the remaining seats are filled by possibly an additional person from the Coalition in Queensland, I say only possibly, I think that is a big ask. I don't say it's impossible but it's a very big ask.  Possibly there'll be a Family First person in Victoria, I say only possibly, you could still end up with three Labor people in Victoria because the Christian Democrats and the DLP are preferencing Jacinta Collins in Victoria.  So you can't be certain that Labor won't end up there ahead of Family First.  The Coalition will however have 38, which is half, and that means quite a lot. But we're not going to allow this to go to our head, we're not going to start proposing things that are disruptive, we certainly will press ahead very strongly with things that we've believed in for a long time, particularly in the area of industrial relations, I think we do need more industrial relations reform and if the better outlook in the Senate means that we can have a little more reform in that area, especially the things that we've talked about, then that will be to the good of the country.  As far as issues like Telstra and media ownership laws are concerned, I see they're being reported in the press this morning, well they have been long standing policies of ours and all I can say to all of you is that we will try to implement the programme that we took to the people and it's no more, no less than that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You have a mandate now unlike you've ever had before and can that reasonably be ignored by the non-Government parties in the Senate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it shouldn't be, it shouldn't have been ignored after 2001 in areas like unfair dismissal but it was.  And the difference between what should be and what is, is  often quite marked and that has been the case over the past eight and a half years, I would hope it would be different, I would agree with you that this is a very emphatic mandate and what is emphatic about it is is that the scale of it was largely unexpected, not the ultimate result but the scale of it and it does mean that the Australian people are saying something to all sides of politics and that is that if they vote for a government with a set of policies they believe that that government should have the opportunity of implementing those policies.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would you consider this your greatest political victory?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's a wonderful victory and I certainly feel very grateful and I'm very humble and I'm very relieved and I'm very happy. I'll leave it to other people to mark it on a scale of 10, I think the greatest opportunity anybody can have in public life is to be Prime Minister of Australia and to be re-elected for the third time, and really my fourth election victory as Prime Minister, I'm very grateful.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, in using your improved position in the Senate will you confine yourself to promises made in the election and pre-existing Coalition policies?  Or will you branch out into...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I can't rule out the fact, the possibility of us branching out into new areas. But they would be new areas that are consistent with our philosophy and we're not going to use this somewhat better position in a capricious or disruptive fashion. That's not the style of government that I lead and it won't change in our fourth term.  We're not going to allow this enhanced position to go to our heads, that would be a big mistake and the Australian public would not appreciate it.  But it is a better position but it may be no better than having 38 and being opposed by a group of people who've been largely un-cooperative in the past or totally hostile.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, how would you describe your fourth term agenda beyond Telstra, cross media ownership and industrial relations?  What are the key goals?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well certainly delivering strong economic policies.  First and foremost running the economy well and making sure that we keep interest rates low, making sure that we keep people in work, making sure that when we're faced with important decisions we don't treat blue collar workers with contempt as the Labor Party plainly did in relation to the forestry decision.  We don't believe in riding roughshod over sections of the community to pursue some particular policy goal. But the broad agenda of running a strong economy, of further industrial relations reform, of a great emphasis on national security, of running this trade strategy of taking advantage of opportunities where they exist, of balancing the environment and development.   All of the things that I spoke of during the campaign, particularly in my final address to the National Press Club.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, [inaudible] guarantee the Australian public that each and every one of those [inaudible] will be fulfilled and we won't have some core and non-core promises?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We will fulfill the promises we have made.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the financial markets this morning [inaudible] Telstra shares and other media stocks are up, do you think that financial markets have got a little bit ahead of themselves and can [inaudible] financial markets any kind of best case scenarios to...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't comment on movements in the financial markets.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] Mr Howard and [inaudible] and does Alexander Downer still want to be foreign minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Alexander Downer is an excellent Foreign Minister and he wants to continue and he will.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There will be changes.  You can put whatever description you want on it when it comes out.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] Malcolm Turnbull and Andrew Robb, their resumes are pretty solid, do you see [inaudible] have the qualifications...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, I think they're enormous qualifications but I also think everybody has to get use to the new environment, at least for a little while.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How long will Peter Costello be the Treasurer, Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Peter Costello is a wonderful Treasurer and he ran for Treasurer and he got re-elected and he, of course, as Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party has a right to choose his portfolio.  I imagine that he will choose to be Treasurer again.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, Tony Abbott this morning said that Mark Latham had a 'God complex', do you agree with that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'll leave those descriptions to others.</p>
<p>   JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The newcomers [Inaudible] Ministry just before the election.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The newcomers?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will they, or to the Cabinet [inaudible], will they stay in there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm not going to go beyond what I've said about Mr Downer and Mr Costello as to who does what.  I want to give a lot of thought to the Ministry.  It's important that I allow myself a little time to do that and I'll be doing that over the next few days and there will be changes but I'm not going to go beyond saying what I've said.  People will be judged on merit and I have a responsibility, particularly given the emphatic nature of the win, to choose the best possible people and get a good balance.  I cannot, of course, totally ignore, and I do not intend to, state balances nor indeed balances between the House and the Senate.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, do you think that there is any one overriding reason for the emphatic nature of your victory?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think the overriding reason is that we were seen as competent, as having delivered a strong economy, as having been seen as strong and reliable on national security and defence.  I think the other problem that the Labor Party faced is that they communicated a very mixed message and perhaps the issue they should examine most closely is the reality that their primary vote is virtually unchanged from what it was in 1996.  And that perhaps is the most sobering thing of all for the Labor Party and, indeed, the primary vote of the Coalition on this occasion, although a little below what it was in 1996, is approaching the level it was in 1996 and that the outcome is different only in that the preference flow this time was more heavily against us than what it was in '96.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Some people are saying, Prime Minister, that this was a two election victory.  Do you think that that's the case?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm a more cautious person than that and you're not going to get me on to that sticky paper.  It's one election at a time.  Look, it is a great win and obviously the Labor Party has a lot more ground to make up if it is to win again but circumstances can change and you won't be hearing any of that hubris from me.</p>
<p>   JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Were you [inaudible] Labor's concentration on Costello?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.  I thought the way in which the Labor Party singled out Peter Costello for attack was a huge tactical error because he's seen in the community as a very competent person, as having been a very successful Treasurer and the more they talked about him, the more they elevated economic management to centre stage.  And the public basically like the team.  They like the current arrangement.  They like the fact that Peter and I work together as a team.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Why [inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the election's over now.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can you take us back to when you heard about Latham's forest policy, what were your thoughts when you heard of that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I can only repeat what I've said a moment ago, that it showed a singular disdain for part of the traditional support base of the Labor Party.  I have never taken the view that you can simply tell people that they're going to be retrained or retrenched and expect them to be happy about it.  You've got to take people with you and you've got to persuade them that there's an overwhelming public interest case.  And the problem that Labor had with that policy, and I said it at the time and I repeat it now, that a craving for Green preferences was seen as more important than the job security of blue-collar workers.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] safe Liberal seat [inaudible] I guess we won't know for a  long time...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, nothing is safe in this new era of volatility.  I mean, you can't be certain about anything.  We are living in different times, although, there has been, if I might make this other comment, I think there's been an undue...an overestimation, or an exaggeration rather, of how successful the Greens have been.  They haven't been quite as successful as they have claimed and quite as successful as has been written.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Any [inaudible] you'll be heading to your fourth term as a [inaudible] before you leave politics?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm not thinking about leaving, therefore, I'm not thinking about legacies.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible], conscious of what you could achieve this term if you stay...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look I am... I'm very determined to do good things this term.  I'm very determined to use the enhanced authority and opportunity that an increase in the size of our majority and an improved position in the Senate... it's only an improved position, we don't have control of the Senate.  I think the likelihood of the Coalition controlling the Senate in its own right is fairly slight.  It's possible we could pull off a fourth seat in Queensland, but it's only possible. I think it's, you know, it's certainly a lot less than 50/50. And I obviously want to do very good things. And there's a sense inside the Government that this new mandate has given us the opportunity to do a lot of good things, to implement our programme, to do some new things that are consistent with our philosophy, and therefore broadly consistent with what the Australian public voted for. But it is not a mandate to do reckless, disruptive things and we don't intend to do either.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) talk up or talk down the prospect of lowering the top marginal tax rate.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I wasn't specifically trying to talk it up. I would never talk it down. I was simply saying that in an ideal world or a more... closer to an ideal world, you'd always want to move further on that. I don't regard the task of tax reform in the personal area as ever completed. I really don't.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>PM, (inaudible) and certainly the letters in our newspaper say (inaudible). Do you feel (inaudible)?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, come on. I'm not going to fall for that one either, no.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, no, come on.</p>
<p>   JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, as a man who has lost (inaudible) what sort of elements of character would Mark Latham need to come back?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't want to give that sort of advice. That's a matter for him. No I don't, no I don't. Those sort of comments from somebody in my position can only be seen as self-serving. They can't be seen as anything else. And then when Mr Crean was going through difficulties, I always refrained from making comments, didn't I, because I thought they would be seen as self-serving, and I'm going to refrain on this occasion. The leadership of the Labor Party is a matter for the Labor Party. The Labor Party chose Mr Latham over Mr Beazley by the narrowest of margins, and that was their decision, and I assume that he will be re-endorsed unopposed and then the task will be ahead of him. It is never an easy job being Opposition Leader. I know that from past experience. But I'm not going to give him any advice. It would only be seen as completely self serving.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what would you say (inaudible) the Reserve Bank puts interest rates up?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I will say that that's a matter for the Reserve Bank, but I will also remind you that at no stage in the election campaign when asked an equivalent question, did I say other than that I don't comment on individual movements, but rather that interest rates under a Coalition Government would always be lower than under a Labor Government. That's what I said.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, should we now be calling Howard's Battlers, Howard's Mortgagees?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think you would... you call them what you will. That's... [inaudible].</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, regarding your front bench, do you intend to maintain the same ratio (inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh I'm not going to promise that I will maintain exactly the same ratio, but I certainly must pay regard to state balances and state sensitivities. I'm not going to commit myself to exactly the same number, no, that's silly.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>PM, you (inaudible) Trish Worth. Any comments (inaudible)?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there is still a possibility that Ross Cameron could survive and there is an outside possibility in relation to Trish Worth, but it is much harder. Until we finally know the outcome, I'd rather not talk of it, obviously beyond saying I'd be very sad to lose either of them. Both of them are marginal seats. Adelaide in particular is a very difficult seat for a Liberal to hold for such a long time and she's done remarkably well to have hung on to Adelaide for so long.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I know it's (inaudible) Cameron but he made a big decision (inaudible). Have you got any sort of comment (inaudible)?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I am sorry that he's in difficulty, because he's been a very good Member. And I shared the view expressed by a columnist in The Australian that he hoped he would survive. And I hope he survives as well.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, in your own words you accepted this victory very humbly and you look very happy, but in control. Is there a moment, even for an Australian Prime Minister, where you shut the door and jump up and down and...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't intend to share with anybody what happens when I close the door.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's right. What a relief that must be.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You've even made me blush Prime Minister, but...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You've even made me blush. But...</p>
<p>   PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I didn't... sorry?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What time did you get to bed Sunday morning?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh I got to bed about 10 to 3. After we were at the Wentworth, I went back home just with some of my immediate family and we had a drink and a yarn and a talk, and I went to bed around three o'clock and I woke up at half past five and went for a walk and did other things, went around to the local church and you saw that, and then had some of my staff over for a drink and a nibbly in the afternoon to thank them. They've been through a very long campaign, they've had to put up with a Prime Minister in an election campaign and that is a fate worse than death sometimes. It's very hard.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>PM (inaudible). What do you think you'll be doing in October 2007?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>October...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>2007.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>2007. That's the latest variation, is it? Probably amongst other things, contemplating the upcoming cricket season.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) in the media Prime Minister, there's commentary this morning about (inaudible) from the campaign period as being so very important and that perhaps people had already made up their minds long ago. Do you have any comment on that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think to a large extent that does happen. If there is not a disposition to throw the Government out, and there wasn't, and I've been saying for some time and most particularly to you and Mr Starick in a visit to Bass after a wander through the park in Bass, I said on that occasion that I had not detected generic hostility to the Government the like of which I detected in 1996 and detected in 1983. In those circumstances, a lot of people do make up their minds before the campaign starts and they are largely unmoved by what happens during the campaign unless there is a monumental blunder made which unsettles their previous position not to throw the Government out.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>PM, can you ever reflect or... you've read the papers I'm sure, you always do...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) of your position, rightly or wrongly. Do you ever reflect on those (inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you do, you do. You reflect on the whole lot. Of course you do. But it's not something that... and when you've gone through a long political life as I have, you inevitably have ups and downs. There's not a person who has succeeded in politics and reached the highest office in this country that hasn't gone through some very low times. Menzies went through some incredibly low times. He made that famous remark after he was effectively thrown out by his own troops in 1943, no, earlier that he would just go away and bleed a while, and it was something that I remembered when I read his biography by Alan Murray. So that happens with anybody's career. And my predecessors have gone through difficult periods, not all of them periods experiences inside parliament, but Hawke had a lot of difficulty, if I remember rightly, finding a seat and he must have thought on occasions that he'd never get there. But I don't imagine that his self belief was dented, but I think he went through some difficult times. That happens. Anybody who thinks he can just breeze in to the prime ministership of Australia without any ups and downs doesn't understand the history of this country and doesn't understand the circumstances, the personal circumstances and challenges that are to be endured in order to temper you for the position.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. It's an observation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, why do you think your vote continues to apparently defy electoral gravity in Queensland?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We deliver very strong government for Queenslanders. We see in Queensland the fruits of prosperity for home owners and small business, and there's a natural majority I think for our policies on national security and defence in Queensland. I think they're very strong indeed. I have always felt in the time I have been Prime Minister very strong support in Queensland. Whenever I go there, and I visit Queensland fairly regularly, as I do all parts of Australia, and it was certainly a great result and to be contemplating the possibility of winning yet another seat in Queensland is quite remarkable. My hope was that we could hold what we had in Queensland but the prospect, it's only a prospect at the moment, we're slightly ahead on the two party preferred vote in Bonner, but as a sitting Member, although not in that seat, Sciacca probably would have collected quite a few postal votes, so it will still be a very near run thing. It was a very remarkable result in Queensland, as it was in so many other parts of the country. Quite remarkable.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) McMillan before Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can you explain in hindsight why it went the way it did?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I give full credit to Russell Broadbent. I mean the candidate is always entitled to take most of the credit in my view. He obviously ran a very effective campaign. I imagine that the forestry issue may have worked to our advantage, but also the generic lift in the Liberal vote in Victoria would have advantaged McMillan.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did you follow your broad national campaign from go to whoa?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I hope I did.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did you do what you set out to do?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh by and large Malcolm. Campaigns involve a broad strategy and the... I defined what this election was all about on the very first day, and I stuck to that. I mean at various stages you had to deal with other issues, but I never strayed very far from that and neither I should have because that's what was most important. That is what the election was all about. It wasn't just a tactic or a strategy for the campaign. It was what I genuinely believed the election was all about. It (inaudible)... I don't want to give you the formulation again, I think you know it, but I think it's important that... I emphasise that that is what it's all about.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And Labor you were saying tend to be a bit more scattergun. They had a number of issues running at once. Is that what you were saying earlier in the press conference?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well yes, I thought they were a bit, I felt particularly in the last week.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) immigration and indigenous affairs?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no I haven't. I'm not saying I won't, but I haven't given any thought to it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What will be on the agenda for your talks with the Indonesian President?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the ongoing importance of the bilateral relationship, counter-terrorism, increased cooperation between our police agencies and the Indonesian police agencies. And obviously when I talk to him, I will be putting a view to him on behalf of the relatives of Australians who died in Bali that, fully consistent of course with the Indonesian justice system, Australians would want to see sentences that have been handed down in relation to people responsible for murdering 88 Australians be carried out in full and that there is an expectation in relation to that from the Australian community, and that is certainly an issue that would be raised in my discussions with him.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I realise you have a lot on the agenda, but are you able to give us your top three priorities   for your fourth term?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well maintaining a very strong economy, maintaining the strength of our cooperation with our allies both in the region and around in the world in the fight against terrorism, and implementing the specific programmes that I took to the Australian public during the campaign.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Who was happier to see you get in, Tony Blair or Michael Howard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's the best question of the news conference. Well they were both... Tony Blair was very happy, but then so was Michael Howard. I've known him for a long time. I mean look as I've said before, I am somewhat conflicted when it comes to British politics. My natural affections and allegiances are with the conservative party and I'd like to see a conservative government in Britain again. On the other hand, I greatly admire Tony Blair. I think he was very gutsy over Iraq. He took on his own party. I think he's been very gutsy over a number of other reform measures, and in the time he's been Prime Minister I've formed quite a friendship with him and I like him a lot.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) in the British election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I stay out of that. I leave that to the good judgement of the British people.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, (inaudible) if you were asked by President Bush, would you contemplate at all changing the nature of the... our commitment in Iraq?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I haven't been asked and I don't expect to be asked.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I've said before, and I repeat, we don't have any plans for any significant increase in the deployment that we have in Iraq. I've said before also that we don't rule out some minor adjustment at the edges. I think the deployment we have at the present time is about right, and that's it. Okay?</p>
<p> Thank you.</p>
