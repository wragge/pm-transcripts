HIGH COURT JUDGMENT ON STAMP DUTY<br />
Extract from speech made by the Prime Minister, Mr-'<br />
John Gorton, in the Boothby Electorate, South Australia<br />
27 September 1969<br />
( The Prime Minister handed over a cheque for $ 200, 000 as a Commonwealth<br />
contribution to Adelaide's Festival Hall).<br />
" Of course, this is not going to solve by any means the<br />
problems that your Premier and all the other State Premiers have just<br />
recently run into. You will recall, all of you, that a short time ago there<br />
was a High Court Judgment which cast doubt on the legal validity of the<br />
taxes which the States, all of them, were levying in the way of their own<br />
taxation field of stamp duty. If this legal judgment I'm not quite sure<br />
whether it will but if it does cast doubt and possibly make invalid this kind<br />
of State taxation, then this is something which is going to affect the Budgets<br />
of every State in Australia in greater or lesser degree, certainly the Budgets<br />
of this State, and it is going to have a fundamental effect on the taxation<br />
capacity of the States to raise the residual revenue they want.<br />
I think your Premier and other Premiers would agree with<br />
me that they are now facing, because of this uncertainty, a very grave<br />
problem indeed. I would like to say to your Premier, who is going to meet<br />
all the other Premiers tomorrow in Melbourne to discuss this matter, that<br />
we do not think it just a matter which is a problem for the States. This is<br />
a problem for the Commonwealth just as much as it is a problem for the<br />
States, because it casts the whole relationship into the melting pot.<br />
I don't know what the Conference of Premiers may decide<br />
to do tomorrow. But I do know and I want to make this perfectly clear,<br />
that we, as a Federal Government, realise that it is a problem extending<br />
beyond the States. If possible and if we are asked, we would be prepared<br />
to pass validating legislation to enable the States to continue to do what<br />
they have been doing in the way of taxation, if they wish to do it, though we<br />
do not know whether that validating legislation itself would in fact be<br />
constitutional and would stand up to a challenge. But what we can do in order<br />
to support the States in the problem they are now facing, we as a Commonwealth<br />
Government will do. And if we cannot pass validating legislation because of<br />
the Constitution this is not clear then we will certainly confer with all the<br />
Premiers in order to ensure that their Budgets are not wrecked and that<br />
some other way is found for providing the revenue they may lose as a result<br />
of this Judgment in the High Court. This is of great significance to all of<br />
us and this, I think, should be known and established." </p>
