NEW ZEALAND TOUR 1967<br />
LUNCHEON 3IVEN 3Y MR. HOLYOAKE, PRIIE M! INISTER<br />
OF NEW ZEALAND IN HONOUR OF MR. HOLT, PRIME<br />
MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
" ELLIUITON, N' ZEALAND33RD FLBRUARY, 1967<br />
Text of Speech made by Mr. Hugh '. att ( Deputy Leader of the Opposition)<br />
The Right Hon. the Prime Minister, the Right Hon. M1r. Holt, Your<br />
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
Could I first of all apologise for the absence of the<br />
Leader of the Opposition Mr. Kirk, who I understand could well be<br />
Sir in your country while you are over here. He would have loved<br />
to ave joined y. u oday at this function. But I do want to join<br />
with the Prime Minister in extending a very warm welcome at least<br />
as warm a welcome as it is humanly possible to extend on such a day<br />
as this in : ellington to welcome you to our shores a very important<br />
occasion for us here in Iew Zealand. As the Prime Minister has<br />
stated we are the same people: we have the same principles: we<br />
have the same ideals: we enjoy similar standards of living: and<br />
the more we visit one another's countries the richer we will be.<br />
There was a time when New Zealand depended a great deal on Australia:<br />
in fact there was a time when we were -overned from Australia<br />
at least, from part of Australia: New oouth iales. But we grew<br />
up and we gained our independence, our own ' overnment but we are<br />
not completely independent of one another, neither would we wish<br />
to be. But it is strange how many people in the world still think<br />
that New Zealand is part of Australia. And you know somehow Sir,<br />
that does annoy Kiwis. ' hen you are in New York or London and somebody<br />
says to you "' here are you from": " I'm from New Zealand": " Oh,<br />
that's an island off the coast of Australia, isn't it," And then<br />
of course we have to explain, we have to explain that we are not<br />
any longer roverned by Australia that we are not part of the<br />
Australian Constitution but that we do depend a great deal on<br />
Australia, on our friendship and co-operation one with the other.<br />
It is only natural that we will have a great deal in common.<br />
Incidentally, I was born in Australia, But I have never in my<br />
whole life taken any credit for that.<br />
One of the problems facing both of our nations at<br />
this time is this pro.. lem of trade. Our growth and expansion has<br />
brought immense problems with it and we are ooth concerned with<br />
expanding our trade with the rest of the world. In the past you<br />
have buiTt your industry. Your industrial development has been<br />
nursed and encouraged by your aovernment's protection. It has<br />
made Australia a treat industrial country. We admire your drive<br />
and expansion in the field of trade and the standard of<br />
workmanship is a credit to your technicians. ; Je are pleased to<br />
purchase the products of your industry, but at the same time we<br />
believe you could purchase more from us. The New Zealand-Australia<br />
Free Trahe Agreement signed two years ago was designed to " ive<br />
freer trade between the two countries, but unfortunately there<br />
are some who believe that the reverse is indeed happening. I hope<br />
that the spirit behind the Free Trade Agreement is in fact given<br />
effect to and that the figures that have oeen produced to show<br />
that New 2ealand is indeed in a worse position today than she was<br />
when the igreement was signed are only a temporary indication of<br />
a reverse, and that before long Australia will be purchasing more<br />
of New Zealand's production. iie need to trade with you: we want<br />
to purchase Australian goods: but we have a feeling that Australia<br />
could do more to assist New Zealand by purchasing her production. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I have stated that you concentrated on developig<br />
your industry. We in New Zealand have done likewise. 7e must<br />
continue to do so. We can learn a lesson fr-m what you have<br />
achieved in your country. You gave protection to your<br />
industry. must'continue to protect ours, to maintain our<br />
standard of livi n, and as long as we can both understand the<br />
problems that each country faces well, then, we can really<br />
achieve something. New Zealand has some advantages over<br />
Australia. In this field Australia has many advantages over<br />
New Zealand. One advantage we have that I am sure you would love<br />
to have is some of that cheap electric power that we can produce<br />
from the lakes and the rivers that you will have an opportunity<br />
of seeing. v. e in New Zealand are using that cheap power for the<br />
development of our industry, and we must continue to do so. You<br />
will not have the opportunity on this visit of seeing the<br />
foundation being laid for New Zealand's iron and steel industry<br />
in the North Island. I wish you had. I hope you will return to<br />
see it, and I hope you will realise that when you do, Sir, this<br />
great iron and steel industry will mean that we will be producing<br />
here in New Zealand much of the -oods that we are now importing<br />
from Australia. ' ie have to do it, because we have to be selfsupporting<br />
where we possibly can. I read from your itinerary<br />
that you will be visiting the South Island. You will see there,<br />
especially at this time of the year some of the west wheat<br />
growing country in the world wheat growing country that can<br />
produce over twice as many Dushels per acre as the wheatgrowing<br />
country of Australia. It is not so long ago that Few Zealand<br />
exported wheat to Australia. Last year we imrported 4 1/ 2 million<br />
bushels, but when you pay a visit to the South Island, Sir, you<br />
will see that this year here are 20 000 a-ditional acres of<br />
wheat under production, and so we will only need to buy one<br />
million bushels of wheat from Australia possibly, and I hope we<br />
will see the day . when we will not have to buy ary wheat from<br />
Australia. Now, Sir, that does not mean that we do not want to<br />
trade with Australia, but we are following a pattern that you<br />
have shown us, that we, as you, have to develop our own country.<br />
I do believe that there is a -reat future as the<br />
Prime M inister has said, in the tourist industry, but I do believe,<br />
Sir, that we know you much better than you know us. we know<br />
when obooy Si . pson wins the toss or )' oes out for a duck, or whether<br />
the great Australian Davis Cup is eing played for or whether the<br />
, allabies have won their matc in France or in Scotland. know<br />
everything that you do, but when we go to Sydney or to Melbourne<br />
we can scarcely read a word of what is happening in Eew Zealand.<br />
I think a great deal more can oe done to advertise our country<br />
in your country as you hive done to advertise your country in ours.<br />
And so, Sir, I do say th', t I appreciate the opportunity of oining<br />
with the Prime Minister in this very warm welcome to you today.<br />
May you and Mrs. Holt have a most enjoyable few days in this<br />
country of ours, and may you leave it with an appreciation of t; e<br />
fact that it is worth coming back to and it is worth encouraging<br />
other Australians to do likewise. All the very best to you and a<br />
safe journey home.<br />
Right Hon. Keith Holyoake<br />
Mrs Stevenson and Jentlemen:<br />
I give you the toast to the 3uest of Honour, the Right<br />
Hon. Harold Holy. </p>
