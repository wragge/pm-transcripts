MEDIBANK REVIEW<br />
The Federal Government will conduct an investigation into the<br />
I<br />
! operation of Medibank. The investigation will be undertaken by a<br />
: team to b. e chaired by Mr Austin Holmes the Director of the<br />
Priorities Review Staff of the Department of Prime Minister and<br />
Cabinet. ' Other members of the team will bje Dr Sidney Sax who is<br />
being seconded specifically from his position as Chairman of the<br />
Hospitals and Health Services Commission for this purpose, and<br />
Mr Neil Hyden, ah Assistant Secretary from the Treasury.<br />
4<br />
, It is thd Government's policy to maintain Medibank,-<br />
SThe investigation team, which will be serviced by the<br />
Department of Health, will report in the first instance on<br />
opportunities for improved efficiency in the running of Medibank.<br />
Medibank will involve expenditure approaching $ 1,500 million<br />
this year which would make it one of the largest single cost<br />
items for the Government, approaching closely the nation-' s<br />
defence budget. The Department of Health estimate for 1976-77<br />
is over $ 2,000 million.<br />
It is a new and expensive program and it is appropriate that<br />
its operation should be reviewed at this stage so the taxpayers<br />
can be assured they are getting good value for money from it.<br />
The Government is becoming increasingly concerned, as are<br />
members of the public and the medical and allied professions,<br />
at repeated reports of abuse of Medibank. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
It is important that these reports be examined as soon as<br />
possible. The Government is not alone in suggesting the importance of<br />
an investigationof Medibank-<br />
The Health Insurance Commission, which closely monitors the<br />
scheme, is concerned about certain aspects of its operation.<br />
The investigation of Medibank will be in addition to the<br />
review of Government expenditure being undertaken by the Administrative<br />
Review Committee, under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry Bland, which the<br />
Prime Minister announced on December 21. That Committee's area<br />
of enquiry did not extend to Medibank.<br />
There will be a close involvement of the States in the investigation<br />
since they ave a primary responsibility in the provision of<br />
health services. S I<br />
