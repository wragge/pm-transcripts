31 October 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
TELEVISION INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYNEHAM<br />
NIGHTLINE, CHANNEL NINE<br />
E O E<br />
LYNEHAM: Prime Minister welcome again to the program.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Pleasure. LYNEHAM: I assume you have joined us tonight to announce the details of your Government's new<br />
attack on the drug problem?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I will be doing that on Sunday but I can say it will be very comprehensive, it will cover<br />
health aspects, education aspects and law enforcement aspects. And one of the things<br />
that it will be designed to do is to encourage school children that drug taking is<br />
diabolically harmful to them and to remove any semblance of fashionability or coolness<br />
or acceptability in relation to drug taking. I think there is a lot more that can be done<br />
in that area.<br />
LYNERAM: Some would say the best way to change the drug culture among teenagers would be to<br />
give them real jobs, a sense of hope and belonging? </p>

PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That will obviously help, yes. And unemployment is a cause of drug dependency but it<br />
is overwhelmingly not the only cause. Anybody who says that misunderstands the<br />
nature of it.<br />
LYNEHAM:<br />
But do you think you can change the culture -with an advertising campaign or leaflets in<br />
schools?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no you can't. But you can make an impact over a period of years through a<br />
combination of programs. Look at the change in social attitudes towards smoking.<br />
LYNEHAM: You mentioned law enforcement too. The Premiers and Chief Ministers today have<br />
called on you to restore the cuts to fiinding to customis and to Federal Police. You<br />
won't look fair-dinkum if those cuts stay will you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
None of the cuts we made had any significant impact on the law enforcement<br />
operations of the customs people or the Federal Police.<br />
LYNEHAM: The Federal Police Association says it has had a major impact on it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That is not correct. But in any event have a look at the announcement that is made at<br />
the weekend and I think you will see that right across the board there is a very<br />
comprehensive program and I think a very effective one.<br />
LYNEHAM: And there will be bucks backing it up, real bucks?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh there will be real bucks, real bucks, big bucks. </p>

LYNEHAM; Because the bottom line in the end, isn't it, is stopping the damn stuff getting into the<br />
country?<br />
PREME MINISTER.<br />
It is that, but it is also encouraging people to believe that it is harmful~ to them to take<br />
it. And it is also helping people who have become addicted to recover.<br />
LYNEHAM: Now they have been talking about cuts to customs and the Federal Police and there has<br />
been a lot of controversy over nursing homes, which has cost your Government fairly<br />
dearly among the grey power constituency, and yet in the midst of all this we can try<br />
and save a billion dollars to loan to Indonesia. Many people don't understand that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Let me say that it is a loan repayable with interest. It is in Australia's national interest<br />
to ensure that the Indonesian economy doesn't fall over. We have a $ 1.4 billion dollar<br />
trade surplus with Indonesia. That's Australian jobs at risk if the Indonesian economy<br />
is affected. Now we sell 60 per cent of our goods and services to Asia now. Thle idea<br />
that jobs wouldn't be lost if the Asian economies fell over Is quite fancifull.<br />
LYNEHLAM:<br />
But is it a safe one? The talk of economies failing over makes you wonder if it is a<br />
good bet.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It will be a very good bet and we'll be working and acting in consort, with the IMF.<br />
There will be very stringent conditions imposed on Indonesia.<br />
LYNEHAM. But what about when people say, now why doesn't President Soeharto and his family<br />
and all their rich cronies just ring up their Swiss Bankers., they've got millions, it is<br />
their country?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
This action of Australia's is designed to help the Indonesian people it is not designed<br />
to help President Soeharto. </p>

LYNEHAM: It won't hurt him though will it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, none of it will go to him.<br />
LYNEHAM: Ten days ago, your home in Sydney was the target of Greenpeace activists. They got<br />
up on the roof with their banners and some solar panels. How did you feel about that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I was concerned about my children.<br />
LYNEHAM: Two of them were there at the time,<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
They were, yes.<br />
LYNEBAM:<br />
Were they upset? Were they frightened?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No they handled the thing with very great maturity and I was very proud of that fact<br />
but I don't want to..<br />
LYNEHAM: Some of the reports said that you were very very angry?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well Paul, I had a little dilemma on something like this. I'd basically rather have no<br />
security at all. I'd far rather wander the streets of Sydney without any police, without<br />
any kind of security and so would my children. You are caught in a real dilemma if<br />
you try and live a fairly normal existence as Prime Minister, with your family, you do<br />
expose yourself to that sort of thing. The Greenpeace people were harmless but others<br />
may not be. </p>

P. 11<br />
On the other hand, if you were to stop it entirely you would have to turn the place into<br />
an armed camnp and I will never do that.<br />
LYNEHLAM: Were you surprised by Labor's surge in the polls and for Cheryl Kernot to join them?<br />
PRIME MINISTERNo.<br />
LYNERAM: Its held up pretty well though. They have still got 6 points ahead in news poll on<br />
Tuesday and your personal rating at an all time low. Is this just mid-term blues?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well Paul, no politician likes the polls to go the other way but the best antidote to any<br />
poll is to just do the job, get on with the process of decision making and providing<br />
good Government and I have always accepted that Governments will, in these more<br />
volatile, detribalised political times, Governments will always go through peaks and<br />
troughs more so than in earlier years.<br />
LYNEHAM: But a couple of months ago, Labor people were saying, oA look Howard is almost<br />
guaranteed a second term. Its a 3 term Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I've never held the views in politics.<br />
LYNEHAM: Well they don't hold that now.<br />
PRIME MINISTERGood<br />
luck to them if that's their view. Politics is a very competitive game.<br />
LYNEHAM: You do accept now that you do have a fight on your hands at the next election? </p>
<p>Fax from 3 5 31/ 10/ 97 21: 86<br />
OCT 31 ' 97 19: 55 P<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I have always thought I'd have a fight on my hands. I have never had any different<br />
view.<br />
LYNEHAM: You never thought privately well there is two terms in this. You have got such a big<br />
majority? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I have always taken the view that politics is very volatile. I believe that we will get reelected.<br />
I really do. But I don't take the Australian people for granted.<br />
