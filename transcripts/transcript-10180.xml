28 November 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
DOORSTOP THE RESIDENCE OF<br />
THE BRITISH HIGH COMMISSIONER<br />
DEAKIN, CANBERRA<br />
E&amp; EO<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Mr Howard how likely is it that we could end up going to an early election over<br />
budget bills<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The only thing at issue now is whether the Senate will pass something that the<br />
Australian public think is fair and that is a measure which restricts the immediate<br />
availability of certain welfare benefits to migrants once they arrive in this country. We<br />
disclosed this before the election, the people voted for it, and all we're doing is putting<br />
it back and asking the Senate t) reconsider.<br />
JOURNALIST: And if the Senate rejects it agaln?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, we want the measure, this is not an exercise in anything else. I've said all along<br />
that I want the Parliamnent to run its full course. I also want the Senate to pass<br />
measures that the public wants. I mean, the Senate should pass this because the public<br />
voted for it and we're going t8 put it back and ask the Senate to pass it again.<br />
JOURNALISTAnd if the Senate doesn't paiit again? V </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh look, you come and talk to me then. But, you know, I wouldn't sort of get too<br />
excited. JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, you're talking about going full term and Mr Costello was hinting...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't.. . I know exactly what he said and I've talked to him we talk very regularly<br />
and I just ask you all not to get excited.<br />
JOURNALIST: Wasn't he hinting at tax rises yesterday as well?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we have no intention of lifting tax. What we do point out to the Australian<br />
public is that if expenditure savings are knocked off then Australians lose the<br />
opportunity of even lower taxes. It's a big difference between increasing tax and<br />
pointing that out.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you be happy to go to a campaign with that as a primary issue?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh look, I've only just been elected and I'm liking it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard were you aware that Mr Costello was going to make these remarks about<br />
the double dissolution today?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
He didn't talk about a double dissolution,<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, about it going to an election? 2<br />

<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well took, Peter Costello and I have had a number of lengthy conversations, we talk to<br />
each other very regularly. I don't think he said anything about a double dissolution. I<br />
haven't heard the full transcript but I have spoken to him several times today and he<br />
didn't make any reference to that.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible)<br />
PRIME MiNISTER:<br />
Well I didn't see it that way.<br />
JOURNALIST: If the Senate rejects the bill twice after three months...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, you know I never answer hypothetical questions but could I just again, I have<br />
expressed and he has expressed on a number of occasions a desire for the Parliament to<br />
run its full course.<br />
JOURNALIST: If Australians have to forsake tax cuts does that mean you're going to stick rigidly to<br />
the deficit reduction programme?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Gee, let me think about that. What do you mean? I don't quite follow that.<br />
JOURNALIST: If the budget deficit strategy is blown out by the Senate...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't know whether it will, I mean, we've still got a few bills to be voted on in the<br />
Senate. I think with the bills in the Senate you've got to look at each of them in<br />
isolation. We've got the industrial relations bill through, we've got a large number of<br />
budget bills through. I hope the Senate will pass the HECs legislation. I hope the<br />
Senate will pass the Hligher Education legislation. I hope in particular they Will<br />
support that measure because it gives to parents greater choice. I would find it very<br />
strange if the Senate were to reject a measure that would allow the emergence of low<br />
fee paying independent schools. It would seem to me to be promoting elitism to vote<br />
against that measure. And so I certainly hope the Senate will pass that measure 3<br />

<p>because I think it's an important element in providing choice to Australian parents and<br />
to Australian families and that's something to which the Government is very strongly<br />
committed. Once again, that's a measure that we put to the Australian public at the<br />
election. We were open about that and for some reason the Labor Party and the<br />
Democrats are opposed to it. My view about Senate measures is that you look at each<br />
on its own. And we're very pleased that the cooperation we received from the<br />
Australian Democrats in relation to the passage of the industrial relations legislation. I<br />
hope we can get the support of some of the Independents in relation to other measures.<br />
In respect of the migrant waiting period bill, we're disappointed in the extreme because<br />
we think the Australian public wants this bill it's a fair bill, it takes a load off the backs<br />
of Australian taxpayers against battling taxpayers and we think it ought to be passed.<br />
JOURNALIST: What do you think of the chances of it being passed when it's reintroduced?<br />
PRIME NMSTER:<br />
Well next week, I mean, what happens is that when a measure is unacceptably<br />
amended by the Senate the House of Representatives has to send a message back to<br />
the Senate saying that it doesn't accept the amendments. I just hope next week the<br />
Senate will reconsider its position.<br />
ends.<br />
