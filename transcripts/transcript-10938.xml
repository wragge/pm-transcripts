<p>Thank you very much Mr Skurnik, to the Ambassador, Consul-General,</p>
<p> Mr Oystragh, Dr Goldman, to Mr Aqualina representing the NSW Government,</p>
<p> to my predecessor, Bob Hawke, to the former Premier of NSW, Neville</p>
<p> Wran and to other distinguished guests including my colleague, Mr</p>
<p> Andrew Thomson, the Federal Member for Wentworth, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>It is a particular honour for me to be here today to do a number of</p>
<p> things on behalf of the Government and the people of Australia to</p>
<p> congratulate the congregation and particularly the Jewish community</p>
<p> of Sydney on this wonderful event. It's made special for me by</p>
<p> the fact that the original building destroyed so tragically in 1994</p>
<p> was opened in February of 1960 by the former Prime Minister of Australia,</p>
<p> Sir Robert Menzies.</p>
<p>This is a wonderful occasion for your community and it is an opportunity</p>
<p> for me on behalf of your fellow Australians to express my and their</p>
<p> admiration for the contribution of your community to the life of our</p>
<p> country over such a long period of time. It is important on occasions</p>
<p> such as this to pause for a moment and to honour the contribution</p>
<p> of a community and to recognise the integral role that the Jews of</p>
<p> Australia have played in the life of our nation over such a long period</p>
<p> of time. Their contribution, your contribution, has been in every</p>
<p> field of endeavour. It has been in the professions, in law, in medicine,</p>
<p> in engineering, in architecture. It has been in politics, it has been</p>
<p> in sport. It has produced probably the greatest military leader that</p>
<p> Australia has seen. Two Governors-General of Australia have been of</p>
<p> the Jewish faith and wherever people look through the history of our</p>
<p> country, we can find an honourable contribution by the Jewish community</p>
<p> of our nation. And what you have done in rebuilding this synagogue</p>
<p> in such a short period of time is a tribute to your commitments and</p>
<p> to the loyalty of those things that you hold dear. And it is an opportunity</p>
<p> for me on behalf of the rest of the Australian community to salute</p>
<p> that contribution and to thank you for what you have collectively</p>
<p> done to make our nation a better place in which to live.</p>
<p>It is also appropriate that this new synagogue is open in the 50th</p>
<p> year of the foundation of the state of Israel in 1948. No country</p>
<p> could have had its birth in more difficult, hostile, unwelcoming circumstances.</p>
<p> Yet against enormous odds over that 50 year period, the state of Israel</p>
<p> has not only survived but it's prospered and it has been a beacon</p>
<p> of freedom in the Middle East. Successive Australian governments have</p>
<p> defended the territorial integrity and have supported the right of</p>
<p> Israel to peacefully exist within secure boundaries. And I take this</p>
<p> opportunity, on behalf of my Government, of reaffirming the continuity</p>
<p> of that support and our determination consists of that support to</p>
<p> see a lasting peace achieved in the Middle East.</p>
<p>This is also an occasion, of course, to celebrate the spiritual life</p>
<p> of our nation. To honour and respect the role of spiritual values</p>
<p> whatever form they may take within our community. And when we think</p>
<p> of those values, we think of the future and we think of hope and even</p>
<p> in the most difficult circumstances we can find hope. Particularly</p>
<p> today I believe many people around the world will find hope that after</p>
<p> long decades of hatred and destruction, the people of the Irish Republic</p>
<p> and of Northern Ireland have apparently taken a path towards peace.</p>
<p> And that is the source of hope that even in the most difficult circumstances</p>
<p> the difficulties and hatreds of the past can be overcome.</p>
<p>It is also, of course, very understandably a moment for the Jewish</p>
<p> community here today and around Australia to reflect upon the tragedies</p>
<p> that have befallen your community in other parts of the world. And</p>
<p> of course to remember those who've suffered in such awful circumstances.</p>
<p> And for all of us to resolve that such events can never again let</p>
<p> overtake any part of humanity or any part of the world.</p>
<p>And finally, ladies and gentlemen, it is for me a very distinct, personal</p>
<p> pleasure to be here today. My association with the Jewish community,</p>
<p> particularly of Sydney, long predates my entry into public life. And</p>
<p> very early in my life I enjoyed the warm embrace and the welcome and</p>
<p> the sense of community, the sense of family, the sense of commitment</p>
<p> to make which has been a hallmark of the Jewish community in Australia.</p>
<p>And I want to take this very public opportunity of thanking that community</p>
<p> for the friendship that it has extended to me both inside and outside</p>
<p> public life. This is a great community occasion. It's an opportunity</p>
<p> to thank those who have dedicated themselves to rebuilding the synagogue.</p>
<p> It is an opportunity to salute the expansion and the diversification</p>
<p> of the cultural life of the Jewish community here in Sydney. A great</p>
<p> investment in your schools and other community activities. And to</p>
<p> recognise the fact that this building and all the surrounds to it</p>
<p> will become a very important part in the life of your community. It's</p>
<p> an occasion for celebration. It's an occasion for thanksgiving.</p>
<p> It's an occasion for reflecting on all of those great things</p>
<p> that we have in common as Australians.</p>
<p>And ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for honouring me and</p>
<p> on behalf of your fellow Australians, on behalf of the Government</p>
<p> I send you my warmest good wishes. I thank you for the contribution</p>
<p> you make to the life and soul of Sydney and to the Australian nation</p>
<p> and I have enormous pleasure in officially declaring this new Central</p>
<p> Synagogue, I understand the largest in the southern hemisphere, I</p>
<p> have great pleasure in declaring it, in a secular sense, well and</p>
<p> truly open.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
