PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
OPENING OF THE THIRD RUNWAY AT SYDNEY AIRPORT<br />
4 NOVEMBER 1994 * CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY*<br />
Well. today's a great day.<br />
It's a great day for Sydney but it's also a great day for Australia.<br />
The opening of this third runway means that we now have the sort of airport<br />
you'd expect in one of the great cities of the world.<br />
It's the! sort of airport worthy of a city, and a country, hosting the 2000<br />
Olympics. But perhaps more important, this third runway will create a huge number of jobs<br />
and deliver enormous benefits to the Australian community.<br />
According to the Federal Airports Corporation, this runway will generate an<br />
additional 26,000 airport-related jobs in the next five years, and an additional<br />
one million jobs in the tourism industry over the next ten years.<br />
I mean it's difficult to think of many projects that are going to generate these<br />
levels of employment.<br />
On top of the jobs, there will also be majqor benefits to consumers be they<br />
business people or people on holidays.<br />
And It won't be too long before they no longer have to factor in inordinate<br />
delays -to their travel into and out of Sydney. </p>
<p>2<br />
Of course, making this a world quality airport that will generate enormous<br />
benefits, not just for Sydney but for the wider Australian community is<br />
something that's not without it's cost.<br />
And, unfortunately, it's a cost that doesn't fall equally.<br />
As we all know, there are a good number of people who live in the surrounding<br />
areas, who will be adversely affected by noise.<br />
For thiose people, we have put in place a $ 183 million package of measures to<br />
reduce the Impact of aIrcraft noise on the local community.<br />
I might add that these measures aren't cosmetic they go further than many<br />
similar programs at airports right around the world.<br />
They acknowledge that the burden doesn't fall equally.<br />
The noise control measures include<br />
* the voluntary acquisition of 112 properties in the area of highest noise<br />
exposure the 40 Australian Noise Exposure ( AN EF) contour<br />
the Insulation of schools, colleges, hospitals, churches, and child and health<br />
care facilities the 25 to 40 ANEF contour based on the ultimate capacity<br />
of the airport<br />
and the Insulation of 3,500 residences exposed to projected noise levels<br />
above 30 ANEF.<br />
Further, there will also be a study to assess whether insulation should be put in<br />
residences exposed to lower levels of noise ( below the 30 ANEF contour) arnd a<br />
pilot insulation scheme will be undertaken as a matter of priority.<br />
This third runway is also a major accomplishment in construction and industrial<br />
relations. Not only has the project involved the dredgi ng of 14 million cubic metres; of<br />
sand from Botany Bay, the reclamation of 170 hectares and the construction of<br />
kilometres of taxiways, but it has all been achieved six months ahead of<br />
schedule and $ 32 million under budget.<br />
Further, because of a ' co-operative contracting approach' between the runway<br />
consortium and the Federal Airports Corporation, not one day has been lost to<br />
industrial action during the entire life of the project. </p>
<p>That's a great achievement and a tribute to both the workers and the<br />
management. In constructing the runway, we haven't lost sight of environmental<br />
considerations. To prevent silt fouling Botany Bay, a specially fabricated seven kilometre long<br />
' turbidity barrier' has been built.<br />
And Kl's the first time this technology has been used on a major project like this<br />
one. In addition, 30 hectares of seagrass have been created in the embayment<br />
between the runways.<br />
Of course, it's also important to see this third runway in the wider context of the<br />
Government's aviation policies to deliver a quality service to Australian<br />
consumers. With this runway up and running, we can now rightly lay claim to having a<br />
robust, integrated and Internationally competitive aviation industry one that<br />
has decreased average air fares by 22 per cent since 1990 and has increased<br />
passenger numbers by 58 per cent on our most Important routes.<br />
But the reform needs to continue and that's why the Government has moved to<br />
lease all FAC Airports and Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek.<br />
At its heart, this decision reflects the need to improve the efficiency of airport<br />
investments and operations.<br />
It should lead to Australia having one of the most innovative private airport<br />
industries in the world.<br />
All up these reforms, coupled with the construction of this third runway will<br />
deliver enormous benefits to tens of thousands of Australians both in terms of<br />
jobs arid additional business.<br />
Today is a major step forward for the Australian aviation Industry.<br />
And it's the sort of step we have to take if we are to ensure that 21st Century<br />
Australia is the best place in the world to live and do business.<br />
Congratulations to all involved in the completion of this critical piece of national<br />
infrastnicture. Thank you. </p>
