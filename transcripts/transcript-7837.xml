STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARLIAMENTARY RESOLUTION ON RAOUL WALLENBERG<br />
NOVEMBER 1989<br />
I move:<br />
That, noting the continued international concern about<br />
the fate of Swedish diplomat, Raoul Wallenberg, who<br />
disappeared into Soviet hands in January 1945 following the<br />
defeat of Nazi forces in Budapest, and recent<br />
discussions between Soviet authorities and<br />
Raoul Wallenberg's family about his fate, this House:<br />
affirms its admiration for the selfless and heroic work<br />
of Raoul Wallenberg in saving the lives of tens of<br />
thousands of potential victims, both Jewish and<br />
non-Jewish, of Nazi terror during the Second World War;<br />
urges all interested parties to continue to co-operate<br />
in a comprehensive and conclusive examination of the<br />
circumstances relating to the detention of<br />
Raoul Wallenberg by Soviet authorities from 1945<br />
onwards; and<br />
resolves through its own work on human rights issues,<br />
to continue to apply the universal principles of<br />
freedom, justice and humanity that so vividly manifest<br />
themselves in Raoul Wallenberg's work.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
Next January will mark the forty fifth anniversary of the<br />
date of Raoul Wallenberg's disappearance.<br />
He was by all accounts a truly remarkable man.<br />
His actions during the Second World War against appalling<br />
odds and possibly at the cost of his own life were simply<br />
heroic. Raoul Wallenberg's example shows the power that lies within<br />
us all to rally in defiance and eventually to triumph over<br />
depravity and intolerance.<br />
He personally saved the lives of tens of thousands of people<br />
who would otherwise have fallen victims to Nazi butchery:<br />
ordinary people workers, mothers and grandmothers, school<br />
children all marked for execution through the frightening<br />
and perverse twist of Hitler's call for a Final Solution. </p>
<p>But tragically, having survived and helped so many others to<br />
survive the Nazi occupation of Budapest, Raoul Wallenberg<br />
was himself swallowed up by the bloody creation of another<br />
dictator: lost into the clutches of Stalin's NKVD whence he<br />
was never to emerge.<br />
Raoul Gustav Wallenberg was born on 4 August 1912 into a<br />
distinguished Swedish family.<br />
After studying architecture in the United States he embarked<br />
on various commercial ventures, and through his business<br />
activities came to learn of developments in Nazi-occupied<br />
Europe. By 1944, Allied leaders could no longer ignore the horrible<br />
fact of Hitler's Final Solution and tentative international<br />
moves were started to save Jews and other potential victims<br />
in Nazi-occupied territories from death camps.<br />
President Roosevelt set up a War Refugee Board for precisely<br />
this purpose.<br />
Attention focused on Hungary, which had at the start of the<br />
Second World War a Jewish population of 750,000.<br />
Discussions took place between the War Refugee Board and the<br />
Swedish government to expand Swedish diplomatic and consular<br />
representation in Hungary to work to save human lives.<br />
It was in these circumstances that Raoul Wallenberg was<br />
appointed to the Swedish Legation in Budapest.<br />
In the period from his arrival in Budapest on 9 July 1944 to<br />
his disappearance at the hands of the Red Army on,<br />
17 January 1945, Raoul Wallenberg and his colleagues in the<br />
Swedish legation saved perhaps one hundred thousand people<br />
from certain death.<br />
They did so through mustering every resource they had at<br />
their disposal; sheer energy, tact, determination, forgery,<br />
bluff, and bribery. Ever vigilant, ever present, they were<br />
ready to issue Swedish identity papers and passports to<br />
anyone under threat.<br />
Joni Moser, who worked in running errands for Wallenberg,<br />
describes one incident when Wallenberg learned that eight<br />
hundred Jewish labour service men were being marched to the<br />
Gestapo concentration camp at Mauthausen.<br />
Moser and Wallenberg drove to the Hungarian frontier and<br />
caught up with the column.<br />
Wallenberg asked that those with Swedish protective<br />
passports should raise their hand.<br />
On Wallenberg's order, Moser ran between the ranks, telling<br />
everyone to do so, whether they had a passport or not. </p>
<p>Moser explains:<br />
"[ Wallenberg] then claimed custody of all who raised<br />
their hands and such was his bearing that none of the<br />
Hungarian guards opposed him. The extraordinary thing<br />
was the absolutely convincing power of his behaviour"<br />
In his work, Wallenberg was pitted against the ruthless<br />
killing machines of the Gestapo and the dreaded SS.<br />
His antagonists included the infamous war criminal<br />
Adolf Eichmann.<br />
At the very end of the Nazi occupation of Budapest, when he<br />
learned of Eichmann's plan for a total massacre of the<br />
69,000 or so Jews who were still alive in the so-called<br />
General Ghetto, Wallenberg intervened in a final flourish of<br />
threats and brinkmanship to prevent the order being carried<br />
out. When Soviet forces took control of Budapest some few days<br />
later, they found some 120,000 Jews who had survived the<br />
Final Solution the only substantial Jewish community left<br />
in Europe.<br />
Tragically, within a week, Wallenberg himself had<br />
disappeared. He had devised a relief plan for the Hungarian Jewish<br />
community, and was on his way to present his ideas to<br />
Marshal Malinovsky, the Soviet commander, and the<br />
provisional Government.<br />
His colleagues last saw him in.-the side-car of a Red Army<br />
motorcycle, on his way to discharge this mission.<br />
What happened to Wallenberg after this still lacks<br />
satisfactory explanation.<br />
There has been much speculation about Raoul Wallenberg's<br />
fate, with some including, importantly, his family and his<br />
close colleague from Budapest days, Per Anger believing<br />
that he may still be alive.<br />
Soviet authorities, however, have maintained that Wallenberg<br />
died of a heart attack in 1947 at the NKVD's Lubyanka prison<br />
in Moscow.<br />
Only last month, Raoul Wallenberg's family went to Moscow to<br />
get to the bottom of his disappearance.<br />
They were given a small box containing his belongings a<br />
blue passport embossed with the Swedish crown, some old<br />
currency notes and yellowed note pads together with a<br />
reiteration of previous claims about his fate. </p>
<p>Sadly, despite the new openness and willingness on the part<br />
of the Soviet authorities to discuss the case, the<br />
examination of the circumstances relating to<br />
Raoul Wallenberg's disappearance is still not conclusive.<br />
I for one believe that forty-five years after the<br />
disappearance of this remarkable man, efforts should<br />
continue to be made to clear up this matter once and for<br />
all. But what then does Raoul Wallenberg's story mean for<br />
contemporary Australia, so far removed in time and distance?<br />
In the first place, he and his colleagues from the Swedish<br />
Legation in Budapest saved the lives of many people who<br />
subsequently made their homes amongst us.<br />
One such person was a 19-year old woman, Anna Boskovitz, who<br />
had recently married.<br />
After being arrested in the middle of the day on the streets<br />
of Budapest for " looking Jewish", she found herself released<br />
from detention by the Hungarian fascists into the hands of a<br />
stranger from the Swedish legation.<br />
That stranger extended her the protection of his Government,<br />
personified by this very passport I hold here today<br />
protection that literally saved her life and allowed her<br />
subsequently to establish a new life in Australia.<br />
Anna Boskovitz, who built a professional career in Sydney<br />
and who is now also a mother and grandmother, is with us<br />
here today, watching this debate from the Speaker's Gallery.<br />
Not only does Anna Boskovitz owe her life to<br />
Raoul Wallenberg, Australia is a better place for having her<br />
and many like her among us.<br />
Mr Speaker, the story of Raoul Wallenberg also serves to<br />
remind us of humanity's capacity for cruelty on the one hand<br />
and its resources for compassion on the other.<br />
In the words of one person who was saved by him,<br />
" Raoul Wallenberg symbolises the ideal that one person can<br />
make a difference"<br />
At a time in human history when there is so much cause for<br />
optimism, so much evidence of change, Raoul Wallenberg's<br />
legacy demands that we not be complacent.<br />
The violation of human rights internationally is still,<br />
sadly, a daily occurrence.<br />
In too many countries we see daily evidence of suffering and<br />
oppression. In many parts of the world we continue to witness unlawful<br />
detention, torture, starvation and poverty, the displacement<br />
of large groups of people and refugees. </p>
<p>4 It would be easy to turn our backs on these problems.<br />
It could be as easy as flicking a television switch.<br />
But to do so in the face of Raoul Wallenberg's example would<br />
be to betray the legacy he left us.<br />
In the same Budapest that formed the backdrop for<br />
Raoul Wallenberg's heroism, we have this very year seen the<br />
determination of ordinary people to turn back the tide of<br />
totalitarianism. And as in Budapest, so too in Warsaw and Berlin and Prague.<br />
The universal principles of freedom, justice and humanity<br />
that so vividly manifest themselves in Raoul Wallenberg's<br />
work still fire the spirit of humanity today, just as the<br />
dark forces he worked to counter still have still to be<br />
eliminated. Earlier this year, I was honoured to preside over a tree<br />
naming ceremony here in Parliament House in<br />
Raoul Wallenberg's honour.<br />
I also paid homage to this remarkable man in July this year<br />
in Budapest, when I laid a wreath at a memorial erected to<br />
his memory by the people of Hungary.<br />
Today, I am pleased to commend this motion to the House. </p>
