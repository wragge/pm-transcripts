. AJAUSTRALIA PRESS RELEASE NO. 228<br />
APRIL 1974<br />
The Leader of the Opposition's confused and<br />
confusing grab-bag of economic policies is a model of<br />
irresponsibility and a receipe for inflation. It would<br />
seem that the Opposition believes the economy is slack<br />
rather than fully extended. If so, Opposition spokesmen<br />
are the only individuals to make this claim for many months.<br />
When the Labor Party was elected by the people<br />
in December 1972, there was unemployment and there was a need<br />
for stimulatory Government action. In the year 1972, the<br />
growth rate of gross non-farm products was only 3 per cent.<br />
Action by the Australian Labor Government increased the<br />
growth rate in 1973 to 7 per cent and eliminated unemployment.<br />
During the year 1973, male employment rose by 2.9 per cent and<br />
female employment by 8.2 per cent more than double the rate<br />
of growth in the previous twelve months. The Australian Labor<br />
Government is not willing to fight inflation by deliberately<br />
creating unemployment. In my Policy Speech of November 1972<br />
I undertook that the restoration of genuine full employment<br />
would be our first priority. We achieved this objective and<br />
we do not regret it.<br />
During the year, as inflationary forces gathered<br />
momentum throughout the world, the Government took a series of<br />
measures to restrain the forces of inflation. International<br />
events ensured that inflation during the last year would be<br />
greater than in the previous year. Nevertheless, they would<br />
have been greater still if the Government had not taken these<br />
measures each of which was caused by the Opposition at the<br />
time. The best economic advice available to any Australian<br />
government led to revaluations of the Australian dollar, the<br />
per cent across-the-board tariff cut, the gradual tightening<br />
of monetary policy and the significant cuts in public expenditure<br />
from the recommendations of the Coombs' Task Force. This advice<br />
had, in many cases, been tendered to the previous Liberal/ Country<br />
Party Government but they did not have the political courage to<br />
accept it. 2/ </p>
<p>-2-<br />
It is perhaps understandable why the Opposition<br />
should, for short-term political reasons, have criticised each<br />
and every one of these actions as they were made. However, it<br />
is totally irresponsible for the Opposition to undertake to<br />
reverse virtually all of these decisions at a time when they<br />
seek to present themselves to the Australian people as a<br />
credible, alternative government. The Opposition's policy<br />
would constitute an act of vandalism against the economy from<br />
which it would take many years to recover.<br />
I completely reject the impression the Opposition<br />
seems to convey that the growth of the Public Service has been<br />
abnormally high. The rate of growth has in fact been lower than<br />
in three of the last few years of Liberal/ Country Party government.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition is simply misleading the Australian<br />
people when he implies that there is significant scope for<br />
economies in this area. If we set aside the people employed in<br />
Defence and in the non budgetary expenditure of the Post Office,<br />
the total amount to be spent in 1973/ 74 on salaries by the<br />
Australian Government is only $ 782 million, and all other<br />
administrative expenses only $ 358 million. If they slash the<br />
Public Service by 25 per cent, they would still not be close<br />
to their figure of $ 600 million, which has been plucked out of<br />
the air as an electoral tax bribe.<br />
I also reject Mr. Snedden's assertion that only the<br />
private sector is ' productive". Public investment in roads,<br />
schools and public transport is essential for the health of our<br />
economy. Mr. Snedden' s unspecified cuts on " capital works" will<br />
seriously inhibit economic development as well as social welfare.<br />
The increase in interest rates was an effect of the<br />
Government's decision to reduce excessive liquidity in the<br />
economy one that will be reversed as soon as the threat of<br />
excessive liquidity has disappeared. The Opposition's undertakings<br />
to remove the variable deposit requirements will release<br />
a flood of foreign money into this country which can only increase<br />
inflation. To undertake to remove domestic monetary restrictions<br />
at the same time can only be described as irresponsible. The<br />
seeds of our present inflation were sown when the Liberals allowed<br />
unprecedented growth in money at an annual rate of 34 per cent<br />
in th1e last six months of 1972. We are only now beginning to<br />
recover from their neglect.<br />
At a time of inflation, a Government must take some<br />
tough decisions. I believe our Government in its tariff cuts,<br />
revaluations, interest rates and implementation of the Coombs'<br />
Task Force recommendations has shown that it is capable of<br />
taking tough decisions which offend powerful vested interests.<br />
Mr. Snedden's extraordinary series of undertakings constitute<br />
a sell-out to every vested interest that has been affected by<br />
our decisions. We well remember how fundamentally Mr. Snedden's<br />
economic policies changed when he moved from Minister for Labour<br />
and National Service to the Treasury when he changed his advisers,<br />
he changed his policieb. Now he has lost his advisers, he has<br />
lost his policies. His confused series of undertakings are<br />
completely negative. He simply wishes to reverse decisions the<br />
Australian Labor Government has made. Australians may well ask<br />
we know what Mr. Snedden is against -but what is he for? At a<br />
time of iritlation, the Australian people need a Government with<br />
political courage. At the very outset of this campaign, it is<br />
clear that the Opposition has none.<br />
