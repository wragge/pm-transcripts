COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
VIETNAM<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
,[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates,' 5 November 1968.]<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
-by leave-In September 1967 the President<br />
of the United States in a speech at<br />
San Antonio, Texas, publicly offered to halt<br />
all bombing of North Vietnam as soon as<br />
the North Vietnamese indicated that such a<br />
halt would lead promptly to serious and<br />
productive discussions on the substance of<br />
a peaceful settlement in South Vietnam.<br />
That offer was not accepted by Hanoi.<br />
theS uPbrseesqiudeennttl y, o rodne r3e dIs t aM acrecshs atoifo nt hios fy etahre,<br />
bombing over the major portion of North<br />
Vietnam-that part where 90% of the<br />
population lives and works-in the hope<br />
that that gesture and that renunciation of<br />
military advantage would lead the North<br />
Vietnamese Government to enter into those<br />
substantive negotiations designed to secure<br />
a just and enduring peace-a peace which<br />
his Government and the Government of<br />
Australia had for some time been advoicating.<br />
Bombardment was continued in the area<br />
of North Vietnam to the north of the<br />
demilitarised zone where troops and supplies<br />
for the invasion of South Vietnam were<br />
concentrated before flowing south. The<br />
President said then:<br />
I cannot in conscience stop all bombing as<br />
long as to do so would immediately and directly<br />
endanger the lives of our men and our allies.<br />
24975/ 68 In the result, the North Vietnamese<br />
made no reciprocal gesture towards lessening<br />
the intensity of the fighting in South<br />
Vietnam; nor were they prepared to enter<br />
into substantive peace talks designed to<br />
discuss the terms on which peace could be<br />
attained. They refused to enter into peace<br />
talks proper. They did however agree to<br />
have discussions on the question of whether<br />
there was any basis on which proper peace<br />
talks could begin. The talks were held in<br />
Paris, and have been continuing since<br />
May 1968.<br />
As a result of developments during those<br />
talks, the President recently formed the<br />
judgment that he<br />
began to get confirmation of the essential<br />
understanding that we had been seeking with the<br />
North Vietnamese on the critical issues between us.<br />
Those issues were 1. That he should have<br />
reason to believe that the other side intended<br />
seriously to join in de-escalating the war;<br />
2. That he should have grounds for believing<br />
that further reduction in bombing would<br />
not lead to an increase in American<br />
casualties; 3. That the right of the legitimate<br />
elected government of South Vietnam to<br />
take its place in serious peace negotiations<br />
should be secured; and 4. That serious<br />
negotiations on the substance of a peaceful<br />
settlement should begin. In return for these<br />
requirements being met, the President was<br />
prepared to cease bombing altogether and<br />
E961 AON 9 </p>
<p>to agree to representatives of the National<br />
Liberation Front being present on the North<br />
Vietnamese side of the negotiating table.<br />
I should however emphasise that this is<br />
no formal agreement by the North Vietnamese<br />
on de-escalation of the war but only<br />
a judgment on evidence available to the<br />
United States that this response will in fact<br />
take place. For his part, the President has<br />
made it clear, and I quote:<br />
that such talks cannot continue if they . takc<br />
military advantage of them. We cannot have<br />
productive talks in an atmosphere where the cities<br />
are being shelled and where the demilitarised zone<br />
is being abused.<br />
After President Johnson had announced<br />
the cessation of bombing and the results he<br />
expected to flow from it, I made the following<br />
statement on behalf of the Australian<br />
Government: As you have heard, President Johnson has<br />
announced that all air, naval and artillery activity<br />
on or within the territory of North Vietnam will<br />
be stopped at 8 a. m. Friday morning, Washington<br />
time-lI p. m. tonight our time.<br />
We have been consulted by the Government of<br />
the United States and kept fully informed of<br />
developments leading up to this announcement.<br />
It has been the attitude of the Australian<br />
Government that a suspension of bombing in<br />
North Vietnam would be justified only if in<br />
response some corresponding reduction in North<br />
Vietnamese military activity was occurring or could<br />
be expected to occur.<br />
The Americans have shared with us the information<br />
which has led them to conclude that they can<br />
be confident there will be such a response. We<br />
believe there are good grounds for their judgment<br />
and sincerely hope it will be proved right by future<br />
events. A further expected result is that representatives<br />
of the Government of North Vietnam intend to<br />
enter into serious and direct talks with the<br />
Government of the United States and the Government<br />
of the Republic of Vietnam on the substance<br />
of a peaceful settlement.<br />
As these results occur we believe that they hold<br />
out real hopes of future progress towards a just<br />
peace. We will not be seeking to participate in<br />
these talks at this stage.<br />
That is the present position. Just as the<br />
Australian Government in the past has consistently<br />
favoured genuine negotiation, so<br />
have we consistently supported President<br />
Johnson in his refusal to accept the advice<br />
offered from some quarters-that he<br />
should order the bombing stopped unconditionally;<br />
that is, without any grounds for<br />
belief that the safety of Allied troops would<br />
not be impaired and without any grounds<br />
for belief that such action would lead to substantive peace talks. In taking this stand,<br />
I believe events have proved us right.<br />
Cessation of the bombing and the admission<br />
of National Liberation Front representation<br />
as components of -the North Vietnamese<br />
negotiating team urged by some to<br />
be conceded without the reciprocal understandings<br />
which the President believes he<br />
now has would have been concessions made<br />
without any advance towards a peaceful<br />
settlement. Cessation of bombing and the<br />
participation of the National Liberation<br />
Front on the North Vietnamese side of the<br />
negotiating table on the understanding that<br />
de-escalation and serious peace talks will<br />
follow are concessions which do hold out<br />
the hope of an advance towards a peaceful<br />
solution and in those circumstances we<br />
welcome them with hope.<br />
The first course suggested, if taken, would<br />
have lowered our shield while the enemy's<br />
sword point was still levelled. The course<br />
now chosen lowers our shield, but only after<br />
the negotiations have led to good grounds<br />
for expecting that the enemy's sword point<br />
will be blunted and only after agreement to<br />
hold substantive discussions on peace have<br />
been achieved.<br />
I do not propose in any way to canvass<br />
the course which the negotiations may take<br />
or the problems which may arise. In a situation<br />
of this delicacy, on which so much may<br />
depend, I believe it would be positively<br />
harmful for anyone in this House to do this.<br />
But I should, I think, tell the House that<br />
my Government has advised -the Govern-<br />
, ment of South Vietnam that while we<br />
understand the reservations which it now<br />
has, we feel that its interests would ' best be<br />
served by its representatives attending the<br />
talks in Paris at the earliest possible date.<br />
They would attend as the representatives<br />
of the true and legitimate Government of<br />
South Vietnam. This is, in our view, a<br />
Significant fact because until now the<br />
Government of North Vietnam has refused<br />
any contacts or dealings with the South<br />
Vietnamese Government.<br />
In conclusion, Mr Speaker, I would say<br />
this. No-one can foretell how long -these<br />
negotiations will continue and it is possible<br />
that there will continue to be hard fighting<br />
while the negotiations progress. We hope<br />
not, but it is possible that this may occur.<br />
The seeds of peace have now sprouted but </p>
<p>the plant has still to grow before we can<br />
be sure that the people of South Vietnam<br />
will be able to decide their destiny in peace<br />
and by peaceful means. What is now<br />
occurring is in accord with the pledge of<br />
the Allied countries at the Manila Summit<br />
Conference that:<br />
We are now prepared to pursue any avenue<br />
which could lead to a secure and just peace<br />
whether through discussion and negotiation or<br />
through reciprocal actions by both sides to reduce<br />
the violence.<br />
Mr Speaker, neither the United States nor<br />
ourselves went to Vietnam to conquer-but<br />
only to prevent conquest of that country by<br />
North Vietnam. We sought to show that<br />
such military conquest was not possible.<br />
It may be-I say no more than that it may<br />
be-that the North Vietnamese have come to realise this, and that the negotiations to<br />
be held may produce the cessation of<br />
fighting and may produce the durable and<br />
lasting peace and the right of choice of the<br />
majority of people of South Vietnam, which<br />
we have sought from the beginning and<br />
for so long. If so, this is a consummation<br />
devoutly to be hoped for and I know that<br />
all Australians will join with the Government<br />
in seeking to do all possible to ensure<br />
that the talks attain the results so sought. In<br />
the meantime, we should not have too<br />
sanguine expectations of too early a settlement-<br />
and we shall need to keep our<br />
resolution -unimpaired.<br />
Mr Speaker, I present the following<br />
paper: Vietnam, Ministerial Statement, 5th November<br />
1968.<br />
BY AUTHORITY: A. J. ARTHUR, COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT PRINTER, CANBERRA, A. C. T. </p>
