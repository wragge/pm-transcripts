<p>[inaudible] Simon Crean today?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think I should say anything about who the Labor Party should choose as leader. Inevitably whatever I say will sound self-serving. It is a matter for the Labor Party to resolve. The only observation in the way of personalities I would make is that the Labor Party's enduring problem is lack of policy. They seem to have only one attitude to life, and that is they oppose everything the Government puts forward. They've done that under Beazley and they've done that under Crean. That's their big problem. But as to who should lead them, that's a matter for them and I don't intend to give any gratuitous advice which of course would be properly and totally ignored.</p>
