PRI M'E'MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL 8.00 PM SATURDAY 16 MAY 1992<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
TO THE 35TH BIENNIAL CONFERENCE OF<br />
THE ZIONIST FEDERATION OF AUSTRALIA<br />
GRAND HYATT HOTEL, MELBOURNE 16 MAY 1992<br />
AUSTRALIA. ISRAEL AND THE MIDDJLE. EAST<br />
Thank you for inviting me to the 35th Biennial Conference of<br />
the Zionist Federation of Australia.<br />
I am very pleased to be here.<br />
The fact that, as Acting Prime Minister, I spoke at your<br />
last conference in 1990 can only be read as proof of the<br />
constancy of both of us.<br />
In those two years extraordinary events have occurred,<br />
extraordinary changes have taken place.<br />
So it is important that some things are constant.<br />
It is important that we talk together and understand each<br />
other. The Zionist Federation of Australia and the Australian<br />
Government have enjoyed a long and mutually productive<br />
relationship, and I havd no doubt that we will continue to<br />
do so.<br />
You can be sure that the Australian Government values the<br />
Federation's opinion just as you can be sure of our belief<br />
in the Federation's cause, Israel.<br />
This is a commitment of long standing. It is as old as the<br />
state of Israel, and it is as strong now as it was in the<br />
beginning. -AIAW </p>
<p>2<br />
We are also well aware that very often issues of concern to<br />
the Jewish community properly concern the Government on a<br />
broader front.<br />
We are conscious of the role the Zionist Federation plays in<br />
keeping policy issues before the Government and the public<br />
and we admire you for it.<br />
The Jewish community, of course, has long been in the<br />
forefront of Australian public life.<br />
In business, academia, science, arts and letters, politics<br />
and the law, the Jewish contribution to this place has been<br />
remarkable. The Jewish connection goes back to the First Fleet. It is<br />
present throughout the last two hundred years.<br />
Shortlists of the greatest Australians of this century<br />
always number among them two Jews John Monash and Isaac<br />
Isaacs and others could easily be added.<br />
Jewish Australians have played such a leading role in<br />
shaping this country in a sense it is not appropriate to<br />
distinguish them from other Australians.<br />
Beyond their individual contributions, there is a broader<br />
cultural influence I might even say, a civilising<br />
influence. By that I mean not just the obvious contributions of Jewish<br />
Australians to the life of the mind in Australia, or their<br />
enrichment of Australian culture by the traditions they<br />
brought with them.<br />
I also mean the lesson in tolerance which, by their presence<br />
here and their tragic history elsewhere, Jewish Australians<br />
have taught Anglo and Celtic Australians.<br />
As an outpost of British civilisation on the other side of<br />
the world, Australia was always prey to xenophobia and<br />
intolerance. Jewish Australians and intending Jewish settlers sometimes<br />
felt that before the War.<br />
During the War, when many of them were shamefully interned<br />
as enemy aliens, they felt it even more strongly.<br />
Australia was then a narrow, insular society.<br />
It is therefore one of the more amazing features of our<br />
recent history that we have become a nation which rightly<br />
prides itself on the diversity of its cultures and the<br />
tolerance of its outlook. </p>
<p>I might say in parenthesis that, of all the lessons to be<br />
learned from this transformation, none is more important<br />
than the capacity of Australians to embrace change.<br />
We are not as conservative as we sometimes think.<br />
We have achieved more in nation-building than we sometimes<br />
think. The Jewish community has played no small part in this in<br />
widening our horizons and keeping our minds open.<br />
They have been great settlers. Great Australians.<br />
Their success underlines the wisdom of committing this<br />
country to the principle of tolerance, and actively<br />
supporting cultural and religious diversity.<br />
I might say that I am very much of the view that, in<br />
pursuing these multicultural policies, we should in no way<br />
be compromising the principle of loyalty to Australia.<br />
Both the vitality and the cohesion of this society<br />
substantially depend on the right of all to express their<br />
cultural heritage and to receive equal treatment, regardless<br />
of race, culture or religion.<br />
But its essential strength must derive from an overriding<br />
loyalty to Australia, its interests and its liberal<br />
democratic values.<br />
In the end it is only this which will guarantee tolerance.<br />
Our strongest weapon against discrimination and racial or<br />
cultural vilification is the idea of Australia itself.<br />
While recognising that a great deal remains to be done to<br />
combat all the forms of exclusion which confront Australians<br />
of non-English speaking backgrounds, and that Aboriginal<br />
Australians still contend with discrimination, we can say<br />
that we have made great progress.<br />
Last year's Report of the National Inquiry into Racist<br />
Violence showed that Australia's experience of racist<br />
violence, intimidation and harassment is well below the<br />
levels of most other countries.<br />
But we must be vigilant, and we must actively promote the<br />
cause here and abroad.<br />
Domestically we are now examining possible terms of<br />
legislation to proscribe acts of racial vilification.<br />
Australia was the first country whose Parliament passed a<br />
motion in support of rescinding the infamous United Nations<br />
Resolution 3379_ which equated Zionism with racism. </p>
<p>And Australia was a co-sponsor of the UN action which led to<br />
the recission of the Resolution.<br />
The overwhelming vote in the General Assembly to overturn<br />
3379 sent a clear signal that the UN will not be used as a<br />
vehicle for propaganda, or for the promulgation of doctrines<br />
which are racist or unjust.<br />
Our support for the UN action sent a signal that Australia<br />
will express publicly its abhorrence of racism in all its<br />
forms, and will actively support international action to<br />
focus attention on the unacceptablity of racist doctrines.<br />
The UN decision was particularly timely, in view of some<br />
worrying political developments in Europe, where right-wing<br />
groups with anti-Semitic platforms appear to be growing in<br />
influence. I think it was also evidence that there is a new<br />
determination in the international community to take a more<br />
balanced approach to the problems of the Middle East.<br />
Above all, recission of Resolution 3379 was a positive step<br />
towards removing the obstacles to peace in the region.<br />
Partly to mark the overthrow of the Resolution, we were<br />
visited this year by Mr Simcha Dinitz, the Executive<br />
Chairman of the World Zi-onist Federation and the man<br />
responsible for organising the emigration of over 400,000<br />
Jews from the former Soviet Union.<br />
Mr Dinitz explained to me the importance of continuing<br />
migration to Israel, bringing as it does highly trained<br />
people to contribute to the development of Israeli society.<br />
Naturally we found common ground on this we too depend on<br />
migration to stimulate economic growth and add vitality to<br />
society. Mr Dinitz and I also had the opportunity to frankly exchange<br />
views on current developments in the Middle East peace<br />
process. Ladies and gentlemen, it is important that the Australian<br />
Government continue this valuable dialogue with the Zionist<br />
movement. It is important for the specific reason that Israel is a<br />
great cause.<br />
It is important for the general reason that we recognise, as<br />
a principle of tolerance, the right of ethnic groups to take<br />
a close interest in the affairs of their cultural homelands.<br />
We expect of all Australians an unequivocal loyalty to<br />
Australia, but we do not expect the bonds of culture to be<br />
cut, or old sympathies to disappear. </p>
<p>We know that for Jewish Australians those bonds are very<br />
strong. Israel is a cherished place, a natural focus of attention.<br />
The Australian Government takes the view that these<br />
sentiments are natural and, in any case, inescapable and<br />
irreversible. We expect from Jewish Australians some active lobbying on<br />
foreign policy issues, particularly now as Israel faces a<br />
fluid international outlook and is reinvigorated by a<br />
massive influx of Jews from the former Soviet Union.<br />
We are attentive to your representations.<br />
But of course we have to decide Australian policy on the<br />
basis of a wider view of Australian interests.<br />
As you are all aware, the Australian Labor Party has been<br />
consistent in its commitment to Israel.<br />
This dates from strong links between the Australian Jewish<br />
community and Labor Party in office through the 1940s.<br />
Like many others, my party saw the establishment of Israel<br />
in moral terms. As international redress of the shameful<br />
horror of the Holocaust.<br />
The Chifley Government and Dr Evatt, as Chairman of the UN<br />
Committee on Palestine, gave important political support to<br />
Israel at the time of its creation at the United Nations.<br />
Since Israel's achievement of independence and modern<br />
statehood in 1948, Australia has been proud to support its<br />
fundamental right to security, territorial integrity and its<br />
freedom to pursue its national development in peace.<br />
Let me assure you, in unequivocal terms that Australia<br />
remains, as we have been over the past 44 years, wholly<br />
committed to Israel's independence and territorial<br />
integrity. In commenting on contemporary Australian policy towards the<br />
Middle East, I should say at the outset that our approach is<br />
tempered by realism.<br />
Australia is not a major player in Middle Eastern affairs.<br />
We do have significant trading interests in a number of<br />
Middle Eastern countries.<br />
The region lies across some of our principal communication<br />
routes. Like other responsible countries, we are concerned at the<br />
implications for global security of conflict in the region. </p>
<p>But we do not have any illusions about our influence in the<br />
region, or any pretensions to assume anything other than our<br />
traditional support of international stability and efforts<br />
to find a just and lasting peace.<br />
Australia's policy towards the Israel-Arab dispute is a<br />
balanced one which takes account of political realities in<br />
the region.<br />
As a non-participant, our broad policy objective is to<br />
encourage all parties to recognise that long-term peace and<br />
stability in the region can only be achieved through<br />
negotiated settlement.<br />
This must be based on mutual respect of the national<br />
interests and aspirations of both Israelis and Arabs.<br />
As we see it, Israel's independence and security are<br />
ultimately dependent on its being able to find a stable<br />
accommodation, a modus vivendi, with its Arab neighbours.<br />
Australia is not only committed to Israel's security, but<br />
also recognises the right of the Palestinian people to selfdetermination.<br />
This allows, logically, for the possibility of their own<br />
independent state if they so choose.<br />
The Australian Government seeks to encourage, wherever and<br />
whenever possible, dialogue which offers hope to all those,<br />
Israelis and Arabs alike, who have a genuine desire to live<br />
in peace.<br />
Over the years, Australia has been willing to play its part<br />
in a number of peacekeeping operations in the Middle East.<br />
We have also been consistent in raising concerns about human<br />
rights violations throughout the region.<br />
During the two years since I spoke to you at your last<br />
conference, there have been momentous changes in<br />
international relations.<br />
The end of the Cold War has provided an opportunity to<br />
restructure international security arrangements, to define a<br />
new approach towards collective security.<br />
This was demonstrated forcefully by the international<br />
community's response to Iraq's aggression against Kuwait.<br />
For the first time, the United Nations functioned<br />
effectively in enforcing international law, as it was<br />
originally intended to do nearly half a century ago.<br />
The unprecedented international consensus and cooperation in<br />
responding to Iraq's invasion were only possible in the new<br />
international climate created by the dissipation of the<br />
superpower rivalry between East and West. </p>
<p>For its part, Australia recognised the wider international<br />
ramifications of Saddam Hussein's criminal actions.<br />
I was part of the Australian Government's decision to make a<br />
substantial commitment to the multinational naval force in<br />
the Gulf.<br />
During the Gulf War, Australians were horrified at the<br />
indiscriminate targeting of Israel's civilian population by<br />
Saddam Hussein.<br />
The Australian Government expressed at the time its<br />
condemnation of the brutality of the Scud missile attacks on<br />
Israel, and of the crude attempt by Iraq to undermine<br />
international efforts to expel it from Kuwait.<br />
We were impressed most of all, however, by Israel's<br />
restraint in not becoming involved in the conflict, despite<br />
direct attacks on its territory and people.<br />
The aftermath of the Gulf War has provided a rare<br />
opportunity to start on the long road towards peace in the<br />
Middle East.<br />
The new environment of international rapprochement has<br />
encouraged Israel and its Arab neighbours to take a fresh<br />
look at the issues dividing them.<br />
The Australian Government's sincere hope is that the Middle<br />
East peace talks which began in Madrid last October will<br />
enable the parties to the dispute to take full advantage of<br />
this historic opportunity, and negotiate a truly just and<br />
lasting peace.<br />
We recognise that progress on substantial issues is not<br />
likely to be rapid.<br />
But the process itself of dialogue and negotiation should,<br />
incrementally, improve the political and security climate<br />
between Israelis and Arabs.<br />
This, the world still hopes, will gradually build mutual<br />
respect between Israel and its neighbours, without which no<br />
permanent trust can ever be established.<br />
It is only upon such trust that a lasting peace can be<br />
built. We have been disappointed that much of the peace discussions<br />
so far have been taken up with procedural wrangling, and<br />
that violence has continued, especially in Lebanon and the<br />
Occupied Territories, while the peace talks have been<br />
underway. The Australian Government has consistently called on all<br />
parties to exercise restraint, to give the negotiations a<br />
chance. </p>
<p>One encouraging aspect of the peace process so far has been<br />
a degree of moderation on the part of the Palestinian<br />
negotiators. We have also observed that the Palestinian Liberation<br />
Organisation has played a more positive role in encouraging<br />
the peace process over the past six months.<br />
In recognition of this development, the Australian<br />
Government recently announced that we would restore our<br />
policy on official contact with the PLO to what it had been<br />
before the Gulf War.<br />
In response to the PLO's support for Iraq's invasion of<br />
Kuwait, restrictions were imposed in January 1991 which<br />
barred Australian Ministers and officials from initiating<br />
contact with the PLO. Those restrictions have now been<br />
lifted. The restoration to our earlier policy on contact with the<br />
PLO is consistent with our long-established aim of<br />
encouraging the forces of moderation rather than extremism<br />
within the PLO.<br />
I am aware that this issue is one of considerable<br />
sensitivity to your Federation, and one you will no doubt<br />
want to continue discussing with us.<br />
Let me assure you that the Government's recent decision is<br />
neither an endorsement of the PLO, nor an absolution of the<br />
organisation's past actions.<br />
Nor has there been any change in the government's basic<br />
policy towards the PLO.<br />
We do not accept the PLO's claim to be the sole<br />
representative of the Palestinian people, but we do accept<br />
that the organisation represents the view of a significant<br />
proportion of them.<br />
Accuracy of the record also requires me to mention another<br />
issue on which our views may differ.<br />
Along with many other countries including the United States,<br />
Australia has long expressed its opposition to Israel's<br />
continued settlement activity in the Occupied Territories.<br />
As friends of Israel, we have to say that we regard such<br />
activity as an obstacle to peace.<br />
I discussed this question at some length with Mr Dinitz<br />
during our meeting in Canberra last March. He acknowledged<br />
there is a range of opinion on settlement policy in Israeli<br />
political circles. </p>
<p>9<br />
As an outside party, Australia respects the complexity and<br />
sensitivity of the various questions involved in the Middle<br />
East peace talks.<br />
We simply urge all parties to exercise the courage and<br />
resourcefulness necessary to make the most of the current<br />
relatively favourable international environment.<br />
The Australian Government has taken a strong interest in the<br />
plight of Syria's Jewish population.<br />
Australia has been making direct representations to Syria<br />
for several years on discrimination against Jews.<br />
It is pleasing to note recent reports that the Syrian<br />
Government has lifted restrictions on travel abroad by<br />
Syrian Jews, and on the disposition of property by the<br />
Jewish community there.<br />
The Government will, of course, be monitoring the situation<br />
closely to see whether in practice whole Jewish families are<br />
able to leave Syria.<br />
I should add here that the Syrian Government's decision<br />
represents a significant confidence-building measure in the<br />
context of the Middle East peace process.<br />
It is exactly the kind of step Australia has been urging on<br />
all parties to the process to follow in order to promote a<br />
spirit of moderation and flexibility in the current<br />
negotiations.<br />
One of the subjects your Federation has actively pursued<br />
with the Australian Government is the Arab economic boycott<br />
of Israel.<br />
Australia has consistently opposed the boycott, and has<br />
repeatedly urged Arab governments to dismantle it as a<br />
gesture of goodwill.<br />
The boycott, apart from being morally untenable, is a<br />
barrier to progress in the Middle East peace process.<br />
Earlier this year, the Government reminded Australian<br />
Chambers of Commerce that they do not have, and should not<br />
claim to have, any official authorisation for issuing<br />
certificates which effectively comply with the Arab boycott.<br />
We are not persuaded that legislation against the boycott is<br />
appropriate, but the Government is keeping that possibility<br />
under active review.<br />
As I noted earlier, Australia and Israel are nations built<br />
largely on immigration.<br />
We each grapple in our own way with a constantly evolving<br />
process of reconciliation among different cultural, social<br />
and political groupings within our societies. </p>
<p>It is characteristic of immigrant nations, that we draw<br />
strength from our diversity, from our need to be conscious<br />
always of new perspectives and new ways to achieve our<br />
national priorities.<br />
We draw strength from exercising tolerance.<br />
Nations such as ours are uniquely placed to be receptive to<br />
change, to embrace it and profit from it.<br />
This is why I feel it appropriate to speak to you about the<br />
need now for Israel to make the most of international<br />
change, and to persevere in dialogue and negotiation with<br />
its Arab neighbours.<br />
Equally, Australia urges Israel's Arab neighbours to come to<br />
terms with Israel and recognise its right to exist as an<br />
independent state.<br />
My comments have been offered in the spirit of frank and<br />
vigorous dialogue which characterises the Australian<br />
Government's close relations with your Federation.<br />
We have a long relationship, and a productive one.<br />
You can be sure the Government sets a very high value on it.<br />
Thank you once again for having me. I wish you well with the<br />
conference. </p>
