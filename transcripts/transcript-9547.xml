PRIME MINISTER 31/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
TASMANIA AND THE NATIONAL FOREST POLICY STATEMENT<br />
I welcome the signing by Tasmania of the National Forest Policy Statement. The<br />
signing means that the Statement is now truly national, with all States and<br />
Territories party to it.<br />
The Federal Government and the Tasmanian Government are now in a position to<br />
work together to provide a long term future for an ecologically sustainable timber<br />
industry and to put into place a system of comprehensive, adequate and<br />
representative reserves to protect Tasmania's unique forests.<br />
The Commonwealth and the Tasmanian Government have also signed a Statement<br />
of Intent on forest management. This will enable an early start to be made on the<br />
environmental, heritage, social and economic studies necessary for the<br />
development of a Regional Forest Agreement ( RFA).<br />
Importantly, it also guarantees protection of extensive areas of high conservation<br />
value forest, pending the development of the RFA.<br />
Subject to the outcome of the Commonwealth's statutory processes, Tasmania and<br />
the Commonwealth have agreed to a rescheduling plan. This will maintain<br />
employment in the industry, by shifting logging activities to coupes of lower<br />
conservation value than those on the Commonwealth's interim protection list.<br />
Tasmania has agreed to protect all areas on the interim protection list and the<br />
Commonwealth will provide bridging assistance to Tasmania for road expenses<br />
resulting from the rescheduling.<br />
These agreements are sound outcomes for both Governments, and for the<br />
environment and the industry.<br />
( Note: The NFPS was signed by the Commonwealth and the other States and<br />
erritories at COAG in Perth in December 1992).<br />
