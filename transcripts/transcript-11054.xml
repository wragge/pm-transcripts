<p>  DALLY:</p>
<p>  Welcome to A Current Affair.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Helen.</p>
<p>  DALLY:</p>
<p>  Now isn't your stand on this really just rhetoric and grandstanding because</p>
<p>   states are the only ones who can really make any changes and they so substantially</p>
<p>   dependent on gambling revenues?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it is not just rhetoric, I admit that it's very hard but I can't as</p>
<p>   Prime Minister ignore the fact that there are 300,000 people who lose on</p>
<p>   average $12,500 a year, most of them can't afford it. There will be many</p>
<p>   Australian children who will have a pretty miserable Christmas because their</p>
<p>   parents have become problem gamblers. Now, I am not pretending that is going</p>
<p>   to be easy, I'm not setting a high sort of benchmark of achievement, but</p>
<p>   we've had for the first time a very careful analysis of the problem and</p>
<p>   I have invited all of the Governments to join in tackling it. It is just</p>
<p>   not enough to say well it's too hard. I hope over time if we all work together,</p>
<p>   including the gambling industry, including people in welfare groups that</p>
<p>   we can make a difference. I am not trying to stop Australians gambling.</p>
<p>   It's part of our life and for most part it's a very pleasurable, sensible</p>
<p>   activity which people get a lot of fun out of.</p>
<p>   DALLY:</p>
<p>   But you are clearly worried about it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am worried about the fact that there are 250, 000 to 300,000 people whose</p>
<p>   lives have literally been blighted or destroyed.</p>
<p>   DALLY:</p>
<p>   It's a very damning Productivity Report.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is a very damning report and you just can't, difficult though it is,</p>
<p>   you can't ignore these things. It is not particularly easy, I can't see</p>
<p>   how it's grandstanding because some people will say, "gee what is he</p>
<p>   on about, what's he trying to do?" I am not trying to tell a responsible</p>
<p>   gambler he or she shouldn't do it what I am signalling is the fact there</p>
<p>   is a hardcore, quite a significant number of people for whom it is a problem</p>
<p>   and we do need to try and find solutions. I am also concerned about the</p>
<p>   potential for the expansion for the gambling facilities on the Internet</p>
<p>   and one of the things this Ministerial Council will look at is the feasibility</p>
<p>   and the consequences of trying to prohibit Internet gambling. And we're</p>
<p>   not alone on that - the Americans are having a look at that at the present</p>
<p>   time.</p>
<p>   DALLY:</p>
<p>   But Internet gambling is at the moment almost non-existent, it is a very</p>
<p>   tiny future potential.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is also one of the reasons we should be looking at it. I mean it is much</p>
<p>   easier to anticipate something and do something about it then try and close</p>
<p>   the stable door after the horse has bolted.</p>
<p>   DALLY:</p>
<p>   Ok, but is that an admission that you can't do really anything about reducing</p>
<p>   what's out there now?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it is very hard to roll back. It is not so hard to stop further</p>
<p>   expansion of facilities it is not so hard or though very difficult nonetheless</p>
<p>   to try and assist in different ways people who have a problem and that means</p>
<p>   obliging more information to be made available to the public about odds.</p>
<p>   It means instilling a greater sense of responsibility in some of the gambling</p>
<p>   outlets.</p>
<p>   DALLY:</p>
<p>   But you haven't committed any Commonwealth funds to doing those very things</p>
<p>   today, have you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Helen, today wasn't the day for announcing funds.</p>
<p>  DALLY:</p>
<p>  Why not?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Because the first thing to do is set up the structure and then talk to the</p>
<p>   governments and obviously if some resources are needed well they'll be provided</p>
<p>   but we will also expect the states to make a contribution as well.</p>
<p>  DALLY:</p>
<p>  Sure, but would you concede . . .</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  It is not enough for the states to just say well it is too hard because</p>
<p>   we are reliant on revenue from gambling.</p>
<p>  DALLY:</p>
<p>  But would you concede they are, I mean some of the states would seem to</p>
<p>   be addicted to gambling revenue?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, because it has been an easy buck for many of them, an easy buck. And</p>
<p>   I think it is important that we understand that and, look, it is one of</p>
<p>   those issues that the easier thing for me would be too say well this is</p>
<p>   all too hard.</p>
<p>  DALLY:</p>
<p>  Well in a sense you are saying that it is very difficult.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I know . . .</p>
<p>  DALLY:</p>
<p>  You may not get anywhere.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But I am prepared to have a go at it. I am prepared to implement the findings</p>
<p>   of the Productivity Commission inquiry, I am prepared to examine anticipatory</p>
<p>   action in relation to the Internet, I am prepared to engage all of the states</p>
<p>   and the welfare organisations and the gambling industry in trying to tackle</p>
<p>   the problem of problem gamblers. Now . . .</p>
<p>   DALLY:</p>
<p>   Okay, are you prepared to replace the revenue that states are very dependent</p>
<p>   on from gambling, with other revenue?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The GST over time will be a growth tax. Once it gets in operation the revenue</p>
<p>   from that will grow and it will give the states greater flexibility but</p>
<p>   .</p>
<p>   DALLY:</p>
<p>   Can I just pick you up on that point because the New South Wales Government</p>
<p>   has said this afternoon that it won't be nearly enough and could take ten</p>
<p>   years.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Can I say Helen that state governments always say that. From the beginning</p>
<p>   of time state governments always say that. It is an easy way out to say</p>
<p>   "well look we can't do anything about it because we are relying on</p>
<p>   the federal government, it doesn't give us enough money". Look I don't</p>
<p>   think the public who is more concerned about problem gamblers think that</p>
<p>   is an adequate response. I think what they want the New South Wales Government</p>
<p>   to do is to cooperate with me and not namecall and not say, "well it</p>
<p>   is all too hard" and try and find a solution because there are thousands</p>
<p>   of people whose lives are really blighted and destroyed because they have</p>
<p>   become problem gamblers and I can't walk away from that.</p>
<p>   DALLY:</p>
<p>   Yes, but is there anything really concrete in what you have announced today</p>
<p>   that will let people think that you have shown leadership on this and that</p>
<p>   you are going to stop the problem gambling?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the very fact that I am as Prime Minister putting it on the agenda</p>
<p>   and saying that this is something governments have got to work together</p>
<p>   to try and stop. I am not in a position to announce the solution tonight.</p>
<p>   I am not a miracle maker, but I do as Prime Minister recognise that it is</p>
<p>   a significant social problem. We can make a start and make a real indent</p>
<p>   on real areas of gambling. We can as a community at least say the facilities</p>
<p>   we now have are enough and that there is no case for further expansion of</p>
<p>   facilities. And I've taken action as a Prime Minister to stop facilities</p>
<p>   being expanded in an area where I had control and capacity to do it - that</p>
<p>   is international air travel out of this country. I made it clear some time</p>
<p>   ago that I wouldn't agree to a proposal that gambling facilities be put</p>
<p>   on international airlines coming out of this country.</p>
<p>   DALLY:</p>
<p>   Would you support the Democrats' claim to want to limit poker machines?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is something I have an open mind on . .</p>
<p>   DALLY:</p>
<p>   But you won't commit tonight?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Helen I don't control poker machines anywhere in Australia. They're</p>
<p>   controlled by state governments and this is an area that needs to be discussed.</p>
<p>   I mean I am pleased to note that the new Victorian Government has said it</p>
<p>   wants to put limits on the number of poker machines and a number of state</p>
<p>   governments are concerned about this. And one of the other dimensions of</p>
<p>   gambling is that small business is very, very badly affected. Now it is</p>
<p>   very easy to say "well look what are all the answers?". I don't</p>
<p>   have all the answers now but I at least have a commitment as Prime Minister</p>
<p>   to try and find them and to recognise that this is a big social problem</p>
<p>   and what we are trying to do is balance the natural desire of all of us</p>
<p>   to have a bet and it is a perfectly human condition with the recognition</p>
<p>   that some of us can't handle it.</p>
<p>   DALLY:</p>
<p>   Okay Prime Minister on that note we will leave it there. Thank you for your</p>
<p>   time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>   DALLY:</p>
<p>   Happy Christmas to you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You too.</p>
