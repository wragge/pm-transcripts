I PNG Independence Bill<br />
legislation; therefore it should have a speedy<br />
passage. Honourable members might be interested to<br />
know that Australia's sister Commonwealth<br />
country, Canada, sent people to Australia a few<br />
years ago to look at the working of our legislation.<br />
Canada embodied some of our administrative<br />
arrangements, as it saw or interpreted<br />
them, to form part of the law that it has passed in<br />
this area. I suppose both sides of the House can<br />
take credit for what has happened, flimsy though<br />
the arrangements may have been and even<br />
though they were criticised by us when they were<br />
introduced and have since been criticised by<br />
honourable members opposite for not being<br />
further extended by us. Neverteless the legislation<br />
has worked fairly effectively and I think to<br />
the advantage of industry that very vague area<br />
we call the national interest. I commend the Bill<br />
to the House and hope that, as the shadow<br />
Treasurer indicated, there will be no opposition<br />
to it here and therefore presumably no opposition<br />
to it elsewhere.<br />
Debate ( on motion by Mr Elicott) adjourned.<br />
PAPUA NEW GUINEA INDEPENDENCE<br />
BILL 1975<br />
Bill presented by Mr Whitlain and read a first<br />
time. Second Reading<br />
Mr WHITLAM ( Werriwa-Prime Minister)<br />
( 3.2 1)-1 move:<br />
That the BUi be now read a second time.<br />
The legislation which I now introduce-this<br />
Bill and the next 4 Bills which I shall move be<br />
read a second time-is historic for Papua New<br />
Guinea, for Australia, and for the European civilisation<br />
from which we Australians spring, for<br />
this is almost the last episode in the great postwar,<br />
post-imperial exercise of European<br />
decolonisation. By an extraordinar twist of history,<br />
Australia-herself once a colony-became<br />
one of the world's last colonial powers. By this<br />
legislation, we not only divest ourselves of the<br />
last significant colony in the world, but we divest<br />
ourselves of our own colonial heritage. It should<br />
never be forgotten that in making our own<br />
former colony independent, we as Australians<br />
enhance our own independence. Australia was<br />
never truly free until Papua New Guinea became<br />
truly free.<br />
Ile purpose of this legislation is to enable<br />
Papua New Guinea to become independent on<br />
16 September 1975, the date nominated by the<br />
Papua New Guinea House of Assembly. The 20 August 1975 REPRESENTATIVES 293<br />
legislation includes 4 Bills which are associated<br />
in various ways with Papua New Guinea's move<br />
to independence. I shalif Ii may, deal with each<br />
of the Bills in turn in this speech.<br />
PAPUA NEW GUINEA INDEPENDENCE<br />
BILL<br />
The proposed Papua New Guinea Constitution<br />
does not depend for its validity on enabling<br />
Australian legislation. The Constitution of<br />
an independent Papua New Guinea is not to be<br />
dependent on an Act by another Parliament in<br />
the way that the Australian Constitution depends<br />
on an Act of the Imperial Parliament-the Parliament<br />
of Wesminster. Consequently the Papua<br />
New Guinea Independence Bill is a short one.<br />
Clause 4 provides that at the expiration of<br />
September Australia will cease to have any sovereignty,<br />
soverign rights or rights of administration<br />
in Papua New Guinea. This will enable the<br />
Papua New Guinea Constitution to come into<br />
effect the next day as the supreme law of Papua<br />
New Guinea.<br />
Clause 5 of the Bill repeals the Papua New<br />
Guinea Act 1949-75 under which Papua and the<br />
Trust Territory of New Guinea have been jointly<br />
administered for the past 26 years. It als ceases<br />
the extension to Papua New Guinea of every Act<br />
and imperial Act which hitherto extended. The<br />
Papua New Guinea Constitution will adopt<br />
those Acts and imperial Acts which Papua New<br />
Guinea wishes to continue as laws of Papua New<br />
Guinea. The Bill represents the culmination of threequarters<br />
of a century of association of the Australian<br />
Parliament with the development of<br />
Papua New Guinea. It is the end of a long<br />
chapter. We believe it is also the beginning of a<br />
new, a better chapter in the continuing story of<br />
the association between our 2 neighbour nations.<br />
That association, as far as this Parliament is concerned,<br />
began on 12 November 1901 with a<br />
resolution that Australia should assume responsibility<br />
for the administration of what was<br />
then British New Guinea. Subsequently, of<br />
course, Australia assumed responsibility for the<br />
administration of what had been German New<br />
Guinea, first, under a League of Nations mandate<br />
and, since 1946, under the present United<br />
Nations Trusteeship Agreement, which Australia<br />
will discharge in full when Papua New Guinea<br />
becomes an independent nation on 16<br />
September. Successive Australian Governments have<br />
given an undertaking to the Trusteeship Council<br />
and to the United Nations General Assembly to<br />
bring a united Papua New Guinea-the whole </p>
<p>294 REPRESENTATIVES 20 August 1975<br />
territory over which we assumed or were given<br />
control-not just to independence but to united<br />
independence. We must all be worried at this<br />
moment that it is possible that we have failed to<br />
fulfil completely the mandate to carry out in full<br />
the trust we were given. Should that prove to be<br />
the case, it will be because, perhaps with the best<br />
will in the world, we delayed somewhat too long.<br />
At Goroka in April 1965 I had advocated<br />
independence by 1970.<br />
What is certain, however, is that Australia's<br />
major efforts to carry out the mandate and to<br />
fulfil her trusteeship were well and highl<br />
motivated. It would be impossible in this speech<br />
to pay tribute to all those Australians who have<br />
tried to serve Papua New Guinea well, and in so<br />
doing have tried to serve Australia well. It is best<br />
therefore that I confine myself exclusively to<br />
members of this present Parliament The role of<br />
the honourable member for Kooyong ( Mr<br />
Peacock) when he was Minister for External<br />
Territories was crucial. I frequently-here in<br />
Canberra and in Port Moresby-paid tribute to<br />
it. I do so again. I particularly wish to mention<br />
those who are now Ministers who accompanied<br />
me in my tours of Papua New Guinea in January<br />
1970 and January 1971. They are the present<br />
Treasurer ( Mr Hayden) and the Minister for<br />
Education ( Mr Beazley), who were with me in<br />
1970 and the present Minister for Defence ( Mr<br />
Morrison) and Minister for Science and Consumer<br />
Affairs ( Mr Clyde Cameron), who were<br />
with me in 1971. The Minister for Defence subsequently<br />
fulfilled the ultimate part of us all in<br />
this great work.<br />
It is hard, in retrospect, to understand the obloquy,<br />
the hatred, the contempt, and even worse,<br />
the ridicule, which we brought upon ourselves in<br />
those far off days-a whole 5 years ago-when we<br />
first stated that the independence of Papua New<br />
Guinea was imminent and inevitable. It was not<br />
easy in those days to live with the accusation-as<br />
in particular, the Minister for Education, the<br />
Treasurer and I had to live with it in the early<br />
months of 1970-that we had stirred up and<br />
should be blamed for possible bloodshed. It was<br />
said of me-in the newspapers and in this<br />
Parliament-that by my efforts to point out the<br />
inescapable fact that Papua New Guinea was<br />
already providing more leaders than Australia<br />
could ever impose or be willing to provide, I<br />
would have ' blood on my hands'. The words are<br />
those of the then Prime Minister, the right<br />
honourable member for Higgins ( Mr Gorton). It<br />
was charged then against the present Minister<br />
for Education and myself that, by speaking to the<br />
people of Rabaul about how to achieve the ends they then sought by peaceful means, we were in<br />
fact provoking violence. Those were the charges<br />
made, in the Australian newspapers, in the Australian<br />
Parliament.<br />
Our point then was this, as I said in Port<br />
Moresby in January 1970:<br />
Papua New Guinea is already rich in leadership. The time<br />
when that leadership will assume its full and proper responsibilities<br />
cannot be long delayed.<br />
To put these matters in their full historical<br />
perspective I ask leave to have incorporated in<br />
Hansard 2 documents-the joint statement by<br />
the honourable members for Werriwa, Fremantie<br />
and Oxley at Port Moresby on 12 January<br />
1970 and the joint statement by the honourable<br />
members for Werriwa, Hindmarsh and St<br />
George on 17 January 1971.<br />
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Dr Jenkins)-Is<br />
leave granted? There being no objection, leave is<br />
granted. ( The documents read as follows)-<br />
LABOR'S PLAN FOR NEW GUINEA<br />
STATEMENT BY THE LEADER OF THE<br />
OPPOSITION, MR E. G. WHITLAM, PORT<br />
MORESBY, 12 JANUARY 1970<br />
In the past fortnight Mr Beazley, Mr Hayden and I have<br />
talked to some thousands of New Guineans and talked with<br />
hundreds of elected persons, administrators, teachers and<br />
students who will soon be assuming even more responsibility<br />
for their country's affairs. New Guinea is already rich in<br />
leadership. The time when that leadership will assume its full<br />
and proper responsibilities cannot and must not be long<br />
delayed. 1. We quickly found that our most urgent and difficult task<br />
was to reassure the people and their leaders, and even expatriates,<br />
about Australia's relationship with New Guinea<br />
after self-government and after independence. We have<br />
been appalled to discover how widespread and deeply<br />
rooted is the impression that either independence or even<br />
self-government means the end of Australian concern and<br />
Australian help for this country. I make no comment about<br />
the origins of this falsehood. Any Australian who propagates<br />
it does a grave disservice to the people of Australia and the<br />
people of New Guinea.<br />
The plain fact is that for the rest of this century Australian<br />
governments will be formed by either the Labor Par or the<br />
Lberal Party. All members of the Australian Parliament<br />
have supported the quadrupling of Australian aid in the past<br />
decade. While the consensus which existed on New Guinea<br />
during Sir Paul Hasluck's administration has broken down<br />
under Mr Barnes, there is no diverence between the parties<br />
on this crucial point. It is Labor policy and it is Liberal policy<br />
that aid in finance and advice will continue. It is our firm belief<br />
that it will increase. It is certain that for the rest of this<br />
century at least Australia will be a donor nation to developing<br />
nations. New Guinea will long be a principal recipient.<br />
To emphasise the solemnity and sincerity of this undertaking,<br />
we have suggested that Australian assistance should be<br />
made pan of treaty arrangements between the constitutional<br />
government of an independent New Guinea and the<br />
Government of Australia. PNG Independence Bill </p>
<p>PNG Independence Bill<br />
2. Our second task has been to dear away fundamental<br />
misunderstanding about the reality of Australia's present<br />
relationship to New Guinea. Australia would not have been<br />
permitted to remain in New Guinea as trustee had she not<br />
promised to prepare New Guinea for independence. The<br />
governments of 112 nations have just called on Australia to<br />
transfer full executive and legislative powers to elected New<br />
Guineans. The fact of independence is just not negotiable.<br />
There is not nearly as much negotiability about the postponement<br />
of independence as some New Guineans and<br />
many Australians seem to assume. Australians who think<br />
that the United Nations need not be taken seriously may be<br />
more respectful of the United States. Anybody who doubts<br />
the seriousness of America's purposes on this matter is fooling<br />
himself.<br />
The Australian Parliament has responsibilities beyond<br />
New Guinea. Its primary responsibility is to the people of<br />
Australia. It has the responsibility of protecting the reputation<br />
and the relations of the nation with all countries. These<br />
are the responsibilities of the elected persons of the Australian<br />
Parliament and the elected government, and of no<br />
others, elected or non-elected. The Australian Parliament<br />
cannot escape or share this responsibility.<br />
Therefore it is either misleading or meaningless to assert<br />
that the decision for independence is one for the people of<br />
New Guinea alone. The form of independence is certainly<br />
for them to decide for themselves. The fact of independence<br />
has already been decided.<br />
STEPS AFTER THE NEXT ELECTIONS<br />
3. These two tasks of reassurance and clarification were<br />
responsibilities we accepted for the Australian people as a<br />
whole. We accepted a third task on behalf of our own party,<br />
the Australian Labor Party.<br />
An Australian election must be held by the end of 1972 at<br />
the latest It may be earlier. It is our belief that a Labor<br />
Government will emerge from those elections. We therefore<br />
felt it obligatory to indicate how a Labor Government would<br />
discharge its responsibilities to the people of Australia and its<br />
obligations to the people of New Guinea, including those<br />
Australians whose families and fortunes are at stake m New<br />
Guinea. New Guineans will have home rule as soon as a Labor<br />
Government can make the necessary arrangements with the<br />
House of Assembly which will also be elected in 1972.<br />
This means that laws made by the Assembly will no longer<br />
be subject to veto by the Australian Government; that all<br />
matters affecting the welfare of New Guincan people except<br />
defence and foreign affairs will be subject to laws made by<br />
the Assembly alone; and that those laws will be administered<br />
by a public service responsible only to the House of<br />
Assembly. Australians who remain in the service of the New Guinea<br />
Government will equally be responsible to the House of<br />
Assembly, but the Australian Government will accept responsibility<br />
for their salaries and the welfare of their<br />
families. The House of Assembly will decide the form of the constitution<br />
New Guinea is to have after independence.<br />
It is certain that the assumption of an increasing measure<br />
of responsibility will accelerate the desire and ability to<br />
accept total responsibility. In this sense it is true that the<br />
people of New Guinea will decide their own time-table for<br />
independence. Elements in the Administration, and in the expatriate<br />
community, are anxious to postpone every delegation of<br />
power to the Papua-New Guinea people into an indefinite<br />
future. Most disturbing is the open hostility in the Administration<br />
to those who have, if perhaps in gravely mistaken 20 August 1975 REPRESENTATIVES 295<br />
ways, attempted to assert their rights. The manner in which<br />
the Department of External Tertories endeavoured to enforce<br />
the sale of Bougainville land disqualifies those responsible<br />
for the policy from any clair" o have the well-being of<br />
the people at heart Batons and tear Oas have no place in<br />
land sales. This incredible exercise in the techniques of<br />
violent expropriation has shaken confidence. It threatens to<br />
create deep and enduring hatred against Australia and Australians.<br />
It is a factor underlying the Mataungan<br />
misunderstandings. IMMEDIATE STEPS<br />
4. Fourthly, we have seen there is a need for a far more<br />
systematic preparation of the country for self-government.<br />
Urgent needs in the Territory which should be the subject of<br />
immediate attention are:<br />
A reasonable minimum wage;<br />
An arbitration system for plantation workers and all<br />
labourers; An end to the shame whereby Australia's name is<br />
associated with plantation wages of $ 5 a month or<br />
less-the worst wages in the Pacific and probably the<br />
worst in the world.<br />
In New Guinea every industrial dispute is automatically a<br />
dispute between an Australian or an Australian company on<br />
one hand and New Guineans on the other. The Territory has<br />
moved to the position where the Workers' Associations<br />
should be treated seriously. We heard from workers'leaders,<br />
engaged in struggles to lift wages as low as $ 6 a week, that<br />
claims to private employers for wage increases simply went<br />
unacknowledged. Even worse, the Administration itself for<br />
months on end ignored wage claims from officially recognised<br />
workers' associations. It needs to be quite clear that<br />
salary and wage discrimination is the basis of every other<br />
form of discrimination.<br />
There has been a dear deterioration in race relations,<br />
reflected in the movement of battalions of police to Bougainville<br />
and Rabaul. There are more police in Rabaul than in<br />
any Australian city except Sydney and Melbourne. Australians<br />
in Papua-New Guinea are not in their own country.<br />
The whole direction of administration needs re-orientation.<br />
The basis of Australian policy should be discrimination in<br />
favour of the people whose country this is. Only discrimination<br />
in favour of the underprivileged can reduce<br />
inequality. The Department of External Territories, which rules,<br />
should become a Department of Pacific Relations, which<br />
advises. Australian officers should not be masters but envoys,<br />
not rulers but helpers. The best of them are. There is cause<br />
for pride in much done in health, education, communications,<br />
agriculture, and public works, and in the defence<br />
services. There is no cause whatever for pride in labour relations.<br />
This is the Achilles heel of the whole Australian position<br />
in New Guinea. It is full of danger for the near and distant<br />
future.<br />
Nor can we have any pride in the fact that in the five<br />
largest towns there is no local government, and no<br />
businesses, factories or even taxis owned by locals. In New<br />
Guinea commercial enterprise has become synonymous with<br />
expatriate enterprise.<br />
We have tried to impart a feeling not only of urgency but<br />
of self-confidence in the ability of New Guineans to make<br />
their own decisions. There are New Guineans who are well<br />
equipped to fill the highest political and administrative positions<br />
n their country. Indeed, no Australian could claim the<br />
contrary without reflecting on Australia's record of administration<br />
at its crucial point<br />
The House of Assembly and its members should now be<br />
taken seriously as the representatives of their people and </p>
<p>296 REPRESENTATIVES 20 August 1975<br />
treated by all Australians with proper respect and seriousness.<br />
The only thing in which New Guinea is really unique<br />
among the countries of the world is that alone among significant<br />
populations its people make no final decisions on<br />
any matter affecting their welfare.<br />
It is not unique in its economy, in the difference of economic<br />
standards between sections of the country, its educational<br />
or social standards, its need for economic aid from<br />
abroad, its need for advisers, the diversity of its local customs,<br />
or even the multiplicity of its languages.<br />
All these matters present complex and difficult problems<br />
for any future government of New Guinea.<br />
None of these problems require colonial rule for their solution<br />
or easing. In fact, many of them will worsen if foreign<br />
techniques, methods, laws and customs continue to exclude<br />
local custom, knowledge and experience.<br />
An outside administration cannot teach or impose unity. It<br />
can by errors unite a people against it. This is the very situation<br />
which Australians at home will not permit, and Australians<br />
in New Guinea must most avoid.<br />
STATEMENT BY THE LEADER OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY, MR E. G.<br />
WHITLAM, PORT MORESBY: 17.1.1971<br />
In the past year the political climate of Papua-New<br />
Guinea has been transformed. A year ago proposals for early<br />
self-government were met with official hostility and public<br />
dismay. Some elementary truths about the early and inevitable<br />
end of colonialism in Papua-New Guinea held the terror<br />
of the novel and the unknown. Now the most significant<br />
leaders of Papua-New Guinea and significant sections of the<br />
population accept that they must shortly come to terms with<br />
their own future as a self-governing nation. It has been a<br />
remarkable proof of the power of an idea. There can be no<br />
turning back now.<br />
For the past fortnight my colleagues and I have met and<br />
talked with some hundreds of the present and future leaders<br />
of Papua-New Guinea. Despite the vast improvement in the<br />
level of political debate in every part of the Territory, it is<br />
clear that political education has been woefully deficient.<br />
Again and again we asked the people if they had ever heard<br />
the Administration explain the advantages of self-government.<br />
Invariably, the answer was With the shining<br />
exception of the new Administrator himself, it would seem<br />
that practically nothing has been done to dispel confusion<br />
and fear about the meaning and consequences of selfgovernment.<br />
On the contrary, needless anxiety and false<br />
ears have been planted and nourished. Consequently my<br />
colleagues and I found that in many pans of the Territory<br />
our visit became a mission of reassurance that Australia s<br />
contribution to the welfare of Papua-New Guinea would be<br />
enhanced and expanded after self-government and later<br />
after independence.<br />
There can be no qualification about the depth of the commitment<br />
of the Australian Labor Party in this matter. The<br />
representative nature of the colleagues who have been with<br />
me in the Territory would alone ensure that. Beyond personal<br />
commitment, the Labor Party as a whole finds its most<br />
deeply-held conscientious convictions affronted in Papua-<br />
New Guinea. It would be impossible for a party like ours to<br />
condone or connive at vast inequalities, entrenched privilege,<br />
blatant exploitation and racial discrimination. These<br />
inescapable attributes of colonialism disfigure life in this colony,<br />
as in all other colonies. They debase the dedication,<br />
enterprise and energy devoted over the years by the many<br />
thousands of fine Australians who have worked in this Territory.<br />
Australia's role as a colonial power is a wrong thing in<br />
itself. It would be bad for us as a nation, even if we were able PNG Independence Bill<br />
to isolate ourselves from the pressures and opinions of all<br />
other countries; but we enjoy no such luxury of isolation. In<br />
particular, we live in a region in which every one of our<br />
neighbours for thousands of miles around were former colonies.<br />
Each detests colonialism. To all these neighbours and<br />
all our fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations<br />
every justification the Australian Government makes for<br />
dragging its feet in Papua-New Guinea, every argument<br />
about the inability of native peoples to govern themselves<br />
smacks of racial superiority.<br />
Australia's major diplomatic effort, not only at the United<br />
Nations but in most world capitals, is devoted to justifying<br />
the official position on Papua-New Guinea. This is a sterile<br />
exercise. It cripples our power for any constructive diplomatic<br />
initiatives. We are needlessly placed on the defensive;<br />
it needlessly complicates our relations with our neighbours<br />
and our friends, including our chief ally, the United States,<br />
which possesses the world's most powerful black community.<br />
All Australians must now realise how damaging and<br />
dangerous a reputation Australia's present policies produce.<br />
We are a European nation on the fringe of the most populous<br />
and deprived coloured nations in the world. What the world<br />
sees about Australia is that we have an Aboriginal population<br />
with the highest infant mortality rate on earth; that we<br />
have eagerly supported the most unpopular war in modem<br />
times on the ground that Asia should be a battle-ground of<br />
our freedom; that we fail to oppose the sale of arms to South<br />
Africa; that the whole world believes that our immigration<br />
policy is based on colour and that we run one of the world's<br />
ast colonies. We may rightly profess our good intentions and<br />
feel that we are merely the victims of special circumstances;<br />
but the combination of such policies leans heavily indeed on<br />
the world's goodwill and on Australia's credibility. The true<br />
patriot therefore will not seek to justify and prolong these<br />
policies but will seek to change them.<br />
In Papua-New Guinea, it will be found increasingly that<br />
the question for the timing of self-government involves a<br />
quibble about the matter of 2 or 3 years. Even if the Gonon<br />
Government were to survive, self-government will come in<br />
the lifetime of the next House of Representatives. The Australian<br />
Government has a clear duty to speed up preparations<br />
for the inevitable day. Target dates for selfgovernment<br />
and independence should be set now, as we are<br />
obliged to do by the unopposed decision of the United<br />
Nations General Assembly. The official members of the<br />
House of Assembly should be removed now. Elected ministers<br />
should be made responsible to the House of Assembly in<br />
fact. Political education should receive top priority. The Australian<br />
Parliament should immediately ratify the International<br />
Labour Organisation conventions on plantation<br />
workers and on race relations; a new set of labour laws and<br />
ordinances should be drafted and approved to make labour<br />
laws and conditions conform with these conventions. Employment<br />
preference should be given to unionists. The Australian<br />
Government should spell out clearly the entitlements<br />
of Australian public servants and should make it plain that it<br />
accepts responsibility for their future welfare, both in the<br />
Territory and in Australia; . only if this is done can localisation<br />
of the public service proceed speedily and smoothly.<br />
There is no need to wait until 1972 for these things to be<br />
done; they constitute in themselves the essence of selfgovernment.<br />
Australian and Australian companies have a particular<br />
interest in the establishment of a self-governing New<br />
Guinea. By its very nature, an Australian Administration committed<br />
to its own eventual abdication cannot guarantee the validity<br />
or permanency of business and investment arrangements<br />
it may make. </p>
<p>PNG Independence Bill<br />
The best safeguard against expropriation is that an<br />
indigenous independent government should accept responsibiliy<br />
for the laws and arrangements under which property is<br />
held and capital invested.<br />
There are dear risks in the present situation in which all<br />
employers and businessmen are expatriates while New<br />
G uineans are only employees and customers.<br />
In the final analysis the attitudes of the Australian Labor<br />
Party to Papua-New Guinea involve a convinced judgment<br />
about the very nature of man. We cannot accept that nations<br />
should be ruled by other nations; we cannot accept that men<br />
do not wish to be free; we cannot accept that the people of<br />
Papua-New Guinea are some special exception in a world<br />
where millions have died for national independence. It may<br />
he true that men cannot be forced to be free; it is certainly<br />
true that men cannot be forced to rule others. An Australian<br />
Labor Government will not be blackmailed into accepting<br />
an unnatural role as rulers over those who have had no say<br />
and can have no say in electing us. Australia's obli$ ation in<br />
the United Nations is to hand over Papua-New Guinea as a<br />
single entity as soon as possible. Papua-New Guinea has a<br />
chance of remaining united only if self-government comes<br />
quickly. Self-government in itself will be the real unifying<br />
frei. this country. To delay self-government is to promote<br />
separatism. Self-government must be given quickly to the<br />
people as a whole; otherws secio ar section will seize<br />
with anger and bitterness towards us what we should grant<br />
wholly and wholeheartedly.<br />
Mr WH1ITLAM-I thank honourable members.<br />
In these 2 statements the joint and continuing<br />
theme is that Papua New Guinea was<br />
already providing leadership at all levels greater<br />
than that which Australia was able or willing any<br />
longer to provide in Papua New Guinea.<br />
I now come to the other Bills. The Papua New<br />
Guinea Bill 1975 gives effect to an announcement<br />
the then Minister assisting the Minister for<br />
Foreign Affairs in matters relating to Papua New<br />
Guinea made on 16 September 1974 that<br />
Australia would hand over to Papua New<br />
Guinea the administration of the Pocklington<br />
Reef Islands. These islands are a small uninhabited<br />
group 130 kilometres east of the southeastern<br />
tip of Papua New Guinea. The Bill provides<br />
for the islands to be brought within the territorial<br />
scope of Papua New Guinea, so that at<br />
independence that country will exercise full sovereignty<br />
over the islands. The Bill also gives<br />
Papua New Guinea authority to enact off-shore<br />
legislation in the area around the islands. Papua<br />
New Guinea already has authority to enact legislation<br />
dealing with its off-shore adjacent areas as<br />
defined in the Australian Petroleum ( Submerged<br />
Lands) Act, but these adjacent areas do not<br />
include Pocklington Reef Islands. Clause 4 of the<br />
Bill amends the present authorisation and enables<br />
Papua New Guinea to enact legislation<br />
dealing with off-shore areas other than those to<br />
which the Australian Petroleum ( Submerged<br />
Lands) Act applies.<br />
The Papua New Guinea Loans Guarantee Bill<br />
1975 seeks the approval of Parliament to the 20 August 1975 REPRESENTATIVE 297<br />
continuation of the Australian Government<br />
guarantee, provided for in section 75A of the<br />
Papua New Guinea Act 1949-1975, in respect of<br />
loans raised by the Papua New Guinea Government<br />
from Australian and PNG sources prior to<br />
independence until such time as the loans in<br />
question have matured and been repaid. I would<br />
mention that loans Papuia New Guinea has<br />
raised from overseas sources are guaranteed<br />
until final maturity under separate legislation.<br />
The guarantees to be continued by this legislation<br />
and those provided in respect of overseas<br />
borrowings have assisted Papua New Guinea in<br />
undertaking its borrowing programs.<br />
The purpose of Papua New Guinea ( Staffing<br />
Assistance) Bill 1975 is to amend the Papua New<br />
Guinea ( Staffing Assistance) Act 1973 to<br />
introduce the new staffing aid arrangements<br />
which have recently been agreed between the<br />
Australian Government and the Papua New<br />
Guinea Government.<br />
The Papua New Guinea ( Staffing Assistance)<br />
Act 1973 established the Australian staffing assistance<br />
group as the framework under which<br />
former permanent overseas officers and contract<br />
officers from Australia could continue to serve in<br />
Papua New Guinea after self-government. Following<br />
a recent review of the future of these arrangements,<br />
it has been agreed with the Papua<br />
New Guinea Government that the direct employment<br />
by the Australian Government of the<br />
2700 members of the group-some of whom<br />
occupy senior and influential positions in the<br />
Papua New Guinea Public Service-is not in the<br />
immediate or Ion g-term interests of either<br />
Government, and should be discontinued. Accordingly,<br />
the 2 Governments have agreed that<br />
the group be wound up on 30 June next year and<br />
that new arrangements be introduced as from<br />
June this year to encourage those officers in the<br />
group whose services are still required to transfer<br />
over to direct contract employment with the<br />
Papua New Guinea Government as soon as<br />
practicable. The Papua New Guinea ( Staffing Assistance)<br />
Bill 1975 seeks to modify the present employment<br />
security scheme arrangements for those<br />
members of the group who agree to transfer over<br />
to direct contract employment with the Papua<br />
New Guinea Government. Most of the necessary<br />
changes required can and will be made by<br />
amendment of the existing regulations made<br />
under the Act. These will be explained in detail<br />
in due course.<br />
I turn finally to the Social Security Bill ( No. 2)<br />
1975. The object of this Bill is to amend the </p>
<p>298 REPRESENTATIVES 20 August 1975<br />
Social Security Act to enable former residents of<br />
external territories, including Papua New<br />
Guinea, to qualify for social services pensions if<br />
they come to Australia to live. It is proposed that<br />
residence in an external territory other than Norfolk<br />
Island will count as residence in Australia<br />
for the purpose of satisfying the residence<br />
qualifications for Australian social service pensions.<br />
Residence in Norfolk Island is excluded<br />
from the ambit of the Bill in view of the recent<br />
appointment of a royal commission into matters,<br />
including social security, relating to Norfolk<br />
Island. Most Australian expatriates living in the Territories<br />
will have already satisfied Australian pensions<br />
residence requirements. There are, however,<br />
many people who have lived in external<br />
territories for many years, sometimes for most of<br />
their lives, and who, if they were to come to live<br />
in Australia, would not be residentially qualified<br />
for Australian pensions under existing legislation.<br />
I am sure honourable members will agree<br />
it is appropriate that the valuable contribution<br />
made by these people to Territory development<br />
should be recognised. The estimated cost of the<br />
proposals in this Bill is $ 750,000 for the balance<br />
of the fiscal year 1975-76 and 1 m in a full year.<br />
These Bills together constitute the final legislative<br />
act-the last legislative instrument-in the<br />
relations between the Australian Parliament and<br />
Papua New Guinea. They constitute a new beginning<br />
in the relations between 2 free and<br />
independent nations. Previously, I had incorporated<br />
in Hansard statements of intent from the<br />
Australian Labor Party, now the Australian<br />
Government, towards a free united independent<br />
Papua New Guinea. Those pledges have been<br />
reinforced by statement after statement since we<br />
became the Government of Australia. They were<br />
pledges made not just for an Australian party,<br />
but for the Australian nation. They hold and<br />
hold firm-for the Australian Labor Party, for<br />
the Australian Government, for the Australian<br />
people. The people of Papua New Guinea know from<br />
their long experience-and let me re-state it-that<br />
Australia keeps her promises. But let this also be<br />
pointed out: A free Papua New Guinea is not a<br />
seventh State of Australia. It is a free and<br />
independent nation. The Chief Minister of<br />
Papua New Guinea is not a premier of a dependent,<br />
a claimant, State. Nationhood is real.<br />
Independence is real. Freedom is real. The<br />
Parliament-the House of Assembly-of Papua<br />
New Guinea is representative of a truly<br />
sovereign nation with true, valid, genuine international<br />
independent standing in the world. The PNG Independence Bill<br />
House of Assembly of Papua New Guinea is the<br />
Parliament of a sovereign nation. Papua New<br />
Guinea must aspire to that true sovereignty<br />
which no State under the Australian Constitution<br />
could ever have, or has ever had. Internationally,<br />
the Australian States do not exist. Papua New<br />
Guinea as a nation does exist. It will be recognised<br />
throughout the world as a new nation on<br />
16 September. All other nations will have to sit<br />
up and take notice of Papua New Guinea from<br />
now on. On 16 September, Papua New Guinea<br />
achieves true and genuine sovereignty which no<br />
Australian State-the 6 former colonies-ever<br />
had, or can ever have.<br />
By these Bills, we give Papua New Guinea its<br />
true international standing. Papua New Guinea<br />
from now on is going to need international aid.<br />
The absolute guarantee we give in this Australian<br />
Parliament is that aid will continue to<br />
come from Australia. But if free Papua New<br />
Guinea chooses in its own wisdom to augment<br />
that international aid from any other source,<br />
there can be, there should be, no complaint from<br />
Australia. Australia's responsibilities towards<br />
Papua New Guinea are inescapable, but Papua<br />
New Guinea has no special responsibilities<br />
towards Australia. Papua New Guinea has no<br />
more responsibilities towards Australia than any<br />
other independent nation has towards Australia.<br />
We have not divested ourselves of political authority<br />
over Papua New Guinea just in order to<br />
keep it in financial bondage. Papua New Guinea<br />
will always have the first call on Australian aid.<br />
For the rest of this century it will be given in the<br />
terms in letter and in spirit which I outlined<br />
years ago and 4 years ago in the statements<br />
which I have incorporated and in my frequent<br />
statements since made.<br />
But Australian aid is given to a free and<br />
independent nation-not to a claimant State of<br />
Australia. It is given to a nation which by its<br />
present leadership and all that we know of its<br />
proud, diverse people, is well able to work out its<br />
own destiny-in its own way. When that nation<br />
seeks assistance from abroad, Australia will<br />
surely be the first to answer that call-as we are<br />
pledged to do. But to confine the limits of assistance<br />
to that which Australia alone shall give<br />
would be to confine the limits of independence of<br />
Papua New Guinea itself.<br />
By these Bills we intend to give Papua New<br />
Guinea genuine independence-not a phoney<br />
independence. These Bills, I know, will pass<br />
unanimously in both our Houses. Let us be sure,<br />
however, exactly what we are trying to achievethe<br />
creation of a truly independent nation. Few<br />

This Bill is a machinery measure which is<br />
required to secure authority to borrow amounts<br />
for the financing of defence expenditure which<br />
will need to be charged to the Loan Fund during<br />
the financial year 1975.76. The Australian<br />
Government's financial transactions are<br />
recorded in 3 separate funds-the Consolidated<br />
Revenue Fund, the Loan Fund and the Trust<br />
Fund. Honourable members will, however, be<br />
aware from the summaries presented in Budget<br />
Paper No. 4-Estimates of Receipts and Summary<br />
ofEstimated Expenditure-that estimated<br />
expenditures for 1975-76 normally charged to<br />
the Consolidated Revenue Fund substantially<br />
exceed the estimated receipts of that Fund.<br />
The prospectve deficit in the Consolidated<br />
Revenue Fund, which is only part of the<br />
estimated overall deficit which I announced in<br />
my Budget speech, must be met in one way or<br />
another within the total of the financing arrangements<br />
for funding the overall deficit. In this kind<br />
of situation, successive governments have<br />
obtained authority to charge to the Loan Fund<br />
some expenditures which would normally be met<br />
from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. That is<br />
the purpose of this Bill which will authorise borrowings<br />
for defence purposes so that defence<br />
expenditures from appropriations approved by<br />
the Parliament can be charged to the Loan Fund<br />
rather than to the Consolidated Revenue Fund.<br />
The Bill does not authorise additional defence<br />
expenditures. It will simply allow us to reallocate<br />
from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to<br />
the Loan Fund part of the expenditures of the<br />
Department of Defence already authorised in<br />
the Supply Act ( No. 1) 1975-76 and which are<br />
subsequently authorised in the 1975-76 Appropriation<br />
Acts. When this Bill is enacted I shall<br />
move an amendment to Appropriation Bill ( No.<br />
1) 1975-76, to permit defence expenditure<br />
specified in that Bill to be charged to the Loan<br />
Fund. It is not possible at this stage of the financial<br />
year to be at all precise as to the amount of defence<br />
expenditure which will have to be charged<br />
to the Loan Fund. That amount, which can be<br />
expected to be sizable, will be a residual affected<br />
by all other transactions of the Consolidated<br />
Revenue Fund: t is for this reason that the Bill<br />
does not specify a fixed amount of borrowing.<br />
Instead, like similar Bills introduced in recent<br />
years both by this Government and by previous<br />
