<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>John Howard, welcome to the programme. We'll go to the guidelines</p>
<p> in a few minutes but if we could start with the preamble. You've</p>
<p> said that you detect that a lot of Australians across the political</p>
<p> and social spectrum would support a new preamble to the Constitution</p>
<p> recognising Aborigines as this country's original occupants.</p>
<p> Would you personally like to see that preamble?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>If I was satisfied that it had a good chance of winning support at</p>
<p> a referendum, yes.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>But you seem to acknowledging already that it does have that support.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, please, look, please, Kerry, can we sort of start the New Year</p>
<p> on a proper basis. Can I just answer the question. What I intend to</p>
<p> do is to talk to my colleagues in the Party Room about this. And can</p>
<p> I make the point that the preamble is not an after-thought or add-on,</p>
<p> it's something that came up at the Constitutional Convention.</p>
<p> And can I also say that we have no hope of getting a preamble accepted</p>
<p> either within the Government and elsewhere to go on the ballot paper</p>
<p> or by the Australian people if people keep upping the ante and saying</p>
<p> you've got to go further than simply recognising historical truth,</p>
<p> and that is the Aborigines were here first. I think if you start going</p>
<p> beyond that and you start introducing elements like particular rights</p>
<p> or particular disadvantage, you're talking here about putting</p>
<p> something in the Constitution, you're not talking about a day-to-day</p>
<p> debate. So, the answer is, I would like to see it. There are difficulties.</p>
<p> I want to talk to my colleagues about it. It's not about frustrating</p>
<p> the republic. I've been upfront in my opposition to a republic</p>
<p> and I've been twice elected as Prime Minister of this country</p>
<p> as an anti-republican. So I don't think my bona fides on that</p>
<p> issue can be dragged into the debate. I just simply believe that if</p>
<p> we could reach agreement as a nation on acknowledging that historical</p>
<p> truth, that would be a very important piece of symbolism for our Centenary</p>
<p> of Federation. Now, that's the beginning and the end of my thought</p>
<p> on that particular aspect.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>To be honest, I thought when you paused there that you'd actually</p>
<p> finished your answer but that's all right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, having exchanged apologies and friendly glances, go on with</p>
<p> the next question.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Well, given that your personal view is that you would like to see</p>
<p> the right kind of preamble, will you argue for that in your Party</p>
<p> Room?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, I've already gone public on this but what I do in the</p>
<p> Party Room is a matter between me and my colleagues and we have our</p>
<p> own way of determining this. Bear in mind that we have maturely allowed</p>
<p> a free vote on the republican issue. And some people would legitimately</p>
<p> say, well, if you're going to have a free vote on the republican</p>
<p> issue, because the preamble only came up because we're talking</p>
<p> about a republic, that free vote should extend to the preamble as</p>
<p> well. Although you could end up with a situation where just about</p>
<p> everybody supports it even though, as far as the understanding of</p>
<p> the party is concerned, people are open to...are allowed to vote</p>
<p> against it or to argue against it. But that's something that</p>
<p> I'll discuss with my colleagues. And I've put it on the</p>
<p> table. I've been open about it. I've explained my motivation.</p>
<p> It's not machiavellian, it's genuine. And in a couple of</p>
<p> weeks time I'll get my Liberal and National Party colleagues</p>
<p> together and we'll have a talk. I'll listen to what they've</p>
<p> got to say. And there may well be elements in that discussion that</p>
<p> put a different complexion on it but as of now I repeat what I said</p>
<p> yesterday, I think this nation would be ennobled if we could find</p>
<p> a way of acknowledging that simple historical truth in our foundation</p>
<p> document. Now, let's not be too cynical or too conspiratorial</p>
<p> about something like this. It is just a view I have.</p>
<p> O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>You're obviously concerned that if you broaden that preamble</p>
<p> too much that you will alienate a number of people, you've said</p>
<p> that. But then you would be equally concerned, wouldn't you,</p>
<p> that if it's not broad enough for indigenous Australians and</p>
<p> some other Australians that you're still going to have a rancorous</p>
<p> debate that becomes race-based?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I wish, with great respect, people, including journalists, wouldn't</p>
<p> drag race-based into the discussion of anything at all that sort of</p>
<p> talks about our indigenous people. I mean, what I'm trying to</p>
<p> do is as far away from a race-based debate as you could possibly get</p>
<p> yourself. Nothing in this area is going to satisfy everybody. There</p>
<p> will be some people on the Aboriginal side who will never be satisfied.</p>
<p> There are some people on the other side who are intensely suspicious</p>
<p> of even mentioning Aborigines. I think what I've got is a simple,</p>
<p> middle-ground proposition and that is we recognise something that</p>
<p> no reasonable man or woman could deny and that is that the first Australians</p>
<p> were the indigenous people. We don't start saying that we have</p>
<p> to entrench in the Constitution that they have ongoing rights of a</p>
<p> particular character. They have rights as Australians, no more no</p>
<p> less, but it is undeniably the truth that they were here before any</p>
<p> other people. Now, I don't think it's too hard to acknowledge</p>
<p> that. But once people start upping the ante and saying, we've</p>
<p> got to go further, we've got to have custodianship mentioned,</p>
<p> we've got to have ongoing rights, particular kinds mentioned,</p>
<p> you lose me, you lose middle Australia because they would not want</p>
<p> that and they would see that as pushing the envelope too far.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>On today's new ministerial guidelines. You lost a lot of ministers</p>
<p> in the last term under your previous guidelines. The new guidelines</p>
<p> are being interpreted already as having been softened. Does that indicate</p>
<p> that you were perhaps a little over zealous with the first set of</p>
<p> guidelines?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you can debate whether I was or I wasn't. Perhaps some</p>
<p> people would argue that I was. The changes, Kerry, in today's</p>
<p> document are not extensive. What I've basically done is said</p>
<p> that you can make a divestment of  it's not a breach of</p>
<p> the guidelines  you have a divestment of shares to independent</p>
<p> adult children. You can't divest to dependent children and hope</p>
<p> to escape the guidelines. And we've also allowed, in pursuance</p>
<p> of the study of blind trusts that I commissioned about two years ago,</p>
<p> we're going to allow Ministers to hand over control of their</p>
<p> share portfolios to nominees as an alternative to divestment. Now,</p>
<p> there are a few other relatively minor changes but the great bulk</p>
<p> of the previous guidelines remain. They're not really softened.</p>
<p> I think they're made more common sense, they're made more</p>
<p> realistic. You will never get a satisfactory set of guidelines and</p>
<p> I don't think you'll ever get rid of argument in this area</p>
<p> unless you have Parliament full of people who've never owned</p>
<p> an asset, who've never sought to be successful in business, who've</p>
<p> never shown any kind of independent entrepreneurial imagination. And</p>
<p> while ever you have people who are jealous of the success of others</p>
<p> you're going to have criticism that guidelines aren't tight</p>
<p> enough.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>But when you talk about Ministers passing shares on to the management</p>
<p> control of professional nominees, are they clearly defined as blind</p>
<p> trusts where the Minister, under instruction, is not told anything</p>
<p> about the future management of those shares?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But they're circumstances where he has nothing to do with it,</p>
<p> that's what I've got in mind.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>And no knowledge of.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Is that spelt out in the guidelines?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't have the document with me. And can I tell you I</p>
<p> settled the document about three months ago and it's because</p>
<p> Parliament's been in recess that I haven't tabled it. And</p>
<p> I'm not going to pledge myself to every last word of it without</p>
<p> getting it out and I don't carry it with me in my pocket. But</p>
<p> the intent is to create a situation where a person can hand over control</p>
<p> of his portfolio to somebody independently, he no longer exercises</p>
<p> control. And that is regarded as a reasonable alternative to a situation</p>
<p> where you have complete divestment.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>But do you accept that if the Minister is seen to be divested of any</p>
<p> possible personal interest or conflict of interest in shares that</p>
<p> might impact on his own portfolio responsibilities, that in handing</p>
<p> that over, not only does he hand over control of those shares, he</p>
<p> loses knowledge of any future movement of shares?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the circumstance that we have in mind is to put a person in</p>
<p> a situation where he can say, look, you run this, I have no control</p>
<p> over what you do and I can't influence your decisions.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Okay. On the GST and Peter Costello's admissions today that he</p>
<p> didn't get Treasury to model the employment effects of the new</p>
<p> tax  given the size of the unemployment problem in Australia</p>
<p> and its import to us all, why wouldn't you try to model the effects</p>
<p> of that in advance as you did other elements?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, for the reason the Treasurer explained. And this, Kerry, is</p>
<p> not a new admission. I mean, I think I said this and Peter said this</p>
<p> some months ago. We do still have a big unemployment problem. We've</p>
<p> both recognised that. And tax reform is part of solving that problem,</p>
<p> but it's only part of it. You need to have further movement in</p>
<p> freeing up the labour market. You need to do more about the interaction</p>
<p> of the welfare system and unemployment benefits, including things</p>
<p> like literacy and numeracy testing and instruction for people who</p>
<p> can't get jobs. You also need, of course, a high rate of economic</p>
<p> growth. Now, none of us have claimed that the only answer to unemployment</p>
<p> is the GST. What we do claim is that if you reform the tax system</p>
<p> so that the economy grows more strongly and we can trade more competitively,</p>
<p> that will make a contribution towards reducing unemployment because</p>
<p> it will add to economic activity and economic growth. And the way</p>
<p> in which tax reform impacts on employment is that it boosts economic</p>
<p> performance and economic performance in turn brings forth the demand</p>
<p> for more jobs.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>But as you also know, there have been other models that suggest that</p>
<p> at least in the short-term substantial jobs in particular sectors</p>
<p> can and possibly will be lost and even that there might be some loss</p>
<p> or marginal effect in the long-term. Peter Costello, late last year,</p>
<p> was quoting one outside report as saying there'd be 190,000 new</p>
<p> jobs but there was no Treasury modelling on that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we've never disguised that. What we've said is </p>
<p> and this analysis so far stands unrefuted  that the tax reform</p>
<p> will add to economic growth and economic growth will call forth demand</p>
<p> for a larger number of jobs. Now, you can't put a precise figure</p>
<p> on that and I didn't argue that during the election campaign,</p>
<p> in fact, I was attacked for not doing so. But I just say again, Kerry,</p>
<p> that we put all of this before the Australian people. We didn't</p>
<p> make false representations about the employment impacts during the</p>
<p> election campaign. We said it would be beneficial but we didn't</p>
<p> try and put a figure on it because, frankly, it is just not possible.</p>
<p> And you talk about modelling  the man that Labor's relying</p>
<p> on for a lot of their argument is Peter Dixon and he said that in</p>
<p> the short-term the plan would create 30,000 new jobs.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>In one circumstance but in another circumstance you might lose 100,000</p>
<p> jobs.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean...</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>But that is selective quoting on your part, isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, when you say...but you can equally say you've got selective</p>
<p> modelling. You can't take one segment of a tax plan as big as</p>
<p> this and hold that up and say, this outcome alone either damns or</p>
<p> endorses the taxation policy. You have to look at the whole piece.</p>
<p> And I would go back to what I said a moment ago that so far the evidence</p>
<p> before the Senate committee has not adequately refuted the broad economic</p>
<p> analysis contained in the document that I released before the election</p>
<p> last year.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Okay, if we can just turn our eyes offshore for a moment. East Timor</p>
<p> continues to make headlines, particularly with Indonesia's open</p>
<p> canvassing of possible  and I know it's only possible </p>
<p> independence. How relaxed would you be about an independent East Timor</p>
<p> with Indonesian sanction?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I would prefer an autonomous East Timor within Indonesia. And I would</p>
<p> hope that Indonesia and East Timorese leaders will continue to work</p>
<p> towards that. If that is unachievable then I would hope that the transition</p>
<p> to independence would be as orderly and as carefully planned and as</p>
<p> sympathetically undertaken by the Indonesians and others and we want</p>
<p> to help. This is very important to Australia. And if that is to be</p>
<p> the case, if the East Timorese people won't accept autonomy </p>
<p> and I don't regard the issue as completely beyond resolution</p>
<p> and I think there still should be attempts to achieve that </p>
<p> but if that comes about it would be not be as preferable to me as</p>
<p> East Timorese autonomy within Indonesia.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think there would be an inherent instability. There would</p>
<p> be an economic and strategic vulnerability. There would be the potential</p>
<p> for, I think, ongoing tension between Indonesia and the independent</p>
<p> East Timor of a type that mightn't exist if East Timor were an</p>
<p> autonomous part of Indonesia. There's no really happy outcome</p>
<p> of this. I mean, we played a major role in bringing about a change</p>
<p> of Indonesian policy because we believe that the previous position</p>
<p> was increasingly unsustainable. But it has always been our preference</p>
<p> to see East Timor autonomously part of Indonesia for the reasons that</p>
<p> I've just put forward but we recognise in the end that if that</p>
<p> is not what the people will accept, well, we don't support it</p>
<p> being imposed upon them, of course we don't. But that doesn't</p>
<p> make it illogical for us to hope that it might still be possible to</p>
<p> achieve the autonomous within Indonesia outcome.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Very briefly because we are out of time, would a UN security force,</p>
<p> given the instability in the lead up with negotiations and so on,</p>
<p> would a UN security force in the area be a good idea and would Australia</p>
<p> consider contributing to that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, hypothetical questions at the moment. I want to see continued</p>
<p> diplomatic effort invested not only by Australia but by others in</p>
<p> trying to persuade the Indonesians and the East Timorese to the virtues</p>
<p> of the preference I've expressed. And I think those avenues should</p>
<p> be exhausted genuinely, not only by us, by others, before we start</p>
<p> examining what are still hypothetical propositions.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, thanks for talking with us.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A pleasure.</p>
