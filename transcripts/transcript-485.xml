EXHIB'TION OF AUSTRALIAN iRT<br />
ADELAIDE ART GALLEJ D L. l " I ACH 12<br />
SPEECH BY THE P. RME IN Sp THE R N. . G MENZIE,<br />
Sir Lloyd, ladies and gentlemen:<br />
I must say at once that Sir Lloyd( Dumas) does me far too<br />
much honour, but I certainly plead guilty to the charge that I had<br />
a little to do with the origins of this collection. But before I<br />
tell you about that I would like to say that I think I am right<br />
am I not? in telling you that this is the first ixhibition to be<br />
put on in this new wing. This is a new and wonderful wing in a<br />
Gallery which has always been a distinguished gallery.<br />
I know that many of you when you look at politicians<br />
like me, and recall some of the things you've said ( Laughter) or<br />
that you've heard, and repeated ( Laughter) seldom give us any<br />
credit for having any of the more civilised characteristics. But<br />
I want to tell you that for years, whenever I came to Adelaide, I<br />
used to walk along the terrace, come in, sit down opposite John<br />
Longstaff's portrait of his wife the greatest portrait I venture<br />
to say that he ever painted remain there for a quarter of an<br />
hour and go out again if not wisor, better, and if not better,<br />
wiser than when I 7. en in.<br />
This Gallery has formed a real part of the life of<br />
Adelaide, intimately placed as it is here, with the city,<br />
presided over, as it is, by people of distinction in this State.<br />
Putting size on one side, I think this Gallery has a special<br />
quality and a special position in the life of this State.<br />
Of course, on this occasion, thoro is another reason why<br />
it is appropriate that this collection should be here. No man has<br />
had more to do with getting it together, arranging it, than Mr.<br />
Robert Campbell the distinguished director of this Gallery,<br />
( Applause) And getting this collection together, I want to warn<br />
you, has been almost as difficult as winning an election;<br />
( Laughter) and much more difficult than picking a Senate team,<br />
( Laughter) From the very beginning it was designed to be<br />
arranged historically beginning with some of the fine artists,<br />
the fine wolkers of the very early colonial history of the<br />
country, one or two of whom had fallen foul of the law, but<br />
continued to have their own qualities, running right up to the<br />
present time when you get into that period of semi-abstract<br />
painting which, I confess, as a miserablo philistine, I have never<br />
yet understood. ( Laughter) So the xhibition had to run on a<br />
line, a theme the historic development of Australian painting.<br />
Therefore as you go around you will see many pictures with which<br />
you are familiar; you will miss others' tht you might have<br />
expected to seo. It is one of my minor griovances tahat the<br />
modesty of Sir William Ashton, who is one of the selectors of this<br />
collection, has prohibited him from having one of his own<br />
distinguished landscapes. But still that is very charactoristic<br />
of him. The matter began in this fashion. I had some taks,<br />
initiated by Sir Colin Andurson, the well-known shipping man, who<br />
is the Chairman of the Tate Gallery in London, Now Colin is a<br />
great exponent of the very very modern; and I, as everybody knows,<br />
am a reactionary and a traditionalist. fnd so we very happily<br />
met we're old friends. But we were able to meet at opposite<br />
polls and gradually make an accommodation in the middle somewhere.<br />
He took this matter up; he thought that it would be a splendid<br />
thing to have at the Tate a really first-class collection of<br />
Australian work. He was prepared to concode to me my oldfashioned<br />
ideas in favour of impressionism; and I was able to<br />
concede to him his rather boyish outlook, as I thought, on other<br />
things. </p>
<p>I took it up with our own Art Advisory Board which, a<br />
little known body though it may be, has done splendid work for art<br />
and artists in Australia, That Board is presided over, of course,<br />
by '! ill Ashton and it contains other people of whom you know, like<br />
Mr. Dargie and Sir Daryl Lindsay, Mr. Pratt, Robert Campbell and,<br />
now IPm happy to say, the newly appointed member, a very very<br />
famous artist of a more recent vintage, Mr. Russell Drysdale,<br />
( Applause) That Board got to work. It laid its predatory hands<br />
on the collections of the Galleries; and if you've had anything<br />
to do w. ith Gallery Trustees, or Gallery Directors, you will know<br />
that to get anything out of them is as hard as getting avery<br />
very difficult cork out of a difficult bottle. ( Laughter) But ; we<br />
wore rather aided on this occasion, of course, by the fact that<br />
Robert Campbell, himself, was a Director and accustomed to holding<br />
trustees in the palm of his hand; while Daryl Lindsay has been a<br />
Director and is equally skilled in this technique. Behind it all<br />
there was the frowning look of the Prime Ministor who, at that<br />
time, had a majority of 32. ( Laughter)<br />
,. ell I want to say that we are deeply indebted to the<br />
Galleries for having made this collection possible. You won't<br />
have a chance this morning of seeing it as you would like to but<br />
even at a quick glance coming through it's plain to me that this<br />
is a most exciting collection of work and that it will make a<br />
tremendous impact upon viewers of all sorts of schools of thought<br />
. ihen it is put on at the Tate in London, And so it is a happy<br />
event. But in addition to rifling the Gt'lleries it was decided,<br />
quite early, after a little discussion, that private owners ought<br />
to be put under duress in order to produce some of their treasures.,<br />
I must say that although there was a divided opinion on this<br />
matter I, being accustomed to plundering people, was all in favour<br />
of plundering private owners. Therefore I want to say that we are<br />
very, very indebted to the owners of some of the pictures in this<br />
collection who have generously made them available. In that<br />
tribute of thanks, of course, I include myself. ( Laughter) I see<br />
one of mine not far away from me. One of mine, I say, in terms of<br />
ownership not in terms of croation.<br />
Now the only other thing that I want to say to you<br />
ladies and gentlemen, is that it has really been a colossally<br />
difficult task to make a choice, because to select is to reject;<br />
to offer a prfeorence to one painting of a great painter over<br />
another is pOrihaps to engage yourself in controversy about<br />
artistic judgment. Long ago in my sketchy studios of the Latin<br />
tongue I learned, and learned thor-) ughly that " do gustibus non est<br />
disputandun" so I'll provoke no arguments on these matters. All<br />
I know is that anybody in London of the hundreds of thousands who<br />
undoubtedly will come to see these pictures, anybody, looking at<br />
them, w'ill look beyond them to the fact that these are not<br />
definitive, they are a selection: they illustrate the kind of<br />
work that has been dcJne, and that exists. So to the perceptive<br />
eye behind every one of these masterly paintings will be a dozen<br />
oth. ers, a hundred oth. ers. They will regard-this as givin, then a<br />
sort of appetiser for a wider knowledge of the work that has gone<br />
on in Australia. And I venture to say without any classification<br />
at all as between one school of th-ught and another, that what ha<br />
been done in depictive art in Australia in our time, in the last<br />
years, in the time of this nation will si. ancd comp: -is,. n wit'<br />
what has been done in any . th; her country in the world, </p>
<p>People don't always realise that it takes a considerable<br />
force of genius to establish some new technique, or now approach<br />
in the world of art. I noticed in the programme that I was given<br />
that Louis Buvelot was classified as an impressionist. I have<br />
always thought of him as just a little bit before that time. But<br />
his paintings had this lovely, mollow, quiet charm that we all<br />
know. But when the other boys as I'll call them for this<br />
purpose like Roberts, that groat master, not as yet fully<br />
recognised, and Streeton and the others, came back full of the<br />
ideas of the impressionists people were, within a few years being<br />
made to understand that the great diaracteristic of the Australian<br />
scone, the Australian landscape, is not darkness, or solidity, or<br />
mass, but light, and the play of light, on whatever it falls.<br />
This revolutionised the painting that was going on in Australia.<br />
It is now of course permissible for people to say, "' Iell that's<br />
rather old-fashioned". But it never will be old-fashioned. Ideas<br />
will change, of course, but not to such a degree that these<br />
magnificent contributors to a new vision of Australia will over be<br />
regarded as so much folly. Of course not. They stand in their<br />
historic period. That is the beauty of this dxhibition: it puts<br />
everything into its historic period. So that yju may linger over<br />
the ones that you like best, or you may, with the eye of history,<br />
pass right around and see how something has developed in a new<br />
and, in some ways, harsh and hard country, and what beauty has<br />
been achieved in the process.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a singular feeling of<br />
privilege in declaring this Exhibition open. ( Applause) </p>
