    <content><![CDATA[<p>Subjects: Fiji; ACCC</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The National Security Committee of Cabinet decided on any further action in regards to the Fiji situation tonight?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We had a lengthy discussion about Fiji this afternoon and we maintain our deep concern about what has happened. We want return a democratic and constitutional rule in that country and that remains our very strong position. We are committed to the imposition of a range of sanctions and measures, they were outlined by the Foreign Minister two days ago and we will impose those sanctions at a time to be announced by the Government but we certainly do intend to go ahead with them. We can’t allow what appears to be an indefinite departure from constitutional and democratic rule to go unremarked and unrebuked because it does look unfortunately as though Fiji is going back to a racially based constitution or a racially based political system and that really isn’t acceptable and we can’t allow it to go unremarked.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How long will it take though until we do, Australia does impose sanctions against Fiji?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are not talking about a long period of time but the exact timing of these things is important and we just don’t intend to announce them just yet.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The Military Commander says that he is going to, he may be in power for three years. Is that acceptable to Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what Australia wants is a democratic constitutional system. We had a democratically elected Prime Minister. I saw him in Parliament House only a few weeks ago. He won fair and square and its quite wrong that he has been removed by the barrel of a gun. I can’t put it any more plainly than that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you confident that the ACCC will be able to pass on five hundred million dollars in petrol rebates to regional Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I am quite confident that the Government’s policy will pass it on and it’s a very good policy and I want to say to people in country Australia, we’re keeping our promises in relation to the GST. Not of itself causing any increase in the price of petrol thank you.</p>
