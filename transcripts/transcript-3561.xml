TRANSCRIPT PM'S NEWS CONFERENCE 20TH DECEMBER 1974.<br />
HIGH COMMISSIONER: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE PRIME<br />
MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA. ANY QUESTION?<br />
BOB HAUPT ( AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW): DID YOU RECEIVE ANY'<br />
FIRM UNDERTAKINGS FROM THE EUROPEANS ABOUT THE PURCHASE OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN URANIUM AND CAN YOU CONFIRM FIGURES WHICH HAVE APPEARED<br />
IN THE AUSTRALIAN PRESS ABOUT THE EUROPEAN DEMAND FOR AUSTRALIAN<br />
URANIUM?<br />
PM: I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE AUSTRALIAN PAPERS FOR THE<br />
LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. FIGURES WERE GIVEN TO US BY THE COMMISSION<br />
CONCERNING THE PROJECTED DEMAND FOR URANIUM IN VARIOUS FORMS FOR<br />
SEVERAL YEARS AHEAD. WE WERE ASKED TO KEEP THE FIGURES<br />
CONFIDENTIAL. Q: PRIME MINISTER COULD YOU POSSIBLY SAY WHETHER YOU DISCUSSED<br />
WITH MR WILSON THE RIGHTS ' OF THE STATES OF AUSTRALIA TO APPEAL<br />
TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL?<br />
PM: THE GENERAL QUESTION OF APPEALS FROM STATE COURTS IN<br />
AUSTRALIA TO THE PRIVY COUNCIL IS A MATTER OF CONCERN OF COURSE<br />
TO THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT BUT I DO NOT THINK I HAVE ANY MORE<br />
TO SAY ABOUT IT IN ADDITION TO WHAT I SAID YESTERDAY.<br />
MALCOLM STEWART ( MACQUARIE RADIO NETWORK): I GATHER YOU HAVE JUST<br />
HAD LUNCH WITH THE QUEEN. DO YOU ENVISAGE THAT THE STATUS OF THE<br />
QUEEN IN AUSTRALIA WILL CHANGE FURTHER DURING THE COURSE OF YOUR<br />
ADMINISTRATION.<br />

Q: IAN RICHARDSON ( RADIO 3DB) YESTERDAY YOU SEEMED TO BE MAKING<br />
SOME ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE RELATIONS BETWEEN BRITAIN AND AUSTRALIA<br />
AS YCU WERE AWARE THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF IRRITATION FROM<br />
THE BRITISH SIDE AT WHAT THEY SAW WAS YOUR ANTI-BRITISH ATTITUDE.<br />
YOU WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO PUT THIS RIGHT. ARE YOU TRYING<br />
TO FOLLOW THIS UP, ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE ANY OTHER STEPS<br />
TO IMPROVE RELATIONS BETWEEN BRITAIN AND AUSTRALIA?<br />
PM: THE RELATIONS BETWEEN BRITAIN AND AUSTRALIA HAVE ALWAYS<br />
BEEN GOOD AND CONTINUE TO BE GOOD. THERE IS NOTHING THAT MY<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS DONE WHICH WOULD LEND ANY BASIS WHATEVER TO<br />
ANY SUGGESTIONS THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN BRITAIN AND AUSTRALIA WERE<br />
IN ANY WAY DIMINISHED, . NONE WHATEVER.<br />
Q: YES THAT IS AS YOU SEE IT BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE OVER HERE<br />
ARE SAYING THAT YOU WERE THE FIRST ANTI-POM AUSTRALIAN<br />
PRIME MINISTER.<br />
PM: WELL LET'S BE A BIT PRECISE. LET'S SPECIFY WHAT I HAVE<br />
DONE WHICH COULD BE SAID TO BE IN ANY WAY ANTI-POM. DON'T<br />
TALK IN GENERALITIES, LET'S BE PRECISE. LET'S MEET ANY<br />
PRECISE OBJECTION OR ALLEGATION.<br />
Q: I AM NOT QUESTIONING WHETHER YOU ARE RIGHT OR WRONG BUT<br />
THE FACT IS A LOT OF PEOPLE DO THINK YOU ARE ANTI BRITISH.<br />
PM: WELL, THEY ARE WRONG. LET'S BE PRECISE THERE IS NO<br />
BASIS WHATEVER FOR THINKING THAT I AM ANTI-POM, TO USE YOUR<br />
WORDS. Q: JOHN DICKIE ( DAILY MAIL). SINCE YOUR ARRIVAL HERE YOU.<br />
HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR A STRENGTHENING OF THE COMMONWEALTH.<br />
DO YOU SEE A PARTICULAR ROLE FOR THE COMMONWEALTH IN RESOLVING<br />
THE RHODESIAN PROBLEM AND DO YOU SEE AN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
BEING PREPARED TO TAKE PART IN A CRASH EDUCATION PROGRAMME TO HELP<br />
THE AFRICANS AS PART OF A SETTLEMENT.<br />
PM: THE QUESTION OF RHODESIA WAS DISCUSSED AT THE LAST MEETING<br />
OF THE COMMONWEALTH HEADS OF GOVERNMENT IN OTTAWA LAST AUGUST<br />
AND AUSTRALIA THERE MADE IT PLAIN THAT IT WOULD PARTICIPATE VERY<br />
HAPPILY IN ANY COMMONWEALTH INITIATIVES ABOUT RHODESIA., AND NOTHING<br />
HAS BEEN DONE IN THE COMMONWEALTH CONTEXT SINCE THEN.<br />
Q: DID YOU GET ANY ASSURANCE FROM MR WILSON ABOUT DIEGO GARCIA,<br />
AND COULD YOU TELL US WHAT VIEWS WERE EXCHANGED ON THE<br />
SUBJECT. 3/ I' </p>

3 O. LH22933 W<br />
PM: MR WILSON AND I DISCUSSED FAIRLY BRIEFLY THE GENERAL<br />
QUESTION OF BRITAIN'S INTEREST IN THE INDIAN OCEAN AND<br />
SOUTH-EAST ASIA. MR WILSON ASSURED ME AS I BELIEVE HE HAD<br />
ASSURED THE HOUSE OF COMMONS THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT<br />
VERY MUCH SUPPORTS THE ATTITUDE OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
IN CALLING ON THE TWO SUPER POWERS THE UNITED STATES AND<br />
THE SOVIET UNION TO AVOID ANY ESCALATION OF THEIR FORCES.<br />
ANY CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THEM IN THE INDIAN OCEAN.<br />
I HAVE OF COURSE READ THIS IN ACCOUNTS OF WHAT MR. WILSON<br />
HAD SAID IN THE COMMONS. I WAS NATURALLY HAPPY TO<br />
HAVE IT RAISED BY HIM IN A STRONG CORDIAL TERMS FACE TO<br />
FACE THIS MORNING.<br />
DO YOU STILL MAINTAIN OUTRIGHT OPPOSITION TO AN<br />
AMERICAN BASE ON DIEGO GARCIA.<br />
PM: I DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS ANY COUNTRY AROUND THE INDIAN<br />
OCEAN WHICH WISHES TO HAVE AN INCREASE IN THE<br />
INSTALLATIONS ON DIEGO GARCIA. I HAVE SAID THAT BEFORE I<br />
HAVE NO REASON TO CHANGE THE VIEW.<br />
INSTALLATIONS OF THE AMERICANS IN DIEGO GARCIA<br />
CONSIDERING SAY THE HISTORY OF THE LAST WAR SUCH INSTALLATIONS<br />
NEARER AUSTRALIA WERE QUITE USEFUL.<br />
PM: THE SITUATION HAS CHANGED GREATLY SINCE THE LAST WAR.<br />
Q: THERE HAS BEEN A CURB IN MIGRATION TO AUSTRALIA IN THE LAST<br />
TWO OR THREE MONTHS. CAN YOU SEE THIS CURB BEING LIFTED<br />
WITH A GREATER NUMBER OF INCREASE IN MIGRANTS IN THE COMING<br />
YEAR 1975.<br />
PM: NO I DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS LIKELY TO BE AN INCREASE IN<br />
THE NUMBER OF MIGRANTS TO AUSTRALIA IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.<br />
THERE ARE TWO REASONS. THE FIRST IS AT A TIME OF UNEMPLOYMENT IN<br />
AUSTRALIA IT DOESN'T HELP TO HAVE A GREAT NUMBER OF MIGRANTS<br />
COMING TO AUSTRALIA. THE SECOND REASON IS THAT THE PRESSURE<br />
OF MIGRANTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES HAS DIMINISHED. THE<br />
REASONS WHICH PERSUADED A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN EARLIER<br />
YEARS TO COME TO AUSTRALIA NO LONGER PREVAILS WITH SUCH FORCE.<br />
THE MAIN NUMBER OF MIGRANTS COMING TO AUSTRALIA NOW ARE THOSE<br />
SPONSORED BY CLOSE RELATIVES. WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE THAT COME<br />
TO AUSTRALIA ON THE NOMINATION OF THEIR RELATIVES ARE MOST<br />
LIKELY TO BE HAPPY IN AUSTRALIA. THERE HAS BEEN A VERY GREAT<br />
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF MIGRANTS TO AUSTRALIA WHO. HAVE BECOME<br />
NATURALISEDo THERE IS9 I THINK, TWICE AS MANY PEOPLE BEING<br />
NATURALISED THIS YEAR AS TWO YEARS AGO IN AUSTRALIA. N<br />

INWARD CABLEGRAM 4 O. LH22933<br />
Q: YOU WERE SAYING IN BRUSSELS ON THE COMMON MARKET THAT YOU WANTED<br />
TO SEE THE END OF SHILLY SHALLYING ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WE STAY<br />
IN THE MARKET. SINCE YOUR TALKS WITH MR WILSON, DO YOU FORM<br />
THE IMPRESSION THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WANTS BRITAIN TO STAY<br />
IN THE MARKET.<br />
PM: THE CONVERSATIONS I HAD WITH MR WILSON OF COURSE WERE<br />
PRIVATE AND IT WOULD BE QUITE WRONG FOR ME TO GIVE ANY<br />
IMPRESSION OF WHAT WAS SAID BY EITHER OF US IN THOSE TALKS.<br />
IT'S NOT FOR ME REALLY TO EXPRESS A VIEW AS TO WHAT BRITAIN<br />
SHOULD DO ABOUT MEMBERSHIP OF THE EEC. IT IS RATHER FOR ME<br />
TO EXPRESS THE VIEW OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT. PREVIOUS<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS HAD UNDOUBTEDLY GIVEN THE IMPRESSION<br />
THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT BR'ITAIN TO JOIN THE COMMUNITY. THEY<br />
CRITICISED THE EFFORTS OF THE CONSERVATIVE AND LABOUR<br />
GOVERNMENTS IN BRITAIN TO JOIN THE COMMUNITY. THEY FREQUENTLY<br />
APPEARED INTENT ON FRUSTRATING BRITAIN'S ATTEMPTS TO JOIN THE<br />
COMMUNITY. THE PRESENT AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS DONE NOTHING TO<br />
FRUSTRATE THESE ATTEMPTS. IN OUR VIEW THERE IS NO ADVANTAGE<br />
WHATEVER TO AUSTRALIA IN BRITAIN LEAVING THE COMMUNITY.<br />
Q: ( RUSSELL SCHNEIDER, THE AUSTRALIAN): FOLLOWING YOUR DISCUSSIONS<br />
WITH HER MAJESTY AND MR WILSON, HAVE YOU ANY INTENTION OF<br />
INTRODUCING A PURELY AUSTRALIAN FORM OF HONOURS.<br />
PM: THIS IS A MATTER WE HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT FOR SOME<br />
TIME. ALL I CAN SAY IS THE GENERAL IDEA IS TO DO WHAT HAS BEEN<br />
DONE IN CANADA. I BELIEVE IT WOULD HELP PEOPLE IN BRITAIN TO<br />
UNDERSTAND THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT IN<br />
CONSTITUTIONAL TERMS IN GENERAL IF YOU WERE TO EQUATE OUR<br />
ASPIRATIONS WITH THE CANADIAN PRACTICE.<br />
Q: ( BILL NORMAN, SYDNEY MORNING HERALD): THERE IS A POSSIBILITY<br />
THAT GMH MAY SACK ANOTHER 5000 WORKERS. DID YOU GET ANY IDEAS FROM iZ<br />
MR WILSON WHEN YOU TALKED TO MR WILSON WHICH MIGHT BE APPLIED IN<br />
AUSTRAL IA.<br />
PM: WE DIDN'T DISCUSS THE MOTOR INDUSTRY. MY GENERAL IMPRESSION<br />
IS THE MOTOR INDUSTRY IS IN TROUBLE THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN<br />
WORLD. THE MONSTROUS AND INTOLERABLE SITUATION IN AUSTRALIA IS<br />
THAT GENERAL MOTORS SUBSIDIARY THERE HAS ATTEMPTED TO STAND<br />
OVER THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT. IT HAS AVOIDED USING THE MACHINERY<br />
AVAILABLE TO ANY AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY WHICH BELIEVES IT NEEDS<br />
ASSISTANCE FROM THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT. IT HAS PRESENTED<br />
DEMANDS THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT SHOULD ELIMINATE<br />
COMPETITION FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND SHOULD SUBSIDISE THOSE PRODUCTS.<br />
I NEVER THOUGHT EVEN GENERAL MOTORS WOULD HAVE THE GALL TO<br />
BE SO OVERT ABOUT IT. THESE UGLY AMERICAN COMPANIES. </p>

N WARD CABLEGRAM O. LH22933<br />
Q:... APPLICABLE TO AUSTRALIA.<br />
PM: I DIDN'I UNDERSTAND YOU TO ASK A QUESTION IN SUCH GENERAL<br />
TERMS. YOU MENfION GENERAL MOTORS AND I ANSWERED IN THAT CONTEXT.<br />
OF COURSE, MY COLLEAGUE AND OUR ADVISORS, AND I, SOUGHT AND GAINED<br />
A NUMBER OF IMPRESSIONS ON THE ECONOMIC SITUATION DURING OUR TALKS<br />
IN LONDON AND IN BRUSSELS. OF COURSE WE DID.<br />
Q: ON THE GENERAL MOTORS THING, PRIME MINISTER. AFTER THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED ITS MOTOR INDUSTRY POLICY.<br />
GENERAL MOTORS CAME OUT AND VIRTUALLY SUPPORTED THE GOVERNMENT<br />
AND THAT POLICY.<br />
PM: INDEED, THEY TOOK FULL PAGE ADVERTISEMENTS IN YOUR OWN VALUED<br />
JOURNALS. Q: COULD YOU TELL US WHAT DISCUSSIONS THEY HAD WITH THE<br />
GOVERNMENT IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET THE CHANGE TO THE MOTOR INDUSTRY<br />
POLICY BEFORE THEY ANNOUNCED THAT WORKERS WOULD BE SACKED.<br />
PM: NONE WHATEVERo THEY DELIVERED AN ULTIMATUM.<br />
Q: ( NOT HEARD)<br />
PM: BY THEIR SILENCE, YES. I ACCEPTED WHAT THEY SAID<br />
OPENLY. I DON'T ACCEPT THAT ANY COMPANY HOWEVER LARGE EVEN<br />
IF IT IS AN AMERICAN COMPANY IS ENTITLED TO STAND OVER<br />
THE GOVERNMENT OF A COUNTRY WHERE IT HAS OPERATED SO<br />
PROFITABLY FOR 20 YEARS AND MORE. GENERAL MOTORS' CONDUCT<br />
IN THIS CASE WAS ABOMINABLE. IT IS NOT THE FAULT OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IF GENERAL MOTORS IN AUSTRALIA CAN'T<br />
PRODUCE AN ACCEPTABLE VEHICLE. IT CAN'T FACE COMPETITION,<br />
IF IT SEEKS ILLEGAL ASSISTANCE, PROTECTION AND UNJUSTIFIED<br />
SUBSIDIES.<br />
Q: ( JOHN JACKSON, DAILY MIRROR). MAY I JUST CHANGE THE<br />
SUBJECT. COULD I ASK WHETHER THE DIFFICULT PROBLEM OF CRICKET<br />
WAS BROUGHT UP AT NO. 10 OR BUCKINGHAM PALACE.<br />
DID HER MAJESTY OR MR WILSON OFFER TO OPEN THE INNINGS AT<br />
MELBOURNE. PM: I CAN'T DESCRIBE ACTUALLY THE CONVERSATIONS THAT HER MAJESTY<br />
HAD, ANY MORE THAN I CAN THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE P. M. HOWEVER, AT<br />
THE RISK OF INDISCRETION I WOULD SAY THAT MRo WILSON CONSTANTLY<br />
REFERRED TO MATTERS IN CRICKETING TERMS YESTERDAY AFTERNOON, LAST<br />
NIGHT, THIS MORNING, AND I HAVE NO DOUBT TONIGHT AND TOMORROW NIGHT.<br />
AS I SAID YESTERDAY, WE ARE PREPARED TO FLY THE MCC FIRST ELEVEN<br />

Q: DID YOU DISCUSS WITH MR. WILSON YOUR PROPOSAL ON THE INDIAN<br />
OCEAN. AND IF SO WHAT HAS BEEN THE REACTION OF THE BRITISH<br />
GOVERNMENJT. YOU SAID THAT THERE MUST BE SOME UNDERSTANDING<br />
BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE GREAT POWERS ABOUT ARMS LIMITATION IN THE<br />
INDIAN OCEAN. DID YOU DISCUSS THIS MATTER WITH MR. WILSON. WHAT<br />
HAS BEEN HIS REACTION.<br />
PM: I HAVE ALREADY STATED ALL I THINK I SHOULD SAY ABOUT WHAT<br />
MR. WILSON HAD SAID ABOUT THE INDIAN OCEAN. I OBVIOUSLY DON'T MIND<br />
IF YOU ASK ME MY ATTITUDE TOWARD IT, BUT REALLY I CAN'T GO INTO<br />
DETAILS ABOUT WHAT MR. WILSON AND I HAVE SAID IN OUR CONFIDENTIAL<br />
TALKS. MR. WILSON HAS STATED SOME THINGS PUBLICLY. HE REPEATED.<br />
THEM TO ME AND I AM HAPP. Y TO STATE THEM HERE.<br />
Q: DOES THE FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC STILL WORRY THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT. AND IF THEY EVER DECIDED TO RESUME IT WOULD<br />
YOU EXPECT A MORE SYMPATHETIC, RATHER MORE SYMPATHY, FROM A BRITISH<br />
LABOUR GOVERNMENT THAN YOU GOT FROM A PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION.-<br />
PM: A COMPLETELY SPECULATIVE QUESTION. I WON'T ANSWER IT,<br />
Q: WHAT IS YOUR GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE ON SALES OF SUGAR.<br />
PM: WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO SELL SUGAR OR ANY OF OUR OTHER PRIMARY<br />
PRODUCTS, OR MINERAL PRODUCTS OVERSEAS. WE HAVE IN MANY<br />
CASES SUPPLIES SURPLUS TO OUR REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVEN'T GOT SUPPLIES<br />
OF SUGAR SURPLUS TO OUR OWN REQUIREMENTS, OR OUR OWN COMMITMENTS THIS<br />
YEAR. THE CROP IS FULLY COMMITTED. WE ARE HAPPY IN RESPECT<br />
OF SUGAR, OTHER PRIMARY OR MINERAL PRODUCTS, TO INCREASE OUR<br />
PRODUCTION TO MEET DEMANDS OR SALES FROM OVERSEAS PURCHASERS<br />
FROM OVERSEAS.* WE WISH TO HAVE THESE ARRANGEMENTS MADE FOR -A TERM<br />
OF YEARS. IN RESPECT OF SUGAR WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SEVERAL<br />
AGREEMENTS FOR FIVE YEAR TERMS. THERE IS SOME SUGGESTION IN THE<br />
NEWSPAPERS THAT WE HAVE JUST ENTERED INTO SUCH AN AGREEMENT WITH<br />
JAPAN. WE HAVE ALREADY DONE SO WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. THE ONLY<br />
COUNTRY WITH WHICH WE HAVE. ENTERED INTO A SHORTER AGREEMENT IS THE<br />
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, AND THAT IS FOR THREE YEARS. QUITE<br />
OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO ENTER INTO COMMITMENTS TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS<br />
OVER A TERM OF YEARS BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT DOESN'T SUIT US IT<br />
DOESN'T PAY US TO INCREASE OUR INVESTMENTS IN PRODUCING SURPLUSES<br />
TO OUR REQUIREMENTS IF WE CAN'T RECOVER THOSE INVESTMENTS. WE<br />
CLEARLY ARE EXPECTING ANY SALES OF SUGAR OR SUCH PRIMARY<br />
PRODUCTS IN WESTERN EUROPE TO BE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE EEC*<br />
WE ARE PROBABLY THE MOST EFFICIENT PRODUCERS OF SUGAR IN THE<br />
WORLD. WE EXPORT MORE THAN ANY COUNTRY OTHER THAN CU5A. YOU<br />
MIGHT NOT REALISE IN BRITAIN THAT AUSTRALIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST<br />
TROPICAL COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. BRAZIL IS THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE<br />
WORLD WHICH HAS A LARGER LAND SPACE IN THE TROPICS. 0.. 7/ I </p>

INWARD CABLEGRAM 7 O. LH22933<br />
Q: WHAT IS THE STATE OF PLAY ON YOUR PRESENT NEGOTIATIONS ON SALES<br />
OF SUGAR TO THE COMMUNITY.<br />
PM: THERE AREN'T ANY.<br />
Q: WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, THEN, THIS QUESTION OF SUGAR<br />
SUPPLIES WAS IT RAISED BY EITHER SIDE.<br />
PM: IT HAS BEEN RAISED IN GENERAL TERMS WITH SOME OF OUR ADVISERS<br />
BOTH HERE AND IN BRUSSELS, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THERE ARE ANY<br />
PRECISE PROPOSALS. THE HEAD OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEPARTMENT OF OVERSEAS<br />
TRADE IS WITH ME. VERY OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THE<br />
OPPORTUNITIES TO SELL SUGAR AND OTHER PRODUCTS WHILE WE HAVE<br />
BEEN IN BRUSSELS AND LONDON.<br />
Q: ( HIGHFIELD9 ABC) HAVE YOU HAD DISCUSSIONS ON THE CONTINUING FULL<br />
DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATION OF THE STATE'S AGENTS-GEN4ERAL IN LONDON.<br />
PM: NONE WHATEVER. IT WAS NEVER PROPOSED TO. I NOTICED THAT EVEN<br />
THE TIMES ITSELF SUGGESTED IN THEIR EDITORIAL YESTERDAY THAT MR.<br />
WILSON AND I MIGHT BE DISCUSSING THE POSITION OF THE AGENTS-GENERAL.<br />
OF THE AUSTRALIAN STATES. WE HAVE NEVER DISCUSSED IT, WE HAVE NEVER<br />
CORRESPONDED ABOUT IT. THIS WAS SUGGESTED IN AUSTRALIA ABOUT EIGHT<br />
DAYS AGO. I ISSUED A DENIAL. I AM SURPRISED THAT THE TIMES ITSELF<br />
SHOULD FALL INTO THIS ERROR.<br />
Q: THERE HAS BEEN WORD THAT YOU RAISED CERTAIN CONSTITUTIONAL<br />
MATTERS NOW YOU HAVE BEEN ASKED ABOUT THIS IN A ROUND-ABOUT WAY<br />
ALREADY BUT PERHAPS YOU COULD TELL US SOMETHING OF WHAT THESE<br />
MATTERS ARE, . TO AVOID THE TIMES ITSELF, OR OTHER' PEOPLE FROM GETTING<br />
IT WRONG.<br />
PM: YOU ASK A QUESTION WHAT I THINK ABOUT IT. I D-ID SAY SOMETHING<br />
AT THE MANSION HOUSE AT THE LUNCH YESTERDAY. SO I AM QUITE HAPPY<br />
TO MAKE PRONOUNCEMENTS ON THIS SUBJECT. BUT ASK ME MY VIEWS. DON'T<br />
ASK ME WHAT I HAVE SAID IN CONFIDENTIAL DISCUSSIONS WITH MY<br />
COUNTERPART OR MY MONARCH.<br />
Q: INDISTINCT.<br />
PM: I WAS ASKED IF I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ANY CHANGE. AND I SAID<br />
NO.<br />
Q: DO YOU THINK THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT WILL LEGISLATE TO ABOLISH<br />
APPEALS TO THE PRIVY COUNCIL FROM STATE SUPREME COURTS.<br />
PM: I WON'T SPEAK ON BE-HALF* OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT. 8/ </p>

Q: CAN I ASK YOU WHAT YOUR OWN VIEWS ARE THEN, ABOUT<br />
CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES THAT ARE NECESSARY, WITH RELATION TO THE<br />
POSITION OF THE QUEEN, THE TITLE ROYAL.<br />
PM: THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST ONE WAS NONE.<br />
Q: TO THE USE OF THE TITLE ROYAL TO VARIOUS AUSTRALIAN BODIES<br />
LIKE THE RAAF AND SO ON.<br />
PM: I HAVE NO VIEW ON IT AT ALL. WHY DO YOU ASK THIS.<br />
Q: IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT POSSIBLY CHANGES ARE ON THE WAY.<br />
PM: WELL THERE ARE NOTL<br />
Q. AND YOU ARE NOT CONTEMPLATING ANY.<br />
PM: NO, IT HAS NEVER BEEN SUGGESTED. WHY DO YOU.. I PRESUME YOU<br />
ARE ASKING THIS QUESTION ON THE BASIS OF SOME STORY SOMEWHERE.<br />
I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY SUCH STORY. IT'S THE FIRST TIME THE SUGGESTION<br />
HAS EVER BEEN MADE TO ME. WE HAVE A ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY AND A<br />
ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE. NOBODY HAS SUGGESTED CHANGING THE TITLE.<br />
Q: MAY I SAY THIS STEMS FROM A CABLE WHICH HAS COME FROM MELBOURNE<br />
FROM A BRIGADIER EASON, AND A BRIGADIER SIR WILLIAM HALL, WHICH<br />
READS, ACCORDING TO OUR CORRESPONDENT IN MELBOURNE: " YOUR MAJESTY<br />
THE FOLLOWING CABLEGRAMS HAVE BEEN SENT TO YOUR PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR WILSON: WE WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT ANY CHANGES IN THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH CONSTITUTION, IN OUR RELATIONS WITH THE MONARCH, QUEEN<br />
ELIZABETH II, SHOULD BE MADE IN AUSTRALIA BY AUSTRALIANS AND THE<br />
GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM REFRAIN FROM INTERFERENCE. MR.<br />
WHITLAM HAS NEVER SPOKEN FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF AUSTRALIANS ON<br />
THIS MATTER". AND IT WAS THEN MENTIONED ABOUT THE ROYAL BEING TAKEN<br />
AWAY FROM ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE.<br />
PM: THIS IS SHEAR SPECULATION. THESE OLD BRIGADIERS NEVER DIE.<br />
NO, REALLY IT'S THE'FIRST SUGGESTION OF THIS KIND THAT I HAVE EVER<br />
HEARD. Q: ( PATRICK KEATLEY, THE GUARDIAN) I WONDER IF I COULD ASK A<br />
SUPPLEMENTARY TO WHAT YOU RAISED AT THE MANSION HOUSE ON THIS<br />
CONSTITUTIONAL POINT WHERE YOU REFERRED TO THE FACT THAT IT SHOULD<br />
BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS I AM PARAPHRASING TO THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION WITHIN AUSTRALIA. I HOPE I AM PUTTING THAT<br />
CORRECTLY. I WONDERED IF YOU COULD FILL THAT OUT A BIT AND EXPLAIN<br />
TO US WHAT THE STEPS WOULD BE, OR WHAT THE SCOPE IS THAT YOU COULD<br />
ACHIEVE WITHOUT HAVING TO REFER TO BRITAIN. 9/ s \ vS N'<br />

INWARD CABLEGRAM 9 O. LH22933<br />
I THINK THERE WERE TWO PARTICULAR MATTERS I MENTIONED AT THE<br />
IANSION HOUSE YESTERDAY. ONE WAS THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNORS OF<br />
fHE AUSTRALIAN STATES RECEIVE COMMISSION NOT FROM THE QUEEN OF<br />
AUSTRALIA, BUT FROM THE QUEEN OF THE U. K. THE COMMISSIONS ARE<br />
, OUNTERSIGNED NOT BY ANY AUSTRALIAN MINISTER, BUT BY THE BRITISH.<br />
, INISTER FOR FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS. I ALSO MENTIONED<br />
: HAT APPEALS COULD COME FROM THE AUSTRALIAN STATE COURTS IN RESPECT<br />
FO STATE LAWS DIRECTLY TO THE BRITISH PRIVY COUNCIL. NOW IN<br />
? ESPECT TO THOSE TWO MATTERS I EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT IT WOULD<br />
3E MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THE GOVERNORS OF THE AUSTRALIAN STATES TO<br />
3E COMMISSIONED BY THE QUEEN OF AUSTRALIA. I ALSO EXPRESSED THE<br />
JIEW THAT APPEALS FROM ALL AUSTRALIAN COURTS SHOULD END WITH THE<br />
UIGH COURT OF AUSTRALIA. I WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT ANY LEGAL DISPUTES<br />
3ETWEEN, SAY THE FEDERAL AND THE STATE GOVERNMENTS OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
ENDS WITH THE HIGH COURT OF AUSTRALIA. ALSO ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN<br />
' AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS CONCERNING THE OPERATION OF AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL<br />
,-AWS END. WITH THE HIGH COURT OF AUSTRALIA. THERE IS, HOWEVER,<br />
rHIS SINGLE ANOMOLY. THAT APPEALS FROM STATE COURTS UNDER STATE<br />
-AW. S CAN GO TO THE BRITISH PRIVY COUNCIL. IT SEEMS IN THESE DAYS<br />
U. ITE ANOMOLOUS AND ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD ALWAYS HAVE<br />
3EEN OBJECTIONABLE FOR LITIGATION TO TAKE PLACE BETWEEN CITIZENS<br />
) F ANY COUNTRY BEFORE THE COURTS OF ANOTHER COUNTRY, SITTING IN<br />
\ NOTHER COUNTRY, AND COMPOSED OF JUDGES APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNMENT<br />
' F,:.. THAT-OTHER COUNTRY. IT IS NO PART, SURELY, OF THE ENGLISH: LAW<br />
N ENGLAND, OR IN ANY ENGLISH. SETTLEMENT, SUCH AS AUSTRALIA, THAT<br />
HERE SHOULD BE LITIGATION IN ANOTHER COUNTRY EVEN IF IT IS THE<br />
! OTHER COUNTRY. IT IS HERE, AGAIN SURELY, THE SITUATION SHOULD BE<br />
, S IN CANADA.<br />
ON THAT POINT, AS INDEED YOU MENTIONED CANADA. AND AS YOU KNOW<br />
-HE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT HAD THE DILEMMA OF WHETHER OR NOT TO HAVE<br />
' HE BNA ACT REVISED IN LONDON. WOULD YOU SAY THEN THE PARALLEL<br />
HEN OBTAINS THAT AUSTRALIA DOES NOT NEED TO HAVE HER ORIGINAL ACT<br />
F INDEPENDENCE OF THE WESTMINISTER PARLIAMENT<br />
MENDED FOR AUSTRALIAN PURPOSES.<br />
M: OH, THE BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT IS MORE ARCHAIC THAN THE! i<br />
' OMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA CONSTITUTIONAL ACT. IT IS, AS YOU KNOW,<br />
4 YEARS OLDER. THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTIONAL WOULD BE A MORE<br />
: ONTEMPORARY DOCUMENT IF IT HAD BEEN PASSED AFTER THE PARLIAMENT ACT<br />
; ERE, INSTEAD OF, YOU KNOW, IF IT HAD BEEN PASSED UNDER GEORGE V,.<br />
NSTEAD OF UNDER VICTORIA. BUT THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION CAN<br />
E CHANGED WITHIN AUSTRALIA. THE CANADIAN CONSTITUTION REQUIRES<br />
MENDMENT BY THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT. SO IN THAT RESPECT AUSTRALIA<br />
S MORE FORTUNATELY SITUATED THAN CANADA. THERE HAS BEEN SOME<br />
TTEMPT, LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR, TO BYPASS THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
ONSTITUTION OF 1900 BY RELYING ON A BRITISH ACT OF 18533. I01 </p>
