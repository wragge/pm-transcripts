FCR PRESS: P. M. No. 94/ I968<br />
NEW SOUTH WALES BUSHFHIES<br />
Statement _ by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gortoin<br />
This afternoon the Premier of New South Wales<br />
advised me that his Government had contributed a further $ 50, 000 to the<br />
joint Commonwealth/ State scheme for the relief of personal harc~ hp and<br />
distress in the New Scuth Wales bushfiresi In accordance with what I said<br />
in the House yesterday, the Commonwealth readily agreed it would itself<br />
match this contribution with an additional $ 50, 000 to the relief scheme.<br />
As is usual in disasters of this nature, the armed<br />
services have assisted with all means at their disposal to alleviate the<br />
effects of the fires. For more than the last week troops, at the request<br />
of the Bushf ire Control Organisation, have maintained a permanent roundthe<br />
clock watch in the threatened areas. When the crisis struck yesterday,<br />
the Air Force made 350 men available to the bushfire control and police<br />
in the Glenbrook area. These ground parties were backed up with water<br />
tankers, fire beaters and knapsack spray equipment. The Air Force<br />
received no requests for aircraft to assist but it has had a C130 aircraft<br />
patrolling the Newcastle and Sydney districts on fire spotting duties. This<br />
aircraft fed back to ground control the intelligence about the fires gained<br />
from the air. Mr Willis, the Chief Secretary of New South Wales,<br />
was in touch with me today after an inspection of the disaster area. He<br />
asked whether the Atmy could provide six fire tankers and crews to be<br />
held at standby alert, two bulldozers with crews, a mobile canteen, a<br />
generating set arnd two arc lights for night work. I readily agreed with<br />
this request and the equipment and personnel are now on their way to the<br />
area. CA NBERRA<br />
