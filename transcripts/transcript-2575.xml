FOR PRE~ SS; P. M. No 41/ 1972*'<br />
CONS IDERATrION OF AUSTRALIAN WOOL INDUSTRY C0ONFERE~ NCE PROPOSALS<br />
Statement by the Prime minister, The Rt THon. William<br />
I. ZC., hon, C. H. M. P.<br />
The Government toaay had a long and detailed discussion<br />
of the wide range of issues raised by the Australian Wool Indu~ stry<br />
Conference in its re * port on proposed marketing change in the<br />
Australian wool induStry.<br />
It had before it a nreliminar-. 1 report of the : Randall<br />
Committee. This Committee, con~ stituted of senior representatives<br />
from the Departments of the Prime Minister, Trade and Industry,<br />
Treasury and Primary Industry, under the chairmanship of the former<br />
Secretary to the Treasury, Sir Richard Randall, was commissioned to<br />
undertake comprehensive examination of thc-Wool Industry in all its<br />
aspects. In view of the expected receipt of the final report of<br />
that Committee within two weeks, it was decided that no decision<br />
should be taken to introduce legislative changes for the 1972/ 73<br />
Wool Selling Season before the final report of the Committee had<br />
been considered. While no decision has yet been taken on the A. W. I. C.<br />
proposals, the Government will be considering the Randall Committee<br />
report before the commencement of the next wool sel~ ling scason and<br />
advising the industry of its decision.<br />
This will mean the continuation of PAP for the next pool<br />
period commencing on 1st July next.<br />
The decision will of course in no way affect the<br />
maintenance of support given to the industry at 79.37c per kg.<br />
average ( 36c per lb) during the present wool selling season.<br />
CANBERRA, 2 May, 1972. </p>
