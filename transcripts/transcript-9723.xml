SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
LAUNCH OF THE BOOK THE BATTLE OF LEYTE GULF<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL<br />
CANBERRA, TUESDAY 22 AUGUST 1995<br />
It is a great privilege to be able to co-launch this book with President Ramos here in<br />
Canberra.<br />
Last week, hundreds of thousands of Australians participated in very moving<br />
ceremonies throughout the country to commemorate the end of the war in the Pacific<br />
fifty years ago. For many young people who took part or watched, these events gave<br />
them a chance to thank the generation of Australians who achieved the victory and to<br />
reflect on its meaning for our country now.<br />
The battle of Leyte Gulf was one of the critical events leading to the victory we<br />
celebrated last week, and Australia was proud to have played its part in it.<br />
The battle saw the largest Royal Australian Navy involvement in a single campaign<br />
during the war. RAAF Wireless Units also played an important part.<br />
Before the battle, thirteen Australian ships operating as part of the US seventh fleet,<br />
had been involved in a number of fierce battles for control of the sea lanes around the<br />
Philippines. Then, on 20 October 1944, seven of them participated in the allied operations to<br />
recapture Leyte Gulf and Panoan. The greatest amphibious force ever assembled in<br />
the Pacific and second only to the D Day landings in Europe landed four divisions<br />
of the US 6th army and began the liberation of the Philippines.<br />
On the day after the landings, which were accomplished without loss of life, Japanese<br />
kamikaze bombers attacked the allied fleet, including HM4AS Australia on which<br />
thirty crew members, including the ship's captain, were killed.<br />
Australia has remembered the Australian Task Force Commnander at Leyte,<br />
Cormnodore Collins, in the name given to our country's new class of submarines. </p>
<p>The Battle of Leyte Gulf reunited the allies with the courageous Philippines resistance<br />
forces, who had fought so bravely for three years against the occupying Japanese.<br />
Those many thousands of Filipinos who fought and died for our common cause<br />
deserve the thanks of all Australians.<br />
I hope this book will be more than a fine commemoration for those who were involved<br />
in the campaign, or who have family who were.<br />
I hope it will remind a new generation of Australians and Filipinos that our countries<br />
have common security interests, that these interests have been tested in the past and<br />
that we can best preserve them today by working together to build a strong defence<br />
partnership ourselves, and a regional environment which preserves the security of all<br />
the countries in it.<br />
For this reason, I was very pleased that we were able to witness today the signing of a<br />
Memorandum of Understanding on defence co-operation which will provide a<br />
forward-looking framework for developing the defence ties between us.<br />
I congratulate the Department of Defence and the staff of the Australian Defence<br />
Force Journal on this excellent publication. </p>
