TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH THE TREASURER,<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 18 MAY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: We've just completed the Premiers' Conference and Loan<br />
Council meeting and very significant decisions have been<br />
made there.<br />
In essence what has happened is that we have taken $ 2.7<br />
billion off the public sector demand on the community<br />
savings. That's made up by $ 1.15 billion off the borrowing<br />
limits of the Commonwealth's own authorities, $ 1 billion off<br />
the State's globals in respect of their authorities and $ 550<br />
million off the financial grants to the States. That means<br />
$ 2.7 billion reduced demand by the public sector when taken<br />
into account with the $ 360 million savings in the April<br />
Statement. That comes to over $ 3 billion, which is<br />
equivalent to one percent of the Gross Domestic Product, so<br />
it can be seen that the Governments of Australia have<br />
responded to the economic demands of the situation<br />
confronting this country.<br />
In opening the Conference I said, and of course Paul<br />
supplemented what I was saying in detail, that the problem<br />
confronting the Australian economy is that we have too high<br />
a level of demand.<br />
In the last year, eight percent increase in demand and only<br />
a four percent increase in our output which meant, in fact,<br />
that something like half of the increase in demand had to be<br />
met by imports. This is not situation that as a country we<br />
can continue to tolerate and the exercise today therefore<br />
was simply to ensure that all levels of Government made an<br />
appropriate contribution to the reduction in demand in the<br />
Australian economy.<br />
I would like to pay tribute to the work that's been done by<br />
the Treasurer and our own people in preparing us for this<br />
situation, but I'd also pay tribute to the positive<br />
cooperation of the States. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM ( cont): I believe there's been a certain amount of sound<br />
and fury that they've found it politically necessary to make<br />
in talking to the media. That's part of the game, that's<br />
part of life. But we can talk about what happened in there<br />
and I think we can say, Paul, it was one of the most docile<br />
and, in a sense, most cooperative meetings that we've had.<br />
This was our seventh one<br />
KEATING: The most.<br />
PM: And it was the most docile and cooperative and what<br />
that reflected was the fundamental acceptance by the<br />
Premiers. Indeed they indicated this. There was a<br />
fundamental acceptance of the economic analysis that I and<br />
the Treasurer had put to them, an acceptance of the need for<br />
responsive and responsible Government reaction.<br />
In essence the decisions that I've referred to reflect that<br />
agreement and to that extent, as I say, despite the<br />
necessary sound and fury that they feel it necessary to go<br />
on with in talking to the media, we thank them for their<br />
cooperation. Paul, do you want to add anything?<br />
KEATING: Well, just to perhaps recap the point the Prime<br />
Minister made that when we announced the April wage/ tax<br />
statement we said we'd be looking at a zero PSBR for next<br />
year, at least a zero. Well, we're probably now looking at<br />
the better part of one percent surplus on the PSBR, which<br />
just means the public sector's continuing to push the pace<br />
of change in our financial structure.<br />
That would simply mean that whatever savings we made today<br />
are ultimately savings off the current account deficit. If<br />
we are not making these bids on the savings pool, the<br />
savings, Australians would be making that much less of a bid<br />
upon overseas savings and hence the current account.<br />
PM: Perhaps one other point which ought to made is that in<br />
the area of housing, as a result of the decisions that we<br />
had made and with which the Premiers agreed, there will be<br />
an additional amount of funds for public housing. We agreed<br />
that some $ 311 million have been converted from Loan Council<br />
borrowing to grants to be made available under the<br />
Commonwealth State Housing Agreement.<br />
That will mean, as a result of their cooperation with our<br />
initiative, that there will be further funds therefore made<br />
available for public housing.<br />
KEATING: And just to add to that, it will be spent on<br />
public housing.<br />
PM: Yes. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
KEATING: That is by taking away from the nominating<br />
arrangements where they were not particularly spent on<br />
public housing and put in under the CSHA, they will be spent<br />
on public housing<br />
PM: They must be.<br />
KEATING: And then yesterday, of course, we announced this<br />
change in relation to the rental trusts which will give us<br />
about another two and a half thousand units a year, or about<br />
twelve and a half thousand over five years. So there's a<br />
substantial boost in there for housing.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Premier Ahern indicated during the<br />
conference today that he was going to refuse to sign the<br />
Loan Council Agreement, which included those about $ 311<br />
million package. Did he back down or have you come to some<br />
sort of deal?<br />
PM: It's not a question of backing down on these things. A<br />
lot of noises are made in the lead-up to conferences and<br />
sometimes during them. It's what happens at the end that<br />
matters. So I don't want to talk about backing down, I mean<br />
this JOURNALIST: So there's no deal, he's just agreed to go<br />
along with the proposal by the Commonwealth?<br />
PM: No deals.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Ahern has indicated that you've agreed to<br />
consider some further borrowings under the economic<br />
infrastructure PM: Well see, what was being put to us was that they were<br />
being hardly done by and we were able to point to the fact,<br />
as it was conveyed to us by the officials, that they seemed<br />
not to have borrowed up to the limits that were available to<br />
them last year. That position was not consistent with cries<br />
of pain. Now he has a view, which he put to us, that the<br />
view put to us by our officials was not an accurate<br />
representation of the position. I did make the point to him<br />
that it is rather difficult if you've been refusing, as the<br />
State of Queensland has for a year, to provide the<br />
information. And we get given the information at midnight<br />
last night, which is when we get it, for us to be taking<br />
very seriously their cries, but being the reasonable people<br />
that we both are we said ' well, OK, if there is some dispute<br />
between you and your officials and ours, we agree to discuss<br />
the matter' and if, out of those discussions, there were<br />
some substance in what he was saying we agreed that we would<br />
look at it. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Keating, you said today a number of times<br />
that the States should reduce their investment. Are you<br />
saying that particularly New South wales and the Greiner<br />
Government there should try and fix up very badly in<br />
need of repair road system and hospitals and schools and<br />
things?<br />
KEATING: No just that we should be reducing public<br />
investment overall and if the Greiner Government wishes to<br />
increase road funding or deal with pollution or whatever, it<br />
does that at the expense of something else.<br />
PM: Just as we've had to do.<br />
KEATING: Just as we've had to do.<br />
PM: We've had to get our priorities in order and we've, as<br />
I said there in the opening, if you go back to the period<br />
which is relevant we've knocked off the order of<br />
billion. That's each year now and compared to our earlier<br />
outlays. Now that's required a series of very, very<br />
difficult decisions. I mean we sit for hundreds of hours in<br />
ERC making tough decisions and that means reordering<br />
priorities. That's not something just which should be and<br />
needs to be the prerogative of the Commonwealth Government<br />
alone. JOURNALIST: Mr Greiner also claims that New South Wales has<br />
been singled out and always does at Premiers' conferences.<br />
Is that true?<br />
PM: No, no and there's no basis for making that point. We<br />
have given effect to in terms of relativities the<br />
recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission and<br />
he's got no basis for that claim.<br />
JOURNALIST: Taxes and charges, Mr Hawke, have you received<br />
any assurances from the Premiers of a likely increase in<br />
PM: Well, I must say Paul may have a comment on this I<br />
was pleasantly surprised, looking back over the discussion,<br />
at the lack of threats that what we were going to be seeing<br />
was some great charge now in increases in the area of taxes<br />
and charges. That was not an element which in any sense<br />
pervaded the meeting.<br />
KEATING: I think they accepted the fact that we want the<br />
public sector smaller, so therefore the call on the current<br />
account is smaller rather than them simply taking a cut here<br />
and then picking it up somewhere else in charges to maintain<br />
the same level of activity. I mean I think they understand<br />
that. They've been understanding it for a number of years,<br />
but they understand it better now. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Keating worthwhile projects may have to<br />
be abandoned or postponed. What does worthwhile projects<br />
mean, you know,...... talking about major road projects or<br />
what? KEATING: Well, I don't know, it depends, it depends. Look<br />
most things in the public sector have virtue.<br />
PM: Yes that's right.<br />
KEATING: I mean nearly every proposal which comes across<br />
the Prime Minister's desk or mine from ministers has some<br />
virtue. The public sector's about doing things in the<br />
public interest. That's essentially what the business is<br />
about. But if we all took that view in national terms,<br />
we'd have a massive current account deficit because our<br />
0 savings can't tolerate it. So it's about setting<br />
priorities. So whenever you hear a Premier with a hard-luck<br />
story what you generally know is he or she is not setting<br />
priorities, or he's not setting priorities.<br />
PM: in other words the other way of, just if I could sort<br />
of supplement what Paul's saying, is that the public<br />
interest is not to be seen simply through the prism of<br />
projects. I mean the public interest would be much more<br />
devastated if we in fact said yes to every spending proposal<br />
on a public project because the whole economy would<br />
collapse. So it's not as though they've got a monopoly on<br />
a perspective of the public interest. I mean our view of<br />
the public interest demands this sort of restraint and the<br />
important thing is that none of the Premiers question that<br />
fundamental analysis of the economic requirements<br />
confronting the country.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what effect will this package<br />
of measures have on interest rates?<br />
PM: Well you know that we're not in the business of making<br />
predictions in the immediate sense about what's going to<br />
happen to interest rates. All that you can say, and I want<br />
it understood the way in which I'm putting it, to the extent<br />
that we have reduced significantly the demands by the public<br />
sector in the way that we have then that is relevant to<br />
having the best possible environment in regard to both the<br />
current account and the interest rate situation.<br />
JOURNALIST: How significant a change does this represent in<br />
fiscal policy and does it reflect concerns that the..<br />
haven't been<br />
KEATING: No, it just means that we're continuing to keep<br />
that tone or if you like keeping the public system taut. It<br />
is not an attempt though to find four or five percentage<br />
points of GDP as some people would require us to do. It's<br />
about moving the public sector along with the change as far<br />
as we think it can reasonably be taken. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: But you're over one per cent. Is that an<br />
important shift?<br />
KEATING: It's a shift, yes. It's an important shift, it's<br />
a shift but it is not in satisfaction of the simplistic<br />
notion that we think that will just buy us a one per cent<br />
shift in the current account.<br />
JOURNALIST: You said in April that you'd have at least a<br />
zero PSBR. It seems from that to represent you know some<br />
tightening. But how would you characterise it?<br />
KEATING: It just means that the Government remains<br />
ambitious to keep the policy direction on the right track.<br />
I mean this has been true of its full entire history hasn't<br />
it. We have these debates when we are not turning<br />
handstands on fiscal or monetary or wages policy, every<br />
three months we get the occasional maudlin debate at these<br />
0 press conferences ' have we gone stale, have we slowed up',<br />
when in fact we're still the only Party, the only Government<br />
prepared to make the kind of changes Australia really needs.<br />
That's just obvious again today.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the topic of interest rates, a few of<br />
Australia's leading banks have posted record profits today.<br />
How do you feel about that fact in light of this week's talk<br />
after the balance of payments that interest rates will<br />
continue-to rise?<br />
KEATING: Well it's not a matter of how I feel about it,<br />
it's how their customers I mean their relationship is<br />
between themselves and their customers and if they want to<br />
shorten terms or lift repayments and post profits it's a<br />
matter of their relationship with their customers.<br />
JOURNALIST:.. KEATING: It's not a matter for me to be making judgements<br />
about them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Your state colleague called for a moratorium on<br />
interest rates, Mr Carr. Would you agree with that<br />
proposal? KEATING: Well everyone's got to live by their own rhetoric<br />
in this business.<br />
JOURNALIST: on page 2 you indicated<br />
KEATING: That's just generally the fact that the deflators<br />
we had in there were, for the forward estimates as published<br />
in April, were from those which were obtained at the end of<br />
the calendar year. All that's happened since then is that<br />
the consumer price index and other things have changed.<br />
That was worth about $ 110-120 million.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's the new.. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
KEATING: Off the top of my head I can't tell you.<br />
JOURNALIST: Exactly how much money did you take off NSW and<br />
put into these new taxes that they're raising for sewage<br />
system and<br />
KEATING: What we did was we implemented the Grants<br />
Commission recommendation completely rather than phased it.<br />
we introduced it completely, the full transition in one<br />
year. JOURNALIST: NSW also have the same sort of effect<br />
on West Australia?<br />
KEATING: It's a one year implementation and it was larger<br />
than I think most States thought it would be. And it's<br />
larger because population shifts have been larger, that some<br />
States have enjoyed higher revenues than other States<br />
because of property and share market booms etc, and because<br />
of that the States always regard the three year adjustments<br />
as being too long and the adjustments therefore too big. So<br />
they thought that if went to a one year adjustment the<br />
adjustments would be small. In fact the adjustments have<br />
been much bigger than they thought. So the States which are<br />
dealing with those adjustments have really got to be then<br />
wrestling with their budget as a result. So we thought you<br />
can't very well phase a one year adjustment so we introduced<br />
it in completely in one year.<br />
JOURNALIST: very large cuts in global borrowings for the<br />
Commonwealth authorities. What does this mean for example<br />
for Qantas a few less jumbos over the next couple of<br />
years? KEATING: No, Qantas wasn't dramatically cut. We basically<br />
tightened up on most of the other authorities and in part on<br />
Qantas. But by and large Qantas still has a very big<br />
* re-equipment program which we are funding.<br />
JOURNALIST: Out of internal funds or<br />
KEATING: In part internal funds but a lot of it borrowings.<br />
JOURNALIST: as a result of this cutback..<br />
KEATING: Telecom as I said in the meeting is financing<br />
about 94% of its program out of internally generated funds,<br />
in other words without an increase in tariffs. But whether<br />
it wishes to increase it's tariff over the years is a matter<br />
for Telecom. But we just simply make the point, when some<br />
State authorities are not even covering running costs<br />
Telecom is actually funding, by internal generation, 94% of<br />
the biggest budget in the nation. There is no authority<br />
larger than Telecom, there's no authority with a program of<br />
$ 3.1 billion, and it's doing 94% of it on its own fat<br />
without borrowings. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
JOURNALIST: What did implementing the Grants Commission<br />
recommendation in one blow instead of phasing it mean? How<br />
much money would they have got if you continued to phase in<br />
the Grants Commission<br />
[ KEATING: It doesn't mean anything for us, it just means<br />
within the pool some give up funds and others pick it up.<br />
JOURNALIST: So how much less does NSW get because of this?<br />
[ KEATING: I can't remember precisely what NSW got but<br />
whatever they lost another State picked up, we didn't pick<br />
it up. You understand?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes I understand that but how much did they<br />
forgo by deciding to raise taxes in the middle of..<br />
0 [ KEATING: They didn't forgo, they picked up another $ 200<br />
million in tax and charges.<br />
JOURNALIST: So they lost $ 200 million.<br />
[ KEATING: No, no, they picked up $ 200 million.<br />
JOURNALIST: responsibility. You're giving them a<br />
certain amount less. How much less are you giving them<br />
because of that?<br />
[ KEATING: Well, we didn't make any adjustment in relation to<br />
that. What we did was just fully introduce without phasing<br />
the Grants Commission adjustment.<br />
JOURNALIST: Which had what impact? I mean, what does that<br />
mean in tax terms.<br />
[ KEATING: To NSW?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes.<br />
[ KEATING: I can't recall but it means nothing to us because<br />
it's paid to the other States, it's part of the pool. The<br />
only saving to the Commonwealth comes off the bottom line<br />
which is $ 550 million.<br />
JOURNALIST: That's not the way NSW is looking at it?<br />
PM: Bad luck.<br />
[ KEATING: I'm sure they will because they understand the<br />
Grants Commission as well as I do. Obviously better than<br />
you do.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr [ eating, are you concerned that the States<br />
may creative accounting and get around the global limits<br />
and have you considered more tightly defining what<br />
constitutes senior Government authority.. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
KEATING: I think the Prime Minister's recollection of these<br />
events and mine, and I'm sure over the last six or seven<br />
years has been that by and large we've had very substantial<br />
compliance with the global limits. I can't remember any<br />
year when people were actually flouting them.<br />
PM: it's also that you get many examples of<br />
underspending too, of underutilisation of the limits.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the Northern Territory thinks they've<br />
been treated fairly generously, especially with the housing<br />
subsidy being continued. Will that help Labor keep<br />
Warren Snowden's seat<br />
PM: Warren Snowden was going to keep the seat very very<br />
comfortably for two reasons, one that he's an excellent<br />
Member and two, the alternatives are atrocious. So he was<br />
0 there, he was home and hosed. I can't imagine that what<br />
we've done today in the reasonable approach that we've<br />
adopted towards the Northern Territory will disadvantage him<br />
in any way. The decision wasn't taken for that purpose, we<br />
didn't have to save Warren Snowden, he as I say was home and<br />
hosed. But we did take account of the very very narrow<br />
revenue base of the Territory and so we felt that the<br />
process that we'd initiated last year of grants to help the<br />
phasing in of the adjustment that they must make should be<br />
continued this year.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the National Australia Bank..<br />
PM: They've announced did you say? I didn't hear your<br />
question, what did you say?<br />
JOURNALIST: The National Australia Bank has foreshadowed a<br />
in the next couple of weeks, basically cancel out<br />
the tax cuts?<br />
PM: No.<br />
KEATING: No, the tax cuts are enormous. Where have you<br />
been living, under a rock?<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Keating, do today's decisions signal new<br />
parameters of constraint your discussions?<br />
KEATING: It just means that the discipline which we've had<br />
on, we've been saying that a fourth consecutive year of<br />
negative outlays is our objective and you can't have it any<br />
tighter than that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Keating how would August Budget in<br />
the light of today's decisions.<br />
KEATING: It will have all of the discipline and style of<br />
all the others. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Keating you've already wrapped a total of<br />
$ 910M in cuts from the States and the Commonwealth so far.<br />
would you be tempted to go for the extra $ 90M in the August<br />
package of a round billion?<br />
KEATING: I don't know. It might just be lost in numbers I<br />
guess. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke why single out housing for special<br />
treatment? PM: Well I wouldn't say it wasn't singled out for special<br />
treatment but it made much more sense to, in a sense,<br />
regularise the concepts that have been there before. It was<br />
money available for housing but which wasn't in fact being<br />
specifically utilised for that purpose. It's interesting to<br />
note that the proposal that we put up was agreed, I think,<br />
virtually without<br />
KEATING: inaudible<br />
PM: I mean there is a need in the area the arrangements<br />
that had hitherto applied had meant a looseness and a lack<br />
of certainty about the application of available funds for<br />
housing. What we've done now means that the funds that have<br />
been there notionally available will be used.<br />
KEATING: And it's for the bottom end of the market. I mean<br />
all of this goes to the bottom end of the market. It all<br />
goes to CSHA Commonwealth State Housing Agreement funding<br />
will increase. It'll take our program from something like<br />
$ 700M to about $ lB which will be spent directly rather than<br />
some subterfuge ways which is now being employed under the<br />
nominating arrangements and a rental trust will also be<br />
directed at those sorts of low income accommodation.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Keating the NSW Government has put out some<br />
figures this afternoon based on CPI forecasts for next year<br />
They claim they got that figure from the Federal<br />
Treasury. Is that an official forecast for the next year?<br />
KEATING: 6.9 is a number that we have put about, I think,<br />
as our best guesstimate at this stage for the CPI.<br />
JOURNALIST: Average over the year?<br />
KEATING: I'm not sure it's average or through the year. I<br />
just can't remember. One of you asked me before about the<br />
parameters for That's not the..<br />
JOUNALIST: inaudible<br />
KEATING: And I couldn't remember what that number was. </p>
<p>-11-<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke changing the subject slightly.<br />
Tuckey and Mr Moore's comments on 4 Corners program, can we<br />
have your view on that and secondly are there any parallels<br />
between Mr Howard's demise as Opposition Leader and that of<br />
Bill Hayden?<br />
PM: Well really I don't think you need my comments from the<br />
performance of Mr Tuckey and Mr Moore. I think the comments<br />
that have been made by their ' friends and colleagues within<br />
the Liberal Party' are devastatingly accurate enough. The<br />
sorts of things that have been said by Mr Howard about their<br />
performances that it indicates the pattern of treachery, I<br />
think that's a reasonably fair discription and I wouldn't<br />
seek to engage in any hyperbole. I think that's a fair<br />
enough, accurate enough, telling enough discription of<br />
what's happened in the sort of environment amongst that<br />
happy bunch of pilgrims which constitutes the Liberal Party.<br />
As to the parallels now I've obviously thought about this.<br />
This is very interesting and I suppose I can speak with as<br />
much authority as anyone in the land about challenges. Now<br />
on the basis of that authority it would match your own<br />
intelligence and that is in my case I was very much aware,<br />
fully aware, of what was going on during the process of the<br />
challenge. I was not at arms length from what was<br />
happening, I new. I wasn't a challenger without knowledge.<br />
And for Mr Peacock to suggest ingenuously or dishonestly as<br />
he has that he was the draftee knowing only on the Thursday<br />
before the event, does not correspond with my own experience<br />
or with the intelligent appraisal that would be made by<br />
anyone who knows anything about politics.<br />
JOURNALIST: None the less, what's the point of having<br />
numbers men if they can't tell you what the numbers are?<br />
KEATING: Very profound. Well said.<br />
PM: That's a brief and abpupt and accurate analysis An<br />
analysis that would be shared by everyone in the country<br />
except Mr Peacock, who would have Australia believe<br />
otherwise. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke how much has the state of the economy<br />
stopped you testing popularity of the new Liberal leadership<br />
at the polls?<br />
PM: Well let's just get back to what I said before.<br />
Remember this. There's only one person, only one person,<br />
who was talking about an early election and that was a bloke<br />
called John Howard. And John Howard was doing that for two<br />
reasons. One because Keating and Hawke had brought down<br />
what Keating and Hawke had promised twelve months before<br />
that is very significant tax cuts to come in on 1 July. So<br />
there's an attempt by the late Leader and I use the word<br />
late only in a political sense the late Leader of the<br />
Liberal Party to try and divert attention from the delivery<br />
of that promise by saying, ' well this was just an election<br />
gimmick', that was the first reason he did it. The second </p>
<p>-12-<br />
PM ( cont): reason he did it was that he was aware of a<br />
fairly considerable degree of dissatisfaction if not the<br />
extent to which that discontent had developed but he was<br />
aware that there was a discontent and he hoped, I think,<br />
that if he was able to create the suggestion of an election<br />
just around the corner that the forces seeking to change him<br />
may be dissuaded. For those two reasons Mr Howard was<br />
talking about an early election. I never talked about it.<br />
I mean you realise that we still only two years not two<br />
years from the last election I hadn't been talking about<br />
it, Paul hadn't been talking about it, no-one had been<br />
talking about it but Mr Howard. So why do I keep getting<br />
questions, ' am I thinking about an early election?' I mean<br />
I'm not. Hadn't been and am not. I mean they know I have a<br />
very, very strong constitution. They are doing their best<br />
to tempt me, I know, but I've filled up now a very, very<br />
good and enviable reputation of the capacity to resist<br />
temptation. JOURNALIST: What about the prospects of a half Senate<br />
election to hold off Bob Hogg option open for<br />
consideration. How seriously is it being looked at?<br />
PM: I just go back to what I'm not thinking about<br />
elections. I'm not thinking about elections.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you understand with your track record..<br />
PM: Our track record's quite clear. In 1984 there was<br />
bringing the elections together. We had the situation there<br />
where the Parliament then ran the second Hawke Government<br />
ran virtually its full term, very close to its full term,<br />
84-87. The third Hawke Government will run much longer I<br />
would think than the average of Parliaments in the post-49<br />
period. Now how long the fourth one will run, I'm not sure,<br />
but you don't want to go that far ahead, do you?<br />
JOURNALIST: The admission of high interest rates are in<br />
fact impacting badly on the Government.<br />
PM: No. You're a strange crew loveable but strange. I<br />
mean if there's an easy, direct, uncomplicated answer to<br />
something, repudiate that because there's no story in the<br />
easy uncomplicated answer let's try and find something<br />
devious. I mean I would think you know your track record in<br />
recent times in actually forecasting and seeing what's<br />
happening, you're not too good. I mean you really want to<br />
sharpen up your game. I mean I told you in the Parliament<br />
I didn't go down and secretly tell a couple of you I stood<br />
up in the Parliament and told you what was happening. I<br />
told you the numbers, I told you the timetable. But you<br />
didn't have the wit, wisdom or the pertinacity to follow the<br />
lead that the Prime Minister gave you.<br />
JOUNALIST: Mr Hawke who told you?<br />
PM: I have my deep throat. And deep throat is staying as<br />
deep throats should. Totally unidentified. </p>
<p>-13-<br />
JOURNALIST: Was it Mr Greiner's office, Prime minister?<br />
PM: Now if I say no to that then you say, ' was it?' and I<br />
say no to that you might get me, mightn't you. I am<br />
remaining above temptation again.<br />
JOURNALIST: Back to the economy for a minute.<br />
PM: Yes Peter. You're much more interesting on Liberal<br />
Party machinations.<br />
JOURNALIST: If monetary policy fails to slow down imports<br />
in the next couple of months, are you prepared to take<br />
fiscal adjustments in the Budget?<br />
KEATING: Well to offset I mean are we prepared to adopt<br />
JOURNALIST: If monetary policy does<br />
KEATING: Let me put it in more simple terms. Are we<br />
prepared to adopt the crazed, manic Sydney Morning Herald<br />
prescription? The answer is no. No. The answer is no.<br />
Unambiguously, definetly no.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
KEATING: No, no. That is not to say we stop or move the<br />
other way. I mean they're still arguing their line about<br />
their billion dollars. As I say to you it'll be whatever<br />
number we end up with, they'll be $ 1B in front of us.<br />
PM: At least.<br />
KEATING: Yes $ 1B. They still will say that they're a<br />
comfortable billion ahead.<br />
ends </p>
