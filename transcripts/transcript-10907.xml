<p>Well ladies and gentlemen, the National Security Committee of Cabinet</p>
<p> has authorised the deployment of elements of the Australian Defence</p>
<p> Force to the Gulf. Those elements will depart tomorrow. This follows</p>
<p> discussions between Australia and the United States. As indicated</p>
<p> the elements will include a contingent of the SAS and two Boeing 707s</p>
<p> for refuelling purposes.</p>
<p>I will travel to Perth tomorrow to see the personnel before their</p>
<p> departure. I have spoken to the Leader of the Opposition and I have</p>
<p> invited him to accompany me in speaking to the forces before they</p>
<p> depart. I know that they will depart with the universal goodwill of</p>
<p> the Australian community who will be united in their hopes for their</p>
<p> safe return.</p>
<p>I should emphasise at this stage that the authority has merely been</p>
<p> for deployment and as yet no authority has been given for the engagement</p>
<p> of those forces in military activity. It remains the fervent hope</p>
<p> of the Government that this matter can still be settled by diplomatic</p>
<p> means. But it is essential as part of the preparations for military</p>
<p> action, if that becomes regrettably necessary, it is essential that</p>
<p> early deployment take place.</p>
<p>Can I express my appreciation of the decision announced today by the</p>
<p> Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mrs Shipley, which she spoke to me</p>
<p> about by telephone before making the announcement in Wellington, that</p>
<p> New Zealand had offered a contingent of SAS and also some Orions.</p>
<p> Every effort will be made for co-operation between the Australian</p>
<p> and New Zealand forces should military action become necessary. The</p>
<p> degree and the character and the extent of that co-operation is something</p>
<p> that has to be worked out at an operational level.</p>
<p>I want to emphasise that the contribution that Australia is making</p>
<p> demonstrates our desire to make it plain to Saddam Hussein and the</p>
<p> Iraqi leadership that a growing number of the states of the civilised</p>
<p> world will not tolerate or agree to his continued possession of and</p>
<p> capacity to deliver weapons of mass destruction. That does represent</p>
<p> a threat not only to the immediate region but also in the long run</p>
<p> to the security of nations around the world. And it is important that</p>
<p> that message be conveyed. It is also important that the authority</p>
<p> of the United Nations be maintained and supported and if action were</p>
<p> not to be taken, in the event of diplomatic efforts failing, then</p>
<p> the authority of the United Nations would be severely damaged and</p>
<p> undermined and there would be very significant security implications</p>
<p> for states in the Middle Eastern region but also around the world.</p>
<p>Can I say again that the forces that will be going to the Gulf are</p>
<p> forces in which all Australians feel an immense sense of pride. And</p>
<p> we all hope, first and foremost, that their use will not be necessary</p>
<p> and if that use does become necessary then that they will all safely</p>
<p> complete their mission and return home to their families and loved</p>
<p> ones.</p>
