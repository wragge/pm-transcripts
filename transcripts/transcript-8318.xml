sectors, are due to be Einalised by the end of October. A<br />

available for public comnment in the next few weeks.<br />
The Government expects the final reports to provide the<br />
basis of discussion and consideration by all levels of<br />
government on strategies to achieve ecologically sustainable<br />
development in key industry sectors. The reports will also<br />
provide important information and input for other<br />
environment-related activities, such as the<br />
Inter-Governmental Agreement on the Environment currently<br />
being discussed.<br />
Following finalisation of the reports, they will be<br />
considered initially at: the November Special Premiers'<br />

appropriate processes 2Lnd the timetable for considering the<br />
final recommendations cof the ESD working groups.<br />
The nine sectors are Agrriculture, Energy Production and<br />
Distribution, Energy Use, Fisheries, Forestry,<br />
Manufacturing, Mining, Tourism and Transport.<br />
The Government congratulates the working groups and the<br />
three Chairs Professor Stuart Harris, Professor David<br />
Throsby and Dr Roy Green for preparing the draft reports.<br />
The groups, containing representatives from industry,<br />
environmental and community organisations, as well as<br />
Commonwealth, State and Territory officials, have<br />
demonstrated a constructive and positive approach to<br />
tackling the wide rangia of issues under consideration.<br />
The Government is encouraging comments on the issues raised<br />
in the draft reports, and sees public participation as an<br />
important component of the ESD process. A public<br />
consultation program has been established, with some public<br />
forums already held and further ones planned. A survey of<br />
public attitudes on ESD issues is to commence shortly. 521 </p>
