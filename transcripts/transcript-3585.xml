Yugoslavia Speech by the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, Mr Dzemal Bijedic, at a<br />
dinner in honour of the Prime Minister of Australia in Belgrade on<br />
9 January 1975<br />
It gives me particular pleasure to have this opportunity<br />
to greet in our midst, on behalf of the<br />
Government and the peoples of Yugoslavia, and<br />
in my own, the highly prominent statesman and<br />
Prime Minister of friendly Australia, His Excellency<br />
Mr Edward Gough Whitlam, Mrs Whitlam<br />
and the distinguished members of his party,<br />
and to wish them a sincere welcome and an enjoyable<br />
stay in our country. We will endeavour,<br />
at least partly, to reciprocate the hospitality extended<br />
me and my associates during our visit to<br />
the beautiful country of Australia.<br />
I am confident that I also share your views in<br />
saying, Mr Prime Minister, that our relations<br />
have been developing ever more successfully<br />
during the past years and that your visit will encourage<br />
their further promotion, enrichment<br />
with new forms and substance and extension to<br />
new fields. We wish such a development of<br />
relations and we will, on our part, exert efforts in<br />
that direction. Yugoslavia has consistently<br />
adhered to its policy of co-operation with all<br />
states on the basis of respect for independence,<br />
sovereignty, non-interference and mutual<br />
interests. We are convinced that along these<br />
bases it is possible to develop diversified and<br />
long-term co-operation between our two<br />
countries.<br />
Your visit is taking place at a time when in many<br />
quarters of the world, despite substantive<br />
results achieved in the sphere of the policy of<br />
relaxation of tensions and negotiation, the situation<br />
is becoming more complicated, and is<br />
seriously deteriorating. The danger of a new<br />
outbreak of conflict in the Middle East is<br />
imminent due to the persistent aggressive and<br />
expansionist policy pursued by Israel, which constitutes a direct dramatic challenge to world<br />
peace. For this reason it is vital for the international<br />
community to exert efforts, as a matter<br />
of utmost urgency, towards having the crisis in<br />
the Middle East resolved on the basis of the sole<br />
possible premises which, for that matter, have<br />
been widely accepted: Israel's withdrawal from<br />
all the occupied Arab territories and the full realisation<br />
of the legitimate national rights of the<br />
Arab people of Palestine, including the right to<br />
establish a state of their own, a right enjoyed by<br />
all the peoples in the world. In fact, this right has<br />
received broad support during the past session<br />
of the United Nations General Assembly. This is<br />
the only possible way to achieve peace in this<br />
part of the world on just and lasting foundations<br />
and to ensure independence and security of all<br />
the peoples and countries in the region.<br />
As regards the Cyprus crisis, we are of the<br />
opinion that the implementation of the resolution<br />
of the United Nations-which was supported<br />
by all member states of the United<br />
Nations-constitutes the only basis for finding a<br />
durable settlement acceptable to both ethnic<br />
communities. The slow progress in solving the<br />
Cyprus crisis and its persistence constitutes a<br />
source of danger both for Cyprus proper and for<br />
peace in the broader area.<br />
In Viet-Nam, the Paris Agreements continue to<br />
be violated by the Saigon regime. It is in the<br />
interest of stability and peace to secure full and<br />
strict implementation of the provisions of the<br />
Paris Agreements and respect for the right of<br />
the people of Viet-Nam to decide their own<br />
future in sovereignty, freedom and independence. </p>
<p>In the present-day ever more complex and<br />
increasingly uncertain international situation,<br />
the co-operation of all forces of progress, peace<br />
and liberation is vital so as to consolidate and<br />
render international relations more democratic,<br />
to resolve outstanding international issues and<br />
obtaining crises by giving substance to the<br />
legitimate aspirations of all peoples toward freedom,<br />
independence and establishment of equitable<br />
international co-operation. It is only on<br />
such premises that a durable and just peace for<br />
all countries and peoples can be reached. The<br />
non-aligned countries which, in co-operation<br />
with other developing countries, have rendered<br />
an invaluable contribution to such a development,<br />
are willing to co-operate with all countries<br />
and with all forces having identical goals.<br />
The world-wide easing of tensions in specific<br />
spheres of international relations is in the<br />
interest of all countries. Detente, however, in<br />
order to evolve into a world process and lead to a<br />
genuine peace, must extend to all parts of the<br />
world. Likewise, it is essential that all countries<br />
should participate on an equal footing in the<br />
resolution of international problems.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, the special session of the<br />
General Assembly of the United Nations has<br />
demonstrated the necessity for establishing a<br />
new economic order and equitable economic<br />
relations in the world. The prevailing situation<br />
clearly indicates the untenability of existing<br />
economic relations in the world based on exploitation<br />
of the majority of mankind, on<br />
inequity and privileges of the developed countries.<br />
All this testifies to the indispensability of<br />
essential changes in the existing system along<br />
the lines accepted by the entire international<br />
community. The non-aligned and the developing<br />
countries have offered a constructive program<br />
pledging necessary changes while<br />
respecting the interests of all countries and taking<br />
into account the growing interdependence<br />
in the world. Regrettably, all international factors<br />
have not accepted the outstretched hand<br />
and are attempting to preserve obsolete relations<br />
and existing privileges through imposition<br />
and confrontation.<br />
We are following with keenest attention the activity<br />
of your country and your personal endeavours<br />
on the international scene. Yugoslavia<br />
highly appreciates the constructive role which Australia is playing in the efforts to achieve assertion<br />
of the principles of equitable cooperation,<br />
and your contribution to the constructive<br />
approach in dealing with international<br />
problems, by recognising the new realities in<br />
the world and the necessity of its continuous<br />
change. We feel that these are sound bases for<br />
our co-operation.<br />
Dear Friend, the large number of Yugoslav emigrants<br />
living in Australia, represents a special<br />
link between Yugoslavia and Australia. They<br />
have found in your country a home away from<br />
home and, as loyal citizens of Australia, by<br />
working diligently, are making their contribution<br />
to its development and prosperity.<br />
During our visit to Australia we were able to see<br />
for ourselves that their work and role are held in<br />
high esteem in Australian society, as well as<br />
their contribution to the promotion of friendly<br />
relations between our two countries.<br />
It is no secret, however, that there are also extremist<br />
elements who oppose such cooperation.<br />
I take this opportunity to reiterate<br />
that the Government of Yugoslavia values the<br />
efforts by the Australian side which have been<br />
made towards curbing fascist-terrorist activities<br />
of small groups and individuals in the Australian<br />
territory. We hope that these efforts will continue<br />
and that they will be intensified as this terrorism<br />
is directed not only against Yugoslavia,<br />
but also against Yugoslav-Australian friendly<br />
co-operation and all the democratic forces in<br />
the world. As an expression of the past it constitutes<br />
a vestige of the fascist forces which had<br />
been condemned by the international community<br />
and whose activity is a subject matter<br />
being dealt with by the United Nations. Turning<br />
ourselves towards the future, it is our wish to<br />
build new bridges so that our mutual cooperation<br />
may become even closer. I wish particularly<br />
to emphasise that our migrants should<br />
be a link of friendship and co-operation between<br />
our countries. Our bilateral relations are<br />
becoming increasingly comprehensive. However,<br />
there still exist numerous unexploited<br />
possibilities for their further and more meaningful<br />
expansion both in the sphere of political and<br />
scientific-technical and cultural co-operation.<br />
In particular, in the economic co-operation<br />
which is lagging far behind the real possibilities. </p>
<p>In the prevailing conditions of an ever greater<br />
interlinking in the world, every constructive and<br />
fruitful co-operation between countries,<br />
regardless of how distant they may be, constitutes<br />
a positive and effective contribution to the<br />
improvement of overall international relations. </p>
<p>Speech by the Prime Minister of Australia at a dinner given in his<br />
honour by the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia in Belgrade on<br />
9 January 197<br />
It gives me great satisfaction to come to<br />
Yugoslavia and reciprocate the historic visit<br />
which you, Mr Prime Minister, paid to Australia<br />
in March 1 973. Your visit was the first to<br />
Australia by a Prime Minister of Yugoslavia:<br />
mine is the first by an Australian Prime Minister<br />
to your country. Yet sixty years have passed<br />
since our soldiers first fought together in World<br />
War 1. Australia's involvement in the Balkans<br />
led to one of the most significant military actions<br />
in our history. Australians admire the proud tra<br />
ditions of independence of the Yugoslav<br />
peoples. We admire the heroism with which<br />
you resisted great power domination in the First<br />
World War and fascist aggression in the Second.<br />
We admire the determination with which<br />
you have continued to assert your independence<br />
under the leadership of President Tito. I<br />
salute your President as one of the outstanding<br />
statesmen of our time-the builder, the inspira<br />
tion, not only of a nation, but of a great world<br />
movement for peace and human brotherhood.<br />
Under his guidance, your country has become<br />
an authentic symbol of the hopes of millions of<br />
people in the developing world for peace,<br />
progress and independence.<br />
When my Government took office in December<br />
1 972, it was faced with a world in which dramatic<br />
changes in international relationships had<br />
created not only new complexities in international<br />
affairs, but also new opportunities and<br />
challenges. At that time I stated: The change of<br />
government provides a new opportunity for us<br />
to reassess the whole range of Australian<br />
foreign policies and attitudes. our thinking is<br />
towards a more independent Australian stance<br />
in international affairs and towards an Australia<br />
which will be less militarily oriented and not<br />
open to suggestions of racism: an Australia<br />
which will enjoy a growing standing as a distinctive,<br />
tolerant, co-operative and wellregarded<br />
nation not only in the Asian and<br />
Pacific region but in the world at large.<br />
The basis of Australian policy remains the com mitment to independence, to the right of all<br />
countries to manage their affairs in their own<br />
way, without interference. It is because of this<br />
commitment that Australia, while maintaining<br />
its traditional friendships, has recognised the<br />
need to develop its own contacts with all countries,<br />
regardless of their political systems, and<br />
take account of their views in formulating its<br />
own policies. Independence does not mean the<br />
assertion of purely national self-interest. In our<br />
increasingly complex and interdependent<br />
world, no state can seek to impose its own views<br />
on others. With the right to independence and<br />
equality goes the duty of international cooperation,<br />
the duty to strive for the removal of<br />
the causes of tension and conflict in all fields<br />
and in all regions.<br />
Perhaps no country has supported and practised<br />
these principles more than Yugoslavia.<br />
You have made an outstanding contribution to<br />
international co-operation both in the United<br />
Nations and elsewhere. Indeed there can be few<br />
countries which, in their national Constitutions,<br />
have committed themselves so firmly to the<br />
principles of the United Nations Charter.<br />
Yugoslavia's approach in international relations<br />
seems to be best manifested in its commitment<br />
to non-alignment, a concept which embodies<br />
the principles of independence and international<br />
co-operation: a concept which President<br />
Tito was instrumental in formulating and in<br />
which he remains the dynamic force.<br />
There are encouraging signs that the world,<br />
community is beginning to work for global solutions<br />
to the problems of poverty, hunger,<br />
economic deprivation and the threat of war. The<br />
United Nations Sixth Special Session and the<br />
World Food Conference demonstrated a<br />
renewed international commitment to the problems<br />
of the disadvantaged. This impetus<br />
towards international co-operation, this retreat<br />
from isolationism, must be sustained. Too often<br />
in the past, opportunities for peaceful development<br />
have been passed over by the inter-</p>
<p>national community. We have failed to grasp<br />
opportunities to set the world on the path to<br />
peace: We have failed to eliminate the threat of<br />
war: we have failed to regulate the development<br />
and proliferation of the instruments of war. The<br />
threat posed by the production and proliferation<br />
of nuclear weapons is the most awesome ever<br />
posed to the future of mankind. The development<br />
of measures to eliminate the threat of<br />
nuclear war is therefore the most pressing issue<br />
which confronts us.<br />
The issues which symbolise the change in Australian<br />
foreign policy under my Governmentand<br />
the increasing similarity of approach between<br />
Australia and Yugoslavia-are<br />
colonialism and racism. It is my conviction that<br />
the most significant historical trend since the<br />
Second World War has been the struggle to end<br />
imperialism, colonialism and racial discrimination.<br />
One of my first actions after coming to<br />
power was to instruct our representatives at the<br />
United Nations to add Australia's voice to the<br />
international condemnation of colonialism and<br />
racism. We have supported all actions in the<br />
United Nations against the illegal racist regime<br />
in Rhodesia and against the infamous policy of<br />
apartheid. Recently Australia voted in the<br />
Security Council for the expulsion of South<br />
Africa from the United Nations for its twentyeight-<br />
year-long flouting of the most basic principles<br />
of the Charter: we have joined the United<br />
Nations Council on Namibia: reactivated our<br />
membership of the United Nations Committee<br />
of Twenty-four: and are providing assistance to<br />
subject peoples in their fight for liberation.<br />
In pursuing more independent policies, my<br />
Government has sought to identify the common<br />
interests which Australia shares with a broad<br />
range of countries. Australia straddles many of<br />
the categories which are often used to distinguish<br />
countries-namely, the developed<br />
from the developing, the rich from the poor, the<br />
second from the third world, the producers from<br />
the consumers, the aligned from the nonaligned.<br />
Ours is a developed country, yet the<br />
foundations of much of our prosperity on primary<br />
production and the export of minerals has<br />
made us conscious of the problems faced by<br />
both producers and consumers. As a<br />
predominantly European community in the<br />
Asian and Pacific region, we are conscious of<br />
the pressing requirements of our neighbours. As a comparatively rich country, we accept the<br />
responsibility of extending asistance to the<br />
developing countries. Bound by treaty to the<br />
United States, we nonetheless respect and seek<br />
to understand further the views of those<br />
countries which have chosen to espouse nonalignment.<br />
The bilateral relations between Australia and<br />
Yugoslavia are strong and cordial. My visit will<br />
help to strengthen them. Many migrants of<br />
Yugoslav origin live in Australia. Their skills and<br />
initiative have contributed to Australia's<br />
progress and form an enduring bond between<br />
our nations. I believe, Mr Prime Minister, that<br />
after your visit to Australia you were satisfied<br />
that my Government is determined to do all in<br />
its power to prevent and punish criminal acts of<br />
terrorism directed against Yugoslavia by a small<br />
minority of malcontents and undesirables. You<br />
may be assured that we will hold firmly to our<br />
commitment. Trade between our countries is growing and<br />
there is every sign that it will grow further. It is<br />
my hope that we shall soon enter into long-term<br />
agreements for increased trade. I hope to see a<br />
greatly increased flow of private business,<br />
officials and experts between our two countries.<br />
Recent negotiations leading to the conclusion of<br />
a bilateral civil aviation agreement covering<br />
flights of your national airline to Australia and<br />
ours to Belgrade is a positive contribution to this<br />
goal. Negotiations for the conclusion of a<br />
Cultural Agreement are well advanced.<br />
The relationship between Australia and<br />
Yugoslavia is based on an affinity of views on<br />
the fundamentals of the international order. An<br />
interdependent world demands co-operation<br />
rather than confrontation: and no state, however<br />
great, should threaten the independence of<br />
another state, however small. These shared beliefs,<br />
and the opportunities and demands presented<br />
by a troubled world, form the basis of a<br />
friendship that will be healthy and beneficial for<br />
our two countries, and a constructive contribution<br />
to the wider needs of peace and understanding<br />
in the world. </p>
<p>Speech by President Tito of Yugoslavia at a luncheon in honour of<br />
the Prime Minister of Australia in Belgrade on 10 January 1975<br />
I would like to express the great pleasure, of my<br />
wife, Jovanka, of myself and of all of us, to have<br />
you all here as our guests today. You have come<br />
from a far-away country geographically but one<br />
close-by in terms of aspirations and outlook on<br />
the world, in terms of efforts for the best possible<br />
relations throughout the entire world, in<br />
terms of eliminating, as soon as possible, the<br />
various negative features which even today are<br />
still burdening our world.<br />
Many of our countrymen live in your country...<br />
some arrived before the last war, and<br />
others immediately after that war, but these are<br />
two categories of people who differ in many ways. Those who originally left Yugoslavia to go<br />
to your country did so because of economic<br />
need, because they lived in great poverty. But<br />
among those who went immediately after the<br />
last war, there were those who were traitors,<br />
who had collaborated with the occupiers and<br />
committed terrible crimes-crimes you and<br />
your people did not know about. Naturally these<br />
two categories of our people who found a home<br />
in your friendly country had to come into conflict<br />
and to hate each other, to a situation which was<br />
not in the interest of our two countries. I know<br />
that you, personally, Mr Prime Minister, and<br />
your Government, have done a great favour to<br />
us by realising that it is not all the same who<br />
