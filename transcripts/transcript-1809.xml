ARRIVAL STATEMENTS BY NEW ZEALAND PRIME<br />
MINISTER, MR. HOILYOAKE9 AND PRIME MINISTER<br />
JOHN GORTON OF AUSTRALIA AT WELLINGTON AIRPORT<br />
27 MARCH 1968<br />
MR. HOLYCAKE: I want to say how delighted I am that Mr. Gorton<br />
has come to visit us and has also brought his wife with him.<br />
You all remember, and I do particularly, John,<br />
that it is just a little over a year ago that we had Harold<br />
Holt here. N,; wee re very fond of him, and I know we will be<br />
of you as well. This is a wonderful gesture that you have<br />
come over here so soon on your first overseas visit, to this<br />
your sister dominion.<br />
I do not know what new I can say because the press<br />
have been asking me, and asking you the other side of the<br />
Tasman, but we will of course, gentlemen, be discussing<br />
everything that I can imagine of mutual interest to our two<br />
countries. Don't ask me what the agenda is. We have no<br />
formal agenda. It would be much easier to enumerate the<br />
things we might not talk about, because we will have a lot<br />
of opportunity in the coming two or three days we are<br />
travelling together, but our talks are bound to cover trade,<br />
defence, our common interests in the Commonwealth, the United<br />
Nations, and all the subjects that are of current world<br />
interest at the present time.<br />
John, a very warm welcome, and I hope you enjoy<br />
these three days with us.<br />
MR. GORTON: Thank you very much, Mr. Prime Minister. For my own<br />
part, it is a delight for me to be able to be in New Zealand<br />
so soon after becoming the Prime Minister of Australia.<br />
One of the first things I did when I became Prime<br />
Minister was to ring up the Prime Minister of New Zealand to<br />
let him know that this had happiened, because we had known<br />
each other before and because of the particular closeness<br />
that our two C. ountries have, and this very kind invitation<br />
of yours to follow that up is something which I appreciate<br />
and which I think the people of Australia appreciate.<br />
We will be talking about a whole variety of matters,<br />
but these will I think perhaps better be dealt with at the<br />
formal press conference that is going to be heald tomorrow, and<br />
questions can be asked about particular matters. But quite<br />
apart from any specific things that wie may discuss, there is<br />
over and above that, I think, the advantage of the general<br />
meeting for myself the particular advantage of meeting<br />
yourself and your Ministers who were so kind to come out to<br />
the aerodrome today. a -/ 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
You spoke of an overseas visit, and indeed it is<br />
an overseas visit because we flew across a lot of sea to get<br />
here, but really it was not as far in miles for me as it would<br />
have been if I had gone to Perth in Western Australia, and it<br />
was not as long in time as it would have been if I had gone<br />
to Perth in Western Australia. So though overseas, this, I<br />
think, emphasises the neighbourliness that we have, and I<br />
thank you for the invitation, Sir, to come here.<br />
I believe there will be benefit to both our nations,<br />
and I think this will be the forerunner indeed, it is not<br />
so much a forefunner as a continuation of a situation where<br />
your Ministers visit us and our Ministers visit you so<br />
frequently that it occasions no particular comment, and then<br />
I think we will have reached an even closer stage than we<br />
ha. ve at present. Thank you very much.<br />
