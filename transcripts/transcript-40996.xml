    <content><![CDATA[<p>Singaporeans will have exclusive access to a new long-term, multiple-entry visa option by 1 January 2018, making it easier to travel to Australia for business and pleasure.</p>
<p>The Visitor (Subclass 600) visa will allow travellers to visit Australia for up to three months at a time, over a six-year period, with a single application.</p>
<p>The new visa option was announced during the Prime Minister’s official visit to Singapore, and will further strengthen ties between our two countries.</p>
<p>Alongside Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister Turnbull also announced a new reciprocal Work and Holiday Maker programme will commence on 1 August 2017.</p>
<p>With up to 500 places per year, the programme will allow young people from Australia and Singapore to undertake short term work or study.</p>
<p>Last financial year, more than 230,000 visitor visas were granted to travellers from Singapore, up 16 per cent compared with the previous year.</p>
<p>These new visa arrangements will further boost tourism and business links between Australia and Singapore.</p>
<p>It will make it easier for people to come to Australia to visit friends and family while also enabling business operators to conduct regular meetings or attend conferences in Australia.</p>
<p>These announcements build on the Australia-Singapore Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.</p>
<p>Applicants must satisfy all usual visa criteria, including health and character requirements and have adequate funds to support themselves for the period of the visit.</p>
<p>Details of the new arrangements will be made available at the Australian Visa Application Centre’s website in Singapore.</p>
