STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
AUSTRALIA DAY ADDRESS<br />
AUSTRALIAN OF THE YEAR AWARDS BREAKFAST<br />
ADMIRALTY HOUSE, SYDNEY, 26 JANUARY 1992<br />
This last year has been one of unprecedented global<br />
upheaval: of change so rapid we f ind ourselves having to<br />
confront international realities that were inconceivable<br />
twelve months ago. We have witnessed the disintegration o~ f<br />
the second most powerful nation on earth, and the re-birth<br />
of nation states and national movements dormant f or<br />
generations.. We have seen the face of Europe change. We<br />
have seen the emergence of a dictator in the Middle East;,<br />
and unprecedented international cooperation to defeat him.<br />
Few eras have been so uncertain or so promising. The<br />
world is being re-made, not just in Europe but in our own<br />
immediate region in Asia where economic growth is faster<br />
than anywhere else in the world, where no one yet knows what<br />
the future political landscape will be, and where Qlux future<br />
substantiall. y lies.<br />
We cannot hide from these realities. We must be ready and<br />
able to adapt. We must be strong enough and independent<br />
enough to bEt a constructive political and economic player in<br />
the new ordetr. In one sense we have never been so alone: in<br />
another we have never been so much a part of the world.<br />
In facing these challenges we ought to take both courage and<br />
pride in what we have already achieved. Because it is true<br />
to say that, if the changes here have not occurred with the<br />
same astonishing speed, they have been profound.<br />
Only a generation ago we lived as an isolated outpost of<br />
Europe largely protected from the wider world by high tariff<br />
barriers and a cosy but increasingly unrealistic<br />
relationship with Great Britain. We have moved a long way<br />
from that: our course is now fixed towards a robust<br />
internationally competitive economy based on not just our<br />
great natural wealth but our human skills and energy in<br />
manufacturing and services. </p>
<p>Only a decade ago our workplace relations and our wages<br />
system were governed by an inflexible code of hostility, a<br />
conventional wisdom that the interests of employers and<br />
employees were naturally opposed. That is emphatically no<br />
longer the case.<br />
Less than a generation ago we still lived in fear of Asia<br />
we regarded our near neighbours with a mixture of ignorance,<br />
hostility anad condescension. We are now much more a part of<br />
the region, much more at home economically, and as the<br />
Cambodian peace settlement so dramatically testifies,<br />
politically. Without sacrificing social cohesion, we have become a much<br />
more complex society. Where for so long we were notorious<br />
for the White Australia Policy, we now enjoy a large measure<br />
of respect for the tolerance manifest in our immigration and<br />
multicultural policies.<br />
Perhaps we should not be surprised if these and other<br />
profound cultural and economic changes have made many<br />
Australians wonder if the traditions of their country, the<br />
values for which they have worked and fought, are not under<br />
attack. I suspect there are many Australians who are<br />
wondering if their Australia will survive the changes i<br />
there will b~ e a place for the " old Australia" in the new.<br />
I have no doubt that the best of Australia will survive<br />
in fact it must. The hard-won traditions of democracy, of<br />
fairness an~ d equity, individual opportunity and personal<br />
security, our way of life and those institutions which<br />
guarantee our freedom, will remain the guiding principles cof<br />
Australia. Indeed it is becauise we want these values to survive that we<br />
must re-make Australia. There is no question about it if<br />
the good society we all want is to become reality we have to<br />
become a more dynamic, more efficient and cohesive society.<br />
We have to become a nation with a more truly natin U<br />
purpose. With other ministers in recent weeks I have spoken to<br />
representatives of Australian business all kinds of<br />
Australian business. I've spoken to state premiers and<br />
their senior ministers, and I've spoken to trade union<br />
leaders. The spirit of cooperation and endeavour, the good<br />
will, the unanimous commitment to economic recovery, and the<br />
idleas which emerged from these discussions re-affirmed my<br />
belief that we can successfully respond to the two great<br />
imperatives: the immediate one of stimulating economic<br />
growth and -getting people back to work, and, in the longer<br />
term, completing the task of creating a revitalised and<br />
vigorous Australia. </p>
<p>One hundred years ago the colonies which were soon to form<br />
the Australian nation were deep in the worst depression and<br />
the worst drought Australia has ever experienced. Yet the<br />
1890s was remarkable for the sense of nationhood which<br />
emerged. It was the first great flowering of the Australian<br />
spirit. Much of the old Australia was born in that decade.<br />
The new Australia, I firmly believe, can be born in this<br />
one. We can build on those great traditions and that spirit<br />
to meet the challenges which face us now.<br />
I believe we need have no doubt about the future of our<br />
nation no doubt that we can come out of this recession<br />
much stronger, with a much firmer basis for full employment<br />
and long term prosperity, and with a clearer vision of our<br />
common goal.<br />
So in presenting these awards for the 1991 Australian and<br />
Young Australian of the Year we are honouring, I think,<br />
people who exemplify the spirit of Australia: that means,<br />
among many things, courage and enterprise, faith in<br />
ourselves, pride in our past but with eyes firmly fixed on<br />
our future.<br />
On behalf of the government and people of Australia I<br />
congratulate you all, and thank you for the example you have<br />
set us. </p>
