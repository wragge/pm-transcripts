    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the Governor-General has approved the appointment of a new Chairman of the Council for the Order of Australia, the Honourable Sir James Gobbo AC, CVO.</p>
<p>This appointment follows the retirement of Rear Admiral Peter Sinclair AC after an extended period of service as Chairman. Admiral Sinclair was first appointed to the Council in 1996 and I would like to express, on behalf of the government and myself, our appreciation for the important contribution he has made to the work of the Council.</p>
<p>Sir James Gobbo is an outstanding Australian with a long history of public service in many leadership and representative positions, including as a Judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria, Chairman of the Australian Council of Multicultural Affairs and Chairman of the Australian Banking Industry Ombudsman. Most recently he concluded a four year term as the Governor of Victoria. Sir James has also been associated with many community organisations and charities throughout his career.</p>
<p>I am delighted that this distinguished Australian has agreed to give his time to this important role. Sir James brings to the Council a breadth of experience and achievement that all Australians can respect and admire.</p>
<p>22 August 2001</p>
