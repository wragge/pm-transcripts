    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, today called on all of the 10 million men in Australia to swear never to commit, excuse, or stay silent about violence against women.</p>
<p>With nearly one in three Australian women experiencing physical violence, the Prime Minister said White Ribbon Day remained an important part of educating the community on violence against women.</p>
<p>Mr Rudd congratulated White Ribbon and other community campaigns for the important role they play in changing community attitudes.</p>
<p>The National Community Attitudes Towards Violence against Women Survey 2009 - released today - found that despite a significant shift in Australians' attitudes and beliefs towards violence against women, there is still more work to be done.</p>
<p>Results show that since 1995, when the last survey was conducted, understanding of domestic and sexual violence and its impacts has broadened amongst the Australian community. Fewer Australians condone violence.</p>
<p>The survey incorporated the views of more than 10,000 Australians, with roughly equal numbers of men and women participating in the survey.</p>
<p>It provides a strong evidence base for developing the Government's social marketing campaign and our National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women.</p>
<p>The Australian Government has a zero tolerance approach when it comes to violence against women.</p>
<p>Australians agree that they want to live in a community where all women can live free of violence.</p>
<p>Attitude change does not necessarily lead to behaviour change. The Government's challenge is to try to ensure that it does.</p>
<p>That's why we're developing a National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women, with a focus on early intervention and respectful relationships.</p>
<p>On 29 April 2009, the Government welcomed the National Council to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children report Time for Action.</p>
<p>The Australian Government has referred Time for Action to the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) and is working with State and Territory Governments to develop the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women for release in 2010.</p>
<p>The Government is already investing $26 million for primary prevention and respectful relationships programs for young people, while the $17 million social marketing campaign will focus on changing the social norms, attitudes and behaviours that contribute to violence.</p>
<p>In addition, the Government has lifted funding for homelessness by 55 per cent and is building 19,200 new social housing homes under the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan - measures which will help women escaping violence.</p>
