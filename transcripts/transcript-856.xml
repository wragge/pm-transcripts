    <content><![CDATA[<p>OPENING OF KINGSWOOD COLLEGE UNIVERSITY<br />OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA ON SUNIAY, 17TH<br />NOVEMBER, 1 363<br />Speech by the Prime Minister, ' the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chancellor, Your Grace and Ladies and<br />Gentlemen I think I ought to begin by giving you a short but<br />powerful talk on the warming qualities of wool. ( Laughter)<br />I went around earlier among my gaily caparisoned colleagues<br />on the bench here and fingered their robes. I am the only<br />one who is all wool and a yard wide. ( Laughter) Anyhow, that<br />will have one great advantage and that is, it will shorten my<br />speech, because it is a warm day.<br />Now, Sir, I am over here, of course as everybody<br />knows, on certain illicit occasions. This is a day off. This<br />is my one unquestionably respectable day in the period of three<br />or four weeks, and I was delighted to find that I could still<br />accept the invitation to open this College, this new extension,<br />this building, because, as I don't need to tell you, I have a<br />very profound belief in places like this and it has been my<br />very great privilege to make some contribution to the development<br />of university education and of residential colleges over the<br />last ten years. Coming across yesterday in the plane and bereft of<br />all books of reference, I was trying to remember something that<br />had provoked a thought in my mind. I hope I remember it<br />accurately. Many of you will recall it. Wordsworth in " The<br />Prelude" has a marvellous description of the statue of<br />Newton " Newton with his prism and silent face,<br />The marble index of a mind for ever<br />Voyaging through strange seas of Thought alone."<br />Those lines have always stuck in my mind "' voyaging through<br />strange seas of Thought alone." Well, perhaps some of is may<br />occasionally be tempted to feel that we are explorers of the<br />same fashion, but most of us are not. It may very well be that<br />some man of soaring genius to use the word in its proper<br />sense like Newton like Einstein, may indeed go through<br />strange seas, all alone, perhaps without the need of company or<br />companionship, or fellow workers. I don't know. But no<br />doubt, every now and then in the history of the world there is<br />somebody who achieves something tremendous, adds something<br />tremendous to the sum of human knowledge and who does it as an<br />individual, exploring a problem, lonely, complete in himself,<br />just as there may well be in the history of the world great<br />thinkers who were in effect hermits who shut themselves away<br />from the world. iAut for most of us, for the overwhelming<br />majority of people in this world, work cannot be done just<br />alone. Education cannot be regarded as a purely individual<br />matter. That's why we have universities. Thatts why we have<br />residential colleges, because what we are seeking to do is to<br />extend the boundaries of knowledge in a mass of people, working<br />together, getting to know each other, learning from each other,<br />the whole matter being part of the process of producing civilised<br />people. And, of course, by definition originallyI suppose,<br />a " 1civilised person' was a person who lived in a city. He was<br />/ 2</p>
<p>2<br />by definition, a man who lived among others, who learned from<br />others, the result being that in the total there was a degree.<br />of knowledge, a degree of genuine instruction, a degree of<br />genuine understanding which amounted to what we call civilised<br />education. Now, Sir, we occasionally forget it, The world<br />occasionally forgets it, but what we all are looking for is a<br />civilised life, civilised relations between the nations of the<br />world, civilised relations between the people who live in our<br />own country, and a civilised life is a life lived in a human<br />society. That's the first thing that we must remember. Not<br />lived in the abstract but lived in a human society. And therefore<br />if education is devoted to the task, as I believe it is of<br />equipping us for civilised life, then I venture to say that<br />education is at all times best considered when achieved in a<br />social setting, and when I say social setting, I am not referrimg<br />to that word " social" with a capital ' IS" that you read in the<br />gossip columns. A social setting, a setting among human beings.<br />I was just saying to myself, " Suppose a man couldn't<br />go to a university, suppose he couldn't go and live in a residential<br />college, suppose he lived out somewhere in the middle of a<br />desert but was able in some mysterious fashion to have a correspondence<br />course of instruction this would be a good thing, of<br />course but it wouldn't be that kind of education which you and<br />I in this place, and many others understand and benefit from.<br />It would be a lonely kind of inst; ruction; it would be an<br />instruction from books from documents not an instruction<br />gathered in the general rough and tumble and shoulder-rubbing<br />of a student community.<br />I remember when I first set up a committee not the<br />famous Murray Committee but an earlier one to give me a little<br />advice on what grants migh-,' be made for the lime being to the<br />universities, one member of the Committee, when I spoke to him<br />about residential colleges, said, " Oh, no, no. Residential<br />colleges?" I remember his words I made a note of it yesterdayhe<br />said, " Residential colleges are luxuries for those who can<br />afford them", and I have never had the same opinion of that man<br />since. I thought what an utterly uncivilised conception that was<br />that colleges are luxuries for those who can afford them, and I<br />remember with some satisfaction the reply I made to him, I said,<br />" This Committee will make a recommendation for residential<br />colleges or the Committee will be a luxury that I can't afford."<br />( Laughter) And so it came about and from there on it has grown<br />in strength as time has gone on.<br />But just to come back to theibbing of shoulders, to<br />the community significance of education. I don't know how people<br />can fail to understand it. One man goes to the university and<br />he is determined as I was in my time to be a lawyer, using<br />that term in its broadest sense, but determined at any rate to<br />become a lawyer. There is another man who is in the same college<br />o? ro oidn ththine g satmhea t gtrhoueyp wshhoo uilsd dgeette rtmo inkendow toe acbhec oomteh ear dqoucitteo r. e arVlye. ry<br />Laughter) If contact at the university between medical students<br />and law studants had been made compulsory, I don't think I could<br />have cross-examined so many medical men so successfully in my<br />later life, There is something to learn each way.<br />You know, I regret to tell you this but in my time at<br />the university if somebody were pointed out who had a rather<br />melancholy cast of countenance, you would be told that he was / 3</p>
<p>" 3<br />a 1theolog" ( Laughter). Yes. All I can say is that I think<br />nothing better could be imagined -than for theological students<br />and arrant sinners to be thrown together at a university-<br />( Laughter) ( Applause) the sinners being helped by contact with<br />something a little better at the right time and the " theolog"<br />being immeasurably improved by making the first of all great<br />discoveries, that he is a sinner as well as the others. ( Laughter)<br />This is the kind of contact that goes on. It was magnificently<br />described, if you will allow me to say so in his presence by the<br />President-General in a sermon he preached this morning, one<br />fragment only of which I venture to steal with acknowledgment,<br />That was when he said that really in this business of acquiring<br />knowledge what we all need to do is every now and then to look<br />over the other mants shoulder and see the problem with the<br />other man's eyes. Now you see how profoundly true this is,<br />It is so easy to become narrow-minded; it is so easy to become<br />dogmatic; it's so easy to say, " Well, I am so objective in my<br />approach to this matter that I forget that I am being completely<br />subjective. It is only my mind, my view, my general atmosphere,<br />my general background that concern me in studying that particular<br />problem," What we must learn to do and the world needs it<br />des erately badly is to understand something about the other<br />man s mind and the other man's approach and how things look to<br />him from his angle viewed from which the problem, the subject,<br />may look an entirely different shape. This is I think,<br />tremendously important and this is why residen~ ial colleges are<br />tremendously important because they get away from the idea that<br />a man having attended his lecture, having gone to the library and<br />checked up his references, having done some reading of his own,<br />then disappears, so to speak, into outer darkness until the next<br />appearance in a lecture. For men to be living in a com~ munity,<br />a community of good minds some better than others of course<br />but of good minds, a community in which brains can be anticipated<br />from any particular quarter, in which they can discuss things<br />with each other in which the man who is doing humanities of<br />one kind or another gets to know something about the science<br />student and what goes on in his mind and what is even more<br />important, the sicence student gets to know something about the<br />humanities. This is tremendously important.<br />It is this subdivision of learning into separate<br />compartments which produces so much danger for the world<br />the nuclear scientist so bemjused by the brilliance of his own,<br />discoveries that he will shrug his shoulders and say, " Well, what<br />happens to all this is, of course, not my business". In a sense,<br />I suppose, it isn't, but I imagine that he would be no worse as<br />a scientist and so much better as a citizen if all the time he<br />had the contemplation of the impact of these things on humanity<br />and how people thought about them, In other words If<br />scientists and the humanists really got together and rubbed off<br />a little of their gold on to each other, this would be, I am<br />sure, a very good thing for the world, and it is best achieved<br />where people live together and play together and argue together.<br />They have a very good chance of coming out not only admiirable<br />graduated students, in a variety of disciplines but vastly<br />improved human beings designed to live in a civilised society<br />because they will broaden their miinds they will know enough<br />about what other people do and what o~ her people think to<br />preserve them from the excesses of the utterly narrow intellectual<br />specialist, And so, Sir, believing those things, as you know<br />I do, I have great pleasure in being here and, woollen robes or<br />no woollen robes, I go through with my task and I declare this<br />place open.</p>
