PRIME MINISTER<br />
E. O. E PROOF ONLY<br />
MICHAEL SCHILDBERGER 3LO 8.30 AM, TUESDAY 9 OCTOBER 1984<br />
PM Good morning Michael<br />
Well you've done it. Decdetber 1<br />
PM Yes Michael, well it shouldn't come as a surprise, I made<br />
it clear that I would make the announcement as soon as I made up<br />
my mind. I made up my mind finally during last week, I wanted to<br />
wait until the return of the Governor General, Sir Ninian Stevens<br />
he returned yesterday afternoon he was gracious enough to agree to<br />
meet me an hour after he returned, he acceded to my request znd<br />
I immediately announced at the House. Thats the sort of att. tude<br />
that I made clear would be adopted and I have done what I said I<br />
would do.<br />
MS You could have let him ux" pack his bags.<br />
PM Oh well he has people to do that, he had been contacted<br />
by phone earlier in the day, so he wasn't entirely surprised when<br />
he was told that I ianted to see ' him.<br />
MS Will you ask Neville Wran to keep a lower profile than<br />
usual in this campaign?<br />
PM I will not and let me make it clear at the outset, I am not<br />
going to be one of those in Australian politics who engages either<br />
directly or indirectly in this smear and innuendo and guilt by<br />
association tactic and I would hive thought that those engagiad in<br />
or commentating on politics should have learnt their lesson in recent:<br />
weeks that that sort of tactic doesn't pay dividends. Mr Wran will<br />
as far as I am concerned adopt te same sort of role as he did last<br />
more </p>
<p>cont<br />
time. He will introduce me at the official launching of the campaign<br />
and then he will get on with the business of running the state of<br />
NSW, I and those around me will get on with the business of running<br />
the Federal campaign.<br />
MS Now I know it is up to the Senate to make its own decisions<br />
but will you want it to continue with the enquiry into Mr Justice<br />
Murphy? PM Well thats its business, there are conflicting legal opinions<br />
about the Senate and its Committees once an election is called. I'm<br />
not intervening in that, thats a iatter for decision by the Senate.<br />
MS Sen. Button said on this programme yesterday, he thought the<br />
remark by Neville Wran in regard to Clarrie Briese to have been<br />
unfortunate, do you agree?<br />
PM Well that's a fair comment, I however have been concerned to<br />
avoid what people have tried to do to latch onto that comment in<br />
respect of which there can be judoements as to its appropriateness<br />
The people have tried to take that comment and then broaden it into<br />
some comment about Mr Wran's integrity generally. That's what I'm<br />
not going to have a bar of. I accept 4'-the arguments as to whether<br />
it was wise or not wise to say it. But what I was concerned to do<br />
is that to say and to say operily to the Australian people I<br />
have not had one single piece of ? vidence since I have been Prime<br />
Minister which goes to the integrity, the honesty of Mr Wran and util<br />
unless and I don't expect to get tt. But until and unless yepttiuch<br />
evidence I am not going to be involved in any way, directly or indirectly<br />
in character assasinations. This: country is paying to high a price<br />
already for the emergence from a 4esperate Opposition of those tactics.<br />
more..... </p>
<p>I am going to do my best to discourage it as a feature of Australian<br />
Political life.<br />
14 S Did you tell Neville Wran that perhaps he shouldn't have<br />
made that remark about Clarrie Briese?<br />
PM4 I haven't spoken to Nevilie Wran since he made his comment.<br />
MS I thought you had about the fact that you supported him. I<br />
thought you had a discussion withy him. That was reported.<br />
PM You asked me if I had spoken to him since he made this<br />
comment?<br />
MS YES, That is what I am reterring to.* You haven't?<br />
PM Well how many times do I have to tell, you? I haven't spoken<br />
to him since he made that comment'l<br />
MS Well I accept that, its just that I heard a report....<br />
PM You're a bit slow taking the point, 3: said it quito'clearly<br />
Michael that and I would have thought it would have saved a lot<br />
of time if I didn't have to say something clearly more than once.<br />
MS Prime Minister, Sen Button also said an enquiry into majortax<br />
changes would get under way n~ xt year, but then its possible<br />
II<br />
you might introduce say a new caoital gains tax, death duties# or<br />
even VAT. Would you rule any of them out?<br />
PM I would think that the ' in the wealth tax area, thats<br />
unlikely. Let me make it clear that what Sen Button said was merelly<br />
saying what's been said many times over the last few months and that<br />
is that, and its common ground beirween our opposition and ourselves<br />
that there needs to be a wide ran~ ing review of? the tax system In<br />
Australia. No-one, no-one in poli. tics or in economic or financt.<br />
analysis would suggest that we haVe got the perfect tax system. What<br />
distinguishes. the opposition fromnus of course is two'things, we<br />
more * f~ 44j </p>
<p>4 cont<br />
will be doing it and not them, but secondly that we believe in the,<br />
processes of consultation and cooperation and seeking consensus,<br />
I've already started that over a period of several months and the<br />
Economic Planning Advisory Council, talking with the representatives<br />
of business, trade unions, welfare organisations to see if we can<br />
work our way towards some sort of general agreement about the new<br />
thrust that ought to be adopted but I am going to widen that approach<br />
after the election, we won't just do it though EPAC we'll try and<br />
talk through the community as widely as we can and see what the<br />
community believes is the best way for individuals and groups and<br />
companies to pay some portion of their resources to government so<br />
that government on behalf of the community can deliver the sorts<br />
of services, in defence ande s8 iat the community wants. Now<br />
that's essentially what taxation reform should be about. To try and<br />
get the community to say this is how we want our resources in part to .<br />
go to government, so that you, golernment can do the sorts of things<br />
that we the community want. Now that will be a long and thoroughgoing<br />
process. As I say, we will be distinguished from our opponents<br />
by not seeking to impose change but to develop a consensus about<br />
desirable change.<br />
MS'.... When you say thats a long process, do anticipate that there<br />
will be some results next year? In other words would you begin<br />
making changes?<br />
PM all those processes of consultation and trying to get<br />
community consensus would enable the thing to be finalised next<br />
year, I'm not sure. r. 1<br />
more..... i " V y<br />
W i </p>
<p>cont<br />
MS Taking a couple of particulars, I mean you have spoken<br />
in the past about extending the capital gains tax. Do you<br />
still hold that view?<br />
PM I said that I believe that the capital gains tax could be<br />
part, would probably be part of an overall tax system in the same<br />
way as the Liberal Party has said" it in their official pronouncements<br />
recently, of their Economic Commi4tee Report in the press recently<br />
from New South Wales, saying the ame thing. But I'm not opening<br />
or closing options at this stage, , any more than the Liberal Party<br />
would I think, There is a whole range of issues that should be<br />
looked at, the capital gains tax is not something that you say,<br />
yes, we want a capital gains tax, ' you have to ask is it a part of<br />
an attempt to stamp out tax avoidance. One of the arguments that is<br />
used by many commentators in favour of a capital gains tax is that.<br />
the absence of a capital gains tac is one of the reasons why tax<br />
avoidance has been so rampant until we started effectively to move<br />
in many directions. While you haven't got a capital gains tax,<br />
some commentators will argue, it will always offer one avenue of<br />
tax avoidance. But to talk about capital gains tax and just to<br />
say it doesn't really convey anything. For instance, in any capital<br />
gains tax the family home is nevet includeO, you have got to take<br />
account of inflation, you've got o take into account losses offsetting<br />
gains, so there is a whole lot oi things that you would want the<br />
community generally to be talking' about, when we are looking at<br />
taxation reform, including whethet they want that sort of element<br />
in a comprehensive tax system.<br />
MS Does this mean though tha you'll be going into this election<br />
without being able to spell out the specifics in the tax area?<br />
more j a I ! Irk a'fll/ l ,, l </p>
<p>cont<br />
PM On the contrary, I'll be 4aying to the people what I have<br />
been saying all along the very specific thing that we'll be<br />
going to the community, we'll be involving them in an analysis of<br />
of tax. If on the contrary the, our opponents want to say that they<br />
are not going to consult the comm4nity that they have their reports<br />
which, for instance, say that the capital gains tax is an inevitable<br />
part of tax change and they are just going to use their back room<br />
boys to say yes this this this and this... well they can say<br />
that if they like.<br />
MS Yes but doesn't it really mean though that we'll be going into<br />
the election not really knowing what you'll be doing straight after<br />
the election in that area. Other rhan seeking our view.<br />
PM Well, yes, and I'll have he record on my side because in<br />
February and March of last year I said to the Australian People<br />
we don't believe that we have got all wisdom I'll be calling the<br />
people of Australia together and their representatives to join with<br />
us in trying to work out what is the best way to go. The Australian<br />
people put their trust in me and that aproach and its worked, because<br />
we've moved this economy around from being zero growth to being the<br />
fastest growing economy in the world. Its not just because we have<br />
into<br />
good ideas, we took the Australian people 4A our confidence and<br />
joined them with us in the policy making approach. So when I say<br />
that this time I will be on a very, very good record.<br />
MS Do you plan another economic summit soon after the election?<br />
PM I haven't got an economic summit as such specifically in mind.<br />
What I have got in mind is to continue the process of consultation<br />
not merely through the Economic Planning Advisory Council which<br />
is, if you like a mini summit concept, on a statutory basis with<br />
business, large and small, the trade unions, local government<br />
4 J. 112ea~^^^^ </p>
<p>cont<br />
state government, welfare organisations, farmers represented on<br />
EPAC will be continuing the consultation there, but I will try to<br />
widen that out further to bring a$ much of the community into the<br />
discussion on this matter as I possibly can. You see it seems to<br />
be implicit in your question thatipeople don't like that sort of<br />
approach.. MS No, not at all. Why would you get that impression?<br />
PM You play the tape<br />
MS Well thats not my f'm asking you if you are going to<br />
have another economic summit?<br />
PM Well to go to the election with the people not knowing what<br />
you are going to do, as though thats something not proper....<br />
MS Oh right. The prices ncomes accord is to be renegotiated<br />
In what areas do you expect changq?<br />
I don't see any substantial changes involved that make sense<br />
for people to review a working arrangement, but I think that the<br />
prices and incomes accordÃ¸ hich the business community also regard<br />
itself as part now, and I want to pay great tribute to the organised<br />
business community because they were, If you like confronted in<br />
February, March of last year with an accord that had been worked out<br />
between the then Labor Party in Opposition and the Trade Union Movement.<br />
They came into the summit and they said, well now we regard ourselves<br />
as partners in this approach and r give them very very great tribute<br />
for that. So any if you like, reviewing of the working of the prices<br />
and incomes accord will not simply' be with the Trade Union Movement<br />
it will be with the business community as well.<br />
MS Prime Minister, you talk o your successes understandably,<br />
particularly the improvement in the economy and the feeling of<br />
more ' I<br />
l </p>
<p>8 cont<br />
consensus PM I'm sorry I don't want to be rude but, I, I really do<br />
want to emphasise that it is just'my successes, or the governments<br />
I'm not just engaging in rhetorics, because you'll recall that<br />
I said<br />
MS I'm not disputing it<br />
PM No, no, but I really do want you to understand that I've said<br />
that all the question of economic recovery and growth depends on<br />
the first thing national reconciliation. Thats where tribute has got<br />
to be paid, not just to government, but to the people themselves,<br />
through their organisations. Its our success not my success.<br />
MS Well obviously it has got to be seen partly as yours and<br />
the question that I was leading uO to why we talk of your successes,<br />
what do you see as you major mist kes in your first term as Prime<br />
Minister? PM Well I think on the question of the assets test I deliberately<br />
came out and said, well look we noed to do this differently because<br />
this was something new in its approach, and in the first concept we<br />
tried to get an over-all value which included people's houses. Now<br />
the more I looked at that, the more I could see that that wasn't<br />
right that you had to exclude the home and I didn't then try and<br />
do what a lot of politicians do s4y oh well because I made this<br />
decision in the first place, its right, I conceded that that was not<br />
the right approach and the home s ould be excluded.<br />
MS You presumably, would not like to relive the Coombe affair<br />
either? PM Well, what I would not wart to relive is circumstances which<br />
made it necessary but look, there . you have got some implication that<br />
I would have done that differently. I do not count that as a mistake<br />
~ ore j Q^
</p><p>9. cont<br />
I have made it quite clear that if the samne circumstances arose<br />
and I had the benefit of hindsight that action would be the course<br />
of action taken again. But T would hope that that would never<br />
arise again.<br />
MS Just finally, we have just seen and heard Ronald Reagan<br />
tell the American People that he Pias instructed his staff to raise<br />
matters with him in terms of their moral value for the good of the<br />
people, never to discuss such issues in political terms is that<br />
the way you do it?<br />
PM I ' m not quite sure, I mean I didn't see that. Put it to<br />
me again, that<br />
MS He wants his staff to come up with issues purely for their,<br />
moral value and for the good of the people and disregard or disecount<br />
and doesn't want to hear about the political difficulties that inight<br />
occur or otherwise.<br />
PM Mmb well I just don't quiti:-understand this aparent clear<br />
* dividing line you can draw betweeh moral issues and political issues.<br />
MS Well is it or isn't it goi. ng to win votes?<br />
Mm<br />
MS Is it or isn't it going to win votes? His argument is that<br />
he-doesn't care about whether it is going to win votes as long as<br />
its right for the people.<br />
PM Well, if thats what you are saying then I'm one with him.<br />
I would've thought the whole of m j career has shown that I call it<br />
as it is. I don't wet my finger Lnd hold it up and say oh what<br />
is this going to do? is this going to make you more popular or<br />
less popular? I've consistently and sometimes against the advice of<br />
those close to me taken positions even if its meant that there might<br />
be some immediate disadvantage. PIaving said. that, all people in<br />
more... </p>
<p>cont<br />
politics and political leadership' are naturally enough going to<br />
look at issues in some sense as to whether it is going to be a<br />
political disaster or not. I mean no-one in politics and positions<br />
of leadership totally ignore political implications but I think<br />
there are points in your career, where you have to deal with issues<br />
and say well, it might be easier to go that way and people might<br />
understand it better, but thats n9t the right thing to do. So you<br />
do what is the right thing.<br />
MS Are you excited about the forthcoming campaign?<br />
PM I enjoy campaigns, yes. i<br />
MS On Nationwide last night, you left open the possibility<br />
of a debate with Andrew Peacock. : Australian Prime Ministers<br />
have always shied away from such a situation.<br />
PM Oh personally I don't worry about debating Mr Peacock, but<br />
I must say that his behavoir has been so apalling and has fallen<br />
from proper standards of relationship in personal terms that I have<br />
i<br />
tO consider whether in fact I sho41d deal with him in that way.<br />
But I have made no decision about it<br />
MS But he is the alternate Ptime Minister.<br />
PM Well that is not what his own party is saying the argument is<br />
already shaping up on the non-Labor side of politics, this is an<br />
argument between Mr Peacock and his and a series of challenges<br />
lead by Mr Howard. Thats already very much what this campaign is seen<br />
as in many parts of the non-laborI camp.<br />
MS John Howard says that thatO a good tactic of yours.<br />
PM Well all I can say is that Mr Peacock's supporters have<br />
in the last few days fairly assidously tried to undermine Mr<br />
Howard, so but that's their problem not mine, good luck to them..<br />
MS Prime Minister thank you for joining me this morning and I, m<br />
more U *' th I! F' F' I'<br />
' A </p>
<p>11.... cont<br />
sure we'll talk again during the ' Campaign.<br />
PM Good Michael, its been good talking to you and I'll certainly<br />
look forward to talking to you again.<br />
ENDS L I </p>
