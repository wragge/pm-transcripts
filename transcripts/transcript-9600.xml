PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
KEIO UNIVERSITY, TOKYO THURSDAY, 25 MAY 1995<br />
It Is a very great pleasure to be here at one of Japan's most eminent<br />
academic Institutions. I thank Keio University both for its kind Invitation<br />
to speak and for the honour which has been bestowed on me today.<br />
I am very much aware of the role that Kelo University has played In<br />
Japan's history. Its fame parallels that of Its founder, Yuklchi Fukuzawa,<br />
a man of remarkable vision who believed that Japan had nothing to fear<br />
and much to gain from being open to the world, and through education,<br />
economic development and modernisation, made an outstanding contribution to<br />
this country.<br />
Today, the University he founded continues to play an influential role In<br />
the life of modern Japan. I understand that about one In every five of<br />
Japan's Diet members and many senior business executives attended<br />
this University.<br />
I am pleased to see some of these illustrious Kelo graduates here today,<br />
and I look forward to meeting others during my visit among them MITI<br />
Minister, Mr Hashimoto, for whom I have a very warm personal regard.<br />
Keio University has strong ties with Australia. Its Australian Studies<br />
course is a constructive link In the relationship between Australia and<br />
Japan and a practical example of our mutual recognition that we must<br />
continue to broaden knowledge and understanding of each other.<br />
We would like to see the ties made stronger, and I will be doubly<br />
honoured by this occasion If In some way It serves to strengthen them.<br />
For all these reasons this seems an appropriate place to offer an<br />
Australian's view of modern Japan a very friendly Australian's view, I<br />
might say.<br />
It Is part of my privilege today to know that among this distinguished<br />
audience are some of the next generation of Japanese leaders. The<br />
young people here carry a share of the responsibility for Japan's future,<br />
and hence for the f uture of our f riendship.<br />
Today, In part, my remarks are addressed specifically to you.<br />
I want you to understand the significance and the magnitude of our<br />
relationship, the good It does now and Its potential for good. I want you<br />
to form an understanding of Australia and Australia's view of the region<br />
and the world. </p>
<p>However, the weight of my remarks must be directed to the older<br />
members of the audience. This is where the weight of responsibility fails<br />
as It always does, In every country on the present generation of<br />
leaders. Ultimately the future depends on their capacity and willingness<br />
to renew their vision.<br />
This visit my third to Japan in three years occurs against the<br />
backdrop of the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Pacific War.<br />
The Second World War brought vast suffering and destruction to the<br />
peoples of the Asia-Pacific. Millions died, Including 2.4 million<br />
Japanese. More than 17,000 Australians died, nearly half of them as<br />
prisoners of war.<br />
We should not forget these things or fail to reflect upon the reasons for<br />
them not to keep an old animosity alive, but to strengthen the<br />
foundations of understanding on which friendships are built.<br />
We ignore history at our peril. I don't believe we can deliver a secure<br />
future to our young people without coming to grips with the realities of<br />
our past. That Is a lesson I think we are learning, In other contexts, In<br />
Australia. I am encouraged to hear that Japanese students are also beginning to<br />
learn more about the war. It is knowledge which will serve them well:<br />
and it will serve Japan well as this new generation takes on the<br />
responsibility for the future.<br />
In particular, It will help as Japan seeks acceptance and legitimacy for<br />
leadership in the region a status which Is In every practical sense<br />
Japan's due.<br />
I said on another occasion that among the countries of our region " a<br />
common awareness of the history we share will strengthen the basis of<br />
trust and cooperation between us." I am no less convinced of that now.<br />
That Is why I think that, on this anniversary of the end of the war in the<br />
Pacific, Japan can make a very substantial contribution to the region's<br />
future If, as you decide upon the way forward, you also decide to<br />
confront the past.<br />
Learning the right lessons from the past Is, of course, the essential task.<br />
I believe the lesson Is openness.<br />
The global economy becomes a more and more pervasive fact of life.<br />
The revolution in Information technology and communications speeds<br />
that process while reaching Into all our lives.<br />
Today we might be forgiven for thinking that openness is not a path we<br />
can chos to take, but rather one we are being forced down. And, If we<br />
take that view, we might easily take it as a corollary that the national<br />
Imperative Is resistance that we must close our shutters and protect<br />
both our Industries and our cultural differences.<br />
I don't take this view. I think the Internationalisatlon of economies and<br />
the revolution In telecommunications offer unprecedented opportunities,<br />
not only for business but for cultural expression and creativity. </p>
<p>It puts a premium on our cultural differences. It encourages cultural<br />
definition and renewal. With such a rich and famously resilient culture<br />
and such a strong sense of Identity, It therefore seems to me that Japan<br />
has little to fear and everything to gain from an open, pluralist regional<br />
and world environment.<br />
The option certainly remains to turn inwards and shut out the world but<br />
it was always a poor option, and It Is a worse one now.<br />
It Is the option Australia took for years. For generations we Isolated<br />
ourselves behind high tariff walls and racially based Immigration<br />
policies. We looked through a narrow window on the world which<br />
afforded a view of little more than the country in whose Empire we had<br />
once been a colony.<br />
Long after we became a nation we continued to look to there for our<br />
political, economic and cultural sustenance.<br />
We Australians were delivered an enormously rich British and European<br />
heritage and the best of It we will always cherish and maintain but when<br />
we began to lift our heads and looked to Asia and the Pacific we saw<br />
how much more was open to us.<br />
We saw how much more there was to being Austraiian.<br />
This awareness of the region has been a major factor obliging us to<br />
realise that economically and culturally, we have to be open. And that<br />
we have to change. Indeed It was our awareness of Asian rates of<br />
growth which more than anything else propelled us in the eighties into a<br />
decade of radical economic reform.<br />
We have pulled down the tariff wall, floated our currency, deregulated<br />
our financial markets and restructured our Industries.<br />
In short we have done the hard things we had to do if we were going to<br />
succeed In the world and give new generations of Australians a chance<br />
In the future.<br />
There have been great rewards life-saving rewards.<br />
Our productivity and competitiveness have dramatically improved In the<br />
past decade.<br />
Our culture has been enriched by new waves of migration, including<br />
from Asia one half of our Immigrants each year come from Asian<br />
countries and by vastly Increased awareness of other societies.<br />
From our diversity has come strength. Australia Is a rich multicultural<br />
society, a much more worldly one and a peaceful one.<br />
The arts have flourished: exposure to the world has stimulated them and<br />
with that we have seen a reappraisal of who we are, a redefining of our<br />
national Identity.<br />
At the same time we have begun to confront difficult truths about our<br />
own past. The dispossession of Australia's Indigenous peoples and the </p>
<p>destruction and brutality which accompanied It are notorious facts of our<br />
history. In the past two years we have begun to set a few of the wrongs right.<br />
Our courts have acknowledged the claims of Indigenous Australians to<br />
land. And the Australian Government has responded by legislating to<br />
protect those rights and to compensate Aboriginal Australians from<br />
whom native title has Irrevocably passed.<br />
In seeking reconciliation with indigenous Australians we are reconciling<br />
ourselves with the past and, for all the legal and political turmoil It has<br />
brought, I believe it Is making us stronger.<br />
As the Japanese people well know, the process of change Is rarely easy<br />
and never painless. But nothing Is so rewarding as a hard decision well<br />
made. Change can be exhilarating as well as painful.<br />
We have a lot more to do in Australia, but with such recent measures as<br />
massive Improvement In our savings position through a new national<br />
superannuation policy, the implementation of a national competition<br />
policy, and a huge investment In training and education, we are doing it.<br />
We are seeing the nation fundamentally re-shaped and re-oriented: reshaped<br />
as a modern, multicultural society and a diverse, productive and<br />
competitive economy; and re-oriented towards the countries of the<br />
region In which we live and where we know our future so substantially<br />
Ilies. For several years now, Japan like other developed nations Including<br />
Australia has been faced with a complex range of economic, social and<br />
political challenges.<br />
As a friend and partner of Japan, Australia has a close and sympathetic<br />
Interest In how Japan responds to these challenges.<br />
While the process is some way from complete, Japanese politics and<br />
society and the Japanese economy are undergoing an historic<br />
transf ormation.<br />
Political debate in Japan has Intensified In recent times. Some may see<br />
this as a sign of uncertainty and a fissure breakdown In the cohesion of<br />
Japanese society.<br />
But I am firmly convinced It is a healthy development. Perhaps even a<br />
necessary development.<br />
Similarly, Japan's economy is gradually opening up to the world and to<br />
the imperative of structural change, promoted by its own success which<br />
Is reflected In the value of Its currency.<br />
Japan has identifiled the challenges it must confront to remain a dynamic<br />
mature economy in areas such as the taxation structure, the<br />
agricultural sector, reducing government regulations and understanding<br />
the key Ingredient of ministerial Initiative and political authority. </p>
<p>Japan has also been feeling out a role in regional and International<br />
affairs which will better align its responsibilities with Its economic power<br />
in the United Nations, In APEC and through its generous development<br />
assistance. As a friend, Australia warmly welcomes these developments.<br />
And as a friend, we feel we can encourage indeed urge Japan to<br />
sustain the momentum of reform<br />
Only a robust and responsive political system which promotes political<br />
accountability and Is capable of generating genuine political leadership<br />
can make vital decisions of reform.<br />
We are confident Japan can build on the foundations of political reform<br />
it has laid over the last few years to establish both healthy public debate<br />
about policy ideas, and a bureaucracy which Is not only responsive to<br />
government leadership but capable of acting creatively with Ministers.<br />
Political parties have to work hard to make themselves relevant to the<br />
needs and the aspirations of the Japanese people especially young<br />
people like those at this university. Cynicism about the political process<br />
is not unique to Japan, but It Is corrosive wherever it occurs:<br />
It dims a country's vitality and diminishes its faith in itself.<br />
I have no doubt that Japan's young people want to make a contribution,<br />
just as I know Australia's do. It Is not good enough to meet their doubts<br />
with cynicism of our own, or to attempt to sell them stale goods from<br />
another age.<br />
It Is Incumbent on our generation, if not to f Ire their Imagination, then at<br />
least to give them an environment where the Imagination can flourish<br />
where the future can be imagined.<br />
We have no greater responsibility than to give our young people reason<br />
for confidence and optimism. Nothing short of that will release the<br />
human potential on which the future depends.<br />
Above all, it Is crucial that Japan's political and economic leadership<br />
itself Is Infused with Imagination. to Imagine something better and to<br />
craft the economic and social reforms which will make it a reality.<br />
Success or failure In this will not only determine whether the Japanese<br />
people are able to fully enjoy the high standard of living that they have<br />
worked so hard to achieve: it will also determine whether Japan lives up<br />
to Its full potential as a major financial and trading hub within the global<br />
and East Asian economies.<br />
Japan cannot rely on other countries to fix its exchange rate problems.<br />
Only Japan can make the hard decisions needed to push ahead<br />
vigorously with deregulation In order to release the energy It needs to<br />
prosper as a mature economy.<br />
Only Japan can tackle the structural problems which obstruct better land<br />
utilisation and control the amount of savings that Is Invested In housing<br />
and other social infrastructure. </p>
<p>Australia, like all Japan's foreign partners, wants Japan to engage In<br />
large-scale deregulation and economic reform because we know It will<br />
Improve our access to your markets.<br />
But the main stimulus for reform of this magnitude cannot come from<br />
abroad. It must come from a conviction within Japan itself that this Is the best<br />
way to break out of the current cycle, and the best way to improve the<br />
economic and social well-being of Japan and its people.<br />
I have no doubt that the wisdom which underlies Japan's phenomenal<br />
success In the past 50 years will prevail again; that the people<br />
themselves who are the source of Japan's great strength will<br />
accommodate the change and embrace it.<br />
Japan has one of the best educated, most innovative and hardestworking<br />
populations in the world.<br />
It Is no less a strength of yours In the present circumstances that the<br />
Japanese people are committed to democracy; or that they are<br />
generous enough to make Japan one of the world's largest aid donors.<br />
And their stoicism is legendary I need only mention the dignified<br />
resolve with which the people of Kobe have set about rebuilding their<br />
city and their lives since the terrible earthquake.<br />
Knowing this about the Japanese people, no one can ever doubt that<br />
they will make these crucial reforms and profit by them.<br />
Some argue that Japan's social and cultural traditions stand In the way<br />
of far-reaching political and economic reform. I am sure that this Is not<br />
the case. I have no doubt that, on the contrary, Japan's traditional<br />
values and Identity will be a source of strength In seeing through<br />
reforms. So will the national cohesion, that sense of national purpose and<br />
community for which Japan Is renowned.<br />
Japan's sheer economic weight should also provide Japan and Indeed<br />
the world with cause for confidence about Japan's future. We hear a<br />
lot about the growth rates of Asia's emerging economies.<br />
But It Is important to remember that, at today's exchange rates, Japan's<br />
economy still constitutes over 70 per cent of the whole East Asian<br />
economy. An economy of that size will maintain its Impact on the global<br />
economy and continue to command global attention and respect.<br />
Japan has always been and remains a driving force behind the Asia-<br />
Pacific region's economic Integration, It remains for many countries the<br />
model. A heavy responsibility accompanies this Influence: Japan's weight In the<br />
International economy means that policy decisions taken here have farreaching<br />
effects. </p>
<p>It also means that Japan's reform efforts should enjoy the support of Its<br />
friends in the international community. Far from resenting Japan's<br />
economic success, I am sure the world wants to see it continue. It Is a<br />
balanced equation: Japan needs the world, and the world needs Japan.<br />
That is why I am concerned about the present trade dispute between<br />
Japan and the United States. This is not an easy issue and I understand<br />
some of the frustrations on both sides.<br />
But I would urge both sides to look beyond their present differences and<br />
consider the ramifications not just for themselves and for smaller<br />
trading countries like Australia which stand to get caught In the crossfire<br />
but, more Importantly, for the entire Asia-Pacific region.<br />
The US-Japan relationship is a linchpin of regional stability and<br />
prosperity. The US-Japan Security Treaty Is absolutely fundamental to<br />
the security of the Pacific and more widely.<br />
Quite simply, no-one can afford to allow bilateral trading differences<br />
between these key Asia-Pacific partners to jeopardise any part of<br />
political and security structure of our region or to imperil the sense of<br />
regional community which is now emerging.<br />
The last countries to countenance this should be Japan and the United<br />
States themselves.<br />
And, of course, no one can afford the economic consequences of a<br />
prolonged Japan-US trade dispute.<br />
I believe these are key reasons for Japan and Australia's shared<br />
commitment to APEC as the primary vehicle for regional economic cooperation<br />
and Integration and, In particular, to implementing the APEC<br />
leaders' historic agreement In Bogor last year to free regional trade and<br />
investment. APEC Is, In many respects, tailor-made to meet Japan's Interests. A<br />
former Japanese Prime Minister told me that Japan of all countries<br />
stood to benefit the most from APEC. I would now go further and say<br />
that Japan, for Its own economic and strategic interests, has to ensure<br />
that APEC succeeds.<br />
APEC provides a means for Japan to manage its trade problems with the<br />
United States In a way which will strengthen the International trading<br />
System.<br />
APEC provides a regional framework In which governments can take the<br />
hard decisions on economic deregulation and structural change.<br />
Because this growth will always be able to show something In return a<br />
reciprocal benefit.<br />
This will help to ensure further opening of markets and continued high<br />
growth rates in the region and thus enable structural adjustment to take<br />
place In a multilateral context where everyone is a winner.<br />
In a period when there seems to be no enthusiasm In Europe or the<br />
United States for further global trade liberalisation, APEC Is the only<br />
body In the world which can act as a catalyst for a new global round. </p>
<p>In helping to meet these objectives, APEC provides a multilateral<br />
framework, bringing Japan together with the United States and China in<br />
a way which emphasises their common interests in regional stability and<br />
prosperity. APEC can multilateralise the interests of these three great<br />
states in the Asia-Pacific.<br />
Japan has an unprecedented chance to take the reins of leadership<br />
when it chairs the APEC leaders' meeting in Osaka. If it siezes the<br />
chance it will secure its interests.<br />
It is essential that we agree in Osaka on a comprehensive action plan for<br />
implementing the historic decisions we took in Bogor last year.<br />
This should, in my view, not only map out in as much detail as possible<br />
how we each plan to meet our free trade and investment commitments<br />
by 2010 or 2020, but also include concrete steps to address<br />
impediments to trade and investment in the APEC region.<br />
Our business communities now rightly expect APEC now to deliver real<br />
results. This meeting points to a future in which all countries have a common<br />
interest in peace and stability. Above all else, it demonstrates how far<br />
the region has come in the 50 years since the war ended indeed how<br />
far it has come in the last five years.<br />
You can be assured of Australia's full and active support on this.<br />
Australia has been delighted to play a role in the creation of APEC and<br />
its transformation into an executive body without parallel In the region.<br />
Australia also has confidence in Japan's capacity to take on a more<br />
active independent international role beyond the region.<br />
However great the temptations to resist the tides of globalisation and<br />
economic integration, the logic of Japan's economic stature, its central<br />
place in the international trading system, its importance as a source of<br />
investment and technology and its post-war record as one of the most<br />
democratic and stable countries in Asia, make it inevitable that Japan's<br />
international role will grow.<br />
It is for that reason that Australia firmly supports permanent Japanese<br />
membership of the United Nations Security Council.<br />
For while Australia sees Japan remaining a central player in Asia, we see<br />
Japan's links outside Asia particularly with the United States, but also<br />
with Europe as fundamental to its future role. As a trading and<br />
investing economy, Japan has long recognised its critical interest in the<br />
maintenance of an open international trading system.<br />
Japan will remain pivotal to regional economic integration. But it will<br />
also be a vital force for continuing global economic integration.<br />
So Japan can be confident that its friends want it to play an important<br />
role in the world.<br />
And those of you here today who have personal experience or<br />
understanding of the unique partnership between our countries will<br />
know that Australia is one of the best friends Japan has. </p>
<p>It Is entirely appropriate to enthuse about the bilateral relationship<br />
between Japan and Australia, but we cannot take for granted what we<br />
have achieved together over the last fifty years.<br />
During this visit I hope to highlight this unique and dynamic partnership.<br />
But having emphasised the value of our relationship, I also want to make<br />
people think hard about what we have to do to sustain Its momentum<br />
and vitality.<br />
This demands that we build on the traditional complementarities<br />
between our economies and find new areas for prof itable co-operation<br />
as our economies evolve.<br />
There Is no doubt about Japan's critical Importance to the Australian<br />
economy. Japan was the earliest Influence on Australia's reorientation<br />
towards Asia. In the late 1940s and early 1950s Japan took just 5 per<br />
cent of Australia's exports.<br />
By the mid-i 960s Japan had become Australia's largest overseas<br />
market. Today Japan takes 25 per cent of our total exports.<br />
Today, Japan Is by far Australia's largest trading partner and Australia is<br />
Japan's third-largest source of Imports. Last year our exports to Japan<br />
were worth $ 16 billion.<br />
Bilateral Investment links between Australia and Japan have also been<br />
extremely important, particularly for Australia's economic development.<br />
Japanese Investment In Australia stands at just over $ 50 billion. And<br />
Japan is Australia's fourth largest destination for foreign investment.<br />
For its part, Australia has made a crucial contribution to Japan's<br />
industrialisation and economic advancement as a leading supplier of<br />
industrial raw materials and energy.<br />
We supply over half of Japan's coal Imports and a growing proportion of<br />
its LNG needs. Australia is the single largest supplier of Japan's non-oil<br />
energy needs. Australia, quite literally, has fueled Japan's post-war<br />
growth. But our trading relationship has expanded beyond Its traditional focus<br />
on raw materials and energy. As Japan exports more and more hightechnology<br />
manufactures and services, new complementaritles with<br />
Australia are emerging.<br />
Where once Australia just fed Japan's smelters and furnaces, we now<br />
increasingly feed Its people for example we supply 30 per cent of your<br />
beef consumption and are the largest supplier of your Imported dairy<br />
products. Last year, Australia supplied 183,000 tonnes of fresh rice of the highest<br />
quality to the Japanese market. The opening of this market was a very<br />
bold step for Japan, but because of the decline In your own farming<br />
population, a vital one.<br />
The Australian rice Industry among whose founders in the early years<br />
of this century was a visionary Japanese farmer named Jo Takasuka </p>
<p>will be a reliable supplier of fresh rice between Japan's own harvests.<br />
We want to build up this market.<br />
" Food security" Is an Issue which has preoccupied Japan for many years,<br />
and it Is an understandable concern.<br />
But it Is a term which has to be redefined by the changes taking place in<br />
Japan itself and by the realities of Interdependence In the global<br />
economy. Food security for Japan needs to embrace the concept of reliable<br />
suppliers of quality foods from non-Japanese sources. As the long<br />
record of our economic relationship shows, you can have no better<br />
partner In this than Australia. And it helps to have a partner with<br />
complementary seasons.<br />
Australia has become one of the most popular places for Japanese to<br />
holiday. In 1994, nearly 730,000 tourists came to Australia f rom Japan,<br />
and the Australian Tourist Commission estimates that more than one<br />
million Japanese will be visiting Australia annually by the year 2000.<br />
At the heart of the post-war expansion of Australia-Japan commercial<br />
relationship lies a dense web of person-to-person ties. These are<br />
essential to the future of our relationship. And there Is no better medium<br />
for their expansion than education.<br />
Australia now ranks behind only China and Korea ( and Japan itself) in<br />
the number of students studying the Japanese language. In 1990, 50 per<br />
cent more students were studying Japanese In Australia than In the<br />
United States, the United Kingdom and Canada combined. In 1993 more<br />
Australian year-12 students studied Japanese than any language other<br />
than English. And Australia is unique in the proportion of primary and<br />
high-school students studying Japanese.<br />
Moreover, there is lively exchange of students between the two<br />
countries. At the school level, Australia and Japan have exchanged<br />
more than 10,000 students.<br />
More Australians go to Japan to experience life in a Japanese secondary<br />
school than from any other country. And more than 4,000 Japanese<br />
students are studying In Australia at post-secondary level and above.<br />
Australia's hosting of the 2000 Summer Olympic Games and Japan's<br />
hosting of the 1998 Winter Olympic Games presents enormous new<br />
opportunities to build a new range of personal, sporting and commercial<br />
contacts between Australia and Japan.<br />
It Is fifty years since the war ended. The friendship which exists between<br />
us now was not then within the reach of anyone's imagination.<br />
That It has grown Into relationship of such strength is a tribute to<br />
Australians and Japanese who saw beyond the enmity and recrimination<br />
and the vast cultural gulf dividing us.<br />
There are always a few who see beyond the conventional wisdom of<br />
their own generation: people who see the wave forming well before it<br />
begins to break; who see necessity before it becomes oppressive and<br />
who have the conviction to confront It, the wit and skill to make a virtue </p>
<p>of it. People who, like the founder of this great university, do not fear<br />
change and welcome the future.<br />
We must leave the way clear for people of vision. We have to resist that<br />
conservative pressure which, with age and experience, tends to close<br />
the eyes and the minds of every generation. We have to keep our<br />
minds and our eyes open.<br />
This relationship of ours is the product of such a way of thinking. And<br />
that is how it will be sustained. Our friendship has been a source of<br />
immeasurable good for both our countries. It can be so for generations<br />
to come.<br />
We must never undervalue it, never take it for granted, never cease to<br />
encourage and expand it. We must remain open to each other and to<br />
the opportunities which exist for us.<br />
And we have to keep alive the faith and engagement of the young.<br />
This has been the role Keio University for a very long time. It is why Keio<br />
has been, and remains, such a vital part of Japan's modern history.<br />
And that is why I am so honoured by this occasion.<br />
