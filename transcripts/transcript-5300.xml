PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT WEDNESDAY, 19 MARCH, 1980<br />
PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED BY NEIL ADCOCK, 6PR, PERTH<br />
TELEPHONE INTERVIEW<br />
( QUESTIONS NOT AUDIBLE)<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
( Inaudible) problem can be undertaken and pursued on a national<br />
basis. The arrangements that we are making for co-operation<br />
with the States, the arrangements that we are making in the<br />
crime area for intelligence centres and all the rest it is<br />
setting this basic approach on a national level that really is<br />
the important thing. We are going to pursue that with all the<br />
vigour at our command. I would believe the State Governments<br />
will also._-<br />
Q uestion<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We have not got a costing on any of it yet. But, it is our<br />
intention to make it effective. It is too important. The<br />
problem of drugs is a threat to the kind of society we have<br />
and want to have. Governments, individuals, families, cannot<br />
be complacent about it. If there is a cost to combatting it<br />
properly, then Governments are going to have to meet that.<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
I think much more so now than might have been 15 or 20 years ago.<br />
I believe there is better education in the schools of the dangers<br />
and drug education for kids. I think parents are-aware of it,<br />
although there is often an attitude it can happen, but it will<br />
not happen in my family. I have known of tragic circumstances<br />
where parents have come to realise that their children are<br />
addicts, months or even years after the problem started. It is<br />
very tragic to see that happening. It needs to be treated as<br />
a very real danger. Parents need to stay as close as possible<br />
to their own kids to minimise the possibility of that sort of<br />
thing happening.<br />
Question </p>
<p>6-P-2 -<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
When you are -linking alcohol with road accidents and this sort<br />
of thing, governments are now-generally taking a much tougher<br />
attitude to it. I am all for that. I think Australia has been<br />
behind some other countries in the toughness of its laws in<br />
relation to alcohol and driving. I am very glad to see that we<br />
are now catching-up and that the penalties are very severe; and<br />
they ought to be.<br />
Question Prime Minister-<br />
Well, the Government did take some decisions about that report<br />
that are going to be announced very shortly. I think describing<br />
Australia as an intoxicated society is really a bit hard.<br />
Most Australians are not intoxicated and go about their business<br />
and can take alcohol within proper limits and all the rest.<br />
So we need -to understand that while it is a danger, it is a danger<br />
for young people, it is a very real danger for a minority that<br />
cannot handle maybe not so much the problems of alcohol as the<br />
problems and difficulties that sometimes beset individuals in<br />
a modern society.,-Therefore, they start by going to an escape.<br />
We have to address ourselves to these particular directions.<br />
I am just putting in a defence for an Australian society which by<br />
and large I think is a pretty good one and a pretty healthy one.<br />
Question Prime Minister-<br />
We can pursue it, and if necessary we will. In addition to thiat<br />
of course there are other elements in this particular case in<br />
which it now appears, well, we now, that under the auspices of<br />
the. Arbitration Commission the company and the union came to an<br />
agreement in the absence of the small firm, in the absence of<br />
Mr. Laidely, which disposed of Mr. Laidely; denied him any rights<br />
to live, to survive, to work. We are looking at that very seriously<br />
indeed. That could well lead to amendments of the Trade Practices<br />
Act itself because we need to understand that on the question of<br />
refusal to supply a product to an individual or a company, that<br />
can be done if the refusal to supply is the individual action of<br />
a particular company. But if two companies agree to refuse to<br />
supply a product to a third party that would be against the Act.<br />
Here we h-ave a situation in-which it seems that AMOCO and a trade<br />
union have refused to supply. The question is whether that ought<br />
not to be an offence against the Trade Practices Act. We<br />
are looking at that very closely. Discussions have been takingplace<br />
last night and this morning. The Government is talking to<br />
oil company representatives this afternoon. While I do not see<br />
any quick solution to the totality of the problem I am hoping / 3<br />
6PR </p>
<p>6PR -3-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
that shortly the Government will be in a position to announce<br />
some initiatives in relation'to it.<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
There has been no response yet. They use Cockburn Sound<br />
occasionally for ships.-they have gone into harbours in<br />
Western Australia. This was a question of home porting, or<br />
base porting units that could be patrolling in the Indian Ocean<br />
over very, very long periods. If it is home porting, it would<br />
mean that families would also be going to live in the area.<br />
We said that if the United States wants to pursue this, as one<br />
of its options in upgrading its own military forces in the<br />
Indian Ocean area, then we will be very ready to listen to a<br />
proposition that they have put to us. It has not got any further<br />
than that yet. The United States has not yet come back to us<br />
in relation to it. Personally, I hope they do.<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
Two-fold. If wehave a defence alliance and if we believe in<br />
a common cause, we have to do something to defend it. It is not<br />
very good saying we are prepared to be defended but only by<br />
second-grade or outdated weapons. That would not make very much<br />
sense. I think people have to make up their minds in the widest<br />
sense what side they are on. There is no dotibt about Australia<br />
in my view. There is certainly no doubt about the Government<br />
and the great majority of the Australian people. Therefore, if<br />
we believe in a cause, we have to support it. I think it is<br />
worth noting that nearly all the countries of Europe, the<br />
United Kingdom, have facilities within them. They are nuclear<br />
facilities. We have not had such facilities in Australia.<br />
Facilities of that kind are not proposed. what is proposed<br />
is that ships might be able, if the Americans want-to respond to<br />
it, to use bases that we already have for home porting, or base<br />
porting as they call it as the Americans call it. If they<br />
want that, in terms of general free-world co-operation, I<br />
believe we should assist them to if we can.<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
I have not got a response to that yet. We have of course<br />
significantly upgraded general defences in Western Australia as<br />
a result of a statement made a month ago. That is going to mean </p>
<p>6PR 4<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
considerable improvements to facilities. It is going to mean<br />
home porting of our own ships-at Cockburn Sound before the<br />
end of the current defence period; the upgrading of Cockburn<br />
Sound and of Learmonth, and of other facilities in Western<br />
Australia. On a State-by-State basis, I think Western Australia<br />
might have come out of the new decisions of the Government<br />
with a greater upgrading of defence capacity than any other State.<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
Well, that is better not done by helicopters. I think that is<br />
better done by the fixed-wing aircraft. Over the last 18 months<br />
we have established much better surveillance right around the<br />
Australian coastline for that very purpose. I think those<br />
arrangements are working quite well.<br />
