PRIME _ MI STER<br />
FOR PBESS 20 MAY 1977<br />
'. rHE RE PBENDUM<br />
Tomor row is a day on which Australians can mak~ e sensible changes<br />
to the 77-year-old Federal Constitution. It is an opportunity<br />
to modernise the conistitution and reform it in a down-to-earth<br />
fashicon. IT urge all Australianrs to make the most of this opportunity by<br />
vot-ing Yes on all four questions.<br />
Four questions are being put to youi tomorrow, as a result of<br />
agreement reached in Hobart in October last year at; the<br />
Constitutional Convention. All1 political paxties in all<br />
Australian Governments, State and Federal, took part in, that<br />
Convention. There were 72 delegates from the States, 16 from the<br />
Feeteral Parliam~ ent and four from local goverriluents. There was<br />
overwhelming suipport for the principles behind the questions<br />
which are being put forward tomorrow,<br />
That Convention was a genuine attempt to achieve constitutional.<br />
reforni, on the basis of c:. onuon scnse and co-operation. The<br />
principles behind the four referendum questions were noncontroversial.<br />
The arguments in t-heir favour are simple and<br />
clear-cut. The arcluments against them are mnixed an~ d confused,<br />
basically because they are so wea-,.<br />
I regret that the spiirit. which motivated all delegates in Hobart<br />
is no longer present in some of them, but this does not alter the<br />
fact that tho proposals being mnade by the Commonwealth axe fair<br />
and reason~ able.<br />
They Yna} e good sense, and I believe that tomorrow the people of<br />
Auirt'ralia will ,-how that they too recoq. nise that these q~ uestions<br />
are a commonsenise approach to constitutional change.<br />
The four questions which are being put tomorrow are:<br />
That elections for the House of Representatives and<br />
the Senate rbouldd fa~ e* place' At' th-e ' s-ate' tine<br />
If this is not pa-. 4_ ed, there could be four Vederal elections<br />
over the next~ four yenys elections which the coutntry does<br />
not need or want. In Hiobart, this proposnl was stipported / by i '. 1 </p>
<p>-2<br />
by every' one of the 72 Statte del. egates Libera e, Labor<br />
and National country Party, Government and Oppo. s ition,<br />
every one of tEhe 16 Federal delegates from both Government<br />
and Opposition, and every one of the local government. I<br />
representativc~ c. They all saw it for what. it was a<br />
matter of simple common sense desiqIned to strengthen the<br />
Parliament as a whole and to enhance thbe authority of the<br />
Senate. Holding thc! House anud the Senate elections at<br />
-the same time means that the-parties must put forward<br />
policies applicable to all. States. For instance, no<br />
party could calculate on winning power by concentrating on<br />
the two major cities of Sydney and M'elbourne.<br />
' The second question is that, should a vacancy occur in the<br />
Senate through death or retirc-ent, the nominated replacement<br />
should be of thet same poli~ tic al p~ arty servang out th-e balance<br />
of the -full-term of the(. scmator lie is replacing.<br />
This was a convention for manty years in Australian politics.<br />
Again, it is a matter of plain fairness to ensure that a<br />
decision made by voters at elections is preserved. I<br />
The th-ird question is that elector-, in the Northern Territor,<br />
ann. Ca ital Terkitory shoIdae~ o~ i rfrnusYh<br />
other Australians.<br />
It is quite wrong that people in the Territories should be<br />
denied basic democratic rigihts, Referendums are counted<br />
in two parts. The votes of Teriitory rez-idents would be<br />
includpa in the overall Australian verdict, but not in ' that<br />
par-it of the count wh ich reqvuirfzes a mnajority in four<br />
of th-e six S-% tates In the year 1977, denyingq<br />
political rights to a section, of the Australian cormunity<br />
is sheer nonsense.<br />
The fourth question is that Hicih Court JudgesF shouldt retire<br />
at thc age of 710 and that a retirig j also be set for<br />
other Federal Judges.<br />
The -g1tates have retiring ages for their own -judges. it is<br />
only fair that after the age of 70 judges i~ n the Federal<br />
arena should pass the job on to yownger men.<br />
These proposals are-all desiqrpiea to enhance the-auithjo ty of the<br />
Senate and of the Parliament, The important distinction between<br />
these referendum questions and some referendums in the past is that<br />
there is absolutely no attempt to increasQ the power of the Central<br />
Government at the expense of the State Governmients.<br />
All these referendupas are designed to strenqthen the dcrnocratj<br />
institutions and enhance p) oitical stabi" Ilty i-n our country.<br />
' They would remove a means of manipulatinq the syst-em of prcoport. Jonal'<br />
representation as tool; place at the time of the Gair affair, / Th cy </p>
<p>3<br />
They will give millions of dollars in unnecessary separate<br />
Senate elections. They will give the Territory residents an<br />
elementary right which they should have had long ago. They<br />
do not in any way diminish the power and authority of the<br />
State Governments or of the Senate. They are fair, reasonable<br />
and sensible proposals.<br />
I believe they deserve your support, and I ask tomorrow for a<br />
Yes vote on all four questions. C
