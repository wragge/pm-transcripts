THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN EDUCATION<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
AT THE OPENING OF THE M. B. FLOOD SCIENCE BLOCK OF<br />
ST. PATRICK'S COLLEGE,.. PROSPECT VALE, TASMANIA<br />
SUNDAY 18 MARCH 1973<br />
There has never been any qualification about<br />
my Government s commitment to education. In my<br />
policy speech last November I promised that education<br />
would be the most rapidly growing sector of public<br />
spending under a Labor Government. We see it as the<br />
primary instrument for improving the quality of life<br />
of our people and promoting equality of opportunity<br />
for our children. Under previous Governments, education was<br />
one of the most neglected fields. It was an area for<br />
which Liberal Governments in the national Parliament<br />
accepted little or no responsibility. Whatever<br />
responsibility they accepted was grudging, tardy<br />
and partial. Our responsibility will be wholehearted,<br />
prompt and far-reaching. We are determined that<br />
education will no longer be used as a weapon to<br />
perpetuate privilege, inequality and division.<br />
We are determined that every child who embarks on his<br />
secondary education this year shall have the same opportunity<br />
as any other child of completing that education and<br />
advancing further. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Our approach to education has never been<br />
based on elitist, regional, sectarian or other<br />
discriminatory grounds. Our concern is for all<br />
children in all schools, whether Government, Catholic<br />
or otherwise independent. The debate in education<br />
is no longer whether schools should receive assistance<br />
from the National Government. That principle is<br />
now accepted. It was established in 1964 when the<br />
Liberal Government introduced its program of<br />
Commonwealth assistance for science blocks, under<br />
which this building was financed. It was<br />
fully accepted by our opponents in May last year<br />
when they announced some long-term but inadequate proposals<br />
for assistance to secondary schools. So the question of<br />
whether the National Government has a responsibility is<br />
no longer an issue. The debate now is about the scale<br />
and method of the national Government's involvement<br />
whether it should be piecemeal or thorough, selective<br />
or universal, arbitrary or planned, haphazard or co-ordinated.<br />
Our preference is clear: It is for universality, for<br />
planning, for co-ordination, and for generosity.<br />
Our aim is to ensure that all schools receive assistance<br />
according to their needs.<br />
There can be nothing but praise for the efforts<br />
of the poorer non-government schools, particularly<br />
those in the Catholic system, to provide their children<br />
with educational services of the highest standard.<br />
This is no easy task. Within the Catholic system, this<br />
college, of course, is one of the fortunate schools.<br />
The Christian Brothers have set a noted example of<br />
dedication and self-sacrifice in the cause of education.<br />
I pay my own tribute to the Rev. Brother Michael Flood,<br />
who gave 65 years of service to his Church as a Christian<br />
Brother, whose memory is esteemed in Catholic education<br />
circles throughout this country, and whose name is<br />
commemorated by the building we open today. </p>
<p>The educational system he served was<br />
founded on the principle that parents have a right to choose<br />
their children's education. But it is not enough to insist<br />
that parents have a right to choose. So they should and do.<br />
But the choice for all parents should be one between<br />
systems and philosophies of education, not between<br />
standards and opportunities. Too often under previous<br />
Governments the only choice was that given to a wealthy or<br />
privileged minority to choose a wealthier or more privileged<br />
school. We can never be content with over-crowded,<br />
under-staffed impoverished schools merely because a minority<br />
have a right to opt out of them.<br />
It is the Government's duty it is my Government's<br />
determination to see that the right of choice carries with<br />
it neither hardship for parents nor deprivation for children.<br />
After all, the parents of Catholic children have suffered as<br />
much as anyone from the old approach. The pupils of State<br />
and Catholic schools I do not in this context include<br />
St. Patrick's College have had less than half as good<br />
a chance as the pupils of other independent schools to gain<br />
Commonwealth secondary scholarships, and much less than half<br />
as good a chance of completing their secondary education.<br />
Throughout Australia only 4% of the pupils at<br />
Government schools and 7% at Catholic schools qualify for<br />
secondary scholarships. But 15% of the pupils at other<br />
independent schools qualify for them. Only three out of<br />
every 10 pupils at Government and Catholic schools reach<br />
the final year of secondary education, whereas at other<br />
non-government schools eight of every 10 reach the final<br />
year. No democratic government can accept this disparity.<br />
It is morally unjust, it is socially wasteful. To sell<br />
our children short today is to sell Australia short tomorrow. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
My Government has already begun to tackle the<br />
problems of inequality in education. We will adopt the same<br />
method to assist schools as previous Governments adopted to<br />
assist universities and colleges of advanced education.<br />
In December I wrote to a number of leading educationalists,<br />
including representatives of the Catholic system, inviting<br />
them to join an interim committee for a Schools Commission,<br />
under the chairmanship of Professor Karmel, which would<br />
examine and determine the needs of students in all schools.<br />
In due course a permanent Australian Schools Commission<br />
will be set up. Its reports will be published; its advice<br />
will form the basis for my Government's assistance to<br />
education. We will act quickly upon the recommendations of<br />
the interim committee. In answer to a question in<br />
Parliament last Tuesday,* I had this to say about the<br />
progress of the interim committee's work:<br />
" I have kept regularly in touch with<br />
my colleague the Minister for Education<br />
in regard to the deliberations of the<br />
interim committee. I have met the Chairman,<br />
Professor Karmel, on several occasions since it<br />
was appointed. It is expected that the interim<br />
committee's report will be made available as<br />
requested before the end of May. This will<br />
mean that it will be available in sufficient<br />
time to be considered at the Premiers Conference<br />
which should be held in June or maybe, if the<br />
House gets up early enough, even in May. In<br />
those circumstances the State Governments and the<br />
non-government school authorities will have ample<br />
opportunity to prepare for the 1974 scholastic<br />
year in the light of the additional funds which<br />
it is expected the Australian Government will<br />
make available for schools." </p>
<p>There is nothing unusual or even particularly<br />
radical in a system based on priority of needs. It is<br />
in fact rather simple and obvious. No company or enterprise<br />
in the world would allocate its resources in any other way.<br />
The Catholic education system itself determines its priorities<br />
according to what it conceives to be the needs of its<br />
children. Our aim is to avoid the old-fashioned system of<br />
ad hoc decisions for special grants which took no account<br />
of the long-term needs and planning requirements of the<br />
beneficiaries of those grants. Everywhere in the old system<br />
of grants one finds a pattern of disparity. If we look at<br />
the breakdown of grants for science facilities approved in<br />
1971 for the four years to June 1975 we find that some<br />
States emphasise the needs of Government schools over<br />
non-government schools, others give preference to nongovernment<br />
over government schools. South Australia is<br />
giving four times as much money under the science grants to<br />
government schools as to non-government schools $ 2,647,125<br />
against $ 663,525. Queensland is giving more money to nongovernment<br />
schools $ 3,323,020 than to government schools,<br />
who are to receive only $ 3,072,780. The science block<br />
program, the grants for libraries, and system of per<br />
capita grants approved by previous governments were<br />
far from adequate responses to the real needs of our children.<br />
They were not the solutions of a Government accepting<br />
its responsibilities: they were in fact devices for<br />
avoiding them. My Government has undertaken to continue in the<br />
current year all grants to schools made under existing<br />
Commonwealth legislation. I want to tell you now of the<br />
Government's attitude to arrangements already entered into<br />
with non-government schools for science facilities and<br />
library programs. / 6 </p>
<p>The previous Government offered specific amounts<br />
for individual science facilty projects for each year of the<br />
present program to its conclusion on 30 June 1975.<br />
These are firm commitments and will be honoured by my<br />
Government. But the continuation of specific grants for<br />
science laboratories in both government and non-government<br />
schools after June 1975 will be a matter for the Schools<br />
Commission or in the short term, the interim committee.<br />
A similar approach will be followed for the<br />
secondary schools libraries program. Specific offers<br />
have been made by the previous Government for individual<br />
projects up to 31 December 1974 when the present authority<br />
will expire. My Government believes that these offers<br />
represent commitments under the existing legislation and<br />
they will be honoured. But after 1974 we will look to<br />
the Schools Commission to make recommendations on whatever<br />
library grants are appropriate.<br />
We take the same view with general capital grants<br />
for schools. On 12 December 1972 I assured the Premiers that<br />
the $ 167 million appropriated under the State Grants Schools<br />
Act 1972 for capital facilities in government schools would be<br />
made available and that they could proceed with their programs.<br />
I have given the Premiers a similar assurance that the $ 48<br />
million appropriated for non-government schools will also<br />
be available. But my Government agrees with Professor Karmel,<br />
the Chairman of the interim committee, that from July 1974<br />
the allocation of money remaining for the benefit of nongovernment<br />
schools should be on the recommendation of the<br />
Schools Commission or the Interim Committee.<br />
We have also decided that Commonwealth per capita<br />
grants to non-government schools for recurrent expenditure for<br />
1973 will be paid at the rates already approved for 1973<br />
that is, $ 62 per primary pupil and $ 104 per secondary pupil.<br />
In December I wrote to Archbishop Carroll and to the National<br />
Council of Independent Schools and told them of that decision.<br />
After 1973 the interim committee will make recommendations for<br />
recurrent grants for 1974/ 75 on the basis of needs and priorities.<br />
In subsequent years such recommendations will be made by the<br />
Statutory Schools Commission. / 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
With these arrangements, we intend within the<br />
lifetime of this Parliament, or sooner, to ensure that the<br />
national Government~ s commitment to education is discharged<br />
wholly on the basis of needs. I do not apologise for the<br />
fact that the Government's emphasis is on meeting needs<br />
where they demonstrably exist and on giving priority to<br />
areas where the need is greatest. We are concerned with<br />
inequalities; we are not concerned with the historical<br />
sources of these inequalities. It is the child who<br />
matters. For this reason we have announced programs of<br />
assistance for isolated children and students at tertiary<br />
education institutions who are in genuine need. For<br />
this reason we have shown our concern for the education<br />
of Aboriginal children. For the same reason again, we have<br />
taken steps to increase the number of dental therapists and<br />
social workers in training.<br />
Again with our belief in equality of opportunity,<br />
we have tackled the question of pre-school education. Our<br />
approach is a simple one. We believe that pre-school education<br />
with its many advantages should be considered a normal<br />
part of the educational ladder, not an abnormal provision<br />
for a percentage of our pre-school population. We want for<br />
every Australian child the opportunity of a year of pre-school<br />
trainiig. Thus we aim to make available to Australians a<br />
basic educational service which has hitherto and with great<br />
success been available to all children only in the Australian<br />
Capital Territory. In this way my Government is doing more to help<br />
secondary education than any previous government has done,<br />
or any agency has recommended. In 1970 a nationwide survey<br />
of the educational needs of government schools was conducted<br />
by the Australian Education Council, consisting of State<br />
Ministers for Education. It was at that time the only<br />
comprehensive attempt to assess educational needs. My<br />
Government welcomed it for that reason. It drew public<br />
attention to alarming deficiencies. But there were weaknesses<br />
in that survey, and some of its techniques were subject to<br />
criticism. / 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
It took no account of technical or pre-school education.<br />
The investigation by the Interim Schools Committee, set<br />
up by my Government, will be both more up-to-date and more<br />
comprehensive. Since the 1970 survey was made, costs have<br />
increased and the problems are more urgent. Many areas<br />
of need were not considered at all by the 1970 survey.<br />
By means of our proposed Technical Education Commission<br />
and the Interim Pre-schools Committee already set up,<br />
we will be examining fields which the needs survey did<br />
not even touch. It did not consider the specific needs<br />
of isolated, Aboriginal or handicapped children.<br />
Our program does. It will go beyond anything attempted before.<br />
In all its action, the new national Government has<br />
shown its concern for all children irrespective of where they<br />
live, whether they are in a state or an independent school, or<br />
whether they are suffering from disadvantage. In this we<br />
differ from our opponents. A good education, the best education,<br />
is not something individuals must be forced to buy. It is<br />
something the whole community must undertake to provide.<br />
It is not the privilege of a few children but the right of all.<br />
My Government will ensure that such a right is permanently<br />
enshrined in Australian society. </p>
