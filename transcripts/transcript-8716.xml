TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYNFHAM, 7.30 REPORT<br />
NOVEMBER 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COiPY<br />
PL: Prime Minister welcome again to the program.<br />
PM: Good Paul.<br />
PL: ' Unrepresentative swill', ' dcfamers', ' cowards', ' pansies', one could easily get<br />
the impression you don't like the Senate.<br />
PM: The Senate is always ovcr-stepping the mark. We have now got the<br />
Democrats talking about messing around with bills for the income tax cuts,<br />
your viewers would have sccn Senator Bishop pillory one of the bureaucrats<br />
of a generation, Mr Boucher, and allege of him that he made an arrangement<br />
with the Government to secure a position for himself.<br />
PL: They would say they were just doing their job as representatives.<br />
PM: The Senate is out of control and they have to be told that the Government is<br />
made in the House of Representatives, that the Government's money bills<br />
are sacrasonct and that it is in the House of Represcntatives Australia makes<br />
it decisions, and not to try to usurp the powers of thc House of<br />
Representatives in an unrepresentative chamber. That is, where we have the<br />
same number of Senators for Tasmania as we do for NSW.<br />
: 131<br />
80/ 10d 9T0N 61: 81 Z6AON'S </p>
<p>PL: Yes, but I mean in the Rcps the Democrats can't get a guernsey and they get<br />
a sizeable slice of the vote, they can at clast get a go in a Chamber like the<br />
Senate.<br />
PM: But people are drifting in there with 10 or 11 per cent of the vote. You have<br />
got people sitting in the Senate with 10 or 11 per cent of the vote, that's all<br />
they can get but they are still there. Al! right that is fine for their purpose,<br />
but their purpose is not to defame people, to pillory people, but worse to<br />
stand in the way of legitimate government of the Commonwealth in the<br />
House of Representatives.<br />
PL: But this is under the constitution one of the institutions of Australian<br />
democracy, time honoured, and here is the Prime Minister looking like he is<br />
giving it a good old kicking.<br />
PM: It has been kicking institutions itself it was into the tax office last week, it<br />
is into manipulating all sorts of Government legislation. It was set up, Paul,<br />
as a States House to protect the smaller States from what they thought<br />
would be the majority of the bigger States in the House of Representatives.<br />
What is it now? It is such a party House that Mr Reith, the Deputy Leader<br />
in the House of Representatives, put a press statement out yesterday saying<br />
which Senators would sit on a Senate Committee from the Liberal Party.<br />
PL: This is the one that has caused this rumpus, the one that is investigating the<br />
so-called loans affair.<br />
PM: In other words, it is so blatantly a party house that Senator Bishop who is<br />
now going to serve on it, before she has heard any evidence about this<br />
inquiry said today that it was a cover up. This is not even a pretence at<br />
impartiality.<br />
PL: Sure, but I could say here's Paul Keating trying to denigrate the Senate and<br />
its Committee iin advance of its hearing to try to make sure that it is as<br />
bruised and battered as possible before this inquiry gets under way.<br />
PM: I think Senator Bishop's claim today that it was a cover up is like a judge<br />
making a verdict before he or she had heard the case. This has become a<br />
disgracefully had procedure.<br />
PL: Who is going to nominate the Labor people to this Committee? Not John<br />
Button I should imagine. :-131<br />
90* ON 61: 81 Z6' AON'S </p>
<p>PM: They will be announced as appropriately by the managers of Government<br />
business in the Senate.<br />
PL: Yes, but the decisions will be made probably somewhere closer to your<br />
office, won't they?<br />
PM: It is a party House, so there should be no pretence it is a States House<br />
having a legitimate review function on behalf of States. It is a party House<br />
where nonsense is the order of the day a lot of the time, too much of the<br />
time.<br />
PL: But why don't you try to change it, or abolish it or something?<br />
PM: It put our whole constitutional fabric at risk in 1975, they got so Boishie the<br />
Liberal Party over there in 1975 they nearly took Australia to the edge of<br />
civil strife. It was only for the good sense and the tolerance of the Labor<br />
movement that it didn't happen.<br />
PL: But as the next clection showed the people supported that.<br />
PM: They are all at it again over there and the fact is that people swept into there<br />
with 10 or 11 per cent of the vote have got no right to be in trying to tell the<br />
Govcrnment and the H-ouse of Representatives what its principal program<br />
should be.<br />
PL: I gather then that you're not exactly broken-hearted or thinking of resigning<br />
over the fact that today you became the first PM to he censured by the<br />
Senate?<br />
PM: No, here they are defaming people under privilege, calumny, detraction, all<br />
sorts of things, and thcn when someone in the House of Representatives,<br />
me, says look at this place, they say this is shocking, this is shocking, how<br />
dare you talk about us like that I<br />
PL: Tell us in the studio hcre about this pledge you have giveni about not<br />
blocking the GST and what has prompted it?<br />
PM: Well we want the battle for the GST to bc fought out in thc House of<br />
Representatives. We are opposed to a OST, Dr [-ewson is in favour of one.<br />
But the Libcral strategists are now saying, you can still vote for Hlewson and<br />
not get the OST. : 131<br />
le-n-A oTrVDOJ FT: RT Z6* AON* S </p>
<p>PL: Which strategists?<br />
PM: The Liberal Party people.<br />
PL: You know that for a fact?-<br />
PM: Yes, they are saying, and they will say it more as time goes on, you can vote<br />
for Hewson and still not get the OST because it will get held up in the<br />
Senate. All I ami saying, in the unlikely and in the unhappy event of this<br />
nation deciding to clect a Coalition Government with a OST as its centre<br />
piece, then no Senate obstructionism would come from the Labor Party, to<br />
that then Government presenting its program.<br />
PL: So you will let it through?<br />
PM: In other words we would honour the electorate's word, the electorate's<br />
mandate and respect it.<br />
PL: Even though the Democrats are hell-bent on stopping it at all costs?<br />
PM: The Democrats want to say. they want to run around the country in an<br />
election campaign vote for us and we will stop the GST when in fact<br />
they could only stop it with the support of the Labor Party. And Dr<br />
Hewson's crowd would run around saying, don't worry about voting for us<br />
you mightn't get a GST anyway because it may be stopped in the Senate. I<br />
am getting rid of all that nonsense. A vote for Hewson will he a vote for the<br />
GST. A vote for Keating and the Labor Party will be a vote against the<br />
GST.<br />
PL: But they were always going to bring the GST in in the moncy bills, which<br />
you have always pledged since ' 75 that you would never block. So this has<br />
a bit of a stunt element to it doesn't it?<br />
PM: I don't believe that it is legitimate for an Opposition and in the Senate to<br />
deny the principle element of what is a clearly articulated mandate. I notice<br />
George Bush yesterday talked about the ' majesty of democracy' in his very<br />
eloquent speech where he accepted defeat and said he would cooperate in<br />
handing over the mantle to President elect Clinton. Thiat sort of respect for<br />
the democratic process is something my party has always had. Wc are not<br />
the constitutional wrecke rs of this federation that we have left to the<br />
Liberal Party. They arc the people who hold up supply, have Governor<br />
80/ V70d 910' ON 61: 81 Z6' AON* G : 131-</p>
<p>Generals appoint Opposition Leaders as Prime Ministers, all that sort of<br />
nonsense and risk is taken by them.<br />
PL: You're a difficult character to get a handle on aren't you, because one minute<br />
you sound like the very sober-sided statesman and the next minute you're<br />
there with the big bucket over the Senate, using extraordinarily colourful<br />
language, the real larrikin?<br />
PM: You've got to do things to get your attention Paul.<br />
PL: We're always listening.<br />
PM: If I was speaking in the House of Representatives in dulcet tones<br />
PL: You're not doing this for us, this comes very naturally doesn't it?<br />
PM: and articulate as one would do at the bar an argument, not a word would<br />
be reported.-<br />
PL-It's all the media's fault?<br />
PM: No, just that we have to always not only wrap things nicely for you, but put<br />
a bow on top.<br />
PL: And meanwhile, of course, we are not here talking about this so-called<br />
loans affair are we? You've neatly takcn the spotlight off that.<br />
PM: Why would we? It's a sham of an issue anyway.<br />
PL: But if cveryone is so innocent, why not bowl up to the Committee?<br />
Dawkins can look after himsclf can't he?<br />
PM: What is the Senate's legitimate interest in thc operation of a piece of policy<br />
which is principally almost exclusively the business of the executive<br />
government and which this Govemmcnt alone has established. That is, we<br />
were thc only party to establish control over States borrowings with thc socalled<br />
global limits. When Mr Howard was Treasurer, only 25 per cent of<br />
States borrowings were controlled by the Loan Council. In other words, he<br />
is prcpared to let 75 per cent just hacmorrhagc away, but if one small<br />
transaction in the now very tight structure this Government has imposed in a<br />
disciplinary way over a decade, well then it's a crime. So we have a Senate<br />
oniCn'A QTAO0N FAI: RI Z6* AONS .1311 </p>
<p>Committee, but before it starts Senator Bishop says it's a cover up. It is just<br />
a shambles and a joke.<br />
PL: And what if voters say, when on earth are those people in Canberra going to<br />
start talking about the fact that now one in four families has got no one in<br />
work? When are we going to get onto some real issues?<br />
PM: The real issue was Monday night when I met Mr Kennett and resolved<br />
Victoria's debt position with him, resolved to look at the debt strategy which<br />
they'll present to the Loan Council so that the Victorian rccovery and job<br />
growth can continue and not have its financial accounting or thc settlement<br />
of its monies held to ransom by this kind of debilitating and irresponsible<br />
debate which has been promoted by Dr Hewson and Mr Rcith.<br />
PL: Talking of money and uncertainties, are you awarc that people from the<br />
money markets in Sydney and Melbourne have been phoning this building<br />
all day with rumours and seeking confirmation that you are just about on<br />
your way to see Bill Hayden?<br />
PM: You've not been taking their calls I take it?<br />
PL: I have been talking their calls and I've been telling them it's nonsense, but<br />
there is a lot of uncertainty there isn't there?<br />
PM: I don't know.<br />
PL: You don't know? We assurc you Prime Minister there's enormous<br />
uncertainty.<br />
PM: Good on you Paul.<br />
PL: Isn't there some point in trying to put some of this to rcest at least?<br />
PM: I've told you before I think that the public cxpect valuc from thcse<br />
Parliaments and they expect them to run their full course that is into, in<br />
this case, 1993.<br />
PL: So this rules out apre-Christmas poll does it?<br />
PM: I never rule out anything. One of the happy prcrogativcs of a Prime<br />
Minister in this system is to choose the date of the elcction, so I don't rule<br />
things out.<br />
80/ 90* d 910* ON 6T: 81 W6AON-S :-131 </p>
<p>PL: Without seeking to put words into your mouth could we put it this way,<br />
given that a Prime Minister will always go when he thinks he can really win<br />
and he's always got his eye on thc chance, your main thinking now is to go<br />
early next year?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
PL: Thank you. Finally the subject of violence on tclevision. I heard you raise<br />
this in relation to the v~ iolcnce against women at a press conference you<br />
were at the other day, you've raised it again in the House today, it's<br />
obviously something that has been on your mind. What's bothering you?<br />
PM: I think in television feature films and tele-movies on television, too much<br />
violence is creeping into them. I notice this particularly when my children<br />
were watching television in the school holidays where kids do sit up after<br />
8: 30pm, and in a survey done by the ABT, 53 per cent of children are stil1l<br />
up after 8: 30pm. So what I'm saying is that the commercial free-to-air<br />
broadcasters should make certain that the level of violence on tclevision<br />
declines, and adult only movies should be tclecast no carlier than<br />
9: 30pm of an evening, so that at ] cast children have got some chance of<br />
being protected from it.<br />
PL: Do you think this violence is coming through in our society?<br />
PM: There was a very pithy dcmonstration of that in that program Ihe<br />
Simpsons', George Bush mentioned The Simpsons' in the election<br />
campaign, where the family campaign against violence in telcvision. It very<br />
graphically illustrates the point I think, that the more the ambience, the<br />
insensitivities, as people become more insensitiscd to violence the more<br />
prevalent it is likely to be.<br />
PL: And kids are taught that violence is a way of solving problems.<br />
PM: I just don't think that ' children or young peoplc in particular, who haven't had<br />
enough years to settle their thoughts about these subjects, who a majority of<br />
have probably never seen a violent thing happen or a killing. To see it as it's<br />
now being depicted as what you'd call an every day circumstance of the<br />
depiction of modem television is too much for a culture to keep absorbing.<br />
PL: Are the networks going to go along with the Prime Ministcr's request?<br />
8O/ 2-. 0d 9100ON 61: 81 Z6* AON* S: 131 </p>
<p>PM: I don't know, but I was making the point Paul, they've been treated very<br />
fairly in the Government providing an opportunity for them to extend their<br />
reach into pay television. It's not a case of everything for networks and<br />
nothing for the rest of us, I think they've got national responsibilities.<br />
PL: You almost make it sound like a bribe or a bit of a pay out, we look after<br />
you, you do the right thing.<br />
PM: I'm saying they've been treated properly in national policy where national<br />
interests have bcen brought to bear, they should respond accordingly.<br />
PL: And if they don't Prime Minister?<br />
PM: We'll see, but I'm certainly going to writc to the ' Federation of Commercial<br />
Television Stations saying that I think that AO movies ought to be<br />
displayed after 9: 30pm and the classifications for films should be much<br />
more clear. That parents in particular ought to have a better idea of<br />
knowing what a classification means and what sort of depiction is likely in<br />
the event of someone viewing it. I think the ABA is going to run a survey<br />
and an invcstigation on this to dcvelop a ncw classification system and that<br />
should help a great deal, but the greatest help will come from the self<br />
restraint of the television networks themsclves. Chasing ratings with<br />
violence I think has gone too far.<br />
PL: Thank God for family shows like this.<br />
PM: That's right.<br />
PL: Thank you.<br />
