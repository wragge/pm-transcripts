ASIAT TOUR 1967. C' 1 TBODIA<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mir. Harold Holt at<br />
Gala Dinner at Phnom Penh 29th March, 1967.<br />
Over recent years there has oeen a growing awareness<br />
in Australia of our increasing involvement in developments<br />
occurring in South East Asia and the Pacific. While some of<br />
these developments have related to matters of national integrity<br />
and security, there have emerged also positive and mutually<br />
beneficial developments in the fields of trade and commerce.<br />
This is, perhaps most strikingly demonstrated in the<br />
transformation which has occurred in Australia's relations with<br />
Japan. We fought as enemies in the Second 7orld 1' ar but after<br />
the peace we quickly found a basis for friendship and a rapidly<br />
growing trade between our countries began to develop. This has<br />
moved so quickly that today Japan has oecome the largest<br />
importer in the world in value of Australian exports while we<br />
have become the second or third largest importer of exports<br />
from Japan. This, I believe, is illustrative of the improved<br />
relations and mutual benefits which can flow from the establishment<br />
of conditions of security and stability associated with peaceful<br />
economic progress. " Oherever we look in this general area today we find<br />
that in those countries aule to enjoy the blessings of peace,<br />
rapid progress is being achieved. . e find these countries<br />
absorued in xreat tasks of nation buildin, and growth, and South<br />
Last Asia, which has shaken off its colonial past, is able to<br />
employ to an expanding degree the benefits of modern science<br />
and technology. ie in Australia have done our Dest to assist by<br />
providing materials equipment and techniques. In Cambodia's<br />
case, for example, I understand that the irrigation pumps which<br />
we have been aole to provide have been a considerable success,<br />
and more will oe coming to you. Jie have done this gladly<br />
feeling a genuine sense of cooperation with friendly countries<br />
in the region. We strongly uphold the concepts of sovereignty<br />
national self-determination and national independence. Our own<br />
history as a free democratically governed country leads us to do<br />
so. Sixty-six years ago Australia uecame one nation with a<br />
vast continent to develop, and a population of only three million<br />
people. Today, as our population approaches twelve millions, we<br />
take pride in our national growth and the individual Australian<br />
identity we have established. Ours is a friendly country and<br />
Australians will, I think, be acknowledged as friendly people.<br />
We bring warmth and understanding to the national aspirations<br />
of our neighbours we respond readily to warmth and understanding<br />
from them. ' 7e welcome the fact that national -oals today are<br />
centred on the strengthening of domestic institutions, widening<br />
opportunities for our peoples, the development of national resources,<br />
and a more widely shared prosperity spread by programmes of social<br />
justice. There is, we believe, in South East Asia, a common / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
acceptance of the need for a more stable environment in the region<br />
within which members can live in peace and amity and work together<br />
in harmony. Australia will participate whole-heartedly in efforts<br />
to reconcile national differences and in the fostering of<br />
cooperative relations. see, for example much value in such<br />
instrumentalities of mutual benefit as the Colombo Plan and the<br />
Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, and we believe<br />
that Cambodia does also. We see great future promise in the Asian<br />
Development Bank and, as one of ils largest contributors, we hope<br />
to play a full part in its activities. This is Asia's o: n Bank<br />
and w'e believe it will be for the nations of Asia to join together<br />
in making it fully effective.<br />
The harmonious community of developing nations to which<br />
Australia looks forward in the South East Asian region must be<br />
one that is based on general acceptance and respect for differing<br />
national identities, cultures and social and political systems.<br />
For our part Australia has chosen to be a member of<br />
various security treaties relating to the Asian and Pacific areas.<br />
These treaties are defensive in nature, and are designed to<br />
safeguard security and bring stability to the region.<br />
In the pursuit of your naitional interest and the<br />
preservation of your independence, sovereignty and territorial<br />
integrity, Cambodia has adapted policies of neutrality. Astralian<br />
adherence to the principle of respect for national independence<br />
involves recognition of the territorial integrity of the countries<br />
concerned, acceptance of the particular polilical and social<br />
systems prevailing within their domestic jurisdiction, and complete<br />
respect for the national policies of neutrality, and non-alignment,<br />
which countries like Cambodia have adopted. Australians believe<br />
that differences of culture social systems and national policies<br />
can be reconciled by attitudes of mutual understanding, and active<br />
policies of friendship and cooperation.<br />
The present relationship oetween Camoodia and Australia<br />
is a prime example of the success of such policies. Australia<br />
hopes that, through their application on a broader scale diversity<br />
can become a source not of weakness, but of strength not of<br />
discord, but of mutual advantage throughout the South-East Asian<br />
area. It is in this spirit Your Excellencies, Ladies and<br />
Gentlemen, that I ask you to join me in the toast to the health<br />
of the Head of State of Cambodia, His Royal Highness Prince Norodom<br />
Sihanouk and to Madame Sihanouk, to the government and people of<br />
Cambodia, to the continued progress and future prosperity of<br />
Cambodia, and to an ever-closer friendship oetween our two<br />
countries. </p>
