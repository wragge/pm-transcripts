1 March 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTERj<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ADDRESS TO LIBERAL PARTY NSW STATE COUNCIL<br />
ST GEORGE LEAGUES CLUB, KOGARAH<br />
E 0E<br />
Thank you very much. That's almost as good as Grand Final morning. To<br />
Michael Osborne, to my parliamentary colleagues, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
I can think of no more appropriate venue, no more appropriate meeting and no<br />
more appropriate weekend than to celebrate what we have achieved over the<br />
last twelve months.<br />
It was a year ago this weekend, that together, we ended thirteen years of Labor<br />
government in Australia. And I use the word together advisedly, because the<br />
victory that we won a year ago this weekend was a victory that belonged more<br />
than anything else to the rank and file members of the Liberal Party. And I<br />
remember in my acceptance speech at the Wentworth Hotel on that great<br />
Saturday night, saying that for thirteen years the Party organisatioq had endured<br />
many disappointments, it had been the butt of much criticism, even ridicule<br />
people said we no longer had the professional skills to win electioqs, there was<br />
derision heaped upon the organisation, and all of that was flung back in the face<br />
of our critics on that great Saturday in March of last year.<br />
So ladies and gentlemen I commence my address to the NSW State Council this<br />
morning by again thanking the organisation for the absolutely crucial role it<br />
played in electing my government twelve months ago and for the continually<br />
loyalty, fidelity and support that it has given tq me and to my colleagues over<br />
the past twelve months. Fafxor '~ 01/ 03/ 97 15: 39 Pg: 1 </p>

As I review that twelve months I cani honestly say that we have stayed true and<br />
kept faith with the essential commitments that we made to the Australian<br />
people in the lead up to the election campaign. They elected us into<br />
Government to reform Australia's industrial relations system and we have done<br />
that. They elected us into Government to give a greater emphasis in policy<br />
making to supporting Australian families and we have done that. From the first<br />
of January this year, delivered in full on time without qualification was the<br />
Coalition's Family Tax Initiative.<br />
We were elected into Government to assist the small business sector. We have<br />
begun to do that and more will be done in a few weeks' time when I deliver the<br />
Government's response to the Bell Committee Report on Small Business.<br />
We have swept away the unfair dismissal stupidity of Laurie Brereton, we have<br />
fairly dismissed his legislative incompetence. We have through reforming the<br />
industrial relations system, given greater flexibility to small business men and<br />
women. From the 1 st July this year we will introduce the biggest taxation<br />
change to benefit small business in more than three decades. We will allow any<br />
small business man or woman in Australia to sell their existing business and<br />
invest up to $ 5m of the proceeds in not just a business of the same kind but<br />
indeed into any business without incurring any liability for capital gains tax.<br />
There are still many people in small business who are doing it tough, I know<br />
that, I recognise that and I understand that. And you won't be hearing from this<br />
Prime Minister such arrogant responses as " this is as good as it ever gets" and<br />
" if you can't stand the heat you ought to get out of the kitchen and stop being a<br />
self-employed person". Small business copped the ravages of Keating's<br />
recession like no other sector of the Australian business community, and it has<br />
inevitably taken them longer to recover and the period of recuperation has been<br />
more difficult.<br />
We said that we would deliver the greatest ever capital investment in<br />
Australia's environmental future seen since the end of World War II and we are<br />
going to do exactly that. We have secured the support of the Senate for the one<br />
third sale of Telstra and out of that sale we will invest almost $ 1.2 billion into<br />
the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia and that will go towards the long term<br />
of regeneration of Australia's environment it won't be wasted on fancy tinsel<br />
stuff, it will go towards restoring our land it will go towards attacking salinity it<br />
will go towards cleaning up our river system, it will go towards purifying our<br />
oceans. They're the sort of long term building blocks of improving the<br />
environment the Australian community wants. And it will be one of my<br />
proudest boasts as Prime Minister of this country if I can go to the next election<br />
pointing to a programme of environment commitment and environment reform,<br />
because that was an area in earlier years where the Liberal and National Parties<br />
lagged. Farxf t01/ 03/ 97 15: 39 Pg: 2 </p>

And we will also P~ e able to remind the Australian people and remind the<br />
mainstream conservation movement of Australia that it was the Labor Party and<br />
the Australian Democrats and the Australian Greens that tried to stop this<br />
record investment in Australia's environmental future. it still to my mind<br />
beggar's belief that parties that claim to be concerned about Australia's<br />
environmental fu~ ure have been so indifferent and so hostile to such an<br />
imaginative proglame.<br />
I mention these tl~ ings ladies and gentlemen not because they are an exhaustive<br />
list of what has bfen achieved over the last twelve months there are many<br />
other achievemen~ ts. We have restored the accountability of the executive to<br />
the Parliament. No longer does the Government of this country regard<br />
Question Time al a courtesy extended by the Executive to the Parliament. I go<br />
to every Questionl Time, not fifty per cent of them. The number of questions<br />
asked in my first twelve months is a twenty year record. We average almost<br />
twenty questions fa day and Question Time has once again been restored to an<br />
institution where the Ministers can be made accountable and can be questioned<br />
as properly they ; hould in a Westminster parliamentary democracy. And the<br />
restoration of the accountability of the Executive to Parliament is a very<br />
important elemer~ t in the restoration of community esteem for the institution.<br />
Without in any Nyay robbing Parliament of its naturally robust debating<br />
atmosphere I also believe that some of the personal vitriol which the Australian<br />
community founf so distasteful has been removed from parliamentary<br />
proceedings. Au~ tralians want tough vigorous debate and powerful dissent<br />
where there are d~ fferences of view, they do not want ritualistic eye gouging for<br />
its own sake.<br />
Ladies and gentleman that is in a sense a very quick snapshot of what has been<br />
achieved over the last twelve months. But it is by no means the whole story.<br />
There are many things that we have done outside the immediate economic and<br />
industrial area thipt are very important to Australia's long term future. The<br />
tragic events of 4Lpril 28th produced a great response in the area of national gun<br />
control laws. Ai~ d the achievement of those laws, may I say quite openly in cooperation<br />
with all the state governments and also with the co-operation of the<br />
Australan Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. Those laws have made<br />
Australia a safer Icountry and those laws have delivered a greater sense of<br />
security, particularly to women in our community, and I regard the achievement<br />
of those laws as being one of the great social achievements of my Government<br />
over the last twelve months. Faxfrm01/ 03/ 97 15: 39 PSg 3 </p>
<p>Fax from 4<br />
We've also kept faith with our promise to allow a proper process for debate<br />
about Australia's constitutional future. I said before the election where I stood<br />
on the question of Australia's current constitution I've never disguised my<br />
own view but I've always recognised that there are many in this party and<br />
elsewhere that have another view and ours is not an authoritarian party ours is a<br />
liberal open party.<br />
We are going to have a constitutional convention, we are going to elect half of<br />
the delegates and we're going to appoint the other halfjust as I promised, and<br />
we'll see what comes out of it. My only goal is that if Australia is or were to<br />
decide to change the constitutional structure the it ought to occur in<br />
circumstances that unites and not divides the Australian community.<br />
It is also necessary that we grapple in a sensitive way with one of the great and<br />
more complicated challenges that I think any government could have and that is<br />
to frame an appropriate response in the area of native title to the decision of the<br />
High Court in the Wik case. That issue requires an understanding, requires a<br />
patience and it requires a spirit of give and take and compromise by all<br />
concerned if an agreed outcome is to be achieved. I'm trying to achieve such<br />
an outcome. I have no illusions about how difficult it is. There is a great<br />
difference of approach and opinion between the different parties at present and<br />
I'm currently engaged in a process of discussion both private and public with<br />
all of the interested parties and I hope that by Easter to either know if it's<br />
possible to have an agreed outcome or if not to be in a position to recommend a<br />
course of action to the Cabinet and therefore to the government parties.<br />
I want to make it plain to all of you that all of the parties are being included in<br />
those discussions. My goal is to deliver an outcome that delivers justice and<br />
security to all of those concerned. The Wik decision was a surprise to me and<br />
here let me say something briefly about the respective roles of the High Court<br />
of Australia and the Executive and the Legislative branch of government in our<br />
system of government. I am a strong believer as any believer in the<br />
parliamentary democratic system ought to be, I'm a strong believer in the<br />
separation of powers, There is a division of powvers and responsibilities<br />
between the judiciary, the executive and the legislature. It is the role of the<br />
judiciary in a properly independent way to interpret both the common law and<br />
the statute law of Australia and one of the great strengths of Australian<br />
democracy is that we have always had an independent judiciary and we have<br />
always had a judiciary of great integrity. And that remains the case today<br />
because although like any other Australian citizen, a point incidentally<br />
acknowledged as recently as yesterday by the current Chief Justice of the High<br />
Court of Australia, like any other citizen I have a right to criticise a decision of<br />
the courts, I nonetheless recognise and respect both the independence and the<br />
integrity of those who hold judicial office in this country. I do not support any<br />
change to the method of appointing High Court judges in Australia. I deplore<br />
any suggestion that this country should go down the American path of electing<br />
Faxroi~ 01/ 03/ 97 15: 39 Pg: 4 </p>
<p>Fax from judges. I oppose completely.. there are many things about the United States of<br />
America that I love and admire, but I do not believe we will profit this country<br />
by emulating the American judicial system.<br />
So, ladies and gentlemen, it is important that in the current debate about the<br />
role of the court that we don't confuse ourselves and we don't get confused<br />
about respective roles. There is nothing wrong in anybody disagreeing with a<br />
court decision or criticising that court decision. It has gone on for time<br />
immemorial and it will go on again in the future. And the final word I would<br />
say is that in a true separation of powers it is the ultimate role and prerogative<br />
of the parliament of this country to alter any law as currently interpreted or<br />
determined by the courts which it regards to be contrary to the national interest<br />
of Australia.<br />
One of the things that has been an essential ingredient in the successes that we<br />
have achieved over the last year has been the determination and the capacity of<br />
the government to stay in touch with the views and the aspirations and the<br />
hopes of the Australian people. There's a column inch or two in the papers this<br />
morning about the last twelve months and I notice the theme that's coming<br />
through is that some people don't like the fact that I actually listen to what the<br />
Australian public says. I thought one of the roles of a national leader was to<br />
listen and to take notice, to empathise, to understand, to feel the joy and also to<br />
feel the pain and to feel the various degrees of the emotions that the people of<br />
the country he or she feels. And can I say to those who believe that I listen too<br />
much that they're wrong. I listen because I think that's an important part of<br />
My role and while ever I hold this job I will go on listening to the Australian<br />
people. We face in the years ahead enormous challenges to consolidate some very<br />
fortuitous economic circumstances. There are signs and I believe they are<br />
gathering pace, that the Australian economy is beginning to grow again more<br />
strongly than it did in 1996. Business investment is surging ahead very<br />
strongly. We have historically low housing interest rates and I would like there<br />
to be more competition in the banking system so that the historically low<br />
housing interest rates can be replicated in the small business sector with equally<br />
low rates.<br />
Companies like Aussie Home Loans, RAMS, and all those other small new<br />
players in the housing loans area have done great things. We want some of<br />
those in the small business sector. And what they have done is a tremendous<br />
demonstration to all of us of the value of competition. If you every hear<br />
somebody say: ah all of this competition, that all of this deregulation is a lot<br />
of nonsense", throw back to them the experience of Australian home buyers<br />
over the last 12 months. We have the lowest interest rates, as Peter Costello<br />
said, since man first walked on the moon, for the very simple reason that we've<br />
now got more competition in the housing interest rate area. That's why you've<br />
Fa1x/ f0ro3i/ 97 15: 39 Pg: </p>
<p>FarxoM 01/ 03/ 97 15: 39 Pg: 6<br />
6<br />
got low housing interest rates. You've got more competition. You haven', t got<br />
it because of Government intervention, you' ve got it because of plain old<br />
competition something that we should never lose our faith in. Never, ever, as<br />
Liberals because it really lies at the heart of a vibrant capitalist, free-enterprise<br />
society. There's a bit of a debate around at the present time about how far you should<br />
go in deregulating, or freeing, the economy. Now, of course, the pace of<br />
change is important and, of course, you have to take account of the impact of<br />
things like tariff changes on particular parts of the country.<br />
But, ladies and gentlemen, let us, as we approach our second year in office, let<br />
us with the opportunity of really consolidating a great economic recovery not<br />
lose any faith at all in the cause of greater competition and freer approaches to<br />
the regulation of markets because they do ultimately lie behind the prosperity<br />
and the economic future of Australia.<br />
I think if we can consolidate the circumstances we now have and that will<br />
involve a further reduction in the budget deficit in the Budget of May of this<br />
year. It won't be of the magnitude required last year but there will still need to<br />
be further fiscal tightening.<br />
We need to bed down the industrial relations changes, many of which only<br />
come into operation on 12 Mar-ch. We need to proceed with waterfront reform.<br />
We need to respond quickly and effectively to the report of the Wallis Inquiry<br />
into Australia's financial system when it is delivered. We need to implement,<br />
without any interruption, the commitments we've made to provide tax<br />
incentives for private health insurance.<br />
May I say that I register great disappointment with the comments made by the<br />
Vice-President of the Australian Medical Association about private health<br />
insurance. Of course, private health insurance is not what everybody would<br />
like. One of the reasons is that the number of people privately insured in<br />
Australia is much less than what it was when we were last in Government.<br />
When the Fraser Government was defeated in March of 1983 sixty one percent<br />
of Australians, sixty one percent, had private health insurance. That figure is<br />
now thirty four percent. And Graham Richardson at least like myself he was<br />
a follower of St George Graham Richardson said, as Health Minister in the<br />
Labor Government in 1993, that if you allow private health insurance to fall<br />
below 40 percent you begin to put intolerable strains on the system. And<br />
despite those warnings, year after year, Labor in Government neglected it. If<br />
they had, five years ago, done what we are proposing to do in July we would<br />
not now have the problems that we have. And even Bob Canr belatedly<br />
recognises it when he said the problem is that people are dropping out of<br />
private health insurance and putting a strain on the public hospital system. So,<br />
if we do have problems in that area, it's because for 13 years they set about<br />
Fax from </p>
<p>Fax from 7<br />
systematically dismantling the underpinning of private health insurance in this<br />
country because of an ideological objection to it. They were driven by it and<br />
despite the warnings of people like Richardson Keating, Beazley and<br />
Lawrence and all the other crowd that had responsibility in those areas,<br />
followed policies that did immense damage to Australia's health insurance<br />
system. So, that represents a very considerable challenge. We have major challenges<br />
on the foreign policy front. At Easter I will visit Singapore and China.<br />
Australia's relationship with China is an important one to us. Under my<br />
Government it will be a relationship which is built upon the expectation of<br />
mutual respect. Australia and China are vastly different societies and countries.<br />
Ours is an open liberal democracy. Theirs is a closed authoritarian country.<br />
Yet, China has vast potential for the future. The most populist nation in the<br />
world whose economy is growing at a very rapid rate. It is clear that it is in the<br />
mutual national self interest of both of us to build a productive relationship. It<br />
may surprise you to know that China invests more money in Australia than any<br />
other country with the exception of the investments that mainland China makes<br />
in Hong Kong. And it is a very important relationship and it is an important<br />
relationship that I will certainly do my best to improve and build on when I go<br />
there at Easter.<br />
But, one thing that we have done and I think we have done very valuably in the<br />
area of foreign policy over the last twelve months is that we have demonstrated<br />
the proposition I have made time and time again that Australia does not have<br />
to choose between our history and our geography in our foreign relations. Of<br />
course, we want and we will deliver ever closer relations between Australia and<br />
the nations of the Asia Pacific region. They are our friends, they are our<br />
partners, they are our economic future and it is the fastest growing economic<br />
region in the world. Yet, we have, as all of you know, deep and abiding links<br />
with other parts of the world and our historic, and our cultural, and our<br />
political, and our liberal democratic shared inheritance and shared values with<br />
the nations of Europe, the United Kingdom and others, and with the United<br />
States are an important part of our history.<br />
And there is no incompatibility. You can have both. You don't have to make a<br />
choice. And it was one of the foreign policy failures of my predecessor that he<br />
gave the impression, intended or not, that somehow or another we had to make<br />
a choice. Well, we don't. We can have both and the links that we have with<br />
both can contribute to the mutual benefit of the overall relationship.<br />
I suppose the only other thing I might briefly touch upon, of course, are our<br />
opponents. I mean it would be uncharitable not to say anything about them.<br />
But, I'm a btshy, so I'll content myself with saying about them what they have<br />
said about themselves. I mean, we could try George Campbell. He's going<br />
into the Senate next year for New South Wales and he said this: " I don't think<br />
Far1xa/ N03 / 97 15: 39 Pg: 7 </p>
<p>Fax from the Party knows or has a clear perception of what it stands for, or more<br />
importantly what it wants to achieve in terms of development of our society".<br />
Not bad. That was 24 February 1997.<br />
And then, of course, you have relevence depravation syndrome Gareth. When<br />
he was asked about branch stacking, he said: " I don't particularly like this<br />
terminology of branch stacking, I prefer to think of it in terms of exuberant<br />
democracy at work".<br />
I suppose, in a sense, it's natural at a gathering like this that you should say the<br />
odd thing about your political opponents and you should endeavour to crack the<br />
odd joke. I guess it is part of the approach and I think it is fair to say that the<br />
Labor Party is still tying very hard to come to grips with the reality of being<br />
out of office after having been in power for such a long period time.<br />
But, can I say to all of you, don't underestimate, ever, our opponents. I think<br />
one of the great mistakes the Labor Party made was to underestimate us and<br />
that is the reason that we won with such a big majority one of the reasons.<br />
Don't underestimate them. They loved being in office, And they would love to<br />
be back in office. They do regard themselves as the natural party of<br />
Government in Australia. One of the reasons that they lost touch as we worked<br />
up to the last election was they couldn't really believe that the Australian<br />
people would actually vote them out. They kept getting the negative responses.<br />
They kept looking at their research. They kept looking at the polls. They kept<br />
realising that they had been in power for a long timne. But deep down they said<br />
to themselves, but we are the Labor Party. We are the modem Labor Party. I<br />
notice part of them now call themselves the New Labor Party. And despite<br />
that, they just somehow, all the indications to the contrary, they couldn't<br />
believe that the Australian public were going to vote them out. They really had<br />
begun to think they were natural party of Government. What an extraordinary<br />
turn around. They used to say that about us. They used to say we had a bornto-<br />
rule mentality. Well, I'll tell you what nothing belts a born-to-rule<br />
mentality out of you more than 13 years in Opposition.<br />
But, I don't think anybody should every forget that. I mean, never forget the<br />
difficult parts of the journey in politics. And if you don't forget the difficult<br />
parts of the journey you will always remember that ultimately you're not there<br />
because you are some kind of group of divinely inspired geniuses, you are there<br />
because of the gift of the Australian people. We are there because they thought<br />
we better represented their aspiration. We are there because they thought we<br />
could better lead them into the next millennium. We are there because they<br />
think we understand their concerns,, and their hopes, and their fears and their<br />
aspirations. So my message to you on our first birthday celebration as a new Government<br />
is, of course, again my thanks from the bottom of my heart for all that you have<br />

done to help me. To the section of the Party organisation to which I've<br />
devoted so much of my own life and in which I find so many life long friends, I<br />
thank you for that personal support. I thank you for the tremendous support<br />
that you have given to all of my colleagues and could I say to you remember<br />
that power in politics is a gift from the people. It is not there as a bribe.<br />
Remember to keep in touch. Never be arrogant towards the people who voted<br />
you into office. And always remember the great capacity of the Australian<br />
people to level those within our community who get beyond their station in life<br />
and imagine that they have some automatic right to hang on to an office. If we<br />
do that we can celebrate many more birthdays into the future. </p>

Q&amp; A's<br />
Question: The question's about defence. Prime Minister, the decision you made last year<br />
in isolating the defence budget from cuts was one that I personally and a lot of<br />
others associated with the defence forces was very much appreciated. The<br />
morale of our defence forces is something vital to us and this party, I know, is<br />
anxious to see that morale high. Can you tell us whether that same sort of<br />
quarantine from cuts will be evident in the current budget, or indeed, will you<br />
be able to maintain it for the term of this Government?<br />
Prime Minister: Yes.<br />
Question: As one of the rank and file members of the party, congratulations on your first<br />
year of government and I'm sure I speak for everybody else on the floor by<br />
hoping that there will be many more of them, But that's not my question. My<br />
question relates to one of the first lines that you said in your speech where you<br />
talked about environmental reform and I ask that the question with that<br />
background, why was Airservices the people commissioned by the Federal<br />
Government to do the utilisation, the greater utilisation of Mascot airport not<br />
required to produce for the eastern area, modes 8 and 9, an environmental<br />
impact study? And I ask that against the background that the No Aircraft Noise<br />
are lobbying very hard in the eastern area, protest meetings have already been<br />
held, more are expected in the future and as Vice President of Wentworth<br />
Conference it concerns me with a five per cent majority, or just as<br />
importantly.... . the seat of Vaucluse is effected by Bligh and Coogee, now why<br />
was not the requirement why was special dispensation given so that no<br />
environmental impact statement in regard to the jets going over the eastern<br />
area? Prime Minister: The reason for that from recollection is that the advice we had<br />
at the time, which was shortly after the change of government, was that a new<br />
EIS was not required under the law, and as you know in all of these things,<br />
EIS's do take a very long period of time. We were elected on a comrutment to<br />
share the noise around. I know that I know that some areas of Sydney are now<br />
getting noise that previously they didn't get, I know that. But I also have to say<br />
to you that the previous arrangements imposed a quite intolerable burden on a<br />
small section of the Sydney community, including many people who live in<br />
strong Labor seats. And some of the greatest beneficiaries of the changes we<br />
have made have been people who live in the inner suburbs. I mean I don't<br />
know how people have lived in areas like Stanmore and St Peters and<br />
Marrickville all these years, I mean I travel through them I mean you go over<br />
and watch any sporting event in some of those areas, I mean it's an absolute </p>
<p>Fax from miracle that anybody can hear. I mean I think those people have suffered a lot,<br />
and what we've tried to do is to spread it around, I mean my electorate was<br />
badly affected, it is still worse affected than others, it is less affected now than<br />
it was. I don't disgpise that fact, they have rights. The people who live in my<br />
electorate shouldn't lose their rights, because people might say it's<br />
unreasonable that anything is every done to help people who live in the Prime<br />
Minister's electorate, but I think what we've done is we've spread it around<br />
more fairly. Now I think we have..-I mean that's what we've tried to do.<br />
Nobody every welcomes a change that slightly disadvantages them, but I think<br />
if you face a choice between on the one hand having a small number of people<br />
copping it all, that's great for everybody else, but it's a bit unfair on that small<br />
numnber of people, and that was the philosophy that drove what we did.<br />
Question: Mr Prime Minister I preface my question by congratulating you on your<br />
sensitive handling of the relationships with the judiciary over last twenty four,<br />
thirty six hours, but this is on perhaps a similar question, and it's on the role of<br />
the Governor General, and I'd like your opinion on this Sir. I've noted that the<br />
previous two holders of this office have made a number of public statements<br />
which I didn't think~ were in the tradition of the head of state being apolitical<br />
and simply....<br />
Prime Minister: When you say the previous two....<br />
No, the present one and the previous one, and I refer particularly to the<br />
present Governor General's statements as to what should be the timetable for<br />
Aboriginal reconciliation. Now I know that's something to which you're fully<br />
committed, but I'm concerned that statements by a Governor General might be<br />
perceived as an expression of Government policy and if circumstances prevent<br />
you adhering from that you will be regarded as not sticking to your previous<br />
promises. What has been the position of the Governors General do they make<br />
private statements, or are they expressers of government policy?. In a<br />
Constitutional Mon~ archy, the Monarchist is very very careful not to give<br />
private opinions.<br />
Prime Minister: Well, Bob the situation, the convention as I've always read it<br />
-is that the defacto Head of State, and that really is who the Governor General is<br />
in our modem constitutional evolution, he is the defacto Head of State of<br />
Australia, and in that position, he or she ought not to take sides politically, and<br />
he or she should observe considerations of sensitivity in statements that are<br />
made. It doesn't mean, and it would be unnatural for it to mean, that the person<br />
who holds that office can never every express an opinion on anything. I think<br />
that is to impose an unreal restriction and I have to say that the present<br />
occupant of -the office, who was appointed by the previous government, is a<br />
person for whom I have considerable personal respect. He's a person of<br />

integrity and he carries out his duties very conscientiously and I really don't<br />
have anything fiurther to say.<br />
Question: First of all Mr Prine Minister, I would like to congratulate you on behalf of my<br />
people of Fairfield for completing your term, your first term of office as the<br />
Prime Minister. Now thirteen years of labor rule brought massive<br />
unemployment burden for payments or loans to the financial institutions like<br />
( inaudible) Bank and huge number of house breakups and family breakups, and<br />
I understand that your reform packages started on March 2nd last year is getting<br />
tremendous support I wish you success for at least two decades. My question<br />
is if I say that, if Labor Party want to dream about the decision making<br />
process, they have to sit and eat humble Australian pies for at least two<br />
decades. My question is, anyway from Canberra to address the Premier of<br />
( inaudible).<br />
Prime Minister: What I understand your question is, is there any way we can<br />
ensure that the NSW Government restores dignity to the office of NSW<br />
Governor. Well change the NSW Government.<br />
Question: Prime Minister, can I say how pleased most people are that you have refused to<br />
buckle under pressure from the homosexual lobby and endorse tonight's gay<br />
mardi gras. And on the question of family values, can I ask you how your<br />
Family Tax package is being perceived around the country?<br />
Prime Minister: Well I think it is being received very well around the country.<br />
We delivered everything that we promrised. We have delivered a little more<br />
choice for parents as to their child care arrangements. It's not the role of<br />
governments to say to parents how many of them should be in the workforce<br />
when their children are young. That's their business, and it's arrogant of<br />
governments to sort of lay down some kind of paradigm. But the former<br />
system made it very difficult for people who wanted, particularly when their<br />
kids were young, to have either the mother or father out of the workforce for a<br />
period. Now I'm not saying that the changes we've made have sort of provided<br />
huge financial incentives for greater choice, but at least they have recognised<br />
and made a contribution towards greater choice. And that's very, very<br />
important indeed, very, very important. I think it has been seen as a well<br />
targeted initiative. It's been widely supported and it's been seen by<br />
organisations such as ACOSS as being fair to very low income families, so I'm<br />
very well pleased with the reaction it's received. </p>
<p>Fax from Question: Prime Minister: How are you? Haven't seen you for ages.<br />
still here<br />
Prime Minister: Good on you.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, first of all let me congratulate you on obtaining the high<br />
office of Prime Minister of Australia. If there was every an Austr'alian citizen<br />
that deserves such a high office it is the present holder of that situation. As you<br />
know, Mr Prime Minister, I had never any doubts that you were going to<br />
achieve this high office, and having achieved it you've added dignity, both<br />
internally and externally for this nation. Having said so, let me put a very<br />
simple question to you. What initiatives has the government in hand to initiate<br />
further policies in overcoming the crippling overseas debt?<br />
Prime Minister: Well a number of things, the first thing is that we have<br />
reduced the budget deficit and therefore reduced the core of the government<br />
sector on the savings of Australians to pay for government expenditure. We<br />
have also, through reforming the labour market, we have set about making<br />
Australia more competitive. There are two things that you need to do to reduce<br />
Australia's monthly trading and balance of payments deficit, which of course is<br />
the cause of our overseas debt. The money we owe to foreigners is the money<br />
we have constantly borrowed from foreigners to buy the surplus of imports<br />
over exports. The two things you need to do, the first is you need to increase<br />
savings in the Australian community so we don't have to borrow so much from<br />
foreigners, and the second thing you've got to do is to make the Australian<br />
economy more competitive so that we can sell more overseas and our local<br />
industries are more competitive against imports. Now we've set about<br />
addressing the first by cutting the budget deficit and thereby building national<br />
savings, and we've set about tackling the second by reforming the labour<br />
market, we're going to tackle waterfront import reform this year. We've got<br />
major telecommunications reform which will come into operation on the first<br />
of July. We are pressing ahead with national competition policy, all of which<br />
is bound to make Australia more competitive country. There has been some<br />
improvement in Australia's balance of payments situation over the past several<br />
years. It has been slow, but is not as acute as it was some years ago. There is<br />
still a long way to go it is very much like turning round an ocean liner double<br />
the size of the biggest one that's afloat at present it takes a very long time but<br />
at least we have begun apply the policies that will start to turn that ocean liner<br />
around. And they're being applied in those two areas. Fa rom01/ 03/ 97 15: 39 Pg: 13 </p>

Question: And if! I might say Mr Prime Minister, congratulations, we are in delight if we<br />
have one big thing to win if I might say, we've got to win Manly back, which<br />
was one of the strongest Liberal branches in Australia, though I hope that that<br />
will be able to be said after the next state elections. But that is not my<br />
question. My question is about the Constitution of Australia which is, I<br />
believe, personally one of the greatest constitutions of the world. And we are<br />
talking about having a referendum or even discussions about a change, republic<br />
or constitution monarchy which has served us so well over the years. My<br />
problem is that in Australia, less than twelve per cent of the people in Australia<br />
have never seen, let alone read the constitution of this country, of which there<br />
is no litigation virtually about. If you go to the United States, litigation is<br />
continuous, and what concerns me is in this talk of change that we might get<br />
something like the United States constitution, which all I can see will keep<br />
lawyers, and I excuse all lawyers here, but will keep them in jobs forever. How<br />
can we have any proper vote when people do not know what is in this<br />
marvellous constitution that was written one hundred years ago?<br />
Prime Minister: I think that's right, we have failed lamentably over the years to<br />
properly teach our children the basic features of our structure of government.<br />
This, what's the correct expression, this sort of episode, or issues treatment of<br />
Australian history, which has been, become the vogue in recent times has<br />
destroyed any sort of chronological understanding that people under the age of<br />
about forty have all the steps taken to build.... how many children.. how many<br />
Australians under the age of thirty five or forty were properly instructed about<br />
the federation debates, about people such as Parkes and Barton and Deakin and<br />
all of those people it just doesn't happen anymore. You've had plenty of sort<br />
of issues studies, but people, unless you have a chronological understanding of<br />
a nation's history, you have no sort of structure to refer back to. Anyway, I<br />
shouldn't go down that path too much. But you're right. People don't know<br />
much about the Constitution, and there's a lot of people, of course, who are not<br />
particularly keen to get into too much of the detail about it either. They<br />
essentially regard it as a fairly dry subject, but one of the things that we are<br />
going to do in the lead up to the convention is that we're going to prepare and<br />
have published a document to which we will seek, probably seek, input and<br />
contributions from people in the community who have different views, stating<br />
some of the bare facts about how our system, our present system of government<br />
works,, describing the present system of government, describing its strengths<br />
and there will also be people who will argue in the same document about its<br />
weaknesses, and I hope that that document which will be very widely<br />
distributed, I've even got it mind perhaps it appearing as a supplement in all of<br />
the major newspapers in Australia, so and in a relatively attractive form, so that<br />
people can and now a lot of people will actually read material like that if it's<br />
presented in a proper form. I mean, you can't force people to read the<br />
constitution. We're a democracy, no matter how much you distribute a lot of </p>
<p>Fax f romt 1/ 03/ 97 15: 39 Pg:<br />
people just won't read it and you just have to accept that fact. But I do think if<br />
we had a bit of a better understanding about how the system works we can have<br />
a more intelligent debate. Now, I agree with you I think our constitution has<br />
worked very well, I think the present system of government is a very good<br />
system of government. I don't believe that a republican system of government<br />
would be more liberal or more open or more democratic, but it's not just about<br />
debate, it's I've said it before and I'll say it again that I don't think anyone's<br />
unhappy with the present system of government. I think some people that some<br />
of the symbolism associated with the present system of government is no longer<br />
as contemporary as it might be, now that's not necessarly my view, but it is the<br />
view of a lot of people, it's the view of a lot of people in this room, I think we<br />
have to recognise that and we have to be willing to talk about it, but I don't<br />
think we should change something unless we're satisfied that what we're<br />
changing to is as good or better. And that's a pretty hard ask, but we shouldn't<br />
be fightened to talk about it and but we should talk about it against the<br />
background of being well informed and also talk but I think the way we<br />
handle that will give people a lot more information.<br />
Question: Prime Minister, could I begin by congratulating you for your opening speech<br />
yesterday for the Youth Suicide Forum which was held in Canberra, it's quite<br />
obvious that you have an excellent understanding of what is an horrific problem<br />
and indeed a tragedy which faces Australia's youth. But my question is in lieu<br />
of yesterday's discussions, what plan does the Government have to co-ordinate<br />
a national strategy to address this problem?<br />
Prime Minister: Well we have done a number of things, we have looked at the<br />
problems of youth homelessness in a more systematic fashion, and there is<br />
some link between dysfunctional family situations and suicide. There are a lot<br />
of as I said yesterday, there are a lot of tributaries, and that's one of them. We<br />
have got out pilot programnmes on youth homelessness and you may remember<br />
that was an initiative I announced before the election they are now well<br />
underway and I believe they will help in that area. We have put about S$ 19m<br />
into a three-year programme which is a mixture of approaches. It's a very hard<br />
problem and you were at the seminar and you have an understanding of it. It's<br />
a product of family breakdown, of high unemployment, it is bound up with our<br />
attitude to the treatment of mental health disorders, it's part of the wider debate<br />
in the community about how soon people who have mental disorders arc<br />
pushed back into the broader community and that's a very lively debate as you<br />
know, and some of the personal examples that I as a local member have come<br />
into touch with, and I mentioned one of them yesterday, are very much bound<br />
up with that. It's about the availability of services which provide young people<br />
in particular with a point of contact when they feel completely shut off from the<br />
rest of society, I think one of the greatest social innovations in social policy so<br />
simply devised when you think about it that I've seen in my life was the </p>
<p>Fax from01/ 03/ 97 15: 39 Pg: 16<br />
launching of the original Lifeline programme in the early 1960s by Alan<br />
Walker's mission here in Sydney which provided the very simple device of<br />
there being a telephone, and those kids helplie services, the number of<br />
suicides that have been avoided because of that service has been absolutely<br />
magnficent it's very simple it's very effective, It's not just a question of<br />
money, but money's important, it's a question of mobilisig community<br />
services in a completely non-political non -combative way, and you would have<br />
seen there were Labor members present as well as Coalition members. And so<br />
it's trying to do A the things that are going to bring about a change. And in a<br />
sense you say we've got a co-ordinated strategy, well sometimes a co-ordinated<br />
strategy doesn't look very co-ordinated, because you're drawing upon the<br />
voluntary efforts of a lot of people and I still believe very strongly the<br />
involvement of the volunteer sector in areas like this is enormously important.<br />
I mean I am constantly in awe of those men and women who spend hours and<br />
hours often during the long lonely parts of the night sitting at the end of the<br />
telephone, waiting for someone who's about to take their life to ring them up in<br />
the hope that they may be able to persuade that there's a bit more hope in life<br />
than what they at the moment think. And I think those people do a tremendous<br />
job. You can never pay those people, all you can do is thank them, and all you<br />
can do is create a society which makes that kind of work respected and<br />
ennobled because it's a very, very important part of our society, and without<br />
that volunteer glue a lot of the glue that holds us together and keeps people<br />
feeling wanted and cared for is going to disappear. </p>
