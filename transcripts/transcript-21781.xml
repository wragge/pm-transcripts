    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I am pleased to renew the Australian Government's commitment to suicide prevention announcing grants totalling nearly $8 million for 49 suicide prevention initiatives. This funding is for a variety of national and local community suicide prevention initiatives across all states and territories, targeting priority areas agreed by the National Advisory Council on Suicide Prevention.</p>
<p>  The Australian Government will provide $600,000 for Wesley Mission's LifeForce Suicide Prevention programme. LifeForce aims to support Australian communities to recognise people in crisis and to provide help when they need it.</p>
<p>Some other projects include $900,000 for a national initiative to support suicide prevention activities and training in indigenous communities; $600,000 for Kids Help Line to provide services to indigenous children and young people; $77,000 to Lifeline Newcastle  Hunter to continue to provide support to men at risk of suicide following discharge from medical services;  and $75,000 to the Noosa Youth Service's Standby Bereavement Response to provide a 24-hour coordinated community response service for people bereaved by suicide.</p>
<p> Under the National Suicide Prevention Strategy, the Australian Government has provided around $10 million annually since 1999 for the development of national and community models of suicide prevention.  I would like to confirm the Government's ongoing commitment to funding for suicide prevention under the National Suicide Prevention Strategy.</p>
<p>The latest statistics reveal that since 1997, there has been a downward trend in the overall number of people dying as a result of suicide.  However, there is no comfort in the fact that around 2200 Australians commit suicide each year, taking an enormous toll on Australian families and communities.</p>
<p>  Government cannot address these problems alone and we must draw on the strengths and expertise that business, communities and families can bring to the fight against the devastation of lives needlessly lost through suicide.</p>
<p>Wesley Mission's work is a great example of government, business and communities working together. Wesley Mission partners with government and Australian companies to provide real help to people with real needs.</p>
<p>  I congratulate organisations such as Wesley Mission on the major contribution they make to our community and I would encourage the Australian corporate sector to match the Government's funding and donate to this life saving work.  </p>
