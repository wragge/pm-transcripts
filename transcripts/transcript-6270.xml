SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. BOB HAWKE<br />
THAILAND: STATE DINNER<br />
21 NOVEMBER 1983<br />
MR PRIME MINISTER, DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.<br />
AUSTRALIA AND THAILAND ARE CLOSE FR* IENDS.<br />
My GOVERNMENT IS FIRMLY COMMITTED TO STRENGTHENING THIS<br />
FRIENDSHIP. THERE HAS BEEN REMARKABLE GROWTH IN AUSTRALIA-THAI RELATIONS<br />
SINCE THE MODEST BEGINNINGS AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR.<br />
OVER THIS TIME STRONG GOODWILL AND MUTUAL RESPECT HAVE<br />
DEVELOPED.<br />
WE, FOR EXAMPLE, WERE PLEASED AS I MEN~ TIONED IN MY AUDIENCE<br />
WITH His MAJESTY THE KING TODAY, TO HAVE THE CROWN PRINCE<br />
SPEND A NUMBER OF YEARS TRAINING IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
WHILE AUSTRALIANS AND THAIS HAVE DIFFERENT HISTORICAL AND<br />
CULTURAL TRADITIONS, WE HAVE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES IN COMMON.<br />
WE BOTH HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE AND<br />
PRIDE AND CONFIDENCE IN OURSELVES, AND IN WHAT WE HAVE<br />
DONE AND ARE DOING TO BUILD OUR OWN COUNTRIES. </p>
<p>CO-OPERATIVE DEALINGS BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND THAILAND<br />
EXTEND INTO MANY AREAS OF IMPORTANCE TO EACH OF OUR<br />
COUNTRIES, THERE HAS BEEN A STEADY INCREASE IN TRADE BETWEEN AUSTRALIA<br />
AND THAILAND,<br />
OUR COMMON INTERESTS AS COMMODITY PRODUCERS HAVE SEEN US<br />
WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER FOR EXAMPLE, IN TRYING TO<br />
ESTABLISH AN EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL SUGAR AGREEMENT,<br />
AUSTRALIAN AID AND INVESTMENT IS CONTRIBUTING POSITIVELY<br />
TO THAILAND'S AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT,<br />
THE EFFORTS BOTH AUSTRALIA AND THAILAND ARE MAKING TOGETHER<br />
TO POLICE AND, IN THE LONG-TERM, TO ERADICATE THE DRUG<br />
TRADE ARE OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE TO BOTH OUR SOCIETIES,<br />
AUSTRALIA'S REFUGEE ASSISTANCE AND RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM<br />
IS DIRECTED AT ASSISTING THAILAND AS WELL AS SOME OTHER<br />
ASEAN COUNTRIES WITH A PROBLEM THE COSTS OF WHICH, IN<br />
BOTH HUMAN AND MATERIAL TERMS, ARE CONSIDERABLE,<br />
AUSTRALIA AND THAILAND ALSO HAVE IMPORTANT INTERESTS IN<br />
COMMON, </p>
<p>AND THE INTERESTS WE SHARE ARE IMPORTANT TO THE REGION AS<br />
A WHOLE.<br />
AUSTRALIA SEES ITS OWN F UTURE AS BEING INDISSOLUBLY LINKED<br />
WITH THE FUTURE OF THE REGION,<br />
STRONG AND CLOSE ASSOCIATIONS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BETWEEN<br />
AUSTRALIA AND COUNTRIES OF THE REGION IN SUCH WIDE-RANGING<br />
AREAS AS TRADE AND TWO-WAY INVESTMENT, [ REFUGEE ASSISTANCE<br />
AND RESETTLEMENT, DEFENCE CO-OPERATION, OVERSEAS STUDENTS<br />
PROGRAMS, DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE, BUSINESS, PROFESSIONAL AND<br />
TOURISM LINKS.<br />
THE SCALE OF THIS AUSTRALIAN INVOLVEMENT WITH THE REGION<br />
SHOULD BE APPRECIATED.<br />
TOTAL AUSTRALIA/ ASEAN TWO-WAY TRADE IN 1982/ 83 WAS VALUED<br />
AT $ US 3.2 BILLION. Two-WAY INVESTMENT WAS WORTH<br />
$ US 2.04 BILLION IN THE FIVE YEARS TO 1982. 81,500 INDOCHINESE<br />
REFUGEES HAVE BEEN RESETTLED IN AUSTRALIA 24,000 OF THESE<br />
RESETTLED FROM THAILAND. THERE ARE SOME 12,000 SOUTH EAST<br />
ASIAN STUDENTS STUDYING IN AUSTRALIA. AUSTRALIAN AID TO THE<br />
ASEAN COUNTRIES IN 1983/ 84 WILL BE WORTH IN EXCESS OF<br />
$ US 100 MILLION. THE AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE CO-OPERATION PROGRAM<br />
IN THE SAME YEAR WILL CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN $ US 20 MILLION TO<br />
THE ASEAN COUNTRIES, NOT INCLUDING THE COST OF MAINTAINING<br />
AN RAAF SQUADRON AT BUTTERWORTH, SOMIE 235,000 AUSTRALIAN<br />
TOURISTS VISITED THE REGION IN 1982 A MAJOR BOOST TO THE<br />
ECONOMIES OF POPULAR DESTINATIONS SUCH As THAILAND. </p>
<p>THE DEPTH AND EXTENT OF AUSTRALIA'S PARTNERSHIP WITH THE<br />
ASEAN COUNTRIES IS THEREFORE CONSIDERABLE, AND FOR OUR PART<br />
WE ARE COMMITTED TO BUILDING ON AND EXTENDING IT,<br />
IT IS A PARTNERSHIP WHICH HAS BEEN ASSIDUOUSLY DEVELOPED<br />
OVER MANY YEARS AND HAS NOW REACHED THE POINT WHERE<br />
SUBSTANTIAL AUSTRALIAN AND REGIONAL INTERESTS ARE INTIMATELY<br />
BOUND UP WITH ITS CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT,<br />
SOUTH EAST ASIA IS STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT TO AUSTRALIA,<br />
AUSTRALIA SHARES WITH THE ASEAN COUNTRIES A STRONG SENSE<br />
OF THE NEED TO MAINTAIN REGIONAL PEACE AND STABILITY,<br />
AUSTRALIA IS DEEPLY CONCERNED BY ANY DEVELOPMENTS THAT MIGHT<br />
EITHER THREATEN REGIONAL SECURITY OR PUT AT RISK THE<br />
TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND STABILITY OF REGIONAL COUNTRIES,<br />
IN THIS REGARD THE POSITION OF THAILAND IS ONE OF PARTICULAR<br />
SENSITIVITY,<br />
AUSTRALIA RECOGNISES THIS AND OUITE DELIBERATELY AS A<br />
CONSEQUENCE HAS BEEN BUILDING UP ITS DEFENCE CO-OPERATIONPROGRAM<br />
WITH THAILAND FROM ALMOST NOTHING FOUR YEARS AGO<br />
TO APPROXIMATELY $ US 4 MILLION THIS YEAR. </p>
<p>WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN THIS COMMITMENT,<br />
AUSTRALIA SEES IT AS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THAT GREAT<br />
POWER RIVALRY NOT DICTATE THE COURSE OF EVENTS IN THE<br />
REGION. THE PROJECTION OF SOVIET INFLUENCE INTO THE INDOCHINA<br />
SITUATION HAS RENDERED THE TASK OF ACHIEVING A SOLUTION<br />
TO THE PROBLEMS OF THAT AREA IMMEASURABLY MORE DIFFICULT,<br />
IT CAN ONLY BE TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE COUNTRIES OF THIS<br />
REGION THAT THE SOVIET UNION IS NOW ESTABLISHING A FOOTHOLD<br />
FOR ITS OWN POLITICAL AND MILITARY PURPOSES IN INDOCHINA,<br />
THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CONSOLIDATION OF SOVIET<br />
INTERESTS IN THE REGION ARE CONSIDERABLE,<br />
AUSTRALIA, STRONGLY MINDFUL OF THESE RISKS, IS CONCERNED<br />
THAT CONTINUED ISOLATION OF VIETNAM WILL ONLY SERVE<br />
TO EXACERBATE OR HEIGHTEN THOSE RISKS,<br />
IT IS IN NONE OF OUR INTERESTS T+ iAT VIETNAM CONTINUES TO<br />
BE IN A SITUATION OF VIRTUAL ISOLATION IN THE INTERNATIONAL<br />
COMMUNITY RESTING ALMOST SOLELY ON A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE<br />
SOVIET UNION, </p>
<p>I 6<br />
I 6<br />
IT HAS A LEGITIMATE ROLE IN THE REGION IN PEACEFUL<br />
" CO-OPERATION WITH ITS NEIGHBOURS. AS ASEAN ITSELF PERCEIVES,<br />
WHAT AUSTRALIA WANTS TO SEE IS THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF<br />
CO-OPERATIVE WORKING RELATIONS BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES OF<br />
INDOCHINA AND OTHER REGIONAL COUNTRIES WITH AN ATTENDANT<br />
DIMINUTION OF GREAT POWER INVOLVEMENT.<br />
AUSTRALIA'S INTEREST IN DEVELOPING A *-RELCEVAT RELATIONSHIP<br />
WITH VIETNAM IS DIRECTED TOWARDS ACHIEVING THIS.<br />
THE CAMBODIAN SITUATION IS OBVIOUSLY THE GREATEST UNRESOLVED<br />
SOURCE OF TENSION WITHIN THE REGION.<br />
IT IS ALSO THE GREATEST OBSTACLE TO THE NORMALISATION OF<br />
RELATIONS BETWEEN VIETNAM AND ITS NEIGHBOURS.<br />
AUSTRALIA SHARES ASEAN's VIEW THAT " THE CENTRAL ISSUE IN THE<br />
. KAMPUCHEAN PROBLEM IS THE SURVIVAL OF THE KAMPUCHEAN NATION<br />
-AND THE RESTORATION OF ITS INDEPENDENCE ANDSOVEREIGNTY".<br />
WITH ASEAN FOREIGN MINISTERS WE AGREE THAT " THE TOTAL WITHDRAWAL<br />
OF FOREIGN FORCES, THE EXERCISE OF SELF-DETERMINATION, AND<br />
NATIONAL RECONCILIATION ARE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS FOR THE<br />
SURVIVAL OF AN INDEPENDENT AND SOVEREIGN KAMPUCHEA", </p>
<p>THIS IDENTITY OF VIEW BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND ASEAN STEMS DIRECTLY<br />
FROM COMMON STRATEGIC PERCEPTIONS ABOUT ' THE REQUIREMENTS<br />
OF REGIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY,<br />
ON THE FUNDAMENTALS WE ARE AT ONE,<br />
IREITERATE UNEQUIVOCALLY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S<br />
CONDEMNATION, MADE REPEATEDLY BY BOTH ME AND THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
FOREIGN MINISTER, OF VIETNAM'S INVASION AND CONTINUED<br />
OCCUPATION OF CAMBODIA.<br />
WITH ASEAN WE WANT TO SEE AN INDEPENDENT, NON-ALIGNED AND<br />
NEUTRAL CAMBODIA, FREE OF FOREIGN FORCES AND WITH A<br />
GOVERNMENT OF ITS OWIN CHOICE.<br />
IN LINE WITH THIS, AUSTRALIA HAS BEEN SEEKING TO PROMOTE<br />
DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE PARTIES, A DIALOGUE DIRECTED TOWARDS<br />
ACHIEVING VIETNAMESE WITHDRAWAL.<br />
WE HAVE NO ILLUSIONS EITHER ABOUT OUR OWN-INFLUENCE OR<br />
THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROBLEMS INVOLVED.<br />
THERE IS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CONCERN THAT MANY WOULD SHARE,<br />
INCLUDING THE ASEAN COUNTRIES, THAT ANY WITHDRAWAL OF<br />
VIETNAMESE FORCES WOULD PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE<br />
FORCES OF POL POT ON4CE AGAIN TO ESTABLISH THE SORT OF<br />
REGIME WHICH TERRORISED AND TYRANNISED CAMBODIA TRAGICALLY<br />
FOR SO LONG. </p>
<p>SUCH A DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE ABHORRENT TO OUR GOVERNMENT<br />
AND THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
HEREIN LIES AUSTRALIA'S PARTICULAR DIFFICULTY WITH THE<br />
CAMBODIAN RESISTANCE COALITION,<br />
KHMER ROUGE INVOLVEMENT WITH THE COALITION RENDERS<br />
RECOGNITION BY AUSTRALIA IMPOSSIBLE, IT SEEMS TO US THAT<br />
THE APPARENT PREDOMINANCE OF THE KHMER ROUGE WITHIN IT<br />
NOTWITHSTANDING THE COMMENDABLE EFFORTS AND INTEGRITY OF BOTH<br />
PRICE SIHANOUK AND SON SANN CARRIES WITH IT THE UNACCEPTABLE<br />
POSSIBILITY OF THE IMPOSITION OF THE KHMER ROUGE IN CAMBODIA,<br />
THAT PROSPECT DOES NOTHING TO JUSTIFY CONTINUED VIETNAMESE<br />
OCCUPATION OF CAMBODIA,<br />
RATHER WHAT IT DOES IS TO POINT UP THE NEED FOR STEPPED UP<br />
EFFORTS THAT WOULD AT ONCE SECURE VIETNAMESE WITHDRAWAL<br />
FROM CAMBODIA AND ENSURE THAT THE KHMER ROUGE COULD NEVER<br />
AGAIN REIMPOSE THEMSELVES AS THE GOVERNMENT OF THAT COUNTRY,<br />
A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT OF THE CAMBODIAN PROBLEM IS THE ONLY<br />
WAY SUCH A RESULT CAN BE SECURED.<br />
ULTIMATELY SOME BASIS FOR DIALOGUE MAY EXIST WITHIN THE<br />
VARIOUS PROPOSALS PUT FORWARD BY BOTH SIDES, </p>
<p>FOR EXAMPLE, VIETNAM'S RECENT REFERENCES IN CONVERSATION<br />
WITH AUSTRALIA'S FOREIGN MINISTER TO A POSSIBLE CONFERENCE<br />
ON CAMBODIA AS A FUTURE DEVELOPMENT IN ITS CURRENT APPROACH<br />
AND THE APPEAL-ISSUED BY ASEAN FOREIGN MINISTERS IN SEPTEMBER,<br />
INCLUDING A CALL FOR AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ( NOT<br />
NECESSARILY UNDER UN AUSPICES) ON THE RECONSTRUCTION AND<br />
REHABILITATION OF CAMBODIA TO FOLLOW PHASED TERRITORIAL<br />
VIETNAMESE MILITARY WITHDRAWAL, ARE SUGGESTIVE OF NEW AND<br />
POSSIBLY PRODUCTIVE LINES OF APPROACH,<br />
THESE DEVELOPMENTS, COMING AS THEY DO AT THE SAME TIME AS<br />
ASEAN FOREIGN MINISTERS HAVE FORMED A WORKING GROUP OF<br />
OFFICIALS TO STUDY HOW BEST TO DEVELOP THE PROPOSALS IN<br />
THEIR 20 SEPTEMBER APPEAL, HOLD SOME HOPE OF MOVEMENT, IF<br />
NOT IMMEDIATELY, CERTAINLY WITHIN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE,<br />
I SHOULD LIKE TO THINK AUSTRALIA'S INITIATIVE HAS CONTRIBUTED<br />
IN PART TO THESE TENTATIVE MOVES,<br />
AUSTRALIA WILL CONTINUE TO DO WHAT IT CAN, AS A COUNTRY<br />
WITH CLOSE RELATIONS WITH THE ASEAN NATIONS, WITH THE<br />
UNITED STATES AND WITH CHINA AND' ENJOYING USEFUL LINKS WITH<br />
VIETNAM, TO PROVIDE WHATEVER ASSISTANCE MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE<br />
TO THE PROCESS OF FINDING WAYS OF ACHIEVING A DURABLE<br />
SETTLEMENT OF THE CAMBODIAN SITUATION, </p>
<p>As IN THE PAST WE SHALL MAINTAIN THE CLOSEST CONSULTATION<br />
WITH, AND SEEK THE UNDERSTANDING OF, ASEAN IN ANY STEPS WE<br />
MAY CONSIDER IT APPROPRIATE TO TAKE.<br />
A PARTICULARLY DISTRESSING FEATURE IN INDOCHINA HAS BEEN<br />
THE HUMAN SUFFERING ASSOCIATED WITH THE REFUGEE MOVEMENTS<br />
CAUSED BY CONTINUING CONFLICT WITHIN THE AREA.<br />
AUSTRALIA HAS RECEIVED MANY OF THESE UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE<br />
NOT ONLY BECAUSE WE FELT IT RIGHT AND HUMANE TO DO SO,<br />
BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES AS A MEMBER OF<br />
THE REGION TO CONTRIBUTE TO A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM WHICH<br />
HAS HAD ITS MAIN IMPACT IN THAILAND.<br />
OUR CO-OPERATION IN THE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE MADE<br />
NECESSARY BY THE REFUGEE SITUATION REFLECTS SOME OF THE<br />
MOST DEEPLY-HELD VALUES OF OUR TWO SOCIETIES,<br />
IN THIS WE HAVE BEEN MOTIVATED BY COMPASSION AND<br />
HUMANITARIAN CONCERN. AUSTRALIA HAS CONTRIBUTED OVER<br />
$ A 50 MILLION FOR ASSISTANCE IN THE FORM OF CASH, FOOD<br />
AID, AND PERSONNEL TO INDOCHINESE REFUGEES AND DISPLACED<br />
PERSONS SINCE 1978, MORE ON A PER CAPITA BASIS THAN ANY<br />
OTHER COUNTRY, </p>
<p>11,<br />
MUCH OF THIS ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE<br />
DIRECTED TO DISPLACED CAMBODIANS IN THE THAI/ CAMBODIAN<br />
BORDER AREA, WHILE SOME HAS BEEN DIRECTED TO MEETING THE<br />
HUMANITARIAN NEEDS OF RETURNEES AND OTHERS INSIDE CAMBODIA,<br />
THE PROVISION OF SOME HUMANITARIAN AID INSIDE CAMBODIA<br />
HAS THE EFFECT OF AMELIORATING THE CONDITION OF THE<br />
CAMBODIAN PEOPLE. IT ALSO CREATES CONDITIONS WHICH<br />
REDUCE THE ECONOMIC INCENTIVE TO LEAVE AND TO ENCOURAGE<br />
A MOVEMENT BY THE REFUGEES IN THE BORDER AREA TO RETURN<br />
HOME. IT WILL BE EVIDENT THAT AUSTRALIA . BRINGS AN INDEPENDENT<br />
CAREFULLY CONSIDERED VIEWPOINT TO BEAR ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE<br />
REGION. THE ASEAN COUNTRIES WOULD NOT RESPECT US IF WE DID<br />
NOT APPROACH THE CONDUCT OF OUR INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS<br />
IN SUCH A WAY, NOR WOULD WE BE ENTITLED TO SUCH RESPECT,<br />
BUT, ON THE MAIN ISSUES OF PRINCIPLE, THERE IS FUNDAMENTAL<br />
AGREEMENT. IN TERMS OF GIVING EFFECT TO THESE PRINCIPLES<br />
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME DIFFERENCES OF EMPHASIS, BUT<br />
SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE HAS TENDEDTO BE OVERSTATED,<br />
LET ME THEREFORE BE CLEAR AND QUITE UNEQUIVOCAL.<br />
AUSTRALIA IS NOT MAKING SOME KIND OF CHOICE BETWEEN OUR<br />
TRADITIONAL AND CLOSEST FRIENDS SUCH AS THAILAND AND THE<br />
OTHER MEMBERS OF ASEAN ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE COMMUNIST<br />
GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM ON THE OTHER. </p>
<p>12.<br />
RATHER, INSPIRED BY THE SAME HOPES AND CONCERNS AS OUR<br />
FRIENDS, WE WANT TO SEE PEACE IN A REGION WHICH HAS TOO<br />
LONG BEEN CHARACTERISED BY WARFARE, MISUNDERSTANDING AND<br />
OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE.<br />
THE DEEP, WIDE-RANGING RELATIONSHIP WHICH EXISTS BETWEEN<br />
AUSTRALIA AND ASEAN SHOULD PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK WITHIN<br />
WHICH WE CAN ADDRESS SUCH INTERESTS AND CARRY FORWARD<br />
OUR SHARED REGIONAL CONCERNS AND PREOCCUPATIONS.<br />
DESPITE THE PROMINANCE THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN IN SOME QUARTERS<br />
TO PERCEIVED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND THE ASEAN<br />
COUNTRIES, I HAVE FELT CONFIDENT AT ALL TIMES ABOUT THE<br />
ABILITY OF THE LEADERS OF OUR TWO COUNTRIES TO CLARIFY THESE<br />
ISSUES SO THAT THE FUNDAMENTALLY STRONG AND FRIENDLY RELATIONS<br />
BETWEEN OUR NATIONS IS NOT ONLY NOT IN QUESTION, BUT CONTINUES<br />
TO BE FUNDAMENTALLY STRENGTHENED,<br />
THE TALKS BILL HAYDEN AND I HAVE HAD WITH YOU MR PRIME MINISTER<br />
AND WITH FOREIGN MINISTER SIDDHI HAVE CONFIRMED THIS<br />
EXPECTATION, BOTH BILL HAYDEN AND I LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHERING THIS<br />
PROCESS WITH OTHER ASEAN LEADERS. </p>
<p>13.<br />
THE FRANKNESS AND UNDERSTANDING ACHIEVED BETWEEN US ARE,<br />
I BELIEVE, INDICATIVE OF THE STRENGTH AND QUALITY OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN/ THAI RELATIONSHIP.<br />
YOU MAY BE ASSURED AUSTRALIA WILL CONTINUE TO STAND AMONG<br />
THAILAND'S STAUNCHEST FRIENDS, </p>
