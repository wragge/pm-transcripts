PRIME MINISTk r<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF THE REPORT " CHILD CARE IN THE WORKPLACE"<br />
NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE PERSONNEL AND<br />
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS GROUP, MTIA<br />
CANBERRA 7 AUGUST 1989<br />
Bert Evans and Members<br />
of the MTIA,<br />
Parliamentary Colleagues,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
I want to thank you, Bert Evans, and the metal Trades<br />
Industry Association, for your invitation to launch this<br />
important study at your Conference.<br />
In recent years, the MTIA has been at the forefront of<br />
industrial relations reform in this country. I've had<br />
opportunity in the past to commend you on your involvement<br />
in the economic restructuring sweeping Australia, and I<br />
repeat that commendation today. Your constructive approach<br />
to workplace reforms and award restructuring is an example<br />
to all those concerned with effective industrial relations.<br />
I know the MTIA has expressed its support for special<br />
efforts in the award restructuring process to utilise better<br />
the skills of female workers.<br />
Now, by having this launch take place at this Conference,<br />
you are signalling your determination to tackle a related<br />
issue for women in the Australian workplace the key issue<br />
of work-based child care.<br />
We are already seeing that women are the fastest growing<br />
component of the workforce. With the ageing of the<br />
population, employment of women will become even more<br />
important to maintain Australia's economic growth and living<br />
standards.<br />
Throughout Australia, employers are becoming increasingly<br />
interested in the tangible shared benefits of child care in<br />
the workplace.<br />
Esso and Lend Lease have funded a joint child care centre at<br />
Observatory Hill in Sydney. IBM and the St George Building<br />
Society have become involved in making child care places<br />
available for their employees. I had the great pleasure of<br />
opening a multicultural child care centre in Broadmeadows in<br />
December 1988 on land provided by The Ford Motor Company. </p>
<p>With this report, the Government is throwing new light on<br />
the'-costs and benefits of this kind of child care.<br />
And with ' this report we are offering practical and detailed<br />
advice t o employers on how to go about setting up a child<br />
care centre in the workplace.<br />
In an area which is recognised as crucial to women's<br />
employment, this report provides a model of how employers<br />
and employees can co-operate to their mutual advantage.<br />
The availability of affordable, accessible, good quality<br />
child care services benefits all of us in the Australian<br />
community. For parents, it opens up new employment prospects. It is<br />
often the difference between whether a family will live in<br />
hardship or not. It is also vital in enabling women to<br />
contribute to their full potential in the paid workforce.<br />
For the Australian community as a whole, getting parents<br />
with young children to stay in or return to the labour force<br />
means that the energy and skills of many more Australians<br />
can be tapped.<br />
And since all of us Government, industry and the community<br />
at large stand to gain from the availability of quality<br />
child care, we should all play a part in making it a<br />
reality. If this is true for child care generally, then the<br />
advantages of child care located at or near the workplace<br />
are even greater.<br />
The advantages to parents of accessible and reliable child<br />
care are obvious.<br />
Advantages to employers who grasp the challenge are more<br />
complex and varied. As this Study points out, savings can<br />
be expected from reduced labour turnover and a reduction in<br />
employee absenteeism, because employers would be better able<br />
to retain trained and experienced staff.<br />
There are also significant taxation concessions available to<br />
employers providing child care for their workers.<br />
The study quantifies these benefits against the costs of<br />
setting up and maintaining child care centres.<br />
It concludes that when labour related benefits are taken<br />
into account, the fees which an employer would have to<br />
charge in order to break even would be significantly below<br />
those charged by commercial centres. </p>
<p>But equally compelling benefits outlined in the Study are<br />
not so easily quantified. They stem from an increased<br />
ability to attract employees, improved industrial relations<br />
within the organisation, better morale intangible benefits<br />
that many employers see as very important motivations behind<br />
the provision of child care.<br />
This Study is the first of its kind to be published in<br />
Australia. The analysis is based on a commissioned study undertaken by<br />
Dr Russell Ross of the Social Policy Research Centre. Data<br />
was provided by Chester House Child Care Services and<br />
updated by Childcare at Work Ltd.<br />
I also want to pay tribute to the assistance provided at<br />
various stages by the Business Council of Australia, the<br />
Confederation of Australian Industry and the ACTU.<br />
The report sets out the practical steps to establishing a<br />
good quality child care centre in New South Wales<br />
including concrete, reliable and quite detailed information<br />
about the costs that are likely to be incurred in setting up<br />
and running such a centre. It provides contacts for<br />
acquiring similar information in other States.<br />
And it provides information about Commonwealth Government<br />
assistance, about overseas experiences and about conducting<br />
employee surveys on child care needs.<br />
The data is impressive, the information is useful and<br />
relevant and I am convinced this study will substantially<br />
help employers make informed decisions on whether or not to<br />
establish centres.<br />
But let me make this point quite clear. Stimulating debate<br />
which encourages employers to become involved in the<br />
provision of child care in no way suggests that the<br />
Government is forgetting its own responsibilities in this<br />
area. To the contrary my Government has recognised that most of<br />
Australia's paid workers are also parents, and we have been<br />
and remain determined to provide what help we can to people<br />
seeking to balance the potentially conflicting demands of<br />
work and home.<br />
Our achievements in developing and improving this country's<br />
child care services give me great personal satisfaction.<br />
The measure of our achievement is that by 1992, a total of<br />
98,000 additional child care places will have been funded by<br />
this Government a trebling of places since we came to<br />
office in 1983.<br />
Our comprehensive fee relief system ensures that child care<br />
is affordable to Australian families. </p>
<p>The National Child Care Strategy, announced in the last<br />
Budget, will provide 30,000 new child care places over the<br />
next three years in co-operation with the States, local<br />
government and employers.<br />
The National Strategy includes incentives to assist industry<br />
in the provision of child care for employees. One thousand<br />
of the new centre-based places have been earmarked for a new<br />
co-operative venture in which the recurrent costs will be<br />
shared between users, the Commonwealth and the employer.<br />
Commonwealth assistance will take the form of a contribution<br />
towards fee relief to ensure that lower income families can<br />
afford the cost of child care.<br />
I have been pleased to hear that many employers have<br />
contacted the Department of Community Services and Health<br />
for information on this initiative and the first approval is<br />
to be announced shortly.<br />
Equally, there has already been strong interest among<br />
employers in this Cost Benefit Study. Requests for copies<br />
have been received by OSW from more than 100 of Australia's<br />
major businesses.<br />
The study will also I believe be a valuable basis for your<br />
discussion at this Conference.<br />
Whether employers seek to provide child care directly, in<br />
conjunction with other companies or through the National<br />
Child Care Strategy initiative, I am sure this Study will be<br />
an invaluable resource in their decision making.<br />
I have great pleasure in launching it now. </p>
