TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH CAROLINE TUCKER, RADIO 4QR, BRISBANE<br />
17 MARCH 1994<br />
J: Good afternoon, thank you for your time.<br />
PM: Pleasure Caroline.<br />
J: Now one of the big issues concerning Queensland at the moment is the<br />
recommendation from the Grants Commissi-on to lop $ 149 million off our<br />
State budget, causing a lot of angst here, and a lot of tough talk too<br />
between the New South Wales and Queensland Treasurers. Do you<br />
believe you will be considering overruling that?<br />
PM: It's not a matter of overruling it I think. We have this process called the<br />
Grants Commission which looks at the capacity of States to raise -taxes,<br />
their taxing effort, the shift in population it's a formula which we all<br />
affectionately call the black box. Every year the relativities between the<br />
States change, so there's a pool of money which the Commonwealth<br />
reimburses to the States and there is sometimes adjustments to those<br />
pools for shifts in particular things revenue, population or something<br />
like that and that's what has happened here. But this number, $ 148<br />
million, was a very preliminary one and there was, I think, after that a<br />
population adjustment which favoured Queensland so it will be very, I<br />
think, substantially diminished from that.<br />
J: So you will be looking at it very closely and very substantially diminished<br />
from...<br />
PM: I think the Premier, I think Wayne Goss will ensure we look at it closely.<br />
J: Have you made up your mind?<br />
PM: Well, we'll have an offer on the table next week which I think will be, as<br />
we always think it is, fair to everybody and it will be fair to Queensland. </p>
<p>J: No clues about the figure today?<br />
PM: I can't give you that unfortunately, but we are cognisant of the issue and<br />
we will be, as always I think, fair. Whenever these reports have come in<br />
we have always sought to make sure that where there are large<br />
adjustments, that in some way these are more easily accommodated<br />
than simply would otherwise be the case if the raw number was to be the<br />
only number. So we are massaging those numbers and I'm sure we will<br />
come to an equitable result.<br />
J: We all certainly hope so. The issue of compensation to arise out of<br />
native title claims is one that was on the agenda in a big way last year.<br />
We haven't heard a lot about it this year when's that going to be<br />
resolved?<br />
PM: Well that's pretty well settled. The Commonwealth has said we will meet<br />
up to three-quarters of the cost of compensation-with complying States<br />
and half of the administrative costs. Now the administrative costs here<br />
are very large, so we are meeting half those, but we are meeting up to<br />
three-quarters of the costs of compensation for, if you like,<br />
compensation paid for grants of interest in land as far back as 1975. So<br />
it could be a substantial sum over time, in which case the<br />
Commonwealth will be picking up the lion's share of it. Now, I wrote to<br />
Premiers just before the last Council of Australian Governments meeting<br />
in Hobart and nobody raised it at the meeting, so therefore, one<br />
assumes, I think it was reasonable for me to assume, that they were<br />
happy with that.<br />
J: Because they haven't said anything yet?<br />
PM: Well in this business, generally everybody speaks up.<br />
J: Fair enough. The Medicare levy. Now are we going to have a rise in<br />
the budget?<br />
PM: Well I think Senator Richardson said something today saying that -I<br />
can't remember his exact words because I didn't actually hear him say it<br />
but to the effect that there is no basis of understanding to increase the<br />
Medicare levy. He hasn't even brought any of his health submission to<br />
Cabinet at this stage. These things are always around in budgets.<br />
Every budget there's always some. And of course budget-making is<br />
now more public, well it has always been with us a process of<br />
consultation, and a much more public process. This in a sense always<br />
puts all the hares running and this is another budget hare.<br />
J: But Senator Richardson also said that there are serious problems<br />
funding the health budget. </p>
<p>PM: Well there's always a serious problem funding any part of the budget<br />
and health is always changing. I mean we have seen changes in<br />
technology and changes in the way in which the health system<br />
functions. But you only have costs when you make changes, by and<br />
large.<br />
J: You ruled out a 2 per cent levy. Would you rule out an increase?_<br />
PM: Well I didn't rule anything in. I mean at the moment we have got the<br />
health system being delivered on. You see the Medicare levy never<br />
pays for the health system, it's only a part contribution. Most of the<br />
costs of the health system comes from the Commonwealth budget,<br />
comes from other parts of the budget. Fortunately, we have kept health<br />
costs in Australia pretty constant and around about 8 per cent of Gross<br />
Domestic Product. The health cost of the country is about 8 per cent of<br />
the size of the total economy. In the United States, it's about 16 so we<br />
are doing something right. But it's never to say...<br />
J: But you wouldn't rule it out?<br />
PM: But I'm not ruling it in either.<br />
J: Okay, the jobs levy are you ruling that out?<br />
PM: No, we are not ruling that out either. The thing is, the jobs levy,<br />
presents us as an option raised by the Green Paper Group when<br />
looking at some of the options in funding a much more, if you like,<br />
equitable program of training and subsidies to make people ready for<br />
work for the long-term unemployed. Now it's a concept, it's a proposal,<br />
it doesn't mean though that the Government should take it up. Now I<br />
think both Ralph Willis and I have said, and I'm happy to repeat here, I<br />
would prefer to be able to see this funded without resort to a levy. But<br />
it's still on the table and it will be there until the budget numbers really<br />
go to bed.<br />
J: Still on the subject of unemployment, Cheryl Kernot was calling on you<br />
to define long-term unemployed today. She says yesterday you were<br />
saying eighteen months and the Social Security Department says<br />
twelve. Which is it?<br />
PM: Well I think once people pass the twelve months' gate for<br />
unemployment, you have got to categorise people as long-term<br />
unemployed. We are not changing that category, but the fact is we<br />
have been the Party which has said we are not going to leave the<br />
unemployed behind. We are not going to see the recovery come<br />
through with a sort of an under-class of people who have sort of<br />
slipped off the back of the truck so to speak. That they're left behind<br />
as the rest of us move on. I made this very clear on the evening of the<br />
election a year ago in Bankstown in Sydney, and I have repeated it </p>
<p>since. That is, we should have a recovery which everyone has a piece<br />
of including, and particularly those, who have borne the greater burden<br />
already and that is, of course, the long-term unemployed. So, we don't<br />
mind helpers on the job, like Mrs Kernot and the Democrats, but<br />
essentially they are outriders to the main force which is, of course, in<br />
all social matters like this, the Government.<br />
J: Speaking of the out riders, how serious are you about changing the<br />
electoral rules for the Senate?<br />
PM: Well, we have never advanced any proposal about it. We have been<br />
electing the Senate proportionately now since Adam wore shorts.<br />
That's a while ago isn't it? The only points I have made is that as the<br />
House of Representatives gets bigger there is a thing in the<br />
Constitution called the nexus and what it says is this: that the Senate<br />
should be roughly half the size of the House of Representatives. So,<br />
the House has expanded in size, so too then has the Senate. That<br />
means that the quota to elect a Senate person, a Senator, given that<br />
there are more Senators coming all the time, is smaller and smaller<br />
and smaller. So, if we had a full Senate election and you are talking<br />
about 12 Senators for a State you are talking about a quota of around<br />
8 per cent.<br />
J: So, you think the system is no good. Do you want to have that debate<br />
in the sitting of Parliament?<br />
PM: No, no. Every time they ask me I tell them and it infuriates all those<br />
Senators. They all like to think that they can slip in. You see,<br />
Senators are elected at large in a State. Senators are not elected<br />
within definable districts like a member of the House of<br />
Representatives is. They are not responsible, or responsive to a<br />
particular constituency, suburb, locality. They are elected across the<br />
whole State. Now, some take the view that once election night has<br />
passed, particularly if they are on the first major spot on the ticket, and<br />
they have got a full six years, it's: " we will see you in six years time."<br />
Do you understand? Meanwhile, in the House of Representatives<br />
people keep contact with their communities, their constituencies, and<br />
we're saying, I think well, if somebody is getting elected with a low<br />
quota this is somebody who couldn't even get near 50 per cent of the<br />
support of the public. Someone who is sort of, basically, sliding<br />
through the door at 6, 7 or 8 per cent and who might be there for some<br />
years, it is hardly what you call a robust show of democracy.<br />
J: But you are saying that now here in the ABC studios, when are you<br />
going to say that in Parliament?<br />
PM: I said tlat all last week. Every time I do it it is sort of like the thing<br />
belling the cat, you know. I mean, every time I bang the cage they all<br />
around there in that Senate they all the Clerk writes another paper, </p>
<p>and the Clerk's clerk, and the Clerk's Deputy, and the Deputy's deputy<br />
writes another paper. It's a real scream around there.<br />
J: Well, would you consider introducing legislation to change the voting<br />
rules?<br />
PM: No. We are not at this stage contemplating legislation. But it is worth<br />
talking about these things. For instance, let me make this point to you.<br />
We were elected, the Government was elected a year ago. We were<br />
elected on the mandate of restoring growth to the economy. That we<br />
have done. Yesterday the economy grew in those National Accounts<br />
at 4 per cent faster, or as fast as any western economy. We have got<br />
low inflation, we have had 200,000 jobs over the year. But half the<br />
Senate was elected three years earlier than that. In other words, it is<br />
not a contemporary house. It wasn't contemporaneously elected with<br />
the House of Representatives one year ago. So, you see, they don't<br />
like these home truths being pointed out. Basically I don't think even I<br />
would bother to point them out were it not for occasions the place<br />
makes a nuisance of itself. So, therefore I then say, well look, just<br />
understand what is happening here. The Government was elected<br />
with a mandate, it didn't give the Senate a mandate to refuse its<br />
budget, the Government did promise to restore growth to the economy.<br />
It has. The Government did promise to re-start employment. It has.<br />
The Government did promise to put in a big piece of cultural and<br />
property law with Mabo. It has. The Government did promise to bring<br />
in tax cuts around November. It has. The Government did promise to<br />
bring in the home child care allowance, the general rebates for child<br />
care. These things it has done, so therefore a Senate is trying to<br />
thwart the wishes of a Government elected in the House of<br />
Rpresentatives and which is going to be accountable to the public in<br />
just two years from now it is not as if we have got five year elections<br />
in this country. They are only three years. So, this idea that they are<br />
over there to keep us honest, we who can keep ourselves honest by<br />
doing all those things I just mentioned to you. All were then, some of<br />
them sitting there with massive quotas of 5 and 6 per cent of the vote.<br />
These little facts need to be pointed out occasionally.<br />
