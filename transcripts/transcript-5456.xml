PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY 28 SEPTEMBER 1980<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The campaign for the Federal. Elections on October 18 begins<br />
in earnest this week, when I address a public meeting in<br />
Melbourne on Tuesday on behalf of the Liberal/ National Country<br />
Party Government.<br />
Later in the week, the Labor Party Leader will be putting his<br />
case in a pre-packaged, heavily edited and carefully rehearsed<br />
television programme. This election is about responsibility in<br />
Government, which is the theme of my policy speech.<br />
I will be asking Australians for their support on the basis of<br />
our record over the last five years and the undertakings we are<br />
giving now to continue along the same path of good management,<br />
responsibility and confidence in Australia's ability to face<br />
the challenge of the future.<br />
The Government which you choose will be the Government that<br />
leads Australia forward into the 1980s. The world has entered<br />
uncertain times, Soviet aggression, and countries in conflict,<br />
have cast a shadow over world peace. Countries around the world<br />
face the problems of inflation and what flows from it: loss of<br />
business confidence, declining trade, and unemployment. Australia's<br />
stability, security and prosperity will depend on the way we tackle<br />
the challenges at home and abroad.<br />
our achievements over the last five years are considerable. The<br />
Government has brought run-a-way public spending under control,<br />
and cut inflation back from 17 per cent to between 10 and 11<br />
per cent. Australia has become competitive again in world markets.<br />
Investment is once more flowing into Australian industry, our<br />
country is once more developing. More than 200,000 new jobs have<br />
been created over the past year as a result of our policies.<br />
Australia today is far better placed than many others to weather<br />
the storms and meet the challenges of the 1980s. Over the coming<br />
years, it is the Government's intention to maintain our strengthening<br />
economy, and with it to continue to creation of employment,<br />
stability and prosperity for Australian working men and women.<br />
The Government will continue to restrain its own spending and to<br />
hold down taxes and maintain the fight against the inflation<br />
which now besets so many countries. L1QAAQJ PiLe </p>

Australia has great resources: coal, minerals, natural gas and<br />
farmlands; and a people with talent, skill, enthusiasm and<br />
initiative. It deserves a Government which will continue thecurrent<br />
policies of development, economic responsibility, and<br />
of care and concern for those members of the community who are<br />
in need. It needs and deserves a Government dedicated to<br />
security and stability, to good management and responsibility.<br />
Over the last week, the Labor Party has been engaged in its<br />
typical electioneering programme of inflated promises and unreal'<br />
programmes. Let me remind you what happened between 1972 and<br />
1975 when Labor was in Government. Government spending rose to<br />
more than 30 per cent of Gross Domestic Product, s6 that despite<br />
the huge increase in taxation revenues, the Labor Party found<br />
it necessary to increase the Budget deficit enormously and to<br />
go to the printing presses.<br />
The promises already made by the Labor Party now show that another<br />
Labor Government would be just as irresponsible in its economic<br />
management. Six promises alone made by Mr. Hayden so far would<br />
cost an extra $ 2 billion every year as costed by the functional.<br />
departments and tC-he Department of Finance. That is equivalent to<br />
more than $ 8 a week for every taxpayer in Australia.<br />
It should be remembered that if the same rate of tax still applied<br />
as in the Budget which Mr. Hayden brought down in 1975 when he<br />
was Treasurer, then a taxpayer on average weekly earnings with a<br />
dependent spouse and one dependent child would be paying out<br />
$ 22.50 a week more in taxation than he pays today.<br />
Ile have substantially reformed the tax structure. Those reforms<br />
included a reduction in rates, and a simplified three step scale<br />
which restores incentive and makes overtime and pay increases<br />
worthwhile. For example, under Labor in 1975-76, an income earner<br />
was paying 35 cents in the dollar on an income between $ 5,000 and<br />
$ 10,000. Hie paid 45 cents in the dollar on incomes between $ 10,000<br />
and $ 15,000, and 55 cents in the dollar from $ 15,000 to $ 20,000.<br />
Under our scales the tax on taxable income is 32 cents in the dollar<br />
uup to more than $ 17,000 -a very substantial difference indeed.<br />
The latest tax cut, from July 1 this year, is worth between $ 4<br />
and $ 5 a week to a wage earner on the standard rate with a<br />
dependent spouse.<br />
The tax threshold has been raised to over $ 4,000, and in the case<br />
of taxpayers with dependent spouses, the first $ 6,500, or a little<br />
more, is tax free. As a result of our reforms, over half a million<br />
low income earners no longer have to pay tax. The spouse allowance<br />
has been doubled and the sole parent rebate has been increased.<br />
Commonwealth estate and gift duties have,-been abolished.<br />
Labor has indicated that if it ever returned to office, it would<br />
impose a capital gains tax, a wealth tax, a resources tax, and<br />
a punitive tax on higher incomes. These taxes threaten enterprise,<br />
initiative and economic freedom. The wealth and the resources<br />
of the coimmrunity would flow away from the commnunity and into the<br />
coffers of the Governmn-t. </p>
<p>3<br />
Their expenditure and tax policies would mean a return to<br />
rising inflation; a collapse of economic growth and development;<br />
and a loss of the competitiveness which has been won over the.<br />
past five years. There would be lower living standards; reduced<br />
opportunities for individuals and for families; a loss of<br />
confidence in the future; and a decline in jobs for Australian<br />
men and women.<br />
Every time the Labor Leader makes a promise, it is at the expense<br />
of the Australian taxpayer And of the Australian community. What<br />
he is promising belongs to you, not to him or to his Party. It<br />
is to conceal these facts that Labor has launched-its campaign on<br />
the basis of misrepresentation and false claims. The Labor Party<br />
attempts to make people believe that all problems can be solved<br />
by governments with enough power and enough money.<br />
The reality is that to the Labor Party and to the Socialist<br />
Parties everywhere, governments are more important than individuals<br />
and families, and re-distributing wealth is more important than<br />
creating it. They attempt to make people believe that the services<br />
provided by Government are free, when in fact they are paid for<br />
by the taxpayer, arid that social progress can be achieved without<br />
economic progress.<br />
Perhaps the greatest deception that Labor is attempting to<br />
perpetrate is the nature of the leadership which they are offering.<br />
For the purposes of the campaign, the Labor Party is running an<br />
electoral Troika. They are putting forward a team comprising the<br />
Premier of New South Wales, the Candidate for Wills, and Mr. Hayden.<br />
The Labor strategists are trying to give the impression that the<br />
Labor Party has more to offer than Mr. Hayden. Of course, Mr. Wran<br />
remains in the New South Wales Parliament with some responsibilities<br />
to that State, while Mr. Hawke would. have to win the vote of the<br />
Labor Party Caucus if he is even to remain Spokesman on Industrial<br />
Relations. Mr. Hayden's avalanche of promises could only be<br />
fulfilled by imposing a burden of costs which would hurl the<br />
country into a new round of inflation, destroying the economy and<br />
creating more unemployment on a massive scale, as it did between<br />
1972 and 1975.<br />
My policy speech will demonstrate that our continuing and overriding<br />
commitment is to sound and responsible Government, a<br />
Government concerned for the future and for the security, in the<br />
broadest sense, of every Australian. 000---</p>
