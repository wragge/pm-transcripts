" AUSTRALIA' S SECURITY"<br />
Transcript of Election Telecast by the Prime Minister,<br />
Mr. Harold Holt<br />
Throughout this year there has been a great national<br />
debate in Australia auout South Vietnam. This has been so<br />
widely discussed that most people now know where they stand.<br />
The side issues have been eliminated. The great<br />
question ofsecurity that has emerged may be stated simply:<br />
Are we right in joining with our allies to stop aggression<br />
before it spills over into all South East Asia. re we<br />
right in joining with our friends to stop aggression before<br />
it comes near to our shores? , Je think we are right and<br />
we believe that the majority of Australians support us.<br />
Let me put this to you simply: Our fighting in<br />
South Vietnam is buying time for a new and stronger Asia.<br />
This is not a commitment to war; it is a commitment to<br />
peace and freedom.<br />
The whole world, with the exception it would seem,<br />
of Communist North Vietnam and Communist China, wants peace<br />
in Vietnam, as it wants peace everywhere. The olive branch<br />
has been extended time akter time out has been rejected by<br />
Hanoi and Peking.<br />
Communists in Vietnam and China do not want peaceful<br />
negotiations which could guarantee the right of the people<br />
of South Vietnam to choose their own way of life. They<br />
demand a surrender a withdrawal by the friends and allies<br />
of South Vietnam so that South Vietnam may be taken over<br />
by Communism. There are, of course, people in Australia who disagree<br />
with our policy and with America's policy. They have<br />
produced no practical alternative out their views seem to<br />
be, when reduced to hard, realistic terms that we should<br />
make peace with the Communists by giving them what they<br />
want. Peace is not a one-way traffic. Vie and our allies<br />
are ready and willing to talk peace when Peking and Hanoi<br />
are ready. 3ut vie are not willing to surrender to them.<br />
There is too much at stake for South Vietnam,<br />
for South East Asia, for Australia, for the whole Free World.<br />
The Communists must learn that South Vietnam and the<br />
allies of South Vietnam will not lose heart, will not be worn<br />
down, but have the strength and staying power to defend the </p>
<p>-2-<br />
right of every people to choose their own political institutions<br />
and their own social and economic order.<br />
:. hen that day arrives we shall be found amongst<br />
those helping our Asian neighbours to acquire the food, the<br />
wealth, the skills, the education and the strength they<br />
need. This is the kind of involvement we want with the<br />
new Asia. Most Australians understand by now that we can't<br />
separate our domestic affairs from our foreign affairs.<br />
e can't have prosperity and security at home unless we<br />
have security abroad.<br />
So we have joined with others in paying a price<br />
for our freedoms.<br />
We have accepted responsibilities and obligations.<br />
1Ke believe that unless there is security for all<br />
small nations there cannot ue security for any small nation.<br />
That is why we played our part in the making of the<br />
SEATO and ANZUS treaties.<br />
That is why I have welcomed the fruitful talks I've<br />
had with Prime Minister Harold Wilson and his Defence<br />
Minister, Denis Healey, on security problems East of Suez.<br />
That is why we believe strongly in our American<br />
alliance. You have only to look at the map of this part of<br />
the world to see we have a vital interest in the effective<br />
presence and participation of the United States. There<br />
are unfortunately some people in Australia who would like<br />
to see our American alliance weakened. I wonder why.<br />
Our international interests are directly involved<br />
in preserving South East Asia from aggression and from<br />
Communist domination. That is how three successive<br />
American Presidents have measured the situation. Surely<br />
that is how all people who believe in freedom and rejecT<br />
tyranny should see it.<br />
What alternative is offered by our political<br />
opponents? They offer this country a retreat to<br />
isolationism and a walk-out on our friends. The Australian<br />
people will not accept that alternative.<br />
