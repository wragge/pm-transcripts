    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today marks an important step in the national conversation about the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australiaâ€™s Constitution.</p>
<p>We welcome and thank the Co-Chairs of the Referendum Council, Professor Patrick Dodson and Mr Mark Leibler AC, and the other members of the Referendum Council.</p>
<p>Professor Dodson and Mr Leibler were the Co-Chairs of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians, and their leadership will ensure continuity between the Referendum Council and the important work undertaken by the Expert Panel.</p>
<p>The meeting today will discuss a number of important matters, including upcoming national consultations that will provide the opportunity for all Australians to have their say on recognition.</p>
<p>Indigenous-designed and led consultations will be a central element of this national discussion.</p>
<p>It is important that any proposal has the broad support of Indigenous Australians, and the Australian community more generally, before proceeding to a referendum.</p>
<p>The Council will advise us on the progress of the consultations and next steps towards a referendum.</p>
<p>It is expected the Referendum Council will report to us by 30 June 2016.</p>
