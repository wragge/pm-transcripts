    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government is deeply concerned by threats made against the Government of Fiji by the Commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces.</p>
<p>I have spoken on several occasions during recent weeks, including last night, to Prime Minister Qarase to express personally to him Australia's strong support for his government as the duly and democratically elected Government of Fiji.  Australia has also expressed directly to senior Fiji military personnel our clear views on the proper role of the military in a democracy.</p>
<p>These views are shared by the countries of the region.  The members of the recently concluded 37th Pacific Islands Forum held in Nadi, Fiji, commended the firm commitment of the Government of Fiji to the continuing process of promoting national unity, and called on all parties to continue to observe democracy and the rule of law. Australia fully endorses these sentiments.</p>
<p>Australia would view any extra constitutional moves in Fiji with the utmost seriousness and is taking steps to be prepared to respond appropriately to possible developments. Our actions are being closely coordinated with our partners and allies both in the region and beyond.  In this respect, I spoke last night to the Prime Minister of New Zealand the Rt Hon Helen Clark.</p>
