EMBARGOED UNTIL 6.3OPM PRIME MINISTER<br />
IVOR MEDIA 16 November 1984<br />
GRANT TO THE FEDERATION OF ETHNIC COMMUNITIES COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA<br />
In the area of ethnic community affairs, the Government's<br />
policies of concensus and consultation have been' assisted by<br />
the emergence of the Federation Of Eth'. ic Communities'<br />
Council of Australia. The Federation has become a very<br />
effective national umbrella organisation performing( an advocacy,<br />
represenltative and consultative function on behalf of its<br />
constituents, the ethnic communities and their members around<br />
Australia. The Government providcd the Federation with a substantial<br />
grant-in-aid immediately on assuming office last year. This<br />
was the first recognition by a Federal Government of the<br />
Federation's need for regular administrative funding to enable<br />
it to survive and grow.<br />
The Federation has acquired office premises an d talented and<br />
committed staff. However, with its new visibility and the<br />
increased calls being made orn its resources and expertise, it<br />
has rapidly outgrown the base-level grants provided for its<br />
administrative support.<br />
In order to ensure the continuity of itS opPerations, and the<br />
success of its impending First National Congress in Melbourne<br />
next month, the Federal Government will provide supplementary<br />
funding of $ 25,000 to the 1984/ 85 grai't-in-aid of $ 60,000<br />
held by the Federation. </p>
