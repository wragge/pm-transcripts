TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH FRAN KELLY, ABC RADIO 5 MAY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
FK: Prime Minster, you are about to spend billions of dollars on subsidies<br />
to employers, and yet employers say that all the time, that all they want<br />
is less business on costs. Why not spend the same billions taking<br />
some of the costs off business?<br />
PM: Well, because this is about an impact on a group of disadvantaged<br />
Australians. That is, people who have been unemployed for' 12<br />
months-or more, and there is 360,000 of them. And it is unfair, and it<br />
is inefficient, and we have got to re-skill them and be interested in<br />
them, and place them in work, and lift their confidence, and lift their<br />
esteem, and lift their usefulness to an employer, and when we do that<br />
we will do a lot for business. Because in this recovery, which is<br />
showing every sign of being a strong one, we won't get the compliment<br />
to skills formation from migration. It is going to come, and has to<br />
come, from the Australian labour market, from new entrants into the<br />
labour market and from this pool of unemployed people. So, in getting<br />
them re-set by intensively case managing each individual person in<br />
this category, we are going to do a lot for business.<br />
FK: But the key to all this is new jobs. Business says the key to new jobs<br />
is new growth and less business on costs. Why not listen to thtrh nd<br />
just take more of that away and let business do it themselves instead<br />
of bribing them to take on people?<br />
PM: Well, the answer is, we have now got the highest profit share in the<br />
nations history. That is, a proportion of national income going to<br />
profits was last this high in 1988, and before then had no historical<br />
precedent. We have given business a 33 per cent corporate tax rate,,<br />
the same as Singapore, and tax rates in the region. We have given<br />
them a massive acceleration in depreciation. We have removed the<br />
double tax from dividends. You have got to say, well what else? So,<br />
what do we do, say forget 300,000 500,000, but forget it. You stay in<br />
a hole, feel alienated, believe society is not interested in you,<br />
particularly young people. But we will marginally improve the </p>
<p>2<br />
profitability of business, which is already, in macro-economic terms,<br />
massively profitable.<br />
FK Alright, but as you say, the key imperative here is to get people skilled,<br />
is training, how can we trust business to train and train adequately<br />
when in the past they have roundly abused the Training Guarantee<br />
Levy by sending people off to junkets on desert islands, they haven't<br />
put it in to training their staff. Why trust them now?<br />
PM: Well, there will be various forms of training, there will be accredited<br />
structure training by places in TAFE'_ 1in other training institutions as<br />
well as on-the-job training. I mean, much training that employers<br />
provide on the job is the kind of training that is very useful to them and<br />
their employees. And that is the reason that they keep them. But, one<br />
of the problems we have in this country today, in most western<br />
countries, is when I was a teenager there were jobs available for low<br />
skilled work, that work is mostly done by data processing equipment<br />
today. It is work that doesn't exist. Now, we have ten years ago, only<br />
three kids in ten completed secondary school, this year it is eight in<br />
ten. We mean it to be nine and a half in ten at the end of this decade,<br />
in six years time. But there are still kids 15 19 who are dropping out<br />
who are untrained, there aren't jobs for them, and what we want to do<br />
is basically there aren't unskilled jobs for them we want to skill them,<br />
we want to train them, both at school in years 11 and 12, as<br />
traineeships under the training award we are talking about, a training<br />
wage, and on-the-job training.<br />
FK: But you are also investing billions of dollars in this training that is<br />
going to be coordinated and overseen by the Department of<br />
Employment, Education and Training, by the CES, both areas that<br />
have had an incredible number of problems and restructuring to try<br />
and get it right in the past. How can we trust that this billion dollars will<br />
be spend efficiently, and won't go down the drain in mistakes?<br />
PM: Well, one of the things we are doing, which is another novel thing we<br />
are doing, is we are setting up a competitive market for the provision of<br />
case management and job placement. Now, under this proposal in<br />
1994-95 we will be personally case managing, that is one to one case<br />
managing, 504,000 people, over half a million people. And we want to<br />
see that done by the CES and private institutions in the case<br />
management business. So, we are creating a competitive market for<br />
case management. In other words, we are saying this will no longer be<br />
a monopoly for the CES, there will be competitive providers of these<br />
services and by doing that, I believe, we will be very effective in getting<br />
the key thing, which is an accurate assessment of the state of a<br />
person's esteem, to understand their skills, their educational<br />
qualifications, the work experience they have had and to properly<br />
place them in a job.<br />
FK: If that training works, at the end of all this, the only guarantee you are<br />
really given in the White. Paper is that it will create one million job<br />
placements through it. Not one million jobs, not permanent jobs,<br />
that is not much of a promise is it? People want promises of real jobs. </p>
<p>PM: Well, it is a huge promise. For people who have been out of work for a<br />
year, or 18 months, or two years..<br />
FK: But they don't want six months job placement, do they? They want a<br />
real job.<br />
PM: They want firstly enough training to be able to take a job. They want<br />
the esteem which comes from knowing they could actually do a job,<br />
that people actually liked them and were satisfied with them. We have<br />
tremendous success in placing people out of labour market programs.<br />
And that placement means that you have got someone usefully and<br />
gainfully employed back in the economy. But the aggregate<br />
employment growth will come from growth in the economy. The<br />
economy is already growing at 4 per cent:<br />
FK: Well, what is the employment rate going to be then, at the end of this<br />
four years?<br />
PM: Well, we have already had 250,000 job growth in the last year.<br />
FK: But we have still got a million people unemployed.<br />
PM: What we are aiming for here is an unemployment rate, which we think<br />
is within our grasp, of 5 per cent at the end of the decade.<br />
FK: Is that good enough? Are you happy with that figure?<br />
PM: WellI it is better then 10 per cent as it is now.<br />
FK: It is a long way from full employment though, isn't it?<br />
PM: Well, in western countries, I don't think you will find any country is<br />
below 5 per cent unemployment. In the United States they regard full<br />
employment as 6.5 per cent. Now, I would like to think we can get to<br />
five and do better. But at least this is a huge attempt, a novel attempt<br />
to deal with the long term unemployed and to get them down based on<br />
real economic growth. I mean we are exporting our heads off, we are<br />
growing faster than any other western economy, I think, bar New<br />
Zealand. But New Zealand has lost so much growth in the ' 80s, it is<br />
not to be compared with Australia. And we have got low inflation, high<br />
profit share, massive innovation in manufacturing, tremendous<br />
sophistication in services, all we need to do is to train the people to<br />
take the places and the natural growth in the economy will pick the<br />
great body of people up.<br />
FK: It is a novel attempt, but isn't it when it comes down to it just really<br />
putting an awful lot of faith in the job compact working? How can you<br />
really promise all your critics who say they are just going to be<br />
shuffling the long term unemployed queue.<br />
PM: But it is more than that. We are also changing the social security<br />
system. At the moment there is a 100 per cent withdrawal rate on </p>
<p>unemployment benefits. That is, every dollar you earn you lose a<br />
dollar off the unemployment benefit rate. We are changing that to<br />
per cent. We are going form joint testing of a couple to individual<br />
income testing, we are paying the unemployment benefit individually to<br />
a husband and a wife or partner. And by changing the taper to 70 per<br />
cent it means that many of them will take part time work, which they<br />
now can't do. And if they take part time work, again, they get more<br />
family income, their self esteem, their contribution to society grows.<br />
So, it is not just a job compact, there is a whole sophistication of<br />
changes here, there is a radical restructuring of the social security<br />
system where for the first time we are paying benefits individually, and<br />
income testing people individually. And as some people, may well by<br />
now know, there is also the option of women who are at home, or the<br />
spouse at home with young children, to take the parenting allowance,<br />
which will mean that the parenting allowance is paid directly to the<br />
spouse who is looking after children, mainly the mother, directly to her<br />
bank account, and it is not diminished by what the husband or partner<br />
earns, as is the case now. So, this is a very large change which will<br />
actually encourage people to go out and take part time work, and there<br />
is a lot of part time work in the Australian economy today.<br />
FK: How are you going to pay for all this? Is it going to come out of the<br />
growth dividend, is that where the money is coming from?<br />
PM: Well, what we are saying is this will cost $ 1.7 billion in a full year, and<br />
$ 6 billion over the next four years. That is about point 3 of a per cent<br />
of GDP per year, and we say very clearly in the Statement that the<br />
marginally higher financing cost of that addition to the Budget deficit,<br />
or that, if you like, change in the Budget deficit, that would otherwise<br />
be that much lower, is not to be compared with the macro-economic<br />
benefit of having, meeting, skill shortages in a recovery, training<br />
people from a large pool of unemployed resources, getting a more<br />
responsive social security system, case managing every young person<br />
under 18 years of age who is out of work, training them the macroeconomic<br />
effect of that is not to be compared with a Budget deficit<br />
being $ 1.7 billion lower.<br />
FK: But you still have to pay for that.<br />
PM: Look, people say well you will end up with a marginally lower interest<br />
rate effect. Here we have got the financial markets, long bonds are<br />
now over 8.5 per cent, the inflation rate is two. You have got a real<br />
rate on the long end of 7.5 per cent. The average real rate of interest<br />
in the last 50 years was between 4 4.5 per cent, or 3.5 4.5 per cent.<br />
I mean, the notion that the Government should basically forget, the<br />
better part of half a million people say, " tough luck, you're unemployed,<br />
you have taken the brunt of the load and if you are alienated, too bad<br />
for you".<br />
EK: No one wants to forget them.<br />
PM: The implied question is.. </p>
<p>FK: How is it going to be paid for?<br />
PM: The answer is, in an economy that the Government has said in the<br />
Statement today I said we will still bring the Budget deficit down to 1<br />
per cent of GDP, around 1996-97. That is the Government's<br />
commitment and we are doing this within that commitment.<br />
FK: So, will this come out of the growth dividend?<br />
PM: As the economy grows it will produce revenue, more employment, less<br />
unemployment benefits, and the Budget deficit will improve. This is<br />
coming where it should come, it should come from the nation's purse,<br />
for the nation's people, the nation's disadvantaged people.<br />
FK Does that mean more taxes then, in the nations purse?<br />
PM: No, it simply means that the nation is facing up to its responsibilities to<br />
a category of individuals who have carried the burden of economic<br />
change.<br />
FK: Finally, Prime Minister, on another matter, National Party MP, Bob<br />
Cater, asked Michael Lavarch in question time yesterday whether<br />
Graham Richardson was the Labor politician referred to in the<br />
Australian newspaper in relation to a sex scandal. What is your<br />
reaction to that accusation?<br />
PM: The then Senator Richardson had a similar low brow accusation<br />
levelled at him a decade or so ago, about some love boat in Sydney<br />
Harbour, there wasn't a grain of truth in it. And to have this coward<br />
getting up under privilege, he wouldn't say it at the front door of<br />
Parliament House, but always these characters get up under the<br />
privilege which is extended to Members of Parliament for serious<br />
issues to sort of attack somebody. I wasn't in the House, I was still<br />
preparing the Statement, and I came in later to deliver it after question<br />
time. But, I mean, every Parliament seems to pick up a number of low<br />
quality individuals.<br />
FK: Prime Minister, thank you.<br />
PM: Pleasure.<br />
ends </p>
