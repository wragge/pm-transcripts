PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 12 FEBRUARY, 1985<br />
Federal Cabinet today reaffirmed Australian Government<br />
Policy on the basic issues of the Australia/ U. S.<br />
Alliance, ANZUS Treaty and on disarmament and<br />
deterrence. Cabinet took these decisions today after it received and<br />
endorsed a report on my recent overseas visit.<br />
As a result of the discussions, and bearing in mind our<br />
close relations with both the U. S. and New Zealand,<br />
Cabinet will shortly consider a paper on the practical<br />
measures with regard to the U. S. and New Zealand for<br />
giving effect to the ANZUS Alliance following the recent<br />
New Zealand action to ban U. S. ship visits, and another<br />
paper elaborating on the relation between and the<br />
implementation of the Government's policies on<br />
disarmament and support for deterrence.<br />
The first paper will be prepared by the Foreign<br />
Minister, the Hon. Bill Hayden, M. P. and the Minister<br />
for Defence, the Hon. Kim Beazley, M. P. and the second<br />
paper will be prepared by Mr Hayden.<br />
The Cabinet discussion was lengthy, amicable and<br />
conducted in an atmosphere of genuine desire to ensure<br />
continuing unity and cohesion both at the Government and<br />
Party level over these complex and sensitive issues.<br />
There was also general agreement that both the<br />
Australia/ U. S. Alliance and the need to do all in our<br />
power to ensure the maximum possible progress on<br />
disarmament were essential to Australian foreign policy.<br />
All Ministers addressed the issue without rancour and<br />
with a desire to search for the best method of both<br />
implementation and understanding of these policies.<br />
An important theme of the discussion was the need to<br />
ensure that the decision making processes of the<br />
Government were directed most effectively to these ends. </p>
