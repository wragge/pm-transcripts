8 September 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD, MP<br />
DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, RADISSON OBSERVATION CITY HOTEL, WA<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
JOURNALIST: On Sunday, this morning, Simon Crean was saying that Amnanda Vanstone had predicted that<br />
unemployment wouldn't be below 8% before the end of the century. Do you think...<br />
PRIME MIN4ISTER:<br />
No I don't think she said that, but you'd better go and check the record.<br />
JOURNALIST: Simon Crean's also said that your claims about interest rates are looking good is actually a bit of a<br />
furphy and the Budget is going to be cutting production and damaging interest rates. What do you say<br />
to him?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Nonsense. The bottom line of the interest rate debate is that anybody who hacks into the savings made<br />
in the Budget is playing with interest rate fire, they are playing with the possibility that we will have<br />
higher rather than lower interest rates.<br />
JOURNALIST: Any predictions of unemployment by the end of the decade?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The only prediction I make is that you will never get unemployment down in this country until you fix<br />
the labour market and you lift economic growth on a permanent basis. Faxfro~ 08/ 89/ 96 17: 22 Pg: 9 </p>
<p>Fax from<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
You'd be more optimistic though than 8%?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I will be far more optimistic about unemployment if the Senate passes the Work Place Relations Bill and<br />
the other economic reforms that will enable us to run a higher rate of economic growth.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you confident that you will be able to convince the minor parties to get on board with that?<br />
PRIMfE MINISTER:<br />
Well we're working on it. I'm not going to make any predictions on that. I don't speak for the minor<br />
parties and it would...<br />
JOURNALIST: But you do speak to them, don't you?<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
Of course I speak to them regularly and courteously but what they do is a matter for themi to decide<br />
and I always think it's silly in politics to presume to speak for somebody else who's not in your party,<br />
JOURNALIST: If you don't get your Industrial Relations Bill through as you would like it, does that mean that<br />
unemployment might go up?<br />
PRIMIE MIINIST:<br />
What rm. saying to you is that one of the ways of reducing unemployment in this country is to have a<br />
freer labour market. That's what I'm saying to you quite precisely.<br />
JOURNALIST: . that you're now Prime Mnister, last year...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's a fair, you know.. well I think it's a strange assumption. Faxfro~ 88/ 09/ 96 17: 22 Pg: </p>

JOURNALIST: Have you noticed a change in the feeling among WA Liberals from this year to last year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I've always had very good relations with the WA Liberals. But there is justifiable pride in Western<br />
Australia at what was achieved here in the last election.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Age has reported on a green paper for Federal Cabinet on a possible paedophile register, two<br />
versions isth at sort of an area that Cabinet or the Federal Government relied on?<br />
PRIM1E MINISTER:<br />
I understand that that is some kind of working paper within the Attorney-General's Department. Look<br />
that's going on a the time. Anything in that area would be decided by Ministers. Mnisters make<br />
policy not bureaucrats.<br />
JOUYRNALIST:<br />
Prime M~ inister these initiatives you cast your eye over on the plane on the way over to do with native<br />
title, are these new initiatives and can you give us any more detail on exactly what...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No I can't, I can't do that. What I can tell you is that we proposed fair, sensible amendments that will<br />
make the Native Title Act more workable.<br />
JOURNALIST: It's clear to say though isn't it that the Western Australian Government has set the bar quite a bit higher<br />
than the rest of the States with regard to native title. Do you think you were ever going to be able to<br />
make Richard Court and the Western Australian Government happy with relation to native title?<br />
PRIE MINISTER:<br />
I think we're talking about the matter in a very constructive, positive fashion. I understand that the<br />
Native Title Act has, proportionately speaking, a heavier impact on Western Australia than any other<br />
part of Australia. I've always been conscious of that and Richard Court has every reason to express<br />
concern about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard the gun control legislation is not through State Parliament here yet?<br />

<p>Fax from<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh I'm sure it will.<br />
JOURNALIST: Western Australia is moving much more slowly than other states on gun control.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I'm sure that it will go through. I really am.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Mr Court has indicated that there could be an election before Christmas, what do you think of his<br />
prospects? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I'm sure whenever the election is held he will win but it will be a tough fight because of the<br />
redistribution. Hie deserves to win, he's run a very good Government in the interests of all Western<br />
Australians and he'll have my total support. Whether the election is early is entirely a matter for him.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Would you offer yourself to come over and help campaign?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, he calls the shots on campaigns, he's the Premnier, he will decide when the election is held, he will<br />
decide the respective<br />
JOURNALIST: like .( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MiNISTER:<br />
Well look, I will do whatever I'm asked. I'm always ready to do that.<br />
