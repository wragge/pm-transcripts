SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM,<br />
TO THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE FEDERAL<br />
COUNCIL OF THE TRANSPORT WORKERS' UNION OF<br />
AUSTRALIA, CANDERRA, 12 JUNE 197L4<br />
IN NO AREA OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITY IS THERE A<br />
GREATER NEED FOR MODERNISATION AND REFORM THAN IN PUBLIC<br />
TRANSPORT. IN NO AREA ARE THERE GREATER CONSTITUTIONAL AND<br />
ADMINISTRATIVE OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF SUCH REFORM, IN NO AREA<br />
IS THE COST TO THE PUBLIC OF OUR PRESENT ADMlINISTRATIVE<br />
CONFUSION AND PHYSICAL D'ILAPIDATION GREATER AND MORE ENTRENCHED.<br />
OUR TRANSPORT SYSTEMS ARE OUTDATED, INEFFICIENT AND UNECONOMICAL.<br />
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM IS FRAGMENTED AND VAGUELY DEFINED.<br />
TRANSPORT IS THE CINDERELLA SERVICE OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR. IT<br />
WILL-REMAIN SO UNTIL FAR-REACHING REFORMS ARE ACHIEVED.<br />
LOOK AT THE DIMENSIONS OF THE PROBLEM. WE ALL KNOW<br />
THE NOTOROUS BURDEN THAT OUR RAILWAYS HAVE INHERITED FROM A<br />
COL0141AL PAST. THE NATION IS STILL PAYING A HEAVY PRICE FOR<br />
RAILWAY SYSTEMS CENTRALISED ON STATE CAPITALS AND CONSTRUCTED<br />
ON INCOMPATIBLE GAUGES. THE POWER OF THE AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT<br />
TO LEGISLATE ON TRANSPORT IS ILL-DEFINED. APART FROM A GENERAL<br />
POWER TO LEGISLATE IN RESPECT OF AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TERRITORIES,<br />
THERE IS NO SPECIFIC PROVISION IN THE CONSTITUTION GIVIN4G THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT POWER IN RELATION TO ROADS OR ROAD<br />
TRANSPORT. OUR POWERS IN RESPECT OF INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS AND<br />
EXPORT ROADS IN FACT DERIVE FROM OUR POWERS OVER TRADE AND<br />
COMMERCE. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
FOR MANY YEARS THE STATE RAILWAYS HAVE BEEN AN<br />
INSUPPORTABLE BURDEN ON STATE GOVERNMENTS, DISTORTING THEIR<br />
BUDGETS AND DEPLETING THEIR RESOURCES AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER<br />
ESSENTIAL PUBLIC SERVICES, ALL'FORMS OF TRANSPORT URBANI<br />
RURAL AND INTERSTATE HAVE FALLEN DEEPER AND DEEPER IN DEBT<br />
AND OBSOLESCENCE, THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN THAT WHILE THE<br />
STATES HAVE LACKED THE FUNDS TO PROVIDE MODERN TRANSPORT, THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH-IN GENERAL HAS LACKED THE POWERS, ON TOP OF<br />
THAT WE HAVE A MULTIPLICITY OF TRANSPORT UNIONS, ORGANISED ON<br />
A FRAGMENTED FEDERAL BASIS, TENDING TO REINFORCE AND PERPETUATE<br />
THE INEFFICIENCIES ENGENDERED BY INTERSTATE RIVALRY,<br />
THE GOVERNMENTS AIM IS TO PROVIDE A NATIONAL<br />
TRANSPORT POLICY WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT EACH FORM OF TRANSPORT<br />
FULFILS THE ROLE TO WHICH IT IS BEST SUITED WHETHER ROAD,<br />
RAIL, SEA OR AIR, WE HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT STEPS,<br />
WE AMALGAMATED THE OLD DEPARTMENTS OF SHIPPING AND TRANSPORT<br />
AND CIVIL AVIATION, WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS, AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT TRANSPORT ACTIVITIES ARE NOW CONDUCTED WITHIN ONE<br />
TRANSPORT DEPARTMENT, THIS ENSURES OPTIMUM CO-ORDINATION<br />
AND A TRANSPORT SYSTEM CAPABLE OF COPING EFFECTIVELY WITH<br />
DEMANDS AT MINIMUM COST TO THE NATION, THIS POLICY IS IN<br />
DIRECT CONTRAST TO THE COMPLETE LACK OF CO-ORDINATION UNDER<br />
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS, I REMIND YOU THAT IT IS THE POLICY<br />
OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY TO SEEK A REFERENDUM TO GIVE THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT COMPLETE POWERS TO MAKE LAWS WITH RESPECT<br />
TO ALL FORMS OF TRANSPORT, MEANWHILE WE ARE MAKING GRANTS TO THE STATES<br />
TO UPGRADE THEIR URBAN PUBLIC TRANSPORT; WE ARE INCREASING </p>
<p>-3-<br />
OUR GRANTS FOR ROADS; AND WE WILL CO-OPERATE WITH THE STATES<br />
IN RESPECT OF ROAD SAFETY, ROADS AND UNIFORM ROAD LAWS,<br />
OUR BASIC AIM IS TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND IMPROVE SERVICE<br />
TO THE PEOPLE, THE STATE RAILWAY SYSTEMS ARE THE BEST, OR RATHER<br />
THE WORST, EXAMPLE OF THE INADEQUACY OF OUR TRANSPORT SERVICES,<br />
IT WILL HELP IF I EXPLAIN EXACTLY HOW WE APPROACH THIS<br />
PROBLEM AND THE DIFFICULTIES THAT FACE US, BRIEFLY, THE<br />
STATE RAILWAYS HAVE BEEN STARVED OF THE CAPITAL RESOURCES<br />
NEEDED TO MAINTAIN THEIR COMPETITIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY, THEY<br />
ARE GEARED TO OPERATE ON A STATE LEVEL RATHER THAN A NATIONAL<br />
LEVEL, FOR THE MOST PART THEY OPERATE WITH ANTIQUATED ROLLING<br />
STOCK AND EQUIPMENT, YET AUSTRALIA NEEDS A MODERN, EFFICIENT<br />
RAILWAY SYSTEM TO PLAY ITS PROPER ROLE IN THE NATION'S<br />
DEVELOPMENT, IT WAS FOR THIS REASON THAT IN 1972 IN ONE OF THE<br />
FIRST ACTS OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT I OFFERED TO ACCEPT<br />
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RAILWAYS OF ANY STATE PREPARED TO<br />
OFFER THEM, VICTORIA AND QUEENSLAND REFUSED EVEN TO DISCUSS THE<br />
OFFER, DISCUSSIONS WITH THE OTHER FOUR STATES HAVE BEEN GOING<br />
ON FOR SOME TIMEI AND IT IS HOPED THAT DECISIONS CAN BE MADE ON<br />
TWO OF THEM SHORTLY, TO ENABLE OUR PROGRAM TO REVITALISE THE<br />
INTERSTATE RAILWAY NETWORKS TO GET UNDER WAY, FOR THIS PURPOSE,<br />
THE BUREAU OF TRANSPORT ECONOMICS, AT THE REQUEST OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
AND STATE TRANSPORT MINISTER IS EVALUATING MAINLINE UPGRADING<br />
PROGRAMS TO ENABLE AN ORDER OF PRIORITY FOR WORKS TO BE ESTABLISHED, </p>
<p>-IIIN<br />
SOME STATES THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS. AGREEMENTS<br />
HAVE BEEN SIGNED WITH SOUTH AUSTRALIA TO BUILD STANDARD-GAUGE<br />
LINES FROM TARCOOLA TO ALICE SPRINGS AND TO CONNECT ADELAIDE<br />
TO THE EAST-WEST STANDARD GAUGE LINE AT CRYSTAL BROOK, THE<br />
COMPLETION OF THE LATTER PROJECT WILL MEAN THAT ALL MAINLAND<br />
CAPITAL CITIES WILL BE FINALLY CONNECTED TO STANDARD GAUGE.<br />
THERE REMAINS, HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGE OF ROLLING STOCK<br />
SUITABLE FOR. USE ON THE INTERSTATE RAIL NETWORK, AND THE STATE<br />
RAILWAYS ARE HAVING TO TURN AWAY BUSINESS. THIS SHORTAGE MUST<br />
BE OVERCOME. THE GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY LOOKING AT A<br />
PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ROLLING STOCK FOR THE STATES<br />
THROUGH THE COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS, DUE TO BE RENAMED THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS.<br />
ONE OF OUR GREAT INSTRUMENTS FOR THE REFORM AND<br />
CO-ORDINATION OF NATIONAL TRANSPORT WILL BE THE INTER-STATE<br />
COMMISSION. THE GOVERNMENT WILL INTRODUCE A BILL TO REESTABLISH<br />
THE COMMISSION WHEN PARLIAMENT RESUMES. IN MY 1972<br />
POLICY SPEECH I SAID:<br />
" THE INTER-STATE COMMISSION WAS INTENDED TO END<br />
THE CENTRALISATION FOSTERED BY ALL THE STATE<br />
GOVERNMENTS THROUGH THEIR RAILWAY SYSTEMS. IT<br />
SHOULD NOW PROVIDE NOT ONLY FOR THE CO-ORDINATION<br />
OF OUR SIX MAINLAND RAILWAY SYSTEMS AND OUR MAJOR<br />
PORTS IN THE PERIOD BEFORE THE COMMONWEALTH, LIKE<br />
OTHER FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS, INEVITABLY TAKES<br />
RESPONSIBILITY FOR RAILWAYS AND PORTS; IT IS<br />
ALSO THE IDEAL INSTRUMENT FOR CO-ORDINATING OUR<br />
MAJOR ROADS AND SHIPPING LINES AND AIRLINES AND<br />
PIPELINES... </p>
<p>" A FEDERAL LABOR GOVERNMENT WILL PROMPTLY<br />
RESTORE THE MACHINERY THE CONSTITUTION INTENDED<br />
AND VEST IT WITH THE COMMONWEALTH'S FULL<br />
CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS TO PLAN AND PROVIDE<br />
MODERN MEANS OF COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE<br />
STATES,"<br />
THE PLANNING NECESSARY FOR THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF<br />
THE COMMISSION IS BEING CARRIED OUT IN THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT.<br />
As I UNDERTOOK IN MY POLICY SPEECH LAST APRIL, WE WILL<br />
INTRODUCE LEGISLATION FOR THE COMMISSION THIS YEAR, ,/ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
I WANT TO DEAL IN A MOMENT WITH SOME ISSUES OF SPECIAL<br />
CONCERN TO YOUR UNION, FIRST LET ME TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THREE<br />
AREAS WHERE THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN PROMPT ACTION TO IMPROVE<br />
OUR TRANSPORT SYSTEM,<br />
URBAN PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN THE 1973-74 BUDGET THE TREASURER<br />
ANNOUNCED AN ALLOCATION OF $ 32,1 MILLION FOR ASSISTANCE TO THE<br />
STATES FOR URBAN PUBLIC TRANSPORT PROJECTS IN 1973-74 ( INCLUDING<br />
$ 1 MILLION FOR RESEARCH AND PLANNING), A FURTHER $ 1140. MILLION<br />
IS TO BE PROVIDED IN FUTURE YEARS FOR PROJECTS COMMENCED IN<br />
1973-74, THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS FINANCING<br />
OF THE COST OF APPROVED PROJECTS ON A GRANTS BASIS, THREE<br />
STATES VICTORIA, SOUTH AUSTRALIA AND WESTERN AUSTRALIA<br />
HAVE SO FAR SIGNED THE AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH FUNDS ARE TO BE<br />
PROVIDED, THE NEW SOUTH WALES GOVERNMENT ADVISED LAST WEEK<br />
THAT IT IS WILLING TO SIGN THE AGREEMENT IN ITS PRESENT FORM,<br />
AND ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT<br />
TO SIGN THE AGREEMENT THIS WEEK, TASMANIA HAS ALSO ACCEPTED<br />
THE AGREEMENT, ,/ 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS AND EXPORT ROADS AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS<br />
HAVE PROVIDED ASSISTANCE TO THE STATES FOR ROADS SINCE 1926, THE<br />
CURRENT COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS LEGISLATION WILL EXPIRE ON<br />
JUNE, IN MY ELECTION POLICY SPEECH ON 29 APRIL, I ANNOUNCED<br />
THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAD DECIDED TO PRESS AHEAD WITH<br />
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NATIONAL ROADS SYSTEM IN THOSE AREAS WHICH<br />
FALL WITHIN ITS OWN CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES, IN PARTICULAR,<br />
IT WOULD IN FUTURE TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WHOLE COST OF<br />
CONSTRUCTING AND MAINTAINING THE PRINCIPAL ROAD BETWEEN STATE<br />
CAPITALS, AND OF EXPORT ROADS OF PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE,<br />
INCLUDING NORTHERN BEEF ROADS, OTHER RURAL ROADS JOINING MINES<br />
TO SEAPORTS, AND URBAN ROADS TO MAJOR SEA AND AIR TERMINALS,<br />
AT THE PREMIERS' CONFERENCE LAST FRIDAY I ANNOUNCED<br />
THAT THE NEW ROADS ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION WOULD APPROPRIATE<br />
A TOTAL OF $ 1,120 MILLION IN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE<br />
OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS FOR ROADS IN THE STATES, OF THIS<br />
SUM, $ 400 MILLION WILL BE ALLOCATED OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS<br />
FOR INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS AND EXPORT ROADS, THE NEW ROADS<br />
ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION WILL BE INTRODUCED IN THE FIRST SESSION<br />
OF THE NEW PARLIAMENT, ,/ 8 </p>
<p>SAFETY STANDARDS THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS ACTIVELY INVOLVED<br />
WITH THE STATES IN FORMULATING MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS AND<br />
TRAFFIC LAWS ON A NATIONAL BASIS, THIS IS BEING DONE THROUGH<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN TRANSPORT ADVISORY COUNCIL, WHICH HAS A SERIES<br />
OF ADVISORY COMMITTEES, THE Tll, U PARTICIPATES IN THOSE CONCERNED<br />
WITH VEHICLE PERFORMANCE, TRAFFIC CODES AND TRANSPORT OF<br />
DANGEROUS GOODS, THE COUNCIL HAS ENDORSED THE AUSTRALIAN DESIGN<br />
RULES FOR MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY, WHICH INITIALLY APPLIED TO<br />
CARS BUT ARE BEING EXTENDED TO TRUCKS AND BUSES, THE COUNCIL<br />
IS ALSO CONCERNED WITH SAFETY OF INTERSTATE BUSES AND HAS<br />
ENDORSED A UNIFORM SCHEME OF COMPULSORY INSPECTIONS, THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS PREPARED TO LEGISLATE TO COVER<br />
INTERSTATE OPERATORS NOT CONTROLLED BY STATES, FOLLOWING<br />
A RECOMMENDATION BY THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ROAD SAFETY, THE<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO DECIDED TO SET UP A IATIONAL AUTHORITY ON<br />
ROAD SAFETY AND STANDARDS TO ADVISE THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT<br />
ON ROAD SAFETY, INCLUDING PROPOSALS FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO<br />
THE STATES FOR THIS PURPOSE, </p>
<p>THE CREATION OF A MODERN EFFICIENT TRANSPORT SYSTEM<br />
REQUIRES THE CO-OPERATION OF TRANSPORT WORKERS AND THEIR UNIONS,<br />
YOUR INDUSTRY DEMANDS A STRONG, MODERN, UNITED UNION, THE<br />
DIFFICULTIES OF DEALING WITH DIFFERENT STATES AND TRANSPORT<br />
AUTHORITIES ARE GREAT ENOUGH, SUCH DIFFICULTIES ARE INCREASED<br />
IF THE TRANSPORT UNIONS THEMSELVES ARE INEFFICIENTLY ORGANISED<br />
OR WASTE THEIR ENERGIES IN INTERNAL CONFLICTS, IN SHORT, WE<br />
NEED A RESPONSIBLE APPROACH FROM YOU TO HELP US IMPLEMENT<br />
OUR IMPORTANT PROGRAMS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE NATION AND THE<br />
INDUSTRY, TRANSPORT UNIONS MUST WORK TOGETHER TO HELP US<br />
COMPLETE OUR TASK,<br />
THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THE NEED TO KEEP UNIONS<br />
FULLY INFORMED AND INVOLVED IN MATTERS THAT AFFECT YOU, WE<br />
HAVE DONE OUR BEST TO DO SO. lIE INVITED A UNION REPRESENTATIVE<br />
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DISCUSSIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF STATE<br />
RAILWAYS TO THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, IF<br />
A DECISION TO TRANSFER IS MADE A CONFERENCE WILL BE CALLED OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN AND STATE GOVERNMENT. OFFICERS, AC, TU, AND UNION<br />
REPRESENTATIVES TO ENSURE THAT THE TRANSITION PERIOD IS<br />
SMOOTHLY CARRIED OUT, </p>
<p>-1-<br />
UNION GOODWILL<br />
WILL BE ESSENTIAL IN FORMULATING A NATIONAL TRANSPORT POLICY,<br />
YOU HAVE AN INDUSTRY WITH MANY DIFFERENT AND SOMETIMES<br />
COMPETING UNIONS, IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA, FOR EXAMPLE, ENGINEDRIVERS<br />
AND MEN SERVICING ROLLING STOCK BELONG TO A STATE UNION<br />
DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS EMPLOYEES,<br />
THIS SITUATION HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED OUR NEGOTIATIONS TO<br />
TAKE OVER THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN RAILWAYS, MY POINT IS SIMPLY<br />
THAT DEMARCATION DISPUTES ARE NOT CONDUCIVE TO A NATIONAL<br />
TRANSPORT POLICY, THEY MUST BE REDUCED, IF A NATIONAL RAILWAY<br />
SYSTEM BECOMES A REALITY, THEN A NATIONAL UNION REPRESENTING<br />
RAILWAY EMPLOYEES WILL BE NEEDED TO LOOK AFTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,<br />
WAGES AND CONDITIONS'OF SERVICE ON A NATIONAL SCALE, I HOPE<br />
YOU WILL WORK TOWARDS IT, / 11 </p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO A POLICY OF ENCOURAGING<br />
THE AMALGAMATION OF TRADE UNIONS, ITS ATTEMPTS LAST YEAR<br />
TO AMEND THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION ACT TO MAKE<br />
AMALGAMATION. PROCEDURES SIMPLER WERE FRUSTRATED TWICE BY THE<br />
SENATE, WHILE THE NUMBER OF UNIONS IN AUSTRALIA HAS DECLINED<br />
SLOWLY OVER THE YEARS FROM 375 IN 1956 TO 305 IN 1972 THIS<br />
LARGE NUMBER OF SEPARATE UNIONS REPRESENTS A TOTAL MEMBERSHIP<br />
OF A LITTLE OVER 2 MILLION, SUCH A DISPERSAL OF PEOPLE<br />
AMONG SO MANY SEPARATE UNIONS HAS SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS, THERE IS<br />
THE INEVITABLE DUPLICATION OF WORK AND RESOURCES WHICH PRODUCES<br />
WASTED EFFORT, THE FRAGMENTATION OF UNION RESOURCES IN TERMS<br />
OF STAFF, FINANCE AND FACILITIES IMPOSES GRAVE LIMITATIONS ON<br />
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR WORK, RESEARCH RESOURCES OF UNIONS<br />
LIBRARIES AND RESEARCH STAFF ARE MEAGRE AND SUFFER BADLY IN<br />
ANY COMPARISON WITH HIGHLY ORGANISED EMPLOYER ORGANISATIONS, AND<br />
AS WE KNOW, THE LARGE NUMBER OF UNIONS GIVES RISE TO DEMARCATION<br />
DISPUTES WHICH ARE A COMMON OCCURRENCE IN THIS COUNTRY,<br />
AT PRESENT, FOR AN AMALGAMATION PROPOSAL TO BE ADOPTED,<br />
TWO CONDITIONS MUST BE SATISFIED: AT LEAST HALF THE MEMBERS MUST<br />
VOTE AND MORE THAN A HALF OF THE FORMAL VOTES MUST EE IN FAVOUR<br />
OF THE AMALGAMATION, UNDER THE GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSALS IT WOULD<br />
BE NECESSARY MERELY FOR A MAJORITY OF THOSE VOTING TO APPROVE OF<br />
THE PROPOSALS: IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY FOR 50 PER CENT OF<br />
THE MEMBERS TO VOTE IN AN AMALGAMATION, </p>
<p>THE KEY TO INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY IS EFFICIENt EMPLOYEE<br />
ORGANISATION, WHILE OUR OPPONENTS HAVE OBSTRUCTED OUR EFFORTS<br />
TO MODERNISE AND DEMOCRATISE AUSTRALIAN TRADE UNIONS, UNION<br />
CAN STILL WORK FOR MORE RESPONSIBLE AND EFFICIENT ORGANISATION<br />
IN THEIR OWN WAY, I COMPLEMENT THE TWU, ON THE AWARD<br />
RECENTLY NEGOTIATED FOR YOUR MEMBERS IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY<br />
AND THOSE EMPLOYED BY GENERAL CARTAGE FIRMS UNDER THE FEDERAL<br />
TRANSPORT WORKS AWARD A KEY AWARD WITH A BEARING ON THE WHOLE<br />
TRANSPORT INDUSTRY, THIS AWARD WAS NEGOTIATED BY DIRECT AND<br />
FREE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES, IT INCLUDES A SETTLEMENT<br />
OF DISPUTES PROCEDURE WHICH THE GOVERNMENT REGARDS AS ESSENTIAL<br />
TO GOOD INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, ADHERENCE TO THE SPIRIT OF SUCH<br />
A PROCEDURE BY ALL PARTIES SHOULD ENSURE THAT THE PRODUCTIVE<br />
CAPACITY OF THE INDUSTRY AND THE REAL INCOME OF EMPLOYEES ARE<br />
NOT IMPAIRED BY INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES, ,/ 13 </p>
<p>THERE IS A PARTICULAR PROBLEM IN YOUR INDUSTRY WHICH<br />
TYPIFIES THE ARCHAIC CONDITION OF OUR INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,<br />
WE HAVE FIVE INDUSTRIAL ARBITRATION REGISTRATION SYSTEMS IN<br />
THIS COUNTRY, THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION ACT REQUIRES<br />
AN EMPLOYER OR EMPLOYEE ORGANISATION TO BE REGISTERED UNDER<br />
THE ACT BEFORE IT CAN REPRESENT ITS MEMBERS IN THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION SYSTEM, THERE IS A SIMILAR<br />
REQUIREMENT IN.-THE INDUSTRIAL ARBITRATION LEGISLATION OF<br />
HEW SOUTH WALES, QUEENSLAND, SOUTH AUSTRALIA AND WESTERN<br />
AUSTRALIA. IN ORDER TO REPRESENT ITS MEMBERS IN AUSTRALIAN<br />
AND STATE SYSTEMS IT IS NECESSARY FOR A FEDERAL UNION TO<br />
HAVE ITS MEMBERS IN EACH OF THE FOUR STATES IN A UNION<br />
REGISTERED UNDER THE STATE LEGISLATION,<br />
THE RESULT IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE STATE<br />
BRANCH OF A FEDERAL UNION AND A STATE UNION ARE OFTEN<br />
AMALGAMATED, WITH THE SAME OFFICERS, BOOKS, THE ONE SYSTEM<br />
OF MEETINGS, ONE MEMBER REGISTER AND ONE ELECTION OF OFFICERS,<br />
SOMETIMES THE RULES OF EITHER THE STATE OR FEDERAL UNION ARE<br />
ADHERED TO, THE OTHER SET BEING IGNORED, SOMETIMES A MIXTURE<br />
OF RULES IS ADOPTED, THE WHOLE SYSTEM CAUSES INDUSTRIAL STRIFE<br />
THROUGH DEMARCATION DISPUTES AND COMPETITION FOR UNION<br />
MEMBERSHIP WITHIN THE SAME INDUSTRY, s/ 1/ 4 </p>
<p>-114<br />
WE HAVE TRIED TO REMEDY THIS PROBLEM. THE INDUSTRIAL<br />
COURT IN FEBRUARY 19F-9 DREW ATTENTION TO THE URGENCY OF THE SITUATION<br />
AFTER HEARING AN APPLICATION INVOLVING YOUR UNION AND ITS NEW SOUTH<br />
WALES BRANCH. AT THE CONCLUSION OF ITS JUDGEMENT IN MOORE v DOYLE,<br />
THE INDUSTRIAL COURT SAID:<br />
" A SYSTEM OF TRADE UNION ORGANISATION IS URGENTLY NEEDED<br />
W'JHICH WOULD ENABLE THE ONE BODY TO REPRESENT ITS RELEVANT<br />
MEMBERS IN BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE ARBITRATION SYSTEMS<br />
AND IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES<br />
TO EXAMINE THE QUESTION WHETHER ORGANISATIONS AND TRADE<br />
UNIONS CAN BE PROVIDED WITH SUCH A SYSTEM.<br />
". WE HAVE DECIDED TO REFER OUR JUDGMENT IN THIS MATTER AND<br />
THESE REMARKS TO THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL FOR THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
IN THE HOPE THAT IT MAY BE POSSIBLE, AFTER CONSULTATION<br />
BETWEEN COMMONWEALTH AND STATE ATTORNEYS-GENERAL, THE TRADE<br />
UNIONS, BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE, AND OTHER INTERESTED GOVERNMENT<br />
AUTHORITIES TO ARRANGE FOR THE EXAMINATION OF THE IMPORTANT<br />
ORGANISATIONAL MATTERS TO WHICH WE HAVE REFERRED." I<br />
DESPITE THIS URGENT APPEAL THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT AND<br />
THE ANTI-LABOR STATE GOVERNMENTS DID NOTHING. SO IN JANUARY LAST<br />
YEAR I WROTE TO THE PREMIERS OF N'EW SOUTH WALES, QUEENSLAND AND<br />
WESTERN AUSTRALIA SUGGESTING THAT THEY CONSIDER ADOPTING A SOUTH<br />
AUSTRALIAN PROPOSAL AIMED AT PROVIDING SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM.<br />
THE PROPOSAL PROVIDED FOR THE "/ RECOGNITION" I OF A STATE BRANCH OF<br />
A FEDERAL UNION UNDER STATE INDUSTRIAL ARBITRATION LEGISLATION.<br />
A " RECOGNISED" STATh BRANCH WOULD NOT HAVE A LEGAL IDENTITY<br />
DISTINCT FROM THE FEDERAL UNION BUT WOULD EXIST AS PORTION OF<br />
THE FEDERAL UNION AND ACT AS THE FEDERAL UNION WITHIN THE STATE<br />
INDUSTRIAL JURISDICTION. OUEENSLAND REFUSED TO C07OPERATE AND<br />
WE HAD NO RESPONSE AT ALL FROM 14EW SOUTH WALES, THE STATE WHERE<br />
THE PROBLEM IS MOST ACUTE. </p>
<p>[ EVERTHELESS, THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ITSELF PASSED<br />
AMENDMENTS TO THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION ACT TO DEAL<br />
WITH SOME OF THE PROBLEMS RAISED BY THIS CASE. IN ADDITION<br />
THE GOVERNMENT APPOINTED MR JUSTICE J. B. SWEENEY, ASSISTED<br />
BY MR [ fCGARVIE, AND MRK. D. MARKS, TO CONDUCT<br />
THE INQUIRY INTO THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE CASE. HIS HONOUR'S<br />
REPORT IS EXPECTED ABOUT THE END OF THIS MONTH.<br />
WE HAVE RECOGNISED FROM THE START THAT MODERN AND<br />
EFFICIENT PUBLIC TRANSPORT DEPENDS ON MODERN AND EFFICIENT<br />
ADMINISTRATION AND MODERN AND EFFICIENT UNIONS. THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS PLAYED ITS PART. ' IE HAVE BEEN GENEROUS WITH<br />
FUNDS AND GENEROUS WITH IDEAS AND INITIATIVES. WE LOOK<br />
CONFIDENTLY TO THE CO-OPERATION OF THE STATES AND YOUR GREAT<br />
UNION IN BRINGING ABOUT A NEW DEAL, LONG OVERDUE AND LONG<br />
AWAITED, FOR TRANSPORT IN OUR COUNTRY. </p>
