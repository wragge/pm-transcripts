CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
PARLIAMENTARY LUNCH FOR THE PRIME MINISTER OF<br />
PAPUA NEW GUINEA, MR PAIAS WINGTI<br />
CANBERRA 9 DECEMBER 1987<br />
It is my very great pleasure today to welcome you to<br />
Canberra on your first visit to Australia as Prime Minister.<br />
Australia and Papua New Guinea have a strong and a very<br />
special relationship, one which is firmly based on a shared<br />
history, a shared participation in the dynamic growth of the<br />
Western Pacific region and, most importantly, the warm<br />
friendship of our two peoples.<br />
My own association with and affection for Papua New Guinea<br />
date back to my involvement as ACTU advocate in a wage case<br />
for Local officers in 1965. Since then I have followed<br />
events in Papua New Guinea closely; and I made sure that<br />
Papua New Guinea was the first nation I visited after I<br />
became Prime Minister in 1983. I have since visited twice<br />
and had the pleasure on the last occasion of experiencing<br />
the pride with which Papua New Guineans entered their second<br />
decade of independence.<br />
Papua New Guinea has been an independent nation now for<br />
twelve years, and it is significant that you, Mr Prime<br />
Minister, are the first leader of a new generation of Papua<br />
New Guineans whose principal experience has been of<br />
independence.<br />
Throughout the South Pacific, nations are facing up to the<br />
new challenges of established membership of the worl'd<br />
community. In many of these nations, the issues now are<br />
concerned with complex economic management, sophisticated<br />
foreign policy choices and profound social questions.<br />
It is therefore natural that members of this generation<br />
should seek to redefine Papua New Guinea's place in the<br />
world and its key foreign relationships.<br />
That they should initiate such a wide-ranging document as<br />
the Joint Declaration of Principles guiding relations<br />
between Papua New Guinea and Australia is testimony to the<br />
strength of our ties in a new era. 00325(; </p>
<p>2.<br />
Mr Wingti and I signed that Declaration this morning.<br />
The Declaration represents the recognition by both our<br />
Governments of the enduring importance of the relationship<br />
between us and of the way in which that relationship is<br />
changing over the years.<br />
Its themes are mutuality, reciprocity and consultation.<br />
It stresses the sovereign equality of our two countries and<br />
the linkage between all elements in our relationship, so<br />
that decisions on any issue should be taken with due regard<br />
for the relationship as a whole. It spans the entire range<br />
of our contacts, which includes trade, investment,<br />
transport, communications, aid, defence, legal co-operation<br />
and border administration.<br />
It is, first and foremost, an intelligent document which<br />
confirms the worth of existing arrangements while opening<br />
the way for new arrangements to be concluded under its<br />
ambit.<br />
As part of measures to deepen our relationship I have been<br />
encouraging my Ministers to visit Papua New Guinea and would<br />
urge Papua New Guinean Ministers to visit Australia for<br />
regular discussions with their counterparts on issues of<br />
mutual interest.<br />
On economic issues, the direction and priorities of your<br />
economy are now of course firmly in Papua New Guinean hands.<br />
we applaud the progress made to date in defining those<br />
priorities, setting achievable targets and moving to<br />
implement them. we recognise the pressures on Papua New<br />
Guinea's economy and the urgency of developing strategies to<br />
meet the demands of a growing population with rising<br />
expectations. Australia has been and will continue to be a<br />
committed, responsible partner in Papua New Guinea's<br />
development. The Joint Declaration of Principles makes this<br />
plain even as it, rightly, removes " aid issues" from the<br />
centre of our bilateral stage.<br />
The way is open for Australia and Papua New Guinea to<br />
continue to engage in and promote fully co-operative<br />
activities of mutual benefit. For example we have just this<br />
month completed a jointly funded resource-mapping project<br />
between CSIRO and Papua New Guinea's Department of<br />
Agriculture and Livestock. Papua New Gu~ inea now possesses<br />
perhaps the most comprehensive store of information on its<br />
land resources of any developing country.<br />
The co-operative and friendly character of the ties between<br />
us assume even greater importance in view of the<br />
developments taking place in our region.<br />
Without in any sense being alarmist, I have said on a number<br />
of occasions that the South Pacific is now a less stable<br />
place than it was when my Government came to office in 1983.<br />
00325 </p>
<p>I refer to the uncertainty over the future of New Caledonia,<br />
the unwelcome interest displayed in our region by Libya, and<br />
of course the troubling implications of the two military<br />
coups in Fiji.<br />
My Government was dismayed at the events in Fiji and we have<br />
not as yet recognised any government in that country.<br />
I believe the coups have made much clearer the potential for<br />
regional instability and have consequently underlined the<br />
importance of countries such as Australia and Papua New<br />
Guinea cooperating closely to achieve our mutual goal of<br />
peace and prosperity in the region.<br />
We have cooperated in the efforts of our region to terminate<br />
nuclear testing at Mururoa Atoll, to resolve the problems in<br />
New Caledonia, and to bring into being the South Pacific<br />
Nuclear Free Zone Treaty.<br />
In all these efforts the South Pacific Forum, of which<br />
Australia and Papua New Guinea are members, has been a<br />
valuable sounding board for regional problems and a useful<br />
means of co-ordinating action to help solve those problems.<br />
In line with the view the Forum expressed in Apia, and in<br />
line with the Vancouver CHOGM, I took the opportunity of my<br />
recent visit to Moscow to ask Soviet leaders to ratify the<br />
Treaty of Rarotonga in a full and unambiguous fashion. They<br />
have said they will consider their position again.<br />
A strong and constructive relationship between Australia and<br />
Papua New Guinea both bilaterally and through institutions<br />
such as the South Pacific Forum is one of the essential<br />
requirements for the maintenance of peace and stability in<br />
the South Pacific.<br />
And this brings me again to the declaration Mr Wingti and I<br />
signed this morning. It marks a new phase in our relations<br />
with Papua New Guinea. Future discussions, like those this<br />
morning, will be between friends who are equal friends:<br />
fully consulting each other when common interests are<br />
involved; vigorous in making our point when we disagree;<br />
but strongly supporting each other on the much more numerous<br />
occasions when we agree. 003258 </p>
