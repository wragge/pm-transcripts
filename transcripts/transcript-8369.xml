TRANSFORMATION OF THE SO) VIET IN<br />
Australia has decided to recognise as independent states the<br />
eleven co-founders of the Commonwealth of Independent<br />
States. I know that the recent momentous events in the former Soviet<br />
Union are cause for great celebration for many Australian<br />
community groups as cherished dreams are, at last, realised.<br />
Their excit~ ement and joy is shared by all Australians.<br />
I warmly welcome the new community of nations to the<br />
international stage. The cooperation between the newly<br />
independent states and the peaceful and orderly transition<br />
to the new Commonwealth is to be commended. This harmonious<br />
beginning augurs well for the future of the Commonwealth and<br />
its relations with the international community.<br />
This new revolution would not have taken place without<br />
Mikhail Gorbachev. His role in the history of the late<br />
twentieth century has been decisive and he will undoubtedly<br />
be seen as one of the great figures of modern times.<br />
The people of Eastern Europe were the first to benefit from<br />
Mr Gorbachev's reforms and to experience freedom. Now the<br />
people of the former Soviet Union are also charting their<br />
own social, cultural and political course.<br />
Mr Gorbachev's foresight and courage also greatly<br />
contributed to the world becoming a safer place for<br />
everyone. The arms control agreements negotiated under his<br />
presidency will greatly reduce nuclear arsenals in both east<br />
and west. As a result, a spirit of goodwill and trust now<br />
prevails around the globe and the hands of the doomsday<br />
clock have been put back. I applaud Mr Gorbachev for his<br />
role in this transformation.<br />
I wish the leaders and people of the members of the new<br />
Commonwealth well in the tasks ahead as they welcome this<br />
historic new year.<br />
The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans,<br />
will issue a statement on the arrangements for Australian<br />
recognition.<br />
