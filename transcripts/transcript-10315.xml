24 April 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH FRAN KELLY AM PROGRAMME<br />
E O E<br />
FRAN KELLY:<br />
Prime Minister, there have been claims that you haven't even read the proposal of the<br />
Aboriginal negotiating team let alone considered it. What's causing the despondency<br />
within the Aboriginal team.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well that claim is wrong. Of course I've read it. I have spent the equivalent of<br />
probably two or three full days, or more, with the leaders of the Aboriginal community<br />
in Australia. I'm seeing them again. And I'd frankly be prepared to spend a week with<br />
them to if I thought through the process of further sitting down I could find a fair and<br />
acceptable solution. The plan that I've put forward represents a fair attempt by me and<br />
by my Government to do justice to the Aborigines because it doesn't involve blanket<br />
extinguishment of title, but also to deliver to the farmers of Australia something to<br />
which they are clearly entitled and that is security and predicability and something<br />
which they had every reason to believe would not even be questioned as a result of the<br />
1993 Native Title Act and as a result of the assurances given by Paul Keating, by some<br />
leaders of the National Farmers Federation three or four years ago and acknowledged<br />
by some of the very Aboriginal leaders with whom I am currently negotiating. Now,<br />
no person could have tried harder, no person will go on trying harder than I to get a<br />
fair solution to this. And I have a responsibility to all Australians, not just to the<br />
Aborigines, not just to the farmers, but I have a responsibility to all Australians. And I<br />
want to reject emphatically and absolutely the suggestion that I have ignored the views<br />
of the Aborigines. If I was indifferent to the Aborigines' views from day one I would<br />
have said that what we will do with the Wik decision is to overturn it absolutely and go<br />
back to the situation that people believed obtained after the 1993 Native Title Act. </p>
<p>The very fact that I have been willing to sit down and talk around these compromise<br />
issues to seek an arrangement which is fair to the Aborigines but also delivers that<br />
security, I think that is evidence of my and the bona fides of my Government.<br />
FRAN KELLY:<br />
But the Aboriginal negotiators say that you're 10 point plan is not fair. The National<br />
Party has also dismissed that plan. Are you sticking by plan as it currently stands?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I certainly am. And Fran, I think we all know in these things that sometimes<br />
things that are said publicly are expressed a little differently in private. I understand<br />
the pressures on some of the Aboriginal leaders. I also understand the feeling of<br />
despondency in rural Australia because the farmers of this country have had very tough<br />
times. They feel they were misled by the former government. They were given a<br />
highly impractical decision by the High Court of Australia. Now, I say that quite<br />
deliberately. The Wik decision was highly impractical, and I'm disappointed in the<br />
decision I said that on day one and it was a decision that went against the<br />
expectations even of some of the more vigorous Aboriginal leaders. And some of<br />
them have acknowledged to me that the decision was a surprise to them. Now, I<br />
understand that. I'm not seeking to exploit that. But I want to make the point that we<br />
are dealing with a situation where Wik overturned everybody's belief. And to the<br />
extent that out of all of this an arrangement might be reached whereby some of the<br />
Wik elements were preserved, then that obviously is something more than what many<br />
of the Aboriginal leaders of this country expected to have before the Wik decision was<br />
handed down.<br />
FRAN KELLY:<br />
But Prime Minister, just briefly because we'll move on to something else, but many<br />
people are describing your 10 point plan as extinguishment by stealth. I mean, why are<br />
you so confident that this plan would pass muster with the courts?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, anything ought to pass muster with the courts if it's the clearly expressed will of<br />
the Parliament. And we're dealing here with the right of the people through their<br />
Parliament to make the law of this country. The High Court interprets the law. The<br />
Parliament makes the law. And it's perfectly proper and in accordance with time<br />
immemorial practice for Parliament to change a law as currently interpreted by the<br />
High Court. But what is good about my plan is that it's fair. It doesn't disrespect<br />
native title, but it does deliver security and predictability and it makes the Nalii'e Title<br />
Act more workable and that's what I promised I would do in the 1996 election<br />
campaign. It is a fair plan and I hope that even in the face of a very difficult set of<br />
circumstances I can't conceive of a more difficult balancing act I hope that it can<br />
win the support not only of Aboriginal leaders but of others in the community whose<br />
support is needed. </p>
<p>FRAN KELLY:<br />
On another issue, cross-media laws are set to change. Would you countenance<br />
changes to the law that could allow one media proprietor to own, for example, the<br />
Fairfax newspaper empire as well as own and control a major national television<br />
company? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we're looking at that situation at the present time. My views about the crossmedia<br />
prohibitions are well known. I, in fact, expressed opposition to the cross-media<br />
prohibitions at a time when, for example, Mr Kerry Packer was publicly very closely<br />
associated with Bob Hawke when he was Labor Prime Minister of Australia going<br />
back to 1987. I mean I have a long history on the record. I've seen those rules as<br />
being a knee-jerk, vitriolic response by the Labor Party to the then Fairfax empire,<br />
which incidentally was bigger than a combination of a television station and the<br />
existing Fairfax newspapers. Because in 1987 the Fairfax empire, as I recollect it,<br />
included not only the Seven Television Network and the newspapers, but it also from<br />
my recollection included the Macquarie Radio Network. In fact, it was the largest<br />
media constellation that this country had seen. Now, Paul Keating set about<br />
destroying it or breaking it up because he had some bias against them. I mean, that's<br />
the origin of the cross-media rules.<br />
FRAN KELLY:<br />
Is it a bad thing to break it up though, given that people, a lot of people, think diversity<br />
is the issue here?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well all of that 1 mean, that's 10 years ago. But I think it's very important, when<br />
people are talking about motive and people are recollecting what happened and who<br />
did what to whom sort of thing, that the existing law, the cross-media thing, was<br />
inspired in by malice against the then Fairfax empire and also the old Herald and<br />
Weekly Times. Look, there are a lot of things to be taken into account. Your diversity<br />
argument is one of them. Another argument is the fact that in the modern age of<br />
convergence the idea of having cross-media prohibitions is ridiculous. The belief that<br />
there is some national benefit in having a very powerful fully Australian-based media<br />
company. If you are to have a presence in the region and a presence around the world,<br />
if you are to have a company that can sort of be in a sense a flag waver of Australia<br />
then you need a very very strong domestic base. The challenge of the internet to<br />
classified advertising, that's a relevant consideration, all of these things have to be<br />
taken into account and we said we'd review the laws. We don't have any<br />
commitments but I'm going to see and I know my colleagues will see that we take a<br />
decision that is in the overall national interest. </p>
<p>FRAN KELLY:<br />
Well given, just finally on this, given what you said then about a strong national<br />
presence, Australian presence, would you also.. will you not then consider relaxing the<br />
foreign ownership limits in tandem with changes to cross media rules?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well that's a proposition that's been put to us by a couple of..<br />
FRAN KELLY:<br />
I'm sure.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
the existing media proprietors. You know, I've had the odd telephone call, and I<br />
understand where they are coming from and they are entitled to put their point of view.<br />
There's a lot of sensitivity in this country about the existing level of foreign ownership.<br />
It's about 80% in newspapers and there's obviously some foreign presence already in<br />
two of the television.., what do I feel? I think what I feel ought first be communicated<br />
to my colleagues. I mean, the matter is under consideration, that's obvious. I don't<br />
make any secret about the fact that people like Mr Packer and co. come and put a<br />
point of view is entitled to, it's in a sense better that this thing be done in a more<br />
upfront way out in the open. He's got a point of view. He's not a person who's<br />
reluctant to put it. Mr Murdoch's not shy either. Others have put their views. The<br />
A. BC's put its view, the journalists put their view, they've all got to be taken into<br />
account. You've got to bear in mind that Australia is 18 million people. We are living<br />
in a global communications atmosphere and some of the old nostrums in this area are<br />
no longer valid.<br />
FRAN KELLY:<br />
Mr Howard we are running out of time, but a couple of quick questions, the budget<br />
process is almost wound up. There's been reports of a very heated exchange between<br />
you and the Treasurer Peter Costello last week because you overruled some of the cuts<br />
he intended to make, some of the savings. Is it true you stepped in to limit some of the<br />
cuts? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look I'm not going to talk about the process but I will say this, is that of course in any<br />
Budget you get disagreements and different points of view. We have disagreements<br />
and different points of view in every Cabinet meeting we have, every Cabinet meeting.<br />
It'd be a strange Cabinet of docile men and women if we didn't have some vigorous<br />
debates and disagreements but the budget outcome is one to which both Peter Costello<br />
and I will be very fully committed and in which we will very happily and with pride<br />
share ownership. </p>
<p>FRAN KELLY:<br />
And your relationship with Peter Costello?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Excellent. FRAN KELLY:<br />
Just one final question. An impressively low inflation rate yesterday, but still<br />
depressingly high unemployment. Would another interest rate cut do what's needed<br />
now to stimulate the economy and boost jobs growth?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I'm not going to speculate about further interest rate cuts, I don't think it helps<br />
but it is a brilliantly low inflation rate. We would be a very negligent 18 million people<br />
if we don't take advantage of this remarkable conjunction of economic good fortune.<br />
We have historically low inflation, historically low housing interest rates. We have by<br />
world standards quite strong economic growth, very strong business investment. We<br />
are living cheek by jowl with the fastest growing region in the world. We have been<br />
delivered may I say a very sensible living wage case decision by the industrial relations<br />
commission. It gives something to the battlers but it's not inflationary and I<br />
congratulate the commission for having delivered such sensible pro-Australian<br />
decision. Now with all of those things taken together the one depressing indicator<br />
does remain unemployment, I acknowledge that, it is always the last to move, but we<br />
do have so many circumstances in the palms of our hands to build a stronger and better<br />
economic future including increasing employment growth as we move towards the turn<br />
of the century. We would be a very negligent group of people if we don't fully take<br />
advantage of those extremely fortuitous circumstances.<br />
FRAN KELLY:<br />
It's in your hands isn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's in my hands but it is also collectively in the hands of the Australian people. We<br />
can give the leadership, provide the guide, I mean, we have kept inflation down, we<br />
have presided over falls in interest rates, we have very strong levels of business<br />
investment, we will deliver tight budgets, not cruel budgets but tight budgets and that's<br />
our obligation and we live in a very fast growing region and my Government is<br />
building very close links with the major players in that region. Next week the Prime<br />
Minister of our greatest trading partner, with whom I have a very good relationship<br />
Mr Hashimoto is coming to Australia. I've recently been to China, we have rebuilt<br />
relations with Malaysia, we continue the strong partnership with Indonesia which to<br />
their credit the former Government also continued. So we have a lot of things going<br />
for us at the moment and my message I guess to the Australian people is that we'll be </p>
