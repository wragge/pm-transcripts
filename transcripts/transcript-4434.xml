<p>PRIME MINISTER ON " MONDAY CONFERENCE"-4 JULY 1977<br />
MOORE Good evening, welcome to Monday Conference, this evening live,<br />
from a very chilly Canberra.<br />
Mr Fraser has just returned from his longest and most important<br />
visit abroad as Prime Minister. Most notably the Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government Conference, the European Economic Community,<br />
and Washington.<br />
Tonight an assessment of that tour. It is also what could be<br />
a half term -report onthe Fraser Government. With me to interview<br />
the Prime Minister are Maximillian Walsh, Editor of the Financial<br />
Review, 3 and the former head of the Canberra bureau of that paper;<br />
and Warren Beeby, the present Canberra bureau chief of News Ltd.<br />
and one of the journalists who accompanied the Prime Minister<br />
abroad.<br />
__ Prime Minister, what is it that you are saying to the E. E. C.<br />
countries are you saying that if they don't take our<br />
primary produce, and perhaps steel, then they don't get our<br />
uranium. PRIME MINISTER<br />
No, what we are saying is that they can't make rules just-to<br />
suit themselves, in the products that suit the European Community.<br />
We used to sell, about 60% of our trade used to go to Britain, and<br />
now the Common Market countries that is down to about<br />
14 or 1S%. It is down not because we produce less well, but<br />
because of the utterly restrictive policies that the Common<br />
Market has.<br />
MOORE Can I ask you if you think our uranium is going to change<br />
the ball-game, if I can put it that way. Is this a new stick<br />
to beat them with?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I think that is the wrong term. I think what we can do is<br />
point out that they want stability of access to raw materials,<br />
for energy, because Europe is short of its own energy supplies.<br />
It is fair enough to go on to point out that if they want<br />
stability of access to energy supplies, it is fair enough<br />
for stablility to apply to a total trade relationship.<br />
MOORE Is it your impression that. they will listen to us, that they really<br />
will take us setiously?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I think they have started to listenTh. eTreh wrewree efofuru oorr fiivve </p>
<p>hours of discussions with nine of the Commoln Market* commissioners,<br />
that then went onto another several hours of discussions between<br />
officials their officials and ours, and at the end of-all<br />
that time, I think they were starting to listen.<br />
In France, also, they were beginning to listen when I pointed<br />
out that we don't challenge your right to protect French<br />
farmers we know quite well what the problems are in the<br />
farming communities, it is a national responsibility, a<br />
European responsibility to protect those farming communities.<br />
But, having said that,' there is no need to do it in such a way<br />
that makes trade utterly impossible, and at the margin<br />
we can see ways in which the Common Agricultural policy<br />
could be modified not challenging your rights, not challenging<br />
the principles but then modified at the margin, which will<br />
enable some trade to take place. They seemed to respond to that,<br />
in I thought, a fairly forthright manner.<br />
MOORE, The inducement is what, uranium? The inducement<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
These things were not spoken of in the same voice. It was<br />
not an either/ or situation. Certainly the fact that they want<br />
energy supplies, enables us to make a point in relation to the<br />
principles that ought to apply to trade.<br />
MOORE Could I ask you this. Has there been now, enough public<br />
debate about uranium in Australia, -for you to make a decision on<br />
it. PRIME MINISTER<br />
The Labor Party seems to think so.<br />
MOORE That there has been, or has not been enough?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
That there has been enough. Aren't they going to make a<br />
decision on their policy?<br />
MOORE What do you think. Wle heard about the need for a public debate,<br />
when do we say, enough, it has been going long enough?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I would have though-lt that there has basically been adequate<br />
public debate. While I was away, departments were assessing<br />
the environmental reports, cabinet papers, have been prepared, and </p>
<p>we will start to examine these pretty shortly.<br />
* When Cabinet starts to examine an important issue it is<br />
always possible for the Cabinet to come to a view that<br />
the papers don't cover all the questions as-well as we want,<br />
and that therefore we would call for further reports.<br />
I think that is unlikely, and I can't see any reasons why<br />
decisions should not be made fairly shortly.<br />
MOORE How shortly, could you put a number of days on that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I have said before that the decisions could certainly be made<br />
before August.<br />
MOORE Have you made up your own mind, personally, by this stage?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I am going to examine all the papers, but the input of<br />
what has happened in Europe has certainly been valuable in<br />
this process.<br />
We have also got, as you know, a safeguards team in Europe<br />
explaining our safeguards policy to the Europeans, getting their<br />
reaction to that, and it has been very useful for me to know<br />
how the Europeans look at this particular matter.<br />
WALSH Mr Fraser, one input that you can't get from your experts<br />
is the political input. What do you think the political climate<br />
is in Australia towards uranium mining and export?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
The majority of people would be in favour of it.<br />
WALSH A large majority? Do you see it as a serious political is * sue<br />
or do you see it as an issue which has attracted a great<br />
deal of attention, but which does not really engage the<br />
attention of most of the community?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I think people are concerned about uranium I am quite<br />
certain that people would want to know that if the Government<br />
makes a decisions to export, that the safeguards policies<br />
are going to be very strictly applied. There is a problem<br />
about proliferation, that is why there is an international<br />
treaty, that is why in our own safeguards policy, which I think </p>
<p>is probably the strictest of any exporting country at this point,<br />
we would insist on bi-lateral treaties, with any country that<br />
might become a customer of ours. These are matters that ought<br />
to he taken very seriously, and President Carter is completely and<br />
utterly right in focussing world attention to very difficult<br />
problems. I believe that, certainly at this stage, and<br />
before the fuel cycle evaluation study is complete, he is<br />
right in trying to keep the countries that have got nuclear<br />
power for peaceful purposes away from the plutonium economy.<br />
WALSH Just, on that safeguards. They are a subject which, while<br />
you were away, was reported, there is some confusion as to<br />
whether the safeguards will -allow the export of yellow-cake<br />
or would require uranium yellow-cake to be benefitiated<br />
further. Could you clear me up on that? Do you fell that<br />
yellow-cake is what we are talking about exporting, or<br />
are you seeing uranium being enriched to a greater extent than<br />
yellow-cake?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I think there has been some comment in your own journal about that.<br />
WALSH That is . correct.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
It is our view that it would be possible to export the<br />
yellow-cake form, but for ownership, not to change hands,<br />
until it has been enriched to the appropriate point, to a<br />
point that attracts full safeguards. That is one way of<br />
doing it, it is not necessarily the only way of doing it.<br />
If there is export, one of the decisions we have to make<br />
* is whether enrichment facilities are established in Australia<br />
and if so, do we do it by ourselves, do we do it in cooperation<br />
with one or two countries, do we do it in cooperation with<br />
a larger group of countries. If thadt decision is made, one<br />
of the governing principles would be which is the safest<br />
way from the point of view of proliferation.<br />
MOORE If you decided not to export uranium, what would be the<br />
repercussions in the United States,, and in the European countries<br />
with whom you have been dealing?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I-think it would be serious, because Europeans are short of<br />
energy, they were desperately upset and their economies hurt<br />
as a result of the oil crisis much more than ours was, and<br />
for reasons that we know: we have got a degree of our own<br />
self-sufficiency in oil. So they need energy supplies. </p>
<p>Unless they can get new sources of uranium there is no<br />
doubt that a number of European countries are going to<br />
go very smartly into reproccssing, into the plutonium economy.<br />
That is taking nuclear power for peaceful purposes much closer<br />
to the edge of military technology, and therefore making<br />
it harder for appropriate safeguards to prevail. It is also<br />
making the problem of nuclear waste more difficult, because the<br />
waste from the second stage development of nuclear power<br />
as I understand it, is the much more difficult waste to store.<br />
MOORE What I really meant-is what do you think would be the consequences<br />
for their political attitudes towards Australia? Do you think<br />
they would feel let-down, mislead, disappointed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I mentioned that it is important from the point of view<br />
of'keeping Europe away from the plutonium economy, therefore<br />
away-from military technology. I think that if we said there<br />
is no export, many European countries, would feel that this<br />
is a very resource-rich country, not only in uranium, but<br />
also in coal, and compared to many of them also in oil, and in<br />
gas. They would regard that as rather a selfish use of<br />
resources, which are necessary to keep the lights in their homes<br />
burning,. to keep their factories operating, to keep their<br />
people employed.<br />
BEE BY<br />
Access to markets is a two-way thing. If we withhold our<br />
uranium, are we then going to invite retaliation against<br />
Australia PRIME MINISTER<br />
I think the European Economic Community have just about done<br />
all the retaliation in advance they can, so far as Australia's<br />
exports are concerned. I used the figures earlier<br />
to 60% of our exports used to go to Britain and Europe<br />
now it is 14% or 15%, and that is very largely as a result<br />
of the Common Agricultural Policies, and they used to be<br />
able to get away with that degree of protectionism, I believe,<br />
when it was reslated to agriculture alone. They could say<br />
it was agriculture, and they would plead a special case.<br />
Btit in recent times they have started'to apply that policy<br />
to motorbikes frolfh Japan, to balibearings, to steel from Japan,<br />
to steel from Australia they wanted to apply it, although<br />
I believe they won't. Even though they supplied 95% or so<br />
of their total steel requirements they had no hesitation in<br />
putting 50% cuts on Japan and South Africa. </p>
<p>WALSH Doesn't this invite the very proposition, the obvious<br />
proposition, that we arc behaving in exactly the same fashion,<br />
with other countries, developing countries of Asia thcy<br />
have pointed this out in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines,<br />
have all made specific complaints about our protectionist<br />
-behaviour. You used the expression I think that you said that<br />
the Europeans seem to think that anything that hurts their<br />
industry is unfair. It seems to me that we are liable<br />
to be attached to the same charge as that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I don't think so at all. I think it would be a very good<br />
thing to examine some of the facts and figures of our<br />
trading relationship with the ASEAN wuntries. I don't<br />
know how many people realise that. Singapore is inning a<br />
balance of payments surplus with us, and in recent times has<br />
been running a balance of trade surplus in addition..<br />
I don't think we want too many figures, but just one or<br />
two to demonstrate this point, because a great<br />
deal has been written about the unreasonable way that Australia<br />
treats her trading partners in the ASEAN countries.<br />
I think this is unfortunate because it then gets rewritten in<br />
Malaysia, and Singapore, taken verbatum out. of Australian<br />
journals and I know it is done in good faith and for<br />
proper motives, I don't challenge that I just think<br />
that it is misdirected, on the facts I think it is misdirected.<br />
In recent years ASEAN's penetration of our markets has<br />
been increasing at the rate of about 29% a year, our exports<br />
to then have been increasing at a much lesser rate than thatif<br />
the present rates of increase continue, there is every<br />
likelihood that they will there will be a balanced trade<br />
in 1983 or 1984 between ASEAN and Australia, and the unfavourable<br />
ratio from their point of view has already been greatly<br />
diminished. In areas that are sensitive footwear, textiles,,<br />
and these things, we have lost in recent years maybe<br />
40,000 jobs, directly as a result of imports since import<br />
quotas were put on. In clothing and textiles we have had<br />
further increases of 37% and 69% increases from these<br />
particular countries. Just one other set of figures:<br />
In total manufactures from these countries, Australia takes<br />
in dollars a head $ 6.55; Japan $ 2.77; Ameria, somewhere in between;<br />
Canada $ 1.97, so in terms of dollars a head we take far<br />
more imports from them than other developed countries.<br />
But take it into the most sensitive areas textile apparel<br />
and footwear: Australia, $ 2.18 per head from these countries;<br />
the United States $ 0.63; Japan, $ 0.25; and Canada $ 0.41;<br />
the European Community $ 0.37.<br />
WA Lf I1<br />
Interjection -inaudible<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Yes, but they arc also sensitive to the United States and to<br />
Japan, but in the sensitive areas, their penetration of the<br />
Australian market, they have got more access here than they do </p>
<p>in any other developed country.<br />
WALSH But the point is, to use your own analogy, is there<br />
are sensitive areas in Europe when they talk about Japanese<br />
motorcars; their sensitive areas in the United States, they<br />
talk about Japanese television sets. For Australia to have<br />
sensitive areas all to its own is quite unreasonable if you<br />
are going to talk in the international context of trade<br />
which you do repeatedly. We preside at the OECD Ministeral<br />
Meeting, and we signed a communique which extolled the<br />
virtues of lowering protection, of not pursuing the very<br />
policies which this government is pursuing.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I think you misunderstood me. Because, the figures that<br />
I quoted showed that our imports from the ASEAN countries<br />
of the goods that tend to disrupt local employment are far<br />
higher than would be allowed in other developed countries.<br />
Australia in this area has a much more open market thafi the<br />
other countries I mentioned, much more open than Japan, the<br />
United States, Canada or the European Community.<br />
I don't think we would do our own cause much good when we<br />
just ignore that fact, and imply that we are high protectionists<br />
and don't allow trade their trade has been increasing<br />
at 29% a year. That is a pretty hefty penetration into<br />
our markets, and especially at a time, as you know, of<br />
signficant unemployment in sectors of manufacturing industry.<br />
WALSHBut, let's not argue about the whys and wherefores of it,<br />
but just to look into another area. Do you feel that the<br />
ASEAN countries are perhaps ganging up on us, that they<br />
feel we should be more open, simply because we are closer,<br />
and we are rich, and that they see us as having a particular<br />
relationship with that area, which those other countries<br />
you referred to do not?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
They have, I think, got a particular relationship with us,<br />
which is a much closer one than it would be with a number of<br />
other countries geography, history, have certainly<br />
led to that. But, at the Commonwealth Heads of Government<br />
Meeting there was time for quite considerable discussions<br />
with* Prime Minister Hussein Onnt Prime Minister Lee, and I<br />
started to recount-to them some of the facts and figures<br />
of our trade. I think a lot of people have in fact accepted<br />
what has been written that Australia is a closed market<br />
and does not allow access for these goods into our markets.<br />
If you look at' the particular goods, we have been allowing<br />
access at a rate that has in fact been causing considerable<br />
disruption to Australia's own industries. I think it is<br />
quite plain that no country can go on with industries in a<br />
static state, they have got to grow, they have got to change </p>
<p>4<br />
as time passes. But I think also, people would realise that<br />
there is a limit to the rate of change that can take place I<br />
without unreasonable social and economic disruption. I l<br />
believe that the rate of penetration'into our markets,<br />
at a growth rate of 29% a year, is about as high a rate as<br />
you can encompass, especially when most of that growth rate<br />
is coining into areas that are sensitive from an employment<br />
point of view in Australia. We have not said, no, there will<br />
be no trade. If we had been behaving like the European<br />
Economic Community in these areas, we would have just said<br />
no trade at all. Let me just give you the figures again, or<br />
put them in a different manner: the annual growth rate<br />
since 1970-71, the annual growth rate, on the figures I have<br />
been given by my Department is: clothing 134%, footwear 110%,<br />
furniture 94%, electrical machinery 88%, other machinery 159%.<br />
These have been annual growth rates, and I know they started<br />
from a low base..<br />
WALSH I was going to say You can quote these figures, you<br />
have got an advantage on us<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
. but wait a minute, it is obvious that I would analyse this<br />
situation because I read what The Financial Review says,<br />
on these particular matters, and I have been reading it for mnonths.-.<br />
MOORE But I suppose the question has to be asked, Prime Minister,<br />
that allowing for that high level of penetration in footwear<br />
and clothing in particular, surely soon it is going to<br />
become politically impossible for an Australian Government<br />
to allow that rate to continue. So from a Malaysian point of<br />
vie, it is all very well, but what they are worried about<br />
I imagine is, that where does the ceiling come, and it must<br />
in political terms, be soon in Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Even since quotas have come on, imports from these countries<br />
in a number of areas have continued to rise, even where there<br />
are import quotas. L<br />
WALJSHI But not the totality of imports, couldn't have, I mean the<br />
very nature of<br />
PRIMIE MINISTER<br />
No, but from ASEAN countries. That is what You were originally<br />
talkimng aboult.<br />
IVA L. S! I<br />
Th ait is right, because they can mark those goods tip further, I mr </p>
<p>it is one of the problems of their quotas quite obviously<br />
as you are going to bring in the cheapest and sell at the<br />
highest prices. If you have got a quota you can'do<br />
whatever you want with it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I don't think anyone likes quotas, but at the same time<br />
it gets back to the rate of economic and social change,<br />
and there is a rate beyond which it can't be allowed to occur<br />
in any country. I believe that the ASEAN countries will<br />
well understand this, I am looking forward to discussions<br />
with them when that next occurs, so that we can go through<br />
these things in detail. The discussions with Hussein. Onn and<br />
with Prime Minister Le'e were the most cordial and friendly<br />
discussions between neighbours and between friends.<br />
There is nothing but a wish between both of them, and I am<br />
sure the rest * of the ASEAN countries and Australia,. to advance<br />
the totality of the relationship, not just trade, but the<br />
totality of the relationship, and I believe we are doing that.<br />
WALSH Don't you get the impression, I am only asking this<br />
as to whether you do get the impression, that within the<br />
ASEAN group there is a younger echelon of people coming through<br />
who have started to coordinate their economic aims, and they<br />
are taking aim at Australia to begin with, and that the<br />
kindly references made by the Prime Minister of Malaysia<br />
and by the Prime Minister of Singapore aren't really representative<br />
of that changing mood within the ASEAN structure, because l<br />
we do, in the Financial Review, quote these peoplewe<br />
don't invent them it does exist, and there have been<br />
-retaliatory moves, in statements made by the Philippines and<br />
by Malaysia,<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I think there is some equivocation about recent events<br />
in Malaysia but I am not sure that it is a good thing<br />
to pursue individual..<br />
WALSH You don't feel there is any change of mood there about Australia,<br />
you feel L<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
No I don't. But one of the things I do think we need to do is<br />
make sure that the" facts and figures of the trade are properly<br />
understood. Let me say it with all the kindliness in the world:'<br />
when a journal like'the'Financial Review writes that we are </p>
<p>being unfair in our trading relationships 4with Malaysia<br />
or Singapore, that gets reprinted in the newspapers<br />
and naturally they believe it, they believe it you see.<br />
And then if it's Australians saying that Australians are<br />
not behaving in a fair and proper way*, they must think there<br />
is something wrong that needs altering.<br />
WALSH I think it is disgraceful what you have to pay for shoes<br />
here and what you have to pay elsewhere. I think the consumers<br />
of Australia are being had a lend of<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
. what you have to spend for a car here, what you would have<br />
to spend for a car in the United States.<br />
W~ ALSH<br />
Well it is and you run the motor plan<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
But the base market for reasonably sophisticated indus try<br />
is 14 million people, compared to 260 million<br />
in Europe. There is no way you can run your manufacturing<br />
industry on the same general levels of protection and<br />
survive. No way, but we still allow significant market<br />
penetration. WA L SH<br />
Isn't it surely, when you admit that, that you have to<br />
look towards ways of changing your industrial structure, you<br />
are putting the very argument forward that you should allow<br />
change you should allow specilisation, you should allow<br />
the market place to work. All you are doing is halting the<br />
process, and meaning that we are going to hold those prices<br />
forever. / 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Things are being overstated. You say ' halting the process'. I<br />
said a few moments ago that there has to be change. Things are<br />
7not static; but that the rate of change has to be reasonable<br />
otherwiise the economic and social disruption become much too<br />
great. But the argument that you are putting could be related<br />
in these terms.. Let goods come in without any duties at all and<br />
then see what happens in Australia. Well, you would have unemployment<br />
at quite intolerable levels. It is much too high now. What would<br />
happen to unemployment under those circumstances would be grie vious<br />
indeed. There is another element in this which also needs to be<br />
understood. I made the point about a market of 14 million people<br />
and with that as a base you do need in my view higher levels of<br />
protection than if you have a base market of 260 million as the<br />
wealthy countries of Europe have. But what we can do in relation<br />
to ASEAN or developing countries generally is also limited by other<br />
factors, and one of those is the access we get to other markets<br />
around the world. If we are cut out of markets in Europe for<br />
significant goods, if therefore large sectors of Australia, as<br />
they now are, are very much depressed all the beef areas are<br />
utterly depressed -that does limit what we can do in other areas<br />
of trade. It weakens our total economy. Therefore relationships<br />
in trade between ASEAN and Australia are not just you cannot<br />
look at that in isolation.<br />
WALSH I accept that.<br />
MOORE I would like to move back in time to the beginning of the<br />
Commonwealth Conference. For those of us at home the big<br />
issue was the question of apartheid in sport and your alleged<br />
spat with Prime Minister Muldoon. There seems to be, as far as<br />
I can make out, some confusion as to the precise meaning of the<br />
statement on apartheid in sport some question as to whether it<br />
Gapplies to only teams from South Africa, or individual sportsmen<br />
as well. How do you see it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
There is a complete understanding that our policy as it is<br />
fits the Commonwealth statement. The Commonwealth statement<br />
was a long statement. It was accommodating a number of points<br />
of view, and I think a number of people changed their attitudes<br />
in relation to it. I think it is very important to note that<br />
from the African point of view the significant word is " discourage'<br />
and not ' Prohibit'. Many African countries or Caribbean countries<br />
were earlier tending to demand the word ' prohibit'. The communique<br />
or the document ended up with the word ' discourage'. So it was<br />
really around that that agreement was built. If somebody, or a<br />
team is representinfg South Africa, under our policy as it was,<br />
under our policy as it is, if they are coming representing South<br />
Africa they would not' get a visa. That is to some extent a firmer<br />
/ pol icy </p>
<p>12<br />
policy than one that some other countries pursue. But if<br />
there is an individual coming, just being an individual<br />
MOORE I am sorry Prime Minister the statement does refer to ' national'-<br />
that is the word it uses ' sporting contacts between their nationa,--&gt;<br />
and the nationals of countries practising apartheid'.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Yes, I know that, but it also says ' sporting contacts of<br />
significance' and I had long discussions with Prime minister<br />
Manley about these particular matters. Our policy is understood.<br />
Our policy was not in question. Our policy was not under<br />
challenge, and it is not under challenge now. I again<br />
described our policy and I said that it fits that particular__<br />
document. MOORE So you read no significance into the word ' nationals'?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
You have to look at ' sporting contacts of significance'. But<br />
you also have to look at the word I'icorg bcuewhen<br />
you use a visa power you are going way beyond discouraging.<br />
You are prohibiting, and the policy in fact does not aequire<br />
prohibition. BEEBY Prime minister, the whole wrangle over the sports/ apartheid<br />
issue centred on New Zealand, and within minutes of the relase<br />
of the Gleneagles statement Mr. Muldoon was saying that his<br />
policy fitted the statement. How can this be and-what prospect fl<br />
does that have of saving the Commonwealth Games next year?<br />
PRIM4E MINISTER<br />
I believe the Commonwealth Games will take place. Pierre<br />
Trudeau believes they will take place,. and I believe most of<br />
the countries of Africa believe they will take place.<br />
This was the general feeling of the meeting. There was<br />
a general wish that those Edmonton-Games would continue.<br />
I am here to answer for Australia's policy but I think it<br />
is fair enough if you restrict me to that.<br />
WALSHL Bcyond spoit Mr. Fraser it seems to me that you underwent<br />
something of an appalling conversion en route to London, as<br />
before you got there I had never heard you use the expression<br />
Zimbabwe, and I do not think I havc! ever heard you speak of*<br />
Namibia. During the course of your tour you raised the subjects<br />
use~ d these words not only in London actually at the Commonwealt],<br />
Conference where it was of some interest, but even at the 1 hite<br />
House, whereas your previous preoccupation with foreign policy<br />
had been far removed from Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia. When<br />
did this conversion take place, or don't you think it has?<br />
/ PRIME MINISTER </p>
<p>-13-<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I think that you should -maybe you have -read a speech I made<br />
when Mrs. Suzrnan was out here from South Africa Dr. Helen<br />
Suzman and one I made in New Guinea at a dinner that Prime<br />
Minister Somare gave, where many similar views were expressed,<br />
and also there was an IPU meeting where somewhat similar views<br />
were also expressed. So, altogether those events go back over a<br />
considerable period, certainly to the period<br />
WALSH That is not that long.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Over eighteen months, two years. Two years because the first<br />
instance I mentioned was when we were still in opposition.<br />
C WALSH I do not want to press it but it seems to me that you have shifted<br />
your ground -or you may have matured if you want to use that<br />
expression -in the period of the last decade. You had no<br />
interest in..<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Good heavens I would hope so, in the period of the last decade.<br />
That is a long time, ten years, and if somebody is going to be<br />
a politician and at the end of one ten year period end upwith<br />
precisely the same views as he had at the beginning of the period,<br />
not modified, changed or adapted at all as a result of changing<br />
circumstances you are going to be a fairly sterile politician.<br />
WALSH How about the last eighteen months, when you first came in?<br />
When you first went abroad you were preoccupied and concerned<br />
with Russian influences in the Indian Ocean, and you went to<br />
great lengths to quote from NATO reports to demonstrate the reason<br />
we should be concerned about this. Do you still regard that as a<br />
major preoccupation of your foreign.. policy, as it evidently was<br />
then; and when you went to NATO, when you went, to Europe, did you<br />
have any fears about the continuation of NATO itself and the<br />
possibilities of a socialist/ communist government in France and<br />
the impact that that would have upon NATO?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I would like to back-track for a moment or two. I do not think<br />
there was a preoccupation with the Indian Ocean. I think there<br />
has been a preoccupation in some aspects ' of Australian thought in<br />
relation to it, and maybe I did not explain myself as well as I<br />
should have., But th'e words used in the 1 June speech of a year<br />
ago when the subject was I think probably first introduced, I<br />
believe were moderate, and low-key, as they were meant to be.<br />
our policy for a long while has been balance at the lowest possible<br />
level. The Indian Ocean to me has always been a symptom of the<br />
Soviet Union's build up in arms and capacity to reach out anywhere<br />
in the world. It is not an event in itself. It is a symptom<br />
of a global Soviet power. Now in NATO headquarters I found the<br />
very same concerns expressed to me in verbal terms by both civilian'-<br />
personnel and military personnel, and indeed the Soviet Union is,. </p>
<p>-14-<br />
spendin. g between 13% and 15% of gross domestic product on arms<br />
every year. Now that is an enormous amount. It must be of<br />
concern. It is of concern to the countries of Europe. It is<br />
of concern to us. But in the global context, and the Indian Ocean<br />
is part of that, it is not a specific and isolated instance,-<br />
I would have no real concern about the future of-NATO..-Or, put<br />
it another way around, I found no evidence-to suggest that NATO<br />
will not continue as a vigorous force, and as a quite vital entity.<br />
oI now pthte prolblehms witah eEuro-cocmmrunism ein Italy sor France. or in<br />
WALSH Did you discuss that with President Carter, the state of Europe,<br />
and NATO?<br />
PRIME MINISTER.*<br />
Not so much, but the br6ad global issues were discussed. I had<br />
already discussed NATO and the state of Europe while I was in<br />
Europe, and there were close exchanges. I do not think there was<br />
much difference in view in relation to it.. President Carter had<br />
discussed more the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean because<br />
I think he wanted to assure us about consultations. We know<br />
precise details of the present approaches with the Soviet Union,<br />
-and<br />
j I have every confidence that Australian interests and concerns<br />
will be fully considered in the process of further discussions with<br />
the Soviets.<br />
IMOORE<br />
Prime Minister could I take us back to Zimbabwe sorry just to<br />
back-track<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I wanted to get back to that because there is one point that I<br />
want to make and I have not, and maybe your question will<br />
MOORE To me the crunch issue-is what your attitude is towards the<br />
C' guerilla movement, the liberation front, or whatever. Where<br />
do we stand on, if you like, violence? Do we acknowledge it,<br />
condone it, support it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
It is acknowledged that it is there. It is acknowledged that it<br />
is one of the pressures on Ian Smith's regime, but we do not<br />
condone it, and we do not support the use of violence, and I<br />
think that view is basically the same as Britain's and Canada's<br />
and also New Zealand's. But it is a fact of life. It is also<br />
a fact of life that if majority rule does not come in Zimbabwe<br />
there will be more violence. For twelve or thirteen years people<br />
have been negotiating.' Britain has been saying ' we will get to<br />
majority rule through negotiations'. At the Conference, Prime<br />
Minister Callaghan said that Zimbabwe will be seated at the next<br />
Commonwealth Conference. What is that in a bit less than two<br />
year's time. If it is not, I believe that the confidence people<br />
have in negotiations will be shattered. There are a number of<br />
Africans now who say, ' all right, we accept what you say about<br />
/ negotiations </p>
<p>15<br />
negotiations, but it is up to you to make them work; we do<br />
not really believe that you can'. The African countries as<br />
you know support, as they call it, the Freedom Fighters.<br />
MOORE Supposing Rhodesia does not become Zimbabwe in fact by the<br />
next Commonwealth Conference, and it, looks as if Ian Smith<br />
is absolutely recalcitrant will do nothing to ease the wayand<br />
the African members of the Commonwealth do call on Australia<br />
and other countries for moral, absolutely open moral supportperhaps<br />
military support. What would you think of that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
That is a long way down the track, and before then'T think people<br />
have to do everything they can to see that there is majority rule.<br />
One of the things that will help, even if only marginally, but<br />
marginal pressures ultimately end up in being successful is<br />
that if that minority government comes to realise that there is<br />
no sympathy amongst governments anywhere in the world, then that<br />
itself is another pressure. That is one of the reasons why I<br />
believe it is important for Australia to have spoken with a<br />
clear voice. One of the things which I think has led to the<br />
continuing acceptance of the object of getting to a result by<br />
negotiation is President Carter's support for human rights, much<br />
greater support for what Britain is doing in Africa, than the<br />
United States has ever given before; and therefore there is a<br />
renewed belief on the part of African leaders who want a moderate<br />
solution, who would like to get to the result by negotiation,<br />
that maybe this road will be successful after all. But I<br />
do believe that there is a limited time left for this particular<br />
track to be successful. Because if negotiations are continually<br />
put off there is no doubt that more and more people will embrace<br />
violence, and violence alone, as a solution to the problem.<br />
If that happens it would leave Africa open to all kinds of<br />
influences that basically are not there. Or if they are<br />
there at the moment, only on the margin.<br />
BEEBY Prime Minister, at the end of the Commonwealth Conference, the<br />
communique came out, and you dissociated Australia from two<br />
points.. one you just mentioned was support for guerilla action<br />
in Zimbabwe. The other was for a zone of peace in the Indian<br />
Ocean. Could you explain why you dissociated us from that<br />
concept in the Indian Ocean?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I dissociated us from some words which might have been an implied<br />
criticism of the United States developing the base at Diego Garcia.<br />
Because we had supported that in the past and believed then, and<br />
believe now, that that facility is necessary in the pursuit of<br />
balance in the Indian Ocean. It is worth nothing I think that<br />
President Carter's approach to the Soviets is based on stabilising<br />
the situation as it is, as a first step. If there can be<br />
agreement about that, they would then see what could happen / beyond </p>
<p>-16-<br />
beyond that. I felt it would be quite wrong to-go along with<br />
words that might be construed as being critical of that United<br />
States activity. I explained that to the Conference at the time.<br />
I think that our view was well known. It was understood in the<br />
Conference. There was a friendly exchange of vi ews and attitudes<br />
between ourselves and one or two others who pursued a different<br />
view, but it was all done in very good humour.<br />
BEEBY In Washington you discussed this again with President Carter, and<br />
were given an assurance that you would be consulted about what<br />
develops in these talks between Russia and America on the future<br />
of the Indian Ocean. Will these discussions take place before<br />
America and Russia come to a decision.?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
They already had. I think the first talks with the Soviet Union<br />
were virtually taking place about the time I was in Washington.<br />
There had already been free exchanges of views between our own<br />
officials. We had put our own views down on paper, and we knew<br />
the sort of view that was being put by the United States to the<br />
Soviet Union. That consultation will be a continuing process.<br />
WALS H<br />
Could I just take you into another area of your visit altogether<br />
which might lead us into the domestic affairs side. Prior to<br />
your departure there was considerable publicity given to the<br />
statements by some of your Ministerial colleagues. One of the<br />
reasons investment was not flowing into Australia was some concern<br />
with our industrial climate. Did you find this reflected<br />
overseas?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
There is a concern about industrial relations in Australia. I<br />
was able to point out to people that in the first few months of<br />
this year industrial disputes were much less than they had been<br />
for seven or eight years. Obviously that was a short time frame<br />
in which to make any permanent judgements. I pointed out that.<br />
there had been significant changes to industrial law some already<br />
operating maybe more changes to come. But people are well aware<br />
of the fact that a good deal of industrial disputation has come in<br />
areas that affect export trade the Pilbara, coal industry or<br />
shipping. '! hat the maritime unions are I think demanding at<br />
the moment~ or may be going to demand in relation to the export of<br />
coal carried in Australian-manned ships, could have dramatic and<br />
far reaching effects on Australian trade overseas. This is being<br />
examined very closely by Commonwealth departments at the moment.<br />
I may well have to be in touch with the Premiers about it,<br />
because at least three states are very significantly affectednot<br />
only Queensland, but New South Wales and Western Australia.<br />
I do not believe anf of those Premiers would welcome a situation<br />
in which the cost advantage of contracts of Australia were outweighed<br />
by shipping costs, that no new contracts were written; and<br />
people ought to look very closely at the Utah decision to suspend<br />
operations in Norwich Park pending resolution of this issue. It is<br />
a very serious matter. AVALS11 </p>
<p>t!. ALSI!<br />
But what could be done at the State Premier level? Just<br />
make political noises?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
No, I do not think so. Because the states are very much involved<br />
and if there were a common view with Mr. Wran and ourselves and<br />
others in relation to it then I think it is possible to talk<br />
with people, and hopefully to get a sensible result. This<br />
matter was raised briefly at the Premiers Conference. I put<br />
people on notice that I might have to be in touch with them<br />
about it, because potentially it is a very serious issue indeed.<br />
I have no doubt that some investments into Austra'lia have been<br />
delayed while people look at these particular matters. When I<br />
was in the United States a year ago people said what is the<br />
question of industrial relations? They certainly said it again<br />
on this occasion.<br />
WALSH But has it been a serious impediment to what you put forward<br />
as your economic strategy at the last election of an investmentled<br />
recovery, or is it a bit of a marginal impact?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I think it has probably had quite a significant effect, but I<br />
am-not f or one moment seeking to.-I would not want that to be<br />
regarded as trying to make an excuse. I think it has had a<br />
significant effect. But I also need to say that while those<br />
words ' investment-led recovery' were used in one document on one<br />
occasion, there are many facets to a recovery, and that is just<br />
taking one part of it.<br />
WALSH It was a very important element of it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
An important element of it. But I do not think you can look at<br />
it and say recovery is going to come from investment alone, or<br />
something else alone, or consumer spending alone<br />
WALSHIl Where do you think it is going to come from?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
It will come from the totality<br />
WALSH W~ here will it come from now? Of course it is going to come<br />
from various impacts, but at this stage, half-way through the<br />
first Fraser Government, we have as the Labor Government was<br />
at pains to point out today higher unemployment than we had.<br />
when Fraser came to power. We have inflation still in double<br />
digit figures.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I do not believe we have for one minute. / AS </p>
<p>-18-<br />
WALSH What? Inflation into double digit figures?<br />
PRIME MINISTERNo.<br />
I do not.<br />
WALSH well, the last figures that we had from the CPI were 10.9%<br />
after we fiddle around with Medibank, and I do not think you<br />
have any better knowledge than I do on that. You are saying<br />
that the June figures are going to take you down there.<br />
That may be true, but they are just not available yet.<br />
PRIME MINISTIER<br />
If you look at the March quarter figures, and I know that is<br />
only one quarter, but many experts had said it would-be a very<br />
bad quarter and obviously I was delighted to be able to find that<br />
the experts were wrong on that occasion. Inflation is coming<br />
down. I think we can agree on that point. And coming down<br />
very significantly. There is no point in arguing about one<br />
percentage point one way or another.<br />
WALSH Unemployment is the sticky problem..<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
The unemployment problem is serious, and as you know there are<br />
a number of training programmes and special programmes designed<br />
to help young people. These programmes will be continuing.<br />
Tony Street had discussions in Britain to see if we can learn<br />
from their experience because they have to a significant extent<br />
the same problem. They have a number of programmes and I would<br />
not want to get into the details of them here.<br />
WALSH But you think<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
No dQ not go drawing out conclusions. All we were saying<br />
was that he was looking at United Kingdom experience, and<br />
European experience to that matter, to see if there is anything<br />
we can learn f rom them. I think his view tended to be thatL<br />
Australia has done better when many countries may be better than L<br />
Britain in this particular area. But while he was over there,<br />
it was obviously something that he ought to look at.<br />
I just want to make one important point about unemployment. FW<br />
We have got into a situation in which there has been very<br />
considerable increase in wages in Australia in recent years.<br />
Lower paid people are more highly paid relatively I think than<br />
they have been in previous times in Australia's history. There<br />
are-strong indications that people are moving into the period<br />
where, instead of employing unskilled people, they are buying<br />
new machines, better machines, and therefore employing less<br />
people. Even though companies are in a better profit position / they are </p>
<p>19<br />
they are still probably pursuing this particular process at<br />
the present time. With the rate of escalation in wages, especially<br />
at the lower wage levels, you have a situation I think that is<br />
going to make it very difficult to get unemployment down in the<br />
way all Australians would want. This is a new factor. It has not<br />
been adequately recognised in Australia as one of the major causes<br />
of continuing high unemployment. But I think it is something that<br />
is going to be with us, and it might-be the reason, or one of the<br />
reasons, why unemployment in the United States has for many years<br />
been higher than Australia was used to. Because they had moved<br />
into the higher wage situation with their lower skilled people.<br />
BEEBY In West Germany Prime Minister at a meeting with German investors<br />
and businessmen I think I have the quotes right -' you said that<br />
they need not fear the unreasonable demands of Australian<br />
nationalism and that Australians are not chauvanists when it<br />
comes to foreign investment. What were you promising them?<br />
was it a relaxation in some way of the guidelines?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
No, I was not promising them anything. But I was explaining<br />
our foreign investment policy to them. I think that was understood.<br />
I was explaining that their investment would be welcomed, because<br />
you are probably not aware of the history of our relations with<br />
Germany in this particular area, but they were starting to show<br />
an interest in Australian development, investment, minerals<br />
two or three years ago; and certain meetings took place in<br />
Europe that turned them off completely. one of the reasons<br />
for that meeting with German industrialists, businessmen,<br />
bankers, was to try and undo the damage that had then been done.<br />
BEEBY Did you get any assurances..<br />
WALSH Who was that with? Was that with Whitlam<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
It was on an earlier occasion. I d6 not want to go into the<br />
details. WALSH It is a very serious charge to say Was it by the former<br />
Prime minister Whitlam or was it by his Ministers, or by<br />
public servants or<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
It was on a tour when Mr. Whitlam was there and a number of<br />
other people-were also there. But the minutes of certain<br />
meetings were made available at thetime. I had seen them,<br />
and I was not surprised that German interest diminished as a<br />
result of that. it was not only a political exercise in that<br />
sense, it was not only involving politicians. / BEEBY </p>
<p>BEEBY<br />
How did they respond to this statement that you made? Did<br />
t. hey show any signs of.?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Chancellor Schmidt, when I told him of our attitude, welcomed<br />
it very greatly, and I think the German industrialists were<br />
showing an interest. Some of them have got concerns out here.<br />
They said they would like to have further discussions with<br />
me when they were visiting Australia later this year or next<br />
year, and I think it was the view of our Ambassador that the<br />
meeting went well from his judgement of their attitudes.<br />
WALSH Prime Minister, in the section of the Commonwealth Conference<br />
communique dealing with the Middle East, the Heads of Government<br />
say, and I quote they refer to, and I quote " the right of the<br />
Palestinian people to their own homeland". Was there any<br />
suggestion where that homeland should be'?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
No. WALSH It did not get down to that degree of detail?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
No. That is not an all-embracing phrase is it? It says<br />
I think, most..<br />
WALSH No the next one says " Heads of Government recognise that the<br />
PLO is the only legitimate representative of the Palestinian<br />
people". Were you one of the most of Heads of Government'?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Australia has taken the view that the PLO should first recognise<br />
Israel's right to survive. That remains our view, and that<br />
also wzs made plain in -the meeting. In these areas where<br />
Austral'ia might have been in a minority view in the conference<br />
there was no attempt to hide that or diminish that. They knew<br />
our views in these matters.<br />
MOORE Prime minister, if you will forgive the phrase it is time,<br />
or almost time. Incidentally, how did you get on with<br />
Mr. Muldoon? I forgot to ask.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I thought very well. / MOORE </p>
<p>21<br />
MOORE It was not such a fierce battle as we were led to believe?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I do not think so.<br />
MOORE Prime Minister, thank you very much for joining us tonight.<br />
Maximillian Wa]. sh, Warren Beeby, thank you too.<br />
