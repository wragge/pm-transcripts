    <subjects>Australians facing execution in Indonesia. </subjects>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, do you think there’s any room for hope at this late stage?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>We are continuing to make representations. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has been talking to her counterpart. I am seeking a final call to President Widodo because…</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>Today?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>I’ve put in a request. I can’t guarantee that the request will be met, but I’ve certainly put in a request because the Government and the people of Indonesia need to know that this is important to us. We do stand up for our values. We respect Indonesia, we honour the friendship that we have with Indonesia, but we stand up for our values and we stand up for our citizens and these are Australian citizens <em>in extremis</em>.</p>
<p>As people have just been pointing out over the last little while here at this vigil, it would ennoble Indonesia if they were to extend mercy to these men. As the Foreign Minister has been pointing out, these men have become crime fighters and they are assets to Indonesia in the fight against drug crime and when you’ve got an asset you don’t destroy it.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>Did we try and repatriate Indonesian prisoners? Foreign Minister, are you able to confirm that?</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>What we are seeking to do is have an opportunity to talk about options that might be available in the area of prisoner transfer or prisoner swap. Absolutely no details, but we are seeking opportunities to explore every option that might be available to us – every avenue that might be available to save the lives of these two men.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>How is that being received so far?</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>I am waiting to hear back from the Foreign Minister. I spoke to her about it and she undertook to provide that information to the President.</p>
