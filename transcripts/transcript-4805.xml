The Prime Minister has sent the following message to the<br />

" On behalf of the Australian Government and people,<br />
I wish to convey my deep sympahty and concern about<br />
the losses that your people are suffering in the<br />
floods that are ravaging areas of your country.<br />
Although the full-extent of the losses of life and<br />
destruction on property cannot yet be known, this<br />
is clearly a disaster of major proportions. My<br />
Government will be considering how it can help in<br />
alleviating the suffering caused by the floods". </p>
