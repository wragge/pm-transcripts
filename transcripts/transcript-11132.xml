<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Prime Minister good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good Morning Alan</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Happy birthday.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you, that's very kind of you.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>What does the Prime Minister do on his birthday?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think, just what a lot of other people do on their birthdays,</p>
<p> they spend it with their family and that's what I intend to do. We'll</p>
<p> have a small family dinner tonight as a tradition not only in our</p>
<p> family but, I guess, millions of others around Australia because special</p>
<p> occasions are always things that you spend with the people who are</p>
<p> closest to you and.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Do you think.sorry.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, and that's what I'll be doing. Apart from that it will be a relatively</p>
<p> uneventful day.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Do you think your humble background may have redefined your attitude</p>
<p> towards public policy and, indeed, the attitude of the Liberal Party?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I guess my background, which is pretty typical of the background</p>
<p> of millions of Australians, has had some impact on the Liberal Party.</p>
<p> There's nothing elitist or exclusive about the Liberal Party. It is,</p>
<p> to use a popular expression of mine, very much a broad church. We</p>
<p> do represent all sections of the Australian community and long may</p>
<p> it be so because political parties are, if they are to be effective,</p>
<p> are expressions of community values and community attitudes. And if</p>
<p> we can express those values and attitudes in policies then we do good</p>
<p> things for the community.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Just on that basis then, I mean, your mum and dad were not well off,</p>
<p> they were comfortable, not well off.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, my father was very hardworking.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>That's it. But see, your mother, they brought up four children and</p>
<p> the mother didn't work. Do we do enough for families today when it</p>
<p> seems almost impossible for them to survive with one bread winner?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are now doing more under our tax system and it will do even more</p>
<p> from July of next year but, I guess, we never do enough. The world,</p>
<p> mind you, has changed. In my mother's day virtually no women with</p>
<p> children worked. It was a different society. It is easier now to combine</p>
<p> family and work and I think the ideal policy is to give all men and</p>
<p> women an effective choice. Those who want one of the parents to be</p>
<p> at home, normally but not always the mother, full-time while kids</p>
<p> are young should be financially able to do so.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>They don't have that choice, do they?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, many of them don't, although some of the taxation changes we are</p>
<p> making at the moment will make it a little easier, a little easier</p>
<p> for them to exercise that choice. On the other hand, there are some</p>
<p> people who choose to combine the two roles. And it's not the for Government</p>
<p> to sort of sit in judgement and say which is right or which is wrong</p>
<p> but what it is the role of the Government to do is to provide the</p>
<p> families with the effective choice. And I think we're improving it,</p>
<p> although we still have a long way to go.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But see, we had a basic wage which was fundamental to the industrial</p>
<p> wellbeing of our community over many, many years and it was designed</p>
<p> to provide for a husband and his wife and, at the time, three children.</p>
<p> And when that become eroded we then had to have child endowment to</p>
<p> compensate families for the fact that the basic wage didn't meet those</p>
<p> conditions. And at the time of your mum and dad and my mum and dad,</p>
<p> I mean, basically, while you mightn't have lived glamorously, there</p>
<p> was always food on the table and it was adequate for your survival.</p>
<p> That isn't the case today, is it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it is the case for the great majority of people. I think what.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>They can get by, you think, on one income.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh no, no, no.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>See, they can't. See, your family could.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I'm not, I'm not, I mean, there is an increasing number of families</p>
<p> where both mother and father and work.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Yeah, they have to.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They do. Some of them do it out of choice because they feel they have</p>
<p> better fulfilment out of that and what it really gets back to, Alan,</p>
<p> is choice. Now, when you reflect on the past there are a lot of good</p>
<p> things about the past, there are also things about the past that I</p>
<p> think we've moved on from. And I always think in life and also in</p>
<p> setting public policy the best approach is to combine and preserve</p>
<p> the best things of the past but also recognising that in other areas</p>
<p> the world has got to change. And the world we are living in now continues</p>
<p> to change and you have got to get the right balance between..</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Sure. But if you are a young couple - and you have got three young</p>
<p> children and there's a couple of young blokes sitting around the studio</p>
<p> here now - to buy something - they're just married - to buy something</p>
<p> for $300,000 you'd struggle to get it for $300,000, but you are going</p>
<p> to need a deposit of $30,000. That's almost impossible for kids today,</p>
<p> young people 25 year olds, to actually save that deposit without both</p>
<p> of them going out to work.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is undoubtedly true and particularly so in some parts of Australia</p>
<p> such as Sydney, less typical [inaudible]. It varies, it does. But</p>
<p> that is undoubtedly true and in that sense the world is different.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>That puts a lot of pressure on marriage.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It does. On the other hand there are opportunities that people have</p>
<p> now that an earlier generation never dreamt of. So there are pluses</p>
<p> and minuses have changed in evolution.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Just on that under 30's, you were quoted at the weekend of saying</p>
<p> that the under 30's are more interested in outcomes than they are</p>
<p> in ideology. Do you think public debate though is still unfortunately</p>
<p> dominated by ideology? That is why we have opposition, for example,</p>
<p> to unfair dismissal laws. After two times being elected you still</p>
<p> haven't been able to get those proposals through, they are being beaten</p>
<p> by ideology rather than reality.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Alan, I naturally agree with that statement because I think</p>
<p> it is silly that those laws have not been put through. But I do think</p>
<p> we are still.public debate is still too much about ideology rather</p>
<p> than practical outcomes. I do think younger people are interested</p>
<p> in what produces a good result rather than whether it conforms with</p>
<p> a particular ideology. Now, that is a sweeping generalisation and</p>
<p> like all generalisations there are plenty of exceptions.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Well, can we take some exceptions because the outcome in the health</p>
<p> debate at the moment, you have got a very distinguished figure in</p>
<p> health, Professor Dwyer, saying his hospital, Prince of Wales, is</p>
<p> technically bankrupt. You have got very reputable people at Westmead</p>
<p> saying: we just can't survive. They are closing down beds every month.</p>
<p> So the outcome seems to me to be appalling and to many but we cling</p>
<p> to the ideology of Medicare.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's a fair question. I think the outcome in this country</p>
<p> although it is badly flawed is still a lot better than the outcome</p>
<p> in other countries around the world. I would rather, I have said it</p>
<p> before, but I would rather on a battler's wage get sick in Bankstown</p>
<p> than the Bronx. You'd be far.well, it's true, you'd be far better</p>
<p> looked after. Or for that matter, Birmingham. Because this country's</p>
<p> health system, for all the brick bats that are that are thrown at</p>
<p> it, does have certain strengths..</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But there are people in emergency wards who are getting no care.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Alan, I do not deny that. My generalisation, I guess, is that it's</p>
<p> still a fundamentally sound system with a lot of weaknesses. Now,</p>
<p> the States say: let's have a Productivity Commission Inquiry. Well,</p>
<p> we've had one of those already into the Commonwealth area of responsibility</p>
<p> which is private health insurance. We are looking at that. I am a</p>
<p> bit sceptical.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>They are wanting us to go beyond that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they're mixed. Some of them do and some of them don't. Some</p>
<p> of them want a means test.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>So do we leave it as it is?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I think you continue to change it but you keep the basic structure</p>
<p> which is a Medicare complemented by private health insurance. And</p>
<p> we have put.in the last year we have put $1.5 billion more resources</p>
<p> a year into private health insurance, we have promised to double health</p>
<p> and medical research in this country and we have also increased [inaudible]</p>
<p> by 17 per cent.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>You have got Professor Dwyer saying his hospital is bankrupt.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Professor Dwyer I know and I respect him. I acknowledge that there</p>
<p> are many areas that need repair and change but you don't throw out</p>
<p> the whole system. I mean, this is a mistake we made a long time ago</p>
<p> when..</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>We did.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>..We had a very good system and because there were a few gaps we threw</p>
<p> out the whole system and that was a mistake.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>And what we had was better than what we have got now.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>. but you can't go back to that. What you have to do is try and make</p>
<p> the present system better.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>What you can't go back to saying that basically if you could afford</p>
<p> your own health care you pay and public hospitals are for those in</p>
<p> need. I mean, that was a pretty simple system wasn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But one of the things that underpinned that system a generation ago</p>
<p> was the honoury system involving doctors. I don't hear doctors saying</p>
<p> they'll go back to that system. One of the things that underpinned</p>
<p> the less expensive delivery of health care a generation ago was the</p>
<p> lack of equal pay for women. Now, I am certainly not in favour of</p>
<p> that.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But you had a guns' summit and a tax summit. Do you think we need</p>
<p> a health summit? I mean, this is critical stuff.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I am not in favour of a health summit. I don't think summits are</p>
<p> the stuff of good decision making. I think what has to happen in the</p>
<p> health area is that people who are elected, that's the governments</p>
<p> of the States and the Commonwealth have to keep making decisions to</p>
<p> improve the system.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But we have never spent so much money in our lives on health care</p>
<p> and the system in some parts is diabolical.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We don't spend nearly as much as say the United States.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Should we?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, we shouldn't because in the United States is an enormous amount</p>
<p> of wastage.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But what do you say to the people who can't get into an emergency</p>
<p> ward today? I mean they are in diabolical straits and their ambulances</p>
<p> are being turned away today here in New South Wales, and they urgently</p>
<p> need care. What do we say to those people?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think the first thing you say to them is that you recognise</p>
<p> that there's a problem and you look to the government that has the</p>
<p> responsibility to do something about it. Now we do have a division</p>
<p> of responsibility in health. We look after private health insurance,</p>
<p> the States look after public hospitals. Now we have done something</p>
<p> about private health insurance. We have increased the resources to</p>
<p> State governments. This is not...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>[inaudible] Bob Carr's increased expenditure for public hospitals</p>
<p> enormously.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's true. But I mean this is not a finger pointing exercise.</p>
<p> But you can't have a situation where every time there is a deficiency</p>
<p> found in one area you turn around and say we've got to dismantle the</p>
<p> whole system. That is ridiculous.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>There does seem to be people going into public hospitals that should</p>
<p> be paying an arm, and there's all those people say, if they then paid</p>
<p> that money could be turned back and invested into improving the system.</p>
<p> But if people going to doctors everyday for nothing when they should</p>
<p> be paying. Now Brian Howe, who wasn't sort of a raging conservative</p>
<p> let's say, he actually talked about a co-payment when you went to</p>
<p> the doctor. That was bowled over when Paul Keating said he'd unwind</p>
<p> it in order to get the leadership off Bob Hawke. Now if Brian Howe</p>
<p> can talk about a co-payment, surely it might be time for us embrace</p>
<p> it by now.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'll come to the co-payment in a moment. On the question of a</p>
<p> means test for public hospitals, in order to collect a significant</p>
<p> amount of money out of that you would have to apply the means test</p>
<p> not to well off people, but to middle Australia. You don't collect</p>
<p> enough money in order to justify a means test unless you bring it</p>
<p> down to an income of about $45,000 for an individual.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Well that's not on.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I know it's not on. But you see I make the point Alan that people</p>
<p> talk about a means test as though you can collect billions dollars</p>
<p> by charging well off people when they go into public hospitals.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But they won't go into private health insurance if they can go into</p>
<p> the public hospital for nothing.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you have the phenomenon now of some people who've got private</p>
<p> health insurance going into public hospitals and the reason they're</p>
<p> doing that is because of the gap. We are doing something about gaps.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>So is the system called Silver Cross but your Health Minister continues</p>
<p> to oppose, and I've written to you about that but..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But of course Silver Cross as I understand it, and I don't have all</p>
<p> the details with me, as I understand it Silver Cross and groups like</p>
<p> it don't comply with all of the other conditions that other private</p>
<p> health insurance funds are obliged to comply with.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But my understanding is that they do.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well..</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I'd be happy to talk to you.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I will make another examination of it.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I'd like you to.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You've provoked me to do it.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>All right. Just on outcomes, 125 workers at Oakdale has not received</p>
<p> the payments of awards to which they're entitled, and indeed you've</p>
<p> got three Ministers - Nick Minchin, John Fahey and Peter Reith - refuse</p>
<p> to meet these blokes August 10. Now all those miners told me those</p>
<p> Ministers agreed to meet them in July, but then said oh look we can't,</p>
<p> we going to be away in July. Now when we're talking about outcomes</p>
<p> there are 200 companies in this country in the last two years have</p>
<p> done just the same thing to their workforce. How do we improve those</p>
<p> outcomes?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that issue was discussed at our Cabinet meeting last week and</p>
<p> there's some further work being done on it, and it will be discussed</p>
<p> again in the very very near future and I don't want to say anymore</p>
<p> [inaudible].</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Will they get their money?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>All I can say at this stage is that we are looking at a number of</p>
<p> options, and I don't want to unduly raise expectations, but I'm very</p>
<p> sensitive and I've said to you and others before to that particular</p>
<p> issue and I hope that [inaudible] similar issues can be resolved in</p>
<p> a fair manner, and one that pays regard to the needs of small businesses</p>
<p> in particular not to have to tie up money which is otherwise used</p>
<p> in a day to day sense now for the operations of those businesses.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Yeah. Well you see they've done the fair days work but they haven't</p>
<p> got the fair days pay.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Isn't an argument though Prime Minister to make the payments that</p>
<p> have to be made by small businesses, I understand your point, shouldn't</p>
<p> they be tax deductible at the time at which they are set aside, rather</p>
<p> than at the time in which they are paid to the workforce. That seems</p>
<p> to be the problem. I mean if the small businessman could get tax deductibility</p>
<p> immediately he makes the provision rather than when he actually pa</p>
