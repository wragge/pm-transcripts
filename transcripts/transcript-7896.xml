TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH MICKEY DE STOOP, ABC RADIO,<br />
NEWCASTLE 12 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
DE STOOP: Bob Hawke visiting Newcastle today and<br />
we're fortunate enough to be able to catch him before he<br />
jumps in his chopper or his plane bring him up here.<br />
We're talking to him from Sydney. Good morning to you Mr<br />
Hawke. Would you please bring some sunshine. Our SES<br />
workers need a break.<br />
PM: Yes, it's been terrible hasn't it. Not just in<br />
Newcastle but all round this region. Awful. I reckon<br />
you're starting to get webbed feet eh?<br />
DE STOOP: What we're finding out now is the poor devils<br />
who thought that perhaps they'd got away through the<br />
earthquake without too much damage are discovering that<br />
there are all sorts of problems now that the rain is<br />
hitting. PM: Yes, it is devastating. I just hope it clears up.<br />
DE STOOP: Could you believe it Mr Hawke when you first<br />
came up here and saw the devastation?<br />
PM: No, it was frightening. The thing that struck me<br />
about it too Mickey was how capricious it was. You'd see<br />
a building devastated then apparently next to it<br />
relatively unscathed. There was no pattern about it at<br />
all. But overall the impression was certainly one of<br />
devastation. I felt so, well just so terribly sad for<br />
the people who had suffered. The second impression of<br />
course was about the spirit of Newcastle. Quite<br />
magnificent the way people rallied around and worked and<br />
tried to help those who'd been, who'd either lost their<br />
loved ones or suffered damage. It was magnificent.<br />
DE STOOP: Does this mean that you're going to make a big<br />
announcement of an injection of federal funds today?<br />
PM: Well Mickey, what we've done is to really meet with<br />
the Premier. As you know I met with him very quickly<br />
afterwards and said well don't let's muck around and keep<br />
people in suspense about this. We have agreed that we<br />
will share all expenditures on the agreed measures<br />
equally and that we'll show greater than usual<br />
flexibility in applying some of the conditions, in </p>
<p>particular to concessional loans for both direct and<br />
indirect loss of business to assist the private sector.<br />
So we've agreed on that principle and we'll go about the<br />
business now of seeing what has to be done.<br />
DE STOOP: I think a lot of people now are feeling that<br />
Newcastle has been abandoned. There is that feeling that<br />
no-one gives a damn now. They did at first but they<br />
don't now.<br />
PM: There's no basis as far as my Government is<br />
concerned there's absolutely no basis for that.<br />
DE STOOP: So we will be seeing money coming through at a<br />
PM: The actual payment of assistance is done by the NSW<br />
Government. They have local offices where, as we often<br />
don't have them there, and we will then be actually<br />
sharing the payments with them. But the actual outlets<br />
will be through the NSW Government offices.<br />
DE STOOP: Ok, well onto the big issue today and I'd be<br />
delighted if you'd break it on my program of course. But<br />
I think I've got buckleys. When are we going to the<br />
polls? PM: Yes you're right Mickey, you've got buckleys.<br />
DE STOOP: No hints?<br />
PM: No hints mate.<br />
DE STOOP: When will Parliament sit next?<br />
PM: When it's called Mickey.<br />
DE STOOP: Any likelihood of an announcement today<br />
though, quite seriously?<br />
PM: No. No likelihood of an announcement today Mickey,<br />
no. DE STOOP: No? Next couple of days?<br />
PM: It'll be sometime in the future. Good try, good try<br />
Mickey. DE STOOP: What about by the end of this week?<br />
PM: I don't know. I'll just have to consider the<br />
options. But obviously, in one sense, the continued<br />
speculation is not something I particularly appreciate.<br />
So I wouldn't want to be waiting for a thousand years to<br />
announce it.<br />
DE STOOP: I think everybody wants to be put out of their<br />
misery now, particularly journalists. </p>
<p>PM: I thought you were going to say particularly Andrew.<br />
DE STOOP: Put out of his misery?<br />
PM: No, no, I didn't say that.<br />
DE STOOP: Actually he hasn't done too well in the polls<br />
today. How do you feel about John Howard's position<br />
right now? How would you be feeling if you were John<br />
Howard? PM: Well it's always the same with the Liberal Party. I<br />
mean they've got such a depth of talent. They have this<br />
fiddler's elbow in and out, in and out exercise with<br />
Howard and Peacock. When Howard's in he's declared<br />
unelectable, he's the most unpopular bloke in the<br />
business and Andrew Peacock looks attractive to them.<br />
But then they put the Peacock in and the reverse happens.<br />
* He goes down and Mr Howard by contrast Mr Peacock looks<br />
attractive. By comparison to one another they seem<br />
attractive apparently.<br />
DE STOOP: On the other side you've got Hawke and<br />
Keating. How thrilled were you that John Button again<br />
prompted the idea that Paul Keating will take over if<br />
Labor wins another term?<br />
PM: That was a nothing. As you know, it was a nothing.<br />
He had some aberration, didn't know what he was talking<br />
about. I'll be leading the Party in the election and<br />
through the next period.<br />
DE STOOP: Is that sort of thing embarrasing for you<br />
though, or annoying at least?<br />
PM: No. It was just a legless creature, that particular<br />
episode. A whole lot of people tried to stitch some legs<br />
on it. But it being without life and without substance,<br />
the legs refused to be attached. It didn't move.<br />
DE STOOP: What do you say to someone like John Button,<br />
or John Kerin for that matter when they come out with<br />
statements like this that obviously must be of some sort<br />
of concern to you? What happens behind the closed doors?<br />
You can't put them on detention or anything can you?<br />
PM: No. I've said a few words to John and I don't think<br />
you'll be finding any more problems from him.<br />
DE STOOP: He wasn't stood in the corner for half an<br />
hour? PM: No. There was no point in doing that. He got the<br />
message quite loud and clear. </p>
<p>DE STOOP: Onto a couple of personal things now. How's<br />
your health? A lot of people are saying at the moment<br />
you' re tired.<br />
PM: Eh?<br />
DE STOOP: A lot of people have got the impression at the<br />
moment that you're feeling tired.<br />
PM: No. Where'd you get that from? No-one's saying<br />
that at all.<br />
DE STOOP: Janine Haines said it on the program the other<br />
day. PM: Janine Haines. You're joking. The opposite is<br />
true. Everyone is saying that they've never seen me<br />
looking better. That's how I feel. I feel great.<br />
DE STOOP: So you're in tip-top form at the moment?<br />
PM: Absolutely.<br />
DE STOOP: Fit as a fiddle?<br />
PM: Fit as a fiddle.<br />
DE STOOP: How are you feeling after watching 60 minutes<br />
last night?<br />
PM: Proud of my wife.<br />
DE STOOP: Yes, she came over well didn't she. But were<br />
either of you expecting it to be taken, the angle used<br />
where we saw headlines yesterday morning ' Hazel Hawke I<br />
wanted a divorce' and that sort of thing being plastered<br />
over everything.<br />
PM: Yes. It was pretty crappy sort of media handling I<br />
thought. Because as Hazel made it quite clear, what<br />
she'd done at a rather difficult period was to find out<br />
what the options were. But she never initiated anything.<br />
Quite properly in those circumstances had a look at her<br />
options. But still that's I suppose a way you sell<br />
newspapers isn't it?<br />
DE STOOP: Do you ask to see I was just curious when I<br />
was watching it last night, I wondered if you get to vet<br />
anything? PM: No, of course not. I would never dream of asking to<br />
vet anything she was doing. I mean any more than I<br />
mean we're equals. She doesn't seek to vet what I'm<br />
doing. Why would I ever seek to vet what she's doing?<br />
DE STOOP: It's just that it is the Prime Minister<br />
y'know. It just occurred to me </p>
<p>PM: Hey listen. When we get up and talk about equality<br />
we mean it. It's not something we say and don't mean. I<br />
would never think of vetting what she was going to do.<br />
DE STOOP: Do you think most people care anyway? I mean<br />
most of us go through a tough-patch somewhere in<br />
relationships. Do you think the majority of people<br />
really care that there might have been a hiccough for a<br />
period of time?<br />
PM: I wouldn't think they would now. I think they would<br />
be interested in what the state of our relationship is.<br />
And it's manifest how good that is. But I think history<br />
in this respect is not of great interest to most of them.<br />
DE STOOP: Ok, well onto international things now.<br />
Nelson Mandela has been released. Everything seems to be<br />
happening very quickly in the world at the moment doesn't<br />
it. But this is the latest in great moves, in my view<br />
anyway. But what does it mean to us and does it mean we<br />
will be lifting sanctions with South Africa?<br />
PM: It means the stage has been set where we can<br />
consider what the next steps are in that regard. We'll<br />
be having a meeting with Commonwealth Foreign Ministers<br />
on South Africa, a committe that was established back in<br />
1987. They'll be meeting in May. I think that will be a<br />
time when there'll be the first formal review. I think<br />
the right way of putting it is that the stage, as I've<br />
said before, that by the actions of President de Klerk<br />
the stage has been set for negotiations between the<br />
government of South Africa and the representatives of the<br />
black population. And that is something that we ought to<br />
welcome. I have welcomed it. The next thing is the<br />
actual negotiations. If the government of South Africa<br />
is serious now about negotiating towards the creation of<br />
a democratic multi-racial non-apartheid South Africa then<br />
of course if they are prepared to have those negotiations<br />
then we ought to be looking at the lifting of sanctions.<br />
But as someone said when I was in New Zealand, on this<br />
issue, ' you don't get gold medals in the heats'. What<br />
has happened is that they have certainly done some<br />
important and necessary preliminary work. We'd be<br />
churlish, as I've said, if we didn't recognise that.<br />
DE STOOP: But a little cynical about the timing?<br />
PM: No, I'm not cynical. I think that President de<br />
Klerk is operating under considerable difficulties with a<br />
lot of the white population in South Africa. I think<br />
he's given evidence that he is serious about trying to<br />
move towards change. The important thing is, is he going<br />
to do it? Is he going to complete the process? I mean<br />
the worst thing in the world would be to make these<br />
decisions but then keep the actual practice of apartheid<br />
in place. That's not acceptable. But, as I say, he does<br />
seem to be serious about moving to meaningful<br />
negotiations. </p>
<p>DE STOOP: Without trying to trivialise it, it would be a<br />
great period for cricket wouldn't it?<br />
PM: Well, I think it would be great not only for cricket<br />
but great for all forms of contact. I don't like to see<br />
a situation where a country of that size and importance<br />
is isolated. As I've said always, we see no virtue in<br />
sanctions as such. They've always been seen simply as a<br />
measure to bring South Africa to the negotiating table.<br />
And they have obviously worked. No-one will be happier<br />
than me when the time comes that we can with confidence<br />
lift them so that we can meet them on the sporting field,<br />
the cultural field and in every other medium of contact.<br />
DE STOOP: I thought about you when you were over in<br />
Auckland because last time, well a couple of times ago<br />
that we were speaking I asked you who you would really<br />
enjoy and who you do enjoy sitting down to at a dinner<br />
table, considering that quite frequently you're stuck<br />
with people that you probably don't particularly want to<br />
spend a whole evening with. You said one of the most<br />
fascinating people for you is the Queen.<br />
PM: Well she is, to me, an important person. Given the<br />
unique nature of the Commonwealth, when you think of it,<br />
here is an organisation which covers so much of the<br />
world's population, from the second largest nation in<br />
India down to tiny specks of atolls in the Pacific, from<br />
rich nations to the poorest nations, every colour, creed<br />
you can imagine. An important part of keeping that<br />
organisation together has quite frankly been the<br />
commitment, involvement and personality of the Queen.<br />
She is remarkably well-informed about her Commonwealth.<br />
She can speak intelligently about every nation within it.<br />
She's given a sense of unification and continuum to it<br />
which I think very few people could've done. She also<br />
has a good sense of humour.<br />
DE STOOP: Yes you said that. So you had a chance to<br />
sort of chat while you were over in Auckland?<br />
PM: Yes. I had, well I was sitting with her in the<br />
stadium for a while but then we, I had a private audience<br />
with her later on on the Saturday afternoon. We had a<br />
very delightful yarn as usual.<br />
DE STOOP: Terrific. One quick thing. You're coming up<br />
to Newcastle. Do you think you've been forgiven for the<br />
frigates yet?<br />
PM: I don't think it's a question of being forgiven. I<br />
don't think Newcastle people when they came to think<br />
about it would forgive me as Prime Minister, any more<br />
than the rest of Australia would, if I made a decision on<br />
a wrong basis. And there was no doubt that on the basis<br />
of the economics of it that that was the correct<br />
decision. But it was a decision which also involved an </p>
<p>A 7<br />
enormous increase in jobs and investment for Newcastle.<br />
And I'm pleased to see the investment plans that there<br />
are in a whole range of industries for the Hunter region,<br />
not just Newcastle but for the region. It has a very<br />
very bright future. That pleases me because I have a<br />
very soft spot for the people of Newcastle and that<br />
region. DE STOOP: Have a great day up here. Thanks for your<br />
time on the program. And you won't be tempted to sample<br />
the wine?<br />
PM: No, it's ten years Mickey, ten years.<br />
DE STOOP: Congratulations. Have a good day. Bye<br />
PM: Bye.<br />
ends<br />
