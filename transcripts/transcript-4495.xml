FOR PRESS 2.0. SEPTEMBER 1977<br />
COMMONWEALTH GAMES.-. BRISBANE 1982<br />
The Commonwealth Government; will make a grant of $ 10 million<br />
towards the costs of staging the 1982 Commonwealth Gamnes in<br />
Brisbane. The grant will allow the Queensland Government in association<br />
with the Brisbane City Council and the Commonwealth Gamnes<br />
Foundation to have the maximum flexibility in determining<br />
expenditure priorities between sporting facilities and<br />
accommodation for competitors. This would be consistent<br />
wi th the Comi-oh-' we -lh'solicy of co-operative federalism.<br />
The $ 10 million contribution is significantly higher than<br />
assistance given towards the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, and<br />
the 1962 Perth Commonwealth Games.<br />
Following the provision in the August Budget of $ 1 million<br />
for sports development and assistance, and the establishment<br />
of a Sports Advisory Council, this grant is a -further<br />
recognition by the Commonwealth Government of the importance<br />
of sport to the Australian community.<br />
The Commonwealth is pleased to join with the Queensland State<br />
Government, the Brisbane City Council and the Commonwealth<br />
Games Foundation in contributing to a sporting event which<br />
will be of interest to all Australians. The announcement<br />
of a grant at this time will enable the planning for the Games<br />
to proceed with confidence. </p>
