PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT SATURDAY, APRIL 12 198~<br />
FEDERAL COUNCIL -EXPORT OF HORSES TO JAPAN FOR SLAUGHTER%~<br />
Question: export of horses to Japan in the conditions in the -wh-ich they<br />
are currently being transported. The Victorian government has*<br />
indicated its concern in the matter, and I would be grateful if the<br />
Prime Minister could indicate whether the Federal Government is<br />
proposing to take any action in the area.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Thank you for the opportunity of saying something about this subject.<br />
The export of horses to Japan and the shipment that was unloaded in<br />
Sydney does represent a disgrace of a very high order. They should<br />
never have been loaded, should never have been allowed to. be shipped,<br />
and we do owe thanks to the RSPCA for drawing the matter to attention.<br />
I have got to say that this is not the first time that this has<br />
happened. A shipment in December 1979 was also held up by the RSPCA<br />
for a while, but as a result of that, agreed guidelines were<br />
established for the export of horses to Japan.<br />
In this particular instance, it is very plain that the guidelines<br />
have not been addhered to, and the export should not be allowed.<br />
Marshall Baillieu, i think, has seen the horses, and would confirm<br />
the seriousness of t-he situation. Peter Nixon issued a statement<br />
yesterday saying that he was calling for a complete review of the<br />
procedures in relation~ to permits in these matters. Generally,<br />
while the Comamonwealt; h is responsible, the States act as. agents<br />
and are the authoiis that assess the matters and see whether<br />
or not the shipmient meets the various circumstances.<br />
I discussed this because we are both involved, this morning with<br />
Dick Hamer, and we both agree that there needs to be a review as<br />
Peter Nixon did announce yesterday, of the procedures, to make<br />
sure that it can't happen again.<br />
Now, the horses have been unloaded in Sydney. At the moment, I<br />
understand that the RSPCA are paying for the stabling of the horses<br />
and the feeding of them because I think that the owners have refused.<br />
Well, I discussed it with Peter Nixon this morning, and we will not<br />
allow these particular horses, this particular shipment, to be<br />
exported. Export controls will be used to prevent it, unless the<br />
owners pay for the horses and look after them in Sydney. Then they<br />
can do what they like with them, and if they get them to a fit<br />
condition to meet the guidelines to be exported in a proper way,<br />
then that will be able to occur. But there is no reason why the<br />
RSPCA should have to pick up the bill for the stabling of the<br />
horses in Sydney, and with Peter Nixon, we agreed that the<br />
Government should recompense the RSCPA for what it has done and<br />
the costs it might have incurred in that particular instance.<br />
I can't say any more about this at the moment. It is just one of<br />
those instances that should not have happened. Something broke<br />
down in relation to it. A Commonwealth veterinary of ficer did inspect<br />
these horses in Sydney, and as a result of that, it was certainly<br />
found that they didn't meet the standards. A number of the horses / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
were extremely ill, had been damaged and bruised, and almost looked<br />
as if they had been knocked about well, they had been knocked about,<br />
and many of them were not fit to travel.<br />
Well, we have got to establish arrangements betweenthe State and<br />
the Commonwealth to make sure that this sort of thing does not<br />
and cannot occur again. It is the second time in a matter of<br />
three or four months in which it has occurred, and I think in<br />
both cases, out of the Port of Melbourne. </p>
