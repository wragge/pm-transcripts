    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that Her Majesty the Queen has now approved the<br />
 formal establishment of a new award in the Australian honours system - the<br />
 Australian Active Service Medal 1945-1975. This new active service medal will<br />
 recognise the service of veterans who served in the Korean War, the Malayan<br />
 Emergency, the Indonesian Confrontation and the Vietnam War. </p>
<p>  The establishment of this new medal delivers on the Government's election<br />
 commitment to the veterans' community to create a distinctly Australian award<br />
 to recognise warlike service between 1945 and 1975. </p>
<p>  The Government will be recommending to the Governor-General that those<br />
 personnel who have received, or have an entitlement to the Korea Medal, a<br />
 General Service Medal for service in the Malayan Emergency 1948-60 or the<br />
 Indonesian Confrontation 1962-66, will be eligible for the Australian Active<br />
 Service Medal 1945-75. </p>
<p>  I am also very pleased to say that eligibility for this new medal will be<br />
 extended to those personnel who have received the Vietnam Medal or the Vietnam<br />
 Logistic and Support Medal. The precise eligibility for those recipients of<br />
 the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal will be determined by MrsBrownyn Bishop<br />
 MP, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. </p>
<p>  The Medal's design features the Federation Star on the obverse in keeping<br />
 with the Australian Active Service Medal and is ensigned with the Crown of<br />
 SaintEdward. The reverse of the Medal is decorated in keeping with other<br />
 Australian service medals and features a plinth on which the wearer's name<br />
 will be engraved. The ribbon colours have been drawn from active service<br />
 medals issued during the period 1945-75. </p>
<p>  The Australian Active Service Medal 1945-75 will be placed at the same level<br />
 as other war medals and the Australian Active Service Medal in the order of<br />
 wearing of medals. It will be worn immediately after World War II medals but<br />
 before the Korea Medal, the General Service Medals, the Vietnam Medal and the<br />
 Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal. </p>
<p>  Application forms for the medal can be obtained from: </p>

 On behalf of the Australian<br />
 Government I warmly congratulate all those Australian veterans and serving men<br />
 and women of the Australian armed forces who will be eligible for the<br />
 Australian Service Medal 1945-75. </p>
<p>  28 December 1997 </p>
