PPIPME MNISTER S SPEEQ-1 AT TE= J-7UJNCHTNG OF DITIS MURPHY' S IXK } WYM<br />
BRLSBAZE, 3 OZI'-OBER 1975<br />
1Mr Deputy Vice-Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It's a very great pleasure indeed to be launching another<br />
book written by one of Australia's finest historians, a<br />
distinguished member of thle staff of the University of<br />
Queensland; a book printed, published by the University<br />
of Queensland ? ress; and to launch this book, to support<br />
the author in the house occupied by three Premiers of<br />
Queensland. The last of those Preiers to occupy it"<br />
being the subject of the book T. J. Ryan himself.<br />
The Labor Party has not always had a good press but it's<br />
always had good historians. And whatever may be said about<br />
writers at any particular time, about the Labor Party they<br />
always look at Australian history,-not just Australian<br />
politics in retrospect, but Australian history in terms<br />
of what has been achieved by the Labor party the leaders<br />
and the members of the Labor party. And so it is with<br />
T. J. Ryan. The fact that this book has appeared 55 years<br />
after his death illustrates one important thing, I think,<br />
about our history, about our biographies, and that is<br />
that it takes a very long time in Australia to enable,<br />
or encourage historians to write about great Australians.<br />
Certainly T. J. Ryan deserved a biography, but there are so<br />
many people who've been prominent in Australian politics,<br />
in Australian histor-y, about whom no significant biographical<br />
material has yet appeared. There is no definitive work<br />
on Parkes, or on Griffith-a very great Queenslander-or<br />
on Barton, or on Fisher, or on Lyons or above all on Curtin.<br />
And there must still be much to be published about Hughes<br />
and Bruce and Chifley. And as far as I know, noone has yet<br />
undertaken the formidable task of assessing the Menzies<br />
era. The journalists have been much more prompt. Alan Reid<br />
did John Gorton in every sense. And there is another<br />
journalist, distinguished journalist, a very perceptive<br />
journalist, Laurie Oakes, who did a book on me and it's<br />
now available as a remainder at 35 cents a copy.<br />
Now at least we have a book on Ryan, a book which<br />
has been all the better because one has been able to mull<br />
over the history, to ponder on it, with maturity. One<br />
inevitably wonders how far Ryan would have gone, how great<br />
would have been his impact in the whole of Australia if he<br />
had been spared longer. There's no question the impact he<br />
had on Queensland in his time, and for succeeding decades.<br />
He was only 45 when he died. He was at the height of his<br />
power. There was every prospect that he would. have become<br />
Prime Minister. He was superbly equipped by tarerarPnt. and<br />
training for the role he played in. Queensland, and for the<br />
wider, and greater role to which he aspired. The statue<br />
in the Executive Gardens in Brisbane represents him as a<br />
King's Councellor. He was in fact the only lawyer to head<br />
a Queensland Government this century. That's a double<br />
first, because he was also not only the only lawyer to-head<br />
a Queensland Government this century, he was only one of the<br />
two people who've been through a university and headed a<br />
Queensland Government Jack Pizzey being the other, another<br />
man who was taken far too early from the scene. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Now, Ryan's legal training was obviously of<br />
very great importance to him in the two great constitutional<br />
and legal battles of his career. Queensland Premiers have<br />
sometimes been legal but they'Ive not always been<br />
constitutional. He had two great constitutional fights<br />
one was against the Upper House I'm amazed the interest<br />
Queensland parliamentarians take in Upper Houses now they<br />
no longer have one themselves they don't really have a<br />
very good sense of who should be imembers of Upper Houses<br />
even then. The other great fight he had, cons titutionally,<br />
was against Hughes. Now the heart of Dr Denis M'urphy's<br />
biography of Ryan is the fight between Ryan and Hughes<br />
over conscription. there's tragedy, comedy, real drama<br />
and mere melodrama in that story which Dr Murphy has<br />
interpreted and perpetuated. Fortunately in these days of<br />
reason and light it is possible for a Prime Minister of<br />
Australia and a Premier of Queensland to conduct any<br />
arguments they have in a very tolerant way cooperation<br />
and imutual respect as we know. But not in the days of<br />
Hughes and Ryan. Ryan transferred to the Federal arena<br />
for the specifLic purpose of getting rid of Hughes.<br />
He needn't have worried because at that time Hughes<br />
had joined the conservative forces and they always get<br />
rid of their leaders themselves. Ryan was barely in the<br />
Federal Parliament and the conservatives, the Tories of<br />
that day, dumped Hughes. And of course, before ten years<br />
was up they dumped Latham, and another ten years they<br />
diumed Menzies. Then it took a bit longer before they<br />
dumped Gorton, and then it accelerated again and they<br />
dumped Snedden now that's a very sad procession why<br />
Tories can't be loyal to their leaders.<br />
Now there's one aspect of Ryan's conduct in the<br />
fight against conscription which merits mention. The<br />
defection of Hughes and of every State leader of the Labor<br />
Party throughout Australia in the conscription era, except<br />
Ryan himself, meant that the Labor party for a lon-g time<br />
was suspicious of parliamentarians and suspicious of<br />
parliamentary leaders. Ryan was the only parliamentary<br />
leader of the Labor party in Australia who stood staunch<br />
during the conscription time. And as Dr Denis Murphy's<br />
book has pointed out, Ryan insisted on a proper role being<br />
accorded by the party to those candidates whom the party<br />
chose and whom the public elected to parliament. No<br />
party enjoys public support unless the party respects its<br />
parliamentarians. Now Ryan preserved the position of the<br />
parliamentary party in Queensland in that generation, and<br />
he kept alive'the very necessary popular support which<br />
parliamentarians must have. In some other States the step<br />
was taken to see that the people outside the party elected<br />
the parliamentary leader that was the case with Jack<br />
Lang. Jack Lang had support of the party machine long after<br />
he ceased to have the support of the parliamentary party.<br />
Now it was not until Curtin's day that the parliamentary<br />
party and the parliamentary leadership was seen to have the<br />
support of the party all over. ./ 3 </p>
<p>Now one of the things which I enjoyed-in<br />
reading Denis Murphy's book was the consistency of the<br />
uinchanging character of the criticisms which are made of<br />
Vhe Labor Party. Looking through some of the things I<br />
thought t. Hfis is an amazing conte-mporary work because<br />
Ryan's c-overnent was described as showing tyranny,<br />
treachery, treason, mob-rule; it was communist, it was<br />
bolshevik, it was disloyal to the Crown, it-was a<br />
contemptible conspiracy, it was reprehensible and<br />
represented a threat to the Australian way of life.<br />
Now all those things were said about Ryan when he was<br />
Premier of Queensland, when he was leader of the<br />
Australian Labor Party in Queensland. And one particular<br />
thing that the Ryan Government established was a<br />
Government Ir-surance office, a State Government insurance<br />
office and this was described as a violent, revolutionary,<br />
socialist attempt to destroy freedom of enterprise and<br />
the right to free choice. It's all so depressingly<br />
familiar. That is when it's done, first, it is completely<br />
reprehensible, it's intolerable, it. has to be condemned<br />
and resisted and if possible rejected. But once it comes<br />
about we see how beneficial it was. Looking back at<br />
T. J. Ryan's life, we can see how much he did achieve in<br />
the face of' all this irrational criticism.<br />
Now before Ryan's leadership~ the Australian<br />
Labor Party ' s strength in Queensland was based in the<br />
outback and in the provincial cities. lie realised that<br />
the core of success in Queensland politics was . to<br />
link the interests orE the capital and the provincial cities.<br />
And after Ryanfor decades &gt; the LaborParty -in Queensland<br />
held office-wi-* th only a single gap of-three years-because<br />
it retained the support of the provincial cities and the<br />
capital. And to restore that alliance is still the key<br />
to political success for the Australian Labor Party in<br />
Queensland. T. J. Ryan showed it, his associates and his<br />
successors preserved it for, a decade. If wie're to be true<br />
to the things he established-the ideas, the institutionswe<br />
must again bring about that alliance.<br />
I congratulate Dr Murphy, whom I've known for<br />
very many years, as a candidate, as an historian, as an<br />
academic. I congratulate him on his painstaking work, his<br />
patient research, his very readable recreation of a<br />
turbulent, but very fruitful period in the political life<br />
of Queensland and Australia. He records a period in<br />
Australian history where Queensland led Australia. The<br />
ideas that those first Labor Governments in Queensland<br />
put on the statute books, the administrative acts they<br />
achieved led Australia. In this record of a great career,<br />
untimely cut short, Denis Murphy has made a major<br />
contribution to our history and our politics; our understanding<br />
of that history and of those politics. I'm certain that<br />
not only will academics, not only will historians, but the<br />
people of Queenslaznd' and the people of Australia understand<br />
so very much better what made this great man and what in<br />
his time, under his leadership, gave Queensland the pioneering,<br />
the leading role in this country. </p>
