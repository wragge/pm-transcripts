<p>More flood-affected primary producers and small business owners in some of the hardest hit regions of Queensland can now apply for clean-up and recovery grants.</p>
<p>The grants of up to $25,000 will provide extra help with the economic impacts these devastating floods have had on local businesses and the wider community.</p>
