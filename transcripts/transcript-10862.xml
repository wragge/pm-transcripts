    <content><![CDATA[<p>Challenges such as addressing the enormous problems posed by rural</p>
<p> salinity and looking toward Australia's ability to profit from</p>
<p> the biotechnology revolution were among the issues discussed at my</p>
<p> first Science, Engineering and Innovation Council meeting in Canberra</p>
<p> today.</p>
<p>The Council is the Government's principal source of advice on</p>
<p> issues in science, engineering and innovation and aspects of education,</p>
<p> research and training.</p>
<p>Science and innovation play a vital role in our social and economic</p>
<p> development.</p>
<p>The new Council members will provide high-level and independent advice</p>
<p> on matters of science, engineering and innovation. Their expertise</p>
<p> derives from years of representing Australia's business interests</p>
<p> and research and engineering bodies.</p>
<p>They reflect Australia's large investment in science and technology</p>
<p> and the nation's capacity to innovate - the development and commercialisation</p>
<p> of new products, processes and services.</p>
<p>The Government has made clear, through its Investing for Growth</p>
<p> strategy, that it sees innovation, including scientific and engineering</p>
<p> advances, as crucial to the future of our economic security and the</p>
<p> prosperity of all Australians.</p>
<p>I would like the Council to focus on the linked roles of science,</p>
<p> engineering and innovation and, as the Council's terms of reference</p>
<p> indicate, give prominence to the roles of science and technology in</p>
<p> contributing to our national economic and social development.</p>
<p>We need to consider not only how to support and undertake excellence</p>
<p> in science, but also how to build the links between science and its</p>
<p> applications.</p>
<p>As a nation we need to involve the users of research in setting the</p>
<p> research agenda, promote co-operative research and commercialise the</p>
<p> results of research conducted in the public sector.</p>
<p>We also need to ensure that our schools can give young Australians</p>
<p> a strong foundation in science and technology.</p>
<p>The Council noted that under the Government's recent education</p>
<p> policies, links between schools and business are increasing and this</p>
<p> will assist the expansion of enterprise education in our schools.</p>
<p>Other issues discussed at the PMSEIC inaugural meeting were the interaction</p>
<p> between universities and industry, priority issues in science and</p>
<p> technology, the nexus between science and its application and developing</p>
<p> strategies for a vibrant software industry.</p>
