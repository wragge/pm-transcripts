PRIME MINMISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH PETER KENN4EDY ON ABC RADIO 12<br />
SEPTEM4BER 1992<br />
E AND OE 1PROOr ONLY<br />
KENNEDY,, Prime ' lnister, you needed yesterday's current<br />
account deficit of sl. 4 billion for July like a hole' in the<br />
head. unow much pressure is there for an interest rates hike?<br />
FX: Commentators can't have it both ways Peter.<br />
They can't say that the economy isn't growing and yet then<br />
point to the growth in imports. If imports are growing as<br />
fast as this it means the economy, demand in the economy is<br />
stronger than anybody thinks, If the economy is responding<br />
and sucking in imports there is a lot more going on out there<br />
than the partial data has indicated, or alternatively this is<br />
just an aberrant month,<br />
KENNEDY: But alternatively it means that perhaps we<br />
don't have the productive capacity at home to meet this<br />
increased demand, either way there is a pressure on interest<br />
rates. PM$ One of the features of the exchange rate of<br />
late has been the fall in the terms of trade. That is the<br />
value of our produce, the prices we are getting for minerals<br />
and agricultural products are now very low. But export<br />
earnings -are still rocketing along which means our volumese are<br />
doing enormously well. That is not withstanding the fact that<br />
export prices have come down our earnings are still up because<br />
of volume, the amount of stuff we are selling is enormous. So<br />
I think that explains some of the markets apprehension but the<br />
current account has improved enormously in the last, it's been<br />
halved in the last few years to around 3 odd percent of GDP<br />
and we can't let one month's number set the scene.<br />
KENNEDYs so you are Confident that interest rates<br />
certainly can be held for the time being? </p>
<p>TEL: 1. Sep. 92 13: 42 No. 003 P. 02/ 06<br />
2.<br />
PM1 There was a rumour around last week the<br />
government tightened monetary policy, It hadn't, Lt hadn't.<br />
XENNEDYt So no move in interest rates in the foreseeable<br />
future? PM: That's a matter for the Treasurer, the Reserve<br />
bank but from me, no.<br />
K. ENNEMY You said the figures indicate that probably<br />
there Is a lot more going on in the economy than has been<br />
showing up in the figures.<br />
PM: We have these sort of people, commentators so<br />
called in Australia. They are either crying in their beer or<br />
they are laughing, there is no sort of you are not getting<br />
that sort of middle comment. We had some of the Sydney<br />
commentators like Max Walsh today saying the ring of<br />
confidence is going, we put to big a stimulus into the<br />
economy, that is the fiscal budget changes are too great. Now<br />
they are about just under three quarters of a percent of GDP.<br />
Last week Japan has just announced a new f iscal policy of a<br />
stimulus of -1.5 -percent of GDP and the whole world is hoping<br />
that the Japanese stimulus pays of f for North America and for<br />
Europe. That is that the Japanese economy will tug everyone<br />
else along. Now the fact is the government has done the right<br />
thing I it has got interest rates where it can induce a recovery,<br />
it's got spending in the One Nation and the Budget which will<br />
bring a recovery on, and that is as it should be.<br />
They have been carefully judged; the stimulus is about the<br />
right amount and~ if we didn't have commentators who think they<br />
have got to be extravagant to be noticedobut basically making<br />
comment in the national interest rather than against the<br />
national Interest, then I think they would think that the<br />
settings the government have in place at the moment are just<br />
right for the economy.<br />
KENNEDY: Nevertheless in the past you have described<br />
Australians as import junkies haven't you. Are we still<br />
import junkies?<br />
PM': In the late 60s we were importing more than we<br />
were exporting but at the moment we have bee6-n exporting our<br />
heads of f. The shift to exports has been just a phenomena,<br />
phenomenal, a phenomenal thing.<br />
KENNEDY: if we can move onto another matter Prime<br />
Minister. You yesterday, speaking at an international<br />
industrial relations conference served notice that the<br />
government would introduce an industrial relations charter to<br />
I guess draw attention to the differences between the<br />
government policy on Industrial relations and the opposition's<br />
policy. What sort of things would you expect to see in the<br />
charter? </p>
<p>TEL: l. Sep. 92 13: 42 No. 0603 P. 03/ 06<br />
P14: Like f or instance protecting the conditions of<br />
employmient under awards. What Dr Hewson wants to do is go<br />
back to the 19th Century' so that I think an individual person<br />
gets called into the office by the employer and he says to the<br />
person this is what we are going to pay you now, no holiday<br />
leave, you won't be getting this and you won't be getting<br />
that, your rates are going to change and the person says weill<br />
hang on I am not going to cop that I will deal with the union,<br />
no no we don't deal with the unions, there is no more union&amp;*,<br />
you are not part of the award system, you are on your own.<br />
Now that is the sort of world he wantsp that is 90 years of<br />
industrial achievement to go out the door and what, forAn<br />
economy where the wage here, the total cost of wages is now at<br />
sort of 1960s levels, and where the profits here and the<br />
economy is quite high are now going to skyrocket as any volume<br />
comes through with business the companies are very stripped<br />
down. The flip side of the unemployment is that companies are<br />
very stripped down and many are now quite profitable and once<br />
there is a bit of volume come&amp; or, that will go straig1~ t to<br />
profits because their overheads are covered.<br />
KENNEDYe But that is a pretty extreme view isn't it, and<br />
if the Opposition is going to adopt a policy similar to' Now<br />
Zealand the sounds coming out of New Zealand seem to be quite<br />
favourable now.<br />
PM8 We have now twice as many people covered by<br />
enterprise agreements under this government's wages policy as<br />
there are in New Zealand covered under these enterprise<br />
contracts, twice as many people in Australia. We are now<br />
presiding over a revolution in industrial relations where we<br />
are seeing General Motors, Toyota, Ford, enormous increases in<br />
productivity as a result of agreements with working people and<br />
their unions which is giving them now higher paid but lower<br />
cost for the company. I mean it's working as sweetly as it<br />
has ever worked..( he whole of the 80s evolutionary change is<br />
coming good. What Dr Hewson would propose would wreck the lot.<br />
You pit employer against employeas you take them out of the<br />
award systemthey have no protect ion at law for holiday pay,<br />
sick leave, rates of pay, it's basically law of the jungle.-get<br />
what you can, 1tt won't do Australia any good and it won't<br />
protect that low inflation rate which has given us those low<br />
Interest raLea.<br />
KENNEDY: One of the big criticisms of the Australian<br />
industrial relations scene has been that it's been far too<br />
rigid and while you are freeing up the financial market for<br />
instance in the mid 80s<br />
PMS That was in the mid 80s though Petert Now, as a<br />
result of this deal we did with three weeks ago or in the<br />
course of itoing, three quarters of all wage adjustments this<br />
year won't come from the centralised wage fixing system) it </p>
<p>TEL: 1. Sep. 92 13: 42 No. 003 P. 04/ 0E<br />
4. PM: ( cont'd) will come from enterprise bargaining. It's a<br />
revolution but it is not one which is disruptiveit's been an<br />
evolutionary change. That's the value, I mean one where<br />
everyone has agreed, not an acrimonious vicious change.<br />
KENNEDY: You are saying then that you are succeeding in<br />
freeing up the industrial relations system without an<br />
upheaval? PM8 obviously we are why do you think Mr Prescott<br />
from BHiP and Nasser from Ford and all these other people are<br />
coming out extolling the virtues of enterprise bargaining and<br />
productivity change, they are really saying to Dr Hewson your<br />
thing is too rough we don't want to go back to the 19th<br />
Century we want to change it the way we have been changing it<br />
and you have got to fit in with the rest of Australian<br />
society. I mean at the moment Dr Hewson is the odd man out<br />
everybody is out of step but him. The big business community<br />
BHP, Toyota, Ford, they are all out of step with him the trade<br />
unions are out of step, the welfare industry is out of step<br />
everybody is out of step but him.<br />
KENNEDYs Nevertheless in the industrial area there in<br />
still a lot of criticism especially from small business about<br />
some of those award conditions that have been piled on over<br />
the years. Things like holiday penalty rates<br />
PM1 Yes I know but Peter the wage share in GDP,<br />
that is the cost of wages and the total economy is at 1960s<br />
level, say noQ more put your glasses down, that is with<br />
everything in, that is with everything bar the kitchen sink<br />
thrown in. That is the point but Peter you were going to ask<br />
me, I am running out of time, you were going to ask me about<br />
these, you mentioned in your introduction these secret taxes<br />
the Opposition have.<br />
KENNEDY: Yes<br />
PM1 I'll say some things about that,<br />
KENNEDYs It's reported that the Opposition OST it's been<br />
recommended that it should tax things like wheelchairs,<br />
artificial limbs and local government rates. Now Mr Reith was<br />
backing of f on that on AM but I am just wondering where that<br />
leaves the Opposition?<br />
P1; We had the Opposition and we had the media<br />
running around a week ago saying the government had secret<br />
taxes which of course was a total furphy. These were things<br />
we mentioned ourselves in the Budget that we might do but what<br />
we have here is that Mr Cole, Sir William Cole is the chairman<br />
of a board of management looking at the GST and Dr Howson<br />
wrote to him on 9 March saying under your leadership the<br />
office will act independently to consult with the Australian<br />
community on all administrative and technical features and he </p>
<p>TEL: 1. Sep. 92 13: 4 No. 00<br />
PM i ( cont'd) went on to Identify in the same letter,<br />
Identifying the health and education goods and services that<br />
will be zero rated. In other words those things in health and<br />
education and services that will attract no tax. Now this<br />
committee Is going to recommend that they tax because they<br />
can't run the UST with all these exemptions that they tax<br />
wheelchairs, artificial limbs, 15% on school boarding fees,<br />
on local government rates and now we have got very<br />
dishonestly Mr Reith this morning trying to run away from It<br />
and say that's not our policy and he said the Cole committee<br />
was given a brief to look at the broader policy issues but<br />
that certainly was not one of them.<br />
in fact it was explicitly one of them in Dr Howson's remit to<br />
this committee. You see the fact is the GST is a monster the<br />
Cole Committee has had now three hundred submissions from<br />
business and private community groups about it. People hate<br />
the thing and they have got this welling up in this GST office<br />
they have set up and now when they want to make the<br />
recommendations to Dr Hewuon and Mr Reith they say we don't<br />
want to know about it, we don't want to know about all these<br />
technical problems which are going to tax things like school<br />
boarding and local government rates and wheelchairs and<br />
artificial limbs and the rest.<br />
This is going to be the most monstrous tax impost ever mounted<br />
on the Australian people and they are trying to do it in<br />
secret and worse than that when some of it leaks they try and<br />
deny it even though they have set this committee up to do it.<br />
KENNEDY: What tax do those items attract at the moment?<br />
PM1 School boarding fees zero, local government<br />
rates zero, and the same with the others. The fact is this tax<br />
is,. oIee, people have got to understand this Peter: the total<br />
income " tax raises $ 49 billion in this Budget it raises forty<br />
nine thousand million, the GST raises $ 30 billion it's over<br />
half of the total income tax of Australia. It's not just<br />
it's 15% on all goods and services but it equals, it's revenue<br />
equals over halt of the income tax because the average rate of<br />
income tax is * only about 23.5% if you put all the high<br />
salaries and the low salaries together they only come about<br />
about 23.5%. You stick in a 15% tax on everything, food,<br />
clothing, shelter, goods like we were just talking about<br />
school fees, local government rates, it hurts, Lt's a<br />
monstrous impost And of course It will add 6/ 7 percentage<br />
points to inflation it will tip us back to a l0t inf lation,<br />
it will put interest rates up by 6/ 7% because there is no way<br />
the financial markets are going to lend at less than the<br />
inflation rate and we will go back into a recession and stay<br />
in there for what, an idealogical obsession on the part of Dr<br />
Hewson to straighten all the low Lnccae people up and make<br />
them pay their way as he puts it. </p>
<p>I LL<br />
6<br />
KENEDY But isn't all the Opposition doing really<br />
compiling a list so that we know before the next election<br />
which items will be subject to GST and which items will be<br />
exempt? PM: Yes but this committee is saying what will be<br />
subject will be school boarding fees, local government rates<br />
so if people are paying $ 3001400 a year on their rates they<br />
will pay a further 15%, they will pay another $ 50 or on<br />
artificial limbo and yet when the harsh reality of the<br />
management of the OST is coming out. See as a matter of fact<br />
in a newsheet in Canberra called Inside Canberra which is a<br />
privately circulated thing the editor had this to say a week<br />
ago that Messrs Hewson and Reith have decided on stalling<br />
tactics, now the GST coordination office looms as a huge<br />
emnbarrassment* It has received some 300 submissions, some 300<br />
companies or organisations were dissatisfied, worried,<br />
confused about Fightbacc, most about the GST and as well as<br />
that they say Dr Hewson does not intend to spell out what he<br />
intends to do about road user charges.<br />
See at the moment he wants to abolish the tax on petrol and<br />
excise but that is the way we pay for road user charges and<br />
big trucks breaking up roads. If they travel more they pay<br />
more, if you take the tax off who is going to pay for the<br />
roads? He is going to try and slide past that issue too so<br />
what Inside Canberra was telling us was that Sir William<br />
Cole's GST committee set up as an independent unit under Dr<br />
Hewson's GST policy Is basically sitting mum on 300<br />
submissions of people whingeing, complaining and reasonably<br />
about the GST.<br />
I( ENNEDYs I gather Prime Minister we are going to hear a<br />
lot more about that before too much longer<br />
PM: your ears will be burning with it Peter, your<br />
ears will literally be burning with it. These characters have<br />
got so many hidden taxes ready for you it's just not funny.<br />
