<p><strong>WILSON:</strong></p>
<p>And joining us now live from Parliament House in Canberra is Prime Minister Howard. Prime Minister, apart from reviewing our anti-terrorist laws, what more can be done to prevent this sort of terrorism actually reaching into Australia?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well the review of the anti-terrorist laws is one thing, but I've also asked for a review of our anti-terrorist capacity, that is the assets we have, military, police and otherwise, to not only respond but also to pre-empt attacks. Clearly, no country is immune from a possible terrorist attack, but obviously the nature of our society and the way in which we respond to potential behaviour that might lead to terrorism means that the risk is less in Australia than in some other parts of the world, but it is still a risk. And it is a very difficult and daunting challenge, but it's one of the unfortunate realities of the world in which we live.</p>
<p><strong>WILSON:</strong></p>
<p>You're actually dispatching Foreign Minister Downer and Justice Minister Ellison to Jakarta tonight. What is their brief?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, their brief is to talk with the Indonesian Government about the ways in which we can cooperate with the Indonesians in finding the perpetrators of the murder that was inflicted on so many Australians in Bali. What we give priority to at present is to try and find the people who did this dreadful thing. Now, this crime was carried out in another country, it was carried out in Indonesia and we therefore must work with the Indonesian authorities and the Indonesian police and intelligence agencies to try and track down the people who are responsible. And we have to get beside the Indonesians and work with them because it occurred in their country. Now, that is their main brief, they will go via Bali and obviously talk to some of the victims who are still in hospital there, and then go onto Jakarta. But President Megawati told me yesterday when I spoke to her that she would cooperate. It's very important Indonesia does because this foul deed occurred in Indonesia and obviously we need to work with the Indonesian Government in trying to track down the people who are responsible.</p>
<p><strong>WILSON:</strong></p>
<p>There seems to be a lot of conflicting information about whether or not terrorist cells are actually either dormant or active here in Australia. Do you have any information that they are?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, we have information about people. It's difficult for me to go into the detail of that information without running the risk of compromising sources. Let me say this - that every bit of information we've accumulated over recent times has been gone over in great detail during the last 48 hours and that will continue to be the case. And I want to assure the Australian people that we will do everything humanly possible to anticipate what might occur in Australia. I don't want to alarm people, but equally I don't want there to be a sense of complacency. We are not as at risk as many other countries because we have a different kind of society and we take a very tough, uncompromising attitude towards potential terrorism. But we are at some risk, everybody is and anybody who thinks that by their behaviour, or where they live, or the attitude they take on particular political issues, they can make themselves immune from a terrorist attack is deluding themselves.</p>
<p><strong>WILSON:</strong></p>
<p>Could that action that you're proposing include stationing military personnel at vital facilities?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, we are reviewing everything and we're talking to the State authorities and it's a question of when you're dealing with something like this, of arranging your priorities in the most sensible fashion. It is impossible for any free society to guard 24 hours of the day every potential target because in theory every building, every asset is a potential target. Wherever people gather, be at a club, a theatre, a church, a leagues club, whatever, they are all in theory potential targets.</p>
<p><strong>WILSON:</strong></p>
<p>Sir, you've also declared a national day of mourning this Sunday. What should we do to honour the memories of these people?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, I want people in their own different waysâ¦many people will attend church services, many won't according to their choice and I expect the churches will organise particular memorial services. I want people to reflect on the loss of life. I want them to reflect upon what it means in terms of the loss of innocence, if I can put it like that, in relation to this country's dealings with different parts of the world. And for all of us to re-double our efforts to make this a stronger country and to work together more closely to deal with this new challenge.</p>
<p><strong>WILSON:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, thanks for your time.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
