    <content><![CDATA[<p>Thanks, Mel and thanks everyone for being here.</p>
<p>Today is a wonderful opportunity to meet some extraordinary people – it really is.</p>
<p>I like to think that this is the people’s house but rarely have such extraordinary people gathered together as are gathered here today.</p>
<p>Mother’s Day in Australia began back in the 1920s and we were a very different world – a much more stoical society, a much tougher society in many ways.</p>
<p>Mothers did it tough then and Mother’s Day brought a bit of recognition into the lives of so many mothers who were doing it tough.</p>
<p>We are a different society. There will be many mothers today that are tucked up in bed being feted by their families and that is a marvellous thing but there are still mothers doing it tough and we should think of them today as we celebrate some remarkable mothers.</p>
<p>Every human being has a mother. We owe almost everything that we are to our mothers and that is why mothers should always be recognised and acknowledged.</p>
<p>A mother is someone who never puts herself first. A mother is someone who wants the best for everyone except herself and that is the quality of selflessness that marks out motherhood and which we celebrate today.</p>
<p>I must say I feel both inspired and humbled by the remarkable women whose stories we have shared this morning. Inspired, because so many of you have overcome extraordinary difficulties to be amazing for your children, for others’ children and for other mothers; these are really remarkable achievements and proof positive that we have got the seeds of greatness in us. It is amazing what people can do when we summon up the better angels of our nature and that is what every one of the mothers nominated today has done.</p>
<p>Inspiring, but for me also very humbling, because the mothers that we honour today have experienced things that would have broken many others. I am sure I would never have been able to cope with the kind of circumstances that the mothers that we celebrate today have been through.</p>
<p>So, well done.</p>
<p>I should pay tribute to the mother I know best – my wife Margie, who, for much of her married life has been pretty much a sole parent while I went off chasing my own dreams – and Margie, our kids have turned out well and that is much more to your credit than mine. So, thank you, and well done.</p>
<p>I should also pay tribute to my own Mum – a remarkable woman who dedicated her life to her children and, Mum, I hope you think we’ve turned out ok!</p>
<p>I obviously pay tribute to Louise Voigt, and Louise I am going to offer these to you because after so many years working for mothers, the least you deserve on Mother’s Day are some marvellous roses from <em>Roses Only</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, again, I pay tribute to all of our finalists.</p>
<p>Listening to your stories, every one of you should be Mother of the Year – you really should, because they are extraordinary stories – absolutely extraordinary, inspirational and uplifting stories.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, only one can be.</p>
<p>Mel, is it my job to make that announcement? Well, I am going to make that announcement.</p>
<p>All the finalists come up on the stage, please.</p>
<p>The Barnardos Mother of the Year for 2015 is Leanne Robson.</p>
