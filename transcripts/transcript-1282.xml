FOR PRESS P. M. No. 51/ 1966<br />
BRITISH ELECTION RESULT<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt.<br />
Mr. Wilson and his colleagues are to be congratulated<br />
on their clear-cut victory.<br />
* I feel it will strengthen the United Kingdom and<br />
benefit the Commonwealth generally now that the inevitable<br />
uncertainty resulting from -m evenly divided Parliament has<br />
been remedied. There has been, by practice and tradition,<br />
very cordial relations between Australja and the United Kingdom<br />
Governments regardless of domestic political philosophies.<br />
I have personally met many senior members of Mr.<br />
Wilson's administration and look forward to continued co-operation<br />
in our mutual interests.<br />
CANBERRA, 1st April, 1966 </p>
