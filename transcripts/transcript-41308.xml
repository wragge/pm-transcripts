    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>THE HON. DONALD J TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:</strong> Thank you very much it’s great to be here with Prime Minister Turnbull and Prime Minister Abe of Australia and of Japan.</p>
<p>You know them well, I know him well we’ve had many meetings. We’re having another one right now, primarily focused on trade, North Korea, other subjects.</p>
<p>But we’re very far along, the dialogue has been very good I think for all countries and we look forward to the continuation of that dialogue.</p>
<p>Mr Prime Minister did you want to add to that? </p>
<p><strong>THE HON. MALCOLM TURNBULL MP, PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA: </strong> Well thank you Mr. President, it is great to be with you and Prime Minister Abe.</p>
<p>We’re working very closely together. We’ve got the same values and the same focus in ensuring that the North Korean regime comes to its’ senses and stops this reckless provocation and threats of conflict in our region.</p>
<p>Peace and stability have underpinned the prosperity of billions of people over many decades and we’re going to work together to ensure we maintain it.</p>
<p><strong>HIS EXCELLENCY MR SHINZO ABE, PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN: </strong> [TRANSLATION]</p>
<p>For three of us, the immediate challenge is the issue of North Korea and also three very close partners with each other, Japan, the United States and Australia, share fundamental values as well as strategic interests.</p>
<p>So I do hope that we are going to have a meaningful discussion, particularly on the issue of North Korea, so as to ensure regional peace and stability.</p>
<p>And also I think, the key for us is to ensure very close bilateral cooperation so as to bring peace and stability on the ground.</p>
<p>So I do look forward to having a very productive discussion with the two of you.</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:</strong> In addition, a lot of things are happening on trade and I’ll be announcing pretty much what happens here and also with other meetings, including China, South Korea and lots of other places.</p>
<p>We’ll be announcing that for the most part in a statement, I’ll make it from the White House as opposed to from here. We’ll probably do that on Wednesday. We’ll give you a chance to tweet, because the Press, I have to tell you, I’m very impressed. You were able to hang in there, I’m very proud of you. It’s not finished. Please, we have one day left.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong> [Inaudible]</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:</strong> Excuse me. We’ll be making a statement when we get back, from the White House some time during Wednesday. It will be a very complete statement as to trade, as to North Korea, as to a lot of other things.</p>
<p>We’ve made some very big steps with respect to trade, far bigger than anything you know. In addition to about $300 billion in sales to various companies including China. That was $250 billion and going up very substantially from that. So we’ve made a lot of great progress on trade. We have deficits with almost everybody. Those deficits are going to be cut very quickly and very substantially.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA: </strong> Except us. Except with us.</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:</strong> You’re the only one! But if I check it I’ll probably find out that’s -</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA: </strong> Oh no. No, it’s real. It’s real Donald.</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p><strong>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:</strong> So we’ll be making a major statement on Wednesday and this has been a very fruitful trip for us and also in all fairness for a lot of other nations. The way they’ve treated us, the respect that Japan and China -  and South Korea in particular, because we went there – have treated us has been really a great respect for the people of our country, the people of the United States and we very much appreciate it, I will say that. There’s been a red carpet like nobody I think has probably ever received and that really is a sign of respect, perhaps to me a little bit, but really for our country and I am very proud of that.</p>
<p>So we’ll be making a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Thank you very much. </p>
