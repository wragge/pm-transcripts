13 August 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good to see you again.<br />
Well, ladies and gentlemen, over the past couple of days Cabinet has held a lengthy meeting and during<br />
that meeting the Government reviewed the first eighteen months of its time in Government. It has seen<br />
that eighteen-month period very much as involving the process of repairing the foundations.<br />
We have implemented our major election commitments. We have been remarkably successful in the<br />
process of deficit reduction and fiscal consolidation and indeed the thumping report card, in a sense, is<br />
what I see the speech made by the Reserve Bank Governor in Perth last night, is a testament to the success<br />
the Government has had in repairing the fundamentals of economy.<br />
I can't remember in the twenty three years that I have been in Parliament, a Reserve Bank Governor<br />
effectively saying that at the very least, in the short term, the speed limits are off economic growth in<br />
Australia. In the past, Reserve Bank Governors have been in the business of saying: you can't take the speed limits<br />
off because you will have a currency crisis, you will have a balance of payments crisis, or you will have a<br />
problem with inflation, or a problem with wages and I think it's quite a tribute to the success we've had in<br />
repairing those fundamentals.<br />
But, looking ahead, we see the next eighteen months of our time in Government in the first term as being<br />
very much bound up with realising our potential as a nation for the 2 1st Century and building on the<br />
foundation repair of the first eighteen months. And included in that of course, we believe, very much is the<br />
need for fundamental reform to Australia's taxation system.<br />
The most important decision that the Government has taken over the past two days is to really get utterly<br />
serious about the process of taxation reform:<br />
* to accelerate that process with a view to presenting before the Australian people a clear plan for<br />
taxation modernisation,<br />
* to give to the Australian people the opportunity of a fairer, better, more modern taxation system;<br />
* to reco~ gnise the reality that the present taxation system is lopsided and badly flawed so far as the<br />
Commonwealth State distribution is concerned;<br />
* it produces ridiculously high personal tax rates at the margin-,<br />
* it has an inefficient indirect taxation system and it is badly in need of repair.<br />
I have personally being a strong advocate of taxation reform for a very long period of time. I think it was<br />
a great national shame that the plan that was put before the Australian people in 1993, not that everything<br />
in that was perfect, far from it, but the commitment to fundamental tax reform was certainly a laudable<br />
goal and it was a great pity that a very negative and destructive campaign destroyed it, but that's history.<br />
We're now in 1997 and what we decided yesterday was to instruct a task force inside the Government to<br />
prepare a framework of options for reform. We've given broad guidance to that reform process and that<br />
broad guidance is really grouped around five principles. The first is: </p>
<p>there should be no increase in the overall tax burden;<br />
any new taxation system should involve major reductions in personal income tax with special regard to<br />
the taxation treatment of families;,<br />
consideration should be given, of course, to a broad based indirect tax to replace some or all of the<br />
existing indirect taxes;,<br />
there should be appropriate compensation for those deserving of special consideration;<br />
and reform of Commonwealth State financial relations must be addressed.<br />
There will, over the coming months, be a heightened process of consultation with interest groups. I will be<br />
formally in touch with the State Premiers, shortly, to convene a meeting between myself, the Federal<br />
Treasurer and the State Premiers, to discuss the Commonwealth/ State aspect of taxation reform. I have<br />
personally spoken to all of the Premiers this morning informing them of the Government's position.<br />
I believe that the community wants a better and fairer taxation system. It Is a very important ingredient in<br />
modernising the Australian economy for the 2 1st Century.<br />
Fundamental to our desire for taxation reform is a belief that any proper reform package has got to include<br />
significant reductions in personal income tax. There must obviously be a thorough examination of the<br />
introduction of a broad-based indirect tax to replace some or all of the existing indirect taxes and naturally<br />
as I have mentioned the issue of Commonwealth/ State financial relations must be comprehensively<br />
addressed. We won't be breaching our commitment about no GST or no new taxes during our first term in<br />
Government. I want to make it very clear to you that I have a strong personal commitment to taxation<br />
reform, that I have a very clear view of the directions that I would like to go in reforming the Australian<br />
taxation system.<br />
We had a very extensive discussion about this issue during our Cabinet meeting in there and there is very<br />
strong support within the Government and also on the soundings that I've been able to take this morning,<br />
within the Government Party Room, there is very strong support for a rapid acceleration of the process of<br />
taxation reform.<br />
It may have been temporarily derailed in 1993 but anybody who has the national economic interest at heart<br />
knows that we can not go into the 2 1st Century with our existing taxation system.<br />
We need a taxation system that gives incentives to ordinary Australians to save, to invest, to take risks.<br />
We need a taxation system that promotes job generation. We need a taxation system that helps, rather<br />
than hinders, exports and we need a taxation system that provides a more beckoning and a more<br />
encouraging investment climate.<br />
I believe that the great majority of Australians understand that. I don't underestimate the difficulty, nor<br />
indeed do] 1 underestimate the ease with which those who are the negative view on the is issue may try and<br />
generate a fear campaign.<br />
I would say to the Australian Labor Party, you once believed, and your two leaders supported that belief,<br />
in fundamental reform of the Australian taxation system. You abandoned that for partisan political<br />
purposes. I would have hoped that there might be some element of bipartisanship in relation to taxation<br />
reform but if it is the intention of the Leader of the Opposition to oppose, which today he has indicated,<br />
then he will be chaining himself to an outdated taxation system. He will be increasingly be seen as<br />
yesterday's man chained to yesterday's taxation system.<br />
I think that it is important that we meet this challenge, that we intend to do it and there's a very strong<br />
resolve inside the Government to move forward in that direction. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, do you have any unprincipled view of how tax power should be split between the<br />
Commonwealth and the States?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh look, I do have a number of views on that, I would like to share them with the Premiers first. The<br />
issue must be addressed, there is obviously going to be a range of views as to how you might do it, but<br />
obviously what everybody is... the phrase that is on everybody's lips, is the one that quite understandably<br />
the Premiers are concerned about and I understand that.<br />
JOURNALIST: When will you be meeting with them to discuss...?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh look soon, I'm not... I don't know when.<br />
JOURNALIST: What is the phrase on everybody's lips?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The phrase on overbids lips is vertical fiscal imbalance.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, when will the report of the Taskforce be released? Will that be viewed as a kind of<br />
agreeing paper?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, initially it is a report to us as a Government. What we do with it we'll decide when we see it,<br />
obviously though the community is going to be involved in the process. Look, obviously to be done<br />
properly it will take a little time but equally the Treasury is not starting form scratch on this issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you spell out your tax reform package before the next election?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The Australian public will have a very clear idea of where we intend to go.<br />
JOURNALIST: This Taskforce, is it Parliamentary...?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, this is just one headed by Treasury with representatives of the Tax Office, my Department, the<br />
Treasurer's office and the Cabinet Policy Unit.<br />
JOURNALIST: So what's a rough timetable...?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well as soon as we can get it, Michelle, I can't specify... I can't specify a week. I would expect to have<br />
it... I hope to have it within a few months but I am not going to put a time on it. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister you said the Australian public will have a very clear idea of where... [ inaudible] before the<br />
next election. Does that actually extend to you spelling out exactly...?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think at this stage it means what I say. I mean, I'm not going to, at this stage, predict the precise end<br />
point of detail of a taxation policy. But when I say I'll have a clear idea and a sharp choice, I mean that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are there any limits on the sorts of things that this Taskforce will look at? For example, diesel rebates<br />
and...? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, what has happened is that I've outlined the broad sort of guidance. But as well as that we're giving<br />
them, internally, a nudge in a number of directions.<br />
JOURNALIST: But the National Party's obviously put a lot of pressure on.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, there won't be any sort of.. there's no separate brief going to the committee from the National Party<br />
or from the Liberal Party. It's coming from the Government. All of those things will clearly be examined.<br />
I'm not going to today sort of say, well, look, we might do diesel, we might do this, we might do that<br />
that's pointless. We're going to look at all of those things. I think all of you know that there are a number<br />
of obvious options. There are some options you haven't thought of There would probably be some<br />
options that I haven't thought of I don't come to this cold either. I've got a pretty well-developed view<br />
of where I would like to end up. But there is a process involved. I want to involve the State Premiers. I<br />
want to involve the interest groups. I certainly intend to involve the Government Party Room by<br />
establishing a taskforce of government members to be heavily involved in the consultation process with<br />
interest groups and different sections of the community.<br />
JOURNALIST: There was a suggestion last week, Mr Howard, of legislation possibly before the election.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we haven't taken any decision on that. Look,<br />
JOURNALIST: Is that an coption?<br />
PRIME MlINISTER:<br />
Well, I'm not going to rule things like that in our out. Can I just say again that in whatever form it takes,<br />
the public will know where we stand and what to expect if they re-elect us at the next election.<br />
JOURNALIST: [ inaudible]... referendum.<br />
PRIME MIINISTER:<br />
Well, I don't think it's the sort of thing that should be subject to a referendum.<br />
JOURNALIST: </p>
<p>Mr Howard, earlier this year the Treasurer suggested that he didn't think there was a new or increased<br />
groundswell of community support, rather the same old chorus singing louder. What do you think is<br />
the... PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think it's a mixture. I think certainly the people that have sung loudly in the past are singing louder still.<br />
But I think there has been a mood change in the community. But I don't underestimate that there will<br />
people who will try and run a negative campaign about it. Fundamental tax reform is never easy but if it's<br />
ever going to be tackled it's got to be tackled from the vantage point of government.<br />
We've had a High Court decision which has underlined the fragility and the terminal character of the<br />
current division of Commonwealth/ State financial relations and in those circumstances the national interest<br />
does require us to address the issue. And we can do it in a way that's consistent with the commitments we<br />
made about new taxes during our first term.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you have any concerns that there will be enough money in the pot for those substantial cuts in personal<br />
incomes which Hugh Mackay seems to think are critical for public acceptance as some sort of<br />
consumption? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm confident that we can produce a package that will ignite incentive amongst Australians.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, from memory, when you were Treasurer you supported the States imposing their own income<br />
taxes. Do you support that view in terms of..?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh look, I'm not going to . that was that's almost 20 years ago. I remember it precisely in fact. But I'm<br />
not going to, sort of, muddy the waters of open-hearted, open-minded consultation between the<br />
Commonwealth and the States at this stage by speculating about what form it's going to take. I've<br />
personally spoken to each of the Premiers this morning. They indicated to me in our discussions that they<br />
were supportive of what I'm now announcing.<br />
I'm not going to canvass options about different Commonwealth/ State relations, different<br />
Commonwealth/ State financial relations at this stage. I want to hear their views. I want to talk to them.<br />
And it's entirely premature of me to start ruling individual approaches in and out.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you accept though, as the States view that on vertical fiscal imbalance there is a need for the States to<br />
receive a<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I accepted the system has got to be addressed and changed.<br />
JOURNALIST: [ inaudible]<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I'm not going to get I'm not going to go get into the detail of that because there are wondrous and<br />
variously different ways of doing it and it will, sort of, start hares running that I don't wish to go down the<br />
course at this stage. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Did Mr Carr give you any indication of his views on the GST when you spoke with him this morning?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Mr Carr and I had a spontaneous conversation. He said it was welcome news. That's what he said to me.<br />
And he also said that Mr Egan was going to make a very interesting announcement too about refunding<br />
the money. It's about time the drinkers of New South Wales got their dough back.<br />
JOURNALIST: But do you think that from the comments Mr Carr has made so far about a GST. [ inaudible].,.?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I think anybody's capable of being won over on a GST provided the GST is not seen as the core of<br />
tax reform. The core of tax reform in this country is to alter the balance so that individuals are paying less<br />
personal tax.<br />
JOURNALIST: So Mr Howard is a GST definitely one of those places that you want to end up to talk about?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I've indicated the broad guidance that's been given.<br />
JOURNALIST: You've used the word broad-based indirect tax...<br />
PRIME M[ NISTER:<br />
Well, the broad-based indirect tax is a generic description and I think it's appropriate to use a generic<br />
description. I'm not particularly wedded to a particular version of a broad-based indirect tax or a<br />
particular description of one. Obviously one of the things, and it's indicated in what I've said, one of the<br />
things that you have to look at if you reform the Australian taxation system is to whether you take away<br />
some or all of those existing indirect taxes, then you replace it with a broad-based indirect tax. Now,<br />
that's one of the things that will guide the work of this Taskforce.<br />
JOURNALIST: When you say that you will look at Commonwealth/ State finances as part of this reform are you just saying<br />
that you want to look at the way it's financed or that you envisage that there's possible realignment<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh look, I got into it very open-mindedly. I mean, it's more than I'm not going through a token exercise.<br />
JOURNALIST: But it's possible that you'd actually see a reordering of the<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it is it will be conducted on the basis that whatever options the States want to put on the table they<br />
can and we'll have a proper and open-minded discussion. But I'm not going to get into the business,<br />
Laura. I know you'd like me to but I'm not going to get into the business at this stage of, sort of, giving a<br />
nudge here or there in relation to the form in which reform of Commonwealth/ State financial relations<br />
would take.<br />
JOURNALIST: But in general terms would you regard yourself [ inaudible] </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Not even in general terms, no.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you regard yourself as a centralist, Mr Howard?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm a nationalist.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister is there...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There's a big difference. A nationalist is somebody who believes that all decisions should be governed by<br />
the national interest. A centralist is somebody who asserts that the central government is always the<br />
personification of the national interest. And I think there is a very important difference. And I am a<br />
passionate nationalist. I always have been. But I am not a centralist.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, is it going to look at the relationship between welfare and taxation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, they're obviously going to ensure that any reform gives special help to those in the community who<br />
need special help when taxation changes occur and therefore you have to look at welfare, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does that mean that the Taskforce will look at the concept of negative income tax?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The Taskforce is not limited in the various things that we'll look at. And as I said, in addition to the<br />
published guidance there are a few other criteria that are being provided. But the I wouldn't...<br />
JOURNALIST: [ inaudible]<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, because any government does that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, given that payroll tax is a State responsibility would discussion of the fuiture of payroll tax<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh look, I would imagine that that is one of the I mean, there's a whole range of options but I don't<br />
really want to I1 mean, the problem with my saying yes or no to this oh well, we are now certain that is<br />
in or out look, you all know as well as many others that there are a certain number of options available.<br />
It depends on the rate of any introduced broad-based indirect tax. Clearly all of those things are going to<br />
be examined. But I don't want to indicate because we haven't taken decisions on them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, has Cabinet been effectively deciding the next election will be fought on tax reform? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, we haven't effectively decided that. What we've decided in relation to tax is that we'll offer the<br />
Australian people a better, modern, reformed tax system for the 2 1st Century. And it looks at this stage as<br />
though our opponents want to, sort of, bump along with the existing system.<br />
JOURNALIST: Doesn't that make that [ inaudible]<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I think it will rate a mention in the campaign. I think it will rate a mention. But, I mean, the<br />
campaign can be fought on a number of things. Certainly the very successful general economic policies of<br />
the Government. The increased success, I believe, will then be evident through our industrial relations<br />
reforms. But obviously tax is going to rate significantly. But I'm not going to, at this stage 14, 15, 18<br />
months or whatever it is out from the next election I'm not going to say precisely what the next election<br />
is going to be fought on. What I am saying is that the Coalition will have a plan to take Australia into the<br />
2 1st Century with a modern, fairer, better tax system. Now, that's what we're going to have. And if Mr<br />
Beazley wants to muck around in the past, he can.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about the plan for industry, Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we had quite a discussion about that. I think industry policy has got a number of elements and many<br />
of those have been acknowledged by some of the reports that have been brought down. To have a decent<br />
industry policy you need low inflation, you need falling interest rates, you need reducing budget deficits,<br />
you need an improving trade account, you need industrial relations reform, you need other micro-economic<br />
reform, you need an aggressive programme of privatisation and you need a strong competition policy, you<br />
need decent infrastructure and you need a decent education system. I think everybody would agree who<br />
participated in this debate, agree on those things as underpinning any and comprising the main elements of<br />
any decent industry policy.<br />
The area of debate is about the extent to which you provide special subsidies or incentives either directly<br />
out of the budget or through the taxation system to encourage industry generally to invest or to give a<br />
come-on to particular industries, perhaps in particular areas or perhaps throughout the whole country.<br />
Now, that's what the debate is about. That's what Mortimer, that's what potentially Goldsworthy is<br />
about. It's about what the MTIA Report was all about. We don't argue about all of these other things.<br />
The argument is about the extent to which there are special incentives, concessions and subsidies made<br />
available. Now, what we've decided to do is get the Goldsworthy Report and also another report, the Cutler Report,<br />
on information technology strategies, and to get Goldsworthy and Mortimer and Cutler and the Economic<br />
Intelligence Unit one, although we didn't commission that but it's part of the mosaic, get all of those<br />
together and address this issue, that's really what it is nailed down to. And there are different proposals<br />
swirling around and there are different arguments about and we'll be addressing that aspect of it quite<br />
soon. JOURNALIST: [ inaudible]... position changed on that argument over the last couple of years?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh, I think I ought to give my colleagues the benefit of my view on that before anybody else.. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, going back to tax. It seemed to be a view last week in sections of the Government that it was<br />
a bit potentially dangerous to mix up general tax reform with Commonwealth/ State tax reform even<br />
though they are obviously related because this much has jeopardised your general tax reform programme.<br />
What led you to think that it's better to confront...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I wasn't away of that view and I wasn't there last week.<br />
JOURNALIST: So what's your feeling about that, that you...?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, the Government's position is as I've announced it and it's a very how shall I put it it's a<br />
unanimous view.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, isn't there are a danger that if you're going to do nothing for the next 18 months but talk<br />
about tax reform...?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we won't just be talking about tax reform, we will be doing a lot more than that. We will be<br />
consulting people, we will be developing the detail of our proposal to put before the Australian people and<br />
we will go very quickly.<br />
JOURNALIST: If your message is valid, and I suspect it is, that we are in need of tax reform, isn't that reason enough for<br />
you to ditch your promise of the last election and get on with the job?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, it's not. It's not because promises of that fundamental kind should be kept.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, you said in relation to industry policy that an important element was that we have a decent<br />
education system. Some of the reported comments from Senator Vanstone over recent days, it would<br />
appear that she, as the relevant Minister doesn't believe we have a decent education system, at least with<br />
respect of the public sector, public schools. What's your assessment of that and do you agree with it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
My assessment is that we do have a very strong public education system. I'll come to what you said. I<br />
think we have a very strong public education sector. You can criticise aspects of it as you can criticise<br />
aspects of the private education sector. I mean, as somebody who himself has been a total product of the<br />
public education sector, I am very grateful for the education that I received in the Sydney selective high<br />
school system and I won't have the public education system run down. I don't believe she did that though.<br />
I believe that she was stating some statistics in relation to the job achievements of people who had gone to<br />
different schools and I think it has been unfairly categorised as an attack on government schools. I didn't<br />
read it that way. I think you have to say in relation to government schools that those sort of comparisons<br />
don't make proper allowance for some of the circumstances in which government schools have got to<br />
operate. I mean, I am a very strong believer in competition in education and I welcome the fact that greater choice<br />
is now available to Australian parents as a result of the policy changes we have made in the area of the new<br />
schools policy but I want to make it very clear on behalf of the Federal government that we would always </p>
<p>regard a strong, well funded, strongly performing public education system as a very important part of the<br />
education mosaic in this country.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, on another social issue, do you endorse the ACT proposed heroin trial that the<br />
Commonwealth will be assisting with some resources and funds?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I have to say that I approach the whole question of heroin trials with enormous ambivalence. I remain<br />
unconvinced that there is a social benefit. It's hard to say that you shouldn't at least give a trial to<br />
something but you have to put me down as being a profound sceptic about the social advantage of<br />
legalising things that constitute a problem.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you endorse the Commonwealth....<br />
PRIME M[ INISTER:<br />
Look, what has happened has happened with the authority of the Minister and the Government. I guess<br />
you asked me what my view was and I gave it to you. I mean, there's nothing inconsistent in allowing it to<br />
take place and the view that I've expressed.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, Cabinet also..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Ah yes. I wondered when. Yes we did.<br />
JOURNALIST: cross media ownership, my favourite subject. Can you just explain just exactly where you got to and is<br />
Cabinet comfortable with the latest option that Senator Alston put forward?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No. No, I won't explain to you where we got to.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there a time table on it now?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The normal processes of the Government party room. We've had a discussion, a pretty good discussion, a<br />
pretty fruitful one and then there's going to be a chat between the Minister and the Committee and the<br />
Party. We're just going through the normal processes, we're going through the normal processes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard...<br />
PRIME MIINISTER:<br />
No, I didn't say that. I just say, we're going through the normal processes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, you've been critical of the outbreak of factionalism, you are opposed to factionalism per se.<br />
What do you think of the [ inaudible] in New South Wales overnight?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I saw the report in Mr Farr's newspaper. I don't know any more than that. I've been busy on other<br />
things this morning like ringing Premiers and getting ready for news conferences but I am quite a critic of </p>
<p>factionalism inside political parties, particularly the extent to which it emerges inside my own party. We<br />
won Government partly because we worked together and we displayed in Opposition, as we display in<br />
Government, the great reality of the broad church of the modern Liberal Party and it's very important that<br />
we preserve that but I don't, in making those observations, I don't to seek to sort of apportion particular<br />
criticism of or blame to particular sides.<br />
JOURNALIST: Was it unwise then for Nick Minchin to have turned up, do you think?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, I don't know the background of the meeting and look, I know nothing more than, Malcom Farr's<br />
newspaper's piece, it wasn't..<br />
JOURNALIST: You must like the name of the faction, the mainstream faction.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think people were trying to be a little flattering.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, having had one Cabinet meeting on unemployment, what's the next step in that process?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well there are always a number of options that are under consideration and that's an issue I have to say to<br />
you that Cabinet returns to on a very, very regular basis and we discussed it on Monday and I have no<br />
doubt we will be discussing it again next Monday and it's an ongoing process. I mean, we remain<br />
obviously concerned to do all we can to bring the rate of unemployment down. I am very encouraged by<br />
the remnarks of the Reserve Bank Governor for their significance in relation to unemployment. You will be<br />
aware that I said some time ago that we needed to get the Australian economy running at over 4% to start<br />
getting unemployment coming down.<br />
Now if you have somebody in the position of the Reserve Bank Governor saying, as far as he is concerned,<br />
the speed limits are off and you can run, at least in the short term, you can run the economy at up to<br />
That is very welcome. I mean, I go back to what I said earlier. I don't recall a Reserve Bank Governor in<br />
my time in Parliament having made such a comment. I mean, they are normally saying; you've got to keep<br />
applying the speed limits and keep the brakes on because it will spill over into, or perhaps somebody else<br />
talked about things spilling over, but it will spill over into imports, this or that will happen. Now I am<br />
quite encouraged by that.<br />
JOURNALIST: If the speed limit is off, Mr Howard, does that mean that you should be setting a growth target?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Ah. Well I am in favour of the maximum amount of economic growth that Australia can achieve. The<br />
idea of sort of committing yourself to a particular target is never one that's attracted me but if you're<br />
drawing up a ledger of whether people are high or low growth, you put me on the high growth, top of the<br />
high growth column. The whole object of our economic policy since I became leader at the beginning of<br />
1995 has been to make the changes that will enable the speed limits on economic growth to be removed.<br />
That's why we wanted fiscal consolidation to help the savings. That's why we wanted lower inflation, why<br />
we wanted micro reform, industrial reform. All of those things make a huge contribution. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: In your view, in the last 18 months, have you discussed the fact that the general community doesn't seem<br />
to share your view, the Reserve Bank Governor's view of the fundamental effect of the economy and how<br />
you... PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we weren't aware when we conducted the review of the Reserve Bank Governor's view.<br />
JOURNALIST: this conjlunction of remarkable economic circumstances isn't [ inaudible] how do you address that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It is, I mean obviously as part of any general political discussion you talk about community attitudes and so<br />
forth. I am not going to give you chapter and verse of that discussion but plainly, there needs to be a<br />
continued communications effort by myself and leading figures in the Government to explain the<br />
fundamental strengths of the Australian economy. I understand the mood of the Australian community. I<br />
also understand that we do have that very fortunate conjunction of circumstances of which I spoke in, near<br />
Newcastle some four weeks ago and I think it's very important that that be emphasised and it's very<br />
important that the positive side of the story be told repeatedly because there is a very positive story to tell,<br />
particularly about the last 18 months.<br />
I mean, It is remarkable what we've been able to do on fiscal consolidation. We have had all these<br />
reductions on interest rates. We are going to have a surplus in year three of our first term in Government.<br />
We have achieved a great deal more on workplace relations reform than we are being given credit. Some<br />
of our critics in that area have not even themselves taken advantage of the benefits of the changes that<br />
have already been introduced.<br />
I think this will have to be the last one otherwise I will be in trouble with my press secretaries. No,<br />
perhaps somebody who we've not had before. Do you mind?<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard you're talking about taking the speed limits off and of course that's great to have the Reserve<br />
Bank Governor is saying that but you have reduced a lot of the obstructions, as you call them in the<br />
economy, and it hasn't doubled growth. If you're going to double growth is there any other way of doing<br />
that other than actually stimulating the economy through incentives and...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We have been in power for what, 16 to 17 months and you say you haven't doubled growth. I mean,<br />
that's the equivalent of saying you haven't abolished unemployment. I mean, we have been there 16<br />
months. We have, the three or four major impediments that we inherited, we have addressed. I am not<br />
saying all of the things that we have done have run the full limit of their effectiveness because time is<br />
required, but what we have done in relation to the budget deficit has obviously contributed to falling<br />
interest rates and it has helped to improve the trade account.<br />
What we've done on industrial relations reform has obviously made a contribution towards removing some<br />
of the structural impediments. What we have done in relation to competition policy and privatisation have<br />
also made a contribution. All of those things themselves have made a contribution towards removing the<br />
speed limits. I don't favour some broad-based budget stimulus. We don't need that and I don't think any,<br />
I don't even hear some of the most interventionist leaders of industry calling for that. What they're calling<br />
for are some targeted incentives but I don't hear even the most interventionist of industry leaders saying,<br />
you know, we need to run a much bigger deficit. </p>
<p>I mean, they are all in favour, all of them, the MTIA's report last Sunday, they're all in favour of what<br />
we're doing on the budget. They applaud that, they call for it, they all want tax reform, they all want<br />
industrial relations reform. The industry policy debate has really, it really does narrow down, when you<br />
talk the nuts and bolts policies, the industry debate narrows down to the extent to which the Government<br />
intervenes in particular sectors or in a limited way across the whole economy to help industry by subsidies<br />
or tax incentives or other investment inducements of that kind.<br />
JOURNALIST: So is growth just a matter of waiting9<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the outlook for growth is very strong. I mean, some of it has arrived. It's not a question of waiting<br />
for it. We have very strong business investment. We have an enormous potential at actual business<br />
investment being undertaken in the mining sector. Now I know it's not right across the economy and I<br />
acknowledge that but the idea that the economy is idle and stagnant is completely wrong and it defies not<br />
only the figures but it defies the actual experience of many investors and business men and women out<br />
there in the market place.<br />
Thank you. </p>
