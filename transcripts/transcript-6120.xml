SR<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 27 May 1983<br />
The Prime Minister and the Chief Minister of the Northern<br />
Territory, Mr Paul Everingham, held lengthy discussions<br />
today on whether the Northern Territory Government was prepared<br />
7-o find room within its own priorities for the funding of<br />
of the construction cost of the Darwin/ Alice Springs<br />
railway. During the course of the discussion the Prime Minister suggested<br />
that the Chief Minister might consider an independent economic<br />
evaluation from the point of view of Australia, including the<br />
Northern Territory, of the relative merits of expenditure on<br />
the railway and the up-grading of the Stuart Highway betw'e en<br />
Darwin and Alice Springs.<br />
The Federal Government made it clear in the Economic Statement<br />
on May 19 that it was prepared to meet 60% of the cost of the<br />
railway. The Federal Government had undertaken that if this was<br />
not acceptable to the Northern Territory the Federal Govern~ ment<br />
was prepared to provide, in place of the railway, a higiher<br />
standard road link from Alice Springs to Darwin ( the Stuart<br />
Highway) by 1987.<br />
The Prime Minister reiterated that the Federal G3overnment was<br />
prepared to commit itself to 60% of the cost of the railway.<br />
But in the financial situation it had inherited, it would<br />
be irresponsible to go any further without much stronger evidence<br />
of economic benefits from the point of view of Australia as a<br />
whole, including the Northern Territory.<br />
The Prime Minister advised Mr Everingham that any delay in<br />
reaching a final decision on the Federal Government's proposal,<br />
should the Northern Territory decide against the railway, would<br />
lead to delays in the letting of contracts for the accelerated<br />
up-grading of the Stuart Highway.<br />
The Prime Minister asked for a response from Mr Everingham by<br />
the time he leaves for overseas on June 2, or at the cost of<br />
further delays in work on the road, should the Northern Territory<br />
decide against the railway, at the latest by June 24. </p>
