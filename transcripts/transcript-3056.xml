FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN AUSTRALIA<br />
The following is the text of a statement on foreign<br />
investment in Australia, made by the Australian Prime Minister,<br />
Mr Whitlam at the Austraiia-Japan Ministerial Committee<br />
Meeting in Tokyo on 29 October 1973:<br />
" The Australian Government recognises that foreign<br />
S investment in Australia is a matter of special significance<br />
for relations between our two countries. Australia is<br />
endowed with mineral resources of world importance. The<br />
proper development and prdent use of these resources is<br />
basic to our economic progress and growth. They are also<br />
of direct concern tc you as a large and long term importer<br />
of raw materials. The policies that we pursue in the development<br />
of our natural resources and the nature of the partnership that<br />
is established between Australian and Japanese investment will<br />
be a major factor in the future of our two countries and of our<br />
region. As you are aware the policy of my government is to<br />
adopt a more selective approach towards foreign investment in<br />
Australia than hithertc. No longer is there a wholly uncritical<br />
approach to foreign investmento We intend to ensure that<br />
foreign capital inflows are associated with productive<br />
investment which adds to Australia's real resources and brings<br />
us benefito This does not mean. that we have no wish to see further<br />
overseas capital flow into Australia.<br />
In the past foreign investment has made a very great<br />
contr. bution to the development of the Australian economy.<br />
Within a generation A-ustralia has developed from a largely<br />
agricultural and pastcra economy into a modern, increasingly<br />
industrialised and diversified economy. _ i </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The resources and know-how that the flow of overseas<br />
investment has brought have been of great value in this<br />
development. We believe that overseas capital must continue to<br />
play a significant role, in partnership with Australian capital,<br />
in our future economic growth.<br />
There is no general prohibition on foreign investment<br />
in Australia. My government has the firm policy objective of<br />
promoting Australian control of Australian resources and<br />
industries. We also want to achieve the highest possible<br />
level of Australian ownership of our resources and industries.<br />
By the phrase " the highest possible level of Australian<br />
ownership" we mean the highest Australian equity that can be<br />
achieved in negotiations, project by project, that are fair<br />
and reasonable to both parties and are within the capacity of<br />
our own savings to support. However in some special energy<br />
case, which I shall mention shortly, we do have a particular<br />
objective of 100 per cent Australian ownership.<br />
There will be no discrimination against Japanese<br />
investment, Japanese investment will continue to be given<br />
treatment as favourable as that extended anywhere else.<br />
This policy is being applied in a pragmatic way and<br />
all cases will be considered on their merits, This already<br />
applies in our examination of proposals under the Companies<br />
( Foreign Take-overs) Act. We aim to make our judgements taking<br />
into account the full circumstances of each new project or<br />
proposal, including such factors as the size and location of the<br />
proposed project, the use made of advanced technology, marketing<br />
arrangements, environmental aspects, labour relations and<br />
Aboriginal interests.<br />
There are certain industries where we regard<br />
Australian ownership and control of particular importance.<br />
These relate especially to sources of energy where growing<br />
world shortages and other factors make this essential.<br />
Uranium is one of these energy sources and we have an objective </p>
<p>-3-<br />
of full Australian ownership in development projects involving<br />
uranium. We also regard this as a desirable objective in<br />
oil, natural gas and black coal.<br />
We recognise however that Australia's resources<br />
of capital and technology are relatively limited, that the size<br />
of the projects to be undertaken is often very great and that<br />
we shall need to call upon overseas expertise, technology and<br />
capital to contribute to the proper development of these<br />
vital energy resources. Thus while we seek to require<br />
equity in new projects involving these four minerals to be<br />
in Australian hands. We do look for overseas participation<br />
in some ways: through access to technology, loans and<br />
especially long term contracts. The Australian Industry<br />
Development Corporation A. I. ID. C. is a basic means by<br />
which the government will seek to ensure Australian equity<br />
and control and there are important areas in which A. I. D. C.<br />
will be able to work both with overseas companies and<br />
Australian investors. Proposed increases in the percentage<br />
of foreign equity in existing projects which already have high<br />
overseas equity may well be subject to particularly close<br />
scrutiny. Our general object is to moderate such holdings in<br />
these projects. For other minerals our approach is more flexible.<br />
We desire partnership between Australian and foreign equity<br />
capital. I want to make it quite clear that there is no<br />
proscription of foreign equity participation in mining.<br />
The nature of the partnership between Australian<br />
and foreign equity capital that is appropriate in each case<br />
will need to be assessed on its merits. In some circumstances<br />
it may be acceptable for foreign investors to participate<br />
significantly in decision-making in a project. The size of<br />
the project, the amounts involved, and the type of mineral<br />
are all factors to be taken into account. In pursuing our<br />
objectives we shall be flexible and guided by the practical<br />
needs of particular cases.<br />
It is not our aim to have a different set of criteria<br />
for overseas participation in mineral exploration from those<br />
for participation in the development of proved mineral deposits. </p>
<p>In the uranium field in particular, and desirably<br />
also in oil, we aim to adopt the same sort of approach in<br />
exploration as I have already outlined for development of<br />
these minerals. However, in order to maintain a desirable<br />
level of exploration activity, we would, if necessary, accept<br />
a lower level of Australian ownership in exploration.<br />
Given the limited Australian capital resources<br />
available and the higher risks usually involved in exploration,<br />
there is, however, much to be said for concentrating Australian<br />
equity at the production stage.<br />
In some other sectors, successive governments have<br />
for decades restricted foreign investment. These include<br />
banking, civil aviation, radio and television and are no doubt<br />
well known to the Japanese government. Moreover investment<br />
from overseas for the establishment of new foreign-controlled.<br />
life and general insurance companies is generally not favoured.<br />
The go: ernment intends shortly to introduce<br />
legislation to control the activities of major non-bank<br />
financial institutions. Further overseas investment for<br />
the establishment of non-bank financial institutions is not<br />
favoured. In relation to foreign investment in real estate,<br />
the Treasurer indicated in a statement issued on 20 March<br />
1.973 that overseas interests should not enter into significant<br />
commitments for real estate purcnases in Australia for the time<br />
being and that the Reserve Bank would not normally grant<br />
exchange control approvals for foreign investment in real estate.<br />
The policy on this matter, which relates to rural as well as<br />
urban land purchases, is under intensive study. In the<br />
meantime any specific proposals will be examined on their<br />
merits. Let me emphasise however that in the generality of<br />
cases, for example in investment in manufactur. ing, our approach<br />
is a pragmatic one and that proposals by Japanese firms will be<br />
given equal weight to those by interests from other countries. </p>
<p>The Australian government believes that the policies<br />
on foreign investment, while designed to ensure a more selective<br />
approach than in the past, provide a framework which is flexible<br />
enough to allow mutually acceptable and beneficial arrangements<br />
through fair and reasonable negotiations. Our policies should<br />
establish relations between Japan and Australia on a sounder<br />
footing. If, there are any particular cases or questions that<br />
you have in mind, we would be happy to discuss them, either in<br />
the present meeting or subsequently. </p>
