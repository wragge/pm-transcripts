PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, HOTEL ROSSI, VANUATU<br />
1 AUGUST 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, does the communique mean<br />
that the weapons from West Germany should not be<br />
destroyed at Johnston Atoll?<br />
PM: What it means is that the Forum has expressed a<br />
concern about that issue. If you turn to the paragraph,<br />
it's about paragraph 28 as I recall. Yes 28. It says<br />
' While noting the stringent precautions being taken by<br />
the United States, the Forum remained concerned by the<br />
substantial potential risk to the environment and peoples<br />
of the Pacific of the whole operation, including, in<br />
particular, shipments of chemical weapons stockpiles from<br />
the Federal Republic of Germany'. So they've expressed a<br />
concern. JOURNALIST: Both Mr Palmer and Mr Namaliu have that<br />
the Forum will oppose the transport of weapons for<br />
destruction. PM: Well the Forum understands that there is nothing<br />
that can be done by the Forum about that issue. There<br />
was considerable discussion on the issue. There's no<br />
doubt, absolutely no doubt, some members of the Forum<br />
would clearly prefer that that not happen. There was no<br />
consensus on that point. The communique goes as far as<br />
there was consensus.<br />
JOURNALIST: Was it a humdinger of a debate as Geoffrey<br />
Palmer said?<br />
PM: Well it may be a humdinger by New Zealand standards.<br />
By the standards of the Australian Labor Party it was<br />
pretty tame.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does it mean that the weapons shipments<br />
will go ahead?<br />
PM: Let's just get the framework right. The Forum was<br />
never going to be able to determine what was going to<br />
happen. The best that the Forum can do on this issue was<br />
to express its point of view. As I say, the communique<br />
of the Forum goes as far as there was consensus and I<br />
obviously acknowledge, as I would've before the Forum,<br />
that there were points of view which go beyond the<br />
consensus contained in the communique. 9 </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Why do you think you failed to convince the<br />
Forum communique<br />
PM: Why did I fail to get the Forum<br />
JOURNALIST: Persuade. Why were you unable to-<br />
PM: Unable to persuade them to adopt a communique to<br />
stop-JOURNALIST: The shipment of weapons.<br />
PM: Because I never set out to do that. So how can I<br />
fail in something I didn't set out to do. I mean I<br />
accept as a politician that I can be accused of failure<br />
if I try to do something and I don't achieve it. I don't<br />
accept that it's a reasonable proposition that I failed<br />
in something I didn't set out to do.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: No but you heard what she was saying. It was the<br />
other way around. What I am putting is that I put to the<br />
Forum my view and the consensus of the Forum has not put<br />
an opposite to my point of view. I mean it hasn't said<br />
this shouldn't happen. It has expressed its concern. I<br />
think that's the appropriate consensus to have. I mean<br />
if you've got a range of opinions there from one which<br />
says they at one point some of them didn't want any<br />
action at all on Johnston Atoll. You've got some for<br />
that point of view to mine where I think on balance it is<br />
for disarmament reasons best that the FRG stock goes<br />
there for destruction. Now those positions remain. I<br />
hold mine and we have a consensus which goes as far as is<br />
possible and that is to express the concern that people<br />
have about the potential risk. I am perfectly relaxed<br />
about that outcome. It seems to me directly in line with<br />
the best that I could've hoped to achieve.<br />
JOURNALIST: So you weren' t rebuffed?<br />
PM: Look, this is infantile. I mean, with respect, it's<br />
infantile. I was neither rebuffed, nor was the absolute<br />
Australian position endorsed, which I never had any<br />
expectation it would be. The important thing that has<br />
happened out of the discussion is that the Forum has<br />
expressed the view that there should be the destruction<br />
of chemical weapons.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke,<br />
PM: Wait a minute, let me finish. That they have<br />
expressed the view that there should be the destruction<br />
of chemical weapons and they have expressed their<br />
concerns about the possible dangers. Certainly the view<br />
is quite clear, which is Australia's view as well, that<br />
the absolute limit of what should be done at Johnston<br />
Atoll is the three categories. That is those 1800 tonnes<br />
of weapons which are on Johnston Atoll, other stocks<br />
which may be elsewhere in the Pacific, and the stocks </p>
<p>from the Federal Republic of Germany. And beyond that<br />
there should be no more activities there and as far as<br />
the balance of United States stocks are concerned, they<br />
should be destroyed at replica plants on the mainland<br />
United States which is the intention of the United<br />
States. JOURNALIST: said previously by Mr Palmer and Mr<br />
Namilau, have left the clear impression that the Forum<br />
sent a message, definite message to the United States<br />
shipments of those stocks from the FRG Johnston<br />
Atoll... PM: I repeat, I would've thought that this is not a<br />
complex issue. I mean that what I've said in terms of<br />
what's here in the communique makes it quite clear. Let<br />
me, as it does not seem to have been understood, go to<br />
what the wording of the communique is on this issue.<br />
' While noting the stringent precautions being taken by<br />
the United States, the Forum remained concerned by the<br />
substantial potential risk to the environment and peoples<br />
of the Pacific of the whole operation, including, in<br />
particular, shipments of chemical weapons stockpiles from<br />
the Federal Republic of Germany'. They expressed concern<br />
about the whole particularly the shipments of<br />
chemical weapons stockpile from the Federal Republic of<br />
Germany. But they understand that the weapons have to be<br />
destroyed and in regard to those that are there on the<br />
atoll I think there was almost unanimous agreement that<br />
they should be destroyed there. So there's an expression<br />
of concern. But there it is.<br />
JOURNALIST: your reading of that communique, the<br />
Forum is not sending a message to the United States that<br />
they should not send those weapons?<br />
PM: That would be the preference of some members of the<br />
Forum. That would be the preference. I don't want to be<br />
rude to you but how many times do I have to make the<br />
point, and I'll make it again, and I would hope that it<br />
gets through to you. Because it's not a complex point.<br />
It's a very simple point. This is a consensus document.<br />
So a consensus document by definition, if you understand<br />
the word consensus, goes as far as expressing a view held<br />
by all. And that's what it does. So it doesn't go as<br />
far as to say the Forum is saying that all members are<br />
agreed that shipments should not come from the Federal<br />
Republic of Germany. Because there was no such<br />
consensus. It expresses a concern about potential<br />
problems. Ok, I'm quite relaxed about that. But you<br />
could not have a consensus document which said all<br />
members of the Forum were saying that shipment shouldn't<br />
come from the Federal Republic of Germany. Now I repeat,<br />
that is essentially a very simple proposition which is<br />
reflected in the communique.<br />
JOURNALIST: I think I'm across that simple proposition.<br />
Rabbie Namilau's across it because </p>
<p>PM: Well you would have to ask Mr I mean I'm not here<br />
to answer for Mr Palmer, nor am I here to answer for Mr<br />
Namilau. I'm here to answer for Australia, which I'm<br />
doing. JOURNALIST: But Mr Namilau's the Forum chairman and<br />
PM: No he was not the Forum chairman. I mean if you<br />
don't know that by this<br />
JOURNALIST: Forum spokesman, and he has presented that<br />
view to us here tonight.<br />
VAUGHAN: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: The gentleman here is saying that's not so. That he<br />
read the communique to you.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well he did but he also<br />
PM: Well if he read the communique to you it's quite<br />
clear. And I would've assumed that he would do that and<br />
the communique is in terms that I've put it and with the<br />
limitations that I put. And however much, and I know<br />
that you don't want to come all this way without the<br />
possibility of a story, but go beat, beat beat, beat-up,<br />
you will not change in any way, if you're going to be<br />
accurate, the reality of what I've put to you. Because<br />
I'm not making up something. I'm telling you what's<br />
there, I'm telling you factually, I'm telling you what a<br />
consensus is and I'm telling you how far that consensus<br />
communique has been able to go in expressing the view of<br />
the Forum as a whole.<br />
JOURNALIST: How do you expect the United States to<br />
respond to the concerns?<br />
PM: I don't know. I hope they will take it seriously.<br />
Clearly what I want to happen is that we will in this<br />
twenty-one month period take the opportunity to a) have<br />
reported to us what's happening, b) I would hope that<br />
scientists from the Forum would actually go there and<br />
have the opportunity of seeing what's happening and c)<br />
and most importantly, we will certainly be conveying to<br />
the United States those questions that have been raised<br />
in the report which we have circulated to all Forum<br />
members. They have the complete reports that were<br />
available to me and you will see that there were certain<br />
questions raised there. We will raise them with the<br />
United States and I hope they'll be taken into account.<br />
JOURNALIST: Was Australia the only country to stand in<br />
the way of the resolution which might have condemned the<br />
transportation of weapons<br />
PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible) </p>
<p>PM: I'm not going to what happened in terms of<br />
individual positions within the Forum. I answered that<br />
question but I don't go to disclose positions of<br />
particular Forum countries. I mean if you want to try<br />
and find that out you do, but I'm not going to it.<br />
JOURNALIST: You acknowledge that some of the countries<br />
did obviously want the final to go as far as How<br />
hard did you have to argue with them not to<br />
PM: I didn't let me see. How hard did I have to go?<br />
Not as hard as I've had to go on some issues in my<br />
political career. I expressed the view, as I always do,<br />
did it generously, articulately and with a compassionate<br />
view of alternative positions.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's happened to the scientific mission<br />
that you proposed yesterday and today I understand?<br />
* PM: I would think that what is likely to happen -and<br />
let me make this point. The other members of the Forum<br />
made the point that they haven't got the scientific<br />
personnel to participate on a scientific basis in such a<br />
mission. But I would think it would make sense, and it's<br />
perfectly compatible with paragraph 29 ' The Forum<br />
therefore called for early discussions with the United<br />
States on all aspects of the JACADS operations, including<br />
the shipment of stockpiles from FRG.' That it's<br />
consistent with that that we should send some scientists<br />
there. And as I said in the discussion, despite the fact<br />
that our fellow members of the Forum may not have the<br />
scientific qualified personnel, I still think it would be<br />
sensible for some of them to go with our scientists.<br />
Because it wouldn't be satisfactory, I think, in the<br />
circumstances just to have Australians and New Zealanders<br />
there. I think we should have some other people with us<br />
so that they can have the opportunity of asking questions<br />
and being informed.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you said earlier on that you<br />
didn't want to come to the Forum telling the Pacific<br />
nations what to There's obviously been a very long<br />
debate this afternoon. Were you forced into the position<br />
though of trying to direct them where they didn't want to<br />
go? PM: No, of course not. I mean I would've thought that<br />
you would've understood from my statements of yesterday<br />
that I'm very conscious of the position of Australia. We<br />
have a responsibility to put our knowledge and our<br />
position before the Forum. It would be an insult to our<br />
fellow members of the Forum if we didn't share with them<br />
the knowledge that we have and the positions that we<br />
adopt on the basis of the knowledge we have. Now having<br />
done that, having put your positions, you don't stand<br />
there and say now look, Big Brother has spoken, that's<br />
the position that you must adopt. You do your best to<br />
try and persuade and there is no doubt that as a result<br />
of the position that I've put there is a reflection of<br />
the Australian position within the communique. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: What do you think motivated some of the<br />
small island states to oppose this proposal so<br />
vigorously? PM: I have no doubt what motivated them to do it. If<br />
you hear of a proposition which is involving the<br />
destruction of chemical weapons and there are suggestions<br />
made by people, as there have been without being<br />
exhaustive about it, and without being condemnatory of<br />
them. But Greenpeace for instance have expressed<br />
concerns and those concerns that have been expressed have<br />
raised apprehension in the minds of these people. That's<br />
perfectly natural. It's what one would expect. I<br />
certainly think they wouldn't have been doing their duty<br />
in this Forum if they hadn't raised those concerns.<br />
There's nothing esoteric about why they would express<br />
those concerns. I would be surprised if they hadn't.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you accept the line from Mr Palmer where<br />
he said that Forum nations are very concerned that<br />
sending the stockpiles from Germany could create a<br />
dangerous precedent for other countries to use the<br />
Pacific as a dumping ground?<br />
PM: I think that that will not happen. I think the<br />
Forum was correct to express the general point of view,<br />
which they do, that we don't want the Pacific to be<br />
regarded by metropolitan powers as a convenient dumping<br />
ground either for hazardous waste or the testing of<br />
weapons, that it shouldn't be thought of in those terms.<br />
But in regard to Johnston Atoll, I remind you that the<br />
position there is that there are the three categories.<br />
We'll be certainly, from Australia's point of view as<br />
well as the Forum, making it quite clear that we expect<br />
the United States to adhere to what they've said. That<br />
is that there will only be the 1800 tonnes on Johnston<br />
S Atthoaltl , t hearney woitlhle rsb e foau nfdi rmi n antdh e cPoamcpilfeitce aenxdp ecthtea tiFoRGn atnhdat<br />
the rest of the United States stocks of chemical weapons<br />
shall be destroyed in the mainland United States in the<br />
eight plants, in the eight populated areas of the United<br />
States where those plants are planned to built. Now if<br />
that's done, and I expect without question that it should<br />
be done and will be done, then I don't see that there's<br />
any precedent for any other countries to say well we'll<br />
come and try and do this in the Pacific. And what you've<br />
got to remember is that they would have to have a place,<br />
any other power would have to have a place in the Pacific<br />
where they could do it. That, as far as I know, wouldn't<br />
be available to them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, are you aware that the US Congress<br />
has passed an amendment requiring a feasibility study to<br />
look at transporting chemical weapons from the sites<br />
where they are and do you think one can still have<br />
confidence in Senator Cheney's assurance that they will<br />
not be moved to Johnston Atoll?<br />
PM: Yes. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on another issue<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you aware of the amendment?<br />
PM: Just a minute, just a minute. I'll come back to<br />
you. Don't feel that you're going to be ignored.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you meet with Ratu Mara this afternoon<br />
and, if you did, how did the discussions go and what did<br />
you cover?<br />
PM: Answer, yes, I did meet with Ratu Mara for a period,<br />
I think, of about 40 minutes during the break. The<br />
discussion was conducted amicably. I can't go to<br />
everything that was discussed, but clearly the issues<br />
were essentially what has happened and likely<br />
developments within Fiji and the Fiji-Australia<br />
relationship. That was the generic area of the<br />
discussions. I conveyed to the Fijian Prime Minister the<br />
concerns Australia has about the developments and made<br />
that clear, but didn't, you know, go on and on and on at<br />
great length made the point. I was concerned<br />
essentially now to talk about the future and I believe<br />
that despite the flaws that have been referred to, that<br />
the situation is that the Constitution will now provide<br />
an opportunity for Fiji to return to a form of<br />
representative government and there is no doubt that in<br />
that sense the new Constitution will provide at least a<br />
firmer basis for government than the interim arrangements<br />
which have been in place since the coups of 1987. I<br />
think one must say that regrettably, but realistically,<br />
there appears to be no likelihood that a significantly<br />
different Constitution would be agreed upon in Fiji at<br />
the moment. Now that seems to be a realistic assessment<br />
of the situation. Now, obviously, I make the judgement<br />
that it is a matter for the coalition interests to make<br />
their own decision as to whether they are going to<br />
participate in the processes under the new Constitution.<br />
That's their decision and no-one else's decision. But I<br />
expressed the view and I have the view that it, there<br />
would be, I think, value in their reconsidering their<br />
initial statement that they're not going to participate,<br />
that they're going to boycott the processes. It seems to<br />
me that it's important that all groups in Fiji should<br />
stay engaged in the parliamentary processes and, for as<br />
far as it's possible in that way, for the multi-racial<br />
traditions of Fiji to be kept alive. Now clearly, as far<br />
as the future is concerned, how the relations between<br />
Fiji and Australia will develop will depend, amongst<br />
other things, upon how the system of government develops<br />
under the new Constitution and, may I say, particularly<br />
including the extent of military influence. So these<br />
were the range of issues and the basis upon which I<br />
conducted the discussion with the Prime Minister of Fiji.<br />
JOURNALIST: boycott, do you believe that this<br />
Constitution is broadly acceptable to the majority of<br />
Fij ians? </p>
<p>8<br />
PM: Well, there's obviously a significant proportion of<br />
the Fijian population that don't accept it. I mean, the<br />
interim government would acknowledge that, but having<br />
said that and we have referred to what are perceived as<br />
inadequacies, you've got to now ask yourself, is thereany,<br />
is there any possibility, any realistic possibility,<br />
of there being a different Constitution adopted and if<br />
the judgement is made that there is not, then it seems to<br />
us that what needs to happen is to try and get the system<br />
of representative and parliamentary government going<br />
again, even from the point of view, those who would<br />
prefer to see what they regard as a better and more<br />
representative Constitution, to try and get this going<br />
and on that basis, see if subsequently there may be the<br />
basis of change. I'm sorry, now someone was saying I<br />
haven't answered a question.<br />
JOURNALIST: question was whether you were aware that<br />
the US Congress had passed<br />
PM: The answer to that is no.<br />
JOURNALIST: If the elections are held in Fiji over the<br />
Constitution by the Council of Chiefs, and if Rabuka<br />
is elected as Prime Minister and he attends the next<br />
Forum, obviously Mara is not going to attend. Will you<br />
attend the Forum, next Forum, next year if Rabuka comes?<br />
PM: Yes, I'll be at the next Forum. Of couse I will be.<br />
Well, when I say of course I will be, I mean, all other<br />
things being willing, but I don't have my attendance,<br />
whether it's at the Forum or at the Commonwealth,<br />
determined by other people. I go to the Forum and I go<br />
to the Commonwealth to represent Australia's point of<br />
view and to advance Australia's, both Australia's<br />
interests and Australia's concerns, as to how it may be<br />
able to be of assistance to others. If you take the<br />
situation of the Commonwealth, for instance, that group<br />
of some 50 nations, the fact that I sit down with some 49<br />
other leaders from the Commonwealth doesn't mean that I<br />
embrace the Constitutional position of every state there<br />
at the Commonwealth. Far from it. There are<br />
Constitutional positions in some of the Commonwealth<br />
countries that, may I say, are significantly less<br />
democratic, significantly less democratic than the<br />
proposed Constitution of Fiji. But the fact is that you<br />
go, you discuss the issues that are before, whether it's<br />
the Forum or the Commonwealth, and you do it in a way<br />
which is based upon what you think is going to best<br />
advance the interests of your own country and the others<br />
with whom you're meeting.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I don't think anyone went into this Forum meeting<br />
believing that we were going to determine what the United<br />
States would do. But I think there is a chance that out<br />
of this meeting certain concerns that we have are going<br />
to be able to be addressed to the United States. Let me<br />
say that I believe that in talking to the United States </p>
<p>9<br />
now I will not only have the authority of speaking as far<br />
as Australia is concerned, but I will certainly be able<br />
to say on particular issues that have been raised by my<br />
scientists that I've shared this information with my<br />
colleague countries in the South Pacific and they at<br />
least, at the very least, share those concerns. So that<br />
in speaking to the United States there will be that added<br />
authority. I believe that the United States will listen<br />
seriously to what we've got to say because I can assure<br />
you that I-will be putting these issues to them very<br />
seriously. ends </p>
