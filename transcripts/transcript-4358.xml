4-AUSTRAWAI<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 4 APRIL 1977<br />
N. S. W. LIBERAL PARTY DINNER, SYDNEY<br />
There are times, I believe, during the course of an election<br />
when the people of a nation make fundamental choices about the<br />
sort of country they want to live in.<br />
A choice of one party over another at such watershed elections<br />
maps out the future; it determines whether some alternatives<br />
are made more difficult to take up in the future.<br />
This is a point which all of us, as Liberals, are conscious of.<br />
We know that it is not easy to limit the power of the State<br />
after it has developed past a certain point. It is not easy<br />
to restore the conditions necessary for individual initiative and<br />
enterprise after they have been beaten down for a prolonged period<br />
It is not easy to get State governments to accept responsibility<br />
after they have been long deprived of it. It is not easy to<br />
quickly restore the private sector to health after it has been<br />
stifled into stagnation and despair.<br />
Watershed elections mark the point at which decisive choices<br />
are made. 1949 was such an election. In that year, Australian<br />
voters voted firmly against nationalisation and govertment<br />
Q by regulatUon. Had that choice not been made, then it would have<br />
been increasingly difficult to make later.<br />
The capacitiesupozuwhich Australia depended for progress and<br />
growth, the intiative and creativity of the Australian people,<br />
would have been undermined.<br />
-1975 was another watershed election. The power of the Labor<br />
government, and its intrusion into more and more areas of<br />
Australian life was increasing. The economic malaise which Labor<br />
had thrown Australia. into, was growing deeper.<br />
All Australians were gravely damaged by Labor approach. In<br />
Labor4a last-two -years, persistent inflation of over 16 percent;<br />
unemployment had trebled; wages had grown enormously; </p>
<p>average earnings in imanufacturxing industtry had grown 53 perccent<br />
in tb-e. two years to October 1975; company profitability<br />
, was di sastrous; the deficit was out of control.; there was<br />
cSord level of i-n. dustrial disputes. Far worse than in 1975;<br />
Government was printing money at an excessive rate; there<br />
was a mzjor shift of resources from the private to the public<br />
sector,<br />
those'least able ,/ to defend themselves the poor, the unemployed,<br />
those on fixed-incones suffered cruelly. The Labor Party<br />
ha not learne-d from the damnage they caused to many areas of<br />
our life. Only a few days, ago, Mr Whitlam made a proposal<br />
that woul~ d effectively mean. all women under 60 would be<br />
given unamplcyro-nt benefits. Thids would cost $ 3,300 illion.'<br />
Acost all wsrla~' ould have to pay for in terms of increacC4<br />
taxes or higher inflation.<br />
The Liber al National Country Party Government has now been in<br />
office for fifteen ront-hs-This has not been long enough to<br />
redress all. the damage inflicted by Labor. It has been long<br />
enough, to make a start in restoring the private sector to vitbu.<br />
and health. A start to reducing inflation.~ A start in halting;<br />
uncontrolled growth of the public sector in this country.<br />
kard the stiatwe have made has been a substantive one.<br />
Fundamental ito the progress w~ uich bar. been made XS. the principle<br />
that the only sure road to full economic recoveiry is the revival<br />
strong innovxtive private enterprise. To do this, we have<br />
implerented a proper vonetaxy policy. We have argued strongly<br />
before the krbit-ration Commission for the wage restraint which it?<br />
essential to zreducing inflation. We have an appropriately balanee9,<br />
external policy. We have pixrseed a responsible budgetary policy.<br />
-The , ravth of the public sector has been halted. On<br />
current estimates, the proport bn of gross national product<br />
attributable 6%. o the ~ Comonwealth will fall this financial year<br />
The rapid growth'-of the Commonwealth public service has been revese
By reducing staff ceilings, we will have cut the nixmber of<br />
Co~ mnwealt. government employees by ] 4,000 by June this year.<br />
Conpaxed to ! Mr WbitAam's staff ceiliags this is a reduction<br />
of 33, I000--<br />

established a record in this area of which ' any Liberal can be prc0_ c.<br />

<p>' rhee-ws a 5? signifcant improvement--i -the -rate--o, inflation<br />
the most reliable figures we have avallahle showed an inflationi<br />
&amp; vrc of 10.~ 7 percent, compared with a rate of around 16 pex76 -f--ii -1 * l<br />
A start has been made a good start. But both inflation and<br />
unemployment must be reduced further.<br />
The recovery, oif which the early signs are now apparent, must<br />
be sustained and consolidated. We are coordinating all the arms<br />
of economic policy controlled by government fiscal, monetary<br />
external. policy. To ensure that the downward trend in the<br />
underlying rate of inflation which we have achieved in 1976,<br />
is Maintained. For the defeat of inflation is the esential<br />
pre-reqtLisite for employment and long term economic growth.<br />
There is another area where the government has, introduced<br />
major new initiatives I refer to our new policies of Federalisr,<br />
The Whitlam Government believed that all problems were best; solved<br />
by the all-knowing Coimn nwealth Government. Labor was not<br />
prepareed to leave decisions of importance to the States. Just ag<br />
were not: prepared to leave to individual Australians choices<br />
affecting their-own lives.<br />
The Whitlam Governint, consistent with their ideology, were<br />
thoroughgoing centralists.<br />
They used zll the Comm1onwealth's power to. intervene in fields<br />
which had previously been-th preserve of the States. We havet<br />
lntroduced a new' edrlspolicy wIh has reversed i<br />
inexorable, slide towards ever. increasing Commonwealth domina-tion~-.....<br />
central to this policy is our initiative ol tax sharing. The State<br />
now receive! a fixed percentage of personal income tax<br />
receipts. Stage 11 of the tax sharing arrangements will be<br />
the subject of discussion with the States at the Premier's<br />
Conference next week. It will enable each State to impose a<br />
surcharge or grant a rebate, on personal income tax collected by<br />
the CoxrimnireAlth.<br />
Tax sharing will give the states a greater autonomy and capacity<br />
to meet their responsibilities. it will also make themn more<br />
accountable-. The states will be able to set thieir own priorities.<br />
They have received generous grants from-[ he Commuonwealth thie; year<br />
and a far higher proportion of these are untied. This gives increasesi<br />
independenlce to the States. And alsuincreased responsibility.<br />
If a State chooses to give a high priority tq &amp;-particular new<br />
project, or grant a new tax concession,. that is its right.<br />
But it will have to justify its priority to its citizens.<br />
No longer will states be able to blame the (_ Cmmouwea. 1th for their<br />
own deficiencies.. -And--th-at-i-s-the-way it should'-e<br />
Our commitment to Federalism extends far beyond financial matters.<br />
. I-awide range of matters, the Commnonwealth has been r . eady to<br />
consult and cooperate with the States. An excellent example is<br />
our recent preliminary agreement with the States on companies<br />
and the securities industry. While many details have yet to be<br />
finalised, it has been agreed that a National Companies and<br />
Securities Commission be established. This mnuch-needed reform has<br />
been achieved with the full cooperation and backing of the States. </p>
<p>Its approach stands in sharp contrast to the centralist legisilatioRI<br />
' which Labo; r tried unsuccessfully to push through without<br />
Consl . tation with the States.<br />
There are a npuJ~ ber of other areas in which the Commonwealth 1! 3<br />
currently seeking with the States, an agreed sharing of powers.<br />
And th4 adoption of complementary policies and the elimination<br />
of unnecessary duplication. Both the Commonwealth and the States<br />
have passed legislation requiring environmental impact statements<br />
to be made before certain projects may proceed.<br />
We are seekcing to ensure that in each case, only one environmental<br />
assessment need be m~ ade. One which satisfies the requirements<br />
of both spheres-of gover-m-nent. Discussions with the States to<br />
achieve the end are well wider way.<br />
I am pleased to be able to say that the responsible minister,<br />
Kevin Newman, has progressively reached accord with each of his<br />
StAte counterparts with whom discussions have taken place.<br />
Perhaps the most important outstanding matter regarding PederalSt( ac .<br />
relations is the vexed question of jurisdiction over the sea and<br />
seabed off the coast of Australia.<br />
A Comonwealth Act, the Seas and Submerged Lands Act, was passed in<br />
1976. it jeclares that sovereignty over the'Australian territoriaL<br />
sea aud coxtinental shelf is vested in the Commonwealth.<br />
. T~ he validity of that-Act has been upheld by the High court.<br />
In theory, the Commnwealth could now assume exclusive powers<br />
-over. a wide range of activities. Shipping, navigat16n, marine<br />
pollution, offshore mining, fisheries, marine parks, even jetties<br />
and other port. facilities, extending below low-water mark.<br />
M4any of these fux~ ctions have been carried out -in the mxain quite<br />
satisfactoricly by the States-But the legal basis for some<br />
of such activities has been thrown in doubt. A further difficulty<br />
is that there is a pressing need to ratify certain international<br />
conventions which affect offshore areas,<br />
Despite the apparent potential. for Comonwealth intervention,<br />
we believe that Commnonwealth/ State cooperation is essential.<br />
Ther ' e would be little point, for example, in the Commronwealth<br />
making decisions about the siting of port facilities.<br />
And we have no interest in doing so.<br />
Some people appear to have forgotten that State cooperation is<br />
essential in many matters.<br />
-If the State concerned was not prepared to provide the roads,<br />
railway, and other infrastructure to service the port, then any<br />
plans the Commonwealth might have could not succeed.<br />
Similarly, the use of offshore power in many areas depends on.<br />
the agreement of the States, who control the land. </p>
<p>The Cormzonwialth has no intention of assuming roles, that have<br />
long been pc-rfornt~ d satisfactorily by the States. It may wel~ l<br />
be -nec'essary to devise -entirely new approaches in this area.<br />
We must ensure that the states have constitutional power, -to<br />
exercise those functions which properly they should be able to<br />
exercise. I am confident, that the skills and imagination<br />
of the legal advisers of the Comnwealth and the States, are raore<br />
than adequate to meeL thisa challenge.<br />
I have put ILn hand a comprehensive review of all aspects of thiLs<br />
many side pr~ oblem.<br />
When the review is complete, we shall be consulting further with<br />
the States.<br />
The new federalism policy of the Government, confers more real<br />
power on the States.<br />
But it also places on the States greater responsibility.<br />
Regrettably, todate, this sense of responsibility has not always.<br />
been demons trated in state programmes. For example, there is<br />
at present a clear need for maximum restraint in government<br />
spending. The Coionwealth has played its part by dutting back<br />
progranunes and reducing the Commonwealth public service, but the<br />
States have allowed their public services to increase rapidly.<br />
At a time Wht'en the Commonwealth has substantially reduced the<br />
number of Commonwealth employees. States and local government<br />
employment bas risen sharply.<br />
When the figures are adjusted for our employment creating schemes,<br />
in the year to November 1976, State and local government employees<br />
rose by. 3.3% This is a matter we shall be discussing -in someO<br />
detail at tha* Premiers Conference n~ ext week.<br />
We have also been active in the area of social reform, taking<br />
important steps to protect individual rights and liberties against<br />
the governent and other large organisations. </p>
<p>-6-4<br />
Last Thursd~ y Tony Street tabled. in Parliament another<br />
morst importan piece of legislation.* A bill to amend<br />
The Conciliation and Arbitration Act.: The Bill gives<br />
additional protection to the rights-of individuals, particularly<br />
employees and independent contractors. It establishes an<br />
Industrial Relations Bureau. An industrial ombudsm~ an, to<br />
secure observance of the Conilisation and Arbitration Act,<br />
and awards given by the Arbitration Commission.<br />
The object of these measures it to introduce, into industrial<br />
relations, the same principles Of ciVil liberties and equality<br />
before the law, that we all take. for granted in all other<br />
areas of activity. This policy-was.. endorsed overwhelmingly at<br />
the last election. The legislation has taken a long time tp'<br />
draft. And we wish to leave time., for the legislation to be fuLlly<br />
explained, . and understood, and we shall consider suggestions<br />
for amendment.<br />
But-anyone who suggests that the bill should be withdrawn because<br />
it upsets a section of-the trade-union leadership cannot havet<br />
thought through the full consequences of what they are saying.<br />
If the only industrial 1egislation that may be impleme nted<br />
is that acceptable to those few., but influential extremist lunio~ n<br />
leaders. People who are dedicated to the destruction of our<br />
system iof government. That says souething very disturbing<br />
about the way our society is heading. Trade unions are arrongst'h<br />
largest and most powerful organisation In this country. And it it<br />
tight that they should be strong. But the pernicious theory that<br />
unions should be the only organisations in our society which shouldl<br />
fall outside the rule of law is a direct blow at the very basis<br />
of our democratic systemr.<br />
Finally a word of the referendums The four proposals on whiLch<br />
you will vote on 21. say simultaneous election, replacement of<br />
Senate casual vacancies with Senators of the same political party,<br />
votes in referendums for Aust ralian in the ACT and Noxf Jern Terrtio<br />
retiring age for judges, are Al fair, and sensible measureSi.<br />
They do' not affect States' rights. And unlike most<br />
referendums they do not seek further power for the Coxmrmnwea: lth.<br />
I urge-all of you here, to lend your active support to the vote<br />
' yes' campaign-It am confident that with your help they wiLL. all<br />
be successful. </p>
