    <content><![CDATA[<p>My Chief of Staff Arthur Sinodinos will be resigning next week to take up a position with Goldman Sachs JBWere in Sydney.</p>
<p>Mr Tony Nutt, my Principal Private Secretary, will become my Chief of Staff.</p>
<p>Arthur Sinodinos has served in my office since March 1995 initially as Senior Economic Adviser, becoming Chief of Staff in October 1997.  He had also worked for me during an earlier period in Opposition in 1987-89.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Arthur for his outstanding service to me personally, and to the work of the Government generally, over this very lengthy period.  He has been a wonderful adviser in every way.  His policy advice, his political nous and his great interpersonal skills have all contributed in a substantial way to the smooth workings of both my office and the highest levels of government.</p>
<p>I will miss Arthur greatly.  I recognise, however, that the time has come for him to move on to another career opportunity.  Janette and I wish him, his wife Elizabeth and son Dion, every happiness and success in the future.</p>
<p>Tony Nutt has been my Principal Private Secretary since 1997.  He brings to the position of Chief of Staff a great wealth of experience both at the party organisational level and within Government.  He has been a Liberal Party Director in several states and Chief of Staff for a former Attorney-General.</p>
