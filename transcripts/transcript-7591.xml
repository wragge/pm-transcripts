PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 8 MAY 1989<br />
JOINT STATEMENT WITH THE MINISTER FOR SCIENCE, CUSTOMS AND<br />
SMALL BUSINESS, THE HON. BARRY JONES<br />
Since first coming to office the Government has recognised<br />
that realisation of our vision of Australia's future<br />
requires many fundamental changes to Australian attitudes<br />
and institutions. This need for change is no less evident<br />
in science and technology. The Government has pursued a<br />
consistent science and technology strategy aimed at<br />
achieving this change.<br />
This strategy recognises that crucial elements of research<br />
must be supported by public funds. It adopts as two<br />
important objectives the pursuit of excellence and the<br />
closer cooperation between researchers and users of that<br />
research. It recognises that science and technology depend<br />
on the creativity of individuals. And finally, it seeks to<br />
integrate science and technology into the broader community.<br />
In pursuit of that strategy, research into science and<br />
technology in Australia is supported by public funds<br />
totalling about $ 1.9 billion annually, through direct<br />
funding, through institutions of higher education and<br />
through tax concessions.<br />
Public funding of research and development in Australia is<br />
about the middle order of OECD nations. Private sector<br />
support has been near the bottom of the ladder. When this<br />
Government came to office, 80 per cent of the nation's<br />
research activities were publicly funded, with private<br />
industry providing the remaining 20 per cent.<br />
We have increased funding for research and development<br />
promotion and incentive schemes such as the 150 per cent tax<br />
concession for industry R&amp; D, the Grants for Industry<br />
Research and Development ( GIRD) scheme, medical research<br />
( NHMRC) and the Rural Industry Research Funds. We have also<br />
encouraged our research organisations to seek greater<br />
outside funding.<br />
Since 1982-83, Government support for research through<br />
grants, higher education and Government agencies has risen<br />
by 12 per cent in real terms, although the composition of<br />
this support has altered. Support for industry research and<br />
development has trebled. </p>
<p>By 1986-87, within a substantial increase in total R&amp; D<br />
expenditure, industry had increased its share in the<br />
nation's research effort to 35 per cent. This is a welcome<br />
trend. The best Australian research can now receive increased<br />
support, as researchers must now win a proportion of their<br />
funding by competing with others against a variety of<br />
standards, some involving peer review ( through the<br />
Australian Research Council) and others commercial criteria.<br />
There has already been a massive expansion of higher<br />
education places and there will be a further 49,000 places<br />
created during the 1989-91 triennium. We have also<br />
dramatically lifted school retention rates from 38 per cent<br />
in 1982 to 58 per cent last year.<br />
A number of reviews of science and technology policy is now<br />
complete: the Smith and Wilson Committees on higher<br />
education, the McKinnon Committee on marine science, the<br />
Primary Industries and Energy review of research and<br />
development in the portfolio, the Group of Officials on<br />
science and technology, and ASTEC's review of the core<br />
capacity of Australian science and technology.<br />
While these reviews demonstrate that the Government's basic<br />
approach remains valid, some opportunities for improvement<br />
have been identified.<br />
In responding, the Government will increase expenditure<br />
substantially on science and technology by $ 390 million over<br />
five years and also forgo significant revenue, as summarised<br />
in the following table ( See Table 1 and the Attachment for<br />
further details).<br />

Continuting the R&amp; D tax incentive is anticipated to cost<br />
approximately $ 600 million if the expected 1988-89<br />
experience with this incentive is repeated. </p>
<p>In recognition of the importance of having these issues<br />
brought regularly before Government, we are today announcing<br />
the formation of the Prime Minister's Science Council. The<br />
Prime Minister will chair the Council with the Minister for<br />
Science, Customs and Small Business, who now also becomes<br />
Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Science and<br />
Technology, as deputy chair. A new position of Chief<br />
Scientist to advise the Prime Minister and Minister<br />
Assisting and act as Executive Officer of the Council will<br />
be created. The Chief Scientist will chair the officials<br />
level Co-ordination Committee on Science and Technology with<br />
the Chief Science Adviser in the Industry, Technology and<br />
Commerce portfolio as deputy chair.<br />
Science and technology will have a central role to play in<br />
the nation's future, as it has in its past. It will<br />
continue to influence crucially our economic performance,<br />
health, environment, defence, human values and culture. In<br />
this statement, the Government has made a commitment to<br />
improving Australia's scientific and technological base.<br />
Successful implementation of these strategies will need an<br />
equally vigorous commitment by researchers, research<br />
institutions, higher education and industry. </p>
<p>ATTACHMENT<br />
SUMMARY OF MEASURES<br />
CO-ORDINATION<br />
A major new national forum for consideration of science and<br />
technology issues will be created through the formation of<br />
the Prime Minister's Science Council. The Council will be<br />
chaired by the Prime Minister, will include other senior<br />
Ministers with strong portfolio interests in science and<br />
technology, representatives from the scientific community<br />
and leading executives from industry.<br />
Others with a particular interest in or ability to<br />
contribute to issues before the Council will be co-opted for<br />
those items. The Council will meet at least twice a year to<br />
consider issues of national significance in science and<br />
technology.<br />
SIn science and technology matters in general and in the<br />
business of the Council in particular, the Prime Minister<br />
will in future be assisted by the Minister for Science,<br />
Customs and Small Business who also becomes the Minister<br />
Assisting the Prime Minister for Science and Technology.<br />
The Minister Assisting will be deputy chair of the Council.<br />
A new position of Chief Scientist will be created within the<br />
Prime Minister's portfolio to provide advice to the Prime<br />
Minister and the Minister Assisting on Science and<br />
Technology. The Chief Scientist will serve on the Prime<br />
Minister's Council and act as its Executive Officer,<br />
responsible for co-ordinating the business of the Council.<br />
At the officials level and complementing the work of the<br />
Prime Minister's Council, the Co-ordination Committee on<br />
Science and Technology will be chaired by the Chief<br />
Scientist with the Chief Science Adviser in the Industry,<br />
Technology and Commerce portfolio as deputy chair. This<br />
Committee will bring together senior officers from all<br />
departments with an interest in science and technology to<br />
share information about their programs and policies,<br />
problems and opportunities.<br />
THE 150 PER CENT TAX INCENTIVE FOR R&amp; D<br />
This will be extended for a further two years, to 30 June<br />
1993. Recognising the long term planning necessary in R&amp; D,<br />
the incentive will be phased out, operating at 125 per cent<br />
for a further two years. To give an indication of the gross<br />
-cost to company tax rquenue, this incentive is expected to<br />
cost about $ 200 million in 1988-89. </p>
<p>CSIRO, ANSTO, AIMS<br />
In March 1989, the Government boosted CSIRO's base funding<br />
by $ 2.1 million, $ 6.6 million and $ 11.6 million in 1988-89,<br />
1989-90 and 1990-91 respectively. As a further commitment<br />
to enhancing the strength of the public research sector, the<br />
Government began a program in March 1989 to update obsolete<br />
equipment in Government research organisations, with<br />
million for CSIRQ in 1988-89. The Government has now<br />
decided to allocate further funds for equipment and priority<br />
projects, amounting to $ 90 million over the next five years.<br />
The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation<br />
( ANSTO) is Australia's major centre of expertise in nuclear<br />
science and associated technologies. As part of the March<br />
1989 decision to allocate additional funds for equipment in<br />
Government laboratories, ANSTO received $ 0.5 million towards<br />
the cost of a tandem accelerator. The Government has now<br />
decided to allocate a further $ 2.5 million over the next<br />
five years for new equipment.<br />
The Australian Institute of Marine Science ( AIMS) conducts<br />
research in Australia's tropical coastal and continental<br />
shelf regions. In March of this year, the Government<br />
allocated an additional $ 1.1 million to AIMS for equipment<br />
purchased in 1988-89. The Government will now provide a<br />
further $ 2.5 million for equipment and new research over the<br />
next five years.<br />
A recent review of Australia's marine industries and marine<br />
science and technology capabilities has identified<br />
Australia's achievements, strengths and commercial<br />
advantages. The Government accepts the Report's principal<br />
recommendation that policies should be prepared and<br />
implemented to develop further our marine resources and<br />
associated industries. It also believes that industry<br />
development should be targeted to areas in which Australia<br />
has particular opportunity and where industry is a willing<br />
partner. The heads of the Government's marine science and technology<br />
agencies will be asked to work with the Department of<br />
Industry, Technology and Commerce to examine areas of<br />
potential industry development, to bring marine R&amp; D more<br />
closely into line with industry requirements and to play a<br />
key role in international co-operation in marine science and<br />
technology. The Government has decided to provide an extra<br />
$ 3.9 million for these activities over the next five years. </p>
<p>PUBLIC AWARENESS<br />
The Government has decided to support initiatives which<br />
enhance awareness of science and technology. It will create<br />
the Australia Prize, worth $ 250,000 tax-free annually. This<br />
prize will be an award for scientific excellence in<br />
promoting the welfare of the peoples of the world. The<br />
Government will also establish an Industry-Science<br />
Foundation to create a mechanism which will alert business<br />
leaders to opportunities for long term patient capital<br />
investments in research-based products-and services.<br />
RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION<br />
A total of $ 977.9 million will be allocated through the ARC<br />
over the next five years from and including 1990, an<br />
increase of $ 466.4 million over 1989 funding levels. This<br />
will be achieved by a major injection of new funds and by<br />
continuing the transfer of funds from institutional<br />
operating grants to the ARC. New funds will total $ 254.4<br />
0 million over the next five calendar years with $ 56.9 million<br />
going to increase support for postgraduate research students<br />
and the remaining $ 197.5 million to develop the capacity of<br />
higher education institutions to support high quality<br />
research.<br />
The funds will be allocated on advice from the ARC, in<br />
consultation with the Higher Education Council ( HEC).<br />
To allow better forward planning the Government will<br />
introduce full triennial funding for the ARC in line with<br />
funding arrangements for higher education institutions.<br />
RESEARCH TRAINING<br />
The Government will provide additional funds of<br />
$ 56.9 million over the next five calendar years to upgrade<br />
dramatically the Commonwealth Postgraduate Awards Scheme.<br />
In 1990 the Government will make available $ 31.8 million<br />
sufficient to provide for 1450 continuing research<br />
0 scholarships and 900 new research scholarships. From 1990<br />
all Commonwealth Postgraduate Research Awards will be<br />
provided tax-free at a minimum of $ 12,734, equivalent to a<br />
taxable level of $ 15., 000, compared to the current level of<br />
$ 10,415. Institutions will have the flexibility to set<br />
stipends above this level up to $ 16,433 ( equal to $ 20,000<br />
taxed) according to their own research priorities and local<br />
needs. In addition, 30 new industry research scholarships will be<br />
available each year t--i.-ink -directly with industry. They<br />
will assist in opening up joint industry higher education<br />
research training opportunities, and so lead to closer<br />
interaction between the two sectors. It is intended that by<br />
1992 there will be a pool of about 80 or 90 of these awards. </p>
<p>HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH<br />
The Government will further strengthen Australia's health<br />
and medical research workforce by attracting and retaining<br />
bright young researchers through a program of priming grants<br />
to assist the transition from understudy to fully-fledged<br />
independent scientist. A senior medical research<br />
fellowships and awards program will help attract to<br />
Australia eminent medical researchers in high priority<br />
areas. In addition, the postgraduate research awards<br />
granted by the NHMRC will be increased-in number and value<br />
at a cost of $ 5.7 million over five years.<br />
In seeking to maintain Australia's strong international<br />
record in medical research, the Government will also provide<br />
the NHMRC with an additional $ 39.8 million to upgrade and<br />
replace obsolete biomedical equipment. The NHMRC will now<br />
also allocate a proportion of the funds which have been<br />
transferred from higher education operating grants to the<br />
ARC. The total increase in funding for medical research through<br />
the NHMRC over the five year period to 1993-94 is<br />
$ 45.5 million. This represents a real increase of 18.7 per<br />
cent over the period.<br />
PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY<br />
The Government has recognised the need for a more integrated<br />
approach to research policy across primary and energy<br />
industries. Today, the minister for Primary Industries and<br />
Energy, Mr John Kerin, and the Minister for Resources,<br />
Senator Peter Cook are releasing a statement, Research,<br />
Innovation and Competitiveness, which deals with primary<br />
industries and energy research and development arrangements,<br />
and how they can be made more efficient and effective and<br />
continue to produce results that are relevant to industry<br />
needs. The changes fall into several areas: funding,<br />
co-ordination and evaluation of research efforts.<br />
Initiatives will cost*$ 3.5 million over five years.<br />
ENVIRONMENT The Government has already announced support for a national<br />
Greenhouse research program so we can better understand and<br />
respond to climate change. It will provide $ 7.8 million<br />
during 1988-89 and 1989-90 for research and policy support<br />
including: research by CSIR@ sand-the -Bureau of Meteorology on<br />
climatic modelling;<br />
support for the World Climate Impact Studies Program of<br />
the United Nations Environment Program; and<br />
funds for the Academy of Science to participate in the<br />
international Geosphere Biosphere Program. </p>
<p>8.<br />
A National Greenhouse Advisory Committee, comprising eminent<br />
Australian scientists, will be established to advise the<br />
Government on Greenhouse research issues, including details<br />
of a Greenhouse research grant scheme to begin in 1990-91.<br />
INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION<br />
The Government believes that Australian researchers should<br />
be able to participate as a full partner in international<br />
precompetitive R&amp; D programs where the collaboration can help<br />
Australian technology enter world markets. The Government<br />
has therefore decided to increase funding for international<br />
science and technology by $ 17.5 million over the next five<br />
years, including additional support for Bilateral Science<br />
and Technology Co-operation programs. </p>
