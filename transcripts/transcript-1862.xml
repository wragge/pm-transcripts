EMBARGO_ NOT FOR RELEASE BEFORE 6AM FRIDAY 31 MAY<br />
FOR PRESS PM. No. 603/ 1968<br />
AWARD OF UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL UNIT<br />
CITATION<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister, Mr J( chn McEwen.<br />
The Acting Prime Minister announced this morning that the<br />
United States Presidential Unit Citation has been awarded to Company,<br />
6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, by the President of the United<br />
States. President Johnson presented the Citation to the Prime Minister<br />
( Mr Gorton) at the President's Ranch in Texas on Thursday.<br />
The Citation which is the highest United States award that<br />
can be given to a military unit, has been conferred on Company for<br />
extraordinary heroism in the action fought at Long Tan on 18 August, 1966,<br />
During the battle, I'D" Company was attacked on all sides by<br />
an enemy force of regimental, size, supported by accurate and intense<br />
mortar and recoil-less rifle fire. The leading platoon of the Company was<br />
cut off. Numerous enemy attacks were halted and later the Company with<br />
the support of artillery batteries and a squadron of armoured cavalry<br />
forced the enemy to withdraw leaving behind 245 dead.<br />
Australian casualties were 18 dead and 25 wounded.<br />
This is only the second occasion on which this high American<br />
honour has been conferred on an Australian Unit; the first being to the<br />
3rd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment for outstanding gallantry at<br />
Kapyong, South Korea on 24-25 April 1951.<br />
The Acting Prime Minister said:<br />
III congratulate the Officer Commanding and all members of<br />
Company. W*% e are proud of them. The Citation adds fresh<br />
lustre to Australia's military tradition."<br />
The citation reads:<br />
" By virtue of the authority vested in me as Presdent of the<br />
United States and as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of<br />
the United States, I have today awarded the Presidential Unit<br />
Citation ( Army) for extriaordinary heroism to Company Sixth<br />
Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment, the Australian Army.<br />
Company, Sixth Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, distinguished<br />
itself by extraordinary heroism while engaged in military operations<br />
against an opposing armed force in Viet Nam on 18 August 1966.<br />
While searching for Viet Cong in a rubber plantation northeast of<br />
Ba Ria, Phuoc Tuy Province, Republic of Viet Nam, Company<br />
n-iet and immediately became engaged in heavy contact. As the<br />
battle developed, it became apparent that the men of Company<br />
were facing a numerically superi or force. The platoons of I'D"<br />
Company were surrounded and attacked on all sides by an estimated 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
reinforced enemy battalion using automatic weapons, small<br />
arms and mortars. Fighting courageously against a well-armed<br />
and determined foe, the men of Company maintained their<br />
formations in a common perimeter defence and inflicted heavy<br />
casualties upon the Viet Cong. The enemy maintained a<br />
continuous, intense volume of fire and attacked repeatedly from<br />
all directions. Each successive assault was repulsed by the<br />
courageous Australians. Heavy rainfall and a low ceiling<br />
prevented any friendly close air support during the battle.<br />
After three hours of savage attacks, having failed to penetrate<br />
the Australian lines, the enemy withdrew from the battlefield<br />
carrying many dead and wounded, and leaving 245 Viet Cong<br />
dead forward of the defence position of Company. The<br />
conspicuous gallantry, intrepidity and indomitable courage of<br />
1D" Company were in the highest tradition of military valour<br />
and reflect great credit upon Company, Sixth Battalion, the<br />
Royal Australian Regiment and the Australian Army.<br />
A number of British awards for gallantry in the Long<br />
Tan action have already been aninounced. Members of Company won<br />
a Military Cross, a Distinguished Conduct Medal and three Military<br />
Medals. Four members were Mentioned-in-Despatches.<br />
