FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 101/ 1968<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S CHRISTMAS MESSAGE TO FORCES<br />
The Prime Minister has sent the following message to<br />
members of the Australian forces serving In Australia and overseas:-<br />
" On behalf of the people of Australia, I<br />
send to all Australian servicemen and women my best<br />
wishes for Christmas and the New Year.<br />
Wherever you may be serving, each one<br />
of you is making a contribution to the security of Australia<br />
and to the stability of our part of the world.<br />
In particular, our thoughts are with those<br />
of you whose duties will prevent you spending Christmas<br />
with your families. At no time in our history, outside<br />
the period of the Great World Wars, have we had so many<br />
Australians serving overseas. Some of you are in the<br />
front lines, facing danger, hardship and discomfort.<br />
Others are on active service in areas where your presence<br />
helps protect the peace of friendly nations.<br />
But at home or abroad, you are all serving<br />
Australia well, and are doing a job of which you can be<br />
proud. It is a pride shared by your families and by the<br />
nation. In these challenging days of change on the<br />
international scene, our Defence Forces are playing<br />
and will continue to play a vital role for Australia's<br />
well-being. Thank you. Good luck and Happy Christmas<br />
to you all."<br />
CANBERRA 23 December 1968 </p>
