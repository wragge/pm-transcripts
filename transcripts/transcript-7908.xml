FOR MEDIA 16 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
In accordance with normal procedure I release the text of<br />
the letter I wrote to the Governor-General advising a<br />
dissolution of the House of Representatives with a view<br />
to a House of Representatives and half Senate election on<br />
24 March 1990 and the text of the Governor-General's<br />
reply. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER CANBERRA<br />
16 F EB 1990<br />
His Excellency the Honourable Bill Hayden, AC<br />
Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia<br />
Government House<br />
CANBERRA ACT 2600<br />
Your Excellency<br />
I write to advise you to dissolve the House of Representatives<br />
and take the necessary action for a half Senate election in<br />
time for the elections for both Houses to be held on 24 March<br />
1990.<br />
While the term of the current House of Representatives does not<br />
expire until 14 September 1990, it is necessary to bring the<br />
election for the House forward to coincide with the half Senate<br />
election which must be held in time for the new senators to<br />
take their places on 1 July 1990. Holding the two elections on<br />
the same day will spare the Australian community the additional<br />
expense and disruption which would result from having two<br />
separate national elections so close together.<br />
The details of the election timetable I propose are:<br />
Dissolution Issue of writs<br />
Close of electoral rolls<br />
Close of nominations<br />
Polling day<br />
Return of writs<br />
( latest date) 19 February 1990<br />
19 February 1990<br />
26 February 1990<br />
2 March 1990<br />
24 March 1990<br />
30 may 1990<br />
Under section 12 of the Constitution, the Governors of the<br />
States issue writs for the election of senators for the States.<br />
Accordingly, I invite you to propose to the Governor of each<br />
State that the dates proposed above be adopted for the purpose<br />
of the electi~ on of the State senators. </p>
<p>Parliament has appropriated sufficient funds to enable the work<br />
of the administration to be carried on through the election<br />
period. The Appropriation Bills granting supply for 1989-90<br />
were passed last year. The timetable I propose above provides<br />
sufficient time for a new Parliament to be assembled to pass<br />
legislation for additional estimates for 1989-90 and Supply<br />
Bills for 1990-91.<br />
Attached for your approval and signature is a Proclamation<br />
which will dissolve the House of Representatives at 4. O0pm on<br />
Monday 19 February 1990 and discharge senators from attendance<br />
as from that time until the commencement of the next session of<br />
the Parliament. Consistent with previous practice, I would<br />
have it in mind that you retain the Proclamation for signature<br />
on Monday, following the pre-dissolution Executive Council<br />
meeting. I intend to make a statement later today announcing the<br />
election, subject to your agreement with what I have proposed.<br />
I should appreciate your confirmation that you have no<br />
objection to public release of this letter and your reply at an<br />
appropriate time.<br />
Yours sincerely<br />
R. J. L. Hawke </p>

J 16 February 1990<br />
My dear Prime Minister,<br />
When you called on me this morning you handed me<br />
your letter of today's date advising me to dissolve the House<br />
of Representatives and to take the necessary action for a half<br />
Senate election to enable the elections for both Houses to be<br />
held on 24 March 1990.<br />
I write to confirm my oral acceptance of that<br />
advice, and your reasons for it. I shall today invite State<br />
Governors to take the necessary action for the holding of<br />
Senate elections and, on Monday, 19 February 1990 I shall, in<br />
accordance with your recommendation, issue a proclamation<br />
dissolving the House of Representatives at 4.00 p. m. on that<br />
day and discharging Senators from attendance until<br />
commencement of the next session of the Parliament.<br />
I have noted your assurances that Parliament has<br />
appropriated sufficient funds to enable the work of the<br />
administration to be carried on through the election period.<br />
I have no objection to the public release of your<br />
letter and this reply at an appropriate time.<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
The Honourable R. J. L. Hawke, AC, MP,<br />
