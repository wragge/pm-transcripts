PRIME MINVISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
NSW LABOR PARTY STATE CONFERENCE<br />
SYDNEY TOWN HALL, SYDNEY<br />
13 JUNE 1993<br />
We have won an inspired victory. One of the really great<br />
victories of our history.<br />
And the credit goes to the party and the movement.<br />
Especially to you, the New -South Wales Branch.<br />
Anyone who has not comprehended the dimensions of it<br />
think of this:<br />
Ten years ago the Social Democratic parties dominated the<br />
political landscape of Europe.<br />
They governed in Sweden, Austria, France, the<br />
Netherlands, Greece and half a dozen other places.<br />
Today, with the exception of Spain, there are no Social<br />
Democratic parties governing in the European Community.<br />
There are none governing in their own right.<br />
But in Australia Labor governs.<br />
None of us should underestimate the stature of Labor's<br />
achievement. In the eighties the pressure on parties like our own has<br />
been immense.<br />
The necessity to confront new realities and yet keep<br />
faith with traditional principles of social justice was<br />
more than the Labor and Social Democratic parties of the<br />
world could manage.<br />
If they did not confront the new realities they were<br />
overtaken by conservatives freshly charged with free<br />
market zealotry.<br />
If they confronted the realities but abandoned their<br />
principles they lost their integrity, their traditional<br />
supporters and, sooner or later, elections.<br />
But we survived. </p>
<p>We did better than survive.<br />
And we did it because we recognised that, just as it was<br />
essential to internationalise the economy and make<br />
Australia more competitive, it was essential that we<br />
maintain the safety net and develop new and effective<br />
social policies.<br />
In fact, all the more essential.<br />
Because the human consequences of the structural changes<br />
made it imperative to maintain such essential supports as<br />
a universal health system, a system of family allowan * ces<br />
and other income supplements, social security benefits,<br />
education, training and re-training, guaranteed minimum<br />
rates of pay.<br />
All those things which our opponents, in the interests of<br />
imitating the social chaos and hardship of Thatcher's<br />
Britain and Reagan's America, were determined to remove.<br />
If in the next few years doubts arise in the hearts and<br />
minds of Labor's people, be sure of this: on 13 March<br />
this year more than the Labor Government was saved.<br />
Australia was saved progressive, egalitarian Australia,<br />
that is.<br />
The Australia of the fair-go was saved.<br />
The idea that Australia should be always in the front<br />
rank of the world's advanced societies was saved.<br />
Our success has been no accident.<br />
We are still governing because we were prepared to make<br />
the agenda for change our own.<br />
We made it our mission.<br />
We did not just react.<br />
We didn't come along behind trying to flog old policies<br />
for new and bickering over the rent we took the<br />
initiative. We took charge of the fundamentals.<br />
We led.<br />
And it was only by doing this that we were able to keep<br />
faith with the principles of Labor and Labor's people.<br />
And, we must continue to do it in the next three years.<br />
As I said in this same forum last year, the Labor Party<br />
is a bit like a bicycle if you stop pedalling, it falls<br />
over. We have been pedalling for a decade. </p>
<p>We will continue to pedal into the nineties; and we will<br />
continue to undertake those great national projects and<br />
reforms which give Australia not just its strength and<br />
cohesion, but its identity and confidence.<br />
Reform never ends.<br />
In fact if Labor ever stops reforming, Labor's power will<br />
end. But if we are going to keep up the momentum of<br />
reform we are also going to have to look at ourselves.<br />
We are going to have to reform the Party.<br />
We did this in the late seventies and into the eighties.<br />
We did it to make the Party flexible enough to cope with<br />
the challenges, strong enough to be politically<br />
effective. Today we should start the process of reinvigorating the<br />
ALP once more.<br />
We need to broaden the base of our membership; we need to<br />
open our forums to more ideas; we need to make sure we<br />
select the best candidates.<br />
We need reforms which will reinforce the national nature<br />
of the Party.<br />
I've asked the National Secretary to start the<br />
Organisational Review process.<br />
I've asked him to get discussion, debate and agreement on<br />
the future structure of the Party.<br />
I've done it because on our strength, our ideas, our<br />
remaining in office, depends the momentum of the nation's<br />
progress as a fair, prosperous and enlightened community.<br />
But we also need more than reorganisation, we need to<br />
rethink our responses to new realities.<br />
How will we meet the challenge of an increasingly<br />
internationalised economy?<br />
What system of industrial relations will deliver the<br />
flexibility we need to compete in the world while<br />
preserving and improving our wages and living standards?<br />
How will we meet the greatest challenge of all how will<br />
we get back to full employment?<br />
Our opponents swing in ten year cycles between torpor and<br />
aggression. </p>
<p>Between doing nothing and beating the hell out of<br />
ordinary people; between letting the social fabric slowly<br />
fray at the edges and ripping it to shreds.<br />
Just now they're in limbo.<br />
They are waiting to be called.<br />
They are not sure which way to go, so to give the<br />
impression that they are thoughtful and busy, they are<br />
playing the role of spoilers.<br />
I won't spend much time on our opponents today, but let<br />
me say this about them.<br />
The one big thing about Australian conservatives is their<br />
supposed belief in the-rule of law.<br />
They have always preened themselves about that.<br />
And, no doubt, if the High Court had decided that<br />
terra nullius had in fact existed and native title in<br />
fact did not; and that there had been no act of<br />
dispossession to speak of, or injustice or brutality or<br />
prejudice; and really it had all been pretty well the<br />
Aborigines' own fault, the conservatives would have<br />
extolled the virtue of the Court and waxed lyrical about<br />
its wisdom.<br />
But because the High Court decided otherwise: because the<br />
High Court decided that this country had been occupied,<br />
and that the indigenous people had been dispossessed and<br />
still suffer the effects of this; and that native title<br />
does exist and is a means to a just resolution of an<br />
historic injustice: because this was the High Court's<br />
decision, the conservatives have made a small adjustment<br />
to their opinion of the rule of law.<br />
With one or two very honourable exceptions, at best they<br />
have accepted it grudgingly, and at worst not at all.<br />
The conservative view is how dare the High Court<br />
recognise the unquestionable truth that Australia was<br />
occupied in 1788?<br />
How dare it say that native title survived the<br />
acquisition of sovereignty at settlement?<br />
And how dare the rest of us try to find the mechanisms<br />
which will give national expression and fulfilment to a<br />
decision of the Court?<br />
This is spoiling on a grand scale.<br />
This is national spoiling.<br />
But Labor will not give up on this. </p>
<p>We must not.<br />
The Mabo judgment does provide the best chance yet of<br />
finding an enduring and just basis for reconciliation<br />
between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians.<br />
It is the classic evener up.<br />
And finding the way to reconciliation must be one of<br />
Labor' s ambitions.<br />
I am certain it must be one of Australia's ambitions.<br />
I believe this because the history and contemporary<br />
reality of Aboriginal Australia is a blight on our<br />
reputation, our traditions of fairness, social justice<br />
and inclusion, and our self-esteem.<br />
It is, therefore, a true Labor cause, and I call on the<br />
entire Labor movement in Australia to get behind it.<br />
But we have to avoid the extremes.<br />
This is not about ensuring the success of Aboriginal land<br />
claims over people's backyards or farms. Nor is it about<br />
enisuring that development can go ahead ignoring native<br />
title. In this as in other things we will get the<br />
balance right.<br />
We must give Aboriginal Australians justice but we have<br />
to do it in a way that keeps the country cohesive.<br />
In this as in every other national issue, we will best<br />
counter our opponents by continuing to do what we do best<br />
making the changes which have to be made, projecting<br />
and defining the vision, and keeping faithful to those<br />
social democratic ideals which is our reason for being.<br />
So what are the challenges facing us in 1993?<br />
To steer a course through these very difficult economic<br />
times towards renewed prosperity.<br />
To maintain and improve our standard of living and extend<br />
opportunity. To define and enlarge Australia's role in the world and<br />
our country's sense of national purpose and vision.<br />
And, above all, to be the country which finds the<br />
solutions to unemployment.<br />
We should be under no illusions it will not be easy.<br />
We are necessarily subject to forces beyond our control.<br />
Working against us are international factors over which<br />
we have little scope for influence. </p>
<p>But in the long haul, worse than anything that might be<br />
done to us, is what we might to do to ourselves.<br />
That is why I talk about a national effort.<br />
Having gone through a decade of structural change, having<br />
made sacrifices to ensure the changes work, and having<br />
seen sure indications that they are working, the worst<br />
thing that could happen to us now would be to succumb to<br />
the instincts of parochialism.<br />
The worst thing would be to trade Australia's future for<br />
petty self-interest.<br />
We really do have very considerable advantages.<br />
We proved in the last decade that we are a people who can<br />
make changes.<br />
And, reflecting this capacity, we now have in large part<br />
both the necessary cultural outlook and the mechanisms<br />
and institutions.<br />
Today Australia has an unquestionable ability to be<br />
flexible and adaptive.<br />
It does no harm for any Australian to remember that for<br />
all our problems, the great majority of other comparable<br />
countries have more of them and bigger ones.<br />
I think we have reached a crucial point in our progress.<br />
We've come so far: we've done many of the things which<br />
other countries have yet to do; and, among those who have<br />
done them, few have managed to do less damage to the<br />
social fabric in the process.<br />
This has meant that we have come out of the eighties<br />
essentially stronger and more cohesive.<br />
In many of the fundamentals we are ahead of the pack.<br />
Unlike many other countries, we do not have to re-build<br />
the social net only improve upon it.<br />
We don't have to re-educate a generation in social<br />
responsibility only lead by example.<br />
But for the same reasons of social responsibility, we do<br />
need to turn this present slow recovery into sustained<br />
growth and jobs.<br />
I believe that will only come when Australian business<br />
unequivocally throws in its lot. </p>
<p>It is business which will determine whether we make it in<br />
this decade or not particularly small and medium sized<br />
businesses, " clever" manufacturing businesses, exporting<br />
businesses. This is their era. As The Economist magazine wrote<br />
recently, the days of the corporate giants are passing:<br />
In a broad range of industries, powerful forces are<br />
moving against the big companies. New technology<br />
has spread around the world, trade barriers have<br />
come down, financial markets have been deregulated<br />
and consumer tastes have converged across borders.<br />
All these changes. . have granted business<br />
opportunities to thousands of small and medium-sized<br />
companies.<br />
That is why the changes we have made in the last decade<br />
are such good news now.<br />
It is why the statement of February this year, Investing<br />
in the Nation, aimed at small and medium business.<br />
It is where the future is going to be.<br />
It is where the jobs are going to be.<br />
But we must remember these small to medium-sized<br />
companies generally run lean workforces.<br />
That means, quite simply, to create the employment we<br />
need, we need a lot of companies. A lot of activity. A<br />
lot of innovation.<br />
And we need a trained workforce.<br />
I will not yet again run through what the Labor<br />
Government has done in the last decade to clear the way<br />
for business.<br />
There are still obstacles.<br />
There are still things we can do.<br />
But already the way is well and truly open for business<br />
in this decade.<br />
To invest. To manufacture. To export.<br />
And don't let anyone tell you that there is some kind of<br />
sacrifice involved in investing in Australia.<br />
To use the words of McKinsey and Company in their report<br />
on emerging exporters, the opportunities are " fantastic". </p>
<p>8<br />
And to help business seize them, there is low inflation,<br />
a highly competitive company tax regime, a new more<br />
generous depreciation allowance, a 150 per cent research<br />
and development allowance, a vastly improved and<br />
improving education and training system, and an<br />
industrial relations culture more flexible than ever<br />
before and delivering the lowest rates of disputation in<br />
thirty years.<br />
The McKinsey and Company report contains some<br />
fundamentally good news. -The changes made in the last<br />
decade have created highly successful export companies.<br />
The structural changes have been partly responsible, and<br />
so have the various forms of assistance the Government<br />
has provided.<br />
While finding 700 dynamic companies has to be good news,<br />
the real story lies in the 90 per cent of Australian<br />
manufacturers who are not exporting.<br />
The challenge is to get more of them into the<br />
international market, and to generate new internationally<br />
competitive firms.<br />
That's a challenge for all of us: government at all<br />
levels, employers, banks especially banks and the<br />
workforce, because to succeed in the modern world, the<br />
quality of the workforce and the quality of its<br />
relationship with the company is vital.<br />
So I say again a national effort will be needed.<br />
There is a collective responsibility to seize these<br />
opportunities, if only because on seizing them depends<br />
our chances of getting back to full employment.<br />
A couple of weeks ago I delivered a statement on<br />
unemployment and in it announced the creation of a high<br />
level committee to assess current policy and consider<br />
alternative approaches.<br />
By the end of this year the committee will deliver a<br />
discussion paper and in the first half of next year, the<br />
Government will release a White Paper on Employment and<br />
Unemployment, the first major study of the subject since<br />
1945. As we all know, because it so seriously damages<br />
individuals and families and has the potential to cause<br />
long-lasting social damage, unemployment must be our<br />
first priority.<br />
In announcing the formation of the committee I suggested<br />
that we needed to ask a few questions. Questions like<br />
are we committed to full employment? </p>
<p>It was a rhetorical question. It seems to me that to say<br />
that we are not committed to full employment would be to<br />
say that we are not committed to Australia.<br />
Of course we are committed to full employment, but we<br />
have to do more than say so.<br />
If we are committed to full employment, it might follow<br />
that we are prepared to put self-interest and short term<br />
gain aside.<br />
That we might as a community change the set of our minds.<br />
That companies might seek ways to employ rather than<br />
disemploy. That unions might make every effort to see that labour<br />
market programs which will give the unemployed a chance<br />
in life are allowed to work.<br />
That local governments might change the way they tend to<br />
think and as far as possible reduce the obstacles in the<br />
way of business.<br />
In other words, if we are committed to full employment,<br />
how are we going to demonstrate it?<br />
By railing against government policies? But other<br />
countries with different governments and different<br />
policies have the same levels of unemployment.<br />
By blaming the technology which is replacing workers, or<br />
the new lean small companies emerging in the modern<br />
economy? But that is an international phenomenon.<br />
By finding scapegoats?<br />
Of course, the policies should be up for scrutiny, and<br />
governments are ultimately responsible. And technology<br />
and the new shape of companies is a factor in job<br />
shedding but does anyone think the Luddites were right.<br />
But, again, the solution lies much less in what is done<br />
to us than in what we do for ourselves.<br />
Employers who decide to look for ways to employ might<br />
come to the conclusion, as I know some have, that there<br />
will be an advantage to those whose workforce is trained<br />
and experienced when the recovery gathers pace.<br />
And trade unions, I think, should do what they can to<br />
make sure that those in need of training and experience<br />
are not denied them.<br />
And all of us if we think about it might come to the<br />
conclusion that an effort now will save us a great deal<br />
in the future in both budgetary and social terms. </p>
<p>So a national effort demands an attitudinal change I<br />
would even go so far as to say we should re-define the<br />
way we think about Australia.<br />
I believe it should be one of our fundamental aims in the<br />
next couple of years to build among Australians a more<br />
general sense of identification with national<br />
aspirations. I mean this in a context which is broader than, say, our<br />
republican hopes, or reconciliation with Aboriginal and<br />
Torres Strait Islanders.<br />
I mean a broader consensus on our social democratic<br />
agenda, on the necessity to develop an inclusive society<br />
not just because it is fairer but because it is also<br />
stronger. And not just a broader consensus, but a greater sense of<br />
pride in our social goals and achievements. The sort of<br />
pride we ought to take in, for example, our achievements<br />
in raising the status, security and life opportunities<br />
for Australian women.<br />
I also mean a broader consensus on the huge opportunities<br />
which await us in Asia and the Pacific, and what it will<br />
take to be successful there. Not just a broader<br />
consensus, but a sense of common purpose.<br />
And I mean a broader consensus on the necessity to work<br />
nationally, to make the nation work.<br />
That, of course, was at the heart of One Nation. The<br />
port developments, the rail highway, the roads, the new<br />
airline system and the electricity grid are essential to<br />
allow Australia to reach its full potential.<br />
But it must also be understood that they will allow<br />
regions to reach their full potential.<br />
Regional development is a matter of high priority.<br />
The process of structural adjustment has had geographic<br />
dimensions which we cannot ignore. The dimensions are<br />
unemployment, hardship and disaffection.<br />
It is reasonable to assume that the search for ways to<br />
correct the imbalance will also deliver ways to stimulate<br />
new energy and economic activity throughout Australia.<br />
Last month the Minister, Alan Griffiths, announced the<br />
establishment of a new Office of Regional Development.<br />
Very soon we will be announcing the appointment of an<br />
expert Task Force on regional development and I am<br />
hoping that Bill Kelty will agree to head it up. </p>
<p>There is a lot to be gained from success in this: the<br />
stimulation of industry and employment in regional<br />
Australia; the maximum use of our natural and human<br />
resources; the opportunity to see those small and medium<br />
sized businesses proliferate because very often regional<br />
industries have that specialised character which sells<br />
abroad; and the resuscitation of communities which are<br />
presently in danger of drifting to decay.<br />
Regional Development means national development on a<br />
regional basis. It means not parochialism but<br />
partnership. It means pulling the regions of Australia<br />
into the national grid.<br />
It will require a spirit of collective responsibility<br />
between communities, business and trade unions and<br />
between the three tiers of government.<br />
I think it is fair to say that in each case the proper<br />
starting point will be to ask not what can the<br />
Commonwealth Government do for a region, but what can a<br />
region do for itself.<br />
The role of the Commonwealth will be not to deliver money<br />
by the drayload but to assist the regions to take<br />
advantage of their potential.<br />
For local government, especially, it is a chance to play<br />
a more creative role in the life of the community and the<br />
nation. We have been through some very rocky times together in<br />
the last eighteen months. I suppose there is nothing new<br />
in that but there is something to be learned from it.<br />
And I think it is this: we are a pragmatic party and we<br />
know that change is difficult and usually incremental<br />
rather than thunderous and rapid. We know we must be<br />
nimble-footed sometimes and at other times absolutely<br />
immovable. We are both the mountain goat and the<br />
mammoth. The election should remind us that we must never let our<br />
inspiration waver or put our beliefs in our back pocket.<br />
Our inspiration is our ultimate weapon simply because it<br />
is always greater than theirs.<br />
As we translate our inspiration into government and<br />
policy, you can be sure we will remember this.<br />
Because a Labor government without courage and conviction<br />
is not a real Labor government.<br />
So we can't fall back.<br />
We have to keep the shoulder to the door: With social<br />
policy, industry policy, structural change. </p>
<p>12<br />
With enlarging our national purpose and our place in the<br />
world. We have to speak for our generation and in doing so<br />
create an Australia that will excite the involvement and<br />
affection of the next generation.<br />
There won't be any backing off. We'll listen, we'll take<br />
notes, we'll accommodate, we'll diverge where necessary.<br />
But our eyes will stay fixed on national goals.<br />
And at the end of this next three years we will be much<br />
closer to those goals and much further ahead of the<br />
people who want to hold Australia back. </p>
