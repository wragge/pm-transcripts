TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SBS DATELINE WITH PAUL MURPHY<br />
26 FEBRUARY 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: You are asking Australians to take you on trust aren't;<br />
you that your projections tonight, in this document,<br />
are goiLng to be right?<br />
PM: Well Paul, the economies generally respond quite<br />
favourably and rapidly on the way out of the recession.<br />
Nearly a decade ago, when I picked up Mr Howard's<br />
recession, ' in the first year we had 6 per cent growth<br />
in GDP, growth in the economy. We have got it here<br />
4 3/ 4 per cent. It is really quite a modest<br />
assumption.<br />
J: Every 1year?<br />
PM: We did that in the 180s. We ran about 4 1/ 4 per cent a<br />
year a. 11 through the ' 80s and we believe that given the<br />
strong profit share that exists basically in the<br />
economy, the fact that there are no structural budget<br />
deficits over-hanging it, that we have basically good<br />
productive1 wage arrangements, that the benefits of the<br />
economy now can produce a 4 per cent growth through<br />
this period.<br />
J: OK Prime Minister, as you say when you came out of the<br />
last recession that you inherited from your<br />
predecessors, you have got good growth, you've created<br />
jobs, -then the economy overheated, then you had to take<br />
the action you did.<br />
PM: It over-heated Paul, with the globalisation of financial<br />
markets, growing credit at 10 or 20 per cent a year<br />
through the satellite shifting of funds, the<br />
fundabiLlity of money. That's gone. The financial<br />
institutions have pulled their head in. That sort of<br />
credit growth is not on, and we are not going to have<br />
any of that overheating. What we want now is<br />
sustainable low inflationary growth and we are the only </p>
<p>Party that can deliver it. We are the only Party that<br />
broke inflation, and we are the only Party that can<br />
deliver it.<br />
J: OK, and yet I think by your own admission you will go<br />
into the next election and what, you have got 15, 18<br />
months time with an $ 8 billion deficit and still 10 per<br />
cent unemployment?<br />
PM: Coming clown. Coming down to 7 3/ 4 over the period and<br />
with a clef icit turning into a surplus by 1995. In<br />
other words, as the cycle picks up growth, activity,<br />
receipts, salaries, supplements etc. and as<br />
unemployment benefits come down, the budget goes back<br />
into surplus in ' 95 with very large tax cuts.<br />
J: But will enough happen in the next 15 months for you to<br />
leap the enormous political hurdle that faces you at<br />
the moment?<br />
PM: Well, there's no way that a switch from income to<br />
expenditure, as Dr Hewson proposes, will do anything<br />
for recovery. In fact his own economatrician<br />
demonstrated this week that it will actually contract<br />
employment and contract GDP.<br />
J: There is some disagreement about that<br />
PM: No, no. I<br />
J: the argy bargy in Parliament.<br />
PM: There will be no disagreement about the computer model<br />
printout which says, under any scenario, Fightback will<br />
reduce growth and lift unemployment. So this<br />
proposition, a stimulus from a budget which can afford<br />
a stimulus, to get the economy moving but which comes<br />
back to surplus is sensible, and I believe, the only<br />
thing to do.<br />
J: Now, Dr Hewson has criticised your tax reforms and the<br />
big ones as being hogwash?<br />
PM: Well, let me put this to you. When I sat back and<br />
said, ' what should we do here, what can we do to make<br />
Australia move now, what can we do which at the same<br />
time is productive, like rebuilding the railways, the<br />
ports, the roads, TAFE, all of these things at the same<br />
time produce low inflation, we produced this document,<br />
One Nation. What Dr Hewson did was sit back and say,<br />
not what does Australia need, but how can I be<br />
differEtnt from Labor? What can I have that they won't<br />
have? He said, a consumption tax. And if he thinks<br />
that taLxing your food and your clothing and your drycleaning<br />
is going to change the railroads, the roads,<br />
the ports, the wharfs, the airlines, get growth going,<br />
it's not. The fact is, Paul, it's a sterile exercise </p>
<p>in accountancy. This is the only proposition that will<br />
get Australia cracking.<br />
J: Alright, if I can take you to the one-off payment at<br />
between, I think I'm right in saying, $ 100-200 for<br />
families which really says, OK, we know you are<br />
hurting, isn't this what some commentators have most<br />
feared, back to the old Hawke bout.<br />
PM: But in a program of $ 2.3 billion, it is $ 300 million.<br />
It's 0.3 of the 2.3. And why is it there? It's there<br />
so that at early we can get a stimulus in the economy,<br />
because the rail projects and the road projects will<br />
take 6 or 9 months to build up. We don't want to lose<br />
6 or 9 months. So we want to give money to the people<br />
who can use it best, and that's families.<br />
J: Now unemployment is, by your own admission, will still<br />
stay at 10 per cent but coming down. But how many jobs<br />
will you create, meaningful jobs from this package?<br />
PM: In the period, about 880,000, in the forecast 4 year<br />
period 880,000.<br />
J: That's almost close to the million that was achieved<br />
last time.<br />
PM: Well, we achieved a million in about, I think, about 3<br />
years last time, 3 1/ 2 years.<br />
J: Now, if you can't get that 4 per cent growth, and if<br />
something goes wrong with the indicators, you've had it:<br />
haven't you?<br />
PM: Well, we'll get the growth this coming year, which is<br />
the year that matters to the economy, and of course,<br />
politically matters to the Government. 4 3/ 4 is a<br />
conservative assumption for an economy this well off<br />
coming out of recession, low inflation, low interest<br />
rates. Coming out of the last one we had 10 per cent<br />
inflation. Coming out of this one, we have got 1 1/ 2<br />
per cent.<br />
J: And you think the back, as you put it, the stick of<br />
inflation will stay broken?<br />
PM: With the wage arrangements we have concluded with the<br />
ACTU, yes. But it will not stay broken<br />
J: Can you tell me more about that, Prime Minister, by the<br />
way.<br />
PM: Well, the ACTU are saying we will look at, we'll make<br />
the inflation rate of our trading partners, our yard<br />
stick in wage claims, if you give us a reasonable tax<br />
environment. That's the sort of proposition that's<br />
been put. That's what we'll accept. But of course,<br />
there'll be no reasonable wage environment with the GST </p>
<p>doubling the inflation rate. Dr Hewson by his own<br />
admission, doubled the inflation rate. So, that means<br />
interest rates go up, the economy is slower. In this<br />
economy, low inflation, the budget in good fettle, a<br />
high profit share coming as soon as the economy picks<br />
up, the place will grow quickly.<br />
J: Are you going to attract back all those ALP traditional<br />
supporters whom you've lost?<br />
PM: Well, I think, this program is very much a traditional<br />
Labor program. It's building Australia. It's the kind<br />
of reforming building which Labor was always famous<br />
for. A national rail highway, a national electricity<br />
grid, taking over Commonwealth funding of technical and<br />
further education, an international airline policy, a<br />
change to the depreciation to make the private economy<br />
stronger. These are all the things, and of course,<br />
support for families, Labor market reforms. This is<br />
very much a Labor package. But a Labor package at the<br />
right time to pull the nation together and not divide<br />
it, not to cut it up, interest group against interest<br />
group, under some sort of Thatcherite ' survival of the<br />
fittest' strategy which Dr Hewson has adopted.<br />
J: Well, perhaps you are treading this careful line, you<br />
say it is very much traditional Labor but also you give<br />
them the banks that they wanted, there is every<br />
indication that business is going to be pretty happy.<br />
What about the markets?<br />
PM: Well, I think the markets will probably expecting a<br />
package of about $ 3 billion and this is And a<br />
lot of it is on long term productive things, like the<br />
Brisbane-Sydney-Melbourne-Adelaide railway line, like<br />
ring roads around the capital cities. Like support,<br />
infrastructure programs for schools. These are things<br />
which will be there in 5 years from now and in 20 years<br />
from now. In other words, it is not going up in a puff<br />
of smoke, so I should think the market would regard<br />
this as responsible and sensible.<br />
J: And the micro economic reform that business has been<br />
screaming for?<br />
PM: Well, it has taken all the big ones on, Rail, road,<br />
ports, airlines, we are knocking over electricity, we<br />
are knocking over that micro agenda as we knocked over<br />
the macro agenda.<br />
J: Prime Minister, on a completely different subject, the<br />
British Press has gone rabid about you and your<br />
welcoming address to the Queen in Parliament a few days<br />
ago. Are you a rabid republican or a realist setting<br />
up the changing conditions facing Australia and<br />
Britain? </p>
<p>PM: Well look, I have got the Age editorial here, it said<br />
this today, and it's very sensible, it said, ' when the<br />
Prime Minister addresses the Queen, he addresses her as<br />
the Queen of Australia, and its entirely appropriate<br />
for him to articulate independent Australian<br />
attitudes'. I was not addressing the Queen as Queen of<br />
Great Britain, I was saying to her, we've changed, we<br />
are in a. changing part of the world. We are in a part<br />
of the world that's growing rapidly and we are more<br />
independent of Europe, but she is the Queen of<br />
Australia, our Queen. So of course, in that sense, it<br />
is not understood by the editors of the British tabloid<br />
press. An editor of a British tabloid newspaper is a<br />
particularly low form of human life, and no doubt we<br />
will see other similar distorted headlines from them.<br />
J: OK, I hope they don't see a tape of this program, but<br />
Prime Minister, thank you very much indeed for coming<br />
on to Dateline.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
ENDS </p>
