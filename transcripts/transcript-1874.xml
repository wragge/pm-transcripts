VISIT TO SOUTH EAST ASIA 1968<br />
SINGAPORE<br />
ARRIVAL STATEMENT MADE BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. JOHN GORTON 9 JU NE 1968<br />
When I passed through Singapore last week in transit to<br />
Vietnam I explained that my official visit here would be part of a tour<br />
which included several South-East Asian countries. This tour is not<br />
merely one of goodwill on my part as the new Prime Minister of Australia.<br />
It reflects the need for an Australian Prime Minister today to widen his<br />
knowledge of Australia's neighbours in South-East Asia and to gain, at<br />
first hand, experience of the problems which they face and the policies<br />
they are pursuing. I shall be having talks over the next two days with your<br />
Prime Minister, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, and his colleagues, and renewing<br />
my personal acquaintance with a number of them. I expect to give them<br />
an account of my visit to Vietnam and there will be exchanges of views on<br />
various regional questions of concern to both Governments.<br />
My visit is not connected with the Five-Power defence talks<br />
now commencing in Kuala Lumpur, although my discuss-ions here will<br />
naturally include defence and security matters of common interest. The<br />
kind of South-East Asian region that develops in the years ahead, and the<br />
pace of its development, is of vital interest to our two countries. We<br />
have the same basic concern to see in the South-East Asian region a<br />
community of co-operating nations and a climate of order and stability<br />
for national development. I look forward to seeing something of the social and<br />
industrial achievements which are so dramatically changing the appearance<br />
of your island. 1, also hope to learn more about your expansion programmes<br />
for your harbours, shipping, communications and commerical facilities<br />
and for your development and regional economic progress. Relations between<br />
Australia and Singapore are firmly based on useful and practical co-ope ration.<br />
We are both developing peoples, determined to use the<br />
benefits of knowledge and modern technology for our progress and a better<br />
life for our peoples. This is shown by the extensive range of contacts and<br />
exchanges between our two communities, embracing commerce and<br />
education, the professions, tourism and the arts. </p>
