PRIME MINISTER<br />
E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
MIKE CARLTON 2GB TUESDAY, 9 C) CTOBEP,~ 1984<br />
CARLTON: elections whenever-it suits them and their Party.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well it may be Itf you want to come to that<br />
conclusion. It is inaccurate because I made it clear from<br />
fairly early in the peace that what I want~ ed'tod * o ' was to<br />
bring an end to unnecessary elections in this country. So distinct<br />
to any other Prime Minister I am going to the electorate now to<br />
save an election. There would have to be a half Senate election<br />
by April of next year. Then there would have had to have been a<br />
House of Representatives within a relatively short time after,<br />
that. So I'm having the House of Representatives and the half<br />
Senate together which will be the 23rd time that that's happened<br />
in the history of this country. It's the normal practice, but<br />
what distinguishes this situation from all that's gone before is<br />
that I will be going to the peopl. e with a referendum at tbe same<br />
time and say~ ag please vote to ensure that in future there must<br />
be simultaneous elections so that no-Prime Minister will be able<br />
to do what my predecessors have done and deliberately create<br />
pee sta. n. d a duplicated elect ions.<br />
CARLTON: Will you be campaigning strongly on that apart from the<br />
-normal<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Indeed I will because 1 think that the people<br />
don't lik~ e unnecessary elections and I am giving the opportunity<br />
through the referendum to ensure that 64an never be done again.<br />
CARLTON: Alright. Why do you need a fresh mandate?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't need a fresh mandate, I am simply saying<br />
that I believe it is appropriate in the circumstances of having this<br />
poll that the opportunity be given to the Government of an<br />
endorsement for a renewal of their mandate. I have explained why<br />
tbe Parliament that this will be an opportunity to give a fresh<br />
mandate because what we have done is to turn the country around<br />
through the operation of the Prices and Incomes Accord. We have<br />
changed it from no growth to the fastest growing economy in the<br />
wo~ rld. Now the Opposition are saying t ' o the people we will destroy<br />
the whole Accord, the whole basis of consensus, all the mechanisms<br />
wbich have brought trade unions and bubdi$ ss and government working<br />
effectively to produce this economic revolution they want to<br />
tbandon that. So I am saying that this will be an opportunity for / 2 </p>
<p>the people to say if they want the continuation of the approach<br />
which I have brought to this country, or a reversion to the<br />
disasters of the past.<br />
CARLTON: Yes but you see you are going six months early or so<br />
and you are still asking for this fresh mandate when all the polls<br />
chow that the world is yours, you know, Australia is yours.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: -Well you put it that way but what I'm saying is<br />
that the basic reasons I put for going to the election ar'e there<br />
that we have got to get this duplication of elections out of the<br />
way. There must be a half Senate election by April of next yearearly<br />
next year and the tradition in the past is where you have<br />
got to have that half Senate election is to have it at the end of<br />
the preceding year. I Uam doing that but we must do it too to<br />
get the elections back into kilter and to prevent the possibility<br />
of unnecessary elections in the future. Now I~ am saying quite<br />
clearly It is opportun' e in those circumstances that the people of<br />
Australia refresh the mandate for change that we have brought<br />
the creation of a new spirit in Australia and I believe that the<br />
Australian public will want to do that.<br />
CARLTON: Was there a worry, a consideration, that things might<br />
come unstuck in N~ ew South Wales? Your support for Neville Wran<br />
yesterday in the Parliament seemed pretty lukewarm.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think it was lukewarm. Listen what you<br />
have got to distinguish is that Neville Wran mDade a statement<br />
overseas and then around that statment and In respect of that<br />
there could be various interpretations I concede as to whether it<br />
was wise or not.<br />
CARLTON: Possibly contemptuous?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No it was certainly not intended to be contemptuous<br />
in my judgement. But wrapped around the fact of Neville Iran ' s<br />
statement people wanted to put the whole question of whether I was<br />
repudiating Nevill~ e Wran in general. Now I have made it clear that<br />
it has never been my practice in life, whether it's Neville Wran<br />
or anyone else, to abandon friondo oolloaguos on the basis<br />
of smear and innuendo and unsubstantiated allegation. That has<br />
never been my way, It is often the easy way but it is not my way.<br />
So I was making the point that until and I don't believe there<br />
can be but until and unless there was<br />
. some evidence which went to the integrity of Neville Wran as a man,<br />
rather than questions about whether it was wise of him to make a<br />
statement ornot, until that's done he has my support, and I don't<br />
believe there is any evidence. There is certainly none, Mike,<br />
that has been brought to my attention. I don't think you are aware<br />
of any which established any questionnark about the integrity of<br />
the man.<br />
CARLTON: Would you rather he hadn't said what he said yesterday?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I think it could have been perhaps better<br />
left unsaid but I have made it clear that I am not going to make<br />
judgements about a man in those circumstances where a statement<br />
made in particular circumstances are then used to try and* denigrato<br />
a muan generally. They have latched on to that particular statement<br />
which may have been unwise but that's not the point. / 3 </p>
<p>CARLTON: No it probably didn't help you at the timing of an<br />
election announcement does it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It had nothing to do with the timing of the<br />
election announcement. If there is one ill-kept secret in Australian<br />
political life if you like it is that I have been going to have art<br />
election for the reasons that I have put. I o~ me to a conclusion Et<br />
short while ago definitely about the date and I** awaited the returnL<br />
of the Governor-General of Australia. He arrived back at 3.30<br />
yesterday afternoon. I went and saw him at 4.30 and that was it.<br />
Mr. Wran's statement had absolutely and demonstrably had nothing<br />
to do with that time.<br />
CARLTON: No, no, but it didn't help you a lot'.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I don't think it helped or didn't help.<br />
The people of Australia, in my judgement, seem very, very much<br />
more sensible than a lot of you commentators are prone to think.<br />
You people in the gallery and the commentators, you latch onto a<br />
statement by Mr. Wran on the other side of the world, you latch<br />
onto some particular thing and you say that's what the Australian<br />
people are thinking about1that's the big issue. Now I just want<br />
to tell you I have been studying politics for a very, very long<br />
time I think pretty successfully and I know what the Australian<br />
people are concerned about. They are concerned about jobs, they<br />
are concerned about inflation, they are concerned about interest<br />
rates, they are concerned about housing and on all these things<br />
which are uppermost in the daily thinking of ordinary Australians<br />
we have delivered the goods and it is an exerdise in, if 1. may<br />
say So, In periphery politics to suggest that a statement by the<br />
Premier of New South Wales on the other side of the world has<br />
anything to do with people's reaction to an election.<br />
CARLTON: Alright, one last question on this subject: does the<br />
grand partnership still exist?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: What grand partnership are you talking about?<br />
CARLTON: Hawke and Wran it was very much in the news at the<br />
laot election.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: And at this election you will have Neville Wran,<br />
the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party, he lvill' be on<br />
the platform when we launch the cumigi. He will introduce me,<br />
I will then take over the delivery of the policy speech and<br />
CARLTON: Yes but beyond that I mean there was talk about that<br />
grand coalition between Wran and Hawke. That was very big here<br />
in New South Wales.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well the coalition obviously still exists. He<br />
is still the National President of the Party; : by one of the most<br />
overwhelming vot * es of the New South Wales public earlier this<br />
year, he is Premier of New South Wales.<br />
CARLTON: And still your closest ally?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: And I am the Prime Minister of Australia. Those<br />
are facts. 0 0 / 4 </p>
<p>CARLTON: Alri ght., atid Ft111 your nlo. ert ally. in the poltiical<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Who has ever said that Neville Wran is my closest<br />
ally on the political scene. I mean I can't recall having seen<br />
that said.<br />
CAKLTON: I think it was in the last election campaign.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well you might point that out to me,<br />
CARLTON: I mean the photographs were there for a start of the two<br />
you. PRIME MINISTER. WellI ' ll ju&amp; t remind you 6f thg fa. e. t, Neville<br />
wran was inen Tne naTional rresldenL uf the Libur PartLy. As ouhls<br />
he introduced me as the leader of the Labor Party in the Sydney<br />
Town Hall. There was the odd photograph.<br />
CARLTON: YAs and you said I need Wran.<br />
Ltl la'riet stl. t. t li, AuAtralia. New Douth Wales io lita'hg'ft.,<br />

Now you can try as much as you like to get me into the mode of my<br />
opponents of denigrating a mpn because people are smearing and<br />
Li.. . ALL U v. unLtll 1liiftis<br />
day and you won't find me falling into that trap. Can I just<br />
make the point Mike, that if there is one thing that has been clear<br />
in Pooont wookc it it the judgement of th Aiustralian ppnp1P ahnlut<br />
the tet. ie Af the Lenninr nf thn Opponition of trying to Mvq thi<br />
smear and unfounded allegation. People don't like it.<br />
CARLTON: Can I ask you this is the broad bucket question<br />
wh&amp; t krM you going to be doing in th: nowt. fniii ynnrr.? Tr there<br />
going to be a big review of taxation? Is there going to be a<br />
capital gains tax?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That's a quite silly question is there going to<br />
be a capital gains tax. You're talking about a broad question and<br />
then you say I am asking a broad question, is there going to be<br />
a capital gains tax. Look I have made it quite clear in the area<br />
of tax reform, and indeed I think there is no difference between<br />
the Opposition and ourselves on this, and that is that there needs<br />
to be a thoroughgoing review of the tax base in this country.<br />
I have. started the process by discussions in the Economic Planning<br />
Advisory Council with business, the trade unions, and community<br />
organisations. After the election we will expand that process of<br />
consultation and amongst issues that will be looked at will be<br />
the one you mentioned. In the same way as the Liberal Party in<br />
New South Wales recently, it's economic committee, said that capital<br />
gains tax would inevitably from their point of view be looked at in<br />
a thoroughgoing tax review.<br />
CARLTON: Well the Opposition is going to throw that at you.<br />
Peacock will throw it at you.<br />
s $ mas: s as </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER. Wwll I t61l yni what. T'll r. ntnh it and thrQm<br />
right bach at him buuuuUi; IO O Knows. Xnat x fur -M lit, P11 I. . a<br />

out? kriltiE IWTNIXTR. I duui I t A ula it A" in, Rnn I nay diroctlv<br />
to the Australian people that there ntzauds Lu be review af the taox<br />
system to see if we can get a more efficient and a more equitable<br />
tax base. That's common ground across the political spectrum.<br />
The difference between the Liberal/ National Party and ourselves<br />
is that we believe in the approach of consultation and attempted<br />
consensus and that approach is what has turned this country around<br />
from the economic disaster that we inherited to making it the fastest<br />
growing economy in Lthe w' r1d that ij on the basic of the approach<br />
that we adopt. We will adopt the same approach to reviewing the<br />
whole question of tax.<br />
CARLTON: Prime Minister can we keep talklinU tLbruu1h ou' news and<br />
drop the news and keep taling?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You can if you like.<br />
CARLTON: Alright, terrific. The grave question that still worries<br />
many people, and you must concede this, I know you do, is<br />
unemployment and particularly youth unemployment. What have you<br />
got in mind there?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well we will continue the attack on unemployment<br />
in a way which has produced a turn-around. In the last twelve<br />
months of our opponents rule unemployment increased by a quarter<br />
of million. We have brought unemployment down and created a quarter<br />
of a million new Jobs and we have done that by adopting sensible<br />
economic policies which produced growth. As I say, the fastest<br />
growth in the world. Now that's what produces jobs and we will<br />
continue the policies which do that.<br />
CARLTON: It is still too high though, isn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course it's too high but can I suggest to you<br />
that it is better to be bringing unemployment down than to having<br />
it growing to record levels as it did under the economic policies<br />
of our opponents. I mean for God's sake are you going to say it is<br />
still too high and not recognise there is a difference between<br />
bringing it down and having it shooting upwards.<br />
CARLTON: Yes, I am just wondering how far you are going to go<br />
what are you going to do to keep it coming down?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well we will continue the economic policies which<br />
we have put into place which have produced the fastest growth in<br />
the world, which have produced a quarter of a million new jobs in<br />
a year. Do you think that's the sensible thing to do?<br />
CARLTON: Yes. Will there be a special effort for youth unemployment,<br />
and that is still very high. / 6<br />
' I'iLAMUj%. itA A A % A L, </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: Well of course it is high but young people have<br />
benefitted from the growth we've brought in in creating general<br />
jobs. We will continue the Community Employment Program to look<br />
after those who have the longest periods of unemployment. But<br />
more f undamentall y what we are doing is to review the whole<br />
education system to try and make our education system more relevant<br />
so that it will provide our kids with the sort of training in the<br />
skills which are going to equip them better for jobs. It's no<br />
good just increasing funding for education as we have, you have<br />
got to make their education system more relevant so they are better<br />
able to offer themselves for jobs which we are needing, and we<br />
are also reviewing the whole area of training and re-training<br />
programs to make sure that the money that we spend on programs that<br />
we've inherited and some of our own new ones are the most relevant<br />
to equip young people for the changing structure of the economy.<br />
So we're not just having general macro-economic polities. Our<br />
policies in the sphere of education, training-and re-training will<br />
gradually improve this situation.<br />
CARLTON: I read the other day BHP is going to heave out most of<br />
its apprentices at the end of the year, that sort of thing. How<br />
do you get over lumps like that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well let me go to the steel industryand we have<br />
made it infinitely better for the steel industry than it was<br />
before. When we came to office the steel industry was going to<br />
be abolished in this country. They were going to give it away.<br />
Now we brought in the Steel Industry Plan which has saved the steel<br />
industry and made jobs there existent which were going to be<br />
destroyed. So those are the sorts of things you do to gradually<br />
improve the position.<br />
CARLTON: Alright. The Cabinet, the Ministry would you see<br />
any changes after the election?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well Mike what you appreciate is that the Caucus<br />
after the election elects those who will be in the Ministry. Now<br />
my judgement is Mike that they will elect substantially the<br />
same people because I think the Caucus makes the same judgement<br />
as does the electorate generally that the Ministers have done a<br />
good job. So I think I will have basically the same people to<br />
be appointing.<br />
CARLTON: To the same portfolios?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:* As to portfolio I would think there would be<br />
very little change -some but not a great deal because they have<br />
done well.<br />
CARLTON: Would you indicate where those changes might come?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wouldn't.<br />
CARLTON: Would they come within senior ranks of the Cabinet or<br />
more minor changes lower down?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think basically at the relatively lower levels<br />
I mean looking at the senior portfolios all the Ministers there<br />
have done very well -as by the way has the Ministry generally. </p>
<p>CARLTON: Yes,. alright. Immigration: is it going to be an isz<br />
the whole race thing the Prof essor Geof frey Blainey argument 11<br />
that? PRIME MINISTER: I don't think it will be the sort of issue people<br />
feared some time ago because I think the facts have emerged quite<br />
clearly and that is that there has been no change in policy, that<br />
we have done * what we did when we were in Opposition followed the<br />
policies of our predecessors and that is that the criteria of<br />
family reunion and it has meant that as a result of the number of<br />
refugees that camne into this country under the deliberate policy<br />
of the previous government, which we supported,* well those people<br />
who have recently come are entitled to bring close members of their<br />
families in, and that together with tbe unsolicited relative<br />
run-down in applicants which started at the latter years of our<br />
predecessors from European sources, has given a temporary lift in<br />
tbe proportion coming from the Asian region. -But that is on the<br />
basis of the policies of our predecessors and we are not criticisng<br />
them for them. We join them in those-policies. Now the saner<br />
heads in the Liberal Party have recognised to their credit that<br />
those are the facts and I don't believe it will be a basic issue<br />
of the campaign.<br />
CARLTON: Alright. Prime Minister I know you have got to go now<br />
but one last quickie that is going to be hurled at you every day<br />
how much are you going to win by and will you have control of the<br />
Senate?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not saying how * much we will win by. I think<br />
the Australian people will give us a convincing victory. We will<br />
earn it, we will not take the campaign for granted. The Senate<br />
will be tough, . we will be trying to win it but l -et me say this:<br />
if we don'. t well, I,, hope to-but if we don't then we wil work with,,<br />
the elements . In the * Se nate to try and ensure that the program that<br />
the Australian people want is implemented.<br />
CARLTrON: Prime Minister thanks . for your tii.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Thank you Mike.<br />
