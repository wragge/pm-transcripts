F76/ 14<br />
FOR PRESS 31 January 1976<br />
INDEXATION AND EIPLOYD4ENT<br />
The Government took its decision yesterday because it<br />
is vastly concerned about employment and the need to provide<br />
opportunities for those who are out of work, and especially<br />
for those seeking their first jobs.<br />
The number of unemployed will inevitably rise this month,<br />
a s has been widely predicted.<br />
The Government had the unpleasant task of choosing between<br />
the full application of wage indexation and policies which are<br />
designed to curb inflation and to enable. industry to start<br />
providing jobs.<br />
We have placed jobs first. I hope those who will be making<br />
submissions to the Arbitration Commission, and the Commission<br />
itself, will also place jobs first.<br />
There are no soft options left for Australia. The Government<br />
next week will announce difficult ! decisions in relation to its<br />
own expenditure.<br />
Trade union leaders should be more concerned with providing<br />
jobs for those who are unemployed than in asking for higher<br />
and higher wages for those who remain employed.<br />
There is no point in higher wages at the expense of a<br />
neighbour's ' job.. The Arbitration Commission has great influence<br />
on the direction of the Australian economy. </p>
<p>2.<br />
If indirect taxes continue to be applied as part of the<br />
indexation process, the Government's ability to manage the<br />
economy with justice to all sections of the coniimunity will<br />
be seriously jeopardised.<br />
Those who experience the benefits of wage indexation become<br />
an exempt group. Indexation at present compensates them for<br />
the effect of indirect taxes which the rest of the community<br />
have to bear. </p>
