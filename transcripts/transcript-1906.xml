FOR PRESS: AUp1~ 96G8<br />
I F I' P. M. No. 75/ 1968<br />
RETIREMENT OF MR. J. R. WILLOUGHBY<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
I am sure I can speak for all Members of the Parliamentary<br />
Party in paying tribute to Bob Willoughby.<br />
He has made an outstanding contribution to our side of<br />
politics over a period of close to half a century. He has played no small<br />
part in the development and progress of the Liberal Party, and for the<br />
past 17 years has given distinguished service as Federal Director.<br />
He enjoys the respect and friendship of us all, and we shall<br />
be sorry to see him go.<br />
CANBERRA July 1968 </p>
