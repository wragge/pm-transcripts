TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 11 APRIL 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PMV: I'm sure you would like a comment on the Premiers' Conference just<br />
to say that we have already agreed to the... . the States and Territories<br />
have agreed to the offer document, in relation to the annual Loan<br />
Council Premiers' Conference component of this meeting. This is, as<br />
you know, a joint meeting in a sense, a dual meeting it's the<br />
Premiers' Conference, Loan Council and a Council of Australian<br />
Governments meeting. On the first part of the meeting the Premiers'<br />
Conference and Loan Council the Commonwealth provided an offer<br />
document, and that offer has been accepted. We have now begun to<br />
consider the Council of Australian Governments agenda, and the first<br />
item on that agenda is competition policy, and we are now discussing<br />
competition policy and its implementation, the Industry Commission<br />
Report, and what financial commitment the Commonwealth may make<br />
to the States. Now, you would be aware that yesterday late last<br />
evening we circulated an offer document to the States, in respect of<br />
the competition policy changes. Now, this is in response to their<br />
expectations about revenue from the Commonwealth in lieu of changes<br />
they might make under the competition principles. You will recall that<br />
there has been a report by the Industry Commission looking at<br />
potential benefits to the Commonwealth and the States from these<br />
things. Now, the Commonwealth said very clearly that we don't believe<br />
there is any reason why one Commonwealth dollar should be paid to<br />
the States for competition policy, any more than we have asked the<br />
States to pay the Commonwealth for the $ 7 billion we have already<br />
forgone on tariff cuts, for the $ 5-6 billion a year we will continue to<br />
forgo on tariff cuts, let alone all the other micro-economic changes.<br />
But we do want to see this document agreed, you know now we have<br />
been to two previous meetings, and in Darwin the Commonwealth's<br />
attempts to have this agreed to were thwarted by the States<br />
intransigence. This time they are in a better mood to adopt I mean,<br />
it's always an irony that a Labor Government has got to extol the </p>
<p>virtues of competition to conservative governments, but that has been<br />
par for the course now for a number of meetings, and now we would<br />
like to see it agreed. So, we are having a discussion about the<br />
likelihood of the Commonwealth paying funds in satisfaction of a whole<br />
set of benchmark commitments, to the implementation of broad ranging<br />
reforms in electricity, water, gas etc. And we have broken for lunch,<br />
and we will be just picking up the discussion over lunch, and in the<br />
afternoon.<br />
J: Does that mean you're willing to compromiseible?<br />
PM: Well, we've been prepared all the way through to try and meet the<br />
States on matters of legitimate concern to them and gradually we're<br />
narrowing the field of disagreement down. But, were this to happen,<br />
this would be a great change for the country. That is, one of<br />
Australia's great natural advantages is a coal seam down the east<br />
coast of Australia. It's not been one of our national natural advantages<br />
because it's been controlled by monopolies. Whenever we've seen<br />
market prices for gas and competition rules applying for gas, we've<br />
seen more gas reserves and more gas. So, seeing these sorts of<br />
changes come in would be good for the country, good for the States,<br />
and good for the nation.<br />
J: Did the Commonwealth have to make any changes on the grants<br />
outcome to its circulated offer?<br />
PM: On the Premiers Conference outcome?<br />
J: Yes.<br />
PM: No, no, basically, I think, in there of course we have real terms per<br />
capita. This is the second year where we have, well certainly the time<br />
that I was either Treasurer or Prime Minister, it's the second year only<br />
that we've had not simply the real terms maintenance of the payments.<br />
So there's a maintenance of the payments from the Commonwealth to<br />
the States in terms of inflation-proofing them, but also adding a<br />
population factor. So, what we call real terms per capita increases the<br />
size of the pool on offer today and the States have accepted that offer.<br />
J: Has there been an amended proposal from the Commonwealth on the<br />
competition policy stuff this morning?<br />
PM: No, no, there was one circulated though last night.<br />
J: You mentioned tariff policy, are you pleased that Mr Howard has<br />
embraced your tariff policy?<br />
PM: Well, you know. this is follow-the-leader game. I mean, Mr Howard,<br />
banner headlines, banner, banner, " Howard adopts the Government's<br />
tariff policies". Well, he adopts nearly all of our policies. I always say </p>
<p>to people, why then if they are looking for the next Government of<br />
Australia after the next election, take the authors of the policies and<br />
not the pretenders, not the copycats.<br />
J: He says you have stolen half of his.<br />
PM: Name one, name one.<br />
J: So, do you believe Dr Lawrence's version of the Easton affair?<br />
PM: She's denied I don't know much about the details of it, but she's<br />
denied the role ascribed her by the Western Australian Liberal Party.<br />
J: Do you accept that?<br />
PM: Yes, I do.<br />
J: Prime Minister, one of your backbenchers says that restraining orders<br />
in domestic violence situations are too easy to secure. Do you think<br />
that is a defensible position in this day and age?<br />
PM: Well, we all stand on our own views in this business. But I think, the<br />
great pity about this debate in recent times is that, well the<br />
antecedents of the debate rather, is a political one not a moral one. It<br />
is a civil war going on in the Western Australian Liberal Party and this<br />
is the way they believe they should fight it and smear everybody on the<br />
way through.<br />
ends </p>
