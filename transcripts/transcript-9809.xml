TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP AT THE BALLARAT COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTRE,<br />
BALLARAT, 25 OCTOBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Mr Keating, inflation at 5.1 per cent, what sort of impact will that have<br />
on employment rates?<br />
PM: Well, I think, that the headline rate is not the thing that matters here it<br />
is the underlying rate, which is just over 3 per cent 3.1 per cent.<br />
It has jumped quite a bit in the quarter and part of it is a couple of<br />
one-off factors. For instance, the NRMA in New South Wales is no<br />
longer discounting its premiums on third party insurance. It is also<br />
coming from changes to cigarettes and tobacco, in terms of<br />
Government changes there. Motor vehicles Commonwealth sales<br />
tax, which is a one-off thing, it is not going to continue happening.<br />
I think those things alone have added about 0.4 per cent to the rate for<br />
the quarter. So the rate for the quarter was 1.2 per cent.<br />
About 0.4 per cent of the 1.2 per cent came from these one-off factors,<br />
which means that if we look through it and have a look at the true<br />
underlying rate, it is probably around 0.8 per cent for the quarter which<br />
should see us over the year well within the 3 per cent.<br />
J: So you are confident the Government can keep the lid on wages?<br />
PM: Oh yes I think so. And the other thing is, of course, some of this bloom<br />
comes off the very high rates of growth of last year where the economy<br />
was running at 6 per cent and then, of course, at 5 per cent and then 4<br />
per cent. It is now slowing to around 3 1/ 2 per cent to 4 per cent. But<br />
while, of course, all of these CPI's record a bit of past history and they<br />
are picking up the bloom on that demand in the economy and that has<br />
now passed through as policy slowed things down a bit to a<br />
sustainable level. And that is why the Government did the things it did<br />
this year to slow the economy up to make it sustainable, to make sure<br />
the inflation rate over time is low and sustainable. </p>
<p>J: Will it damage the economy?<br />
PM: Oh no, No, I think Australia has broken the back, in a serious way, of<br />
inflation. What we have got to do now is be vigilant about it, but that is<br />
what the Government is. That is why we have taken the Budget into<br />
surplus. That is why we had those monetary adjustments in November<br />
and December last year and that is the reason why the economy has<br />
now successfully slowed.<br />
J: Will there be any interest rate cuts before the end of the year?<br />
PM: It has got very little implications for interest rates none I think.<br />
J: Ballarat has a history of high unemployment. What can the people of<br />
Ballarat expect between now and the end of the year?<br />
PM: Well it can e xpect growth, it can expect the sort of Government<br />
commitments that I have made today. You know, $ 6 million we are<br />
spending on the School of Mines Technical College. General support<br />
through Commonwealth programs through Working Nation. Support<br />
for the long term unemployed and the young unemployed. But, more<br />
generally, of course higher levels of growth. And one of the things<br />
I keep saying is, you know you don't have to be an economic genius to<br />
know that with productivity these days, we are getting more output<br />
from fewer people. So to keep providing the jobs for the many, you<br />
have got to have even more output, which means even more growth<br />
and what party is set up in Australia to give Australia growth?<br />
The Labor Party. Because we are the only people who can basically<br />
keep the wage genie from pushing wage inflation and therefore that is<br />
why we have always run a more high growth economy than the<br />
Coalition. And these days, let me make the point again, if you are<br />
getting more output from fewer people, more output from a given level<br />
of growth, less employment from a given level of growth, what do you<br />
need to take up the people? You need even more growth. So you<br />
have got to be able to run a pro-growth economy, which we can do.<br />
J: Mr Chirac has called your Government excessive and you a follower<br />
and not a leader.<br />
PM: Yes, well he is a bit stunned, Mr Chirac. But the most important thing<br />
is we are going to pull him into the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty<br />
and as I announced yesterday, we are now making it the target and<br />
the central element of the Government's policy on disarmament, the<br />
eradication of nuclear of weapons world-wide and this means a<br />
number of approaches. First of all, getting a comprehensive ban on<br />
the testing of weapons, stopping the production of fissile material and<br />
then starting to chew away at the weapons inventory those<br />
50,000 warheads which are sitting out there. Now Australia has had a<br />
lot of success in this in the past. We were one of the principal<br />
countries, the principal country in fact, behind the eradication of a </p>
<p>whole class of weapons with chemical weapons by the establishment<br />
of the Chemical Weapons Convention. And we have done it once, and<br />
I would like to see us provide the lead again. So we are the ones<br />
leading. All he is doing, I think, is sort of living in the sort of after-glow<br />
the twilight of the Cold War still testing weapons when what he<br />
ought to be is removing them.<br />
J: Australian Governments since the 1970s have been committed to the<br />
elimination of nuclear weapons. How are you different.<br />
PM: Yes, they are committed, but they haven't been actively running a<br />
policy on it and pulling together world bodies and articulating these<br />
things in bodies such as the United Nations. And they might have<br />
articulated in the 1970s, but in the 1990s it was a Labor Government<br />
that got, in Australia, the world to sign up to the Chemical Weapons<br />
Convention. Just as it was a Labor Government that got the world to<br />
change its view about Antarctica, or about Cambodia. We're quite<br />
effective. We're a relatively small country but we are effective. And<br />
I think our foreign policy processes are trusted by many countries<br />
around the world and I think you will see Australia, in the<br />
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, carrying a very large part of the<br />
international load.<br />
J: Are you grateful for Mr Chirac for getting Australia's line on nuclear<br />
testing stand up in the context of the UN celebrations instead of<br />
Bill Hayden?<br />
PM: Oh it doesn't matter.<br />
J: Was Gary Gray right when he said the only problem with the<br />
[ inaudible] Cabinet<br />
PM: Oh, God knows. I didn't go. I mean what rock did you crawl out from<br />
under with all these questions?<br />
J: [ inaudible] ASIA Report influence of right-wing groups harming ties<br />
with Asia?<br />
PM: Well we have security organisations to keep an eye on these sort of<br />
developments and the place to put those sort of observations is in their<br />
reports and that is what they are doing and they will do a professional<br />
task in keeping surveillance on these sort of groups and individuals.<br />
J: Do you share the concerns?<br />
PM: Well that is a matter for them, they are making the observation.<br />
J: How serious are you about changing the taxation powers in the<br />
Constitution? </p>
<p>PM: Well the Liberal Party I mean here we are nearly a century after<br />
Federation, here we are with the development now of a national<br />
economy. Here we are, 18 million of us, in this large continent making<br />
our way in Asia and they want to fracture it, fracture the nation by<br />
going back to six individual States with six State income taxes. What<br />
Peter Costello is about and made clear in the Business Review<br />
Weekly this week, is having six State income taxes. Now, I ask you,<br />
where would the nation be if we had six little economies in this country<br />
not one national economy, not one national Government truly able to<br />
operate the Australian economy and where would we be in Asia and<br />
the world with that sort of approach. I mean the Liberals are not a<br />
national party, they are a complexion of six States, they are a<br />
State-based organisation and what they want to do is take Australia<br />
back basically to pre-Federation. Well the country has moved on, it<br />
has moved past them.<br />
ends </p>
