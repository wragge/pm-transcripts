PRIf'IE. PI, 1STER'S QUEENSLAND BROADCAST HO, -23<br />
ABORIGINALS<br />
SUNDAY 17 AUGUST 1975<br />
THIS WEEKEND I HAVE BEEN IN THE NORTHERN<br />
TERRITORY, WHERE I ATTENDED A UNIQUE AND HISTORIC<br />
CEREMONY YESTERDAY AFTERNOON. I HANDED TO REPRESENTATIVES<br />
OF THE GURINDJI PEOPLE A LEASE CONFERRING UPON THEM<br />
UNDISPUTED RIGHTS TO THEIR ANCIENT TRIBAL LANDS AT<br />
IWATTIE CREEK. FOR THE FIRST TIME, ABORIGINAL PEOPLE<br />
HAVE BEEN GIVEN RIGHTS TO THEIR OWN LAND LAND WHICH<br />
THEIR ANCESTORS FIRST INHABITED MANY THOUSANDS OF YEARS<br />
AGO, AND WHICH WILL HENCEFORTH BE THEIRS IN PERPETUITY.<br />
YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT A DEEPLY EMOTIONAL<br />
EXPERIENCE THIS WAS FOR EVERYONE CONCERNED FOR THE<br />
ABORIGINALS THEMSELVES, FOR ME AND MY MINISTERS, FOR<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND FOR REPRESENTATIVES<br />
OF OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES WITH A CONCERN FOR OUR<br />
ABORIGINAL PEOPLE. W'E GATHERED NEAR WAVE HILL STATION,<br />
WEST OF THE VICTORIA RIVER, SOME 200 MILES NORTH-WEST<br />
OF TENNANT CREEK, ALL OF US HAD A VERY KEEN SENSE OF<br />
HISTORY IN THE MAKING, OF SOMETHING CRUCIAL TO OUR<br />
NATIONAL SPIRIT AND IDENTITY, OF A PROCESS WHOSE ORIGINS<br />
STRETCH BACK TO THE VERY BEGINNINGS OF HUMAN SETTLEMENT ON<br />
THIS CONTINENT. I KNOW THAT AS QUEENSLANDERS YOU WILL HAVE<br />
A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THIS CEREMONY, BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE<br />
ABORIGINALS IN YOUR STATE THAN IN ANY OTHER, AND MORE CONTACT<br />
BETWEEN ABORIGINALS AND OTHER AUSTRALIANS. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
As QUEENSLANDERS YOU WILL UNDERSTAND BETTER<br />
THAN ANYONE ELSE THE DEEP IMPORTANCE OF LAND RIGHTS TO<br />
THE ABORIGINAL PEOPLE. IT IS ONLY WHEN WE MOVE AMONG<br />
ABORIGINALS, AND LIVE CLOSE TO THE LAND OURSELVES, THAT<br />
WE CAN BEGIN TO FEEL THE ENORMOUS SIGNIFICANCE ALMOST<br />
A SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE OF WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED<br />
THIS WEEKEND. IT ISN'T JUST A MATTER OF ABORIGINES<br />
WANTING LAND FOR PROFIT OR SECURITY OR PASTORAL<br />
DEVELOPMENT THOUGH CERTAINLY THE LAND IN QUESTION,<br />
.1250 SQUARE MILES, WILL BE USED AS A CATTLE STATION.<br />
THEY RECOGNISE AND I THINK MOST AUSTRALIANS HAVE<br />
COME TO RECOGNISE THAT THE WHOLE QUESTION OF LAND<br />
RIGHTS GOES TO THE VERY ROOTS OF THE ABORIGINALS'<br />
RIGHTS AND DIGNITY AS A PEOPLE, THEIR CLAIMS REST ON<br />
A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN INSTINCT THE YEARNING TO BELONG<br />
TO THE LAND OF THEIR ANCESTORS, TO FEEL PART OF THEIR<br />
TRIBAL AND RACIAL ORIGINS, TO KNOW THEY HAVE A REAL<br />
AND LIVING STAKE IN THE LAND WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT<br />
TO THEIR CULTURE AND MYTHOLOGY. 1 1/ 3 </p>
<p>UNFORTUNATELY IT HAS TAKEN US A VERY LONG TIME<br />
TO RECOGNISE THESE RIGHTS AND BEGIN TO RESTORE THEM<br />
TO THE ABORIGINAL PEOPLE, IT IS JUST NINE YEARS AGO<br />
THIS MONTH THAT THE GURINDJI ON WAVE HILL STATION<br />
WALKED OFF IN PROTEST AGAINST THEIR LIVING AND<br />
EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS, EXACTLY SEVEN YEARS AGO ON<br />
BUDGET DAY IN AUGUST 1968 I RAISED THE PLIGHT OF<br />
THE GURINDJI AS A MATTER OF URGENCY IN THE NATIONAL<br />
PARLIAMENT, THEIR CLAIM FOR LAND RIGHTS WAS DEBATED IN<br />
PARLIAMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THE INITIATIVE OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY, THERE FOLLOWED YEARS OF<br />
NEGOTIATIONS TO SECURE FOR THE GURINDJI A TITLE<br />
TO THEIR LAND, VESTEYS, THE LONDON GROUP OF<br />
COMPANIES WHICH HELD THE LEASES TO THE LAND, OFFERED<br />
TO SURRENDER SOME OF THE LAND TO THE GURINDJI. THE<br />
PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT DID VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT,<br />
AGREEMENT WAS FINALLY REACHED BETWEEN VESTEYS AND MY<br />
GOVERNMENT LAST DECEMBER, WE ARE PROVIDING MORE THAN<br />
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP THE GURINDJIS MOVE THEIR<br />
CATTLE AND IMPROVE FACILITIES ON THEIR LAND, I SHOULD<br />
SAY THAT VESTEYS HAVE COOPERATED FULLY WITH THE<br />
GOVERNMENT AT EVERY STAGE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS, I HOPE<br />
THEIR EXCELLENT EXAMPLE WILL BE FOLLOWED BY OTHER<br />
HOLDERS OF LEASEHOLD LAND TO WHICH REASONABLE CLAIM<br />
BY THE ABORIGINES CAN BE ESTABLISHED, / 4 </p>
<p>QUITE CLEARLY OUR OBLIGATION TO THE ABORIGINAL PEO,.<br />
DOESN'T END WITH THIS ONE GRANT OF LAND AT WIATTIE CREEK,<br />
THE WHOLE ISSUE OF LAND RIGHTS IS VAST AND COMPLEX, AND THERE<br />
ARE NUMEROUS CLAIMS BY ABORIGINALS FOR LAND IN OTHER PARTS<br />
OF AUSTRALIA, ALL THESE CLAIMS WILL HAVE. TO BE EXAMINED,<br />
ONE OF OUR FIRST ACTS AS A GOVERNMENT WAS TO APPOINT A<br />
ROYAL COMMISSION TO ADVISE ON WAYS IN WHICH ABORIGINAL LAND<br />
RIGHTS MIGHT BE RECOGNISED, THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF<br />
MR JUSTICE WOODWARD'S FIRST REPORT IN JULY 1973 WERE ACCEPTED,<br />
IN PRINCIPLE BY THE GOVERNMENT AND TWO REGIONAL LAND COUNCILS<br />
WERE ESTABLISHED, WE HAVE PREPARED LEGISLATION, WHICH<br />
WILL BE INTRODUCED IN THE COMING BUDGET SESSION, TO GIVE<br />
EFFECT TO THE 10OODWARD REPORT AND PREPARE THE WAY FOR THE<br />
JUST AND ORDERLY TRANSFER OF LAND TO ABORIGINALS WHEREVER<br />
THEIR TRIBAL RIGHTS CAN BE PROVED.<br />
I HOPE THERE WILL BE NO RESISTANCE OR OBSTRUCTION<br />
TO THIS PROCESS, WE ARE DOING SOMETHING TO REDRESS THE<br />
LONG HISTORY OF INJUSTICE AND REPRESSION FROM WHICH ABORIGINALS<br />
HAVE SUFFERED, YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT A REFERENDUM WAS<br />
CARRIED IN 1957 TO GIVE THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT POWER<br />
TO LEGISLATE FOR THE WELFARE OF ABORIGINALS, QUEENSLANDERS,<br />
LIKE ALL OTHER AUSTRALIANS, VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY FOR THAT<br />
REFERENDUM, THE SAD TRUTH IS THAT FAR TOO LITTLE HAS<br />
BEEN DONE TO IMPLEMENT THE SPIRIT OF THAT DECISION, IT IS<br />
NOT JUST A MATTER OF GIVING MORE MONEY FOR HOUSING, HEALTH<br />
AND EDUCATION THOUGH CERTAINLY WE HAVE GIVEN MORE MONEY,<br />
MUCH MORE MONEY, THAN ANY PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT, </p>
<p>S HE REAL PROBLEM IS TO OVERCOME DEEP-SEATED PREJUDICES,<br />
OLD HABITS OF DISTRUST AND DISCRIMINATION. I'M AFRAID THAT<br />
HERE IN QUEENS_ AND DISCRIMINATORY LAWS REMAIN ON THE STATUTE BOOK,<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS PASSED LEGISLATION TO OUTLAW<br />
ALL FORMS OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND LAST YEAR WE BROUGHT<br />
IN FURTHER LEGISLATION IN THE NATIONAL PARLIAMENT TO<br />
OVERRIDE SPECIFIC DISCRiMINATORY LAWS IN QUEENSLAND, IWE DON T<br />
GET ANY PARTICULAR PLEASURE FROM ACTING IN THIS WAY, BUT THE<br />
RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF THE ABORIGINAL PEOPLE AND<br />
AUSTRALIA'S REPUTATION AS A NATION ARE TOO IMPORTANT<br />
FOR THESE OBJECTIONABLE LAWS TO BE TOLERATED, WE MUST USE<br />
OUR POWERS TO OVERRIDE THEM POWERS CONFERRED UPON US<br />
IN THE REFERENDUM, AFTER ALL, VWE ARE NOT THE FIRST AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT TO FIGHT THESE LAWS. MiR GORTON'S GOVERNMENT DID<br />
ITS BEST TO GET THEM REMOVED, AND THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT<br />
DEFIED , IR GORTON'S EFFORTS JUST AS IT'S DEFYING MINE,<br />
So THE STRUGGLE IS STILL GOING ON THE STRUGGLE<br />
TO GIVE ABORIGINALS FULL EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW, TO<br />
IMPROVE THEIR RIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITIES, TO RAISE THEIR<br />
STANDARD OF LIVING, TO GIVE THEM TRUE DIGNITY AS A PEOPLE,<br />
TO HELP. THEM RUN THEIR OWN AFFAIRS AND MAKE THEIR OWN<br />
DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR FUTURE AND THE CONDUCT OF THEIR LOCAL<br />
COMMUNITIES. IT'S A TASK FOR WHICH WE ALL HAVE A PARTICULAR<br />
RESPONSIBILITY AS AUSTRALIANS AND IT'S A TASK WHICH<br />
VARIES FROM PLACE TO PLACE, FROM STATE TO STATE, FROM<br />
COMMUNITY TO COMMUNITY, THERE ARE NO SIMPLE, ALL-EMBRACING<br />
POLICIES FOR ABORIGINAL ADVANCEMENT. </p>
<p>WE HAVE TO WORK STEADILY AND PATIENTLY AND DO WHAT<br />
WE CAN, AS BEST WE CAN, WHEREVER IT 1S POSSIBLE TO<br />
TAKE ACTION. I AM SURE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF<br />
QUEENSADRS WILL SUPPORT OUR EFFORTS AND SHARE<br />
MY PERSONAL SATISFACTION WITH EVERYTHING THAT WAS<br />
ACH IEVED, AND SYMBOLISED, BY YESTERDAY'S CEREMONY<br />
AT WArTIE CREEK, </p>
