FOR PRESS 23 APRIL 1978<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
A new and significant stage has now been reached in the<br />
development of the relationship between Australia and Japan<br />
following our discussions in Tokyo this week.<br />
Trade issues that involve only Australia and Japan issues<br />
that are regularly discussed by Ministers and officials<br />
were put aside. Instead, Prime Minister Fukuda and I turned<br />
exclusively to the much broader problems of world trade and<br />
the world economy.<br />
Although these topics may seem remote and not of direct<br />
concern to Australians, the fact is what happens to world<br />
trade is of vital importance to our country because, like<br />
Japan, we are most dependent for our continued prosperity<br />
on the sustained growth of world trade.<br />
It is in Australia's interest as a major trading nation that<br />
world trade become freer and expand, because it will have a<br />
direct effect on what we sell, what we produce, and what<br />
we export. This in turn will have a direct impact on our<br />
living standards, and will help create new jobs for Australians.<br />
The aim of my discussions with Mr. Fukuda was to explore<br />
informally our concern about the direction of international<br />
trade and the world economy. I am now aware that there is a<br />
significant degree of common accord between Australia and<br />
Japan about the problems the world faces. There is also a<br />
real understanding about the kind of solutions that we all<br />
want. Our talks in Tokyo this week took place at a critical time.<br />
Heads of Government throughout the world are holding a series<br />
of important meetings throughout the first half of this year.<br />
These will have a lasting influence on how the world faces up<br />
to the difficulties confronting trade, and the question of<br />
raising the living standards of the developing poorer countries.<br />
There is an urgent need to find solutions to widen the basis<br />
for an equitable expansion of world trade. It is also vital<br />
that this is not confined to the major countries developing<br />
countries must also be involved if the world is to<br />
realistically expect success. / 2 </p>
<p>Australia and Japan are great trading nations. Japan is the<br />
third largest in the worl. d while our trade with one another<br />
is the seventh largest. We therefore together have a major<br />
contribution to the international discussions designed to make<br />
sure that the right decisions are made at this critical time.<br />
In the multilateral trade negotiations that have been taking place<br />
between the major nations since 1973, discussions have centred<br />
on industrial and manufactured goods.<br />
Australia strongly believes that the scope of the MTN must be<br />
widened. We believe agriculture must be included in the<br />
negotiations if we are to achieve the objective so necessary<br />
to regenerate world trade.<br />
offers have been made by the major industrial nations for a<br />
percent drop in tariffs in manufactured goods, starting<br />
in 1980. This formula sound impressive, but what does it mean?<br />
Average industrial tariffs are about 10 percent. As cuts will<br />
be fazed in over eight years that is about half a percent<br />
per year this is hardly a major catalyst to encourage<br />
world trade. For these reasons Japan understands why we will<br />
continue to press forcefully for agriculture. to be included in<br />
the MTN discussions.<br />
An associated and central problem to all these issues is the<br />
relationship between the developed and developing countries, and<br />
the desire of the developing countries for a secure and stable<br />
income forthe commodities they produce. In Australia, we have<br />
particular experience in testing the merit of stabilisation<br />
schemes our wool marketing arrangements are a fine example<br />
of how t'--he long term interest of both the consumer and producer<br />
are protected.<br />
On this question, an international proposal for a Common Fund to<br />
finance a program of commodity price stabilisation has been<br />
proposed, however progress has stalled on a number of issues,<br />
including the question of direct contribution by governments.<br />
We believe that governments should support such a Fund directly.<br />
There is an obligation on governments for direct involvement<br />
and concern. The Japanese Government appreciates Australia's<br />
concern on this matter. Both countries have now agreed<br />
that our senior officials will consult together to find ways of<br />
bringing the various world views on this key question together.<br />
During discussions with Mr. Fukuda and throughout extensive<br />
discussions between officials we found a great measure of<br />
agreerment on objectives and ideals to try and find solutions<br />
to the world's trade and economic problems.<br />
Japan greatly appreciated that we came not to haggle or barter<br />
over products, but to discuss global economic concerns. Japan<br />
welcomed this opportunity to canvass areas of co-operation in<br />
looking to global solutions. </p>
<p>I believe our talks this week demonstrate our commitment<br />
to continue to act as a responsible member of the international<br />
community. Australia today has international obligations. These will be<br />
met. It is no longer good enough for an Australian Government<br />
to say that other nations are larger, more powerful and that these<br />
questions are best left to them. We have a responsibility to<br />
our own people to act in their interests in every way.<br />
1978 could well be a watershed in events that will dictate the<br />
world economic climate for the remainder of the century.<br />
Australia, as a major trading power, has so much at stake.<br />
We recognize the limits of our influence on world economic<br />
affairs but it is our responsibility and obligation to act in<br />
the interests of all Australians in international forums at<br />
every possible opportunity. If we do not attempt to act with<br />
our utmost vigour, history could well comdemn us. </p>
