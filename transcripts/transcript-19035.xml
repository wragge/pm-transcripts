<p>Clean-up and recovery grants of up to $25,000 are now available for small businesses, primary producers and not-for-profit organisations in areas severely affected by flooding in Queensland.</p>
<p>This assistance, available under Category C of the jointly funded Federal/State Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA), will initially apply to organisations and primary producers in Bundaberg, North Burnett, Fraser Coast, Gympie and Lockyer Valley.  The Commonwealth and Queensland Governments will continue to assess the impact of the floods on other areas to see if this assistance should be activated elsewhere.</p>
<p>The assistance is designed to help with the economic impacts that these devastating floods have had on local businesses and the wider community.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government is also ready to work with the Queensland Government to establish a community recovery fund to restore community networks, functions and facilities.</p>
<p>The activation of Category C assistance is in addition to the range of support already available, including concessional loans up to $250,000 for primary producers and small businesses.</p>
<p>These loans will help primary producers cover costs such as repairing or replacing damaged plant and equipment, repairing or replacing buildings, purchasing livestock to replace those lost in the disaster event and re-planting, restoring or re-establishing areas affected by the disaster event.</p>
<p>For small business, these loans can be used for purposes such as repairing or replacing damaged plant and equipment, repairing or replacing buildings, supplying stock for up to one month and maintain liquidity of the business.</p>
<p>Primary producers in these areas can also apply for freight subsidies.</p>

<p>The Disaster Income Recovery Subsidy is being made available to individuals in the hardest hit areas of Bundaberg, Gympie, Fraser Coast, North Burnett and Lockyer Valley.</p>
<p>There are far too many families in these areas that have lost their income as a result of this disaster, adding further hardship to an already difficult recovery process. </p>
<p>This additional assistance provides payments to individuals that have lost their income.  The Federal assistance will ensure that employees are able to stay in these disaster affected areas and will support the longer-term recovery of the devastated local and regional economies.</p>
