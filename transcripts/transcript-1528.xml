ASIAN TOUR 1967<br />
DEP. ARTURE OF THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. HAROLD<br />
HOLT FROM MASCOT AIRPORT, SYDNEY 28TH MARCH, 1967<br />
Before departing on his tour of Asia, the Prime Minister made the following<br />
comments to the Press in response to questions<br />
Q. What do you expect to come out of this trip, Sir?<br />
PM: There are s everal valuable purposes, as I see them. First, this<br />
is an area of great strategic significance for Australia. We have been<br />
involved militarily at least four times in the last 25 years in this<br />
area, but my visit isn't primarily concerned with matters of security.<br />
I merely mention that because it reveals how important the area<br />
strategically is to Australia. Secondly, Australia is becoming<br />
increasingly involved in the trading possibilities in the area. Our trade<br />
with Japan, of course, has built up dramatically, and I think this is*<br />
only a pointer to what we can expect to come in the years ahead,<br />
If we cultivate out opportunities skilfully and successfully.<br />
Thirdly, quite obviously in this area, Australia has the possibility<br />
of making and should be making a diplomatic contribution. There<br />
are agencies now developing ASPAC, the Asian Development Bank,<br />
such meetings as the Manila Conference, SEATO, some of them for,<br />
security reasons, others for trade reasons, some for economic<br />
development. I want my visit to emphasise to the people in that area<br />
that Australia is conscious of its own increasing involvement in the<br />
problems and possibilities of the area, and I think it useful Witb all<br />
the reporting that you people are able to do on these matters so well<br />
for Austral ians to know how important and significant these countries<br />
have become for us.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, will you be discussing the Viet Nam war<br />
in all these places you are calling at?<br />
PM: Oh, I wouldn't expect so. I haven't got any specific negotiations<br />
or treaty arrangements or conference proposals or anything of that<br />
sort. No, it is an opportunity to get to know better people and<br />
countries that are closely neighbouring to Australia and to have them<br />
get to know Australia better.<br />
Q. Is it possible that our aid to these countries might be increased<br />
as a result of this visit?<br />
PM:-Well, our aid curve has been a rising one but I would not want to<br />
give any impression that I see any substantial enlar gement of what<br />
we are already doing. Australia per capita ranks high among the<br />
aid-giving countries of the world. / 2 </p>

Q. Will there be any chances for talks on Asian migrants for<br />
Aus trali a?<br />
PM: Well, you know, over recent years there has been a<br />
considerable liberalisation of our policy there. In the years since the<br />
Second World War, some 30, 000 people have come into Australia<br />
who would not have been admissible under the policies that oa'tained<br />
earlier. More than 6, 000 have been naturalised under revised<br />
arrangements in quite recent years. We have got the best part of<br />
12, 000 students from Asia in our universities and colleges. So<br />
there has been, I think, a sensible liberalisation of the arrangements<br />
which previously existed.<br />
Q. Will there be further liberalisation?<br />
PM: Well, I am not wanting to be specific on that. That is a matter<br />
of Government policy, which I wouldn't be in a position to develop here<br />
today. Thank you. </p>
