PRIME MIISTER<br />
FOR MbEDIA p Tuesday 15 March, 1933<br />
The Premier of South . ustralia, Mr Bannon, has requested<br />
that Commonwealth approval be. iven to donations to public<br />
appeals on behalf of victims of the recent floods in the<br />
Gawler and Barossa Valley regions of South Australia be<br />
regarded as tax deductible in accordance with the provisions<br />
of the taxation legislation.<br />
I have advised the Premier that the Deputy Commissioner<br />
of Taxation in South Australia has the delegated authority<br />
to approve such requests provided the public appeals<br />
conform with the requirements of the legislation.<br />
I thoroughly support the Premier's approach and have<br />
informed him that the Deputy Commsissioner will give this<br />
matter prompt and sympathetic consideration.<br />
