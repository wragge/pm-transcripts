Text of Speech Made by IMir. HIolvoake<br />
Right Hon. Harold Holt, Mr:. Stevenson, Your Excellencies, my<br />
Ministerial and Parliamentary colleagues, and Jentlemen:<br />
It gives me tremendous pleasure on oehalf of you all<br />
and on behalf of all of the people of New Zealand, to issue the<br />
warmest welcome that I am capaole of doing to our Juest of Honour,<br />
the Ri. ht Hon. Harold Holt, Prime Minister of Australia. It is<br />
only 12 brief months since he ecame Prime Minister of Australia,<br />
but in that time he has already won for himself a very distinctive<br />
place and earned a reputation for decision-making and for veing a<br />
very decisive and active leader, and we are all delighted that<br />
he is able to find the time possible practically a long weekend<br />
out of a very busy life to come to meet New Zealanders on their<br />
own ground. This we take as a great compliment to us. are<br />
delighted also of course that his charming and elegant wife was<br />
aole to accompany him.<br />
Need I say that Australians and ' ew Zealanders have<br />
always been close friends, and we always will be. I think that<br />
our relationship is without parallel throughout the world. It is<br />
unique. There is nothing quite like it. It is true that we are<br />
linked together by treaty, but it is not the formal word, it is<br />
not the printed word, it is not the treaty that really binds us<br />
together. These things I think, are embedded deep in our<br />
unIerstanding of each other, in our mutual respect, in our common<br />
heritage, and in our common destiny.<br />
' e have always oeen aware of many similarities. lie<br />
have the same language almost the same, I'm not up to date on<br />
this. I remember an old friend of mine many years ago telling me<br />
that he could speak the Australian language. So I asked him why,<br />
and he told me he visited Australia once. It was in the time of<br />
the fight for the universal franchise a long time ago. He said<br />
he was going down a street at King's Blank Cross and he heard two<br />
Australians arguin, and one said " Bill, what do they mean ' one<br />
man, one vote' And Bill said ".' ell it's simple: it's just<br />
one blank man one blank vote." And John said if they<br />
blanketty well mean one blank man, one blank vote, why don't they<br />
blanketty well say so." He contended that he had in that short<br />
time learned to speak the Australian language. I am not better<br />
informed on what he meant or actually what happened than that.<br />
Our languae our origins, our membership of the<br />
Commonwealth, our mutual love of sport our determination to fight<br />
for the liberties of man which we consider fundamental to our<br />
mutual way of life these thinis we have so much in common. These<br />
are, I believe, the basic truths and principles upon which our<br />
deep friendship rests: these are the things. I do want to make<br />
this point and Harold Holt ; would, I am sure, wish me to make it<br />
that neither of us is either the image or the echo of the other.<br />
* 7e have also dissimilar characteristics and these are understandable.<br />
New Zealand is a group of islands. Australia is a great continent<br />
one of the treat continents of the world. In New Zealand we have<br />
almost matchless resources for pastoral pursuits, the growing of / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
grass almost a perfect climate as you will have noticed,<br />
Harold. I am bound in extenuation to point out that this is<br />
the tail-end of cyclone " Dinah" which originated somewhere in the<br />
great continent towards our north-west somewhere, I think. On<br />
the other hand, of course, Australia has vast supplies of coal,<br />
iron, and very many other now very valuable minerals, in addition<br />
to her great agricultural wealth. Dissimilar we have less than<br />
000,000 population Australia, 12 000,000. So these are the<br />
obvious differences between us, and that will continue to produce and<br />
perhaps emphasise, and some people over-emphasise further<br />
aifferences. I think this an inevitable thing. People do tend to<br />
over-emphasise the difference oetween Jrothers and sisters, because<br />
they expect them to be so much alike. They do not do this where<br />
people are not closely related. These are the obvious differences<br />
in what we can produce, what we may achieve, but what is important,<br />
we think, is that our peoples are ooth seeking the same goals<br />
together and in very much the same ways. 1e are moving toward<br />
them together. This I believe, particularly in recent years<br />
has been happening in a very great variety of settings in the<br />
Commonwealth in the United Nations, in SEATO and AZUS, in ECAFE<br />
the Colombo flan, ASPAC, and now in the Asian Development 3ank and<br />
other spheres I could mention. I think it is worth calling to our<br />
minds that some 65 years ago, when the people of Australia were<br />
considering the question of a Federal Constitution, we were<br />
invited to discuss this with them and perhaps take a part and<br />
become a part of that Federation. It was considered. Those who<br />
preceded us decided no. ie had our own special destiny: we had<br />
our own special aspirations: and so we would keep apart. ., e<br />
felt that we had -erhaps a distinctive contrioution to make. In<br />
our humble way we have tried to make it. 3ut again I come back to<br />
the fact that particul. rly in the last 25 years in this very<br />
rapidly changing world, we have reacted to the same problems, the<br />
same positions, the same challenges in very much the same way. The<br />
discussions that my Cabinet colleagues and I were privileged to<br />
have with Mr. Holt this morning only tended and served to emphasise<br />
and underline that fact. We have ooth learned of course that we<br />
not only cannot ignore but we desire to know our near neighbours<br />
in the north much better the people of South East Asia and of<br />
Asia generally. ie realise more than ever and every day that<br />
goes past does emphasise it that our destiny is tied up with<br />
these countries in the matter of security, culture trade. Je<br />
can learn much from them, from the association with their old<br />
and their rich cultures.<br />
' e have learned to make new friends and we have<br />
made them very much together. Yes, there are differences between<br />
us but we do recognise that our paths lie very close parallel.<br />
I think nerhaps the development of recent years with the tremendous<br />
travel between our two countries of our own peoples: I am<br />
informed about 50,000 each year now businessmen, tourists,<br />
artists, sportsmen and the rest. This of course, is serving to<br />
tie us much more closely together, and 1 look forward, we in ew<br />
Zealand look forward, to a continuation and indeed a growth of<br />
these exchanges between our peoples so that not only Parliamentarians,<br />
not only businessmen, but the man in the street as we label him,<br />
can get to know the other on their own ground. This is very<br />
important indeed.<br />
Mrs. Stevenson, Your Excellencies, Jentlemen, there is so much<br />
more that one could say, but you will want to listen to Harold<br />
Holt, our Guest of Honour. I am . oing presently to invite I'r.<br />
Hugh ;. att, the Deputy Leader of te Opposition, to join me in<br />
this welcome before I propose the toast to our Juest of Honour.<br />
All I can say is that on your behalf those of you gathered<br />
here: and this Harold, is a very good cross-section of all of<br />
our people, so I know I can speak on uehalf of all our people when<br />
I say to you that I cannot think of anybody who could possibly be<br />
more warmly welcomed here in lellington and in New Zealand you<br />
and your wife. May you feel this in the few days you are here:, </p>
<p>-3-<br />
may you feel this warmth of friendship exuding and reaching out<br />
towards you. May you, as a result of th: t, take awa very happy<br />
memories, deep memories, of the fondness o the people of iew<br />
Zealand for yourself, your wife, and the people of ustralia<br />
generally. You are just exactly a thousand times welcome here in<br />
. ellin-ton and New Zealand. Now I invite Mr. Hugh . i'att to join<br />
me in this welcome. H--1 </p>
