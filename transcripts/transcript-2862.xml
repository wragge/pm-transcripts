JOINT COMMUNI UE AT CLOSE OF VISIT<br />
BY YUGOSLAV PRIME MINISTER TO AUSTRALIA<br />
The Prime Minister of Yugoslavia accompanied by Mrs<br />
Bijedic and a party of senior advisers, visited Australia<br />
between 20 and 22 March at the invitation of the Australian<br />
Government for discussions with the Prime Minister of<br />
Australia. The Minister of the Yugoslav Government for<br />
economic matters, Dr Ludviger, also had discussions with<br />
senior officials of the Department of Overseas Trade and<br />
the Treasury. Further discussions were held by the<br />
Yugoslav Deputy Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Mr Petric,<br />
with the Minister of State, Senator Willesee and senior<br />
officials of the Departments of Foreign Affairs and the<br />
Attorney-General.<br />
The discussions took place in a warm and friendly<br />
atmosphere and covered the main features of Yugoslav and<br />
Australian thinking on foreign policy matters. Matters<br />
of common concern in bilateral relations between Yugoslavia<br />
and Australia were also discussed.<br />
International Questions<br />
Reviewing the international scene the two Prime<br />
Ministers welcomed the existence of positive processes<br />
which had led to growing detente among the major Powers<br />
and to attempts to find solutions to problems through<br />
negotiation and agreement. At the same time, however,<br />
the two leaders recognised that there were still areas of<br />
potential conflict which gave rise to anxiety.<br />
The two Prime Ministers welcomed the conclusion of<br />
cease fire agreements in Viet-Nam and Laos, and emphasised 2.. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
the necessity for all parties to the agreements to abide by<br />
their terms in order to achieve the objective of peace in<br />
Indo-China.<br />
In considering the situation on the Indian sub-continent<br />
the two Prime Ministers expressed the hope that there would<br />
be a speedy solution of all outstanding issues so as to<br />
establish lasting peace and security in this region.<br />
The two Prime Ministers expressed their concern about<br />
the situation in the Middle East and accepted that the terms<br />
of Security Council Resolution 242 of 22 November 1967<br />
offered the basis for a just and lasting settlement of this<br />
grave problem.<br />
Mr Bijedic informed Mr Whitlam of the present activities<br />
of the non-aligned countries and of the preparations for the<br />
Fourth Conference of Heads of State and Government of nonaligned<br />
countries, at which their further actions in the<br />
struggle for peace and security, development and democratisation<br />
of international relations will be considered.<br />
Australian interest in the work of these countries was<br />
expressed by the Prime Minister of Australia who saw value<br />
in closer Australian observation of such meetings.<br />
Both Prime Ministers laid stress upon the interests of<br />
their country within their own geographical neighbourhoods.<br />
The Prime Minister of Yugoslavia outlined his Government's<br />
thinking in relation to questions of European security and<br />
co-operation between European countries. The Prime<br />
Minister of Australia similarly stressed the great<br />
importance attached by his Government to co-operation with<br />
the countries of Asia and the Pacific. The Yugoslav<br />
delegation appreciated the willingness of the Australian<br />
Government to contribute actively to the development of<br />
co-operation among the countries of the region.<br />
Both Prime Ministers expressed their Governments'<br />
determination to work for the elimination of the remaining<br />
3.. </p>
<p>vestiges of colonialism. The Prime Minister of Australia<br />
outlined the progress that had been made in relation to<br />
Papua New Guinea which would shortly achieve selfgovernment<br />
and thereafter independence as soon as this was<br />
practicable. The two Prime Ministers also expressed their<br />
abhorrence of all manifestations of racial discrimination<br />
wherever they might occur and their determination to support<br />
efforts in the United Nations and elsewhere to eliminate<br />
remaining instances of inequality between peoples of<br />
Sdifferent colour.<br />
Both Prime Ministers stressed the importance they<br />
* attached to the role of the United Nations and agreed that<br />
their foreign policies would be conducted within the<br />
principles of the Charter of the United Nations. They also<br />
emphasised the importance of developing useful co-operation<br />
between the representatives of Yugoslavia and Australia in<br />
the United Nations and in other international organisations.<br />
The two Prime Ministers underlined the willingness of<br />
their respective countries to engage actively in constructive<br />
measures designed to reduce the economic gap between the<br />
developed and the developing countries. They agreed on the<br />
indispensability of equal participation of developing<br />
countries in the solution of the economic problems of the<br />
modern world.<br />
Bilateral Relations<br />
The two Prime Ministers reviewed the state of bilateral<br />
relations between Yugoslavia and Australia and agreed that<br />
there was scope for their further development to the mutual<br />
advantage of both countries.<br />
The Australian Prime Minister said that his Government<br />
was not satisfied that sufficient action had been taken in<br />
the past towards the detection, suppression and expulsion<br />
of extremists in Australia engaged in activities against<br />
Yugoslavia, and foreshadowed more vigorous action in the<br />
4.. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
future. The Yugoslav Prime Minister greatly welcomed this<br />
assurance of the Australian Government's intentions.<br />
In the field of economic relations, both sides expressed<br />
their desire to develop trade in both directions, as well as<br />
to promote other ways of achieving economic co-operation.<br />
The Yugoslav side informed the Australian side about the<br />
Yugoslav economic system and principles of functioning of<br />
the Yugoslav free market economy. The need to increase<br />
Yugoslav exports to Australia was pointed out, and the<br />
Australian side expressed its readiness to consider the<br />
creation of the necessary conditions to that end.<br />
The Yugoslav Prime Minister, on behalf of his wife and<br />
all the members of his delegation, as well as on his own<br />
behalf, expressed the warmest gratitude for the extremely<br />
friendly reception and hospitality extended by the Australian<br />
Government during his visit.<br />
The Prime Minister of Yugoslavia invited the Prime<br />
Minister of Australia to visit Yugoslavia. The invitation<br />
was accepted with pleasure. A </p>
