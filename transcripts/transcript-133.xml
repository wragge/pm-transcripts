SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
R. G. MENZIES AT DINNER IN HONOUR OF THE<br />
DELE GATES TO THE COIM'MONWEPL TH PARLIAMENTARY<br />
ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE CANBERRA, 2ND<br />
NOVEMBER, 1359<br />
Sir, we have all this rather neatly worked out; I begin<br />
by saying Mr Chairman, Your Grace, My Lords, Your Excellencies,<br />
and Ladies and Gentlemen a form of address which I find<br />
rather tedious because it always reminds me of the fact that in<br />
London when this happens the announcement is made by a gentleman<br />
in a red coat, and one gentleman in a red coat, a very highly<br />
priced one because he was always employed, came across to me one<br />
night when I had made an almost intolerable number of speeches<br />
under these rather melancholy circumstances, and at the last<br />
moment before dinner, saying " My Lords," 1 right down to " Justices<br />
of the Peace" you know what I mean. He said to me, in a fine<br />
Scots voice, which had not been obvious up to that time, " Excuse<br />
me, Sir, but will I announce yer as ' Menzies', or by your proper<br />
name?". In consequence, I was introduced as " lMingies" which,<br />
mark you, is quite right and I don't care who denies it.<br />
Sir, this is my third innings. I had the opportunity<br />
of a very brief and not adequately alcoholic contact with Learie<br />
Constantine before dinner; he is a great cricketer and I am a<br />
great fan is that the word? But in that game you don't get a<br />
third innings except in the newspapers, and I am not going to<br />
assert myself peace to our American friends for getting into<br />
the baseball game; and therefore here I am, third time up.<br />
What I find very hard about this matter is that it is very<br />
difficult. VWhat can one say?<br />
The first thing I want to say to you, of course, is<br />
in spite of evidence to the contrary that we are all the<br />
same; that I think, is the most interesting thing about us.<br />
4~ e are all the same. 1We are all men and women of Parliament<br />
and if'I may forget the stronger sex for the moment, we are all<br />
Parliament men here tonight. This is a great bond of unity and<br />
yett of course, Sir, at the same time we are all different.<br />
That, I think, is something that we have to learn to live with<br />
we are different. 4Je are all different races, we are all of<br />
different religions, we all have different histories and different<br />
backgrounds and yes, if you wanted to dwell on<br />
differences you could find a whole universe of difference between<br />
us who sit down here together as friends tonight. In<br />
point of fact, every one of us here tonight is different. I<br />
find that there are not too many people who have come to understand<br />
that every man lives in a different world. That is rather<br />
an interesting reflection, I think.<br />
I was born in the bush, not long before a drought<br />
year, and I nwer hear rain falling on the roof particularly<br />
on a tin roof without feeling a surge of joy through me that<br />
no man born in a city could ever understand. Somebody else born<br />
a week later in another place is born into another world. This<br />
is so profoundly true that it ought to restrain us from being<br />
dogmatic. Every one of us is born into a different 4iorld, has<br />
different early memories and has a different setting in the<br />
community. I find that a wonderful and an exhilarating thing.<br />
So here we are tonight, all the same as people of<br />
Parliament, all different, every one of us, by reason of our<br />
birth and our upbringing and our early experiences and all the<br />
things that have impacted on us in the course of our life. And<br />
that after all, Sir, is the great thing about this magnificent<br />
Association. Here we are, what 200 of us? all different;<br />
not one of us can put himself or herself inside the experience<br />
of another all different people, all with our own memories<br />
and our own hopes, our own despairs, our own vanities, our own </p>
<p>a, 2,<br />
follies and our own frail-.., all different and yet we meet<br />
here as one group of people united by a common bond because we<br />
are all people of Parliament, and Parliament though the word<br />
has a sort of dubious Norman-French derivation is one of the<br />
great words in modern history.<br />
Sirthere is another thing that I would like to say:<br />
many years ago so many that I read the book as a student<br />
Lord Bryce wrote a book on the Amnerican Commonwealth many of<br />
you will recall it and he said a profoundly true thing about<br />
all systems of federation, 4e have a federal system in<br />
Australia; there are others in the world. The Commonwealth<br />
Parliamentary Association does not call itself a federation,<br />
but those are in common with it, arc! Bryce writing about the<br />
American Federation, about one of trio grcat things that must<br />
always be remembered, 3aid that in every federal system there<br />
are two forces of opposite kinds always operating one,<br />
centrifugal, one centripotal and therefore in a federation<br />
power will tend to aggregate itself at the centre or it will<br />
tend to disperse itself to the perimeter,<br />
This is a great problem, and I think that anybody who<br />
observes federation in the modern world would agree with me that<br />
the centrifugal force has been the greater, that more and more<br />
and more as time has gone on there has been an aggregation of<br />
power at the centre, And the same kind of conflict, the same<br />
kind of issue exists in the international i'orld, and it is in<br />
the international world that we are tonight most vitally concerned.<br />
It is a romarkable thing that, internationally, two<br />
things have been going on one centrifugal, one centripetal<br />
and perhaps we have not observed them as much as we might have<br />
done. Let me say, as I understand it, what they are.<br />
Since this last war in particular there has been a<br />
tremendous resurgence of national feeling the struggle for<br />
independence, the assertion; the very proper assertion of<br />
national prestige and right and self-government. That has gone<br />
on and somebody looking at it may very well say how odd it is<br />
that after a war which was, in a sunse, fought to produce some<br />
kind of international and co-ordinated order, we have had<br />
country after country after country asserting and claiming and<br />
achieving its national independence. There are scores of<br />
people here tonight who represent such countries and are proud<br />
to represent such countries; think of them! You have only to<br />
go back for ten years to see country after country after<br />
country asserting and obtaining its independence, and some<br />
onlooker may very well say " Well, that is a dispersing effort";<br />
this is something that is centrifugal. Ie are going to have a<br />
world in which there are scores of countries each one with no<br />
connection with the country next door, each one living its own<br />
life, living separately its own existence; and yet at the same<br />
time and this is the glory of it the other forces have been<br />
at work and the glorious paradox of the last ten years is that<br />
the more countries who were once mombers of the British anpire<br />
who are today independent, poworful, self-respecting countries<br />
conducting their own affairs the more of those we have had<br />
the more they have come together for comnon purposes. This,<br />
Sir, is at one and the same time the expansion, the separateism,<br />
the fragmentation if you like of an old world and the regrouping<br />
of an old world with honour and self-respect for<br />
common purposes a groat paradox, if you like, and a glorious<br />
paradox as I believe.<br />
Every now and then some clever young man will sit down<br />
and write a book that happens, I am told. And every clover<br />
young man who sits down to write a book discovers that silly old<br />
fools like me were always wrong. That is all right, because the<br />
great comfort is that twenty years afterwards another clover </p>
<p>young man will sit down to write a book to prove that the first<br />
was wrong and that I was rather a great fellow. Therefore it<br />
works itself out. Every time I am tempted in my own heart or<br />
in my own mind to engage in theories about the Commonwealth,<br />
I was going to say our Commonwealth, I find that theories don't<br />
matter, that the fact is that we may argue till Kingdom come.<br />
Ide may disagree about all sorts of things but we all come within<br />
the same tradition whether the tradition is in one country or<br />
another the same tradition of honest self-government, Cf<br />
Parliament, of the rule of law, and all these things that mean<br />
so much to every one of us, and bccause we do come out of that<br />
background then I am quite prepared and you are all quite<br />
prupared to sit down one with the other and remember that<br />
underneath all this extraordinary diversity what the outsider<br />
may regard as separate-ism we are in reality one people because<br />
we think just the same way about all the matters that come<br />
in the world of froe men and of free women. And therefore I<br />
pronounce the paradox it is a paradox. I rejoice in the<br />
paradox, and because I know that you rejoice in it, I have the<br />
greatest pleasure in the world in proposing the health for such<br />
of my Australian customers as are here tonight, in asking them<br />
to stand up with me, which they will with great goodwill after<br />
I have called on Dr. Evatt, of course to drink the health of<br />
our distinguished visitors.<br />
Now, having said that, I am going to sit down. Dr.<br />
Evatt is having a very, very bad weekend; this will be the<br />
second time this weekend that he has had to agree with me but<br />
if I may anticipate what he is going to say, I think he will<br />
agree with me now, as thcr in the most warm-hearted and wholehearted<br />
fashion. I hn' 6Itc1rA1 </p>
