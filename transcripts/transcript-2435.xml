FOR PRESS: PM NO. 64/ 1971<br />
NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLES ON VIETNAM<br />
Statement by III _ Prime Minister, Mr. William McMahon<br />
Following a series of disclosures in the New York Times of confidential<br />
documents belonging to the American Government relating to Vietnam, statements have<br />
been made concerning the commitment in 1965 of Australian troops to fight in Vietnam.<br />
Many of these have been irresponsible and4 obviously politically motivated.<br />
Much controversy has centred on the question of whether or not the Australian<br />
Government had been requested by the South Vietnamese Government to supply military<br />
assistance. It will be clear from what follows that t~ l-e appropriate request was in fact<br />
made and that we did not intend to act unless such a request was made.<br />
Statements to the contrary are demonstrably false.<br />
The matter was referred to the Defence Committee which asked the Secretaries<br />
of the Departments of Foreign Affairs, the Prime Minister and Cabinet and Defence to<br />
study the relevant documents and report to me.<br />
They have been assisted by the officer who was Australian Ambassador to South<br />
Vietnam at the time the commitment was made and who handled personally, in Saigon,<br />
the exchange of letters following which the combat forces were sent.<br />
It is clear from this study that the Government of t he day acted with complete<br />
propriety throughout the events leading to the commitment of a battalion to Vietnam and<br />
that it faithfully and honestly informed the public of the decisions it had made and the<br />
basis on which they were made.<br />
The Prime Minister of the day, Sir Robert Menzies, has already made a public<br />
statement which, in th e clearest terms, rejects the charges made against his Government<br />
and himself. I confirm the accuracy of his statement.<br />
Australia's actions at that time must be seen in perspective and in the context<br />
of the worsening situation in South-East Asia.<br />
As I said in a television interview on 18 June, we were in South Vietnam because<br />
we felt there was a real danger at that time of the whole of South-East Asia falling to<br />
communism. We joined with our friends and allies, the United States, to resist the<br />
threat. We wanted the smaller countries of Asia to be able to determine their own future.<br />
It will be remembered too, that this was the period of " confrontation" between<br />
Sukarno's Indonesia and Malaysia, and that Australian forces were already involved in<br />
Malaysia. In South Vietnam the military and political situation was close to collapse. North<br />
Vietnamese infiltration had increased substantially and there was clear evidence of the<br />
presence in~ the South of formed units of the North Vietnamese regular forces. 9 0 0 0 / 2 </p>
<p>The question of sending a battalion to South Vietnam was under discussion by<br />
the Government from December 1964 until the commitment was announced on 29 April 1965.<br />
During this period, the Government was in close and continuing communication<br />
with the United States.<br />
Whilst there was a broad identity of view on the gravity of the situation, the<br />
decisions taken by the Government during this period were firmly based on its own<br />
independent assessments of our national interests.<br />
The Government was considering a significant enlargement of our assistance<br />
to South Vietnam which at that stage consisted of a team of military adviser" and a<br />
flight of RAAF transport aircraft. Our own interests were deeply involved. We had a<br />
direct interest in the security of . South Vietnam and we had then, as now, obligations<br />
under the South-East Asia Treaty.<br />
The Defence Committee and the Chiefs of Staff Committee had each made a<br />
close study of what further action Australia could take.<br />
At all stages in the Government's consideration it was known and accepted that<br />
if combat troops were offered and were to be sent they would go only " at the invitation<br />
or with the consent of" South Vietnam. This was required under article IV of the<br />
South-East Asia Treaty to which we were a party.<br />
This was not, as some want to present it, a matter being considered for the<br />
first time on the eve of our announcement of a commitment. It was basic throughout.<br />
It should be remembered that in July 1964 the Prime Minister of South Vietnam,<br />
then Major-General Nguyen Khanh, in a published letter addressed to the Heads of State<br />
of 34 countries, including Australia, had appealed for " all the support you deem possible<br />
arid opportune in order to help us successfully fight the communist aggression".<br />
And as I have pointed out on another occasion, the Prime Minister of South<br />
Vietnam, Mr. Tran Van Huong, in December 1964 in discussion with the Australian<br />
Minister for Air, then visiting Vietnam, and the Australian Ambassador, asked for an<br />
increased Australian military contribution.<br />
Mr. Huong said the situation was now such that large scale assistance was<br />
urgently needed from all free nations " in every form but particularly military".<br />
On 29 April there was an exchange of letters between the Australian Ambassador<br />
and the Prime Minister of South Vietnam.<br />
In these letters, the Australian Government offered to send a battalion if one<br />
were requested, and the South Vietnamese Government accepted this offer and made its<br />
request in terms conforming with the requirements of the South-East Asia Treaty.<br />
Sir Robert Menzies, then Prime Minister, made a statement in the House<br />
of Representatives on the same day.<br />
He said we had received this request and that a battalion would be provided<br />
for service in Soitth Vietnam. </p>
