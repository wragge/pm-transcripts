PRIME MINISTERJ<br />
FOR MEDIA 19 may 1987<br />
The Government has previously voiced concern about the<br />
nature and direction of Libyan activities in the South<br />
Pacific region. Some of these activities have been<br />
conducted openly, others many others with varying<br />
degrees of clandestinity. They have become more intense in<br />
the course of this year.<br />
There is no plausible explanation in terms of geography or<br />
legitimate national interest for Libyan activity in this<br />
region, as the Foreign minister and I have both noted in<br />
Parliament and elsewhere.<br />
We have rapeatedly been assured that Libya seeks normal<br />
relations with the countries of the region. Yet Colonel<br />
Gaddafi urges Pacific islanders to join a " single front<br />
which stretches from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic<br />
Ocean", to " stage a revolution", to " fight to the end".<br />
Libyan organisations have sponsored so-called Pacific<br />
meetingjs in Libya which have no constructive contribution to<br />
make to the well-being of the peoples of the South Pacific.<br />
And Libyan representatives offer funds to individuals and<br />
organisations for destabilising political purposes; arrange<br />
training in the techniques of propaganda, agitation and<br />
guerilla work; use contacts in one country to develop<br />
destabilising networks of contact and influence in others.<br />
Libya's record of subversion and terrorism elsewhere in the<br />
world juctifies the gravest concern.<br />
We have stated repeatedly, and I say it again now, that we<br />
respect the sovereign right of Pacific island countries to<br />
establish relations with whatever countries the-y choose.<br />
Australia does not seek in any way to interfere in any<br />
aspect of their domestic or foreign policy. It is for our<br />
Pacific neighbours to make their own decisions in the light<br />
of their national interests.<br />
But Australia has national interests of its own and a vital<br />
concern for peace, harmony and stability in the South<br />
Pacific. We are only too conscious of the instability<br />
already existing in the region in New Caledonia and most<br />
recently and sadly in Fiji and do not welcome a further<br />
element. The Government has made its concerns about these matters<br />
known to our P acific friends and neighbours as part of the<br />
constant process of consultation it maintains with them. it<br />
has explained frankly and fully its particular concerns<br />
about Libyan activities, and their likely impact on the<br />
region. </p>
<p>The Government has also carefully reviewed Australia's<br />
relations with Libya in the light of the pattern of Libyan<br />
activity in the South Pacific region, including that within<br />
Australia itself. I note that, despite the care with which<br />
Libyan activitieo are monitored, Libya has begun to intrude<br />
into our domestic affairs too, causing dissension and<br />
confrontation among communities, something of deep concern<br />
to all Australians, whatever their cultural background.<br />
In this context of both regional and domestic concern about<br />
the increasingly disruptive activities of Libya, the<br />
Government has concluded that a continuing official Libyan<br />
presence in Australia serves no Australian interest or<br />
purpose, and, indeed, is serving to facilitate Libya's<br />
destabilising activities. The decision the Government has<br />
taken serves to underline the importance it attaches to the<br />
maintenance and development of the closest possible<br />
understanding with our regional partners on matters of such<br />
grave common concern. It gives further strength to our firm<br />
views about the dangers Libyan activities bring to the<br />
region. The Secretary of the Libyan People's Bureau has today been<br />
instructed to close the Bureau forthwith and to leave<br />
Australia within ten days. His assistant is to leave within<br />
three week. </p>
