FLL<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 24 APRIL, 1980<br />
PAINTERS AND DOCKERS' UNION<br />
I have written today to the Premier of Victoria proposing<br />
the establishment of a joint Royal Commission by the<br />
Commonwealth and Victorian Governments to investigate<br />
allegations of* illegal activities by members of the<br />
Federated Ship Painters and Dockers' Union.<br />
I have also proposed the establishment of a joint police<br />
task force,-comprising members of the Australian Federal<br />
Police and the Victoria Police, to investigate concurrently<br />
allegations of illegal activities involving the painters<br />
and dockers.<br />
If the Victorian Government agrees with our proposals,<br />
questions relating to the choice of a Royal Commissioner<br />
and the terms of reference for the Royal Commission will<br />
need to be discussed by representatives of the two Governments.<br />
I would not expect these preliminary discussions to take<br />
much time.<br />
The allegations against members of the Union which have<br />
been reported in the media are grave, and are worthy of<br />
the most thorough investigation. For its pa~-t the<br />
Commonwealth intends that this shall be done.<br />
Certain allegations are already being looked into by the<br />
Australian Federal Police and by the Victoria Police so far<br />
as they may involve of fences against Commonwealth and State<br />
laws respectively.<br />
We believe that a joint police task force, working<br />
concurrently with a joint Royal Commission, is the best<br />
method available to us of ascertaining the degree of truth<br />
in the allegations which have been made.<br />
