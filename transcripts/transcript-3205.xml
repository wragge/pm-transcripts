Press Statement No. 216<br />
April 1974<br />
INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE COMMISSION TO REPORT ON<br />
RURAL RESEARCH AND PROMOTION<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that he had forwarded<br />
two references to the Industries Assistance Commission on the<br />
question of Australian Government assistance in financing rural<br />
research and the promotion of rural products.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that the references were in accordance<br />
with the statement made by Dr. Patterson as the Minister representing<br />
the Minister for Primary Industry, when introducing the Wool Industry<br />
Bill 1974 on 14 March 1974, to provide for financing wool research<br />
and promotion during the three years beginning with the year 1974/ 75.<br />
The Government has decided to ask the Commission to report on rural<br />
research and promotion generally before the announced three year wool<br />
promotion scheme expires in 1976/ 77. The Government's policy in<br />
relation to the continuation of wool research and promotion beyond<br />
June 1977 will be determined in the light of the report of the<br />
Commission. Mr. Whitlam said that expenditure by the Government on rural<br />
promotion. in 1973/ 74 will be about $ 15.7 million on wool and about<br />
$ 1.2 million on promotion overseas of meat, dairy products, apples<br />
and pears, canned fruit, dried vine fruits, eggs, wine and honey.<br />
Expenditure on wool research alone in 1973/ 74 was expected to be<br />
about $ 6 million.<br />
The Commission has been asked whether funds should continue to<br />
be provided by the Australian Government to finance, or assist in<br />
financing rural research and promotion of rural products ( including<br />
processed products) and, if so:-<br />
What should be the nature and extent of the<br />
assistance provided by the Australian Government, and<br />
What criteria should be used in determining and<br />
apportioning such expenditure.<br />
For the purposes of both inquiries, fisheries and fisheries<br />
products have been included within the scope of the references.<br />
