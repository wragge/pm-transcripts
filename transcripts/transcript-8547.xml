TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RON P 0 KEATING, HP<br />
ADDRESS TO THE ' NEW INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION -YOUR BUSINESS IN<br />
THE ' 908 SEMINAR', BANKSTOWN* 17 JUNE 1992<br />
R OK PROOF COPY<br />
can I say I amn very pleased to be invited to speak to you<br />
about the subjects which flEET specialises in. And can I<br />
again firstly congratulate DEEtT on holding this discussion<br />
meeting and I'm particularly pleased to be talking to you in<br />
Bankstown. It's always good to come back to the old town<br />
and to be talking about issues which are relevant to people<br />
and the way they live and how they'll work and what they'll<br />
do in the future.<br />
We are going through a very large Industrial transition and<br />
the fact that a meeting like this is taking place is itself<br />
a revelation because many years ago the whole notion of<br />
training was simply trade training, apprentices,<br />
apprenticeships and what have you and the comprehension of<br />
many areas of business, the importance of education and<br />
training was, not so many years ago, comparatively low.<br />
In the early 19809 we had three children in ten completing<br />
secondary school and one of the things that the government<br />
wanted to do and has done over the period is to increase the<br />
participation rate of kids in school.<br />
That is now nearly eight in ten, three in ten in the early<br />
19809 to nearly eight in ten now, is one of the basic things<br />
one had to do to improve the skills base of Australia. And<br />
if we are to be indeed a clever country or a capable<br />
country, a clever and capable country, then education and<br />
training are of course, the keystones of such capability.<br />
All this comes from the great roll back of protection under<br />
which Australia existed in most of the postwar years, and<br />
began with the removal of exchange controls in 1983, with<br />
the float of the Australian dollar and then more latterly<br />
general changes to the external orientation of Australia<br />
reductions in border protections, reduction in tariffs,<br />
opening Australia up to competition and getting the focus<br />
onto productivity, lower costs, lower inflation, import<br />
competition, exports and a better current account<br />
performance and with it more jobs, more interesting jobs and<br />
better paid jobs. </p>
<p>We came through the 19809 with a growth strategy built<br />
around those particular ideals. And we had a lot of<br />
success. We had a lot of growth in the 1980s and we had a<br />
lot of employment growth. We started of f with a work force<br />
of six million and we ended up with a work force of 7.8<br />
million which is nearly 30 per cent larger. We've lost now<br />
in the recession unfortunately, 300,000 of those jobs but we<br />
still held 1.5 million which means the workforce today is<br />
about 25 per cent larger than it was in 1983, built around<br />
the objectives of growth and lower costs and growth<br />
efficiencies. Now we have come a long way, and I think Australia has<br />
crossed the rubicon where now the country does look to be<br />
Competitive. The whole notion of competitiveness is not<br />
something which is just a lip servicie -thing but-omething<br />
people mean. As well as that we've crossed a rubicon whore<br />
we are now interested in exports and imports competition in<br />
a way we were never interested before. One can see in this<br />
period of recession we're emerging from now that the growth<br />
which does obtain in the economy, a large part of it in<br />
coming from the export markets or net exports, import<br />
competition and exports. So it's holding up production and<br />
employment. Whereas if we had a focus simply upon domestic<br />
demand that wouldn't be the case.<br />
I think now a lot of industrial companies who are now<br />
exporting will continue to export when domestic demand picks<br />
up. That is they won't say well look, the export market was<br />
handy when were in a bit of a squeeze and we've got an<br />
exportable surplus and is there someone to take it yes<br />
there is, good, we'll let them have it, but now that<br />
domestic demand Is up we won't bother any more.<br />
I think many companies are now finding a great success with<br />
exports, they're finding markets and they're finding them in<br />
the Asia-Pacific, they're finding them close to Australia,<br />
they're finding them in the area of the world economy which<br />
is growing the fastest and the Strongest which is the Asia-<br />
Pacific. This discovery if you like, by Australian<br />
companies of these markets to our north and north Asia as<br />
well, has I think, produced a cultural change which is going<br />
to stand us in good stead.<br />
The other great cultural change is the purging of<br />
inflationary sentiment from the Australian economy. This<br />
was the thing, of course, we could never seem to be able to<br />
do. For nearly twenty years we had high inflation and<br />
despite persistent attempts by all sorts of governments it<br />
could never be conquered. It has been conquered now by<br />
commitment on the part of organised labour and the<br />
government and more latterly the deflationary influence of<br />
the recession which has pulled inflation down, but the<br />
important thing is it's stripping the culture, it's purging<br />
the culture of Australia that people could do unproductive </p>
<p>things, do speculative things and try to seek from thoue<br />
speculative things real increments to wealth and employment.<br />
I think we have crossed a very important rubicon. And I<br />
don't know whether some of you might have noticed Weutpaa<br />
taking a $ 2.6 billion hit on its accounts a couple of weeks<br />
ago. In doing so it was basically saying, I think in a very<br />
mature decision, look we won't moon around waiting for<br />
inflation to pick property prices up, we won't do as we've<br />
normally done, sat back and waited for a bit of inflation to<br />
correct yesterday's decisions, we're now in a low<br />
inflationary environment, let's basically reoognise it,<br />
let's cut the ' 808 adrift and let's take our medicine on the<br />
chin and go on and build our business. That was a pretty<br />
hard thing for them to do, they've got to approach the<br />
market again, they've got to get stock which dilutes the<br />
rest of the stock in the business, to make the key decision<br />
that they were not going to mess around with inflation any<br />
longer.<br />
That means that that institution and many others are now<br />
going to look at productive investment. And the culture of<br />
Australia is shifting away from speculation and passive<br />
investment, mooning around waiting for inflation to reappear<br />
so that those with assets can end up being more wealthy than<br />
those without them and to transfer from the poor to the<br />
wealthy by way of inflation. That culture is dying and the<br />
culture that has come in its place is one of productivity,<br />
of production where our focus is on adding value, employing<br />
people and looking at businesses which produce goods and<br />
services. Now that's a mighty change for a country which was taught to<br />
believe that it was a lucky country, that it could do<br />
unsmart things, that it could lock itself up behind a tariff<br />
wall, that it could only educate three children in ten<br />
beyond secondary school, that it could speculate its head<br />
of f with double digit inflation rates, that the wealthy<br />
could grow wealthier and the poor could go poorer, so that<br />
young people would start with very big mortgages around<br />
their necks paying for inflated values in property and that<br />
the elderly would have their savings ripped to bits by<br />
inflation. This was the sort of culture that this<br />
government inherited in 1983. As you know by then, the<br />
current account deficit in 1980 was already 6 per cent of<br />
GDP. Already twelve years ago we could not pay for our<br />
imports to the tune of 6 per cent of GDP a year. Now GDP<br />
this year is $ 400 billion, 6 per cent is about $ 24 billion,<br />
so we were $ 24 billion shy of balancing our trade accounts<br />
twelve years ago.<br />
Those who look for the resources boom twelve years ago, the<br />
so called ' 80. resources boom, it was not a boom in reality,<br />
it didn't answer the questions, and the real resources we<br />
should have had burning were the intellectual abilities of </p>
<p>our people and of our children. They were the resources We<br />
didn't worry about while we believed digging up another<br />
mound of rocks and growing another paddock full of wheat was<br />
all that was needed to be done so that the People in the<br />
lucky country could go on in their torpor, in their mental<br />
fog, not facing the real world outside and understanding the<br />
simple fact that the post-war trade in goods and' services<br />
had passed Australia by. That the policies of the Country<br />
Party and Coalition governments preaching free enterprise on<br />
the one hand and dolloping out dollops of tariff protection<br />
and bounties end subsidies on the other, while seeking to<br />
have an efficient primary export sector, wasn just a<br />
dichotomy of policy that was bound to fail.<br />
So in the change we've gone through, these important<br />
psychological shifts, and as we had to move down aggregate<br />
wages and rechange the level, that is restore the levels of<br />
national income going to wages and profits and the ' 80s as a<br />
result of the mad-wage mayhem of 1979 and 1980, the wage<br />
share in CDP warn too high and the profit share in GDP was<br />
too low and therefore profits fell and investment fell with<br />
it, and when investment fell employment fell.<br />
In the first seven years between 1983 and 1990 we had five<br />
times as much employment growth as the last seven years of<br />
the Fraser government five fold, because we got back to<br />
rates of economic growth which could take people up out of<br />
the workforce. That change of focus-, to going back to<br />
fundamentals and being competitive, to letting the exchange<br />
rate find its right level, living with the inflationary<br />
consequences coming from it, then buying down wages so that<br />
that inflationary surge was taken out of wages and then<br />
through five Accords with the ACTU, build ourselves an<br />
inflation rate down to two or three per cent, is a great<br />
national achievement. It means that after the great shift<br />
in aggregate wages we had to get around the wage<br />
flexibility. Because between 1983 and about 1988-89 we did<br />
succeed in getting aggregate wage flexibility, we did<br />
succeed in lifting the profit share and we lifted investment<br />
with it.<br />
The problem about aggregate wage flexibility is that one<br />
builds pressures within groupings of employees for what they<br />
think is salary justice which can't be provided by a system<br />
of-rigid aggregate adjustment. So we then started looking<br />
in Accords Marks V and VI for flexibility, productivity<br />
based flexibility which started with a 4 per cent case under<br />
Accord Mark V where 4 per cent was paid on productivity<br />
adjustments, not that everybody took the productivity<br />
adjustment opportunity up, and then in Accord Mark VI which<br />
the ACTU concluded with the government just at the beginning<br />
of the 1990 election, we moved then to the first time into<br />
enterprise bargaining. And while we were doing that, moved<br />
into a system of fewer unions, larger unions and more of an </p>
<p>industry union structure which could more accommodate the<br />
shifts In fortunes of particular industry.<br />
Now many of you know that enterprise bargaining has had a<br />
pretty hard road to hoe, the Abtiiioziuionl told us<br />
in the first instance we were not mature enough to handle<br />
it, that if they weren't checking everybody's industrial<br />
agreement then it wasn't worth having, and as everyone of<br />
you running a business knows, if you're going to increase<br />
the productivity of your business by changing the way in<br />
which you operate it and the way in which your employees<br />
operate within it, that can't be done through a central<br />
bench in Melbourne, 0 it can only be done at the enterprise<br />
level. That's why it was Incompatible to have the<br />
Industrial Relations Commission vetting enterprise<br />
agreements-and because the government and the ACTU took the<br />
view they shouldn't be vetting them, they thought we were<br />
perhaps not mature enough to have them.<br />
As it is, the ACTU stood the Commission up and the result<br />
was that in the reconsidering of these things, enterprise<br />
bargaining is now a possibility and the great productivity<br />
opportunities are there. I've never known a time when<br />
unions have been more prepared to find wage increases from<br />
genuine improvements in productivity an in these last few<br />
years and particularly now.<br />
But what went hand in hand with enterprise bargaining was<br />
award restructuring. The problem we have with the award<br />
system, the whole problem that we've had with the labour<br />
market in Australia generally was that we inherited the<br />
British craft union structure of industrial orgenisation.<br />
There was no General Macarthur here, sweeping the system out<br />
and building a new system and there was no General George<br />
Marshall. So after the war we were left with what we began<br />
with a system built on the craft structure and within the<br />
Craft structure we had this very rigid awards system. So if<br />
you got yourself to a place as a tradesman or a particular<br />
worker and you secured a spot in that particular scale of<br />
classification that was your spot for life. The only<br />
negotiations that ever matter to you were whether you got a<br />
national wage adjustment and if you worked a bit of<br />
overtime. The notion of moving out of that rigid system and<br />
retraining themselves into a multi-skilled position was<br />
something which of course, was alien to the craft based<br />
Oystem.<br />
So to create a better market for labour, what the government<br />
has sought to do is to move away from the rigidities of that<br />
craft union structure to one where we're looking at. We're<br />
looking at either enterprise agreements between employees,<br />
unions and employers or we're looking at much more of an<br />
industry based model. And in an industry based model one<br />
can take account of different levels of prosperity and<br />
different requirements </p>
<p>and imperatives for change. The employees of an industry<br />
can respond accordingly.<br />
So award restructuring is producing fewer but larger<br />
categories of multi-skilled persons and the opportunity of<br />
training and moving through those categories is now an<br />
opportunity available to people where they can, if they<br />
wish, do more things and do them productively, more<br />
efficiently, earn more money and actually produce lower<br />
coats for business.<br />
So there has been a great change from a multiplicity of<br />
unions down to 8 smaller number of larger unions, much more<br />
industry based, and an enterprise arrangement between unions<br />
and companies f or enterprise agreements about the way in<br />
which they function and beyond that award restructuring to a<br />
system which takes much more account of productivity in the<br />
business and of course, in the economy in general.<br />
This ha. always been the argument we've had with the<br />
Coalition. What John Howard tried to do in 1980 was pretend<br />
there was no craft structure so if you turned your back on<br />
it you deregulated it. Well of course, he turned his back<br />
on it and wages went to 16 per cent that year and the<br />
inflation % ate went to 12. You can't deregulate, you could<br />
never turn your back on that system, you had to change it<br />
and that's what we've sought to do. Change the way in which<br />
it works and get down to a much more flexible labour market.<br />
So that national wage cases will now look after basically<br />
the low paid who are not in positions where obvious<br />
improvements in productivity are available, where their<br />
bargaining power is weak, but most other people will secure<br />
wage increases through enterprise bargaining and lifting<br />
their skills and improving the opportunities within<br />
businesses. So much of that opportunity resides with managers. Whenever<br />
you see a well managed business you'll see generally a cost<br />
conscious, competitive business. Whenever you see good<br />
managemnent you'll mostly see good labour relations. I've<br />
never known an opportunity as now for the manager with a<br />
sharp eye and a keen sense of relations with employees to<br />
produce lower costs and make a business run more<br />
productively and more efficiently. So enterprise bargaining<br />
creates opportunities but it also creates greater challenges<br />
because it will sort the wheat from the chaff as far as<br />
managers are concerned and it will also do the same in terms<br />
of employees and their willingness to make a business tick.<br />
in the end it focuses on the ability of the business to<br />
prosper and that focus is what's important in getting those<br />
productivity agreements and improvements.<br />
The training which is part and parcel of award restructuring<br />
is taking place in the economy now, there is a much greater<br />
emphasis on training and the government is now seeking to </p>
<p>improve that emphasis further.<br />
Again, and let Me just say a few words about in the f irst<br />
instance, about tertiary levels. We've added since the<br />
middle 198s 120,000 places for universities. That in the<br />
equivalent of twelve universities of an average campus size<br />
of 10,000. That means that about 40 per cent of school<br />
leavers, 3S-40 par cent find places in universities. That's<br />
very high up the OECD average scale. We're just behind the<br />
United States and the Unites States are miles ahead of<br />
anybody else. So the growth path now, the trajectory for<br />
university places will naturally find its own level now that<br />
we've lifted the level so dramatically in the 19509. We've<br />
got that retention rate from three kids in ten to nearly<br />
eight in ten end about 35-40 per cent of them finding places<br />
in university.<br />
The next challenge is to improve vocational education and<br />
it's more the pity that we've never had really a national<br />
system of vocational education. Some of the TAFE systems<br />
around the Commonwealth are more efficient than others, some<br />
better reflect the requirements of the labour market, some<br />
understand better award restructuring and what all that<br />
means and making the country more clever and capable, some<br />
are more client driven than provider driven. But one thing<br />
we do know is as a system they are not fulfilling adequately<br />
their national charter.<br />
So at the Premiers Conference lost week I sought again, to<br />
try to bring together prospects of the development of a<br />
national system of TAFE, a national vocational and<br />
educational system. I think with a bit of good will and a<br />
bit of elbow grease in the right places we can do that, we<br />
can build a national vocational educational system.<br />
Not only is that important for education, cleverness, being<br />
capable and all the other things that I've talked about the<br />
country today, but it will be important to get that system<br />
working and to provide people that come through it with<br />
diplomas which have status in the community, which the TAFE<br />
system to this point has not ever really enjoyed and we can<br />
get to a system which is much more similar to the European<br />
vocational education systems, where a status of a diploma<br />
coming out of one of these institutions m~ eans more to<br />
employers. If you look at countries like Germany and<br />
companies like Mercedes Benz, Semens or BMW, the people who<br />
run those companies are basically people with diplomas from<br />
their TAFE system and not from their universities.<br />
That's the sort of TAFE system I think Australia should<br />
have. That will mean that 60 per cent of kids cascading out<br />
of secondary school are cascading into some form of training<br />
and it will mean that the sort of unskilled or low skilled<br />
jobs that most of us grew up with as kids are disappearing </p>
<p>these people will be taken up into more trained, more highly<br />
paid more interesting jobs. We did a lot of that in the<br />
19808, it's stopped for the moment with the recession anid<br />
with unemployment but as it resumes what we'll find Is that<br />
job opportunities will not be dead-end jobs but they'll be<br />
live-end jobs. Jobs which have training and skills about<br />
them anid which will provide more interesting jobs and better<br />
pay and conditions. So it In important therefore that the<br />
TAFE system fulfils its role and plays its role ini getting<br />
that focus back on education.<br />
Australia has about it many comparative advantages, but the<br />
more I go through Asia and other parts of the world the more<br />
I'm convinced that one of those is education and that you<br />
can't build a clever country or a capable country without<br />
it, you certainly couldn't do It with three kids in ten<br />
completing secondary school, you can't do It with a TAFE<br />
system that isn&amp;' t working properly, you can't Go it without<br />
that kind of national focus that I'm talking about.<br />
I think we do have a great chance not only to do it for<br />
ourselves but also to provide a service. That is, sell<br />
education services to the rest of the world and particularly<br />
to our near North, but more particularly to build our<br />
industrial base upon that sort of a skills base a truly<br />
clever and competent country. That means of course, a focus<br />
on research and development as well which must go hand in<br />
hand with training. And that's why the Commonwealth's<br />
contribution to research and development in this country is<br />
important so that we start to make up f or the fact the<br />
private sector of Australia Isn't spending a lot on research<br />
and development and hasn't traditionally. The Commonwealth<br />
in a number of ways will be doing that.<br />
Can I also say in TAPE one of the things we want to do is<br />
build specialist training institutes and we want to do more<br />
things with business. One of the great hang-ups in<br />
Australian education is that everybody interested in it<br />
wants to have a new building. The f irst thing they want Is<br />
a big mausoleum to make themselves feel important with,<br />
where in fact the place is strewn with schools, some of<br />
which are unoccupied as the demography changes and where we<br />
ought to be focussing on people rather than bricks and<br />
build ing institutions.<br />
One of the things I think we should do is in certain sectors<br />
of industry, where industry can play a much bigger role in<br />
training, the government and national TAFE training<br />
institutions get together and develop courses which are<br />
designed on a client-driven basis, in particular sectors of<br />
industry. And where industries predominate in certain<br />
suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne, in those pieces one could<br />
see a specialised thing. Up at Bankstown TAFE for instance<br />
there's an arrangement with Kaznbrook, the appliance<br />
manufacturer, and the Benkstown TAPE to do special things </p>
<p>there. In the northern suburbs of Melbournhe, recently I<br />
visited an automotive TAFE college which specialises in<br />
automotive&amp;. I visited, in the course of the sme period,<br />
two tyre factories in Melbourne which are now doing very<br />
competent things in technology but Can't find enough trained<br />
people. There is no reason why a TAFE Institute and the<br />
companies concerned couldn't put together a training<br />
regiment, courses for that industry and in areas of advanced<br />
manufacturing technology which are not being catered for<br />
often in technical and further education. I think there In<br />
also a case for specialist Institutes that focus on those<br />
advanced manufacturing technique.<br />
So I'd like to think that wee're not just building a national<br />
Institute of TAFE which has common denominator features<br />
about it, but we're also reserving the right to clever<br />
things but not necessarily In the building of business as so<br />
much focus as often been in the past. So TAFE is important.<br />
The other thing which I think is important also and we are<br />
talking about two things here, we're talking about the<br />
training of young people and we're talking about the<br />
retraining of older people, but youth unemployment is a<br />
problem and it's got to be dealt with. It's a problem that<br />
needs to be kept in perspective nevertheless. I notice some<br />
headlines the other day saying that 46 per cent of young<br />
people are unemployed. That's a distortion of, in fact, the<br />
position. Seven or eight out of ten young people are in<br />
education or in training. Two or three out of ten young<br />
people in the 15-19 year age group are actually in the<br />
workforce looking for work and about a third of those people<br />
are actually out of work, that's one in ten. So seven to<br />
eight in ten 15-19 year olds are in education and training,<br />
two to three in ten are actually in the workforce and one in<br />
ten is actually unemployed, that's 10 per cent of the age<br />
cohort 15-19 not 46 per cent. in fact there are 40,000<br />
fewer young people 15-19 unemployed today then there was in<br />
the 1982-83 recession.<br />
With that said It is still a problem and we have to deal<br />
with it and we're going to try and deal with it by looking<br />
at the whole question of entry level* training wages which<br />
was addressed by the Carmichael Report, Laurie Carmichael<br />
who you've known and read about in the Australian Vocational<br />
Certificate Training system. We're looking at a new<br />
vocational certificate training system with work-based<br />
training places in industry, where we've got the opportunity<br />
of taking many more young people up and at the same time<br />
giving themt training opportunities.<br />
So I think it is a very exciting prospect and one I'm<br />
focussing on now. And we're hoping to have a meeting with<br />
national employers and other people from various<br />
institutions in the next little while to see if we can focus<br />
on some of those problems and to see if we can do something </p>
<p>about streaming kids into work and training opportunities<br />
under that Australian Vocational Certificate Training<br />
system.<br />
That will help deal with that one in ten young person who<br />
doesn't have a job and to give them work experience and to<br />
give them training. So I think It is of course, obviously<br />
terribly important to us.<br />
Like many things you can't change everything over night. We<br />
started on higher participation rats back in the 1980s, we<br />
started lifting the places in tertiary institutions, we<br />
changed the way in which the tertiary system functions,<br />
we're now focussing on TATE and while all that's been on<br />
we've gone off aggregate wage movements to a more flexible<br />
labour market, to award restructuring to change the basis of<br />
the craft system to enterprise bargaining to lift<br />
ef ficiencies out of companies and give managers a chance of<br />
managing instead of being caught in simply a wage structure<br />
which drops out of an Arbitration Commission decision which<br />
takes no account of the capacity of business to produce, to<br />
make profits or to run. So the opportunity there for<br />
improvements in efficiency is quite profound.<br />
Now, let me just say a couple of things about our opponents<br />
while I'm at it. They have got two policies, one is to put<br />
a 15 per cent goods end services tax on everything. This<br />
will put 6 to 7 percentage points into. inflation and take<br />
the inflation rate from 1.7 per cent, where it now is, to<br />
around about 7 or 8 per cent. And with it the bill rates,<br />
now at 6. 5 per cent, will have the same 5 to 7 percentage<br />
points added to them and they will be going back to 13 or 14<br />
and then you will have all the add ons after that.<br />
They have no policy of wage discounts. They don't want to<br />
talk to the unions. They have no mechanism whatsoever of<br />
securing a wage discount for a consumption tax. A<br />
consumption tax is simply a device which will explode the<br />
national inflation rate and put us back where we were two<br />
decades ago with high levels of Inflation.<br />
And the reason I dropped the proposal in the middle 1980s is<br />
that I couldn't guarantee the wage discounts then, I didn't<br />
have the right to blow the national inflation rate to pieces<br />
anymore than John Howson has that right today. it won't remake<br />
Australia, it is just another tax. And another tax<br />
which will very heavily impede business, and I don't know<br />
whether many of you have read experiences from Britain or<br />
New Zealand, or any other countries with a goods and<br />
services tax, but the great burden of the goods and services<br />
tax in terms of compliance cost falls on small business.<br />
And it is the small business sector which will carry the<br />
great burden of this and the result is that most people Will<br />
spend the better part of one day per week accounting for the<br />
system and seeing that there is a responsibility beyond them </p>
<p>to account it and to remit to the tax offtice the proceeds<br />
all in the name of the ideological shift of taxing<br />
expenditure Instead of Income.<br />
Secondly, the other policy in the policy we saw at APPM, but<br />
two weeks ago. That is, that employees shouild not have a<br />
right to group together and be represented by a union in<br />
dealing with their company, or employee, that they should<br />
only have a right to deal with them individually. And of<br />
course once that happens and you have common law contracts,<br />
all the things which Australian workers have built up for<br />
themselves over the period, their annual leave, sick leave<br />
and other rates of pay and terms of conditions of employment<br />
will be swept away as each individual person will deal with<br />
their employer.<br />
Well of course organised labour in Australia would fight<br />
that one to the bitter end. And as the f ight went on, the<br />
national inflation rate would go up beyond that of a goods<br />
and services tax, and the sort of mayhem and picket lines<br />
and police pushing and shoving that we saw down In Tasmania<br />
two weeks ago would be the order of the day. We are now in<br />
a period of industrial peace which has been unprecedented.<br />
We have now got average weekly earnings for the year to<br />
March at 3.1 per cent, the inflation rate is at 1.7 per cent<br />
and industrial disputation in. I think, is probably at an<br />
all time low.<br />
To jeopardise that system and go back to' the sort of<br />
industrial confrontation chaos is about the last thing<br />
Australia needs, but that Is all, I'm afraid, Dr Hewson has<br />
to offer. Two very sterile ideas. Belt everything with a<br />
per cent consumption tax and try and to push people of f<br />
federal awards or state awards and let them into<br />
commonwealth contracts where they can only do It<br />
individually with their employer.<br />
It is not much of a solution, it Is not going to do anything<br />
about training. In fact they will add S50 million onto the<br />
Fightback proposals for TAFE. Well big deal, big deal. The<br />
kind of responsibility that TAFE is going to have in the<br />
system and the labour market programs like iobskill and<br />
Jobstart, will all be chopped to pieces as Dr Hewson trys to<br />
cut $ 10 billion out of outlays to pay his tax cuts.<br />
With us, there will be focus there on training and retraining,<br />
on labour market programs, upon award<br />
restructuring, upon productivity based enterprise bargaining<br />
by agreement, about working to a national consensus with the<br />
Government, the employers end employees working together for<br />
a low cost, low Inflation, high productivity country. That<br />
is where we are going now.<br />
Now we have paid a price for some of that in the recession,<br />
but the benefits are going to be quite profound as we go </p>
<p>12<br />
into the ' 90s with a low Inflation culture and with a high<br />
productivity culture and being truly competitive for the<br />
first time in probably, on a long term basis, in the postwar<br />
years. That is the importance of having a consensus basis<br />
to national policy and that is the importance of having a<br />
focus on educational training so that when we start selling<br />
those products we are not at the bottom of the international<br />
division of labour, doing dead-end jobs at dead-end prices,<br />
but further up the international division of labour doing<br />
clever things, clever prices, with clever people.<br />
Thank you very much. </p>
