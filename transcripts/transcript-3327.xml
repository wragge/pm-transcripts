PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY, 16 JULY 1974<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Ladies and gentlemen, I have no particular<br />
announcements to make to you. Many of you, however, have asked<br />
me directly or through my staff about the prospects of a joint<br />
sitting and what procedure will be applied upon it, where it<br />
will be held, at what hour, on what day, under what rules and<br />
with whom in the Chair. I can only repeat what I have said to<br />
you earlier that I am inclined to assume that a joint sitting<br />
will be necessary to secure the passage of the six bills, or<br />
any of the six bills, which were the grounds upon which<br />
Governor-General Hasluck granted the double dissolution on<br />
11 April last. I am not taking it for granted that the new<br />
Senate will continue the pattern of obstruction of the old<br />
Senate. I have taken the view that commonsense, good Constitutional<br />
practice and the decision of the people would prevail. Statements<br />
by members of the Opposition indicate, however, that my faith may<br />
be misplaced. These statements imply that the people did not express their<br />
will about the six bills, or that the grounds on which the<br />
former Governor-General granted the dissolution were trivial or<br />
irrelevant or at best, merely formal.<br />
This attitude pays scant credit to Sir Paul Hasluck's grasp<br />
of his constitutional responsibilities.<br />
Sir Paul's decision involved serious consideration of both<br />
the causes behind my request and the consequences of granting<br />
it. There is no necessity for joint sittings, interesting as the<br />
prospect may be to all of us as students, recorders or practitioners<br />
of politics. The smooth running of the business of Parliament and<br />
government suffered sufficient disruption through the events of<br />
April. The people's decision of May ended the need for further<br />
disruption in July.<br />
We have been without a Parliament for three months. There is<br />
an accumulation of legislation. Are there any questions?<br />
QUESTION: Why does Australia still maintain a ban on new sales<br />
contracts for uranium, and how long will this ban continue?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The whole question of the uranium sales, exploitation,<br />
processing, is still under consideration. As you know the principal<br />
ministers concerned and Imyself, toured the uranium province about<br />
three weekends ago. There are many aspects, some environmental,<br />
some Aboriginal land rights, some foreign ownership, the opportunities<br />
of processing the uranium, all of which have to be resolved. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
QUESTION: I understand the Leader of the Liberal Movement has<br />
written to you asking for extra staff and there is a precedent<br />
for this. Have you given consideration to it and will you grant<br />
it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I've given provisional consideration to it. I<br />
told Senator Steele Hall that in addition to the secretary which<br />
every non-office bearer in the Parliament has, he would be enti * tled<br />
to have a Private Secretary, and that Private Secretary would have<br />
the right to travel between Adelaide and Canberra and the right to<br />
allowances in Canberra. I haven't concluded consideration of the<br />
matter. There are two matters involved. The Senate has recognised<br />
Senator Steele Hall as the Leader of the Liberal Movement.<br />
The Senate Hansard so records it. Accordingly, he is entitled, I<br />
believe, to a Private Secretary. It is particularly important that<br />
he should have assistance of his choice in considering the backlog<br />
of legislation. I do, however, hesitate to say that we should have<br />
staff to conduct his activities as Leader of the Liberal Movement<br />
outside, apart, from his isolated work in this Parliament. There is<br />
no other member of his party in this Parliament so therefore a very<br />
great burden falls upon him. He ought to have assistance in<br />
discharging that burden. But clearly the Australian Government should<br />
hesitate in paying for organisational assistance apart from<br />
Senator Steele Hall's duties in the Parliament.<br />
QUESTION: What proposals regarding economic powers did Mr Dunstan<br />
make to yourself and Mr Crean on behalf of the State Premiers; are<br />
they acceptable to the Federal Government and, if not, what sort of<br />
proposals would be acceptable?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You had, I think, a conference with Mr Dunstan and<br />
also Sir Charles Cutler, who was still acting as Premier of N. S. W..<br />
also made a statement. Now the State officials and our officials<br />
are considering what matters could be the subject of arrangements<br />
between the seven governments. They haven't concluded their discussions.<br />
They were holding them I think, yesterday. They might also have<br />
been holding them today.<br />
QUESTION: Will there be a Premiers' Conference?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think it is very likely.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Uren said in the House this afternoon that he and you<br />
had not yet heard from Sir Robert Askin on the subject of accepting<br />
the Commonwealth money for lands and the Lands Commission or Council<br />
or Board. However, Sir Robert said at his press conference yesterday<br />
that by delaying accepting this $ 28 million for a year he had won<br />
significant concessions from the Government. Can you tell us what<br />
these concessions are?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not aware of any proposals that the N. S. W.<br />
Government is receiving in this matter which the other five<br />
governments have not also received. Reading the papers I gather<br />
that this matter was to become before the N. S. W. Cabinet this<br />
morning. Sir Robert Askin might have sent me a message, I haven't<br />
received it, since that meeting.<br />
QUESTION: The arrangements between the Australian Government and<br />
the N. S. W. Government, assuming the N. S. W. Government accepts it,<br />
now would be exactly the same as between the Australian Government<br />
and the South Australian Government? / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
QUESTION: Can you tell us when we can expect a decision by the<br />
Governme nt on the IAC report on the motor industry?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wouldn't put a date on it. I would think it<br />
might easily be a couple of months or even longer. We have made<br />
the report available as promptly as it was physically possible.*<br />
QUESTION: What is the latest information your Government has<br />
received on the situation in Cyprus and what is your Government's<br />
attitude towards recent events there?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We have no official information about the situation<br />
in Cyprus except from our police who are there. They are reporting<br />
it through their own situation but they are not in the capital,<br />
so we are no better informed than anybody following the media.<br />
It appears that the President may still be alive. We have shown<br />
ourselves anxious to co-operate with the U. N. Peace-keeping force<br />
in Cyprus. We have been there now for many years and we are grateful<br />
for five of the State Governments for maintaining their contributions<br />
to the police from Australia in Cyprus.<br />
QUESTION: Could you give us your attitude to the very heavy buying<br />
of wool by the Wool Corporation in the last two days?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
QUESTION: Could I ask whether the Government will consider the<br />
question? PRIME MINISTER: Yes, if there is a submission on it.<br />
QUESTION: Assuming that Sir Robert Askin and his Government accepts<br />
the money for the Loan Council, when is the earliest they can<br />
receive it, now or wait until the September Budget?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Isn't it on the Notice Paper now. It's about to<br />
come in. Isn't it on today's Notice Paper? At any rate, that<br />
will depend on the terms of their agreement.<br />
QUESTION: You had some fairly harsh criticism of multi-national<br />
corporations during the election campaign and you foreshadowed<br />
amendments to the foreign takeovers legislation. You also intend<br />
to act on the Federal Conference resolution of last year calling<br />
for an official inquiry into multi-national corporations, their impact<br />
on the economy and the employment situation.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We have for many months past had Sir Ronald Walker<br />
representing us in the United Nations and also in the OECD on the<br />
inquiries which they have been conducting into this very matter.<br />
You will remember that Sir Ronald Walker was Ambassador in Paris and<br />
then in Bonn and was a Professor of Economics before that, so he was<br />
ideally qualified to conduct such inquiries and to contribute to<br />
inquiries in those international bodies I have mentioned.<br />
QUESTION: Was the Overseas Trading Corporation considered by Cabinet<br />
today and was any decision reached on it? / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We didn't consider many submissions in Cabinet<br />
today. The most of this morning's deliberations were in the<br />
legislation committee, approving the form of bills which have been<br />
introduced. As you notice there have been a very great number<br />
introduced today so we were doing those and there will be some<br />
further ones introduced tomorrow, so that is what we were mainly<br />
doing today. There were only two matters which we concluded in<br />
Cabinet today. I believe Mr Enderby, the Minister for Manufacturing<br />
Industry, will be briefing you about one of those, the committee<br />
to inquire into the workload for the Government Defence Act.<br />
And the other matter was largely machinery concerning the election<br />
of the first free elected Legislative Assembly of the Northern<br />
Territory. We also put through at the Executive Council this morning<br />
the ordinance for the Legislative Assembly, the first fully-elected<br />
representative body in the Capital Territory.<br />
QUESTION: Will this legislation include increases in personal<br />
services<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Cabinet has never considered this matter.<br />
It has had no submission before it.<br />
QUESTION: How long will the Government allow the Senate to consider<br />
the six bills, four days, six days, three days<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That is up to the Senate.<br />
QUESTION: The Government itself hasn't set a time, like say four days?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
QUESTION: When will the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly<br />
be ready to How long will it take to set up the Assembly and how<br />
many members will it have and what will it be? What can you tell<br />
us about it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You had better get the details from Dr Patterson,<br />
I think it is 19 members. The distribution of electorates has<br />
already been done, but it has to take effect in the context of a fully<br />
elected Assembly. The electorates upon which it is suggested that<br />
that election will take place are ready I belive for presentation.<br />
QUESTION: One of the pieces of legislation introduced today concerns<br />
the Prices Justification Tribunal. It does not contain any sections<br />
relating to the making of decisions of the Tribunal mandatory as was<br />
foreshadowed during the election campaign. Can you again explain<br />
why this hasn't happened? Do you think there will be any further<br />
changes in the near future in Prices Justification legislation<br />
particularly any following the move which was made in the Caucus about<br />
changing the criteria for justification inquiries. And, just a<br />
separate question, will the Cabinet be considering the Vernon Report<br />
on the Post Office before that report is made public within the<br />
next fortnight?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The first one, not this sessional period. The second<br />
one, no.<br />
QUESTION: Do you believe that the Post Office should pay its own way<br />
and that if necessary postal costs should be increased to make certain<br />
that it does? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I believe that all Government businesses should<br />
pay their own way. That should be no surprise to you that that is<br />
my view. I don't believe taxpayers should, without very good reason,<br />
support Government enterprises or private enterprises. But, in<br />
any case, I stated that at the Premiers' Conference. I commended<br />
that attitude to the Premiers, I said we would apply it ourselves.<br />
You mention the Post Office. There is, of course another way on which<br />
the Post Office is I'm assured acting diligently and that is to<br />
restrict the amount of public money going into its services. There<br />
are certain governmental activities in Australia, roads and telephones<br />
being among them, which we regard as having a lower priority than<br />
some other form of government activity. The approach we are pursuing<br />
is that the taxpayers should not provide more for P. M. G. services<br />
in the forthcoming Budget than they did in the last.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Dunstan, Sir Charles Cutler and the Victorian Acting<br />
Premier, have all made conflicting statements over what powers<br />
they believe the States could be ready to concede to the Commonwealth<br />
or co-operate in the exercise with the Commonwealth, so that seems<br />
to indicate that the States are not ready to agree, therefore why<br />
have a Premiers' Conference?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You assert that they have made different statements.<br />
Well they might have but I haven't checked all the reports which<br />
said.... QUESTION: Well, you read Sir Charles' statement?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: But he sent me a copy. Sir Charles sent me, by<br />
telegram, a copy of his press statement. He also, I noticed, gave<br />
a TV interview. He may easily have said some things in that<br />
television interview which conflicted or appeared to conflict with<br />
what Mr Dunstan said in the same medium or what he, himself, had<br />
said in his press statement of which he sent me a copy by cable.<br />
Now, I am not going to assume that you are just to them. You are<br />
fair to them in saying that they have made conflicting statements<br />
but this at least is clear: that we have all agreed to have our<br />
officials discuss what methods we, as Heads of Government, can<br />
discuss and when that package or program comes from the officials<br />
I expect that the Heads of Government will get together and discuss<br />
them. There was one instance which was given on the pattern of what<br />
was done in the late 1940s under National Security Regulations.<br />
It was the control of building materials. I was delighted that this<br />
matter had been discussed between the Premiers and Acting Premiers.<br />
It seems to me a matter in which they show a very natural interest<br />
because just as our program for welfare housing has been limited by<br />
the shortage of materials or rather the diversion of materials to say<br />
skyscrapers so the State Government's programs for say schools and<br />
hospitals have been similarly limited by a diversion of building<br />
materials for skyscrapers. Now it well may be that State Governments<br />
of all political complexions would think that priorities require<br />
that there should be enough materials for those essential public<br />
works. We would agree with them. It is a matter upon which they can<br />
very clearly make laws, just as clearly as a matter upon which we<br />
can' t.<br />
QUESTION: Due to the importance of Indonesia in Australia's foreign<br />
policy, are there any plans in the immediate future to re-conduct<br />
the talks again between you and President Soeharto which was postponed<br />
last May, and, if so, would you care to comment on the value of these<br />
talks within the framework of Australian/ Indonesian relations? / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There are discussions going on at the moment between<br />
Indonesia and Australia for me to visit the President. I was to visit<br />
him, you remember, in the very weekend after the Parliament was<br />
dissolved. I thought in that case it should be postponed. I hope<br />
we will be able to arrange a visit by me to Central Java, I expect,<br />
that was where the venue was previously suggested, maybe at the end<br />
of August or early in September. Discussions are taking place.<br />
I am actually anxious to accept the President's invitation as soon<br />
as possible because we know each other well enough to transact a<br />
very great deal of business, to exchange views on a great number<br />
of subjects. The President likes this form of discussion with<br />
people whom he knows fairly well. He has recently, of course, done<br />
it with President Marcos and Prime Minister Tun Razak and I was<br />
to be the first, well I will be the third now, so I am very anxious<br />
to have this discussion.<br />
QUESTION: Is the Government still committed to the Australian<br />
Assistance Plan? Is this proposal under any sort of re-consideration<br />
or recasting?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well we are still committed to it naturally. The<br />
form it takes is under constant review.<br />
QUESTION: At the Premiers' Conference you warned of the stringent<br />
attitude the Australian Government would be taking when framing<br />
the coming Budget. If you can work out with the six State Premiers<br />
a satisfactory package to fight inflation, would you see this as an<br />
alternative or an addition to the Federal Government's stringent<br />
attitude to the Budget and in the important discussions you have had<br />
twice now with senior ministers at the Lodge, have you formed some<br />
sort of attitude about whether that stringent stance would be as<br />
tough as you thought at the time?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: What the Premiers and the Treasurer and I would<br />
discuss would be a supplement to what has already been announced.<br />
There has been a very great gap in the fight against inflation in<br />
Australia in that the States have not exercised their constitutional<br />
powers in many respects. Very clearly they have the constitutional<br />
power, the Australian Parliament doesn't have the constitutional power<br />
to regulate land prices or the availability of building materials.<br />
There is some hope now that the States will exercise their<br />
constitutional responsibility in such respects.<br />
QUESTION: Would you explain in brief the relations between Australia<br />
and Cuba and Latin America?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Our Foreign Minister, Senator Willesee, has recently<br />
visited several countries in Latin America. He is the first<br />
Australian Foreign Minister, I believe, ever to have made an official<br />
visit to any country in South America. I was the first Prime Minister<br />
to ever visit a country in Latin America but I visited the northern<br />
most one, Mexico. It is quite likely that I shall be visiting some<br />
others in the steps of the Foreign Minister maybe or the Caribbean<br />
countries before the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting which<br />
may be held at the end of April in Kingston, Jamaica.<br />
You ask me about our relations with Cuba. I haven't had the<br />
opportunity to refresh my memory about this. At the time of liberation, 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
in December 1972, there had been an application by the Cuban<br />
Government to establish Consular relations with Australia. This was<br />
far too difficult a problem for our predecessors to solve, it was<br />
probably even too embarrassing for them to discuss. Nevertheless,<br />
when I was in Tokyo last October where the approach had been made by<br />
the Cuban Ambassador to the Australian Ambassador, I took the<br />
opportunity to ask our Ambassador to convey to the Cuban Ambassador<br />
our willingness to establish such relations. I am not sure that the<br />
arrangements have yet been consummated but if you want the full<br />
details then I can get them for you.<br />
QUESTION: Could you tell us if you are completely in favour with<br />
the amendments to the Prices Justification Tribunal Act along the<br />
line of the amendment moved in Caucus last week by Mr Willis?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not at all adverse to it, but we could not<br />
have drafted it in this sessional period. There is a further<br />
difficulty. One of the criteria was related to productivity and<br />
as you know Australian statistics on productivity are absent or<br />
where there are any, they are deficient. Now it would be a colossal<br />
task for any Parliamentary counsel to draft a criterian of productivity<br />
in such a situation of statistical and economic derth in our country. </p>
