<p>The Australian Football Community today joined together in celebration with the announcement from Mauritius that Moya Dodd will be co-opted as the first ever Australian to the FIFA executive committee.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Minister for Sport Kate Lundy today congratulated Ms Dodd on her amazing achievement. </p>
<p>A former Matilda's vice captain, Ms Dodd has been on the Football Federation of Australia board since 2007 and was elected Vice-President of the Asian Football Confederation in 2009, proudly representing Australian football across Asia. </p>
<p>Australian Football is expanding at a rapid rate and it is fantastic that Australia will have a voice in one of the world's most powerful sporting bodies. </p>
<p>In addition to being the first Australian on the executive committee, Ms Dodd also becomes one of the first women, joining a representative from Burundi and the Turks and Caicos Islands. </p>
<p>It is positive to see barriers for women on sporting governing bodies being broken down not only in Australia but also internationally. So many women are passionate about sport and this is great news for those that dream of a career in sporting administration.</p>
