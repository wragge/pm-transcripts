<p> PILKINGTON:</p>
<p> Welcome back Prime Minister John Howard, good</p>
<p>   morning.</p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Good morning Tony, good to be here both of you.</p>
<p> MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p> Prime Minister, of course you're in town today</p>
<p>   and primarily speaking this afternoon at the Australiasian Drug</p>
<p>   Strategy conference which by all records has been an enormous success.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things that they've been talking about, and</p>
<p>   I'd like to get your thoughts on them.  We had our Director</p>
<p>   of Public Prosecutions, Paul Rofe yesterday coming out and saying,</p>
<p>   and I think he was stirring the pot, but suggesting that perhaps</p>
<p>   we need to rethink the way we handle marijuana.  Even looking</p>
<p>   at treating it the same as alcohol and cigarettes.  Maybe even</p>
<p>   selling them from the local deli.  Now I know that you're very</p>
<p>   much keen on zero tolerance. But what do you make of those sorts</p>
<p>   of comments?  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> Well I don't agree with them.  I think</p>
<p>   they're unhelpful, they're out of line with community opinion, and</p>
<p>   they're also out of line with the tragic experience of people who</p>
<p>   are addicted to marijuana.  I know the use of marijuana is</p>
<p>   far more widespread than say heroin.  But I also know, and</p>
<p>   I've had recent evidence of it, I was in Western Australia last</p>
<p>   week and my policy adviser on drugs had extensive meetings with</p>
<p>   a group of people including one person who said his life had been</p>
<p>   totally destroyed by marijuana.  One of the things that he</p>
<p>   found totally depressing and distressing was that it was very difficult</p>
<p>   to get help for marijuana addiction because there was a mood amongst</p>
<p>   too many people that some how or rather its use or overuse was quite</p>
<p>   acceptable and second order concern.  And he said that if he</p>
<p>   ever broke his habit what he would do is try and form a marijuana</p>
<p>   users group to seek more assistance.  So I don't think those</p>
<p>   calls are helpful.  Obviously the laws relating to these things</p>
<p>   are matters for State governments but there will be no encouragement</p>
<p>   at all from the Federal Government for further liberalisation of</p>
<p>   the law.'  </p>
<p> MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Talking about that, I mean I know there have been some complaints</p>
<p>   from parents groups saying that professionals in this area don't</p>
<p>   take parents' concerns and complaints about marijuana seriously</p>
<p>   enough.  Do you agree with that?  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> Well there's some evidence of that and one of</p>
<p>   the advantages of the new programmes that we're going to fund, rising</p>
<p>   out of the announcement I made at the Premiers' Conference is that</p>
<p>   we're going to give a lot more resources to the treatment of people.</p>
<p>And the diversion programme that we have in mind, the situation</p>
<p>   where people where people who are in affect caught up with the law</p>
<p>   in relation to relatively minor offences will be given the option</p>
<p>   of going to some kind of treatment rather than getting caught in</p>
<p>   the criminal justice system, which nobody really wants them to.</p>
<p>I mean I have never argued, despite the tough line I take, I've</p>
<p>   never argued that the full sanction of the law is appropriate for</p>
<p>   bare use and possession.  What I think is desirable is to say</p>
<p>   to people who are in that situation, that preliminary legal situation</p>
<p>   you might call it, but hey, you've got to make a choice now. Either</p>
<p>   you try and do something about your habit or you run the risk of</p>
<p>   your legal situation getting much worse over time.  </p>
<p> PILKINGTON:</p>
<p> Prime Minister, what about drug courts?</p>
<p>We'll be talking to one of the judges here in Adelaide who's one</p>
<p>   of the key note speakers along with yourself this afternoon.</p>
<p>  MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p> The chap from the United States.</p>
<p> PILKINGTON:</p>
<p> Yeah.  Your feelings about the introduction</p>
<p>   of drug courts in this country.  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> I think they're a good idea.  </p>
<p> PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>  Good idea?  </p>
<p>  PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> Yeah, and there is a great consistency between</p>
<p>   what the New South Wales government has done with drug courts and</p>
<p>   what we are proposing.  There's a lot of consistency with what</p>
<p>   the Victorian government has done in relation to diverting people</p>
<p>   away from the criminal justice system into treatment, and in what</p>
<p>   we propose.  We would like to make that nation wide.</p>
<p>We're not trying to make that nation wide, we're not trying to make</p>
<p>   it completely uniform.  Different States will do it slightly</p>
<p>   differently.  But the resources are there from the Federal</p>
<p>   government to provide additional treatment for people who are trying</p>
<p>   to break their addiction.  </p>
<p> MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>So in establishing those drug courts, as we know there's a trial</p>
<p>   going on in New South Wales at the moment.  Certainly there</p>
<p>   have been calls today for one to be established here.  The</p>
<p>   Federal government has already allocated, or will allocate funds...?</p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> The Federal government will allocate over, I</p>
<p>   think it's about $120 million over the period of three or four years,</p>
<p>   to fund additional treatment places to which people will be diverted</p>
<p>   by the individual States either by drug courts, or some other methodology</p>
<p>   with the States in consultation with the Federal government will</p>
<p>   establish.  </p>
<p> MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p> So establishing the actual drug courts themselves..</p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> Well it doesn't have to just be a drug court.</p>
<p>It can be some kind of procedure which is roughly equivalent to</p>
<p>   that and we will work that out with each individual State.</p>
<p>But the outline of what we're offering is this: if you establish</p>
<p>   a diversion mechanism, be it a drug court or something else, this</p>
<p>   is our offer to the States, we will provide you with additional</p>
<p>   money to the tune of $110 million to $120 million to pay for additional</p>
<p>   treatment places. Those treatment places will be sought by the various</p>
<p>   organisations who treat peoples' drug addiction.  About 300,000</p>
<p>   treatment places over a four year period will be possible as a result</p>
<p>   of the additional money we're making available.  </p>
<p> PILKINGTON:</p>
<p> Prime Minister, on the issue of East Timor,</p>
<p>   I mean you're just back from there, and yet I've read the comments</p>
<p>   in the paper this morning about the pro-Jakarta militia saying that</p>
<p>   they simply won't adhere to any sort of a peace keeping force up</p>
<p>   there.  I mean has this changed your thinking at all in the</p>
<p>   last 24 hours, or are you still going to go ahead with the proposal</p>
<p>   of sending Australian police up there?  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER: </p>
<p> We'll be going ahead, but subject always as</p>
<p>   has it has been, to being satisfied about adequate arrangements</p>
<p>   for their safety. You can't ever say to anybody in all honesty who</p>
<p>   is being sent to a trouble spot, be that person a police officer</p>
<p>   or a soldier, you can't ever say there's no danger and any Prime</p>
<p>   Minister who says that is being dishonest.  Of course there's</p>
<p>   always danger and my responsibility is to make certain that the</p>
<p>   security arrangements are as good as they can possibly be in a less</p>
<p>   than satisfactory situation.  Now there's a lot of noise coming</p>
<p>   out of Timor.  There's been a lot of loss of life.  There</p>
<p>   have been commitments made by the Indonesian government and the</p>
<p>   Indonesian armed forces.  We have to wait and see the full</p>
<p>   extent to which those undertakings are honoured.  There's certainly</p>
<p>   a lot more pressure now on the Indonesian government as a result</p>
<p>   of the meeting I had with President Habibie.  There's a lot</p>
<p>   more international focus on him.  He has made very strong commitments</p>
<p>   not only to me but also to the United Nations and the agreement</p>
<p>   that will be finally signed in New York next week contains a very</p>
<p>   strong commitment to the process of arms being laid down in the</p>
<p>   process of complete neutrality by the Indonesian army in relation</p>
<p>   to the choice that's going to be made by the East Timorese people.</p>
<p>Now I can't give guarantees.  I've made that clear from the</p>
<p>   beginning.  I can report that I have more confidence that you</p>
<p>   will have a fairly, a relatively peaceful handling of the act of</p>
<p>   choice.  I've got more confidence about that now than I had</p>
<p>   before.  But it's a difficult and fraught situation and I can't</p>
<p>   give guarantees except I make this commitment: that the Australian</p>
<p>   government will use every pressure and effort and influence it has</p>
<p>   to ensure that the conditions under which any Australian personnel</p>
<p>   go into East Timor, be they police or members of the United Nations</p>
<p>   supervisory force, are as safe as possible in the circumstances.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p> Was President Habibie more accommodating than</p>
<p>   you thought he may have been?  I mean you spoke for what, face</p>
<p>   to face for about an hour-and-a-half..  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> We had an hour-and-a-half just the two of us.</p>
<p>That was a very good discussion.  </p>
<p> PILKINGTON:</p>
<p> Initially it was going to be what, half-an-hour</p>
<p>   or so?  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> Well there are no fixed rules. I mean the press</p>
<p>   said half-an-hour.  I mean there are no fixed rules about these</p>
<p>   things, although an hour-an-a-half one on one in a situation like</p>
<p>   this is longer than normal and I thought that was useful because</p>
<p>   it's always better to eyeball somebody and vice-versa.  And</p>
<p>   we covered all of the ground and then we went over quite a bit of</p>
<p>   it again in the plenary session.  </p>
<p> PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Was he more accommodating?  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> Well I don't know that I tried in advance to</p>
<p>   put any kind of ruler on it.  We couldn't have got a better</p>
<p>   outcome.  And the people who are running around saying well</p>
<p>   it's not good enough.  Can I say what is their alternative?</p>
<p>Are they saying we should invade Indonesia.  I mean Australia</p>
<p>   has three alternatives with this issue.  We can do what the</p>
<p>   government is now doing and that is use Australia's influence in</p>
<p>   a positive way.  We can invade the country, and nobody's seriously</p>
<p>   suggesting that.  Or we can simply say we don't want any more</p>
<p>   to do with Indonesia.  We withdraw all our aid, all our military</p>
<p>   ties and everything.  We walk way from our nearest neighbour,</p>
<p>   the largest Islamic country in the world with a population of 211</p>
<p>   million people.  Now you only have to state it like that to</p>
<p>   realise that the course we have chosen is the only course.</p>
<p>As for our political opponent, well they had 13 years to persuade</p>
<p>   the Indonesians to change their policy on East Timor, and to my</p>
<p>   recollection they didn't even try.  </p>
<p> MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what about the suggestion of temporary economic</p>
<p>   sanctions against Indonesia, until this is resolved?</p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> Well I don't think would help because that would</p>
<p>   discourage Indonesia for listening to world opinion.  I mean</p>
<p>   aren't we in the business at the moment of trying to persuade Indonesia</p>
<p>   to effectively restrain her armed forces and allow a free and open</p>
<p>   ballot?  Well if you in the one breath say to a country, we</p>
<p>   want you to behave, we want you to do that, but in the next breath</p>
<p>   we're going to make your tragic economic situation even more tragic.</p>
<p>There are tens of millions of Indonesians living in absolute poverty.</p>
<p>What is the point of making them even more miserable?  Do you</p>
<p>   think that's going to change the attitude of their government, and</p>
<p>   the attitude of their people?  I mean I think people who propose</p>
<p>   that at the present time really have no understanding of the reality</p>
<p>   of that country.  There are 211 million people in Indonesia,</p>
<p>   there are 900,000 in East Timor.  And that country has gone</p>
<p>   through the most appalling economic depravation.  Sure it is</p>
<p>   not a free country, sure there have been gross abuses of human rights</p>
<p>   and there has been a tragic loss of life, and we have condemned</p>
<p>   it.  I mean I have in fact condemned it more strongly than</p>
<p>   Mr Keating ever condemned the behaviour of the Indonesian government</p>
<p>   in relation to East Timor.  But I'm trying to hold onto reality,</p>
<p>   and the greatest influence that Australia can use is our credibility</p>
<p>   in the relationship we have with Indonesia and if you start talking</p>
<p>   at this stage about economic sanctions you will lose any hope of</p>
<p>   exercising that influence.  </p>
<p> PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, just finally on Indonesia, what's the likely</p>
<p>   outcome of the debate on this - I think it is scheduled for the</p>
<p>   8th of August up there?  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> Well I don't know.  I'm more concerned</p>
<p>   it being a free and open vote.  Our view is that the people</p>
<p>   of East Timor should have the right to decide their own future..</p>
<p> MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p> Without coercion?  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:</p>
<p>Without coercion and intimidation.  Now that is very critical</p>
<p>   and obviously what has been going there in the last few weeks has</p>
<p>   given one no encouragement to believe that that would happen.</p>
<p>And that is why I said what I did the weekend before last, it's</p>
<p>   why I rang Dr Habibie it's why I went to meet him in Bali earlier</p>
<p>   this week: to make the point to him how critical it was for Indonesia's</p>
<p>   international reputation that there be a free and open vote, and</p>
<p>   there be seen to be a free and open vote.  Now he's given an</p>
<p>   undertaking.  We have to wait and see what materialises.</p>
<p>We all hope it will be a free and open vote.  We're willing</p>
<p>   to make a contribution.  But I can't guarantee it, but I can</p>
<p>   say this: that if you adopt any other course of action your capacity</p>
<p>   to influence events in that country will disappear overnight.</p>
<p> MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p> Now, look, Prime Minister, I got terribly excited</p>
<p>   yesterday.  I thought we were about to have an interest rate</p>
<p>   cut.  Was it on the books?  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> Oh, I never speculate about the future level</p>
<p>   of interest rates. Never.  </p>
<p> PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>I wondered why you were so happy yesterday.  </p>
<p> MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p> Well, I was I was thinking.  </p>
<p> PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>I noticed you were on a bit of a high yesterday, you know, something</p>
<p>   good must have happened.  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> Well, it was a very good inflation number but</p>
<p>   interest rates are set from time to time by the Reserve Bank and</p>
<p>   I never publicly speculate and I never say they should be higher</p>
<p>   or lower.  The only thing I ever talk about are the general</p>
<p>   economic positions that influence what in turn determines the level</p>
<p>   of interest rates and clearly if you have low inflation and you</p>
<p>   have low, or you have no Budget deficits, and you have Budget surpluses</p>
<p>   and all of those things, it all helps the general economic climate.</p>
<p>But the, the day to day level of interest rates is a matter for</p>
<p>   the Reserve Bank, I merely remark that they are the lowest now they've</p>
<p>   been for 30 years, and home buyers are better off on average to</p>
<p>   the tune of about $320 to $330 a months, which is an enormous amount.</p>
<p>It's the equivalent of about getting a $100 a week pay rise for</p>
<p>   an average wage and salary earner and it does mean an enormous amount</p>
<p>   to millions of Australian families to have much lower interest rates;</p>
<p>   it means that they're, they've got a capacity to spend money on</p>
<p>   things like a slightly better family holiday, some additional entertaining.</p>
<p> MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p> Private health insurance.  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> And private health.  Well, private health</p>
<p>   insurance are getting a 30% tax rebate as well.  So, all of</p>
<p>   those things mean that the general living standard of the average</p>
<p>   wage and salary earner is a lot higher now than it was up a few</p>
<p>   years ago.  </p>
<p> MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p> What about the latest news about the preamble.</p>
<p>I know we had a chat with you not that long ago about the preamble</p>
<p>   and that whole concept of 'mateship' and the furore that followed</p>
<p>   that.  It now seemed that the opposition forces have in fact</p>
<p>   joined forces and you're likely to be rolled on that.  What's</p>
<p>   your reaction? </p>
<p>  PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> Well, my reaction is that it would be very disappointing</p>
<p>   if the one opportunity we've got for a long time to have a new preamble,</p>
<p>   which at least acknowledges the historical place of the indigenous</p>
<p>   people in our community, is lost.  Now, obviously if the Senate</p>
<p>   votes down the Government's proposal, then there can't be a vote</p>
<p>   on the preamble at the same time as the vote on the republic and</p>
<p>   I therefore don't think we'll revisit the preamble issue for years.</p>
<p>And therefore the opportunity we have on the eve of the Centenary</p>
<p>   of Federation to do what I think most Australians would like to</p>
<p>   do and that is to at least write the indigenous people into the</p>
<p>   Constitution in a non-controversial way, that will have been lost.</p>
<p>Now, in the end, I can't force a vote on the preamble if the Senate</p>
<p>   doesn't support it.  There's not time to sort of put it back</p>
<p>   again and go through all of that business for it to be listed at</p>
<p>   the same time as the Republic and if the Senate decides to vote</p>
<p>   the Government's proposal down, then there won't be vote on the</p>
<p>   preamble.  I mean, I accept that.  </p>
<p> MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p> What was the, what was the sticking point, because</p>
<p>   I gather the Opposition wants to talk about 'indigenous custodianship';</p>
<p>   do you agree with that or is there something about that phrase that</p>
<p>   you're not comfortable with?  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> Well, I've been careful to say that in relation</p>
<p>   to references to the indigenous people that you've got to have a</p>
<p>   form of words that everybody agrees on and there's no point in pushing</p>
<p>   things too far out in one direction so that you start losing people</p>
<p>   in another part of the argument.  I mean, let me put it this</p>
<p>   way, everybody who believes in custodianship also accepts that the</p>
<p>   Aborigines were the first inhabitants.  Not everybody who accepts</p>
<p>   that the Aborigines were the first inhabitants necessarily want</p>
<p>   to use the word 'custodianship.'  So the point I'm simply making</p>
<p>   is that if you want to get something in an area like this, you've</p>
<p>   got to try and find some common ground.  But, I haven't ruled</p>
<p>   out making some changes to the proposal that I put up.  I didn't</p>
<p>   say that that was set in stone.  I've sent a copy of it to</p>
<p>   Mr Beazley, I've sent a copy of it to the Democrats, to the Premiers.</p>
<p>I've received something like 430 responses to the draft we put out,</p>
<p>   I'm going to have a look at all of those and see where we go from</p>
<p>   there.  </p>
<p> MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p> Is there a problem that custodianship may somehow</p>
<p>   imply ongoing ownership?  </p>
<p> PRIME</p>
<p>   MINISTER:   </p>
<p> Well, some people feel that.  Now, well,</p>
<p>   I don't myself but some people do.  I'm not myself persuaded</p>
<p>   of that but a lot of people of goodwill are concerned about that</p>
<p>   and I respect their views.  But I just say again that you've</p>
<p>   got nothing at the moment, we can have common ground on something,</p>
<p>   but if you push that too far, you'll end up having nothing, which</p>
<p>   is where we are at the present time.  And that really is the</p>
<p>   choice in the end that might be faced by the Labor Party and the</p>
<p>   Democrats and the Greens in the Senate.  If they're going to</p>
