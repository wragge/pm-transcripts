CIVIC RECEPTION. MANLY. N. S. W.<br />
12th MARCH ,1964+<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt, Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Mr. Mayor, Mr. w4entworth and Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
I wouldn't want to describe this as a big moment because<br />
it is a rather truncated moment. I was given a programme this<br />
morning and I metaphorically have an eye on the clock. Now,<br />
might I Just begin by thanking you and referring to one of the<br />
last observations made by Bill Wentworth, He described me rather<br />
rashly as the " 1P. PM, 1" ( permanent Prime Minister). I would like<br />
to have you know that the wife of a former Governor-General of<br />
Australia, Lady Gowrie, always in writing a letter to my wife,<br />
addresses her as " Dear not PPM. but P. MM. which means<br />
" Prime Minister's Missus" ( Laughter) but then later on as it<br />
became more and more clear that I wasnrt entirely my own master<br />
on these things, I think, Pat, she began to address you as<br />
too. ( Laughter) Now, Sir, today and I must mention this before I<br />
forget it we have had three rather splendid events and some of<br />
them may not have been observed, One is that when we arrived<br />
over the road we had the pipes. Now, I have a good deal of<br />
Scottish blooA, my wife has a most diabolical mixture of Scottish<br />
and Irish blood but whichever way it goes, it is always a great<br />
thrill to hear Lhe 11pipes and to hear them played so well and I<br />
would like to say " thank you" to those who attended us in that<br />
way* And there is a second thing about my clan, the Mingies<br />
clan if you care to address me properly. The clan colours are<br />
red and white and we have both been delighted to find that you<br />
have given us that complimont in the table decorations along here.<br />
The slogan, if I remember correctly, is' Geal ' us Dearg a suas"<br />
which is my approximation to Gaelic and it means, " Up with the<br />
white and red" ( Laughter). In Melbourne they have always thought<br />
that that made me an absolute certainty to be a supporter of<br />
South Melbourne in the football ( Laughter) but I never have been.<br />
Then when we walked in down below, we had all these rather<br />
dwarfed, anaemic-looking characters ( Laughter) representing<br />
lifesaving clubs and that was a great compliment and a great<br />
pleasure. As a matter of fact, I didn't realise until I was<br />
coming across here this morning from the airport that surfing, to<br />
put it no wider than that, is an extremely modern art. I thought<br />
that it went back to time immremorial in this greatest of all<br />
surfing States, but oh no, one of my Secretaries was able to tell<br />
me, as an old Sydrieian, that it is within living memory that some<br />
lawless citizen, he thought a bank manager, plunged into the<br />
surf and was prosecuted ( Laughter) because it was a breach of<br />
the law. Very interesting that this thing one always associates<br />
with Manly should have been of such modern growth.<br />
He also told me, Sir and you have repeated itthat<br />
this was once known as " The Village". Certainly, of all cities<br />
of this kind, it has a unique character and I was wondering with<br />
him as to why it had this unique character until I realised, as<br />
an ignorant man from Melbourne might be forgiven for not knowing,<br />
that it is within the memory of men of middle years that if you<br />
wanted to come by water you came by the ferry so that this was<br />
a relatively isolated community, though I am bound to say that the<br />
e./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
first time I ever came here as an ordinary respectable citizen<br />
many years ago, and got off the ferry and went along the Corso<br />
and went over on to the beach and gazed on the people, I didn't<br />
observe as perhaps I should have this simple, unsophisticated,<br />
unworldly character which I now gather the citizens of Manly<br />
possess. ( Laughter) Still even then, allowing for all that, it<br />
was great fun. As for the quarantine station, I must mention<br />
this. I don't know very much about the quarantine station.<br />
I don't remember that in my current incumbency we have had any<br />
case put to us about the quarantine station. I don't recall it.<br />
You check up on it. You will get the same answer no doubt<br />
( Laughter) but any rate I remember years ago and not so many<br />
years ago at that -if f were in Sydney, I oucasionally went out<br />
Li a yacht with a very well-known Sydney man and we found our way<br />
around the harbour and I studied the first rudiments of keeping<br />
the boat half a point off the wind with great skill -I have<br />
always been indebted to him for teaching me that because, by<br />
Jove, I've been keeping it half a point off the wind for a long<br />
time now politically ( Laughter) ( Applause) Well, wo always<br />
arrivei. at lunch time and dropped anchor just near the quarantine<br />
station and even then I used to look at it and admire the utter<br />
solitude of the place, not a human being to be seen and, as far<br />
as I can tell, not a germ to be seen ( Laughter) We ate our rood<br />
and had a drink of something or other, then we up-3nchored and<br />
went back to tae other side of the harbour. A&amp; nd so, Sir, I was<br />
surprised to hear you say there is still a quarantine station.<br />
Has it been used of late? ( Voice in background Well,<br />
think of the advantage. There you have a lovely bit or parkland<br />
with a few harmless old buildings on it and if you had your way,<br />
you would have all thi. s thrown open and you would cover it with<br />
red-tiled roofs, wouldn't you? ( Voice in background " No")<br />
Oh, that's out. ( Laughter) When you bring that next deputation,<br />
make a point of that, will you? ( Laughter)<br />
But, really, ladies and gentlemen, all ' I want to say<br />
to you on behalf of my wife and myself is that we are very<br />
grateful to you and we are very glad that in an official capacity<br />
we are able to come to this famous city. You know, one of the<br />
things that has been going on in the world which attracts the<br />
attention, I think, of a great number of thoughtful people, is<br />
that in the modern world, let me make it more narrow still in<br />
the world since the war, since these great movements of national<br />
independence have been occurring right through Asia and through<br />
Africa and elsewhere in this world there is a great disposition,<br />
which I think is a wrong disposition, to create self-government<br />
from the top. The disposition is to say to a country -it may<br />
be Ghana, it may be Kenya, it may be some other country -" You<br />
are now given independence", so we in effect pass an act of<br />
Parliament and we say, " There you are, now you create a Parliament<br />
and you are self-governing independent and all other things will<br />
be added to you," There is a great disposition to say this, a<br />
great disposition to do it in many international bodies, to start<br />
at the top and say " Create a National Assembly in this country"<br />
and then you have lone the lot. It can work the future out as it<br />
1ike, It is worthwhile reflecting Mr. Mayor, that that hasn't<br />
been our historic process, either in 4reat Britain or in Australia<br />
and if there are any people n the world who ought to understand<br />
Parliamentary self-government it is the British because tafter<br />
all, our ancestors invented it. But they didn't invent Itfrom<br />
the top. They invented it from lower down in this tructure of<br />
organisation, from the old shire moot, from the old " hundred"<br />
moots in England from the little organisations of local government<br />
spreading out into some sort of county organisation and ultimately to./ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
by slow and painful degrees, over the course of centuries, into<br />
a Parliament which was the apex of this structure of selfgovernment.<br />
But it is an apex which could not be sustained<br />
without the sub-structure, so that I don't believe that any<br />
State Parliament could be effective or even survive without<br />
a sub-structure of municipal government and I certainly don't<br />
believe that a national parliament and government could survive<br />
without a sub-structure. The whole thing about local government<br />
is not only that it attends to local affairs much more<br />
effectively than far-removed people could, but that it gives<br />
people experience in the art of self'-government it gives people<br />
the opportunity to be elected, not to some great office of<br />
profit but to an office of service, to an office in which<br />
they are responsible to people for a variety of matters and<br />
in which the people look to them and in which they look to the<br />
people and they come and they go and they may be voted out,<br />
they may be voted in, but this is part of our genius in the<br />
business of government. We take it ' for granted, but it has<br />
been completely ignored many many times in the last twenty<br />
years, You take our responsibilities in New Guinea and Papua<br />
not so remote from us, from you. There are plenty of people<br />
in this world wh~ o think that the one thing you have to do* in<br />
Papua and New Guinea is to set up a parliament and then walk<br />
out and say, " Well, now, it is !, ll yours. You are completely<br />
self-governing, you are independent. We leave you to it."<br />
That is not our tradition. For years now, we ave been helping<br />
to create in thos3 territories local governments, the equivalent<br />
of our municipalities, with a lot of the indige-nous inhabitants<br />
getting experience., first in a irimitive way and then in a more<br />
advanced way, in tae government of a particular area for<br />
particular purposes, and the longer this goes on, the more<br />
completely do they come to understand local government, the<br />
more fit will they be to engage in general self-government<br />
through a parliamunt when that day comes. Now, Sir, I don't<br />
want to be tedious about this matter,, This nappens to be a<br />
proposition that I have uttered not only here but in many other<br />
parts of the world. I think there is a great lesson in it and<br />
that means that every time an Australian like myself ha s the<br />
opportunity of going into a municipality, of touching even<br />
lightly and casually the sytem of local municipal self-government,<br />
one is reminded that this is not only historically but<br />
functionally one of the great things in a democratic world.<br />
Therefore, Sir, I use no mere form of words when I say<br />
that I am de-lighted to be here and I am honoured to be received<br />
by the Mayor,* This is, of course, to us an elementary truth,<br />
but to many people it is completely unknown.<br />
I wonder Si r, if I might just before I conclude say<br />
this to you: thait there are people who are so young as not to<br />
remember a time when I wasn't Prime Minister. I can remember<br />
it very well, ( Laughter) The first contact I ever had with<br />
what we are pleased to call politics was when I was a small boy<br />
in the bush living in a country shire in Victoria and my father<br />
was one of the shire councillors, and on shire council meeting<br />
day which was perhaps once a fortnight it may have been once<br />
a month in those days down a rather rough track from the town<br />
twenty miles further north came a horse and buggy, the wheels<br />
rattling over the gravel or the unbitumenised miacadalm, as the<br />
case might be. Anyhow, it came rattling and groaning, and my<br />
old man, having addressed my mother and the rest of us powerfully<br />
on the burning issue of the day in the Dimboola Shire Council<br />
about which our own heat was less than his, would mount up into<br />
the buggy with this other mian and they disappeared into the night<br />
0 6 ./ 4 </p>
<p>for another twenty-four miles down the road to a town called<br />
Dimboola. and there they met and conducted their high mysteries.<br />
And a couple of days later, they came back and shed each other.<br />
Now this was my first introduction to the business of government<br />
and when I look back on it and I think how primitive everything<br />
was, how rough and crude the roads were how utterly limited<br />
were the facilities and I look back on Lhose men who devoted a<br />
good deal of their time and no small fraction of their energy<br />
to going down, considering these fellows, arguing with the shire<br />
engineer, being instructed as every sensible councillor is by<br />
the shire clerk ( Laughter) when I think of that, I think that<br />
wasn't a bad introduction Lo the art of government, It preserved<br />
one from having delusions, it made one understand that matters<br />
of less magnitude than may be engaged in by a parliament are<br />
still matters of great importance and that they are not to be<br />
neglected and it is on that foundation, vividly remembered by<br />
me that I think my earliest interest in political affaizrs arose.<br />
I admit there was one other factor ari. that was that<br />
my father who ultimately went into the State Parliament of<br />
Victoria was, unlike me, greatly given to argument. ( Laughter)<br />
He was willing to argue with anybody about anything and in those<br />
early days if you lived in the country, you were a free trader<br />
automatically. The old man wasntt. Having ascertained thiat<br />
all the people in the district were free traders, he became the<br />
highest protectionist my family : ias ever known. ( Laughter)<br />
That was good experience too, wasnt t it, because there is very<br />
frequently great virtue in being different.<br />
tto ankNow, Sir, we must go elsewhere as you know. I want<br />
ttoa nkyou very much for what you have said and if I may say<br />
so to you, on behalf of both of us, it is clear that as was<br />
written in old times, the prayers of a righteous man avail much,<br />
( Laughter) because yours were in reality both well answered. </p>
