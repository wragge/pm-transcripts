PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 16-AUGUST 1981<br />
ELECTROATE TALK<br />
Last week I spoke to you about the nature of the meetings to.<br />
be he ld during this week with employers, the Australian<br />
Council of Trade Unions and with the Premiers. Among other<br />
things, I suggested that too much should not be expected of<br />
the meetings that if we only succeeded in achieving a better.<br />
understanding of where we all stood, of our roles and responsibilities<br />
in thie post-indexation period that alone would be a significant<br />
achievement at this time. I believe that the results of the<br />
meetings, of the thinking and of the talking that went on among<br />
all participants in preparation for them, contained many more<br />
positive elements than has so far been acknowledged by media<br />
commentators. In particular, the meeting with the Premiers resulted in a<br />
joint statement by all Governments which offers constructive<br />
basis for future developments in the wages and industrial<br />
relations area, a statement which received less media<br />
attention than it deserves.<br />
Tefirst, and most important thing to be said is that all<br />
parties to the meetings agreed that the initial community<br />
reactions to the abandonment of the wage indexation system<br />
overlooked the fact that there is a fully functioning wage<br />
determination system, a system that remains in operation, and<br />
which is capable of providing for the fair and orderly treatment<br />
of legitimate wage claims now that indexation has gone. Central<br />
to that system is the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission<br />
which has statutory obligations not merely to seek to resolve<br />
industrial disputes, but also to consider wages and other<br />
industrial claims in the light of the interests of the comm. unity<br />
as a whole, and to take into account the state of the' economy,<br />
especially inflation and employment. The Commission will<br />
h * ear claims that are put to it, and will assess those claims<br />
in terms of its own responsibilities.<br />
It was agreed at the meetings this week, and especially at the<br />
special Premiers' Conference, that it would help in . re-establishing<br />
the system of hearing individual industry pay claims if a major<br />
industry claim could be dealt with soon, so that the guidelines<br />
to be used by the Commission in handling individual cases could<br />
be established, and a possible source of uncertainty-removed.<br />
The Premiers also asked the Confederation of* Australian Industry<br />
and Australian* Council of Trade Unions to agree to consider<br />
how claims currently being made could be brought forward in an.<br />
orderly and equitable manner, and so that the interests of lower<br />
paid, less industrially strong sections of the workforce would.<br />
be given protection. </p>
<p>I -2-<br />
The fact that all of the meetings confirmed a strong commitment<br />
to Australia's centralised wage determination system offers the<br />
* best possible prospect for ensuring that stability prevails.<br />
In one sense, of course, to talk of our system as centralised<br />
is to overlook the fact that-each state has a separate tribunal<br />
for dealing -with state awards.<br />
It was agreed among the Premiers that orderly processing of<br />
wage claims, and fair and consistent treatment of employees<br />
throughout Australia requires that Commonwealth and state<br />
tribunals should develop consistent procedures, and the<br />
Commonwealth and all state Governments have asked the presidents<br />
of their tribunals to meet urgently to work towards this<br />
objective, and to eliminate the dangers of state-by-state<br />
leap-frogging of pay claims.<br />
Individual industry cases are not the only form of wage case<br />
that will occur under the new circumstances. In announcing<br />
its decision to abandon wage indexation, the Arbitration Commission<br />
stated a national wage case would be held in 1982, in which<br />
general economic conditions would be considered. The Commonwealth<br />
and state Governments, in another important decision, committed<br />
themselves to work towards the establishment of agreed<br />
principles that might be put to this national wage case. All<br />
Ministers for Labour have been asked to meet soon to commence<br />
this task. All of these decisions, and the expressions of<br />
attitudes which emerged in the course of the week, provide<br />
proof o~ f the willingness of all participants to recognise their<br />
responsibilities in the wage determination process; to recognise<br />
that the benefits of economic growth should be distributed<br />
across the whole community, not just to the large and<br />
powerful whether businesses or unions; to recognise, therefore,<br />
that there are limits to growth of wages possible in any one<br />
year. For its part, the Commonwealth Government informed all participants<br />
of its view that its role in the new circumstances would be<br />
limited to involvement in major cases, such as the national wage<br />
cases, cases involving claims for reduced standard hours, and.<br />
major industry test cases. There is, I believe, a clear<br />
understanding now emerging that the Commonwealth's ability<br />
to control wages is limited in constitutional terms, and<br />
practical terms. There are indirect means of control through<br />
the Government's influence over the economic climate. These<br />
can be exerted through the Budget, monetary and fiscal policies,<br />
tariffs, and the exchange rate. These can be used in developing<br />
a general economic framework designed to boost the growth of<br />
the economy while acting as a counter against excessive wage<br />
expectations. In any event, we have never sought to control<br />
wages, but rather to seek to ensure that wage growth is consistent<br />
with sustained improvements in the standard of-living.<br />
With the spirit of co-operation revealed at the meetings<br />
this week, and a continued willingness to make the system work,<br />
the prosj. oct for stable industrial relations, and<br />
attainment of those sustained improvements in living standards,<br />
is substantial indeed. </p>
