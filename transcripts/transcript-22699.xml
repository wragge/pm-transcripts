    <content><![CDATA[<p>Thank you very much Kerry Bartlett. To Jim Angel, the Mayor of the City of Blue Mountains; to Senator Helen Coonan, Senator for NSW; the children of the Faulconbridge Public School, in particular a very, very special thanks to them; the local residents of the area, and also those who have chosen to temporarily visit us, for the purpose of today’s gathering.</p>
<p>But I’m here to continue a very long tradition of Australian Prime Ministers on both sides of politics. And that is to plant an Oak tree, to join my 24 predecessors who have helped, or their descendents that I look at these trees, this Corridor of Oaks, and I find that the great bulk of them, and the fact they planted the trees in person. And I feel very humble and very honoured to join my 24 predecessors in this very simple, but very symbolic ceremony. </p>
<p>And in the process we honour one of Australia’s most significant political figures, Sir Henry Parkes, who did more than any other person to bring about the federation of the then Australian colonies in 1901 and to build the Commonwealth of Australia, the Centenary of which we will celebrate together next year.</p>
<p>Ironically of course, Sir Henry Parkes, although he left his mark not only in this local community, because the name of the town of Faulconbridge was of course taken from his mother’s maiden name- Faulconbridge House was built in the 19th Century. He not only left his mark here in the local community, but he left his mark on the State of NSW, and he left his mark of course, on the Commonwealth of Australia. So in many ways, Ladies and Gentlemen, this ceremony which brings together the people of the local community, is both a local ceremony, reminding you of a great son of the Blue Mountains. But it is also a simple, national ceremony, which allows the community to mark in a quiet, dignified, but effective way, the contribution of the now 25 people, who have held the most privileged office that anybody could possibly aspire to, and that is the Office of Prime Minister of Australia.</p>
<p>I won’t of course talk about the contribution of different people of that office, other than to acknowledge that each in his own different way, whatever their political perspectives were, and as I look at the list, I see people with whom I have had profound agreement, such as Sir Robert Menzies, others with whom I’ve had some disagreement on occasions over the years. But we have all of us been united in a commitment and a dedication to the service of our country, to the service of the legal and community ideals in which we believe. One of those great community ideals of course, and one of the great corner stones of Australian democracy, is the right of individuals to express their views, on whatever subject in a lawful, and on occasions, vigorous fashion. </p>
<p>Australian democracy is a vigorous thing, Australian democracy is bound up with the vigorous exchange of views. But in the end, we have always resolved our differences in a peaceful, harmonious way. And whatever political differences we may have, there are one or two things that have shone through the experience of Australian democracy. We are a most tolerant, cohesive society, we are a society that has welcomed people from different parts of the world. Despite the protestations of some, we are a society which is free of racial intolerance and hatred. We are a society which is a proud example to the rest of the world. And we have demonstrated in recent times our capacity to stand up for the principles of liberty and independence. And we have in that sense been an example to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>I want in being here today to thank my colleague and friend, Kerry Bartlett, the Member for Macquarie. I take the opportunity of warmly thanking him for the articulate energetic representation he brings to this very diverse electorate in the National Parliament. I can ensure all of you, who are here, all of his constituents, that he is doing a magnificent job representing you in the national Parliament.</p>
<p>And finally ladies and gentlemen I want to mark this occasion by an exhortation to all Australians, to understand and revere the history of this country. It is a history that has not been without blemish. It is a history of a country which has built a mighty, impressive, powerful, widely admired democracy as we have entered the 21st Century. Australia is one of fewer than 10 nations that remain continuously democratic throughout the entire 2Oth Century. It is a country whose history is rich, it is a country with a history of which we can be proud, whilst recognising that we made mistakes, and allowed injustices and unfair treatment. But if you look at the great balance sheet of Australian history, it is an achievement of which all of us can be immensely proud. And as we come to celebrate the Centenary of the Commonwealth of Australia, it is an opportunity to reflect on that history, it is an opportunity to thank people like Sir Henry Parkes who made such a contribution to the building of the modern Australia. And it’s an opportunity to resolve, to work together to build an even greater nation in the 21st Century.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
