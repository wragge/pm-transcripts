26 March 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
DOORSTOP INTERVIEW DARWIN<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
They're trying to destroy the work-for-the-dole legislation. The very earliest on my<br />
advice that the legislation can be debated is the 23rd of June, which is the last sitting<br />
week before the winter recess. We now face the possibility of months and months of<br />
deliberate obstruction and delay, the Labor party has revealed its true colours on the<br />
work for the dole legislation. It was a very simple Bill. Are you for or against work<br />
for the dole. The Labor party is clearly against it. The Australian people want this<br />
measure. It's one of the elements of our attack on the problem of youth<br />
unemployment. The Labor party and the Democrats are delaying the government's<br />
attempts to tackle the problem of youth unemployment. It is a disgracefuzl delaying<br />
tactic. Kim Beazley said he was in favour of it. What he's doing is allowing or<br />
perhaps being overwhelm~ ed by his colleagues in the Senate to commit a course of<br />
action which is delaying and obstructing this is not a complicated measure, It's a<br />
simple measure. We simply proposed that the restriction on compulsion now in the<br />
Social Security legislation be taken out. And the Labor party is trying to delay,<br />
obstruct and frustrate that. I condemn them and the Australian people will condemn<br />
them. JOURNALIST: You were hoping to; get the pilot projects going I think by September. How much of a<br />
dely wil this mean?<br />
PRiM MINISTER:<br />
Well if it's not dealt with before the winter recess, we won't get them in September.<br />
And our attempt to reduce youth unemiployment will be stymied, obstructed, and<br />
sabotaged by the combined efforts of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian<br />
Democrats. I mean they've got to say yes or no. Are the for this or against it. Clearly </p>

they're pretending they're for it, yet they are by their legislative actions trying to<br />
sabotage and undermine it.<br />
JOURINALIST:<br />
Do you think you'll get it through though eventually?<br />
PRIE MINISTER:<br />
Well we don't control the Senate, despite what some people say. We don't. And if<br />
this measure doesn't go through it will strike a body blow at the prospects we have of<br />
reducing youth unemployment. It's one of the elements of our attack on youth<br />
unemployment. It has widespread community support. We want to get the pilots<br />
going by September. We'll make the additional money available, and the Labor Party<br />
and the Democrats are playing explosive politics with an attempt by the Federal<br />
Government to tackle youth unemployment. They ought to be ashamed of themselves.<br />
JOURNALISTPrime Minister the opposition parties have said from the beginning thought that there<br />
are concerns about the open-endedness, or the permanency of the compulsion clause<br />
which is what it's all about. They've also said there were questions about training.<br />
They might want to move some amendments. I mean, isn't this just the democratic<br />
process at work?<br />
PRME MINISTER:<br />
No, this is obstruction. I mean you're either for or against this. It's a very simple<br />
principle. It's not complicated. We're simply saying that in 1997 it is reasonable for<br />
the community to say of people who are guaranteed a safety net that they should at<br />
award rates be prepared to do something in return for that guaranteed safety net. Now<br />
it's a good, sound, fair go principle. Are you for it or against it? We are for it. The<br />
Australian Labor Party and the Democrats are against it.<br />
