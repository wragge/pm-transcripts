<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p> KNIGHT:</p>
<p> Prime Minister, John Howard, good morning.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> How are you Ben?</p>
<p> KNIGHT:</p>
<p> Thank you very much. I thought we'd talk this morning</p>
<p> about Telstra and it just seems to me that it's looking less likely</p>
<p> that the remaining part will be sold. Apart from anything else how would</p>
<p> you get it through the Senate?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well you can only get it through the Senate if one way</p>
<p> or another the majority of Senators vote for it and I don't believe</p>
<p> in the end when, if we get a positive inquiry and as a greater realisation</p>
<p> of the benefits of Telstra spreads in the community I think in the end</p>
<p> the Senate will vote to get it through. I mean people said we wouldn't</p>
<p> get one third of it sold before the 1996 election. You can't go on</p>
<p> indefinitely with the camel like arrangement we have at the moment.</p>
<p> KNIGHT:</p>
<p> Why not?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Because it constrains Telstra.</p>
<p> KNIGHT:</p>
<p> But we have seen them just sign a fairly hefty contract</p>
<p> in Hong Kong.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Yes that's true but you realise that they can't</p>
<p> issue any... they can't raise any equity in order to finance deals</p>
<p> like that because if they do so they dilute government ownership and that's</p>
<p> not permitted by law and the government's not going to use tax payers</p>
<p> money to buy shares in Telstra, that would be absurd and a waste of tax</p>
<p> payers money. So there is a major constraint on the company.</p>
<p>  And there's also a mistaken belief that the more</p>
<p> government ownership you have the more efficient it is. When it was 100%</p>
<p> government owned it was called Telecom, it was not more efficient, it</p>
<p> was less efficient. It has in fact improved a lot and what people in country</p>
<p> Australia are saying to me is, we don't believe that government ownership</p>
<p> makes it more efficient but we don't think it's good enough</p>
<p> yet and we would like to see it improve even further. Now that's</p>
<p> fair enough. Only a few days ago Telstra announced an investment of $340</p>
<p> million in upgrading the network in rural Australia.</p>
<p> KNIGHT:</p>
<p> Which has been pretty well received.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Yes and it's a very important decision that because</p>
<p> what that will do is really address the basic infrastructure which goes</p>
<p> directly to how well it provides the basic phone service and there are</p>
<p> other benefits for rural Australia coming out of the proceeds of the second</p>
<p> sale of shares in Telstra.</p>
<p> KNIGHT:</p>
<p> I understand there was $150 million, which was earmarked</p>
<p> from the sale of T2 as its known that was specifically for rural and regional</p>
<p> areas. It took quite some time for that to get out. Do you think that</p>
<p> was a mistake?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No, no, hang on it didn't, I mean we didn't</p>
<p> get the money until October of last year and we then had to do a scoping</p>
<p> study of what would be the best way and we are now dealing with that and</p>
<p> that money will begin to flow. But you've got to remember that we</p>
<p> didn't, you know the money didn't come in until October of last</p>
<p> year so I don't think people can say... I mean we would have had</p>
<p> it a lot earlier if we hadn't been mucked around in the Senate by</p>
<p> the Labor Party. I mean you can't sort of have it both ways. People</p>
<p> can't say, well we're against any sale but hang on why didn't</p>
<p> we have the money earlier.</p>
<p> KNIGHT:</p>
<p> Yes. Let's, let's just...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I mean I... if they let it... you know... if</p>
<p> they let the legislation for the sale of the rest of it go through there</p>
<p> would be a lot more acceleration of infrastructure spending. I mean we</p>
<p> will provide infrastructure money irrespective of whether the rest of</p>
<p> Telstra is sold or not. The point I make is that you'll be able to</p>
<p> do more and do it more quickly if we could sell the rest.</p>
<p> KNIGHT:</p>
<p> Well one of the arguments that of course is for the sale</p>
<p> of the remainder of Telstra is that you're able to take that money,</p>
<p> you're able to go into regional areas and give basically world's</p>
<p> best technology, bring those areas up to speed but you know that the way</p>
<p> technology moves in twenty years it will be obsolete so what happens then</p>
<p> when you don't have a Telstra to sell?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well that's, I mean, you know I don't just</p>
<p> say that the reason...that's not the only reason for selling Telstra.</p>
<p> I mean of course technology changes but of course so do market players</p>
<p> and one of the things that has made the cost of telecommunications cheaper</p>
<p> for many Australians, indeed for most Australians is that there is more</p>
<p> competition now. Years ago when you had just one player, the old Telecom,</p>
<p> you had no competition at all. They not only had a monopoly but they charged</p>
<p> like wounded bulls. I mean the cost of telecommunications in this country</p>
<p> has fallen very significantly and that's fallen because there has</p>
<p> been more exposure to market conditions and there's been more competition</p>
<p> and that in a sense is what the full privatisation of Telstra is all about</p>
<p> now. Mr Beazley is arguing against it, argued the opposite way when he</p>
<p> was in government. I have no doubt that if he were to win the next election</p>
<p> he'd find a reason to change what he's now saying and hope that</p>
<p> we would do the right thing in opposition and pass the bill through the</p>
<p> Senate.</p>
<p> KNIGHT:</p>
<p> I ask you about using the proceeds, the earnings of Telstra</p>
<p> rather than the money from the sale because this point has been raised</p>
<p> by the Opposition. They have said that it would have been more profitable</p>
<p> to use the income from Telstra than to use the money from the sale to</p>
<p> achieve interest savings.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well we don't agree with that. I mean they don't</p>
<p> seem to have made proper allowance for the fact that we've paid off</p>
<p> a lot of debt and if you pay off a lot of government debt you're</p>
<p> paying less interest on it.</p>
<p> KNIGHT:</p>
<p> But it is a good earner.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well nobody's saying it doesn't provide a dividend</p>
<p> and equally I'm not saying that the public debt interest savings</p>
<p> are the only reason why you are selling it, I mean there are other reasons.</p>
<p> But the principle reason why you sell it is that we believe in the long</p>
<p> run operating in market conditions it will be more efficient and it will</p>
<p> provide a better service to its customers and the best illustration of</p>
<p> the strength of that argument is to remember back to when you had no competition</p>
<p> in telecommunications in the old Telecom.</p>
<p> KNIGHT:</p>
<p> But the same thing could be said to apply to banks and</p>
<p> they certainly haven't distinguished themselves in terms of rural</p>
<p> service I would have thought.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> No but you've got to ask yourself would things have</p>
<p> been any better if the old Commonwealth Bank had remained in government</p>
<p> ownership. I mean the old Commonwealth Bank was of course sold by Mr Beazley</p>
<p> when, with our support, because we supported privatisation but you've</p>
<p> got to remember that we have lower interest rates now partly because there's</p>
<p> more competition in the financial system.</p>
<p>  In all of these things you've got to ask the question</p>
<p> what would things have been like if the government had continued to owned</p>
<p> something. And when governments own businesses they are normally undistinguished</p>
<p> performers and that has been the long experience and I don't think</p>
<p> it's any different in relation to Telstra.</p>
<p>  The thing that should be remembered Ben is that you don't</p>
<p> need government ownership to guarantee standards of service delivery we</p>
<p> have...</p>
<p> KNIGHT:</p>
<p> Why?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well because you can legislate for them which we have</p>
<p> done and the strongest argument for those who say look if the government</p>
<p> lets go our services will decline is for me to say to them those service</p>
<p> guarantees, those levels of service are guaranteed by legislation and</p>
<p> that legislation will continue to operate to support the delivery of those</p>
<p> services long after the government has sold its shares in Telstra.</p>
<p> KNIGHT:</p>
<p> When the inquiry comes back to you on Telstra I'm</p>
<p> expecting that it will mention some of the stories that we've covered</p>
<p> on this program relating to Telstra; call centres in the country are likely</p>
<p> to be closed; the CDMA roll out does not match the analogue system as</p>
<p> promised; pagers are being phased out in Victoria which means the CFA</p>
<p> is being stranded on its communications and it still takes longer than</p>
<p> it does in the city to get technical service. How then do you argue that</p>
<p> through the Senate?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well I think I should have a look at the inquiry results</p>
<p> before I pass judgement on that but what we have said is that it's</p>
<p> a condition of us proceeding further to get a satisfactory tick off from</p>
<p> that inquiry and that inquiry is completely independent and if that inquiry</p>
<p> comes back and says look we're satisfied here and here but we're</p>
<p> not satisfied over here then we will have to satisfy over there before</p>
<p> we go ahead. That was always the Government's policy. We're</p>
<p> not just going through the motions of having an inquiry.</p>
<p>  And I have no doubt that you can always improve things</p>
<p> and I have no doubt that there is still a lot of room for improvement</p>
<p> in the bush as far as Telstra is concerned, I've never argued otherwise.</p>
<p> I would simply say though that some years ago when Telecom was fully government</p>
<p> owned things were even worse, much worse. The service delivery by Telstra</p>
<p> has improved in many areas even though it is still short of what it is</p>
<p> in city areas and I can understand why country people don't like</p>
<p> that. We are putting extra resources both out of the budget and Telstra</p>
<p> is separately, such as the customer access network investment of $340</p>
<p> million. Those things are going to improve services further but we're</p>
<p> going to look very seriously at this inquiry and if it says look it's</p>
<p> not up to the mark in these particular areas well we'll want some</p>
<p> action before we would ask the parliament to authorise the sale of the</p>
<p> rest of Telstra, that has always been our position.</p>
<p> KNIGHT:</p>
<p> And that's where we'll have to leave it. Thanks</p>
<p> for coming in.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> You're very welcome.</p>
