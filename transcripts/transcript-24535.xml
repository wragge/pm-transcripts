    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today the Commonwealth and New South Wales Governments announced further assistance for storm-affected primary producers in the Hunter and Central Coast.</p>
<p>Clean up and recovery grants of up to $15,000 will be provided to farmers recovering from damage caused by severe flooding and storms.</p>
<p>The grants, funded under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, are available in the local government areas of Dungog, Great Lakes, Maitland, Newcastle, Port Stephens, Singleton and to parishes of Branxton, Heddon and Stockrington.</p>
<p>Oyster growers in Port Stephens and Brisbane Waters are also eligible.</p>
<p>This builds on shorter-term assistance provided to these communities and will help primary producers to repair or replace equipment, salvage crops, grain and feed supplies and to restore pastures.</p>
<p>We are committed to ensuring that beef and dairy farmers, egg producers, oyster growers and others are able return to normal as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth and NSW Governments have also allocated $145,000 to the Dungog Community Support Worker Project to provide practical and emotional support to families and individuals who experienced significant damage and distress.</p>
<p>Primary producers in the flood affected areas should contact the NSW Rural Assistance Authority on 1800 678 593 to see if they are eligible for the grant.</p>
