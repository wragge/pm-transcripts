    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Coalition Joint Party Room has today overwhelmingly endorsed</p>
<p> a draft preamble to the Federal Constitution to be put to the Australian</p>
<p> people in conjunction with the referendum on whether Australia should</p>
<p> become a republic later this year.</p>
<p>In issuing the text of that draft the Federal Government is inviting</p>
<p> public comment on it and that comment will be considered before the</p>
<p> final preamble document is put to the Australian electorate.</p>
<p>The preamble itself will be a schedule to an Act authorising the matter</p>
<p> to be submitted to a referendum. That legislation will be circulated</p>
<p> by the Federal Attorney-General, the Hon Daryl Williams MP.</p>
<p>The legislation will contain a clause declaring that the preamble</p>
<p> has no legal force or effect and cannot be invoked in the interpretation</p>
<p> of the Commonwealth Constitution. The text of the draft preamble approved</p>
<p> by the Joint Party Room is attached.</p>
<p>With hope in God, the Commonwealth of Australia is constituted by</p>
<p> the equal sovereignty of all its citizens.</p>
<p>The Australian nation is woven together of people from many ancestries</p>
<p> and arrivals.</p>
<p>Our vast island continent has helped to shape the destiny of our Commonwealth</p>
<p> and the spirit of its people.</p>
<p>Since time immemorial our land has been inhabited by Aborigines and</p>
<p> Torres Strait Islanders, who are honoured for their ancient and continuing</p>
<p> cultures.</p>
<p>In every generation immigrants have brought great enrichment to our</p>
<p> nation's life.</p>
<p>Australians are free to be proud of their country and heritage, free</p>
<p> to realise themselves as individuals, and free to pursue their hopes</p>
<p> and ideals. We value excellence as well as fairness, independence</p>
<p> as dearly as mateship.</p>
<p>Australia's democratic and federal system of government exists</p>
<p> under law to preserve and protect all Australians in an equal dignity</p>
<p> which may never be infringed by prejudice or fashion or ideology nor</p>
<p> invoked against achievement.</p>
<p>In this spirit we, the Australian people, commit ourselves to this</p>
<p> Constitution.</p>
