THE DUKEB AND DUCHESS OF GL'OU CSM~ K<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA 23RD ivltJLCH. 1965<br />
Speech by the Prime Hnise, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Mengieg.<br />
,,..,,,.. proposing the toast of our distinguished guests who<br />
ar no newcomers in this place, but had in fact toaope in their<br />
own time with Ministers of the Crown and, occasionally I have<br />
no doubt, put them right.<br />
Sir I remember the first time you came here<br />
. because I was at that time something of a new boy in Canberra,<br />
I came here in October of 1934 and you arrived am I right<br />
in thinking? i-in November, 191,4 on a Royal Visit, and this<br />
is quite memorable because the rain fell, ( We've had no rain<br />
here this year) It rained and it rained and it rained most<br />
indiscriminately, and the Molongolo, that noble strea flooded,<br />
I have always been indebted to you, Sir, for having arranged<br />
that because it was the first time I had a vivid picture of<br />
what a lake would look like in Canberra. ( Laughter) And from<br />
that time on, I began work hoping that it might arise.<br />
Then, Sir, of course, you were out here as<br />
Governor-General, and you, Ma'am as the Governor-General's<br />
waife, and I know perhaps better Lhan most people what an<br />
affection you conceived for this country. This is indeed most<br />
important because in all these more recent years whenever I<br />
have gone to England, you have overwhelmed me ana my wife and<br />
other people with great kindness and I have never been left<br />
in any doubt that Australia has a place in your hearts which<br />
you would not always want to make vocal but which is perfectly<br />
obvious and has been perfectly obvious to those who have seen<br />
you. S Therefore it gave me immense pleasure to be able<br />
to take a hand in arranging this journey of yours this time.<br />
This is not a pompous journey; this is not a journey to be<br />
richly adorned by illuminated addresses. This is a journey<br />
in which you are coming to a country which you love and in which<br />
you are going to see old friends whom you have known, Indeed,<br />
I think Sir this is perhaps the only unhappy occasion, from<br />
your point ol view, on which you may have to make a speech,<br />
I want to tell you that His Royal Highness, as a<br />
former Governor-General, has a sturdy disregard for speeches.<br />
( Laughter) He probably had to listen to a number of them<br />
when he was here. He will have to listen to what I have just<br />
been saying, and when he has made his I am going to ask<br />
Arthur Calwell to speak to associate he Opposition with this<br />
welcome. But Sir, and Ma ' am, the main thing I want to<br />
establish in the few words that I utter is that you are old<br />
friends and that you are back here among old friends, This,<br />
I think, is something that matters to you and matters to us,<br />
We hope you have a marvellous time. ' Je have had the great<br />
pleasure in Australia of seeing your two sons here A'lliam<br />
and Richard, in their time, and we have been greatly taken by<br />
both of them. Rather nice to think that in many, many years<br />
to come the former Governor-General and his wife will be<br />
recalled by their sons who I have not the slightest doubt<br />
will continue to maintain a lively interest in Australia. * aaa/ 2 </p>
<p>. OP -2-<br />
Now, Sir, I know you don't like listening to<br />
speeches but must tell one story would you mind Sir?<br />
His rloyal Highness was President of the Australian hlub in<br />
London one year when I stepped out of the Australian summer<br />
into the English winter and got the next best thing to<br />
pneumonia whatever the next best thing may be and I was<br />
booked to make a speech at the Australian Club dowrnstairs in<br />
the Savoy and I had a high temperatures I think about 103.<br />
I was advised by a medical man and medical men are always<br />
disagreeable, that I must cancel it. I said, " But I can't.,<br />
I can't, I am booked to do this, This is for me." So I<br />
struggled into that garment of the subservient a stiff shirt<br />
and a white tie and I went down belowI and stood in the line<br />
with His Royal Highness for a while and then we went in and<br />
finally I got up to make a speech the first time I ever made<br />
a speech to a collection of clouds, because that's all I<br />
could see, I didnt know whether I began a sentence or ended<br />
a sentence and when I sat down, I turned round almost<br />
despairingly to the ? aoyal chairman and said, " Sir, could you<br />
understand a word I said? You know, I have a very high<br />
temperature." And he looked at me with a mixture of affection<br />
and contempt and said, " iOn the contrary, I have never heard you<br />
better." 1 ( Iaughter) So there we are.<br />
elSL,, we have never seen you better, Ma'am,<br />
welve never seen you better. we grieved for you for the<br />
troubles that you have been through. You really have had a<br />
rough time, but I have no doubt whatever that with the weather,<br />
the friendships, the comfort the quietness as I would hope<br />
that you will experience in Xustralia, you will go back feeling<br />
completely fit. l-adies and gentlemen Their Royal Highnessesi </p>
