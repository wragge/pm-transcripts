    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that Prime Minister Helen Clark of New Zealand will visit Canberra on Wednesday 8 February for our annual trans-Tasman talks.</p>
<p>  Australia and New Zealand share a uniquely close relationship, reflected in wide-ranging political, economic, foreign policy, cultural and other co-operation.  Our two countries continue to be natural partners and the closer integration achieved between Australia and New Zealand in recent years has contributed substantially to both countries' economic well-being and given us a direct stake in each other's continued success and prosperity.</p>
<p>  We will be discussing a range of bilateral regional and international issues including our joint commitment to playing a constructive international role in the Asia Pacific region. </p>
