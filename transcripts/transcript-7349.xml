PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 4 JULY 1988<br />
I have sent the following message to Prime Minister Namallu<br />
of Papua New Guinea:<br />
" Dear Rabbie<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government and people I<br />
congratulate you on assuming the office of Prime<br />
Minister. I recall with pleasure our meetings in Port<br />
Moresby and Canberra when you were a Minister in earlier<br />
Governments. I look forward to working closely with you<br />
to further the very important relationship between our<br />
two friendly, neighbouring countries, and to pursuing<br />
our mutual interests within the region.<br />
I hope to see you at the Forum Meeting in September<br />
where, as you will be aware, there are a number of<br />
important regional issues to be discussed.<br />
Bob Hawke"<br />
I intend to telephone Mr Namaliu later this evening to<br />
convey my congratulations personally. 145 </p>
