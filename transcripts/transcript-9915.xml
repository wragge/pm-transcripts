TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
THE MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, SPORT AND TERRITORIES,<br />
SEN THE HON JOHN FAULKNER AND MINISTER FOR PRIMARY<br />
INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY, SEN THE HON BOB COLLINS, JOINT<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, ALBURY, WEDNESDAY, 24 JANUARY 1996<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I'll begin by saying that it is a great pleasure to be here in Albury and<br />
to be -here making a major statement with my colleagues on the<br />
envirp6ment and. sustainable land management in Australia and to be<br />
doing it at a place where we have a role and a commitment we<br />
meaning the Commonwealth in a Cooperative Research Centre on<br />
water ecosystems and water management and quality ' ery nicely<br />
dovetails in with the strategy and the philosophy and the policies that<br />
we have articulated today.<br />
There is no doubt that the magnitude of the challenge in dealing with<br />
the environment in Australia is a very great one because, I think, those<br />
with environmental consciousness in Australia realise that to deal with<br />
it we are dealing not only with the big icon areas such as Shoalwater<br />
Bay and Jervis Bay and the Gordon Below Franklin and Kakadu and<br />
the rest or beyond that to the big issue of the forests but that the<br />
environment in Australia also means tackling difficult issues such as<br />
biodiversity and land management, knowing as we all know that the<br />
land has been degraded over the 200 years since European<br />
settlement. Now it is the responsibility of this generation to actually deal with the<br />
problem, not to wait to put it off any longer, but to actually look at it on<br />
an integrated basis as a whole. So questions such as land use<br />
management, dry land salinity, the problems of the rivers, river flows,<br />
endangered species, biodiversity all of these issues are issues which<br />
this government is prepared to tackle and that we believe must be<br />
tackled. So, I think, this is an outstanding package in anyone's language. It is<br />
the biggest environmental policy that any Commonwealth government ' I </p>
<p>has, as an integrated whole, ever introduced, It signals meeting the<br />
environmental challenge, that it must be met and will be met and that<br />
the problems of the environment will remain a central priority of the<br />
Labor government that will be returned after the coming election. It<br />
means that just on half a billion dollars will be spent, I think in a way<br />
which now builds on the existing programs we have had and the<br />
existing successes we have had and they are many, including<br />
involving the community through great movements such as Landcare,<br />
in getting farmers interested in whole of farm property management, in<br />
focusing on these really intractable problems like long term salinity and<br />
rising water tables. These can't be done by governments and by<br />
departments. They can be done only with governments and the<br />
community, drawing the community in. And, of course, going beyond<br />
that to making clear where we stand on one of the big issues and that<br />
is, of course, pulling a more comprehensive reserve system together in<br />
Australia and with the Australian states. This is something we are very<br />
committed to.<br />
I'd like to take this opportunity of complimenting my colleagues. If we<br />
look back at the problems of recent memory, the drought and in<br />
dealing with it, support of the rural economy and rural communities, the<br />
chatldge of the environment, the forests, and bringing all this together<br />
in this statement, I don't think any two ministers have ever done more<br />
together, have been able to present a more comprehensive package, a<br />
more comprehensive approach to the real problems of the Australian<br />
environment, threading them together, weaving them together, making<br />
them work as an -integrated whole. That is what I hope the community<br />
will see from this package today. I want to thank them and compliment<br />
them and I know, on behalf of all those people out there that are<br />
interested in the environment in this country today, a very good thing<br />
has been done.<br />
BC: Can I just say briefly that after the work that was actually put into this<br />
package and because he is here, I must say I was delighted to hear<br />
this morning the comments made, that I know were off-the-cuff, by a<br />
scientist with the research credentials of the Director of this CIRC who<br />
picked up the major policy underpinning this package. And that is, he<br />
is quite right in fact, it is the first time that any government has ever put<br />
together an integrated package that links together the economic<br />
sustainability of rural Australia with environmental sustainability.<br />
The point the Prime Minister made in his speech is very salient one in<br />
that respect. Sixty per cent of our entire land mass in Australia is<br />
managed by farmers. You can't, in the real world, expect farmers with<br />
the best will in the world to introduce what are expensive<br />
environmental programs unless they are economically viable. That is<br />
really the underpinning of this package. It is a $ 176 million boost to<br />
Landcare which, I'm sure everyone that is involved in Landc-re will be<br />
delighted to hear today. It could effectively be called Landcare Mark 1I. </p>
<p>That, in fact, is what everybody has been talking about. We are five<br />
years through the decade. Our original commitment was $ 320 million<br />
for the whole 10 years, this package in fact, increases the total<br />
commitment to over $ 1 billion, but it does one very important thing.<br />
The Landcare response has been overwhelming. We were<br />
anticipating 1000 groups maybe by the year 2000. It is 2500 already.<br />
What the demand is from farmers, from environmental groups is to<br />
provide resources for on ground works now that we have got that<br />
network of people out there. That is what this does. It actually<br />
provides enough funding in here.<br />
Our experience has shown us since we started Landcare, that in order<br />
to get a result on the ground you have got to seed about half a million<br />
dollars of Commonwealth money into a particular catchment. This<br />
funding provides enough funding to fund that level of funding for every<br />
major catchment in Australia. One hundred and forty catchments<br />
across Australia will be able to have integrated plans developed with<br />
this package that will actually deliver on ground works. It is a very<br />
substantial advance on Landcare.<br />
The property management planning part of it, I know, is going to be<br />
warmIy welcomed by farmers. This effectively provides, just to give<br />
you one bit of detail about it, up to a 75 per cent subsidy on interest<br />
rates for farmers who want to borrow money to improve the<br />
sustainability of their property. For example, in Shepparton just near<br />
here, last year I went to a dairy were a young farmer who had taken<br />
aver the property from his parents completely reorganised all of the<br />
water effluent from the diary and so on. So it was a completely self<br />
contained diary with nothing going into the streams, everything<br />
contained on the farm. It was an expensive thing to do and this<br />
package will actually encourage a-whole lot more young farmers like<br />
him and give them a real economic incentive to go ahead and do that.<br />
So, it is a very integrated package.<br />
On the Murray-Darling and I'll finish on this point, I know that Don<br />
Blackmore is like a dog with two tails today, that Council over the last<br />
two years, the Murray-Darling, initiative was an initiative of this<br />
Government. The Commission was established by this Government in<br />
1988 and this has been a substantial boost to the work that was done.<br />
This package, in fact, has come out of a water audit in which there was<br />
some publicity earlier this year, you may recall it. The water audit was<br />
commenced two years ago and the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial<br />
Council took the most important decision we have ever taken in July<br />
last year where we stopped all further diversionary flows from the<br />
Murray-Darling system. This package is a direct result of that. It will<br />
enable something like 1600 kilometres of river banks and stream<br />
banks, riparian zones as they are called, to be rehabilitated. It will<br />
enable the complete management catchment plans for every major </p>
<p>catchment in the Murray-Darling Basin to be completed. It will enable<br />
a substantial decrease, we estimate in the vicinity of 40 per cent<br />
reduction, in the amount of nutrients and chemical pollutants that are<br />
going into the river. It is a major advance of the Murray-Darling which<br />
will give us the tools to actually arrest the degradation.<br />
I want to conclude on one final point. Both of these schemes<br />
Landcare and the Murray-Darling are marked by one thing they have<br />
in common. They both leave enormous additional funds from both the<br />
community groups and industry. Landcare does that spectacularly, but<br />
so does the Murray-Darling and, in fact, the Murray-Darling Basin<br />
Commission. has formally advised me since the package was<br />
announced that they estimate that with this level of Commonwealth<br />
government seeding a total package of $ 600 million will, in fact, result<br />
on the experience since 1988 from both State, local governments and<br />
industry.<br />
JF: If I can just say that ther is no doubt about this being a tremendous<br />
boost to biodiversity conservation in this country. The sort of<br />
integration that you have heard about is just a magnificent<br />
achievement in my view for the government. These programs, they<br />
have , vo elements protection and production. That is what Landcare<br />
is all about and with it in relation to the environmental aspects of this<br />
package, we have really been able to deliver on protection of<br />
Australia's biodiversity and we have done that through the most<br />
creative set of measures in relation to the expansion of our national<br />
reserve system as well as dealing with those very important issues in<br />
relation to off reserve conservation.<br />
So, I think, this is a great result for the environment. A terrific result for<br />
the protection of Australia's biodiversity.<br />
PM: Thank you John. I think any one of us are happy to deal with your<br />
questions.<br />
J: Senator Collins, what about the problem of sewerage and I know steps<br />
were taken last year as you said in terms of irrigation, but is there<br />
more to be done there, some have been critical, saying that these are<br />
the sorts of really hard decisions?<br />
BC: Yes, a lot more needs to be done and I might add I guess it is a<br />
degradation of euphemisms, I suppose, I used an even softer<br />
euphemism I called it nutrient and you called it sewerage, you could<br />
call it something else I guess if you wanted to, but when I said that this<br />
package will be able to reduce by a very large percentage the amount<br />
of nutrients into the system we are also talking about the sewerage<br />
outflows. People don't appreciate, and they don't, the extent to which<br />
the Murray-Darling basin is actually managed today. We are pumping<br />
800 tonnes of salt a day out of the Murray-Darling Basin now. The fact<br />
7-1 R 4 y<br />
j~-S </p>
<p>is, that if we weren't engaged in the massive management practices<br />
we are now that Basin would be unsustainable now. The significance<br />
of that, of course, is that it produces almost half the total agricultural<br />
output of this country and when you have got an audit that took two<br />
years to complete, that says to you in black and white, that if the<br />
existing practices continue then the use of water, and I am almost<br />
quoting, it exactly in that Basin will become unsustainable by the turn<br />
of the century that is five years from now it does attract your<br />
attention. I am very pleased to say that, acting on the advise of the Commission<br />
and that is where this package came from, we can confidently say that<br />
this level of Commonwealth funding will actually result in arresting that<br />
degradation. I might also say on a personal note and I have got to say<br />
this here today sometime, after 18 years in this business I am really<br />
tickled by this constant theme that because you have been in<br />
government for 13 years that somehow or other that means that you<br />
have run out of ideas. Well, for people who actually have that view<br />
chew on this.<br />
J: Prime ' Minister, true is it not that there is on these subjects a certain<br />
degrei of bipartisanship. The Coalition has also said that they think<br />
that land care is important, they have announced funding for<br />
revegetation. Why is your plan so much better?<br />
PM: Because it is the plan of the conceivers and authors of the policy that<br />
is why. The flippant press statements published by the Opposition,<br />
John Howard's appalling statement which he made and I have it, Bob<br />
responded to it, in October 1995, there is a South Australian<br />
Employers Chamber of Commerce mentioning the Murray-Darling,<br />
talking about catch up politics. It was a plight on Australian journalism<br />
that that media release was ever reported. The Government<br />
established the Murray-Darling Commission in 1988. We have spent<br />
$ 400 million so far on it. I have committed myself as Prime Minister<br />
very much to the problems of land management in Australia. I had the<br />
pleasure of visiting the Sunraysia district to look at drip irrigation some<br />
time ago, a couple of years ago now I think, and also on the very point<br />
that Senator Collins mentioned about salt in the river, of pressing the<br />
button on one of the pumping stations just up river from Mildura, taking<br />
one of the underground aquifers and pumping it into a salt pan. A part<br />
of that 800 tonnes a day which is changing the nature and quality of<br />
the river.<br />
It has only been the Labor Party that has made these commitments to<br />
the environment. You have got John Howard and his party now saying<br />
the external affairs power shouldn't be used, the world heritage powers<br />
which have flowed from that constitutional authority have, of course,<br />
been an important part of the development of an integrated<br />
environment policy. They have no policy on forests, none, and we<br />
-U r--i </p>
<p>have introduced with that target of 15 per cent of the reserve system<br />
that reflected what obtained before European settlement. I mean the<br />
Labor Party will be the only party going into this election with an<br />
environment policy total environment policy and this goes, also, for<br />
the Greens and for others.<br />
It is only a party of government that can make environmental policy<br />
stick. This is not something that individuals can do individual people<br />
in the Senate, or the House of Representatives, or minor parties.<br />
This is a business for the parties of government and the only party of<br />
government interested in the environment in this comprehensive,<br />
whole way is the Labor Party. It only ever has been the Labor Party.<br />
And if we are living now with the problems of massive land clearance,<br />
and what have you, it is because of the view taken over many years.<br />
In fact, the first thing I did as Treasurer, the very first thing I did, was to<br />
remove deductions for land clearing in the year of expenditure,<br />
the very first thing I did 13 years ago.<br />
J: But, Prime Minister, a few months ago John Howard made a speech<br />
about Asia and he talked about Australia becoming a supermarket into<br />
Asia:. " Now, today, you are talking about something called the Asia<br />
Food 2000 Strategy. He is going to say you pinched his idea.<br />
PM: Oh, cut it out, cut it out.<br />
BC: Fair go.<br />
PM: Now I don't mind being questioned. But I do object to being offended<br />
with silly questions. It is an impertinence for this reason: that the<br />
Agri-Food Council was established by the government for this very<br />
purpose. I mean you might recall me attending a meeting with it in Orange last<br />
year about these very subjects. You might recall that I have<br />
established an inquiry with Bob Collins and Laurie Brereton about how<br />
we get time-sensitive exports air freighted out of Australia, what the air<br />
freight impediments might be, how we can actually bring whole land in<br />
production and not see it lost to salinity or water table problems.<br />
I mean dealing with the problems of the Sunraysia, or the water table<br />
problems of the Goulbumrn Valley our success there in managing<br />
water table issues in the dairy production areas of the<br />
Goulbum Valley.<br />
Cheap press statements by oppositions who have no thought for these<br />
issues at all. Bear in mind there were 23 years of Coalition<br />
government where the National Party had a major influence and did<br />
they do anything about dry land salinity, water tables, land clearance,<br />
t 7. jk'. </p>
<p>you know? Has John Howard got any record on these issues ever?<br />
None. No where.<br />
J: Is the Federal Government committed to funding the Research Centre<br />
here?<br />
PM: Well the whole Cooperative Research Centre programs are funded by<br />
the Commonwealth, they are our programs.<br />
BC: Wouldn't have got off the ground without us.<br />
PM: Wouldn't be here without us. The whole CRC movement is ours.<br />
We have put now I think, from memory, about $ 800 million and we now<br />
have about $ 1600 million, from memory, of private funding which has<br />
joined us. So we have got a very large amount of money now going<br />
into Cooperative Research Centres. I mean this one here, which I was<br />
very pleased to be involved today in the laboratory, on water<br />
eco-systems. You know you can find other ones on hard wood<br />
technology, or remote sensing, or whatever it might be.<br />
BC: I mi~ 1t just add too in respect of those previous questions.<br />
Commbnwealth ' Ministers have chaired the Murray-Darling Ministerial<br />
Council ever since it was set up. It was a Commonwealth initiative.<br />
I have chaired it for the last two years and you know the reality of<br />
John Howard's contribution to this debate. He told somebody in his<br />
office to draft a press statement. That is it. You find anything else.<br />
In fact, I took the trouble to have a look at the Parliamentary Database,<br />
I pushed the button on it and I typed in Murray-Darling and<br />
John Howard and it came up with a blank screen. And you do the<br />
same. John Howard, in fact, has said nothing about the<br />
Murray-Darling Basin since he has been in Parliament. Now I only<br />
went back to 1981, you can go back beyond that if you like.<br />
J: Prime Minister, there is an election coming up. $ 463 million worth of<br />
funding. What would you say to voters who would simply dismiss this<br />
as an election ploy?<br />
PM: Simply that it builds on existing programs. I mean Landcare was<br />
developed by this government.<br />
BC: It has been two years in the making.<br />
PM: It has brought people to it. We have brought this policy together from<br />
the policy structures we have built and the success of them. So there<br />
is the continuity here and this is announced by a government and<br />
things we announce, of this kind, wAil of course be as would announce<br />
things in a Budget, or if we were to announce things in any other<br />
context. </p>
<p>But, I think, the success of it is we know that no matter how committed<br />
a government is to these issues, you need the community to do it.<br />
You need it in land management, you need it in whole farm<br />
management and planning, you need it with the States in respect of<br />
Reserves Systems, etc. And the real world nature of this statement is<br />
not only the funding commitments, but the fact that we are building on<br />
that community support we have already garnered and which is now<br />
growing at a pace.<br />
J: Prime Minister, the government has had a few spats with the<br />
environment movement. You have underlined the size and scope of<br />
this policy, particularly the innovation work. Do you expect this policy<br />
to overcome the individual differences you may have had with green<br />
groups over forests or other isolated issues and win unambiguous<br />
support from the environment movement in the coming election?<br />
PM: Well, I think, if the ACF's release today is an indication of that, the<br />
answer will be yes. But, of course, you won't win everyone in the<br />
environment movement. There are the people with an environment<br />
consciousness in the environment movement, and there are political<br />
people looking for seats in Parliament who are calling themselves<br />
green' They are not the environment movement. They are a political<br />
party trying to draw down the public support of environment movement<br />
policies, or the imperatives of the environment movement.<br />
So for those who are conscientiously committed, who know that only a<br />
government can do these things, who know that to deal with the<br />
forests, or to deal with the landscape, or to deal with biodiversity, or<br />
the reefs, or any of it, can only be done by a government. It is to those<br />
people, those conscientious Australians, interested appropriately<br />
interested in the environment that, I think, this package has the<br />
integrity and the appeal. The truth, the belief about it that is not going<br />
to be there with someone trying to find a seat in the Senate or in a<br />
minor party.<br />
J: But, surely, Prime Minister you can't say that Bob Brown after his<br />
record on the Franklin hasn't got a conscientious record on the<br />
environment?<br />
PM: He has got now a much more conscientious interest in getting into<br />
Parliament and that is the problem. If Bob Brown was really committed<br />
to the environment, he would be seeking the further development of<br />
policy such as this, rather than compromising any standing he has had<br />
to his own place in the Senate. I mean he is the one who has put his<br />
environmental credentials asunder by seeking political office, rather<br />
than being part of a broad movement which is looking for broad<br />
solutions such as this. </p>
<p>J: Are you going to be relying on the preferences from the Australian<br />
Greens in a lot of Lower House seats and in terms of Senate<br />
negotiations if that is the case?<br />
PM: Well I don't know how strong the Greens will be. But, again, what is<br />
their option: to give it to a party, the Coalition that has no belief in<br />
these policies at all.<br />
J: It worked in the Queensland State election.<br />
PM: Well that was for a number of reasons. This has not happened<br />
federally.<br />
JF: There have been a number of examples and perhaps the most recent<br />
and best example from a federal perspective, the by-election in<br />
Canberra where, in fact, there has been a recommendation from<br />
environment groups for a preference vote against Labor. And Labor<br />
still, of course, won the vast majority of Green preferences in that seat.<br />
From our perspective, look, we are very confident that those voters<br />
who will go to the polls later this year with the environment as a very<br />
high'. piority, or their highest priority, are going to look at the record of<br />
the parties, they will certainly compare the policies of the major parties,<br />
they are going to compare the records of the major parties on the<br />
environment and, I think, this government has an extraordinarily strong<br />
record and we are very confident that those voters with an<br />
environmental commitment are going to strongly support the return of<br />
this government.<br />
But we are not taking that for granted. We are going to continue<br />
throughout this period to point out very strongly the very clear<br />
differences that exist between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party on<br />
the environment issue and they are very stark.<br />
J: Prime Minister, you quoted before the Australian Conservation<br />
Foundation. In their release today they site a list of things yo&amp; u get to<br />
do, they say energy in greenhouse, forest World Heritage for key sites,<br />
legislative reform, clean industry initiatives, and a framework for<br />
ecologically sustainable development. Are they too greedy?<br />
JF: Let me make this point in relation to the release from the Australian<br />
Conservation Foundation. What you have is a very strong<br />
endorsement of this biodiversity conservation package which has been<br />
announced today. The ACF makes the point that there are a range of<br />
other environmental issues. No one can deny that.<br />
In the last Budget, you saw this government for the first time take the<br />
responsibility to really do something about protecting Australia's<br />
coasts. Late last year, you saw this government deliver the best ever<br />
4-0: </p>
<p>package to protect Australia's forests. Now, you have seen this<br />
government produce a package that undoubtedly is the best ever in<br />
terms of protection of Australia's biodiversity. I don't think anyone can<br />
argue that and I don't think anyone will argue that.<br />
There are other environment issues. They will all be important and we<br />
will be, of course, pointing out the strong differences that exist<br />
between the government and the Opposition on those issues as well.<br />
And issues like World Heritage, a commitment to protect World<br />
Heritage Areas and exercise our World Heritage obligations there is<br />
an enormous difference between ourselves and the party that<br />
John Howard leads. And we are going to demonstrate and show and<br />
expose those differences as the election campaign develops.<br />
J: Mr Keating, just from a local media's point of view is there anything<br />
more that you can tell us about the Asia Food Strategy and what it<br />
might mean for farmers and country towns?<br />
PM: Well on Friday we will be saying more about it. I think Senator Collins<br />
could probably tell you now.<br />
J: Is thef6 anything more that you can tell us though as far as like will<br />
you be talking about [ inaudible] for exports for farmers, can they<br />
expect more market technology?<br />
BC: Yes, we are. But those detailed proposals are going to be announced<br />
in a far more detailed way on Friday. And, in fact, I was very pleased<br />
to see that very senior members of the Australian business community,<br />
Reg Clews is here for example, as well as John Claringbolt, members<br />
of the Agri-Business Council are actually here today.<br />
J: Is there any possibility of the inland air freight terminal at say Parkes,<br />
or the Narrandera region?<br />
BC: There is nothing of that kind of detail in it. These are broad initiatives<br />
to assist the Council in substantially increasing the global amount of<br />
exports into Asia. You should never, ever, overlook the fact that we<br />
are extremely successful in that market and this is building on the<br />
success. It is not as if we haven't already succeeded, we have.<br />
There has been an enormous boost in exports into that region. And as<br />
the Prime Minister mentioned today in his speech, we know from what<br />
has been achieved already that that original target of $ 7 billion can be<br />
exceeded and this package is designed to achieve that.<br />
J: [ inaudible] air freight terminal. Would that have the<br />
government's support?<br />
PM: Well one of the studies which Bob Collins and Laurie Brereton are<br />
looking at now is what are the air freight needs, how do we handle </p>
<p>perishable commodities, time-sensitive perishable commodities, how<br />
do we get the linkages working better, what is the capacity like, where<br />
should it be? These are the issues we are currently studying.<br />
J: Prime Minister, how is it going to be paid for, the $ 460 million?<br />
PM: Well we will be making announcements as we do in the course of any<br />
budgetary year, in the course of certainly the forthcoming election<br />
campaign commitments we make, how they will be funded will be made<br />
very clear to you, clear to the media, clear to everybody and they will<br />
be, of course.<br />
And need I say, you know, we are sitting in the position with a Budget<br />
in surplus, we have got today confirmation of the underlying inflation<br />
rate, again, at the bottom end of market expectations, making it very<br />
clear that the target for inflation of 2 to 3 per cent over the cycle is well<br />
within our grasp, the government is sitting with a relatively strong low<br />
inflation economy and a Budget surplus. So it is a pretty good position<br />
to be in.<br />
And I *' mightju st say, I don't know whether someone has doled out<br />
some ( ruth serum to John Howard or not but today he made a very<br />
revealing commitment uncharacteristically revealing he said " I mean<br />
nobody can guarantee that somebody, for example, won't lose their job<br />
somewhere in the economy over a three year period and have to<br />
accept another job at a lower rate of pay." What he has done is<br />
confirm exactly what the government has been saying, and that is that<br />
the 1.7 million people who change jobs in a three year period under<br />
the policies of the Coalition will lose their award protections and would<br />
have to take jobs at lower rates of pay. And that is why 63 per cent of<br />
