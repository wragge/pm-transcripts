  Today marks the retirement of Chief Justice the Hon Sir Gerard Brennan</p>
<p> AC KBE from the High Court of Australia.</p>
<p>  I would like to thank Sir Gerard for his service to the Court and</p>
<p> to the Australian people.</p>
<p>  After a judicial career spanning some 22 years and 17 years on the</p>
<p> High Court, including three years as Chief Justice, Sir Gerard leaves</p>
<p> the Court in a position where it is well prepared to enter the next</p>
<p> millennium.</p>
<p>  His contribution to law and justice in Australia has been significant.</p>
<p> In addition to his distinguished career in the law, he is a man of</p>
<p> strong faith and has a real sense of public duty coupled with a deep</p>
<p> belief in human dignity. These values have consistently been reflected</p>
<p> in his contribution to the nation.</p>
<p>  I wish Sir Gerard well upon his retirement.</p>
