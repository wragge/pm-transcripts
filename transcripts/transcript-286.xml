FROM: Australian High Commission,<br />
LONDON. Excerpts of Prime Minister's speech to Australia'<br />
Club dinner, Savoy Hotel tonight.<br />
The Prime Minister said " The master of the Rolls<br />
( Lord Evershed who proposed the toast of Australia) towards the<br />
end of his speech made some reference to the Commonwealth. I<br />
think it might be regarded as a little odd if I didn't say<br />
something myself about the events of the last week or ten days.<br />
I think cne should say a little about some of the events of<br />
the last ten days and of some of the dangers, as I see them,<br />
of the results of the lost ten days, because I believe that<br />
last week we had some of the most dramatic events in Commonwealth<br />
history. And if we don't think they are dramatic then<br />
we have lost all interest in the Coinmonwc alth and what happens<br />
t-o it. What happened last week was that a foundation<br />
member of the British Commonwealth, to wit, South Africa, was<br />
in effect told to leave. I use those words; I will justify<br />
them in due course. And South Africa hs: s left.<br />
Now this is not something to be tossed off lightly<br />
as a mere incident, this is a foundation member of the Commonwealth<br />
a country which b carnc a member of the Commonwealth<br />
after bitter war, bitter disputes, and after a superb act of<br />
statesmanship by the United Kingdom which created the Union.<br />
We have had in the newsapers, speculation propaganda, and,<br />
if you will allow me to say, so not a little falsehood, about<br />
the events of the last tcn days. Therefore I want to say some-<br />
' thin~ fthat is called apnrt~ h. id(', which means, as I under' 5tand it,<br />
separate development, Searate develop3;-ent hao been, rightly<br />
or wrongly, the policy of the Government of South Africa. AnQ<br />
indeed I would like to remind you this has been the policy<br />
of South Africa since it was first crected by J. C. Smuts. He<br />
found himself confronted by choice which every power finds itself<br />
confronted by the choice between having a policy cf integration,<br />
when you have people0 of different races, or a policy of separate<br />
development. This is a problem of statesmanship.<br />
In the old Colonial days it was apartheid. You<br />
had the European colonising power running the country, building<br />
people up, all very properly a process which has led to the<br />
creation of nation after nation in this world. Or you have<br />
some other view. And so South Africa decided that it would have<br />
Y abcut these events as I sawv them and in which, as in an obscure<br />
capacity, I had some part. All this argument has arisen about../ 2<br />
s omet hing/ </p>
<p>1-7111<br />
this policy of separate development. Now, for reasons that I<br />
am going to give to you, I don't agree with this policy. Btt<br />
the great problem that we have had to confront is whether<br />
because you disagree with the policy of a country, a member of<br />
the Commonwealth, you push it out of the Commonwealth. And<br />
those are two questions that ought to bo kept completely distinct.<br />
The whole problem is not one of moralising, of being superior,<br />
or passionate; the whole problem is one of statesmanship. I<br />
say particularly to my Australian fellow countrymen I am the<br />
only Prime Minister who, until this conferenc2, had never<br />
publicly offered an opinion on South African policy. And I<br />
stand by that. I think that was right, because I am a believer<br />
in the Commonwealth. I am a believer in the members of the<br />
Commonwealth meeting together, not arguing with each other, not<br />
lecturing each other, not sitting in judgment on each other, but<br />
seeking to discover between themselves what points of agreement<br />
they have, how far they may assemble their moral force in the<br />
world. And therefore in my own Parliament, and I daresay not<br />
much to my own advantage, I said South Africa runs its<br />
own affairs. We run our own affairs, Canada runs its own<br />
affairs. Who are we to be sitting here in judgment one on the<br />
other? But all this is old hat now, because everybody<br />
has a go Wtit and I would not be saying anything about it<br />
tonight if it were not for the fact tha-t in the conference Dr.<br />
Vorwoerd himself, acceded to the idea that we ought to have a<br />
chance between us all to thrash this matter out.<br />
The whole genius of the British Commonwealth and<br />
I believe in the British Commornmealth with a faith in my gutshas<br />
been that we are tolerant; we agree to disagree, we seek<br />
to understand, we look for points of agreement but we don't<br />
stand up and lecture each other in the face of the world.<br />
Never, until. this year, have we sat in judgment on each other.<br />
These are things worth remembering. Now I, never having before<br />
offered a public word about South African policy, am now called<br />
on to do so, not by my wish. I am old fashioned enough to<br />
believe in tolerance and in living and letting live and in the<br />
virtues of Christian faith, hope and charity. I believe in these<br />
things, but if this is out of date and I am to be misunderstood<br />
about these matters then I simply say this to you: here is a<br />
time of passion and rhetoric, broad sweeping statements, the<br />
kind of things you expect to have in the United Nations Assembly<br />
but not in the British Commonwealth.<br />
I don't moralise about South African policy because<br />
I think moralising is a pretty cheap thing. All I say is that I<br />
don't think apartheid will work. You see this is the pragmatic<br />
British approach. Nothing was more impressive to all of us in<br />
this conference than the way in which Dr. Verwoerd with obvious<br />
honesty, with great courtesy, with great lucidity explained his<br />
policy but I don't think it will work in this day and<br />
generation. The more his policy succeeds, the more he brings<br />
the Bantu up in matters of health and living standards and education,<br />
the more intolerable will they find it to be second class citizens..<br />
This is a purely pragmatic approach, not sentimental, but<br />
practical, and I have said to him time after time in private<br />
" I know you believe this is right. </p>
<p>3 1.7111<br />
I believe that the more it succeeds in the first instance the<br />
more it will fail in the long run because the more you succeed<br />
in building up the Bantu the more you succeed in giving them<br />
proper standards, educational stpndards, and give thiem<br />
universities, the more will you develop that proper pride in<br />
people which will make them say I en not to be pushed on one side".<br />
If it goes on that way you may find that the ultimate<br />
conflict will be bloody and devastating. I offer this for what<br />
it is worth. He is familiar with my view on this matter. But<br />
if he goes back to his own country and says, I e* m unmoved by<br />
that, then I want to t1ll you that I stand for the right of any<br />
Commonwealth country to run its affairs in its own way.<br />
May I remind you that in May of last year we had a<br />
Prime Ministers' Conference and this was the first matter to<br />
come up. And after we had had a discussion we issued a cormuniqUe<br />
which said the Commonwealth is an association of independent<br />
sovereign states each responsible for its own policies. Those,<br />
I venture to say, were fine wirds and true words. I emphasise<br />
them because if somebody in a Prime Ministers' Conference wants<br />
to tell me what the policies of Australia ought to be, I will<br />
tell them to go and jump in the Serpentine.<br />
The United Nations and that is a body with which I<br />
don't invariably agree concedes the point. It says " Nothing<br />
contained in the present Charter shall authorise the United<br />
Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within<br />
the domestic jurisdiction of any state". Mr. Menzies continued<br />
" Any suggestion for the expulsion of South Africa from the<br />
Commonwealth misconceives the nature of our association. We<br />
don't deal with the domestic political policies of any one of<br />
us, for we know that political policies come or go with<br />
Governments and that we are not concerned with Governments and<br />
their policies so much as we are with nations and their peoples.<br />
If we over thought of expelling a member of the<br />
Commonwealth it would, I hope, be because we believed that, in<br />
the general interests of the Cormonwealth, a nation, as a nation,<br />
was not fit to be our associote. The Prime Ministers' Conference,<br />
I said in my Smuts Lecture at Cambridge, would break up in<br />
disorder if we affected to discuss and decide what we thought<br />
to be the proper measure of democracy in our various countries.<br />
Whether particular groups should or should not have the vote,<br />
that is a fascinating inquiry, whether oppositions should be<br />
respected, whether a Parliament should control the Executive;<br />
on all such matters autonomous or independent nations must<br />
have the right to manage their own affirs in their own way.<br />
Every Government, every member of the Commonwealth has achieved<br />
self government a right of complete independence. Do I want to<br />
go around end say to anyone of them " This is how you ought to<br />
govern yourself"? of course not, its too stupid for words.<br />
You will have a high degree of authoritarian Government in one<br />
country, you will have anu advanced stage of Parliamentary<br />
Government in another. But when you look bak on these things<br />
and you remermber that from first to last, fromthe Balfour<br />
Declaration onwards, we have emphasised that we are autonomous<br />
Governmehts, -aasters of our own fate, masters of our own<br />
problems, don't you think th. t it is a monstrous thing for us<br />
to be sitting in judgment one on the other. I would not have<br />
said a word about South African policy, which I think is doomod<br />
./ 4 </p>
<p>4 1,7111<br />
to disaster, except that I am the only man yet among the Prime<br />
Ministers who has not said soriething about it. i'md its all<br />
been exposed to the public eye and there no one can be<br />
misrepresented. Ncxt time it might be Australia. How do I<br />
know? We have things in our policy which are our policy and<br />
our business, which somebody may disagree with, I would not<br />
toler'a te having these things discussed by other people. I<br />
would not tolerate being lectured by other people on what we<br />
ought to do. Today it is the fashion to talk about racialism.<br />
It is still the fashion to talk about colonialism so long as<br />
you don't talk about Communist colonialism which is the greatest<br />
and most aggressive colonialism in the world.<br />
But who talks about the rule of Parliament, the rule<br />
of Law? I could very well have a word or two to say about some<br />
of these things like imprisonment without trial, if the drill is<br />
that in the Comonwealth this is to be changed so that we're<br />
sitting in judgment, Then I am bound to tell you I will have<br />
something to say about that, and by the time I have said it, by<br />
the time the answers have been made, there won't be any<br />
Commonwealth, because we will all have expelled each other.<br />
I dbn't mind if 99 nations at New York go on making<br />
speeches asting two and a half hours each, and going into<br />
Committee, and doing all these things this is highly<br />
experimental. It may produce some good results, but what hurts<br />
me is that this great Comnonwoaltl is being dragged into this<br />
area of thought which s no relation to it. Nothing will ever<br />
persuade me that you can identify the exquisite personal<br />
relations of the Commonwealth with the debating society that<br />
goes on in New York..... We have had a special family relationship<br />
and if anybody wants to do something which converts the<br />
Commonwealth with all its warmth and its intimacy, its capacity<br />
for hostility within friendship, which is the great thing about<br />
any family relationship, so that all this is gone then all I<br />
can say is that, with great devotion to Her M1ajesty, it is a<br />
sorry day for the Commonwealth Why can't we disagree with<br />
the South African policy without pushing South Africa out, and<br />
believe, me it was pushed out.<br />
Harold Macmillan, the distinguished Pritie IJinister of<br />
this country, with his colleagues and with myself, we worked like<br />
horses to develop a communique which rould expose the criticisms<br />
by other members of the Cormonwealth and the answer of the Prime<br />
Minister of South A frica and, having exposed them, would then<br />
make it possible for South Africa to remain within the Commonwealth<br />
as a Republic as eery other Republic had. But I must tell you in<br />
view of all this propa-ganda that goes on, that while I was saying<br />
tc myself " Well I think this fixes it", one, two, three four,<br />
five people got up and made it completely clear that they<br />
wouldn't have this. They didn't want South iArica in, and every<br />
convenient opportunity or inconvenient opportunity would be taken<br />
to attack her. Well I eam not Dr. Verwoerd and I an not the<br />
apostle of apartheid, though I have my own Ir. migration policy.<br />
I an bound to say that in his placeI would have ] dt, certainly<br />
not later than he did.<br />
So don't let's ha-ve humbug, which I rather think is<br />
one of the more serious offences in the world. The fact is that<br />
in all these circumstances South Africa is out. Wlhat I am saying<br />
to you is " don't let us -jump on the latest band wagon, let ; us </p>
<p>4 1.7111<br />
think of this Commonwealth of ours. What does it mean in<br />
tolereacop,... iunderstanding, in points of contact, for us who<br />
are Australians in a superb allegiance to the Throne? What<br />
does it mean, if we think it means nothing, then it doesn't<br />
matter... -Let it all go to the United Nations, but if wo think<br />
it moans something, then I bog all of you to look back on these<br />
events saying: Did we go wrong? Has what has happened strengthened<br />
the Commonwealth? The answer to that question will depend on<br />
whether you think our marvellous association depends upon<br />
tolerance and kindness and understanding and the long view, or<br />
upon the popular passion for denunciation. I don't need to tell<br />
you that I don't feel good about this. But since my earliest days<br />
in politics I have had a groat vision of what the Commonwealth<br />
should stand for. I hate to think that it is blurred".<br />
