FOR MEDIA 13 January, 1980<br />
CYCLONE ANIY<br />
The Prime Minister today sent a message to the Premier of<br />
Western Australia offering Commonwealth assistance following<br />
damage caused by Cyclone Amy.<br />
Mr Fraser noted that the way in which the State Emergency<br />
Services had handled this cyclone demonstrated what careful<br />
planning could do to avoid injuries.<br />
The liaison between the various authorities involved in disaster<br />
planning had been most effective.<br />
" The Natural. Disasters Organisation in Canberra had been in<br />
constant touch with Western Australia and I was continually<br />
informed of the progress of the cyclone", Mr Fraser said.<br />
" I have asked the Premier to pass to those concerned my<br />
qqngratulations on their efforts.<br />
" At the same time, I extend sincere best wishes to those who<br />
have suffered. We must all, however, be grateful that there<br />
was no loss-of life on this occasion". 000---</p>
