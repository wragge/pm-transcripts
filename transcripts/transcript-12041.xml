<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister whatâs your response to Kim Beazleyâs admission that in fact he did attend that meeting with John Prescott at BHP?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well heâs been caught out, blatantly caught out. He should have told the Australian public about this aged ago, hereâs the man whoâs pretending that he can be trusted on his word not to sell Telstra if he becomes Prime Minister. Heâs the man who sold the Commonwealth Bank despite saying otherwise. Heâs the man who sold an airline despite saying otherwise. And hereâs a man whoâs now been flushed out, caught out as having considered being involved in a discussion about the possible sale of Telstra. It completely blows and destroys his credibility on this issue.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>But they didnât sell it did they?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Ah but they were thinking about it. And then they lost the election.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>Does this mean that both parties are now planning to sell Telstra?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Our policy is that we wonât sell another share in the carrier until such time as we are completely satisfied that everything in the bush is up to scratch. His position is well who can believe him.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
