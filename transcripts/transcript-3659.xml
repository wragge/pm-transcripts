QUEENSLAND BROADCAST NO. 1<br />
MEDIBANK<br />
BRAODCAST BY THE PRIE MINISTER FOR QUEEISIAND RADIO STATIONS, 23 MFIARCH 1975<br />
THE MANAGEMENT OF THIS STATION HAS BEEN GOOD<br />
ENOUGH TO INVITE ME TO TALK REGULARLY TO THE PEOPLE OF<br />
QUEENSLAND ABOUT MATTERS OF CURRENT INTEREST, I AM<br />
GRATEFUL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY., IN THE WEEKS TO COME<br />
I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING OF WHAT THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
S GOVERNMENT IS DOING, NOT ONLY FOR YOUR OWN GREAT<br />
STATE, BUT FOR ALL THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE.<br />
I. THOUGHT I WOULD BEGIN WITH A SUBJECT VERY<br />
MUCH IN THE PUBLIC MIND, AND. IN THE HEADLINES, AT THE<br />
MOMENT MEDIBANK. THIS IS THE NEW UNIVERSAL HEALTH<br />
INSURANCE SCHEME TO BE INTRODUCED THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA<br />
ON THE FIRST OF JULY. I SHALL TELL YOU SOMETHING OF<br />
S WHAT IT MEANS IN A MOMENT, BUT FIRST LET ME EMPHASISE<br />
THIS: MEDIBANK HAS BEEN THE POLICY OF THE LABOR PARTY<br />
SINCE 1968. IT HAS BEEN ENDORSED BY THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
PEOPLE IN THE TWO FEDERAL ELECTIONS IN 1972 AND 1974.<br />
WE HAVE SPENT YEARS DEVELOPING THE SCHEME AND MANY,<br />
MANY MONTHS IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH INTERESTED GROUPS<br />
DOCTORS, HEALTH FUNDS, THE STATES WORKING OUT'THE<br />
DETAILS, I BELIEVE THAT BILL HAYDEN, THE MINISTER<br />
FOR SOCIAL SECURITY, AND A QUEENSLANDER, HAS PERFECTED<br />
ONE OF THE BEST HEALTH SCHEMES IN THE WORLD.. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
THE OPPOSITION IN THE SENATE HAS TRIED HARD<br />
TO BLOCK OUR PROPOSALS BUT IT HAS NOT SUCCEEDED.<br />
-THE LEGISLATION HAD TO BE PASSED AT THE JOINT SITTING<br />
OF THE PARLIAMENT LAST AUGUST. SO SIMPLY: MEDIBANK<br />
IS THE LAW OF THE LANDO THE PEOPLE WANT IT. IT IS<br />
GOING AHEAD ON SCHEDULE. AND IT IS GOING AHEAD AS<br />
. PLANNED. MEDIBANK WILL MEAN THAT AFTER 1 JULY NO ONE<br />
WILL HAVE TO PAY ANY CONTRIBUTIONS FOR MEDICAL INSURANCE<br />
TO COVER DOCTORS' BILLS. THIS INSURANCE WILL B<br />
FREE, DOCTORS WILL BE ABLE TO TREAT ANY PATIENT, AND<br />
PATIENTS WILL BE FREE TO CONSULT ANY DOCTOR*. IF THE<br />
DOCTOR SENDS HIS BILL TO MEDIBANK, PATIENTS WILL PAY<br />
NOTHING, IF THE DOCTOR PREFERS TO SEND HIS BILL TO THE<br />
PATIENT IN THE OLD WAY, PATIENTS CAN CLAIM A REFUND FROM<br />
MEDIBANK OF 85% OF THE BILL. THE PATIENT WILL PAY<br />
THE REST, BUT NEVER MORE THAN $ 5 FOR ANY TREATMENT,-<br />
NO MATTER HOW EXPENSIVE. You HEAR OUR OPRONENTS SAY THAT<br />
MEDICAL .* INSURANCE WON'T REALLY BE FREE AT ALL THAT<br />
IT'S GOING TO COST THE COUNTRY . SO MANY MILLIONS OF<br />
DOLLARS. WELL OF COURSE, EVERYTHING COSTS MONEY, THE<br />
DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE FUNDS FOR MEDIBANK WILL COME<br />
FROM. OUR TAXES, JUST. AS FUNDS FOR OTHER GOVERNMENT<br />
SERVICES LIKE EDUCATION, PENSIONS, THE DEFENCE<br />
FORCES COME FROM OURTAXES, PEOPLE* WILL PAY NOTHING<br />
THEMSELVES. HEALTH WILL BE A RESPONSIBILITY'OF<br />
THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
WE THINK THIS IS A MUCH BETTER SYSTEM FOR A<br />
NUMBER OF REASONS, IN THE FIRST PLACE IT IS SIMPLER<br />
AND FAIRER, IT WILL DO AWAY WITH A HUNDRED OR MORE<br />
SEPARATE, COMPETING, OVERLAPPING HEALTH FUNDS WHOSE<br />
ACTIVITIES HAVE OFTEN LED TO WASTE AND INEFFICIENCY<br />
IT WILL MEAN THAT EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY WILL BE<br />
COVERED AUTOMATICALLY DON'T FORGET THERE ARE NOW OVER A<br />
MILLION AUSTRALIANS WITH NO MEDICAL INSURANCE AT ALL,<br />
IT'WILL MEAN BETTER TREATMENT FOR-PENSIONERS AND<br />
THOSE MOST IN NEEDS AND FOR EVERYONE IT WILL MEAN<br />
NO MORE WORRY OR FINANCIAL EMBARRASSMENT IN'MEEtING THE<br />
COST OF CONTRIBUTIONS$ I HAVE MENTIONED THE MEDICAL SIDE OF OUR SCHEME.<br />
THAT'S GOING AHEAD WHATEVER THE STATES MAY DO, THEHOSPITAL<br />
SIDE IS MORE COMPLICATED, IT DEPENDS ON<br />
WHETHER THE STATES AGREE TO CO-OPERATE WITH<br />
MEDIBANK OR NOT, IF THEY DO, HOSPITAL CARE IN GENERAL<br />
p WARDS WILL COST NOTHING THE AUSTRALIAN. GOVERNMENT AND<br />
THE STATE GOVERNMENT WILL SHARE THE COST FOR EACH<br />
PATIENT, WE HAVE OFFERED THE-STATES SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS FOR<br />
THIS PURPOSE, NoW I KNOW THAT HERE IN QUEENSLAND YOU ALREADY<br />
HAVE FREE HOSPITAL TREATMENT IT WAS A LABOR GOVERNMENT<br />
IN THIS STATE THAT KEPT YOUR FREE HOSPITAL'SCHEME GOING<br />
AFTER MR MENZIES IN THE 1950' WITH A COUNTRY PARTY<br />
MINISTER OF HEALTH, BROKE OFF THE AGREEMENTS WHICH<br />
THE CHIFLEY LABOR GOVERNMENT HAD MADE WITH EVERY STATE<br />
FOR FREE HOSPITALS BACK IN 1947. </p>
<p>-41-<br />
So YOU MAY THINK IT DOESN'T MATTER MUCH TO QUEENSLANDERS<br />
WHETHER YOUR STATE GOVERNMENT JOINS MEDIBANK OR NOT.<br />
SWELL, IT DOES MATTER. IT'S TRUE THAT YOU WOULD CONTINUE<br />
TO HAVE FREE PUBLIC WARD TREATMENT AS LONG AS<br />
THE STATE PROVIDES IT BUT IF QUEENSLAND JOINS THE<br />
MEDIBANK SCHEME YOU STATE WILL BE GETTING MILLIONS OF<br />
DOLLARS IN EXTRA FUNDS ABOUT $ 50 MILLION A YEAR<br />
FROM THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, THESE FUNDS WOULD<br />
GREATLY EASE THE BURDEN ON YOUR STATE FINANCES. THEY COULD<br />
BE USED TO BUY MORE HOSPITAL EQUIPMENT OR EMPLOY MORE S<br />
STAFF THINGS WHICH QUEENSLAND HOSPITALS SORELY NEED,<br />
So BY JOINING MEDIBANK, QUEENSLAND WILL BE MUCH BETTER OFF<br />
THAN IF SHE DOESN'T JOIN. WITH OR WITHOUT MEDIBANK, THE<br />
FACT IS THAT HOSPITAL COSTS ARE GOING TO GO ON RISING,<br />
BECAUSE HEALTH CARE EVERYWHERE IS BECOMING MORE<br />
EXPENSIVE, MORE IN DEMAND. WITH MEDIBANK, YOUR STATE<br />
GOVERNMENT WON'T HAVE TO BEAR SINGLE-HANDED THIS<br />
INEVITABLE BURDEN OF RISING COSTS. THAT MEANS MORE MONEY<br />
TO SPEND ON OTHER THINGS SCHOOLS, ROADS, RAILWAYS,<br />
COMMUNITY FACILITIES FOR THE BENEFIT OF QUEENSLAND PEOPLE.<br />
ALSO, UNDER MEDIBANK, PRIVATE HOSPITALS WILL BE GETTING<br />
ANOTHER $ 16 A DAY FOR EVERY PATIENT. So IT'S NOT JUST<br />
PUBLIC HOSPITALS, BUT PRIVATE HOSPITALS, THAT STAND TO<br />
GAIN. </p>
<p>I THE STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE NOW DECIDING THEIR<br />
ATTITUDES TO THE MEDIBANK HOSPITAL PROPOSALS, Two<br />
STATES TASMANIA AND SOUTH AUSTRALIA HAVE ALREADY<br />
COME IN, I HOPE QUEENSLAND WILL JOIN THEM, I WOULDN'T<br />
ENVY A STATE PREMIER WHO HAD TO EXPLAIN TO HIS FELLOWCITIZENS<br />
WHY HE'S DECIDED TO DEPRIVE THEM OF<br />
MILLION A YEAR. DON'T FORGET: MEDIBANK WILL BE<br />
STARTING IN JULY WHETHER QUEENSLAND JOINS OR NOT.<br />
WHATEVER HAPPENS, QUEENSLANDERS WILL BE GETTING THE<br />
BENEFITS OF FREE MEDICAL INSURANCE, I WANT THEM TO<br />
GET THE EXTRA BENEFITS OF THE HOSPITAL SCHEME AS WELL$<br />
I WANT THEM TO BE FULL PARTNERS IN A SCHEME THAT MEANS<br />
BETTER HEALTH AND GREATER HAPPINESS AND SECURITY FOR ALL.<br />
AUSTRALIANS, </p>
