JA US'TR2,1A LA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 2 May 1983<br />
The New Zealand Prime Minister, Mr Robert Muldoon,<br />
will visit Australia from 23 25 June for talks<br />
with me and with other members of the Government.<br />
I expect that the talks will Be wide-ranging and deal<br />
particularly with matters of bilateral and regional<br />
concern. I am pleased that Mr Muldoon has chosen to visit<br />
Australia early in my Gov4 rnment's term of office.<br />
This reflects the continuing close and special<br />
relationship that exists between Australia and<br />
New Zealand, who share many interests in common,<br />
particularly in the South Pacific and Asian regions. </p>
