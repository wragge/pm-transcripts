HOST: Prime Minister, thanks so much for your time and for speaking to us. I understand you've got an announcement to make.</p>
<p>PM: That's right I do. I'm here in Tasmania today and I've been visiting with the Tasmanian Premier.</p>
<p>We've had the opportunity to be briefed by the local fire and police and I've seen some remarkable scenes of destruction and met some amazing community members as well.</p>
<p>But I did want to take this opportunity to confirm that if you are thinking of donating to one of the appeals that is helping people in Tasmania, please do.</p>
<p>Your cash makes a difference and I can announce today that that donation will be tax-deductible.</p>
<p>So for Australians who are thinking I really want to do something to help, please make a cash donation and come tax time you'll be able to see some benefit of doing that.</p>
<p>HOST: Tell us Prime Minister, how important is that? I mean, you've been touring the region. What have you seen firsthand this afternoon?</p>
<p>PM: Well I have had the opportunity to see here what the fires have done, and we do need to remember Wendy this fire emergency is not over yet.</p>
<p>Fires are still being fought, and depending on what happens with temperatures and wind conditions in the next few days, we could see fires once again destroying things in Tasmania.</p>
<p>So the message is please keep listening to all of the local announcements. What I've seen here is the loss of homes, the destruction of community property.</p>
<p>For example, where I'm standing now, this is a township that's lost its local school as well as these community tennis courts that you can see behind me.</p>
<p>People are all pulling together. There's heaps of donations of food and toiletries and the kind of things people need in the first few days of an emergency.</p>
<p>But beyond that, what does the most good is actual resources, money to do things that the community needs.</p>
<p>So if you've got the will to put in a little bit of money then that would be very, very welcome by the people in Tasmania so hard-hit.</p>
<p>HOST: Prime Minister, as you say you've heard so many stories. Is there one or two in particular that have really touched you?</p>
<p>PM: I've heard a lot of stories.</p>
<p>I met a young girl at the local school who'd just come through to have a look at the school she's been going to. She was so distressed and just wanted to know what had happened.</p>
<p>She hadn't been eating but whilst she's seen some devastating scenes it seems to have helped her that at least now she knows what her school looks like.</p>
<p>I've heard stories of people who raced for the jetty to get into a boat, to get into the water to escape the fire.</p>
<p>The fire here obviously burned with incredible intensity because you're seeing big bits of metal absolutely twisted and destroyed, so incredibly hot.</p>
<p>But you know, we've been at the local pub and there's the local publican and he's providing free food to help people out, so amazing community spirit.</p>
<p>HOST: Just on that point, are people getting what they need at this point?</p>
<p>PM: At this point there are obviously stresses and strains and people are under a lot of pressure, but people have pulled together to make resources available.</p>
<p>So there are emergency centres in operation where people can get assistance with food, with basic necessities like soap and a razor and all of that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>People can register for the emergency payments that can help them out.</p>
<p>There are payments coming from the Tasmanian Government and from us, particularly the Australian Government Disaster Relief Payment that puts some money in people's pockets.</p>
<p>But like any natural disaster, it's going to be a long way back for this community and for communities like it around Tasmania.</p>
<p>HOST: Which is why it is so important that we do donate. Just tell us the details, Prime Minister, again if people are just joining us at home.</p>
<p>PM: Well the details are if you donate to one of the appeals that is helping people in Tassie, it will be tax deductible.</p>
<p>The Red Cross is running one of these appeals, so get on the Red Cross website or give the Red Cross a call and they'll be able to tell you how to go about donating.</p>
<p>HOST: Alright Prime Minister Julia Gillard, thank you very much for joining us on Nine News now. I appreciate your time this afternoon.</p>
<p>PM: Thanks for the opportunity.</p>
