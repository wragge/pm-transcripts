FOR PRESS: LI R AV P. M. No. 67/ 16<br />
HYDRO-ELECTRICITY DEVELOPMENT IN TASMANIA<br />
joint Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Harold Holt<br />
and the Premier of Tasmania, the Hlon. E. E. Reece<br />
The Commonwealth has agreed in principle to provide<br />
bridging financial assistance to Tasmania for the financing of a five-year<br />
programme of accelerated hydro-electric development in that State based<br />
on the commencement of development of the rugged Gordon River area in<br />
the south-west of the State.<br />
The five-year programme is estimated by the State to cost<br />
$ 212 million and its pur pose is to meet in the best way the projected<br />
electricity requirements of Tasmania, particularly by the large electricityconsuming<br />
industries in the State many of which are important earners of<br />
export income. Because initial development of the Gordon River area will<br />
necessitate large amounts of investment before the first block of electricity<br />
can be produced from it, the implementation of the programme will cause<br />
a temporary " hump" in the rate of increase of electricity investment in the<br />
State. The Commonwealth has accepted that on present indications the State<br />
would be unable to finance the programme without some Commonwealth<br />
assistance of a temporary character.<br />
The. Commonwealth has proposed, and the State has<br />
accepted, that it would be desirable for an independent assessment to be<br />
made of the planning basis of the five-year programme and of the cost<br />
estimates of the programme. It is envisaged that this assessment will be<br />
undertaken as a matter of urgency by the S nowy Mountains Authority.<br />
The amount of assistance to be provided by the Commonwealth<br />
will be determined in consultation with the State from year to year as the,<br />
programme proceeds. Subject to an overall limit of $ 47 million, the amount<br />
of Commonwealth assistance will be based on the need for assistance having<br />
regard to the sources of finance available to the State from its own resources<br />
and those of the Hydro-Electric Commission.<br />
The purpose of the Commonwealth assistance is to hel p<br />
the State over the " hump" referred to. It will therefore be of a temporary<br />
or bridging nature and will be repayable by the State over the period of<br />
eight years subsequent to the five-year programme. The rate of interest<br />
will be the maximum rate applying to semi -governmental securities from<br />
time to time. The arrangements will be embodied in a formal agreement<br />
between the Commonwealth and the State which will be submitted to the<br />
respective Parliaments in due course.<br />
The Prime Minister emphasised that the Commonwealth<br />
assistance is being provided because of the special situation described. It<br />
is not to be regarded as a precedent for special measures of Commonwealth<br />
assistance for the financing of electricity development in the States in other<br />
cases. CANBERRA, 29th June, 1967. </p>
