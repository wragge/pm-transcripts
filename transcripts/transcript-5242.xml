PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT WEDNESDAY, 23 JANUARY, 1980<br />
PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED ON " WILLESEE AT SEVEN"<br />
ON SITUATION IN AFGHANISTAN<br />
Willesee It takes a lot to call off an Olympiad. The last time it happened<br />
there was a world war in progress. But now with Russian troops<br />
occupying Afghanistan, the United States'Government wants to<br />
boycott the Moscow Olympics and so now does the Australian<br />
Government.-And of course the Games have always been political.<br />
Let's not forget that, most notably Hitler's Berlin Games in<br />
' 36, and again at Munich in 1972 when Israeli athletes were<br />
assassinated. But the emphasis in past Games has been directed<br />
more to nationalism, propaganda or sheer publicity. This time<br />
it is the Olympics being used as a weapon against a gross act<br />
of invasion and whether Mr. Fraser is right or wrong in this,<br />
he is certainly right when he pleads that this issue should not<br />
obscure the major issue, and that is the Russian invasion itself.<br />
To talk about this whole question in our Melbourne studio,<br />
the Prime Minister, Mr. Malcolm Fraser.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, thanks for coming in.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Thank you, and good evening.<br />
Willesee What do you see as the primary reason for the Soviet invasion<br />
of Afghanistan?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think it is hard to judge with absolute accuracy -the--reason.<br />
Also, I am not sure that the reason is entirely relevant. The<br />
more important fact is that they are there and being there that<br />
will open opportunities for-them, if they want to take it and<br />
if they think there is a chance of getting away with it, of<br />
moving further either towards Iran or towards Pakistan. But you<br />
asked what is the reason. I could think of two. Again, let me<br />
make the point, the more important question is that they are<br />
there. They could have been disturbed that a communist<br />
revolution, coup, of nearly two years ago was going badly. There<br />
was a further coup a few months ago. All communist coups, or<br />
revolutions. Then a third, which they established by force of<br />
arms. They could have been disturbed that a communist revolution<br />
was going badly and might not have been sustained. They could<br />
have been concerned about the impact that would have on their<br />
own Muslim minorities. But on the other hand, they could have been<br />
saying ' here is a position in a small country that is not a threat<br />
to us. If we move in there will be later opportunities for us,<br />
either in moving towards Pakistan or towards Iran-and gaining<br />
influence or control over oil production", which they would see<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
of course as a weapon of enormous economic importance.<br />
Willesee Well what do you fear then could happen next in that region?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The more dangerous thing, the most dangerous thing, would<br />
be a Russian move towards Iran, and let's say either<br />
spontaneously or as a result of it being engineered, a minority,<br />
pro-Marxist, pro-Russia minority in Iran said that they were<br />
being persecuted under the present regime and they wanted help<br />
from the Soviet Union. That could give them the kind of excuse<br />
they need to move. Then of course, they would gain direct<br />
access to the Indian Ocean, to the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf.<br />
Warmwater ports have always been<br />
Willesee But technically that would be of enormous difference.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes, it would.<br />
Willesee If the Russians go into Iran, even with some sort of request<br />
from whoever may nominally head that Government, do you see any<br />
circumistances where the Western world would allow Russia to do that.<br />
Prime. Minister<br />
I would certainly hope not. But also may I say that the total<br />
activity of the United States, a'number. of other countries, and-*.<br />
with whatever weight a nation of 14 million can throw onto the<br />
scales, what we are about now is designed the create the<br />
circumstances where that will not happen so that the worse.<br />
options will not then have to be faced by a further Russian<br />
military invasion.<br />
Willesee Without trying to digress too much, could I just ask one<br />
question on Yugoslavia because it may be relevant. What are<br />
your fears for Yugoslavia, or your concern, in the event of<br />
Tito dying?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, in the event of that of course, there is an obvious<br />
concern that there could be some internal problems within<br />
Yugoslavia and again, that the Soviet Union might exploit that<br />
opportunity-to re-establish a Government in Yugoslavia that<br />
would be subservient to Moscow. Marshall Tito has, especially<br />
in the light of what had happened'in Czechoslovakia, what had / 2 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
happened in Hungary, has shown enormous skill and enormous<br />
strength in establishing a very real degree of independence for<br />
Yugoslavia even though within the communist orbit, within the<br />
Soviet orbit, area of influence. Obviously, the concern is that<br />
that degree of independence-would be lost.<br />
Willesee Mr.. Fraser, is there any question of trying to get the Russians<br />
out of Afghanistan or do you see the simple priority as being<br />
one of containment, that they go no further?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Obviously we will need, when I say we I mean independent nations,<br />
the United States, will need to try and establish the circumstances<br />
in which the Soviet Union might be persuaded to withdraw<br />
because of the extent and the strength of the revulsion right<br />
around the world. I think the Soviet Union would have been very<br />
surprised at that vote in-the United Nations in which they had<br />
only 18 supporters and a very very large number against them<br />
from all groups, all countries around the world. But I do not<br />
think we can establish that as a primary-objective.<br />
Wi lies ee<br />
It's pretty unlikely isn't it?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think it is very unlikely and I have said that before. So that<br />
means that the major priority has to be to prevent any further<br />
move, establish the circumstances where the Soviet Unionwill believe<br />
that the price they have paid as a result of moving into<br />
Afghanistan is so high that they will not seek to move further...<br />
Willesee So what more needs to be done?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, to the greatest extent possible, that independently-minded<br />
nations, nations that are concerned for their own and for the<br />
ational independence of others, can build a free world consensus<br />
and act upon that, whether it is through reinforcing trade sanctions,<br />
whether it is through reinforcing what the United States, Britain,<br />
Canada and we, have said about the Olympic Gamnes. Now quite<br />
obviously people are talking about peaceful means but at the same<br />
time I believe, and again the United States has already announced<br />
that the countries around the world need to look to their own<br />
defences budgets. The United States is, the President has<br />
already announced that. Because it is not going to be<br />
any one single act but a combination of factors, things that the<br />
United States do, things that are done in Europe amongst the<br />
NATO countries that will build up a confidence. / 4 </p>
<p>Willesee On that military side, the President of the United States, of course<br />
has done more than look to his budget. He has an increasing<br />
military presence in the region now. If President Carter asks<br />
Australia, when you talk with him Sir, to assist militarily, what<br />
can you do?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I doubt if anyone is at the moment considering using military forces.<br />
Quite obviously the presence is being increased and again the<br />
objective is to make sure that military forces do not have to be<br />
used. But we have already said and we volunteered it, that we<br />
would be prepared to participate with a greater degree of patrolling<br />
and surveillance over the Indian Ocean area. Now we have our own<br />
ideas about how that could be done. I will be putting those when<br />
I go to Washington. But that is one thing that we can do, we are<br />
equipped to do and we are prepared to do.<br />
Wil1le see<br />
You've said that you see this as the biggest threat to world peace<br />
in 35 years since World War II. So what do you propose to do with<br />
your own defence budget?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think. a-little while will unfold that. We have already asked our<br />
officials to examine the circumstances, I think a month or more<br />
ago, when this first unfolded.. I asked our defence advisors to see<br />
how this affects the strategic assessment, which had been examined<br />
shortly before Christmas. It was a new event and an important event<br />
and therefore how it affects our own defence planning and defence<br />
preparedness. All that work has been going on for some weeks.<br />
Wil1le see<br />
When would you see something eventuating, in the budget, in August?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It may well be earlier than that.<br />
Will esee<br />
It just * seems to me that if the threat is now then presumably<br />
believing that you take some action now?<br />
Prime minister<br />
Look you are starting to impinge on matters that I do want to put<br />
and discuss first in the United States. So maybe we do not have<br />
to go too far down this particular track tonight.<br />
Will esee<br />
Yes I respect that with defence matters you often can't answer,<br />
but equally the people watching tonight one of the first things<br />
I think they'll have in mind, when you say this is the greatest<br />
threat in 35 years, is what we're going to do about it and how it<br />
will effect them. Can you tell us at least that we will be spending<br />
more money on defence? </p>
<p>Prime minister'<br />
I think I have already said that I am very glad that that increased<br />
oil revenue had not been committed in some area, whether it is by<br />
tax reduction or the rest, because we do need to look to Australia's<br />
defences. I would be surprised if there is not an increased<br />
requirement coming out of that.<br />
Willesee So you'd be looking at that extra billion dollars or so a year from<br />
tax Prime minister<br />
Well look I am not putting a figure on it. But what I am doinglook<br />
we are taking this very seriously. We have already offered<br />
increased facilities or use of facilities and increased patrolling<br />
and surveillance in the Indian Ocean on Australia's account.<br />
Wil1le see<br />
But that's not building our forces.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Ah but it might well require, depending upon the nature of the<br />
obligation undertaken that could perhaps require, built up over<br />
time, some greater capacity. Because we were not making that offer<br />
against a short term circumstance something that could happen for<br />
a week or a month, or two or three months, but against a long term<br />
chain in Australia's strategic circumstance. So we were looking at,<br />
offering a-long term obligation.<br />
Willesee So you foreshadow a greater expenditure on defence?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It is inevitable. It really is.<br />
Wil1le see<br />
Well it's inevitable in the normal course of inflation.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I am not talking about just inflation. I am talking about it in<br />
real terms. Let us not forget that even though we have had one . or<br />
two budgetary problems over the last three or four years, defence<br />
expenditure has been increased in real terms in each of those years.<br />
Willesee. But our defence forces have been rundown over the last couple of<br />
governments haven't they?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
They were run down over a period. We have done some rebuilding. </p>
<p>Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
We have now when we came into office the amount spent on capital<br />
equipment was about 6 or 7 per cent of the vote. We have got that<br />
up to about 15 or 16 per cent of the vote. We want to get it higher.<br />
Wi liese e<br />
What about manpower? Would you rule out looking again at conscription<br />
or even national service?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I do not see it as being a requirement for that at this point. I<br />
do not imagine that that would be one of the options that the<br />
defence planners would want to put to us when we are considering<br />
these matters. Because I think it is important you have<br />
repeated my remark, that this is the most serious circumstance for<br />
years. can I just take a second to say why that is so.<br />
Willesee ( After commercial break)<br />
Mr. Prime Minister you wanted to explain why you see this threat<br />
to world peace as being the worst since World War II.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes. There have been a number of crises, especially in the Cold<br />
War period Berlin, Korea, Cuba. Now all of those were important<br />
in a regional context. They were also important because they were<br />
a threat or a challenge to the strength , to the determination of<br />
what was known as the free world. Now those elements are present<br />
in this crisis. But there is an additional element that was not<br />
present in the Berlin matter, North Korea or Cuba. And that is,<br />
if the Soviets take the step further we were talking about, if they<br />
do a turn into Iran and start to gain an entrance or a control over<br />
some part of Middle East oil production then they have an addition,<br />
the capacity to vastly damage or even to destroy the economies of<br />
advanced industrial countries. And that is why I believe you have<br />
not only the strategic circum'stances, you have an economic element<br />
that-was-not-present on earlier occasions. And that is why I think<br />
it is more dangerous and more important than those earlier<br />
occurrences. Willesee Mr. Prime Minister you say you believe that and you've had some<br />
criticism of various kinds for saying that. Let me put the most<br />
serious personal criticism bluntly. Has your thinking on this<br />
matter been influenced by the fact that this is an election year?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, not at all. And I know one or two people have said that. But<br />
the people who have said that have also indicated as I believe that<br />
this is a very serious occurrence. Look this is the kind of thing </p>
<p>Wi liese e<br />
I'm sorry I wasn't suggesting that even your critics think that<br />
you are blowing up the fact that it was serious when it's not.<br />
I'm sure even they believe that it's quite serious. But you must<br />
take into account things like politicians do tend to be a little<br />
more sensitive in an election year, and you've seen President<br />
Carter's popularity go up over Iran and Afghanistan.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Oh I have. But I was not worried about events that were going to<br />
occur at the end of this year anyway, because I had a total<br />
confidence in that. But let me only say that nothing will please<br />
me more if there can be a unity and a cohesiveness within Australia<br />
on this particular issue. I do not want it to be a matter of<br />
division. It is far too important for that. And when I spoke to<br />
Premier Lowe in Tasmania about the fishing matter and said that<br />
we had knocked that off and said that I was sorry because I know<br />
how important he regarded it, he said: look, I don't quarrel with the<br />
decision. In the circumstances he could not have done anything<br />
else. I had gone through the range of the decisions with him and<br />
he supported. I think ' that shows a bipartisan attitude which I<br />
hope on this issue can be echoed right around Australia, because<br />
it is of vast importance to all of us.<br />
Willesee I think the question is not so much the seriousness of it but<br />
whether you might be overreacting. The Labor Leader Mr. Hayden<br />
I think was quoted today as saying that you were being hysterical<br />
about it.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well all right. You know he said on one account that it was<br />
overreacting but on another account he said he did not want us to<br />
say anything about the Olympic Games unless a whole lot of countries<br />
were going to, so that we wo~ ild ' know it would be an effective<br />
boycott. So that seems to be not'really very important.<br />
Willesee Even if you want to leave political matters out of this, they can<br />
still come into it of course, even as a by-product, did you say<br />
as somebody alleged in a written commentary, to some of your<br />
colleagues, that this Russian aggression was electorally useful to<br />
your party?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. Of course I would not have said that. Because it is too<br />
important. It is not a matter to be dealt with on a partisan basis.<br />
It is a matter to be dealt with, and especially from my position,<br />
above all as Prime minister of this nation, as one of the greatest<br />
possible seriousness and one in which there is only one thought in<br />
my mind and only one thought in the mind of this Government the<br />
wellbeing and security of all the Australian people. </p>
<p>8<br />
Willesee Mr. Prime Minister did President Carter's decision on the boycott<br />
of the Moscow Games, dependent on the Russians not getting out by<br />
February 20 did his decision jam you into an early decision?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
obviously we were influenced by his decision. Because it is necessary<br />
to understand in matters of this kind where we believe that<br />
basically the United States President is-taking a proper course,<br />
is acting from firmness and strength and that he is right it is<br />
important for countries such as Australia to lend what support they<br />
can. He has got the loneliest job in the world the President of<br />
the most powerful free world country. It is important from his<br />
point of view and from the point of view of the United States people<br />
and the support that they give their President, to know that there<br />
are people in other parts of the world with a similar view, a<br />
similar concern. I make no apologies for that.<br />
Willesee I understand that logic. But on the question of timing obviously<br />
there would be some wisdom in waiting a little longer to see if it<br />
was going to be an effective boycott.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Oh look you could have argued that. That is a legitimate point of<br />
view. But if every country is going to stand back and wait till<br />
they know the boycott is effective there will never be a boycott.<br />
Somebody has to be amongst the first half dozen. If it was<br />
Australia's lot to be that then so be it. Quite a number of<br />
countries, on the advice we have at this moment, seem to be moving<br />
in that direction. It is early days yet but time will show us.<br />
Willesee on the question of our own athletes going to Moscow if they-still<br />
wish to. You were not specific in saying how far you would go in<br />
not supporting them. For example the $ 500,000 cheque which is due:<br />
would you hand that cheque over on condition that it is not used<br />
to send athletes to Moscow?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It is going to be handed over. Mr. Ellicott is going to do that.<br />
I said in the letter to the Olympic Committee that no matter what<br />
happened we wanted that money to be used to provide opportunities<br />
for Australian sportsmen and sportswomen. There is no question of<br />
the Government seeking or wanting to take that money back.<br />
Willesee<br />
Will you allow that money to be used to send athletes to Moscow?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It is still on one scenario. The Games in Moscow could even have<br />
our support. But if the Russians are still in Afghanistan we would<br />
not want that money used for that particular purpose. We would<br />
want the Olympic Committee to use it for other purposes to advance </p>
<p>Prime minister ( continued)<br />
the interests of Australian sportsmen and women.<br />
Wi lies ee<br />
So at this stage you are not freeing that money for athletes to go<br />
to Moscow with it.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. Not for Moscow, no.<br />
Wilies ee<br />
And could you be even firmer and take some action to stop athletes<br />
going? Prime Minister<br />
We have not considered that and it is too early. We believe, well<br />
I certainly hope, belief at this stage might be too strong, but I<br />
hope very strongly that the Olympic Committee will support the<br />
Government in these particular matters. I know they have got a<br />
serious and a hard decision to make and I know how much it can mean<br />
to an athlete who has trained and been in competitions, internationals<br />
competitions, wanting to get to the pinnacle at the Olympic Games.<br />
But I had immense respect for that young Australian on one of the<br />
Melbourne channels last night, a swimmer, who got up and made it<br />
plain that he said that he believed a gesture had to be made. And<br />
no matter what it meant to him, he thought that the Games should not<br />
be held in Moscow. That must have taken a great deal of saying.<br />
Because I can understand the hard work and the ambition and the<br />
hopes that lie within an Olympic athlete's heart.<br />
Wi liessee<br />
Mr. Prime Minister thanks foi your time tonight.--<br />
Prime minister<br />
Thank you very much. 000---</p>
