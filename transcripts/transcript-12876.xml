The Prime Minister and the Chairman of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) are pleased to announce that the second Prime Minister';s XI versus ATSIC Chairman';s XI cricket match will be played at Manuka Oval in Canberra on Friday 8 March 2002.<br />
The staging of the 2002 match follows the success of the first game held between a Prime Minister';s XI and an ATSIC Chairman';s XI in April 2001.<br />
The staging of these matches was first proposed by Mr Geoff Clark as a way to encourage young Indigenous cricketers, and also to recognise the significance of the participation of Indigenous Australians in cricket both prior to and since Australian Federation.<br />
The match will provide an important opportunity for promising young Indigenous cricketers to participate in a game against and alongside Australian and state level players.<br />
It is intended that as was the case last year, the match will be a standard one day game.<br />
The Prime Minister and the ATSIC Chairman wish to thank the Australian Cricket Board and the ACT Cricket Association for their continuing support for the Prime Minister';s XI versus ATSIC Chairman';s XI matches.<br />
The Australian community, and especially cricket fans, are urged to support this game.<br />
Mr Clark said he would like to see the match become an annual showcase for young Indigenous cricketers and move to different venues around the country from next year. </p>
