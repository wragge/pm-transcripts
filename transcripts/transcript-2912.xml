6 May 1973<br />
CO-OPERATION IN SPACE PROJECT<br />
Australia will have access to special information<br />
obtained through America's proposed " Skylab" manned space<br />
laboratory. Federal Cabinet today was told that access to the.<br />
information would be provided under the Australian/ U. S.<br />
agreement on scientific co-operation through the new<br />
Ministry of Science.<br />
The channelling of the information through the<br />
Science Ministry will mark the start of an overall move of<br />
projects associated with the U. S. National Aeronautics an<br />
Space Administration from the control of the Ministry of<br />
Supply to that of Australia's Ministry of Science.<br />
A special meeting of Cabinet in Sydney was -o] d<br />
that because of Australian co-operation in the " Skylab"<br />
venture, Australia would be able to make special requests<br />
to the " Skylab" team for photographs and reports on Aust: ralia.<br />
These would be valuable in planning mineral exploration,<br />
assessing the extent of pollution and discovering disease<br />
in major forest projects.<br />
The handover of the chief participatory role in<br />
America's post-Apollo space programme from Supply to the<br />
Department of Science will continue gradually in coming<br />
months.<br />
