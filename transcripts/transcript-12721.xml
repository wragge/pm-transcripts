<p>E&amp;OE...........</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what';s your reaction to Mr Rais';s comments and what is the status of our relationship with Indonesia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the claims Mr Rais made that we';d accused the Indonesian Government of people smuggling, that claim is wrong. The other is also wrong â€“ the allegation that we don';t support the national integrity of the Indonesian Republic, that we are fomenting fragmentation that';s wrong also.  Look it';s his decision. It won';t make any difference at all to the visit. I';m leaving for Jakarta this afternoon. I';m having a lengthy meeting with the President.  We';re having dinner tonight and we';ll have further discussions there and I';m looking forward to the visit. It';s an important relationship and one that I';m sure will benefit from this visit.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And there are other senior politicians who you aren';t meeting. Is that something that concerns you also?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No it doesn';t really. I think you should perhaps ask some questions inside Indonesia as to the reasons for that. But I';m untroubled.  Thank you.</p>
