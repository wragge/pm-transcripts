FOR PRESS 15 February 1978<br />
DROUGHT<br />
The Prime Minister today said there would be a major review of<br />
drought relief arrangements.<br />
Mr Fraser said he had written. to the Premiers of New South<br />
Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and Western<br />
Australia asking for their agreement to the holding of a meeting<br />
of Commonwealth and State officials shortly to review the drought<br />
situation throughout mainland Australia.-<br />
While some Premiers had requested extensions of the existing<br />
measures supported under the natural disaster financial assistance<br />
arrangements, good rains in some areas had resulted in an easing<br />
of drought conditions.<br />
It was now time, Mr Fraser said, to completely reassess the<br />
situation to see what measures were needed to assist those<br />
producers who had not benefitted from the rain.<br />
In many areas, of course, follow up rains would be required<br />
before it could be said the drought had broken.<br />
While the States have the primary responsibility for deciding<br />
on measures which the Commonwealth should be asked to support,<br />
the Prime minister emphasised that the Commonwealth wished to<br />
ensure that all practicable steps were being taken to ensure<br />
that farmers throughout the drought areas received whatever<br />
support is required to see them through this difficult period. </p>
