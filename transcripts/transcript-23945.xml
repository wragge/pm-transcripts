    <content><![CDATA[<p>This week Brisbane will host the G20 Summit.</p>
<p>It’s the most important meeting ever held in Australia.</p>
<p>It won’t be a talkfest. It’s an economic summit – so it will focus on what can be done to create jobs, identify tax cheats and improve the world economy.</p>
<p>As this year’s President of the G20, Australia has set an agenda based on three themes:</p>
<p>First, to promote economic growth and jobs growth by strengthening the private sector.</p>
<p>Second, to make the global economy more resilient to future shocks.</p>
<p>And third, to strengthen global institutions because in uncertain times, strong institutions make all the difference.</p>
<p>Our focus is on the economy, because G20 members account for 85 per cent of the world economy and 75 per cent of world trade.</p>
<p>We have a very clear goal: to boost global economic growth by two per cent above what is currently expected over the next five years.</p>
<p>All the countries of the G20, including Australia, will be detailing their growth strategies at this summit.</p>
<p>Our plan reflects this Government’s Economic Action Strategy.</p>
<p>It focuses on the fundamentals: lowering tax, cutting red tape, investing in infrastructure, encouraging competition and increasing productivity.</p>
<p>Australia’s message to the world is that we are ‘open for business’.</p>
<p>I thank everyone who has worked so hard to ensure that Brisbane is ready for the summit.</p>
<p>It will be a big week for Brisbane with thousands of delegates and the international spotlight.</p>
<p>It will also be a big week for Australia – and I am confident that the G20 Summit will make a real difference to the lives of people right around the world.</p>
<p>9 November 2014</p>
