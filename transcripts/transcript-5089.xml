PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE FOLLOWING PREMERS' CONFERENCE. 29 JUNE 1979<br />
There are three aspects of the Premiers' Conference and<br />
Loan Council meeting to this point that I want to mention.<br />
Perhaps I should recall just for a moment two quite significant<br />
mat: ters that were determined yesterday: the very full<br />
o.~-) praL~ flbeLnveen the GS. a-es and the Commonwealth in<br />
relation to energy matters, the willingness of all the States.,<br />
but particularly NSW and South Australia, to reconsider the<br />
emission standards with the objective of getting a 10% better<br />
usage out of available petrol supplies that we do have in<br />
Australia. That was against the background of a number of<br />
other measures.<br />
I am hopeful -that the States will follow our lead in moving<br />
to gas fired cars, but the general consultative arrangements<br />
we have established on energy are important and very necessary.<br />
The other matter yesterday that we came to an agreement about<br />
concerned industrial relations and a willingness to examine<br />
the very fundamentals of the arrangements between the States<br />
and the Commonwealth. That obviously will involve the<br />
State Ministers, the Attorneys-General, with the objective<br />
of reporting back to a special Premiers' Conference later<br />
in this year. All Premiers entered into that willingly,<br />
recognising the very real and grave importance of those<br />
particular matters.<br />
So far as progress in other areas of the Premiers' Conference<br />
and Loan Council are concerned, I wanted to draw attention<br />
to the very significant movement towards the fulfillment<br />
of the commitment to local government, moving to 1.75% of<br />
income tax for local government, which will give them a<br />
substantial increase this year. On the general financial<br />
arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States, I know<br />
the States are, to some extent, concerned about the provision<br />
of loan funds. But I would point out that if there is to be<br />
any cutback in loan areas or in housing areas, that will be<br />
a very clear decision by the States -themselves because the<br />
financial reimbursement grants resulted in an increase of<br />
$ 644 million, or a little more. That is an increase of<br />
between 13% and 14% much, much more than is need to meet<br />
increased costs as a result of inflation. The States can<br />
switch those funds into any area that they like. The surplus<br />
in that area after it has looked after increased inflation,<br />
inflationary costs, should make up a very large part of any<br />
shortfall in loan funds.<br />
I think it is worth noting that over the last five years the<br />
State Public Services have grown at a much greater rate than<br />
the Commonwealth and the signs of stringency in State<br />
expenditure are not as severe by any means as those in the<br />
Coimmonwealth's. The States, as a result of the decisions that / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
have been reached, are left with a wide area of discretion to<br />
look after their own priorities as they see fit -There is<br />
no reason why any particular area should go short I-L will be<br />
a question of the States making judgements about their own<br />
priorities as they believe best and they'll have to carry the<br />
responsibility for the decisions that they make. Now, having<br />
said that, on another matter I'd like to say that I believe<br />
this particular Premiers' Conference is of far-reaching and<br />
great national significance because it was brought -to a<br />
successful conclusion. Agreements on the outstanding matters<br />
relating to the Seas and Submerged Lands Act. We all know<br />
the problems that were caused by this particular dispute by<br />
-the High Court decision, which gave effective power to the<br />
' J~ lfO~ iv~. Lt1 rom tnh.? lnw--4ater imark, au ndl there h-1ve bee.,<br />
long and patient negotiations over the last 2 years, deirc<br />
to resolve in a practical way the problems that arose as a<br />
result of it.<br />
The Commonwealth has approached the issue on the basis, not<br />
of following the Court and saying, we have a power, we're<br />
going to assert it, we're going to use it. We've approached<br />
this whole matter on the basis of saying, well, all right,<br />
the Court has presented us with a practical problem, which<br />
we've got to overcome as practical people. The States don't<br />
lose an interest in what happens, matters of concern to the<br />
State at low-water mark. They're obviously very much<br />
interested and concerned with what happens out to sea and in<br />
the territorial sea and so we've come to arrangements over a<br />
wide range of specific areas, mining and fisheries, pollution<br />
and navigation and shipping control. A number of specific<br />
agreements, many of them based on the concept of joint<br />
authorities between the States and -the Commonwealth, which have<br />
finally put to rest any disputation and argument or disagreement<br />
between any of the States and the Commonwealth.<br />
I think it's a classic example of the way in which patient<br />
negotiation can bring about a successful conclusion. There's<br />
been good-will on both sides and I'd certainly like to pay<br />
a tribute to the manner in which the Commonwealth Officers<br />
and States and the Ministers concerned, the functional<br />
Ministers and the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth and<br />
the States have negotiated this mat-ter to a final conclusion.<br />
The last outstanding matter was negotiated to a successful<br />
conclusion only last night and this morning, but it was the<br />
one matter outstanding and it does represent a very<br />
significant advance. The whole arrangement is a significant<br />
example of the way in which Governments ought to negotiate,<br />
ought to consult on matters of importance to both. From now<br />
on, on any detailed matters relating to the financial matters,<br />
the Treasurer is here and in relation to the Seas and<br />
Submerged Lands Act, because there are a number of detailed<br />
matters in that area that you might well be interested in,<br />
the Attorney-General is here. So one of the three of us ought<br />
to be able to answer your questicns. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Ques tion<br />
Mr. Howard, firstly, the Premiers have come out of the Loan<br />
Council meeting saying that is it a farce; that if the<br />
Commonwealth Government keeps giving them this offer virtually<br />
that they can't refuse, you may as well just post it to them<br />
and they won't bother travelling here. What's your response<br />
to that?<br />
Mr. Howard<br />
I think -that's an over-reaction, intemperate over-reaction.<br />
Thc:, : a ct s tha w e'v\/ e h av e ftrour L oan Council Meetings in the<br />
la'i Ye* ar c-Lnd 1on th11in'k you've hneard any Premiers saying;<br />
that after the last Loan Council meeting or the one in Melbourne<br />
in November which approved the infrastructure programmes.<br />
The Premiers naturally want more -than they get at Loan Council<br />
Meetings. We have our problems. We gave a lot of thought to<br />
the offer which we put on the table at this meeting. We don't<br />
believe in Dutch auctions. The proposal that we made to the<br />
Premiers was the proposal that we felt we could afford, that we<br />
thought was consistent with the sort of things that the Federal<br />
Government should be doing, given our present economic circumstances,<br />
and was couched against -the background of the very large increase<br />
in general funds of 13 1/ 2 percent that the States will get unde: r<br />
the tax sharing arrangements in 1979/ 80.<br />
Question If you will pardon my ignornance, could you tell me how many<br />
States have so far legislated to make it possible to make it<br />
possible to go into this next stage of Federalism in which they<br />
can put on taxes ( inaudible).<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't think any of them have.<br />
Question<br />
None? Do you think this really indicates that they are not taking<br />
the new Federalism very seriously?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
The option is there. That's their decision. * we are not urging<br />
it upon them. What we do urge is that States make their own<br />
decisions and don't hide behind decisions of the Commonwealth.<br />
We didn't see any reason why we should put up our taxes to enable<br />
other governments to spend more.<br />
Question Were there any negotiations as to a -tax sharing formula for<br />
next year? / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We haven't discussed that yet.<br />
Question Would you anticipate that the level would remain as it is,<br />
with the State provision...<br />
Mr. Howard<br />
Ques tion<br />
Senator Durack, do the offshore proposals involve any approach<br />
to the Imperial Parliament? Would they require any action by..<br />
the Imperial Parliament?<br />
Senator Durack<br />
No. It has been a very firm decision that we have made and<br />
have maintained in these discussions, that these imatters must<br />
be resolved within Australia and through the Australian Parlia-E-t<br />
.1 will hopefully now be introducing legislation and my colleagues<br />
in respect of functional-areas will be introducing the iegislatic.)<br />
to give effect to this very great package. It will be a major<br />
lecgislative exercise and we hope to be able to get it introducec.<br />
the Bills introduced in the Budget session. But certainly w~ z-<br />
Wil be moving along as quickly-as possible. What we did discuss<br />
was -the possibility of a once and for all review of some of thiese<br />
old United Kingdom legislation as affects thei States and that's<br />
been decided to refer that matter to the Standing Committees of<br />
Attorneys-General for study with no commitment by the Coimmonwealth-<br />
Government or indeed any of -the Governments to make that approach.<br />
I've got to emphasise that.. But we are putting it to study because<br />
there is, in old United Kingdom legislation, some restrictions<br />
on States.<br />
Question<br />
This would involve Privy Council?<br />
Senator Durack<br />
That was one of the matters, yes.<br />
Question Prime Minister, some of the Premiers have said that they will<br />
either have to increase taxes or raise taxes and charges, or eli-e<br />
take decisions which will result in higher unemployment. Do you<br />
think those are their only alternatives, and whir: h alternative<br />
would you recommend? </p>
<p>Prime Minister<br />
I wouldn't recommend to the Premiers. I've got no doubt that<br />
they are independent people and will make their own independent<br />
decisions. But I would point out, and this was something which<br />
Premiers were not all that willing to acknowledge I would poin~ t<br />
out that the tax reimbursement grant increase of $ 644 million,<br />
of 13% to 14%, is very much more than would be needed to cover<br />
increased costs in that particular area if you are maintaining<br />
the same level of activity in that area. They can spend those<br />
sums, therefore, in whatever way the States want to. If they<br />
want to transfer some Of that recurrent monev~ to capital purposes,<br />
h~ i-ae ftn aione in th-. e past, then th y can1 do SO.<br />
In what they have been saying, I've got no doubt the Premiers<br />
have concentrated on the very real restraint in the capital area;<br />
a res traint that we believe is. right for a number of reasons.<br />
We do need to point out that that increase of $ 644 million is a<br />
very substantial one. It is be-tween 13% and 14%* and it does give<br />
enormous flexibility to the States as to how they order -their<br />
own affairs.<br />
Ques tion<br />
Mr. Fraser, you have already extended once from three years -to<br />
four years the period of the Whitlam guarantee on the revenue<br />
funds. Are you quite firm that you won't be extending it any more.<br />
That four years is the end of that?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think since that matter is still to-be debated I should advise<br />
the Premiers of our view before I advise other people. But I<br />
would be very happy to answer any questions about that later in<br />
the day.<br />
Question-( Bowers)<br />
Mr. Howard, a moment ago you used the phrase " we have our problems".<br />
May I assume you are refdrring to the financial problems that<br />
you foresee for -the financial year 1979/ 80. Did you spell out<br />
these problems to the Premiers and would you like to spell them<br />
out to us?<br />
Mr. Howard<br />
I can't give you a preview of the 21st of August but the sort of<br />
things I am referring to is the fact that there are some<br />
re-emerging inflation pressures in the community. We still have<br />
too large a budget deficit. Indeed, we have two big a public<br />
sector borrowing requirement all together. It is not just a<br />
Commonwealth deficit. It is all the money that governments try<br />
and extract from the capital markets that put pressure on interest<br />
rates. We have certain expenditure responsibilities of an everincreasing.<br />
kind, such as social security commitmwnts which aren't<br />
carried by the States. The point that we have made at this<br />
Conference is very simple this: that the Commonwealth Government: has<br />
taken a number of very very difficult decisions against the backcfround<br />
of these circumstances because we believe it was responsible to<br />
do so and we are not prepared to increase Commonwealth taxation to<br />
support the priorities of other governments. I think it is also<br />
/ 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
Mr. Howard ( continued)<br />
worth observing as a footnote to Mr. Kruger's question a<br />
moment ago, that Mr. Wran stood on the steps of this building<br />
12 months ago and said the unemployment level in Australia<br />
would go from 6% to 10% as a result of the decisions that were<br />
announced at the last Premiers Conference. Now we all knoq that<br />
hasn't. The point I simply make is that a certain degree of<br />
reactive rhetoric after these conferences is often the case.<br />
Question ( Kruger)<br />
.1 -C t ,7 n t b<br />
n f. L your r; iy s cai. you juarantee t . on't be<br />
increases in taxes in the budget?<br />
Mr. Howard<br />
I am not going to speculate what's in the Budget.<br />
Question ( Lockyer)<br />
Mr. Howard, what was the decision regarding infrastructure<br />
financing. Was there some relaxation for the States of that<br />
three year freeze?<br />
Mr. Howard<br />
Well, I will be putting out a detailed statement on that but it<br />
is no premature disclosure to say that we have approved in<br />
essence the draw-downs put forward by the States under the projec-s<br />
which we approved last October. We have indicated that we will<br />
support, as an infrastructure proposal, the first stage of the<br />
electrification of Brisbane railway line which picks up a co-im.-. tmenz<br />
made in the 1977 policy speech. We have said that we will<br />
give in prificiple, support to a transmission proposal of Alcoa's<br />
in Victoria. In those circumstances because both of those<br />
projects would, as it were, vary the embargo of three years that<br />
was announced in October of last year, that we would consider<br />
any appropriate infrastructure proposals from other States.<br />
I should mention, in that context, that there have been a number<br />
there is likely to be some inevitable slippage on the programme<br />
that was approved last October. There has already been an<br />
agreed deferrment of one of the larger projects for a year or so<br />
and they are all the sort of things that we take into account.<br />
But that particular decision that I have just detailed is one tha_<br />
we took several days ago and it was our intention all along to<br />
indicate that attitude towards the infrastructure proposals.<br />
It wasn't in response to anything that arose during the course oE<br />
the past day and a half. It had always been our intention to do<br />
that just on the basis of fairness.<br />
Question ( Kruger)<br />
Prime Minister, has the Government given any consideration as to<br />
how it will apply the windfall revenue which will come to us<br />
through the OPEC decision. </p>
<p>-7<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That would be entering into the vein,-of speculation on the<br />
next budget.<br />
Question Mr. Fraser, in one area where the Conironwealthhas not really<br />
restrained its expenditure, rather the reverse, has been in what.<br />
the private sector would claim to be excessively generous<br />
-az rilna :: ion For Commonwealth Public Servants. 13 there any<br />
f. 0o. r1 11 ' isO get, Uut: cer control beforfe it : ceallv does<br />
become a bottomless pit in your budget.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There is no specific review. I think it is worth noting that<br />
when the scheme was under negotiation a number of measures were<br />
pruned back quite significantly. I am aware of the concern in<br />
some elements of the private sector, of the facts lying behind<br />
your question though.<br />
QuestLion Senator Durack, I rcfer you back to the decisions<br />
In your statement that we've just been handed, the Joint Commonwealth<br />
State Authority being set up -to ' regulate offshore petroleum mining.<br />
Is there implied in that that agreement has been reached on<br />
royalty arrangements for any minerals found outside the three<br />
mile limit?<br />
Senator Durack<br />
No. The royalty arrangements have not yet been resolved. There<br />
is of course existing royalty arrangements as you know, in relation<br />
to petroleum, but there isn't really any immediate urgency about<br />
minerals. 000---</p>
