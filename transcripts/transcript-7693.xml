STATEMENT BY PRIME MINISTER<br />
Administration of Aboriginal Affairs:<br />
Mr Menzies' Final Report<br />
Honourable Members will recall that; on' 11 April 1989, I<br />
made a statement in this House reporting on the outcome of a<br />
I<br />
series of inquiries into the administration of Aboriginal<br />
I<br />
Affairs. Those inquiries were established in response to<br />
allegations of s. erious shortcomings in the administration,<br />
including financial management, of the Aboriginal<br />
Development Commission and of the Department of Aboriginal<br />
Affairs. i<br />
F. i<br />
At that time, while the bulk of the inquiries had been<br />
completed, I advised the House. that-a further report was<br />
expected from the Auditor-General in! relation to some<br />
particular enterprise projects in the Aboriginal Development<br />
Commission. I also indicated that the Government was' awaiting a final<br />
report from Mr Andrew Menzies, . AM, OBE, on certain matters<br />
which had not in his view otherwise been dealt with to<br />
finality. i<br />
I made the point that, pending Mr Menzies' final report, it<br />
would be inappropriate to comment on. the conduct of any<br />
individual. .1033 () 7 </p>
<p>2.<br />
I also made it clear that, with the bulk of the inquiries<br />
then completed, the Government felt in a position to inform<br />
the Parliament of its views and intentions concerning<br />
organisational arrangements for the future, and I advised<br />
the House of actions which the Government proposed to take,<br />
while standing ready to-refine'our response and undertake<br />
I aN<br />
any further action should that be necessary when remaining<br />
reports were received.<br />
Madam Speaker, the final report from Mr Menzies was received<br />
by the Government during the parliamentary recess.<br />
That report has four arts, butlMr Menzies has recommended,<br />
and the Government acept, ' that Part 4 not be published,<br />
given that it contains onlyrnames and'addresses of certain<br />
persons and one Abori inal agency who made submissions in<br />
confidence. The report makes refe ence elsewhere to the inputs of the<br />
persons and agency concerned but their identities are not<br />
central to the issues discussed.'"<br />
Copies of Part 4 of the report have been made available to<br />
the Leader of the Oppoition ( Mr Peacock), the Leader of<br />
the National Party MBlunt),' tlhe Leader of the Opposition<br />
in the Senate ( Senator ' Chaney) and'the'Leader of the<br />
Australian Democrats enator Haines).<br />

FORINCIM MEMPR= 77 3. I<br />
For the information of Honourable' Members, I now table in<br />
the House the final report from Mr. Menzies, other than<br />
Part 4.<br />
Honourable Members will find that Part of the report is an<br />
introductory chapter, including an; overview.<br />
Part 2 covers the inquiries into three matters involving<br />
Mr Charles Perkins, to which I shall return shortly.<br />
Part 3 of the report deals with a; number of miscellaneous<br />
allegations which Mr Menzies has investigated. In the case<br />
of two of these allegations, the report indicates that they<br />
have been referred to police for investigation. By<br />
agreement with Mr Menzies, the Auditor-General will be<br />
reporting on one other case.<br />
In none of the cases in Part 3 on which Mr Menzies himself<br />
has reported was corruption or serious illegality<br />
established. While Mr Menzies finds some cases of questionable practice,<br />
he recognises that action is already in hand to respond<br />
properly in those cases. 1035<br />
I 7L 5 </p>
<p>4.<br />
In Part 3 of the report, the only'formal recommendation made<br />
I<br />
by Mr Nenaies relates to the activities of an organisation<br />
which is not a Commonwealth agency but is in receipt of<br />
Commonwealth funding. The relevant department, the<br />
Department of Commun ty' ervices and. Health, is acting on<br />
this recommendation. . Tht Department is also following up<br />
the recommendation that the activities of a South Australian<br />
Aboriginal agency be reviewed.<br />
I now turn to that p rt of the report which deals with<br />
matters involving Mr Charles Perkins.<br />
By way of introduction, I remind'Honourable Members that<br />
various allegations made about Commonwealth administration<br />
in the Aboriginal Affairs area' over the-past months have<br />
attracted a great deal of publicity.<br />
Many of the accusations have been extremely serious.<br />
Some, for example, alleged patronage, favouritism, nepotism<br />
and cronyism in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.<br />
Others alleged or implied: corruption.<br />
The name of Charles. Perkins was linked with many of those<br />
allegations and much of this publicity.<br />
1036 i </p>
<p>The facts are that none of the several inquJ<br />
for the Government, including this final; rei<br />
Mr Henzies, supports allegations of that kir ries conducted<br />
ort from<br />
d.<br />
I advised this House in April that the Public Service<br />
Commissioner did not substantiate allegations of patronage,<br />
favouritism, nepotism and cronyism in the Department of<br />
Aboriginal Affairs. I<br />
None of these reports has substantiated in any way<br />
allegations of corruption.<br />
It can and should be firmly said, therefore, that these<br />
serious allegations, so prominently publicised, have been<br />
i<br />
grossly unfair to Mr Perkins and his family.<br />
There is nothing which emerges from any of these intensive<br />
inquiries to suggest that Charles Perkins ever took any<br />
action out of self-interest or self-reward.'<br />
It is true that he has occasionally been aI cIontroversial<br />
figure; but only, I believe, where he saw this as important<br />
to his continuing effectiveness as. a leaderlof his people. 37<br />
bmh J" . I HeV </p>
<p>6.<br />
Honourable Members will see that this final report from<br />
Mr Menzies brings out some, further shortcomings in<br />
administration in the area of Aboriginal Affairs in some<br />
cases shortcomings for which Mr Perkins, as the departmental<br />
Secretary over much of theperiod, has to bear ultimate<br />
responsibility. Although such shortcomings are identified, however,<br />
Mr Menzies does not find 9at Mr Perkins' role in any of the<br />
three issues addressed in his' final report amounts to<br />
failure to fulfil his duty as an officer such that<br />
disciplinary action should ! or could be taken against him.<br />
I would add, Madam Speaker, that the bulk of the<br />
deficiencies identified in the'various inquiries conducted<br />
for the Government were in theiAboriginal Development<br />
Commission and not in the Department for which Mr Perkins<br />
carried ultimate responsiblity. And. even within the<br />
Department, there would be ' incongruity in any attempt to<br />
find the blame for most of these deficiencies in Charles<br />
Perkins personally. As the Public Service Commissioner<br />
found, there were deficienc es'in systems and procedures<br />
going well beyond the realm of Mr Perkins' personal<br />
responsibility.<br />

In the conclusions in his report, Mr Menzies-expressed<br />
I<br />
regret that Mr Perkins had refused to disclose to him the<br />

on which I wish to comment further. V<br />

The fact that Mr Menzies was not satisfied with this<br />
response has caused Mr Perkins' advisers to; wri~ te to me<br />
submitting further information. I now table ti eir letter.<br />
The epttor ntsoutthat Mr Perkins' refusal to disclose<br />
the precise source of the funds was based on leigal advice<br />
first in relation to a dispute over Mr Menzlies'I Jurisdiction<br />
in this matter and, secondly, on what was seen as an undue<br />
invasion of personal privacy. .1039 </p>
<p>8.<br />
Given the conclusions o this matter reported by Mr Menzies,<br />
however, and notwithsta ding their continuing concerns about<br />
privacy, Mr Perkins and Ihis legal . advisers have now provided 20 y<br />
dee<br />
in their letter to me an unequivocal assurance from<br />
Mr Perkins that he paid for the. taxis out of his own pocket. fro<br />
I accept that assurance. He i<br />
up t<br />
untJ<br />
I state again that none of these various and extensive best<br />
inquiries commissioned by the Government has found any<br />
I of v<br />
evidence of misconduct or other ' actions by Mr Perkins of a<br />
serious kind warranting disa iplinary action or censure.<br />
1 r Cha]<br />
I<br />
It is time this House and this Parliament put those matters ro Abor<br />
behind it and instead expressed its recognition of the<br />
substantial contribution Charles Perkins has made throughout pos<br />
his working life in the interests of advancing the cause of was<br />
the Aboriginal people. I inv peot<br />
Mr Perkins was at the va guard ofi-Aboriginal people to have Thi.<br />
a degree conferred on him from an Australian university, and<br />
while at university was President of Student Action for vies<br />
Aborigines. . admiadmi<br />
S| whic<br />
He became more widely known'during the period from 1965 to<br />
1969 when he was Manager of the Foundation for Aboriginal<br />
Affairs. I<br />
1040 </p>
<p>9.<br />
He then moved into the government arena and for<br />
years has been applying all' his energy, ' and<br />
deeply on his commitment, to advance the cause. c<br />
from his various positions within the Government i some raving f his people<br />
He has been a path-breaker for his people -in': woIking his way<br />
up through public service ranks in a competitive environment<br />
until he reached the top the position from which he was<br />
best able to guide the development of. policies and programs<br />
of value to Aboriginal people.<br />
Charles Perkins believed that one of his most important<br />
roles was to keep in close touch with as many individual<br />
Aboriginal people, and as many Aboriginal communities, as he<br />
possibly could. Accordingly, he travelled extensively, and<br />
was able to bring to this and previous ' governments an<br />
invaluable insight into the concerns and attitudes of his<br />
people. This is the context in which Honorable Members Ishould<br />
view the reflections in these various inquiry reports on<br />
administrative shortcomings in organisational areas for<br />
which Mr Perkins has had responsibility. I, I I .1041 </p>
<p>Madam Speaker, Charles Perkins advised me some time ago that<br />
he wished to retire fromithe public service as soon as<br />
possible to pursue an alternative career, and has recently<br />
arranged to do so in the normal way through the Public<br />
Service Commissioner. I am advised hingetirement will take<br />
effect from today.<br />
I express, on behalf of the Government, regret that his<br />
services as a full-time officer will be lost to the<br />
Government, and I hope Honourable Members will join me<br />
in wishing him well in. h as future. career.<br />
For the Government's part.. it will be actively seeking<br />
appropriate opportunitie to engage Mr Perkins in<br />
appropriate part-time. activity so, that the wealth of his<br />
knowledge and experience is-not totally lost to the<br />
Commonwealth. I<br />
In conclusion, Madam Speaker,, I want to turn to the central<br />
issue in all of these in uiries the quality of<br />
administration in Aboriginal Affairs.<br />
S1<br />
I remind the House of the Government's approach set out in<br />
my statement of 11 April: that we should draw upon the<br />
lessons from these inquiries and look to the future,<br />
ensuring that mechanisms are put in place and support<br />
provided so that future administration is enhanced.<br />
1042 i </p>
<p>i~ I<br />
S'i<br />
11.<br />
Since then, steps have been taken in both the Aboriginal<br />
Development Commission and the Department of Aboriginal<br />
Affairs to respond to findings in the earlier inquiry<br />
reports which were addressed in my statement.<br />
In the case of the Aboriginal Development Commission, the<br />
adequacy of the Commission's procedures, systems and<br />
management controls has been audited by Price Waterhouse in<br />
the light of the findings in the earlier inquiries, and the<br />
recommendations from Price Waterhouse have now been<br />
implemented. A Budget Management Commite and Audit<br />
Committee consisting of senior managers have been<br />
established in order to strengthen financial management and<br />
accountability. The Commission has also established a<br />
computer-based reporting system on program aid project<br />
performance using monitoring indicators si" ilar to those<br />
used in its reports to the Senate Estimate Committee.<br />
Program and project performance reports ar provided<br />
regularly to the Minister f Aboriginal Affairs.<br />
In the case of the Department, substantial progress has been<br />
made in the development of' program budgetig and in the<br />
provision of training for implementation ok program<br />
budgeting and continues to be made in the administration of<br />
grant programs.<br />
i1 1043<br />
1 </p>
<p>Ways in which aboriginalisation may be advanced are under<br />
discussion with Unions, It. h 7e Public Service Commission and<br />
the Department of Employment, Education and Training.<br />
New guidelines have been issued for official hospitality and<br />
for use of consultants; travel practices have been<br />
reviewed; and corrective action has been taken in regard to<br />
classification matters as recommended by the Department of<br />
Finance. I I I<br />
Most importantly, priority has been given to staff<br />
development and training w* hIi ch will provide the specialist<br />
skills required for the new Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander Commission ( ATSIC).<br />
I conclude by reminding Honourable Members of what I said in<br />
this House about ATSIC in my statement on 11 April.<br />
1<br />
The Government's view then was and still is that this new<br />
Commission is the logical and appropriate next step for the<br />
advancement of both the great principles of self-management<br />
and ministerial accounta ility.<br />

Nothing in the earlier inquiry reports, nor ir this final<br />
report from Mr Henzies, has shifted that belief on the part<br />
of the Government. Indeed, as I said in April, the inquiry<br />
reports give us encouragement that the. proposed structure of<br />
ATSIC will be beneficial. As Prime Minister fully<br />
support, and the Government as a whole fully supports, the<br />
initiatives the Minister has taken in proposing the creation<br />
of ATSIC.<br />
As Honourable Members know, we have made : some amendments to<br />
the ATSIC legislation in the light. of'these various inquiry<br />
reports and the report of the Senate Select Committee.<br />
Having done so, we are now firmly committed-tb proceeding<br />
with this legislation and establishing this body as quickly<br />
as possible.<br />
I hope this House and this Parliament'willinow accept that<br />
passage of this legislation an establishment of ATSIC is<br />
clearly in the best interests both of good'government and of<br />
the necessary advancement of the administration of<br />
aboriginal policy and programs for the benefit of the<br />
aboriginal people of this country. 1045 </p>
