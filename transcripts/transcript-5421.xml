PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 19 AUGUST 180<br />
MR. OHIRA<br />
Mr. Speaker, it is with deep regret that I also inform the House<br />
of the death, on 12 June, 1980, of the Prime Minister of Japan,<br />
Mr. Masayoshi Ohira and I move: " That this House records its<br />
sincere regret at the death of Mr. Masayoshi Ohira, Prime-Minister.<br />
of Japan, and express its deepest sympathy to his family and<br />
to the people of Japan."<br />
Mr. Speaker, the House will wish to be advised formally that the<br />
Government extended its deep sympathy to the Government and people<br />
of Japan, and that I represented Australia at Mr. Ohira's<br />
memorial service.<br />
Mr. Masayoshi Ohira led the Japanese Government at a time when<br />
changing international circumstances presented the Japanese<br />
nation with considerable uncertainties. A wisdom born of<br />
wide experience coupled with a deep personal commitment to<br />
the shaping of a better world for future generations-, earned<br />
Mr. Ohira great international esteem. His wise advice and<br />
considered counsel gained him the respect of leaders around<br />
the world.<br />
Mr. Ohira recognised the important role which Japan-has to play<br />
in international affairs as a member of the Western alliance.<br />
He was concerned to enhance Japan's political and economic<br />
contribution to world peace and security. His understanding of<br />
the changing circumstances in Asia and the Pacific led Mr. Ohira<br />
to play an active part in seeking closer ties between the<br />
countries of the region.<br />
His promotion of the concept of a Pacific community is an<br />
outstanding example of this. In January this year Mr. Ohira visited<br />
Australia. He was welcomed both as a representative of one of the<br />
countries most important to Australia, and as a national leader<br />
who strove to increase understanding and personal contact between<br />
the peoples of different countries. I believe that his visit<br />
made a lasting contribution to the strengthening of relations<br />
between our two countries. We all mourn his death.<br />
