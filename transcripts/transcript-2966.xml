3rd July 1973<br />
INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE COMMISSION<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that Cabinet<br />
had agreed to recommend at the appropriate time to the<br />
Executive Council that Mr G. A. Rattigan, C. B. E. be<br />
appointed as Chairman of the Industries Assistance<br />
Commission. The drafting of legislation to establish the<br />
Commission is proceeding as a matter of urgency and will<br />
be considered by Ministers as soon as possible.<br />
Mr Rattigan will assist in the drafting of the legislation.<br />
Mr Rattigan has been Chairman of the Australian<br />
Tariff Board since 1963. Before that time he had been<br />
Comptroller-General of the Department of Customs and Excise<br />
and had held a number of senior positions in the<br />
Department of Trade.<br />
The Industries Assistance Commission stems from<br />
the Labor Party platform and from the undertaking made by<br />
the Government in the Governor--Genera]' s speech on<br />
27 February 1973 to establish a Commission to advise on<br />
assistance for both primary and secondary industries.<br />
Sir John Crawford was asked by the Prime Minister on<br />
1 March 1973 to report on the establishment of the<br />
Commission and that report was received by the Government<br />
on 19 June and made public on 26 June.<br />
