ANNEXES lA U ST RAI,<br />
PRIME MINIS TER<br />
SPEECH BY THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON R. J. HAWKE, AC, MP, TO THE A<br />
WASHINGTON PRESS CLUB<br />
WASHINGTON, USA<br />
JUNE 1983<br />
I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE NATIONAL<br />
PRESS CLUB IN WASHINGTON, AND THROUGH SUCH A PRESTIGIOUS FORUM AND<br />
THE MEDIA REPRESENTED HERE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EsrECIALLY AS THIS<br />
OPPORTUNITY COMES SO EARLY IN THE LIFE OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT OF<br />
AUSTRALIA, ELECTED ON THE FIFTH OF MARCH THI1S YEAR.<br />
2. I DON'T WISH TO PRE-EMPT YOUR QUESTION TIME, BUT IN THESE<br />
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS, I SHOULD LIKE TO OUTLINE BRIEFLY AUSTRALIA'S<br />
INTERNATIONAL ROLE, AS MY NEW ADMINISTRATION SEES IT.<br />
3. AS GOOD A STARTING POINT AS ANY, IS THE ELECTION ON THE FIFTH OF<br />
MARCH4 ITSELF, WHEN BY A CONVINCING DECISION, THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA<br />
CHOSE A NEW GOVERNMENT, A NEW LEADERSHIP, AND NEW DIRECTIONS, AFTER<br />
SEVEN YEARS OF THE PREVIOUS CONSERVATIVE ADMINISTRATION.<br />
4. BUT IN DOING SO, THEY DID NOT SEEK OR CHOOSE ANY RADICAL CHANGE<br />
IN THE MAJOR DIRECTIONS OF AUSTRALIA'S FOREIGN POLICY, O. R IN OUR<br />
FUNDAMENTAL INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ESPECIALLY THE RELATIONSHIP WE<br />
HAVE WITH THE UNITED STATES.<br />
THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN ITSELF, DOMINATED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BY<br />
ECONOMIC ISSUES, WAS NOTABLY FREE OF CONTENTIOUS DEBATE ON MAJOR<br />
ISSUES OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENCE. TO ILLUSTRATE THIS POINT<br />
A1ND MORE IMPORTANTLY, TO ILLUSTRATE THE ESSENTIAL CONTINUITY WHICH<br />
UNDERLIES THE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT,, I CAN DO NO BETTER THAN QUOTE<br />
MYSELF, FROM WHAT WE CALL IN AUSTRALIA, ' THE POLICY SPEECH' WHICH<br />
IS THE BASIC DOCUMENT ON WHICH AUSTRALIAN ELECTION CAMPAIGNS ARE<br />
CONDUCTED. IN THAT SPEECH, I SAID:<br />
' THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE AND FOREIGN POLICY<br />
HAVE TAKEN ON A QUALITY OF BIPARTISANSHIP INCONCEIVABLE BEFORE 1972<br />
BEFORE THE ELECTION OF THE WHITLAM LABOR GOVERNMENT). THE GREAT<br />
QUESTIONS OF AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES, WITH<br />
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, THE SOVIET UNION, THE EUROPEAN<br />
ECONOMIC COMMUNITY, INDONESIA, OUR SPECIAL RELATIONSHIPS W4ITH THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH OF NATIONS, PAPUA NEW GUINEA, NEW ZEALAND AND JAPAN, AND<br />
OUR CONDUCT ON SOUTHERN AFRICAN QUESTIONS, NOW POSSESS A HIGH DEGREE<br />
OF CONTINUITY, CONSISTENCY, AND CONSENSUS.<br />
6. THAT DECLARATION W4AS ACCEPTED BY THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA AS THE<br />
BASIS OF OUR APPROACH, AND IN TURN, ACCEPTED BY US, AS THE NEWLY<br />
ELECTED GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA, AS AN INSTRUCTION FROM THE PEOPLE AS<br />
TO TH4E PROPER CONDUCT OF THEIR AFFAIRS IN OUR DEALINGS WITH THE<br />
NATTONS OF TIIF WORI </p>
<p>A?.<br />
7. BUT HAVING STRESSED THE CONINUITY WITHIN THE CHANGE, 1 SHQU1j<br />
IMMEDIATELY DEFINE THE MAIN ELEMENTS OF OUR APPROACH WHICH IN TERMS<br />
OF PERSPECTIVES OF TH4E WORLD AS IT REALLY IS, AND PERSPECTIVES OF<br />
AUSTRALIA'S ROLE AND INTERESTS AS THEY REALLY ARE, DO REPRESENT<br />
DISTINCTIVE AND SIGNIFICANT CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR ADMINISTRATION OF<br />
FOREIGN POLICY.<br />
8. FIRST, WE WILL PURSUE AN INDEPENDENT AND SELF-RESPECTING FOREIGN<br />
POLICY, BASED ON A COOL AND OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT HARDHEADED, IF YOU<br />
LIKE OF AUSTRALIA'S GENUINE NATIONAL INTEREST, BUT AT ALL TIMES,<br />
CONSISTENT WITH AUSTRALIA'S INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS. . WE WILL<br />
ALWAYS SEEK TO RESOLVE ANY DIFFERENCES THAT MAY ARISE WITH OTHER<br />
NATIONS THROUGH CONCILIATORY DIPLOMACY.<br />
9. BUT SHOULD OUR LEGITIMATE NATIONAL INTEREST BE CHALLENGED<br />
WHETHER IN MATTERS OF FOREIGN OR ECONOMIC POLICY OR SHOULD WE<br />
BELIEVE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES ARE AT STAKE, WE WILL RESPOND OPENLY,<br />
DIRECTLY, FORTHRIGHTLY.<br />
SECOND, WE WILL PURSUE A REALISTIC AND RELEVANT FOREIGN POLICY,<br />
ONE WHICH RECOGNISES AND ACCEPTS THE CONSTRAINTS ON OUR CAPABILITY<br />
AND THE LIMITATIONS OF OUR INFLUENCE. THAT MEANS, TO BE REALISTIC<br />
AND RELEVANT, THE FIRST PRIORITY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO OUR RELATIONS<br />
WITH OUR NEIGHBOURS OF THE ASIAN AND PACIFIC REGION, AND TO THE MAJOR<br />
INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES WITH WH4ICH WE SHARE SIGNIFICANT<br />
RELATIONSHIPS, ESPECIALLY THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN.<br />
11. THIRD, WE WILL PURSUE A FOREIGN POLICY A PP ROPRIATE TO A NATION<br />
WITH NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT ITS CAPACITY TO INFLUENCE GLOBAL EVENTS, AND<br />
NO FALSE NOTIONS OF OUR SELF-IMPORTANCE. ACCORDINGLY, WE RECOGNISE<br />
THAT OUR CAPACITY TO INFLUENCE THE COURSE OF EVENTS, IN WAYS<br />
CONSISTENT WITH OUR NATIONAL INTEREST, IS BEST INCREASED THROUGH<br />
PARTICIPATION IN MULTILATERAL INSTITUTIONS. WE SHALL BE FULLY<br />
SUPPORTIVE OF THE ROLE OF SUCH INTERNATIONAL BODIES, UNDER THE<br />
GENERAL AEGIS OF THE UNITED NATIONS.<br />
12. FOURTH, WE WILL ENDEAVOUR TO DEVELOP A FOREIGN POLICY WHICH<br />
ACCEPTS THE OPPORTUNITIES AS THEY ARISE TO PLAY AN APPROPRIATE PART<br />
IN PROMOTING CO-OPERATION AND RESOLVING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NATIONS<br />
AND NEIGHBOURS, ESPECIALLY IN OUR OWN REGION.<br />
13. IF I MAY SAY SO, IN THIS CONTEXT, MAGNUM IN PARVO, MY OWN<br />
BACKGROUND IN THE FIELD OF AUSTRALIAN AND INTERNATIONAL INDUSTRIAL<br />
RELATIONS FORMS THE BASIS OF MY STRONG CONVICTIONS OF THE PART THAT<br />
THE PROCESSES OF RECONCILIATION CAN PLAY IN THE RESOLUTION OF,<br />
CONFLICT. THIS IS AN APPROACH I KNOW IS SHARED BY MY FRIEND, THE<br />
UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE. BUT IN ANY SUCH INITIATIVES AS WE<br />
AUSTRALIANS SHALL BE PREPARED TO UNDERTAKE, WE WILL BE SEEING THE<br />
WORLD AND OUR REGION AS IT IS, RATHER THAN AS WE MAY WISH IT TO BE.<br />
14. AND FIFTH, OUR FOREIGN POLICY WILL OPERATE WITHIN THE OVERALL<br />
POLICY FRAMEWORK OF OUR NATION, CLOSELY RELATED TO THE CONDUCT OF OUR<br />
DOMESTIC POLICIES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO THE MANAGEMENT OF<br />
OUR ECONOMY. IF WE CAN'T DEMONSTRATE A CAPACITY TO MANAGE OUR OWN<br />
NATIONAL AFFAIRS EFFECTIVELY, THEN OUR INTERNATIONAL CREDIBILITY AND<br />
EFFECTIVENESS IS THEREBY DIMINISHED. SO THERE IS INDEED AN<br />
INTERNATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE TO THE PROMPT MEASURES MY GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
TAKEN TOWARDS ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND THE RESTORATION OF<br />
NON-INFLATIONARY ECONOMIC GROWTH, IN ORDER TO PLACE AUSTRALIA IN THE<br />
BEST POSSIBLE POSITION TO BENEFIT FROM THE ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN<br />
THE WORLD -ECONOMY AND TO SHARE IN THE DYNAMIC GROWTH OF THE WESTERN<br />
PACIFIC REGION TO WhlICll WE flEoJNG THE FASTEST-GROWING ECONOMIC<br />
REGIUN IN THE WORLD. </p>
<p>A3.<br />
AND FINALLY AND THIS POINT IS INTEGRAL TO ALL THAT I HAVE JUST<br />
SAID COMPLETELY CONSISTENT WITH OUR DETERMINATION TO PURSUE FOR<br />
AUSTRALIA A VIGOROUS, INDEPENDENT, REALISTIC AND RELEVANT<br />
INTERNATIONAL ROLE AUSTRALIA IS NOT AND CANNOT BE A NON-ALIGNED<br />
NATION. WE ARE NEUTRAL NEITHER IN THOUGHT, NOR ACTION.<br />
16. SPECIFICALLY, WE ARE LINKED WITH THE UNITED STATES THROUGH THE<br />
ANZUS TREATY.<br />
17. BUT BEYOND THAT, WE ARE LINKED WITH THE UNITED STATESINDISSOLUBLY<br />
LINKED BY A WHOLE RANGE OF COMMON INTERESTS,<br />
ATTITUDES, ASPIRATIONS, PERCEPTIONS, INSTITUTIONS, TRADITIONS, AND<br />
ASSOCIATIONS IN WAR AND PEACE.<br />
18. UNDER MY GOVERNMENT, THE UNITED STATES WILL CONTINUE TO FIND, IN<br />
AUSTRALIA, A CO-OPERATIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE PARTNER. WE REGARD OUR<br />
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES AS OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE.,<br />
AND WHATEVER DIFFERENCES OF PERCEPTION OR POLICY MAY ARISE FROM TIME<br />
TO TIME AS THEY MUST BETWEEN MATURE AND RESPONSIBLE PARTNERS THIS<br />
BASIC FACT REMAINS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR RELATIONSHIP.<br />
19. ALTHOUGH, AS I HAVE SAID, OUR ASSOCIATION IS CLOSE# LONG, DEEP,<br />
AND WIDE-RANGING, IT IS PERHAPS INEVITABLE, AND IN MANY RESPECTS<br />
APPROPRIATE, THAT IT IS THE SECURITY ASPECTS OF THE ALLIANCE WHICH<br />
SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF ATTENTION.<br />
THE ANZUS TREATY WHICH FORMALISES OUR ALLIANCE# IS NOW OVER<br />
THIRY YEARS OLD. IT WAS CONCEIVED IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN AUSTRALIA<br />
AND NEW ZEALAND SOUGHT GUARANTEES FROM THE UNITED STATES AGAINST THE<br />
POSSIBILITY OF ANY REVIVAL OF A MILITARY THREAT FROM JAPAN.<br />
21. THIS MAY SEEM ALMOST BIZARRE NOW. NEVERTHELESS, HOWEVER MUCH<br />
PERCEPTIONS AND REALITIES MAY HAVE CHANGED SINCE, AUSTRALIANS ARE IN<br />
NO DOUBT THAT THE ANZUS TREATY SUPPORTS AUSTRALIA'S SECURITY IN<br />
CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE STRATEGIC CIRCUMSTANCES AND REFLECTS A<br />
COINCIDENCE OF STRATEGIC INTEREST BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND THE UNITED<br />
STATES. THIS COINCIDENCE OF INTEREST PROVIDES THE * BASIS FOR<br />
CO-OPERATION WHICH YIELDS SUBSTANTIAL BENEFITS FOR AUSTRALIA'S<br />
DEFENCE EFFORTS AND WHICH, IN RETURN, AFFORDS SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT TO<br />
THE UNITED STATES. THE BENEFITS ARE MUTUAL AND RECIPROCAL. THE<br />
TREATY PROVISIONS DO NOT DEROGATE FROM AUSTRALIA'S RIGHT OF NATIONAL<br />
DECISION-MAKING IN FOREIGN AND DEFENCE POLICY. THE RISKS INVOLVED<br />
FOR AUSTRALIA IN RELATION TO THE HOSTING OF THE JOINT DEFENCE<br />
FACILITIES ON OUR SOIL HAVE TO BE BALANCED AGAINST AUSTRALIA'S<br />
INTEREST IN SUPPORTING THE UNITED STATE'S GLOBAL DETERRENT EFFORT<br />
AND HER PRIME CONTRIBUTION TO THE GLOBAL STRATEGIC BALANCE.<br />
22. IN MY TALKS WITH THE PRESIDENT, I HAVE REAFFIRMED MY VIEW OF THE<br />
IMPORTANCE OF THE ARRANGEMENTS REACHED IN 1974, WHICH BROUGHT ALL OF<br />
OF THE INSTALLATIONS IN AUSTRALIA UNDER THE JOINT ADMINISTRATION OF<br />
OUR TWO COUNTRIES, AND THE NEED FOR US TO BUILD ON IT IN ORDER TO<br />
ENSURE THAT THE CONSULTATIVE PROCESS MOVES AHEAD CO-OPERATIVELY AND<br />
EFFECTIVELY, AND TO PROTECT AND ENHANCE AUSTRALIAN SOVEREIGNTY.<br />
23. 1 HAVE ALSO PUT IT TO THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION, AND FOUND IT<br />
SYMPATHETIC TO THE IDEA, THAT THERE WOULD BE VALUE IN THE TREATY<br />
PARTNERS AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND AND THE UNITED STATES CARRYING<br />
OUT A JOINT REVIEW OF THE ANZUS TREATY. AS WILL BE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR<br />
FROM ALL I HAVE SAID, MY PURPOSE IN PROPOSING THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT<br />
TO CALL THE TREATY INTO QUESTION BUT TO STRENGTHEN IT AND MAKE SURE<br />
THAT IT IS AS RELEVANT AS POSSIBLE TO CONTEMPORARY CIRCUMSTANCES. </p>
<p>24.. I HAVE AGREED WITH SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION THAT<br />
THIS WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE ANZUS COUNCIL, DUE TO MEET IN<br />
WASHINGTON NEXT MONTH.<br />
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT TH4AT ANZUS WILL REMAIN THE FUNDAMENTAL<br />
DOCUMENT GOVERNING T14E CONDUCT OF AUSTRALIA'S STRATEGIC ROLE IN THE<br />
PACIFIC AND SOUTH EAST ASIAN REGIONS.<br />
26. IT IS ON THAT REGION THE REGION IN WHICH DESTINY HAS PLACED<br />
AUSTRALIA FOREVER THAT MY GOVERNMENT WILL FOCUS ITS PRIMARY<br />
ATTENTION IN THE YEARS AHEAD.<br />
27. IN THEIR EFFORTS TO FULFIL THEIR ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL<br />
ASPIRATIONS, THE NEWLY INDEPENDENT NATIONS OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC WILL<br />
CONTINUE TO FIND A CO-OPERATIVE, SENSITIVE AND SYMPATHETIC NEIGHBOUR<br />
IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
28. THESE NEW NATIONS SHARE WITH AUSTRALIA THE DESIRE TO SEE THE<br />
RESIDUAL COLONIAL SITUATIONS IN THE REGION ENDED IN AN ORDERLY AND<br />
PEACEFUL FASHION.<br />
29. AUSTRALIA IS UNIQUE IN THE WORLD IN HAVING AS ITS NEAREST<br />
NEIGHBOUR ITS OWN FORMER COLONY PAPUA NEW GUINEA. WE ACKNOWLEDGE<br />
OUR SPECIAL ASSOCIATIONS WITH THAT COUNTRY. DURING MY CURRENT VISIT<br />
OVERSEAS, I VISITED PORT MORESBY FIRST AND AGREED WITH PRIME MINISTER<br />
SOMARE ON NEW AID ARRANGEMENTS TO HELP PAPUA NEW GUINEA COPE WITH THE<br />
PRESENT GLOBAL RECESSION WITHOUT DESTABLISING ITS ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL<br />
STRUCTURES. TO OUR NORTH, THE ASEAN COUNTRIES ARE OF OUTSTANDING IMPORTANCE<br />
TO AUSTRALIA. WE REGARD ASEAN WITH ITS MEMBER NATIONS OF INDONESIA,<br />
THE PHILIPPINES, MALAYSIA, SINGAPORE AND THAILAND AS AMONG THE MOST<br />
VALUABLE AND VIABLE REGIONAL GROUPINGS IN THE WORLD TODAY. ASEAN<br />
FORMS, WITH THE GIANTS OF CHINA AND JAPAN, TOGETHER WITH SOUTH KOREA<br />
AND HONG KONG, THE WORLD'S FASTEST-GROWING ECONOMIC REGION.<br />
31. AND QUITE APART FROM CONSIDERATIONS OF STRATEGY AND PROXIMITY,<br />
AUSTRALIA'S OWN INTERESTS DEMAND THAT WE ASSOCIATE OURSELVES AS<br />
CLOSELY AS WE CAN WITH THE ECONOMIC PROGRESS OF THE REGION.<br />
32. THE ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JAPAN AND AUSTRALIA IS OF<br />
FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE TO BOTH OUR COUNTRIES. WE SEEK A BROADER<br />
RELATIONSHIP WITH JAPAN, BEYOND THE ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP, AS OUR<br />
MAJOR TRADING PARTNER.<br />
33. MY GOVERNMENT WILL BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH JAPAN AND WILL BE<br />
ENCOURAGING THAT COUNTRY TO PLAY A POLITICAL ROLE IN THE REGION MORE<br />
COMMENSURATE WITH HER ECONOMIC POWER. IT HAS OFTEN BEEN ASSERTED<br />
THAT THE JAPANESE ARE GETTING A ' FREE RIDE' IN TERMS OF DEFENCE.<br />
YET NONE OF US CAN IGNORE THE CONSTRAINTS ON JAPAN ARISING FROM<br />
DOMESTIC OPINION, HER POSTWAR DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION, AND REGIONAL<br />
SENSITIVITIES. NO COUNTRY IS MORE AWARE OF THOSE REGIONAL<br />
SENSITIVITIES THAN AUSTRALIA. WE WILL SEEK, AS SUCCESSIVE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENTS HAVE DONE, TO ENHANCE AUSTRALIA'S ROLE AND REPUTATION AS<br />
A RELIABLE AND STABLE SUPPLIER OF THE RESOURCE NEEDS OF JAPANESE<br />
INDUSTRY. I </p>
<p>34. AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONS WITH CHINA AND Ci: A'S OWN INFLUENCEg IN<br />
THE AFFAIRS OF OUR REGION HAVE ADVANCED POSITIVELY TO A DEGRE THAT<br />
WOULD HAVE DEFIED IMAGINATION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 19701S.<br />
RECENTLY, THE PREMIER OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC VISITED AUSTRALIA<br />
AND WE HAD ILLUMINATING AND FRANK TALKS WITH HIM.<br />
36. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING FROM THESE TALKS THAT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES<br />
ARE TAKING PLACE IN CHINA IN TERMS OF ITS ECONOMIC PRACTICE, AND,<br />
INDEED, ITS PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACH CHANGES WHICH SEEM TO ME TO BE<br />
OF GENUINE IMPORTANCE TO CHINA'S RELATIONS WITH THE WEST AND OURS<br />
WITH CHINA. I DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD UNDER-ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL<br />
WHICH THESE DEVELOPMENTS OFFER FOR AN EVEN MORE CONSTRUCTIVE<br />
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA.<br />
37. BECAUSE OF CHINA'S POTENTIAL INFLUENCE IN NORTH AND SOUTH EAST<br />
ASIA PARTICULARLY, BUT ALSO IN THE BROADER INTERNATIONAL SCENE, WE<br />
VIEW WITH CONCERN SIGNS OF STRAINS IN RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED<br />
STATES. A CO-OPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO GREAT POWERS<br />
WILL HELP EACH TO CONCENTRATE ITS ENERGIES ON THE MORE DIFFICULT AND,<br />
SOMETIMES, DELICATE AREAS OF ITS INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH<br />
OTHER COUNTRIES.<br />
38. OF THESE, NONE REPRESENTS A DEEPER CONTEMPORARY HUMAN TRAGEDY<br />
THAN THE PRESENT SITUATION IN CAMBODIA.<br />
39. THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS IN WHICH MY GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT AN<br />
AUSTRALIAN INITIATIVE CAN BE OF GENUINE VALUE AND CERTAINLY, WE<br />
BELIEVE WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO ALLEVIATE THE<br />
HUMAN SUFFERING ARISING FROM THAT SITUATION.<br />
THE OBLIGATION WE FEEL AND THE SPECIAL OPPORTUNITY WE BELIEVE WE<br />
HAVE IN THIS MATTER FLOW FROM THE SOUNDNESS OF OUR RELATIONS WITH<br />
CHINA, THE ASEAN MEMBER NATIONS, AS WELL AS, OF COURSE, WITH4 THE<br />
UNITED STATES, AND OUR CAPCITY TO TALK TO VIETNAM A CAPACITY NOT<br />
UNRELATED, I HAVE TO SAY TO THE CONSCIENTIOUS OPPOSITION MY OWN<br />
PARTY ADOPTED, AT CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL COST, THROUGHOUT THE YEARS<br />
OF THE WAR IN VIETNAM.<br />
41. THIS IS A COMBINATION OF FACTORS NOT AVAILABLE TO OTHER<br />
GOVERNMENTS AND NATIONS IN THE REGION.<br />
4i2. SO WE BELIEVE WE WOULD ABDICATE OUR OBLIGATIONS, SHOULD WE FAIL<br />
TO MOVE ON THIS QUESTION. EQUALLY, WE HAVE TO MOVE CIRCUMSPECTLY, IN<br />
ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE DO NOT FORFEIT THE UNIQUE POSITION WE HOLD.<br />
43. AS TO VIETNAM ITSELF, IT SEEMS TO AUSTRALIA THAT IT IS NEITHER<br />
IN VIETNAM'S INTEREST NOR IN OUR ( UNDERLINE ONE) INTERESTS OR IN<br />
ANYBODY'S INTEREST THAT VIETNAM SHOULD BE ISOLATED FROM THE AFFAIRS<br />
AND OPPORTUNITIES OF THE REGION. SUCH REGIONAL ISOLATION COULD ONLY<br />
MEAN EVEN MORE COMPLETE ORIENTATION OF VIETNAM TOWARDS THE SOVIET<br />
BLOC. 44. I AM HAPPY TO SAY THAT THERE HAS BEEN A POSITIVE REACTION TO OUR<br />
INITIATIVE FROM THE ASEAN COUNTRIES. THE AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN<br />
MINISTER, BILL HAYDEN, WILL BE MEETING THE ASEAN FOREIGN MINISTERS IN<br />
BANGKOK AT THE END OF THIS MONTH, AND WILL GO FROM THERE TO HANOI.<br />
SECRETARY SHULTZ HAS INDICATED TO ME IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS THAT<br />
THEY UNDERSTAND AND SUPPORT WHAT WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO DO, WITH THE<br />
BACKING OF THE ASEAN COUNTRIES. </p>
<p>A6.<br />
BEYOND REGIONAL PROBLEMS, HOWEVER INTRACTABLE, THERE REMAINS,<br />
LOOMING OVER US ALL, THE SPECTRE OF THE NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST.<br />
46. MY GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE FIELDS OF<br />
ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT. THIS REFLECTS THE DEEP INTEREST WHICH<br />
AUSTRALIA SHARES WITH ALL COUNTRIES IN BRINGING THE NUCLEAR ARMS RACE<br />
UNDER TH4E CONTROL OF EFFECTIVE AGREEMENTS.<br />
47. BUT WE IN AUSTRALIA, HAVING ACCEPTED THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND<br />
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HOSTING OF JOINT DEFENCE INSTALLATIONS,<br />
HAVE A PARTICULAR CONCERN ABOUT THE ISSUES AFFECTING THE STRATEGIC<br />
NUCLEAR BALANCE AND, LET ME SAY, AN ENTITLEMENT TO BE HEARD ON SUCH<br />
ISSUES. 48. AUSTRALIANS HAVE BEEN DEEPLY WORRIED BY THE EXTENT TO WHICH IN<br />
RECENT YEARS, ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT HAVE BECOME A SOURCE OF<br />
CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION RATHER<br />
THAN A BASIS FOR POSSIBLE CO-OPERATION AS, INDEED, HAPPENED IN THE<br />
YEARS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE CUBAN CRISIS OF 1962. WE UNDERSTAND,<br />
HOWEVER, THAT THE POLITICAL BASIS FOR PROGRESS IN THE ARMS CONTROL<br />
AND DISARMAMENT AREA HAS NOT BEEN GOOD IN RECENT YEARS, AND HAS BEEN<br />
UNDERMINED BY OTHER ASPECTS OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES<br />
AND THE SOVIET UNION, NOT LEAST THE ABHORRENT AGGRESSION OF THE<br />
SOVIET IN AFGHANISTAN, AND ITS INTOLERABLE PRESSURE TO SUPPRESS THE<br />
F'_ OWERING OF FREEDOM IN POLAND.<br />
49. WE AUSTRALIANS UNDERSTAND VERY WELL THE PROBLEMS WHICH FACE OPEN<br />
SOCIETIES LIKE OURS IN DEALING WITH THE SOVIET UNION.<br />
BUT, NEVERTHELESS, WE TAKE THE VIEW THAT IT IS BETTER TO<br />
CONTINUE TO ENGAGE THE SOVIET IN DIALOGUE RATHER THAN TO ATTEMPT TO<br />
ISOLATE IT AN IMPOSSIBLE ATTEMPT IN THIS DAY AND AGE.<br />
51. COUNTRIES LIKE OURS, WHICH ATTACH THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE TO THE<br />
AVOIDANCE OF NUCLEAR CONFLICT, CANNOT SENSIBLY TALK ABOUT<br />
INTERNATIONAL PEACE WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO HAVE RATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS<br />
WITH THE SOVIET UNION. OUR OWN DEALINGS WITH MOSCOW WILL BE FIRM,<br />
CIRCUMSPECT AND CONSTRUCTIVE.<br />
52. WE WANT TO SEE INTERNATIONAL CONFIDENCE IN THE ARMS CONTROL AND<br />
DISARMAMENT PROCESS STRENGTHENED. WE HOPE THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS<br />
UNDER WAY IN S. T. A. R. T. AND I. N. F. WILL LEAD TO A HALT IN THE ARMS<br />
RACE AND A REDUCTION IN NUCLEAR ARSENALS. IT IS TO BE H4OPED THAT THE<br />
SOVIET WILL RESPOND POSITIVELY TO RECENT AMERICAN INITIATIVES WHICH<br />
HAVE BEEN ADVANCED IN PURSUIT OF THESE OBJECTIVES. WE WISH TO SEE A<br />
REVITALISATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL NON-PROLIFERATION REGIME. WE<br />
LOOK TO THE CREATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE WHICH WOULD LEAD TO<br />
AGREEMENT ON A COMPREHENSIVE AND FULLY VERIFIABLE BAN ON NUCLEAR<br />
TESTING. 53. IN OUR OWN REGION, WE STRONGLY OPPOSE THE CONTINUATION OF FRENCH<br />
NUCLEAR TESTING. WE ARE CURRENTLY TALKING WITH OUR SOUTH PACIFIC<br />
NEIGHBOURS ABOUT PROPOSALS FOR A SOUTH WEST PACIFIC NUCLEAR FREE<br />
ZONE. OUR PUPROSE IS TO SEEK TO PREVENT NUCLEAR TESTING, THE STORAGE<br />
OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND THE DUMPING OF NUCLEAR WASTE IN THE REGION.<br />
BUT REFERRING BACK TO THE PRIMACY WE ATTACH TO THE ANZUS TREATY, I<br />
MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE CONCEPT OF A NUCLEAR FREE ZONE IS NOT INTENDED<br />
TO PRECLUDE THE PASSAGE OF NUCLEAR POWERED AND ARMED SEA VESSELS OR<br />
AIR TRANSIT IN THE REGION. </p>
<p>A 7.<br />
54. WHILE THE ARMS RACE AND THE THREAT OF NUCLEAR WAR REPRESENT THE<br />
ULTIMATE DANGER TO MANKIND, THESE THINGS ARE NOT THE ONLY SOURCE OF<br />
INTERNATIONAL TENSIONS, RIVALRIES AND CONFLICT.<br />
INDEED, THE VERY MAGNITUDE AND POTENTIAL FINALITY OF THE NUCLEAR<br />
THREAT IN OUR PERILOUS AGE TENDS TO OBSCURE THE ONGOING CAUSES OF<br />
TENSION BETWEEN NATIONS IN THEIR ECONOMIC RELATIONS.<br />
56. TU1E WORLD-WIDE RECESSION ITSELF HIAS CONTRIBUTED TO. TENSIONS<br />
BETWEEN THE MAJOR INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES AND CREATED NEW PROBLEMS<br />
FOR THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.<br />
57. WE OF THE INDUSTRIALISED WEST CAN MAKE OUR MAIN CONTRIBUTION TO<br />
THE RESOLUTION OF SUCH PROBLEMS AS INTERNATIONAL DEBT AND CONSTRAINTS<br />
ON TRADE BY RESTORING ECONOMIC GROWTH TO OUR ECONOMIES. I N<br />
PARTICULAR, IT IS NO WAY OUT OF THE RECESSION FOR ANY OF US T' 0-RESORT<br />
TO COSY BILATERAL DEALS, HIGHER LEVELS OF PROTECTION OR EXPOR
SUBSIDIES INCONSISTENT WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF GATT AND WHICH' DI; STORT<br />
THE PATTERN OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE. IN THE LONG-TERM, THAT WOULD<br />
SOLVE NONE OF OUR PROBLEMS, AND CERTAINLY INCREASE THE PROBLEMS OF<br />
THE DEVELOPING NATIONS. IT WILL REDUCE THEIR CAPACITY TO SERVICE<br />
THEIR DEBT AND TO FINANCE THEIR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.<br />
58. AS WITH ALL GREAT CRISES AND ORDEALS, THERE ARE IMPORTANT<br />
LESSONS TO BE LEARNED FROM THE WORLD RECESSION.<br />
59. AND AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSON OF ALL, THIS CRISIS SERVES<br />
POWERFULLY TO REMIND US OF THE INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE NATIONS<br />
THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF ECONOMIES, THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF SOCI-TI-ES.<br />
I HAVE JUST MENTIONED THE INTERACTION OF THE ECONOMIES OF THE MAJOR<br />
INDUSTRIALISED NATIONS. AND THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE ECONOMIES<br />
OF THE INDUSTRIALISED NATIONS AND THE DEVELOPING NATIONS.<br />
BUT IN THE WIDER SENSE, THIS INTERDEPENDENCE EXTENDS FAR BEYOND<br />
ECONOMIC INIERCHANGE.<br />
61. AND WHILE FORMAL TREATIES LIKE ANZUS RECOGNISE STRATEGIC<br />
INTERDEPENDENCE, THE PRINCIPLE EXTENDS BEYOND REGIONAL SECURITY,<br />
IMPORTANT AS THAT IS.<br />
62. WE LIVE IN A WORLD TODAY THAT IS TRULY, IN WENDELL WILKIE'S<br />
PHRASE: '' ONE WORLD''.<br />
63. IT WAS THE GREAT BENJAMIN FRANKLIN WHO SAID AT THE TIME OF THE<br />
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE:<br />
' WE MUST HANG TOGETHEFR GENTLFMEN OR ASSUREDLY WE WIL L<br />
HANG SEI'ARA rELY'<br />
64. TODAY'S NEED IS FOR A CLEARER RECOGNITION A DECLARATION OF<br />
INTERDEPENDENCE ( UNDERLINE THREE). HOWEVER JEALOUSLY EACH OF US MAY<br />
GUARD OUR NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE, WE MUST EQUALLY RECOGNISE OUR<br />
INTERNATIONAL INTERDEPENDENCE. </p>
<p>AND ULTIMATELY, WE HAVE TO RECOGNISE, HOWEVER DIFFICULT IT MAY<br />
BE, EVEN HOWEVER UNPALATABLE IT MAY BE WE HAVE TO RECOGNISE THAT<br />
INTERDEPENDENCE IS GLOBAL AND UNIVERSAL.<br />
66. AT STAKE, IN THE RECOGNITION AND ACCEPTANCE OF THAT FUNDAMENTAL<br />
FACT, IS NOTHING LESS THAN THE SURVIVAL OF CIVILISATION ITSELF.<br />
67. THIS WILL BE THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE FOR THE NEW GOVERNMENT OF<br />
AUSTRALIA: THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF THE NATIONS OF OUR REGION. OUR<br />
INTERDEPENDENCE WITH THE GREAT DEMOCRACIES., BUT ULTIMATELY, AND<br />
INESCAPABLY, THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF US ALL ALL NATIONS, ALL PEOPLES<br />
IN THE STARK CHOICE BEFORE US ALL A CHOICE NEVER BEFORE FACED BY<br />
HUMANITY THE CHOICE BETWEEN SURVIVAL OR EXTINCTION. </p>
