YH A. IA, ,7<br />
PRIME MONISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 8DECEMBER 1977<br />
LIVING STANDARDS<br />
The National Accounts for September which were released last week<br />
include statistics which provide a further illustration of how<br />
Australian living standards have risen since the Government was<br />
elected two years ago.<br />
The National Accounts show that real average earnings were<br />
two to three percent higher in the September quarter than they<br />
were in December 1975.<br />
The previous National Accounts for the June quarter showed that<br />
real household disposal income rose by 1.4 percent<br />
in 1976-77.<br />
Both trends.-are supported by the 5.2 percent increase in<br />
real consumption expenditure since the Government came to office.<br />
These statistics all mean that-the people of Australia are better<br />
off today after two years of proper economic management,<br />
fiscal restraint and anti-inflationary economic policies, than they<br />
were under Labor's policies of unrestrained expenditure<br />
and high taxation.<br />
This rise in living standards is under threat from the ALP<br />
which if elected to office would repeal the February tax cuts.<br />
These tax cuts are worth a total of $ 26.7 million a week in<br />
disposable income for all Australian taxpayers.<br />
-The economic recovery-which is now underway would be greatly<br />
damaged if this major aspect of the--1977-78 Budget strategy<br />
were to b~ e reversed..<br />
At the very' least an ALP Government would increase<br />
inflation, retard development and stop the economy growing.<br />
On the basis ofr the forecasting of the economic newsletter<br />
Syntec, which has just been sent to subscribers, the<br />
economic con-sectiences of a Labor Government would be even more<br />
immediately dzastic and even more serious. </p>
