FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY 27 OCTOBER 1982<br />
PUBLIC SECTOR WAGES IN TIE CAIN BUDGET<br />
I find it extraordinary that Mr Cain should expect praise for<br />
the Victor-ian Government in relation to wage restraint. ( The<br />
Herald, 26 October, 1982).<br />
The Victorian Budget provides for an enormous 17.6% increase<br />
in public sector wage and salary payments in 1932-83. ( See<br />
Budget Document No. 5 page 73).<br />
Even allowing for some carry-over fromrf 1982-82 settlements,<br />
one can only conclude that the Victorian Government is<br />
prepared to allow substantial wage and salary increases for<br />
its public servants. For Mr Jolly refers in his Budget sp~ cech<br />
to the fact that the Budget is based " on the maintenance of<br />
public sector employment" ( Budget Paper No. 1, p. 3) and to<br />
" approximately unchanged levels of crployment" ( Budget Paper<br />
No. 1, p. 8).<br />
Indeed, Mr Cain himself concedes the point when he refers to<br />
" wage agreements which had reflected nothing more than<br />
community movement" ( Herald, 26 October 1.981). In current<br />
circumstances, it is essential that governments give a lead in<br />
wage restraint to the community.<br />
The fact that Mr Cain complains about criticisms of his<br />
Government's wage policies shows his sensitivity on this<br />
issue. I had not even drawn attention to these public secLor<br />
wage rises in the Victorian Budget.<br />
I was making the point that the Commonwealth Budget<br />
established the conditions for wage restraint by making many<br />
average Australian families $ 18 or $ 19 a week better off, and<br />
that it was unfortunate that State Government Budgets<br />
undermined these conditions by taking back much of these<br />
benefits through increased State taxes and charges. I pointed<br />
out that on Eric Risstrom's figures, the cost of the Victorian<br />
Budget for Victorian families was $ 12 a week on average. This<br />
is damaging enough in itself, but when it is combined with the<br />
excessive public sector increases in the Victorian Budget, it<br />
must inevitably damage the cause of wage restraint enormously.<br />
