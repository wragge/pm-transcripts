Senator Ryan </p>
<p>a number of departments will be reorganised and<br />
renamed in view of signific~ nt changes of<br />
functions: industry, Technology and Commerce ( previously<br />
industry and Commerce);<br />
Science ( previously Science and Technology);<br />
Education ( previously Education and Youth<br />
Affairs);<br />
Arts, Heritage and Environment ( previously<br />
Home Affairs and Environment);<br />
Territories ( previously Territories and Local<br />
Government); Local Government and Administrative Services<br />
( bringing together functions from Territories<br />
and Local Government and Administrative<br />
Services).<br />
the Department of Defence Support will be<br />
abolished, and most of its functions allocated to<br />
Defence.<br />
The major departmental changes, which will be reflected<br />
in new Administrative Arrangements to be gazetted on<br />
Thursday, are as follows:<br />
1. Industry Policy<br />
There will be a substantial expansion of the department<br />
primarily responsible for industry policy, through the<br />
creation of a Department of Industry, Technology and<br />
Commerce, under Senator Button. He will be assisted by<br />
the Minister for Science, Mr Jones. The inclusion in<br />
this Department of responsibility for technology and<br />
civil offsets, and for the implementation of the<br />
Government's deregulation initiatives, will enable a<br />
better integration of our industry and technology<br />
policies, and should increase the competitiveness of<br />
Australian industry stimulating growth and greater<br />
employment opportunities. The Department will work<br />
closely with the Departments of Trade and of Employment<br />
and industrial Relations to promote the Government's<br />
competitiveness, growth and employment objectives.<br />
Mr Jones will have special responsibility for assisting<br />
Senator Button in regard to Information Technology and<br />
Biotechnology. It is the Government's intention to have a separate<br />
Comptroller of Customs, and a review of the functions of<br />
Customs is being conducted, with a further announcement<br />
to be made early next year. </p>
<p>Minister for Veterans' Senator the Ron A. T. Gietzelt Mr Holding<br />
Af fairs<br />
Minister for Local The Hon Tom Uren, MP Senator Gietzeli<br />
Government and<br />
Admninistrative Services<br />
Minister in the Cabinet<br />
~' Mr Dawkins to represent the Minister for Industry, Technology and<br />
Commerce in Industry and Commerce matters, and Mr Jones in<br />
Technology matters.<br />
Mr Hurford to represent the Minister for Finance, and Mr Willis to<br />
represent the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service<br />
Matters. THE GOVERNMENT' S PRIORITIES AND DEPARTMENTAL CHANGES<br />
The Government's major priority and achievement during<br />
its first term in office was to bring Australia out of<br />
the recession which it had inherited.<br />
The Government's priorities during its second term are<br />
to sustain the recovery, and to ensure that the benefits<br />
of that recovery are shared in a fair and equitable way<br />
among all Australians. This has necessitated some<br />
changes in departmental arrangements, but these have<br />
been kept to a minimum.<br />
The changes that I will be making reflect the following<br />
shifts in emphasis:<br />
a reordering of industry and technology policy<br />
functions to reflect the Government's priorities<br />
for industry development, to ensure the achievement<br />
of continued high growth and employment;<br />
a more rational organisation of the welfare policy<br />
area, to ensure that the Government's programs are<br />
delivered in the most effective way;<br />
a concentrated effort to improve and more<br />
effectively integrate the Government's overall<br />
policies for youth;<br />
a better integration of defence administration.<br />
To give effect to these changes in Government<br />
priorities, the following departmental changes will be<br />
made: a new Department of Community Services is to be<br />
created; </p>
<p>offsets will be transferred to the'Department of<br />
Industry, Technology and Commerce ( the precise split<br />
will be guided by the report of the current inquiry into<br />
off setsB). All other responsibilities of Defence Support<br />
will move to Defence. The new Minister for Defence,<br />
Mr Reazley, and his Ministers Assisting, Mr Duffy and<br />
Mr Brown, will be responsible for A smooth transition<br />
to the new arrangements.<br />
Other Important Administrative Changes<br />
In addition to being appointed Mini-ster for Resources<br />
and Energy, Senator Evans will be Minister Assisting the<br />
Minister for Foreign Affairs, having represented both<br />
Mr Hayden and the Minister for Defence in the Senate<br />
during the Government's first term. Senator Evans has<br />
also been appointed to the new posi-tion of Minister<br />
Assisting the Prime Minister, to assist me and the<br />
relevant Minister or Ministers with particular areas of<br />
policy difficulty, or when portfolib-. responsibility for<br />
particular issues overlap or are not clear.<br />
The responsibility, for the Bicentennial Authority, which<br />
will demand greater attention by the Government between<br />
now and* 1988, will be transferred to my portfolio. The<br />
current Minister, Mr Cohen, will assist me in<br />
Bicentennial matters. His Departrndnt will be renamed<br />
Arts, Heritage and Environment. Responsibility for the<br />
Australian War Memorial will be transferred to the<br />
Minister for Veterans' Affairs.-<br />
In the interest of greater administrative efficiency,<br />
responsibility for local goverrnment~ nregional<br />
development and Commonwealth common services, including<br />
property services, has been brought together in the<br />
Department of Local Government and Administrative<br />
Services, with Mr Uren as Minister._<br />
Responsibility for animal and * plant quarantine will be<br />
transferred to the Department of PrImary Industry,<br />
subject to necessary technical changes to the Quarantine<br />
Act. The Department of Sport, Recreation and Tourism is to be<br />
given responsibility for the Government's information<br />
and advertising programs, as well as tourism promotion<br />
and international expositions. It Will also gain<br />
responsibility for the National Sports Centre. The<br />
Department will have overall responsibility for<br />
projecting the Australian achievement overseas.<br />
IMPLEMENTATION I have asked Senator Walsh, as Minister for Finance and<br />
Minister Assisting me for Public Service Matters, to<br />
take responsibility for the implementation of the above<br />
changes, to ensure that consequential questions of<br />
finance, staffing and physical location of offices are </p>
<p>2. Welfare Policy<br />
A new Department of Community Services will be created<br />
under Senator Grim~ es to coordinate all Government social<br />
security, community services aind health and welfare<br />
policies, and to administer programs which provide or<br />
subsidise services to the aged, the disabled, children<br />
and others in special need. The Department will include<br />
the Offices of Aged Care ( as promised during the<br />
election campaign), Child Care and the Disabled,<br />
together with a Policy Coordination Office formerly<br />
the Social welfare Policy Secretariat.<br />
The establishment of this Department will enable the<br />
Government to concentrate overall policy development in<br />
the welfare area in the one department, and to focus<br />
more effectively on the important service programs, many<br />
of which the Government is currently reviewing in<br />
conjunction with the States.<br />
The Minister for Social Security will retain<br />
responsibility for payment of pensions and benefits.<br />
Responsibility for nursing homes, home nursing and<br />
assistance for the disabled in the Department of Health<br />
will be transferred to the new Department of Community<br />
Services. Community health centres will remain the<br />
responsibility of the Minister for Health. The Minister<br />
for Health's primary responsibilities will be for<br />
Medicare, health research, medical services and<br />
community health matters. The Minister will have<br />
responsibility for the coordination of the national<br />
campaign against drug abuse, which will have a high<br />
priority for the Government during its second term.<br />
3. Youth Policy<br />
The Office of Youth Affairs will be transferred to the<br />
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and it<br />
will function in the same way as the Office * of the<br />
Status of Women. it will have an input into the<br />
development of all relevant Government programs, and it<br />
will be the focal point within the Government for the<br />
concerns and interests of our nation's youth, including<br />
next year's International Youth Year programs. School<br />
to work transition programs will remain in Education.<br />
Mr Dawkins will be Minister Assisting for Youth Affairs.<br />
4. Defence<br />
The experience of the Government's first term suggests<br />
that the needs of Defence policy making, and of the<br />
Defence industries, will be better served if all related<br />
responsibilities are brought together within the one<br />
portfolio. it has, therefore, been decided to transfer<br />
most of the functions of Defence Support into Defence,<br />
under the supervision of a very senior officer working<br />
to the Minister and Secretary of Defence. The close<br />
working relationship developed by the Minister for<br />
Defence Support with the defence industry will be<br />
continued under the new arrangements. Responsibility<br />
for offsets policy, and administration of non-Defence </p>
<p>SECRETARIES OF DEPARTMENTS<br />
until a permanent appointment can be made, Mr Ayers<br />
( Secretary to the Department of Social Security) will<br />
act as Secretary to the Department of Community<br />
Services. </p>
