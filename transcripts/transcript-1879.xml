ADDRESSED CANBERRA 1385, REPEATED SINGAPORE 130.<br />
( ATTENTION MISS NEWPORT, ASSISTANT PRESS SECRETARY TO P. M.)<br />
* FOLLOWING IS TRANSCRIPT OF PRIM E MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
IN SINGAPORE ON 11 JUNE.<br />
FOR MASTER FILE AND INSTANT SERVICE LIST ONLY.<br />
BEGINS: I DON'T THINK YOU EXPECT ME TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT, BECAUSE<br />
THE VISIT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT IN A CIOMPLETELY OPEN WAY, KNOW,-ING<br />
WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND WHERE I HAVE BEEN. AND THE GENERAL<br />
TOPICS OF CONVERSATION ARE ALSO PROBABLY KNOWN TO YOU. r<br />
PERHAPS I COULD SAY THIS THOUGH, AS I HAVE JUST SAID TO YOUR<br />
PRIME MINISTER. THAT MY WIFE AND I AIRE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR THE<br />
I1NVITATION WHICH WAS GIVEN US TO VISIT THIS CITY STATE., THAT<br />
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS VISIT WILL BE THE BEGINNING OF A NUMBER<br />
OF RECIPROCAL VISITS FROM, I HOPE, MYSELF AS PRIME MINISTER OF<br />
AUSTRALIA AND MR LEE AS PRIME MINISTER OF SINGAPORE., AND THATL<br />
IN4 THE MEANTIME THE BA. SIS HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR COMMUNICATION<br />
ON A PERSONAL LEVEL WHICH I THINK CAN DO NOTHING BUT GOOD TO<br />
BOTH OUR NATIONS.<br />
I HAVE ENJOYED THE VISIT., I HAVE FOUND IT VALUABLE, AND I<br />
HOPE, AND BELIEVE, THAT THE RESULTS WHICH THE FUTURE MIGHT BRING<br />
WILL SHOW THAT, IN FACT, IT WAS VALUABLE.<br />
. BUT HAVING SAID THAT, PERHAPS YOU MIGHT WISH TO ASK ME SOME<br />
QUESTIONS, I LEAVE IT OVER TO YOU NOW. </p>
<p>C0.-<br />
Q. PRIME MINISTER, DURING YOUR VISIT HERE AND PARTICULARLY HERE<br />
YOU HAVE EMPHASIZED THE NEED FOR REGIONAL CO-OPERATION,? AND YOU HAVE<br />
ALSO MENIIONED ON OCCASIONS PACTS BETWEEN VARIOUS COUNTRIES OF<br />
THE-REGION.<br />
SOME KIND OF ARRANGEMENT, PACTS BETWEEN VARIOUS COUNTRIES,<br />
ANYWAY A. WAIT A MOMENT.<br />
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ME USE THE WORD '' PACTS'' OR AGREEMENTS<br />
O Q. COULD I SAY SOME KIND OF ARRANGEMENT THEN<br />
COULD YOU EXPLAIN TO ME IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL WHAT<br />
O KIND OF THIN'G YOU HAVE IN MIND FOR THIS REGION.<br />
I THINK VIE BELIEVE THAT IT IS MORE ON THE LINIES OF ECONOMIC<br />
CO-OPERATION.<br />
A. MORE ALONG THE LINES OF ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION IS WHAT YOU SAID.<br />
WHAT ONE WOULD HOPE TO SEE ACHIEVED IS AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE<br />
ECONOMIC LIVING STANDARDS OF ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE REGION.,, AND<br />
THE VARIOUS NATIONS IN THE REGION INCLUDING OURSELVES, HELPING<br />
EACH OTH~ tR FOR THIS GEN'ERAL ADVANCEMENT.<br />
THIS IS NOT A BI-LATERAL THING, IT IS A MULTI-LATERAL THING<br />
OF THE NATIONS IN THE AREA: IT DEPENDS NOT ON AID ALONE FROM ONE<br />
COUNTRY TO ANOTHER BUT ON MULTI-LATERAL AID AND, INDEED, ON FREEING<br />
THE CHANNELS OF TRADE AS FAR AS THE INTERESTS OF A PARTICULAR<br />
COUNTRY MAKE THAT POSSIBLE.<br />
THIS, TOGETHER WITH A BANISHMENT OF FEAR, A BANISHMENT OF ANY<br />
DANGER OF AGGRESSION FROM INSIDE THE AREA IS THE SORT OF THING<br />
ONE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ACHIEVED.<br />
THE DIRECT METHODS BY WHICH THAT HAPPENS ARE OF COURSE ABLE<br />
TO BE THE SUBJECT OF DEBATE, BUT THE END RESULT IS THE ONE WHICH<br />
I HAVE ATTEMPTED 1* O PUT TO YOU IN THOSE FEW WORDS. </p>
<p>Q. MR PRIME MINISTERS PURELY ON THE BASIS OF THE REPORTS RECEIVED<br />
FROM KUALA LUMPUR, DID THE RATHER RIGID ATTITUDE OF THE BRITISH<br />
TOWARD THE DEFENCE. SITUATION SURPRISE YOU<br />
A. WELL, I'D LIKE TO SEE THE TRANSCRIPTS OF WHATEVER WAS SAID<br />
BY THE BRITISH SPOKESMEN THERE BEFORE I MAKE ANY REAL COMMENTS<br />
ABOUT THAT.<br />
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT. OF VARIATIONS OVER THE YEARS ON<br />
BRITISH PROGRAMMES AND BRITISH INVOLVEMENT IN THIS REGION, SO<br />
I'D LIKEI TO SEE THE TRANSCRIPT TO SEE WHETHER THERE IS OR IS NOT<br />
ANY FURTHER VARIATION.<br />
AND I DON'T THINK I'D COMM~ ENJT ON IT UNTIL I'D SEEN THE<br />
TRANSCR IPT.<br />
Q. SI'R) YOU HAD DISCUSSIONS ON TRADE WERE THERE ANY SPECIFIC<br />
I,<br />
COMMODITIES MENTIONED<br />
A. NO, THERE WEREN'T.<br />
I WAS TALKING OF A GENERAL AREA,<br />
BUT ,' IT MAY BE OF INTEREST TO YOU TO KNOW THAT WE DID IN THE<br />
COURSE OF OUR DISCUSSIONS CONSIDER THE DESIRABILITY OF A TAXATION<br />
AGREEMENT BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND SINGAPORE.<br />
AND WE HAVE AGREED AND ARRANGED THAT DISCUSSION4S AT THE<br />
SOFFICIAL LEVEL ON THE NEGOTIATION OF RECIPROCAL TAXATION SHOULD<br />
IMMEDIATELY TAKE PLACE.<br />
Q. ALONG THE LINES OF THE JAPAN/ AUSTRALIA<br />
A. OF THE JAPANESE/ AUSTRALIA ( AGREEMENT). </p>
<p>Q. MR GORTON, DURING YOUR TALKS WITH MR LEE AND OTHER LEADERS HERE,<br />
ARE YOU ABLE TO INDICATE JUST WHAT AUSTRALIA'S MILITARY ROLE IN<br />
THIS AREA MIGHT BE AFTER 1971 OR IS IT TOO EARLY TO DO THAT<br />
A. I THINK WE'LL WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FIVE-POWER<br />
TALKS AND ANY SUBSEQUENT TALKS WHICH MAY FLOW FROM THE FIVE-POWER<br />
TALKS. IN OTHER WORDS AS MR LEE HIMSELF SAID LAST NIGHT, IT IS<br />
NOT UNREASONABLE AT THIS STAGE TO KEEP ALL ONE'S OPTIONS OPEN.<br />
Q. SIR, YOU HAVE BEEN IN VIETNAM, WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ON THE<br />
VIETNAM $ ITUATION<br />
A THIS IS A TERRIBLY BROAD QUESTION, WHAT'S MY VIEW ON THE<br />
VIETNAM SITUATION<br />
1 DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU MEAN MILITARILY OR PRECISELY<br />
WHAT IT IS WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO ANSWER.<br />
Q. I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU WHETHER A MILITARY VICTORY IS POSSIBLE<br />
A. I MYSELF BELIEVE, ALTHOUGH I DON'T POSE TO BE A MILITARY<br />
STRATEGI$ T OR A TECHNICIAN I AM A POLITICIAN WHO RECEIVES<br />
MILITARY ADVICE AND ATTEMPTS TO EVALUATE IT I THINK THAT<br />
THE OUTCOME, FROM A MILITARY POINT OF VIEW, WILL DEPEND ON WILL,<br />
YOU KNOW WILL AND RESOLVE BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT THE<br />
OUTCOME WOULD BE THAT THERE WAS GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH<br />
VIETNAM AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT AND THAT IN<br />
THE CHOOSING OF IT TO BE FREE FROM TERROR OR SUBVERSION, OR<br />
PRESSURE FROM ANY QUARTER.<br />
AND IF THIS IS ACQUIRED FOR THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE PEOPLE, THENTHEY<br />
WILL BE THE ONES WHO WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE THE CHOICE OF<br />
WHICH PARTICULAR GOVERNMENT THEY WANT.<br />
AND IF THEY CAN DO IT WITHOUT FEAR OR FAVOUR OR PRESSURE<br />
THEN I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL HAVE GAINED WHAT WE HAVE SET OUT<br />
TO GAIN, AND WHAT YOU IN SINGAPORE HAVE AND WHAT WE IN AUSTRAL IA<br />
HAVE AN D WHAT I THIN4K IS NECESSARY FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE. </p>
<p>Q. WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE POLITICAL CONTRIBUTION IS MORE IMPORTANT<br />
THAN THE MILITARY, SIR<br />
A. THE ONLY PURPOSE OF MILITARY ACTION IS TO ACHIEVE A POLITICAL<br />
SETTLEMENT IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, NOT JUST THE VIETNAM SITUATION.<br />
IN ANY TIME WHEN A CONFLICT TAKES PLACE, THAT CONFLICT TAKES<br />
PLACE BECAUSE A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT HAS NO0T BEEN POSSIBLE, AND<br />
ONE SIDE OR-* THE OTHER DECIDES THEY WILL RESORT TO FORCE INSTEAD<br />
OF CONTINJUING TO TRY AND REACH AN AGREED POLITICAL SETTLE MENT.<br />
NOW WHAT ONE HOPES WOULD TAKE PLACE WOULD BE A POLITICAL<br />
SETTLE ME NT.<br />
IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF THAT POLITICAL SETTLEMENT TOOK<br />
PLACE, AS LONG AS IT TOOK PLACE ALONG THE LINES THAT I HAVE<br />
SUGGESTED, WITHOUT FURTHER MILITARY ACTION.<br />
BUT IF IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THAT KIND OF POLITICAL<br />
SETTLEME NT, THEN I EXPECT THAT MILITARY ACTION WILL'CONTINUE.<br />
Q. MR PRIME MINISTER, AUSTRALIA IS GETTING MORE AND MORE INTERESTED<br />
IANSIA. DO YOU THINK YOUR IMMIGRATION POLICY WILL HAVE TO BE REVISED<br />
TO G I\ JE AS IANS AN EQUAL CHANCE TO COME TO AUSTRAL IA WITH EUROPEANS<br />
A. YOU KNOW, YOU USED A WORD WHICH INTERESTS ME AND RATHER<br />
. BEMUSES ME.<br />
YOU SAID AUSTR~ ALIA IS GETTING MORE AND MORE INTERESTED IN ASIA.<br />
JUST WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ASIA<br />
ASIA IS A CONTINENT AND IN THE AREA THERE ARE A LOT OF<br />
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, A LOT OF DIFFERENT CULTURES, A LOT OF<br />
DIFFERENT APPROACHES, IT IS NOT AN ENTITY IS IT<br />
IT'S NO0 MORE AN ENTITY THAN EUROPE WAS AN ENTITY BEFORE THE<br />
FIRST WORLD WAR.<br />
GERMANS WERE SO DIFFERENT FROM THE FRENCH, AND THE FRENCH<br />
WERE SO DIFFERENT FROM THE ITALIANS, A ND THE RUSSIANS WERE<br />
SO DIFFERENT FROM EVERYBODY ELSE, AND SO ON<br />
WE ARE INTERESTED IN PEOPLE, AND WE HAPPEN TO BE INTERESTED<br />
IN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CLOSEST TO US.<br />
O. K.<br />
THE NUMBER OF THE NATIONS WHO ARE CLOSEST TO US ARE NATIONS<br />
WHO ARE IN4 THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA KNOWN AS ASIA, BUT IT'S. RATHER<br />
A BLANKET THING WHICH I WANTED TO TIE DOWN A BIT MORE, TO DEFINE<br />
A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN YOU HAD DEFINED IT. </p>
<p>WE HAVE All IMMIGRATION POLICY WHICH IS SUBJECT TO CONSTANT<br />
REVILEW, AND INDEED HAS RECENTLY BEEN REV IEWED.<br />
IF-AN ASIAN WISHED TO BE NATURALIZED AS AN AUSTRALIAN) THEY<br />
HAD TO LIVE IN AUSTRALIA FOR 15 Y. EARS, WHEREAS EUROPEANS HAD TO<br />
LIVE THERE FOR<br />
THAT HAS BEEN CHANGED NOW: ASIAN ONLY HAS TO LIVE THERE<br />
FOR 5 YEARS THE SAME AS THE EUROPEAN.<br />
THIS IS ONE ALTERATION WHICH HAS BEEN MADE.<br />
THERE' IS ALSO, OF COURSE, NO BAR SUBJECT TO IT BEING A<br />
GENUINE MARRIAGE, AGAINST ANY ASIAN MARRYING AN AUSTRALIAN AND<br />
AUTOMATICALLY BECOMING AN AUSTRALIAN CITIZEN I DON'T MEAN<br />
BY THAT THAT YOU CAN HAVE AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE JUST FOR THAT<br />
PURPOSE, BUT A GENUINE MARRIAGE LEADS TO THAT RESULT.<br />
QUITE SOME THOUSANDS I DON'T K( NOW HOW MANY FROM THE<br />
IMMIGRATION FIGURES FOR THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES OF ASIA DO BECOME<br />
NATURALIZED IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
I EXF! IECT THAT OVER THE DECADES AHEAD THIS KIND ' OF<br />
LIBERALIZATION IS LIKELY TO BE KEPT UNDER REVIEW.<br />
WE, I TH INK NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE DON'T RUN A R ISK OF<br />
CREATING IN AUSTRALIA A PROBLEM WHICH WE HAVE SEEN CREATED IN<br />
OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD WHERE A VERY LARGE MINORITY<br />
ATTRACIVS, THE DISLIKE OF THE MAJORITY ( DISLIKE ISN'T THE PROPER<br />
WORD.# II THINK YOU KNOW THE WORD I MEAN ANIMOSITY SOMETHING<br />
OF THAT KIND., WE CAN AVOID THAT AND THIS WILL THEREFORE<br />
BE A GRADUAL GROWTH.<br />
BUT IT HAS BEEN, I HAVE LOOKED BACK ON THE RECORD, IT HAS BEEN<br />
A GROWTH THAT HAS BEEN LIBERALISED., THE THING HAS BEEN MADE<br />
EASIER. BUT AGAIN, FROM OUR OWN NATIONAL INTERESTS, WE WOULD NEED<br />
TO TRY AND SEE THAT WHAT HAPPENS IN OTHER PLACES, INCLUDING<br />
WTHE VARIOUS COUNTRIES OF ASIA, WAS AVOIDED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE IN<br />
OUR OWN COUN'TRY.<br />
I DON'T THINK THAT I OUGHT TO GO TOO DEEPLY INTO IT.<br />
YOU WOULD KNOW OF COUNTRIES IN ASIA WHERE THERE ARE<br />
DIFFICULTIES, BECAUSE OF MINORITIES OF A DIFFERENT RACIAL<br />
CHARACTERISTIC THAN THE OTHERS.<br />
WHAT ONE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN AN IDEAL WORLD IS A SITUATION<br />
WHERE THIS DIDN'T EXIST.<br />
WHAT WE HAVE IN AUSTRALIA IS A SITUATION WHERE THERE IS NO<br />
SUCH FEELING AT THE MOMENT AT ALL AGAINST ANYBODY.<br />
WE'D LIKE TO KEEP IT THAT WAY, BUT I THINK THERE WILL NEED<br />
TO BE A GRADUAL GROWTH TO MAKE SURE WE AVOID THE PITFALLS, NOT<br />
ONLY OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, BUT OF ASIAN COUNTRIES THEMSELVES. </p>
<p>Q. SIR YOU HAVE SAID'YOU HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING VIEW ON<br />
VIETNAM. COULD YOU SAY WHETHER YOUR VIEWS ON VIETNAM WERE IDENTICAL<br />
WITH SINGAPORE VIEWS<br />
A. I THINK THEY WERE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER INDEED, BUT I. PREFER<br />
THAT ANY COMMENTS ON THE VIEWS OF THE PRIME MINISTER OF SINGAPORE<br />
SHOULD COME FROM THE PRIME MINISTER OF SINGAPORE.<br />
Q. SIR, DID YOUR DEFENCE DISCUSSIONS WITH MR LEE INCLUDE THE<br />
POSSIBILITY OF AN AUSTRALIAN MILITARY PRESENCE HERE AFTER THE<br />
BRITISH MILITARY WITHDRAWAL<br />
A. INCLUDED IN COVERING THESE FI. ELDS, THIS WOULD BE ONE OF THE<br />
SUBJECTS WHICH WAS DISCUSSED.<br />
YES.<br />
Q. DISCUSSED IN A PRACTIC. AL MANNER, OR JUST GENERAL TERMS<br />
A. WOULDjYOU MIND ELABORATING ON THAT SO I KNOW PRECISELY<br />
WHAT YOU MEAN<br />
Q. I WAS TRYING TO SUGGEST SIR, THAT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A BIG<br />
TOPIC WHICH WOULD COME UP.<br />
DID ANY GUARANTEE COME FROM AUSTRALIA<br />
A. OH, 1 I SEE.<br />
IT WAS DISCUSSED NO, NO GUARANTEES CAME FROM AUSTRALIA,<br />
BUT CLEARLY VARIOUS CONTINGENCIES WERE DISCUSSED AN4D VARIOUS<br />
PROPOSALS TO MEET THE CONTINGENCIES WERE, YOU KNOW THE SUBJECT<br />
OF THE CONVERSATIONS, BUT NO '' YOU DO THIS... YES ALL RIGHT..<br />
WE'LL DO THAT''.<br />
NOT THAT KIND OF DISCUSSION, BUT MORE FOR SEEKING TO PIERCE<br />
THE VEIL OF THE FUTURE A LITTLE IF THAT'S THE PROPER WORD<br />
AND TRY AND SAY THAT IF THIS HAPPENS THEN THIS MIGHT BE<br />
POSSIBLE, OR IF THAT HAPPENS, THE OTHER MIGHT BE POSSIBLE.<br />
LET'S WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS, AND THEN WE'LL<br />
HAVE ANOTHER TALK. </p>

A iD_ WAS_ MR-LE-E-A&amp; RE-E* BL E<br />
Q. PRIM1E MINISTER, JUST ONE QUESTION.<br />
9. IN YOUR TALKS WITH MR LEE, DID YOU OUTLINE THE MAJOR FACTORS<br />
WHICH AUSTRALIA CONSIDERED POSED A THREAT TO REGIONAL SECURITY<br />
AND WAS MR LEE AGREEABLE WITH YOUR ASSESSMENT OR WERE THERE<br />
O POINTS OF DIFFERENCE OF EMPHASIS<br />
A. I THINK THAT WE WERE IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT.<br />
I THINK AS FAR AS OUR OWN COUNTRY OF AUSTRALIA IS CONCERNED<br />
ONE OF THE COUNTRIES OF THE REGION WHICH YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT,<br />
THE ONLY THREAT WHICH I THINK EITHER OF US COULD SEE<br />
COMING TO AUSTRALIA WAS A FAR-OFF THREAT, AND A THREAT WHICH<br />
WOULD ONLY BECOME A REALITY IF SOME POTENTIAL THREAT HAD REACHED<br />
REALITY IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE REGION.<br />
BUT BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE SOME FAR-OFF THREAT WHICH COULD<br />
S REACH REALITY IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE<br />
REGION THEREFORE IT WAS OF INTEREST TO US TO DISCUSS HOW ONE<br />
COULD TRY AND AVOID THAT KIND OF THREAT TO THE OTHER COUNTRIES<br />
IN THE REGION HERE.<br />
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS OF DOING THAT ALL OF THEM NOT BY<br />
ANY MEANS MILITARY BUT SOME OF THEM.<br />
I THINK WE BOTH HAD THE SAME KIND OF APPROACH AS TO THE<br />
POSSIBILITY. THESE CAN ONLY BE POSSIBILITIES OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN AND AS<br />
TO WHAT MIGHT BE DONE IN VARIOUS CONTINGENCIES. </p>
<p>Q. I WAS THINKING, SIR, WHAT PROMPTED THE QUESTION II. T SEEMS<br />
TO ME THAT AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN POLICY IS CONCERNED WITH COMMUNIST<br />
IMPERIALISM WITH CHINESE IMPERIALISM -, KHAUCK'S TERMS,<br />
WHEREAS SINGAPORE SEEMS TO BE CONCERNED A BE A<br />
REPRODUCTION, A FURTHER OUTBREAK OF INDONESIAN IRRIDENTIST POLICIES<br />
WHICH THEY SEEM. SO CONCERNED ABOUT.<br />
WERE THESE FACTORS TALKED ABOUT<br />
A. OH WELL, THESE WERE PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS.<br />
Q. MR PF! IME MINISTER, WHEN YOU GO UP TO KUALA LUMP'UR THIS<br />
V AFTERNOON, WILL YOU BE HAVING A BRIEFING FROM MR FAIRHALL<br />
AND MR HASLUCK BEFORE YOU MEET THE TUNKU TOM* ORROW<br />
A. WE'RE GETTING THERE ABOUT 5.15 P. M. AND PEOPLE ACCOMPANYING<br />
ME HAVE BEEN DOING A BIT OF RINGING UP TO SEE WHETHER<br />
MR HAS ILUCK AND MR FAIRHALL HAVE TIME TO COME ALONG TO HAVE A TALK<br />
IN BETWEEN THE CONCLUSION OF WHATEVER THEY'RE DOING, AND GOING TO<br />
THE STATE BANQUET.<br />
IT WILL NOT REALLY BE A BRIEFING, BUT IT WOULD BE A CHANCE<br />
FOR THE THREE OF US TO GET TOGETHER AGAIN.<br />
IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE A BRIEFING, BECAUSE THERE WILL BE NO<br />
HARD AND FAST DECISIONS TAKEN BY AUSTRALIA AT THESE FIVE-P OWER<br />
TALKS AND, THEREFORE, TODAY WHETHER IT'S IN 10 DAYS' TIME,<br />
WON'T BE THOROUGHLY SIGNIFICANT.<br />
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'VE HEARD THE RESULTS OF THE<br />
CONVERSATION MR HEWITT HEAD OF MY DEPARTMENT DO<br />
YOU KNOW ANYTHING<br />
( MR HEWITT). THEY'LL BE CALLING IN TON IGHT.<br />
A. O. K. THAT'S THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION.<br />
Q. YOU ARE GOING TO INDONESIA FROM KUALA LUMPUR<br />
A. I'll GOING TO INDONESIA YES. </p>
<p>Q. HAVE YOU ANY PARTICULAR TOPICS TO BE DISCUSSED IN INDONESIA<br />
WITH PRESIDENT SUHARTO<br />
A. NO. 1<br />
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY MIGHT BRING UP, BUT THE MAJOR PURPOSE<br />
OF THIS VISIT IS FIRST TO ALLOW MYSELF TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE<br />
RULERS OF THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN THE REGION IN A PERSONAL WAY,<br />
AND ALSO TO SHOW THAT' WE IN AUSTRALIA REALISE WE ARE CONTIGUOUS<br />
TO A PART OF THE REGION AND AFFECTED BY WHAT HAPPENS IN THE<br />
REGION, AND TO SHOW THAT THE DEATH OF THE LATE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR HOLT, DID NOT PUT A STOP TO THIS, THAT THIS IS A CONTINUING<br />
INTEREST ON OUR PART.<br />
NOW I HAVE NO DOUBT THERE WOULD BE A NUMBER OF MATTERS OF<br />
ECONOMI C INTEREST WHICH GENERAL SUHARTO MIGHT WISH TO RAISE,<br />
BUT I AM 14OT GOING THERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF GETTING OUT A BRIEF<br />
AND SAYING TO HIM '' WELL,-WE'D LIKE YOU TO DO THAT OR WOULD YOU<br />
LIKE US TO DO THIS'' OR THINGS OF THAT' KIND.<br />
O. K. I<br />
THANK YOU.<br />
