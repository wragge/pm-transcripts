FOUNDATION STONE CEREMONY AT ROYAL MELBOURNE<br />
INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY<br />
Q. C1AUG 1967 ~ Melbourne, Victoria 3DJL, 16<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt<br />
Mr Wood, Mr Anderson, the Hon Lindsay Thompson, distinguished guests,<br />
ladies and gentlemen, students<br />
I was interested in what you had to say about our talks last<br />
week. I thought I was coming to a much friendlier atmosphere here this<br />
afternoon, but what you have said In your Introductory remarks underlines<br />
the fact that, quite apart from what the Commonwealth Government is doing<br />
by way of reimbursement grants and in other direct payments to the States,<br />
we are and this project is concrete evidence of it, literally concrete evidence<br />
of it we are contributing financially in other important ways. And of course<br />
when I say I speak as the representative of the Commonwealth<br />
Government, but we really should include those people throughout the<br />
Commonwealth, whether they are in one State or another, who are contributing<br />
by their tax payments to the revenues of the Commonwealth which ' n turn in<br />
one form or another find some of their way, at any rate into the activities of<br />
the States. As you were saying, this particular historic college has come<br />
a very long way in the eighty years since Francis Ormond assisted it to<br />
develop with a grant of l' 1, 000. In those days financial objectives were much<br />
more limited than we find at this time.<br />
It is appropriate that the first function of this sort which I<br />
should attend as Frime Minister should be in substance the largest project of<br />
its kind that has been undertaken under this new programme 6f aid for advanced<br />
education purposes. This is one of the two largest building projects of its<br />
kind in Australia. The other one ~ s in Sydney. But taking the money provided<br />
for this project, together with the funds the Commonwealth and State provide<br />
for recurrent expenditure, the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology is by far<br />
the largest recipient of funds within the advanced education programme.<br />
You get some idea of how Commonwealth provision has grown<br />
over recent years when I tell you that from 1961 when our expend-* ture on<br />
education was of the order of $ 45 million, mainly for universities, it has<br />
grown to $ 150 million in the financial year just closed, 1966/ 67, which more<br />
than trebles the 1966/ 61 contribution. Of: course the provision for the years<br />
immediately ahead is considerably greater even than that very large figure.<br />
Inside these expenditures are important new areas of assistance, notably that<br />
made to the olleges of advanced education. Perhaps more important though<br />
than the rate of building and the growth of the student body to which you have<br />
referred, Mr Wood, is the quality of the College itself, and its reputation and<br />
standing in the community. Your cdle ge can claim the highest standard in<br />
its own field in the Commonwealth of Australia.<br />
The prime purpose of Commonwealth assistance is t o enable<br />
the standards of these colleges of advanced education to be raised, where<br />
indeed they need raising, to the level where they provide a genuine alternative<br />
to the university. They will differ from the universities, but they should by<br />
no means be inferior to them. As I read through a list of some of the / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
distinguished graduates taking their diplomas from these advanced colleges<br />
of education, I found some of the most notable names in the industrial and<br />
academic life of this country.<br />
From this College alone, you could point in the academic<br />
field to Professor Gordon Brown, Professor in Engineering at the Massachusetts<br />
Institute of Technology, Professor Freeland, Frofessor of Arch-Ite.-ture at<br />
N. S. V1. University. In industry, Mr. WJeichhardt, Chairman of Directors<br />
of I. C. I. Sir Ian Beaurepaire of Olympics, Mr Hans Ernst, Managing<br />
Director of the Cincinnati Machine Tool Company and Mr Perrett who is,<br />
of course, one of our outstandng arch4tects. In the Public Service, Mr G. F.<br />
Browne, Chairman of the Victorian Railways Commissioners, Dr Lennox,<br />
Chief of the CSIRO ' Pool Testing Authority, Dr Symons of the Commonwealth<br />
Serum Laboratories, Dr Grose, of Defence Science Laboratories and Dr<br />
C awsey also with our Defence Science Laboratories. From other Colleges<br />
than RMIT, Sir Mquriae Mawby, one of our distinguished leaders in the<br />
mineral field, and Professor W-; arner, an authority in the metallurgical field.<br />
Now when I recite names of that order of distinction as the<br />
product of colleges such as this, then the point is made that those who come<br />
from these colleges can make for themselves a place in the life of the<br />
community in no way inferior from those who come from our universities.<br />
Indeed the practical knowledge which usually accompanies the work in a<br />
college such as this is becoming increasingly appreciated.<br />
I find myself, as with advancing years my eyesight tends to<br />
weaken, that 1. am taking an increasing interest in the products of industrial<br />
design. Considering such mundane items as the bathroom, the stove, even<br />
wrist watches and matters of that sort, 1 have come to the condusion that<br />
most of these are designed by alert, ikeen-eyed young men and women who<br />
have yet to experience some difficulties which those of us have reached a<br />
more advanced stage cf life experience.<br />
I don't know why we can't standardize, for example, on a red<br />
dot for hot water and a green dot for cold water, particularly when one has to<br />
grope throtgh the mists of the bathroom or when one travels abroad and<br />
they alter the initials in accordance with the description of hot or cold in that<br />
particular country. And occasionally when I try to prepare a modest<br />
breakfast myself down at the seaside, I find that I have to dart for the glasses<br />
these days because the signs on the stove aren't clear enough to tell me<br />
whether it is on or off or medium or high or low, and matters of that sort.<br />
So I do urge that whazever care is given to the theoretical side<br />
of studies and I expect to have a more responsive chord to strike in an<br />
organisation such as this than perhaps in one of the universities that the<br />
practical outcome from those studies will always be borne in mind. It is<br />
all very well to study the humanities but the theories to be applied to the<br />
humanities must at some stage be put -nto practical terms for the human<br />
beings in relation to which the humanities are expressed. It surprises mie<br />
that in so much of industrial design the practical application of what is<br />
intended for a mass of people tends to be lost sight of in the theoretcal<br />
applications-by a person having his own idea, perhaps, of what 4s wanted<br />
rather than visualising the needs of the community as a whole.<br />
But perhaps I may briefly outline what we in the Commonwealth<br />
and our Advsory Committees see as the distinctive features of the colleges<br />
of advanced education. / 2 </p>
<p>-3<br />
I would name them as a wide range of courses to provide a<br />
broad educational basis and cross -fertilisation of ideas; a substantial<br />
proportion of tertiary students; standards of building and services, which can<br />
stand equal to those to be found amongst the best in the world; emphasis on<br />
new teaching techniques; the development of liberal studies both as an<br />
essential ingredient i n all courses and as new courses in their own~ right, and<br />
in making references to liberal studies, I am making no particular allusioni<br />
of course, to any political movement in the country; t heir difference from<br />
the universities in their emphasis on vocational and applied courses; the<br />
part-time students; teaching rather than research; and a close association<br />
with industry and commerce.<br />
As I met members of your Council a little earlier, it was<br />
quite obvious from what I knew of their activities that you have managed to<br />
maintain that close association amongst leaders in their own field of industry<br />
and commerce with the work of the RMIT,<br />
As part of the plan to raise standards, quite apart from the<br />
much larger sums to be provided for buildings and recurrent expenditures,<br />
the Commonwealth is making available for the triennium 1967/ 69 special<br />
unmatched grants of a quarter of a million dollars for research in advanced<br />
education, and of half a-million for library books and materials in colleges<br />
of advanced education. WTithout wearying you too much with statistics, let me<br />
just summarise by saying that from 1965/ 69, the Commonwealth expects to<br />
contribute to advanced education and technical training the following totals<br />
To all States $ 36. 6 million; to Victoria $ 20. 2 million, to RMIT alone<br />
approximately $ 6 million. This $ 6 million reflects a total State and Commonwealth<br />
programme of some $ 13. 9 million It is interesting to reflect on the<br />
fact that in Victoria, for some reason of historical development, we find that<br />
the diploma student population of colleges 3. n this State now totals upwards of<br />
68 per cent. of the total Australian enrolment. In addition to the diploma<br />
students there are large numbers of individual trade or craft students.<br />
Now you have another disti-nction. You are the only Australian<br />
college of advanced education to have a Royal Charter. Yours is the oldest<br />
college in Melbourne. Ballarat I understand is the only older Victorian<br />
college. You were founded at much the same time as our public schools<br />
and the Melbourne University.<br />
Reflecting on the burst of education activity about the time<br />
when you were founded, perhaps there is a parallel in that we are now seeing<br />
again a similar age of expansion in education. New universities of adva nced<br />
education; new emphasis on science education; a quickened awareness of the<br />
importance of training our most valuable asset, the young people of our<br />
community. The Commonwealth has played a significant and, I hope you will<br />
feel, an imaginative part in this new emrhasis on education. Nevertheless,<br />
we have continued to recognise and act on the basis that the States have the<br />
primary responsibility for education.<br />
In referring to the new emphasis we have given to it in our<br />
Commonwealth role, I must pay a tribute to my predecessor, whose drive<br />
gave so much lift to the programme and also to my colleague, the first<br />
Commonwealth Minister for Education, Senator Gorton, who is bringing so<br />
much energy and enthusiasm to his tasks.<br />
In the Department of Labour and National Service, my<br />
colleague, Mr. Bury has been active in the work of the Froductivity Committees<br />
and in the programme of training of apprentices encouraged by that Department.<br />
In other fields in our Australian National University the new university we </p>
<p>are establishing in Papua and New Guinea you get further evidence of this<br />
Commonwealth activity. It is not often recognised how much we are now spending<br />
on education. I gave these figures earlier and mentioned that the total<br />
would be incieasing very rapidly. But it is rather interesting to note that<br />
payments to the States, the colleges of advanced education, the universities,<br />
the science laboratories and teacher training in the financial year ahead of<br />
us will have increased from $ 0' 2m. to $ 115m. or roughly an increase in that<br />
one year of per cent. The grants for colleges of advanced eduation in the<br />
new financial year will be more than double the grants of the last financial<br />
year. We are of course spending a great deal on education in our own fields<br />
of responsibility, partly by way of assistance to students under the various<br />
scholarships schemes, and partly in our own territories. Mr Thompson may<br />
be interested to know . hat the Commonwealth's payments to the S13tates for<br />
education are increasing at a significantly faster rate than the Commonwealth<br />
payments for its own immediate responsibilities i A recognition I believe<br />
of our growing support of the States in their programmes.<br />
Now, the importance the Commonwealth is placing on<br />
colleges of advanced education is evident from the percentages I have just<br />
given. In the words of my colleague, Senator Gorton, they are to be treated<br />
in the important field of capital development in all respects as universities<br />
as to standards, priorities and so on.<br />
Why is the Commonwealth providing this assistance? Wie<br />
believe in the importance of giving our young people a chance to develop<br />
themselves for their full potential. Wle believe that in these colleges there<br />
is a genuine alternative to the universities on which insufficient importance<br />
has been placed inthe past. Vie value the wide range of courses the colleges<br />
offer, the cross -fertilisation of ideas they encourage, we value the emphasis<br />
they place on the inclusion of these liberal studies in technical training.<br />
And we value the empl'asis they place on vocational and applied courses which<br />
fit their students well for playing their important roles in industry and<br />
commerce. These are the features of education which the colleges of<br />
advanced education emphasise, and which the Commonwealth, in partnership<br />
with the States, hopes to promote, Of them the RMIT is a notable example.<br />
But much of the value of these colleges will be lost if the general public is<br />
not made aware of their existence as a genuine alternative to the universities,<br />
and if people are not given every encouragement to use them.<br />
As to your new project, this is the first and largest of<br />
those being undertaken under the Commonwealth $ 24, million capital<br />
assistance programme for the 1967/ 69 triennium. Your 8-acre site is in<br />
a unique situation I believe the project will take you up twelve storeys<br />
high, and it is being redeveloped under an ambitious scheme which should<br />
result in more unoccupied ground space by 1974, combined with three times the<br />
amount of floor space. It is estimated unless they have gone up since these<br />
notes were prepared for me to cost $ 3C million over a ten-year period.<br />
I thought there was a rather ominous ring about your comment, Mr. Wood this<br />
building is the first step.<br />
The Commonwealth has committed itself during the present<br />
and past triennium to assistance of 1$ 2. 6 million towards the project, to be<br />
matched by a State grant, and already to a further $ 360, OCO unmatched out of<br />
its $ 10 million grant to State technical colleges. They are also providing </p>
<p>substantial funds to the RMIT for recurrent expenditure over $ 3 million<br />
during the 1967/ 69 triennium. Without this assistance from the Commonwealth<br />
and State Governments, it would not have been possible for the<br />
Institute to develop these buildings and to cope with the enormous increase<br />
in student population for which you are now preparing.<br />
The Commonwealth Advisory Committee on Colleges of<br />
Advanced Education in its report to the Government during 1966, commented<br />
that it has found this t ype of education going on too often in old gaols and<br />
breweries. Well, you should be doing a good deal better than that, Mr.<br />
Wood. The Commonwealth/ State programme of $ 48 million during the<br />
coming triennium for capital projects is evidence of the serious and<br />
determined approach by both national and State Governments in partnership<br />
with the problem. The new building to be erected on this historic site will<br />
be evidence in concre~ e and steel of the outcome of our endeavours.<br />
But, as I said earlier, perhaps I should fittingly close on<br />
this. While we will see a massive project in terms of concrete and steel,<br />
it is in the quality of the student body and the achievements which they are<br />
able to carry out in these buildings, in the maintenance of the splendid<br />
tradition which marks the RMIT as an outstanding example of what can be<br />
achieved in the advanced education field that we will count the results in the<br />
years to come from the financial provisions we are now undertaking to make.<br />
It is in the hope that there will be added important new and significant<br />
chapters in the distinguished history of the RMIT that I now have pleasure<br />
in formally laying the trowel or whatever the phrase is. I saw the size of<br />
it a moment ago. I felt I should have got a union ticket out before I took<br />
hold of it. It will serve as a useful implement for the next Premiers'<br />
Conference if for nothing else! </p>
