TRANSCRIPT OF' INTERVIEW WITH TERRY WILLESEE AND KERRYANNE<br />
KENNERLEY, GOOD MORNING AUSTRALIA, 12 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
WILLESEE: Good morning, Mr Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Good morning.<br />
WILLESEE: Well you have some tough jobs in your<br />
position, how tough has it been this morning? What are<br />
your feelings; as you say goodbye to two more ships of<br />
Australians off to the Gulf?<br />
PM: Mixed feelings, of course, overwhelming and a sense<br />
of pride at the good fortune that we in Australia have in<br />
the quality of the ships and the crews, the personnel<br />
that we're able to call upon to discharge Australia's<br />
obligation in these times of crisis and when you meet the<br />
men and their families you can't help but be proud to be<br />
leader of thi~ s country because you see a commitment to do<br />
their duty and at the same time you see the pangs of<br />
sorrow at the departure. It's a very human situation to<br />
be in.<br />
WILLESEE: Mr Hawke, one of the questions that is being<br />
asked today i~ s that because war appears now more likely,<br />
what would be your reaction to sending even more troops<br />
if that did occur?<br />
PM: I refuse to get into a hypothetical question, Terry,<br />
about the future. We have made a very firm, clear and<br />
early decision about discharging what we see as the<br />
obligations of Australia in this crisis. The reaction<br />
that we've made has been, as it should be, properly<br />
applauded and understood. We will deal with the<br />
situation as it emerges. We are constantly monitoring<br />
developments and it would be counter-productive to<br />
respond to some hypothetical question because you simply<br />
don't know the circumstances of the future.<br />
WILLESEE: Mr Hawke, your attitude to the hostages has<br />
been criticised<br />
PM: Let me say it hasn't been criticised by the people<br />
who've writtEn to me. I've had very touching<br />
communications from some quarters there which I will not<br />
go but there is very a clear understanding from those<br />
who've communicated two letters and there is a very<br />
considerable degree of understanding of the position of<br />
Australia in this matter. </p>
<p>WILLESEE: Ycour fellow Party member, Tom Uren, has been<br />
critical of you, suggesting you<br />
PM: Well there's nothing new about Tom being critical of<br />
me. WILLESEE: Well he says you're lacking compassion.<br />
PM: Yes, well I'm not going to get into a slanging match<br />
about the compassion meter with Tom Uren. I'm quite<br />
prepared to look at my record in terms of compassion.<br />
But I think it's pointless and undignified to get into<br />
arguments about relative compassion.<br />
WILLESEE: Wetll he says he will go in an attempt to free<br />
some of the hostages. Does he go with your blessing?<br />
PM: Well if Tom goes we have said, as we've said of<br />
other unofficial people, they don't go with any official<br />
sanction but we don't want to deter them. The fact is,<br />
of course, that there's been a unanimous decision of the<br />
European Council of Ministers on this regard that it is<br />
counter-productive for governments to be involved<br />
officially in these because it gives a standing to<br />
Saddam Hussein which is not helpful to the achievement of<br />
the objective that we're about and that is to get Saddam<br />
Hussein to withdraw from the Gulf. But having said that,<br />
I made it quite clear that if there are these unofficial<br />
ventures whic~ h do lead to some people getting out well<br />
then that's a matter of joy for those who are released.<br />
The problem of course is that the overwhelming majority<br />
are going to be retained there and those are the ones who<br />
shouldn't be there at all. The only way you're going to<br />
get all the hostages released is by Saddam Hussein<br />
understanding that his actions aren't acceptable to the<br />
rest of the wrorld.<br />
KENNERLEY: Why do these private envoys up until now, why<br />
have they had success, Anne Fairbairn, and certainly<br />
other international envoys? What are they negotiating<br />
with? PM: Well they are negotiating with a man who's trying to<br />
divide the re-st Of the world and it suits this dictator<br />
who has brutally annexed another country to have these<br />
people coming and waiting upon him to give him a standing<br />
and to say well here, we'll give you a couple, we'll keep<br />
the great majority but here's some for you and some for<br />
you. It suits him fine and that's precisely why, as I<br />
say, unanimously the European Council of Ministers have<br />
decided that there will be no official missions of this<br />
kind. WILLESEE: Mr Prime Minister, thanks for your time this<br />
morning. We really appreciate that.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
