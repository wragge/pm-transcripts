    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today we mark six months since the terrible events in Bali last October. This tragedy remains etched in the consciousness of the nation.</p>
<p>To the families and friends of the 88 Australians who were killed, the many injured and their loved ones, I know that you have been going through a very difficult period. I want to assure you that with all that has been happening in the world recently, the Australian Government and people have not forgotten you. Our thoughts remain with you.</p>
<p>Since Bali, the Federal, State and Territory Governments have provided financial, health and counselling support services to families and this assistance will continue. The solidarity and support expressed by the Australian community has allowed agencies such as the Red Cross to provide additional help to those affected by the atrocity.</p>
<p>During my February visit to Indonesia, I announced a package of medical assistance to Bali, which will serve as a practical living memorial to the victims of the tragedy.</p>
<p>The Australian Federal Police are also continuing to work closely with their Indonesian counterparts to bring those responsible for this outrage to justice. Good progress has been made and the first trials of those accused of involvement will begin in Indonesia shortly. The investigation and arrest and trial of the perpetrators will remain of the highest priority for the government.</p>
<p>Australians will never forget the events of 12 October 2002. The Government and the nation offers its heartfelt sympathy and support to those who have suffered grievously as a result of this tragedy.</p>
