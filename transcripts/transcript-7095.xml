TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH JOHN STANLEY, MACQUARIE RADIO,<br />
31 JANUARY 1987<br />
E 0 E -PROOF ONLY<br />
STANLEY: Prime Minister you have said youi that bel-ieve you-are<br />
now as up to date on the Middle'East as anyone else, apart from<br />
the parties themselves, what are you going to do with that knowledge<br />
now that you have got it?<br />
PM: I have already done sime things with it. I took from Jordan<br />
as I indicated to them that I would, the story of their commitment<br />
which I absolutely accept to the processes of securing peace between<br />
Israel and its Arab neighbours and I think that has been helpful.<br />
I have taking the views from the Israeli Government to President<br />
Mubarak about the commitment and great desire of Israel to be<br />
associated with Egypt in assisting with economic development in<br />
the area. I have undertaken to the Government of Israel to make<br />
further representations to the Soviet government about the question<br />
of Soviet Jewry. I have undertaken also to make certain<br />
representations to the Government of China about the position in<br />
the Middle East. And I have said from the beginning, John, and<br />
I repeat I don't set myself up, and Australia doesn't set itself<br />
up to be mediator. Simply, the positionz now is that I have been<br />
given this unique opportunity of sharing the confidences of the<br />
three states that I have visited-, the opportunitiy of talking with<br />
representatives of the Palestinians. I simply say that if there<br />
are any other things that the parties feel that I can do then we<br />
stand ready to do it. But I repeat we are not saying that " look<br />
here I am, I am now so well informed, off we go to settle a dispute".<br />
That is not the way I look at it. but we stand ready to help in<br />
any way that they think we may be able to.<br />
STANLEY: You urged Israel to consider recognition of the PLO,<br />
with qualifications the PLO would have to recognise Israel.<br />
When did you decide that it was time for Israel to take that step.<br />
PM: If you look back to things I wrote in the 1970s I haven't<br />
got a copy with me, but I think it was fairly specifically in the<br />
Boyer Lectures in ' 79 I was saying these things. That you had<br />
to get a contemporaneity, if you like, of the PLO recognising Israel,<br />
and truly recognising. And not just in some formal way. The<br />
conditions are the acceptance of resolutions 242 and 338 of the<br />
United Nations which secondly involves the recognition of Israel<br />
and thirdly, the repudiation of terror. And to get contemporaneousl<br />
with that then Israel saying then, in those circumstances, we are<br />
prepared in the negotiating processesto treat with PLO. So I<br />
have said that a long, long time ago. I think really what has<br />
happened on this occasion is that getting more immersed in the<br />
detail, more immersed in the attitude of the people directly involved I </p>
<p>P'M cont: I have had my long-held view on this issue confirmed.<br />
that if we could get, as I have put, the translation of the actuality<br />
In other words, I think the actuality now is on the part of the<br />
PLO that however reluctantly they may come to that conclusion,<br />
I think they now understand that Israel is here to stay. on ther<br />
other hand, I think that Israel understands the reality of the<br />
representative capacity of the PLO provided those conditions are<br />
met. And I think that the processes of getting to peace the<br />
very complicated processes would be helped if those actualities<br />
were translated into formal statements.<br />
STANELY: The PLO says it represents the Palestinian people. You<br />
have spoken with passion about the Jewish people, the Israel i state<br />
being established from a dispersed and oppressed people. How does<br />
the Palestinian cause today stack up against the cause of the Jewish<br />
people in the late 1940s.<br />
PM: What you have got to understand is this that when the United<br />
Nations in 1947 made the decision it wasn't a decision which simply'--<br />
envisaged the creation of the state of Israel. It envisaged the<br />
opportunity of a Palestinian state. And up until 1967 Israel<br />
was created as a state in 1948 out of the 1947 United Nations<br />
decisions. For a period of 20 years it was open to states other<br />
than Israel to enable the creation of a Palestinian state. They<br />
didn't do that because they didn't envisage the state of Palestine<br />
which didn't involve the disappearance of the state of Israel.<br />
The position in 1987 20 years later is that I think the Arab<br />
states and the PLO, however reluctantly in some cases, do accept.<br />
the reality and the continued existence of Israel. So we have<br />
got to translate those new realities into part of the negotiating<br />
processes. And within that process,.* the rights of the Palestinian.<br />
people have to observed and our policy as a Government says that<br />
the rights of self-determination include the possibility of an<br />
independent Palestinian state. But what is quite clear from my<br />
discussions in Jordan and with the Palestinians is that what they<br />
see as the only viable, in both political and economic terms, to<br />
come out of that process is a confederatien-of the Palestinians<br />
with Jordan.<br />
STANLEY: Just moving on to Davos where you talked to overseas<br />
investors. One of the things you talked about there was the ACTu<br />
providing some assurances to overseas investors about the industrial<br />
relations climate. Could you see a situation where a potential<br />
investor asks for a no-strike agreement and was actually given<br />
it by the ACTU?<br />
PM: I suppose it is conceivable although I think that the sort<br />
of countries that we are dealing with are all democratic countries<br />
where it is recognised that finally labour should have the right<br />
to withdraw labour. I think rather what we all ought to try and<br />
see is a situation where you create the circumstances in which<br />
that right is not eliminated but that you create a framework of<br />
agreement which contains the processes of dispute settlement which<br />
would make the use of that right unnecessary.<br />
STANLEY: The people you addressed at Davos were not politicians<br />
they are the people that sign the cheques, they are the ones<br />
that make the decisions about investment in Australia what feedback<br />
did you get from them? </p>
<p>PM: If I can reply with all due modesty, it was a magnificent<br />
feedback. I think you know that from others. We got a great<br />
reception. And it was not just a reception for me personally,<br />
Bob Hawke, but I think it also reflected an increased<br />
appreciation of the achievements of Australia. And of<br />
course, I and the Government. properly, claim a considerable amount<br />
of credit for what has happened in the last 4 years. But I think,<br />
importantly also, there is an increased appreciation of not merely<br />
the resources of Australia. its political stability, its significance<br />
in the region but I think there is an increased understanding that<br />
changes have been effected, that there is now a much more positive<br />
approach by alt the constituents in Australia towards trying to<br />
get new investment, to try and create a more diversified economy._<br />
to develop a manufacturing base which can be import<br />
competitive and export-oriented.-And I think perhaps the biggestvirtue_<br />
of my visit there was the understanding __ that we as a gvernment_<br />
are not just talking rhetoric but wehave made a whole range of.<br />
relevant decisions the deregulation of -the-financial sectorthe<br />
restructuring of sectors of our industry, the iron-and steel<br />
industry, the heavy engineering, the shipbuilding, textile, clothing<br />
and footwear. They see that it is not just rhetoric on our part<br />
but we have made the relevant decisions that we are putting<br />
Australia in the position to be competitive. And they want to<br />
be part of that.<br />
STANLEY: You have also received news over the weekend from Sydney<br />
-the by-elections. Were you surprised that you did so well?<br />
PM: No. There were signs before I left -and you will recall<br />
a Bulletin poll which showed that Barrie Unsworth had improved<br />
HIS STANDIN~ G VERY CONSIDERABLY AND I THINK IN THE END IT WORKED<br />
OUT MUCH IN THE WAY THAT I THOUGHT. THAT IS THAT SURE THERE WAS<br />
SOME CONCERN IN THE ELECTORATES ABOUT, IF YOU LOOK AT IT..<br />
THERE WAS SOME CONCERN ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS, THE TOUGH<br />
DECISIONS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD MADE. THAT HAD TO BE AN<br />
ELEMENT. THERE WAS ALSO SOME DISSATISFACTIONS. THERE WAS SOME<br />
ELEMENT OF WHAT HAD BEEN HAPPENING WITHIN NEW SOUTH WALES. IN THE<br />
END ESSENTIALLY, THE ELECTORATE WAS FACED WITH A CHOICE BETWEEN<br />
LABOR AND THE LIBERAL. AND IF THERE HAS BEEN ONE CHARACTERISTIC<br />
OF RECENT TIMES, INCLUDING RIGHT UP TO THE PRESENT OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
POLITICS, IN GENERAL AND IT IS TRUE IN NEW SOUTH WALES AS WELL, IS THI<br />
THE LIBERAL PARTY OFFERS NO ALTERNATIVE. IT IS NQT AN ALTERNATIVE<br />
GOVERNMENT IN AUSTRALIA. AND MAY I SAY THAT IS THE VIEW NOT ONLY<br />
STRONGLY HELD BY MYSELF BUT APPARENTLY IT IS RECENTLY STRONGLY HELD<br />
BY JOH BJELKE PETERSEN. IN OTHER WORDS,-THE PEOPLE, I SUPPOSE THEY<br />
WANTED TO GIVE A BIT OF A WRAP To BARRIE AND THE GOVERNMENT, PERHAPS<br />
A LITTLE BIT OF A RAP TO US, I DON: T KNOW, I DON: T THINK VERY MUCH<br />
TO ASK. I MEAN, AFTER ALL, THEY SAID GIVE KEATING A BEATING. WELL,<br />
HE DIDN: T GET MUCH OF A BEATING. IT WAS THE LIBERAL PARTY THAT TOOK<br />
A THRASHING. AND MY VIEW IS THAT IN NEW SOUTH WALES POLITICS<br />
JOHN, NEW SOUTH WALES LABOR PROBABLY HAD ITS NADIR IN BASS HILL. THE'<br />
ARE ON THEIR WAY UP NOW AND THAT WHEN, THE STATE ELECTION COMES IN 198:<br />
BARRIE UNSWORTH WILL DO WHAT WE WILL DO, THAT IS WE WILL BOTH WIN. </p>
<p>STANELYt JUST ON THE KEATING ASPECT. Do YOU THINK HE IS GOING<br />
FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL J CURVE NOW. DO YOU THINK HE IS ON THE UP.<br />
PM. I BELIEVE so. HE CERTAINLY DESERVES TO BE BECAUSE PAUL KEATING<br />
HAS BEEN A MAGNIFICENT TREASURER. LET ME MAKE THIS POINT INTO NEW<br />
SOUTH WALES POLITICS AND TO THE ORDINARY PEOPLE OF NEW SOUTH WALES.<br />
THERE IS NOONE NOW IN POLITICS WHO HAS GOT TO KNOW PAUL KEATING BETTER<br />
THAN I DO. HE HAS AT TIMES AN APPEARANCE OF ALOOFNESS. PEOPLE MIGHT<br />
TEND TO THINK THAT HE IS INVOLVED JUST SOLELY AND PREOCCUPIED SOLELY<br />
WITH THE IMPORTANT ISSUES OF MANAGEMENT OF THE ECONOMY-AS A WHOLE.<br />
A1 WANT TO SAY TO YOUR LISTENERS,_. THAT I SIT. WITH PAUL-KEATING IN<br />
MEETINGS OF THE EXPENDITURE REVIEW COMMITTEE THAT WORKS UP TO THE<br />
PREPARATION OF BUDGET. I SIT WITH HIM IN CABINET MEETINGS. AND<br />
PAUL KEATING IS A MAN WHO HAS A DEEP COMMITMENT TO TRADITIONAL LABOR<br />
PRINCIPLES AND INTERESTS. THAT IS, HIS CONCERN WITH ECONOMIC GROWTH<br />
GETTING THE ECONOMY RIGHT IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIRECTED TOWARDS TRYING<br />
TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH ORDINARY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE'<br />
THE BEST CHANCE OF IMPROVING THEIR CONDITIONS AND WITHIN WHICH<br />
THE CHILDREN OF WORKING PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE BEST<br />
OPPORTUNITY OF DEVELOPING THEIR TALENT. THAT IS NOT RHETORIC ON<br />
MY PART. I HAVE SEEN IT, I KNOW HE IS CONCE RNED. I HAVE SEEN IN<br />
EXPENDITURE REVIEW COMMITTEE MEETIN6S WHEN THE MINISTER, BRIAN HOWE, HAS<br />
BROUGHT UP PROPOSALS FOR WANTING TO IMPRO6EOUTLAYS IN THE SOCIAL<br />
WELFARE AREA. THERE IS ALSO A RESPONSIVE NOTE WITH PAUL KEATING TO<br />
THOSE SORTS OF CONSIDERATIONS.<br />
STANLEY-YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY HAPPY WITH PAUL KEATING. YOU ARE BACK IN<br />
CANBERRA TOMORROW NIGHT, THERE HAS BEEN NO TALK OF A RESHUFFLE OVER<br />
THE CHRISTMAS PERIOD. CAN WE ASSUME THEN THAT THIS WILL BE THE<br />
LINEUP, IN BROAD TERMS, THAT YOU ARE GOING TO GO INTO THE ELECTION WITH.<br />
PM+ THERE ARE SOME CHANGES OBVIOUSLY THAT WILL ARISE FROM<br />
SENATOR GRIMES. BUT I HAVE MADE IT CLEAR, I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT<br />
ANY MAJOR RESHUFFLE. AND THE POINT TO BE REMEMBERED IS THIS AND MAY I S<br />
THAT I HAVE HAD THIS CONFIRMED BY THE OBSERVATIONS Of THE BUSINESSMEN<br />
IN DAVOS AND THEY SAID IT, NOT JUST IN FRONT OF MET BUT IN FRONT<br />
A WHOLE LOT OF EUROPEAN PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE, THIS IS THE BEST<br />
GOVERNMENT SINCE THE WAR.-THEY TALK ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THIS<br />
MINISTRY. AND THEY TALK ABOUT IT IN UNQUALIFIED TERMS THAT THIS IS<br />
A MINISTRY OF GREAT TALENT. THAT TALENT HAS BEEN HONED AND SHARPENED </p>
<p>PM CONT: IN THE DISCHARGE OF THEIR EXISTING PORTFOLIO DUTIES.<br />
AND IT JUST WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE THERE TO HAVE AN EXTENSIVE<br />
RESHUFFLE. ENDS 4. ii, </p>
