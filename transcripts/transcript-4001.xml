NATIONAL PRESS CLUB 8 DECEBERI 1975<br />
AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE LAST QUARTER OF THE<br />
TWENTIETH CENTURY, AUSTRALIA FACES A DIFFICULT AND<br />
TESTING TIhE AT 1HOE AND ABROAD,<br />
AT HOME IN THE IMEDIATE FUTURE WE ARE CONFRONTED<br />
WITH THE KIND OF ECONOMIC CRISIS NANY OF US BELIEVED<br />
COULD NEVER HAPPEN HERE-A CRISIS COMPOUNDED OF<br />
HIGH AND RISING UNEMPLOYi1ENT AND HIGH INFLATION.<br />
A CRISIS THAT SHOULD INEVER HAVE OCCURRED,<br />
ABROAD, WE ARE FACING A WORLD OF UNCERTAINTY AND<br />
INSTABILITY OF G. REAt GLOBAL PROBLEMS WHICH WILL<br />
REQUIRE GREAT INGENUITY AND GOODWILL TO SOLVE,<br />
BEYOND THESE PROBLEMS THERE ARE OTHER LESS OBVIOUS<br />
NIOBNUE TT HE LESS, VITALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES WHICH<br />
CONCERN THE VERY BASIS OF OUR WAY OF LIFE AND STYLE<br />
OF GOVERNMENT.<br />
IT IS ABOUT THESE THAT I AM GOING TO TALK TODAY. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
S THESE ISSUES CONCERN THE VERY MANNER IN WHICH<br />
AUSTRALIA IS TO BE GOVERNED OVER THE NEXT<br />
QUARTER CENTURY AND BEYOND,<br />
THEY CONCERN THE RELATIONSHIP OF GOVERNMENT<br />
TO THE PEOPLE, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH PEOPLE<br />
S'CAN CONTROL THEIR OWN LIVES IN A SOCIETY IN WHICH<br />
GOVERNMENTS TEND TO BE INCREASINGLY INTRUSIVEI<br />
AND DEMANDING,<br />
THEY CONCERN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS<br />
AND THE OTHER INSTITUTIONS OF OUR SOCIETY<br />
ESPECIALLY LARGE BUSINESSES AND LARGE TRADE<br />
UNIONS, WE. MUST MAKE SURE THESE INSTITUTIONS<br />
SREMAIN RESPONSIVE TO THE NEDS OF PEOPLE<br />
WII TTH" EI N THEM.-<br />
: AND FINALLY. AMONG THESE CRUCIAL ISSUES, IS THE<br />
QUESTION WHETHER WE, AS A PEOPLE, CAN FIND A<br />
RENEWED FAITH AND COMMITMENT TO OUR CAPACITY<br />
TO PROVIDE A DECENT LIFE FOR EVERY PERSON WHILE<br />
AT THE SAME TINE ENCOURAGING THE VERY BEST<br />
OUR PEOPLE CAN OFFER, I </p>
<p>-3-<br />
AUSTRALIA V' CHANGING.,<br />
THE WORL!) CHANGING,<br />
AUSTRALIA'; INCREASINGLY RECOGNISE THAT THE OLD<br />
CONFLICTS A'i. O DIVISIONS HAVE LESS AND LESS<br />
MEANING, THERE ARI. MI/-IY TRADE UNIONISTS WHO NO LONGER FEEL<br />
ANY IDEN JI ICATION WITH THE PARTY OF THEIR<br />
TRADITIONAI SUPPORT,<br />
THEY NO I oNlflf: R FEEL FOR OBVIOUS REASONS THAT<br />
THERE IS ANY NECESSARY RELATION BETWEEN THEIR OWN<br />
NEEDS AND IIIF POLICIES OF THAT PARTY.<br />
INCOME (' PORTUNITIES IN AUSTRALIA ARE fMORE<br />
EQUALLY jII:; I!' IBUTED THAN IN ALMOST ANY OTHER<br />
COUNTRY I IIIE WORLD, DESPITE THE EXISTENCE OF<br />
SIGNIFICA! I I'OCKETS OF DISADVANTAGE AND REAL NEED. </p>
<p>THE CHALLENGES THAT FACE US NOW ARE NEW,<br />
IN MANY W. AYS THEY ARE EXCITING, THE DEGREE OF<br />
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC EQUALITY WE HAVE PROVIDES<br />
AN UNCOMMON CHANSE FOR AUSTRALIA.<br />
ARNOLD TOYNBEE WROTE TWELVE VOLUMES EXAMINING<br />
THE RISE AND FALL OF SOCIETIES AND CIVILISATIONS.<br />
HE CONCLUDED THAT THE ESSENTIAL FACTORS IN A<br />
SUCCESSFUL RESPONSE TO CHALLENGE WERE THE QUALITY<br />
OF GOVERNMENT AND THE CHARACTER OF THE PEOPLE,<br />
IF WE FACE OUR PROBLEMS SQUARELY AND DO OUR<br />
BEST TO UNDERSTAND THEM I AM CONFIDENT WE CAN<br />
MEET THE CHALLENGES, </p>
<p>SIR ROBERT MENZIES IN HIS BOOK " THE MEASURE<br />
' OF THE YEARS" LAID DOWN HIS VIEW OF THE<br />
OBLIGATIONS OF AN OPPOSITION PARTY, HE SAID:<br />

TO DEVISE A BODY OF IDEAS AT ONCE SOUND AND<br />
PROGRESSIVE" " OPPOSITION MUST BE REGARDED AS A GREAT<br />
CONSTRUCTIVE PERIOD IN THE LIFE OF A PARTY,<br />
PROPERLY CONSIDERED, NOT A PERIOD IN THE<br />
WILDERNESSI BUT A PERIOD OF PREPARATIONS FOR<br />
THE HIGH RESPONSIBILITIES 4WHICH YOU HOPE WILL<br />
\ iCO MEl.<br />
i </p>
<p>-6-<br />
WE IN THE LIBERAL AND NATIONAL COUNTRY PARTIES<br />
HAVE SPEND OUR TIME IN OPPOSITION PREPARING ONE<br />
OF THE MOST FAR-REACHING, EXCITING AND PROGRESSIVE<br />
PROGRAMMES WE HAVE EVER ATTEMPTED,<br />
I AM CONFIDENT THAT IF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE<br />
APPROVE OUR POLICIES ON DECEMBER 13, WE CAN MAKE<br />
AN EFFECTIVE START TO MEETING THE-SE PROBLEMS, -2c Fc<br />
IT WILL BE OUR OBJECTIVE TO:<br />
BRING INFLATION UNDER CONTROL AND GET<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT DOWN AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE.<br />
ESTABLISH A STYLE AND FRAMEWORK OF GOVERNMENT<br />
STHAT WILL LEAD TO EFFECTIVE POLICY FORMiN ATION<br />
SAND DECISION-MAKING.<br />
MAKE GOVERNMENT TAXATION POLICIES MORE OPEN<br />
AND HONEST.<br />
ESTABLISH CO-OPERATIVE -NOT CONFLICTING </p>
<p>-7-<br />
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT<br />
AND STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.<br />
STRENGTHEN THE AUTONOMY, RESPONSIBILITY AND<br />
FLEXIBILITY OF LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT CLOSEST<br />
TO THE PEOPLE AND REVERSE THE EXCESSIVE<br />
CENTRALISATION OF POWER IN THE FEDERAL<br />
GOVERNMENT, ENCOURAGE, AND WHERE NIECESSARY, LEGALLY<br />
ESTABLISH, PROCEDURES THAT WILL MAKE SURE<br />
THAT LARGE BUSINESS ENTERPRISES REMAIN<br />
RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO<br />
WORK IN THEM, SIMILARLY lWIE WILL ESTABLISH<br />
PROCEDURES WIHICH ENSURE THAT TRADE UNIONS REMAIN<br />
RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THEIR MEIMBERS AND<br />
ARE NOT CAUGHT UP IN THE SEARCH FOR POW-ER FOR<br />
POWER'S SAKE. i . Lt </p>
<p>-8-<br />
S ENSURE THAT ALL PEOPLE THE SOCIALLY AND<br />
ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED AS WELL AS THE<br />
BETTER-OFF HAVE MAXIMUM FREEDOM OF CHOICE<br />
NOT ONLY IN THE GOODS THEY BUY, BUT IN<br />
EDUCATIONAL, WELFARE, AND OTHER SERVICES AS<br />
IELL,<br />
AS PART OF THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF CHOICE AND<br />
DIVERSITY STRENGTHEN TOLERANCE AND UNDERSTANDING<br />
OF DIFFERING LIFE STYLES, AUSTRALIA HAS MOVED<br />
BEYOND THE AGE OF A NARROW ANGLO-CONFORMITY,<br />
GOVERNMENT MUST RECOGNISE THIS. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
FINALLY, ENSURE THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE<br />
OPPORTUNITIES AND EiNCOURAGHEEMN T TO ACHIEVE<br />
OF THEIR BEST, SO THAT ALL AUSTRALIANS CAN<br />
BENEFIT,<br />
ONLY IN THIS IAY CAN AUSTRALIA BE A NATION OF<br />
INDEPENDENT PEOPLE CONFIDENT IN THEIR ABILITIES TO<br />
ACHIEVE AND MASTER THEIR DESTINY,<br />
ONLY IN THIS W'AY CAN ALL AUSTRALIANS HAVE<br />
THAT STRONG FOUNDATION OF SELF-RESPECT ON<br />
WHICH TOLERANCE AND GENUINE AND WILLING<br />
CO-OPERATION CAN BE BASED, </p>
<p>IF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE APPROVE OUR APPROACH<br />
ON DECEMBER 13 IE WILL ESTABLISH A STYLE OF<br />
GOVERiNMEN: T -THROUGH HICH-lE CA'N GIVE EFFECT TO<br />
AND DEVELOP, OUR POLICIES,<br />
ONE OF OUR FIRST CONCERNS WILL BE TO SECURE THE<br />
INTEGRITY AND PROFESSIONAL CHARACTER OF THE PUBLIC<br />
SERVICE* FREE FROM POLITICAL APPOINTMENTS.<br />
OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT CAN ONLY WORK EFFECTIVELY<br />
AND EFFICIENTLY WITH A POLITICALLY NEUTRAL<br />
PUBLIC SERVICE..<br />
i LEGAL PROCEDURES WILL BE ESTABLISHED WHICH<br />
WILL SECURE THE BEST APPOINTMENTS TO THIS END,<br />
THESE PROCEDURES WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE<br />
PUBLIC SERVICE ACT.<br />
THESE PROCEDURES WILL ENSURE THAT SUITABLE<br />
CANDIDATES FROM WITHIN THE PUBLIC SERVICE<br />
ARE NOT PASSED OVER WHILE NOT PRECLUDING.<br />
APPOINTIMEHTS FROM' 1 OUTSIDE THE SERVICE. </p>

IN THIS WAY PROPER PROCEDURES WILL BE FOLLOWED<br />
AND THE INTEGRITY OF THE PUBLLC SERVICE PROTECTED,<br />
8. GOVERNi. MEINT WILL NOT BE PRECLUDED FROMv APPOINTING<br />
OUTSIDERS WITHOUT ADVERTISEMENT BUT IN SUCH<br />
CASES IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT SUCCEEDING<br />
GOVERNMENTS CAN REVIEW SUCH AN APPOINTM[ ENT.<br />
IN OTHER WIORDS. SUCH AN APPOINTMENT WOULD<br />
HAVE NI1P ERMANENCY ATTACHED TO IT.<br />
THESE RULES APPLY TO ALL FUTURE APPOINTMENTS.<br />
THEY WILL NOT APPLY RETROSPECTIVELY, WE WILL<br />
NOT ALTER THE RULES UNDER WHICH PAST APPOINTMENTS<br />
HAVE BEEN MADE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT. ONE MISTAKE<br />
CAN BE RECTIFIED BY A SECOND MISTAKE, S-* 1 </p>
<p>-13-<br />
UNDER THE LIBERAL-NATION 4L COUNTRY PARTY GOVERNMENT<br />
THE PERiMNENT HEAD OF A DEPARTMENT WILL BE<br />
EXPECTED TO BE THE SENIOR ADVISER TO THE<br />
MINISTER. HE WILL BE EXPECTED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT NOT<br />
ONLY INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM HIS DEPARThMENT<br />
SOURCES, BUT ALSO INFORAT ION AVAILABLE FROM THE<br />
WIDER COMMUNITY<br />
OUTSIDE ADVICE WILL BE AND OUGHT TO BE<br />
ACTIVELY SOUGHT,<br />
ALL GROUPS AND SECTIONS OF THE COMIUNITY<br />
MUST HAVE THE RIGHT TO PUT THEIR VIEWS<br />
BEFORE THE GOVERMENMT. </p>
<p>i4l-<br />
BUT THE PROCEDURES FOR OFFERING ADVICE WILL<br />
HOT BE ALLOWED TO BE A BATTLE-FIELD OF<br />
ENDLESS CONFLICT,<br />
WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE PROTECTION OF PUBLIC<br />
SERVICE INTEGRITY AND PROFESSIONALISN1 DOES<br />
NOT PLACE A WvALL BETWvEEN GOVERNMENT AND THE<br />
COMMUNITY, THIS WOULD BE A DISASTER,<br />
PARLIAMENT-ITSELF MUSTl B REVIVD AS HE CENTRAL<br />

ROLE TO PLAY, I </p>
<p>ONE OF THE 61OST INIQUITOUS EFFECTS OF INFLATION1 HAS<br />
BEEN THE RAPIDLY INCREASING TAX BURDEN OF THE. LAST<br />
FEW YEARS.<br />
PEOPLE ARE PAYING EVERY YEAR A LARGER PROPORTION OF<br />
THEIR INCOMES IN TAXATION THOUGH THIS HAS NEVER BEEN<br />
SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZED BY THE PARLIAMENT.<br />
A BASIC PRINCIPLE OF REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNIEINT HAS<br />
BEEN OVERTURNED BY INFLATION.<br />
UNDER INFLATION TAXATION INCREASES AUTOMATICALY<br />
IF PARLIAIENT TAKES 0 DECISION, UNDER PRESENT<br />
CONDITIONS PARLIMIENT HAS TO TAKE AN INITIATIVE ONLY<br />
IF IT WISHES TO SOP THE INCREASE IN TAXATION.<br />

THERE ARE A NUMBER OF : OTHER REFORMS WHICH<br />
WOUL SIGNIFICANTLY -IKPROVE THE LEGISLATIVE<br />
PERFORMANCE OF THE PARLIAMENT AND WHICH<br />
COULD BE; INTRODUCED IN THE -NEAR FUTURE<br />
ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE.-REFORMS OF PARLIAMENT<br />
AS AN INSTITUTION, WOULD BE TO IMPROVE THE SCOPE<br />
AND EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS COMMITTEE SYSTEM,<br />
AN ESTI'AtTES OR EXPENDITURE COMMITTEE SUCH AS<br />
EXISTS IN THE HOUSE OF COTMMONS WOULD DO MUCH<br />
TO IMPROVE PARLIAMENT'S CAPACITY TO CONTROL<br />
GOVERNNENT SPENDI NG AND -WATCH OVER THE<br />
S ADMINISTRATION, IT WOULD BE A COMMITTEE<br />
SITTIl1G THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND EXAMINING<br />
THE PRINCIPLES AND-PROCEDURES ADOPTED BY<br />
DEPARTM&gt; ENTS IN THE FORMATION OF ESTIMATES. </p>
<p>-18-<br />
I BELIEVE THERE IS ALSO A VALUABLE ROLE<br />
FOR A STEERING COMitTTEE TO ASSIST INITHE<br />
PASSAGE OF NON-CONTROVERSIAL LEGISLATION.<br />
SUCH A COMMITTEE COULD DECIDE TO DIRECT<br />
LEGISLATION EITHER TO SPECIAL PURPOSE COMMITTEES<br />
OR TO THE WHOLE HOUSE, SUCH A COKITTEE COULD<br />
PROMOTE MORE CONSIDERED DEBATE IN AN APPROPRIATE.<br />
FORUM.<br />
THESE-ARE JUST T0 EXAMPLES OF PRACTICAL REFORMS<br />
OF -PARLIAMENT.<br />

AUSTRALIA HAS VERY CLEAR AND NATURAL<br />

AS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE AUSTRALIAN SENATE<br />
