TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH AT THE LAUNCH OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOOD UNIVERSITIES<br />
GUIDES 1996, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 6 JULY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Well thank you very much Paul ( Kelly]. It is good to see you back in the portals<br />
of Parliament House after all those years here. But still having an influence on<br />
the debate as Editor of The Australian and, of course, a very particular<br />
influence in terms of the coverage by The Australian newspaper of education.<br />
As you say, your Wednesday supplement which is the place where I am sure<br />
most people in Australian education go to read about their industry and what is<br />
happening with it.<br />
But could I acknowledge Dean Ashenden and Sandra Milligan who are with us,<br />
the authors of the Good Universitis Guides; Professor Logan' Vice-Chancellor<br />
of Monash; Professor John Hey, from Deakin; Pfofessor-Seqeantson, the<br />
Acting Vice-Chanicellor of the ANU; and, Professor Wilmoth from the RMIT,<br />
where I was yesterday. It is good to hae you -alo, ll of you-.<br />
I am very pleased to have the opportunity to do these two things launch the<br />
Good Universities Guides and to present the 1995 University of the Year<br />
Award. I am particularly impressed with the Guide, it says at the first line,<br />
" All nformation needed to answer the two big questions. Which course?<br />
Which campus?" and then it goes through to describe the universities, the<br />
courses, how you get in, how difficult it is for entry, what sort of courses on offer<br />
and, if you have completed a course, what sort of standing it has. These sorts<br />
of issues.<br />
And I think what is particularly pleasing to me about it is that a decade or so<br />
ago you wouldn't have needed this Guide because there just wasn't so many<br />
people in the system and the fact that we have recognised that Australia's great<br />
comparative advantage is its education system and that our greatest resource<br />
is the creativity of our young people, of our students. </p>
<p>Just knowing that fact, just a country coming to terms with that particular fact, is<br />
important in itself. Rather than, perhaps, the sense of the cargo cult with<br />
another paddock full of wheat, or another mountain of iron ore will do the trick.<br />
Rather, we are saying no, no, what will do the trick is to exploit the thing which<br />
is of greatest value to all of us and that is the creativity of our young people and<br />
the growth of our education system and focussing the very great ability of our<br />
educators and putting a premium on their capacity to educate.<br />
I think it is this, the notion that we wish to be a clever country, but more than<br />
that, rather than simply the amenity of technological capacity or wealth.<br />
Just this question about the liberation which education brings, the sense of<br />
democracy, the inter-generational opportunities. It is the great bridge in<br />
Australian society from wherever one is from, in socio-economic terms, to<br />
wherever one wants to go. You can go there by crossing this bridge and that is<br />
why there has been such a singular commitment by the Government over 12<br />
years to education.<br />
As a consequence, we have now got just on 600,000 people in higher<br />
education, compared to 325,000 in the middle 1980s a 60 per cent increase.<br />
It is just a phenomenal number. One of the things which pleases us about it,<br />
and part of the reason we can keep the numbers up is that we have made big<br />
financial commitments and by introducing quite revolutionary schemes like<br />
HECs equitable, democratic schemes like HECs where we are asking<br />
s-tu6dents to refund, when they reach average weekly earnings, 23 per cent of<br />
the cost of the course. When it comes back 100 per cent of it goes to other<br />
students. I noticed yesterday there were a group of students demonstrating against HECs<br />
and other things at RMIT, where I was. But a third of them out the front<br />
wouldn't have been there Without HECs, which is a point lost on them I am<br />
sure. But it is, I think, a very great innovation and many other countries are<br />
now coming to pick it up. And it is equitable, it works through the tax system,<br />
you don't need to pay anything until you get to average weekly earnings and,<br />
yet, all of it goes back into higher participation rates in education.<br />
I think that the option of higher education, something that is within the view of<br />
most students, is a great thing. When I went to school, when I completed the<br />
Intermediate Certificate in New South Wales, there were only very few students<br />
I went to school with who had any expectation of going to universities. In my<br />
day, people didn't know about them and despite the scholarships which were<br />
around and many people in this room would have been advantaged by the<br />
scholarships of the day, the Commonwealth Scholarship Scheme, it was in the<br />
end, nevertheless, a fairly elite system covering too few people. And, hence,<br />
you know something like this Guide would have been basically unnecessary<br />
because there wasn't the sense that everybody had the opportunity of going.<br />
I think the other thing that pleases me about the change in participation rates in<br />
schools and higher education, is the opportunities it has brought to women, to<br />
young women, to girls to stay in higher education and then join that throughput,<br />
so that we are now getting about the same throughput out of the higher </p>
<p>education system that any comparable industrial country, like Australia, would<br />
have. And part of that stream, which is about 40 per cent I think of the people who<br />
complete and graduate from Year 12, about 40 per cent of that stream go<br />
through higher education and, of course now I think a majority of them are<br />
young women, which is ~ a great thing. It means that whatever people think<br />
about the glass ceiling, the reality of it, the prejudice in the system, or the<br />
absence of opportunity, the mere fact that education is going to be spread so<br />
widely amongst women and the higher education opportunities are going to be<br />
there, it means there is no ceiling which will contain them. In other words, they<br />
won't be looking for the favour, they will simply take it and that is what I think is<br />
important giving them the capacity to go and grab it.<br />
So this is a very revolutionary change for us all and one that is now powering<br />
along in the society we have, making it stronger and fairer and more equitable,<br />
and giving us a chance to, in fact, see the universities become not simply<br />
providers of education, but businesses in themselves.<br />
I know there is a debate about this, but I am sure we are well able to keep this<br />
balance between the core responsibilities and core tasks of a university and<br />
their capacity to do things, which at the same time advance the economy and<br />
advance their place in it.<br />
I noticed yesterday at RMIT that being shown through the IT areas of<br />
university, one can see that what was on offer was something that was likely<br />
not to be repeated in too many places, not only in Australia, but around the<br />
world. And you can see the obvious commerciality, or the commercial<br />
opportunities, that the courses have on offer. And we have seen this in so<br />
many other ways and in so many other fields as we have seen universities<br />
change over the period.--<br />
I would like to also just mention that just in terms of through-put in the<br />
Budget of this year, we added another 11,000 places to higher education, and I<br />
think that commitment, again, just underpins the fact that there is no<br />
complacency on the Government's part about the challenge with higher<br />
education, and keeping resources up to it. The other area, I think, that we in<br />
the Government are particularly interested in, and I know higher education<br />
institutions are interested in too, and that is the inter-face with TAFE. And<br />
again, at RMIT yesterday we saw Universities and TAFE vocational education<br />
sitting beside one another. And the capacity for people to stream themselves<br />
through TAFE to University, to undertake Diploma's, to gather for themselves<br />
accreditation for particular courses in Universities is, I think, a very welcome<br />
trend and it means that the traditional ways we thought about higher education<br />
are going to change, and that the career paths of students, or the paths of<br />
students rather, is going to be different than it has been in the past.<br />
The Cinderella of Australian education, of course, has been TAFE, and it is a<br />
great challenge now before us with the training agenda so " much on the<br />
Government's minds through Wyorking Nation and th," 4raineeships etc to be<br />
able to lift the capacity of vocational educational so that the 60% of people who </p>
<p>don't go to higher education are not cascading into a labour market to which<br />
they are unsuited where job opportunities are curtailed, or constrained, and<br />
where the large majority of them are untrained, which not long ago was the<br />
case still the case, in fact. We're now getting to a point where, we have now<br />
the Commonwealth since One Nation we have put $ 1.2 billion into TAFE, into<br />
vocational education, and through ANTA, we expect to be able to tie the TAFE<br />
systems of the State's together with vocational certificates, which will then have<br />
currency across the country. And where, at the same time, outside the<br />
formality of the state TAFE systems, develop a private training market, where in<br />
particular areas, we can see private trainers being provided, and in particular<br />
localities, where industries need a specific focus for training needs, we can see<br />
them coming together and operating the training market. Getting business<br />
involved in vocational education is, I think, the way for us, so that the labour<br />
market demands have far more influence on the product of vocational<br />
education, than does simply the providers the traditional providers of<br />
education. This is, I think, a very exciting change for us, and I was pleased to<br />
see the take up in vocational education in the last year as well, so that there is<br />
a lot of discernment out there on the part of students about what may be<br />
advantageous to them and the labour market, whether they are, in fact, they<br />
are better off in higher education, or they are better off specialising through<br />
vocational education. I mean, they are getting very canny about those choices,<br />
which means the sophistication of the system is rising.<br />
Now, I think again, this is where the guide will matter, because I am quite sure<br />
that the most interested student just can't know about the courses which are on<br />
offer, the choices, the combinations that are on offer around the country. And<br />
with such a great stock of people now seeking a place in higher education, we<br />
really need to have, I think, this sort of information available so that the whole<br />
panoply of opportunities is made clear, and at the same time, I think though I<br />
haven't read it comprehensively there is also some guide in here to vocational<br />
education as well. I think that's very good...<br />
In looking through the Guide, for instance on a University talking about a<br />
University how they rate and compare status and standing, they have stars.<br />
Quality committee views stars; research track record stars; getting in,<br />
toughness to get in, and there's a guide; flexibility of entry there's a guide;<br />
places for school-leavers; there's a guide; admission for TAFE graduates<br />
there's a guide; the global connection, international students there's a guide.<br />
And then it goes to teaching quality committee view, teaching innovation,<br />
library holding, graduates course ratings, and then what's on offer the breadth<br />
of offering: a vocational orientation, external study. And then the payoff<br />
getting a job, proceed to further studies, starting salary etc. In other words, it's<br />
the sort of guide that a young person needs or not even a young person<br />
coming to look at a university. So I think it's a terrific piece of work, I really do,<br />
and congratulations for it.<br />
I have got two pleasant duties to do one is to launch this, the other is to<br />
announce the University of the Year. Now, we boast now a great number of<br />
Universities. In 1995, the focus of this award has been on the integration of<br />
information and communications technologies into undergraduate education.<br />
Now, I think the information highway which we hear about now every day, </p>
<p>more than one time a day most days has enormous potential as an<br />
educational tool. And I suppose it is probably in Universities and in educational<br />
institutions where there is a fascination with the information highway because<br />
of the amenity which it can obviously provide for teaching. We can use it to<br />
increase the curriculum choices offered to students, and we can use it to<br />
transport ideas and knowledge around the country to people who live on the<br />
margins of our society, and it is obviously one of the instruments in Open<br />
learning. Some Universities are already exploring it I mentioned RMIT<br />
yesterday with a raft of courses and the ANU has created a sophisticated<br />
network which is fully accessible to undergraduates a virtual campus in itself.<br />
But the University making the best use of the new technologies, and the winner<br />
of the Good Universities Guide 1995 University of the Year Award is Deakin<br />
University. Deakin uses the information highway to provide world-class<br />
distance education when the student can't come to the University, Deakin<br />
takes the University to the student. Deakin students work from mines and<br />
factories and offices, as well as from classrooms and lecture theatres, but<br />
through the use of computers and e-mail and faxes and printed materials, they<br />
engage in the dialogue that is the hallmark of the traditional university<br />
education. Deakin is an unconventional university, but of course, a good one.<br />
And I might say, that it is an illustration of the success of the Government's<br />
higher education reforms that the Australian University of the Year in 1995<br />
doesn't have a single block of sandstone to its name.<br />
So, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to extend my congratulations to Deakin,<br />
the Vice Chancellor is here, of course, to acknowledge that, and also again,<br />
repeat my appreciation and congratulations for the publication of this<br />
document. Let me again repeat those congratulations to Dean Ashenden and<br />
Sandra Milligan, and also to Paul Kelly, the editor of The Australian, because I<br />
think no newspaper has tracked the course of Australian education quite like<br />
The Australian has, and now with these continuing innovations coming through<br />
in higher education, in vocational education as we are seeing such a ferment<br />
and flux in our higher education and vocational institutions having the national<br />
newspaper chart it, record it, talk about it, debate it, is, I think, the sort of thing<br />
that newspapers are there to do. To be papers of record, to put information put<br />
there that people genuinely need and gamner, and where they can understand<br />
better about what they are doing relative to other people. So, perhaps I can<br />
conclude my remarks by saying that in recent times I never seem to be out of<br />
universities and vocational institutions. It is a great pleasure to me that we<br />
continue to just power on in this area, and let me assure you that the<br />
Governiment will be keeping the resources up to the sector, because it is our<br />
great comparative advantage it is our great hope, it is our great liberating<br />
force, it is one of the most democratic tools we have in our society, and I am<br />
delighted to be involved again with some of the key people who are fashioning<br />
this change in Australia. Thank you.<br />
ends. A, </p>
