AUSTRALA IPRIME<br />
MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 16 APRIL 1978<br />
AUSTRALIA-EEC TRADE<br />
I welcome the assurance given in Brussels to the Australian<br />
Ambassador that there is now no question of cancelling the<br />
bi-lateral talks and that these will be held early in June.<br />
It is my wish and the wish of all Australians, that the<br />
negotiations with the EEC that the Minister for Special Trade<br />
Representations, Mr. Garland, will have will be productive. We<br />
seek to achieve equitable trading opportunities with the major<br />
trading bloc in the world.<br />
The Government has consistently and for many months pointed to<br />
the imbalance of opportunities between the EEC and Australia.<br />
We are virtually shut out of many of Europe's markets by<br />
quantitative restrictions and non-tariff barriers. On the other<br />
hand, Europe has much more open access to Australian markets.<br />
The present opportunities are unequal. My government has the<br />
simple objective of giving Australia's producers a fair go in<br />
Europe. I have used, and will continue to use, direct and<br />
accurate language in describing the erosion of our markets in<br />
Europe since the Community came into being.<br />
In addition to that, the dumping of their subsidized agricultural<br />
surpluses in other markets compounds our problems.<br />
I was in Brussels last June. Mr. Howard left a detailed note<br />
in Brussels in October. Now, after Mr. Garland has left<br />
Australia for detailed discussions we learn the Community needs<br />
another month.<br />
My responsibility to the Australian people was to express the<br />
Government's concern in forthright, direct and accurate terms,,<br />
and that I did.<br />
It is no credit to the Labor Party that while Australia's<br />
products were being shut out of Europe it raised no protest and<br />
no authoritative voice to arrest the trend. In their time, our<br />
markets for most of our major agricultural products virtually<br />
disappeared. I find it incomprehensible that the Labor Party speaks on this<br />
issue only to chide the Government for seeking to redress<br />
what the Labor Party lost. They suggest the Community should<br />
be treated with kid gloves and that we should use a feather duster.<br />
If they themselves went even as far as that when they were in<br />
office, nobody was aware of it. Their great achievement was<br />
to lose markets. </p>
<p>Of all the political parties in all the democracies in the<br />
world, it is only the Australian Labor Party which advocates<br />
a counsel of despair in relation to Europe's agricultural<br />
policies. Australian farmers will remember that the Labor<br />
Party not only lost those markets, but now does not want the<br />
Government to do anything about regaining some of them.<br />
At a time when Australia needs a total approach, with the<br />
Australian community standing with the Government totally and<br />
absolutely in its efforts, the ALP takes an attitue that can<br />
only undermine Australia's negotiating position. We can all<br />
remember that that is what the Labor Party did last year when<br />
it set out deliberately to undermine the strength of the<br />
Australian dollar for political purposes.<br />
If the Labor Party was concerned for great national objectives, if<br />
the Labor Party was concerned to achieve the essential<br />
unity of purpose that would strengthen Australia in these vital<br />
discussions, they would support the Government in its effort<br />
and at the same time bring credit on themselves.<br />
