THE FIRST YEAR<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. E. G. TWHITLAM, Q. C. M. P.,<br />
ON THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE LABOR GOVERNMENT'S<br />
FIRST YEAR OF OFFICE<br />
( With summaries and tabulations of<br />
legislation, reports, inquiries<br />
and decisions.)<br />
2 DECEMBER 1973 </p>
<p>THE FIRST YEAR<br />
The first Australian Labor Government in 23 years has been<br />
in office for just one year.<br />
I submit this document to mark that anniversary and to bring<br />
to the attention of the Australian people the record of that year,<br />
to give you the evidence of promises fulfilled and reforms begun.<br />
I include also the evidence of unwarranted obstruction by the<br />
non-Labor forces in the Senate; their obstruction of the Government's<br />
clear mandate from the people to get things done.<br />
The year has been one of great industry and great purpose.<br />
What has already been done stands in striking contrast to the record<br />
of sloth and incompetence which characterised the decaying years<br />
of the outgoing Government.<br />
The program I presented to the Australian people on 13 November<br />
1972 had three great aims. I restate them. They are:-<br />
to promote equality<br />
to involve the people of Australia in the<br />
decision-making processes of our land<br />
to liberate the talents and uplift the<br />
horizons of the Australian people.<br />
In pursuit of those aims we have introduced a record number of<br />
bills into the Parliament. We have swept away anachronistic and<br />
unnecessary relics of the past selective national service by ballot<br />
and the death penalty in Australian territories.<br />
We have withdrawn the last remnants of our unhappy " presence"<br />
in Vietnam. </p>
<p>3<br />
LEGISLATION Since the 28th Parliament assembled on<br />
27 February this year a record total of 244 bills<br />
has been introduced, with the session still unfinished.<br />
Never before in our history has such a wideranging,<br />
reforming program come before the Parliament.<br />
The nearest to it was the total of 169 bills in the year<br />
1968, of which 157 were passed.<br />
Of the 244 bills so far introduced and there<br />
are more to come before the year is out 163 have already<br />
been passed, even though the Government lacks a majority<br />
in the Senate. There are still 68 bills before the Parliament<br />
as the session draws to a close and possibly about 10 more<br />
to be introduced. Thirteen bills have already been deferred or<br />
stand rejected in the Senate. They include major bills for<br />
reform of the electoral system.<br />
A legislative program of the magnitude I have<br />
described imposes an extremely heavy work-load on the<br />
Parliament and the administration.<br />
I pay tribute to the Public Service and to the<br />
many distinguished Australians outside government who have<br />
given so much of their time, energy and skills to help bring<br />
our programs forward.<br />
( Details of bills passed, those before the<br />
Parliament and those rejected, deferred or<br />
amended by the Senate, are attached in<br />
Appendix B.) </p>
<p>-2<br />
We have introduced new policies for our cities and country<br />
regions and in social welfare and education.<br />
We have introduced new policies in our foreign relations,<br />
particularly in our own region of Asia and the Pacific.<br />
We have brnuQht new vigour and vitality to the arts.<br />
We have tackle2 the greatest immediate problem of all<br />
domestic inflation with resolution.<br />
We have moved swiftly to protect Australia's natural resources<br />
and reverse the trend to foreign ownership and control of our industries<br />
By using special task forces of experts, consultants, commissions<br />
and committees of inquiry, as well as the customary interdepartmental<br />
of the Public Service, we are overhauling every f ie]. d of<br />
government responsibility at home and abroad.<br />
In my recent Robert Garran oration I explained how the<br />
Government had combined these elements with the Public Service and<br />
added F, " think tank" to advise on l~ ong-term priorities.<br />
A total of 90 Commissions of inquiry, committees and task forces<br />
have been at work during the year reporting to the Government.<br />
It has been our practice and this will continue to make<br />
public, through the Parliament and in other ways, the reports and<br />
recommendations of these committees and inquiries.<br />
This year 29 reports on inquiries instituted by the Government<br />
have been tabled in Parliament and 19 statements issued on meetings<br />
and discussions with State Governments.<br />
This commitment to open government was a pledge we made and<br />
a pledge we shall keep.<br />
( A list of reports released is contained<br />
in Appendix A) / 3 </p>
<p>4<br />
THE ECONOMY In its first year the Government's over-riding consideration<br />
has been to contain and reduce so far as a national government can<br />
the inflationary pressures in the economy.<br />
With the limited powers we already possess we have:-<br />
Established a Prices Justification Tribunal<br />
and a Joint Parliamentary Committee on Prices.<br />
Revalued the Australian dollar twice and<br />
reduced tariffs by 25% " across the board"<br />
to make imports cheaper and ease domestic<br />
demand pressures.<br />
Used other fiscal and monetary measures to<br />
restrain demand by mopping up liquidity and<br />
checking capital inflow. These include some<br />
increases in indirect taxation, an increase in<br />
the Statutory Reserve Deposit Ratio and active<br />
intervention by monetary authorities in the<br />
bond market.<br />
Introduced a Trade Practices Bill to eliminate<br />
price rings and cartels and unwarranted pricing<br />
arrangements.<br />
Called a representative Industrial Peace Conference<br />
to consider ways of securing greater industrial<br />
peace and stability.<br />
Established an Interim Commission for Consumer<br />
Standards to ensure that people buying goods get<br />
value for their money.<br />
Introduced certain price controls in the A. C. T. as<br />
an example to the States and to protect the<br />
community. </p>
<p>In addition, we are seeking national powers over<br />
prices and incomes at the referendum on 8 December.<br />
This follows the refusal of some States to refer these<br />
powers freely to the Australian Government so that a * national<br />
attack on inflation can be made. Valuable time has been lost<br />
through no fault of ours.<br />
Our referendum proposals have been opposed by the<br />
Opposition, whose careless management of the economy during<br />
its last term in office created most of the inflationary<br />
problems we are tackling today.<br />
RE SOURCES Just over a year ago I said in my policy speech:<br />
" We are determined that the Australian people<br />
shall be restored to their rightful place in<br />
their own country as participants and<br />
partners in government or the owners and<br />
keepers of the national estate and the<br />
nation's resources<br />
we will put Australians back into the business<br />
of running and owning Australia."<br />
This pledge is well on the way to fulfilment.<br />
The pace we are making is limited only by the road-blocks the<br />
opposition parties are erecting in the Senate.<br />
We are almost the last country in the world to take<br />
steps to check the uncontrolled growth of foreign ownership of<br />
industries and our natural resources.<br />
Time was running out when the responsibility was passed<br />
to us. We wasted no time. Here are some of the things we<br />
have done: </p>
<p>6<br />
Three months after the election we decided<br />
that all minerals would be subject to export<br />
controls to ensure the orderly development<br />
of the mineral industries.<br />
We have begun to increase Australian control<br />
over our natural resources and have set, as an<br />
objective, full Australian ownership of uranium.<br />
We also regard this as. a desirable objective in<br />
development projects involving natural gas,<br />
oil and coal.<br />
We have closely scrutinised take-over activity<br />
by foreign interests among Australian companies.<br />
Nearly 500 proposed take-overs have been brought<br />
to notice.<br />
We have refused 19 takeovers which we considered,<br />
on balance, to be not in the national interest;<br />
49 ( mainly mining) have been deferred; 51 are<br />
under consideration and 29 have lapsed.<br />
There have been 322 cases allowed to proceed.<br />
We have set up a Pipeline Authority which will<br />
establish a nationwide pipeline system to<br />
distribute petroleum, natural gas and other<br />
hydrocarbons from the wells to the main centres<br />
of population<br />
We have brought legislation before the Parliament<br />
to strengthen the Australian Industry Development<br />
Corporation. This will allow greater Australian<br />
participation in major enterprises ( provided the<br />
Opposition does not block it in the Senate). / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
We initiated a review of foreign investment<br />
in real estate. Until this review is complete<br />
overseas interests are being discouraged from<br />
significant purchases for the time being, and<br />
the Reserve Bank will not normally grant foreign<br />
exchange approval for such purposes.<br />
A Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate<br />
is in progress to give advice on areas and<br />
historic places which should be protected and<br />
preserved as part of the Australian heritage.<br />
We have introduced a bill to establish an<br />
Industries Assistance Commission based on a<br />
report by Sir John Crawford. This bill<br />
will give industries primary and secondarythe<br />
opportunity to present publicly a case for<br />
Government assistance and to obtain assistance<br />
when circumstances warrant it.<br />
HEALTH AND WELFARE<br />
I have said that one of our great aims was " to liberate the<br />
talents and uplift the horizons of the Australian people."<br />
This is possible only in a climate of personal and national<br />
security and in a congenial environment.<br />
As my colleague the Treasurer said when he brought down the<br />
August Budget, " Australia was once a leader in the provision of<br />
welfare services. It is so no longer, but this Government intends<br />
to change that state of affairs."~<br />
We have already done so, in a year.<br />
New benefits, flowing from the Budget, are already relieving<br />
the pressures on our less fortunate citizens and other benefits,<br />
including the national health insurance scheme which is central to<br />
our program, are well advanced. ./ 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
Pensions have been increased all round and the first step<br />
has been taken in the abolition of the means test over a period<br />
of three years for residentially-qualified people of 65 years<br />
and over. Our policy objective is to raise the pension rate<br />
twice a year until it reaches 25% of average weekly earnings.<br />
Welfare services of all kinds for the young,<br />
the old, the handicapped and the neglected have been extended.<br />
The universal national health insurance scheme, which<br />
will give every Australian access to medical and hospital care<br />
either free or at minimal cost, has been developed and refined<br />
after full public debate.<br />
It will give us one of the most advanced and comprehensive<br />
public health schemes in the western world when it is joined with<br />
the new programmes flowing from the work of the Sax Commission.<br />
It will be a far better and cheaper scheme than<br />
those we have now.<br />
EDUCATION In our first Budget we committed $ 843 million to<br />
education for 1973/ 74 almost double that given by our predecessors<br />
the year before. This great thrust will be applied through existing<br />
authorities and a new permanent Australian Schools Commission<br />
for which legislation is before the Parliament. In the meantime<br />
it is being directed by an Interim Committee, set up only ten days<br />
after the election, which will continue to do the job if the<br />
Opposition delays the creation of the Commission itself. / 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
This program is already lifting Australian education from<br />
the doldrums. It is giving new opportunities to young<br />
Australians. In a month from now the Australian Government will take<br />
over full financial responsibility for tertiary education.<br />
Fees will be abolished and increased living allowances will be<br />
paid to students who need them. Teaching scholarships have been<br />
trebled. Aid will be available to all schools, without distinction,<br />
on a " needs" basis.<br />
This and much else was part of this year's Budget commitment<br />
to education. ( Details of new social welfare benefits<br />
and education provisions are in<br />
Appendix E.)<br />
CITIES We came to office determined to make our cities decent<br />
places to live in and to develop new regions for a growing population.<br />
We have set up the new departments of Urban and Regional<br />
Development and Environment and Conservation. We have a Cities<br />
Commission. All have been active.<br />
In October we signed an agreement between the-Australian,<br />
New South Wales and Victorian Governments for the development of<br />
Albury-Wodonga as the first of our planned regional centres. </p>
<p>-11-<br />
HUMAN RIGHTS This Government is committed to taking all possible<br />
legislative and administrative action to prevent discrimination<br />
on the grounds of colour, race, sex, language, religion,<br />
political or other opinion, national or social origin,<br />
property, birth or other status.<br />
We have made this commitment clear in regard to our<br />
Aboriginal citizens. We have eliminated all racial implications<br />
from our immigration policies.<br />
We have made it clear to other Governments by our<br />
early decision six days after the election to exclude raciallyselected<br />
sporting teams from Australia.<br />
We are pledged to appoint an ombudsman. We have already<br />
appointed an ombudsman for the armed services.<br />
In a wider context, we have enshrined these principles<br />
in legislation. Two complementary bills one on Human Rights<br />
and the other on Racial Discrimination are now before the<br />
Parliament. WOMEN The Australian Government is able, and therefore bound,<br />
to remove or reduce many aspects of legal, social, educational,<br />
and economic discrimination against women. We are trying to do so.<br />
In June this year the Government ratified a basic ILO<br />
Convention on discrimination in employment and occupation which<br />
will be of benefit to women. It is also committed to ratify the<br />
ILO Convention on equal pay for women.<br />
The Human Rights Bill which has been introduced is<br />
a further step in the direction of reducing discrimination. </p>
<p>10<br />
We have offered to the States financial assistance totalling<br />
$ 136 million for the establishment of 12 growth centres, for land<br />
acquisitions in urban areas and for aid in upgrading urban public<br />
transport systems and reducing the sewerage back-log in major urban<br />
areas. We signed a new Housing Agreement with the States which will,<br />
in particular, provide for increased advances over the next five<br />
years at low rates of interest for the provision of welfare<br />
housing.<br />
ABORIGINES For too long, to the nation's shame, the Australian Aboriginals<br />
were denied their basic rights. This we are correcting with the<br />
utmost despatch.<br />
We established a separate Ministry to deal with all matters<br />
affecting Aboriginals.<br />
A National Aboriginal Consultative Committee, elected by the<br />
Aboriginals themselves, will act as an advisory body for the<br />
Government. We have almost doubled, to $ 117 million, the Budget provision<br />
for Aboriginal advancement in 1973/ 74.<br />
We have accepted the recommendations of the first report of<br />
the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission and made new provisions for<br />
education, health, housing and employment opportunities for<br />
Aboriginals. The Government has also decided to assume direct responsibility<br />
for Aboriginal affairs in all States and is negotiating with the<br />
States to this end. / 11 </p>
<p>12<br />
The Government has made a review of employment conditions in the<br />
Australian Public Service. As a result all positions in the Service are<br />
to be open equally to men and women applicants. Advertisements of<br />
vacancies and the placement of staff are to be changed to avoiOd the<br />
possibility of selection on the basis of sex.<br />
The age limits for permanent appointments have been lifted from<br />
all but a very few designations.<br />
Further funds were allocated in the Budget for training and<br />
retraining schemes for women.<br />
The possibility of creating more permanent part-time emrlovment is<br />
being studied and various trial schemes of fl~ exible working hours are<br />
being introduced.<br />
Maternity leave provisions for Government employees have been<br />
extended tc 12 weeks on full pay and a further 40 weeks unpaid without<br />
risk to continuity of service or status.<br />
A cowpleLelv new benefit, the Supporting Mothers's Penefit, has<br />
been introduced. This benefit is payable to unmarried mothers includlinoy<br />
Oeserted de facto wives and de facto wives of Prisoners, to married<br />
women not living with their husbands, and to wives who have been<br />
separated for other reasons, * provided they have the care of their<br />
children. Any woman receiving this support is eligible to participate<br />
in the training scheme for widow pensioners.<br />
one of the first decisions of the Covernment was to remove the<br />
s&amp; 1es tax on oral contraceptives and place them on the pharmaceutical.<br />
benefits list. Prompt action has also been taken in the allocation of<br />
grants for family planning.<br />
Extensive grants have been made available both for research into<br />
child care and for the construction and operation of child care centres.<br />
The Pre-Schools Commission is shortly to recommend measures which<br />
the Government should adopt to ensure that child care and pre-school<br />
centres be provided for below school acre children. 11 </p>
<p>13<br />
CULTURE AND LEISURE<br />
In culture and leisure, which are inseparable from a literate<br />
and healthy society, we have opened up new horizons for Australians.<br />
Our financial aid to the Arts has been doubled in a year to<br />
$ 14 million. For the first time artists and writers have a new<br />
security of income and a new incentive to exercise their creative<br />
talents. We have enlarged and reformed the Australian Council for the<br />
Arts, which will be established as a statutory body, with its<br />
autonomous boards, to be known as the Australia Council.<br />
We have given a new direction to tourism, with an emphasis on<br />
youth and an encouragement to " Go See Australia".<br />
We are giving direct help to the States for the preservation<br />
of historic sites and settlements which will attract tourists.<br />
We have committed funds to the development of recreational<br />
and sporting acitivities.<br />
No national Government before has given such leadership in<br />
these matters so vital to the intellectual life and leisure of<br />
the nation.<br />
FOREIGN POLICY AND DEFENCE<br />
I believe that in a year we have demonstrated a new independence<br />
in our foreign relations, strengthened old friendships and forged<br />
new ones. We have recognised China and made significant new trading<br />
arrangements for wheat and sugar. / 13 </p>
<p>-14-<br />
We have opened up new areas of co-operation with Japan<br />
and initiated NARA a treaty of friendship which our predecessors<br />
refused to negotiate.<br />
We have told our Asian neighbours of our aspirations<br />
for a regional association to enable us to share with all<br />
nations in South-East Asia, including China, hopes and ambitions<br />
for progess and prosperity.<br />
We have re-affirmed our friendship with our nearest<br />
neighbour, Indonesia.<br />
We have re-affirmed our traditional friendship with<br />
Britain and the United States, unimpared by the independence<br />
of our policy and the steps we have taken in our region.<br />
We have taken action against French nuclear testing<br />
in the Pacific before the International Court at the Hague.<br />
We have, in full understanding, and by mutual consent,<br />
changed the Royal Style and Titles so that Her Majesty the Queen,<br />
when she is here, is Queen of Australia.<br />
In defence, the Australian Government has shaped its<br />
pIicy to the realities of the day, the honouring of its pledges<br />
ai-I the piOuh'so" of a better deal for those in the Armed forces;<br />
Where all are Pow Vo] uiite, r.<br />
We have brought in a new deal for servicemen in pay,<br />
conditions and retirement benefits, a Defence Forces Ombudsman<br />
was appointed last week to deal with individual grievances.<br />
We have announced in accordaice with our election<br />
undertaking the withdrawal of our forces from Singapore,<br />
including all combat elements in the Anzuk Brigade. These will<br />
return to Australia early next year.<br />
Arrangements have also been made for the Minister for<br />
Defence to have discussions with the United States Government on<br />
the future management and control of U. S. bases and joint facilities<br />
in Australia. We have acted to streamline the workings of defence<br />
administration by merging the defence group of service department;<br />
into a single Defence department. / 14 </p>
<p>I am confident our armed forces are now being more<br />
efficiently and effectively organised and will continue to<br />
serve this country well.<br />
In foreign policy and on defence we have honoured,<br />
and will continue to honour all our treaties, arrangements<br />
and obligations.<br />
CONCLUSION This first year is complete. We, as a Government,<br />
have done much. We have kept to our pledges and our program.<br />
I believe what has been done in a year has not<br />
been matched before.<br />
But there is much yet to be done. We will carry on<br />
with the same vigour and the same confidence.<br />
We believe the Australian public will judge us<br />
fairly on a record second to none and on an election mandate<br />
on its way to fulfilment.<br />
