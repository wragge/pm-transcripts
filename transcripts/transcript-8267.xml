SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL DINNER<br />
SYDNEY, 9 MARCH 1991<br />
Mr President, Mr Secretary-General, distinguished guests,<br />
ladies and gentlemen<br />
It is a very great pleasure and honour to welcome you all<br />
tonight, on this occasion of the meeting of the Socialist<br />
International Leaders' Conference. I do so, of course, both<br />
as Prime Minister of Australia and as leader of the<br />
Australian Labor Party.<br />
I extend an especially warm welcome to our distinguished<br />
visitors from overseas, representing, as you do, the great<br />
cause of social democracy around the world.<br />
And I am here to say, at the outset, that there has never<br />
been a time in the 20th century, when the fundamental values<br />
and ideals of social democracy have been more relevant, more<br />
important, for the future of humanity than they are today.<br />
The events in Central and Eastern Europe have confirmed that<br />
relevance dramatically. But the representation here of the<br />
fraternal parties from Asia, the Middle East, Africa*-. and<br />
South America remind us of our world-wide role and<br />
relevance.<br />
Mr President, it is just over a year since the Berlin Wall<br />
came down.<br />
There is no need for me, here tonight, to dwell on the<br />
immense symbolism of that event.<br />
It is unnecessary, because in your own presence, in your own<br />
life and career of service and sacrifice, Mr President, we<br />
have a living embodiment of more than .50 years of struggle<br />
against two monstrous tyrannies.<br />
And it was no accident of history but rather in the very<br />
nature of things that both those totalitarianisms<br />
identified, as their foremost and common enemy, the cause </p>
<p>you have served so nobly, the cause we represent the cause<br />
of social democracy.<br />
We are all honoured by your presence tonight. We are all<br />
honoured by your Presidency.<br />
This is a year of important anniversaries among them the<br />
anniversary of the Socialist International and the<br />
Frankfurt Declaration, about which I will say something<br />
later. But here in Australia, as you all know, it is the 100th<br />
birthday of the Australian Labor Party.<br />
And to understand the true significance of that event, and<br />
to understand its relevance to social democracy today, we<br />
need, I think, to realise that this centenary marks a very<br />
precise event an event which had a very specific purpose<br />
and meaning.<br />
What happened in 1891 here in Sydney, and more or less<br />
simultaneously in the colonies of Queensland, Victoria and<br />
South Australia, as they then were was that the trade<br />
union movement established a political organisation with the<br />
express purpose of securing direct parliamentary<br />
representation for the workers in this country.<br />
By that decision, by its commitment to the parliamentary<br />
system, the Labor Movement set the Party, which it had<br />
created, upon the course to which it has kept, to this day.<br />
The Australian Labor Party has been profoundly shaped by its<br />
fundamental commitment to parliamentary democracy.<br />
But equally important: more than any other Australian<br />
institution, more than any other political organisation, the<br />
Australian Labor Party has shaped the very nature and<br />
content of the Australian democracy itself.<br />
In June 1891, history was made when the Labor Party, here in<br />
New South Wales, secured the election of 35 members$ 2. a<br />
third of the Parliament to form the world's first<br />
parliamentary Labor Party.<br />
And in the light of all that has happened since, it is<br />
instructive to read the objective which the fledgling party<br />
set itself. The founders stated, as their purpose:<br />
' To secure for the wealth producers of this colony such<br />
legislation as will advance their interests, by the<br />
return to Parliament of candidates pledged to uphold<br />
the platform of this Association.<br />
To bring all electors who are in favour of democratic<br />
and progressive legislation under one common banner and<br />
to organise thoroughly such voters, with a view to<br />
concerted and effective action at all general elections<br />
in the future.' </p>
<p>Over the decades, the objectives of the Labor Party have<br />
been hotly debated and frequently re-stated. Yet no<br />
formulation has better stated its consistent purpose than<br />
that of the Party founders one hundred years ago.<br />
It has often been said, and correctly said, that the<br />
Australian Labor Party was born with a sense of history.<br />
Indeed, that sense of its past has always been, and remains,<br />
one of the great sources of its strength and its confidence<br />
about its future.<br />
One of that first band of 35 members elected to the New<br />
South Wales Parliament, George Black, himself wrote a<br />
history, and tried to identify some of its formative<br />
influences. ' No movement so widespread' he wrote in the 1920s, ' could<br />
owe its origin to any one person. To discover the impulses<br />
and influences which generated the Australian Labor<br />
Movement, one must look far beyond those who stood beside<br />
its cradle when its feeble cries, almost inarticulate, first<br />
reached the public ear'. Black then proceeded to trace<br />
Labor's first appearance in Parliament ' to the Eureka<br />
Stockade, the Chartist movement in England, the teachings of<br />
Tom Paine, William Cobbett, Robert Owen, through to the<br />
French Revolution and Rousseau, Voltaire and Montaigne, and<br />
ultimately to the Sermon on the Mount'. Perhaps even beyond<br />
that, he said: ' from hilltop to hilltop of thought, to the<br />
first incoherent mutterings of toilers who felt that their<br />
conditions were unnatural and unjust, but had no idea as to<br />
how they might be bettered.'<br />
Now, that's a fairly comprehensive ancestry.<br />
But there is a notable absentee from the cradle of<br />
Australian Labor.<br />
Karl Marx doesn't get a guernsey.<br />
And the truth is, throughout its long, often turbu~ dlit,<br />
always vigorous, history, the Australian Labor Party has<br />
utterly rejected Marxism and the ideology constructed upon<br />
it. Specifically., the Australian Labor Party, from the<br />
beginning, has rejected the dogma of the class war.<br />
And the distinctive creation of the early Labor Movement and<br />
the first Labor Governments the arbitration system is<br />
one of the enduring outcomes of that rejection. The legal<br />
foundations of our arbitration system rest upon the<br />
recognition of equality the equality of unions and<br />
employers before the industrial tribunals.<br />
In effect, a statutory declaration against the class war. </p>
<p>That, no doubt, is one of the reasons why we have the<br />
distinction of having been singled out by Lenin himself, in<br />
1914, as an example of all the worst shortcomings of social<br />
democracy.<br />
Mr President, as you will recall better than any of us here,<br />
when this organisation was reconstituted as the Socialist<br />
International in 1951, it too, specifically rejected Marxism<br />
and the class war, in the terms of the Frankfurt<br />
Declaration. It is now extraordinarily difficult to convey, to a new<br />
g6neration, the derision and contempt with which it was<br />
greeted by the ideologues who accepted the instruction of<br />
the Comintern.<br />
Yet, everything that is most hopeful in Europe today<br />
springs, in large measure, from the stand taken by the<br />
parties of social democracy in Western Europe 40 years ago.<br />
It is easy enough to say, with hindsight, that the collapse<br />
of the central command systems was inevitable that<br />
ultimately the human spirit would break the system before<br />
the system crushed the human spirit.<br />
Yet,' few in the 50s would have dared to venture that the<br />
collapse of communism, materially and morally, was a<br />
foregone conclusion, at least in our lifetime.<br />
And of all the factors which produced the epic, and<br />
epoch-making events of 1989, none were more important than<br />
the example and the efforts of the parties of social<br />
democracy. That is why I said at the beginning that the values and<br />
ideals we hold had never been more relevant or important.<br />
And the key to those values is the enlargement of liberty,<br />
through the advancement of equality of opportunity.<br />
For all the variations we make in our respective panties,<br />
the differences in emphasis according to time, cirqftstance,',<br />
the diversities of economies, nationalities and cultures,<br />
these are the enduring themes, the enduring values of social<br />
democracy: liberty, equality, opportunity.<br />
And underlying all, underpinning all, is the commitment to<br />
democracy. This cause our cause endures precisely because it<br />
rejects the -arrogance of dogmas and ideologies which claim<br />
to be universal.<br />
But the values the cause represents can speak to men and<br />
women everywhiere.<br />
It has been -the honour of the Australian Labor Party to be<br />
the standard bearer of those values, now for a century </p>
<p>pre-eminently, but by no means exclusively, because this is<br />
a great democracy, and we do not claim a prescriptive<br />
monopoly on all virtue, now or in the future.<br />
But I do profoundly believe that the greatest single source<br />
of the strength of the Australian democracy has been the<br />
strength of the Labor Party, and the values of liberty,<br />
equality and opportunity the values of social democracy<br />
which we represent. </p>
