PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ill OPENING OF THE NATIONAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CENTRE<br />
11 CANBERRA 23 NOVEMBER 1988<br />
Your Excellency, Mr'Yanagi,<br />
oman Sir Neil Currie,<br />
Ms Wendy McCarthy,<br />
Mr Eishiro Saito,<br />
Distinguished Guests,<br />
est Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
will 1988 has been a memorable and exciting year for Australians.<br />
Our Bicentenary has provided a magnificent opportunity not<br />
only for celebration but also for more enduring achievements<br />
which, long after 1988 has entered the history books, will<br />
ng be appreciated by future generations of Australians.<br />
The National Science and Technology Centre is just such a<br />
project: innovative, important and enduring.<br />
e ens There is of course only a very small number of national<br />
institutions deemed worthy of location here in the<br />
e a Parliamentary triangle the focal point both of Canberra's<br />
he formal life and of its tourist activity.<br />
and The decision to place the National Science and Technology<br />
Centre among these premier institutions in this area<br />
reflects the high priority the Government attaches to it.<br />
Another proof of the importance we attach to this Centre is<br />
the decision taken by Cabinet this week, which I am pleased<br />
to announce tonight, to establish the Centre as a statutory<br />
corporation. in this form, the Centre will receive the<br />
recognition it deserves as a significant national<br />
institution, and will also have the maximum autonomy to<br />
pursue corporate sponsorship and other commercial<br />
activities. So the Government does see this Centre as very important<br />
and before I express my thanks to the many people who<br />
deserve recognition for their contribution, I want briefly<br />
to explain why this Centre is an important addition to<br />
Canberra an3 to Australia. 372Lt<br />
n i. </p>
<p>It is no overstatement to say that as welcome as this<br />
building is in 1988, it is perhaps a pity that it was not<br />
opened, say, twenty years ago.<br />
if it had been, there would already have been two decades<br />
during which Australian children were brought up with the<br />
insights into science, and the enjoyment of science, that<br />
this Centre now provides.<br />
That could only have been to the benefit of the Australian<br />
economy and to the Australian community.<br />
Because if we are to have an economy restructured so as to<br />
allow us sustainable prosperity in the future, we need to<br />
get the fundamentals right first.<br />
And one of these fundamentals is scientific research.<br />
It has been argued by the Australian scientific community<br />
that the hands and minds that should shape Australian<br />
science into the next century are not being attracted to<br />
careers in science.<br />
If that is so, it would be a tragedy for all of us.<br />
What is needed is a concerted national effort to encourage<br />
the further development of science and technology in<br />
Australia. The taxpayer is already contributing, through Government<br />
programs, a fair share to this effort through tax<br />
deduction schemes, through direct funding of basic and<br />
applied research through the CSIRO and elsewhere, and<br />
through the education system.<br />
Accord-ing to the OECD, th e Australian public sector's<br />
contribution to research compares favourably, as a<br />
proportion of GDP, with similar countries.<br />
The reforms to our education system now being put in place,<br />
including the massive expansion in university places, will<br />
continue this trend.<br />
The work of the Australian Sci'lnce and Technology Council<br />
will continue to provide an important and valued source of<br />
independent advice to the Government.<br />
The Government has also shown it is prepared to coordinate<br />
research in new and emerging areas of inquiry, such as our<br />
recently announced studies into the Greenhouse effect.<br />
Just two weeks ago Australia was elected to vice<br />
Chairmanship of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change<br />
set up by the United Nations and the World Meteorological<br />
Organisation. This gives Australia a leading position in<br />
the panel activities which'are seen as a prime focus for<br />
world activity on the Greenhouse effect.<br />
3* 722 </p>
<p>But because of the fundamental importance of scientific<br />
research, the Government recently decided to investigate<br />
what further support should be given. I established a<br />
senior officials group to suggest short and long term<br />
measures that can be taken to strengthen our research and<br />
development effort. This group will present a preliminary<br />
report to Cabinet's Structural Adjustment Committee next<br />
week. I can * assure you this process is not a cosmetic exercise to<br />
stifle voices of concern. I and my colleagues will be<br />
treating the report seriously and reacting positively.<br />
Ultimately, however, Government can't do the job on its own.<br />
industry has to play a greater part than it is now if we are<br />
to expand those key sectors essential to our long term<br />
competitiveness. It is to build an active partnership with industry that we<br />
are reforming CSIRO and university laboratories to make<br />
better use of their enormous reserves of talent.<br />
We want to see Australian industry take a greater role in<br />
direct research spending and in supporting Australian<br />
researchers so that those who have made a world-class<br />
e breakthrough with world-wide commercial application are not<br />
forced, as they have been too often in the past, to look<br />
overseas to develop their findings.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
For all these reasons, the sponsors of this new Centre are<br />
to be especially congratulated.<br />
The Centre has a number of major sponsors from Australian<br />
industry but I am sure I speak for the Centre when I say<br />
it would be keen to hear from other companies as potential<br />
sponsors.<br />
e, I pay tribute to my ministerial colleague, Barry Jones, who<br />
I has been committed to this project from the start, and I<br />
congratulate Dr Michael Gore and his colleagues who brought<br />
to the Centre the skills and enthusiasm of Questacon.<br />
f But perhaps more than anyone else, the Government and<br />
business community of Japan deserve our most sincere thanks.<br />
e Their generous financial contribution provided about half<br />
the total construction costs of this Centre, which makes it<br />
a very substantial Bicentennial gift indeed.<br />
So it is appropriate too that the grounds of the Ceintre will<br />
nge be adorned by some of the 1200 1cherry trees which were also<br />
given to Australia by Japan to mark our Bicentenary. 3723 </p>
<p>4.<br />
This is perhaps a precursor of great things to come. For if<br />
we are to succeed in establishing a stronger commitment to<br />
our research base then we will also need to look closely, as<br />
we are, at concepts such as the Multifunction Polis which<br />
has been proposed by Japan.<br />
This may become a unique cooperative venture between<br />
Australia and Japan and we can ill afford to let gestures of<br />
this kind slip from our grasp.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
This Centre will provide a tremendous boost to Australian<br />
science, and a major new attraction for school groups and<br />
other tourists who come to Canberra.<br />
This Centre will justly stand as an enduring symbol of the<br />
friendship between Australia and Japan.<br />
I wish the Centre well in its future activities.<br />
This Centre is all about " hands-on" scientific experience.<br />
It is now my pleasure, in a " hands-on" fashion, to declare<br />
open the National Science and Technology Centre.<br />
