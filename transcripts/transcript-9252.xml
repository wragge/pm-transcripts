PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
CIVIC RECEPTION, NOYERS-BOCAGE, NORMANDY, FRANCE<br />
MONDAY 6 JUNE, 1994<br />
Distinguished guests, citizens of Noyers-Bocage and veterans of the second<br />
world war, from Australia.<br />
I think we Australians feel proud to be among you and I'm delighted that so<br />
many of us could be with you today. As I was moving around the crowd of<br />
course, the faces all looked the same I didn't know who was Australian and<br />
who was French. And, I think it is nice for the veterans to come back to meet<br />
the community that they defended when they could never have met them, like<br />
this, at the time. Because, it has to be real... one doesn't fight for something<br />
and die for something which is ephemeral or imaginary and that which is real<br />
is, of course, the kinship between Australia and France. So, for the families<br />
who lost their sons and daughters, in some cases in this part of the<br />
world, to hear the expression of heartfelt thanks from President Mitterrand<br />
today is, I think, a very heartfelt, confident and reassuring thing.<br />
When you see the village pictures at the front door you see how much<br />
destruction there was here and how vicious and evil the Nazis were... and<br />
entrenched and how hard they were to remove. But, the French understand<br />
liberty and they understand democracy, as we Australians do; true<br />
democracy, deep democracy. And, that is why we could never live, any of us,<br />
under the tyranny of fascists like Hitler. So, these are lessons that we all<br />
have learned expensively, some more expensively than others. This all<br />
happened the year I was born. Fifty years later I want to remember and I<br />
want all Australians to remember. And, Mr Mayor, we are in your debt when<br />
your citizens remember, too.<br />
So, let's agree that there is a great friendship between Australians and the<br />
people of France. Indeed, between the people of France and all the people<br />
who fought here. Let us agree that there is a kinship which extends across<br />
countries, across borders and across -cultures. So, today, we again celebrate<br />
our freedom and our friendship and faith in one another. And thank you for<br />
being such gracious hosts to us, thank you for coming in such numbers to see </p>
<p>my countrymen. We're delighted to be among you, we thank you, Mr Mayor,<br />
for the privilege extended to us and hope that D-Day will never be forgotten.<br />
Mr Mayor, I have a picture for you of an Australian flier shot down here. Pilot<br />
Officer Mason who was reburied, as I said, in 1992. And, so in 20 or 30 or<br />
years from now someone will look at the picture and understand what it was<br />
all about.<br />
Thank you very much, indeed.<br />
ends. </p>
