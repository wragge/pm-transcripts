PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 17 DECEMBER 1978<br />
NORMALISATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN<br />
THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA<br />
The Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Malcolm Fraser, CH, MP,<br />
today said that he understood and supported President<br />
Carter's statement that the United States and the People's<br />
Republic of China had agreed to recognise each other and<br />
to establish diplomatic relations from 1 January 1979.<br />
The Prime Minister said that in these major matters there<br />
were often two sets of interests. The first involved<br />
the global situation, the strategic balance and relations<br />
between the major powers. The second concerned the needs<br />
of a region or of parts of a region. Quite plainly,<br />
President Carter had no alternative but to give priority<br />
to the f irst set of interests in these very difficult<br />
negotiations. The Prime Minister said that North Asia was an area where<br />
the interests of all major powers converged, and it was<br />
most important for the stability of the region that all<br />
of these powers should be in close relations. The exchange<br />
of full diplomatic relations between the United States<br />
and China would in itself be of paramount importance in<br />
maintaining the international strategic balance. It would<br />
also enable the United States to play a fuller and more<br />
effective role in Asia and the Pacific. This would<br />
require the maintenance of appropriate American power and<br />
influence political, economic and military in the region.<br />
The fact that China was now looking outward as never before<br />
in her history, and was determined to modernise, and that<br />
both countries had decided to enter into full relations, would<br />
greatly strengthen the world situation.<br />
In recent times, a great deal of attention had been focused<br />
on Europe and Africa: the move to recognition by the<br />
United States served notice that American policy in the Pacific<br />
and Asia would not go by default.<br />
The initiative came from a nation with global responsibilities<br />
imposed on her by her own power. It came from a nation<br />
responding to those responsibilities. / 2 </p>

The Prime Minister commented that the people of the<br />
United States and China also had much to gain from the<br />
normalisation of relations. For many years, the people<br />
of the two countries had been denied the full range of<br />
cultural, commercial and other exchanges. Each had<br />
much to offer to the other in these fields, and the new<br />
status of the relationship was therefore expected to<br />
bring substantial mutual benefits.<br />
The Prime Minister paid warm tribute to the statesmanship<br />
of the leaders of the United States and the People's<br />
Republic of China. Both President Carter and Chairman<br />
Hua Kuo-feng and their governments had been determined<br />
to overcome the difficult problems that had stood in the<br />
way of the normalisation of diplomatic relations.<br />
This had not been an easy task, involving as it did the<br />
adjustment of the United States relationship with Taiwan.<br />
It was in this area that the second set of interests came<br />
into play, and in relation to that the Prime Minister noted<br />
and shared the concern expressed by President Carter for<br />
the future peace and well-being of the people of Taiwan.<br />
He also noted recent assurances by Chinese leaders including<br />
Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping that China would seek a<br />
peaceful reunification of Taiwan with the mainland and<br />
that Taiwan had a different social and economic system<br />
which would have to be taken into account. Whatever<br />
ultimate solution was achieved over Taiwan it was of<br />
critical importance in the Australian view that it be<br />
reached by peaceful means. 000---</p>
