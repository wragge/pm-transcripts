SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
AT PREMIER CHOU EN-LAIPS BANQUET AT PEKING ON OCTOBER 31, 1973<br />
Prime Minister Whitlam's Speech at Peking Banquet, Peking,<br />
October 31, 1973 ( Nsinhua) Following is the full text of the<br />
speech in reply by Australian Prime Minister Edward Gough Whitlam<br />
at the welcoming banquet given by Premier Chou En-lai here this<br />
evening:<br />
Premier Chou En-lai, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Your Australian guests are immensely impressed by the<br />
splendour and warmth of our reception at the airport, along the<br />
boulevard and in the Great Hall of the People.<br />
The days of our staying here two years and three months<br />
ago we will never forget, our reception on that occasion and now<br />
on this. Australia is moving in a new direction, in its relationships<br />
with the world and specifically with the region in which Australia<br />
inevitably belongs. The course that we are setting is already clear<br />
and committed. Our concern is no longer exclusively with nations in<br />
far removed areas of the globe. Now, our concern is with all nations<br />
and particularly those with whom we share a common environment and<br />
common interests and with whom we seek relationships of equality.<br />
In Peking today, we give expression to our new international outlook0<br />
With no nation is our new aspiration symbolised more than it is with<br />
China, a power not only in our region but in the world0 We look to<br />
a future in which over-emphasis on particular associations will no<br />
longer distort the proper relationships which should exist between<br />
Australia and all neighbours0 In our view, this meeting in Peking<br />
contributes significantly towards that future0<br />
China is our close neighbour0 In China today we see a great<br />
modernising force, capable of exerting profound influence in the<br />
world. Close co-operation and association between our two peoples is<br />
both natural and beneficial0 This co-operation this association<br />
will be strengthened by our talks this week in Peking the first<br />
such talks ever between Prime Ministers of China and Australia.<br />
In 1971 a small pa~ rty and I visited China before the first<br />
visit of Dr0 Henry Kissinger only a week before and on this<br />
occasion, I understand, we are visiting China only two weeks before<br />
him. At that time, on behalf of the Australian people, I said that<br />
should I become Prime Minister we would establish diplomatic relations<br />
with China and that I would visit China in my first year of office0<br />
The first promise we fulfilled within three weeks of gaining office.<br />
The second at the ready invitation of Premier Chou En-lai, I am<br />
fulfilling now. Thank you, sir, for your invitation0 For myself<br />
and for those who accompany me, we hope that we may have many opportunities<br />
to return the generosity and hospitality that you and the<br />
Chinese people have offered to us0 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I wanted to make this visit in my first year of office as a<br />
demonstration of the significance attached by the Australian people<br />
to developing relations with China, and in the belief that our two<br />
countries should now work in concert for the mutual benefit of the<br />
welfare and security of our two peoples.<br />
In China's approach to relations with other countries, we<br />
find a welcome emphasis on the principles of the equality of states<br />
and respect for the r ights and views of small and middle powers0<br />
At a time when profound changes are taking place in the patterns<br />
of international relations, it is particularly important that the<br />
role of small and medium powers should be understood and appreciated,<br />
and that they should seize the opportunities for greater independence<br />
which the increased fluidity of the world situation presents to them.<br />
In this context, China's support for the principles of respect for the<br />
national sovereignity, independence and territorial integrity of all<br />
states can make a significant contribution to strengthening peace.<br />
These fundamental principles we support and as we work together for<br />
their implementation, our two countries will be drawn into closer<br />
co-operation. We hope and expect that our two countries, in a<br />
relationship of mutual trust, will work increasingly together to<br />
secure respect for these broad principles in the affairs of the region<br />
which touches both our countries.<br />
Australia shares China's desire for a fully effective<br />
solution to the Vietnamese conflict and China's desire that the Paris<br />
Agreements should be fully implemented by all parties concerned0<br />
Similarly, both countries look forward to the early restoration of<br />
peace in Cambodia0 The Governments of both our countries have welcomed<br />
the agreements reached between the parties concerned in Laos and we<br />
share a desire that the correct implementation of these agreements<br />
will ensure peace in Laos.<br />
We are both concerned that the different social systems<br />
of the countries in the region should nut inhibit the flow of ideas<br />
and that greater consultation and dialogue among these countries may<br />
remove the barriers of misunderstanding and lessen the possibility<br />
of international conflict.<br />
As relations between China and Australia develop, the<br />
continuing importance of expanding trade will be balanced by the<br />
development of close contact over a broad range of political issues.<br />
Consultations on international questions of interest to both countries<br />
are adding substance to our relationship0 Exchanges in the scientific,<br />
technological and cultural fields will expand and buttress ties between<br />
the two countries0 Our relationship will not be exclusive but will have<br />
relevance beyond our purely bilateral concerns. For we believe that<br />
there are great benefits for all in putting aside the rigidities and<br />
animosities of the cold war era and grasping the opportunities<br />
inherent in the more open framework of relationships now developing<br />
in the world, to build a structure of cooperation based on mutual<br />
respect and mutual trust. 00o/ </p>
<p>-3-<br />
In this spirit, ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to join<br />
with me in a toast in honour of Chairman Mao Tsetung, in honour of<br />
acting Chairman of the Republic Tung Pi-wu, in honour of Premier<br />
Chou En-lai in honour of the heads of the Diplomatic Missions and<br />
their wives, in honour of all distinguished guests present, to the<br />
continued happiness and well-being of the Chinese people and to the<br />
friendship between Australia and the People's Republic of China. </p>
