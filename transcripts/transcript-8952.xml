STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. P. J. KEATING,<br />
AND THE TREASURER, THE HON. J. 9. DAWKINS<br />
THE BUDGET<br />
The Government tonight announced key Budget modifications<br />
which meet Caucus concerns and which it believes should<br />
secure passage of the Budget through the Senate.<br />
The changes will address community concerns while<br />
maintaining the Government's overall deficit reduction<br />
sLrategy. The key changes are:<br />
an increase in the rebate for low income earners<br />
from $ 100 to $ 150 each year.<br />
a reduction in the differential between leaded and<br />
unleaded fuel from 5 cents to 2 cents a litre. This<br />
will be achieved by deleting the 3 cent rise in<br />
leaded fuel proposed in the Budget for February<br />
1995. eye tests will continue to be eligible for Medicare<br />
rebates. unused long-service leave lump sum payments accrued<br />
up to August 17, 1993 will continue to attract a<br />
concessional rate of tax. Future long-service leave<br />
lump sum entitlements as well as all unused annual<br />
leave will be taxed as normal income. As announced<br />
in the Budget, existing concessions will remain for<br />
bona fide redundancies, invalidities and approved<br />
early retirement schemes.<br />
In order to off-set the impact of these measures in this<br />
financial year the payment of personal income tax cuts<br />
will be delayed from November I to November 15, thereby<br />
maintaining this yoar's deficit figure at $ 16 billion.<br />
These revisions to the Budget were discussed with<br />
Democrat Leader, Senator Kernot, Green Senators<br />
Chamarette and Margetts and independent Senator<br />
Harradirie.<br />

<p>In addition to the measures above it was agreed with<br />
Senator Kernot that a working party of Government,<br />
Democrat and Green representatives would be established<br />
to examine ways to reduce atmospheric lead pollution.<br />
It was also agreed with Senator Kernot that in order to<br />
reduce the cost of these measures the remaining four<br />
proposed increases of three percentage points on tobacco<br />
excise would be replaced with four increases of five<br />
percentage points.<br />
The combined effect of these measures will mean that the<br />
prospective addition to the deficit for 1996-97 will be<br />
in the order of $ 380 million.<br />
This will see the projected deficit for 1996-97 outlined<br />
in the 1993-94 Budget Papers rise from 1.1 per cent of<br />
GDP' to 1.2 per cent.-<br />
Following this evening's Caucus discussion it has also<br />
been decided to review implementation issues associated<br />
with the 1992/ 93 Budget decision to assess capital gains<br />
and losses on shares for pensioners.<br />
