    <content><![CDATA[<p> The violence employed in demonstrations in both Sydney and Melbourne</p>
<p> today against United States' consulates should be utterly condemned</p>
<p> by all Australians.</p>
<p>Australians of Serbian descent have every right to peacefully demonstrate</p>
<p> against NATO military action directed at the Milosevic regime.</p>
<p>However the violence Â including injury done to police Â</p>
<p> is quite unacceptable.</p>
<p>The NATO action, which the Australian Government supports, became</p>
<p> a regrettable necessity when President Milosevic refused to respect</p>
<p> the rights of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.</p>
<p>NATO's quarrel is not with the Serbian people but with the Milosevic</p>
<p> Government.</p>
<p>Australians of Serbian descent are a respected part of the Australian</p>
<p> community. They have contributed much to our country.</p>
<p>I am sure that the violent behaviour of a few will be strongly condemned.</p>
<p> 28 March 1999</p>
