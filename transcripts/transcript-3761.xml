PRIME MINISTER ON MONDAY CONFERENCE<br />
MONDAY 2 JUNE 1975<br />
THIS PROGRAM WAS RECORDED IN CANBERRA ON<br />
SUNDAY EVENING, 1 JUNE<br />
EMBARGO, 9.30 E. S. T. 2.6.75 Z </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER ON ' MONDAY CONFERENCE'<br />
2 JUNE, 1975<br />
Bob Moore: Very recent public opinion polls have suggested<br />
that your Government and your own popularity are on the down-tpurn<br />
again after being on the up-turn, after being on the down-turn.<br />
Why do you think this is at present? Why the down-turn now?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I don't know. I don't concern myself too much<br />
with these regular polls. The two matters I always have in mind<br />
are these that when there is an election and the voters have to<br />
make a real choice, then they are much more likely to vote for the<br />
Labor Party than for the other parties. There is no use just<br />
protesting against the Labor Government. They will come to see<br />
that we are better than the others, or a sufficient number will.<br />
And the second thing is I think that during an election campaign,<br />
people get for the first time exposure to the positive things that<br />
we are proposing or that we have done.<br />
Bob Moore: In practical terms, what affect has Mr. Fraser<br />
being Leader of the Opposition, made to you as compared with<br />
Mr,. Snedden being Leader?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: The main thing is that the Parliament behaves<br />
better. Mr. Snedden didn't control his followers and didn't<br />
attempt to control the Country Party which just ran amok.<br />
Mr. Fraser has done a much better job in that respect. I don't<br />
know how important conduct in Parliament is, outside. I don't<br />
know this. I thought that Mr. Fraser would be much less responsive<br />
to whatever was the latest newspaper story. He is more, as.<br />
Mr. Snedden always was. I think Mr. Fraser is falling into that<br />
error of getting absorbed in just temporary issues instead of. looking<br />
at the long-term objectives. But I think his big trouble,<br />
compared with Mr. Snedden, is that he has never had to work for<br />
a living. Mr. Snedden always did and Mr. Snedden had lived<br />
where most people in Australia live. Mr. Fraser never has.<br />
Alan Ramsay: And yet, Prime Minister, you once said, not so<br />
long'ago that you thought Malcolm Fraser had-. been born to lead<br />
the Liberal Party.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I think that would be his view and the people<br />
who put him there, would have had that view too.<br />
Bob Moore: In general terms, do you agree with Mr. Fraser's<br />
proposition that barring exceptional circumstances, a party that<br />
has a majority in the Lower-House should normally expect to run<br />
its three year term.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: 0f course I do. I think Mr. Snedden's great<br />
error was to allow the Country Party to overwhelm him on that<br />
issue a year ago when he had a premature election. It was against<br />
principle. it was the wrong thing to do and finally, he was the </p>
<p>one who suffered.<br />
Creighton Burns: How much easier would life be for you, Prime<br />
Minister, how much more effective do you feel your Government<br />
would be if you had a smaller Cabinet than the 27 you have now?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I have told the Cabinet, I've told the Caucus,<br />
the our Government would be twice as good if it were half the<br />
size.<br />
Creighton Burns: Told them recently?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: About a month or so ago. Of course that's<br />
obviously the case. You've got to face the fact that we inherited<br />
an act of Parliament which says there are 27 Ministers. It's<br />
an extraordinary form of self denial for any Party to reduce such<br />
a benefit 27 people are bound to be* Ministers. What about Fraser,<br />
of course, now, is a Shadow Cabinet of over<br />
Alan Ramsay: Did you give the Caucus any reasons why you<br />
thought life would be much easier if in fact the Ministry was<br />
half the size.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I forget what context it came up in.<br />
Alan Ramsay: Are you likely, in fact, having said this, that<br />
we are qoing to see something in the near future whereby the<br />
Ministry right be smaller?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: There is quite a lot of discussion in the Party<br />
along these lines, but mind you I think the way in which it could<br />
come up, is to have a Cabinet and then Ministers outside the Cabinet.<br />
I think that's a possibility. / 2A </p>
<p>Creighton Burns: You've never really, for any sustained period<br />
had what would be called a ' kitchen Cabinet' have you?<br />
I mean in the period before the last Budget when there was a<br />
small group of Ministers around you and you were really<br />
operating in an informal Cabinet system in a sense. But<br />
that didn't last for long. Is this a tactic, is this a<br />
possible system?<br />
Mr Whitlam: There are several matters which come before a<br />
group of 5 or 6 Ministers, that's true, which don't go to<br />
t Ministry as a whole.<br />
Bob Moore: You've said that you are in favour or that you<br />
prefer the idea of the Cabinet being elected by members of<br />
the Parliamentary Party, compared with the Prime Minister<br />
appointment. But leaving that aside in general, are there any<br />
details of the procedure by which Ministers are elected by<br />
Caucus that you would like to see changed. / 3 </p>
<p>Mr. rhitlam: These are all technicalities.<br />
Bob Moore: There's nothing substantial?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Nothing substantial. I strongly believe, as<br />
I always have believed, that it makes for greatest cohesion and<br />
harmony in a Parliamentary Party, to have the Party as a whole,<br />
elect its Ministers. Where you have a Prime Minister appointing<br />
Ministers, you immediately have the people who aren't Ministers<br />
blaming, not the Party as a whole, but blaming the Prime Minister<br />
1nd those that the Prime Minister has appointed take it for granted.<br />
4iiey think that their virtues are self-evident.<br />
Alan Ramsay: There is some support in your Party though that<br />
possibly a compromise could be reached between a wholly elected<br />
Ministry and possibly the Leader of the Party, choosing, say,<br />
twelve and Caucus electing the rest. Would you support this?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: No, Iviuld-still think that who are to be the twelve,<br />
the Cabinet, should be decided as we decide who are to be the<br />
Ministers as a whole, namely, at a secret ballot. I wouldn't<br />
want the burden of choosing which are the best twelve Ministers.<br />
I would want to know who the Party thought were the twelve best.<br />
Alan Ramsay: Yes, but I don't mean electing the twelve best.<br />
In other words, the Leader having the right to choose twelve<br />
members of the Ministry as a whole.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I don't seek that. Those that were not in the<br />
twelve, who were in the rest of the other 15, they would blame<br />
me for being left in the second 11. I would rather the Parliamentary<br />
Party, as a whole, take that responsibility.<br />
Alan Ramsay: Would you accept then that the fact that your<br />
Caucus elects the entire Ministry breaks down the principle of<br />
Cabinet solidarity?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: It does to a certain extent, yes. But it has<br />
the virtue that was so obviously lacking in the McMahon and the<br />
Gorton Governments, where people who were not Ministers, or people<br />
who were Ministers and not in Cabinet, blamed their plight on the<br />
Prime Minister. I don't think that that makes for harmony or<br />
cohesion in the Government Party. I support the fact that the<br />
Ministry and any Cabinet within the Ministry, should be chosen<br />
at a secret ballot by all the members of the Parliamentary Party.<br />
Alan Ramsay: Would you prefer that the Cabinet of 27 or 12,<br />
or whatever in fact it might be, who having arrived at a decision<br />
then be-bound by that decision within the Caucus or do you go<br />
along with the concept as it happens now, that Ministers go around if 4 </p>
<p>they oppose a decision in Cabinet?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Some do. But I don't want you to think that<br />
most do that. Most do not. The practice we have reached is<br />
this where after the Cabinet has made a decision, any member<br />
of the Cabinet feels so strongly about it that he wants to<br />
oppose it in the full Parliamentary Party, the Caucus, then he<br />
should tell his colleagues in the Cabinet, that that is his<br />
intention.<br />
Alan Ramsay: Do they do that?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Yes they do. Most do. There have been a few<br />
people who have not, who have been underhand but only a few.<br />
Alan Ramsay: And you go along with this?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I think that's the way it works. I can see<br />
the argument that it's unfair that a person who feels very strongly<br />
on a matter, should be silenced and not only silenced but should<br />
be dragooned into voting for a Cabinet decision in the Party as a<br />
whole, which he thinks is wrong.<br />
Alan Ramsay: You have got a committee of the Caucus in fact<br />
looking at your Caucus standing orders.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: There has been for some months.<br />
Alan Ramsay: And they in fact will come up with some<br />
recommendations on this very question of the election of Ministers.<br />
I don't know what they are going to be.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I expect so, that's their charter'to come up with<br />
such prbposal's to simplify the'election. The' trouble is that up<br />
till now we've had three stages for electing the 27. One of the<br />
suggestions it is one that I would support is. that the whole<br />
Ministry should be elected on the one ballot. It is more likely<br />
to produce the choice of the Parliamentary Party as a whole. What<br />
we have at the'mombnt means that those'that don't get in the first<br />
two-ballots you know the Ministers all join forces to get the<br />
remaining positions available on the third ballot.<br />
Alan Ramsay: Would you expect this review to come up with<br />
the support of the principle of an inner Cabinet of 12 or 14?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I don't know. I'm not sure what their thinking. is<br />
on that. </p>
<p>Bob Moore: Last week, Dr. Coombs, in addressing a Public<br />
Servce socation in Melbourne, suggested that mnaybe the*<br />
convention ought to be changed in accord with Labor Party practice.<br />
What he was saying was, that under a Labor Government, Caucus'<br />
has, at times, such a powerful policy role, maybe Caucus should<br />
have the kind of access to Public Service advice that only<br />
Cabinet has under the convention. Do you see any merit in this<br />
suggestion?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Public Servants can, and constantly do, speak<br />
to Caucus committees. That's always been the possibility or<br />
the practice and, in fact, they speak to Opposition co. mmittees.<br />
Any member of the Opposition or any of the opposition commrittees<br />
that want, to speak to particular Public Servants or people from.<br />
particular Government instrumentalities, such as the airlines or<br />
the banks, or anything like that, only have to ask and we arrange<br />
for people to go along to talk to them. And the same happens, of<br />
course, in the Government committee meetings. But it is quite, I<br />
suggest, erroneous to think that the Caucus or Caucus committees<br />
can be policy-making things. They are too leisurely and too<br />
incohate in their composition and procedures to do that. Of<br />
course, the Cabinet makes the proposals. That is the case with<br />
any Executive. Sometimes the Cabinet's views don't prevail but<br />
that's very rarely. Obviously you can't have a Government run<br />
by so large a body as 90 or 100 people such as you have in the<br />
Parliamentary Labor Party. Policy matters, initiatives, are<br />
taken, after all, by individual Ministers usually, and principally<br />
by the Prim-e Minister.<br />
Alan Ramsay: The Caucus does, in fact, have the overriding<br />
authority to say yes or no to a decision?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Of course it does. Under our practice, ever<br />
since there has been Labor Party representatives in Australian<br />
Parliaments, the people who will be voting in the Parliament<br />
decide, collectively, how they will vote on any-proposition coming<br />
up in the Parliamrient.<br />
Alan Ramsay: You don't think Caucus has too much power?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: No, that's reasonable enough, after all. When<br />
the public vote for a Labor member of Parliament, they know that<br />
he Will participate in deciding at meetings of the Parliamentary<br />
Party, how1-he will vote in the Parliament. They know that he<br />
will have as much opportunity as any other Labor member of<br />
Parliament to decide how the Party will vote and he will abide<br />
by majority decision of the Party on that question, how he'll<br />
vote. That's always been the practice. It's what all the<br />
parties do but as in so many things, the Labor Party pioneered it. </p>
<p>Bob Moore: In the* debate over the $ 2,000 inillion or*<br />
$ 4,000 million loan, do you feel that the* Government was let<br />
down by the Treasury?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Be more specific.<br />
Bob Moore: Were you not told things that you should have<br />
been told and were other people told things whi'ch they should<br />
not have been told, in your view?<br />
: 1r. Whitlan: I should have been told one particular -matter,<br />
that's all, one particular matter, but I don't think that the<br />
person who raised that, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition,*<br />
Mr. Lynch, was told very much, because obviously his allegations,<br />
it turned out, were without foundation. Mr. Lynch is very free<br />
in what he says. He said on one of the A. B. C. programmes that<br />
he suspected that there had been no meeting of the Executive<br />
Council. of course there was. That was his first allegation.<br />
The second allegation was, that the intermediary, to use his<br />
term, had a criminal record and that Scotland Yard has reported<br />
on him. A couple of days later, he said that there was a report<br />
from Scotland Yard in typewritten form on Treasury files. I<br />
hadn't heard of this so I called in the Secretary and he told<br />
me~ that there had been an oral inquiry from Scotland Yard and the<br />
response was that there was nothing detrimental known about the<br />
intermediary. I wasn't told but after all, there was nothing<br />
to tell me, was there? Lynch was obviously astray.<br />
Alan Ramsay: It mus-t have embarrassed you that Mr. Lynch,<br />
in fact, knew more about this business than you did from your<br />
own Government people?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Well he obviously didn't. He had fabricated it.<br />
Alan Ramsav: Are you saying he fabricated it or the people<br />
who gave it to him fabricated it?<br />
Mr". Whitlam: If anybody gave it to him, they misled him, or<br />
he fabricated it. The fact was that there was nothing in typewritten<br />
form from Scotland Yard on Treasury files. treasury<br />
had made an oral inquiry from Scotland Yard and Scotland Yard<br />
didn't say there was a criminal record and they made no report on<br />
it. They said they knew nothing detrimental to him. This is a<br />
very reckless, and irresponsible, improper thing for Mr. Lynch<br />
to say. obviously, he didn't get the information from Treasury<br />
which he used in the allegation he made in a question without notice.<br />
Alan R~ amsay: You are quite certain that none of this information<br />
that he got, whether he built on it or fabricated it or otherwise,<br />
came from the Treasury? </p>
<p>Mr. Whitlam: I don't know. It seems funny that the word<br />
Scotland Yard occurred. It may be somebody in the Treasury<br />
let the word Scotland Yard drop in Mr. Lynch's hearing, but<br />
obviously there was no basis for what Mr. Lynch alleged, that<br />
the man had a criminal record, or that there was a Scotland Yard<br />
report in typewritten form about him.<br />
Aklan Ramsay: Are you trying to find out that in fact anybody<br />
in Treasury did give this, or any information, to Mr. Lynch or<br />
the Opposition?<br />
Mr. Whitlun: No, of course I'm not trying to. I don't assume<br />
that anybody in Treasury did. Quite obviously, anything thfat<br />
came from Treasury would not have justified what Mr. Lynch alleged.<br />
Creighton Burns: Apart from the petrodollar affair, have you<br />
any other reason, Prime Minister, to feel that you and your<br />
Government haven't been properly and loyally served by Treasury<br />
or any other Department?<br />
Mr. Whitlan: No. Let me say this. The only criticism I<br />
would maka is that when this question by Mr. Lynch, using the<br />
words Scotland Yard, came up last Monday, I'm sure somebody in<br />
Treasury woul d have had the penny drop. They'd watch what's<br />
going on In Parliament, I daresay some of them listen, but they<br />
certainly would have read Hansard the next day. In those circumstances,<br />
they should have come clean and told me what there was.<br />
Whan it was used on t-he Wednesday, then I inquired and, as it<br />
turned out, there w,, as nothing that they should have told me at all.<br />
I think th.&amp; y should have -told me, after the question on Monday<br />
when the w, o rd Scotland Yard As used, they should have told me<br />
' well in fact tL-here was an oral inquiry and it turned up negative'.<br />
Creighton Burns: In other areas, do you feel that you received<br />
the co-operation and support from the Public Service which you<br />
areenitled to?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Yes. The Federal Public Service is an extraordinarily<br />
capable body. It's true that I think the Treasury, and<br />
the Reserve Bank for that matter, have erred-in economic advice, but<br />
after all, the Government might have made mistakes there too. Maybe<br />
you say that the Treasury and the Reserve Bank should be more expert,<br />
they have had longer experience and they shouldn't have erred.<br />
Alan Ramsay: That's the first time I've ever heard you admit<br />
that the Government might have made some mistakes, on the economy.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Well we haven't spoken enough. Of course we<br />
have made mistakes, but everybody's working, these days in<br />
developed countries, in an extraordinarily difficult economic<br />
climate. Everywhere in Western Europe and in North America,<br />
Japan and Australasia, you have this extraordinary economic<br />
situation. Each of us suffers it and it's the worst </p>
<p>economic situation that any of us has suffered for 45 years.<br />
I don't want the viewers to get any impression that I'm making<br />
any general criticism of the advice. But quite clearly, the<br />
advice that we received from the Reserve Bank and the Treasury<br />
in September 1973 about the credit squeeze, was belated and the,<br />
advice continued and the credit squeeze was allowed to continue<br />
too long. It ought to have been brought on three months or more<br />
earlier and should have been ended three months or more earlier.<br />
Secondly, it was quite clear that the advice we received from<br />
Treasury last August about the deflationary measures, was.<br />
misconceived. But those were two cases where I think, one must<br />
admit, the advice was wrong. I've made the general criticism and<br />
we have taken steps, to correct the situation, there are more<br />
. lcvant and prompt statistics made available to -the gov. ernment.<br />
Bob Moore: What are the mistakes that you have made, you sAd<br />
that the government had made some mistakes?<br />
Mr Whitlam: You don't expect me to go into that.<br />
Creighton Burns: Do you think one of the reasons for your<br />
present economic problems and some of the Government's present<br />
difficulties is your insistence on maintaining your promise not to<br />
increase tax-es in your first year, to try and finance reforms out<br />
of national growth? That while this may have been an admirable<br />
insistence in keeping your electoral word, that there may well<br />
be occasions in the national interest when a Prime Minister or<br />
a political leader at any level will have to break his word<br />
simply to achieve a given objective. So with hindsight,<br />
do you still stick by your decision not to increase...<br />
Mir Whitlam: This is almost two years old. This goes back to<br />
the Budget of August 19.73. You may be right, but at that time<br />
the advice was both ways. It's quite wrong to say that all the<br />
advice was to increase taxes. That was not the advice from<br />
everybody it was from some people. I don't like going against<br />
things that I've promised at elections and I'm very intent, if<br />
it's at all possible, doing things that I have promised at<br />
elections. AfIter all, this was the one instance really, where<br />
there was discussion in the Party before the 1972 election<br />
and there was discussion-whether, in the policy speech, I should<br />
make a reference that we would not put up taxes or not. I<br />
assembled the opinion and the opinion was that we should say<br />
they would not go up. Now, having sampled the opinion and<br />
having expressed that undertaking, I would have been very<br />
reluctant to go back on it. We have gone back on some things to<br />
the extent we had to defer the timetable. Our present deficit<br />
is due to the fact that we have reduced taxes so much, and everybody<br />
said that to reduce taxes, personal and company, as we did last'.<br />
November, was necessary to refiate the economy.<br />
Creighton Burns: Do you think that with hindsight that the<br />
across the boara tariff cut might have been ilijudged That<br />
it might have been better to have been selective about / 8A </p>
<p>8A<br />
Mr Whitlam: No I do not. I think that was correct and<br />
I'm glad that I have some Ministers who are now talking<br />
up staunchly for the fact that Australia's resources<br />
are best used if we don't raise still further the tariff<br />
wall around us. We are a trading country. It's true<br />
you get people working in industries, employers / 9 </p>
<p>employees, owners, getting together to put pressure on Government<br />
and we have to yield to some of that pressure in some areas where,<br />
obviously, there was an unacceptable amount of unemployment, but<br />
I welcome the opportunity to say that the interests of a great'<br />
majority of Australians in this generation, as well as future<br />
generations, will be best served by having a smaller tariff<br />
barrier than Australia has had. We just are not serving ourselves<br />
properly. We aren't using our resources and we are putting up<br />
our prices<br />
Bob Moore: Do you agree with what Senator Jim McClelland<br />
. s saying<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Utterly, completely he is a very effective<br />
Minister, one of the most effective Ministers I have, publicly<br />
and privately.<br />
Alan Ramsay: You are satisfied that there are not some<br />
sections of the Public Service who are actively trying to<br />
undermine your Government by passing on information to the<br />
Opposition? Mr. Whitlam: No, I don't think they do. There are obviously<br />
Alan Ramsay; There have been some damaging disclosures of late<br />
on this.<br />
M Whitlam: That always goes on but it doesn't happen at that level<br />
wich which I and my colleagues see the Public Service. Obviously<br />
there must be a lot of people who see things and gabble around,<br />
but, no, I don't want to support any allegation that you make<br />
that the Public Service is not a loyal one. The Public Service,<br />
true, at its upper levels most of them have got their positions<br />
during 23 years of Liberal/ Country Party rule so it would be true<br />
to say tha. they are conservative in general approach and secondly,<br />
that they are not used to national initiatives. They grew up,<br />
they got their positions in circumstances where the theory was<br />
ch that's -1 -ratter best left to the States. Nobody ever thought of local<br />
government, but that's a State matter. Of course, that's where<br />
the deterioration in our society, to a certain extent, our economy,<br />
came about. So, it's true they wouldn't be innovatory. Some of<br />
them wouldn't show as many initiatives, but it's not true to say<br />
that they would be disloyal. Any Australian Government would be<br />
superbly served by the Federal Public Service.<br />
Bob Moore: are talking with you in a climate of suggestions<br />
or speculations about a possible spill of Cabinet. Would you like<br />
to see that happen?<br />
I-Ir. Wihitlam:. I don't think there will be one. </p>
<p>Alan Ramsay: Would you support these soundings that were<br />
made last week by some members of your...?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I don't initiate any<br />
Alan Ramsay: No, I'm not saying you do. I'm just saying<br />
do you support the soundings or did you support or do you support<br />
now, the soundings that were made to see whether or not there<br />
could be one?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Well I suppose I ought to give a candid answer<br />
to you a general attitude. If a new Ministry were being elected<br />
now, there would be some changes. quite obviously in the 2 years<br />
since the present Ministry was elected -there have only been two<br />
new Ministers in that time, Senator Wheeldon and Senator James<br />
McClelland who you mentioned, Mr. Moore, both magnificent additions<br />
to the Ministry but in the 2 years since the rest of us were<br />
elected, clearly the people would have come to realise that there<br />
would be some people on the backbenches who would be more effective<br />
than some who are on the frontbench. After the next election, when<br />
there has to be an election, I would expect there to be a few<br />
changes in the Ministry.<br />
Alan Ramsay: And you wouldn't expect something to happen<br />
before the next election...<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I don't think so, but mind you, I'm relaxed<br />
about these sort of things. For instance, if a move were made<br />
for a spill, I would support it because I think it is clear that<br />
once the ice is broken, once the people have tempted fate the<br />
first tine, they would do it a second time. You remember all the<br />
to-do last November or December, whenever it was, when there was<br />
a move for a spill in the Liberal Party and all the effort was<br />
put into beating the move for a spill. If Mr. Snedden at that<br />
time had said right, let's have it, I'll support it he would<br />
have been re-elected then, he might still be there now, but it<br />
happened the first time and it failed. The next time someone<br />
imoed it, it was carried although he opposed it, then he stood<br />
and was beaten. So, my general philosophy is, if there's any<br />
move for a spill, it's best to get it over with. I put my own<br />
job on the line too, I think I would survive.<br />
Alan Ramsay: But you are not initiating one?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Certainly not. I am happy to work, and I want<br />
everybody else to realise, that I'm happy to work loyally with<br />
whoever is elected by the Party and I want all of them to realise<br />
that.<br />
Alan Ramsay: If there was a move by somebody else that you<br />
would support? </p>
<p>Mr Whitlam; I think in those circumstances, onc would have to.<br />
I woulir! It say it would be carried but: 1 wouldn't want-anyhofdy<br />
to be in any doubt as to my atti-tuueethat if anybocly Felt so'<br />
stronglyt a bou L tEhLe matter, that they thought th., ere ought to hea<br />
an election for the Ministry as a whole, again, I vnuldn't<br />
want to give any impression that I was frightened of the outcome<br />
or that any Minislers should be frighten! e d of the outcome~.<br />
Al~ an R-am:; ay: Why does Mr Barnard want to retire from politics?<br />
Mr Tlhittam: lie has stated, and this has been knowledge for -come<br />
time , that he will not be standing at the next election.<br />
Alan Ramsay: Why does he want to go now?<br />
Mr WhitlaM: Well does he? I'm not going to feed this<br />
sneculaticn. I don't respond to speculation like this. Hie<br />
r~ an'tbeen offered anything.<br />
Alan IRars_, y: W'ell nobo~ dy had. denied it and least of all<br />
Darnard.<br />
1-r Vvnitla: r.: 1' don't respond...<br />
A lan Ramsay: Do you think Mr Barnard has been happy or unhappy<br />
i~ n the Government since he lost the Deputy Lead-ership a year ago?<br />
Mr-1 Whit lam: Yes, you wouldn't get a more loyal, industrious<br />
serene character. I 1have known him for 21 years, last Thursday,<br />
when he was elected to Parliament but if you look at the<br />
l1egislation and the ad ministrative arrangements lie has made since he<br />
was supers~ e as Deputy Laader, 10 or 11 months ago. It's<br />
hb: en a -na-rnificert record -all th-e new procurem-ient programs,<br />
Lh~ new legislation and prospecti1ve legislat-on. Lance Barnard<br />
has been the most effective ad,' ministrator that ouir defence force<br />
ha s had in anyone's memory.<br />
Alan R~ amsay: Ha-ving said you won't feed' speculation, would<br />
you like to kill it by saying he doesn't want to go now?<br />
11r Whitlam: No. I won't. I said he hasn't been offered ainything.<br />
I should know.<br />
Alan Ramsay: Certainly, Prime Minister, All I'm asking you is<br />
ha hie asked you for something? / 11A </p>
<p>11A<br />
Mr Whitlam: No certainly not, I'll answer that forthwith.<br />
If I respond to this one of the papers today said that<br />
another Minister was expecting an appointment if I<br />
answer questions like this, we'll go right through the<br />
Ministry. Alan Ramsay: Do you regret that he lost the Deputy Leadership<br />
a year ago? </p>
<p>12<br />
Mr Whitlam: I'm not going to answer questions like that.<br />
You know I supported him. I accepted the decision, he<br />
accepted the decision.<br />
Alan Ramsay: I would'suggest, Prime Minister, that he has<br />
been quite unhappy since.<br />
MIr Whitlam: He hasn't been. You asked me that and I denied<br />
it already.<br />
Creighton Burns: You said a moment ago, that sometimes<br />
circumstances force the deferment or even the default of<br />
promises. Mr Whitlam: I don't think there's been a default in any,<br />
but there have been a few deferments, there has to be.<br />
Creighton Burns: You.' re surely now facing a situation which<br />
might becc-me a very real problem because most economists seem to<br />
think that we're looking at a very substantial budget deficit<br />
ir. the next financial year and there have been strong representations<br />
tlhit there will have to be some substantial reductions in<br />
Government expenditure. Under these circumstances, do you think<br />
it still makes go. od sense to go ahead with the abolition of the<br />
nir. ns test? There is $ 230 million or so at stake in that,<br />
. roney which will, in many cases, go to people who already have<br />
satisfactory standards of living, as a subsidy maybe not for the<br />
rich, but for the comfortable. In other areas of policy your<br />
Government have rejected that as a principle, in education<br />
for example, category schools, that the young. rich don't<br />
get the benefit but the old rich do. What is the sense in<br />
pushing ahead with a program which will perhaps force cuts in<br />
other critical areas of social expenditure?<br />
Mr Whitlaz: This may be deferred but it will not be<br />
abandoned. I'm far too committed to this to tolerate an<br />
abandonment of that. It's been spun out, as you know. For<br />
instance, I said in the ' 72 elections, that everybody of<br />
or over, would be getting the full pension, that is without means<br />
test, by the end of that Parliament. That would bring us to the<br />
Lnd of this year. Well, it won't be in force by the end of this<br />
year, but let's look at this. In the middle . of last year, twelve<br />
m: onths ago bar five days, I think it was, at the Premier's<br />
conference then, I said that we would in fact, be deferring<br />
some of the means test abolition, and there was a huge outcry<br />
that I'd betraved promises. Let's face up to this. If we were<br />
to abandon that, the people who would be criticising us would<br />
be the Liberal and Country Party people in the Parliament<br />
who are always asking us to cut expenditure. So it may be spun out,<br />
but I would expect by the time that the next House of Representatives<br />
election is cue, that is mid ' 77, that the means test will be<br />
abolishedas I said it would be, by the end of ' 75. That is, it<br />
will have been deferred by 50 per cent. </p>
<p>Creighton Burns: Even if this in the meantime involves<br />
imposition of some additional cuts in other expenditure which you...<br />
M~ r Whitlam: Well, this is an undertaking on which quite a<br />
number of poeple have now been banking. A lot of people have<br />
now ordered their affairs in reliance on our undertakings and<br />
we have honoured all our undertakings of this character and<br />
I won't be in deferring it. Mind you, we know perfectly<br />
well that it's not on politically to do it because our<br />
opponents wouldn't say that they would defer it. So it' one<br />
of those things that's all right for you chaps in a television<br />
stcudio to suggest that this would be the responsible course.<br />
But we have to live in the kitchen, we have to live with<br />
these things and we couldn't survive with it. And of course<br />
I suppose politically nothing would suit us better than for<br />
our opponents to say that they would abandon it or defer it.<br />
They won't, we won't. It will come about.<br />
Creighton Burns: That last year, the 65 to 70 group, would be<br />
deferred or possibly spread over another two years?<br />
Mr Whitlan: That would be right, yes.<br />
Bob Moore: Why do you think it is that the private sector<br />
or large parts of it, feel that your Government is so unsympathetic<br />
to themtiat after all they feel that Dr Cairns, particularly<br />
in recent months,.....<br />
M~ r Whitlam: I don't think it is true to say that the private<br />
sector is aginst us. It is true that some sectors of the<br />
private sector are against us and are vocal. I notice Mr Fraser<br />
was stirring them up to protest against the Government, to abuse<br />
the Government, to denounce the Government. The fact is<br />
that you just don't get any top people in business in the<br />
private sector, you don't get Managing Directors or Chairmen<br />
of Directorcs of big companies or responsible institutions<br />
attacking my Government. You don'tjand the relations we have between~<br />
us are quite civil, quite respectful~ and we acknowledge,<br />
gratefully, the fact that there are a very great number of people,<br />
top people in business, who have been willing to give up their<br />
time to head or to serve on, committees or commissions which<br />
advise us. And they know that if they advise my Government<br />
their advice will be made publ~ ic and it will certainly be<br />
seriously considered. We couldn't have done many of the things<br />
which we have initiated, but for the advice of leading people<br />
in the private sector. They had expertise; it wd. s not available<br />
to Governments; my Government sought it, and is making use of it.<br />
Bob Moore: BIo ba1m-brseu: rprised to hear you say that. there aren't </p>
<p>some top people, Managing Directors, who aren't critical of the<br />
Government. I can't swap names with you?<br />
Mr Whitlam: 1ell, I suppose the insurance people are doing<br />
it at the moment.<br />
Bob Moore: Isn't a fairly common complaint among business<br />
people that they are worried about the lack of certainty of the<br />
Government's plans...?<br />
Mr Whitlam: You mentioned the 25% tariff cut. It's true,<br />
I suppose that we have been roundly abused, betrayed one<br />
might say, by some of the American motorcar companies in<br />
Australia. That's true. And I suppose some of the textile<br />
people have abused us a bit although they're not abusing us<br />
that much now.<br />
Alan Ramsay: Betrayed, did you say betrayed?<br />
Mr Whitlam: Yes, well we very fully consulted them and they<br />
ap.. ded. hat we did and a month later they abused us. This<br />
is getting a few months back now, this is November and<br />
December you will remember.<br />
Creighton Durns: One of the criticisms that is made, it may<br />
not be made to you or face to face with members of your<br />
Government, one of the criticisms is that curiously that<br />
while there is much talk of planning in the Labor Government<br />
there is not nearly enough planning to satisfy the problems<br />
the businessmen have in doing their own planning. They say that<br />
this criticism comes sometimes from within the ranks of your own<br />
Government. One of your newly appointed Ministers recently<br />
said that he thought there was as much ad hocry in this Government<br />
as there hd been in previous Governments. Do you think there is a<br />
problem about planning?<br />
Mr Whitlam: I can't remember which Minister this was. This<br />
might have been in, say, some of the protection field. It might<br />
have been Jim McClelland. We have had to yield a bit to some<br />
ad hoc pressure, that's true. I've gone along with it. Jim<br />
McClelland has said, quite rightly, that this assistance that we<br />
have given through the Tasmanian Government to APPM at Burnie<br />
now that's the principal employer at Burnie he has said that<br />
if they close down, it's just the same as if Burnie was struck<br />
by cyclone Tracy. That's true. You can't by any normal standards,<br />
justify what we did there, but it's perfectly open and the<br />
Opposition is not going to defeat it. They can. They ./ ouldn't<br />
bring down the Government, if they did it, but there's no chance<br />
of them defeating it. There's a lot of nonsense spoken on it. ./ 14A </p>
<p>1 4A<br />
I didn't lile doing it but i L ws an open thing and it is<br />
somet-t., jj bnaped on what was done by our predecessors, you<br />
refllCimbe 1, for the canning indu-try in Shepparton. The act is'<br />
exactiy th same. People aren't used to it being done so<br />
overtly for secondary industrias. </p>
<p>Creighton Burns: The point that is made though is not simply<br />
relating to issues like APPM. The criticism is a general one<br />
that the Government's general priorities are not as clear as<br />
they might be and that industries and firms cannot plan ahead,<br />
particularly in this present economic climate with the confidence<br />
which they feel that could in the past.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Well, let's take the Industries Assistance<br />
Commission which replaced the Tariff Board a much more expert<br />
body than the old Tariff Board and their's is a much more efficient<br />
body; I think it will be. When it comes to the private sector<br />
there's a limit to what the Federal Government can do, but if<br />
look at our submissions to the Arbitration Commission, to<br />
the Prices Justification Tribunal, the establishment of the<br />
Industries Assistance Commission, the way we are going about<br />
those matters which concern the private sector, we are much<br />
more efficient and open and making it possible to have overall<br />
planning than was the case before. There are other things which<br />
will take longer to come into play, such as the Trade Practices<br />
Commission, because this can be very complicated. All the other<br />
countries we mentioned, North America and Western Europe have<br />
long had this and we haven't yet had it in Australia. This is the<br />
sort of planning they have in mixed economies and it's the sort we<br />
will have too. What the Government ought to be doing mostly in a<br />
mixed economy is planning the public sector and we have done that<br />
better, more thoroughly, More forthrightly, than any previous<br />
national Government.<br />
Craighton Burns: A third of the public sector affects the States,<br />
about a third of the public expenditure goes to the States.<br />
Mr. ihitlam: That would be about right.<br />
Creighton Burns: And, of course, this problem is going to come<br />
Up again in two weeks for the Premiers' Conference.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Yes.<br />
Crcighton Burns: The growth in Government expenditure has been,<br />
I think, faster in the States than in the national area.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Yes, right. It's been at least 50 per cent more<br />
in the States than it has in the Federal. You get a terrific<br />
amount stated about the growth in the Public Service. The Federal<br />
Public Service in the last 12 months has grown by 3 per cent. The<br />
State Public Services have grown in that 12 months by about twice<br />
that.<br />
Creighton Burns: What I want to raise about this, Prime Minister,<br />
is that if there are going to be constraints on spending there<br />
will have to be constrains on the State spending as well as<br />
Mr. Whitlam: As well as Federal, yes. </p>
<p>Creighton Burns: Do you feel th e mTachinery for agreeing on<br />
these constr-ain Cs, is adeciuate<br />
MTrh. i tarn: No, ift's niot.<br />
Creighton Burns: Do you believe that Section 96 which I think<br />
Sir Robert menzies really pioneered but which your Government<br />
has used very rigorously, some would say brutally, in so-me cases<br />
Mr.-Whitlami: We used it deliberately.<br />
Creighton Burns: Is -this an adeqiuate instrument of Commonwealth/ State<br />
or Centrzil/ State?<br />
Mr. Whitlan: It is the only instrument that has been, so far,<br />
available. I would Very much like to have bet-ter coordination.<br />
Let's take something which everybody acknowledges is principally<br />
a public responsibility, a responsibility of the State and Federal<br />
Governments transnort. I would he very happy to discuss with<br />
the States, say, what amount, %, hat pro-portion of total public<br />
funds ought to be spent on transport. Previous Governments have<br />
al;;,-av\ s saida n~ ow look we'll look after civil aviation, don't you<br />
States oworrv about tEhat. And Che St-ates have always said now<br />
look the railways are: ours, don't yoau Federal people come into this.<br />
~ a result. you've got a very gre. dislocation there. Take the<br />
roads. Sopmewhere a!--cut 40 per cent of the total money spent on<br />
rad s Australia CcTmes i h form of an: outright grant, not a<br />
lc-n n teres, no repayments, an ol: tright grant by the Federal<br />
Govcramn-, nt. A---nd yet our roads are atrocious. The fact that you<br />
can' u go under economic conditions between Sydney and Melbourne<br />
is a scandal. I w.. ould be very happy if we could have a five year<br />
plan, Federal and State, saying . whiat proportion of the national<br />
product should be spent on transpor-t and what proportions on each<br />
form of transport.<br />
Creighton Biirns: 1. Woulid you be happy also to let S3tate admninistrat ions<br />
haca bigger say in the deItail of expenditure and not be<br />
s uhbj rc t to0 Su _ h1<br />
Mr. W., hitlam: Yes, I think we ought to pool our knowledge<br />
hare. This is a field where, I sup-pose, everybodywoul acknowledge.<br />
th-at Governments have pr-me responsibility and we ought to have<br />
~ o~ consultatlion on It's no skin off my nose if the Sae<br />
ci:' press views as to airports and aircraift. By the Salle token,<br />
it's reasiona; ble enough -that w e should have something -to say, about<br />
SCA1y, interstate2 roads or the principal railways or in facrt urban<br />
transport. I give you that inst-ance and I don-' t mnind extending<br />
that -to the delivery of health servi. ces and so on.<br />
Alan Ramnsay: Why do you think it is that Prime Minister Lee<br />

Ltire-4t y copipmonweath utblic Service uniLons to organise against<br />
tiv-. Oope ition, because of th Opposition's stand on thle Super-<br />
: anua tion Bill? </p>
<p>Mr. Whitlam: No, I think it's counter-productive if any<br />
particular interest group looks as if it is bringing too heavy<br />
a pressure to bear on a political party. I don't seek that<br />
sort of pressure and I think it can be counter-productive.<br />
I don't mind if the Public Servants vote against the Liberal<br />
Party, but I don't want them to organise campaigns like that<br />
I know, for instance, the way the Labor Party suffers from<br />
many gratuitous campaigns in the trade unions.<br />
Bob Moore: I don't know whether you've read the piece now' celebrated,<br />
I suppose in the last couple of weeks by Paul Johnson<br />
in the New Statesman on Unionism and Socialism.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Yes.<br />
Bob Moore: Do you accept all or any part of his thesis?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: The trade unions, after all, are part of the<br />
capitalist system, aren't they?<br />
Bob Moore: He certainly argues that.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Of course they are.<br />
Bob Mo! ore: In practical terms, as a Labor Prime Minister<br />
Mr. ' hitlam: A Labor Government does much more to bring about<br />
social democracy than the trade unions can. Trade unions just<br />
interact with employers. That is a transitional stage of society<br />
when the people who want to bring about social democracy do so<br />
through having a Labor Government.<br />
Moore: But he says more than that, he says unionists<br />
are inimical to socialism.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: You don't expect me to go that far do you?<br />
Bob Moore: Well I'd like to hear you<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Why don't you put that sort of view yourself. That's<br />
what always intrigues me about you interviewers in Australia.<br />
People in the B. B. C. always put, with all the confidence and<br />
aggression of which they are capable, and that is a lot, they put<br />
their own viws. In Australia, you always like to hide behind<br />
sormebody else's Do you agree with what Mr. Snedden says?-that's<br />
what it used to be. Do you agree with what Mr. Fraser says?<br />
that's what it is presumably this month and the next few months. </p>
<p>19.<br />
Do you agreei '. 74tjj what Lee xuan Yew says? Do you agree with<br />
what Paul Joh -son says? Haven't you views of your own?<br />
Bob M oore Wou. ld you be happy with interviewers who<br />
consistently took a line that was opposite to yours?<br />
1-r. Whitla: I'd be just as happy as those w,, ho then quote<br />
some colleague or some opponent or some correspondent, an~ d * then<br />
uDut that forward as a view7 which they want me to conlend<br />
It ' s not much use me arguing with Paul Johnson or Lee Kuan Yew.<br />
,. en tChey are F. few ' thousand miles away.<br />
Creighton Burns: One of your collaagues thinks the press has<br />
been unfair to your Government. Another one of your colleagues<br />
th. inks it. has been as fair to your Government as to any other<br />
G c) v e r e n I thinvk it has been remarkably fair to your GovernmentC..<br />
V-1hat do You thin!<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I think where it's been critical of us, it's<br />
been half our responsibility. I think the Melbourne ' Age' has<br />
gcone frar tzoo far In some ways. I'll admit, as I did. earlier,<br />
Ltweve made-m istak-is but you w -ould never get a newspaper<br />
to ac-mit. thrat it has riade a mistake.<br />

Mr. Winitlain: Yes, th1-at I think is one little mote in your eye<br />
every day and the beamns of course<br />
Creighton Burns: Symbolic of our mTod esty, Prime Minister.<br />
That hadn't occurred as the explanation tome.<br />
.1an Rmsay: There was the debate in Parliament in February,<br />
initiatedL1 by M~ r. Wentworth, about Dr. Cairns' staff. Dr. Cairns<br />
in defending his right1C to appoint to his staff,<br />
made a statement in which he said ' I have road a long statement<br />
by the Co-mion-wealth Police and an offence which points to the<br />
iiivolieent of a numvber of members of this House in thlat conspiracy<br />
to e , L 11s morosi Is home illegally.' I<br />
H-as any police action been taken about this conspiracy by mer1nl-) errs<br />
of-the Parliament i11 an illegal act?<br />
tMr. Whitlam: T ' fbrgdt all. t he details here. My memory is<br />
that there was a case in -the courts in Sydney, where the people<br />
who had, burgled 11iss Morosi's flat pleaded guilty and they were<br />
associated with the Liberal Party.<br />
llhitlza: i: </p>
<p>But your Treasurer ( inaudible)<br />
Mr. Whitlam: As you say, it's a few months ago and not<br />
even Mr. Wentworth has come back with these allegations. You<br />
don't seriously expect me to argue with Mr. Wentworth on a<br />
programme of this quality.<br />
Alan Ramsay: I'm not arguing, I'm just asking you, what has<br />
been done about thi., when a senior member of your Cabinet says<br />
a police report says that there has been conspiracy by mem. ers<br />
of Parliament?<br />
. Mr. Whitlam: My memory is that the people involved pleaded<br />
guilty. I'm right aren't I'<br />
Bob Moore: I think you are.<br />
Alan Ramsay: That's got nothing to do with this particular<br />
-oint.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I think it did.<br />
Alan Ramsay: NO Members of Parliament appeared in court. If<br />
there's a conspiracy by members of the Parliament to carry out an<br />
illegal....? Mr. Whitlam: Look, i really don't remember the details.<br />
You must take Mr. Uentworth more seriously than I do.<br />
Alan Ramsay: No, I'm not quoting Mr Wentworth, I'm quoting<br />
Dr Cairns, your Treasurer. He says this.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I don't remember the details. I must confess<br />
I r. ever thought that this would be raised on this programme. If<br />
I had I suppose I would have gone to the labour of pursuing the<br />
matter. Bob Moore: It seems, in the past few days anyway, that<br />
Mr. Somare is having rather more trouble than one would have<br />
thought in organising independence day and independence and all<br />
that. Are you happy with the way things are going in Papua New<br />
Guinea now? And, secondly, is there anything which would cause<br />
the Australian Government to insist on, and would it be able to,<br />
a particular day for independence?<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Obviously we can give Papua New Guinea independence<br />
in the juristic sense when we want to. After all, we have in<br />
practice, in fact, given Papua New Guinea, complete independence.<br />
Alan Ramsv: </p>
<p>21.<br />
Pa-pua ewCiainsr now visit other countries Indonesia,<br />
China, Jl pcu:, in their o-. un ri ht. 11--obviously, 1h lve to malke<br />
the aaneu-sbut Oco nt accompany them on thut Thay just<br />
ro. oceed 3. n their ow,. n -way. Secondly, they now have control of<br />
their own armed -forces. The only situation that is left is for<br />
thcr. to have international recognition as an indep:! naert country<br />
and tha-t wo, uld. be given whenever we ask the United Nations to<br />
do so. I would be optimistic -that, in fact, Papua New., Guinea will,<br />
itself, seekc independence this year. I think 1H-r. Somare's setbaclks<br />
in -the Conistitue. nt Assembly as the House of Asserublv is n1ow<br />
called, have: been on procedural matters, not on matters of substance.<br />
He is a superb parliJamentarian, he is a superb politician and I<br />
think that his leadership in the country will bevindicated yet<br />
again. it's only about four years ago, at the beginning of 1970,<br />
-that he and I were being tagged by the Australian and Papua New<br />
Guinea Security services throughout Papua New Guinea. And now<br />
wfn are leaders of our respective countries.<br />
Bob ' Iloore: I don't quite know w hat the moral of that is<br />

think. Bob Moore: Thz-ink Yo11 very much . Prime M~ inister for talking to<br />
