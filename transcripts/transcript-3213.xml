PRESS RELEASE NO. 22<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam today released the text of his<br />
correspondence with the Governor-General, Sir Paul Hasluck,<br />
about the dissolution of the Twenty-Eighth Parliament on ThursdaZy.<br />
Mr. Whitlam's letter to Sir Paul of April 10 road:<br />
" I write, further to our discussions, to advise you that a situait. c<br />
has arisen between the Senate and the House of Representatives<br />
not only provides the conditions precedent to the exercise of th.<br />
dissolution power vested by the Constitution in the Governo: r-Gen:<br />
but also represents an unprecedented interference in the processes<br />
of popular and democratic government through the. denial by the Se<br />
to a Government elected in December 1972 the money it needs to cairr y<br />
out its program.<br />
In the view of the Government the situation now can be resolved o::,. ly<br />
by a double dissolution of Parliament in accordance with the<br />
provisions of Section 57 of the Constitution and an appeal to the.<br />
electors of Australia.<br />
The purpose of this letter, therefore, is to recommend that'you<br />
exercise the power of the Governor-General under Section 57 and<br />
dissolve simultaneously the Senate and the House of Representatives.<br />
I now set out the grounds on which I make that recomruendation<br />
The provisions of the Constitution for a double dissolution are sctout<br />
in the first paragraph of Section 57 which reads<br />
" 57. If the House of Representatives'passes any proposed<br />
law, and the Senate rejects or fails to pass it, or passes<br />
it with amendments to which the House of Representatives<br />
will not agree, and if after an interval of three months<br />
the House of Representatives, in the same or the next<br />
session, again passes the proposed law with or without any..<br />
amendments which have been made, suggested or agreed to by<br />
the Senate, and the Senate rejects or fails to pass it, or<br />
passes it with amendments to which the House of Representat" ive'<br />
will not agree, the Governor-General may dissolve the Senate<br />
and the House of Representatives simultaneously. But such<br />
dissolution shall not take place within six months before the<br />
date of the expiry of the House of Representatives by efflu::-':"<br />
of time." </p>
<p>I submit that the record of the Senate since the Labor Government<br />
took office in December 1972 is such that all the conditions<br />
justifying a double dissolution have been established progressively<br />
over a period of time.<br />
In recent months the Senate has twice rejected, failed to pass<br />
. or unacceptably amended several proposed laws which are integral<br />
parts of the Government's program ofreform and development,<br />
endorsed by a majority of electors on 2 Decem.; ber 1972.<br />
The manner in which the Senate has dealt with these proposals<br />
brings them directly within the provisions of Section 57 and<br />
your power to dissolve both Houses.<br />
The bills which brought these proposals before the Parliament are:<br />
Commonwealth Electoral Bill ( No. 2) 1973<br />
Senate ( Representation of Territories) Bill 1973<br />
Representation Bill 1973<br />
Health Insurance Commission Bill 1973<br />
0 Health Insurance Bill 1973<br />
Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill 1973<br />
The first three bills listed above provide for electoral reform,<br />
an objective to which the Government is deeply committed, and which<br />
it is pursuing also with the proposed referendum on democratic<br />
elections. The Australian Labor Party's Platform on Constitutional matters<br />
makes this clear. It proposes amendment to the Constitution:<br />
" to ensure that the House of Representatives and each<br />
State House of Parliament is composed of members<br />
directly elected from electorates in each of which<br />
the number of people is as nearly as practicable the<br />
same."<br />
The Platform also contains a plank to the effect that:<br />
" The Northern Territory and the Australian Capital<br />
Territory be represented by Senators with full voting<br />
rights."<br />
It is against this background that the three electoral bills were<br />
introduced last year.<br />
The Commonwealth Electoral Bill ( No. 1973 seeks to ensure that<br />
electorates are more equal in population, and therefore more<br />
democratic, by varying the permitted difference in enrolment from<br />
the existing one-fifth to one-tenth. This is a matter that was<br />
before the Parliament in 1971 when my colleague the Hon. F. M. Daly<br />
introduced a private member's bill entitled " Commonwealth Electoral<br />
Act 1971" on 1 April 1971. The then Government did not allow the<br />
bill to proceed. S. 3/ </p>
<p>The Senate ( Representation of Territories) Bill 1973 seeks to<br />
Sestablish for the people of the Australian Capital Territory and<br />
the Northern Territory the right, long-held by their fellow<br />
citizens in the States, to representation in the Senate. The<br />
proposal is that each Territory should have two Senators with<br />
full voting rights.<br />
The Representation Bill 1973 is a companion bill to the Senate.<br />
( Representation of Territories) Bill 1973. It seeks to-amend the<br />
Representation Act to exclude Territory Senators from the formula<br />
for determining the number of members of the House of Represent. ativos<br />
to represent the States.<br />
These three bills have all twice failed to pass the Senate. Their<br />
progress in the Parliament is su! oj. arised below and set out in I<br />
detail at Attachment<br />
Commonwealth Electoral Bill 2) 1973<br />
passed by the House of Representatives on 4 April 1973<br />
refused a second reading by the Senate on 17 May 1973<br />
passed by the House of Representatives for the second<br />

. I il( I'<br />
time on 27 September 1973<br />
refused a second reading by the Senate for the second<br />
time on 14 November 1973.<br />
I submit to Your Excellency that the way in which these three.<br />
proposed laws have been dealt with by the Houses passed by the<br />
House of Representatives, failed to pass the Senate, again passed<br />
by the House of Representatives after an interval of three months<br />
in the same session and again failed to pass the Senate undoubtedly<br />
bring them within the provisions of Section 57 of the Constitution.<br />
Accordingly, a situation now exists in which Your Excellency has..<br />
Power to dissolve the Senate and the House of Representatives<br />
sinultaneously.. .4/ </p>
<p>4k~<br />
The two Health bills I have listed were treated in the sane-<br />
The Health Insurance Commission Bill 1973 proposes the estabiJ. h t<br />
of a statutory authority to plan and develop an orgonisationi t<br />
administer the Government's health insurance program.<br />
The Iiealth-Insurance Bill 1973 provides for payments for n. edical<br />
benefits, hospital and other specific services.<br />
These bills are designed to implement proposals contained in<br />
Chapter XI of the Platform of the Australian Labor Party and<br />
outlined in my election policy speech on 13 November 1972.<br />
Their progress in the Parliament is summarised below; and set out<br />
in detail at Attachment''<br />
Heauth Insurance Commission Bill 1973<br />
passed by Che House of Representatives on 11 December 1973<br />
refused a second reading by the Senate on 13 December 1973<br />
passed by the House of Representatives for the second time<br />
on 4 April 1974<br />
refused a second reading by the Senate for ' the second time<br />
on 10 April 1974.<br />
Health Insurance Bill 1973<br />
passed by the House of Representatives on 11 December 1973<br />
unacceptably amended by the Senate on 12 December 1973<br />
passed by the House of Representatives for the second time<br />
on 4 April 1974<br />
refused a second reading by the Senate on 10 April 1974.<br />
Heare again, a situation now exists in which Your Excellency has<br />
power to dissolve the Senate and the House of Representatives<br />
simultaneously. The Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill 1973 to which I have<br />
already referred also comes within the provisions of Section 57.<br />
This bill seeks to empower the Authority to explore and develop<br />
petroleum and mineral resources and assist in advancing the<br />
Government's policy of promoting Australian ownership and controlof<br />
our natural resources and resource industries. The creation of<br />
an authority to achieve these purposes is foreshadowed in Chapter:..<br />
VIII of the Platform.<br />
Its progress in the Parliament is summarised below and<br />
detail at Attachment set out in' r<br />
5/ </p>
<p>Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bi3. 1973<br />
pissed by the House of Representatives on 12 December 1973<br />
failed to pass the Senate on 13 December 1973<br />
refused a second reading by the Senate on 2 April 1974<br />
passed by. the House of Representatives for the second time<br />
on S April 1974<br />
refused a second reading by the Senate for the second time<br />
on 10 April 1974 by means of an amendment ( Attachment<br />
which in effect would defer the Bill for a period of 6 months.<br />
These six proposed laws are all of importance to the Govenri. ment,<br />
and on this basis I submit to Your Excellency that the<br />
constitulional requirements for a double dissolution of Parliament<br />
have been met.<br />
wish, -in addition, to draw to your attention further evidence to<br />
. shiow that the Senate has delayed and obstructed the program on the<br />
Sb asis of which the Government was elected to office in December<br />
1972.<br />
. Of 254 bills put before the Parliament in the first session of the<br />
twenty-eighth Parliament, twenty-one-have been rejected, s" tcod<br />
aside or deferred by the Senate. Most of these embodied proposals<br />
considerable importance and, in many cases, were put forward in<br />
fulfilment of the Party Platform and of promises made to the electcrs<br />
" in. my policy speech.<br />
In addition to those bills which I have already identified as<br />
,' providing a basis for a double dissolution, I set out in Attachment<br />
a. summary of the handling in the two Houses of other measures<br />
S: which have in one way or another been the subject of unreasonable<br />
Siobstruction in the Senate.<br />
. I.. summarise the main features of these measures below:<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Bill 1973<br />
This bill is a significant attempt to transform industrial<br />
relations in Australia and to ensure that policies and<br />
procedures for handling labour relations were suitable for<br />
tSh e current situation. The Government's objectives were<br />
set down in-my policy speech.<br />
i Compensation ( Commonwealth Employees) Bill 1973<br />
' The purpose of this bill is to provide for improvements<br />
in the legislation governing workers' compensation for<br />
employees of the Australian Government and its authorities.<br />
It accords with the Platform of the Australian Labor Party.<br />
Superior Court of Australia Bill 1973<br />
This bill would establish a new Federal Court, an institution<br />
S first mooted by a previous Government more than a decade ago<br />
Sand referred to in both your speech opening the Parliament on<br />
S 27F ebruary 1973 and in Her Majesty's Speech on 28 February<br />
S1974. It was foreshadowed in my policy speech.<br />
S:. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
In this connection I bring to Your Excellency's attention<br />
the words of the then Attorney-General in the House of<br />
Representatives when introducing the Commonwealth Superior<br />
Court Bill 196 on 21 November 1968<br />
Si " This Bill is the first step in putting into effect the<br />
proposal, outlined by me in the House last year, to set<br />
up a new Federal court, to be called the Corm;. ronwealth<br />
Superior Court. Complementary ' legislation for the<br />
Samendment of a number of Acts will also be necessary and<br />
S will be introduced at a later time. The project is not<br />
new. Since 1961, a very considerable amount of work ! h. as<br />
been done, first by Sir Garfield Barwick as Attorney-General.<br />
then by the present Minister for Immigration ( Mr. Snedden)<br />
when. he was Attorney-General, and more recently by myself,<br />
. on proposals for the establishment of a new court to relieve<br />
i and forestall the pressures of the existing arrangements for<br />
the exercise of the Federal jurisdiction. I pay tribute<br />
Shere to the foundation work done by my predecessors. ou this<br />
S. project."<br />
Trade Practices Bill 1973 ( No. 2)<br />
This bill proposes improved control of restrictive trade<br />
practices and monopolies and protection of consumers. The<br />
proposal was foreshadowed in my policy speech and in Chapter<br />
V of the. Platform of the Australian Labor Party.<br />
Constitution Alteration ( Inter-change of Powers) Bill 1974<br />
' This bill is intended to facilitate an interchange of powers<br />
between the Australian and State Governments as discussed and<br />
agreed in principle with five of six heads of State Parliament<br />
delegations to the Australian Constitutional Convention in<br />
September 1973.<br />
S The Australian Industry Development Corporation Bill 1973<br />
.,. This bill would allow the Corporation access to increased<br />
funds with the objectives outlined in my election policy and<br />
the Platform of the Australian Labor Party; Chapter VIII.<br />
It would facilitate our policy objective of increasing the<br />
pp roportion of Australian ownership in important national<br />
i ndustries.<br />
National Investment Fund Bill 1973<br />
This bill proposes establishment of a fund to be administered<br />
by the Australian Industry Development Corporation which will<br />
, provide the means of financing the new functions of the<br />
Corporation.<br />
'.. Two other measures which have been obstructed by the ' Senate are:<br />
Lands Acquisition ( Australian Capital Territory) Bill. 1973<br />
Seas and Submerged Lands ( Royalty on Minerals) Bill 1973 </p>

. Appropriation Bill ( No. 3) 1973-74<br />
Appropriation Bill ( No. 4) 1973-74<br />
Appropriation Bill ( No. 5) 1973-74<br />
( For details of consideration by the House of Rpeet~ ie<br />
and the Senate see Attachment<br />
Briefly, the effects of the Opposition's decisions are that f~~<br />
for the payment of salaries ( Appropriation Bill ( No. 3)<br />
will be exhausted by the end of this month and that fund. r--for c~ c-rit.: in<br />
capital works, payments to or for the State~ s and other p~~<br />
including some elements of pensions anid like pay'ments, l<br />
-to run short as early as the end of this month ( Appronprx t o a i312<br />
( No. 4) 1973-74 and Appropriation Bill ( No. 5) ( 1973-74)<br />
Appropriation Bill ( No. 3) was introduced into the Ihouse of<br />
jRepresentatives by the Treasurer on 12 March 1974. The second<br />
reading speech was delivered that day and debate tookr place on<br />
19 March 1974. No indication was given by the Opposition parties;<br />
that.. they would reject it in the Senate.<br />
3 Appropriation Bill ( No. 4) 1973-74 and Appriation Bill ( No.<br />
1973-74 were introduced into the House of Representativcs by the<br />
Treasurer on 2 April 1974 and the second reading speech wa s<br />
delivered on that day. When debate was resumed on 4 April 197,',<br />
the Leader of the Oinosition, the Rt. Hion. 3.1-1. Sneciden, indical: cdl<br />
that the Bills would be opposed in both the H-ouse of Representatives-0<br />
and the Senate.<br />
lie went on to say that if the Bills failed to pass both Houses<br />
there must be a dissolution of the House of Representatives.<br />
( House of Representatives Hansard, page 1048). Hle continued<br />
" Then we w,. ould make appropriate arrangements for the<br />
moneys to be made available after the Prime M1-inister has<br />
announced a dissolution of this House..." ( Hansard, page<br />
J-U~ q) </p>
<p>.1<br />
I I draw to Your Excellency's attention my response on. b.. i: f of<br />
the Government to this threat<br />
" If the Senate rejects any money bill the first time<br />
the Senate would have rejected a money bill in thi<br />
history of our nation I shall certainly wait upon thl.-<br />
Governor-General and I shall advise the Governor-Gn--o al<br />
not merely to dissolve the House of Representative-:;, but<br />
to dissolve the Senate as well.", ( Hansard, page 1.054).<br />
SI took this course to impress upon the Parliament the ' seri'cu. ne<br />
of the actions the Opposition were proposing.<br />
They were not only without precedent, but in my view they go tothe<br />
very lheart of the operation of our Parliamentary ssyste of<br />
government. It is, I suggest, unthinkable that the Upper Hous e comprc: ing<br />
SSenators elected six and a half and three and a half yci.::: s ago<br />
Sshould seek, in respect of bills coming within the scope of<br />
o Section 53 of the Constitution ( text attached), to impose its<br />
will . on the Lower Icus. e, a House elected only sixteen months ago<br />
and in which the Government, composing the majority, has not beer.<br />
defeated in a division.<br />
This afternoon Appropriation Bills Nos. 3, 4 and 5 were brought<br />
on together in the Senate. The Opposition moved, that the, debate<br />
be adjourned. When the Minister in charge of the bills ., moved<br />
that debate be resumed at a later hour this day, the Leader of<br />
the Opposition in the Senate moved an amendment . that the debte<br />
should not be resumed " before the Government agrees to submit<br />
*-itself to the judgement of the people at the same time as the<br />
forthcoming Senate election". This ammedment was supported in.<br />
the Senate by the Leaders of the Australian Country Party and the<br />
' Australian Democratic Labor Party.<br />
The Leader of the Government in the Senate then. stated<br />
is clear that the Opposition is again, by this<br />
' ridiculous and hypocritical device, endeavouring to<br />
avoid voting on the measure itself.... To put an end<br />
to it, I tell you that I intend to move that the question<br />
be put, and if that question is not carried if it is<br />
defeated"-the Government will treat that as a denial of''<br />
supply.<br />
The motion that the question be put was lost Ayes 26 Noes 31..:<br />
I must, therefore, advise Your Excellency that the Senate has by.<br />
its attitude brought about a position where the normal operations<br />
of government cannot continue.<br />
I would expect, however, that appropriate arrangements could be<br />
concluded with the Opposition parties following a decision by you<br />
on dissolution of the Parliament. 9/ </p>

electors. Only in this way can the obstruction of the Senate in the fgac e of<br />
the reform policies of my Gover-nment be dealt with.*<br />
In my letter of M--arch I proposed that there be an election for<br />
half of the Senate on 18 Mlay 1974. Your E;., tellcmcy agrccod with-<br />
. thatL course and asked State Governors to take the necessary. st1eps.<br />

This will avoid the further possible indonvenicnce to electors of ' a<br />
later election, will permit the referendum proposals to be Put as<br />
already detZEermined, and will of course result in the savin'g of<br />
conside'rable public expoaznse..<br />
Your Excellency will recall that the power of double dissolutioñ<br />
under Section 57 of the Costitution has been exercised on two<br />
previous occasions leading to elections on 5 September .1914 ayjd. t<br />
28 April 1951.<br />
In 1914 the -Ehen Prime Minister ( Mr. Joseph Cooh) was wor-; king witLb<br />
an evenly divided House of Representatives and a Senate ' in which<br />
the Opposition parties were in clear majority..<br />
The grounds of his approach were basically that the Govornment wa s<br />
unable to function because the Parliament had beco-1' e unworkable,<br />
particularly through obstruction in the Senate. The Governor-GenerLal<br />
accepted the point that a dissolution of the House only might well<br />
* not resolve the political situation and that, a situation under.<br />
Section 57. of the Constit-ution being in existence, a dissolution<br />
Of both Houses should be ordered.<br />
In 1951, the Prime Minister ( Mr. R. G. M. enzies) advised the Governor-<br />
General that there was one Bill the Commr~ onwealth BanK Bill-<br />
* which represented an important part of the Government's policy, and<br />
had been rejected by the Senate in such a way as to bring Section 51<br />
into operation.. </p>
<p>lie mentioned that there had been difficulties with the Senate in<br />
relation to other proposed laws and that this indicated a<br />
continuing conflict between the two Houses. The Governor-General<br />
accepted his advice and granted a dissolution of both Houses.<br />
It is the Government's view that the present circumstances arc<br />
analogous to those in which the earlier dissolutions were granted,<br />
and that the range of obstruction of important policy measures is<br />
probably wider than in 1914 and certainly wider . than in 1951.<br />
On the question whether Section 57 of t ib Constitution is applicable<br />
in respect of more than one proposed I am attaching a joint<br />
opinion by the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General ( Attachment<br />
As Your Excellency will see, their advice is in the<br />
affirmative. I shall be available to Your Excellency fpl discuss these matters<br />
and any other aspects which you would widl\ to examine.<br />
My recommendation to you is, however, I have said, that you<br />
dissolve the Senate and the House of ARc-ptesentatives simultaneously,<br />
with a view to holding elections for both Houses and conducting the<br />
four referendums all on the same day."<br />
The Governor-General's reply of April 11 read!<br />
" I have carefully considered your letter of Apri., 10 and the<br />
supporting documents concerning the situation which has arisen<br />
between the Senate and the House of Representa'tives.<br />
I have also kept in mind our discussions yesterdAy morning and<br />
evening when you called on me at Government House.<br />
It appears to me that the requirements of the firl1 paragraph of<br />
Section 57 of the Constitution in respect of a dodble dissolution<br />
have been satisfied with regard to the folloing proposed laws<br />
Commonwealth Electoral Bill ( No. 2) 1Yi3<br />
Senate ( Representation of Territories). Bill 1973<br />
Representation Bill 1973<br />
Health Insurance Commission Bill 1973<br />
Health Insurance Bill 1973<br />
Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill 1973.<br />
In reaching this view I have accepted the learned Opinion of the<br />
Attorney-General on the requirements for the exercise of the<br />
Governor-General's power under Section 57. and the Joint Opinion of<br />
the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-Geheral on the question<br />
whether Section 57 is applicable to more than one proposed law. 11/ </p>
<p>-11-<br />
As it is clear to me that grounds for granting a double dissolution<br />
are provided by the Parliamentary history of the six Bills listed<br />
above, it is not necessary for me to reach any judgment on the wider<br />
case you have presented that the policies of the Government have<br />
been obstructed by the Senate. It seems to me that this is a matter<br />
for judgment by the electors.<br />
Having received your assurance that adequate provision exists for<br />
the carrying on of the Public Service in all its branches from now:<br />
until the assembly of the new Parliament and that the electoral<br />
machinery is in a condition to allow the holding of an early<br />
election for both the Senate and the House of Representatives, T am<br />
prepared forthwith to dissolve the Senate and House of Representatives<br />
simultaneously under the provisions of Section 57 of the Constitution." </p>
