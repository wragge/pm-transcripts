EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
YOUTH AFFAIRS ASSEMBLY<br />
MELBOURNE 7 FEBRUARY 1986<br />
THIS YOUTH AFFAIRS ASSEMBLY, AND THE GOVERNMENT WHICH I<br />
LEAD, HAVE BEFORE US ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND COMPLEX<br />
TASKS FACING ANY NATION TODAY. AND THAT IS THE CREATION OF<br />
A WORTHWHILE FUTURE FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. IT IS A DAUNTING<br />
AND A DIFFICULT TASK. BUT IT IS ALSO A TASK ON WHICH, I AM<br />
GLAD TO SAY, WE HAVE ALREADY MADE A SOLID START.<br />
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE ATTENDED A YACA MEETING. THE<br />
FIRST TIME I DID SO, IN DECEMBER 1982, I WAS SHADOW MINISTER<br />
FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS. IT IS CERTAINLY A MUCH MORE REWARDING<br />
FEELING TO BE ADDRESSING YOU THIS TIME AS PRIME MINISTER OF<br />
A REJUVENATED NATION ALREADY WITH A BLUE PRINT BEFORE US FOR<br />
TACKLING THE MYRIAD PROBLEMS OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE.<br />
IT IS ALSO GRATIFYING THAT I CAN SPEAK TO YOU AT A TIME WHEN<br />
PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SO<br />
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED ON THOSE WHICH APPLIED AT THE END OF<br />
1982. THAT PERIOD MARKED THE DEPTHS OF THE WORST RECESSION<br />
SINCE THE 1930S. IT WAS CHARACTERISED BY A PARTICULARLY<br />
BLEAK OUTLOOK FOR THE YOUTH OF AUSTRALIA. </p>
<p>IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT THE YOUTH AFFAIRS COUNCIL SHOULD BE<br />
CONDUCTING THIS ASSEMBLY NOW, AT THIS IMPORTANT STAGE IN THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF OUR STRATEGY FOR DEALING WITH THESE PROBLEMS.<br />
I CONGRATULATE YACA ON ITS INITIATIVE. IN THE SIX AND A<br />
HALF YEARS SINCE YACA TOOK ITS PRESENT FORM, IT HAS PROVEN<br />
TO BE AN EFFECTIVE VEHICLE FOR REPRESENTING THE VIEWS OF<br />
YOUNG PEOPLE AND THOSE CONCERNED WITH YOUTH AFFAIRS, AND FOR<br />
CARRYING THEIR VIEWS TO GOVERNMENT.<br />
I HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE QUALITY OF YACA'S WORK OVER THE<br />
PAST THREE YEARS AND WITH THE COMMITMENT OF THE PEOPLE<br />
INVOLVED IN YOUR ACTIVITIES.<br />
I SAID A MOMENT AGO THAT IT IS ESPECIALLY REWARDING TO SPEAK<br />
TO YOU NOW, AT A TIME WHEN THE OUTLOOK FOR YOUNG PEOPLE HAS<br />
IMPROVED MARKEDLY.<br />
THAT IMPROVEMENT PARTLY REFLECTS THE GENERAL IMPROVEMENT IN<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, AND IS<br />
PARTLY BECAUSE OF OUR PRIORITY ONE STRATEGY.<br />
PRIORITY ONE REPRESENTS THE FIRST ATTEMPT BY AN AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS THE MANY ISSUES FACING THE YOUTH OF<br />
THIS COUNTRY IN A CO-ORDINATED AND COMPREHENSIVE MANNER. WE<br />
WANT YOU AND ALL YOUNG AUSTRALIANS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE<br />
REVIEW AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE STRATEGY.<br />
PRIORITY ONE COMPLEMENTS OUR GENERAL ECONOMIC POLICIES WHICH<br />
HAVE PRODUCED RECORD GROWTH IN EMPLOYMENT. IN CONTRAST YOU<br />
HAVE THE INTELLECTUAL BARRENNESS OF THE OPPOSITION'S<br />
APPROACH, BASED LARGELY ON SIMPLY CUTTING YOUNG PEOPLE'S<br />
WAGES. IN THE TWO-YEARS UP TO MAY 1983, YOUTH EMPLOYMENT<br />
FELL BY 143,000. RIGHT NOW, THOUGH, WE SEE STRONG GROWTH IN<br />
EMPLOYMENT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE ENTIRE LABOUR MARKET.<br />
SINCE WE CAME TO OFFICE MORE THAN 540,000 NEW JOBS HAVE BEEN<br />
CREATED WITH OVER 100,000 OF THESE BEING TAKEN UP BY YOUNG<br />
PEOPLE. IN CONTRAST TO 1982, YOUNG AUSTRALIANS NOW HAVE A<br />
FUTURE WITH HOPE AND CONFIDENCE.<br />
OUR PRIORITY ONE PROGRAM IS THE OUTCOME OF THREE YEARS OF<br />
CONCENTRATED WORK BY THE GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE INVOLVED IN<br />
YOUTH AFFAIRS. YACA, IN PARTICULAR, HAS PLAYED AN<br />
INVALUABLE ROLE IN FACILITATING CONSULTATION BETWEEN YOUNG<br />
PEOPLE AND THE GOVERNMENT. THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE<br />
GAINED FROM YACA, TOGETHER WITH STUDIES AND INQUIRIES SUCH<br />
AS THOSE BY THE OECD EXPERT TEAM, ANOP AND THE KIRBY<br />
COMMITTEE, PROVIDED THE BASIS FOR THE PRIORITY ONE STRATEGY.<br />
I OUTLINED ITS MAJOR COMPONENTS IN MY ADDRESS TO THE NATION<br />
ON 18 AUGUST LAST YEAR.<br />
THE SIZE OF THE TASK WHICH WE HAVE BEFORE US IN MEETING THE<br />
NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE CAN BE SEEN BY THE RANGE OF ISSUES<br />
ADDRESSED IN PRIORITY ONE. WHILE THE THREE CENTRAL ELEMENTS<br />
OF THE STRATEGY ARE CONCERNED WITH EDUCATION AND TRAINING,<br />
EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME SUPPORT, OTHER INITIATIVES ARE JUST AS<br />
IMPORTANT. THESE INCLUDE IMPROVING THE CO-ORDINATION AND </p>
<p>PROVISION OF YOUTH SERVICES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL; A<br />
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT TO THE CYSS; BETTER AND MORE PUBLIC<br />
HOUSING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE; A VOLUNTEER COMMUNITY SERVICE<br />
SCHEME; AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SPECIALISED YOUTH CENTRES<br />
WITHIN CES OFFICES.<br />
THROUGH THE YOUTH SERVICES DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, WE WILL BE<br />
FUNDING A NUMBER OF PILOT PROJECTS, INCLUDING INFORMATION<br />
AND REFERRAL SERVICES IN AREAS WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE TEND TO<br />
GATHER, SUCH AS MAJOR SHOPPING CENTRES. WE ARE ALSO LOOKING<br />
AT WAYS TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO SERVICES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN<br />
I SOLATED AREAS.<br />
THE IYY CEP DEVELOPMENT PROJECT HAS FOCUSED ON SPECIFIC<br />
GROUPS OF YOUNG AUSTRALIANS, IN PARTICULAR THOSE IN ISOLATED<br />
AREAS, AS WELL AS YOUNG WOMEN, YOUNG ABORIGINALS, YOUNG<br />
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND YOUNG ETHNIC PEOPLE. THIS<br />
PROJECT RAS SHOWN JUST WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE CAN DO WHEN GIVEN<br />
THE CHANCE. WHILE THE PROJECT ENDS NEXT MONTH, THE NETWORKS<br />
IT ESTABLISHED WILL FLOURISH, AND MANY OF THE PARTICIPANTS<br />
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE SPONSORING ORGANISATIONS.<br />
THE IMPORTANCE THE GOVERNMENT PLACES ON YOUNG PEOPLE IS<br />
DOMONSTRATED BY THE FACT THAT, AT A TIME OF CONSIDERABLE<br />
SPENDING RESTRAINT, OUR GREATEST INCREASE IN EXPENDITURE IS<br />
ON YOUTH POLICIES.<br />
PRIORITY ONE IS OUR LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR AUSTRALIA'S<br />
YOUTH, WITH ITS FULL IMPACT TO BE FELT IN TWO TO THREE<br />
YEARS, WHEN THE MAJOR CHANGES TO THE EXISTING EDUCATION,<br />
TRAINING AND INCOME SUPPORT SYSTEMS TAKE FULL EFFECT.<br />
PRIORITY ONE IS NOT AN OVERNIGHT, ONE DAY WONDER SCHEME. IT<br />
IS A CO-ORDINATED AND INTEGRATED PROGRAM TO TACKLE THE MANY<br />
PROBLEMS WHICH YOUNG PEOPLE FACE, IN WAYS THAT ARE RELEVANT<br />
TO THEM AND WHICH GIVE ALL YOUNG AUSTRALIANS A CHANCE TO<br />
INFLUENCE ITS IMPLEMENTATION.<br />
IT IS ABOUT ENABLING YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE BETTER EQUIPPED SO<br />
THAT THEIR SKILLS AND CAPABILITIES ARE BETTER TAILORED TO<br />
MEET THE DEMANDS OF A RAPIDLY CHANGING WORLD. IN THE<br />
RESULT, NOT ONLY WILL YOUNG PEOPLE BENEFIT, BUT ALL OF<br />
AUSTRALIA WILL BENEFIT FROM A MORE CAPABLE AND SKILFUL<br />
POPULATION. PRIORITY ONE WAS NEVER A PROGRAM WHICH COULD BE IMPLEMENTED<br />
AT THE FLICK OF OUR FINGERS OR WITHOUT THE TEETHING PROBLEMS<br />
WHICH ACCOMPANY ALL NEW GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES, PARTICULARLY<br />
THOSE AS COMPLEX AS THIS VITAL SCHEME.<br />
AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE AUSTRALIAN TRAINEESHIP SCHEME, A<br />
KEY ELEMENT OF PRIORITY ONE AND ONE WHICH HAS RIGHTLY<br />
RECEIVED MUCH ATTENTION. TRAINEESHIPS ARE A BOLD, AND<br />
RADICAL PROGRAM PROVIDING A NEW OPTION FOR THOSE FACING THE<br />
TRANSITION FROM SCHOOL TO WORK.<br />
RECENTLY, THE KNOCKERS AND THE DOUBTERS HAVE EMERGED TO TRY<br />
TO UNDERMINE THIS IMPORTANT SCHEME THAT OFFERS REAL HOPE TO<br />
MANY THOUSANDS OF YOUNG AUSTRALIANS. </p>
<p>SO, IN ANSWER TO THEM LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
TRAINEESHIP SCHEME IS GOING AHEAD AND IT IS DOING SO WITH<br />
THE SUPPORT AND COOPERATION OF MAJOR SECTIONS OF THE TRADE<br />
UNION MOVEMENT AND THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS.<br />
AT THE SAME TIME, THE GOVERNMENT ACCEPTS THAT IT MAY HAVE<br />
SET AN OVER-AMBITIOUS TARGET FOR ITSELF IN AIMING TO CREATE<br />
10,000 TRAINEESHIPS BY JULY OF THIS YEAR.<br />
HOWEVER, WE REMAIN OPTIMISTIC THAT BOTH THIS TARGET AND THE<br />
LONG TERM GOAL OF 75,000 TRAINEESHIPS BY 1988-89 CAN BE<br />
ACHIEVED. BUT IF WE DO FALL SHORT ON THE IMMEDIATE TARGET IT WILL NOT<br />
BE BECAUSE OF LACK OF EFFORT OR COMMITMENT. WE ARE<br />
ESTABLISHING A NEW, HIGH QUALITY SYSTEM OF VOCATIONAL<br />
TRAINING, REQUIRING FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN ATTITUDE TO<br />
TRAINING BY THE COMMUNITY, BY EMPLOYERS, TRADE UNIONS,<br />
GOVERNMENT AND YOUNG PEOPLE THEMSELVES. THAT CANNOT BE DONE<br />
OVERNIGHT AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO SELL YOUNG AUSTRALIANS<br />
SHORT IN A SCRAMBLE TO ARTIFICIALLY MEET OUR TARGETS.<br />
TRAINEESHIPS REMAIN A VITAL INITIATIVE. OUR COMMITMENT TO<br />
THE SCHEME IS TOTAL.<br />
PRIORITY ONE IS A BROAD AND A DYNAMIC PROGRAM. SO IT'S ONLY<br />
NATURAL THAT SOME FINE TUNING MAY BE REQUIRED. THIS IS WHY<br />
I MADE MY COMMITMENT TO CONSULT WITH YOUNG AUSTRALIANS ON<br />
ALL ASPECTS OF THE STRATEGY.<br />
THIS COMMITMENT TO FIND OUT DIRECTLY YOUNG PEOPLE'S CONCERNS<br />
AND IDEAS WAS THE MOTIVATION BEHIND THE NATIONAL YOUTH<br />
PHONE-IN AND THE TALKBACK RADIO PROGRAMS WHICH I<br />
PARTICIPATED IN AT THE END OF LAST YEAR. I SPOKE PERSONALLY<br />
WITH ABOUT 120 YOUNG PEOPLE WHO CALLED IN DURING MY RADIO<br />
PROGRAMS AROUND AUSTRALIA. IN ALL, WE RECEIVED ABOUT 26,000<br />
CALLS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM WITH POSITIVE AND<br />
CONSTRUCTIVE CONTRIBUTIONS TO MAKE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR<br />
POLICIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.<br />
THE PHONE-IN AND THE RADIO PROGRAMS WERE A TREMENDOUSLY<br />
WORTHWHILE EXERCISE.<br />
IT WAS NEVER A MARKET RESEARCH EXERCISE INTENDED PURELY TO<br />
GAUGE PUBLIC OPINION; IT WAS ALWAYS INTENDED TO PROVIDE A<br />
CONDUIT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE INTO GOVERNMENT, TO COMMUNICATE<br />
THEIR INDIVIDUAL FEELINGS AND ESPECIALLY THEIR POSITIVE<br />
IDEAS ABOUT THE VARIOUS ISSUES WHICH CONCERN THEM.<br />
YOUNG PEOPLE MAKE UP A VITAL SECTION OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
COMMUNITY. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN IDEAS AND PERSPECTIVES ON<br />
LIFE AND ON VARIOUS ISSUES. WE WANT THE VIEWS OF YOUNG<br />
AUSTRALIANS TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE MAINSTREAM OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN LIFE. YOUNG PEOPLE REPRESENT OUR FUTURE. THEY<br />
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO INFLUENCE THAT FUTURE AND THEIR OWN<br />
DESTINIES. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE ABOUT. </p>
<p>THE PHONE-IN WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT A GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
UNDERTAKEN DIRECT CONSULTATION WITH A SECTOR OF THE<br />
POPULATION. IT WAS A REMARKABLE EXPERIMENT AND I WAS VERY<br />
IMPRESSED BY THE KEEN RESPONSE FROM AN EXTRAORDINARY RANGE<br />
OF YOUNG AUSTRALIANS.<br />
AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DIRECT PARTICIPATION BY YOUNG<br />
AUSTRALIANS, THE PHONE-IN WAS ALSO A FITTING CULMINATION TO<br />
INTERNATIONAL YOUTH YEAR.<br />
ALTHOUGH I SPOKE WITH ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THESE WHO<br />
CALLED IN, I LEARNT MUCH FROM THEIR IDEAS.<br />
FROM EARLY ANALYSIS OF THE PHONE-IN CALLS SOME MAJOR THEMES<br />
ARE ALREADY APPARENT. SOME SPECIFIC PROPOSALS FOR POLICY<br />
DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION ARE EMERGING. I WANT TO TALK<br />
ABOUT SOME OF THESE THEMES NOW, ALTHOUGH THE OVERALL REPORT<br />
ON THE PHONE-IN, BY THE OFFICE OF YOUTH AFFAIRS WITH IN MY<br />
DEPARTMENT, IS STILL BEING FINALISED.<br />
IN PERHAPS THE MOST BASIC TERMS, THOSE WHO CALLED INTO THE<br />
PHONE-IN WERE SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR IDENTITY AND THE<br />
SEARCH FOR A PLACE IN OUR NATION.<br />
THIS THEME MANIFESTED ITSELF IN SO MANY OF THE ISSUES THEY<br />
RAISED, FROM:<br />
THE SEARCH FOR WORK AND DIGNITY, WHICH REMAINS THE<br />
CENTRAL CONCERN OF YOUNG AUSTRALIANS; TO<br />
THE DESIRE TO GIVE AND BE GIVEN MORE INFORMATION ABOUT<br />
THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL FACETS OF LOCAL AND NATIONAL<br />
LIFE, TO ALLOW THEM TO BETTER TAKE THEIR PART IN OUR<br />
COMMlUNITY; TO<br />
THE VEXING PROBLEMS OF AGE-RELATED RIGHTS AND<br />
PRIVILEGES; THE CONTENT AND PURPOSE OF EDUCATION, AND ACCESS TO IT<br />
AT TERTIARY LEVEL;<br />
THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT;<br />
RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER NATIONS AND CULTURAL GROUPS;<br />
THE USE AND ABUSE OF DRUGS; AND<br />
INCOME SUPPORT AND INDEED THE WHOLE RANGE OF ISSUES<br />
ABOUT WHICH YOU AS YOUNG PEOPLE AND WORKERS WITH YOUNG<br />
PEOPLE KNOW ALL TOO WELL.<br />
ALREADY WE ARE LOOKING SERIOUSLY AT SOME SPECIFIC POLICY<br />
IDEAS ON A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES WHICH EMERGED FROM THE<br />
PHONE-IN. THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE WORKING WITH YACA,<br />
PARTICULARLY, ON WAYS THAT THESE CAN BE DEVELOPED. SOME<br />
IDEAS ARE FOR IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION BY THE GOVERNMENT,<br />
OTHERS CAN BE DEVELOPED OVER TIME BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,<br />
AND ALSO BY THE STATES, COMMUNITY ORGANISATIONS AND THE<br />
PRIVATE SECTOR. </p>
<p>THE INITIAL IDEAS THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING COME TOGETHER<br />
UNDER THE FOLLOWING THEMES. THESE ARE:<br />
FIRSTLY: THE PARTICIPATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT<br />
A LARGE NUMBER OF CALLERS WANTED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT, AND<br />
WANTED YOUTH TO PARTICIPATE MORE DIRECTLY IN THE POLITICAL<br />
PROCESSES IN AUSTRALIA. SUGGESTIONS ALONG THESE LINES TOOK<br />
A NUMBER OF FORMS, AND IDEAS WE ARE LOOKING AT INCLUDE:<br />
A NON-PARTISAN PROGRAM OF VOTER EDUCATION FOR SCHOOLS<br />
COVERING AUSTRALIA'S POLITICAL AND ELECTORAL STRUCTURES;<br />
THE CREATION OF WIDER OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN<br />
SECONDARY EDUCATION TO WITNESS AT FIRST-HAND THE<br />
PARLIAMENTARY AND DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES OF<br />
GOVERNMENT; AND<br />
ESTABLISHING BETTER METHODS FOR INFORMING YOUNG PEOPLE<br />
IN A NON-PARTISAN WAY ABOUT ISSUES SUCH AS FOREIGN<br />
POLICY AND CONSERVATION.<br />
THESE IDEAS ARE BEING PURSUED BECAUSE WE RECOGNISE THAT<br />
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE OF MAKING A FAR GREATER<br />
CONTRIBUTION TO THE AFFAIRS OF THE COUNTRY. THE PROSPECTS<br />
FOR THIS WOULD BE ENHANCED CONSIDERABLY BY A WIDER<br />
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE PROCESSES WORK.<br />
SECONDLY: YOUTH PARTICIPATION IN THE COMMUNITY<br />
ANOTHER STRONG VIEW EXPRESSED THROUGH THE PHONE-IN WAS THAT<br />
YOUNG PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE A FAR MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN THE<br />
COMMUNITY AT LARGE. THERE ARE MANY AGE-RELATED DEMANDS AND<br />
RESTRICTIONS THAT IMPINGE ON YOUNG PEOPLE. WE ARE<br />
CONSIDERING INITIATIVES INCLUDING:<br />
ASKING YACA AND THE INSTITUTE OF FAMILY STUDIES IN<br />
CONJUNCTION WITH THE OFFICE OF YOUTH AFFAIRS, TO<br />
LOOK INTO THE TRANSITIONAL STATUS OF YOUNG PEOPLE,<br />
INCLUDING MATTERS SUCH AS:<br />
THE OFTEN CONTRADICTORY LEGAL RIGHTS AND<br />
RESPONSIBILITIES OF YOUNG PEOPLE;<br />
STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN EDUCATION POLICY<br />
DEVELOPMENT WITHIN SCHOOLS; AND<br />
RECOGNISING THE CONTRIBUTION YOUNG PEOPLE MAKE<br />
TO OUR SOCIETY UNDER A YOUTH ACHIEVER AWARD.<br />
THIRDLY: EMPLOYMENT<br />
IT IS NO SURPRISE TO LEARN THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT<br />
CONCERNS OF YOUNG PEOPLE IS FINDING AND KEEPING A JOB. SOME<br />
OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT WE WILL BE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING<br />
ARE: </p>
<p>EXPANDING EXISTING WORK EXPERIENCE PROGRAMS FOR<br />
SECONDARY STUDENTS, SO MORE YOUNG PEOPLE CAN GAIN<br />
EXPERIENCE IN A WIDER RANGE OF JOBS;<br />
ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL TABLOID NEWS-SHEET CONTAINING<br />
INFORMATION ABOUT JOB VACANCIES IN ALL STATES, WITH<br />
OCCASIONAL ARTICLES PROVIDING INFORMATION AND ADVICE FOR<br />
THE UNEMPLOYED;<br />
ESTABLISHING A TOLL FREE 008 TELEPHONE INFORMATION<br />
SERVICE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN REMOTE<br />
AREAS. IMPORTANTLY, UNDER PRIORITY ONE, THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS NOW TRIALLING<br />
SUCH A SERVICE IN TASMANIA; AND<br />
PROVIDING MORE HELP FOR YOUNG PEOPLE LOOKING FOR WORK,<br />
THROUGH EXPANDING THE NEW CES YOUTH ACCESS CENTRES AND<br />
PROVIDING INCREASED FARES ASSISTANCE FOR UNEMPLOYED<br />
PEOPLE TO ATTEND JOB INTERVIEWS.<br />
I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT YESTERDAY THE FIRST 6 ACCESS<br />
CENTRES WERE LAUNCHED AS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT'S NEW<br />
STRATEGY TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF SERVICES FOR<br />
YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.<br />
FOURTH: PROGRAMS TO COUNTER RACISM<br />
FROM THE PHONE-IN, IT IS APPARENT THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF<br />
YOUNG AUSTRALIANS ARE CONCERNED THAT RACIST ATTITUDES MAR<br />
OUR SOCIETY. SOME IDEAS INCLUDE:<br />
A COKPREHENSIVE NATIONAL EDUCATION CAMPAIGN EMPHASISING<br />
THE BENEFITS TO AUSTRALIA OF A DIVERSE NATIONAL<br />
HERITAGE; REPRESENTATIVES OF ETHNIC GROUPS TALKING TO SCHOOL<br />
GROUPS ABOUT THEMSELVES AND THEIR CULTURE THIS IDEA<br />
CAME DIRECT TO ME ON AIR FROM KATEY IN PERTH; THE IDEA<br />
WOULD BE TO GIVE YOUNG PEOPLE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF<br />
THE HERITAGE AND CULTURE OF ETHNIC GROUPS DIFFERENT FROM<br />
THEIR OWN; AND<br />
RECOGNISING THE BENEFITS OF BILINGUALISM IN APPROPRIATE<br />
AREAS, SUCH AS INDUSTRIAL AWARDS.<br />
FIFTH: DRUG EDUCATION<br />
YOUNG AUSTRALIANS ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE EFFECTS THAT<br />
DRUGS INCLUDING TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL HAVE ON PEOPLE. AND<br />
THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW DRUG EDUCATION IS PRESENTED.<br />
IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE NATIONAL DRUG EDUCATION PROGRAM, WE<br />
ARE LOOKING AT NEW AND MORE EFFECTIVE METHODS.<br />
THERE WAS A FEELING FROM THE PHONE-IN THAT ANTI-DRUG<br />
CAMPAIGNS SHOULD RELATE MORE CLOSELY TO YOUNG PEOPLE,' AND<br />
THAT ONE WAY OF DOING THIS WOULD BE TO BRING YOUNG PEOPLE<br />
INTO CLOSER CONTACT WITH THE EFFECTS OF DRUGS, FOR EXAMPLE </p>
<p>ENABLING THEM TO TALK WITH THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE<br />
HORRORS OF DRUG ADDICTION.<br />
SIXTH: INCOME SUPPORT<br />
THE MESSAGE CAME THROUGH VERY CLEARLY THAT MANY YOUNG PEOPLE<br />
ARE NOT AWARE OF THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WE ARE MAKING TO<br />
INCOME SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. THE COSTS OF<br />
THESE REFORMS WILL RISE TO $ 250 MILLION WHEN FULLY<br />
IMPLEMENTED IN 1988-89.<br />
THE KEY TO OUR INCOME SUPPORT REFORMS IS TO REMOVE THE GAP<br />
BETWEEN EDUCATION ALLOWANCES AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT.<br />
IT WILL REMOVE WHAT HAS BEEN, IN EFFECT, A FINANCIAL PENALTY<br />
FOR YOUNG UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE WHO WISH TO RETURN TO STUDY AND<br />
IT WILL ELIMINATE THE DISINCENTIVE TO STUDY.<br />
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOUNG PEOPLE FULLY UNDERSTAND THE<br />
DETAILS OF THE IMPROVED SYSTEM OF ALLOWANCES SO THAT THEY<br />
CAN BE AWARE OF THEIR FULL ENTITLEMENTS. THIS WILL ASSIST<br />
PLANNING FOR THEIR EDUCATION AND THEIR ENTRY INTO THE LABOUR<br />
MARKET, RATHER THAN HAVING SUCH DECISIONS FORCED UPON THEM<br />
BY FINANCIAL NECESSITY.<br />
WHEN WE BECAME THE GOVERNMENT IN 1983, WE INHERITED A SYSTEM<br />
OF INCOME SUPPORT ARISING OUT OF AD HOC RESPONSES TO<br />
PARTICULAR ISSUES. THERE WAS NO PARTICULAR RATIONALITY OR<br />
INTEGRATION TO THE SYSTEM.<br />
THE CHANGES THAT WE ARE MAKING WILL BE PHASED IN OVER THE<br />
NEXT THREE YEARS. COLLECTIVELY, THEY WILL PRODUCE A MORE<br />
COHERENT AND SIMPLE SYSTEM WITH GREATER COVERAGE, MORE<br />
ADEQUATE LEVELS OF PAYMENT, AND THEY WILL REDUCE OR<br />
ELIMINATE FINANCIAL IMPEDIMENTS TO STUDY FOR THOSE IN NEED.<br />
I HAVE ASKED THOSE DEPARTMENTS WHICH ADMINISTER INCOME<br />
SUPPORT PROVISIONS, PARTICULARLY THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT<br />
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY, TO REDOUBLE THEIR<br />
EFFORTS TO EXPLAIN THE CHANGES TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE WITH WHOM<br />
THEY HAVE CONTACT.<br />
I STATE QUITE CATEGORICALLY THAT NO YOUNG PERSON WILL<br />
RECEIVE LESS MONEY UNDER THE NEW ARRANGEMENTS COMPARED WITH<br />
THE OLD SYSTEM. IN FACT, MANY WILL RECEIVE INCREASED<br />
ALLOWANCES AND A LARGE NUMBER WILL BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR<br />
BENEFITS FOR THE FIRST TIME.<br />
THESE ARE ONLY SOME OF THE IDEAS ARISING FROM THE NATIONAL<br />
YOUTH PHONE-IN. FURTHER WORK WILL BE DONE ON THE GATHERED<br />
MATERIAL TO REFINE AND DEVELOP PRIORITY ONE AND TO BUILD ON<br />
THE INITIATIVES AND PROGRESS MADE DURING IYY.<br />
IN THE YEARS LEADING FROM IYY TO THE BICENTENNIAL THE<br />
YEARS MY MINISTER ASSISTING, JOHN DAWKINS, HAS REFERRED TO<br />
AS 3YY OR THREE YEARS FOR YOUTH WE WANT YOUNG PEOPLE TO<br />
MAINTAIN THEIR ENTHUSIASM FOR WORKING TOWARDS CONSTRUCTIVE<br />
CHANGE IN OUR SOCIETY. CONSEQUENTLY, THE SORTS OF PROJECTS<br />
AND INITIATIVES THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE LOOKING AT MOST<br />
CLOSELY WILL BE THOSE THAT MAXIMIZE THE PARTICIPATION OF<br />
YOUNG PEOPLE AND HAVE RELEVANCE TO THEIR FUTURE. </p>
<p>9.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH YACA BOTH<br />
IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE IDEAS WHICH WERE PUT FORWARD<br />
THROUGH THE PHONE-IN AND IN FURTHER CONSULTATION WITH YOUNG<br />
PEOPLE ON WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING AND ON WHAT IT SHOULD<br />
BE DOING.<br />
WHEN I WAS INVITED TO SPEAK AT THIS ASSEMBLY, I WAS PLEASED<br />
TO NOTE THE BREADTH AND RANGE OF ISSUES TO BE CANVASSED.<br />
IN THIS CONTEXT, I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YACA AFTER<br />
THE ASSEMBLY ABOUT YOUR IDEAS AND VIEWS. THIS WILL HELP ALL<br />
OF US WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE<br />
COUNTRY TO ASSIST THEM IN THE WAYS THEY WANT AND IN THE WAYS<br />
THEY NEED.<br />
I WISH YOU WELL IN YOUR WORK THIS WEEKEND AND IN THE FUTURE.<br />
I AM PLEASED TO DECLARE THE ASSEMBLY OFFICIALLY OPEN. </p>
