Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Minister for Trade and Competitiveness Craig Emerson today warmly welcomed Mexico as a new member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).</p>
<p>The country's inclusion in the negotiations, announced during the G20 Leaders' Summit in Los Cabos, brings the number of parties seeking to conclude a wide-ranging accord on trade and economic integration across the Asia-Pacific region to 10. </p>
<p>Speaking from Los Cabos, the Prime Minister said Mexico was an important partner to have at the table in the development of a modern, comprehensive trade agreement across Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>The TPP parties now around the table account for 27 per cent of global GDP.  </p>
<p>Mexico's addition to the talks today is another step towards APEC's vision of a free trade area of Asia-Pacific.</p>
<p>Minister Emerson said Australia looked forward to working with Mexico on this ambitious project.</p>
<p>The expansion of the TPP group translates into greater opportunities for Australian businesses and farmers to engage with the fastest-growing region on earth.</p>
<p>Mexico's inclusion was agreed by consensus among TPP members and reflects the country's commitment to trade liberalisation. </p>
