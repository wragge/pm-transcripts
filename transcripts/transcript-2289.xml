OPENING OF BHP.' ESSO LONG ISLAND POINT<br />
FACILITIES, VICTORIA 21 SEPTEMBER 1970<br />
S2! eechb~ t he Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Sir Ian, Councillor Mair, and Distinguished Guests:<br />
You, I know, are extending a welcome to me here today to perform this<br />
opening ceremony. And I in my turn would like to say what a privilege 1. feel it<br />
to be to stand on this platform with the representatives of two great conipanies<br />
one Australian, one American which have brought into being that which we see<br />
around us here a-nd which have helped this nation to make another giant stride<br />
forward towards its destiny.<br />
We have Sir Ian McLennan, closely associated with this whole enterprise;<br />
Sir Colin Syme, head of an Australian Company which, from the far Western<br />
frontiers where iron is being mined, up to the North in Groote Eylandt where<br />
manganese is being mined, and here where oil is being distributed throughout<br />
the whole of Australia, is building those industrial muscles which we n~ eed and<br />
will in the future need still more.<br />
We have Mr Jamieson, the head of that partner company which I was<br />
surprised to see or rather one of your companies, Sir, that you headed<br />
was surprised to see was only the second largest company in the world an-. d<br />
not the largest. I am sure you won't be satisfied with that for very long, but<br />
since you provide the material which enables that which the largest company<br />
makes to run that's General Motors perhaps you can take some credit for<br />
building up the largest company.':<br />
However that may be, we have here an example of co-operative<br />
development between Australia and the United States which I think can serve<br />
as a blueprint for what we want for our benefit and what the United States<br />
can get for its benefit. We are opening in a place where only 170 years ago<br />
Bass, in a small whaleboat, came through to discovery and which for years<br />
years after that was an area where the whalers and the sealers and the muttonbird<br />
hunters alone were known, we are opening here a fractionation plant. It's a<br />
horrible word fractionation plant it could have been worse, I suppose. It<br />
could have been fractionalisation but what it means, I think, is a Dlant that<br />
breaks things down into fractions.) An-d we are opening it, and it is the last<br />
link in the $ 400 million complex which is going to see flowing to Australian<br />
industry and motorists, Australian oil and which is going to see new sources<br />
of energy in gas flowing to our industries and to our homes. 0 2 </p>
<p>Great risks had to be taken in order to bring this to fruition. Great<br />
amounts of capital had to be found with no certainty of return, indeed with probably<br />
a less than 50 per cent chance of return. At any rate, without any certainty<br />
whatever there would be a return. And this was done because, if it was successful,<br />
great rewards could be won. The risks were equally shared between ap.<br />
Australian and an Amercian company. The rewiards are not so equally shared.<br />
Because close to 50 per cent of profits made, rewards gain~ ed, flow directly to<br />
the Australian people in the form of company taxation or royalties or other<br />
payments. That silent partner gets that at once. For the rest there is-an equal<br />
distribution, which means that of the other half, 50 per cent flowis to Australia,<br />
and our American partner takes, quite properly, anything which matches that.<br />
And in the result we, as an Australian people, will receive what I have<br />
spoken of, the Australian company will receive its share, Australian overseas<br />
ha' ances will be greatly increased it is estimated by some $ 230 million next<br />
year and reduced only by profits repatriated, w~ hich they have every right to<br />
be. And all of this achieved without the Australian people being required to<br />
pay an exorbitant price for their petrol or more than a fair price for their<br />
petrol I speak with some feeling-on this because some time ago, Sir I n<br />
McLennan, the representative of ESSO and myseli sat down to try to work out<br />
what would be a fair price for the sale of Australian oil in Australia and<br />
we worked it out. I was immediately subject to attack by the pun~ dits who said<br />
that we had set the price far too high, that the world price was going to drop<br />
much below what we had agreed it should be. And naturally, because I am a<br />
man who always likes to pay attention to advice, I was disturbed by thisc. But<br />
fortunately, it turned out to be entirely untrue and I think it reasonable to<br />
say that the prize now arranged for the sale of Australian oil is a price which in<br />
many cases would be below the present import parity price for overseas oil....<br />
which I think shows great patriotism on the part of Sir Ian McLennan and<br />
Mr. Jamieson: Well, so, Sir, we are getting all these benefits. We are not paying<br />
for them in any exorbitant way. And I only hope that people throughout Australia<br />
will realise thea risks that have been taken, will recognise the right to the<br />
rewards that comes from those risks, will thoroughly understand the benefit<br />
to this nation which will flow from this co-operative enterprise. I do hope that<br />
there will be no repetition of calls for nationalisation of an enterprise such as<br />
this, as there have been for other great enterprisoes merely because they have<br />
been successful. And I hope and believe that the Australian people would turn<br />
down such calls when they were made. a 0 0 12 </p>
<p>This Bass Strait project, and what will come from it, gives us a<br />
degree of self-sufficiency in Australia for petroleum products, provider, a<br />
new source of energy for our homes and our industries through natural gas, at<br />
least in a part of Australia. But it is not enough. Bass Strait is our largest<br />
known oil deposit. By the end of 1971, it should be producing 85 per cent of all<br />
our locally produced oil.. and from this field and our other knMown fields<br />
we should be drawing 65 to 75 per cent of our total crude oil requirements.<br />
But that won't go on forever.<br />
The Bass 3trait fields we know now should last some twenty years<br />
no more so I am told. And remembering that our consumption of crude-oil<br />
is increasing at about 6 per cent a year, our self-suff iciency from our k-now<br />
fields would drop from the 65 or 75 per cent I have mentioned to 20 per cent<br />
by the end of the decade should no more oil be discovered. So the need f. Lor<br />
contir~ uing search and for new discoveries is very real. I would like to see a<br />
new major oil discovery every two years... and it is necessary for those<br />
who will take the risks in the future looking for such oil to know that if they are<br />
successful they will get the rewards and to know that they will, in a free<br />
enterprise country, subject only to the national good, be able to develop that<br />
which they find and to get the profits from that which they produc.<br />
This has been Australia's great weapon, great argumerxn in seeking<br />
to attract capital from overseas. It must so continue to be if vwe are to continue<br />
to attract that capital we need so much and the results of which are so evident<br />
today in the opening of this plant here, the final step in this great enterprise.<br />
And so, Sir, it does give me very great pleasure indeed to be able<br />
to unveil this plaque and to declare the fractionation plant open. I gather it<br />
has been working for some time, but no doubt it will work better after this<br />
has been done:<br />
Thank you very much. </p>
