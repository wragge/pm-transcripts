PRIME MINIST<br />
FOR MEDIA 18 JUNE 1991<br />
The Government has tonight decided to incorporate the Kakadu<br />
Conservation Zone into the KaladuNational Park and d i'slow<br />
mining ait Coro-nation Hill.-<br />
The Government's decision is based on the overwhelming<br />
evidence that the effect of mining on the Jawoyn people, and<br />
to a lesser extent the environment, outweighs anhy economic<br />
benefit to Australia offered by the proposed mine.<br />
The Government understands that Coronation Hill represents a<br />
special set of circumstances not -existinegl sewhere in<br />
Australia, or indeed, outside the area defined by the Jawoyn<br />
as the Sickness Country. In a country rich in resources,<br />
and undeniably rich in investment opportunity and mining,<br />
the Government has given appropriate weight to the sacred<br />
beliefs of the Jawoyn people and the proposition that one<br />
extra mine be developed.<br />
This decision has no implications for proposals to mine<br />
elsewhere. It is an illogical position to judge this<br />
special case as reflecting any change in the Government's<br />
general attitude to ventures involving the development of<br />
our natural resources. This decision should not be regarded<br />
as a precedent. As the Resource Assessment Commission<br />
report says at paragraph 9.34: " In the light of these<br />
considerations, the Inquiry reaffirms its view that there<br />
are sound reasons for treating the Conservation Zone as a<br />
special case. It understands that the mining and business<br />
sectors have great difficulty in accepting this view but it<br />
believes the facts show that particularly sensitive issues<br />
are involved and that these issues deserve full<br />
consideration before the Government makes its dcso."<br />
The Government accepts the unequivocal and independent<br />
evidence that the area in question is fundamental to Jawoyn<br />
culture, that they regard it as a significant sacred site,<br />
and that mining would constitute an unacceptable desecration<br />
of their culture. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I have said, and I repeat, that it is extremely presumptuous<br />
to question the integrity of Aboriginal beliefs simply<br />
because they are outside an intellectual framework with<br />
which most of us are comfortable. The Jawoyn have made<br />
absolutely clear that they regard Coronation Hill as a<br />
sacred site and that mining should not be allowed. The<br />
Government accepts that the Jawoyn have said no and mean no.<br />
The Government accepts paragraph 7.126 of the RAC report<br />
which says: " The Bula tradition is not a modern invention.<br />
The concepts of the Sickness Country and multiple Bula sites<br />
occur in the first anthropological records of the area,<br />
which date back to the early 1950s."<br />
This is a complete repudiation of the condescending<br />
opportunism of the Leader of the Opposition who said on<br />
17 May: " If you know anything about Aboriginal heritage,<br />
Bula didn't exist ten years ago He ( Bula) suddenly<br />
emerged as a device to block Coronation Hill."<br />
The Government's decision ensures the integrity of the<br />
entire National Park and will aid us in nominating Stage<br />
Three for World Heritage listing. This nomination will<br />
proceed this year. Australia's contribution to<br />
international conservation efforts cannot be underestimated<br />
and it is a matter of pride that the Government has accepted<br />
the benefit of conserving the National Park and the whole of<br />
the abundantly rich Alligator River system within it.<br />
The implications of this decision are twofold; they are,<br />
first, an indication of this Government's genuine commitment<br />
to the religious and cultural beliefs of the Aboriginal<br />
peoples, particularly through the process of Reconciliation,<br />
and secondly, an indication ' that our commitment to<br />
conservation through sustainable development is also genuine<br />
and ongoing. </p>
