It Seams to me that I have to make apersonal<br />
expanation about what we say in Parliament vtmn we pretend<br />
tht samebedy boa si miprosemtW. as. I ought to explain how<br />
I cW to be here because this IS qUit. 8t017#<br />
Last week at four o'cock In the morning,, on Friday<br />
( I reebrit will becausie as I was gping hm to the Lodges<br />
the birds we" e twittering In the trees ( Laughter) and the dawn<br />
was uomng In from the east, eddly enough ( Laughter) and I<br />
Very seida we the dawn break) but the reason for it was that<br />
at four o'clock In the morning on Tridar we wee. just finishing<br />
tvhWer PHaarplipaym Cenhtrairsytm aSse s( sLioanu gahntde r) I awnads whoisphiningg a evlietrytbleod yf or ovneery,<br />
myself* You now, Members or Parliament,, let it be admitted,<br />
have a lot in comn with schoolboys, I say nothing about<br />
schoolgirls. I hae neve dared to pretend that I understood<br />
what vent an In their minds, buit I knov something about schoolboys<br />
( Lausbtor) and you follows know perfectly veil, don't you how<br />
there Is a temptation to leave It and leave It and leaive It until<br />
the * zmuinetIons are looming up and then work like mad to catch<br />
up the aneic o, that is exactlvr what we do in Parliament,<br />
( Laughter) W go along fairly lelswely, week after week,<br />
week after wok, and in the last week, the Minister in Char of<br />
the Hiouse says, mellp If ye are going to got through by Fia<br />
mornngbays we'd better have a few late mns.' 0 And we then7<br />
P ro to sit up until all sort* of absurd hours And so an<br />
Fiday morning, at four o' clock In the morning, the Session ended<br />
and I went Rome.<br />
And yesterday, vs had the last Cabinet Meeting I<br />
hope ( Laughter) before Christmas and vs finished at something<br />
after * I&amp; ve o'clock last night, and when vs had all wished each<br />
ether a Merry Christmes and hoped that vs wouldn't se each other<br />
again in the Cabinet room flor quite a time, two or three of my<br />
ealloagues said to me, '* Well I suppose you'll take a few days<br />
off now.' 0411 I said, Oa ping to Springwlo tomorrow<br />
night to a school speech night' and I don ' t mind admitting to<br />
you that they looked at so an 111 neded Some medical attention<br />
( Laughter). * But why?' they said " IWby must you Vs what have<br />
you got to do with Sprifgwale? M fo which I replied, ' Well,<br />
nothing yet but '( Laughter) I said, 01 so going to Springvale,<br />
to the High Schools for a variety of reasons, but perhaps the<br />
mst oampeliag one is that I happen to be an old friend of the<br />
W-eaL-atr,, and the Headmaster Is, In m7 opinion, not only a<br />
talented and devoted tea cher but be's a rim Moind and a<br />
&amp; reat citisen.'" ( Applauise) Led. I said III think that's not a<br />
bad reasen fiw going out,' 94n as he a&amp; S been Speaking tonight,<br />
I've thought of ao or two additional matters.<br />
After Ibhd lefta State schoolIn Ballarat, I went to<br />
a little Secondary school which disappeared many years ago, but<br />
was then Just struggling tewa6s Its close. I don't supposev<br />
had more tban 32 or 35 boy at the school at tkwt stage. There<br />
were six doing Inteomed" a or what wae then ealled Junior Public.<br />
I notice, Siro that you have got through 112 In Intermediate. </p>
<p>2<br />
What a comanty of scholars you are -1121 and fifty<br />
something in Leaving. We had six. You might say, * W* ll<br />
that's prettyr poor,. That must have been a miserable, little<br />
school. But I want to reind you that the quality of a<br />
school depends an the quality of the people who V through it,<br />
and the suceess of a school, in the long ran, vont depend<br />
just an maberss, it will depen upon you -a few dozen of you<br />
Iii this room tonight; and the kind of things you do in the<br />
world fug' the benefit of mankind let's boye fes out of the<br />
six who were in that Junior Public os, four we" e Final<br />
Honours scholars in their oouwses at the Univrsity. Four out<br />
of ixI know that beeause I hap r to be one of them.<br />
by numbers, I am talking to the boys and girls tonight. Being<br />
a parents and a grandparent, myself, 1I no that most of us<br />
in that rank are beyond redemption. Youa knows ye have settled<br />
into our hawbits of mind, whatever they my be.&amp; I an talking<br />
to the bcs and girls. Never allow yourselves to think that<br />
something madrM~ that has happened to someb( 4y else can't<br />
happen to yea, Dever got Into th rame of mind of thinkcing<br />
that therie are some, people In the world who are ludW enoigh<br />
to do things and tha t this is puely a matter of ludc.<br />
Here is a school of 1 000. This is a very bill<br />
school and It will be bi gjrin hiture, I fear, because all<br />
schools tend to get a little bigger. &amp; 1e ttaou. I want<br />
you to realise, tboit In this very thousand thre are boys and<br />
girls who some day as men and women will e celebrated people<br />
people of great sigraifioanos, people of great influence,<br />
people of great quality; an that apart altogether from the<br />
ones vtbo may get their names, In the nespapers -which, I assure<br />
you, is not very hard to do apart altogether from thdse,<br />
there will be hundreds who will never get their names into the<br />
newsppers,, but who will be helping to keep the world moving<br />
and tokeep it a good place to live in. Therefore, don't<br />
underestimate yoarselvou; don't underestimate your chances.<br />
Now having said that I just mant to offer a few<br />
homely observatons about the th! ngs that we all disliked when<br />
I was at school and that for all I kn many of you dislike<br />
today. For example I alway; s wanted to Le a lawyer a Very<br />
docent ambItion, 1 thnk I wanted to be a lawyer. I wasn't<br />
Interested In antig else. And I hated having mathematics<br />
drinmd Into M. I suppose som o f you chaps do. I don't km<br />
you might all be scientific geniusesG0, but I hated having<br />
mathematics &amp; qmmed Into mo and I might have been-heard to<br />
say, " Oh vbt's the use of this. I want to be a Ilawyer.<br />
Lawyers U; 1 t ha is to work out so" s. Lawyers don't ha a to<br />
engge In all the trids of a matemtical trade. Why should<br />
I v@ 71? u A9 of eourse, it wasn't long after 1 beeame a<br />
lawyer that I realised hay indebteod I should fleel to people<br />
who had made me stady wtatmtios because there is no war<br />
~ 11&amp; ag about nattemtics* You are right Oi' You are wrong.,<br />
you gent ride off tby sayings mell, you km-what 1 man,<br />
of 41ou knaw you get the general, iwoa to te exm~ inr.<br />
you 43ault do that with maths. You are right or you are wrong.<br />
your mirA is working with precision or it isn' t. And, believe<br />
not If you ae poing to be a lawyers, for example, YOU Will neeOd<br />
to have a considerable amount Of precision In YOW mind.<br />
The world Is full Of insCMuwete thi= r. The world Is full<br />
Of peOPle Who have slovenl minds, who say * It'srsod enough.<br />
It's near SUOUSgu TMMtYak tIP. The day wilcm,<br />
whatevetr you do, when yom will be very thankful that you were<br />
required = der sme foVRe Of ONWpuSIOft to do same study which<br />
was in Its natiwe exaeto 0* 00**./ 3 </p>
<p>And then I have heard people -I have oewn them in<br />
my own bwand elsevher* who took great exception to having<br />
to learn poetry bF heart. Any of you like that? I dar* We.<br />
In my days at school in Melbo--e0 hey had an exaination of<br />
th h-1-m-e-re Society* Perbas, 9eamster it still goes on$<br />
does It? bat the play the Shakspeare play 1; the yaw, was<br />
the set Piecee" so to spaadIf you wanted to enter for tb.<br />
Shabesperfs Boaiety exmntoyou bad to learn and be<br />
prepared to writ* on demand'from the exiners, 3 000<br />
lines of the -lay. n I had a pretty g" memory so Icould<br />
learn AW 3, oO lim; es. Do you know I am r. gpr&amp; it, looking<br />
beck an It, as a difftcalt'thing, an unpleeant thn. I don't<br />
undostWAn the point of viem or people Amo says d. l why<br />
should I have to learn poetx7 b~ y heart. I an not ping to be<br />
an actor. I as not going to be a pet. Let me, tell you that<br />
when you are as old as I an you 9va vhite-hairod old<br />
doddering tlallov like me you wilbe eyM pate fal that you<br />
learnt a lot of thing b~ y heart. You will fiad them coming<br />
back iito your mind. You will find that they a" e tremendous<br />
ompany. X= u knousir Archibald Wavell -later Lard Wvel,<br />
the great soldier in the Middle S. st in the last lwr to pubi shed<br />
an antholog or pootrys, a fairly considerable one, a beautiful<br />
selection of kAglish verse, and he included In It nothing that<br />
be didn' t know 1W heart. iHere' a a greet soldier, heavily<br />
concerned with matters of wars going through many dark perlefs<br />
In the Middle igast, well before d4 Alamein In ths-last war and<br />
yet that man refreshed his mind and aheered up his spirit<br />
the recollection in quietness of the poetry he had learnt bw<br />
heart. And I repeat 0the only ones In the book are the ons<br />
that be could set out b heart. Therefore doatt regret what<br />
you do in that field*<br />
And then thirdly might I say so thing about this,<br />
Good speech is unuyneglede I think: today. There are too<br />
many people who think it Is onoug to talk out of the<br />
corner of their xmths and to offer up something that sounds<br />
like Nottentot and who, an being questioned will a " Well<br />
you kno what I mean" out of the corner or their mouth. Tis<br />
is no good. Our languaage Is I believe, omawbet dopnatically,<br />
the greatest and most flexible languads in the world. It is a<br />
marvellous language and whatever you do In life, you will find<br />
that you can do it better and achieve better results In the<br />
doing of It If you can explain yourself to other people, If you<br />
WOnVeYr ideas to other people. And if you are ping~ to do<br />
that, of o must have same respect for the language. Don't<br />
be on o those silly fellove PI-a till talking to the boys<br />
who thinks that if he speaks eoureat diglishs he'll b* re~ orded<br />
as a bit odd, because correct Bnglisb is the smllest debt that<br />
e, owe to the longuaa that has been baqueathed to us by our<br />
forefathers, I oedr, Sir, if I ould Just Illustrate that a<br />
little without taking too long, Over here there Is a University<br />
IMomesh University named after Sir Zohn Nonasb. Sir John H o1nash<br />
was a magmifiont engineer. Be was a groat authority on patent<br />
Iwo, He was a very great soldier, many would say one of the<br />
greatest soldiers in the Unglis-speaking world in this century.<br />
A very remarkable man. I was among the perhaps limited ninber of<br />
people who know that on top of all tbase things he was a magnifIC<br />
advoate. Hie cold put a case, he could explain himself with<br />
such clarity, with such poesasivenss that If you went Into a<br />
little audience and listen" d to 11, ab., doubting him, you always </p>
<p>M 4<br />
omue out completely convinced that he knor what he was talking<br />
about and that he was right* This Is an aspect of his life that<br />
Is not very aosmly known. I would venture to say,# speaking<br />
without authority, that Monash ' a exiormous achievements In war<br />
vwld not have been possible unless he had developed his capacity<br />
for speech ad expmession to the point tha~ t hie ultimately reacbed.<br />
Worth remembering that because theres a" e other things about him<br />
that are better known.<br />
I mentioned Lord Wavefl just now bkvel was a<br />
wo: nderful example of a stranip mixture beasuse by word of mouth<br />
he couldn't explain himself at all. To have a conversation with<br />
him, as I had many times early In 1941t was a trying experience<br />
because yavou md say sametbingg eanwaotly invoking a reply and<br />
Wavoll would just look at you and saiys Oh* or * Nam or something<br />
like that, But when esaton in front of apieeof paper<br />
to write a despak or to write anything, he wrote like an anpe<br />
He" e apin, a man who imderstood the eniamotas imporhsnce of ou<br />
And then, or course boys and girls, the greatest<br />
ezample of the let Winston. Muraille There my have been<br />
many moa wbe kne w as mobh about zmul ir a war as Winston Churchill.*<br />
The" re yave been many non who knew as much as he did or no" e<br />
about imming a Parlimnt. Yet there vas nobody ort earth who,<br />
when It caeto the point of erisis, who could stand up in<br />
Parliament or behind a L4. oropb---and talk to the entire world<br />
with rsh moving and yet simple eloquence. If Winston Churchill<br />
had not, when ha was your aip set out to make himself a master<br />
of his own language and a moro of the literary resources of<br />
his own langwage, I don't think be could have doete what be did<br />
im. the last war and It he couldn't have dn what ha did in the<br />
last war, than b; e whole history of the world today might have<br />
boon gievouasly changed.<br />
News Sir, I won't labour that matter, I will just<br />
end up where I boosa kV saying to you, " Don't make up your minds<br />
that you are just going to be the sam as everybody else.' There<br />
a" e plenty of people In the world who are just the same as<br />
everybody else Make UDyour mind down inside your heart that<br />
you are going to be a b fr , ta ate Voing to do<br />
something different and when people says, h9e's different',<br />
forget about it* I will be a very pod thing to be* What we<br />
want i&amp; this country what the world wants Is a lot of people<br />
who, are different, Uw are Individual himan, beings, w~ have<br />
their own oharaoter and their own quality and their own ambition.<br />
You will have a let of older people who will say, to you about<br />
yourself or about some friend of yours, ' Oh, he's very ambitious,.'<br />
as If that word was somethin disreptable. Believe me, ambition,<br />
Is a peaot thing In the vold., Not cnetnot Silly vanity,<br />
but ambition a belief 6ow inside Your" fI that there are some<br />
things that you can do anid you are letomained to do them; these<br />
are the things that make the world move on, and In duo course, A= e<br />
this sol Is seventy years old and not seven or eight or whatever<br />
it may beg there will ha another ftedhoster addressing another<br />
soiweieth ether sets of parents. I believe that If you do<br />
what I have been rather prosily advising you to dog that Hedmster<br />
will be able to say in his report that in the last seventy years<br />
of Its history, this school has produced A H16C# D-9i lImne<br />
achievements, peat contribution to sociall' 1 aget contribution<br />
to Political ' Lire but above all a pesat -on Cation to rn<br />
life!* the piwilsof justice whisk can only be preserved if<br />
, you all get out ao be individuals, 9 to be yourselves and niot to be<br />
afraid. </p>
