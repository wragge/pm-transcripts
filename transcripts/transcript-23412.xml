    <content><![CDATA[<p>This is probably the tensest border on earth.</p>
<p>On the South Korean side, we have freedom, we have justice, we have democracy.</p>
<p>On the North Korean side, we have an outlaw state which is a threat to world peace and a deadly danger to the people of South Korea.</p>
<p>Obviously, at a place like this, at such a time, it's important to remember the 17,000 Australian soldiers who participated in the Korean War.</p>
<p>It's important to mourn the almost 400 who never returned.</p>
<p>It's important to thank those who continue to guard our freedom: the United States forces and the Republic of Korea forces who continue to defend this border.</p>
