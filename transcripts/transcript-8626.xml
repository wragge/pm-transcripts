PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
DOORSTOP, COLLINGWOOD FOOTBALL CLUB, 24 AUGUST 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Mr Kcating, is this the first of many regular occurrences in the State election<br />
campaign by you?<br />
PM: Well, there will be many and they will be rcgular, probably, yes.<br />
J: How often to you intcnd on coming here?<br />
PM: Well, I don't know, I havcn't got the itinerary straight out of my pockct, but short<br />
of that it will be a few.<br />
J: Do you bclicve you're an asset In the Victorian election?<br />
PM: Wcll tbc national economy is on the risc, we saw that with the National Accounts<br />
a wcck or so ao. Wc'vc just brought down a Budgct which I think most<br />
Victorians should feel happy with. I mean, wc'rc expanding the public sector at<br />
the moment, wc're expanding spending, we're lifting spending on pensions and<br />
Medicare and jobs, in particular. Our opponcnt, Dr Hewson, wants to cut the<br />
Budget by $ 7 billion, so he will send the rccovery into a flat spin. It would go<br />
down and of course Victorians would hurt as a result.<br />
3: Are you worried about being associated with Victorian Labor, which is historically<br />
unpopular at the moment?<br />
PM: Well rm happy to be here, I can answer that.<br />
I: But do you think the Victorian Labor Party dcscrvcs a full tcrrn in Govcrnmcnt?<br />
PM: Yes I do, of course I do. </p>
<p>TEL: 24. Aug. 92 18: 08 No .018 P. 102/ C<br />

J: The Victorian economy is not going very well at the moment, and the Government<br />
Is rather tarnished. Are you worried that this may have some rub off on your<br />
Image?<br />
PM: The fact of the miatter Is this elction will come and go long before a Federal<br />
election, so I'm pleased to be involvcd. But most particularly pleased to be in<br />
Victoria propagating Labor's message.<br />
3: So this election Is suitably distant from your going to the polls.<br />
PM: No, no. you're seeking to nmake an implication that this will have some sort of<br />
Implication for the Federal election, Well, fpso facto it can't because it's separated.<br />
3: Mr Keating, taxes.<br />
PM: Well, wc're the people who are offering tax cuts in 1995-96 without a<br />
consumption tax, and we went out of our way to make it clear that fiscal policy<br />
could afford thosc tax cuts to be paid. On the other hand, Dr Ilewson can only<br />
provide tax cuts with a consumption tax. We're offering exactly the same tax cuts,<br />
same rate 30 per cent at $ 20,500, no consumption tax. He Is saying 30 per cent<br />
at $ 20,500 with a consumption tax.<br />
J: Well why would the explanation of the withholding tax only become clear today?<br />
PM: No, thc thing is thcsc arc nmcasures which we may not need to adopt, or only somc<br />
thereof. It just depends on how fiscal policy is. But I just make this point,<br />
whatever point fiscal policy may be at in 1995-96, whatCVCr things the<br />
Governmnnay need to do to make fiscal policy tighter in 1995-96. so too does<br />
the Opposition. So, Dr Hcwson has a 10 billion funding task for his tax cuts<br />
which hc says hc'l cut from public spending. You can just imagine how<br />
Commonwealth outlays, particularly in the social arca, will look with a $ 10 billion<br />
Cut, and he's got to ind another couple of billion for the starting point because<br />
whatever is our starting point, would he win an election it would be his starting<br />
point as well. So how is he going to find a couplc of billion?<br />
J: You have told us how you arc going to makc a decision whether the adoptions arc<br />
needed by the time of the election. Is that practical? Surely you won't know that<br />
until 1994 or ' 5 or whatcvcr.<br />
PM: We can make thc details of it clear at any time that suits us. But again, we've<br />
taken a conservativc approach, that is wc want fiscal policy to be tight. Thc<br />
Opposition is urging, also having a tight fiscal policy so if it docsn't like thesc<br />
measures, what measures does it have in its back pocket, that Dr Hewson and<br />
Mr Reith have not told us about, where they will reign in fiscal policy In 1995-96? </p>
<p>TEL: 24. Aug. 92 18: 08 No. 018 P. 03/(<br />
3<br />
I mean, it's not good enough for them to say look, this is the Government trying to<br />
tighten up the Budget for 1995-96 with tax cuts, and say wc don't have to do it.<br />
Well of coursc they have to do it.<br />
J: How will you be in a position to judge by the time of thc next election whether<br />
you want to keep these options on the table?<br />
PM: Well, look we have thc option of explaining what they would be in the event of us<br />
adopting them.<br />
J: But if It's appropriate to be conservative this year in your forecasting, why not next<br />
year?<br />
PM: Because, well the conservatism is in the fact that wc want what we're making<br />
clear to everybody Is we arc determined to pay thcse tax cuts, that they'll be paid<br />
without a consumption Iax. But at the same we want fiscal policy in good shape,<br />
we want the Budget in good shape. So what we've Contemplated hcre, what we've<br />
flagged here is tidying up basically existing taxes, existing compliance measures.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well, I'm not here to be<br />
3: Are you annoyed about the political advantage the Opposition seems to have<br />
gained in thc post-Budget period particularly over their campaign on secret tax<br />
which have only been explained today?<br />
PM: The thing Is, if it was secret you wouldn't know about it would you? ipso facto if<br />
they were secret you wouldn't know about them. T'hey are not secret because they<br />
arc In the Budgct papers. Now It's not for you to be parroting the Opposition's<br />
mindless phrases. Thicy wcrc written in the last paragraph of onc of the relevant<br />
text from thc Budget, I mean it's been quite clear. But the point about it is this,<br />
people don't senm to understand this point, the consumption tax will equal half the<br />
revenue of thc currcnr income tax half; 15 per cent on food and clothing and<br />
services is actually in terms of revenue half of the current income tax. Dr Hewson<br />
want's to put a tax equal to half of the current income tax into place and at the<br />
samec time still then have to cut $ 10 billion out of social security, health and<br />
education to pay tax cuts. we're doing none of those things, we're saying we can<br />
afford a 30 per cent tax rate, cutting thc middle incomes without a consumption<br />
tax, but we'll need to do a few sensible house keeping things to make it happen.<br />
J: Mr Keating, if you want to keep [ 1isca0lj c ii . ht, does that mean you're prepared<br />
to loosen monetary policy to boost the economy if it looks like it needs boosting?<br />
PM: Well we've been looscning, haven't you noticed? We've been loosening monetary<br />
policy on 13 consccutivc occasions since January 1990. Rates are now, let me </p>
<p>TEL: 24. Aug. 92 18: 08 No. 018 P. 04/ 0<br />

remind you, 5.75 pcr cent for 90 day bills, or haven't you beard? They arm down<br />
from 18.5.<br />
J: Can they go lower?<br />
PM: Here we go, there's one in every group, isn't there. You know, doorstop monctary<br />
policy. OK, wcll if they can I won't be telling you.<br />
J: Why not?<br />
PM: Because you're not entitled to know at a doorstop.<br />
J: Mr Kcating, what chancc do you giveMr'sKinier at winning this election given<br />
the polls?<br />
PM: Well look, I think the alternative with this sort of mindless, ideological, sort of<br />
heartlessness of the current Liberal Party, where nothing matters only but the<br />
market, nothing matters where rich people, other than to allow rich people to<br />
succeed, where we now throw the rights and protection of workers via awards,<br />
holiday pay, sick leave, all the rest, out the door, I think a lot of Victorians will<br />
start to think twice about that sort of policy approach. And given the fact that they<br />
saw Dr Hcwson's rabid, almost frothing, uncontrolled Budgct reply last Thursday<br />
night, which had no substance and was all about idcological rantings, I'm sure a lot<br />
of people arc quite frightened of him. And they ought to be.<br />
