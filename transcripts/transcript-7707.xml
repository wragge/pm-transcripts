TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH MIhCKIE DE STOOP, ABC RADIO<br />
NEWCASTLE 15 AUGUST 1989<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
DE STOOP: Prime Minister, thanks for your time. I don't<br />
think you need to be told that you have some very unhappy<br />
and very disappointed people, a city of disappointment today<br />
up here. What have you got to say to them?<br />
PM: I've simply got this to say. I believe that the people<br />
of Newcastle would be entitled to be crooked on me if they<br />
believed that I had made the wrong decision. It would've,<br />
unfortunately because I would've liked to have seen it gone<br />
to Newcastle, but undoubtedly it would've been the wrong<br />
decision. Let me make it clear that I've got a very soft<br />
spot for the Newcastle area and that's known. I was very<br />
much involved when we came to office in getting a steel plan<br />
off the ground because Newcastle and Wollongong looked like<br />
being wiped off the face of the map. We weren't going to<br />
let that happen. I've got a very, very, as I say, soft spot<br />
for that. I've also got overall a soft spot for Australia<br />
and I'm not going to make decisions on the basis of what<br />
might be politically suitable. The facts are these. we<br />
made it clear from day one that the decisions would be made<br />
at all points on the basis of price and industry<br />
participation. The processes were totally independent and<br />
were rigourous. The two competing tenders were considered<br />
by committees of the Defence Department and beyond the<br />
Defence Department. There were two basic committees. You<br />
had the Defence Sources Definition Committee which had the<br />
heads of the Defence arms plus the head of the Defence<br />
Department as well as other relevant departments and New<br />
Zealand. There were some 15 people on that committee. As<br />
well as that you had the Chief of Naval Staff Advisory<br />
Committee with some six people on that. In other words over<br />
people putting their recommendations up to the Defence<br />
Force Development Committee of five. So in total you had<br />
the best part of 30 people. And what you must understand is<br />
that there was a unanimous recommendation from the best part<br />
of 30 people involved, unanimous that the best decision for<br />
Australia was the AMECON tender. Now why was that? It was<br />
for a basically very simple reason. Both the ships being<br />
tendered, that is the M type by the Newcastle-Sydney<br />
consortium, the AWS group, and the Meko one being tendered<br />
for by AMECON, were both ships that to the Navy were<br />
acceptable. It is the case that just marginally in respect<br />
of the Meko type destroyer they said there was a marginal<br />
preference on that. But there were considerable preferences </p>
<p>for the Meko design in terms of the areas of management,<br />
financial considerations and financial arrangements,<br />
logistic support and the industry package. The financial<br />
difference was a difference of $ 350 million. That is ten<br />
per cent of the value of the contract.<br />
DE STOOP: OK, well let's take a look at that figure if we<br />
could Mr Hawke. $ 350 million certainly on the surface<br />
sounds like a lot of money but 15 years down the track<br />
really is a drop in the bucket isn't it? If you think of<br />
the unemployment that is going to have to be paid out now to<br />
the people who are not going to get work up here<br />
PM: But you talk about the people who are not going to get<br />
work. The fact is that Newcastle is going to have $ 700<br />
million invested, there's a minimum of $ 700 million to be<br />
invested in Newcastle with 1200 jobs to be created there.<br />
The way you're talking about it Mickie is as though you have<br />
in fact had jobs taken away from you. This is one of the<br />
biggest contracts that will have ever come into Newcastle.<br />
$ 700 million worth of investment and 1200 jobs at least. If<br />
in fact New Zealand doesn't come into the process the<br />
proportion of work that will be going to Newcastle and NSW<br />
will be greater than Victoria.<br />
DE STOOP: We've been told that the percentage that's coming<br />
to Newcastle Mr Hawke is only 15% of the total 40% coming to<br />
NSW. Under the scheme of things if AWS had won the contract<br />
it would've meant many more jobs for many more people.<br />
PM: It is the case if AWS had got it there would've been<br />
more work in Newcastle. But for you to say that $ 350<br />
million is a drop in the bucket is with respect a nonsense.<br />
It's a nonsense that was recognised let me emphasise this<br />
to you and to all your listeners it is a nonsense which<br />
was recognised in my Cabinet room by Premier Greiner and the<br />
representatives of Newcastle. I specifically put to Premier<br />
Greiner when he was here, when he was saying he wanted it to<br />
go to NSW and Newcastle, I said well Nick, what sort of<br />
price differential would you think it would be appropriate<br />
sort of to discount for? How mdch over would you say I<br />
could allow it to go to Newcastle? If it was how many per<br />
cent more expensive should I let it go there? His figure<br />
was what two percent. In other words there was a two per<br />
cent differential that on non-economic grounds it would be<br />
appropriate to go to Newcastle. Greiner said that in front<br />
of everyone in that room and all the representatives from<br />
there, from NSW and from Newcastle, accepted that we had to<br />
make the economically correct decision. For Premier Greiner<br />
to be getting up last night and today and talking about this<br />
as an irresponsible decision just brands him as a hypocrit<br />
and as a man whose word can't be taken. What's the use of<br />
negotiating and discussing with Premier Greiner if I had him<br />
in the Cabinet room here, put it on the table and say<br />
alright Nick, what sort of differential, how much? He said<br />
well, two per cent. And in fact it's ten per cent. And yet<br />
he's saying I should've given it up there. I just ask you </p>
<p>-3-<br />
to remember in respect of Greiner's position in this that<br />
when I had to make a decision about the third runway at<br />
Kingsford Smith or going out to Badgery's Creek, who was it<br />
that hammered me and properly hammered me? He said you<br />
musn't make a political decision on this. He said it might<br />
be politically suitable for you not to build a third runway<br />
because it might lose you some seats around the Kingsford<br />
Smith airport but he said that's the decision you've got to<br />
make. You've got to make it on economic grounds. But when<br />
it comes to this he's got a different story. He says you've<br />
got to make a political decision and not an economic one.<br />
But when I hammered him in the Cabinet room his word in<br />
front of everyone was it would be irresponsible if you made<br />
a decision where the differential was more than two per<br />
cent. Well it's more than two per cent. It's ten per cent.<br />
That $ 350 million is ten per cent of the total value of the<br />
contract.<br />
DE STOOP: We've spoken this morning with the Lord Mayor of<br />
Newcastle, John McNaughton, and he is still hoping that<br />
there will be a percentage of the 25% that's for the<br />
rest of NSW which includes very high tech industry that we<br />
have, in fact we're all set up and ready to go for here.<br />
Now I'm just wondering if there is any chance that we will<br />
get more than that 15% at this stage.<br />
PM: Let me say that I think John McNaughton has been very<br />
responsible about this and he was part of that delegation<br />
that I've just talked about. I've invited John to come down<br />
here later this week and I've done that on the basis that<br />
I've given him, and I give through your station to the<br />
people of Newcastle, a guarantee that I will ensure that<br />
every possible piece of work that can go to Newcastle<br />
consistent with meeting the cross criteria, every piece of<br />
work that can go to Newcastle will go there. Let me remind<br />
you of this. The project is going to bring to Newcastle a<br />
full range of ship building skills. It's not only the<br />
traditional steel fabrication work but it'll also be<br />
engineering, electrical, electronic, pipe work, mechanical<br />
assembly, outfitting, commissioning and testing. Under the<br />
decision that we've taken, if we have the maximum build of<br />
12 ships, which is what it will be if New Zealand comes in<br />
with four of them, I remind you that 58 hull sections will<br />
be assembled in Newcastle and five of the 12 ships will be<br />
launched from Newcastle under that maximum 12 ship build.<br />
Now those things are going to be done and what I have<br />
decided, I've already made the decision yesterday, that I'll<br />
set up a Cabinet sub committee with Peter Morris on it, and<br />
he's got the interests of Newcastle at heart. I'll have<br />
Morris and Beazley and Button. What I'm going to be<br />
suggesting, I've already suggested it to Morris and I'll be<br />
suggesting it to John McNaughton, that you set up a panel of<br />
people, relevant people from Newcastle so that we can<br />
monitor this process and see that we can extract for<br />
Newcastle the maximum amount of work that can be done. But<br />
I would be entitled to have my bum booted from here to<br />
Timbuktu and back if because I would see it as perhaps<br />
politically more advantageous to give it to Newcastle I cost </p>
<p>-4-<br />
this country the best part of half a billion dollars. Now,<br />
I'm not going to do that. I wasn't prepared to do it in<br />
regard to Kingsford Smith. I was told I would lose seats<br />
around the Kingsford Smith airport, that I should take the<br />
politically soft decision. Greiner said don't you do that<br />
and I didn't. Not just because of Greiner but because I'm<br />
always going to take the decision which is the economically<br />
responsible one. But Greiner is a double standard Premier,<br />
preaches economic responsibility in regard to Kingsford<br />
Smith but economic irresponsibility in regard to the<br />
frigates.<br />
DE STOOP: He almost should be smiling because there is<br />
going to be, there's no doubt about it Mr Hawke and you're<br />
aware of it, there's going to be a huge political backlash<br />
here. we're already getting a response from listeners now.<br />
The main thing they're saying is what in the hell does<br />
Newcastle have to do to win a contract through the Federal<br />
Government and<br />
PM: What it has to do is have a consortium<br />
DE STOOP: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: it has to have a consortium who puts up a competitive<br />
tender. The people of Newcastle ought to be saying to the<br />
AWS tenders " how is it AWS, how is it that your tender was<br />
$ 350 million more, $ 350 million more than the other one?"<br />
DE STOOP: They'd argue that it was the better vessel. But<br />
I tell you one question that<br />
PM: They would, but the Navy doesn't. The Navy says that<br />
taking everything into account and let me remind you that<br />
including if the price had been the same the Chief of the<br />
Naval Staff said the Navy's choice was for Meko.<br />
DE STOOP: If the price had been exactly the same?<br />
PM: Yes, that question was put yesterday. Because,' as I<br />
said, there are other considerations than just the actual<br />
ship design and performance, which was marginal. There was<br />
only a marginal difference there. But they've got to take<br />
into account a whole lot of other considerations, like the<br />
question of management of the project, who can they have the<br />
most confidence in in terms of the management of the<br />
project? They went for the one that we chose.<br />
DE STOOP: So the Navy didn't have as much confidence in AWS<br />
as it did in AMECON?<br />
PM: That's obviously what's involved. Yes. They're saying<br />
that. That's not knocking AWS. It's simply saying that<br />
when you have two propositions before you they've got to<br />
make assessments as to which is the better of the two. On<br />
that score they came down in favour of AMECON. And in terms<br />
of financial arrangements, not just the price but in<br />
financial arrangements, in terms of logistic support and in </p>
<p>terms of the industry package, on all of these things which<br />
are of vital importance to the Navy, their preference was<br />
for the AMECON bid. Now are you saying to me I just don't<br />
take this view that the people of Newcastle when they come<br />
to consider this are going to say that Bob Hawke should've<br />
said well there's about 30 people from the Navy, the Defence<br />
Forces, all the relevant people having to make a decision in<br />
the best interests of Australia, that they're going to say<br />
Bob Hawke should've said to these about 30 people who were<br />
unanimous in their view, ' Bob, you should've said just to<br />
look after Newcastle you'll knock over the unanimous<br />
recommendation of some 30 people'. I don't think in the end<br />
the people of Newcastle are going to say that.<br />
DE STOOP: I'll tell you what they are saying though.<br />
They're saying why didn't the Government and the Navy and<br />
the Defence Forces all get together and select a vessel and<br />
then call for tenders? Why wasn't it done that way round?<br />
PM: You can't do it that way.<br />
DE STOOP: Why?<br />
PM: Because Mickie, we don't have the capacity to say we<br />
are naval architects, we'll design the vessel. You've got<br />
to have a proposition saying these are your requirements,<br />
these are your basic requirements, now you tender to us on<br />
the basis of what you know our requirements are.<br />
Essentially what the Dutch did was to base theirs on the M<br />
type vessel which is in service with the Netherlands Navy<br />
and the was essentially based on the existing German<br />
one. Both of them, both of those ships are essentially,<br />
both of those are essentially acceptable to the Navy. Both<br />
are very good ships.<br />
DE STOOP: Is the German vessel being used by the German<br />
Navy Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: Yes, the German, the German, the AMECON one?<br />
DE STOOP: Is it being used by the German Navy?<br />
PM: Yes, it's being used by the German Navy. Being used<br />
and to be used and the Dutch one by the Netherlands Navy.<br />
But the point I'm just coming to is this. In terms of a<br />
decision about acquiring a ship and building a ship, it is<br />
not simply there is a ship, that's a nice ship and that's a<br />
relatively nice ship and looking at them. You've got to<br />
build the damn things. So when tenders are made there are<br />
decisions that have to be made, not only about the relative<br />
price and here there was a ten per cent cost differential<br />
but you also have to have decisions made about the<br />
management capacity. who in terms of the proposals put<br />
forward are most likely to be able to deliver efficiently<br />
and on time? All these sorts of things, and financial<br />
arrangements and provisions. How much do you have to pay up<br />
front, how much later on. All those things are relevant and<br />
in respect if all those considerations </p>
<p>-6-<br />
DE STOOP: Obviously AWS didn't do as well or didn't score<br />
as well in those questions.<br />
PM: You've got to ask yourself the question. Ask some<br />
good Australian people in the Defence Forces, members of our<br />
Defence Forces. Are the people of Newcastle going to say<br />
that those people are crook, that they're irresponsible,<br />
that they're going to recommend the thing that's wrong for<br />
Australia? Are 30 people going to be wrong?<br />
DE STOOP: The one thing that they may say is have they gone<br />
for political expediency?<br />
PM: Now come on. I repudiate that. That is a slur upon<br />
the Chief of the Defence Staff, upon Admiral Hudson, it's a<br />
upon all the senior people in the Navy. If you're<br />
getting to the point where you are casting a slur upon the<br />
integrity of Admiral Hudson and our senior dedicated<br />
committed Defence Forces, then I think that's the bottom of<br />
the barrel.<br />
DE STOOP: Well you know Mr Hawke that there have been so<br />
many leaks over the last two months, we've heard so many<br />
stories up here from various people, a lot of them leaking<br />
out of Canberra through, and I must admit, through the<br />
press. But at one stage it seemed that the Navy, if you got<br />
down to who was going to drive the bloody things, the Navy<br />
was saying we want the AWS ship.<br />
PM: The Navy have said unanimously, through the selection<br />
processes, unanimously that they want the Meko ship. That's<br />
what they have said.<br />
DE STOOP: Is that taking cost?<br />
PM: Taking into account all those factors.<br />
SDE STOOP: given the two vessels side by side which one<br />
would they prefer to drive away?<br />
PM: It's hardly the point. They've got to say let's look<br />
at all the considerations in terms of not you don't only<br />
drive it away. It has to be delivered on time and according<br />
to specifications and have through-life sustenance<br />
provisions. They take all those things into account, the<br />
whole lot. So it's no good just saying which one they drive<br />
away. They take every consideration into account. Mickie<br />
you can go on for 55 hours, you cannot avoid, and I think<br />
you accept that you can't avoid the fact that the Navy and<br />
everyone concerned in this, some 30 people, they all<br />
unanimously, unanimously said to the Government this is the<br />
decision you must make. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
DE STOOP: OK, well that's the thing you've got to sell to<br />
Newcastle. I know that you've been called away at the<br />
moment because you have another appointment. I appreciate<br />
the time you've spent with us. Are you very concerned<br />
just briefly that you do have a big sell job to do here in<br />
Newcastle? PM: Yes, and I will come to Newcastle and I'll talk to<br />
whoever wants to talk to me about it. We won't run away<br />
from it.<br />
DE STOOP: How many seats are threatened do you think?<br />
PM: I don't think any because, in the end, let me say this.<br />
I have more faith in the good sense of the Newcastle people.<br />
I don't think the Newcastle people in the end are going to<br />
say we think that the Chief of the Naval Staff is a crook.<br />
We don't think that all the people in the Defence Forces are<br />
crook. We don't think all the people in Attorney-General's,<br />
Industry and Commerce, the New Zealanders, that all these<br />
people, we don't think they are crook. If they all<br />
unanimously said this was the right decision, and it's a<br />
decision which is going to bring $ 700 million of investment<br />
and 1200 jobs to Newcastle, I think the people of Newcastle<br />
are going to say alright that's the right decision.<br />
DE STOOP: You've got a lot of people walking around the<br />
area today saying frigate, I can tell you. Thank you for<br />
your time.<br />
PM: Thanks Mickie.<br />
ends </p>
