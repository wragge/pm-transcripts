PRIMEIN ISTE<br />
FOR MEDIA EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
INAUGURAL FRANK FORDE MEMORIAL ADDRESS<br />
DELIVERED BY THE PRIME MINISTER, BOB HAWKE AC MP<br />
ROCKHAMPTON, 25 JUNE 1985<br />
REFORM THE NEVER-ENDING CHALLENGE<br />
It is a great honour to be asked to deliver the<br />
inaugural Frank Forde Memorial Address, and a pleasure<br />
to be able to do so here in this city of Rockhampton,<br />
with which Frank Forde was so closely connected<br />
throughout his long career.<br />
Although this is the occasion of the first Memorial<br />
Address, it is also a continuation of the series of<br />
addresses begun in Frank Forde's lifetime in 1973.<br />
one of the enduring sources of the strength of the<br />
Australian Labor Party lies in its sense of continuity.<br />
It is a Party which always looks to the future, yet<br />
always draws strength from its past.<br />
And these lectures themselves provide a very pleasing<br />
and satisfying example of that sense of continuity.<br />
They were established on the initiative of Keith Wright,<br />
then Member for Rockhampton in the Queensland<br />
Legislative Assembly, as a tribute to the man who had<br />
entered the Queensland Parliament as Member for<br />
Rockhampton in 1917. They hiTve been continued on the<br />
initiative of Keith Wright as the Member for Capricornia<br />
in the House of Representatives, as a tribute to the man<br />
who represented Capricornia in the Federal Parliament<br />
from 1922 until 1946.<br />
The inaugural address to honour the man who had been<br />
briefly Prime Minister of Australia in 1945, was<br />
delivered by the Prime Minister of Australia, Gough<br />
Whitlam, in 1973. </p>
<p>I had the honour to deliver the next in the series in<br />
1975 as National President of the Party and President of<br />
the ACTU.<br />
The first official task which I had to undertake in the<br />
House of Representatives as Prime Minister of Australia<br />
was to move a condolence motion placing on record the<br />
House's appreciation of Frank Forde's long and<br />
meritorious public service.<br />
He had been born at Mitchell in July 1890 at the very<br />
time of the tumultuous events here in Queensland which<br />
gave birth to the Labor Party. Barely a month after his<br />
death, on 28 January 1983 at the age of 92, the<br />
Australian Labor Party was once again called to the<br />
leadership of this nation by the people of Australia.<br />
Now the honour falls to me, as Prime Minister, to<br />
inaugurate the Frank Forde memorial address.<br />
And so I say, in recalling these facts, that these<br />
addresses themselves, in honouring one man and one life<br />
of long service to the Party, to Queensland and to<br />
Australia, express our sense of continuity and also<br />
honour the service of the countless thousands upon<br />
thousands, men and women, who have served, sustained,<br />
and strengthened the Australian Labor Party and the<br />
Australian Labor movement, now for nearly a century.<br />
Because this is the inaugural memorial address, it is<br />
appropriate that I should set out, briefly, the<br />
principal facts of Frank Forde's long career.<br />
Frank Forde was born at Mitchell in Queensland on 18<br />
July 1890... After completing his education at the<br />
Christian Brothers College in Toowoomba, he joined the<br />
then Postmaster-General's Department.<br />
It was at that time that he first joined the Australian<br />
Labor Party. In 1917, he was elected to the Queensland<br />
Legislative Assembly where he remained until 1922 when<br />
he decided to enter Federal politics. He was elected to<br />
the House of Representatives as member for Capricornia,<br />
a seat which he was to retain -successfully until 1946.<br />
During the time of the Scullin Government, Frank Forde<br />
first achieved ministerial rank, first as<br />
Assistant Minister for TZrade and Customs, from October<br />
1929 until February 1931, and later as Minister for<br />
Trade and Customs from February 1931 until January 1932.<br />
During his time he also served as Acting Minister for<br />
Transport. </p>
<p>After the defeat of the Scullin Government, he was<br />
elected Deputy Leader of the Federal Parliamentary Labor<br />
Party. In 1935, he was defeated in the contest for the<br />
leadership by only one vote. The man who became leader<br />
was John Curtin. From then, to the day of Curtin's death<br />
in July 1945, Frank Forde remained Curtin's loyal<br />
deputy. He was Deputy Prime Minister from October 1941<br />
and Minister for the Army throughout the war.<br />
After the sudden death of John Curtin in July 1945,<br />
Frank Forde briefly became Prime Minister. When Ben<br />
Chifley was elected as Leader of the Australian Labor<br />
Party, Frank Forde continued as his deputy and Minister<br />
for the Army.<br />
In 1945 he was a member of the Australian delegation to<br />
the conference which established the United Nations.<br />
Surprisingly, in 1946 he was defeated at the general<br />
election. Frank Forde's contributions and talents were<br />
not lost to the country when he lost his seat at the<br />
1946 election. He was appointed to the position of High<br />
Commissioner to Canada, a post which he filled with<br />
considerable distinction until 1953. In 1955, at a<br />
time of great turbulence in the Australian Labor Party,<br />
Frank Forde re-entered politics when he was elected to<br />
the Queensland Parliament after a 33-year absence. He<br />
was beaten in the closely contested State election in<br />
1957.<br />
The great years of achievement remain of course, the war<br />
years, as Minister for the Army and Curtin's Deputy.<br />
As Minister for the Army, Forde was deeply involved in<br />
the higher direction of the war.<br />
But it can never be emphasised too strongly that all the<br />
members of the Curtin Cabinet, whatever their immediate<br />
ministerial responsibilities, were involved in planning<br />
for the peace.<br />
As soon as the immediate crisis with its threat of<br />
invasion had passed, and it was certain that victory,<br />
however hard, however long, ibuld be won, the work of<br />
post-war reconstruction began.<br />
It is essential to understand this to appreciate fully<br />
the achievements of the Curtin Government.<br />
It was not only S great war government, it was a<br />
government of reform and reconstruct ion. </p>
<p>Curtin and his colleagues deeply believed that just as<br />
the nation's resources had been fully mobilised for war,<br />
so they could be mobilised for peace.<br />
And Curtin believed that, given leadership, the<br />
Australian people would respond to the challenge of<br />
rebuilding the post-war society, as they had so<br />
splendidly to the supreme crisis of war.<br />
We can now see that World War II acted as a catalyst<br />
for change enormous change in Australia.<br />
Australian society and the Australian economy were<br />
fundamentally reshaped in the years between 1942 and<br />
1949. The governments of Curtin and Chifley accepted the<br />
Federal government's overriding responsibility for the<br />
management of the Australian economy, set the goal of<br />
full employment, vastly expanded the manufacturing and<br />
heavy industry base, transformed the social security<br />
system, established the post-war immigration scheme,<br />
reformed the banking system, accepted, for the first<br />
time, a share of Commonwealth responsibility for<br />
education, health, housing, power and transport in<br />
short, established the framework of modern Australia.<br />
One reform of immense significance was introduced as a<br />
direct response to the urgency of the war effort.<br />
That was the establishment of the uniform tax system in<br />
1943.<br />
As I have said, the war was the catalyst which shaped<br />
modern Australia.<br />
But the important thing to understand about the Curtin<br />
and Chifley Governments is that they were determined to<br />
react positively and constructively to the challenges<br />
and opportunities offered by the conditions the war had<br />
created. The war was the crucible for change. Vast changes were<br />
inevitable. But it was the Curtin and Chifley<br />
Governments which forged the shape of change.<br />
They were not prepared to stand aside while without<br />
structure or direction change overtook the Australian<br />
people. They would not allow change to overwhelm a<br />
nation unprepared -and ill-equipped to cope with change<br />
or to meet the tremendous challenges of the immediate<br />
post-war years. </p>
<p>Both those governments believed that it was the proper<br />
role of the national government to accept responsibility<br />
for change, to identify great problems before they got<br />
out of control and to take the tough decisions to<br />
rectify them.<br />
In short, they believed in leadership.<br />
And it was post-war reconstruction, initiated by Curtin<br />
and implemented by Chifley, which laid the foundations<br />
for Australia's growth and progress for the next quarter<br />
of a century.<br />
In March 1983, Labor was once again called on by the<br />
people of Australia in a time of crisis and in a time of<br />
great change.<br />
Our urgent and immediate task was to achieve economic<br />
recovery.<br />
But like the Curtin and Chifley Governments, we have<br />
never accep'%-ed that our only responsibility was to solve<br />
the immediate crisis.<br />
And while I have never pretended to compare, in scale<br />
and scope, the crisis faced by the Curtin/ Forde<br />
Government, there is this parallel: unless the efforts<br />
and sacrifices of the Australian people and Australian<br />
governments to overcome both crises were used -to secure<br />
positive and permanent change and reform, then those<br />
efforts and sacrifices would have been, indeed, in vain.<br />
That was the approach of the Curtin Government. It is<br />
our approach now.<br />
If as a government and a nation we do not use the new<br />
strength and vigour we have achieved together in the<br />
economy, to equip Australia to meet the challenges and<br />
adjust to the changes over the long years ahead, then we<br />
would be as recreant to our responsibilities as our<br />
predecessors were.<br />
The approach we have adopted can be summarised in the<br />
words I used in the Policy Speech I delivered on behalf<br />
of the Party last November. I. said:<br />
We offer a continuing, coherent program a firm<br />
ordering of priorities to build a prosperous,<br />
fair and caring society; -a strong and dynamic<br />
nation harnessing to the full the talents of our<br />
people to meet even' more effectively the<br />
challenges ati8 opportunities of an increasingly<br />
complex world and an increasingly competitive<br />
Western Pacific region, in which our destiny<br />
has placed us forever; and a nation in which,<br />
as we strive to meet those challenges and to </p>
<p>reach those goals, all Australians, whatever<br />
their background, can truly feel that they are<br />
involved, that each has a part to play, in the<br />
real life and growth of a great nation.<br />
In our first term, the emphasis was on achieving<br />
recovery through reconciliation. Now in our second term<br />
the task is to sustain the recovery without inflation<br />
and to achieve the structural reforms needed to maintain<br />
the conditions for growth.<br />
For too long Australians tended to assume that with our<br />
abundance of resources, growth would come naturally,<br />
without real effort, and that the world would readily'<br />
buy our surplus production.<br />
And the result was that, in the halcyon days,<br />
opportunities were squandered to place our growth and<br />
the maintenance of our standards on an even firmer<br />
footing.<br />
Now, that growth has once again been achieved and this<br />
time by the efforts, restraint and responsibility of the<br />
whole community we must ensure we do not make that<br />
mistake again.<br />
The structure of Australian industry is constantly<br />
changing. In the past that change has occurred<br />
haphazardly, often destructively for both those who<br />
employ and those who are employed, and all too often<br />
without any real concern for the economic and social<br />
implications for the community.<br />
We are therefore committed to encouraging, with the cooperation-<br />
of business, trade unions and relevant levels<br />
of Government, the orderly restructuring of Australian<br />
industry. We want to see an industrial structure which<br />
is competitive, export-oriented and capable of providing<br />
increased, secure and satisfying employment.<br />
We have demonstrated that this can be done in the steel<br />
industry which was facing extinction when we came to<br />
office. And we have shown it can be done in the motor<br />
vehicle industry.<br />
If we are to maximise our own economic growth we must<br />
increasingly, as I have often put it, mesh our economy<br />
into the rapidly expanding economies of North-east and<br />
South-east Asia and the Pacific. Our policies will<br />
continue increasingly toobe directed towards ensuring<br />
that we contribute to and benefit from the growth of<br />
these countries, not only in agricultural and mineral<br />
products but through a range of processed and<br />
manufactured goods and services, applying the best<br />
technology available. </p>
<p>We must, as a government, as a nation, continue to work<br />
systematically on long-term structural reforms designed<br />
to raise the capacity for sustained growth: in trade;<br />
in education; in the effective use of technology; in<br />
business deregulation; in manufacturing and rural<br />
industry, transport and other key economic sectors; and<br />
in taxation reform.<br />
All these reforms involve difficult decisions. Many of<br />
them involve radical changes in conventional attitudes<br />
which have become entrenched over the years.<br />
But a government which shrank from the task of making<br />
those decisions and seeking to change entrenched<br />
attitudes would be unworthy of the great responsibility<br />
entrusted to it by thxe people of Australia.<br />
True, there is always an alternative. There is always<br />
the soft option. There is always the temptation to<br />
settle for drift, decay and decline the conservative<br />
approach so admirably summed up by Sir William McMahon<br />
as Prime Minister in 1972, when he announced: " We have<br />
made the decision to make no decision"<br />
That was the approach of our predecessors throughout<br />
their seven years. More than anything else, it was<br />
their lack of political courage in office which led to<br />
the accumulation of the massive distortions and<br />
inequalities,' not only in the tax system, but throughout<br />
the society and the'economy.<br />
So often they knew the right thing to do. They knew the<br />
urgeht, necessary thing to do. They knew the action<br />
that should be taken in the best interests of the nation<br />
and the people. They knew what to do to give Australia<br />
a more competitive banking system. They did not have<br />
the courage to do i't Similarly, their nerve failed<br />
them when it came to the deregulation of the financial<br />
system and the floating of the dollar. They knew what<br />
should be done. They lacked the political courage to<br />
act. And in no instance wa their lack of courage and will so<br />
manifest as in their approach to Australia's tax system.<br />
It was under their regime that tax avoidance and evasion<br />
became a national scandal and an indelible disgrace to<br />
the coalition which' let it happen. When they had thrown<br />
the national economy into its worst crisis for fifty<br />
years, the tax avoidance industry was the fastestgrowing<br />
industry tin Australia, as Commissioner Costigan<br />
said in his interim report in December 1981.<br />
Indeed, by then, wi'th economic growth at zero, it was<br />
the only growth industry in Australia.<br />
7-</p>
<p>And to understand fully the urgency of the reform we are<br />
now tackling, it is necessary to put it squarely in the<br />
context of the legacy of those seven years of wasted<br />
opportunities and abdication of responsibility to the<br />
people of Australia.<br />
We have now embarked upon a great national debate on tax<br />
reform. The starting point for any rational debate must<br />
be an understanding of the consequences of doing<br />
nothing, the consequences for the millions of ordinary<br />
Australian taxpayers the middle and lower income<br />
earners who are bearing the brunt of the massively<br />
increased reliance on personal income tax under the<br />
existin. g system.<br />
Let us understand clearly the dimension of the problem.<br />
Today thirty-nine percent of full-time earners in the<br />
workforce are paying income tax at the forty-six cents<br />
marginal rate. Without significant reform, that number<br />
will be far in excess of fifty percent within three<br />
years. There would be three million out of the five and<br />
a half million full-time earners paying the forty-six<br />
cents marginal rate. That is, we are approaching the<br />
situation where for more than half the workforce, every<br />
extra dollar in the pay packet will be eroded by half.<br />
Thirty years ago, the upper income earners those above<br />
the present-day equivalent of $ 35,000 paid more than<br />
half the personal income tax collected in Australia.<br />
Now, those in the upper income range. account for only<br />
twenty percent.<br />
And what-has happened, of course, is not only that<br />
average earners are being pushed into the higher<br />
marginal tax brackets, but as PAYE taxpayers, they are<br />
bearing the burden of the tax avoidance devices<br />
available only to the wealthier sections of the<br />
community. And these are some of the factors influencing our<br />
preference, as a Government, for a broadening of the<br />
tax base.<br />
We are convinced that only in that way would we be able<br />
to ensure that tax is paid accordingly to capacity to<br />
pay. The fact is, that as the system is now operating in<br />
Australia, the direct tax system has ceased to be<br />
genuinely progressive. It is just not achieving the<br />
purposes of equity and justice or efficiency which have<br />
been the reasons for Labor's traditional preference. </p>
<p>We have now to look at the reality. We have to look at<br />
the totality of the sy~ tem. And the reality is that<br />
the chief losers from the system as it is now operating<br />
in its totality are the ordinary working men and women<br />
the great Labor Party Was formed to protect and advance.<br />
But beyond our special'responsibilities as a Labor<br />
Party, there are our wider responsibilities, as a Labor<br />
Government, to all the people of Australia.<br />
We derive those responsibilities from the mandate twice<br />
given to us by the people.<br />
And the clearest part of the renewed mandate conferred<br />
on 1 December 1984 related to our commitment to tax<br />
reform. The commitment was specific. We were specific as to the<br />
means we would use. we were specific about the ends,<br />
about our objectives. We were specific about the<br />
process we would adopt in pursuance of those objectives.<br />
I know of no clearer mandate ever given by the<br />
Australian people. I know of no clearer commitment made<br />
by an Australian government.<br />
It is necessary to emphasise this fact, because there<br />
have been attempts by our opponents and by some<br />
commentators who should know better to suggest that<br />
the road to the national summit on tax reform began with<br />
some half-hearted, half-baked campaign promise made on<br />
the run.<br />
It is very simple to explode such a myth. All that is<br />
necessaryis to refer to the Policy Speech.<br />
In that speech our covenant with the people I set<br />
the priorities for a second term.<br />
I said that after the maintenance of strong, economic<br />
and employment growth with low inflation, our major<br />
priority at home for our second term was:<br />
A genuine reform of the -Australian tax system<br />
to promote growth and to ensure that the benefits<br />
of that growth are fairly shared and bring<br />
lasting relief on personal income taxes to the<br />
millions of ordinary Australian taxpayers.<br />
And then, in the -detailed section on tax reform the<br />
core of our domestic program I said:<br />
The second major challenge for our next term<br />
of office is reform and a complete overhaul of </p>
<p>our tax system. That will be of fundamental<br />
importance to the task of national<br />
reconstruction.<br />
And I said:<br />
A thoroughgoing review and reform of the<br />
entire tax system will be central to all our<br />
tasks in our second term.<br />
I set out the nine principles on which our reform would<br />
be based: First, ther must be no increase in the overall tax<br />
burden, as measured by the share of Commonwealth<br />
Government revenue in gross domestic product.<br />
Second, any reform must continue the process<br />
already begun by this Government, and provide<br />
further major cuts in personal income tax.<br />
Third, -taxation changes must contribute to<br />
smashing tax avoidance and evasion which remain<br />
as features of the tax system which the<br />
Government inherited.<br />
Fourth, any reform must lead to a simpler system<br />
which therefore all Australians can understand<br />
more easily, and which therefore makes tax<br />
avoidance and evasion more difficult.<br />
Fifth, any reform package must result in a<br />
tax system which is fairer, so. that Australians<br />
are only required to pay tax according to their<br />
capacity to pay, and the overall system must<br />
be progressive.<br />
Sixth, any tax reform must not disadvantage<br />
recipients of welfare benefits, and should<br />
reduce or remove " poverty traps"<br />
Seventh, if any reform package which includes<br />
changes in indirect taxes is contemplated, it<br />
must be acceptable to the-various groups in<br />
the Australian community whose response will<br />
determine whether we can maintain moderation in<br />
wage movements.<br />
Eighth, any reform ~ must provide the best possible<br />
climate for i~ fvestment, growth and employment in<br />
Australia. Ninth, any reform package must have widespread<br />
community support, including support at a </p>
<p>widely representative national tax summit of<br />
economic organisations and community groups.<br />
So it can be seen that we sought the clearest possible<br />
mandate for tax reform. We received the mandate we<br />
sought. We accept the responsibility conferred on us by<br />
the people.<br />
To do otherwise to attempt to shift or shelve our<br />
responsibilities would be to turn our backs on all we<br />
stand for as a Government and a Party. But it would be<br />
more than that; in a very real sense, we would be<br />
turning our backs on the people of Australia.<br />
And no Labor Government which is true to the traditions<br />
of the governments of which Frank Forde was a leading<br />
member can ever do that.<br />
The process of tax reform which was given its mandate by<br />
the re-election of the Labor Government more than six<br />
months ago will reach a crucial stage with next week's<br />
national summnit.<br />
The specific purposes of this conference are of course<br />
very different from those at the national summit of<br />
April 1983 which so successfully laid the foundations<br />
for national reconciliation and national recovery.<br />
one great difference is this:<br />
The Economic Summit was called to bring Australians<br />
together in the fight against the worst economic crisis<br />
for fifty years.<br />
The full extent of the crisis was plain to every<br />
Australian. It was a tangible part of the daily<br />
experience of us all. Our predecessors were able to<br />
conceal the growing inequities and inefficiencies of the<br />
tax system, in a way it was impossible to conceal the<br />
damage wrought by their economic policies before 1983.<br />
By comparison, next week's summit is called to deal with<br />
a crisis which has not yet fully developed. Anticipation<br />
and prevention of crisis is oftEen the most difficult and<br />
challenging task of statesmanship. The threatened<br />
breakdown in the Australian tax system can be prevented<br />
only if we have the courage and confidence to act now.<br />
So in the very nature of'things, the task for next'<br />
week's summit fdr the Government, the participants,<br />
and ultimately, for the people is far more complex<br />
than the task of the 1983 Summit. </p>
<p>But the great factor both Summits have in common, is<br />
that their success ultimately depends upon the<br />
intelligence, maturity, common sense and if you like,<br />
the enlightened self-interest of the Australian<br />
people. In the final analysis, it was the people of Australia<br />
who made the 1983 summit work. And so it must be in<br />
1985. It was, in John Curtin's phrase, " the inherent<br />
qualities of the Australian people" which enabled the<br />
Government of which Frank Forde was so distinguished a<br />
member, to take Australia triumphantly through its<br />
supreme crisis. I for one, will never be prepared to<br />
concede that those inherent qualities are any less<br />
evident, any less capable of responding to<br />
leadership, than they were forty years ago.<br />
And that is why without in any way discounting the<br />
difficulties and complexities of the task ahead I am<br />
confident of a final outcome which will prove of<br />
enduring benefit to the people of Australia. </p>
