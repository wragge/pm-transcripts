    <content><![CDATA[<p>15 June 1996</p>
<p>E &amp; OE..............</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong><br />Inaudible......</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong><br />Government policy is not to introduce the GST.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong><br />What about the Nationals though, I mean if they're saying its the grass roots and half of your coalition party want it back what are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong><br />Government policy is not to introduce the GST.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST;</strong><br />Inaudible.......</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong><br />Government policy.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong><br />Inaudible......</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong><br />Oh he's got no leadership problems at all -he's a great deputy, he's got a lot of guts and I admire his strength enormously.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong><br />Prime Minister, this morning NSW taxpayers ( inaudible)...</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong><br />Well I'm not imposing any new tax.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong><br />Yes, but I mean If you and Mr Costello had your way ( inaudible)</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINSTER:</strong><br />We weren't proposing a new tax. If any slug comes on NSW taxpayers, it will be courtesy of the Carr government, because of Beazley's deficit.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong><br />So you don't feel any responsibility on your part?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong><br />None whatsoever. If any slug comes on NSW taxpayers, it will be a Carr impost by reason of Beazley's deficit.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong><br />Mr Howard, there's a fairly substantial pro-gun rally going on today, how do you feel about that?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINSTER:</strong><br />Well, people have a right in this country to demonstrate lawfully it's part of the open democratic process of Australia, but I have not changed my views, I will not be changing my views on gun prohibitions. Yesterday, all of the State  Governments endorsed the resolution of the Police Ministers. As far as I'm concerned the amendments to the legislation should be passed as soon as possible by the respective State governments.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong><br />We're talking numbers of around 85,000 so that's not a big enough voice to listen to?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong><br />I have no doubt that the overwhelming majority of the mainstream of the Australian community totally supports what the Government is doing.<br />Thank you.</p>
