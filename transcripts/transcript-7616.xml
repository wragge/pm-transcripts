PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, OPERA HOUSE 26 MAY 1989<br />
3 0 8 PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST; Another late flight I believe. I'm just<br />
wondering what your thoughts are on the state of our<br />
airlines and why you've bought into the air traffic<br />
controllers, dispute at the moment.<br />
PM: I'm not prepared to allow this haemorrhaging of our<br />
airline system to continue and they need to understand that<br />
we are just not going to stand idly by and al -low it to go<br />
on. So the CAA will be prepared to process those provisions<br />
in the Award which allow punitive action and I have with Mr<br />
Willis commissioned a group of three to advise us urgently<br />
on what is the range of measures available to us to deal<br />
with this situation. it is a nonsense that's going on, they<br />
need to understand that they are not going to blackmail this<br />
Government through pressure on the public to give them<br />
massive wage increases and particularly in a situation where<br />
we are acceleratinq our programs to upgrade the radar and<br />
other relevant facilities at our airports. If they think<br />
they are going to break the Australian economy by having a<br />
wages breakout by imposing this sort of pressure then<br />
they ' vewgot another thing coming. If it's necessary the<br />
system wil be closed. That's not what we want. We want<br />
sensible co-operation. There is a process within the<br />
Arbitration Commission whereby there can be a restructuring<br />
of the Award in accordance with the general principles that<br />
can be accelerated so that their conditions under the<br />
restructuring process are properly accommodated. BuL they<br />
are not going toiget special treatment and they are not<br />
going to blackmai this Government.<br />
JOURNALIST: The airline bosses, they've expressed their<br />
concern, Sir Peter Abeles was talking about the lack of<br />
services airports. Has he made representations to you<br />
about the air traffic controllers?<br />
PM: The representations are being made by the airline<br />
industry generally to my Government.<br />
JOURNALIST: Home loan interest rates now </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Px: I've got no comment to make on interest rates, to say<br />
anything other than I said in the Parliament and that is<br />
that and i said it as recently as yesterday in the<br />
Parliament and that is that no Government in its right<br />
mind has interest rates hi~ her for a moment longer than is<br />
necessary, It's not politically popular to have high<br />
interest rates but I say to the people of Australia that<br />
what we've got is an economy which is just running very,<br />
very strongly and we are sucking in too high a level of<br />
imports and this and future generations in Australia will<br />
pay a very, very high price if we're not prepared to slow<br />
down activity. Therefore it's necessary in all our best<br />
interests, immediate and longer term, to bring back that<br />
level of activity somewhat and the level of interest rates<br />
that are currently operating are necessary to achieve that.<br />
JOURNALIST: We're seeing the Westpac Bank today put it up<br />
to 17%, a full one per cent. Is that increase justified?<br />
PM: I'm not making any comments about particular interest<br />
rates. The situation is, asI say, that monetary policy has<br />
to be tight. we can't keep the current level of activity.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I'm not adding anything, I'm not saying anything more<br />
about interest rates so don't waste your time and mine by<br />
asking any more questions about it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did the Government act too slowly and<br />
PM: I've got nothing to add on the area which impinges upon<br />
interest rate policy because any more statements could be<br />
counterproductive and I don't intend to make any more.<br />
JOURNALIST; What time limit are you giving the air traffic<br />
controllers? PM: It's not a question of time, We're initiating the<br />
action now, I hope they can see that we're serious about<br />
this and that we're not goin gto tolerate a continuation of<br />
this absurd situation where it's disguised industrial<br />
action. They have a pattern of the taking of sick leave<br />
which is an absurdity, including people taking sick leave,<br />
coming back and doing some extra hours and then going off<br />
again and suffering no loss but causing enormous<br />
interference and sabotage to the system. It's not going to<br />
be tolerated.<br />
JOURNALIST; ( inaudible)<br />
PM; Look I'm not saying anything more about banks so don't<br />
waste your time and mine. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
JOURNALIST: Some economists, the Opposition, are saying<br />
that a further tightening of policy though may send the<br />
country into recession.<br />
PMt: No-one takes any notice of the opposition in the area<br />
of economic policy. They had their chance, they were there<br />
for seven years and because they had no wages policy which<br />
allowed a breakout of wages in the order of an increase of<br />
16 or 17%, they did what had never been done before. I mean<br />
they are unique, they achieved in that period before we came<br />
to office, simultaneous double-digit unemployment an<br />
additional quarter of a million people going on to the<br />
unemployment scrapheap in the last 12 months of office. So<br />
they have no credentials to talk about economic management.<br />
we have wages policy very tight through the co-operation of<br />
the trade union movement, we have fiscal policy tighter than<br />
it's ever been, we've had now a second year of budget<br />
surplus, three years in a row of reduced real Commonwealth<br />
outlays. These are achievements which have been unmatched<br />
in 35 years of the keeping of comparable records. We've now<br />
got an economy which is running too strongly and we've got<br />
to haul it back in. we don't need any advice from the<br />
opposition, they have their criticism but the interesting<br />
thing is that they have no policies. The distinguishing<br />
charcteistioftheopposition on economics at the moment<br />
is a total absence of pl icy which is not surprising.<br />
ends </p>
