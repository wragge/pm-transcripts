    <content><![CDATA[<p>Our country has lost its 22nd Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Malcolm Fraser.</p>
<p>It is a sad moment for all Australians. It's a particularly sad day for all who cheered Malcolm Fraser on in those stirring days when he led the fight against what many of us thought was a bad government â the days of 1975.</p>
<p>As our nation's leader between 1975 and 1983, Malcolm Fraser restored economically responsible government while recognising social change.</p>
<p>In a long and active retirement, he maintained a keen interest in our country's direction. Of course, the constitutional crisis of 1975 was one of the defining political events in our country's history.</p>
<p>Malcolm Fraser held true to the belief that his actions were in the best interests of Australia. He was, as he put it, determined to turn on the lights and to restore Australia's economic fortunes. It was the greatest win in Australian political history, and it confirms that he had correctly read the public mood.</p>
<p>The friendship he built in later life with Gough Whitlam does speak volumes about the character of both men at the centre of this crisis. In their own different ways, they were both fierce Australian patriots.</p>
<p>Under Malcolm Fraser's leadership, self-government was conferred on the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth Ombudsman was established, and our first freedom of information laws were enacted.</p>
<p>Following the Hilton Hotel bombing, he established the Australian Federal Police.</p>
<p>Later, he introduced legislation to establish a crimes commission following the Costigan Royal Commission.</p>
<p>He commissioned the Campbell Report of 1981 which laid the foundations for the eventual deregulation of our financial system.</p>
<p>Under Malcolm Fraser's leadership, Australia was an unwavering opponent of apartheid. And after he left office, he continued to work for its end. His subsequent appointment to roles with the United Nations and with the Commonwealth of Nations reflected his high international standing.</p>
<p>He had a deep interest in the advancement of Indigenous people and introduced the <em>Aboriginal Land Rights Act</em> in 1976.</p>
<p>He banned sand mining on Fraser Island, as well, the First Australian sites were placed on the World Heritage List under his government and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park was established.</p>
<p>He welcomed the resettlement of tens of thousands of Vietnamese people in Australia, people who have subsequently added a rich dimension to our national life.</p>
<p>He was rightly proud of his government. As he said when he conceded defeat in 1983: <em>Australia is handed overâ¦ in as good a condition or better condition than any other Western country in the world</em>.</p>
<p>In retirement, among many other things, he brought here Care International and Care International has done great work at home and abroad.</p>
<p>I made it my business to renew my contact with him on becoming party leader back in 2009. Although his politics had changed over the years, he had led us triumphantly into government and deserved the continuing respect of all Australian Liberals.</p>
<p>I had quite a number of long talks with him since then, most recently late last year. I didn't always agree with all of his positions. In fact, I often disagreed with his positions. But I always appreciated his insights and the wisdom born of long experience.</p>
<p>Of course, throughout his life, Malcolm Fraser was supported by Tamie, his wife. All subsequent Australian Prime Ministers and Governors-General have benefitted from her continued work with the Australiana Fund, which helps to maintain the character of our four official residences.</p>
<p>The sympathies of all Australians today go out to Tamie, to their children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>As I say, this is a sad moment for all of us. But it's a particularly sad moment for all of those whose cause Malcolm Fraser has championed.</p>
