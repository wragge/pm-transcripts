FOR PRESS FRI. 8 OCTOBER 1.976<br />
ADDRESS AT THE OPENING OF THE P. T. JAMES HARDIE ASBESTOS,<br />
INDONESIA<br />
The factory which the President is opening today, P. T. James<br />
Hardie Indonesia,, is Australia's largest joint venture<br />
investment to date in Indonesia.<br />
Though Australia had not traditinlybeasgifct<br />
axporter of private investment capital, Australian companies<br />
have, in recent years, shown. a keen interest in<br />
participating in projects in neighbouring countries.<br />
Indonesia, in particular, has been a focus for Australian<br />
investment arid now draws more private Australian investment<br />
funds than any other country in the South East Asian region.<br />
This is James Hardie's second joint venture project in<br />
Indonesia and-a number of other leading Australian companies<br />
among them and Monier, also<br />
are contributing to the economic development of your country.<br />
The Australian Government is conscious of the contribution<br />
Australian private investment, accompanied by technical<br />
know-how and managerial skills, can make to the growth of<br />
other countries.<br />
Our policy is to encourage such investment, especially on a joint<br />
venture basis, provided it is in harmony with the host<br />
country's social and economic development plans and its<br />
investment policies and procedures. Australian industry was<br />
quick to respond to the attitude of your Government to foreign<br />
investment. Early approval was given to an investment that<br />
hasnow become a household word in Indonesia Indomilk a<br />
joint venture between N. V. Marison, and the ( then) Australian<br />
Dairy Produce Board.<br />
Australian industry's confidence in Indonesia's economy<br />
prospects has been expressed in joint venture investment<br />
in many fields. Manufacture of steel roofing and wall cladding,<br />
aluminium extrusions,. industrial gases, zinc oxide, glass<br />
containers, roof tiles,, ready-mix concrete, drums for oil<br />
industry, and in tin mining. / 2 </p>
<p>Our own approach to foreign investment in Iustralia has<br />
been to encourage joint ventures while recognisinig the great<br />
contribution that such investment can make to development.<br />
At present, the Indonesian Government has approved<br />
46 Australian proposals for joint ventures which together<br />
represent a joint commitment of some A$ 156 million.<br />
Apart from Australian investment in Papua New Guinea, which is<br />
a somewhat special case, Indonesia is by far the greatest<br />
recipient of Australian investment. I believe that Australian<br />
business has been careful to comply with the wishes of your<br />
Government relating to foreign investment.<br />
That Indonesian financial participation should be widened<br />
as time goes on, and that a transfer of know-how should take<br />
place at all, levels of the joint venture through training<br />
for Indonesian employees.<br />
This factory employs a large number of Indonesians in both<br />
production and managerial operations. They will benefit from<br />
the succe-ss of this enterprise. I hop--, therefore, that this<br />
joint venture will receive the support of Indonesian contractors<br />
who require asbestos pipes and sheets, and of course the<br />
various Departments of the Government of Indonesia who are<br />
substantial users of the products made by this company.<br />
As countries we both recognise -the great importance of encouraging<br />
the enterprise and initiative and -the benefits that can flow<br />
from such enterprise to all our people.<br />
I wish James Hardie well. 000000000Q </p>
