AUSTHAILolA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 18 MARCH 1986<br />
Three new members will be appointed to the Australian Science and<br />
Technology Council ( ASTEC) together with re-appointment of two<br />
members whose initial terms of service have ended.<br />
Professor G A Rigby and Mr L S Zampatti have been recommended for<br />
re-appointment to a further three year term as members of ASTEC<br />
and Professor D A Aitkin, Dr R G Gregory and Mr R A Wheeldon have<br />
been recommended for appointment as new members of ASTEC.<br />
Professor Rigby is Professor of Electrical Engineering at the<br />
University of New South Wales and is Director of its Joint<br />
Microelectronics Research Centre.<br />
Mr Zampatti is the managing director of Brett and Co ( Pty)<br />
Limited and associated companies, and is a director of the<br />
Australian Bank Limited.<br />
Professor D A Aitkin is Professor of Political Science in the<br />
Institute of Advanced Studies at the Australian National<br />
University. Dr R G Gregory is a Professorial Research Fellow at the Research<br />
School of Social Sciences, Australian National University.<br />
Mr R A Wheeldon is the joint managing director of BWD Industries<br />
Limited and of the BWD ( Australia) group of companies,<br />
manufacturers of scientific, meteorological and laboratory<br />
instruments.<br />
The Government appreciates the commitment the new Council members<br />
would make in serving ASTEC, which would inevitably divert their<br />
energies from their high accomplishments in their respective<br />
fields.<br />
The Government also pays tribute to the important contributions<br />
to the work of ASTEC made by three members whose terms of service<br />
had been completed.<br />
These are Mr P M Trainor, Mr J N Davenport, and Professor<br />
J W Nevile. </p>
