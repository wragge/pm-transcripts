10.45 a. m.* PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 30 JULY 1977<br />
ADDRESS TO VICTORIAN LIBERAL COUNCIL -MELBOURNE<br />
It is a great pleasure to participate once again in a meeting of<br />
the State Council, and I would like to take this opportunity to<br />
thank Joy Mein for her support in the past twelve months. I am very<br />
much looking forward to working with her in the year ahead. I<br />
would also like to pay a special tribute to two Foundation Members<br />
of the Party, who, after many years of distinguished service have<br />
decided not to renominate for the State Executive Mrs. Audrey<br />
Reader and Mrs. Valerie Austin. Both were members of the<br />
Victorian State Executive with me when I was first elected<br />
to the Parliament in 1955. Both have served continuously on<br />
Executive since then. It is the intelligence and hard work of<br />
people like Mrs. Reader and Mrs. Austin that has made the success<br />
of the Liberal Party possible.<br />
But this intelligence, hard work and the concern with matters of<br />
substance that mark the Liberal Party means however that we<br />
cannot surpass the ALP in one respect.. Our Councils are not<br />
as exciting as ALP Conferences.<br />
At the Perth ALP Conference, Mr. Whitlam delivered a sp eech in<br />
which he claimed he had seen the light of economic responsibility.<br />
As Mr. Hayden pointed out, the speech had undoubtedly been drafted<br />
on the road to Damascus.<br />
This was a stirring performance, but it was outdone by Mr. Hawke's<br />
announcement that if the leadership of the Parliamentary Labor<br />
Party was not bestowed upon him, he just would not enter the<br />
Parliament. But, as Mr. Whitlam said some years ago " I do not care how many<br />
prima donnas there are in the Labor Party so long as I am the<br />
prima donna assoluta". And at his National Press Club appearance<br />
he proved that he could still hit the highest note.<br />
In the space of a few sentences, he managed to attack the<br />
Commonwealth Treasury, the Bank of New South Wales, all Rotarians,<br />
and the Reserve Bank, of which his own Mr. Hawke is a Board member.<br />
/ Under </p>
<p>2<br />
Under Labor, taxes rose inexorably minimising individual<br />
choice and maximising Government direction over our lives.<br />
Increasing numbers of Australians were being compelled to<br />
become more dependent on welfare payments. The bureaucracy<br />
grew ever larger as it regulated more and more of the<br />
nation's life. Power was relentlessly transferred from<br />
state and local government to Canberra.<br />
We as Liberals rejected the notion that the answer to<br />
society's problems was more government spending, more<br />
power for Canberra. Labor had taken that path and it<br />
was stifling the initiative and drive on which our prosperity<br />
was founded.<br />
We were elected nineteen months ago because we were<br />
committed to a fresh start, a new direction for Government.<br />
Because we-were committed to creating the conditions in<br />
which people's independence was enhanced, their ability<br />
to achieve things for themselves and for others increased.<br />
We have begun to fulfil that commitment.<br />
The trend to bigger, more impersonal, more centralised<br />
government has been broken. We have introduced fundamental<br />
reforms to the taxation system. Through tax indexation<br />
we have brought to an end the system under which income<br />
tax rose simply through the effects of inflation. / We have </p>
<p>-3<br />
We have reformed company taxation so that businessmen are no<br />
longer taxed on imaginary profits derived from the effect of<br />
inflation on their stocks. The growth of the public sector<br />
has been halted. Our estimates indicate that the proportion<br />
of gross national product attributable to the Commonwealth has<br />
fallen. We are keeping Government spending to zero real grow th.<br />
The rapid growth of the Public Service has been reversed. By<br />
reducing staff ceilings, we have cut the number of Commonwealth<br />
Government employees by 12,000. This is 31,000 less than it<br />
would have been under Labor's policies.<br />
Protection of the individual against the State is one of the<br />
most fundamental commitments of Liberalism, and we have legislated<br />
to provide far greater protection for individuals against the<br />
power of the bureaucracy.<br />
The first Ombudsman, Professor Richardson, commenced work this<br />
month. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal has commenced work.<br />
The procedures for the Courts to review administrative decisions<br />
have been simplified. The Federal Court system has been reformed.<br />
We have moved to provide effective aid to the disadvantaged aid<br />
which is directed to those in need and which does not make them<br />
more dependent on the Government. The Family Allowance Scheme<br />
exemplifies our approach. We abolished tax deductions for<br />
children which disproportionately benefitted the better of f<br />
sections of the community, and replaced them with direct cash<br />
payments to all mothers. This scheme has been of the greatest<br />
benefit to the poorer sections of the community.<br />
Central to our social welfare measures is the understanding that<br />
need and disadvantage are caused not only by a lack of material<br />
resources, but also by a lack of knowledge about where to go to<br />
get assistance; and often by a sense of powerlessness when faced<br />
with large organisations. We have accordingly moved to make the<br />
bureaucracy more responsive to peoples needs, and encouraged and<br />
supported the work done by voluntary organisations that are often<br />
more accessible than public service departments.<br />
At the moment for instance, we are conducting an important<br />
experiment with migrant resource centres in Melbourne and Sydney.<br />
The erosion of the power of the states and local government has<br />
been reversed. Under our policies of new federalism, greater<br />
financial independence and responsibility has been given back<br />
to the states, and the Commonwealth has withdrawn from fields<br />
in which ' it had been unnecessarily interfering.<br />
We have directed our energies in tackling the most disastrous<br />
consequence of Labor rule inflation. Inflation hurts us all,<br />
but as the Henderson Poverty Report pointed out it hurts<br />
none so much as the poor and old, those least able to protect<br />
themselves. Inflation stifles investment and reduces real<br />
business profits. The inevitable result is unemployment. Our<br />
concerted anti-inflationary policies have met with considerable<br />
success. Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index has<br />
fallen, after excluding the effects of Medibank, from 16.7%<br />
when we came to office to 10.2%. / other </p>
<p>-4<br />
Other economic indicators show that the economy is growing<br />
again. In the financial year just ended, there is every<br />
indication that our target of 4% real growth has been achieved.<br />
Private investment is rising. In 1976, investment in plant and<br />
equipment rose 6.8% in real terms. Company profits have risen.<br />
In the March quarter, they were up 27% on the preceding year.<br />
But much remains to be done. We must reduce inflation still<br />
further, and of course it is essential that the present high<br />
level of unemployment be reduced. A number of innovative schemes<br />
have been introduced to alleviate unemployment, and the results<br />
have been encouraging.<br />
The Community Youth Support Scheme now involves some 15,000<br />
young people. The NEAT scheme has been expanded to cover<br />
18,000 people, three quarters of whom have found a job at the<br />
end of their term under the scheme. NEAT's special Youth<br />
Employment Training Programme is particularly successful. It<br />
subsidises employers to hire young people who have been unemployed<br />
for a lengthy period of time. Over 70% of them retain their jobs<br />
when the subsidy expires. The CRAFT scheme for promoting<br />
apprenticeships has also been a significant success. The<br />
figures for the financial year just ended are now available.<br />
They show that this scheme now covers over 41,500 apprentices,<br />
and apprenticeships throughout Australia are up 9% on last year.<br />
This scheme is still in its early developmental stage, and even<br />
further increases can be expected this year.<br />
There is also the Relocation Assistance Scheme to help those<br />
who have to move to another area to find employment. But if<br />
there are to be jobs for all those who genuinely want to work,<br />
we must face squarely the fact that wage increases over recent<br />
years have been pricing many people out of jobs. We have not<br />
yet recovered from -the wages explosion that Labor fostered<br />
and it was a vast explosion.<br />
In the two years to October 1975, award wages in manufacturing<br />
industry increased by 53%. Even today, average weekly earnings<br />
in Australia are over 13% higher than those in the United States.<br />
Only a few years ago, the position was the reverse.<br />
Mr. Whitlam had a momentary flash of insight when he said<br />
" Every excessive increase in income for one man takes away<br />
the job of another".<br />
A survey last week starkly underlined the importance of wage<br />
restraint to reducing inflation and unemployment. The survey<br />
showed that one third of companies were wholly passing on wage<br />
rises by increasing their prices, and that of the companies<br />
absorbing wage increases, half were doing so by reducing<br />
their number of employees.<br />
It is clear the high price of labour makes employers reluctant<br />
to employ more workers even when their sales increase. Instead,<br />
they prefer to purchase more labour-saving machines. Excessive<br />
wages contribute to inflation, they slow down economic recovery,<br />
and reduce employment opportunities. / i'f </p>
<p>4<br />
If certain trade union leaders continue their present policies<br />
and attitudes, and if the Arbitration Commission make high wage<br />
determinations, a return to full employment of the kind Australia<br />
once knew will not be possible.<br />
There is also a pressing need for a responsible attitude towards<br />
industrial disputes. Since we were elected, we have legislated<br />
to bring a greater measure of justice, common sense and consultation<br />
to industrial relations in this country, and many of the<br />
major proposals contained in our Industrial Relations policy have<br />
been passed into law. we have legislated to provide for secret<br />
postal ballots for the election of officers registered under the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Act. We have established an<br />
Industrial Relations Bureau as an independent statutory authority.<br />
And we have established the National Labour Consultative Council to<br />
permit continuing discussions on industrial relations issues.<br />
Our approach to industrial relations has resulted in a significant<br />
reduction in the level of industrial disputes. In Labor's last<br />
fifteen months, 4 million working days were lost due to disputes.<br />
In my Government's first fifteen months, excluding Medibank, only<br />
2 million working days have been lost. Over the same period,<br />
wages lost due to disputes have been reduced by $ 48 million.<br />
But despite this improvement, unwarranted strikes and stoppages<br />
still contribute to unemployment, and have imposed hardship on<br />
large sections of the Australian people. The air controllers<br />
strike was a blatant example of the attempt by powerful vested<br />
interest groups to impose their views on the whole community.<br />
This strike was resolved only after we indicated that we would<br />
bring down emergency legislation as a matter of urgency. And now,<br />
stoppages at our major export based mineral projects are seriously<br />
harming Australia.<br />
In the Pilbara there has been an average of over a strike a week.<br />
The seamen's dispute in Queensland typifies the situation where<br />
a small militant group holds not only their employer to ransom,<br />
but also forces large numbers of fellow unionists out of work in<br />
areas unrelated to the strike. The seamen's dispute has led to<br />
the suspension of the $ 250 million Norwich Park project. The<br />
conclusion of subcontracts had had to be postponed and employment<br />
has been seriously affected. The demands of the seamen's union<br />
for Australian-manned ships would, if met, undermine the<br />
competitive position of our iron ore and coal industries.<br />
Industrial disputes of this type are harming this state and<br />
harming the nation. The overwhelming majority of Australians<br />
is opposed to unnecessary strikes so is the overwhelming<br />
majority of unionists. The only people who want them are the<br />
tiny minority of extremist unionists. Many disputes have been<br />
initiated with so little sign of reason and common sense being<br />
displayed that the people of Australia are entitled to ask<br />
whether there is a deliberate attempt to undermine the nation's<br />
prosperity. It is time the selfish minority recognised that<br />
they are members of a civilised community one in which there<br />
are rights and responsibilities, not a jungle in which the most<br />
militant can get their way, irrespective of the cost to others.<br />
The Government will be bringing down further industrial relations<br />
legislation in the Spring Session of Parliament. / we </p>
<p>-6-<br />
We have made progress in facing the issues which concern Australia<br />
because the coalition is united and strong. We were elected on a<br />
joint platform endorsed by both parties, and the Ministry works<br />
as a cohesive single unit. I cannot remember a time in my 22<br />
years in Parliament when the coalition parties have worked<br />
better together. Compare our ministry with the conflicts, the<br />
disruptions and dismissals in the Labor Cabinet. The strength<br />
of relations within the coalition will remain. There could be<br />
nothing more shortsighted than actions which do not recognise that<br />
the Federal Coalition is essential to the good government of<br />
Australia. The effective working of the coalition depends on<br />
co-operation and trust. This has been established by the<br />
politicians. If the Ministers of one coalition party are opposed<br />
by the organisation of another at future elections, Ithat would<br />
inevitably detract from our single-minded pursuit of the good<br />
government of Australia and to defeating the ALP. it is<br />
towards the overriding goal of giving Australia responsible<br />
Government that all our energies should be directed.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, we have only made a beginning in the pro. s<br />
of -translating Liberal principles into Government programmes.<br />
There is still great scope for introducing civil liberties reforms.<br />
They are too often taken for granted and constant vigilance is<br />
required to see how they can be improved and adapted to the<br />
changing needs of our society.<br />
These are some of the.. actions we shall take. We shall establish<br />
a Human Rights Commission. We shall reform the laws governing<br />
criminal investigation by Commonwealth Police to set a fair balance<br />
between the public interest and individual rights. We shall enact<br />
legislation providing free access to many categories of Government<br />
information and archives. In addition, a number of matters have<br />
been referred to the Australian Law Reform Commission for enquiry<br />
and report: the Law of Privacy, the Law of Defamation; the right<br />
to sue in Federal Courts. There is still great scope for improving<br />
our social security system and ensuring that all people in need get<br />
effective and sensitive assistance, and we intend to take more of<br />
the steps necessary to achieve this end.<br />
A great deal more needs to be done in the area of aboriginal affairs.<br />
Years of neglect cannot be overcome overnight. It is clear that we<br />
have only made a beginning, and in pursuing the Liberal idea of a<br />
freer more equitable society, the whole of the Liberal Party has<br />
a major role to play.<br />
Our party is not just an organisation for getting people elected<br />
into Parliament. It is a major arena in which the central ideas<br />
and ideals of liberalism are kept alive and related to the world<br />
in which we live. Liberalism has survived as a philosophy of<br />
social, economic and political life because its central theme<br />
concern for the individual reflects the aspirations of men and<br />
women for freedom and a better life, and because Liberal ideas have<br />
been translated into policies, policies into actions. The<br />
Council provides a stimulus for new thought, and new approaches,<br />
a stimulus which maintains the vitality of the Liberal Party.<br />
By its deliberations and resolutions, it has helped to keep our<br />
party's platform and policy relevant to the great issues and<br />
problems facing our society. </p>
