    <content><![CDATA[<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Prime Minister welcome again to the programme.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is a pleasure.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>What is good news about unemployment stuck at 8.4 per cent?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The good news is that over the last three months we have created</p>
<p>   145,000 jobs. Now that is the best quarterly figure for two and</p>
<p>   a half years. All the other forward indicators show a strengthening</p>
<p>   employment situation and these are the first real signs that we</p>
<p>   have begun to turn the corner and we are quietly confident that</p>
<p>   unemployment will slowly but steadily fall during 1998. It really</p>
<p>   does represent more than just a flash in the pan. We still have</p>
<p>   a long way to go but because the foundations of the economy are</p>
<p>   so strong and growth domestically is so strong. It is a very good</p>
<p>   Christmas, all the indicators are that consumers are spending, so</p>
<p>   we end the year on a very optimistic note for Australian families.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Well you certainly do have a long way to go Prime Minister. We</p>
<p>   have still got 779,000 people out of work and that is, in fact,</p>
<p>   about 11,500 more tonight than on the night you were elected.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course we have a slightly larger population, you have got to</p>
<p>   make allowance for that. We still have a long way to go.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>And youth unemployment now at 28.4 per cent and that was one of</p>
<p>   your benchmarks. You said, judge me by that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We still have a long way to go but let us deal in positive realities,</p>
<p>   and the last quarter has seen the best job performance for two and</p>
<p>   a half years. To have 145,000, I recognise we still have a long</p>
<p>   way to go, but 145,000 jobs created in that period of time is very</p>
<p>   good and very positive news.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Labor says that in its last 21 months they created 297,000 jobs.</p>
<p>   In your first 21 months 54,800.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can remind you that unemployment went to over 11 per cent when</p>
<p>   Mr Beazley was Employment Minister. We can get bogged down in those</p>
<p>   sort of statistical tit-for-tats, but the reality is right now we</p>
<p>   have seen the first really strong signs in two to three years, and</p>
<p>   that goes back to well within the period that Labor was in office,</p>
<p>   the first really strong signs of a turn around in employment. Now</p>
<p>   I acknowledge there is a long way to go but when you see some good,</p>
<p>   positive signs I think it is important that the community gets the</p>
<p>   benefit of that.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, another sign, recently a couple of surveys about</p>
<p>   businesses intentions on investment, they are very frightened now</p>
<p>   about the prospect of being hit by the backwash of the Asian meltdown,</p>
<p>   investment expectations are down dramatically. That won't help</p>
<p>   jobs next year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Paul, obviously the Asian turn down is going to affect Australia</p>
<p>   to some degree. It would have affected Australia a lot more if we</p>
<p>   hadn't fixed up Mr Beazley's $10.5 billion deficit. It</p>
<p>   would have affected Australia a lot more if we hadn't got the</p>
<p>   foundations right and we hadn't got interest rates and inflation</p>
<p>   down.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>But doesn't it jeopardise your growth creation trend?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Paul, there will be some impact but it won't be nearly as</p>
<p>   great as it would have been if the domestic economy had not been</p>
<p>   moving ahead so strongly. You see what we have done over the last</p>
<p>   21 months is to waterproof Australia to a large extent against the</p>
<p>   storms that have come out of Asia. If we had not done what we have</p>
<p>   done over the 21 months we would have, as a people and as a nation,</p>
<p>   we would have been knocked around a lot more over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>And waterproof us against any substantial cuts in greenhouse gas</p>
<p>   emissions as the result of this conference in Kyoto?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>This is a terrific outcome for Australia.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>The greenies don't like it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The greenies seem to have overlooked the fact that in relative</p>
<p>   terms we are going to cut our emissions more than the industrial</p>
<p>   world average, it is just that we had a higher level in the first</p>
<p>   place because we depend very heavily on fossil fuel. But this is</p>
<p>   a balanced outcome, it will protect jobs, and that is very important.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>I thought we were going to put out 8 per cent more of this gas?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, but if we had not taken measures the figure would have been</p>
<p>   somewhere between 28 and 40 per cent. You see, unlike a lot of other</p>
<p>   industrialised countries we rely very heavily on fossil fuel for</p>
<p>   our energy. And what we have done, against all the predictions,</p>
<p>   against the criticism of the Labor Party, the cynicism of our critics,</p>
<p>   what we've been able to do is to achieve a decent balance between</p>
<p>   an overall attack on the environmental problems of pollution. But</p>
<p>   at the same time we have protected Australian jobs. It's an</p>
<p>   excellent outcome for Australia. It's a first-class outcome</p>
<p>   for Australia and one that is certainly pro-employment in Australia,</p>
<p>   but it also means that we'll be playing a very significant</p>
<p>   part in the overall global attack on greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>And you wouldn't look more fair dinkum if you hadn't</p>
<p>   taken so much money away from renewable energy research?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, hang on, I mean, if you're going to start talking about</p>
<p>   who's done what in relation to the environment, I mean, let</p>
<p>   me remind you of the Natural Heritage Trust which is going to make</p>
<p>   an enormous contribution towards reforestation in this country.</p>
<p>   Land care, I mean, that's the biggest environmental package</p>
<p>   that this country has had in 30 or 40 years.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Why do you say people should take a cold shower with regard to</p>
<p>   the Australians training in Dubai as wharfies?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, for the obvious reason that we have a simple situation that</p>
<p>   we have laws in this country. If people want to start any stevedoring</p>
<p>   activities, they have to be within the law. And all this talk about</p>
<p>   guns and thugs and so forth is ridiculous. And it's coming</p>
<p>   from people, incidentally, who are involved, some of them, at least</p>
<p>   in an emotional sense, they were involved in that attack on Parliament</p>
<p>   last year. I mean, the only violence I've seen on the industrial</p>
<p>   scene in Australia in recent years was that attempt to bash down</p>
<p>   the front door of Parliament House after having listened to a speech</p>
<p>   from Kim Beazley, Cheryl Kernot and Jennie George.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Finally, Prime Minister, the republicans appear to be out-polling</p>
<p>   the monarchists in early counting of the postal ballots almost three</p>
<p>   to two. Are you surprised?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I'm not. I thought that would be the case. You always,</p>
<p>   particularly in a voluntary voting situation, those who are satisfied</p>
<p>   with the status quo are more likely to be disinterested. But I expected</p>
<p>   the republicans to do better in this ballot. What I want now is</p>
<p>   the focus to be turned to the convention itself.</p>
<p>What must be done at the convention is an attempt by all participants</p>
<p>   to sort out what is the republican alternative to the present arrangement.</p>
<p>   We all know the present system. We all know that when a vote is</p>
<p>   finally taken on this issue, people can vote in favour of the present</p>
<p>   system. But at this stage we de present</p>
<p>   system. But at this stage we don't know what the alternative</p>
<p>   is. And what I want everybody at that convention to do, whether</p>
<p>   they are republican or anti-republican, is to focus on working out</p>
<p>   the alternative so that in the not too distant future we can have</p>
<p>   a vote on this issue and find out where the Australian public really</p>
<p>   stands.</p>
