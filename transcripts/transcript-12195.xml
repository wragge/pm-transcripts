I am pleased to announce that $1 million from the Tough on Drugs Diversion Programme will be used to fund a new project to address petrol sniffing in the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>The Diversion Programme is the result of the 1999 agreement between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories to fund and implement early intervention diversion initiatives to address drug abuse.</p>
<p>The impact and spread of petrol sniffing and other inhalant abuse are of major concern in the Northern Territory. Sniffing has devastating and long-term repercussions for the health and welfare of the people involved, their families and communities and ultimately the wider society.</p>
<p>The petrol sniffing initiative will focus on developing practical measures such as education through youth activities, sport and recreation, community awareness, night patrols, counselling, detoxification, and management of related health problems.</p>
<p>The project will be developed at the grass roots level in conjunction with communities, community organisations and the northern territory government and will link in with existing programmes and services.</p>
<p>The initiative will commence with an initial pilot programme in the Top End with funding of $150,000 and, subject to successful evaluation, will be extended to other areas of identified need. This funding will provide the basis for long-term preventative strategies to resist the uptake of petrol sniffing in communities in Northern Territory.</p>
<p>This is a very positive step to help break the cycle of inhalant abuse and related health and social problems that threaten the future of so many young Indigenous people in the Territory.</p>
