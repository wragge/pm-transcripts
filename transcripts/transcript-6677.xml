PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGO UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIM4E MINISTER<br />
" CONVENTIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION" s<br />
BRISBANE 29 JULY 1985<br />
Distinguished Delegates,<br />
It has always struck me that, while our Constitution<br />
sets down many of the elements of our political system,<br />
there is also a large number of basic points which doF<br />
not appear in the written document.<br />
These unwritten ' principles and practices' are<br />
nonetheless widely accepted and supported by long<br />
-precedent and are understood as important by tbae<br />
Australian people.<br />
Indeed some of these conventions are of quite<br />
fundamnental significance and have greater moment than<br />
some of the detailed points that appear in the[<br />
Constitution itself.<br />
I am sure, for example, that many Australians would not<br />
realise that there is no mention of the following points<br />
in the Constitution:<br />
the Prime Minister must have the confidence of the<br />
House of Representatives;<br />
the Governor-General appoints Ministers on the<br />
advice of the Prime Minister;<br />
the Governor-General dissolves the Parliament on<br />
the advice of the Prime Minister.<br />
The founding fathers simply assumed such basic points[<br />
without spelling them out in the Constitution. In at<br />
least one case it has subsequently become necessary to<br />
adopt it explicitly. In 1977 the Australian people had<br />
the good sense to write into the Constitution, by way of<br />
referendum, the practice that a casual vacancy in the </p>
<p>Senate was to be filled by a replacement of the same<br />
political party.<br />
If we were writing the Constitution today, I believe<br />
that many of the principles and practices we are now<br />
considering would have been included.<br />
However, even short of constitutional amendment, I<br />
believe that there is considerable value in setting<br />
principles and practices down.<br />
If they are set down and endorsed by this Convention<br />
they would likely be even more persuasive in the future<br />
than they are at present. Our political life, and as a<br />
consequence our econcmic and social life would gain<br />
accordingly. The endorsement of principles and practices will also<br />
help to make them more widely known and understood.<br />
This greater understanding would in itself increase<br />
their persuasive effect.<br />
The last session of the Convention in Adelaide endorsed<br />
a number of principles and practices relating to the<br />
Appointment of the* Governor-General and the composition<br />
and operaLion of the Executive Council.<br />
The principles that we are examining today go to the<br />
centre of our system of Government. They cover:<br />
the appointment of the Prime Minister;<br />
the appointment and termination of appointment of<br />
other Ministers;<br />
the dissolution of the Hou'se of Representatives;<br />
double dissolutions;<br />
the summoning and proroguing of Parliament;<br />
joint sittings;<br />
referendums.<br />
With one qualification, the Commonwealth Government<br />
supports these principles and practices as formulated.<br />
These principles relate especially to the respective<br />
roles of the Governor-General and the Prime Minister.<br />
They are based on the principle that the Governor-<br />
General acts on the advice of the Prime Minister. This<br />
principle recognises that responsibility is taken by the<br />
person who is accountabie to the electorate. This is<br />
t. 4 t. </p>
<p>basic to Australia's democratic traditions. It is very<br />
important trat this should be hiyhliyhted. Failure to<br />
obsurve it will inevitably result in the office of<br />
Governor-General becoming involved in political<br />
controversy. Such a result can only lead to that office<br />
being weakened in the eyes of many Australians and our<br />
political stability being threatened.<br />
I would note that principle R restates the classic<br />
formulation of the Governor-General's right to be<br />
consulted, to encourage, and to warn in respect of any<br />
ministerial advice given to him. I would note also in<br />
this context thac. the principles do not cover the<br />
question of the possible dismissal of a Prime Minister.<br />
We are still clearly not agreed on this question.<br />
The Government's only qualification regarding the<br />
principles and practices now before this convention<br />
relates to principle F. The effect of that practice is<br />
that if the Government of the day is defeated in the<br />
House of Representatives, the Prime Minister should<br />
advise the Governor-General to send for an alternative<br />
Prime Minister if one is available. While I consider<br />
that this is a good general rule, there may be occasions<br />
where an election is desirable, despite the availability<br />
of such a person.<br />
Apart from the basic principles relating to the timing<br />
of elections, some of the lesser points surrounding them<br />
also merit careful consideration. I have in mind:<br />
Practice L. Advice from the Prime Minister to the<br />
Governor-General relating to an election should be<br />
in writing and it is desirable that it be published<br />
during the election campaign.<br />
Practice M. In advising a dissolution of the<br />
Parliament, the Prime Minister must be in a<br />
position to assure the Governor-General that the<br />
Parliament has made available sufficient funds to<br />
carry through the election period.<br />
I would also note Practice 32 endorsed at Adelaide under<br />
which no new initiatives are taken or appointments made<br />
during the election period unless they are essential in<br />
the national interest. Practice 33, namely'that State<br />
action in relation to the timing of Senate elections is<br />
to be co-ordinated with Commonwealth election timing,<br />
also makes a good deal of sense.<br />
I commend the Structure of Government Sub-Committee on<br />
the preparation of these principles and practices. The<br />
Sub-Committee has been diligent in searching out<br />
precedents. It has adopted the sensible approach of </p>
<p>4<br />
making recommendations only where teeis clear<br />
precedent or broad political igreement.<br />
If this Convention gives them a strong vote of support,<br />
I am sure that the predictability, the stability and<br />
good order of our system of Government will be enhanced. </p>
