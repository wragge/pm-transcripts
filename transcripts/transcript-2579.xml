FOR PRESS: PM. No 44/ 1972.<br />
IMMI GRAT ION<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. William<br />
McMahon, C. H. M. P.<br />
The basis of the Government's irmiaration Policy has<br />
been stated time and again. It is the one that will be adhered<br />
to in the administration of Government policy. It is the one that<br />
counts. I re-state it now.<br />
First of all the aim of inmmigration policy remains the<br />
preservation in Australia of an essentially homogeneous society.<br />
That means a society that does not have permanent minorities of<br />
people with extremely different backgrounds that will resist<br />
integration in the long-term. We want one Australian People, one<br />
Australian nation. This is no racist policy based on bigotry or Prejudice.<br />
On the contrary it is a policy having the valid social objective<br />
Of preventing the frictions and tensions which can come from<br />
permanent enclaves and a divided nation.<br />
Of course such a policy has not prevented and will not<br />
prevent the entry of people of widely different backgrounds. But<br />
the policy d1oes stipulate a necessity -for prudent caution as to the<br />
volume and type of migration, with emphasis on the ability of<br />
individual migrants to become integrated or assimilated into our<br />
Australian society, within one generation at most.<br />
In each of the last three years, over 9,000 people of<br />
non-European or partly non-European descent have been allowed to<br />
settle in Australia in pursuance of the policy I have stated. All<br />
the evidence points to their having been industrious and successful<br />
and to their having had no real p~ roblems of settlement. Obviously<br />
the policy and its admrinistration have been successful.<br />
