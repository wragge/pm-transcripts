Twelve months ago I accepted an invitation to travel to<br />
Brisbane for a Breakfast sponsored by UNIFEM to mark<br />
International Women's Day 1990.<br />
I did travel to Brisbane but not, as it turned out, to<br />
attend Breakfast with you. Instead, 8 March was the day on<br />
which I launched my Government's campaign for re-election.<br />
Let me take ' this opportunity to apologise in person for<br />
whatever inconvenience was caused by my cancelling that<br />
engagement, -and let me tell you how good it is to meet you<br />
at last. My colleague the Minister assisting me for the<br />
Status of Women, Wendy Fatin, is also here today, and I know<br />
she welcomes, as do I, the chance to meet with UNIFEM<br />
organisers and members, and with such a large group of<br />
Brisbane people celebrating International Women's Day.<br />
International. Women's Day provides a good opportun44; y to<br />
applaud the many and varied achievements of Australian women,<br />
goals they have attained for themselves and for this<br />
country. It is worth noting at the outset another recent first for<br />
Australian women.<br />
Australian women serving on board the supply ship<br />
" Westralia" during the Gulf crisis carried out vital<br />
communications, technical and other roles and they<br />
continue to -perform them now. This is the first time in our<br />
history that Australian servicewomen have performed combat<br />
related duties in a combat zone a significant development.<br />
At the same time, Australian nurses also played an important<br />
role in providing medical services. </p>
<p>As I said in Parliament this week, all Australians can be<br />
proud of the dedication, professionalism and courage shown<br />
by all our forces during their hazardous duties in the Gulf.<br />
We look forward to having them all home again as soon as<br />
possible, when their task is complete.<br />
Every year since 1910 women have used International Women's<br />
Day to celeb: rate their achievements and to acknowledge the<br />
struggles yet to be won.<br />
In Australia, there has been much to celebrate.<br />
Internationally, we have been at the forefront of the<br />
development of policies and programs aimed at the<br />
advancement of women. From 1902 when the enactment of the<br />
Commonwealth Franchise Act gave women the right to vote and<br />
stand for office in Federal elections, through the<br />
establishment of the female basic wage in 1949, to the<br />
adoption of the National Agenda for Women as Government<br />
policy in 1988, Australia has been a world leader in<br />
advancing the status of women.<br />
Since my Government took office in 1983, our commitment to<br />
improving conditions for Australian women has been constant,<br />
and it has been effective.<br />
This commitment was underlined last month when the inaugural<br />
meeting of the Commonwealth-State Ministers responsible for<br />
the Status of Women referred a paper detailing women's<br />
interests to the body responsible for the oversight of the<br />
current review of Commonwealth-State functions.<br />
Ultimately the test of a Government's commitment is not what<br />
it sets out to do but what it really achieves. That is why<br />
I look with very great satisfaction not only on particular<br />
programs that we have initiated for the advancement of the<br />
status of women important as they are but on the<br />
evidence of underlying improvements in the opportunities<br />
available for women throughout society.<br />
For example: School retention rates for girls have increased from 44<br />
per cent in 1983 to 70 per cent;<br />
the percentage of women in higher education is 55 per<br />
cent -up from 46 per cent in 1983;<br />
women's participation in the labour force is at 52 per<br />
cent compared to 45 per cent in 1983;<br />
of the 1.6 million new jobs created in the economy<br />
since 1983, 58 per cent have been taken up by women.<br />
These workforce figures reflect, in part, my Government's<br />
strong commitment to accessible, affordable child care. The<br />
provision of affordable, quality child care is crucial to<br />
enabling many women's full participation in the workforce. </p>
<p>Since coming to office, we have dramatically expanded the<br />
number of available child care places. By 1996, there will<br />
be over a quarter of a million places available Australiawide<br />
under the Commonwealth child care strategy.<br />
A new fee relief system assists low and middle income<br />
families to gain access to the services.<br />
The Government is committed to further increases in the<br />
supply of child care in co-operation with States, local<br />
government, community organisations, the commercial sector<br />
and employers.<br />
Fundamental to the right to work, is the right to be paid a<br />
fair wage. In comparison with other OECD countries,<br />
Australia has one of the lowest wage differentials between<br />
men and women. But it is still true that on average,<br />
Australian women earn less than half the over-award payments<br />
of men, which in turn constitutes a significant part of the<br />
17 per cent gap between male and female average weekly<br />
ordinary time earnings. The Federal Sex Discrimination<br />
Commissioner is to launch an inquiry into whether sex<br />
discrimination has been partly to blame for these inequities<br />
in award payments.<br />
My Friends,<br />
To mark International Women's Day, Federal Cabinet recently<br />
approved a package of initiatives designed to build on the<br />
progress we have made as a community in advancing the status<br />
of women.<br />
The first of these addresses the growing community concern<br />
about the level of child abuse in our society, and the<br />
urgent need for preventive measures. This was reflected in<br />
the consultations which led up to-the National Agenda for<br />
Women. Cabinet decided to allocate $ 1.2 million over three years<br />
for the establishment of a National Child Protection Council<br />
to co-operate with State and Territory initiatives a ' nd coordinate<br />
activities associated with child protectiox.<br />
The Council will focus the attention of all levels of<br />
Government and the community on the need to reduce the<br />
incidence of physical and sexual assault of children and<br />
assist in the development of strategies to do so, for<br />
example by investigating possibilities for uniform<br />
legislation. I am also pleased to announce the establishment of the Prime<br />
Ministerial Women and Sports Promotion Awards, including an<br />
award for media coverage which recognises and encourages<br />
support for women's achievements. Last week's Equity for<br />
Women in Sport Conference held in Canberra served to<br />
underline the importance of taking action in this area.<br />
Other initiatives are </p>
<p>the extension of the Commonwealth/ State Council on<br />
Non-English Speaking Background Women's Issues for a<br />
further three years to mid 1994; and<br />
the development of a Statement on Women and the<br />
Environment<br />
A separate statement is being issued which provides more<br />
details of these and other developments.<br />
My Friends,<br />
Life is changing for the better for Australian women.<br />
Opportunities are available here because, over the decades,<br />
Australian women and Australian governments have worked in<br />
partnership to develop them.<br />
Sadly, but realistically, we must recognise that for women<br />
in many parts of the world, the road to equality of<br />
opportunity is long and troubled.<br />
Throughout the world, organisations such as UNIFEM are<br />
working hard to help women travel this road. UNIFEM has a<br />
fine record in changing women's lives for the better.<br />
Through development programs which emphasise long-range<br />
planning, education, entrepreneurship and creative problemsolving,<br />
UNIFEM is expanding the opportunities available to<br />
women in developing countries.<br />
In Australia, this National Committee of UNIFEM, of which I<br />
am proud to be patron, has been formally in existence only a<br />
relatively short time.<br />
During its first months of operation UNIFEM Australia raised<br />
some $ 12,000 from private and corporate donations. These<br />
funds are to be used for the UNIFEM/ World YWCA/ AIDAB project<br />
underway in the South Pacific aimed at promoting advocacy<br />
and participation of women in development at the grassroots<br />
level. It gives me great pleasure to present this cheque t<br />
UNIFEM's Goodwill Ambassador, Phoebe Asiyo, today.' May it<br />
be the first of many to be raised by UNIFEM Australia for<br />
the advancement of women in the region. 1 </p>
