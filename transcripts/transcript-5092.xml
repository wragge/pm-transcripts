FOR ME D IA SUNDAY, 1 JULY 1979<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
One way or another we are a. 1l affected by the worldwide<br />
energy shortage. Fuel shortages and rising oil prices hit<br />
business, farmners, motorists, home owners, factories. Nobcd;<br />
escapes. At the moment governments around -the world are wrestling ih<br />
the problent of how to stretch a dwindling and preciousrecc.<br />
Demand is outstripping supply.<br />
In Australia we Ihave a firmly established energy pJrograLL.--e czni<br />
during the weak Kevin Newman and myself announcad major<br />
new initiatives, buildina on that policy. Aastralia' s entUra-. y<br />
policy is an example -to the world bocause it gets to the<br />
hoart ofI., the nrbe; and that is, -_ avirig a reali,-' Ci~ c j.<br />
for crude oil.<br />
The choice is simple. Either we pay a realistic price o-* i . o:<br />
get acces; -to adequate sunplies. This week we reaffirm--ed u<br />
commitzment to whbat is called imiport parity pricing for dComzZ*__ Ic<br />
crude oi: l. Countries -without suchl a policy cart hardlyV 7in.:<br />
have art ernerqy policy at all. Without such a i ric: ing polio-.<br />
there is no way rational use can be made of energjy resou-re;.<br />
W1. hat would be the incentive to conserve fuel? What would~ b; e<br />
the incentive -to search for oil? A major ene~ rgy consum er<br />
like the United States has a lower than realistic prnc-1,---en v<br />
use more than t heir f: air share of' a finite worvld resourc:<br />
Therefore, until the United States goes -to worldl parity riw<br />
an important part of the world problem cannot be overcoa~ a.<br />
That is not only our view, but one I believe t~ hat would be<br />
shared in Europe and in Japan.<br />
Wle have been prepared to grasp the rnc tla: and lok L theI r Zs: 6 -1<br />
Pricinq policie&amp; s we have -introduced have already incre-ased ouLr<br />
economically recoverable oil reserves by some' 6O~ r to 700:! dlicn~:~<br />
and revitalized oil search and exploration activity.<br />
Demand for oil throughout the world is outstripping supply.<br />
This is the critical point. There is a worldwide shortage of a. Dout<br />
2 million barrels a day. That gives us a fair idea of t1he<br />
macnitudle of the problem. Clearly then, countries need ~ lc.<br />
that encourage use of alternative forms of energy and roic<br />
that malke ti-eir own supplies of fuels last as long as oiz<br />
That is the crux of the initiativ, es anncluncecI last weekC.<br />
Australia's ent-rgy policy offers tangible incentive for,-all o2<br />
to usa di; fferent*-forftis of nry We havc abundant reserveE; o:<br />
natural gas. 11-o have vast coa. reserves. We are 70 percer-: L<br />
self-suffi. ci. en,, . i oil. TIt is up to us to use these resve<br />
in a son--ible and economnic-waIy That is what. we are excura </p>
<p>2<br />
The steps the. Government announced this week are both imagi. rati-.-<br />
and practical. They give the highost priority to conserving<br />
liquid fuels used in motor transport. I noticed one newspaper.<br />
this week whLich read: " Government Goes for Gas". Perhaps than<br />
is not too much of an exaggeration.<br />
We are actively promoting wider use of LPG fuelled engines.<br />
the removal of the 15 percent sales tax from the conversion unit<br />
there is now a real incentive for motorists to switch from<br />
petrol to LPG. The Government has given the lead by its decisio:<br />
to switch our fleet to LPG wherever feasible. More than 500<br />
Commonwealth vehicles will be running on LPG by 1.980.<br />
Ultimately, up to 15 percent of Australia's motor vehicles co-ld<br />
be powered by gas. It is just plain commonsense.<br />
The decision tnhis week to re: ove the tax of about 2 ceiis : cr<br />
litre presently charged on LPG will mean that LPG is now less<br />
than half the cost of petrol. Take a simple example. A Melbourne<br />
taxi driver can now convert his cab to LPG for something unde:<br />
$ 700 and cover the cost of that conversion within a matter<br />
of months. From then on, his fuel bill is halved.<br />
Every encouragement is being given to LPG suppliers to increase<br />
the number of outlet points. With the co-operation of the-<br />
States and car manufacturers I believe we can conserve up to<br />
nearly 10 percent of our petrol usage. That is a most signiica:-t<br />
saving in the current situation.<br />
Home heating is another area where, as a nation, we can save<br />
oil. All non-fuel space heating appliances used for hous-hol..<br />
purposes and all solar appliances are now exempt from sales ta:.<br />
We hope this will encourage householders to move away from<br />
the now expensive and rare oil heating.<br />
The Government has also taken steps to encourage greater use<br />
of natural gas. The Pipeline Authority will build a 12-inch<br />
pipeline to link the Bass Strait and Cooper Basin gas deposits,<br />
providing an eastern gas pipeline grid.<br />
The Government energy programme has faced reality. We have. ta-. r:<br />
the hard decisions on pricing. Yet at the same time we have<br />
put forward solutions to the problems of conserving fuel an:-<br />
to encouraging alternative energy use. This is a national<br />
problem. The consequences are too great for this nation's<br />
future for political point-scoring or carping criticism.<br />
When there is so much at stake a wholehearted national cor. mu. it.<br />
effort is required, a sense of nationalpurpose. I've no<br />
doubt Australians everywhere understand what we are trying<br />
to achieve.<br />
We all need to start taking conscious decisions about saving<br />
energy. I am sure we have the will, and the commonsense, to<br />
each play a part in meeting our national obligations in an<br />
energy hungry world. 000---</p>
