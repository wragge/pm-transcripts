MEDIA RELEASE AUSTRALIAN4 EQUITY IN DEVELOPMENT OF<br />
NORWICH PARK COAL, PROJECT<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister and Minister for<br />
National Resources and Overseas Trade, The Rt.<br />
Hon. J. D. Anthony, M. P.<br />
I welcome the announcement by Utah Development Company and<br />
Mitsubishi Development Pty Ltd of the agreement under which the<br />
Australian Mutual Provident Society and Utah Mining Australia<br />
Limited will become participants in the Central Queensland Coal<br />
Associates after a final decision is made to proceed with the<br />
Norwich Park project.<br />
Earlier this year the Commonwealth Government agreed to<br />
the Norwich Park coking coal project proceeding on the basis of<br />
Australian interests having a 55% equity in the project or an<br />
equivalent interest in Utah's interests in the combined operations<br />
of C. Q. C. A.<br />
The A. M. P. Society and U. M. A. L. have elected to take the<br />
latter route, which includes the-development of the $ 2140 mill~ ion<br />
Norwich Park project.<br />
This will have the effect of lifting the Australian equity.<br />
to around 20% in the whole of the C. Q. C. A. operations, as<br />
compared with the present level of 9.2% in the existing Goonyella,<br />
Peak Downs and Saraji coking coal projects.<br />
The Government's foreign investment guidelines are designed<br />
to give Australians an opportunity to participate as fully and<br />
effectively as possible in the development of our natural resources.<br />
Those guidelines are proving to be realistic and flexible.<br />
The agreement between the A. M. P. Society and U. M. A. L. so soon<br />
after the Government's agreement on appropriate equity levels,<br />
demonstrates that local capital is available and that Australian<br />
companies and institutions are prepared to invest in the development<br />
of our natural resources.<br />
The sensible application of the guidelines, and Utah's<br />
response, means that Australians now have the opportunity for<br />
greater ownership of Australia's most profitable company, and one<br />
which seems likely to continue to have a high rate of earnings for<br />
some years ahead.<br />
Had the foreign investment guidelines not existed*, this<br />
opportunity may not have~ become available.<br />
I hope the investment by the A. M. P. Society will prove to<br />
be a very good one for the Society and its very large number of<br />
policyholders throughout Australia.<br />
