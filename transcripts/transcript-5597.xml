ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Last week, John Howard introduced new legislation into the<br />
Parliament to stamp out the gross tax avoidance schemes that<br />
have been growing up in our community. Since 1977, the Government<br />
has introduced 12 bills incorporating some 28 measures against<br />
such schemes. But what has been happening up to now is that<br />
as-soon as one scheme is stopped a new one is thought up. The<br />
new legislation is designed to prevent this from happening.<br />
Its aim is to make impossible, all versions of anti-social<br />
tax avoidance.<br />
Anyone who pays less than their fair share of tax does so at the<br />
exppnse of every other taxpayer, at the expense of every decent:<br />
member of Australian society. We believe that any person who<br />
. claims the privileges of being an Australian resident, who benefits<br />
from the services provided'by the Government and the protection<br />
of the law, mustC contribute his or her fair share by way of<br />
tax contributions.<br />
We believe that there is no real difference between the person who<br />
finds an artificial loophole to slip out of tax and the person who<br />
falsely declares his income. An anti-avoidance provision was<br />
already part of the law. However, over the years the courts had<br />
cast doubt on its meaning and its interpretation had become so<br />
narrow as to be largely ineffective against avoidance.<br />
When reasonable men can come to very different views as to what:<br />
tax avoidance is, it becomes difficult to cast-the law in terms<br />
which will strike down blatant or contrived schemes, but which will<br />
not hinder reasonable commercial or family dealings. The new<br />
legislation is expressed in terms which would eliminate schemes<br />
w~ hich-when-their circumstances and results. are objectively examnined-,<br />
have no practical ' effect other than * a reduction of tax liability.<br />
In order to ensure that people who still think they can get away<br />
with avoidance are not taking a " one way bet" in doing so, the<br />
legislation provides for penalty tax equal to twice the amount of<br />
tax sought to be avoided.<br />
This approach, and the Bill itself, is the result of long and<br />
careful study, not only by Departmental officers and by Parliamentary<br />
counsel, but also by private legal counsel and the Taxation<br />
Advisory Committee. We sought and welcomed constructive comments<br />
on the provisions of the Bill. / 2<br />

<p>-2-<br />
At the same time, we have introduced legislation which requires the<br />
courts to have regard to the intention of the law rather than<br />
solely to the fine points of language. It is our hope that the<br />
decisions of courts will accept the spirit of this taxation<br />
legislation rather than just relying on the letter. It is a matter<br />
of great regret that it is necessary for legislation to be used<br />
to stamp out tax cheating. For if all taxpayers accepted their<br />
responsibility to the whole community, if they accepted that they<br />
should pay what is justly required of them to provide public<br />
services, we would not need to devote part of the community's<br />
resources to seeking out the tax cheats, to the time consuming<br />
process of framing laws.<br />
Because some people get away with paying less than their fair share!<br />
of tax, but are still consuming public services paid for by the<br />
rest of us, the tax burden on the decent, responsible taxpayer is<br />
higher than it otherwise would be. The cost to the community of<br />
tax avoidance is not measured. simply by how much more tax the<br />
