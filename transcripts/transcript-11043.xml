    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE............</p>
<p>  Ladies and Gentlemen, the retreat finished this afternoon and you have a</p>
<p>   copy of the declaration that was issued out of it. There's a very strong</p>
<p>   emphasis in that Declaration on the importance of improving access for all</p>
<p>   countries in the forthcoming World Trade Organisation discussions in Seattle</p>
<p>   and the generation of any new round, particularly greater access for developing</p>
<p>   countries and that, of course, is very much what Australia wants. It remains</p>
<p>   our very strong view that the forthcoming Ministerial meeting in Seattle</p>
<p>   must produce a new round, where everything's on the table, agriculture as</p>
<p>   well as industrial products and services, and we'll continue to push very</p>
<p>   strongly for that between now and at the Ministerial meeting in Seattle.</p>
<p>  The rest of the discussion today revolved around a number of, I guess, constitutional</p>
<p>   things. There was a very lengthy discussion on Pakistan and there's a very</p>
<p>   great level of concern about the military coup d'etat in that country and</p>
<p>   the suspension of Pakistan from the Councils of the Commonwealth continues</p>
<p>   with a monitoring of the situation by the CEMAG group, that is the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   Ministerial Action Group, with a view to further steps being taken in relation</p>
<p>   to Pakistan's membership of the Commonwealth if the situation does not alter.</p>
<p>  I should also mention that Australia will become consequent upon Mr McKinnon's</p>
<p>   election as Secretary-General, the Commonwealth of Australia will become</p>
<p>   in the person of Mr Downer, a member of CEMAG. Mr Downer will replace Mr</p>
<p>   McKinnon. It was also decided today that there would be a review - given</p>
<p>   that it's 10 years since a similar review took place - of the workings of</p>
<p>   the Commonwealth and Australia is going to be one of the members of the</p>
<p>   group of nations that will be undertaking a review of the operations of</p>
<p>   the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>  There are, I think, ten members out of the total membership of the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   on that review group and Australia along with countries from - reflecting</p>
<p>   a proper geographical spread of the Commonwealth membership - will be on</p>
<p>   that group.</p>
<p>  The retreat, of course, provides as always at these meetings an opportunity</p>
<p>   for, as well as the formal session, a number of bilateral discussions in</p>
<p>   an informal atmosphere. I should mention that I had the opportunity of a</p>
<p>   discussion with</p>
<p>  President Mbeki about the progress that South Africa is making in its new</p>
<p>   and improved dispensation and I expressed the view to him that considering</p>
<p>   the enormous challenges that the country faces that a great deal of progress</p>
<p>   is being made. I have to say that he impresses me as an extremely intelligent,</p>
<p>   committed, able leader of this country and someone who is following very</p>
<p>   effectively in the footsteps of Nelson Mandela. - necessarily a different</p>
<p>   person, coming with different gifts and from a different vantage point,</p>
<p>   but I found him to be a highly intelligent and effective chairman of the</p>
<p>   group and given the enormous challenges that South Africa necessarily faces,</p>
<p>   given her history, he presents, I think, a very reassuring presence not</p>
<p>   only to his own country, but also to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>  I would be happy to answer any questions.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, would you claim the trade outcome as a win and what did</p>
<p>   you have to do to get the States that were less keen on open trade to come</p>
<p>   across on it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I think the clinching argument for anybody on this is that it's all</p>
<p>   about access and the only way in which poverty will be alleviated in any</p>
<p>   country or any group of countries is through a number of steps, one of which</p>
<p>   is to get the greatest amount of access for the products of that country</p>
<p>   in the markets of the world. If globalisation is to mean anything to the</p>
<p>   poor countries of the world, it must mean that those countries have greater</p>
<p>   access for their products in the markets of the richer countries and it</p>
<p>   seems to me to be elementary and basic that if you want to improve the living</p>
<p>   standards of the least developed countries in the world, you must improve</p>
<p>   access. No matter what else you do, and necessarily of course, the right</p>
<p>   domestic economic policies have got to be followed and I found it very reassuring</p>
<p>   to hear for example from the President of Uganda, a country that has gone</p>
<p>   through incredible pain, both politically, socially and economically over</p>
<p>   the last 20 years, speak eloquently at the conference of the importance</p>
<p>   of private sector investment and of the tragedy of many of the Asian businessmen</p>
<p>   and women being chased out of that country by Idi Amin and what grievous</p>
<p>   damage the loss of entrepreneurial flair and skill did to the economy and</p>
<p>   the social structure of that country and that was to me very reassuring</p>
<p>   that there is such a stark recognition of the importance of the private</p>
<p>   sector, the importance of capital investment, the importance of getting</p>
<p>   ones domestic house in order. He made the point that in 1965 Uganda was</p>
<p>   only that far behind South Korea as far as per capita GDP was concerned,</p>
<p>   but in the 34 years that have gone by since then an absolute chasm has opened</p>
<p>   between those two countries and he was candid and realistic enough to say</p>
<p>   that was largely due to domestic mistakes that his country had made. And</p>
<p>   what I guess I'm saying is to lift countries like Uganda and many of the</p>
<p>   poorer and less developed nations of Africa and the rest of the Commonwealth,</p>
<p>   you need two things - you need the right domestic policies and that is in</p>
<p>   the control of the leaders of those countries, but you also need to give</p>
<p>   them access. And I guess if the World Trade ministerial meeting cares at</p>
<p>   all about the less developed countries they'll give them access.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, do you think that because of their relative lack of power</p>
<p>   the developing nations do have more problems in terms of gaining market</p>
<p>   access than a country like Australia and if so, are there concrete steps</p>
<p>   that can be taken to assist them in their plight?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, Jim, as you know everything's relative. We might have more clout than,</p>
<p>   in terms of economic strength, than many other countries but that hasn't</p>
<p>   bent the common agricultural policy as much as I would have liked it bent</p>
<p>   over the last 20 or 30 years. But I think the advantage of a meeting like</p>
<p>   this is to drive home to a country like Australia and also to the less developed</p>
<p>   countries that are also like Australia wanting to export things like agricultural</p>
<p>   produce that we have a common cause. And the Cairns group is, in another</p>
<p>   context, is a manifestation of that and we do have a common cause.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  So, Mr Howard, isn't the problem less the developing countries and more</p>
<p>   the European countries therefore what was Britain's attitude on the question</p>
<p>   of more access and especially on agriculture?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, they didn't raise any objections. I didn't hear any objections from</p>
<p>   Mr Blair.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Are you hopeful then that Britain having put its name to this declaration</p>
<p>   that Britain will work behind the scenes to convince Europe to open up the</p>
<p>   trade barriers?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I am not saying that. I mean, I am an old campaigner when it comes</p>
<p>   to access into the European Union. You have heard my remarks on that. But,</p>
<p>   look, we got a declaration. I think it's good, I really do think it's a</p>
<p>   good declaration. And if you can get a group of nations as broadly based</p>
<p>   and as diverse as the Commonwealth countries including, you know, four or</p>
<p>   five nations which by any measure are amongst the better off nations of</p>
<p>   the world and that, of course, includes Australia, going right through to</p>
<p>   some of the very poorest. If you can get them all agreeing on some principles</p>
<p>   I hope that will help to make a difference. But the sharp end of it all,</p>
<p>   the business end of it will be when we get to the ministerial meeting and</p>
<p>   a lot, of course, will depend as it always does at these gatherings on the</p>
<p>   determination of the United States and the attitude of the European Union</p>
<p>   and also the attitude of the Japanese.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  So Mr Blair didn't make any contribution on this at all?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, Mr Blair made.I mean, he can speak for himself but all I am saying</p>
<p>   is that the declaration was not, sort of, rung out of anybody, the declaration</p>
<p>   was quite formally supported by everybody.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Does that mean the Commonwealth will now speak as one voice.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No, I don't think it means that, it just means that at this particular meeting</p>
<p>   the leaders of the 54, is it, members of the Commonwealth were willing to</p>
<p>   put their name to some broad principles about trade and I think that is</p>
<p>   a help. I mean, everything helps a bit in something like trying to get greater</p>
<p>   access to world markets. It's been a long struggle, I don't expect everything</p>
<p>   to be achieved at Seattle but it's very important that we keep the momentum</p>
<p>   going.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Were there any proposals for specific internal or intra Commonwealth trade?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, you foreshadowed an initiative of some sort at the end of</p>
<p>   the retreat, are you in a position to tell us what it is?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I'll be announcing tomorrow a number of measures in relation to our</p>
<p>   financial contribution to a number of the Commonwealth agencies that we</p>
<p>   are going to increase by 10 per cent a year our contribution to the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   fund for technical development. We are also going to renew our three year</p>
<p>   commitment to the fund that we established at the Edinburgh meeting and</p>
<p>   we'll also be providing some additional financial support for the training</p>
<p>   of people in trade negotiations which will be of particular value to some</p>
<p>   of the less developed countries.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  And what sort of dollars are involved here?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I think you are looking in relation to the first an increase of something</p>
<p>   like $7.2 million to almost $10 million. And the second about $1.5 million</p>
<p>   and the third a lesser sum than that, less than half a million.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard, did President Mbeke take up your invitation to visit Australia?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, my understanding is that it's, sort of, under active consideration.</p>
<p>   I think there's some discussions going on about an appropriate time.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Did you put it to him though?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I put it to him earlier.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard, you mentioned the absence of Chief Anyaoku as perhaps a problem</p>
<p>   for Australia in its window to Africa..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Absence of.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  His departure as Commonwealth Secretary-General as being a problem for Australia</p>
<p>   getting access to Africa.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No, I don't remember, when did I say that?</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Oh, you just indicated that having an African as Commonwealth Secretary-General.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I don't think I said that. I mean, if I did say that I shouldn't have</p>
<p>   but I don't think I did. And I don't think I have said anything that was</p>
<p>   meant to convey that. I mean, he has done a very good job. I think what</p>
<p>   I was trying to say, Dennis, the other day was that one of the great advantages</p>
<p>   of the Commonwealth is that it gives Australia a window into Africa that</p>
<p>   we wouldn't otherwise have. My recollection is that that is what I said.</p>
<p>   But I think the Chief has done a great job.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, why did the Government decide to impose the GST on premium</p>
<p>   tickets to the Olympics?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, because the original basis of the GST rebate was that SOCOG had no</p>
<p>   flexibility in relation to the pricing. I mean, the reason they came to</p>
<p>   us and said we have got a problem with the GST is that they said they were</p>
<p>   locked in internationally by the IOC, they had to charge a certain amount,</p>
<p>   they had no capacity to absorb it. Now, what I have said to the Premier</p>
<p>   of New South Wales is that we weren't told about the premium. See, when</p>
<p>   we agreed to provide, what, $50 million. I mean, it's no small matter. We</p>
<p>   weren't told about the premium tickets and clearly there's a capacity to</p>
<p>   absorb the GST in relation to premiums. I mean, what I have said to the</p>
<p>   Premier of New South Wales is that in relation to the ordinarily priced</p>
<p>   tickets our commitment remains that there will be a GST rebate. But in relation</p>
<p>   to the premium tickets we see no reason why it can't be recouped from the</p>
<p>   people who buy the tickets. It seems to me to be an unreasonable imposition</p>
<p>   on the rest of the Australian taxpayers. And can I just clear one other</p>
<p>   thing up, this decision was taken before the referendum. I saw in a clipping.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  So you wrote to the Premier before the referendum?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, the decision was taken. I forget when I was signed the letter. It</p>
<p>   may have been the day before or the day of, I just don't know, but the decision</p>
<p>   was taken. And any suggestion that there's some kind of payback in relation</p>
<p>   to people raising the question of my opening the Olympic Games that is nonsense,</p>
<p>   absolute nonsense. This decision was taken on a matter of principle. I mean,</p>
<p>   we were misled.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Why didn't you announce it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Why didn't I announce it? Well, I am trying to maintain, you know, a reasonable</p>
<p>   cooperation with the New South Wales Government.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  What about claims that it's payback for the SOCOG ticket fiasco?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Why would it be a payback? I mean, the fiasco, the difficulties that are</p>
<p>   being encountered by SOCOG, I mean, that's not something that is specifically</p>
<p>   directed at the Federal Government.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  You have been critical of the way SOCOG's handled it.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I think everybody has been, I mean, you can't not be critical of it.</p>
<p>   For heaven's sake. It is a very unfortunate situation. But, Fleur, there's</p>
<p>   a very simple principle involved. We were asked by SOCOG to rebate to them</p>
<p>   the GST or to pick up, effectively pick up the cost of the GST so they wouldn't</p>
<p>   be out of pocket. And the argument they used when they approached us was</p>
<p>   that they were obliged by the International Olympic Committee to charge</p>
<p>   a certain price and that they had no flexibility. We now find that in relation</p>
<p>   to a significant number of tickets they have a hell of a lot of flexibility.</p>
<p>   In those circumstances I can't for the life of me see why the rest of us</p>
<p>   should carry the responsibility of the GST in relation to that segment of</p>
<p>   the tickets for which they are charging a premium.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Apparently the case is that it's going to cost, that these premium ticket</p>
<p>   holders now can't be charged the extra so SOCOG is going to have to pick</p>
<p>   up the tab.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, look, we are perfectly happy to talk to SOCOG. But the principle is,</p>
<p>   and nobody should imply from that that we're changing our mind, I mean,</p>
<p>   I don't know what.if they want to talk to us we'll be very happy to talk</p>
<p>   to them.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Would you be happy to meet some of the costs if they.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, look, no, no, I am not saying.no, we are not. Look, our position is</p>
<p>   that we were misled.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Isn't there a danger though that.or a possibility that the taxpayers get</p>
<p>   hit again because if SOCOG has a shortfall it'll come back onto the taxpayers</p>
<p>   of New South Wales?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes, but there has to be a point at which the people organising the Olympic</p>
<p>   Games accept responsibility for prudent financial management and it's a</p>
<p>   good start when you ask a Federal Government to relieve you of the burden</p>
<p>   of the GST to tell them the full story. I mean, we are not happy that we</p>
<p>   were not told the full story and, I mean, we have a responsibility to the</p>
<p>   rest of the Australian community to ensure that where the GST can properly</p>
<p>   apply, can properly apply and be properly collected from people then it</p>
<p>   ought to be. I mean, we have no right in terms of our responsibility to</p>
<p>   the rest of the Australian community to say, well, it doesn't matter what</p>
<p>   price some people are paying for tickets even though we were told one thing</p>
<p>   and another thing has happened we'll just forget about that.. I mean, there</p>
<p>   has to be a point where the people who are organising this have got to accept</p>
<p>   responsibility and it's not good enough, as far as I am concerned, to say,</p>
<p>   oh well, look, there's nothing we can do about it, you know, we'll have</p>
<p>   to hit the taxpayer again. I mean, I just don't accept that first blush.</p>
<p>   If they want to talk to us well they can talk to Jackie Kelly or one of</p>
<p>   my Ministers about it, or the Treasurer. But what I said to Mr Carr was</p>
<p>   very simple. The basis of our commitment was that you, SOCOG, had no flexibility</p>
<p>   because the International Olympic Committee required you to charge a certain</p>
<p>   price and you had no flexibility. We now find, although we weren't told</p>
<p>   of it at the time, that in relation to a chunk of tickets there's a lot</p>
<p>   of flexibility. Now, I think we'd be a pretty negligent Federal Government</p>
<p>   if we just said, oh, that doesn't matter.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  The decision, just to get this clear, the decision to inform the New South</p>
<p>   Wales Government.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  That decision was taken.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  . that Cabinet.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  It was discussed at Cabinet and the decision was taken before the referendum.</p>
<p>   Now, I can't remember the exact date the letter was signed, I think it may</p>
<p>   have been.I think I may have signed it the day before. I saw some suggestion</p>
<p>   in the paper that I signed it the day of, I don't think I signed it the</p>
<p>   day.I don't remember signing any letters the day of the referendum.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Do you think this is symptomatic of a wider pattern of bad behaviour and</p>
<p>   deceptive behaviour by SOCOG..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, I am not going to extrapolate in the general from the particular.</p>
<p>   I am dealing with a very precise situation and I remain, as I have said</p>
<p>   repeatedly before, as somebody who wants to see these Olympic Games be a</p>
<p>   tremendous success. And that is in a sense one of the reasons I didn't make</p>
<p>   a huge song and dance about it when I wrote to the Premier. And it's not</p>
<p>   payback, it's in no way related to other matters. And my actions in relation</p>
<p>   to other matters were designed to take any political heat out of the conduct</p>
<p>   of the Games. But you are talking about $50 million and you are talking</p>
<p>   about perceptions of fairness about the application of the GST.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Why did you write the letter and not the Treasurer, I mean, it's obviously</p>
<p>   a tax matter? What ,you were government to government leader or something?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, you know, the normal method of communication between the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   and the States is the Prime Minister to the Premier, that's the normal method</p>
<p>   of.that's the generic method of communication and then it gets a bit more</p>
<p>   specific, then others deal with some of the details. But that's the normal</p>
<p>   way of doing it.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  On another SOCOG matter, Mr Howard what do you think of the treatment of</p>
<p>   General McCaffrey?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, he is a guest of Australia and he should be extended all courtesies.</p>
<p>   And he should be, in my view, be given all the courtesies that are properly</p>
<p>   due to a senior person in the American Administration. I don't know anything</p>
<p>   other than the story that was in The Australian on Saturday</p>
<p>   about a letter that Mr Coates, I think it is, has allegedly written. Now,</p>
<p>   I don't.I haven't seen that letter but I think the man should be given all</p>
<p>   courtesies. He's a guest.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  But you issued the invitation.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes, well, of course, I understand that. That's all the more reason why</p>
<p>   he should be treated courteously.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard, could.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  This is the very last one because you have got to feed haven't you?</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Could I just get your reaction to the release of James Peng, how much credit</p>
<p>   does the Government take for his release?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I am very pleased that it's happened. We campaigned long and hard</p>
<p>   in the framework of the human rights dialogue that we have established with</p>
<p>   the Chinese Government. You may remember a couple of years ago we decided</p>
<p>   to establish a human rights dialogue and framework for discussing particular</p>
<p>   issues and this was one of them. And, I am pleased it's happened, I don't</p>
<p>   know that I want to say much more than that. But I am glad that he is back</p>
<p>   with his family and it does demonstrate that there is a lot of constructive</p>
<p>   goodwill in the relationship between Australia and China recognising as</p>
<p>   I always say when I talk about relationship that we approach a lot of things</p>
<p>   from a different vantage point but it doesn't prevent us finding common</p>
<p>   points of agreement on certain issues and agreeing on a framework to work</p>
<p>   out some of our problems. Thank you.</p>
