PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH BARRY BISSELL~, FOX-FM, MELBOURNE<br />
26 FEBRUARY 1990.<br />
E E 0 PROOF ONLY<br />
BISSELL: It's amazing the people you get on the phone here on a<br />
Monday afternoon, I tell you. The Prime Minister of Australia,<br />
Mr Hawke, good afternoon and welcome.<br />
PM: Good afternoon Barry, thank you very much.<br />
BISSELL: You've got some good news f or us about an environmental<br />
issue which FOX-FM in Melbourne has been very concerned about<br />
for some time. We've been very conscious of the environment and<br />
working hard to make people aware of it, but you've come up with<br />
some very good news this afternoon.<br />
PM: I have indeed Barry. Your listeners will know that I've<br />
been taking the lead in trying to save the Antarctic from mining<br />
and to create a wilderness reserve, a land of science and we've<br />
been working very closely with the French in that. The big news<br />
is that today, the Government of New Zealand has decided that it<br />
is going to set aside ratifications of that convention and work<br />
with us here in Australia to achieve our objectives, so that is<br />
an enormous result. It's not only another nation has joined with<br />
us in our objective but the fact that it is New Zealand has a<br />
particular ' significance because it was there, as I say, the<br />
convention was finally drawn up. We know this for instance, it's<br />
not lust a question of the beauty and the pristine nature of the<br />
area down there but increasingly one of the environmental issues<br />
of concern around the world is the depletion of the ozone layer,<br />
the emission of greenhouse gases and the effect that has on our<br />
ocean levels and so on, and the significance of the Antarctic is<br />
that it is the one remaining area of the world untouched by human<br />
activity and industrial activity where you are able to take<br />
tests, make tests of what's happening in a way which is<br />
absolutely untainted by human and industrial activity.<br />
BISSELL: Mr Hawke, thanks for the good news. it's good to hear<br />
from you, I know you're a very busy man at the moment. It must<br />
be a fairly torturous period for you, anybody, doing<br />
campaigning, but you especially, I mean it's there all the time,<br />
isn't it. You can't get away for the next few weeks. o a o/. 2 </p>

PM: but when you get news like this it's the sort of thing<br />
that gives you a lift Barry.<br />
BISSELL: Makes it all worthwhile.<br />
PM1 Yes.<br />
BISSELL: Mr Hawke, thank you very much for your time. It's been<br />
great talking to you.<br />
PM: Thank you very much indeed.<br />
ENDS. </p>
