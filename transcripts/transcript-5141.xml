PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED: JEFF HUDDLESTONE, RADIO STATION 8HA,<br />
TALK-BACK<br />
ALICE SPRINGS<br />
Jeff Huddlestone<br />
Mr. Fraser, welcome to Alice Springs sir.<br />
Today you took a light plane journey to+' traverse ' the progress on<br />
the Tarcoola to Alice Springs railway project.<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
Yes I did. -It was a very-interesting trip because the<br />
construction was going very well. It was ahead of schedule.<br />
We had to provide additional funds either that or the work was<br />
going to have to be slowed down and that would have destroyed<br />
the efficiency of the operation. It really is something to<br />
be proud of.<br />
Huddlestone<br />
The very fact of being so far ahead of schedule, 12 months,<br />
and within its budget of $ 145 million will certainly add a<br />
great boost to the Territory, particulary when the line reaches<br />
the border in November. of this year.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It will be a boost to the Territory then, but I think it will be<br />
a better boost when it reaches Alice Springs. I imagine that will<br />
be quite a day.<br />
Huddlestone This evening you and Mrs. Fraser will be attending, along with<br />
other official guests, the launching of the Australian&amp; Fund<br />
here in Alice Springs at the Old Telegraph Station. A little of<br />
the Australiana Fund and just what that seeks to do.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It is really a private organisation which the Government has<br />
given, in a sense, tacit support to. There are four major<br />
official establishments belonging to the Commonwealth: there is<br />
Government House, Yarralumla; there is Admiralty House which is<br />
the Governor General's residence in Sydney; Kirribilli House,<br />
which I use sometimes when I am in Sydney, but which is also<br />
used for official guests of the Government and that really is<br />
the main use of it; and the Prime Minister's Lodge. Now none<br />
of these houses are personal. They don't belong to the people<br />
who are in them. They belong to the nation. But up to the time<br />
I became Prime Minister they had really been furnished according<br />
to the personal whims of the occupants of the day. ./ 2<br />
PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
I thought, and Tamie thought, that this really wasn't the<br />
best way to go about it. So we'd established an official<br />
establishments committee to look after these four residences;<br />
to make recommendations about their development, having in<br />
mind the historic background of the buildings and the occupants<br />
they have had over the years.<br />
Attached to that committee is the Australiana Fund and the<br />
people involved in that operation. The purpose is, either by<br />
money or in kind, to collect pieces of furniture or other<br />
household things, which might have had some historical<br />
significance in Australia in earlier times.<br />
The two Sydney residences have been opened to the public.<br />
Shortly Yarralumla and the Lodge will again be open to the<br />
public. This will show what is being done with the<br />
residences. They are being looked after I think much better.<br />
They belong to the nation and they should have some of<br />
Australia's history in them in pieces of furniture or<br />
paintings. We got, the other day, quite a notable portrait<br />
of the first Labor Prime Minister. It came on the market.<br />
Somebody saw it and it was made available through this<br />
particular operation. If it hadn't been started, that portrait<br />
might have just gone into limbo. It's a good portrait.<br />
We've got it hanging in the hall at the Lodge,' That is part<br />
of the life of the place. It is part of Australia's history.<br />
We have an old colonial sideboard which was discovered if<br />
Tamie was here she could tell you more of the details but<br />
it was discovered in Australia, made in about 1820 by I suppose<br />
some of the original skilled tradesmen who came to this country<br />
from the United Kingdom; made out of Australian timber, a<br />
unique Australian design. Well now for the rest of time it<br />
will be in the dining room of the Lodge. I think this is much<br />
better than having bits and pieces of no real value and no<br />
real historical significance.<br />
Huddlestoneof course it is significant in itself that the function<br />
tonight is at the Old Telegraph Station itself of great<br />
historical importance and significance to Australia and of<br />
course the Territory.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It is. It has obviously been chosen for a purpose. I think it<br />
is a very fitting location for the function. What Tamie has<br />
been trying to do especially, is to emphasise that these<br />
four residences houses do belong to the nation. They are<br />
part of the nation's history and we ought to start building up<br />
and housing some of that history in them. Therefore, there<br />
are Australiana committees in all the States and in the Territory,<br />
and this is the launching day here. ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Huddles tone<br />
And of course, Mrs. Fraser is the President of the<br />
Australiana Fund.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes. She knows much more about it than I do.<br />
Huddles tone<br />
We have a number of questions that have been ' phoned in to<br />
you this afternoon. The first one is from Pam Gardner of the<br />
Anglican Lodge here in Alice Springs.<br />
CALLER I have two questions. The first one is that there are plans<br />
for building a dam outside of Alice Springs and also in the<br />
Tennant Creek area the Mary Anne Dam and what I would<br />
like to know is if the Commonwealth can have some kind of<br />
legislation drawn up that it makes it a law that an<br />
environmental impact statement has to be made before these<br />
decisions can be decided ad hoc. An environmental statement;<br />
how it affects the people living in these areas the<br />
Aboriginal people and the white people and also to introduction<br />
of foreign bacteria that might cause ( inaudible), menengitis,<br />
or any other unknown germs that are foreign to these areas.<br />
Also, that the environmental council in Darwin, if it can have<br />
teeth to enforce this legislation. My second question is,<br />
the public hospitals in the Northern Territory seem to be<br />
understaffed with professionals and paramedical staff and<br />
I would like to know whether this is the CLP's way of letting<br />
people think that public hospitals are incompetent when really<br />
they are not. They are just understaffed and medical staff<br />
are working longer hours and consequently the public have to<br />
wait longer. I was wondering if this can be rectified also.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
These things basically ought to be referred to Territory<br />
officials and Territory Government. So far as the Commonwealth<br />
is concerned, in major capital works that we fund, we do have<br />
strict environmental laws and for any major work likely to<br />
have any significant impact on the environment, an environmental<br />
impact statement is necessary. That is taken into account.<br />
Most of the States also have equivalent provisions, but this<br />
particular one concerning dam, it would seem to me that the<br />
responsibility there lies with the Territory administration,<br />
with the Territory Government. We have quite deliberately<br />
made decisions over the last two or three years which has led<br />
to self-government in the Territory. I think that is better<br />
because I don't believe people from Canberra should make<br />
decisions for people in the Territory. But it does mean that<br />
certain matters have to be addressed to that Government.<br />
I think this is one of them. .4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
Environmental matters are important and people are right<br />
to be concerned that proper protections and courses are<br />
undertaken.<br />
On the other question you raised, the Commonwealth has been<br />
involved in hospital funding, of course, with the States,<br />
but by And large the States have determined the levels of<br />
staffing in the Northern Territory. This ' again is a matter<br />
coming under the control of the Territory Government.<br />
The actual staffing levels are not something that the<br />
Commonwealth is going to determine in the future.<br />
I had understood that the staffing levels had been pretty good<br />
in many areas. I am not making a comment now about a particular<br />
area, but in many parts of Australia hospitals have had about<br />
only a 60 per cent occupancy but they have been staffed up<br />
to 100 per cent. That is one of the reasons why the hospital<br />
costs have risen very greatly. That all comes back to how<br />
much money taxpayers have to provide.<br />
What we have been trying to do is to work out with the<br />
hospital authorities in the States arrangements which will<br />
enable the hospitals to be run as efficiently as possible<br />
without in any sense diminishing the services available to<br />
the public but doing it a bit more economically than might<br />
have been the case in the past, because an enormous part of<br />
health costs comes from the straight out hospital costs and<br />
associated facilities. It is important that they use these<br />
economically and sensibly, so long as health care is not<br />
diminished. If there is a particular instance that you would<br />
like to have looked into, I am sure Senator Kilgariff or one<br />
of th e local members would be prepared to follow that up for you.<br />
CALLER I would like to know if the Army could build the road from<br />
Adelaide to the Northern Territory border, especially as it is<br />
being classed as a military road.<br />
Prime minister<br />
Technically, some elements of the Army construction squadron<br />
will obviously have that capacity, but it has not been the<br />
practice to send Army construction squadrons to send people<br />
to do work that is expected to be done by civilians. That is<br />
a tacit agreement, or understanding, throughout Australia, and<br />
it goes back a very very long time. The north-south road needs<br />
upgrading. It takes time, but I think it would be wrong for<br />
the Army to be used in current Australian circumstances.<br />
I know Peter Nixon has been examining the national highway<br />
program around Australia. Again, one of the questions in this<br />
area of course is the extent to which the Commonwealth should<br />
determine what roads money is spent on, and the extent to<br />
which the States themselves should set priorities. We have<br />
been trying to establish the circumstance . in which States would<br />
accept responsibility within their own borders for the priorities.<br />
I think that is as it ought to be. Again, in one or two<br />
instances I know Peter Nixon has tried to persuade a State<br />
to provide additional funds. </p>
<p>CALLER My question is: the radiation levels at Narbalek are<br />
exceptionally high because of the richness of the uranium ore.<br />
I have been trying to obtain information on worker exposure<br />
for well over two months now, in which time I have been given<br />
the run-around. It now transpires that Queensland mines<br />
not only do their own monitoring, but they also do not need<br />
to release any information on this radiation level unless they<br />
so want to. Now would please ensure that monitoring is done<br />
by an independent body and that all data on worker radiation<br />
exposure be made freely available to interested members of<br />
the public.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think you are wrong in iimplying that there is any secrecy<br />
about any of this. Australia is establishing nuclear codes<br />
for the operation and safety of people working,-whether it is<br />
in mines or any sort of material that can provide radiation.<br />
That covers a wide range. It can cover medical areas. It can<br />
cover Lucas Heights. It can cover mining operations. The<br />
provisions and arrangements that Australia is making after the<br />
Royal Commission by Mr. Justice Fox are stricter I believe<br />
than in any other country of the world. There was some publicity<br />
about Narbalek sometime ago. But, I know quite well the<br />
people there are taking all proper precautions; are sticking<br />
with the requirements. There are independent authorities<br />
that monitor these things. I really believe that your concern<br />
in this particular area is quite misplaced. Our rules are<br />
very very strict indeed. Quite obviously the well-being of<br />
people working in a uranium mine, or at Lucas Heights, or in<br />
the medical area where there can be materials that can involve<br />
radiation. In any of these areas there need to be very strict<br />
provisions, and there are.<br />
CALLER<br />
The question I would like to ask is why does Darwin have<br />
greater holiday benefits and ( inaudible) or mainly<br />
greater holiday benefits on a remote area basis than Alice<br />
Springs, where Alice Springs is probably more remote than<br />
Darwin in a lot of respects as far as transport and access<br />
to coastline and Eastern States. That is my question.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The Government doesn't directly set terms and conditions for<br />
its employees, or for anyone in Australia. For general people<br />
under Federal awards, there is the Arbitration Commission and<br />
they make determinations depending on a whole range of factors;<br />
site and location can be taken into account. If it is a question<br />
of Public Service employment, then it is the Public Service<br />
Arbitrator in the Public Service machinery that can make<br />
determinations, taking into account whole range of factors. ./ 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
If people believe that there has been unequal handling of<br />
different situations, . between Alice Springs and Darwin, the<br />
normal arbitral p rocedures, the tribunals, is the appropriate<br />
way to pursue that. These things aren't left to the direct<br />
determination of governments. I don't really believe they<br />
ought to be. We've established a system of having an umpire<br />
for industrial matters and award matters. I think we should<br />
stick to the umpire. Sometimes you win out of it,-sometimes<br />
you don't, but having that third party making the judgement<br />
is a good a system as any.<br />
CALLER My husband and his brother are Lebanese and have lived here<br />
in Alice Springs. We've been , trying to bring his family to<br />
bring his family here for years and we've been having an<br />
awful lot of trouble. We get no definite answer; yes or no.<br />
Senator Kilgariff has done numerous things trying to help.<br />
We have spoken to Mr. MacKellar and we've written to the<br />
Prime Minister's office and have received only replies<br />
saying that the matter will be looked into. But this has<br />
been going on this last time now for well over a year and we<br />
are still getting replies saying the matter will be looked<br />
into. I wondered if the Prime Minister could give us any<br />
idea of anything else we could do to get a more definite<br />
answer, even if it is a no either a yes or a no.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't know the details of the case, but Senator* Kilgariff<br />
is with me and he has told me that the Minister for Immigration<br />
and Ethnic Affairs, Mr. Michael MacKellar, has in fact reviewed<br />
the case. I don't know what the position is and what the<br />
decision is, but I will be happy to speak to Mr. MacKellar<br />
about it.<br />
CALLER My question is: who is responsible for the current deplorable<br />
state of the Stuart Highway, or South Road in South Australia.<br />
Has the South Australian Government been allotted sums<br />
specificially for sealing the Stuart Highway. Also, can the<br />
Prime Minister state when Stuart, the south road, will be sealed?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The South Australian Government hasn't been allotted sums<br />
: specifically for the Stuart Highway, but it does get<br />
significant sums from the Commonwealth each year for national<br />
highways. That includes the Stuart Highway. But we have<br />
adopted the policy of providing this money to State Governments,<br />
and in this case to South Australia, and then we believe that<br />
the State Governmen ought to exert their own sensible<br />
judgement about priorities. Unfortunately, the South Australian<br />
Government has put the Stuart Highway on a very low order of<br />
priorities and therefore, without taking the question completely<br />
out of the hands of the State Government, Mr. Nixon has sought<br />
to bring a good deal of pressure to bear on the transport<br />
Minister in South Australia to provide additional sums. </p>
<p>-7<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
I think the caller is quite right. Much of the highway<br />
is in a pretty bad position. In the Commonwealth's view<br />
it ought to have been given-a higher priority rating out of<br />
the funds that are available. I know Peter Nixon has had<br />
some limited success in getting additional funds allotted,<br />
but as we are administering these road grants at the moment,<br />
and making the bulk funds available to the States, our power<br />
is a persuasive one rather than one of dictatorship.<br />
That is the way the Premiers want it. They say give us the<br />
money and let us make the decisions. But then when something<br />
goes wrong they very often tend to blame the Commonwealth.<br />
I know that Peter Nixon is examining the future framework<br />
of a national highways program and I also know he is concerned<br />
that more funds be made available for the Stuart Highway.<br />
But at the moment, under present guidelines, it's question of<br />
persuading the South Australian Government.<br />
CALLER<br />
What is the Government policy in relation to minority groups<br />
and in particular to Aboriginal people. Is it one of separate<br />
development or of assimilation. If it is a policy of separate<br />
development, how far is it proposed to take that policy. it is<br />
thought locally that a policy of separatism is being encouraged,<br />
and examples of this are the lack of access to non-Aboriginal<br />
members of the community to land granted under the Aboriginal<br />
Land Rights Act. About one third of the Northern Territory's<br />
area is so affected, and both residents and visitors find<br />
difficulty in being unable to freely travel along roads passing<br />
through Aboriginal lands.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The policy of the Federal Government in relation to minoritieslet<br />
me deal with it in two parts. For people who have come<br />
to Australia, if you like, in the years since the last world<br />
war, we now have a special program designed to provide much<br />
better post-arrival services for migrants. This might involveresource<br />
centres where they can get advice and assistance<br />
relating to State or Federal Commonwealth departments; more<br />
English language classes and generally greater assistance<br />
in helping people to settle in to what is very often a different<br />
life in Australia compared to their previous homeland. I think<br />
these programs are useful. We had a special inquiry under<br />
Mr. Frank Galbally. We adopted in full the recommendations of<br />
that inquiry and the program is going forward very well.<br />
For Aboriginals there are special obligations. We all know the<br />
history of the past. I believe Australia was a little late in<br />
introducing special programs designed to overcome some of<br />
the difficulties that have grown out of the past. In other<br />
words, in plain terms, there is positive discrimination in favour<br />
of Aboriginals in a number of Government programs. I think that<br />
ought to remain. I don't say indefinitely into the future, but<br />
ought to remain certainly for the foreseeable future. It is not<br />
a policy of separate development for all minorities and ethnic<br />
groups. It is a policy of, in a sense, encouraging people to<br />
seek out their own future in their own way. If you like,<br />
strength through diversity, unity through diversity. ./ 8 </p>
<p>-8<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
If Aboriginals want to live on their reserves, through the<br />
outstation movement, well then they * ought to be entitled to do so.<br />
But if at the same time there are others who wish to join the<br />
mainstream of Australian society and life, then they ought to<br />
be encouraged and assisted where possible, to do so. It is<br />
a policy of self-development, self-fulfillment, trying to meet<br />
the special needs of Aboriginal people, but really with the<br />
same kind of objective that we would have for all Australians<br />
to lead the kind of life that they themselves want to plan<br />
for themselves.<br />
CALLER<br />
* Would.-you'please. let-. Alice . Springs' -people know when the<br />
Stuart-Highway, which it is by n ame only, is going to be<br />
upgraded by sealing it between ( inaud) and the Northern Territory<br />
border. We all know the trouble section is in South Australia.<br />
But should this make any difference to a national highway.<br />
We had Mr. Nixon try to visit Cooper Pedy but could not land<br />
his aeroplane because of the wet weather. We all know Ministers<br />
are busy people, but surely he could have driven as many private<br />
people have to. Their vehicles are being wrecked. Even when<br />
it is dry, the road is arrugated and very pot-holey. Creek<br />
crossings are a nightmare. Has this road not been sealed<br />
because there is very few people in comparison with the<br />
eastern and southern cities living along it' which in short<br />
means not many voters. Northern Territory people rely heavily<br />
on this road because the rail is slow and unreliable, which<br />
should improve with the completion of the new line, but still<br />
cannot provide the service of private enterprise. When will<br />
this road be sealed. It is hard to imagine the tourist increase<br />
to. the -Territ+ ory.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I can't give a definite time scale because at the moment it<br />
is the South Australian Government making decisions about<br />
how much money gets spent on the Stuart Highway. I am told that<br />
nearly $ 4; l1/ 2 million is in the program at the moment, this year.<br />
But a great deal more than that could be spent. We make the<br />
bulk term available to South Australia for national highways,<br />
as we do to other States, but then they decide what roads the<br />
funds will be spent on. I know that Peter Nixon is particularly<br />
concerned about the Stuart Highway because of its importance<br />
and also it has been given a low priority by the South<br />
Australian Government. I know he has been looking at this<br />
question. I can't argue against the thrust of what the<br />
questioner was saying. I only wish the South Australian<br />
Government would show greater sense of national * responsibility<br />
in the distribution of the funds that are made to it.<br />
CALLER I am a Commonwealth Public Servant and we are finding it<br />
difficult to buy our Commonwealth Public Servant house.<br />
I am wondering if the Prime Minister is aware of the situation<br />
of Public Servants in my position and if he could perhaps<br />
implement some sort of suggestions to speed up the procedure / 19 </p>
<p>9-<br />
CALLER ( continued)<br />
of being able to buy these houses.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The policy in relation to this is being reviewed by<br />
Mr. McLeay,-the Minister responsible,. right at this moment.<br />
I think it might be a good thing if I could get Senator Kilgariff<br />
to get hold of your address and when thepolicy is reviewed<br />
he could drop you a note about it and then we can see if<br />
that provides some help.<br />
CALLER<br />
The Labor Party has stated that they will commence sealing<br />
the . south.:-road-as part of their unemployment relief plan.<br />
This sounds like a good idea because employment and transport<br />
would both benefit and dole money would be diverted into a<br />
major national project. Why doesn't your Government support<br />
such a policy.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The Labor Party had such a policy before and when Mr. Hayden<br />
was Treasurer he abandoned it because it was costing a vast<br />
amount of money and providing very little employment. Road<br />
works at the moment a lot of it is undertaken with big machines<br />
and heavy equipment, and it doesn't really provide all that<br />
much employment. But we've taken the view that the only way<br />
to get this economy right is to make sure that the farms and<br />
pastoralists, and the industries in Australia are competitive<br />
so that they can sell better and get into markets overseas and<br />
because they are doing better they will employ more.<br />
In the last 12 months private employment has grown again for<br />
the first time in a number of years. I think that is very<br />
encouraging indeed. The sort of " make work" programs that have<br />
been tried in a number of countries, including Australia, just<br />
haven't worked. South Australia has programs of that kind. But<br />
if you look at the record of the last 12 months unemployment<br />
has grown significantly in South Australia where it has fallen<br />
a bit in other States; employment has fallen in South Australia<br />
where employment has definitely grown in other States. The reason<br />
for that is that the policies of the South Australian Government<br />
have not encouraged investment and development. I believe that<br />
the Northern Territory is moving forward quite strongly. The<br />
pastoral industry is doing much better. Mining is going ahead.<br />
This is the way to solve the unemployment problem. If you<br />
want to argue, or suggest that more money should be spent on<br />
road construction to get roads developed more quickly', that<br />
is a different kind of argument. It is one, that if we had<br />
the funds, I would certainly be sympathetic to, but I don't<br />
think that really it is the way to tax the vexed and difficult<br />
problem of employment. </p>
<p>10<br />
CALLER I have a question to the Prime Minister about land rights<br />
for Aboriginals. The majority of Aboriginal people are<br />
alienated from their traditional land by cattle station leases.<br />
I want to ask the Prime Minister what you will do to help them<br />
get some land rights in the form of ( inaud) from cattle<br />
station leases since the Northern Territory Government has<br />
refused to make ( inaud) compulsory under their ordinance. Will<br />
you press the Northern Territory Government to make ( inaud)<br />
compulsory where necessary. . The Central Land Council is forced,<br />
by the Land Rights Act, to devote its full time to attend to<br />
Aboriginal claims to unalienated Crown Land, and ' has no staff<br />
or money to attend to the problem of station ( liraud). Will you<br />
fund the Central Land Council sufficiently to take care of<br />
this problem. Also, the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission is<br />
supposed to supply funds to purchase ( inaud) when necessary,<br />
but it has insufficient funds for this purpose. Will you fund<br />
the Land Fund sufficiently so it can also do its job. If you<br />
don't do these things, will your Government accept responsibility<br />
for the fighting and resentment and social problems, the loss<br />
of culture, which are occuring and will continue to occur<br />
amongst'Aboriginal people until all Aboriginal groups and<br />
families in each tribe get some adequate land rights<br />
in their own country in the Northern Territory.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think you are omitting the fact, or forgetting really, in<br />
the thrust of the question, that it was this Government that<br />
established the Land Rights Legislation and has therefore<br />
provided opportunities to Aboriginals which they haven't had<br />
under any previous administration. Also, I have visited over<br />
the years a number of Aboriginal settlements and reserves.<br />
There is a very real difference between them obviously. But also,<br />
there is a feeling of optimism and enthusiasm for the future<br />
in a number of settlements which might not have been present<br />
several years ago. I think that is as a result of the general<br />
policies that the Commonwealth has introduced. The Land Fund<br />
Commission is going to be subsumed into a new body an<br />
Aboriginal Development Commission which Senator Chaney will<br />
be launching. That will have funds. There will be a commitment<br />
to it but the Commission ' itselIf will determine the directions<br />
in which the funds will be provided. I think again, that<br />
significant progress has been made in relation to Aboriginal<br />
problems, but a great deal more remains to be done.<br />
CALLER<br />
What is happeni-ng as far as these Aboriginal houses these<br />
houses that have been built in Alice Springs. Apparently an<br />
amount of money was set aside to build a number of houses and<br />
because of what was happening recently, it has been dropped<br />
down to ten * houses that are going to be built in Alice<br />
Springs. As quite a number of Aboriginal people have applied<br />
for a house in town, what is going to happen to the rest<br />
of the people that are on this special housing because of<br />
that will be put into these houses. And another, from the<br />
cutback from 20 to 10, what is happening to the money that<br />
was set aside for those houses to be built? Is that money going<br />
to be channelled back into Aboriginal housing in other areas<br />
or in Alice Springs? </p>
<p>11<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I would have to speak to Senator Chaney about the details<br />
of that. We are providing additional funds for Aboriginal<br />
housing and for the first time we are providing substantial<br />
sums out of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement for<br />
Aboriginal housing, which around Australia will provide a<br />
very significant boost to Aboriginal housing of a kind that<br />
I think we haven't had before. One of the oddest things is<br />
that we have had the major welfare program for housing with<br />
the States there had been a special allocation for<br />
pensioners as a needy group but there had been no<br />
particular allocation for Aboriginals. Now there is and<br />
there will be in future programs. I think that is a very<br />
significant advance. But I will be happy to speak to<br />
Senator Chaney about the particular matters that you are<br />
referring to in Alice Springs. I understand they are being<br />
discussed with the Northern Territory Government.<br />
CALLER I would like to ask Mr. Fraser, why haven't the armed forces<br />
been put to work when strikers hold, or bring the country<br />
to a standstill. Mr. Chifley did it with success. There<br />
is no such word as can't.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, there is no such word as can't and you might note that<br />
during a particular dispute, especially centred in N. S. W.,<br />
Mr. Wran was offered certain assistance if he needed it<br />
for moving blockages on major highways. He didn't pick<br />
up that offer. But he would have had to ask for it because<br />
it was essentially a State matter. Commonwealth power in<br />
industrial di ; putes varies. Where they are Commonwealth<br />
employees we have pretty substantial power and we've acted,<br />
especially in the Postal Commission and Telecom, in a very<br />
vigorous way. New legislation has been proclaimed and I think<br />
we have the powers that are nedded. If people are under<br />
State awards, if the State Government is the employer, then<br />
they have the authority and they need to act, sometimes much<br />
more vigorously than they do. If it is a private employer<br />
then there are many provisions in the Arbitration'-Act which<br />
they could use if they wanted to. But again, the initiative<br />
sometimes has to be taken by employers. There is a belief<br />
that the Commonwealth has direct responsibility in all dispute<br />
situations. I am afraid that just isn't true. Our primary<br />
responsibility is to establish a framework of law, for<br />
people under Commonwealth laws, then it is for the parties to use<br />
that law. Secondly, we have a very particular responsibility<br />
for our own employees and I think we fulfill that. The<br />
circumstances in which Mr. Chifley put troops into the coal<br />
fields I think, well, they haven't arisen since 1948 and<br />
you'll know, then, that the whole of industry was held up<br />
because of shortages of coal, shortages of power. There were<br />
blackouts frequently in the south eastern part of Australia<br />
because not enough electricity was being generated. Again, we<br />
haven't seen that kind of situation since.<br />
