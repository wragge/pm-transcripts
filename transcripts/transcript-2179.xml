FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON DOMICILIARY<br />
NURSING<br />
Melbourne, Victoria 2 FEBRUARY 1970<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Madam President, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
Thank you very much for your welcome, Madam<br />
President. My wife and I are glad indeed to be with you on this<br />
occasion and to have the opportunity of extending, on behalf of<br />
the Commonwealth Government, a welcome to all delegates, but<br />
particularly, perhaps to those delegates who have come from overseas.<br />
It is good that we have with us today delegates from<br />
the World Health Organisation, from the North American continent,<br />
from Europe, from Asia and from the Pacific. I take some small<br />
personal satisfaction in having made the conference arrangements<br />
a little easier, due largely to the persistence of Dame Ivy Wedgwood.<br />
I wish at the beginning to pay tribute to the organisers<br />
of this Conference, the Ff. rst International Domiciliary Nursing<br />
Conference the Royal D ',. xrict Nursing Service of Melbourne.<br />
Beginning in 1885 with a. si-aff of two nurses, they are now<br />
recognised as the senior home nursing service in Australia, and<br />
the conference owes much to their initiative and hard work.<br />
But they are not the only organisation in Australia.<br />
Twelve years ago, when the Commonwealth Government first<br />
began to financially assist these organisations, there were some<br />
19 organisations employing some 200 nurses. Now there are 78<br />
organisations employing more than 700 nurses, engaged in<br />
succouring the ill, in rehabilitation and in after-care throughout<br />
Australia. You have chosen as the theme of this conference<br />
" Domiciliary nursing in a Changing World". What is the nature of<br />
this change referred to, as far as it concerns the matters you are<br />
going to discuss? Over the last two decades there have been<br />
great advances in the methods of treatment of the ill. and in the<br />
technical ability to heal. But in this period there has also been<br />
what is perhaps a more important change a determination on the<br />
part of nations to see that this technical capacity to heal is applied<br />
to the individual, to see that schemes are brought into being in<br />
countries of the world whereby these new methods of medical and<br />
hospital care are made available to all individuals in a community </p>
<p>and that none is debarred from sharing in them as a result of his<br />
financial sit uat ion. This is indeed a great change, and perhaps what<br />
you had in mind. But it is not an easy matter to arrange. What do we<br />
want as a result of applying our minds to this change in attitude<br />
towards our citizens? We want a scheme which covers the great<br />
bulk of the cost of minor and major illnesses to a patient, whether<br />
that cost be incurred by medical attention, hospitalisation or by<br />
other methods of care and rehabilitation. We want a scheme which<br />
requires some contribution from the individual, high enough to<br />
impress on his mind that these matters are extremely costly, and<br />
yet low enough t o ensure that all can join in the protection offered.<br />
We want a scheme that is efficient from the point of<br />
view of the patient, to whom we direct our attention. And we want<br />
one which costs the tax payer as little as possible, consistent with<br />
the effective operation of the scheme, and consistent with it being<br />
extended to all our citizens. So this is what we want. Not very<br />
difficult to state, but quite difficult to attain.<br />
So we need to cover medical diagnosis and treatment,<br />
hospitalisation and the other cares of which I have spoken. This<br />
involves great and growing costs to the community, as<br />
experience has shown in our country and every other country<br />
which has involved itself in matters of this kind. This is true<br />
whether the method of a scheme adopted is a compulsory one or<br />
a voluntary one. In either case, there are great and growing costs.<br />
Major problems leading to this cost, ones that we must<br />
seek to guard against, I think, are unchecked rises in medical fees by<br />
doctors, rising hospital costs as costs rise generally through the<br />
community, the over-use by patients of medical or hospital facilities,<br />
and the over-treatment by some doctors of patients who will add to<br />
the income of the doctors tdu t over-treat them. I emphasise SOME<br />
doctors. These are problems common to all schemes, again<br />
whether they be compulsory or whether they be voluntary, and<br />
overcoming these is a major matter for all those who wish to see<br />
the proper operation of the health scheme I postulated at the<br />
beginning, working in our community.<br />
But in any case, even if we do overcome them, costs<br />
will still tend to rise. They will rise because of the cost per bed<br />
in hospitals. Perhaps this gathering might devote some of its attention<br />
to seeing whether the cost per bed in hospital is necessary at its present<br />
level, whether perhaps some of the stainless steel, some of the bronze </p>
<p>some of the general what sball I call it the general greatness<br />
which is put into the building of hospitals is essential for the care of<br />
the patient. There is a great field to be covered in hospital<br />
construction, and in what is required for different classes of patients<br />
in hospitals. In any case, this is just, in passing, one aspect which<br />
this gathering may perhaps wish to take into consideration.<br />
Perhaps more directly concerning this gathering is that<br />
home nursing contributes to keeping down the cost of treating<br />
patients in hospitals or even in nursing homes. Yet it does, of<br />
course, far more than merely keep down the cost of treating patients.<br />
It pays attention to the inner desires of someone I referred to hitherto<br />
as a patient, but who is more than a patient, who is a living, sentient<br />
human being. It pays attention to the scial and emotional desire of<br />
such people to be treated in surroundings they know, in the company<br />
of families they love, in their own homes. So it does far more than<br />
merely keep down costs. It contributes very greatly to actual<br />
healing, if actual healing is helped, as I believe it is, by the state<br />
of mind of the person being treated, and this is the great significance<br />
of this movement. There is another matter I would ask you to consider.<br />
As the technical capacity to treat those who are ill has increased,<br />
so there seems to have been an increase in the amount of training<br />
and the number of certificates required by nurses. And I am sure<br />
this is right and proper. But I wonder if all those nurses who make<br />
home visits for domiciliary care need to be quite as highly technically<br />
trained as some other nurses involved in hospitals perhaps need to be.<br />
I am told by doctor friends ;-and I have some doctor friends<br />
I am told by doctor friends that in many of these cases what patients<br />
at home need more than anything is what they describe as TLC or<br />
tender loving care, which involves the smoothing of a pillow, the<br />
makcing of a bed, the bringing of a cold drink, the talk about little<br />
matters of the day, the provision of a hot water bottle which in<br />
themselves, the laymen would think, did not really require triple<br />
certificates in order to be able to be devoted to the welfare of the<br />
patient. But I just put this question to you and look to you for the<br />
answers to it to come back in due course.<br />
I am sure the answer to that and other questions of<br />
significance will emerge from this Conference and will be of help<br />
to me, and to the Parliament and to the nation, for on these matters<br />
we will in the year ahead be hearing a very great deal indeed, and be<br />
seeking to make advances in solving some of the problems involved.<br />
It is of some help and some sustenance to those who try to devote our<br />
attention to this to know that here in Melbourne, and in Australia today, </p>
<p>4.<br />
we have this conference concerned in the same affairs, preparing to<br />
devote its discussion to those affairs, and we know that out of that<br />
discussion there will be help for us in our attempts to be, as it were,<br />
the midwife between the Australian nation and those who are sick in<br />
the Australian nation, so that what the Australian nation wants to do<br />
for those who are sick, we may help them do in the most effective and<br />
efficient way possible.<br />
I must finish by congratulating and thanking all of you<br />
for having devoted your attention to the thought and care for<br />
those who are less fortunate than you. That in itself will, I think,<br />
be a reward for you to know you have done that, but a rather more<br />
concrete and rather more significant reward will be if from this<br />
Conference there emerges proposals which a government is able<br />
to consider and perhaps adopt for the good of the people of this<br />
nation. </p>
