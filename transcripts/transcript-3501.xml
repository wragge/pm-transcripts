NOTES FOR THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR AUSTRALIAN HARDCOURT TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS<br />
AT GYMPIE<br />
NOVEMBER 1974<br />
1. THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN MANY INITIATIVES IN TOURISM<br />
AND RECREATION TO WIDEN AUSTRALIANS' LEISURE OPPORTUNITIES.<br />
IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS 120 GRANTS TOTALLING $ 4 MILLION<br />
HAVE BEEN MADE TO SPORTING AND RECREATION PROJECTS IN ALL<br />
STATES. QUEENSLAND CITIES AND TOWNS HAVE RECEIVED<br />
$ 536,200. HERE IN GYMPIE WE ARE SPENDING $ 23,000 ON A<br />
SPORTS RESERVE,<br />
2. TENNIS HAS HAD A REMARKABLE RESURGENCE OF POPULARITY IN<br />
RECENT YEARS. THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO SKILLED PROMOTION<br />
AND THE GREAT FREQUENCY OF OPEN TOURNAMENTS IN WHICH THE<br />
WORLD'I S BEST PLAYERS COMPETE. OLD-FASHIONED DISTINCTIONS<br />
BETWEEN AMATEUR AND PROFESSIONAL PLAYERS HAVE BEEN<br />
REMOVED, MAKING THE GAME MORE EXCITING, MORE COMPETITIVE<br />
AND MORE SPECTACULAR,<br />
3. AUSTRALIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF THE WORLD'S TOP TENNIS<br />
NATIONS. WE WANT OUR YOUNGER PLAYERS TO DEVELOP THEIR<br />
SKILLS AND ENJOY THE GAME IN THE BEST POSSIBLE CONDITIONS.<br />
BY GIVING PEOPLE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SPORT WE HOPE TO<br />
ENCOURAGE HIGHER STANDARDS OF PLAY AND BUILD A HEALTHIER<br />
NATION. </p>
