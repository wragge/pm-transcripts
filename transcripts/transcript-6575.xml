FOR MEDIA 21 January 1985<br />
The Prime Minister said today that at the time the assets<br />
test was announced by the Government it was made clear that<br />
it would be regularly monitored to ensure that any anomalies that<br />
became apparent in its implementation were speedily addressed and<br />
remedied. The Government's objective had always been to avoid<br />
any confusion and uncertainty on the part of pensioners.<br />
The regular monitoring of the test will be carried out by the<br />
Department of Social Security, and the Office of Aged Care in<br />
the new Department of Community Services will be involved.<br />
The Prime Minister said that he welcomed the offer of<br />
assistance by New South Wales state officials in the monitoring<br />
of the test and in the identification of any anomalies or<br />
inequities which become evident in its administration. </p>
