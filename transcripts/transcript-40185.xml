    <content><![CDATA[<p>Warren Truss has been an outstanding Leader of the National Party and Deputy Prime Minister.  He has been a source of great wisdom, great stability and great generosity for his Party, the Liberal Party and for our nation.</p>
<p>Warren understands the importance of the National Party’s distinct identity, but the reality that we are so much stronger when we are working closely together.</p>
<p>He has used this strength to pursue what has been his great passion – infrastructure.  He is one of the few of us whose contribution to public life is so very tangible, in the form of the bridges and roads and the infrastructure of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Warren Truss has been a formidable advocate for his electorate and for rural and regional Australia more broadly.</p>
<p>I thank Warren for his service and for his friendship.  I thank his wife Lyn and his family for the sacrifices they have made and the support they have given to Warren in his service of our nation.</p>
