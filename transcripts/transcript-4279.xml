PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 26 NOVEMBER 1976<br />
EMBARGO: 8.00 p. m. GEORGETOWN MEETING<br />
I am very pleased to be back here in Georgetown in the<br />
Bass electorate. Gecirgetown and Bass will always have a<br />
special place in Australian history.<br />
In the by-election here in June last year by your decision<br />
you gave heart to people all around Australia.<br />
It certainly gave gipeat heart to those of us who were<br />
work ing to halt Australia's disastrous downward slide and<br />
to turn Australia towards economic recovery.<br />
Those of you who took part in that campaign gave a lead<br />
which helped to spark off the return to prosperity which<br />
is now getting underway.<br />
You sent to Canberra to represent you, a man who has already<br />
made a first class contribution Kevin Newman.<br />
In December last year, Tasmania gave a vote of confidence<br />
to the whole Liberal team. There is no a State in Australia<br />
more strongly, more vigorously represented in the Federal<br />
Government than Tasmania.<br />
Last year, Liberals around Australia committed themselves to<br />
take the difficult decisions necessary to beat inflation and<br />
unemployment. Throughout this year, members of the Liberal<br />
Party have worked together as a team to see that the vital<br />
steps were taken.<br />
The commitments we made have been honoured: excessive<br />
government spending the major cause of inflation and unemploymenthas<br />
been cut back. The Federal bureaucracy is already thousands<br />
less than this time last year. With the savings we have<br />
made we have been able to introduce major tax reforms to<br />
assist both individuals and business. We have introduced<br />
full personal tax indexation. This year, to take one example,<br />
the tax reduction under indexation for a taxpayer on<br />
average weekly earnings with dependent spouse is $ 4.60 a week.<br />
2 </p>
<p>Next year, tax indexation will mean a further reduction<br />
in tax compared to 1975-76 rates. Just how much will<br />
depend on the rate of inflation. At 12% inflation next year,<br />
the saving for this same taxpayer would be nearly a further $ 4.00<br />
per week compared with this year, and $ 10.60 per week compared<br />
with the 1975-76 rates. At 6% inflation, the taxpayer with<br />
a dependent spouse onaverage wee! Kly earnings, would be<br />
paying $ 7.50 per week less than if 1975-76 rates still applied.<br />
This year, personal tax indexation is worth $ 990 million to<br />
Australian taxpayers. By next year taxation revenue will<br />
be some $ 2 billion less as a result of indexation adjustments.<br />
it is an important aspect of our total attack on inflation.<br />
We intend to introduce further reforms in this area.<br />
As the Treasurer said earlier this week income taxes are still<br />
too high in Australia, destroying incentives and penalising<br />
initiatives. When it is responsible to do so, we will be<br />
moving further in this area.<br />
One of the most important national needs is to reduce costs.<br />
Despite the activities of a few left wing militant unions<br />
who have tried to undermine recovery, most Australians have<br />
supported the Government in its calls for wage restraint.<br />
Most people now recognise that every wage increase makes<br />
it more difficult for private enterprise to provide new<br />
productive jobs and delays recovery. Thosc who press for<br />
excessive wage increases are actually producing more encmployment.<br />
The quickest way to get higher wages without inflation is to<br />
get industry moving.<br />
Our programmes are directed to that. It is going to be a long<br />
haul to -repair the damage done by the Labor Party to Australia..<br />
It cannot be done quickly but the foundations for recovery<br />
have been laid.<br />
Inflation is now coming down. As inflation comes under control0<br />
and confidence returns, employment opportunities will start to<br />
expand. In this area of Tasmania there are now clear signs that recovery<br />
is making headway..<br />
This year Comalco has announced a $ 9.8 million expansion to increase<br />
plant capacity the expansion is expected to provide some one<br />
hundred additional jobs.<br />
Under Labor, regions with great potential like Tasmania were<br />
ignored.<br />
Unfortunately the Labor Party does not understand that to make<br />
a state prosperous you need to encourage industry. It is private<br />
enterprise that provides productive jobs, opportunities, higher<br />
wages and a better standard of living. / 13 </p>
<p>State or Federal, the Labor Party seems to think that the road<br />
to prosperity and jobs is through more and more Government spending.<br />
This only tends to higher taxes which penalise enterprise and<br />
destroy jobs.<br />
While industry in Tasmania was reeling under the Whitlam inflation,<br />
the Neilson Government dealt a further blow by increasing state<br />
taxes and charges.<br />
Charges and taxes imposed by the state government added up to<br />
an additional burden imposed on Mt Lyell of about $ 1 million in<br />
three years. No wonder that company ran into difficulties.<br />
While private enterprise and farmers all over Tasmania were<br />
making losses, the state government ended up with a $ 4 million<br />
surplus last year, and more than $ 17 million credit in its<br />
loan account.<br />
Why weren't these funds used to help Mt Lyell?<br />
The Labor Party seems to think it can increase taxes and spending<br />
indefinitely without any adverse effects.<br />
Last year, the Liberal Party committed itself to a number of<br />
significant measures to help Tasmania. Those commitments<br />
have been honoured. Together they amount to the most substantial<br />
set of programmes for any state in Australia.<br />
Foremost in importance has been the introduction of freight<br />
equalisation. For too long, Tasmania has been disadvantaged by<br />
the high cost of shipments of Tasmanian products to the mainland.<br />
The i. iheral Party undertook to establish a scheme on the basis<br />
of thc-Nimmo Report which would ensure that the cost of transporting<br />
goods between Tasmania and the mainland is approximately the same<br />
as moving similar goods by land over the same distance.<br />
We have now introduced freight equalisation on northbound freight.<br />
This will be worth over $ 16 million to Tasmania this year.<br />
This scheme camne into operation on 1 July. At the time we<br />
announced that we were also examining the problem of southbound<br />
freight. Many industries * in Tasmania are held back by the cost<br />
of bringing materials and equipment interstate.<br />
We have now completed our examination of the southbound freight<br />
problem. There is a very extensive range of goods that could be defined<br />
as producers material and equipment.<br />
Because of this the most equitable way to implement a scheme<br />
is to ask firms in the manufacturing and mining industries to<br />
provide the Department of Transport with a list of the commodities<br />
imported from the mainland for use in production.<br />
Producers' materials and equipment that represent greater than<br />
of the factory door cost of the finished product a limit set<br />
for practical reasons will be eligible for subsidy. / 14 </p>
<p>The scheme, in common with that operating northbound, of<br />
course excludes bulk cargoes.<br />
Registration of eligible imports from the mainland will be<br />
open from 1 December to 1 February 1977 after which eligible<br />
firms will be notified of subsidy entitlement and will be<br />
able to claim subsidy from the Department of Transport.<br />
The scheme will apply retrospectively to shipments of cargo<br />
on or after 1 July 1976.<br />
Registration forms will be mailed automatically to those firms<br />
that have already benefited from the Government's northbound<br />
scheme.<br />
Other firms who are users of imported producers' materials and<br />
equipment from the mainland will be able to obtain forms from<br />
the Department of Transport offices in Hobart of Customs offices<br />
in Launceston, Devonport and Burnie.<br />
As the requirements of agri cultural, forestry and fishery0<br />
producers are more easily identified they will not be asked to<br />
register individually with the Department but Jill be eligible<br />
to participate in the southbound scheme from i. Ls commencement.<br />
Further details enabling claims to be lodged will be announced<br />
shortly.<br />
Tasmania has also benefited form the new Federalism Policy.<br />
Under the new tax sharing arrangements Tasmania will receive<br />
some $ 4.7 million more than under the old scheme.<br />
The new arrangements are also of great advantage to local<br />
government. Local government will have much greater freedom<br />
and assured funds to decide how to meet local needs than ever<br />
before. United assistance to local government throughout<br />
Australia will be $ 140 million this year. United grants to<br />
local government in Tasmania have increased 43% over last year.<br />
We insisted that local government in each state should be<br />
represented on the new advisory council on Inter-government Relations<br />
How absurd it would be if the representative from Queensland<br />
had to explain what had happened to local government in Tasmania.<br />
The Advisory Council of course will be based in Hobart.<br />
It will have a valuable role in advising on improvements to<br />
inter-governmental cooperation in Australia.<br />
Tasmania has some of the most magnificent country in Australia<br />
of which Australians everywhere are proud.<br />
Despite stringent financial constraints the Commonwealth<br />
has made available funds to assist Tasmania in the establishment<br />
of the South West National Park.<br />
The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service is assisting<br />
the Tasmanian service in a resources survey to identify components<br />
in the area which should be protected. </p>
<p>We have been very much aware of the needs of Hobart following the<br />
bridge disaster. So far some $ 24 million has been spent by the<br />
Commonwealth as a result of tho disaster. Very substantial<br />
assistance will be made available this year as well.<br />
Conditions and politices in recent years have hit the farmers<br />
particularly hard. Tasmania should have strong rural industries but wage<br />
costs, strikes, incompetent Labor Government policies, have all.<br />
made life difficult for farmers.<br />
At the Federal level, the Liberal Party has introduced a major programme<br />
of policies to help rural industries back on their feet.<br />
Wle have introduced a forty percent investment allowance which<br />
covers most new farm machinery and structural improvements.<br />
To help the dairy industry particularly, the Commonwealth is<br />
Sunderwriting butter and cheese, to ensure that dairy farmers receive<br />
Wabout 6O per pound butterfat at the farm gate and is providing<br />
$ 13.5 million for the dairy adjustment programme in 1976/ 77.<br />
An Income Equalisation Deposit Scheme is now being introduced.<br />
Tasmanian industries have also been particularly vulnerable to<br />
strikes because of their dependence on one major form of transport.<br />
We committed ourselves to legislate for secret postal ballots in all<br />
union elections. This legislation is now in force. It places<br />
a powerful instrument in the hands of rank and file members fed up<br />
with militant union leaders.<br />
These measures will all be of very great benefit to Australia.<br />
The Liberal Party State and Federal is deeply concerned about<br />
the unemployment caused by the incompetence of the Labor Party.<br />
There is only one way to get unemployment down and keep it down<br />
Wto get industry expanding again.<br />
To do this, we have to beat inflation and the uncertainty created<br />
by inflation. We have to reduce costs, provide incentives, create<br />
an environment where private enterprise knows its problems are<br />
understood by Government.<br />
This is the way to restore prosperity and create more jobs.<br />
The more costs can be kept down, the faster inflation comes down,<br />
the sooner we can get unemployment down.<br />
Because of the Liberal Party's concern for the Tasmanian situation the<br />
Commonwealth Government has decided to hold an inquiry into the<br />
structure of industry and the employment situation in Tasmania.<br />
The inquiry will be undertaken by Sir Bede Callaghan, Chairman of<br />
the Foreign Investment Review Board. / 6 </p>
<p>6.<br />
Sir Bie; de will examine the inherent advantage and disabiliti,--es<br />
of TasiR* Uinian industry; existing forms of assistance to<br />
and charges levied upon industry' by State and Commonwealth<br />
Governments and Vir instrumentalities; the capacity<br />
of Tasmania to assistance to industry from the financial<br />
resources availablez to it; and any other factors that<br />
appe-ar relevant including industrial disruption and<br />
restrictive practices, and any special consequences there<br />
of for the Tasmanian economy.<br />
The I-nquiry will be of major assistance in restoring prosperity<br />
in Tasmania.<br />
In Tasmania a Liberal Party Government will help build -the<br />
confidence that is vital to recovery. A Liberal Party<br />
Government will provide the realistic policies essential<br />
to recovery.<br />
On * e of the things that has given great concern to the<br />
Liberal Party has been the effect of inflation on low<br />
income families. A number of measures we have introduced this<br />
year have been designed to concentrate assistance on those<br />
in most need.<br />
Let me mention two of these measures: one is the<br />
family allowances scheme one of the most significant measures<br />
to help low incomes families since Federation. This measi~ re<br />
is helping particularly some 300,000 families with 800,000<br />
children who benefitted little, or not at all, from the<br />
system of dependents rebates.<br />
The other significant measure which is still at the<br />
experimental stage is the housing allowance voucher scheme.<br />
This important initiative has been brought forward by<br />
Kevin Newman. If the early investigation proves successful<br />
the scheme will provide low income families with the choice<br />
of accommodation on the open market. It will make welfare<br />
housing sensitive to the needs of the users rather than the0<br />
planners. It has already been announced that Hobart will<br />
be one of the locations for the initial try out of the scheme.<br />
Approximately 1500 families in Hobart will benefit directly.<br />
THe whole of Tasmania should benefit from the housing allowance<br />
voucher experiment being conducted in Hobart. The<br />
fact-that Hobart has been selected for the experiment should<br />
free some money that would have been spent on welfare housing<br />
in Hobart under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement,<br />
for other parts of the State.<br />
The Liberal Party said in the Federal election last year that<br />
home ownership should be a national objective and we committed<br />
ourselves to introducing a new,, home savings grant system.<br />
We have introduced a home savings grant with more generous<br />
provisions than the ones we announced.<br />
The measures the Federal Liberal Party has introduced this<br />
year have . been designed to establish conditions in which peopleand<br />
States can meet their needs in the way they think best. </p>
<p>This purpose lies behind our economic policy, behind'<br />
Our s~ llr ~ ssuch as the family allowance scheme.<br />
Th. rL Pa~ rty's approach in these matters is very different<br />
fr'lim tilt Laibor Party's. The Labor Party has an unrealistic<br />
no'jIoo. that Goverrnment can do everything. That Politicians<br />
in Hobart or in Canberra understand people's needs better than<br />
people do themselves; that the way to make Australia prosperous<br />
is for Government to spend more and more of people's earnings.<br />
I have no doubt that the Labor Party will be saying yet again that<br />
they can cure all our problems by spending just a bit more of<br />
your mon ey. Handing more and more of people's earnings<br />
over to politicians is not the way we are going to solve<br />
Australia's problems. That approach has created the problems<br />
of inflation and unemployment we now have to cope with.<br />
It has done enormous damage to Australia and to Tasmania.<br />
The Liberal Party is offering a practical and realistic approach.<br />
There is no quick or easy solution to repairing the damage<br />
done by Labor. Tasmania took a large step forward when the<br />
people supported the Liberal Party last December in the<br />
Federal elections. Now is the time to confirm that<br />
judgement by supporting Max Bingham and the Liberal Party<br />
in these State elections.<br />
Tasmania will get the full benefit of Australia's federal system<br />
by supporting a Liberal Party government in Tasmania which can<br />
work constructively with the Federal Government to get<br />
Australia moving forward again.<br />
In supporting the Liberal Party, Tasmanians will know that<br />
they are supporting a Party, which will work as a team; which<br />
will' fight hard, realistically and responsibly for Tasmania;<br />
and which will work in cooperation with the Federal Government to<br />
beat the inflation and unemployment caused by the Labor Party.<br />
I am confident that Max Bingham and his team are going to offer<br />
the kind of Government Tasmania desperately needs realistic<br />
and practical government with a genuine concern for those hit<br />
worst by the Labor Party's unemployment and inflation.<br />
With a Liberal Government Tasmania can begin to realise its<br />
great potential. 000000000 </p>
<p>TERMS OF REFFi '{ NCE FOR INQUIRY INTO STRUCTURE OF<br />
INDT) USTRY A'TJ TJhB EMPLOYM-GNT SITUATION IN TASMANIA<br />
The study is to enquire into and report upon the structure<br />
of industry and its relation to the long-term employment<br />
situation in Tasmania, in itself and in relation to the<br />
structure of industry and employment in Australia as a<br />
vhole, in the light, in particular, of the following.<br />
. The inherent advantages and disabilities of<br />
Tasmanian industry, including<br />
separation from the Australian mainland and<br />
its consequences;<br />
( ii) the availability and stage of development of<br />
natural resources, including water, land,<br />
minerals, power resources, ports and harbours,<br />
and tourist attractions;<br />
( iii) relative wage levels and non-wage employment<br />
costs ( eg workers' compensation), including<br />
the effects of relevant State legislation<br />
thereon;<br />
( iv) the internal transport system.<br />
In reporting hereon ( and elsewhere, where relevant), the<br />
study shall have due regard to the Report of the Commission<br />
of Enquiry into Transport to and from Tasmania and other<br />
relevant studies.<br />
Existing forms of assistance to, and charges levied<br />
upon, industry by the Commonwealth and State Governments,<br />
and their instrumentalities, including<br />
direct and indirect financial assistance<br />
( eg, freight subsidies and the like, non-</p>
<p>recovery of costs of Government services);<br />
( ii) non-financial assistance;<br />
( iii) tariffs, and the relative incidence thereof<br />
in Tasmania ( having. regard to past and pending<br />
IAC Reports on particular relevant industries);<br />
( iv) royalties, taxes and. other charges levied upon<br />
industry;<br />
and the effects of these on Tasmanian industry.<br />
The capacity of Tasmania to give assistance to industry<br />
from the financial resources available to it.<br />
Any other factors, that may, on enquiry, appear relevant,<br />
including industrial disruption and restrictive practices, and<br />
any special consequences thereof for the Tasmanian economy.<br />
,' lith respect to location of industry, the enquiry should<br />
identify the social and community implications of any changes<br />
in the structure of industry in Tasmania which may, for<br />
economic reasons, seem to be desirable. </p>
