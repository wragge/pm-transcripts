TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP_<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JEREMY CORDEAUX RADIO<br />
E O E<br />
CORDEAUX: On the line I've got the Prime Minister, John Howard. Sir, how are you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm very well thanks.<br />
CORDEAUX:<br />
Now, did you and Peter Costello agree on all of it or was he going to be a little bit tougher than you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We agreed on all of it. Of course we agreed on all of it.<br />
CORDEAUX: Sweetness and light all the way through.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
He's done a terrific job and we work very effectively as a team. And you put together a document that<br />
is a consolidated economic and political response to the circumstances at the time. And the great<br />
message out of this budget is that we are repaying Australia's debts. We inherited a deficit of $ 10.5<br />
billion and by year three of our first term we will have turned that into a surplus of $ 1.6 billion. We're<br />
actually going to repay $ 5 billion of debt this coming financial year and by the year 2000 the debt ratio<br />
of this nation to its total wealth generation each year will have been cut from 20% to 10%. Now that<br />
is a colossal achievement. And it not only delivers great confidence to everybody but it also cuts our<br />
annual living expenses. Because if you owe less money, you pay less interest. And the money you save<br />
on the interest payments you can use for other very valuable things like taxation breaks for savings.<br />
And that's the other great message out of the budget. For the first time since federation you've actually<br />
got a government that is giving an across the board tax encouragement for Australians to save. And<br />
we're not limiting it to bank savings, it goes right across the board. It includes personal contributions<br />
to superannuation on which you've not already achieved a tax break.<br />
CORDEAUX: I know that's been close to your heart for a long time. But when it's all boiled down, $ 450 a year,<br />
wouldn't it have been a much more daring, dramatic thing to have just wiped taxation on the interest<br />
on all savings, just wipe the lot?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I f 1006/ 3107/: 9376: 32<br />
14 May 1997<br />
I of 10 </p>
<p>14t tapy: HIl/ i. v,. w. iila gov au/ pnic/ pressrcl/ cordeaux. littml<br />
We couldn't afford that. We literally could not afford that. Of course it would have been nice. I mean,<br />
Peter and I would have loved to have announced that last night but we simply couldn't afford it. But<br />
this is the first time since federation that you've got a government matching its rhetoric on savings with<br />
actions. The first time since federation that we're actually saying to people: here's a tax break, here's an<br />
incentive, here's an enticement for you to save. And this is very valuable for retired people. It will help<br />
young people saving for a deposit on a home. It will assist superannuation contributions. It's not<br />
limited to bank savings. It will apply to any return on an investment, any kind of savings. Even the net<br />
return on a business activity will benefit from it.<br />
CORDEAUX: And you think it's enough money to get people into the savings habit?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think it will bring about a very big change, over time. See, what is important in these things, Jeremy,<br />
is not only the actual help you deliver but also the signal you send, the symbol you put down. I mean,<br />
we're actually saying for the first time that savings matter, savings count, that we need a savings<br />
culture in Australia. We've often been told that we as a government have got to build for the longer<br />
term and that's right. You don't just have short term expedience. This is a long term building block to<br />
bring about a different culture in Australia.<br />
CORDEAUX: Well, do you foreshadow that if things get better, maybe even very much better, who knows, you<br />
would consider not taxing the interest on savings, period?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm not going to foreshadow that now. Obviously if things get better then you have capacity to do a<br />
lot of things. But I just don't want to get into the situation of sounding as though I'm promising more<br />
when I don't know whether I can deliver it. Because then in a few years time, when I haven't done it,<br />
quite rightly you'll say well you told me on the 14th of May that you were going to do it and you<br />
haven't, why haven't you. Now, all I can say Jeremy is that this is a huge change in the culture. It's<br />
across the board. It's without means test. It's uncomplicated. It's direct. It's simple. It's available to<br />
everybody. And it, for the first time, is a tax break. I mean, somebody's who's on a tax rate of 20%, it<br />
means that they'll be paying only 5% on their savings. People on a higher tax break, they'll be paying<br />
proportionately more because they're earning more money. Now, we are sending a very powerful<br />
signal to Australians six million of them who are savers. We're saying for the first time the<br />
Government so values your savings that it is prepared to give it a tax break very big cultural change.<br />
CORDEAUX: What worries me, I guess, is jobs three and three quarter percent in a country as potentially rich and<br />
as potentially dynamic as Australia. John Prescott, Head of BH-P, said, you know, we've tried you<br />
may have even had reports of what he said but it went something like: we've tried the 3% and 4% and<br />
it really hasn't made much of an impression on unemployment, why don't we do what our neighbours<br />
do, why don't we try to get economic growth in this country of about 7%?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think the idea of going for higher growth is absolutely right and that is what we are trying to do. But<br />
2 f 1006/ 3107/: 9376 : 34<br />
14 May 1 97<br />
2 of 10 </p>
<p>14 ay ~ 97http://,. v,. vv. na. gov. au/ pinc/ pressreVcordeaux. litiil<br />
the only way that this country can grow at a faster rate is if we do two very important things. The first<br />
thing is that we increase our national savings and that means repaying debt. Because if you don't have<br />
a stock of savings, as soon as you increase your economic activity and your economic growth, you go<br />
overseas to borrow the savings to fund that growth from foreigners and you have a blowout in your<br />
current account deficit. And that is why it's important we don't have budget deficits, why it's important<br />
that we reduce debt, and also why it's important we encourage people privately to save. And thle other<br />
thing we've got to do is free our labour market in particular and we've done that. We've done that in a<br />
big way. And those two things together, over time, will take the speed limits off growth in this<br />
country. Prescott is right when he says thle answer is higher growth. But you can't have higher growth<br />
and keep it if you have road blocks along the road to higher growth. And one of the road blocks is<br />
that we've been in debt for so damn long. And you can't run and expand a business if you're too deeply<br />
in debt. You might have to go into debt a bit to expand the business but in the end the interest bill will<br />
kill you if you borrowed too much money. And this has been Australia's problem. It's all very way to<br />
say we need higher growth. You've got to create the circumstances that allow that higher growth to<br />
develop. CORDEAUX: Wouldn't it be fair to say though that without and I know what you mean by workplace reform, but I<br />
mean real workplace reform...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
For example what?<br />
CORDEAUX: Well, changing the minimum wage. Scrapping the minimum wage...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You mean having lower wages.<br />
CORDEAUX:<br />
Well, when I say having lower wages I mean giving everyone a crack at a job.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we have tried to strike the Australian balance in this area. We've created the maximum flexibility<br />
in the workplace without scrapping the Australian tradition of having a guaranteed minimum wage.<br />
CORDEA UX:<br />
But what if that tradition is working against the average Australian worker?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, the average Australian worker, I'm sure, doesn't believe it is because the average Australian<br />
worker's got a job and the average Australian worker would argue, would be fearful of a system<br />
whereby you had no minimum wage at all.<br />
CORDEAUX: 3 f 1006/ 301/ 79: 73 6: 35<br />
14 May 1997<br />
3 of 10 </p>
<p>14 Ma 199ttp:// wwvw. la. gov. ati/ pnic/ pressreVcordaux. ltifiI<br />
Yeah, but I mean if you compare the growth they've had in America which is not as good as the<br />
growth we've had in Australia..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, the Americans don't have a minimum wage.<br />
CORDEAUX: No. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And they have far more downward flexibility and they have a lower rate of unemployment but they<br />
also have a higher incidence of welfare deprivation. They have more people on the streets who are<br />
begging for money, literally, and you must have experienced that. It's one of the most depressing<br />
things I've experienced in a country that otherwise I admire immensely. And I'm not certain that<br />
Australians haven't quite cleverly over the years got the right balance. We don't have the rigidities of<br />
the Europeans. I mean, I talked to Chancellor Kohl about this a few weeks ago. They have 12.5%<br />
unemployment in Germany. They have over 12% in France. And their labour markets are very rigid.<br />
Ours still needs to be more flexible but we've made a very good start. But the idea that we would<br />
completely scrap a minimum wage in this country, I don't believe that that would be in sync with the<br />
culture of this country. Now, some will argue that the culture ought to be changed. I would say that<br />
the idea that there should be some minimum safety net and protection is a good thing but you can,<br />
consistent with that, get more flexibility, particularly in areas like unfair dismissal laws. And right at<br />
the moment we've got this situation where we are proposing a regulation whereby any firm employing<br />
fewer than 15 people will be completely free of any unfair dismissal law of any kind in relation to<br />
people who've been employed for less than 12 months.<br />
CORDEAUX: Will that happen?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, because the Labor Party has said it's going to vote in the Senate to disallow the regulation. And if<br />
the Democrats and Senator Harradine, as I fear they will, support the Labor Party we will be denied<br />
the opportunity of doing that. And we're going to, if that occurs, we're going to put that regulation in<br />
the form of a bill and we're going to roll it up to the Senate again and see what it does to the bill.<br />
Because I think it is outrageous when you've got 8.5% of the population out of work. You've got a<br />
universal cry from the small business community across the nation that these unfair dismissal laws are<br />
actually scaring them out of taking on young people in particular. And all we are proposing is that<br />
firms under 15, that's the great bulk of the small businesses of Australia, if they put somebody on, for<br />
the first 12 months they ought to be able to let that person go if it doesn't work out.<br />
CORDEAUX: Absolutely right.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And that's a simple proposition and any small businessman or woman listening to this interview would 4 f 1006/ 301/ 79: 73 6: 36<br />

<p>14 ay197ittp: H/ w-wv. nla. gov. ati/ pilc/ pressreVcordcatix. itiii<br />
know intuitively that what I'm saying is right. I mean, say after a year, well, different matter. I'm not<br />
saying then it should be difficult to get rid of a person if they're not performing but you should have a<br />
slightly tighter situation. But in that first year it's often the case that it just doesn't work out. And in a<br />
small firm, if it doesn't work out it's ludicrous to say to the proprietor, well you've got to put up with<br />
the person. That is crazy. And what is happening is that people just aren't taking on staff.<br />
CORDEAUX: Well, to reform a system and to implement something as commi-onsense and as fundamental as that and<br />
you not being able to or allowed to do it...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We can't. I mean, I've got a majority of 44 in the House of Representatives and I can't do that. And the<br />
Labor Party, stupidly in my view and against the advice of their small business spokesman, Stephen<br />
Martin, have said they're going to vote against it. Now, if the Democrats and Brian Harradine, as I<br />
fear they will, join the Labor Party in voting against it, that regulation will go down. Well, let me say<br />
that if it does go down we will immediately incorporate it into a bill and we'll put the bill up and we'll<br />
then see what the Senate does with that bill. Because I am not going to allow the small business<br />
people of Australia, who invested a lot of confidence and faith in us at the time of the last election, to<br />
feel for a moment that we are not taking the maximum steps possible to help them because they hold<br />
the key to job generation in Australia. If we are ever to cut unemployment down to a more acceptable<br />
level then you've got to get small business going again. And I'm trying to take the load off their backs<br />
in a simple area like this and at every turn my political opponents, who command the numbers in the<br />
Senate, are fouling us up.<br />
CORDEAUX: Well there's absolutely no point in being in government if you can't get something as fundamental as<br />
that through.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It is fundamental. And even Bob Carr, who's the only elected Labor leader in Australia at the present<br />
time so he perhaps ought to be listened to more than some of the others, even he said that the unfair<br />
dismissal law that the former Labor Government had was stupid. Now, we were able to make some<br />
changes to it but we wanted to take it this step further in the small business statement. I mean, you're<br />
talking here about hundreds of thousands of small businesses employing in twos and threes and they're<br />
being prevented from making that a three and a four because of this stupid law.<br />
CORDEAUX: Prime Minister, if you put a few of these things together like Wik, like immigration, like this particular<br />
innovation you're talking to me about now, and you put them all into a referendum and let the people<br />
democratically decide what they want I'm sure you'd get a positive answer.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well that may well be the case, it may or may not be. I mean, I have no doubt that each of these<br />
measures is fair and defensible in its own right. Getting something carried at a referendum or a<br />
plebiscite doesn't automatically make it law incidentally, you still might have to have a law passed.<br />
Look, I haven't thought about that but I have thought about the desirability of changing the unfair<br />
dismissal laws. I do think my Wik plan is fair. It does deliver all the security and all the guarantees that<br />

the Pastoralists fairly want without the down side of blanket extinguishment. And there is down side<br />
to blanket extinguishment. It would be more costly. It would be more divisive and it could be<br />
constitutionally overthrown. And the beauty of my approach is that it gives the security the<br />
pastoralists want. I mean under our plan there will not be one pastoralist who will be denied the<br />
capacity to run his property or to have his holding on that property put at risk.<br />
CORDEAUX: A couple of questions off air Prime Minister. One small business owner asks the way to boost small<br />
business is to bring down lending interest rates to home loan levels, that is thle rate the business people<br />
are paying, has that ever, is that ever likely to happen?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, if you get more competition. And I agree with him. We've had some cuts in small business rates,<br />
probably 1 to 1 1/ 2 per cent but they're not as big as the cuts in housing rates. You've had big cuts in<br />
housing rates because you've more competition in the housing sector. Now, you do need, I think he's<br />
absolutely right. We had the Wallis Inquiry and one of the purposes of that was to see ways of getting<br />
more competition into the banking systemn. And that I believe is coming because what has happened in<br />
thle housing area, in a more limited way could be emulated in the small business area. I think it would<br />
take longer and I have to say again that the major banks have got to understand the small business<br />
community feels it isn't being as effectively catered for as they would like and the example of the<br />
competition in the housing area has thrown the spotlight even more on the small business area.<br />
CORLDEAUX: Is the bonus for over 65 year olds working, that is to keep them working, or to give them that option,<br />
is that pro rata?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Pro rata, yes.<br />
CORDEAUX: Okay. Okay. Peter Costello, another question, Peter Costello promises...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You mean if they only work for an extra year that they still get the benefit, yes.<br />
CORDEAUX: Well I guess that would be the meaning of it, yes.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's what I meant by pro rata and the answer is yes.<br />
CORDEAUX: Yes. 6 f 1006/ 301/ 79: 73 6: 38<br />

<p>14Mn 197http:// wwvw. nia. gov. ati/ pinc/ pressrel/ cordeaux lititl<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
What happens is you just don't get the pension and the saving is returned.<br />
CORDEAUX: I think it is a great idea.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I think it's a terrific idea. It recognises the value of older citizens in our community.<br />
CORDEAUX: Yeah. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We're living longer, we're living healthier for longer and why on earth should you have this statutory<br />
senility. It's crazy.<br />
CORDEAUX: Peter Costello promised that nothing that increased last budget would be increased this budget but for<br />
example prescriptions are going up again.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well they're not going up again in a general sense. And what he said was that areas that had taken<br />
huge cuts wouldn't be revisited. And that wasn't quite how the listener put it? But what we've done in<br />
the drugs area is to say that if you've got two drugs in a particular area and they're both doing the<br />
same job, well going to subsidise the cheaper one.<br />
CORDEAUX: The Prime Minister's my guest. Five minutes to nine is the time. 5DN is the station. We're talking<br />
about unemployment, It was a big thing when you came into office that you would certainly stand<br />
judged by what you could do about unemployment. It brings me to ask you about tariffs, a subject<br />
that's very important here in South Australia at the moment. The general feeling was that the tariffs<br />
would come down along with microeconomic reform, tax reform, real workplace reform all that sort<br />
of stuff. Now we seem to be getting the rough end of the pineapple which is very serious for us in<br />
South Australia.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, nothing has happened on that front yet. No we will have a report very soon.<br />
CORDEAUX: Well where do you stand on it personally Prime Minister?<br />

Well, I don't, I can't, you know I can't say that on air. I've got a view and<br />
CORDEAUX: But why can't you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well because I haven't consulted by Cabinet colleagues and you can't, it's not fair of a Prime Minister<br />
to constantly pre-emnpt his Cabinet colleagues by stating a personal view which his colleagues may not<br />
agree with. And what's the point of having a Cabinet if you never talk to it.<br />
CORDEAUX: Well it just seems like as plain as the nose on one's face in South Australia that the Japanese...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it is in South Australia, it is not quite the same intensity in other parts of Australia and it's one of<br />
those issues where depending on where you are in Australia there's a different point of view.<br />
CORDEAUX: But it ' s about jobs here?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes it is. I understand that. I am very conscious of the feeling in South Australia on this. I have<br />
meetings with the industry. I've met the Premier and I know their views and we will take them very<br />
carefully into account and I have said all along that I will never take a decision that reduces the<br />
capacity of this country to have sustainable motor manufacturing industry. And I've also said that I<br />
understand the regional significance of the motor vehicle industry in South Australia. I am very well<br />
aware of that and I've been conscious of it all the time I've been in public life and I know the economic<br />
importance of the motor manufacturing industry in the state of South Australia.<br />
CORDEAUX: Generally you must be pretty happy with the way the budget's been received. I think some of the<br />
financial people are saying the deficit was a bit big.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well some of them always say that. We're going to have a surplus of $ 1.6 billion at the end of our first<br />
term after inheriting a deficit of $ 10.5 billion. Not a bad turnaround.<br />
CORDEAUX: Yep, yep. H-ere in South Australia we're concerned about this Alice Springs to Darwin railroad. The<br />
infrastructure bond tax incentive I'm told won't be big enough to the job. That leaves the Centenary<br />
Foundation. Would you think the construction of that railway line would fit in with the money, the<br />
billion dollars you put aside to celebrate the Centenary of Federation?<br />

<p>14 tMtpy: 1/ / lwi ww. tila. gov. au/ piic/ pressrel/ cordeaux hittml<br />
Well let me put it this way Jeremy I wouldn't be at all surprised if the Premier of South Australia and<br />
Chief Minister of the Northern Territory put to me the Darwin to Alice Springs railway as the sort of<br />
project that should be considered. Now I obviously not going to even attempt to indicate a response if<br />
that were to occur but it is the sort of proposal that I would imagine the two governments would want<br />
us to look at in the context of that fund.<br />
CORDEAUX:<br />
And just quickly...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Bear in mind that fund is not meant to pay for a thousand obelisks in a thousand towns.<br />
CORDEAUX: It's not a pork barrel fund?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, it's meant to support major projects of lasting value which involve job generation.<br />
CORDEAUX: Well that's how it'l be seen. They'll look at it as a pork barrel.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well let them, just wait and see what we do with it. I'm not going to have a situation where you've got<br />
a few million here and a few million there. I want a situation where you are able out of this fund to<br />
support or to fuind either independently or in cooperation with state and territory governments some<br />
major projects that people will see the benefit of, that build Australia's infrastructure. There is a natural<br />
identification of all Australians whether they live in the cities or the regions or the bush with<br />
developing the infrastructure of this country. And it does mean that you need to support certain<br />
projects. CORDEAUX: Prime Minister, just quickly, the Liberal Party is reportedly planning to direct its preferences to Pauline<br />
Hanson at the next federal election.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There's been no decision made about that.<br />
CORDEA UX:<br />
Have you thought about it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No not really. I was asked a question about it yesterday by the Opposition Leader and he said would I<br />

<p>litip:// ww . nila. gov. au/ piic/ picssrel/ cordcauxi. litiiI<br />
join him in something or other, well I said no. That doesn't mean any view as to where our preferences<br />
will ultimately be directed. Look, we're two years off an election. And to start talking about the<br />
allocation of preferences in Oxley, or indeed anywhere else, two years out from an election is<br />
ridiculous. That will be decided by the party organisation. Anyway for the record in case anybody<br />
thought Mr Beazley was taking the moral highground, at the last federal election the Labor Party in<br />
my electorate of Bennelong put the Australians Against Further Immigration ahead of me. Now I don't<br />
mind that, that was their decision but let's not have any moral lectures on the subject.<br />
CORDEAUX: Prime Minister great to talk to you. Thank you for your time.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Pleasure. CORDEAUX: All the best.<br />
