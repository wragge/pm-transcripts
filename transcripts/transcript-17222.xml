    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government and NSW Government will invest $14.1 million to enhance cancer services at the Illawarra Cancer Care Centre at Wollongong.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government will provide $12.1 million and the NSW Government will provide a further $2 million to increase the provision of radiotherapy services at the Illawarra Regional Cancer Centre.</p>
<p>Upgrades will include: </p>
<p>- additional infrastructure for outpatient clinics and day oncology;</p>
<p>- enhanced facilities for haematology and therapies;</p>
<p>- one additional linear accelerator;</p>
<p>- one additional radiotherapy bunker; </p>
<p>- six additional chemotherapy chairs/beds; and</p>
<p>- medical diagnostic equipment.</p>
<p>With some cancers, patients from rural areas are up to three times more likely to die within five years of diagnosis than their counterparts. The $14.1 million investment in Wollongong will work towards improving services and care for the more than 32,000 NSW residents diagnosed with cancer each year.</p>
<p>Once fully operational, these enhanced facilities will allow for an estimated additional 414 radiotherapy patients to access treatment each year and for an estimated additional 3,000 chemotherapy treatments a year.</p>
<p>The Illawarra Regional Cancer Centre forms part of the Rudd Government's $560 million commitment to establish regional cancer centres so that Australians can get care closer to home and their community.</p>
<p>This initiative builds on the Rudd Government's investment of almost $403,000 in the Wollongong Hospital to reduce elective surgery waiting lists.</p>
<p>Since coming into office, the Rudd Government has committed over $2.3 billion in cancer infrastructure, medicines, screening and research.</p>
<p>Today's announcement also shows the benefit of the Federal Government stepping up to the plate and providing funding for health services across Australia.</p>
<p>Under the National Health and Hospitals Network, the Rudd Government would provide 60 per cent of the funding for capital upgrades for public hospitals.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government's plan will see health services funded nationally and run locally through local hospital networks to deliver better outcomes for local communities. </p>
