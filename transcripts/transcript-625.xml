    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Â P. M. No. 76/1962</strong></p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government has offered to provideÂ financial assistance to Queensland over a period of fourÂ years for the sealing of beef cattle roads in the north andÂ west of the State.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth has already undertaken to assistÂ Queensland by providing Â£5 million for the construction ofÂ beef roads over the five-year period from 1961/62. LastÂ financial year the Commonwealth contributed Â£650,000 underÂ this scheme, and this financial year will be providing anÂ estimated Â£1 ,480,000. The decision to provide an additionalÂ Â£250,000 in 1962/63 for sealing roads included in the programmeÂ was announced in the Budget. The Queensland Government hasÂ now proposed a sealing programme extending over four yearsÂ from 1962/ 63, at an estimated cost of Â£3.3 million ( i. e,Â including the Â£250,000 for which provision has already beenÂ made). and has requested Commonwealth assistance up to thisÂ amount.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government is convinced of theÂ need for improved road facilities to assist Queensland'sÂ beef cattle production, which is an important source ofÂ export income, and is satisfied that the provision of specialÂ financial assistance by the Commonwealth for the purpose isÂ warranted. The Government has, therefore, decided to agreeÂ to the Queensland Government's request. This assistance willÂ take the form of loans with interest at relevant long-termÂ bond rates. An agreement on the matter will need to beÂ concluded between the two Governments, but quick progressÂ with this can be expected and the Government hopes to present<br />the necessary legislation to Parliament during the currentÂ sittings.</p>
<p>This assistance to Queensland, added to the increasedÂ assistance to Western Australia for development projects inÂ the Kimborley area that has recently been announced, amountsÂ to a very substantial Commonwealth contribution to the developmontÂ of the North, with particular reference to the developmentÂ of its export potential. The Commonwealth's special assistanceÂ for beef roads, including its Â£4.6 million programme for the<br />Northern Territory, will now exceed Â£16m,</p>
<p>A request by the Quieensland Government for furtherÂ Commonwealth financial assistanceÂ for the development of anÂ extensive area of brigalow cou.try in the Fitzroy Basin isÂ under close practical consideration between the two GovernmentsÂ concerned.</p>
<p>CANBERRA,<br />12th October, 1962.</p>
