PRIME MINISTER'S INTERVIEW WITH PETER HARVEY, CHANNEL 9 NEWS<br />
31 OCTOBER 1975<br />
HARVEY: Prime Minister with the public opinion polls moving<br />
towards you, as they are, you must be very tempted to go for<br />
an election?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh yes there is a temptation, just a's there was<br />
early in the year when Mr Snedden fell and was succeeded by<br />
Mr Fraser, there was a great temptation to take advantage of<br />
disarray in the Liberal Party.<br />
HARVEY: Do you think you wouldwin now, sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. I've thought all along that in any election<br />
campaign we'd win. Because I'm sure that when the public is<br />
faced with a choice between us and the Liberal alternative, they<br />
will rally to us. But quite apart from that I think there are<br />
two reasons why one doesn't have-a premature election for the<br />
House of Representatives: one is that as recently as May last<br />
year we sought, as the Liberals did, a three year term as a<br />
Government. And the public gave us that three year term. And<br />
accordingly we should fulfil the job which we sought. And the<br />
other reason is, that last April and May when we had the last<br />
Federal election, we were without a Parliament for three months.<br />
The two Houses were disolved on the 10th of April, And holding<br />
the election as quickly as possible and counting the votes as<br />
quickly as possible, we still couldn't assemble the new Parliament<br />
until the 9th of July. Now I don't think that in the present<br />
economic circumstances you can have the Parliament and the<br />
. Government and the administration suspended for three months.<br />
HARVEY: Its. been said Prime Minister that Mr Fraser has got<br />
himself into a corner. Now would you be prepared in anywayto a<br />
help Mr Fraser out of that corner, does it have to come to/ crunch?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh it's not he's got himself into this corner.<br />
He's done the wrong thing, as Mr Snedden did the wrong thing.<br />
HARVEY: ', Couldn't the two of you perhaps... </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh no. I've got a duty to see that the system<br />
is preserved under which, if the people elect a government it<br />
is given the opportunity to govern. I can't accept the proposition<br />
that whenever the Senate sees fit to force or wish an election<br />
for the House of Representatives then the House of Represenatives<br />
has to oblige the Senate. Because this situation can arise every<br />
six months, e very October the Parliament has to pass-the Budget<br />
for the period from the previous 1st of July to the following<br />
of June. And every April the Parliament has to pass the<br />
Supply Bills to cover the period from the 1st of July following<br />
to the 30th of November following. Twice a year this happens.<br />
Now since we became the Government the Liberals -,, more priual<br />
the Country Party have always threatened to block the Budget,<br />
to block Supply. Now if we accept that then no government which<br />
is elected will ever be able to govern with confidence or courage.<br />
Every government goes through unpopular patches. And any<br />
government which may have-to face the people in six months time<br />
will do the popular thing, and very often the irresponsible thing.<br />
All governments have to make some unpopular decisions, some tough<br />
decisions. And accordingly they must have the three year period<br />
in which to plan a whole program.<br />
HARVEY: Well given then, what you've said and the fact that<br />
Mr Fraser says that he has no intention of backing-down, how on<br />
earth is this going to be resolved?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well if it comes to the crunch, it is ' probable<br />
that the Government can govern without the Budget. We are.<br />
confident that all our employees, civilian and military, will<br />
be able to get their incomes. Furthermore, we are pretty<br />
confident that all our creditors and our suppliers and contractors,<br />
will be able to get their debts met. Now we are satisfied of that.<br />
It's a messy business, it's inconvenient to a lot of people but<br />
nevertheless, the Australian Government's obligations will be met.<br />
This doesn't say that there won't be a great deal of uncertainity<br />
and disruption in the business community; it's already feeling<br />
this. The Budget which is to be the principle instrument of economic<br />
recovery is being delayed. The other things . we've done;<br />
for instance, submissions to the Arbitration Commission are<br />
obviously working very well. We are now in a very much position<br />
than Augtranti ( ivorninonts , wore iriti. 1 quilto rocantllltO monitor </p>
<p>the money supply. In those respects thc Government is doing very<br />
well. But it needs the Budget.<br />
HARVEY: But you suggested a minute ago that you don't really need<br />
the Budget, you can go ahead and govern?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It is not the regular, the easy way to do it.<br />
There are legal ways to see that those people who depend on the<br />
Australian Government for their incomes, or their debts to be met,<br />
will in fact have all those obligations met. We are confident<br />
that this can happen. But its still this air of uncertainty,<br />
particularly among-the commercial community and the private<br />
sector which the Liberal and Country Party Senators are bringing<br />
about. HARVEY: Could it come to the crunch that you do have to govern<br />
without the Budget?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It might, it might. We are prepared to do that.<br />
And it is all completely legal. The methods upon which<br />
we have sought and got advice.<br />
HARVEY: Prime Minister, thank you. </p>
