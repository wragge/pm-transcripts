    <content><![CDATA[<p>4 September 1985</p>
<p>Over recent days, Australians have been saddened by the passing of two distinguished men who won international acclaim for the unique contributions they made to their respective professions.</p>
<p>The death yesterday of Professor Julius Stone is a sad loss for his family and for all those who benefitted so greatly from his ' teaching and writings. As one of the world's leading legal philosophers, he had a long and distinguished academic career at universities in England, the United States, New Zealand and, since 1942, in Australia. He held an honoured place in the international legal and academic communities for the insights and clarity of thought which he brought to bear on so many complex issues. Professor Stone's many publications reflected his wide range of interests from the peaceful management of relations between states to the defence of the inalienable rights of ordinary men and women. His contribution to public life was recognised with the award of an OBE (1973) and the order of Australia (1982).</p>
<p> Julius Stone will be remembered with affection and appreciation for the quality of his teaching, for the unique contribution that he made to the development and understanding of the law and, above all, for his essential humanity.</p>
<p>Sir Macfarlane Burnet who died on 31 August was a pioneer of medical research work. In a distinguished international career spanning nearly five decades, he was at the forefront of international developments in the fields of virology, biology and organ transplant theory. His work was recognised with numerous Australian and international honours and awards. His pioneering work on acquired immunological tolerance won him the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1960, with British scientist Sir Peter Medawar.</p>
<p> The medical breakthroughs which Sir Mac farlane's work represented contributed immeasurably to the achievements of medical science over recent decades and to enhancing the quality of life for so many of his fellow human beings.</p>
<p> In his later years, Sir Macfarlane contributed extensively to the debate on various issues of public concern. His views were always supported by intellectual vigour and honest conviction.</p>
<p> Sir Macfarlane's achievements at the forefront of medical knowledge together with his many writings will stand as enduring testimony to a great Australian.</p>
<p> I extend my sincere sympathy to the families of Professor Stone and Sir Macfarlane in their sad loss.  </p>
