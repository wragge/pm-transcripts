The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, announced today<br />
that he would leave Australia on 23 April to attend the<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kingston,<br />
Jamaica, and to pay official visits to Peru and the<br />
United States. He would return to. Australia on 11 May.<br />
Mr Whitlam said he would visit Peru from 24-27<br />
April. He would be in Kingston from 27 April 7 May and<br />
would then fly to Washington for a 27 hour visit. He would<br />
s pend two days in Tahiti on his way home.<br />
The Prime Minister said that he would be accompanied<br />
by the Special Minister of State, Mr Bowen.<br />
The Delegation would include the Secretaries of<br />
the Departments of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and of<br />
Foreign Affairs, Mr Menadue and Mr Renouf, the High<br />
Commissioners in London and Kingston, Sir John Bunting<br />
and Mr Hoyle, and the Deputy Secretary of the Department<br />
of Overseas Trade, Mr Scully.<br />
Mr Whitlam reaffirmed Australia's unswerving<br />
support for the Commonwealth as a unique multi-racial<br />
grouping. He recalled in this context that the Commonwealth<br />
was a voluntary association of 34 independent states,<br />
each responsible for its own policies, but consulting and<br />
co-operating in the common interests of their peoples to<br />
promote international understanding and world peace. Hie<br />
noted also the important non-governmental links which<br />
existed between professional and other associations in<br />
Commonwealth cQuntries.<br />
The Australian Gover ' nment, he said, attached<br />
particular importance to the development of co-operative<br />
international arrangements of this kind which would operate<br />
free from special allegiances to power blocs. The periodic<br />
Heads of Government meetings the-last was at Ottawa in<br />
1973 were an important aspect 6f Commonwealth co-operation.<br />
He would be going to Kingston to participate in wide-ranging<br />
discussions with other Commonwealth leaders on international<br />
matters and issues of common concern to Heads of Government.<br />
He and his colleagues would aim to play a full and active<br />
part in promoting further co-operation between member states<br />
in a number of areas where practical programs beneficial<br />
to the peoples of the Commonwealth were already in operation,<br />
such as education, the law, and science and technology. </p>
<p>lie was also looking forward to a detailed exchange<br />
of views, under the heading of world and Commonwealth trends,<br />
of changing power relationships and of world trade and<br />
financial matters, which he believed would be important<br />
subjects for consideration at this meeting.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that during his visit to Washington<br />
he expected to meet President Ford and Dr Kissinger, as<br />
well as members of the House International Relations<br />
Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.<br />
This would be his second meeting with, President<br />
Ford in just over six months and would provide a good<br />
opportunity for discussion of developments in power<br />
relationships, particularly in Indo-China, in the intervening<br />
period. His visit to Peru would be the first by an<br />
Australian Prime Minister toSouth America and he was glad<br />
of the opportunity to meet and hold talks with the President,<br />
General Juan Velasco Alvarado, the Prime Minister,<br />
General Morales Bermudez, and Government Ministers.<br />
He noted in this regard that Peru was an important<br />
Pacific state, which had played a major role in matters<br />
concerning the law of the sea and in the non-aligned<br />
movement. It was also a member of the Organisation of<br />
American States and the Andean Group of States. Australia<br />
has observe status with both organisations.<br />
