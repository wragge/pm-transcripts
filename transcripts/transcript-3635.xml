SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M, P.,<br />
TO A DINNER GIVEN BY THE AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY OF AUTHORS,<br />
SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE, 4 MARCH 1975<br />
I AM HONOURED THAT YOUR COMMITTEE OF MANAGEMENT<br />
HAS ARRANGED THIS EVENING FOR ME. THE LAST TIME I SPOKE<br />
AT THE OPERA HOUSE WAS IN THE ELECTION LAST MAY. I WAS<br />
IN THE COMPANY OF PATRICK WHITE, So YOU WILL SEE THAT I<br />
HAVE ALWAYS HAD SOME SUCCESS IN GETTING WRITERS ON SIDES<br />
NOW THAT AUTHO'RS ARE RECEIVING PUBLIC FUNDS, NOW YOU ARE<br />
ALL ON THE GOVERNMENT PAYROLL, I EXPECT AN EVEN BIGGER<br />
TURNOUT AT OUR NEXT OPERA. HOUSE MEETING, WHENEVER THAT<br />
MAY BE. IN THE MEANTIME IT IS A PLEASURE TO MEET SO MANY<br />
OF YOU PERSONALLY, NAMES FAMILIAR FROM INNUMERABLE DUSTJACKETS<br />
AND. TITLE PAGES, FROM COUNTLESS AIRPORT BOOKSTALLS AND<br />
LIBRARY SHELVES, ARE NOW FLESHED OUT IN LIVING FORM.<br />
IT IS GOOD TO BE AMONG YOU.<br />
MY WIFE OF COURSE HAS A MUCH GREATER REPUTATION<br />
AS A WRITER THAN I DO, NEVERTHELESS, I TAKE GREAT PRIDE<br />
IN THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO ESTABLISH<br />
THE PUBLIC LENDING RIGHT IN FULFILMENT OF ITS UNDERTAKINGS<br />
IN 1972, AUSTRALIA AND. NEW ZEALAND ARE THE ONLY TWO<br />
ENGLISH-SPEAKING COUNTRIES WITH THE PLR. DENMARK, SWEDEN<br />
AND NORWAY ARE THE ONLY OTHER NATIONS TO INTRODUCE IT.<br />
WE DON'T NORMALLY TAKE OUR LITERARY AND ARTISTIC STANDARDS<br />
FROM SCANDINAVIA EXPECT PERHAPS IN FILM MAKING BUT ON<br />
THIS OCCASION WE ARE IN THE VANGUARD OF A VERY IMPORTANT<br />
REFORM, </p>
<p>-2-<br />
FOR YEARS WE HEARD IT SAID THAT THE PLR WOULD BE<br />
. TOO DIFFICULT TO ADMINISTER, THAT THE LEGAL AND TECHNICAL<br />
PROBLEMS WOULD BE TOO GREA', IT WAS EVEN SUGGESTED THAT<br />
GOVERNMENTS SHOULD NOT GIVE ASSISTANCE TO WRITERS FOR FEAR<br />
OF COMPROMISING THEIR INDEPENDENCE. I THINK WE HAVE<br />
SHOWN THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE DIFFICULTIES OF PLR WERE NOT<br />
INSUPERABLE AFTER ALL, AND I DOUBT IF ANY OF YOU WILL BE<br />
EASILY SEDUCED BY THE SCALE OF PAYMENTS INVOLVED. WE<br />
DON'T SEE THE PLR AS A PRIVILEGE OR A BENEFIT FOR AUTHORS.<br />
WE SEE IT AS A R'IGHT. WE SEE'IT AS AN OVERDUE RECOGNITION<br />
OF SERVICES YOU HAVE GIVEN THE COMMUNITY; A PAYMENT FOR<br />
YOU WORK, MOST OF YOU WILL. ALREADY HAVE RECEIVED SOME<br />
AMOUNTS UNDER THE SCHEME, LAST WEDNESDAY I AUTHORISED THE<br />
FIRST PAYMENTS RECOMMENDED BY THE AUSTRALIAN AUTHORS<br />
FUND FOR THE 1974-75 FINANCIAL YEAR, AMOUNTING TO $ 440,000<br />
FOR AUTHORS AND PUBLISHERS,<br />
OF COURSE THIS IS NOT A LARGE SUM AS GOVERNMENT<br />
EXPENDITURES GO, BUT IT STANDS FOR SOMETHINU IMPORTANT,<br />
IT MEANS THAT AUSTRALIA AS A NATION RECOGNISES THE VALUE OF<br />
CREATIVE WRITING, THE PLACE OF LITERATURE AND THE ARTS' IN<br />
A ROBUST AND CIVILIZED SOCIETY. GOVERNMENTS CANNOT CREATE<br />
GOOD WRITING OR GREAT ART BUT THEY CAN CREATE THE CONDITIONS<br />
IN WHICH ART AND LITERATURE ARE MOST LIKELY TO FLOURISH.<br />
THEY CAN REMOVE UNNECESSARY HARDSHIP,-THE FINANCIAL ANXIETIES<br />
THAT INHIBIT MANY ARTISTS ANI) WRTT[ R EVEN WELL-ESTABLISHED<br />
AND SUCCESSFUL ONES. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
WRITING IS NOT THE tlt-Pt LUC1tATIVE PROFESSION, AND THE PLR<br />
WILL HARDLY MAKE IT SO; BUT AUTHORS NOW HAVE AN ADDITIONAL<br />
AND A6SURED SOURCE OF INCOME FROM THEIR WORK, AND THAT INCOME<br />
WILL FLOW TO THEIR DA8ENDANTS. I TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY<br />
TO INFORM YOU THAT. THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOW AGREED THAT PLR<br />
PAYMENTS AFTER AN AUTHOR'S DEATH WILL. BE MADE TO THE HUSBAND<br />
OR WIFE OF THE AUTHOR AND TO ALL THE'AUTHOR'S CHILDREN<br />
NOT JUST DEPENDANTS, OUR OBLIGATION TO WRITERS DOES NOT END:-WITH THE<br />
PLR. IT IS JUST OVER TWO YEARS SINCE I ANNOUNCED THE<br />
FOUNDING MEMBERSHIP OF THELITERATURE BOAPD, SINCE THEN WE<br />
HAVE DISBURSED ALMOST $ 2 MILLION FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN'WRITING AND PUBLISHING. OUR TOTAL BUDGET FOR<br />
THE ARTS THIS FINANCIAL YEAR IS $ 20 MILLION. THIS AGAIN<br />
IS A COMPARATIVELY MODEST SUM IN OVERALL GOVERNMENT<br />
SPENDING, BUT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE CRITICS WHO SEE IT ' 4.<br />
AS WASTEFUL, SOME PEOPLE REGARD ANY SPENDING ON THE.<br />
ARTS AS WASTEFUL. I DON'T, I BELIEVE THE ARTS ARE A<br />
PROPER, INDEED A PRIMARY, AREA OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITY.<br />
IT IS NOT SO MUCH THAT PRESENT EXPENDITURES ARE EXTRAVAGANT.<br />
BUT THAT PREVIOUS EXPENDITURES WERE INADEQUATE AND UNPLANNED.<br />
THE ARTS ARE A FIELD IN WHICH QUITE MODEST INVESTMENTS CAN<br />
BRING HIGH RETURNS. IT COSTS THE COMMUNITY VERY LITTLE TO GIVE<br />
A PROMISING AUTHOR AN INCOME FOR SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR,<br />
THE BENEFITS FROM SUCH EXPENDITURE THE RETURNS TO SOCIETY,<br />
AND ONE HOPES TO POSTERITY MAY WELL BE INESTIMABLE, </p>
<p>THE EMPHASIS IN OUR SUPPORT FOR THE ARTS HAS BEEN<br />
ON ENCOURAGING WORTHWHILE PROJECTS, ON DEVELOPING TALENTS,<br />
ON M~ VING HELP WHERE HELP IS NEEDED OILING THE MACHINE.<br />
TAKE PUBLISHING. IT IS PROBABLY TRUE THAT MOST BOOKS WORTH<br />
PUBLISHING WILL BE PUBLISHED ANYWAY, BlUT WHAT THE LITERATURE<br />
BOARD CAN DO IS MAKE PUBLICATION A LITTLE MORC PROMPT<br />
AND EASY. A SUBSIDY CAN BRING DOWN THE PRICE OF A BOOK AND<br />
MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO A WIDER AUDIENCE. OUR PRESENT<br />
SUBSIDY SCHEME. GOES FURTHER . THAN THE PRACTICE OF THE OLD<br />
COMMONWEALTH LITERARY FUND OF GUARANTEEING'A PUBLISHER<br />
AGAINST LOSS. I THINK THE LITERATURE BOARD-HAS HAD SOME.<br />
NOTABLE SUCCESSES IN HELPI NG THE PUBLICATION OF MORE AUSTRALIAN<br />
WRITING. IN 1972-73 NO MORE THAN 18 NOVELS WERE PUBLISHED<br />
BY THE LOCAL INDUSTRY. SUBSIDIES TO DATE HAVE HELPED THE<br />
PUBL ICATION OF 21 NOVELS AND 23 VOLUMES OF POETRY AND<br />
OTHERS, OF COURSE, HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED WITHOUT SUBSIDIES#<br />
SO THERE HAS BEEN SOME PORGRESS'HERE. QUANTITY DOES NOT<br />
ALWAYS MEAN QUALITY; BUT THERE ARE DEGREES OF QUALITY, AND<br />
WORK OF THE-HIGHEST MERIT MAY SOMETIMES RESULT FROM<br />
ENCOURAGEMENT GIVEN TO EFFORT OF A LESSER OR MOST MODEST KIND.'<br />
11 a, </p>
<p>WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS ENCOURAGE A WHOLE NEW<br />
CLIMATE IN THE ARTS, A NEW PERCEPTION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF<br />
THE ARTS IN THE LIVES OF AUSTRALIANS, AS WELL AS GREATER<br />
ACTIVITY AND GREATER VITALITY. WE WANT THE ARTS TO<br />
PERMEATE SOCIETY AT ALL LEVELS, TO BE AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE<br />
WHO WANTS THEM AND) DARE ONE SAY IT TO SOME . PEOPLE WHO<br />
DON IT: FUNDAMENTALLY, OUR ASSISTANC'E TO THE ARTS IS NOT<br />
INTENDED TO BENEFIT ARTISTS THEMSELVES, THOUGH INEVITABLY<br />
IT DOES, AND ONE WOULD NOT WISH IT OTHERWISE: IT IS<br />
INTENDED AS A SOCIAL MEASURE, PART OF A COMMITMENT TO THE<br />
QUALITY OF. PEOPLE IS LIVES. NOT THE LEAST OF-THE SOCIAL<br />
AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEPRIVATIONS AT THE HEART OF OUR<br />
CONTEMPORARY URBAN MALAISE IS THE INADEQUACY OF ARTISTIC AND<br />
CULTURAL STIMULATION; A LACK OF ACCESS TO THE ENRICHMENTAND<br />
STIMULATION THAT THE ARTS ALONE CAN BRING. W~ E DON'T WANT<br />
TO BE POMPOUS OR PATRONISING ABOUT SUCH THINGS. IT IS NOT<br />
FOR GOVERNMENTS TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT THEY SHOULD LIKE. IT<br />
IS, HOWEVER, A RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE THE<br />
BENEFITS AND REWARD S OF OUR CIVILIZATION AND INDEED OTHER<br />
CIVILIZATIONS AS WIDELY AVAILABLE AS POSSIBLE. CERTAINLY<br />
IREGARD THAT AS A DUTY OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS<br />
SUCH AS MINE.-OPPORTUNITIES FOR CULTURAL AND ARTISTIC<br />
ENJOYMENT SHOULD BE-PROVIDED , READILY, AND AS EQUALLY, AS<br />
OPPORTUNITIES FOR EDUCATION OR HEALTH. IT MAY EVEN BE<br />
ARGUED THAT THE ENJOYMENT OF THE ARTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART<br />
OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH. 9 e/ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
I HOPE THE ASSISTANCE WE ARE GIVING TO AUTHORS<br />
WILL ENCOURAGE A STRONGER INDIGENOUS LITERARY COMMUNITY.<br />
IN-PARTICULAR, I HOPE IT WIL. L ENCOURAGE AUSTRALIAN<br />
WRITERS ABROAD TO RETURN TO AUSTRALIA. I DON'T BLAME<br />
AUTHORS FOR WANTING TO WORK ABROAD; FAR BE IT FROM ME<br />
TO DISPARAGE THE IMPORTANCE OF OVERSEAS TRAVEL. FOR THOSE<br />
LIKE COLIN SIMPSON, WHO WRITE TRAVEL BOOKS, I SUPPOSE<br />
SME TRAVEL. IS ESSENTIAL. NOW THAT WE HAVE THE PLR I MAY<br />
BE ENCOURAGED. TO KEEP A DIARY OF MY OWN, As OSCAR WILDE<br />
SAID I LIKE SOMETHING SENSATIONAL TO READ ON THE TRAIN.<br />
OUR MISFORTUNE WAS THAT TOO MANY WRITERS WHO TRAVELLED<br />
ABROAD PREFERRED NOT TO LIVE IN AUSTRALIA. THERE WAS A<br />
CLASS OF EXPATRIATE AUSTRALIAN WHOSE CRITICAL FACULTIES,<br />
WHOSE POWERS OF SOCIAL OBSERVATION, WERE SORELY NEEDED AT<br />
HOME. WE WERE THE POORER FOR LOSING THEM. I KNOW THAT IN<br />
MANY WAYS AUSTRLAIA CANNOT PROVIDE ALL THE STIMULATION A<br />
WRITER NEEDS; ALL THE EXPERIENCE OR ALL THE PECUNIARY<br />
REWARDS. NEVERTHELESS, I SEE OUR ASSISTANCE TO WRITERS,<br />
IN PARTICULAR THE PLR, AS SYMBOLS OF A DEVELOPING<br />
CULTURAL MATURITY. I HOPE THEY WILL BE A: PRACTICALN CINCENTIVE<br />
To AUSTRALIAN AUTHORS TO LIVE AND WORK-IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY. 17 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
WE HAVE IN AUSTRALIA A RICH AND REMARKABLY DIVERSE<br />
' LITERARY HERITAGE. THE LABOR PARTY OWES MUCH TO IT.<br />
CONSIDERING OUR COMPARATIVELY SMALL POPULATION, OUR<br />
CONTRIBUTION TO WESTERN LITERATURE HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARY.<br />
THE STIMULUS WE ARE GIVING TO THE OTHER ARTS, TO THE THEATRE.-<br />
AND TO THE FILM AND TELEVISION INDUSTRIES, WILLCREATE<br />
WIDER OPPORTUNITIES FOR AUSTRALIAN WRITERS. THESE<br />
OPPORTUNITIES MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO COMPROMISE ARTISTIC<br />
STANDARDS. SADLYo OUR REPUTATION ABROAD IS NOT ONE OF<br />
HIGH CULTURAL ATTAINMENT11. IDEPLORE THE INFLUENCES IN THE<br />
MEDIA, IN ENTERTAINMENT THAT PERPETUATE A DEBASED AND<br />
DISTORTED VIEW OF OUR SOCIETY. ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THE<br />
COUNCIL FOR THE ARTS UNDER THIS GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN THE<br />
PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE IN ALL FIELDS OF ART; IT IS FOR<br />
WRITER S AND PUBLISHERS TO PRESERVE THESE STANDARDS IN OUR<br />
WRITING. BE WARY OF THE PRETENTIOUS; DON'IT BE SATISFIED<br />
WITH THE SLIPSHOD OR THE SECOND-RATE, WITH SECOND-HAND OR<br />
DERIVATIVE IDEAS. IF AUSTRALIAN WRI'TING IS TO HAVE ADISTINCTIVE<br />
PLACE IN WORLD LITERATURE IT WILL'BE BASED<br />
ON AN AUTHENTIC AND ORIGINAL STYLE. OUR BEST WRITING HAS<br />
ALWAYS REFLECTED OR EMBODIED SOME PECULIAR. TRUTH ABOUT<br />
OURSELVES, WHETHER EXPOSING SOCIAL INJUSTICE OR REVEALING<br />
QUALITIES IN THE AUSTRALIAN CHARACTER. THIS HAS NOTHING<br />
TO DO WITH CRUDE NATIONALISM. GREAT-WRITING IN EVERY SOCIETY,<br />
ESPECIALLY GREAT FICTION, WHILE DEALING IN UNIVERSAL HUMAN<br />
VALUESo HAS CHOSEN DISTINCTIVE NATIONAL AND REGIONAL<br />
IDIOMS. IT IS THROUGH SUCH NATIONAL IDIOMS THAT THE BEST<br />
WRITING HAS ACHIEVED ITS TIMELESS QUALITY AND BROUGHT US<br />
CLOSER TO A DEEPER KNOWLEDGE OF OURSELVES AND OF HUMANITY. </p>
<p>I HOPE I WILL BE FORGIVEN THIS SOMEWHAT PORTENTOUS<br />
NOTE. THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ARTS IS BY NO MEANS THE<br />
LEAST TROUBLESOME OF MY RESPONSIBILITIES; IT IS, HOWEVER,<br />
AMONG THE MOST SATISFYING. I LIKE TO THINK THAT WE ARE<br />
CREATING PRECEDENTS AND ESTABLISHING ADMINISTRATIVE<br />
PROCEDURES AND INSTITUTIONS THAT WILL-PERMANENTLY ENHANCE<br />
THE QUALITY OF ARTISTIC LIFE IN THIS COUNTRY. DO NOT<br />
IMAGINE THAT THE THINGS WE ARE DOING OUR BOARDS AND<br />
COUNCILS, OUR SPECIAL GRANTS AND SUBSIDIES ARE INVULNERABLE<br />
TO ATTACK. THEY ARE NOT. THEY MUST BE GUARDED'AND PRESERVED,<br />
THE CURRENT LEGAL CHALLENGE BY CERTAIN STATES TO THE<br />
VALIDITY OF THE REGIONAL EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT SCHEME AND<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE PLAN HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE<br />
FUTURE OF MANY KINDS OF ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS<br />
INVOLVING COMMONWEALTH GRANTS TO INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS.<br />
IF THIS CHALLENGE SUCCEEDS THE PLR WOULD BE AT RISK, YOUR<br />
SOCIETY, I NOTICE, IN AN EDITORIAL IN " THE AUSTRALIAN .4<br />
AUTHOR", HAS EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE SECURITY OF THE<br />
PLR AND URGED THAT IT SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED BY AN ACT OF<br />
PARLIAMENT. ACTS OF PARLIAMENT, OF COURSE, CAN ALWAYS BE<br />
REPEALED; THOUGH I ACKNOWLEDGE THE FORCE OF YOUR ARGUMENT.<br />
I ASSURE YOU IT WILL HAVE THE GOVERNMENT'S FULL CONSIDERATION. S </p>
<p>-9-<br />
Two YEARS AGO, WHEN I ANNOUNCED OUR INTENTION TO<br />
ESTABLISH THE AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL FOR THE ARTS AS AN<br />
INDEPENDENT AGENCY, I SAID THIS ABOUT OUR GENERAL POLICY<br />
FOR THE ARTS: " THE POLICIES WHICH my GovERNMENT'WILL PURSUE<br />
WILL HAVE A TWO-FOLD OBJECTIVE THE PURSUIT OF<br />
EXCELLENCE AND THE SPREAD OF INTEREST AND<br />
PARTICIPATION, WE WILL SUPPORT THE NATIONAL<br />
INSTITUTIONS AND PROGRAMS WHICH PRODUCE, SUSTAIN<br />
AND DISPLAY THE TOP LEVEL OF PROFESSIONAL<br />
ACHIEVEMEN4T IN THE'ARTS THE . MAJOR THEATRE<br />
COMPANIES AND ORCHESTRAS, THE NATIONAL GALLERY<br />
AND COLLECTION, AND SMALLER GROUPS AND PARTICULAR<br />
PROJECTS OF HIGH QUALITY. BUT OUR SUPPORT FOR<br />
ESTABLISHED ORGANISATIONS AND ART FORMS WILL<br />
BE BALANCED BY A STRONG PROGRAM OF ENCOURAGEME4T<br />
FOR EXPERIMENT AND DEVELOPMENT, AND FOR NUMEROUS<br />
SMALLER GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS, WHOSE ACTIVITIES<br />
BRING ENJOYMENT TO MANY PEOPLE...<br />
"' VITALITY IN THE ARTS IS FREQUENTLY ACCOMPANIED<br />
BT INNOVATION, BY CONTROVERSY AND BY CHALLENGE<br />
TO ESTABLISHED CONVENTIONS OF TASTE, BELIEFS AND<br />
BEHAVIOUR. ARTISTS NEED PROTECTION FROM<br />
UNNECESSARY RESTRAINTS, AND GOVERNMENTS<br />
BE ABLF TO RESIST PRESSURE FROM THOSE WHO ARE<br />
DISTURBED BY CONTROVERSY AND CHALLENGE." .1/ 10 </p>
<p>THESE REMAIN OUR OBJECTIVES, THE PLR AND OUR OTHER<br />
PROGRAMS FOR AUTHORS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THESE AIMS. I<br />
COMMEND THE WORK OF YOUR SOCIETY IN HELPING US DEVELOP AND<br />
IMPLEMENT OUR PROGRAMS, WE DON'T LOOK TO WRITERS JUST<br />
FOR ENTERTAINMENT OR ESCAPE, THOUGH GOOD ENTERTAINMENT IS<br />
A HIGH AND NECESSARY CRAFT. WE LOOK-TO YOU ALSO FOR<br />
THAT SPIRIT OF INNOVATION, CONTROVERSY, OF CHALLENGE,<br />
THAT IS THE BASIS OF ALL CHANGE AND ALL TRUE PROGRESS.<br />
AUSTRALIA WILL ALWAYS NEED MORE WRITERS. WE WILL ALWAYS<br />
NEED BCTTER WRITERS, AND BETTER WRITERS WHO ARE BETTER OFF.<br />
I KNOW THE GOVERNMENT CAN COUNT ON YOUR SUPPORT, JUST AS<br />
YOU THE WRITERS AND AUTHORS OF AUSTRALIA CAN COUNT<br />
ON OURS, </p>
