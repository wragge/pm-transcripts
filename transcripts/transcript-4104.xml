PRIMIZ M~ AINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS APRIL 1976<br />
ELECTORAL TALK<br />
Australians everywhere in cities, rural townships and small<br />
farming communities are fully aware of our national problems.<br />
7uztralians, I believe, also know of the Government's pledge to<br />
ovez: rcome these problems and are looking confidently to the future.<br />
O _ r policies that aim to get Australia on its feet again bave<br />
been clearly mapped out and spelled out to every segment of<br />
Australian society.<br />
But because of our seeming single iiiinded occupation with inflation,<br />
budget deficits, stimulation of consumer spending and investment<br />
in the private sector many people are unaware of our work in<br />
political, legal and social reform.<br />
The Liberal. Party is part of a tradition that has alwal-3 believed<br />
in progressive reform.<br />
This tradition achieved the secret ballot; the factory acts which<br />
helped secure decent working conditions for Australians; the<br />
ending of convict transportation; the system of tarrif protection;<br />
and the concept of a fair wage and the arbitration system which<br />
is the envy of the Western World.<br />
Today, the Liberal National Country P:% rty Coalition is continuing<br />
with reform programmes.<br />
These programmes differ from the so-called reforms of the previous<br />
Government in many ways and I will touch on this later.<br />
One of our most important contributions to social reform in the<br />
area of the riglhts of citizens in relation to decisions of<br />
government officials.<br />
we are concerned that people directly affected by the decisions of<br />
officials should have proper and aaequate rights of appeal and recourse.;.<br />
To this end, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will be brought<br />
into operation later this year. / 2 </p>
<p>This Tribunal will provide ind'ividuals with two specific sfeguardi.<br />
it wi. lilr . ptr ovide a totally in1 1, dz6L ze v -Lew Lilt way LL<br />
which Ministerial and official discretions are used. It will also<br />
deal with appeals against administrative decisions on as wide a<br />
basis as possible. In other words, this will be a citizens tribunal.<br />
Another social reform that ! oncerns the individual riahts of all<br />
meii and women is the creation of a federal Ombudsman.<br />
When in Opposition, we supported this concept. The Ombuasman<br />
legislation lapsed when the national Parliament dissolved late<br />
last year, and we are now in the process of reviewing that legislation<br />
The task of the Ombudsman would be to investigate complaints or to<br />
initiate enquiries concerning administrative actions of Federal<br />
departments and authorities.<br />
I believe that provision could be made for the Ombudsman to report<br />
direct to the Prime Minister in some circumstances. This could<br />
happen if the Ombudsman believed that his recommendations had net<br />
been adequately carried out by the bo'dy concerned.<br />
Because of the growing complexity of Government and because of<br />
: lack of information for some disadvantaged groups and migrants<br />
many people are unaware of how to get redress when problems do occur.<br />
Clearly, this makes the appointment of an Ombudsmaai ail the more<br />
important.<br />
Alongside specific measures we have taken to slow down the growth<br />
of bureaucracy we are equally determined that people are not<br />
unjustly treated as a result of bureaucratic decisions.<br />
Both the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Ombudsman will be<br />
s'ignificant steps towards that objective.<br />
Taking this a step further problems of securing protection for<br />
individual arise for the poor and disadvantaged in particular.<br />
We believe that no one must be denied justice because of their<br />
economic position.<br />
The Attorney-General is at present reviewing the legal aid<br />
situation to determine the most efficient, economical and simple<br />
system of distributing this aid.<br />
It is worth noting that in some areas the current legRl rights<br />
of some groups should be increased by new legislation. Land<br />
rights for aboxiginals is such a case. Cabinet will shortly<br />
discuss details and legislation will be introduced in the national<br />
Parliament after a thorough liaison with all the people it affects.<br />
I said earlier that our reforms differed from those of our<br />
predecessors in many ways. Surely the first rule of any reform<br />
is that the costs should not outweigh the benefits.<br />
Unlike Labor, we believe that the pure act of spending money on<br />
welfare programmes is imply not good enough. ./ 3 </p>
<p>It is clear that a very large number of problems which trouble<br />
Australians cannot be solved simply be spending more money.<br />
This is oecause they are not financial problems. They are<br />
problems of human relations, of organisation and approach.<br />
Assistance should be provided in a way that helps people to<br />
be independent not dependent on Government.<br />
Government assistance should not feed dependence but as far as<br />
possible expand people's capacity to meet their families needs<br />
as they see fiL.<br />
Unfortunately, over the last couple of years some of the weakest<br />
sections of the Australian community have suffered most as a<br />
result of the failure to see Government spending as being only<br />
one element in a programme of responsible and progressive reform.<br />
This Government strongly believes that assistance for the<br />
disadvantaged and needy will be effective only in an economic<br />
climate where inflation is controlled and where the nation can<br />
afford the bill. </p>
