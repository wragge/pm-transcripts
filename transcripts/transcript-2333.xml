COMMONWEALTH'S OFFER ON RURAL RECONSTRUCTION<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
There is no need for a Premiers' Conference on the offer made<br />
by the Commonwealth to tackle the problem of rural reconstruction,<br />
farm adjustment, and retraining of farmers who decide to leave the land.<br />
This is a Commonwealth initiative and a Commonwealth offer<br />
aimed at helping the rural community in all States. If-the Government of<br />
any State does not wish to join in that scheme, or to accept that offer,<br />
that is a matter for the Government a! that State to explain to the rural<br />
community in that State. Those States which do accept the offer can proceed<br />
with the scheme. It is untrue to say that yesterday's meeting of Ministers was abortive.<br />
There was unamimous agreement by all Ministers present on the basic princip]<br />
of the Commonwealth approach as set out in the press release, and<br />
Commonwealth and State officers met in Canberra today to begin discussions<br />
on the details of proposals.<br />
Furthermore, the Commonwealth does not want the States " to<br />
guarantee the financial aspects of a scheme which it promotec.<br />
It does want a State, if it agrees to administer the scheme within<br />
a framework laid down by the Commonwealth, to accept responsibility<br />
for loss if that loss results from a State's faulty administration of monies<br />
provided by the Commonwealth.<br />
