Mr. Spoak., er,, Acoreseuatation of this bill marks an<br />
historic occasion folr thne national carcital, and, therefore, for<br />
the nation. The Canberra University College was established by<br />

the Canberrla -Un-iesity Coll-ee. Therefor. eatog te<br />

those corncerned, that chior-e is e~ i rofound arLPreciation of<br />
the wo-rk that has bcoe--oacc, r. e-d by the University of Melbourne.<br />
The Canberra eLec annide strth e., AuStralian National </p>
<p>University will always be profoundly indebted to it. I acknowledge<br />
that debt writh great pleasure.<br />
Jhen the ultimate decision was taken that there should<br />
be association and not a development of the college into a<br />
separate entity, thereby providing two universities in Canberra,<br />
I asked the representatives of the college and of the university<br />
to get together and to work out the broad outline and, as far as<br />
possible, the details of an association which, in their view,<br />
would work satisfactorily. I am very happy to say that from the<br />
time when they were asked to do that, every attitude of hostility<br />
to the change seemed to me to disappear. They sat down together;<br />
they worked together? they rose to the highest standards<br />
of their occupation, and in the result they rwere able to produce<br />
to me the terms of their agreement, and two or three points of<br />
disagreement, some reeks before the date that I had asked them<br />
to observe. Before I go on to describe the scheme, I think that I<br />
should say that we thought it desirable to reinforce our minds<br />
by reference to the chairman of the famous Murray committee, by<br />
reference to the committee's report, and by reference to the<br />
newly constituted Universities Commission under the chairmanship<br />
of Sir Leslie Martin. From those sources we obtained marked<br />
confirmation of the idea that there should be an association and<br />
that there should not be a continued separation of the university<br />
and the college.<br />
Perhaps I should indicate quite briefly the princiF.'<br />
reasons for our conclusion that the two bodies ought to be associated;<br />
The first is that if the Canberra University College<br />
were to become a university of itself, as, say, " he C:.-berra<br />
Unive-sity, it would become and remain a second-rate university<br />
unless it were able to do all those things which a university of<br />
standing normally expects to do. In other words, it would not<br />
be able to confine itself to first degrees or even to the degree<br />
of maste It would have to look forward to research work, post<br />
-graduate work, and the further it proceeded into thatfield,<br />
which is a legitimate university field, the more would its work<br />
tend to overlap some of the work being done in the present<br />
Australian National University. Daplication of that kind is not<br />
to be readily contemplated in a comparatively smell city.<br />
In the second pl. ace, we thought it would be very difficult<br />
to justify the existence of two separate universities in<br />
Canberra, considering its population, at a time when the pressure<br />
for second and third universities in gren. t centres of population<br />
is mounting eve: y day. There is a tremendous amount of<br />
university development going on in Australia now, and I can assure<br />
honorable members that the pressure for it is beyond all<br />
belief. It might interest honorable members if I told them that<br />
the investigations of the Universities Commission so far have<br />
shot. wn that even the estimate made by the nurray Committee of the<br />
future undergraduate population in Australia an estimate which<br />
the committee thought was liberal, and which I am bound to say I<br />
too thought was liberal has been quite falsified already. The<br />
numbers eming forward are greater than anybody three years ago<br />
imagined would be the case.,<br />
In point of fact it is a great thing from the point of<br />
view of Australia to be able to say that by the end of another<br />
eight or nine years, on the present estimate of increased population<br />
and increased demand for university training, there will<br />
be in Australia~ if we can meet the demand, more undergraduates<br />
per 1,000 of population than in the United States, Canada, Great<br />
Britain or New Zealand. I am sure that honorable members will<br />
agree that that is all to che good. It eoans, howeJor, that there<br />
is a tremendous demand in the big centres, and in other centres<br />
perhaps less big but still very important, In those circumstances<br />
the existence of two separate universities in Canberra would<br />
be very hard to defend, </p>
<p>In the third place, Sir, \. JCel tha) t the) ro would be a<br />
great advantage in associ., ting a body, in uihichi mos' of the students<br />
are undergaduates with a body in which all the students,<br />
readers and professors are gradu,, tes of a liigh-order, This w~ ill<br />
give to the undeñ' gradu,. tes the benefit of an association, even<br />
if only occasionally, iritht eminent specialists in their branches<br />
of knowledge,, or study. To take a simple example, how many times<br />
have we heard a great physicist say prou " I worked under'<br />
Rutherford"? I am pe5-ffectly certain that this association will<br />

have a stimulatdn, effect on thosejs who arc -_ ngagi-_ ng in research,<br />
and the impact on the undergraduate of men of distinction and<br />
of gfreat intellect is bound. to be strong and memocraL_ oe<br />
Those were reasons whiich cormnded thei1asolvos to US,~<br />
but I thoughit it desirable to go hack to Sir Keith 1ñ 4u) rraY hienseif<br />
and to the Universities Co17-rnis s _ oi Let mne ro-r-ind thc Hlouse of<br />
what the Murray Committee said in its famous rcpo,:. I shnal<br />
quote thi-E one passage-<br />
It should be possible, in our view, to devise a term<br />
constitution gi'v ing to thae College al. l theo . nk:) ndcrece, ioperation<br />
which bothi the Nab'-ional Univorsity andl the Cc-,-<br />
logro desire, and yet ma'iekin-it possiblu for studeo2-Lts ait the<br />
College to receive degrees of thu Nation~ al Uni versity anr.<br />
for common services to bo org; ani zed and riisrn ninod xjithor 7<br />
unneccssary dupJA n,, iticn,.<br />
That was not a definito sta'emcntl but, so to F3-orK, .4t gave a<br />
broad hint of the way in which thc mind of the comm. nJceeo Iwac<br />

put to him the problem that T had been lookiLg at, in. ic e<br />
how my mind was running asnd I invited him to Cohallun ' o u'hat I~<br />

The Commission htas consineC~ red th-is iprobien,_ i Ti t; K<br />

and has unan4rnouF~ jy concludca that some of' a,. soc -ation<br />

reaching its decision to recoi-ioond in favour1 of associati. 1on,<br />
the Commission gave some th-ough-t to-I the rnean3 bywhh : L<br />
could be achieved. It seems to the Cornmissior: n~; e~ a<br />
that there should be one ' n~ ttboteo ho<br />
Australian National tjn-iesJity, and thiat it should culve one<br />
Council, with a Vice Chccallor as its chie*. f wciv<br />
officer.<br />
Then, Sir, we made our decision,. Jo put theio -attor to the-1 ' eT<br />

promptitude and with extreme cdw~~ Theiy worked ou a plar, o. 3<br />

It may well be that tllat IF so, but 1. asi: 1-onorable( m-mbers, i. r<br />

<p>in which its degrees could be g-, ive-n first degrees or as<br />
Mastar's degroes its degrees being g7iven at -oresent only in the<br />
higher reaches opscholairship and science.,<br />
Under these circumstances, I did not iuldisposed<br />
nor would the House, I aim sure to hagg-le about some details on<br />
which the two bodies had agreced, meirely because 1 -thought that,<br />
to use a modern phrase, thkey could have been more(-stream-lined,<br />
On the whole, I think it is g-ood scheme. I am suire that it<br />
will work. It will work all the bettelr Lt trio begi. nning if<br />
there is an atmosphere of -, oodwill,<br />
The) re was one point of difference t-o vA-icla 1 said I<br />
would refer. It relates to the awrarding ofL thedere of doctor<br />
in thei Austrcxd. ian National University the Ctc,.' e e of Doctor of<br />
Philosophy or Doctor of Science. The pre-s ent _ raULtie'Lna._ University<br />
attaches supreme importance, to thei pr-inciple that the<br />
standards on which those degrees are awalrded should be of thie<br />
highest, and that those standards should be maintained so that<br />
world recognition and prcstig. Ye will attach to the dere. That<br />
of course, is completely roight, The i,, etiena1 Univer-sity believed,<br />
theorefore, that thrr oiugh-u -to be controcl from-i its<br />
side of the university eve:: the stauldards for doctoral degrees.<br />
The Canberra University CoTI-ege rep Cosuntativ7cs, on the, other<br />
han, flt-hat ' hat might s gestthat doctorates in faculties<br />

question whothejr some of the morinbers to be a_ cintedo-_ to thec<br />

after consultation with'. ce.-tain sr. ccifi~ o&amp;: e :, sucL , as the<br />
Academy of Science, the Humanities. o Counci. l and. on.<br />
Mr. ; Jhitlam Includingz thae Social. ScJience., ~ ecrc Council. </p>
<p>MR. MENZIES Yes, all of them are in the same promises that<br />
building with which we are now familiar. I indicated that I<br />
did not think very highly of those provisions which find their<br />
way occasionally into statutes under which, when a nomination is<br />
to be made to a body of this kind by the Governor-General in<br />
Council, he is placed by statute under some rustriction or some<br />
obligation to other bodies. For myself, I am bound to say that<br />
so long as I have anything to do with this matter it will be a<br />
great pleasure to consult such bodies because they can contribute<br />
a great deal in this field. I have no doubt that that would<br />
become the regular practice, but I did not think it was desirable<br />
to put it as an inhibiting element in statute. I have had<br />
representations from one or two other bodies claiming that they<br />
ought to be allowed to nominate or to be consulted, and to them<br />
I made the same answer.<br />
I shall summarize pretty briefly, what the scheme is.<br />
The government of the university is to be vested in a council of<br />
38 persons. As I said before, this-is larger than we first expected.<br />
It had been hoped to make it about 30. But still on<br />
examination, if honorable members look at the constitution of<br />
the council in the bill, they will see that there has been a<br />
genuine attempt to give a balanced administrative authority.<br />
I may say also that, although this is not in the act<br />
itself, as honorable memburs know there is already provision<br />
for a convocation with certain functions. Although it is not<br />
necessary for us to legislete in this measure about that matter<br />
I did venture to say to them that I hoped that the new council<br />
would consider the possibility of adding to the convocation, as<br />
members of it, members of the Federal Parliament who happened to<br />
be university graduates. I think there is a bit of merit in<br />
th it. It would give more honorable members than could hope to<br />
have it at present, fairly close contact with what goes on.<br />
Jhether that suggestion will be agreeable or not I do not know,<br />
but it is not a statutory provision and it does not arise in<br />
this bill. Apart from these matters, Sir, what has been done, in<br />
this broad, is to take the present research sections and constitute<br />
them that zone inside the university as an Institute of<br />
Advanced Studies and the rest of it as a School of General<br />
Studies. This is merely to distinguish between what has gone on<br />
in one and what has gone on in the other.<br />
By having these two separate bodies each with its own<br />
professorial boards but under the council and the general administration<br />
of the vice-chancellor and with contact at all levels<br />
to produce co-operation, it is felt by both of the parties to<br />
this matter, and certainly by the Government and myself, that we<br />
will develop a harmonious institution without, in any way,<br />
threatening what is vital in this matter the high standard of<br />
those research degrees which it has been the main object, or one<br />
of the main objects, of the Australian National University, to<br />
produce. That is really its second object, the first being, of<br />
course, to conduct research and to add to the general store of<br />
knowledge. As for the bill itself, it is not unduly long and it<br />
is, in 1l rge measure, almost entirely I -would hope entiroly<br />
self-explanatory. But what I have said will perhaps assist<br />
honorable members when they read the bill. When they do I am<br />
sure that they will cgree very warmly that this is not to be<br />
regarded merely as a marriage of convenience or a marriage under<br />
threat. It is to be regarded as fulfilling what was the ultimate<br />
-ibition regarding this university to make it a. n all-embracing<br />
university, one that will Cive the highest possible advantages<br />
in instruction and in reading to those who come as<br />
undergraduates and at the simo time make an honorable name in<br />
the world of learning and so bring great credit to this country. </p>
