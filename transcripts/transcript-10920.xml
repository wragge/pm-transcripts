    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p> Well thank you very much Mr McKenzie-Forbes. To my colleague</p>
<p> Teresa Gambaro, who is the Federal Member for Petrie, to John Hodges</p>
<p> over there who use to represent this electorate, and to the other</p>
<p> directors, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>It's an enormous pleasure for me to be here this morning. I'm</p>
<p> often asked by people, as I travel around our wonderful country, what</p>
<p> is the best thing about being Prime Minister of Australia. And the</p>
<p> best thing without doubt about being Prime Minister of Australia is</p>
<p> that you have an opportunity virtually every day, wherever you might</p>
<p> be, of meeting a different group of Australians -in their homes, in</p>
<p> their local community, in their local retirement village, wherever</p>
<p> it may be. And the remarkable thing is that every group is different.</p>
<p> Every group has something new or different to tell you and something,</p>
<p> quite often, a new or different piece of advice to give you and that</p>
<p> is part of the process of the exchange that ought to go on between</p>
<p> a Prime Minister and the people who he or she is elected to serve.</p>
<p> And I do want to take the opportunity this morning of saying a few</p>
<p> things to you about the plan we announced last week.</p>
<p>But before I do that I want to congratulate this retirement village</p>
<p> and indeed I want to congratulate all of those associated with providing</p>
<p> security, comfort, and a congenial living environment for Australia's</p>
<p> senior people and senior citizens. I don't just say it because</p>
<p> I'm addressing this audience but I'm very conscious that</p>
<p> that age cohort of Australians who are represented here today have</p>
<p> contributed so much to our country. The great bulk of you, at various</p>
<p> ages, have lived through a war. Some of you through a depression.</p>
<p> All of you through those years of post war reconstruction in Australia.</p>
<p> And you've all contributed so much and you all held through those</p>
<p> years to some constant enduring Australian values. And you've</p>
<p> created the society that people of my age and younger have the great</p>
<p> privilege of enjoying and I want to place on record my respect and</p>
<p> appreciation for the generation of Australians that you represent</p>
<p> and what you have done for our country.</p>
<p>And it's really doing something for our country which the tax</p>
<p> plan I announced last week is all about. People have talked about</p>
<p> this or that aspect of it but the most important thing about it is</p>
<p> that it is designed to help Australia and to help Australian families.</p>
<p> It is designed to make Australian stronger economically. It's</p>
<p> designed to help Australia export more and if we export more we'll</p>
<p> be more prosperous and we'll create more jobs. It's designed</p>
<p> to give more choice and more help to Australian families, those particularly</p>
<p> with young children. And it's got to be looked at as a whole.</p>
<p> We all like getting benefits but you can't really have benefits</p>
<p> without fundamental reform. The idea that there's a magic pudding</p>
<p> that somebody can come along and carve up and hand out without having</p>
<p> to sort of do anything to build and do anything to put it together</p>
<p> is of course wrong. We build a house and we have the most comfortable</p>
<p> room in it, the one we like to go to most frequently. But, of course,</p>
<p> unless that house is built on sound foundations than it's not</p>
<p> going to last for very long and the transitory comfort of that nice</p>
<p> room is going to disappear.</p>
<p>Now there's been, understandably, a bit of focus on how this</p>
<p> plan affects pensioners and self-funded retirees and I want to come</p>
<p> to that in a moment. But before I do could I just emphasise that the</p>
<p> most valuable thing about this plan is that it will, in a time of</p>
<p> some difficulty around the world, the economies of Asia have turned</p>
<p> down and that hasn't affected Australia too badly because we</p>
<p> are now much stronger than we were. But what we therefore must do</p>
<p> is to make ourselves even stronger. And some people are saying: well</p>
<p> when you've got trouble overseas you shouldn't try and change</p>
<p> anything. I say the reverse. I say because we have challenges overseas</p>
<p> we must change certain things that will make Australia stronger and</p>
<p> make Australia better. And the whole purpose of this plan is to give</p>
<p> us a new and better taxation system to help the entire Australian</p>
<p> nation, particularly our families. And I think everybody understands</p>
<p> that the present system is really on its last legs. But the present</p>
<p> system does need change. But we can't hope to go ahead, the whole</p>
<p> country, unless we have a better and a reformed taxation system. And</p>
<p> that's why we're doing it. We're not doing it for political</p>
<p> advantage. Some people have said to me you shouldn't raise something</p>
<p> like this perhaps a few months out from an election. But we are doing</p>
<p> it because we believe very very genuinely and very sincerely that</p>
<p> it will be good for our country. And I'm very personally committed</p>
<p> to it because I believe in here that this is good for Australia and</p>
<p> good for Australian families.</p>
<p>Now, like any other section of the community, pensioners and self-funded</p>
<p> retirees will say: well if it's good for Australia that's</p>
<p> good. But, not surprising, they say: well how does that affect our</p>
<p> position? And there are ten ways in which...within this plan, there</p>
<p> are ten particular ways in which protection is provided and benefits</p>
<p> are provided for pensioners and self-funded retirees. To start with</p>
<p> there is an up front, from the 1st of July 2000, increase</p>
<p> in the pension and all other like benefits. And that 4% increase takes</p>
<p> effect immediately on the 1st of July when the new plan</p>
<p> comes into operation. And part of the guarantee in relation to that</p>
<p> increase is that the pension will be permanently 1.5% above, 1.5%,</p>
<p> the increase in the pension, 1.5% above any increase that will flow</p>
<p> from price changes as a result of the introduction of a goods and</p>
<p> services tax. And some of you will say the introduction of a goods</p>
<p> and services tax will put everything up by 10%. It won't. And</p>
<p> the reason why it won't put everything up by 10% is that a lot</p>
<p> of things that now carry wholesale sales tax will come down in prices.</p>
<p> There are a lot of things you buy like detergent and soaps, and other</p>
<p> household items where there's a 22% wholesale sales tax. You</p>
<p> pay 12% wholesale sales tax on some biscuits, on flavoured milk. You</p>
<p> pay 32% when you buy a television or a video. You pay 22% when you</p>
<p> buy a family motor car. Now all of those will disappear and therefore</p>
<p> the price of many goods that you now buy will actually fall. Others</p>
<p> will go up. But it's because some come down and others go up</p>
<p> that it averages out, according to our calculations, at about 2%.</p>
<p>One thing a lot of people forget is that when they go to the supermarket</p>
<p> everything they buy in the supermarket, 20% of the cost of that is</p>
<p> attributable to transport. If fresh food, or canned food or anything</p>
<p> is, it doesn't just materialise on the supermarket shelf, it</p>
<p> has to be carried there. Now one of the big things about this plan</p>
<p> is that transport costs are going to be cut very very significantly</p>
<p> and they're going to be cut because the price of petrol for every</p>
<p> businessman will fall by seven cents a litre, and on top of that we're</p>
<p> going to give a very special big concession for the excise on diesel</p>
<p> which is the fuel used by most large trucks to carry things around.</p>
<p> And this is particularly important for Queenslanders because Queensland</p>
<p> is a very big State and it's a very decentralised State. Queensland</p>
<p> is the only State of Australia where the majority of people live outside</p>
<p> the capital city. So therefore a change which helps to reduce the</p>
<p> cost of carrying things around the State is particularly beneficial</p>
<p> to Queensland because there is more long distance haulage involved</p>
<p> in a decentralised State. That's a digression from the 4% increase</p>
<p> in the pension but I think an important one to explain it. So that's</p>
<p> the first thing.</p>
<p>The second thing is that for a long time now we've had a special</p>
<p> rebate for older people so that no part of the pension will be taxed</p>
<p> and we're going to increase that by $250 for a single person</p>
<p> and $350 for a couple. And thirdly we're going to increase the</p>
<p> pension free area, that's the amount of income you can have without</p>
<p> the pension being affected, by 2.5%. Fourthly, when the pension does</p>
<p> start to be withdrawn we're going to reduce the taper rate from</p>
<p> 50% down to 40%. In other words, instead of losing half for every</p>
<p> dollar of private income, that's going to be reduced to 40%.</p>
<p> There will of course, depending on your level of income, be reductions</p>
<p> for all Australians over and above any special provision for older</p>
<p> Australians there will be reductions in personal income tax. The tax</p>
<p> free threshold is going to be lifted to $6000. The bottom rate is</p>
<p> going to be cut from 20 down to 17%. And when you reach $20,000 of</p>
<p> income the rate will be 30% and that will apply right through to $50,000.</p>
<p> There will be no change at all in the tax rate between those two figures.</p>
<p> And that means about 60 to 70% of all wage and salary earners will</p>
<p> be able to, depending on their level of income, they will face a marginal</p>
<p> rate of 30% or less and that is a huge improvement on the present</p>
<p> situation.</p>
<p>The sixth thing that's of particular relevance to pensioners</p>
<p> and self-funded reitirees that for every person 60 and over there</p>
<p> will be savings bonus Â a one-off tax fee payment of $1000 in</p>
<p> relation to any investment income that you might have and that investment</p>
<p> income will be very broadly defined to include things like superannuation</p>
<p> and of course returns of dividends and interest savings and so forth</p>
<p> from the bank. And that's available for everybody 60 years of</p>
<p> age and over, pensioners and self-funded retirees. Then additionally</p>
<p> for self-funded retirees who are of pensionable age or above there</p>
<p> will be an additional $2000 one-off tax free bonus. And both of those</p>
<p> payments will be fully available for people whose income is up to</p>
<p> $20,000 and then it will phase out between $20,000 and $30,000.</p>
<p>Now the eighth benefit applies to those of you who may own shares</p>
<p> in companies. You know there's been a system now for some years</p>
<p> called imputation whereby the company is meant to pay the tax and</p>
<p> then it sends the dividend to you on which there's a...sends</p>
<p> you a franked dividend on which the company tax has been paid. Now</p>
<p> there's a lot of retired people, there's a lot of people</p>
<p> generally, where tax is deducted at, by the company at the company</p>
<p> rate of 36%. But because their rate of tax maybe only 20% or some</p>
<p> other figure below 36% at the margin they don't get the full</p>
<p> benefit. Now what we're going to do is to change that and under</p>
<p> the plan we're going to introduce what are called fully refundable</p>
<p> imputation credits on shares. And it means that if the company pays</p>
<p> the 36 and send you the rest and you're on a 17% rate or a 30%</p>
<p> rate you'll get a refund from the tax man, a cheque from the</p>
<p> tax man, that's always good, between the 17 and the 36 or the</p>
<p> 30 and the 36. And it will mean that people whose marginal rate of</p>
<p> tax is below the company rate will get the full benefit of the imputation</p>
<p> credit on the share.</p>
<p>Now there are two other things that I've left till the last because</p>
<p> I think they are of particular importance and particular benefit to</p>
<p> senior people. And they are the introduction, without an income test,</p>
<p> so therefore it's available to anybody, of a 30% tax deduction</p>
<p> or payment in relation to private health insurance. Now what this</p>
<p> means is that if you've got a private health insurance policy,</p>
<p> from the 1st of January next year, not from the 1st</p>
<p> of July in the year 2000, but from the 1st of January next</p>
<p> year, you'll be able to get 30% of that off either your tax or,</p>
<p> if you want to get it earlier, you pay the premium you can go along</p>
<p> to the Government office and they'll give you a cheque for the</p>
<p> 30%. Now if you've got a $2000 policy that will be worth $600.</p>
<p> And the present arrangement, which is a lot more modest, will of course</p>
<p> continue through to the end of this year and the new system will come</p>
<p> into operation on the 1st of January next year. And that</p>
<p> will be universally available. And at the present time the private</p>
<p> health insurance subsidy the maximum if $450 and that's for families.</p>
<p> It's a lower amount for couples and it's a lower amount</p>
<p> still for singles. And this of course won't discriminate at all</p>
<p> between those different people but obviously if you've got full</p>
<p> family cover that's a bit more expensive and the amounts that</p>
<p> you will get back will correspondingly be higher.</p>
<p>And the final thing of course that I wanted to mention is that part</p>
<p> of the plan is to abolish in full provisional tax. And I know from</p>
<p> my experience as a local member, I know from my experience as Treasurer,</p>
<p> I know from my experience as Prime Minister, and I also know from</p>
<p> my experience years ago as a provisional tax payer that provisional</p>
<p> tax is one of those things that did irk a lot of people. And it always</p>
<p> seemed that you were paying it a little bit ahead of time. You didn't</p>
<p> like the tax man suggesting that there was an automatic increase in</p>
<p> the amount of money you were going to earn from year to year and one</p>
<p> of the things that we find we're able to do as a result of the</p>
<p> changes that we've introduced is to abolish provisional tax.</p>
<p>Now I've taken some time ladies and gentlemen to go over some</p>
<p> of the particular features of the plan that relate to pensioners and</p>
<p> self-funded retirees. And I've done that because we spent a lot</p>
<p> of hours and devoted a lot of time in trying to get the balance right</p>
<p> because we are conscious that there is change involved in this and</p>
<p> people are naturally entitled, when change occurs, to be reassured</p>
<p> about the impact of that change on their own circumstances and that</p>
<p> particularly applies to people who are relying on investments and</p>
<p> who are relying on those investments to provide themselves with a</p>
<p> secure environment.</p>
<p>Now one of the things any Government can best do to help provide a</p>
<p> secure financial environement is to see that the level of inflation</p>
<p> is kept as low as possible. I know that lower interest rates are not</p>
<p> as good news for people relying on investments as they are for people</p>
<p> paying off a home. I'm able to say when I go around Australia</p>
<p> and I talk to home buyers, I'm able to say that under the Government's</p>
<p> policies we have reduced interest rates to their lowest level for</p>
<p> home buyers for 30 years. Now that's great if you're paying</p>
<p> off. If you're investing and you're relying on the interest</p>
<p> from that, well it's not so great. I understand that. And that</p>
<p> is why we have gone to some trouble and taken some care to ensure</p>
<p> that the changes that we are making, and I've listed many of</p>
<p> them that have particular relevance to older Australians, those changes</p>
<p> have been incorporated into the plan.</p>
<p>If I could just say one or two other general things and that is that</p>
<p> any government, no matter what stage it may be and no matter what</p>
<p> side of politics it may be, has a responsibility at various times</p>
<p> of its existence to stand up in front of the public and say: we believe</p>
<p> that something ought to be done for the long-term benefit of the country.</p>
<p> When I entered Parliament in 1974, which is just, in May of 1974 when</p>
<p> Mr Whitlam was half way through his term as Prime Minister, and a</p>
<p> few months after a entered Parliament there was a report tabled which</p>
<p> recommended a big change to Australia's taxation system and it</p>
<p> was called the Asprey Report. Some of you may remember that name.</p>
<p> It was chaired by a now deceased Supreme Court Judge of New South</p>
<p> Wales. And you know what it reccommended? It recommended the introduction</p>
<p> of a broad-based indirect tax. It recommended the abolition of the</p>
<p> wholesale tax system. It recommended a whole lot of the changes that</p>
<p> the Government has announced in the last few days. It recommended</p>
<p> reductions in personal income tax, it recommended some other things.</p>
<p> Not everything in the Asprey Report has been picked up by us but it's</p>
<p> very interesting that 23 years ago this expert report that had been</p>
<p> commissioned by the late Sir Billy Snedden who was Treasurer in the</p>
<p> Liberal Government, had been delivered to Mr Whitlam as Labor Prime</p>
<p> Minister and it recommended these things. And since then various people</p>
<p> have tried to change the system. And the reason they've tried</p>
<p> to change it is not because people enjoy changing things. I mean from</p>
<p> a point of view of ease and comfort the simple thing to do is to not</p>
<p> sort of change anything and just let things bubble along. The problem</p>
<p> is that that's not always the best thing for the country. And</p>
<p> the reason people have tried at various time to change it, I tried</p>
<p> on a couple of occasions when I was Treasurer in Mr Fraser's</p>
<p> Government. Mr Keating tried it when he was Treasurer in Mr Hawke's</p>
<p> Government. Dr Hewson, as Leader of the Opposition, tried before the</p>
<p> 1993 election and we've come back and we're putting in forward,</p>
<p> in a better form if I may say so, I hope with no immodesty, in a better</p>
<p> form than any of those that who've gone before me. But the reason</p>
<p> we've all tried is that deep down everybody knows that the present</p>
<p> system has to be changed, on both sides of politics. And at various</p>
<p> stages I can trawl through the records and I can find remarks made</p>
<p> by Mr Beazley and Mr Evans and Mr Keating and Mr Hawke as well as</p>
<p> myself and Dr Hewson and Mr Costello all saying that change is needed,</p>
<p> reform is needed. And it's very tempting when you're a politician</p>
<p> to say: we'll offer you the nice things without the reform. And</p>
<p> I think you all know from your life's experience that it's</p>
<p> never quite as simple as that.</p>
<p>So what we've tried to do on this occasion is put together a</p>
<p> total plan that will, above everything else, be good for our country</p>
<p> and good for Australian families. That's the most important thing</p>
<p> about it. And if I wanted people to think one thing of it, I would</p>
<p> want them to think that it was good for Australia and good for Australian</p>
<p> families because that at the end of the day is the thing that unites</p>
<p> all of us whether we vote Labor or Liberal or whatever our age is</p>
<p> or whether we were born in this country or whether we adopted this</p>
<p> as our country, and whatever our background may be, in the end we</p>
<p> are bound together by a common love of our country and a common concern</p>
<p> for our country's future. And that is the most important thing</p>
<p> about this and that is the reason why I am personally so very committed,</p>
<p> and we are putting it out for people to have a look at. We think it</p>
<p> will provide plenty of protection and plenty of reassurance for retired</p>
<p> people, for those on the pension. We believe it will be good for the</p>
<p> economy, it will make our exports cheaper, it will make production</p>
<p> costs for Australian businesses lower, it will therefore mean that</p>
<p> more jobs can be generated, and it has had a very strong response</p>
<p> from the business community, not because there are such enormous tax</p>
<p> cuts for the business community, and in fact there are none. What</p>
<p> there are for the business community are reductions in their costs,</p>
<p> because now when business operates things, when you run a business</p>
<p> you've got to pay taxes on many of your business inputs, simple</p>
<p> things like computers, you've got to pay tax on them. Under this</p>
<p> system you'd be able to get the tax, which will be at a lower</p>
<p> rate back, because that's how a goods and services tax operates.</p>
<p> There are a number items which are GST free. Doctors' bills,</p>
<p> dentists' bills, prescription drugs Â they are GST free.</p>
<p> Childcare expenses, education expenses are GST free. And that means</p>
<p> that you don't pay anything on them and the people who produce</p>
<p> them can get a full refund of their input credits. And we calculate</p>
<p> that the cost of, operating costs of doctors and childcare centres</p>
<p> will in fact fall. Nursing home fees are GST and so are hostel charges,</p>
<p> GST free. SO we have taken care to exclude from the GST those things.</p>
<p> We have included food and clothing for the simple reason that if you</p>
<p> leave out very big items like that, then other people will say why</p>
<p> don't you leave something else out and you'll end up back</p>
<p> with the present system which has become so unworkable. And providing</p>
<p> you get the compensation right and providing you build in these other</p>
<p> protections and benefits then all of that I think will work out for</p>
<p> the benefit of the country.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I have appreciated this opportunity and I thank</p>
<p> you very very warmly for your patience and willingness to listen.</p>
<p> It is my responsibility as Prime Minister to explain to you and to</p>
<p> explain to millions of Australians why I think this is good for our</p>
<p> country and for our country's families, and to direct my comments</p>
<p> to areas that they particularly effect, because that is accountability</p>
<p> in politics is all about. Now, I think this is a good plan for our</p>
<p> country's future. I'm putting it out before the election</p>
<p> so people so will know about it when they vote, whenever that may</p>
<p> be. I don't want to be in a position of saying nothing about</p>
<p> it before the election and then bringing it in afterwards, because</p>
<p> that would be quite dishonest. And I want people to know exactly what</p>
<p> I am going to do before the election so that they can make their judgment</p>
<p> and I think if they consider the long term future of Australia and</p>
<p> if they look at the way in which it effects them, then I believe,</p>
<p> and I certainly hope that they will come to a very positive conclusion.</p>
<p>But whatever conclusion you come to, that is your perogative as an</p>
<p> Australian and I will accept the judgment of the Australian people</p>
<p> with the very best of grace and good will because I have an enormous</p>
<p> regard for their common sense. So thank you very much, Sir, for inviting</p>
<p> me along, and thank you very very much for listening and I look forward,</p>
<p> over a cup of tea perhaps, of wandering around and chatting to you</p>
<p> and answering any questions you have to put to me. But thank you,</p>
<p> and good luck to all of you and it has been a very great privilege</p>
<p> for me to have an opportunity of talking to you this morning.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
