    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>On behalf of all Australians I congratulate Pope Benedict XVI on his assuming the throne of St Peter.  He comes to the leadership of the Catholic Church at a very important time of both challenge and opportunity for Christianity around the world.  He's a very sound theologian, he's a person who will reach out, as did his great predecessor, not only to Christians around the world, in all parts of the world, but also to people of other faiths.  It's an enormous responsibility, but he comes to it with a wonderful background of great service in the church.  I believe that he will give great leadership to the Catholic Church and will be a source of reassurance to the Christian Church generally throughout the world.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, might you seek some more information on the new Pope from Cardinal Pell on his return to Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I have read quite a bit about him already.  I will obviously talk to Cardinal Pell, but the choice has been made and it's one that I believe that the Church will feel comfortable with and will come behind their new leader.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The new Pope will maintain and perhaps even reinforce the conservative line of his predecessor, does that have any impact on Australian policy?  I'm thinking specifically of an attempt to renew the abortion debate by Senator Boswell.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Malcolm, I'm not going to get into speculation about what the new Pontiff is going to do and the direction that he will give.  Like all people who come to that position he will bring his own brand of leadership, clearly of course guided by the beliefs and the practices and the doctrines of his Church.  But I'm not going to endeavour to translate that into a domestic political environment.  I don't think that is appropriate, certainly at this time.</p>
<p>Thank you.  </p>
