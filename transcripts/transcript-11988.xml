<p>E&amp;OE................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, on the issue of the economy, the IMF has released a report overnight which is a fairly gloomy outlook for Australia. Are you revising the options on a deficit for the budget this year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, that report, which I've had a look at, which Simon Crean completely misrepresented this morning, that report is very much in line with our own forecasts. It says the main driver of a slower economy this year, that's 2001, are external economic pressures. It is, in fact, complimentary of the Government's tax reform programme, unlike what Mr Crean suggested on the AM programme this morning. And it's very much in line with what we're saying about the economy and there's nothing in that that would cause us to significantly alter our own economic forecasts.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does it make looking out for and hoping for a surplus that much harder?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it doesn't.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So you're not holding anything back from the Australian public.?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I mean, I suppose if you don't have a policy you've got to say something when somebody puts a microphone in front of your face. But we're not holding anything back. We'll deliver a budget that's right for the economic circumstances. We aim to have the budget in balance. It's appropriate to have a balance. And we'll, of course, be releasing, with the budget, the details about our economic forecasts.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>He said the Government seems to be holding back forecasts on unemployment.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, that's not true either. We're not doing anything of the kind.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, on the issue of China and Taiwan - the Chinese Embassy wasn't very happy with your comments of yesterday. Were they misinterpreted?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I thought the action of the Embassy was unnecessary and I would point out, if they look at the totality of what I said, that I would want to see everybody involved exercise a degree of calm and restraint. We adhere, as a country, to a One-China policy. We would expect both China and Taiwan to show restraint in the cross-strait relations between those two entities. But I don't think the Embassy reaction was either appropriate or necessary.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you mean by inappropriate, was it wrong?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I meant what I just said.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is it time for cool heads, Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is it a time for cool heads?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's always a time for cool heads. I don't.it's always a time for cool heads in a situation like this, but we have to keep it in perspective. We want both China and the United States to take a longer view.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would you be seeking to explain privately your comments?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Only if some explanation of them is sought. I've had no approach, my Office has had no approach from the Chinese Embassy.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On petrol prices, do you share the view of some that the petrol companies are being greedy?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what I said yesterday I repeat today, and that is that the ACCC should look at what's happened and I don't resile from that for a moment. The public anger at the sharp increase on ANZAC Day is palpable and understandable. They want that investigated. The ACCC has the power to do it. I don't know the cause of it but I don't retreat for a moment from what I said yesterday that the ACCC should throw the book at the companies if there's any evidence of collusion.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are the oil companies right to be trying to garner public and consumer sympathy by saying they like any other company in Australia, or sector, deserve a fair go?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think the Australian consumers deserve a fair go. They're the people I'm most concerned about, the Australian consumers getting a fair go at the bowser. Now, we do have high world oil prices and that is the main reason why the price is so unacceptably high. And it has been, for the last two years, the main reason. But when you have a big jump like this on a public holiday and it seems to happen in most parts of the country, the public is entitled to react negatively and they want that investigated. That's what I'm saying.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is some sort of regulated system, similar to what the US operates with the oil companies, would that be worth considering?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't know that the American situation can be made directly referable to Australia. But we are interested in any alternatives but the ACCC has got power to investigate. It's quite a strong body, it can be a very effective body and it's the right body to be having a look at it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, on the issue of immigration detention centres, would you be rethinking on reconsidering the management of centres, such as the Port Headland Detention Centre, in light of the manager there.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Mr Ruddock is available for the media in Sydney today, I understand. I think it would be better that he dealt with that question.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you concerned at all about the management.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have every confidence in the way Mr Ruddock is running is portfolio.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And every confidence.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Every confidence. Thank you.</p>
