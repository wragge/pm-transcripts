    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister today was honoured to accept his appointment as official patron of the Northern Territory Football Club that will take part in the Queensland Australian Football League (AFL) competition for the first time in 2009.</p>
<p>Today's announcement marks the realisation of AFL NT's vision and builds on the Rudd Government's $2.5 million in funding to support an NT team to enter a major league competition and to support the development of AFL and Netball in the NT.</p>
<p>The new Northern Territory Football Club will provide Territorians with a home grown team in a major competition.</p>
<p>AFL NT has for some time been seeking to join a state AFL competition to provide a more effective pathway for elite players to participate at the highest level, as well as provide role models for junior Northern Territory players.</p>
<p>Some of the great names in AFL history forged their careers in the NT including Michael Long; Maurice Rioli; Michael McLean, Gilbert McAdam and current stars Peter Burgoyne, Cyril Rioli and Andrew McLeod (current All Australian captain).</p>
<p>There are currently 28 Northern Territory players on AFL Club lists.</p>
<p>But many of the NT's top players have had to leave Darwin and Alice Springs in order to pursue their pathway into the AFL.</p>
<p>With the establishment of Northern Territory Football Club, these players can now stay at home.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government's funding will be used to employ players on traineeships and apprenticeships.</p>
<p>All players will be required to either work full-time, or undertake study through school, university or TAFE, or complete a traineeship or apprenticeship. This will provide players with invaluable life skills that they can take back to their communities after their playing career with the Northern Territory Football Club.</p>
<p>The team will have training bases in Darwin and Alice Springs. Alice Springs will provide a hub for players from Central Australian communities to train and play.</p>
<p>In 2008-09, $230,000 has been earmarked for the following development initiatives:</p>
<p>     * regional Development Managers and trainees employed in the Barkly and Alice Springs Communities to deliver football and educational programs;</p>
<p>     * coaching and umpiring development clinics;</p>
<p>     * delivery of schools programs; and</p>
<p>     * delivery of various regional carnivals, and support of development camps and junior programs.</p>
<p>     * The Territory Team will be coached by Michael McLean, a member of the AFL Indigenous Team of the Century. He played more than 200 AFL Games and twice was named Brisbane Bears Best &amp; Fairest.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government commitment to Northern Territory Football Club is in partnership with the NT Government, the AFL, ERA/Rio Tinto, Pratt Foundation and Qantas.</p>
