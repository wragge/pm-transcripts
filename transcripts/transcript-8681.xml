PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATTNG, MP<br />
DOORSTOP PACIFIC DUNLOP HOLEPROOF, MELBOURNE<br />
29 SEPTEMBER 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: ( inaudible) [ BOP]<br />
PM: It is a good figure for the month, it shows that imports are down by 11 per cent so<br />
all the Jereniiahs who were saying a month ago that jmports are rising inexorably<br />
again even as we were coming into recovery, all this proves again is that you can't<br />
put that much store in one month's numbers. And at $ 903 million the , alancc of-<br />
Payments figure for the month is in line with the Budget forecast, which is being<br />
for an improvement over the recent period. A seasonably adjusted figure of 903<br />
million is 39 per cent below a month ago.<br />
J: You can't see any trends emerging then?<br />
PM: Well I think it mcans that those so called trend setters, people who want to chart<br />
us, people who want to draw these things out and graphically illustrate them and<br />
then point a finger of gloom, will have to be les gloomy today.<br />
J Does it raise the potential for interest rate cuts?<br />
PM: No implications for interest cuts.<br />
J: Mr Keating, on industry policy, in your coming here today this is a big<br />
achievement, the sense of a ncw facility, but some months ago we were all out at<br />
Wills and we saw the devastation of TCF industries out there and while your </p>
<p>political opponents are talking greater doom then you are, you bear a lot of<br />
responsibility don't you for pursuing the tariffs d * own to a level where many<br />
thousands of jobs have gone in TCF industries?<br />
PM: If you ask mc to I bear responsibility for creating new industries like this one, thc<br />
answer is yes I do. And it is these Industries which will give people long term<br />
employment, it is these industries which can stand..<br />
J: What do you say to thosc employees who have. lost their jobs, when their<br />
cmployers have gonc off shore because of that?<br />
PM: Well only some. But it proves this point that clothing, textile and footwear in<br />
efficient sectors does have a future as we are seeing in this plant, as we are seeing<br />
in other fibre based industries across the country. And also in the primary areas<br />
like wool where we arc now moving into tops production which will add value<br />
again. So in the whole sector, that is from woollen tops, cotton, spinning which<br />
some from inefficicnt companies that have had no investment for a long time. I<br />
K. mean this plant proves the point.<br />
1: the whole tariff debate.<br />
PM: Well I think it is drawing a long bow on Sir Arvi's part to sy to the car industries,<br />
please face extinction, gladly. That is don't mention it, don't compla7in about it. I<br />
think it is not fair to say that it is politising the debate for a car company about to<br />
invest $ 800 million in Australia, to say they can't survive at zero protection. I am<br />
quite sure that any investments Sir Arvi would be associated with, he wouldn't like<br />
to have it threatened and then have someone say, once you complain about that Sir<br />
Arvi you are politicising. I mean the fact is industries have got a right to speak and<br />
particularly world conmpetitive ones developing world competitive plants in<br />
Australia. So the time for jockeying on cars was in 1988 and 1991 when the plans<br />
were put together. What you are hearing now is basically the genuine views of car<br />
companies that can't survive, they believe, at zero tariffs with a relatively small<br />
Australian economy.<br />
J: Mr Keating there is going to bc an election on Saturday in Victoria..<br />
PM: inaudible<br />
J. inaudible<br />
PM: the answer is produce more products, run the economy at a greater level of GDP<br />
and there's only one way of doing that without inflation spilling over, that's with<br />
an incomes policy the thing the Liberal Party doesn't want. T7hat is an agreement<br />
with the trade unions about where national incomes goes, so if you want to run<br />
Australia at a speed fast enough to-create the employment to take most people up,<br />
ccrtainly people who have been unemployed from industries such as the TCF </p>
<p>industry or others then you've got to run the economy to speed, that can't happen<br />
without an Accord and you can only havc an Acco-rd in some structured cooperation<br />
which of course, Dr Hewson rejects absolutdfy. So his model is a model<br />
for low growth, high unemployment which has been made clear today in fact by a<br />
survey of economists published on the front page of the Melbourne Age.<br />
J: Mr Keating, let me ask you about the election on Saturday. As you know the<br />
Labor Party is not looking..<br />
PM: I've done all these before at Williamstown.<br />
J. No, hut I wasn't at Williamstown, rd like to ask you a question about the election<br />
if I may.<br />
PM: Where are you from?<br />
J: The Agc, my nanmc is Pctcr Ell ingsen. Mr Keating, the whoic financial<br />
mismanagement allegations made about the Labor Party in Victoria are being<br />
rebutted by the Labor Party state politicians and their citing the Tricontential<br />
Royal Comnmission as evidence of their varacity in that. Mrs Kirner is talking<br />
about thec c ulture of the ' 80s as the culpable culprit in this whole problem that<br />
Victoria has had and one key fulcrum in that culture surely was the deregulation<br />
which you pursued as Treasurer.<br />
PM; Let's not draw that..<br />
1: But didn't you crcate a culture which is now come home to roost in Victoria?<br />
PM: What are we into from the Age, Prc-Copemnican obscurantism? Is that what we're<br />
about..<br />
J: I'm reflecting the view of some of your colleagues.<br />
PM: warm hcarted lcfty into obscurantist views. The fact is if you can't have frec<br />
flow of money in this economy, don't blame the problems of Trico management<br />
onto the deregulation of the Australian economy, it is absurd and the only place<br />
that question would be asked today is in a newspaper which still has lingering<br />
good will to the dark cave dweller age of the 1960s and<br />
ends </p>
