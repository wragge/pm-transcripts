    <content><![CDATA[<p>Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott warmly welcome the entry into force on 15 January 2015 of the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement (JAEPA).</p>
<p>JAEPA represents an historic development in economic relations between Japan and Australia and is the most significant bilateral economic agreement since the 1957 Agreement on Commerce.</p>
<p>JAEPA lays the foundation for the next phase of bilateral economic relations, and will strengthen “the special strategic partnership” between Japan and Australia.</p>
<p>JAEPA will deliver significant economic benefits to both countries, through increased trade in high-quality goods and services, an easing of bilateral investment restrictions and promoting economic growth.</p>
<p>The Prime Ministers look forward to Australian and Japanese businesses working together to make the most of the opportunities provided by JAEPA.</p>
