JQU S RALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE AT RAAF FAIRBAIRN 15 APRIL 1986<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, why didn't you pledge support for Mr<br />
Reagan's action in Parliament?<br />
PM: My statement was a statement which was relevant to the<br />
circumstances. We were not advised in advance, asked in advance<br />
for support. The statement was carefully calculated to convey the<br />
position of the Australian Government and that is that we want<br />
hostilities to cease. In a discussion that the Foreign Minister<br />
and I have had and the information to which we had privy earlier,<br />
we tried to convey our understanding of the circumstances which<br />
had motivated the United States to take this action. And I have<br />
tried to convey to the people of Australia the concern that we<br />
have about terrorism. Not just in which Libya is involved but<br />
which they are directing. And it is quite clear that these<br />
circumstances of conflict are not going to be eradicated until<br />
Libya desists from directing such terrorists. Now, as I say, the<br />
Foreign minister and I have had access to information which we<br />
find compelling as to the fact that Libya had been involved in<br />
the direction of such terrorists. Now we, having said that, want<br />
the hostilities to cease because there is not merely the danger<br />
to innocent people in Libya but there is also the present danger<br />
of the escalation of this conflict.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you support the President's action?<br />
PM: Well, what my statement says, it means. And that is that we<br />
want the action to cease. I have tried to convey our<br />
understanding of the circumstances which has led the United<br />
States Administration to do this. Let me make it clear, I am not<br />
going to get into some squalid auction with the Leader of the<br />
Opposition about the degree of our support for the relationship<br />
with the United States and of our loathing and condemnation of<br />
terrorism. It serves no ones purposes in Australia or elsewhere<br />
to get into to such a squalid auction. It is a careful,<br />
calculated statement to convey the position which has been<br />
considered by the Foreign minister and myself.<br />
JOURNALIST: Shouldn't Australia have been notified in advance of<br />
this action by the Americans?<br />
PM: I am not here to say that we should have been notified in<br />
advance. we were informed at about 9.30 this morning when clearly<br />
the action was underway. T -1-11 </p>
<p>.1 2<br />
JOURNALIST: So when you get to Washington do you expect the<br />
President to ask for your support?<br />
PM: I don't know. You would have to ask the President what he is<br />
going to do. All I can say is I will convey to the President the<br />
sentiments that are in my statement. One thing I will certainly<br />
be conveying to the President is that I would believe it vitally<br />
important that the United States should expose the information of<br />
which they are in possession and upon which they have based their<br />
action. Now I understand because I have discussed this matter<br />
with Secretary of Defense, Mr Weinberger, the inhibitions which I<br />
think all of you can understand in terms of the way in which they<br />
acquired this information. But I do really believe that it is in<br />
the interests of everybody concerned that that informatin should<br />
be made public.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think the Americans would prefer a statement<br />
of greater support?<br />
PM: Well, all I can say is that where earlier this year when the<br />
question of the United States action and attempt to get support<br />
from other countries was concerned they expressed their<br />
satisfaction to the reaction that we undertook as a Government.<br />
And I have no reason to believe that they will be wanting or<br />
pressing or seeking to press us into some further position. We<br />
have tried, as I say, to make a valid statement in this matter<br />
and I repeat that I believe it would be in everyones interest if<br />
the actual information which the United States has in regard to<br />
Libyan direction of terrorist activity were made public.<br />
