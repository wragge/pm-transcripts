SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
MR. E. G. WHITLAM<br />
AT THE OPENING OF A NATIONAL SEMINAR ON ABORIGINAL ARTS AUSTRALIAN<br />
NATIONAL UNIVERSITY<br />
21 MAY 1973<br />
ABORIGINAL ARTS<br />
There could be no more appropriate meeting place for this<br />
seminar than the Coombs Lecture Theatre of this university. I do not<br />
need to tell you of the dedicated and untiring service Dr. Coombs has<br />
given to both the arts and the Aboriginal people of this country.<br />
This seminar brings together two o~ f the great causes to which he has<br />
devoted much of his distinguished career as an Australian public<br />
servant. I pay tribute to his energy, his zeal and his humanity.<br />
There can be no qualification about my Government's<br />
commitment to the cause of the Aboriginal people. We are determined<br />
that the long record of injustice, repression, neglect, the record<br />
that has marked our treatment of the Aboriginal people for two<br />
centuries of white civilisation on this continent, will be brought<br />
to an end. Let there be no mistaking our sincerity. Above ally let<br />
there be no mistaking our motives. Our commitment to the Aboriginal<br />
people is no token gesture to modish theories, no easy device to<br />
improve the " image" of white Australia overseas, no comfortable sop<br />
to world opinion. We regard the Aboriginals' rights and dignity as<br />
more important than the white mants reputation. I repeat what I said<br />
in my policy speech last Nov-ember: " The Aborigines are a responsibility<br />
we cannot escape, cannot share, cannot shuffle off." In 1967 the<br />
Australian people, by an overw~ 1elming majority at a referendum,<br />
gave the national Government an overriding responsibility for the<br />
welfare of the Aboriginal people. Nothing was done to implement<br />
that responsibility in any way that would not have been possible<br />
before that referendum was passed. We will accept that responsibility;<br />
we regard it as a sacred trust.<br />
The Labor Government has many plans and many ambitions for<br />
the Australian people. But if there is one ambition-we place above all<br />
others, if there is one achievement for which I hope we will be remembered,<br />
if there is one cause for which I hope future historians will salute<br />
us, it is this: That the Government I lead removed a stain from our<br />
national honour and gave justice and equality to the Aboriginal people.<br />
My Government intends to restore to the Aboriginal people<br />
of Australia the power to make their own decisions about their way of<br />
life within the Australian community. We know that most Aboriginal<br />
Australians are proud of their heritage, of their long history and<br />
of the traditions and culture which have been handed down to them.<br />
We know that most of them, in all parts of Australia, want to preserve<br />
their identity as distinctive groups within an Australian society which<br />
respe-cts and honours that identity. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Accordingly we see this seminar as an important expression<br />
of the Government's intention. It has been arranged by the newlyestablished<br />
Board for Aboriginal Arts within the Australian Council<br />
for the Arts. This Board is composed exclusively of Aborigines and<br />
is presided over by your chairman, Mr. Dick Roughsey. That board has<br />
decided who was to be invited to participate in the seminar. That board<br />
will determine the conduct of the seminarts proceedings. I am glad to<br />
see that the majority of those present are themselves Aborigines and<br />
that those who are not, are men and women of goodwill whose knowledge<br />
and experience will be of value in your deliberations0 Important among<br />
these are distinguished repres-entatives of ethnic groups from New<br />
Zealand, the United State-s and Africa, to whom I extend a special welcome.<br />
We expect that the work of the seminar will guide the Aboriginal.<br />
Arts Board in tbe policies it will develop. My Government intends that<br />
the Board will receive greatly increased financial resources so that it<br />
can do its work effectively.<br />
The Board will be concerned to support and stimulate the<br />
traditional arts of the Aboriginal people. Gradually, white Australians<br />
have become aware of the richness'-and diversity of these arts of the<br />
bark paintings, the rock carvings and paintings, of the mimey the dancing<br />
and the music of the dramatic presentation of traditional myths and<br />
stories, of the great song cycles which celebrate the -adventures of<br />
totemic ancestors in the dream-time. What has tended to be forgotten<br />
is that these examples of the cultural heritage of the Aboriginal<br />
people have their source in, and derive their inspiration from, the<br />
deeply spiritual ceremonial which is of the essence of the Aboriginal<br />
way. I hope your seminar will explore this relationship so that the<br />
Boardts support may be given in ways which respect and enrich the<br />
ceremonial foundations as well as the works of the artists which spring<br />
from it. It has been fashionable to regard Aboriginal arts as a<br />
rigidly unchanging repetition of forms laid down in times immemorial.<br />
I believe this is a mistake. There is ample evidence of the influence<br />
of change in subject matter, in materials, in style and purpose0<br />
Truly it is an ordered change within a stable but developing tradition.<br />
I do not think we should regard Aboriginal arts as a museum piece, but<br />
rather as a vigorous, expression of the vitality of the Aboriginal way,<br />
changing as it will from the effects of outside influences and from its<br />
own internal vitality. Authenticity depends upon the arts still being<br />
rooted in2 and enlivened by, the true spirit of the Aborigipal people<br />
rather than by adherence to unchanging forms.<br />
There are many Aboriginal Australians whose links with the<br />
traditions of their ancestors have been broken or become tenuous. Many<br />
live in tow ns and cities, facing the problems of isolation, of prejudice,<br />
and a multitude of social and economic handicaps. For them, the arts<br />
will take much from white society, and from other racial groups in style<br />
and technique. They will be seen in part as a means whereby urban<br />
Aborigines are frequently an expression of protest and that they learn<br />
much from protest in s'imilar forms from minorities the world over. Such </p>
<p>-3-<br />
social protest is a proper purpose of the arts and I hope that the<br />
Aboriginal Arts Board will strengthen the capacity of urban communities<br />
to make their voices heard. Artists are not only those who see and<br />
feel most intensely the agonies, the sorrows and the hopes of their own<br />
people: They are those who can bring to others the willingness and<br />
capacity to comprehend and share these emotions. I have been struck<br />
by the distinctively Aboriginal style which is emerging in the writing,<br />
the theatre, the visual arts of urban Aboriginal artists. I hope this<br />
style will be brought to full flower in the coming years.<br />
Mr. Roughsey, you and your fellows here in this seminar have<br />
before you an exciting task and as historic opportunity. I wish Syou<br />
well in your deliberations. I pledge the support of the Australian<br />
Government for the plans which I am sure will emerge from them.<br />
I have much pleasure in declaring open this National Seminar<br />
on Aboriginal Arts. 0 0 0 @ e.. aee a </p>
