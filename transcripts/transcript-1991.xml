STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER FOR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT<br />
( Hon. David Fairbairn, M. P.)<br />
AUSTRALIAN PLANS FOR CAPE IREAUDREN FEASIBILITY STUDY<br />
SThe Minister for National Development, Mr David<br />
Fairbairn, today gave details of the arrangements made to<br />
ensure Australia's full and effective participation in the<br />
feasibility study. " We have set up an Australian Plowshare Committee<br />
to watch over the study", Mr Fairbairn said.<br />
" A Cape Keraudren Project Technical Committee<br />
has also been established to co-ordinate the investigations<br />
into technical and economic issues.<br />
The Cape Keraudren Project Committee will be the<br />
W working body for the feasibility study, and will maintain the<br />
necessary liaison with the United States Atomic Energy Commission.<br />
SThe Chairman of the Committee will be Dr A. R. W.<br />
Wilson, of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission who is<br />
SDeputy Director of the Commission's Research establishment<br />
at Lucas Heights, near Sydney. He is thoroughly experienced<br />
in the American Plowshare programme, having visited the United<br />
States on a number of occasions to study developments.<br />
In 1963, Dr V'ilson headed a three-man Australian<br />
mission which made a first-hand appreciation of the United<br />
States progress in the scientific, engineering and safety<br />
aspects of the use of nuclear explosives. </p>
<p>He has also acted, at the request of the<br />
International Atomic Energy Agency, as adviser to the<br />
Government of Panama on the safety aspects of the proposed<br />
" Trans-Isthmian Canal Project".<br />
In this, the use of nuclear explosives is being<br />
studied, since this technique is estimated to offer economies<br />
of the order of several hundred million dollars over conventional<br />
blasting techniques.<br />
0 The Australian deputy co-ordinator for the Cape<br />
Keraudren Project Committee is Dr R. Warner, of the Australian<br />
Atomic Energy Commission. Dr Warner is a Gold-medallist in the Faculty of<br />
Chemical Engineering, University of New South Wales, and has<br />
been closely associated with Plowshare developments for some<br />
years. The Project Committee will include experts from<br />
a number of Commonwealth Departments and organisations, among<br />
them the Bureau of Mineral Resources and the Bureau of<br />
Meteorology, the Government of Western Australia, and the<br />
Sentinel Mining Company. The Snowy Mountains Authority may<br />
also be associated with the Committee.<br />
Commenting on the decision to proceed with a<br />
feasibility study, Mr Fairbairn said it was very good news.<br />
It could have important implications for development work in<br />
Australia in future years.<br />
" If it proceeds, the construction of a harbour<br />
at Cape Keraudren by nuclear blasting will advance our knowledg e<br />
and skills in this exciting~ new field".<br />
If it proves feasible in all respects the<br />
operation at Cape Keraudren is expected to require five<br />
nuclear explosives each of 200 kilotons fired simultaneously. </p>
<p>It is estimated that this will produce a harbour 6,000 feet<br />
long, 1,300 feet to 1,600 feet wide and 300-400 feet deep.<br />
This could accommodate ships of up to approximately 150,000<br />
dead-weight tons.<br />
