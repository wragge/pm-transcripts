PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 21 MARCH 1990<br />
The people of Namibia celebrate their attainment of<br />
independence today. On this historic occasion I have sent<br />
the following message of congratulations to President Sam<br />
Nujoma. " Please accept my heartfelt congratulations on the attainment<br />
of the independence of your country. I share your joy and<br />
satisfaction on this truly historic occasion and on behalf of<br />
the people of Australia I wish you and the people of<br />
Namibia peace and prosperity for the future.<br />
Australia has had the welcome opportunity to assist your<br />
country in its transition to freedom and independence through<br />
our humanitarian and educational assistance through the years<br />
and our provision of army personnel, electoral experts and<br />
observers to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group.<br />
I am confident that on this solid foundation the relationship<br />
between our two countries will develop further in the years<br />
to come.<br />
Let me also extend to you a warm welcome on your joining the<br />
Commonwealth. I look forward to fruitful cooperation between<br />
our countries in this important forum, particularly in our<br />
efforts to bring about an early end to the abhorrent system<br />
of apartheid in South Africa.<br />
The thoughts of Australians are with you and the Namibian<br />
people as you celebrate the achievement of your hard-won<br />
~ reedom." </p>
