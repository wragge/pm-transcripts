STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON 1' J KEATING, MP<br />
ACCESS TO TAX FILES<br />
The Government's decision to maintain the confidentiality of<br />
taxpayers' files despite a request from the West Australian<br />
Commission _ intoCommercial Activities of Government<br />
wasbaed en-ti-relyi on--dice from the Australian Taxation<br />
office. The principal solicitor assisting the commission asked me in<br />
a letter dated April 15, 1991, for an amendment to the<br />
income Tax Assessment Act to enable the commission to<br />
investigate taxpayers' files.<br />
As Treasurer, I sought advice from the Australian Taxation<br />
Office. The Commissioner's reply was received in my office<br />
on May 3, 1991 and is attached to this statement.<br />
Mr Boucher advised that a similar request for access from<br />
the Gyles Royal Commission in New South Wal -es had been<br />
denied some months arlier_, anrferdt hismiueo<br />
that subject.<br />
He was also of the view that the WA commission should be<br />
denied access to income-tax information.-<br />
He wrote that, for reasons of good tax administration, he<br />
was strongly of the view that the current level of secrecy<br />
of income tax information should not be disturbed.<br />
" The decision by the Government to allow the Fitzgerald<br />
inquiry access to income tax information in 1987 was taken<br />
to meet a special need of the time. I would be most<br />
concerned if that decision is seen as a precedent to allow<br />
access for all future State Royal Commissions," he wrote.<br />
This " special need" resulted from the fact that the<br />
Fitzgerald Inquiry preceded legislative measures to allow<br />
State police commissioners to seek tax information from the<br />
Taxation Commissioner within the framework of existing law.<br />
The Commissioner conellided with his recommendation, " that<br />
the Government not support the WA Commission's request for<br />
access to income tax information." T1EL3: . May. 92 18: 43 No. 022 P. 01/ 04 </p>

Mr Boucher's advice and irecommuendation were accepted, anld I<br />
signed a letter, dated May 21 and embodying his advice, to<br />
the Royal Commission.<br />
I stressed in that letter that there was a capacity for law<br />
enforcement officers to obtain tax information pertaining to<br />
specific cases.<br />
Any suggestion that there was a party political motivation<br />
in my decision is ludicrous.<br />
I not only accept but I support Mr Boucher's recommendation<br />
because the Income Tax Assessment Act states that tax files<br />
should remain confidential.<br />
The oflus is on those who want access to them to establish<br />
why they should have it, not on the Treasurer or the<br />
Taxation Office to establish why they should not.<br />
Finally, I refuse to accept Mr Templeman's excuse that any<br />
inadequacy or failings of the Commission process are a<br />
result of the view of the Tax Commissioner. I find that<br />
implication both offensive and self-serving.<br />
As I have made clear, If the Commission believes there are<br />
outstanding matters which would be assisted by the<br />
availability of more tax information there is a mechanism<br />
available for these issues to be raised with the Australian<br />
Tax Office.<br />
Indeed, if any authorised law enforcement agency were to<br />
seek tax information to assist them in any investigations or<br />
prosecutions prompted by the report of the R~ oyal Commission<br />
then the Tax Commissioner is empowered to provide such<br />
relevant information under the amendments to the secrecy<br />
provisions of tax law made after the Fitzgerald Royal<br />
Commission. CANBERRA<br />

0\ Access to income tax information by the WA Royal Comm nto<br />
Commercial Activities of Government 6<br />
You have received a request from the West Australian Royal Commission into<br />
Commercial Activities of Government ( the WA Commission) that they be<br />
allowed access to income tax information ( copy attached). The WA Commission<br />
would like access alone similar lines to the access given to the Fitzgerald Royal<br />
Commission in 1987. A similar request for access for the Gyles Royal<br />
Commission of New South Wales was recently rejected by the Government ( our<br />
minute No. 177 of 19 December 1990 refers relevant papers also attached).<br />
2. I am also of the view that the WA Commission should be denied access to<br />
income tax information. For reasons of good tax administration, I am still<br />
strongly of the view that the current level of secrecy of income tax information<br />
should not be disturbed.<br />
3. As I said in my minute of 19 December, the continued confidentiality of<br />
income tax information is important to the gathering of such information from<br />
taxpayers and other persons. Those people are, I believe, more likely to disclose<br />
information voluntarily where they can be confident that the use of the<br />
information, other than for tax purposes, is limited.<br />
4. The omnibus provisions for Royal Commissions are longstanding ones<br />
limited to those Commissions established by the Commonwealth, and our<br />
consistent position has been to advise against any widening of them. The<br />
decision by the Government to allow the Fitzgerald Inquiry access to income tax<br />
information in 1987 was taken to meet a special need of the time. I would be<br />
most concerned if that decision is seen as a precedent to allow access for all<br />
future State Royal Commissions. It is our experience that once a Royal<br />
Commissioner makes the claim that he needs information for purposes of his<br />
enquiry, we cannot look behind the request even though it is of a wide ranging<br />
( even " fishing") nature.<br />
I should also point out that we already help certain State ( and other) law<br />
enforcement agencies, within the framework of the existing law, wherever<br />
possible. For example, income tax information may be communicated to State<br />
Police Commissioners in certain circumstances, either on my own initiative or in<br />
response to a request by an authorised law enforcement officer. In the latter<br />
case, the request could be made in the context of an investigation subsequent to<br />
the completion of a Royal Commission, provided the information sought relates<br />
to a particular offence by a specified person " fishing" exercises . l. e not<br />
permitted. INF1 J EtA L </p>

Recommendation 6. It is recommended that the Government not support the WA<br />
Commission's request for access to income tax information. A draft reply to the<br />
Commission is attached for your signature, if you approve of the<br />
recommendation. Boucher)<br />
