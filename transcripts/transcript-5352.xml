FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 16 MAY, 1980<br />
EXCERPT FROM PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS TO<br />
AUSTRALIAN LIBERAL STUDENTS' FEDERATION, HOBART<br />
The package of offshore legislation which was introduced<br />
into the Federal Parliament this Session is designed to<br />
give the States a significant influence in the<br />
territorial seas.<br />
It is important that States should be able to influence<br />
strongly policy in what happens offshore. It is not a<br />
matter that should be determined solely from Canberra.<br />
It is especially important for an island State like Tasmania,<br />
where the fishing industry is a vital part of the economy.<br />
The legislative package was opposed by the ALP which wants<br />
total Commonwealth dominance over the States.<br />
Nevertheless, it has the support of all States including<br />
Tasmania and New South Wales, both of which have Labor<br />
Governments. They took part in the painstaking negotiations extending<br />
over two years, which have resolved some ten years of<br />
concern over constitutional rights and arrangements aroused<br />
by the territorial seas controversy.<br />
The legislative package is a classic example of the way<br />
in which constitutional problems should be resolved.<br />
The three Tasmanian Members of the Federal Parliament,<br />
Senators Grimes, O'Eyrne, and Wriedt belong to a Party<br />
which is committed to opposing the passage of this legislation<br />
through the Senate, as it was opposed, very strongly, in<br />
the House.<br />
If Senators Grimes, O'Byrne and Wriedt are concerned for<br />
the interests of their own State of Tasmania, they will support<br />
this legislation. For them to join in the attack by the<br />
Parliamentary Labor Party on the offshore legislation would<br />
be a betrayal of Tasmania. / 2 /-31 </p>
<p>2<br />
The legislation gives them the chance to support<br />
Tasmania's rights and the rights of the States.<br />
From 1973 to 1975 the then Labor Government sought to<br />
dominate the States through behaviour which undermined<br />
the economies of the States and the decision-making<br />
capacity of their Governments.<br />
That Government sought to establish total control over<br />
the nation's resources, including the seas, with their<br />
fisheries and'their offshore minerals.<br />
Indeed, the Federal Labor Party seeks to establish branches<br />
of Commonwealth Departments to do these things.<br />
However, Senators Grimes, O'Byrne and Wriedt now have<br />
the opportunity to turn their back on this principle<br />
of centralised control and to support their own State<br />
and its interests in the seas around Tasmania.<br />
