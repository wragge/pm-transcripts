PUBLIC SERVICE TRANSFERS TO CANBERRA<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, announced today that the<br />
Commonwealth Government intended transferring approximately<br />
500 Public Service and Defence Service positions from Melbourne<br />
to Canberra in 1978/ 79, and transferring further contingents<br />
total~ ling about 500 positions in the two subsequent years.<br />
In adaition, the Government has approved the pennanent location<br />
in Canberra of the Human Rights-Commission, the Commonwealth<br />
Legal Aid Commission, and the Institute of Criminology, which<br />
together would have an establishment of over 100 positions.<br />
The units to be transferred from Melbourne in 1978/ 79 are:<br />
Department of Defence 195 positions<br />
Department of Transport 164 positions<br />
Department of Employment and 50 positions<br />
Industrial Relations<br />
Department of Construction 75 positions<br />
Further staff of the Departments of Construction and Transport<br />
will be transferred to Canberra during 1979/ 80 and the remainder<br />
of the Department of Construction transfers will be effected during<br />
1980/ 81.<br />
" These transfers will continue the process of consolidation in Canber<br />
of policy advising and related support Central Office staff of<br />
Commonwealth departments which I referred to in December last J'ear<br />
when announcing the 1977/ 78 transfer programme.<br />
The Government believes that the efficiency of its administration<br />
and the standard aind responsiveness of advice its receives, will<br />
be enhanced by these moves. It is essential for the Ministry<br />
to have ready access and effective communication with its policy<br />
advisers",, Mr Fraser said.<br />
The Prime minister also noted that the transfer would assist the<br />
Government's aim of restraining government expenditure by producing<br />
long term savings in communication and travel costs. / 2 </p>
<p>" Thie transfer decisions have not been taken lightly", the<br />
Prime Minister said. " The Government is very conscious of<br />
the impact such decisions have on the affected officers and their<br />
families. In accord with past practice, it it intended that<br />
conditions of employment, timing and other aspects of<br />
impleentation of the transfers will be the subject of consultation<br />
between departmental management and the Peak Councils within<br />
the framework of the Canberra Relocation Coordinating Committee<br />
chaired by the Public Service Board. As-in the past, those<br />
public. servants whose positions are subject to complusory<br />
transfer will receive at least twelve months notice of this".<br />
He added that consultations on the Government's intentions had<br />
been sought with Peak Councils on a confidential basis prior to the<br />
announcement of final Government decisions. The Peak Councils had,<br />
however, declined to enter into such consultations on this basis.<br />
However, full opportunity would still be available to the Peak Councils<br />
to consult on implementation of the transfers as indicated above.<br />
The Prime Minister noted that the transfers would have a major<br />
beneficial effect on the service industries in Canberra.<br />
Canberra's role as the National Capital would be strengthened<br />
by these decisions. </p>
