EMBARGO:<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY, 15 MARCH 1982<br />
" THIS WEEK IN CANBERRA" BTV6<br />
The Premier of Victoria, Lindsay Thompson, last week outlined<br />
his policies for the next three years of Liberal Government<br />
in this State. He was able to present an impressive record<br />
of Liberal achievement in Victoria, and his policies for this<br />
election are the right ones for the l980s.<br />
For decades Victoria has been a great productive centre for<br />
the whole of Australia. Despite its comparative smallness,<br />
Victoria produces about a quarter of the total value of<br />
Australia's agricultural output, and one third of Australia's<br />
manufacturing employment is in Victoria. Victoria has long<br />
been developing its great resources, especially brown coal<br />
and oil, and other states are now following the paths of<br />
progress which are often taken for granted in Victoria.<br />
Over the last three decades, living standards in this country<br />
and in this St'ate have virtually doubled and Victorians now<br />
enjoy the highest average household income of any state, and<br />
the highest rate of home ownership of any state.<br />
Lindsay Thom: pson's policy package is economically responsible<br />
and it is addressed to people's real hopes and concerns.<br />
It is a policy aimed towards continued economic growth, which<br />
is the basis of future improvements in living standards. It<br />
will provide great help to many people in achieving homie<br />
ownership, and it will maintain the Victorian Government's<br />
firm stance on industrial relations. It will address real needs<br />
in education and in training for jobs, and will continue to<br />
build up tourism in Victoria. It will maintain high health<br />
care standards in Victoria and it will provide further practical<br />
help for the aged..-.-<br />
State Governments are immensely important. Their * influence on<br />
people's lifestyles and prosperity is direct and immediate.<br />
The Labor Party is committed to a number of policies which are<br />
out of touch with the needs and wants of people today. Labor<br />
has said they would repeal some vital industrial relations<br />
legislation. They have said they would ii ose probate duty; they have said<br />
they would abolish poer capita grants to non-Goverrnent schools<br />
and require such s'chools to accen~ t new Government requirements<br />
as a condition of receiving any State aid. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Policies such as these would turn back the clock. They<br />
illustrate how wrong any socialist objective is for this<br />
State and this nation.<br />
What Victoria needs is the kind of policies which the Premier<br />
put forward last week. Policies which will encourage opportunity<br />
and freedom of choice, and which will enable production and<br />
economic growth to go ahead. oOo---</p>
