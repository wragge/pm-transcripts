    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE............ </p>
<p> JOURNALIST: </p>
<p>Prime Minister, how do you rate your meeting with President Clinton</p>
<p> today?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh it was very good because I was able to tell him very directly in</p>
<p> a private discussion and then more briefly in the working lunch how</p>
<p> disappointed Australia was about the lamb decision. I told him that</p>
<p> of all the recent trade issues, this had caused more upset and concern</p>
<p> in Australia than any other. That although we feared about outcome,</p>
<p> we were particularly upset about the imposition of the tariff on the</p>
<p> in quota portion. I said that we would pursue all of our remedies</p>
<p> at the World Trade Organisation. That we would provide compensation</p>
<p> for our lamb producers and that we wanted American understanding and</p>
<p> cooperation in the transition to the imposition of the tariff particularly</p>
<p> in relation to lamb that was contracted for sale before the announcement</p>
<p> was made that will be landed in the United States after the new tariff</p>
<p> comes in and he agreed that our officials could work together to sort</p>
<p> that out.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Now, when this news first broke you put out a very strong statement,</p>
<p> spoke very strongly, using words like appalling, unjust, hypocritical.</p>
<p> How strongly did you convey those feelings, the feelings of Australian</p>
<p> lamb producers in today's meeting?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't think I could have put it any more firmly than I did</p>
<p> today both in the private discussion and in the working lunch. I mean,</p>
<p> they were left in no doubt that this had upset us more than any other</p>
<p> trade decision in recent memory. And that's what I said publicly and</p>
<p> that's what I said privately.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did you make the point that it undercuts, undermines the US's position</p>
<p> internationally as a free trader and anything it has to say in the</p>
<p> upcoming APEC and WTO round on free trade?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. I said that this would be seized upon by others who were less</p>
<p> committed to open trade. I should say that in a sense his response</p>
<p> to that was, well I am very committed to a successful world trade</p>
<p> round. He is coming to the APEC in New Zealand, he has told me that.</p>
<p> He agreed with me that we should work together to secure a Leaders'</p>
<p> Declaration in relation to the World Trade Organisation in favour</p>
<p> of a very comprehensive new world trade round. So that was his response.</p>
<p> As I indicated at the news comment I made after the meeting it's outcomes</p>
<p> that matter, not fine words. I don't mean that critically of the President</p>
<p> it's just an important observation to make.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well, just on that rule of thumb, outcomes versus rhetoric. I mean,</p>
<p> you'd have to say the signals recently from the US with this lamb</p>
<p> decision where we have a real outcome are not positive?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, no. I mean, of course. And that was the reason why the meeting</p>
<p> was, in a sense, it wasn't dominated by the lamb issue but it was</p>
<p> certainly the first issue I raised. In a sense, the meeting started</p>
<p> on lamb and it finished on lamb.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You said that in the phone conversation with the President recently</p>
<p> he had indicated to you his concern about increasing tide of protectionism</p>
<p> in his country, the USA. Was there any of that sentiment expressed</p>
<p> in this meeting today?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there was some. We didn't dwell on that. I think both of us</p>
<p> recognise that trade protectionism is a latent but nonetheless powerful</p>
<p> element in both our societies.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I suppose what I am getting at, did he show any sign of regret or</p>
<p> apology privately?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he understood why we were upset and he didn't seek to say that</p>
<p> I was exaggerating it or he didn't seek to suggest that we had no</p>
<p> grounds to be upset. I mean, he has taken a political decision, he's</p>
<p> taken into account domestic political circumstances and he has decided</p>
<p> to wear the international criticism. Now, that's his judgement as</p>
<p> a political leader in his country. I don't agree with it and I am</p>
<p> expressing a view on behalf of Australia and Australians. But in the</p>
<p> end, we can't reverse the decision it is now American law. And there</p>
<p> is nothing we can do about it, there never was. Once the decision</p>
<p> was made that was it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>He said today in some comments on the record that he didn't expect</p>
<p> this trade decision to sour the relationship with Australia. But it</p>
<p> must have some impact generally and presumably over the atmospherics</p>
<p> of today's meeting?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it won't contaminate the rest of the relationship. I have made</p>
<p> that clear all along and it shouldn't because it means more than what</p>
<p> happens on one particular issue. But it has caused a lot of anger</p>
<p> in Australia and he was left in no doubt about that, that it has caused</p>
<p> a lot of anger. I don't know how many more times or different ways</p>
<p> I can say that this has caused more anger than any American trade</p>
<p> decision in living memory. Now, I can't put it any more strongly.</p>
<p> That actually means a lot more than more flamboyant words because</p>
<p> that really does accurately measure the concern that Australians feel.</p>
<p> But there are other dimensions to the relationship and it never makes</p>
<p> any sense to spread it, to contaminate the whole of the relationship</p>
<p> because of a very bad decision in one area.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On another issue, any commitment from the United States today to assist</p>
<p> with lobbying for the release of Pratt and Wallace?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I raised that again. I raised it last night with Madeleine Albright.</p>
<p> We had quite a long talk about their position. I raised it again with</p>
<p> the President over the working lunch and he and the Secretary of State</p>
<p> said they would continue to do what they could to secure the release</p>
<p> of the two aid workers.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I had a brief word with Madeleine Albright too last night about this</p>
<p> and she said she'd raised it with EU foreign ministers just last week</p>
<p> but she also seemed to be bereft of any, well as she was owning up</p>
<p> to, any real strategies to be able to move this on much. Did you get</p>
<p> any sense from the President that the US had any real push here or</p>
<p> real capacity to do much here?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Fran, the strategy lies in finding a way to persuade Slobodan</p>
<p> Milosevic to exercise his executive power and let them out. Now, there</p>
<p> is no one fixed way you achieve that and it's very hard for the Secretary</p>
<p> of State or the President to say well this is exactly how we intend</p>
<p> to do it. I mean, bear in mind that it was only a few weeks ago that</p>
<p> the United States was bombing Yugoslavia. So it's a delicate situation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Just on that, given that it was only a few weeks ago the US was involved</p>
<p> in the bombing, are they in a better position post the cease fire</p>
<p> to have some influence here because they have some control presumably</p>
<p> over monies or some influence over monies that go into the reconstruction,</p>
<p> or are they so out of favour that a word from them is going to be</p>
<p> a hindrance not a help?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't think a word from anybody is a hindrance. I think the</p>
<p> more pressure you apply, the more people who speak up for you the</p>
<p> better chance you have. My judgement would be that now the bombing</p>
<p> has stopped it's better.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You also raised East Timor and Indonesia during these talks. Will</p>
<p> the US, or did you ask the US to come in with Australia to put increased</p>
<p> pressure on the Indonesian Government to try and make sure the militia</p>
<p> violence that is going on in East Timor stops?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we have been doing that all along. And everybody I talk to I</p>
<p> make the point that it's important that the Indonesian Government</p>
<p> be encouraged to ensure that you have benign, not intimidatory conditions</p>
<p> in East Timor so that we get a clean ballot and one that allows a</p>
<p> free and open choice.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And so did the US say they would come in on this?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the US has been doing it and the US will continue to do it.</p>
<p> And I know for a fact that senior people in the administration in</p>
<p> the last week have been putting their views very strongly to the Indonesian</p>
<p> Government on this issue.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I understand the US was also interested in your perspective as Prime</p>
<p> Minister of Australia on the situation in Indonesia generally. How</p>
<p> much of the discussion was taken up with Indonesia and their political</p>
<p> cycle and their economic cycle?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, a very large part of it. I think it's fair to say that we spent</p>
<p> more time talking about Indonesia than just about any other issue</p>
<p> except.I mean, lamb very closely rivalled it but that was really the</p>
<p> main issue of our private discussion. But in the plenary session we</p>
<p> talked a great deal about Indonesia and the Americans are interested</p>
<p> in our perspective. I think what the Indonesians have done in embracing</p>
<p> democracy is an historic shift and the Indonesian Government and Dr</p>
<p> Habibie deserve a bit more credit and understanding for that than</p>
<p> what they are getting.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, obviously this meeting with President Clinton is the</p>
<p> highlight, certainly of the US leg of this trip yet one-on-one you</p>
<p> have 20 minutes alone with the President. How much can be done and</p>
<p> achieved in a short time like that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, I think that's a completely wrong way to describe the encounter.</p>
<p> He and I had a one-on-one meeting of 20 minutes but then we had, what,</p>
<p> an hour and a quarter at lunch with his senior people and my senior</p>
<p> people. So for what it's worth you add all of that together and you</p>
<p> are looking at the best part of two hours. I think it is very valuable</p>
<p> given the demands on the time of the President of the United States.</p>
<p> I mean, a lot of encounters between heads of government around the</p>
<p> world don't involve any one-on-one bits without advisers so I don't</p>
<p> think it's in any way accurate or reasonable to categorise it the</p>
<p> way you have.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So you are happy with the value of this part of the trip?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you have a two hour meeting essentially. The best part of the</p>
<p> two hour discussion with the President you are able to express concerns</p>
<p> in a very direct and open and candid fashion because it is a friendly</p>
<p> relationship. You can talk more bluntly to friends than you often</p>
<p> can to acquaintances. We all know that in our own experiences and</p>
<p> that's basically what I was able to do today. I said to him in the</p>
<p> private discussion because our two countries are old friends I can</p>
<p> say to you how upset we are about what you have done on lamb. Now,</p>
<p> I couldn't quite put it that way with some other people. And then</p>
<p> following that we have a plenary session, as I call it, with the,</p>
<p> you have got the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury</p>
<p> and other senior people in his administration, his national security</p>
<p> adviser. And I have got my key people. I don't think you can get better</p>
<p> value. I mean, he can't spend the whole day. I'm seeing his Treasury</p>
<p> Secretary and his drugs czar and so forth, his anti-drugs czar later</p>
<p> today . So I think it has been a very useful gathering.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It was a pretty high powered guest list at last night's barbeque.</p>
<p> Were your flattered by the attendance list?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's appropriate, we are a very close friend of the United States.</p>
<p> We've been a very dependable ally. It was nice to see all of those</p>
<p> people but the Americans owe us a lot. We've stuck by the Americans</p>
<p> over the years through some very difficult situations and we have</p>
<p> a lot of values in common.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST-:</p>
<p>Just one final question, I should ask you about Kakadu. There was</p>
<p> a consensus decision in Paris overnight in favour of not listing Kakadu</p>
<p> on the endangered list. How did Australia get out of jail on that</p>
<p> issue given that at the beginning of this week your Environment Minister's</p>
<p> Office was saying that Australia wasn't expecting to win that decision?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Fran, we were never remotely guilty of an indictable offence. So there</p>
<p> was never any question of us being in jail. We'd done the right thing</p>
<p> and common sense prevailed I am pleased to say. I had concerns because</p>
<p> sometimes in these matters common sense does not prevail. The law</p>
<p> has been very carefully observed in Australia. The environment has</p>
<p> been paid sensitive regard. I am delighted at the outcome. I would</p>
<p> have been angered if it had gone otherwise because we have done the</p>
<p> right thing. And in the end these things should be determined by Australians</p>
<p> according to Australian law.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, thank you.</p>
