FOR PRESS P. M. No. 38/ 1971<br />
GOVER1* ThAE1iT MEETING WITH A. C. T. U.<br />
Statement by-the Prime Minister, TheRgt Honourable W. McMahon, M. P.<br />
The Prime Minister said tonight that a meeting had been held today<br />
between representatives of the Government and the A. C. T. U.<br />
At the meeting Members of the Government were the Prime Minister,<br />
the Treasurer, the Minister for Labour and National Service and the<br />
Attorney-General. The A. C. T. U. was represented by the President,<br />
Mr. Hawke, the Secretary Mr. Souter, and the Honorary Vice-President<br />
Mr. Petrie. Mr. McMahon, opening the discussions said there were three major<br />
issues. He wished to remove two misunderstandings of the Government's<br />
attitude. First to the A. C. T. U. Congress decision of September 1969. The<br />
Congress decision was that " pending the outcome of discussions with the<br />
Commonwealth Government, Unions are advised not to meet any fines imposed<br />
under the Penal Clauses of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Act.... Mr. McMahon said that in the Government's opinion when the long<br />
discussions over dispute settlement procedures successfully concluded in<br />
May 1970 there remained no obstacle imposed on the Unions by the Congress<br />
to the payment of the fines.<br />
The second misunderstanding related to the recent discussions on<br />
11 February between the Governmen't and the A. C. T. U. concerning the state<br />
of the economy. At that meeting the A. C. T. U. representatives said that they<br />
were prepared to enter discussions with representatives of the Government<br />
and employers as to ways in which a wage and price pause could be achieved,<br />
accompanied by a reduction in labour stoppages.<br />
The President of the A. C. T. U. said, however, this was a matter for<br />
consideration by his Executive, but the A. C. T. U. was normally prepared to<br />
enter discussions. It has been inferred by the A. C. T. U. representatives that this implied<br />
that no action would be taken on the fines until these discussions were<br />
completed. In fact the payment of the fines was not discussed at this meeting<br />
and it was never intended that they should be included in any talks arising from<br />
that meeting. / 2 </p>
<p>It is worth recalling that the President of the A. C. T. U. was not in<br />
the position to discuss the fines at that time because the Interstate Executive<br />
meeting with control of the matter was set down for the week commencing<br />
22 February. The second major issue was that in the interests of industrial sanity<br />
in Australia it was essential that the Arbitration Commission should be<br />
effectively maintained.<br />
The Government is deeply concerned with this problem because it<br />
believes the Arbitration System must be preserved i. the interest of the<br />
community and the very large numbers of the work force who depend for the<br />
protection of their minimum wages and conditions of employment on the<br />
Commonwealth Arbitration System. More than UT, of the Australian work<br />
force are covered by Commonwealth and State Arbitration tribunals.<br />
The third major issue is the Government's intention to require payment<br />
of fines and will continue the procedures necessary before those fies can be<br />
collected. The Government accepted that, in order to maintain complete good<br />
faith with the A. C. T. U. it would agree to a special mreeting of the NLAC being<br />
called on or about 15 April to have discussions which were requested at the<br />
meeting of the NLAC on Monday 22 M-arch. Within seven days of the<br />
commencement of the special meeting the A. C. T. U. and employers will have<br />
the right to make further representations to the Government.<br />
Action to enforce collection will be deferred until after the NLAC<br />
meeting on or about 15 April.<br />
