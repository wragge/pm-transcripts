<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard, good morning.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Good morning Neil, nice to talk to you.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  Thanks for your time. Drugs first Prime Minister. Victoria's</p>
<p> going ahead with shooting galleries, you oppose them, very strongly oppose</p>
<p> them, why?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Because I think they send the wrong signal, they give</p>
<p> a degree of acceptability to drug use, which I don't support. There</p>
<p> is no clear evidence from overseas experience that they reduce the drug</p>
<p> problem. They create local difficulties as far as the location of them</p>
<p> are concerned. They have the potential to attract criminal elements to</p>
<p> areas where they do not now go. Overall I think they say to the world</p>
<p> well we've given up trying to persuade people not to start taking</p>
<p> drugs. I think we should be putting more and more resources into rehabilitation.</p>
<p> I'm very strongly of the view that the weakness in the past has been</p>
<p> that all states have not provided enough resources to help people who</p>
<p> want to break the habit get the medical and psychological help that they</p>
<p> need. I don't think injecting rooms do that. I think injecting rooms</p>
<p> convey to the community a view that well it's ok lets not try and</p>
<p> rehabilitate lets just accept.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  What do you think the effect would be if they go ahead</p>
<p> on the community, from the local community, what's the impact?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I think a lot of local communities fear that there will</p>
<p> be criminal elements attracted but it's very hard Neil because we're</p>
<p> dealing here with a new territory in Australia, we haven't had them</p>
<p> before and we're now apparently going to have what four or five in</p>
<p> Victoria, we're going to have one in Sydney, we're going to</p>
<p> have one in the ACT. These rooms are not established directly in breach</p>
<p> of federal law but I should make it plain to the Victorian government</p>
<p> as I have to NSW and ACT governments that they'll get no help of</p>
<p> any kind from the Federal Government and if there's any kind of accommodation</p>
<p> required the federal government to make these work that will not be forthcoming.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  Do you think that the locals- well in Victoria they've</p>
<p> said that the local communities will have the power of veto, if they don't</p>
<p> want them to go ahead they can stop them, do you think they should?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well if they feel strongly enough yes.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  What about the Liberal Party in the state because the</p>
<p> state party could well block it in the upper house?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  That is a matter for them. I hope they use whatever means</p>
<p> are at their disposal to do so but the state parties of the Liberal Party</p>
<p> on these issues are free to make whatever decisions they want. I had some</p>
<p> difference of opinion with the former Victorian Liberal Government about</p>
<p> the drug issue. This is one of these things that does tend to cut across</p>
<p> party political lines. I think you'd probably find that some of the</p>
<p> Labor Premiers in other states, particularly in Queensland, Mr Beattie,</p>
<p> my understanding is that he's not as anxious as Mr Bracks to have</p>
<p> heroin injecting rooms. But in the end they all make their own decisions.</p>
<p> We don't have the power to stop because it's not a direct breach</p>
<p> of federal law but I want to make it very plain that if at any stage there's</p>
<p> any kind of federal accommodation required it will not be forthcoming.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  Do you think though that governments could be getting</p>
<p> themselves into trouble as well? I mean is there an issue here of what</p>
<p> happens of legal protection if people do overdose in these rooms...?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I don't know. This is one of the many problems</p>
<p> that this kind of thing throws up. Presumably the Victorian government</p>
<p> has taken advice on that. Presumably it's decided it's a risk</p>
<p> worth taking. But in the end this will be determined by the Victorian</p>
<p> community, if they feel strongly enough about the issue well they'll</p>
<p> make the government of Victoria accountable, that is how our democratic</p>
<p> system works.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  Do you think it will send a message to the world about</p>
<p> Australia? I mean, or is it just a state issue?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well these things are never entirely state issues but</p>
<p> I mean I'm not... I don't see that as being the main worry.</p>
<p> The main worry is the message it sends to the Australian community. We're</p>
<p> big enough to resolve these things ourselves in Australia, in accordance</p>
<p> with the laws and the practices of Australia and that includes a recognition</p>
<p> of the role of the federal government in certain matters and the role</p>
<p> of the state in others. But in the end what matters is the impact of this</p>
<p> kind of departure on people who are abusing drugs and people who are tempted</p>
<p> to do so. And it has always been my view that anything that sends a signal</p>
<p> of acceptability, of harm minimisation as opposed to a deterrence, abstinence</p>
<p> in the first place and rehabilitation, if people want to get off drugs,</p>
<p> I think is a mistake.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  Do you think it could encourage people into drugs?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I don't think it will discourage them. I understand</p>
<p> the tragedy that drugs visit upon people and there is a sense in this</p>
<p> that, let's just try this and see how it goes. I don't hear</p>
<p> anybody making eloquent, articulate case that on the basis of demonstrated</p>
<p> success around the world this has worked. I mean the results of the World</p>
<p> Health Organisation examinations of this in other parts of the world are</p>
<p> very mixed indeed and in some cases very critical if you read the analysis.</p>
<p> But look it's a decision the Victorian government has taken, it's</p>
<p> got a right to take that decision, I can't stop them doing it but</p>
<p> they won't get any encouragement or help from the federal government.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  Because they seem to save lives, do you think that's</p>
<p> an argument?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I don't think that's been clearly demonstrated</p>
<p> at all.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  We're getting a few calls through on this. I'll</p>
<p> take a couple of those before we move onto some other issues. Hello Brian.</p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>  Yes, how are you? I'm ringing up about the injection</p>
<p> rooms. People...</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  Are you a user Brian?</p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>  Yeah, I am actually.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  Are you an addict?</p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>  Yes.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  Current addict, or reformed?</p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>  Yeah, current.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  Ok.</p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>  Yeah, I mean people [inaudible] saying don't have</p>
<p> 'em, don't have 'em, but like the company, people who are</p>
<p> using and they're using in the streets, they're discarding their</p>
<p> syringes on the ground, like bother what not. And like you've got</p>
<p> the public law about you know all this discarded syringes, there'll</p>
<p> [inaudible]. And then there's sort of an idea of saying well have</p>
<p> safe injection rooms and they're brewing about that. You know how</p>
<p> do you please them?</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  Well would you use a safe injecting room?</p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>  Would I use one?</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  Yes.</p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>  Personally, yes I would.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  Ok, Prime Minister, reaction?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I hear what Brian says, I wonder if he, has he</p>
<p> tried to take advantage of any you know, rehabilitation or abstinence</p>
<p> programmes? Has he sought and so far been unsuccessful?</p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>  Yeah, but that's the whole thing -it's</p>
<p> not no good pumping money into rehabilitation programs and all that, and</p>
<p> unless the people want to be rehabilitated. I mean there's $16 million</p>
<p> on rehabilitation programmes.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I think it is the responsibility of any society</p>
<p> to always provide incentives and always encourage people to break the</p>
<p> habit. And I mean years ago people said you couldn't by public programmes</p>
<p> and so forth discourage people from smoking. Now we've demonstrated</p>
<p> over the years, although there are far too many people who still smoke</p>
<p> a legal substance, that you can make an impact by public programmes, by</p>
<p> encouragement, by incentives and gradually changing the climate of opinion.</p>
<p> It's a slow process but I think that is a far better way to go. But</p>
<p> it's been good talking to you Brian.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  Thank you Brian. Hello Nola, go ahead please. Yes,</p>
<p> Nola.</p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>  Oh, good morning Neil, I've been trying to get on</p>
<p> for a couple of days now.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  You're speaking to the Prime Minister more than me, but go ahead.</p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>  Oh ok. Yes, look I'm not in favour of the injecting</p>
<p> rooms, I am more in favour of getting at the actual dealers themselves.</p>
<p> And my son was a user and he died and he would not have used them.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL</p>
<p>  He wouldn't have used a shooting gallery?</p>
<p>  CALLER</p>
<p>  No, no he would not. They believe they're invincible</p>
<p> they really do. He did all the wrong things, he took it by himself in</p>
<p> a secluded spot and he would never ever have imagined that he couldn't</p>
<p> have coped.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL</p>
<p>  Prime Minister?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well that's very sad indeed and I agree with you</p>
<p> Nola that we have to try and get the dealers, we have to try and persuade</p>
<p> people not to start and those who are addicted we've got to try and</p>
<p> encourage them through the rehabilitation programs we offer to think about</p>
<p> stopping and then give them all the support we can as they try and do</p>
<p> so. That's the broad, the very broad direction of the Federal Government's</p>
<p> approach. </p>
<p>  And can I say in relation to most issues there's</p>
<p> not a lot of disagreement between the federal and state governments around</p>
<p> Australia. My only real difference of opinion with this and the Victorian</p>
<p> government and a number of other governments is on heroin injecting rooms</p>
<p> and heroin trials and all the other areas we're working together</p>
<p> very closely with diversionary programs. We're offering a lot more</p>
<p> money to fund rehabilitation programs. I think the states have dropped</p>
<p> the ball in the past on those programs but we're putting a lot more</p>
<p> money into them and we hope that they increase their allocations as well.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL</p>
<p>  We'll take one more call on this. Marilyn go ahead</p>
<p> please.</p>
<p>  CALLER</p>
<p>  Prime Minister it's Marilyn speaking. I am another</p>
<p> mother who's lost her daughter to heroin. My daughter was very well</p>
<p> educated, very intelligent and as she said to me, 'Mum I was in the</p>
<p> wrong place at the wrong time. We tried all the rehab; we tried naltrexone</p>
<p> and she still died, she was seventeen due to turn eighteen. Mr Howard</p>
<p> I feel you're approaching it the wrong way, you're not giving</p>
<p> us parents enough support, enough learning about how to deal with our</p>
<p> children in these situations and it's only a parent who will go the</p>
<p> extra mile to save a child. I've since joined other groups and found</p>
<p> ways that I could have helped my daughter but at the time I rang every</p>
<p> drug place from one side of Australia to another only to be told what</p>
<p> can we do.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  How long ago did...</p>
<p>  CALLER:</p>
<p>  Nine months ago my daughter died Mr Howard. I have written</p>
<p> to you time and time again all I have ever received is letters back from</p>
<p> Secretaries saying that they will pass this on to the Health Minister,</p>
<p> to whoever. That's all that's ever come of it.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Look I can't, you can never find enough words and</p>
<p> the right words to help a situation like that. I can only try to imagine</p>
<p> the anguish that you've felt. It's interesting in the space</p>
<p> of a couple of minutes here that I have had two mothers who have lost</p>
<p> children with diametrically opposed views and that just highlights what</p>
<p> a difficult issue this is. Nobody has a monopoly of wisdom. All one can</p>
<p> do is say what you think and argue what you believe and I have listened</p>
<p> to a lot of parents. I have talked to parents. I can't talk to every</p>
<p> parent who writes to me about these sorts of tragedies, but I can assure</p>
<p> the caller and all of your listeners that I have spent a lot of time over</p>
<p> the last few years sitting down talking to parents whose children have</p>
<p> overdosed. Whose children have suicided, whose children have grappled</p>
<p> with the drug problem and I get a different reading from different people.</p>
<p> You don't get a uniform view, you get some like the lady I have just</p>
<p> spoken to who feels that heroin injecting rooms are worth a try. You get</p>
<p> the other lady who was very strongly opposed to them and who had a very</p>
<p> strong view in another direction. Its just a very...</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  [inaudible] temptation. I mean it was the figures, three</p>
<p> hundred and fifty nine last year I think in Victoria. Things are worth</p>
<p> trying aren't they?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well only if you are satisfied they are not going to</p>
<p> make it worse. And if you are satisfied on the basis of what's been</p>
<p> tried elsewhere that they are not going to be made worse.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  OK, we'll take a break and come back with more from</p>
<p> the Prime Minister in a moment.</p>
<p>  [ad break]</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  Other issues to the Prime Minister in our Sydney studio.</p>
<p> Mr Howard Internet gambling. Now you have overruled the States and will</p>
<p> have a ban on Internet gaming...</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Can I just interrupt if you don't mind? You say</p>
<p> overrule and people are talking about us overriding. This is not a case</p>
<p> where we're using an external affairs power or some kind of overarching</p>
<p> power to prohibit something that the states normally regulate. We control</p>
<p> communications. Communications in Australia, of which the Internet is</p>
<p> part, is regulated by Federal Law. It's not regulated by state law.</p>
<p> You see people have mistakenly drawn a comparison between this and say</p>
<p> something like mandatory sentencing. Mandatory sentencing is something</p>
<p> that belongs to the criminal law, which is always administered by the</p>
<p> State. I mean we are not overriding, we are merely saying that we might</p>
<p> exercise our power to control what is on the Internet.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  Ok, but all states except two want to go ahead with Internet</p>
<p> gambling. You don't want to, why?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well because we think there is too much gambling in this</p>
<p> country already. And it's far easier to stop something starting than</p>
<p> trying to wind back something that has been there for years. I mean that,</p>
<p> it's just a matter of elementary common sense.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  But isn't it inevitable? It seems it's right around</p>
<p> the world and...</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Not necessarily. I mean people... that is the classic</p>
<p> argument put up saying that you can't ever have an influence on anything.</p>
<p> This country has sent a very clear signal, the community has and it's</p>
<p> there for the world to see that we have enough gambling opportunities</p>
<p> already. The attitude of some of the States on this is hard to fathom.</p>
<p> It is irresponsible. They are just interested in the revenue. I mean one</p>
<p> of these states, Queensland, the Government apparently has an interest</p>
<p> in one of the operators who wants the Internet licence, a financial interest.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  Do you think this Internet gambling is what, more dangerous?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well it's just going to open up yet another avenue.</p>
<p> I mean Neil you know as well as I do from your life's experience</p>
<p> that once people are doing something, to persuade them to stop, I mean</p>
<p> we were just talking a few moment ago about drug addiction and how difficult</p>
<p> it is once people are addicted for them to stop. I mean we are talking</p>
<p> here about an issue like gambling where you do have problem gambling.</p>
<p> I am not worried about the average Australian who punts or gambles in</p>
<p> moderation, it's part of Australian life. Of course I'm not.</p>
<p> I don't have a wowser view on it but I do think that there are abuses</p>
<p> of gambling. There are problem gambling, gamblers and the more opportunities</p>
<p> you provide, the more difficult the issue becomes and what we ask the</p>
<p> States to do is to match, to live up to their social responsibility. Now</p>
<p> I thank the Governments of New South Wales and Western Australia, one</p>
<p> Labor, one Liberal, so it's not a party political issue, for the</p>
<p> attitude that they have taken and we are now going to look to the power</p>
<p> that we believe we have and to see if we can feasibly implement the moratorium</p>
<p> and then see where we go after that. But this is not a question of us</p>
<p> interfering in an area where the states have responsibilities. We have</p>
<p> the legal authority to regulate communication, broadcasting, television,</p>
<p> the Internet is part of it and it's not an override.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  What about after that year long moratorium, do you then</p>
<p> try to stop it entirely or what do you do?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well you have, if you have a moratorium, it can't</p>
<p> happen during that period of time and during that moratorium, we wanted</p>
<p> to investigate the feasibility of a permanent prohibition on the Internet.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  A permanent prohibition?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes, that's what we are looking at. I mean the question</p>
<p> of whether we go ahead with it, depends on the result of that study but</p>
<p> we are asking the States to work with us to implement that moratorium</p>
<p> and Western Australia and New South Wales responsibly have said yes but</p>
<p> unfortunately the other states have said no. I think their reasons are</p>
<p> unconvincing in the extreme. I mean if you think you are serious about</p>
<p> winding back an addiction somebody already has, but you can let a new</p>
<p> addiction potentially commence, I just think that is very illogical and</p>
<p> I am very disappointed in the attitude of some of the states.</p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  Couple of other things. Petrol prices are soaring pre-Easter.</p>
<p> There is a good deal of, as you know cynicism about it, you know, here</p>
<p> we go petrol prices are going up. Is there nothing the Government can</p>
<p> do about it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well the price of petrol, I think I have explained before,</p>
<p> I would be happy to say again, is regulated by the world price of oil</p>
<p> and we are influenced by that world price and it does fluctuate according</p>
<p> to fluctuations on the spot market. </p>
<p>  MITCHELL:</p>
<p>  The dot com crash as it was called this week. The problems</p>
<p> of the economy... are there significant problems for the Australian economy</p>
<p> in what happened this week on stock markets around the world?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No, I think you have to accept that you will have volatility</p>
<p> on stock markets. It's part of what a stock market is about. Stock</p>
<p> markets go up and down. They're built on a degree of speculation</p>
<p> and people investing in the hope of increases and selling against the</p>
<p> possibility of losses that's been there for time immemorial, we should</p>
<p> not be surprised particularly as we've seen over recent months a</p>
<p> flood of money into tech stocks and some that looked very speculative.</p>
<p> The fundamentals of the Australian economy Ne</p>
