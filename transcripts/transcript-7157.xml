TRANSCRIPT OF COMMENTS, PARLIAMENT HOUSE MONDAY 6 APRIL 1987<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: You've been waiting since when?<br />
JOURNALIST: 9.00 o'clock.<br />
PM: Are you getting a bit hungry?<br />
JOURNALIST: Not really. How do you feel about four year terms<br />
Prime Minister?<br />
PM: I've made it quite clear all along, I think four year terms<br />
make a lot of sense.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you going to speak to Mr Howard about it soon?<br />
PM: Is he the one to speak to, or is it Mr Elliot?<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think Mr Elliot is going to make it?<br />
PM: I don't know, I really don't know, but there is time for<br />
these things and I'll speak to the Leader of the opposition,<br />
whoever that is, at the appropriate time.<br />
JOURNALIST: You must think he'd be a formidable opponent?<br />
PM: No I don't.<br />
JOURNALIST: About the four year term, would you be considering<br />
it. as a fixed term, or would the Prime Minister still have the<br />
option to go early?<br />
PM: Well I think there are arguments both ways. I notice that<br />
in the proposal put by the Business Council of Australia they<br />
were not suggesting it be a fixed term, that there should be<br />
still. some options there for a prime minister. They made the<br />
judgment, that I guess is valid, that with four year terms you'd<br />
be getting at least three years, but I'm a full term man, as you<br />
know. JOURNALIST: what are the benefits of going long term?<br />
PM: Having four years? Well the obvious ones that I think are<br />
recognised right around the world, with three years it gives the<br />
Government not enough time normally, I think, to be prepared to<br />
take all the decisions, the hard decisions that are necessary. </p>
<p>2<br />
The Government gets in, it is settling in, it has a year or so<br />
and then it's thinking about the next election. Unfortunate for<br />
this Government because we've been prepared to make the tough<br />
decisions from the word go and keep on doing it. But for any<br />
government, including my own, I guess there is a greater sense of<br />
confidence if you've got the longer period of four years than<br />
three. JOURNALIST: Would you like to see a referendum on this at the<br />
next election?<br />
PM: Well obviously I'll give consideration to that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you consider clouding the issue by throwing<br />
PM: I never cloud any issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: several referendum proposals in one, instead of<br />
just the one?<br />
PM: No. Why would I do that? That would be silly.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, on another issue, the plumbers'<br />
union building up a campaign, demanding the repeal of 45D. How<br />
do you feel?<br />
PM: I've got no sympathy for the plumbers' union. I've got a<br />
lot of sympathy for members of unions, but I've got no sympathy<br />
for the leadership of the plumbers' union which has misled its<br />
membership very badly.<br />
JOURNALIST: One final point Prime Minister, the reaction to the<br />
Aids commercial. Sir, there has been a lot of criticism that it<br />
is too shocking, that it is too brutal.<br />
PM: I also notice that there has been some criticism that it<br />
hasn't been shocking enough, so it just goes to show that you<br />
can't win them all.<br />
ends I I<br />
