    <content><![CDATA[<p>PM RUDD: Ladies and gentleman, this is an important day in the practical relationship between Australia and Indonesia. </p>
<p>The people of Indonesia, the people of Australia, the people of the wider Asia-Pacific region are subject to natural disasters on an increasing scale.</p>
<p>Already many countries within our region are affected by earthquakes. And we see the impact of that in China, in Indonesia, the Philippines and other countries.</p>
<p>Also our region is subject to intense volcanic activity.</p>
<p>And now we see as a consequence of climate change, increased storm activity and with greater intensity.</p>
<p>With natural disasters, none of us can predict who will be next affected. Who will be hit next. And the problem is there is so little notice when they come.</p>
<p>Therefore, the challenge which the President and I have discussed back in Jakarta in June is how we can do better on this as two major countries within our wider region.</p>
<p>And therefore, we've had our officials study this question intensively in recent months.</p>
<p>This has lead to this practical proposal for an Australia-Indonesia Disaster Reduction Facility.</p>
<p>Specifically, we in Australia will be investing some $67 million over five years in this Institute. And the purpose of this facility is as follows:</p>
<p>One, to organise joint exercises which enhance inter-operability in pre-disaster periods.</p>
<p>Two, to develop the use of realistic scenarios concerning natural disaster management.</p>
<p>Three, pursuing better integration of military actors and civilian lead elements in both exercising and planning.</p>
<p>Four, also working through this facility to integrate its efforts with other counterdisaster management organisations which exist across the region.</p>
<p>We believe that this provides a great opportunity for Australia and Indonesia to develop together a world class facility which becomes very important in the future in both preparing for, training, as well as long term deployment of counter natural disaster elements in dealing with disasters when they hit.</p>
<p>We can either stand back and do nothing on the basis of what we have seen in recent years, or, as Governments, we can act together. And what we the Government of Indonesia and the Government of Australia have decided to do is to take the lead within our region to bring this important facility into being.</p>
<p>This will take some time to develop. It will take some time to properly integrate with other efforts across the Asia-Pacific region. But we believe it is the right course of action rather than simply to wait until the next major natural disaster hits.</p>
<p>The reason why our two governments have done this, apart from the friendship which exists between Australia and Indonesia, is this  -  we also, Australia and Indonesia, are co-chairs of the APEC taskforce on emergency preparedness.</p>
<p>And let us never forget the reason we are co-chairs is because we together confronted the terrible tragedy which was the tsunami in Indonesia. The impact which it had on Aceh, the impact which it had on hundreds of thousands of lives at that time, at that tragic time. That's why this became a matter of concern for our two countries, that's why it became a matter of concern for our wider region through our friends in APEC. And that's why we have resolved together to undertake this practical action in establishing this Australia-Indonesia Disaster Reduction Facility.</p>
<p>The work has begun, and I would thank our friends in Indonesia for the strong cooperative approach they have taken in bringing this idea to fruition. We look forward to its implementation from next year on. And if there is one thing which we have done together in the future which we can hopefully look back on in years to come as making a practical, tangible difference to the lives of many in our region and across the Indonesian archipelago we will hopefully be able to say the creation of this facility on this day with this announcement was the beginning of that good work.</p>
<p>I thank you very much, Mr President.</p>
