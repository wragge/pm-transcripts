FOR PRESS 23 AUGUST 1978<br />
DEATH OF PRESIDENT KENYATTA OF KENYA<br />
Australians will understand the sorrow of Kenyans at the death<br />
of their President, Jomo Kenyatta.<br />
He had been President of Kenya for 14 years. His office was<br />
marked by a stability and progress which served Kenya well<br />
in an often turbulent continent.<br />
Jomo Kenyatta was more than a President. He was also the<br />
national leader who inspired a people and brought them from<br />
colonialism to independence. As such, he will always have a<br />
special place in Kenyan, African and Commonwealth history. </p>
