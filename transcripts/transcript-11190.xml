    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I've called this news conference with Mr</p>
<p> Ruddock to announce to announce a number of decisions that the Government</p>
<p> has taken today in response to the appalling human tragedy that is</p>
<p> unfolding in Europe particularly in the wake of the forced expulsion</p>
<p> as an act of racial persecution by the forces of President Milosevic</p>
<p> of hundreds of thousands of Albanians who are now trapped in a most</p>
<p> distressing human situation. There are some varying estimates but</p>
<p> there's not much doubt that we are talking about 300,000 to 400,000</p>
<p> people at the very least who have been displaced from their homes.</p>
<p> It is a humanitarian crisis of immense proportions and one that is</p>
<p> likely to get a lot worse.</p>
<p>Australia geographically, of course, is a long way from Yugoslavia</p>
<p> but the Government does not believe that in the circumstances it would</p>
<p> be appropriate for Australia to rely on geographic distance as an</p>
<p> excuse for not doing more. We have already announced a contribution</p>
<p> of $2 million to humanitarian organisations working in the region</p>
<p> including to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, CARE</p>
<p> Australia, the Red Cross and World Vision. The Cabinet has decided</p>
<p> today to increase that contribution by another $4 million to a total</p>
<p> of $6 million and the assistance will go towards meeting the urgent</p>
<p> relief needs of displaced people in Albania, Macedonia and other surrounding</p>
<p> countries.</p>
<p>But more importantly the Government has decided that Australia should</p>
<p> play its role in the international effort to relieve the burden on</p>
<p> neighbouring states and we have decided to provide within Australia's</p>
<p> safe haven for up to 4,000 people displaced from Kosovo on a temporary</p>
<p> basis until the situation on the ground improves. It will be for an</p>
<p> initial period of three months depending Â and that'll be</p>
<p> renewable Â depending on the circumstances as they unfold in</p>
<p> Kosovo. I do want to emphasise that this is a purely temporary measure.</p>
<p> Our main aim must be to see these people returned to their homes,</p>
<p> their villages and hamlets in Kosovo as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This decision by the Government is taken as a special measure. It</p>
<p> is to be seen as separate and apart from the normal immigration and</p>
<p> refugee programme. It is conditional on one very important consideration</p>
<p> and that is the passage of legislation by the Federal Parliament with</p>
<p> effect from today, establishing a situation where none of the 4,000</p>
<p> people will be able to initiate any action within Australia for a</p>
<p> change of status. They will not be entitled to seek while in Australia</p>
<p> any change of status. The intention is that they will be provided</p>
<p> with accommodation, with food, the basic necessities of life and health</p>
<p> care. In the nature of an emergency operation such as this it would</p>
<p> be necessary for these people to be received and looked after in perhaps</p>
<p> some defence installations. We have already initiated an urgent assessment</p>
<p> of available temporary accommodation and we are, of course, willing</p>
<p> to naturally bear the full cost of bringing people to Australia. They</p>
<p> are to be here as a special category of displaced people with the</p>
<p> intention that they should return. The passage of that legislation</p>
<p> is a pre-condition or an agreement for the passage of the legislation</p>
<p> rather it is a condition of the implementation of decision.</p>
<p>I have spoken to Mr Beazley the Leader of the Opposition this afternoon.</p>
<p> He has indicated strong support for the Government's decision</p>
<p> and an in-principle commitment to support the passage of the legislation</p>
<p> through the Federal Parliament. I welcome that expression of support</p>
<p> from Mr Beazley. Humanitarian responses of this kind ought as far</p>
<p> as possible to be conducted on a bi-partisan basis.</p>
<p>I want to emphasise to you, ladies and gentlemen, that this is a humanitarian</p>
<p> disaster, a human tragedy beyond the normal tragedies and developments</p>
<p> to which we have almost become numbed over the years. The movement</p>
<p> of populations is the greatest, I understand, in the experience of</p>
<p> Europe since World War II. The behaviour of the Milosevic forces which</p>
<p> have engaged in acts of racial persecution are quite unacceptable.</p>
<p> The Government believes that despite the fact that we are not part</p>
<p> of NATO and we are not involved in any way, of course, with the military</p>
<p> action that we do have a responsibility on humanitarian grounds to</p>
<p> participate in the relief of suffering of such a magnitude.</p>
<p>Australia has a very long and proud record of providing a humanitarian</p>
<p> response to the mass uprooting and movements of populations around</p>
<p> the world and this is very much of a peace with those responses. It</p>
<p> is the sort of response that I believe the Australian public expects</p>
<p> of its Government but more importantly than that it is the right response</p>
<p> because this is a terrible tragedy and even though it is a long way</p>
<p> from Australia we have to play our part.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible].. what's changed the Government's thinking?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well let me something. Mr Ruddock will no doubt say something about</p>
<p> that as well. But what Mr Ruddock said yesterday was utterly consistent</p>
<p> with the Government's immigration policy. And indeed one matter</p>
<p> that I did not mention was to reconfirm that Mr Ruddock's earlier</p>
<p> indication that in recognition of the grave situation on the ground</p>
<p> Australia is prepared to extend the visas of the estimated 2,000 visitors</p>
<p> from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on a case by case basis. What</p>
<p> Mr Ruddock said yesterday was utterly consistent with the Government's</p>
<p> position and policy. This is a special response to a particular situation</p>
<p> which should be seen separately and apart from, and in addition to,</p>
<p> the normal refugee and humanitarian response programme.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible].Mr Ruddock said they would not go back after the temporary</p>
<p> status.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I beg your pardon.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Ruddock argued that people on temporary status were unlikely to</p>
<p> go back.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I haven't read every single thing Mr Ruddock has said and</p>
<p> Mr Ruddock will no doubt speak for himself. But what is important</p>
<p> is that the Cabinet has looked at this whole situation and has decided,</p>
<p> quite properly in my view, that a special response in all of the circumstances</p>
<p> is needed. Now everything that Mr Ruddock said in relation to the</p>
<p> normal operation of the immigration programme was utterly consistent</p>
<p> with Government policy. And I completely endorse in every way his</p>
<p> handling of the situation. We had a discussion about it, we thought</p>
<p> about it long and hard, and we decided that this was the right thing</p>
<p> to do. Now if you want to spend the next half an hour asking me questions</p>
<p> about what Mr Ruddock said, or thought, or I did before today, well</p>
<p> you go ahead. But I tell you what, I won't be here to answer</p>
<p> them because I think the quality of the decision and the appropriateness</p>
<p> of the decision that had been taken is the right thing.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can I just ask, how are these people physically going to get here?</p>
<p> Are Australian RAAF planes going to be involved, and how soon do you</p>
<p> expect the first people to arrive?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Tony, I can only say in response to that that people are working</p>
<p> away furiously now to make those arrangements. I can't answer</p>
<p> all of that now. Just a moment Aban. I can't answer that. All</p>
<p> I can say to you is that we've taken this decision, I've</p>
<p> outlined the basis of the decision. We've now asked all of our</p>
<p> advisers to prepare a detailed game plan. Clearly there will be, I</p>
<p> imagine, involved the chartering of aircraft, the use of all available</p>
<p> aircraft. We've got to work out appropriate procedures for selection.</p>
<p> There are a million and one things that will need to be done. The</p>
<p> important thing is that we are indicating to the Australian people,</p>
<p> and we're indicating to the world a willingness to help. And</p>
<p> that will make a small contribution to I hope improving the spirits</p>
<p> and improving the sense of hope and relieving the sense of despair</p>
<p> which is no doubt being experienced by these hundreds of thousands</p>
<p> of unfortunate human beings. This is something where a nation of Australia's</p>
<p> strength and wealth, and comparative affluence has an overwhelming</p>
<p> moral obligation to play a part in. That's why we've taken</p>
<p> the decision and it's the right decision. As to all the details</p>
<p> of it, I can't answer your question. I don't know yet. We've</p>
<p> got to work many of those details out. I'm sure with the support</p>
<p> of the Opposition, the goodwill of the Opposition, and I hope the</p>
<p> goodwill of the Australian community and people who support humanitarian</p>
<p> responses that we'll be able to get the job done and get it done</p>
<p> quickly. We obviously need to act as speedily as possible. We know</p>
<p> there's a cost involved. It's a cost worth incurring because</p>
<p> there's a humanitarian response involved.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, can these people be kept under some form of restraint,</p>
<p> I mean, effective captivity so that they don't just scatter in</p>
<p> the community?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look, initially, Peter, they'll obviously have to go to,</p>
<p> you know, arrival centres around the country. There'll need to</p>
<p> be health checks and so forth. The question of their future movements</p>
<p> away from the initial reception areas, that is something that we're</p>
<p> giving consideration to and we're seeking advice on. You can't</p>
<p> resolve all of these matters in the space of a few hours. You do need</p>
<p> to get advice. They are to be seen as not as part of the normal immigration</p>
<p> programme. And I think if you look at what the Americans are doing</p>
<p> and many of the other countries are doing, I think the Americans are,</p>
<p> so I've been informed, are going to receive them on the Guantanamo</p>
<p> Naval Base in Cuba and also at Guam. They're making special arrangements.</p>
<p> We will give a broadly similar response. The aim of the exercise is</p>
<p> to provide a safe haven. The aim of the exercise is to give to these</p>
<p> people some sense of physical security, sustenance, but not to do</p>
<p> it in a way that relieves the international political pressure on</p>
<p> Milosevic. And one of the criticisms that could be made of the automatic</p>
<p> inclusion of these 4000 people in the normal refugee programme would</p>
<p> be that it would signal that Milosevic had won and that he had succeeded</p>
<p> in expelling these people from their own country. We think this is</p>
<p> the appropriate humanitarian response which falls short of conceding</p>
<p> political ground to Milosevic.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you have any concerns, Prime Minister, that it might lead to racial</p>
<p> conflict here in Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't think it will lead to racial conflict here in Australia.</p>
<p> Australians are humanitarian people. I think, if people look at things</p>
<p> from an Australian national interest point of view, we have decided</p>
<p> to do this because it's the right thing for Australia to do.</p>
<p> We think that this country has a moral obligation to play its part.</p>
<p> I don't believe it will lead to racial conflict. And I can just</p>
<p> say again that Australia respects very much the right of people of</p>
<p> all origins to honour their heritage and preserve their culture. It</p>
<p> never respects the right of people to bring overseas hatreds and bitternesses</p>
<p> into this country wherever those hatreds or bitternesses come from.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did you discuss today's decision with any other leaders in NATO</p>
<p> or the US?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no. It is not in response to any request. It is a decision which</p>
<p> has been generated by the Australian Government of its own volition,</p>
<p> according to our assessment of what Australia ought to be doing. I</p>
<p> have not received any request and I'm not aware that Mr Ruddock</p>
<p> or Mr Downer has received any request from any foreign country. We</p>
<p> think it's the right thing for Australia to be doing and that's</p>
<p> why we've taken the decision.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What about the time the Government has [inaudible] of the situation</p>
<p> not being resolved in the Balkan in the three-month period?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, let's take one thing at a time. I've announced the</p>
<p> decision. I've explained the context in which the decision has</p>
<p> been taken. And what I am saying and what I'm doing, as I understand</p>
<p> it, is no different from the way in which Mr Blair and President Clinton</p>
<p> and others are responding to like questions. I mean, our response</p>
<p> in concept is broadly similar to that of the United States, the United</p>
<p> Kingdom, Germany and a number of other European countries.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What they said about Tiannamen Square when Mr Hawke made his decision</p>
<p> Â one thing at a time Â but isn't the question that</p>
<p> was on your Immigration Minister's mind yesterday, what happens</p>
<p> after three months or, you know, is there an upper limit to the time</p>
<p> that you permit these people to stay?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am simply not even going to try and answer that question,</p>
<p> not even try. It is altogether too, it's too calculated, that's</p>
<p> too considered and calculated a question. I mean, you've got</p>
<p> a humanitarian crisis. You've got a flood of humanity coming</p>
<p> across borders in the most appalling circumstances and you are a relatively</p>
<p> affluent, very peaceful, very stable, very endowed, very lucky country.</p>
<p> You have a moral obligation to put your hand up and say to the rest</p>
<p> of the world, we are prepared to take our share and to play our part.</p>
<p> There will be problems. There will be difficulties. People will criticise</p>
<p> the decision. After a while people will get impatient and they'll</p>
<p> say you should have done this and you should have done that. I know</p>
<p> all of that and you'll be back with all sorts of questions. But</p>
<p> it is the right thing to do. And we'll deal with three months</p>
<p> in three months time.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>In relation to President Milosevic, isn't there a situation where</p>
<p> you intend to repatriate those people and if you can't, then</p>
<p> he has won.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Matt, I'm not going to answer a whole series of hypothetical</p>
<p> questions.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You've said there's no upper limit here, but do you have</p>
<p> reason...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No upper limit?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well, you've said that it can be renewed after three months and</p>
<p> presumably Kosovo won't be actually solved within three months...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm not prepared to speculate about what the situation</p>
<p> will be in three weeks let alone three months. So you may be able</p>
<p> to predict it but I'm not going to try to.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>My question was, really, was if Kosovo hasn't been solved to</p>
<p> the point where Albanians can go back and live there, will these people</p>
<p> be shunted off somewhere else down the track?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm not going to speculate about that. I'm really not. Except</p>
<p> to make the point that the decision that we've taken today can</p>
<p> hardly be categorised as lacking humanity. It's a compassionate,</p>
<p> fair, decent decision. And you can be certain that this Government,</p>
<p> in these matters, will always act in a compassionate, fair and decent</p>
<p> fashion but also with a healthy and firm regard to the Australian</p>
<p> national interest, which is why the whole proposition is conditional</p>
<p> on the passage of that legislation with effect from today which Mr</p>
<p> Beazley has told me this afternoon on the phone the Labor Party will</p>
<p> support.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
