<p>[ACKNOWLEDGMENTS OMITTED]</p>
<p>It's a great honour to join you for Greek Independence Day.</p>
<p>The Greek struggle for independence which began in 1821 not only freed a nation  -  it inspired the world.</p>
<p>When the Greek people fought for the rights and liberties âgraven ... in the hearts of all menâ you won the admiration of all free people and it is an admiration you have never forfeited since.</p>
<p>This is a day of seriousness and also of enjoyment: a day to commemorate great patriots and a day to celebrate what they won and what their descendants have built around the world.</p>
<p>It's strange to think that at the time of independence, most Greeks had not even heard of Australia. </p>
<p>Back in 1832 a Greek geography textbook advised that âvery little is known about [Australia] ... And scarcely anything is worth mentioningâ.</p>
<p>Fortunately for us, your ancestors didn't believe that!</p>
<p>Instead, you've come here, throughout our history, stayed here, raised families and built a proud community.</p>
<p>This Government works with you: we support Greek language in the national curriculum, our National Culture Policy is accessible to your community, our aged care programs are culturally and linguistically sensitive.</p>
<p>It's also no surprise that the people who invented the very idea of citizenship are among the most enthusiastic of all our migrant communities to become citizens of this country.</p>
<p>Let mecongratulate the local Greek community and Government of Greece for revivingour joint military heritage  -  especially rememberingthe island of Lemnos as the base for the Gallipoli campaign, as well as remembering the Greek campaign and the Battle of Crete in the Second World War.</p>
<p>This has quite a personal aspect for me, as some of you know.</p>
<p>During World War One, my mother's father, Alexander MacKenzie, fought alongside the Greeks in the Salonika Front in northern Greece.</p>
<p>When my grandfather left Barry in Wales in 1915 he left as a very young man ready to fight for freedom  -  when he returned home after three years of war he brought home with him the wounds he earned in service.</p>
<p>He also brought home a great privilege  -  the memory that he had fought for freedom alongside the Greeks, the knowledge that he had fought for freedom in freedom's home.</p>
<p>He witnessed your people's great courage and sacrifice and I was proud to commemorate that with you today.</p>
<p>My grandfather also witnessed the great generosity of people who know how to celebrate, and I am very glad to see this hasn't changed!</p>
<p>In what is now Thessaloniki it would have been the first time he tasted feta cheese and olive. </p>
<p>BeingWelsh he certainlyenjoyed Greek hospitality with local wines, beer and the tsipouro. </p>
<p>So enjoy that too!</p>
<p>I know many families are focused on economic issues in Greece and Cyprus. We wish them well.And we wish peace and justice for Cyprus.</p>
<p>My congratulations on today's magnificent occasion.</p>
<p>It's a marvellous day to commemorate and celebrate! </p>
<p>A great day to remember  -  and to have fun.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
