The Australian Government sends its best wishes to all Italians celebrating the 150th anniversary of Italy's unification this year.</p>
<p>Italy will officially celebrate 150 years of being a united country next month.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard said Australians have enjoyed and continue to cherish the wonderful contribution Italians have made to our community over many generations.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said we have deep historical ties with people of Italian origin that even pre-date Italy's unification.</p>
<p>The Governor-General will represent Australia at a celebration event marking the anniversary of Italian national unity in Italy next month.</p>
<p>At the Prime Minister's request, the Governor-General will attend the event on June 2 in Rome following an invitation from the President of the Italian Republic, Mr Giorgio Napolitano.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said it is fitting that Australia's Governor-General takes part in the celebrations, in light of the immense contribution the Italian community has made and continues to make to Australia.</p>
<p>The Governor General will represent all Australians, including more than 850,000 who have identified as having Italian ancestry.</p>
<p>During a wider visit to Italy, the Governor-General is expected to have an audience with Pope Benedict XVI as well as a meeting with the Secretary of State, Cardinal Bertone.</p>
<p>Her Excellency will also visit Domus Australia, the Australian Catholic Church's newly renovated building in Rome.</p>
<p>The Governor-General will participate at the Australian Pavilion for the Biennale and thank major Italian donors for their contributions to the relief effort for victims of the recent Queensland, New South Wales and Victorian floods.</p>
<p>Her Excellency has also been invited to visit Spain by King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sophia, who made a State Visit to Australia in 2009.</p>
<p>The Governor-General will take the opportunity to visit the Navantia dockyards at Ferrol, where HMAS Canberra and HMAS Adelaide are being constructed, and which supports our growing defence procurement program.   </p>
