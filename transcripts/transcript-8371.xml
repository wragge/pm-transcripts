FOR MEDIA 27 December 1991<br />
SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF PRIME MINISTER AND CABINET<br />
The Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and<br />
Cabinet, Mr Mike Codd, AC, will be retiring from the Public<br />
Service, after nearly six years in that position, and I wish<br />
to record here -the outstanding service he has given to this<br />
and previous governments.<br />
The Government will be appointing Mr Codd to the Boards of<br />
AOTC and Qantas, which will enable him to continue his<br />
distinguished contribution to the public sector of this<br />
country. The Government will be recommending to the Governor-General<br />
the appointment of Dr Michael Keating, AO, as the new<br />
Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and<br />
Cabinet. Dr Keating has been Secretary of the Department of Finance<br />
for almost six years and before that was Secretary of the<br />
then Department of Employment and Industrial Relations.<br />
His earlier career included two periods of work for the OECD<br />
in Paris, as wel. l as periods in the Australian Bureau of<br />
Statistics, the then Department of Urban and Regional<br />
Development and the Department of the Prime Minister and<br />
Cabinet.<br />
