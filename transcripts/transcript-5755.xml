PRIM AUTAIAISTE<br />
FOR MEDIA 21 FEBRUARY-1982<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
HMAS Tobruk, the Royal Australian Navy's supply ship, left<br />
last week for the Middle East with the eight Australian<br />
helicopters;, and other equipment for Australia's contingent<br />
in the Sinai Peacekeeping Force. The troops of our main<br />
contingent,. numbering in all about 120 men, will fly out<br />
later, in time to establish themselves at their posts by<br />
March. But their big starting day will be 25 April.<br />
That is the date laid down in the Treaty of Peace between<br />
Israel and Egypt when the Israelis will withdraw their military<br />
and civil personnel from the remaining parts of Egypt's<br />
Sinai territory which they occupied during the 1967 Middle<br />
East War. That date will mark the end of a whole era in the<br />
tragedy of the Middle East conflict.<br />
Australia's participation in the Peacekeeping Force means the<br />
association of our country with a new chapter. This new<br />
chapter is one which could not have come into prospect without<br />
the courage and determination of the leaders of Egypt and<br />
Israel to achieve the peace which now exists between them.<br />
The Peacekeeping Force is there because these two countries,<br />
which were at war, want it to be there to guarantee peace.<br />
The Peacekeeping Force will underpin the achievement of peace<br />
within one major area of a region which has been the most<br />
unstable in the world since the Second World War. The<br />
hatred, suspicion and bitterness which have arisen from the<br />
special circumstances of that region led to four wars in<br />
the space of one generation. These wars have threatened<br />
world peace. We know that any future war in that part of<br />
the world will seriously Jeopardise the fragile stability<br />
overseas which is so precious to Australians. The vital<br />
interests of too many important countries are caught up in.<br />
Middle East affairs for another outbreak of war there to<br />
leave Australia unscathed. No one can be certain about<br />
peace anywhere. Peace requires strenuous efforts if it is<br />
to be maintained. It requires constant vigilance, constant<br />
awareness, but above all a preparedness to make sacrifices.<br />
We are prEpared to make such sacrifices.<br />
Peace will. fail by default if all nations wanting peace leave:<br />
the actual. pursuit of it to others. It has never been part<br />
of the Australian tradition to let this happen. In the Middle<br />
East alrea~ dy Australia has contributed to a number of<br />
peacekeeping operations. We have contributed men to the United<br />
Nations truce supervisory organisation, and men and helicoptErs<br />
to the United Nations Emergency Force in another part of the Sinai.<br />
./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
We have contributed police to the-United Nations force in<br />
Cyprus and Australian defence force personnel to the United<br />
Nations military observer group in India and Pakistan.<br />
The United Nations has a record in these peacekeeping operations<br />
of which it can be proud. We would have preferred that the<br />
Sinai Peacekeeping Force be a further part of that record.<br />
But faced with a Soviet veto of a United Nations mandate for<br />
the Peacekeeping Force faced with a choice between a.<br />
force which -could be set up outside the United Nations umbrella<br />
and no force at all, we were not prepared to let the Soviet<br />
Union achieve its obstructionist objective in the search for<br />
a Middle East peace. There is no reason why the United Nations<br />
should not at some time in the future extend its mandate to<br />
include this peacekeeping activity. Nor is there any reason,<br />
of course, why the United Nations must always be associated<br />
with successful international efforts to mediate in situations<br />
of conflict and maintain the peace.<br />
One of the most successful episodes in recent years in resolving<br />
conflict and. hostility between nations was the Commonwealth<br />
contribution. to the implementation of the Lancaster House<br />
Agreement by which Zimbabwe attained its independence. Austra] lia<br />
was a key participant in the negotiations leading to the<br />
Agreement. We were one of the principal contributors to the<br />
military force ensuring that the ceasef ire led to a stable<br />
political settlement. We are also going to play a role, under<br />
Commonwealth auspices, in the training of the Ugandan army<br />
to help the government of Uganda overcome the disintegration<br />
of that country after the years of Idi Amin's destructive rule..<br />
When the Government took its decision last October to participate<br />
in the SinaiL Peacekeeping Force, we did so on the condition<br />
that there would be significant European participation. We<br />
were not then certain that there would be wide-ranging<br />
international participation, but we felt that a country like<br />
Australia had a unique contribution to make in starting the<br />
ball rolling. Our decision has indeed been vindicated.<br />
Last October, among the major countries, only the United States<br />
had committed itself to participate in the Force. Since<br />
Australia took its decision Britain, France, The Netherlands<br />
and Italy, -as well as New Zealand, have joined the Force.<br />
These later decisions have been most gratifying to the Government<br />
and in retospect we can see our decision as being a catalyst<br />
to the events which have subsequently taken place.<br />
There again, when we took our decision in principle last year,<br />
fears were to be heard about the reactions of the Arab states.<br />
which, objecting for their own reasons to the Egypt/ Israel<br />
peace treaty, were thought to be poised to retaliate against<br />
Australian interests if we decided to join the Peacekeeping<br />
Force. In the event there has been no adverse reaction, no<br />
threats to embassies, no measures taken against our trade, no<br />
interdiction of movement by Australians in Arab countries. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
What seems to have happened is that these other countries have<br />
had a higher regard for the achievements that Egypt has been<br />
able to make both in regaining its territory and in establishing<br />
the basis for peace with Israel than had the critics of the<br />
time. Moreover, even though these countries do not themselves<br />
support the Camp David Accords, they understand very clearly<br />
Australia is seeking to advance the cause of peace in the<br />
Middle East.<br />
No one can doubt that the return of the Sinai to Egypt is<br />
but one part. of the complex of problems which any comprehensive<br />
and lasting peace in the Middle East must solve. A solution<br />
to the Palestinian issue is clearly central to the future<br />
stability and peace of the Middle East. Our troops will not<br />
be involved with the issues making up the dispute between<br />
Israel and the Arab countries over the Palestinians' rights.<br />
But in our participation we are concerned that our contribution<br />
should have the maximum positive influence in continuing<br />
and broadening the peace process in the Middle East.<br />
The withdrawal of Israel from the Sinai, if it can be achieved<br />
successfully, will be a large contribution to confidence among<br />
the disputants. Such confidence is a vital ingredient of the<br />
new chapter which will open in the Middle East after 25 April.<br />
Australia will be looking to all the parties to the dispute<br />
as well as the United States to ensure effective progress<br />
in these otlher vital areas. </p>
