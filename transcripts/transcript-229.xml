PIDE MHINISTER:<br />
QUESTION: PR9DIME iINISTER:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
QUESTION: PRD,, E M:, INISTER: I'd like to put you on warning that I'-<br />
supposed to make a long statement in the<br />
House tomorrow night on my deeds and misdecd. s<br />
abroad, stated with proper reticence, so Id<br />
better not try to make it now. I think perhaps<br />
we might try to concentrate on a few points.<br />
Now which ones, from the newspaper point of<br />
view or television point of view would you like<br />
me to say a little about?<br />
Inaudible Could you tell us anything ab'out<br />
the Malayan proposal for Dutch jest New Guinea?<br />
That is not one of the matters that I've been<br />
discussing.<br />
That's why I asked you, Sir.<br />
Yes I thought so. Oh, I knowi a little about it,<br />
but I don't think that any comment about it will<br />
be useful at this stage. I'll find out what the<br />
developments have boeen over the last couple of<br />
days.<br />
Could you toll us Sir. whether you think as a<br />
result of the proceedings at the time you were in<br />
Now York the world situation has improved or<br />
worsened? , ell I think it would be very difficult to say<br />
whether the state of the world was easicr or<br />
more tense. I sup ose that depends on what you<br />
think about whether Khrushchev's tactics were<br />
designac to cae tension or to increase it.<br />
Frankly I thought th-. at he camnc thoro lo increase<br />
tension though he's a strong aLvocato, judging<br />
by what he tells me, of a Summit Conference.<br />
But it's very difficult w'iith a man like that<br />
who's a mixture a dictator with a strong<br />
earthy sense of humour, a certain notion of th*<br />
ridiculous, a fellow who thoroughly enjoys beating<br />
his shoe on the desk and hopes that somebody<br />
will take it seriously. I mecan he's a mixture.<br />
( Aside This is a nice sound-proof room).<br />
But I think going back to th! at I think that<br />
one thing he arrived there to do was to wveaken<br />
the present United Nations, primarily by an<br />
attack on the Secretary-General. Bccause he<br />
repeatedly made very savage attacks, usu. ally<br />
of course saying that Hram-in-arskjoeld was a tool<br />
of the capitalists, and such like original<br />
phrases that one becomes familiar witt, that<br />
he represented the western Doers, that no good<br />
could cone out of him, that what Khrushchev calls<br />
the Socialist power ought to be in the picture<br />
and that instead of one Secretary-General there<br />
ought to be three, </p>
<p>-2-<br />
QUESTION: PRD MINISTER:<br />
QUESTION: PRITE MINISTER:<br />
QUEST ION: A remarkable proposal Because it meant<br />
disuniting the United Nations. It meant having<br />
one Communist Secretary-General, one neutralist<br />
Secretary-General whatever that word<br />
means and one from the democratic western<br />
world, each of them presumably, so far as one<br />
could understand it, with a veto over the other<br />
two. It would, of course, have reduced the hole<br />
executive arm of the United Na tions to futility<br />
and therefore would have ben a dea. ily blow at<br />
the United Nations,<br />
It was taken very seriously by the United<br />
States, very seriously indeed. And if the<br />
outcome had been anything other than it vwas<br />
there might have been serious consequences.<br />
However, in the result, of course, he failed<br />
hopelessly in his attack on the Secretary-General.<br />
( Inaudible):<br />
I think that he sees himself as the focus of<br />
another kind of world organisation. After all,<br />
if he's to get the better of the western powcrs<br />
in the long run, it's very desirable for him to<br />
make a play for the support of people who are<br />
as yet uncommritted the African powers for<br />
example, who are very numerous now, and most of<br />
them very new, And ' sian powers not to be<br />
overlooked in this connection.<br />
: hen he said two or three times the United Nations<br />
ought to be established in Moscow, this wasn't<br />
merely a joke on his part. It cdid I thought,<br />
represent something that was ha If-sriously<br />
formed at the back of his nind.<br />
Have you any comment to nake Sir, about your<br />
interview with Mr. Khrushchev?<br />
I found it extremely interesting. I thought<br />
that it would be rather foolish to come back<br />
to Australia not having had a private talk with<br />
him and so I got my office to put in a bid<br />
through the usual channels, indicating, with<br />
my usual modesty, that 10 minutes would be very<br />
satisfactory if I could get them. And in the<br />
result I had 70 minutes. Indeed, so far as I<br />
know, we might still have been tal-'-ig but for<br />
the fact that other engagements emerged. But<br />
it was very interesting, very interesting.<br />
He's still something of a mystery to mec but<br />
perhaps not quite so much as before, because he<br />
has undoubtedly an earthy sort of humour,<br />
Did he thump the table, Sir, while he spoke to<br />
you? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
PRIME HINISTER:<br />
QUESTION: PRIIE MINISTER: Oh, no. Everything was quite relaxed and easy.<br />
He evern looked me up and down . and said for an<br />
Imperialist I wasn't a bad specimen. ( Laughter).<br />
And I told hin that as a Connunist he improved on<br />
closer inspection. ( Laughter).<br />
Pr. Mcnzies did you get the im. pression from him<br />
that he was quite serious about wanting a Summit<br />
Meeting? I think so. That's one thing I do believe. I<br />
believe he would like a Sunnit Meeting. And that's,<br />
perhaps, one of the positive results that I always<br />
hoped would come out of this imtter over the<br />
fanous amendment because the other three, France,<br />
Great Britain and the United States voted for a<br />
Sumnit Meeting as early as practicable which of<br />
coUBle were words designed to acco1mnodate the<br />
exigencies of the Presidential election in<br />
lnerica. And he himself made it quite clear to<br />
ne and I asked him whether there was any mystery<br />
about it, and he said " none whatever', that he<br />
wanted a Summit moeting, He realised it couldn't<br />
occur now until after the Presidential election<br />
and the new President had established hiLself. But<br />
so certain an I that he does, and therefore all<br />
four do, now, cearly declared, that most of our<br />
convero: ation had to do with what natters could<br />
usefully be discussed at the Summit. He nominated<br />
Disarmament. He said that is something that has<br />
to be discussed in the broad and in principle<br />
between the four atomic power le. aders before it<br />
can usefully be dealt with in point of detail.<br />
And therefore that's his friority No. 1. He<br />
thought that the problems of Berlin, for example,<br />
to take an example, were though important, ninor<br />
compared with the problen of disarnaIcnt. But<br />
anyhow for three quarters of an hour I discussed<br />
with him what sort of things could be discussed at<br />
aSurmmit mceting. How usefully, what the<br />
possibilities were of getting practical results, all<br />
this didn't argue to me that he was just going<br />
through the fom of saying that he wanted a<br />
Conference. Do you believe he wants a four-power Conference,<br />
not two?<br />
He wants a four-power. All this proposal about<br />
having a meeting between Khrushchev and Eisenhower<br />
never did have any reality in it. Bless my soul,<br />
before the thing had been tabled for hours each<br />
of the supposed neeters had said ' No'.<br />
Khrushchev had said ' I won't"\ except on terms<br />
that are obviously unacceptable and Eisenhower<br />
said the sane thing. I never have seen nuch use<br />
in an Assembly of Nations passing a resolution<br />
directed to two hunamn beings who have both<br />
rejected it in advance, ha. t's the sense of it?<br />
None. </p>

QUESTION:<br />
PRiME MINISTER:<br />
QUESTION: PRTIE MINIST ER: consistent with self-respect and it was<br />
distributed as he began to speak 65 pages of<br />
foolscap. So it was formidable.<br />
And with it, at the last nonent, came a page<br />
to be inserted, at page 65 headed " Vital<br />
Please insert this at page 65". And that<br />
contained the terms of the resolution. That's<br />
how much out of the blue it caie,<br />
There has been a suggestion here in Australia<br />
that because the amendment ( noise interruption)<br />
having a very bad effect on our relations with<br />
Asia.<br />
That suggestion has been made only in Australia.<br />
I'm sorry to say. Not a hint of . t at New York.<br />
I've been in the closest touch for the whole<br />
time that I've been there with a dozen of the<br />
leaders in Africa, Asia and elsewhere. No, I<br />
didn't see Soekarno because he left innmdiately<br />
after Speech. I saw Subandrio and had discussions<br />
with him.<br />
I didn't see Nasser because he left, I think he<br />
had actually gone the day I arrived. But I did<br />
see his Foreign Minister, Fawzik, who was present<br />
at the Suez talks that I had in 1956. I sat with<br />
him at dinner and we had a very interesting<br />
exchange of ideas.<br />
Then there was the new Prime inister of Nigeria,<br />
who, I thought nade the best speech of the entire<br />
Assembly a very renarkable man and I've great<br />
expectations of Nigeria as a wise and stabilising<br />
influence in the new Africa.<br />
Oh, I saw a lot of these people. Those are just<br />
namcs that occur to me.<br />
, hat did Mr. Nehru say Sir?<br />
' ell it's very odd. Mr. Nehru and I rct after<br />
he'd made his famous speech. He seelcd to be<br />
quite amiable. And there. fter I spoke. I made<br />
my main speech, which one or two people preferred<br />
not to publish in Australia, It is much nicer to<br />
try to underminc the position of the Prime M'inister<br />
of Australia when he was abroad. But when I made<br />
my nain speech I had occasion to make many<br />
references to what I believe to be Mr. Nehru's<br />
point of view. And so far as I know these were<br />
entirely consistent with his own mind.<br />
You don't want to build this up as if two people<br />
had a dog fight. They didn't. This is not the<br />
way to regard these natters. I have offered no<br />
word to which anybody could take exception to<br />
the distinguished leader of India. </p>

I have complete responsibility for initiating<br />
this matter. And all I can say is if we're<br />
going to talk in terms of substance, as<br />
sensible pcople should, then the substance of<br />
my proposal was that we should not try the<br />
futile task of getting two people together<br />
who said they were not willing to neet anyhow,<br />
but that we should add to the world pressure<br />
for a meeting of the four powers at the Su unit.<br />
And by the tine the day was ended that second<br />
position was as substantially achieved as<br />
anything should be. So why apologise? I like<br />
that expression " fall Luy". Thank you very much.<br />
That's Aerican isn't it?<br />
You would think Sir, then that the prospects,<br />
or the renewed prospects, of a Sunnit Meeting<br />
some tine next year are worthwhile?<br />
I do. I think that the new President of the<br />
United States will naturally want to establish<br />
his aidministration and all that sort of thing.<br />
I would have great hope myself that these people<br />
will get together by the northern spring,<br />
somewhere around April or May.<br />
The New York Times, Sir, refers to you in this<br />
morning's paper as " the good Snmritan",<br />
apparently because of your.....<br />
Jell that shows you have to go abroad to have<br />
nice renarks made about you in a newspaper.<br />
Mr. Menzies both the Anerican Presidential<br />
candidates stated that the only reason they<br />
would attend a Peace Conference, if elected, is<br />
if they had somne, alost written guarantee that<br />
sonething ( Airport noises)<br />
', iho was supposed to have said this?<br />
Both the An. erican Presidential candidates.<br />
Not in one of those debates, in one of those<br />
television debates?<br />

want to say about Television debates is " Never,<br />
with my approval, in Australia".<br />
