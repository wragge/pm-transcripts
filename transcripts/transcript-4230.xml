OPENING OF THE. WINDSOR COMM4UNITY AND CULTURAL CENTRE<br />
I am very pleased to be with you today for the opening of<br />
this magnificent community and cultural centre.<br />
The re-enactment we have just seen recalls one of the most<br />
outstanding of the colonial Governors, Lachlan Macquarie.<br />
It is a remarkable testimony to the quality of Lachlan<br />
Macquarie that after a century and a half he is still<br />
remembered for his contribution to the building of Australia.<br />
It is perhaps a measure of Australia that the two qualities<br />
of Macquarie most often recalled are his tireless woi k in<br />
developing the colony and his deep humanity. In these qualities<br />
he embodied two aspects of Australian life which we value greatly.<br />
We feel as sense of pride when we see the potential of<br />
Australia being realised. ' We all value deeply the respect and<br />
concern for others which has produced so much worthwhile<br />
social reform.<br />
Macquarie had great faith in the future of the colony of<br />
New South Wales. When he left Port Jackson in 1822, he had<br />
entirely rebuilt* Sydney's main public buildings. He had<br />
done the same at Parramatta and had created many townships,<br />
most of them out of wilderness. He had put up something<br />
like 200 main buildings and left New South Wales with three<br />
hundred miles of roadway.<br />
No Government in any colony of similar size and remoteness<br />
has ever come close ' to this achievement. Macquarie also<br />
sought to improve the quality of life in the colony for all its<br />
citizens. He organised the colony's first agricultural<br />
fairs and even the first horse races. He developed education<br />
to a point at which one fifth of the colonial revenue was spent<br />
on education. His policy towards the Aborigines was one of<br />
conciliation. He opened the first Aboriginal school for children.<br />
The major social matter for which his administration was<br />
distinguished however was his humanitarian policy towards convicts.<br />
Perhaps most important in the context of today's activities<br />
Macquarie firmly believed in the importance of encouraging<br />
strong local communities. He believed that towns and their<br />
amenities must take shape if life was to survive and develop in<br />
the outlying areas. With a centre in each district / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
providing a local market, justice, medicine, religion,<br />
education, and fellowship, settlement would have something<br />
to which to anchor.<br />
This continent possessed only three towns prior to the<br />
founding of the five Macquarie towns. The historical links<br />
with the past are preserved by the many buildings of the period<br />
still in existence in I : sdistrict. Windsor retains<br />
much of its old-world -7atmosphere and charm.<br />
The council has a role in contributing to the preservation<br />
of these buildings as part of the national heritage.<br />
In recognition of the place of the Windsor district in<br />
our history, I am today placing in the trust of the council<br />
for one month a national treasure which will generally<br />
be displayed in Canberra the sword and dirk of Governor<br />
Macquarie. I am especially pleased to perform this opening ceremony<br />
today because of the important role the Liberal/ National<br />
Country Party Government sees. local government playing in the<br />
delivery of services to the community.<br />
We have adopted a policy which will greatly strengthen the<br />
independence of state and local government and this policy<br />
is now being implemented.<br />
Local government around Australia is struggling to offset the<br />
impact of inflation.<br />
As inflation is progressively brought under control local<br />
government will find itself in a greatly strengthened position<br />
under the Federalism policy.<br />
Under the new policy, local government will have an annual<br />
entitlement to a share of personal income tax collected by<br />
the Commonwealth. An amount of $ 140 million will be provided<br />
in 1976/ 77 an increase of 75%~ over last year.<br />
Personal income tax will be shared between all three spheres<br />
of Government. Local government will be made a partner<br />
in the Commonwealth's reforms a fixed percentage of personal<br />
income tax will be earmarked for distribution through states<br />
to local government.<br />
The establishment of an Advisory Council for Inter-Government<br />
Relations is seen by the Government as a vital institution<br />
of co-operation and one for improving administrative arrangements<br />
between the various spheres of government.<br />
The Council will bring together representatives of the Federal, Stat<br />
and local governments and private citizens for the consideration<br />
of common problems. We will introduce appropriate legislation'<br />
to establish the Advisory Council during the current sitting of<br />
Parliament. 3 </p>
<p>We believe that each sphere of government, Commonwealth,<br />
state and local, should make decisions on matters<br />
appropriate to that sphere, with matters of proper concern to<br />
more than one level being decided through a process of<br />
genuine consultation and cooperation.<br />
There are many matters where appropriate information and<br />
the greatest opportunity for administrative efficiency and<br />
effectivenss, are at the local level. In these matters<br />
local governments must have the necessary capacity to act as they<br />
believe best.<br />
The Liberal/ National Country Party Government places great emphasis<br />
on cooperative effort by community groups. For example, in<br />
social welfare, we believe that action by individuals and<br />
groups at the local level is absolutely necessary for an<br />
effective approach to social welfare.<br />
Indeed this approach covers many activities including<br />
cultural ones. Only if community groups define their own needs<br />
without unnecessary government interference will we have<br />
the diversity, choice and quality that we all want.<br />
As local government is the level of government closest to the<br />
people, it is appropriate that cultural initiative should come<br />
from the grass roots level.<br />
Because of its goegraphical position only 60 kilometres<br />
from Sydney its rural nature and its historical associations,<br />
the Windsor Municipality has become a recreation area for<br />
the population of Sydney. It has accepted the responsibility<br />
thrust upon it by these factors.<br />
The Council is proposing in its forward programme to construct<br />
libraries, parks and playing fields and to carry out<br />
roadworks, drainage works and flood mitigation works.<br />
The excellent facilities provided by this Centre will long<br />
serve the community as a whole. The Centre will be of<br />
great benefit to the community as a forum where the arts<br />
will find a natural and beneficial focus.<br />
The various boards and programmes of the Australia Council<br />
are able to assist within funding limitations a wide<br />
range of activites to broaden the community's participation<br />
and interest in the arts, from the community to the specialist<br />
level. The Council has a special concern for the arts<br />
needs of country people and outlying regions beyond the main<br />
metropolitan areas.<br />
I wish all those concerned with the Macquarie Towns Festival<br />
very much success and I am certain it will provide great<br />
pleasure and enjoyment for the people of this community.<br />
Finally, I would like to congratulate everyone associated<br />
with this community and cultural centre, the Councillors and<br />
employees, the architects and builders everyone who has<br />
played a part in the preparations for this official opening.<br />
I have much pleasure in declaring open the Windsor Community and<br />
Cultural Centre. </p>
