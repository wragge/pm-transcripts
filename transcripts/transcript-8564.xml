TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, FREMANTLE PORT AUTHORITY, PERTH<br />
JUNE 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: What about Federal Opposition claims that the One Nationp icy safo eas<br />
of the larger deficit, you don't have the necessary money<br />
PM: Well that is just rubbish, because every dollar this Government has spent now over a<br />
decade has been accounted for. The Federal Liberal Party when they were in<br />
Government didn't even publish forward estimates. All of our Budgets are, the<br />
figuring's there, the reconciliation tables. And the One Nation spending, which has<br />
started, but in the main starts tomorrow, it starts in the new financial year, and it was<br />
never intended to be spent before the new financial year. Thiat's the. first point, the<br />
second point is, the one area where we have had a difficult negotiation is in putting<br />
together a new greenfields agreements on thejai syster. But I mean there was<br />
never one for a hundred years, so of course it had taken us a few months to do it.<br />
That is, to try and build a national rail highway, which the lazy Liberals never<br />
bothered with for most of the 40 post-war years. We expect that we will have that<br />
greenfields industrial relations agreement to build a new national rail highway, we<br />
should have that in place hopefully by the middle of July. And that will mean then<br />
that all of the One Nation spending on the national rail network, the national rail<br />
highway can begin then feeding money into a new system where we can lay new<br />
track, lift the bridges, straighten the rail lines, and give Australia the kind of rail<br />
system it should have always had.<br />
J: Prime Minister your criticism of the Hogan image overseas, you don't withdraw<br />
from that? </p>
<p>PM: No, it's not a criticism of the Hogan image, I am just saying it is just one of the<br />
images. I think people should understand what I am saying. Australia is a subtle<br />
country with lots of varying appeals for overseas visitors. That image appeals to one<br />
group of visitors, but there are other images, and I am just saying that we need to let<br />
people know about Australia, our successes, and the subtlety of Australia, and not to<br />
be just encapsulated in one image. It is certainly no criticism of the Hogan image,<br />
or its campaign which was eminently successful.<br />
J: Mr Keating, Mr Dawkins is seeking a meeting with you because he is concerned<br />
One Nation is not spending enough, quickly enough, or enough to get the economy<br />
going.<br />
PM: That is not true. The Treasurer does not have to seek meetings with me, and I don't<br />
need silly questions like that put to me by journalists, frankly. The spending is all<br />
provided for and it will go ahead but we are not pouring money into rail systems<br />
where we don't have greenfields industrial agreements in place, but the rest of the<br />
spending, the roads, the main arterial roads around the capital cities have already<br />
started, as you know the airline part of One Nation has already been enacted, that is,<br />
a new airline system for Australia, Qantas flying in and the other airlines flying out.<br />
We are setting up the Commission to provide those routes in the next week or two.<br />
The payment to families was paid in April and that is already behind us. And the<br />
tax changes to depreciation, and all of those things are already enacted. So a lot of<br />
the One Nation policy is in place, but while they are difficult nuts to crack, with a<br />
new industrial relations framework for a new rail highway, and of course it is<br />
difficult to crack, it has been laying there with different gauge systems for a hundred<br />
years. I mean the Liberal Party which governed Australia for most of the post-war<br />
year were just happy to leave it lay as an industrial museum which we have had<br />
to bring back to a modern rail system.<br />
J: If you can't get that agreement will you reallocate that railway money?<br />
PM: If we don't get the agreement of course we would reallocate the funds to road or<br />
something else but I am pretty confident the agreement is coming through. Can I<br />
just say while we are talking about packages that yesterday the Anglican Church<br />
came out and attacked Dr Hewson spiteful policy of knocking people off<br />
unemployment benefits after nine months and sending them down to voluntary<br />
agencies. And I noticed Mr Gerard Menzies, of the Anglican Church, said it was an<br />
abuse, that was the word he used, an abuse of the voluntary agencies for Dr Hewson<br />
to offer them a paltry $ 50 million, and then load upon them the unemployed after<br />
nine months, hundreds and thousands of people and their families on a system that<br />
couldn't possibly cope with it. And as Mr Menzies himself made clear the Anglican<br />
Church already spends $ 100 million in its own right, let alone the Catholic Church<br />
and the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Salvation Army, to add $ 50 million is<br />
an insult, but I agree it is an abuse of the voluntary agencies to turn people off<br />
benefits after nine months and say well you are on your own, go down there and see </p>
<p>the Anglican and Catholic church if they can help you good on them, if they can't<br />
too bad, you lay in the street, or look after yourself, or go to your extended family,<br />
or do what they do in the United States: huddle over railway grates to keep warm, or<br />
lie under cartons of a night. This is the sort of world that John Hewson wants to<br />
build. These are the spiteful policies he has championed and the Anglican Church<br />
has thrown it right back at him saying that the views of the Federal Director of the<br />
liberal Party, Mr Robb, and articulating Dr Hewsons Fightback package is an abuse<br />
of the work which is voluntary carried out by the voluntary agencies.<br />
J: It has been reported that Senator Button wants the measures in One Nation fast<br />
tracked, do you agree?<br />
PM: Well look, we are going to fast track all we can, the main thing is most of the<br />
spending is to be spent in the financial year 92-93, if you read the document that is<br />
what you will find, 92-93 starts tomorrow, and will be spent over the 12 months<br />
from tomorrow. It was never intended to be spent between February and July, only<br />
a part of it and the parts that will be spent this financial year, I believe, we'll spend,<br />
we'll spend the $ 1.8 billion we said we'll spend over the course of the financial year.<br />
J: Given the Budget deficit situation is there any extra money around for more<br />
targeting coming up to the Budget?<br />
PM: Well they are all just Budget matters to be considered.<br />
J: Is there any extra money though?<br />
PM: Well to be considered, that's what a Budget Cabinet is for, to sit down look at<br />
priorities, look at policy.<br />
J: Mr Keating just getting back to your comments about Australia's image overseas,<br />
what sort of image would you like to see the country portraying to overseas visitors?<br />
PM: Well I would like to see it first of all as a place with interesting tourist destinations,<br />
but a country which has got a unique identity and culture. That has flourishing arts,<br />
that excels in dance, and theatre, that has a developed society, a country with a good<br />
education system, a country that has made much provision for women, and<br />
advanced the cause of women. I mean this is a place that I think many Americans<br />
for instance, the Japanese people, would find aspects of Australia most interesting.<br />
But I think it is a multifaceted country, and the multi-faces of Australia need to be<br />
shown to the rest of the world, not just one face.<br />
J: Are you critical of that so-called Yobbo image?<br />
PM: I am not critical of it, it just needs to be complemented by the other images which<br />
we all know exist. </p>
<p>J: Mr Prescott, the head of BHP, said the $ 2.3 billion in One Nation wasn't enough to<br />
get the economy moving, it is far more sluggish then forecast and he actually<br />
suggested that there was room for another $ 2 billion, do you agree?<br />
PM: Well that's a view. At the time I think Mr Prescott thought, and so did Mr Bailey<br />
and others that $ 2 billion was about the ticket and we spent $ 2.3 billion, but a great<br />
bulk of that spending is yet to happen as it was planned to happen in 92-93 and we<br />
will make a judgement about that as we go through the Budget processes. But one<br />
thing is clear the economy is going to grow reasonably strongly over the course of<br />
92-93 it may not grow uniformly across Australia but there is a patchiness about it,<br />
but overall it is going to grow quite strongly through 92-93. The issue is how<br />
quickly will employment respond to that growth, in other words will productivity<br />
depress the growth and employment as growth in the economy proceeds, well that is<br />
a matter for judgement and we will make judgements about that in the course of the<br />
Budget.<br />
J: So it is becoming more efficient as a two-edged sword as you see it?<br />
PM: Of course it is, productivity growth means a given level of output from fewer<br />
people, that just simply means you have got to have more output, that means the<br />
economy has got to grow faster and the only policy framework which allows the<br />
economy to grow faster is the accord structure between the trade unions and the<br />
Government. Under the Liberals policy the start would grow faster and when<br />
inflation and wages started to grow they would just simply raise interest rates.<br />
J: So do you stand by your employment growth figures in One Nation? By stating this<br />
concern do you think there is some question mark about the<br />
PM: Well employment has been slower, there is no doubt about that. But the growth will<br />
still be pretty much as we forecast.<br />
