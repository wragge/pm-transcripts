PRL. -INISTR'S TOUR OF SOUTH-EAST ASIA<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
at Government Hodse Dinner in Bangkok, Thailand 26TH APRIL, 1966<br />
Your Royal Highness, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I thank you, Prime K inister, for your kind expression<br />
of welcome tonight and I thank your Government and people for the<br />
warmth and hospitality which I and my party have enjoyed since our<br />
arrival. It was my great privilege to have an audience with His<br />
Majesty this afternoon.<br />
I am delighted to pay this official visit to your<br />
country so soon after your own visit to Australia on which you<br />
were accompanied by senior 1.1inisters of your Government.<br />
Your visit to Australia was a source of great satisfaction<br />
and encouragement to my Government.<br />
Although this is my first visit as Prime 1. inister, I<br />
have visited Thailand on previous occasions and on each occasion<br />
I have had the pleasure if I may use the words you have<br />
employed of observing at close range the way of life and tiinking<br />
of the Thai people.<br />
Your way of life is indeed peaceful and freedom-loving,<br />
in keeping with the beautiful environment of your country.<br />
A visitor like myself sees something of your rich<br />
cultural heritage in the beauty of form and colour of your<br />
traditional building and works of art and handicrafts.<br />
This heritage, there can be no doubt, lives in the<br />
hearts of your people.<br />
You have referred, Prime Minister, to the positive role<br />
of Australia in this region.<br />
VIe in Australia have come to expect from Thailand a<br />
beneficial and deeply-informed contribution to regional affairs.<br />
Your country, with its long history of sovereign<br />
independence and its deep-rooted national life, has surely a<br />
most significant part to play in the future.<br />
Australia's origins and traditions arc very different<br />
fron your own. le have no cor'parable background of long participation<br />
in the affairs of South-East Asia.<br />
Our two countries, however, work closuly together in<br />
fruitful association. The friendship and close co-operation which Thailand<br />
extends to us greatly enhances our feeling that we have a<br />
constructive part to play in the region as a whole. </p>
<p>As modern Governments we share the same goals of bringing<br />
to our pcoples the fruits of prosperity and national development.<br />
Our two countries both take a comprehensive view of the<br />
problems of the region.<br />
* 4e look outwa. rds towards regional co-operation and the<br />
sharing of skills and technology.<br />
Australia and Thailand recognize that the security of<br />
the region is vital to the stability and progress to which we are<br />
dedicated. Our two countries arc fully conscious of the critical<br />
nature of the struggle now being waged to ensure the freedom and<br />
independence of' the region.<br />
, iec share the same conviction that through our own efforts<br />
and in partnership with the effort of others this historic struggle<br />
can be won. May I now invite all of you to join me in a toast to the<br />
good health and happiness of His Excellency tV. i Prime Minister of<br />
Thailand, tfo-the continued advancement of Thailand, and to the<br />
further strengthening of the close relations oar two countries<br />
now enjoy. </p>
