FOR PRESSFEBRUARY 17, 1976<br />
NATIONAL CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION STAFF<br />
On 9th February eight days ago in announcing staff ceilings<br />
to apply at 30th June, I stated that departments and authorities<br />
were expected to reach their revised staff ceilings by<br />
processes of natural wastage, such as retirements and resignation.<br />
Minister3 and the Public Service Board were asked to keep me<br />
informed as to any difficulty encountered in achieving the<br />
ceilings b% 30th June.<br />
I am informed that the National Capital Development Commission<br />
has today taken retrenchment action with respect to 21 members<br />
of its staff. This is not in accordance with our policy.<br />
However, it may be that the National Capital Development Commission,<br />
irrespective of the Government's staff ceiling requirements,<br />
considers these people are surplus to establishment.<br />
Therefore I have asked the Minister for the Capital Territory,<br />
the Minister for Employment and Indu trial Relation3, together<br />
withI Lit-h U1 ii-Se, 7r vic-.: Boa rd to hav2 s: -4" rNz i r zrie at . naI<br />
