MENZIES FOREST IN ISRAEL GALA CONCERT<br />
CANBERRA THEATRE, CANBERRA 23RD OCTOBER, 1965<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Sir, Your Excellencies and Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
I don't need to tell you that this is a remarkable<br />
honour for both my wife and myself, the kind of thing we would<br />
have never thought of, once, the kind of thing that we shall<br />
never forget now that it has happened.<br />
The evening has been, as you haven't failed to<br />
notice, rather cunningly arranged. For the first half of the<br />
programme we were taken to Heaven by iir. Kentner, and then you<br />
descend to earth and you listen to three gentlemen three men,<br />
anyhow ( Laughter) two of whom are politicians four men,<br />
one of whom is an ambassador who, of-course, by definition is<br />
a respectable man, and the other my old friend, Mr. Ungar.<br />
But be of good cheer, when the speeches are over, you will be<br />
taken back to Heaven by Mr. Kentner. ( Laughter, applause)<br />
I must say that I love the idea of the forest.<br />
It is a very happy association between Israel and Australia<br />
because a forest has beauty, it has usefulnessi it has endurance,<br />
and above all things, it expresses a spirit of continuity which<br />
to me is the most important thing in the world. A forest.<br />
You know, it is a curious coincidence that my<br />
old friend, 3aron Snider, who has been a friend of mine for<br />
many years in spite of the fact which now appears he used to<br />
listen to me at political meetings it is a very happy coincidence<br />
that he should have quotedoIalter Scott because, strangely<br />
enough, I propose to quote him twice tonight.<br />
The first thing I want to quote is a tag that all<br />
of ys~ u will remember from your schooldays from " The Heart of<br />
Mid-Lothian" " Jock, when ye hae naethin' else to do ye may<br />
be aye stickin' ma tree. It ' 11 be growin', Jock, while youtre<br />
slee'pin'". I read that I learned that when I was a child, and<br />
I have never forgotten it.<br />
And it happens, Sir, that people with my name<br />
have another interest in forests, because the people of my<br />
clan I don't claim that there are not a few bar sinisters in<br />
( drowned by laughter) I am willing to accept that out<br />
oThand. But the heads of the clan, in the great days of the<br />
Mingies clan because that is the right way to pronounce it<br />
they were great foresters. They planted forests all over the<br />
Lenzies country, right up to the ald Caledonian forest. One<br />
of them introduced he larch into Scotland, and by very good<br />
judgment when in Coronation year I went up to Scotland to what<br />
was once the country of my clan, alas no longer, because they<br />
fell into litigation and waed it on lawyers ( Laughter) but<br />
I went up to open a power station on the Gaur just near the<br />
Road to the Isles on the fringes of the old Caledonian forest<br />
and the souvenir they presented me with was so appropriate two<br />
or three seedlings from the old Caledonian forest and one of<br />
them at least grows amain in the Lodge gardens today. And when<br />
I get around to it I must have a little notice put alongside it<br />
so that those who live there in the future will see that the<br />
element of continuity survives. This is from one of the old<br />
forests of one of the old -tountries of the world. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
And therefore the idea of the forest is something<br />
that strikes deeply into the heart and mind of both my wife<br />
and myself as it will into the hearts and minds of my family.<br />
The Jewish Xational Fund which has been referred<br />
to, and with which there may be some here who are not familiar,<br />
has been operating, I think I am right in saying, for over<br />
sixty years sixy-two years and in that time it has raised<br />
vast sums of money for the express purpose of taking a country<br />
the old Palestine arid, eroued by wind and weather, not very<br />
fertile full of history but not full of water they have set<br />
out to 6uild it, almost physically to build it.<br />
I remember at the very beginning of 1941 being in<br />
Palestine because even at that time, as some of the older of<br />
you may recall, I was Prime Minister ( Laughter, applause).<br />
In fact I was reminded as I came in tonight by a very celebrated<br />
newspaperman in Canberra that though he still cross-examines<br />
me, the first time he ever did was in Palestine at the beginning<br />
of 1941. And I was fascinated by what I saw even though so much<br />
more has been done since by hard work by imagination, by the<br />
completely constructive ideal of a national rebuilding. And<br />
therefore, when in due course Israel was established as the<br />
independent home of the Jewish people, this was something that<br />
didn't just start, as we might say, from scratch, but worked on<br />
a basis which had for a number of years been steadily created<br />
by the Jewish National Fund.<br />
Now that establishment of Israel as an independent<br />
State was swiftly acknowledged, of course, and s pported by<br />
Australia, but it had a worId significance, a world significance<br />
that we do well to reoall. And here I come for the second time<br />
to ;, alter Scott, because this is one of the little verses that<br />
you find in " Ivanhoe" " When Israel of the Lord beloved<br />
Out of the land of bondage came,<br />
Her father's God befo&gt; her moved<br />
An awful Guide in smoke and flame."<br />
of the house of bondage..." for the second conspicuous<br />
time in history, end the earlier time was long long centuries<br />
ago for the second conspicuous time, the Jewish people, oh<br />
many many scores of millions of them came up out of the house<br />
of bondage. They didn't all go to Israel. They couldn't all<br />
go to Israel. But the establishment of Israel as an independent<br />
tate wis a gesture not only on the part of those who creatod<br />
it, but on t e part of the world, that there had come up out of<br />
the house of bondage the disabilities and persecutions of<br />
centuries that culminated in Hitler's Germany, and are not quite<br />
extinct I regret to say, elsewhere those aisabilities and<br />
ersecutions were in a symbolic way, brought to an end, and<br />
pence the State of Israel.<br />
The civilised world, I. like to think, saw in the<br />
establishment of that State that State in which this great<br />
forest will grov, not only the providing of an independent home<br />
for many Jewish people but also a shining symbol of delivery from<br />
bondage, of relief from persecution, and I believe, I am sure it<br />
is true, a shining symbol of world repentance, long delayed but<br />
never too late. But havin, said that Sir and w-ithout desiring<br />
to keep you here too long I would like to say something agout<br />
the 70,000 Jews in Australia about them to them. AHd not<br />
just as 70000 Jews in Australia but as 76,000 Jews of Australia,<br />
because this is really the burthen of my song. / 3 </p>
