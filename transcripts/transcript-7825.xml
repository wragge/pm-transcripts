SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
NATIONAL FARMERS FEDERATION<br />
NATIONAL BI-ANNUAL CONFERENCE<br />
CANBERRA 22 NOVEMBER 1989<br />
Last July, in Wentworth, New South Wales, I had the pleasure<br />
of participating in an event unique in Australia's recent<br />
history. As part of the launch of my Government's Environment<br />
Statement I was able to stand with your Secretary<br />
Rick Farley and Phillip Toyne of the Australian Conservation<br />
Foundation and praise them for working together to help the<br />
Government create a new program of soil conservation.<br />
I said at the time that it was a remarkable alliance.<br />
A few years ago an association of environmentalists, farmers<br />
and a Labor Government would not have been seen as the most<br />
natural or effective of partnerships.<br />
But we have good reason to be pleased with the results of<br />
our cooperation in this instance: we have created a $ 320<br />
million package of measures to apply over the Year and<br />
Decade of Landcare, protecting and rehabilitating as never<br />
before the fundamental ingredient both of our natural<br />
environment and of our agricultural prosperity our soil.<br />
Indeed, the story the Labor Government has to tell about our<br />
achievements for the rural community covers every crucial<br />
aspect of the production cycle from soil conservation,<br />
through the farm gate to reforms in the vital infrastructure<br />
of transport and the waterfront, through to the consumer in<br />
Australia and, of critical importance, to the consumer<br />
abroad.<br />
The hundreds of thousands of men and women directly<br />
represented by the NFF contribute vitally to Australia's<br />
economic life. All Australians depend on our primary<br />
producers, not just to provide the staples of our diet but<br />
also, through your massive contribution to Australia's<br />
export earnings, to underpin the very prosperity of our<br />
nation. </p>
<p>Quite simply, without an efficient and productive farm<br />
sector, oriented to competition in the markets of the world,<br />
Australians would be incapable of enjoying any sort of<br />
prosperity.<br />
But a good harvest or wool clip is not, by itself, a<br />
guarantee of a good cheque.<br />
If our soil is degraded, if our rail network is inefficient,<br />
if our waterfront is clogged, if our marketing authorities<br />
are operating poorly, if our price signals are not being<br />
transmitted clearly, if access to markets overseas is<br />
blocked, then the prosperity of individual producers, and of<br />
the nation as a whole, is damaged.<br />
I know the NFF understands the importance of micro reform.<br />
We have achieved more in this area than any other Government<br />
in Australia's history. That is not a bold assertion; it is<br />
a fact.<br />
And we have brought Australians With us, in a spirit of<br />
co-operation the only workable way forward.<br />
When we came to office in 1983, Australia still hid behind<br />
defensive walls; it was inward looking and massively<br />
over-regulated.<br />
Conservative governments, which I remind you had ruled this<br />
country for 30 of the 33 years before we came to office, had<br />
made it virtually impossible through high tariff barriers<br />
for many foreign goods to compete on Australian markets so<br />
when we tried to compete against foreign goods overseas, we<br />
found we were hamstrung by our own bad habits of<br />
inefficiency and complacency.<br />
This Government has provided the leadership and the strategy<br />
to make Australia more outward-looking and competitive.<br />
Let me repeat that, with different words: the turnaround<br />
didn't happen by chance. It hadn't happened under virtually<br />
three decades of conservative rule in fact progress had<br />
been actively stymied.<br />
It was only when this Government came to office that<br />
Australia at last began to get it right.<br />
So today I want to spell out -bluntly, so the record is not<br />
blurred and cannot be ignored -just what progress we have<br />
made. And when, later on today, I launch the Garnaut Report on<br />
Australia and Northeast Asia, you will see demonstrated<br />
again our capacity, our energy and our determination for<br />
further progress down the road to micro-reform. </p>
<p>When we came to office, a precondition for change was a._<br />
responsive financial sector. Our first priorities were to<br />
float the dollar, relax exchange controls, free up the banks<br />
and allow new bank entrants.<br />
These reforms brought substantial benefits a more<br />
responsive exchange rate; freedom for Australians to invest<br />
overseas, and gain access to overseas ideas and markets; and<br />
new forms of and readier access to financing.<br />
And radical change in one area encourages change in others.<br />
So we also began lowering protection for motor vehicles and<br />
textiles, clothing and footwear protection that had been<br />
built up by the conservatives.<br />
Other important early micro reform decisions involved<br />
deregulating foreign investment and abolishing State<br />
purchasing preferences thereby eliminating the waste of<br />
building factories in each State to benefit from local<br />
preference arrangements.<br />
Work in other areas advanced to the point where, in the 1987<br />
election campaign at Ballarat, I made some very clear<br />
commitments to pursue micro-economic reform during our third<br />
term. My Government placed that issue firmly at the top of the<br />
political agenda. It had never before occupied that prime<br />
position. We didn't do it to buy votes or to placate sectional<br />
interests. We did it for that oft-cited but rarely fulfilled reason,<br />
the national interest.<br />
And our success, in just over two years, has been without<br />
precedent in this country.<br />
When have the conservatives ever tackled tariff reform?<br />
In 1988 we announced the reduction of most tariffs to 10 or<br />
per cent over four years. We abolished the general<br />
revenue duty of 2 per cent at a cost of $ 240 million. We<br />
removed tariff quotas on motor vehicles and cut tariffs from<br />
57.5 per cent to 35 per cent. Textiles, clothing and<br />
footwear will have tariff-only protection by 1995.<br />
These measures cut costs to farmers. They enhance our<br />
credibility in international trade forums. They send the<br />
right signals at home and abroad.<br />
Our tax reforms have been historic. The top personal tax<br />
rate down from 60 per cent to 47 per cent; the company tax<br />
rate down from 49 per cent to 39 per cent; dividend<br />
imputation; and a significant widening of the tax base to<br />
help remove distortions in the tax system. </p>
<p>Such reforms clearly improve economic efficiency. They.<br />
benef it all Australians.<br />
Look at coastal shipping.<br />
We are on about practical, deliberate change. We considered<br />
the options up to and including the abolition of cabotage.<br />
We decided on change that is reducing industry costs,<br />
broadening the system for entry of foreign flag vessels in<br />
particular circumstances, and encouraging the replacement of<br />
the ageing Australian fleet.<br />
So far more than one-third of the coastal fleet have had<br />
their crews reduced by agreement.<br />
The average crew size of an Australian vessel when we came<br />
to office was 33. It will be 21 by the middle of 1992 and<br />
let me emphasise this will be down to the OECD average.<br />
The industry has started to make major investments again in<br />
new tonnage. They are building larger and more specialised<br />
vessels. Firms such as BHP are now successfully employing large<br />
Australian-manned bulk carriers around the coast and<br />
overseas. And the Prices Surveillance Authority is reviewing the<br />
industry to ensure cost savings are passed on.'<br />
Could the Liberals and Nationals have done it? All they<br />
would have achieved is closing down the waterfront.<br />
So let us look at the waterfront.<br />
Only last year the solution according to the NFF, and all.<br />
other commentators, was enterprise employment get rid of<br />
the pooling system.<br />
We have achieved agreement to do just that. It was supposed<br />
to be impossible we showed it wasn't.<br />
It will shake this industry to its core, and that is good.<br />
But ~ because it was achieved without a public brawl, and<br />
because it isn't in place over a couple of weeks or months,<br />
it's now said to be not enough.<br />
We also plan a major phased redundancy and early retirement<br />
program that will ensure a 30 per cent increase in<br />
productivity; a younger waterside workforce; award<br />
restructuring; and a career structure and training program<br />
for workers and management.<br />
What does the Opposition offer? In addition to company<br />
employment their plan is to allow shippers to set up their<br />
own stevedoring operations and to sweep away some<br />
unspecified regulations. </p>
<p>Well, shippers can offer their own stevedoring services<br />
right now.<br />
And if you want to abolish ports regulation, you have to<br />
tell that to States. We already have.<br />
We are implementing change, responsibly. The alternativeglib<br />
promises, in an industry noted for the intractable<br />
nature of its problems is no credible alternative at all.<br />
We have produced the most significant reform in the wheat<br />
industry since the establishment of the Wheat Board.<br />
We established a Royal Commission into Grain Storage,<br />
Handling and Transport. It suggested ways to save farmers<br />
up to $ 10 per tonne.<br />
We acted, in our area of responsibility. The savings are<br />
being achieved now.<br />
Then we legislated to override restrictive State<br />
legislation. Would the Coalition's adherence to States'<br />
rights have stood this test?<br />
We are ending the two airline agreement.<br />
We opted for full deregulation, a more radical step than any<br />
proposed in the report we had commissioned.<br />
Could the conservatives have done this?<br />
One of their last acts in Government was to bind themselves<br />
and us into the protectionist trap of the two airline<br />
agreement until 1990.<br />
The completion of an all-weather national highway, 16,000<br />
kilometres around this country: it's done. And while we're<br />
on roads, what of the inter-state road transport<br />
regulations, more uniform conditions and more efficient load<br />
limits for trucks?<br />
Let's move on to air freight. The protection Qantas used to<br />
receive in this area was astounding. Regulations introduced<br />
by previous Coalition governments allowed it simply to take<br />
over the cargo of a charter competitor. This, and all other<br />
constraints to competition from charters, have now been<br />
virtually swept away.<br />
Similar deregulation has occurred in-air passenger charter<br />
policy.<br />
And now we're examining the scope to designate a second<br />
Australian airline to carry freight internationally.<br />
We deregulated crude oil marketing. Existing small<br />
producers were given special assistance more evidence of<br />
pragmatic change but the red tape accumulated over a<br />
quarter of a century was consigned to the shredder. </p>
<p>From January 1988 refiners and crude oil producers are able<br />
to negotiate freely the quantities and prices of crude oil<br />
they buy and sell.<br />
We have also, with the Business Council of Australia,<br />
developed a novel scheme for review of business regulation.<br />
You nominate the regulation, in a serious-fashion we<br />
review it. The Structural Adjustment Committee of Cabinet<br />
has a standing item on its agenda for just this purpose.<br />
Rail freight: we have been successful in substantially<br />
reducing Australian National's call on the taxpayer.<br />
Freight operations are now run profitably.<br />
Moving this expertise from the Federal to the State sphere<br />
is next.<br />
We have developed a proposal with the States for a national<br />
rail freight organisation. Should the States agree, this<br />
will see a central management body dedicated to the swift<br />
and reliable carriage of inter-state freight.<br />
In telecommunications, we announced a major reform package<br />
less than 18 months ago that provides for effective<br />
competition in customer premises equipment, in value-added<br />
services, and in maintenance and installation.<br />
This has already spawned a whole new industry the best<br />
proof that our changes were real and deliverable. They show<br />
Telecom, too, and its employees, that competition will not<br />
bring the system crashing down.<br />
This demonstration effect is vital for the further changes<br />
we will consider. Cellular mobile phones is an area under<br />
review by AUSTEL.<br />
Telecom's ability to influence the regulation of its<br />
competitors by setting standards has also been removed to an<br />
independent body.<br />
We have reformed Government Business Enterprises. Over<br />
longstanding controls have been removed, including their<br />
right to-enter contracts withmt-Ministerial-approval,<br />
exemption from processes under the Public Works Act, their<br />
ability to invest surplus moneys and enter contracts without<br />
Government approval.<br />
Simple things, but important. They stayed in place for<br />
nearly 30 years of conservative rule.<br />
Finally, I turn to labour market reform.<br />
Change is not easy, particularly when employers are<br />
confronted with a multitude of unions and awards that often<br />
bear little relationship to the needs of individual<br />
enterprises. </p>
<p>The Industrial Relations Commission has made it clear that<br />
award restructuring processes can themselves be used as a<br />
vehicle for reforming award and union coverage.<br />
Looking beyond that, we are moving away from inter-industry<br />
or occupational awards and fragmented, craft based unions to<br />
arrangements which better reflect the needs of individual<br />
industries and enterprises.<br />
Wage negotiations must have an increasing enterprise focus<br />
but this process must be underpinned by the Accord to ensure<br />
effective aggregate wage outcomes.<br />
The NFF opposes the centralised wage fixing system, a system<br />
that has yielded an 11 per cent reduction in real unit<br />
labour costs. The conservatives' approach to wage fixing<br />
would trigger a wage explosion, just as it did in 1982.<br />
They have learned nothing. I fear the NFF may not have<br />
either. Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Our record of micro achievement is impressive by any<br />
standard, and, I repeat, unprecedented in this country's<br />
peace-time history. Does anyone here suggest anything<br />
remotely comparable in those 30 conservative years? But let<br />
me assure you there is much more to come.<br />
We have an ambitious and comprehensive agenda for future<br />
reform. Clear evidence of this'is provided by the new inquiry<br />
program for the restructured and broadened Industries<br />
Assistance Commission, now the Industry Commission.<br />
The Commission's work program includes references on<br />
critical infrastructure services: railways, energy<br />
generation and distribution, statutory marketing<br />
arrangements, and raw material pricing for domestic users.<br />
Unlike the Coalition, we will act against the States if<br />
reform in their areas is too slow, as we have done in wheat<br />
transport and handling.<br />
What do the conservatives these Johnny-and-Andrewcome-<br />
latelies say now about our micro-economic reform<br />
achievements? That we made-the easy changes-first? They never-found them<br />
so easy when they were in office.<br />
That we aren't moving fast enough? They at least recognise<br />
that we are moving in the right direction after decades of<br />
Coalition inertia. </p>
<p>That we are protecting our friends in the unions? Well. L.<br />
know a bit about trade unions, and let me tell you, we're<br />
shifting and shaking trade unionism like it has never been<br />
shaken before. Their inefficiencies and cosy deals have to<br />
go just like anyone else's. And they are.<br />
And may I say, much of Australia's management has a good<br />
deal to learn from the preparedness of the trade union<br />
movement to face up to and accept change.<br />
But if protecting trade unions means talking to them,<br />
cooperating with them, winning the best from them, making<br />
sure they come along with change rather than dig their heels<br />
in if that's protection, then I'll happily plead guilty.<br />
Because in achieving micro-reform, the negotiated way is the<br />
only way.<br />
The bull in the china shop approach only produces broken<br />
china. And let me tell you, when it comes to micro-reform,<br />
the conservatives are full of bull.<br />
Micro reform requires leadership, guts, creative ideas, and<br />
a capacity to consult. The Coalition possesses none of<br />
these. Can anyone seriously imagine the Coalition achieving<br />
anything on the waterfront other than industrial chaos?<br />
They couldn't stand up to the Australian Federation of Air<br />
Pilots so how long could they last on the waterfront?<br />
On wheat deregulation, on national companies legislation,<br />
award restructuring, they either stuck their head in the<br />
sand, or they whinged to try and win votes.<br />
They certainly didn't do anything to show they are fit for<br />
the task.<br />
Now I know this has been a detailed exposition but John,<br />
let me gently suggest you brought it upon yourself by your<br />
suggestion that we've moved too slowly.<br />
And in your analysis of the pace of reform, John, you allege<br />
that the Labor Party badly mishandled the last referendum on<br />
a four-year term. No mention that the Coalition'ss<br />
opportunistic opposition to all four questions contributed<br />
to the demise of the four-year term. And conveniently-no<br />
mention of the NFF's opposition to all four questions. The<br />
audacity of your criticism, frankly, is staggering..<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I am aware that some of your members have gathered a<br />
petition on interest rates that is being presented today to<br />
the Opposition. The week's newspapers have been full of<br />
comment from various business organisations on Australia's.<br />
debt levels. </p>
<p>This rekindling of the public debate on the macro-economy is<br />
welcome. I have believed all along that informed public<br />
debate can only be helpful in formulating acceptable<br />
solutions to the very real economic challenges we face.<br />
I certainly don't want, in this forum, to underestimate the<br />
very real problems that many farmers are experiencing as a<br />
result of current levels of interest rates.<br />
But I do think it important that the reasons for the<br />
Government's macroeconomic policy settings be fully<br />
understood. It is nonsense to assert, as some commentators insist on<br />
doing, that we are relying solely on monetary policy on<br />
high interest rates to correct the nation's economic<br />
difficulties. Fiscal policy is unprecedentedly tight. With the 1989-90<br />
Budget, outlays are projected to fall for the fourth<br />
consecutive year, taking them to 23.7 per cent of GDP back<br />
to the level of the early 1970s.<br />
We are continuing to repay Commonwealth debt, including<br />
foreign debt, and largely because of our budget surplus the<br />
overall net public sector contribution to savings has<br />
improved by a massive 8 per cent of GDP in the last five<br />
years, or around $ 30 billion.<br />
The 11 per cent fall in real unit labour costs is testimony<br />
enough to the tightness of wages policy.<br />
But quite large increases in interest rates have been<br />
necessary to complement the Government's fiscal and wages<br />
policies in dampening domestic demand.<br />
Monetary policy would have been even tighter but for our<br />
achievements on fiscal and wages policy: achievements a<br />
Coalition Government have never made and could never make.<br />
Monetary policy has certainly been tighter previously:<br />
day bank bill rates reached a peak of 22 per cent in April<br />
1982, compared to just over 18 per cent now.<br />
If the Government relaxed monetary policy prematurely the<br />
wellbeing of the farming community, together with that of<br />
all other Australians, would be devastated. The dollar<br />
would plummet. No bad thing, you would say. But that would<br />
happen only at the expense of skyrocketing inflation,<br />
interest rates going through the roof and a collapsing<br />
economy. The conservatives have no alternative economic policy<br />
because there is. no alternative policy. When we are<br />
convinced that demand is moderating we will allow interest<br />
rates to fall, but not before. To do so now would be<br />
irresponsible and certainly ruin the very farmers you are<br />
trying to protect. </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen<br />
We are engaged in a sweeping transformation of the<br />
inefficient practices and institutions that have<br />
traditionally served farmers poorly, and retarded the<br />
nation' s progress.<br />
But the benefits of our reform program cannot be fully<br />
realised if efficiently produced Australian goods can't win<br />
access to foreign markets.<br />
That is why we have taken such a high profile<br />
internationally to reduce and remove the barriers to trade<br />
behind which farmers overseas in Europe, Japan and the US<br />
have sheltered for so long.<br />
Of course, the previous Government preached free trade toobut<br />
the world was less than impressed by that posturing<br />
because it was not supported by any liberalisation of<br />
Australia's own protectionist practices.<br />
You can't be a global free trader and a domestic<br />
protectionist you get called a hypocrite.<br />
This Government has determinedly pursued both domestic and<br />
international trade reform.<br />
We have given credibility to our international campaign for<br />
trade liberalisation by making substantial cuts in domestic<br />
protection while our domestic campaign to internationalise<br />
the economy has been strengthened by our efforts abroad to<br />
secure market access for efficient Australian producers.<br />
That's why, I comment in passing, we combined the Foreign<br />
Affairs and Trade functions of Government in one department.<br />
The National Party leader, Charles Blunt, is talking about<br />
splitting the department again because as he put it " Trade<br />
and Resources and related e xport portfolios have been the<br />
National Party's primary interest".<br />
Of course, the very problems that, as I have described<br />
today, this Government is tackling were caused by the policy<br />
distortions the Nationals brought to the Trade portfolio.<br />
With such foolish and regressive comments, Charles Blunt<br />
shows only that, like the Bourbons, the National Party has<br />
learned nothing and forgotten nothing.<br />
The Cairns Group and Australia, are at the forefront of the<br />
Uruguay Round and the recent announcement by the US of its<br />
willingness to embark upon a dramatic reduction in<br />
protection is in many ways a testament to our success.<br />
In our bilateral dealings we are also taking the opportunity<br />
to urge our partners to remove or reduce trade barriers. </p>
<p>11.<br />
Last year we reached an agreement with Japan to liberalise<br />
its beef market.<br />
And we helped to convince the Americans to amend some of the<br />
more damaging measures already proposed for their 1988 Trade<br />
Bill. I take this opportunity of praising the way in which the NFF<br />
in general, and your President John Allwright in particular,<br />
has taken a higher and an effective international profile,<br />
of assistance to Government on market access issues.<br />
In this way we are working hand in hand to give a real and<br />
enduring boost to the export capacity of our primary<br />
producers. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Rural producers play an important role in broad economic<br />
restructuring, and my Government is providing, directly and<br />
through the necessary infrastructure, the family farm with<br />
the support they need and deserve. The Countrylink program,<br />
the Rural Adjustment Scheme and the Income Equalisation<br />
Scheme, and our package of rural education access programs<br />
are some of the services this Government is already<br />
providing to rural Australians.<br />
Our social justice strategy for rural Australia will be<br />
further developed in the Rural and Regional Policy Statement<br />
that I will be releasing early in. December. The Statement<br />
will announce a series of further measures modest, well<br />
targeted measures designed to improve the access to<br />
essential Government services of people living in rural and<br />
regional Australia.<br />
My Government is addressing the issues facing Australia's<br />
farmers in the most comprehensive way ever.<br />
Only by rejecting short-term, superficial solutions can we<br />
guarantee a long-term, sustainable future, a future which<br />
will be assured through a stronger economy, a better<br />
environment, and an open world market on which Australians<br />
can successfully compete.<br />
By these means, we will build the more secure and prosperous<br />
future to which we all aspire. </p>
