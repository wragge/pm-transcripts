PRIME MINISTER<br />
12 September 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ADDRESS TO THE LOWE FEDERAL ELECTORATE CONFERENCE<br />
DURWOOD, NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Paul Za~ tnmit, your We Rita, that most famous of all Italian exports to Australia, to<br />
Micha~ l Osborne, the President of the NSW Division of the Liberal Party, Bruce<br />
McCarthy, the State Member for Strathfield, many other very distinguished guests,<br />
ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Could I start by saying that I have been to many Liberal Party fundraise , rs and<br />
gatherings over the years and I dare say I've got quite a few in front of me, but I've<br />
got to say, this is one of the best organised, most diverse and most expressive of the<br />
grass roots and the cross section of the community of the Lowe electorate. I think it is<br />
one of the greatest of these sorts of gatherings that I've been to.<br />
And it's a tremendous tribute to Paul and Rita that they have been able to get this<br />
gathering together in such a spontaneous and enthusiastic way and how delighted I am<br />
that amongst the guests tonight are the young men and women fronm the local schools<br />
who will shortly be sitting for their Higher School Certificate. And, of course, I am<br />
immnensely proud that the Captain and Vice Captain of my own school, Canterbury<br />
Boys' H1igh School, are amongst those present.<br />
Canterbury has always been a remarkable schoo, Af course. But what is particularly<br />
interesting about it, I understand from Paul tha(~ y_) students number, 93% Of their<br />
number, are of a non-English speakcing background. And it is a remarkable<br />
demonstration of the diversity of that community. And when I mention that, can I say<br />
that tonight's gathering, as well as being a tremendous cross-section of the Lowe<br />
electorate, it is a very emphatic and a very heartening, and a very enthusiastic reminder<br />
to me and to all of us here tonight of the great and successfuil diversity which is post-<br />
World War Two Australia.<br />
So many different ethnic groups, so many different nations, so many different cultures,<br />
different religions are all represented here in a united and harmonious fashion. And it<br />

sends a very strong signal, a very strong signal indeed to Australia and to the friends of<br />
Australia, that almost unique amongst the nations of the world, we have been able to<br />
bring together men and women of goodwill from all around the world and to build a<br />
very united, cohesive and tolerant nation.<br />
And I know that I speak for all Australians when 1, irrespective of their background,<br />
when I say that all of us are absolutely determined to preserve the cohesion, the unity,<br />
the tolerance, the openness and the willingness to accept people of different<br />
backgrounds. We regard it as a cornerstone of what we see as being the essence of the<br />
modern Australia.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, it is now just on 18 months since that wonderfuld night on the<br />
2nd March 1996 when so many of you in this room saw the fruits of the hard work of<br />
many months, you saw that marvellous swing against the former Labor Member for<br />
Lowe, and you saw Paul Zammit installed as the Federal Liberal Member for Lowe.<br />
And it was a very exhilarating experience. It was really marvellous after 13 years in<br />
the wilderness for the Liberal Party once again to have the reins of national<br />
government in Australia.<br />
We had waited a very long time. I can tell you as somebody who waited through all of<br />
those 13 years in Opposition that it's a very, very dispiriting experience. And I have<br />
absolutely no intention of ever revisiting the experience.<br />
And I know that in saying that I speak for all of my colleagues, that we were given that<br />
mandate in March of last year to do things and over the last 18 months we have<br />
completed the first stage of implementing the mandate and the authority that we were<br />
given in March of last year. The first 18 months has been about repairing the damage.<br />
It's been about turning around a Budget deficit of $ 10.5 billion into a surplus of $ 1.6<br />
billion at the end of our first term in office.<br />
It's bee about reducing interest rates, not only for home borrowers but also for small<br />
business. It's been about implementing our family tax initiative in fuill on time, without<br />
deduction. It has been about reforming Australia's industrial relations system. It's been about<br />
pushing through the privatisation of one third of Teistra and the establishment of a $ 1<br />
billion Natural Heritage Trust which will lead to the biggest-ever capital investment in<br />
Australia's environmental regeneration this century.<br />
It has been about giving people long sought after incentives to take out private health<br />
insurance. It has been about restoring the authority of the Government to govern in<br />
the interests of all Australians and not to govern in the interests of those who pursue<br />
only narrow sectional interests.<br />
So, it's been a very exciting 18 months. But the next phase of our term in Government<br />
lies in front of us and that phase is about realising the potential of this great nation of<br />
ours as we move into the 2 1st Century<br />
And I want to share a few thoughts with you tonight about the future. We are very<br />
proud of the history of Australia. We are very proud of Australia's past and </p>

Particularly gathering in this building, we acknowledge a particular debt to those men<br />
and women who in the past have risked their lives and so many of them have lost their<br />
lives in the defence of the freedom of this nation.<br />
But in looking to the fu~ ture it is really unavoidable that one can generate a great sense<br />
of excitement and a great sense of enthusiasm about the enormous potential that this<br />
nation has.<br />
We are, to use that old cliche, extraordinarily lucky as a nation. We have the rich<br />
endowment of being in this part of the world, an inheritor of the traditions of Western<br />
civilisation. Our habits of Parliamentary democracy, our respect for the rule of law,<br />
our respect for the authority of elected governments, and incorruptible judicial system,<br />
a tolerance, a free and open press, it may annoy us on occasions but can I assure you<br />
that it is far better to have a free press that annoys you on occasions than not to have a<br />
free press at all.<br />
And it is one of the great cornerstones of the liberty of the Australian nation. So we<br />
have all of that as a great inheritance, but we're also very fortunate that we've placed<br />
by geography, cheek by jowl with the fastest growing part of the world, the Asia<br />
Pacific region.<br />
And the opportunities we have as we go into the 21 st Century of building even closer<br />
and deeper economic, political and cultural links with our region, whilst at the same<br />
time, preserving associations with other parts of the world that are so important to<br />
many Australians. that presents us with a unique and very favourable opportunity. And<br />
I believe that if we can build on those great strengths, if we can tackle those things in<br />
our community that need to be changed whilst preserving those things within our<br />
society that are worth preserving, then we can build for ourselves a greater future than<br />
even the great past that the Australian nation has had.<br />
We are a remarkably adaptive country. Australia, for example, has after the United<br />
States, the second largest appetite in the world for the Internet. We have, after the<br />
United States and Japan, the third greatest usage of mobile telephones. All of our<br />
history we have been great devourers of new technology. We have educational<br />
qualities, both at a secondary school level and also at tertiary level that are the envy of<br />
people all around the world.<br />
We have a standard of excellence in the medical profession and in areas of medical<br />
science which are also the envy of the world. I opened the new Centenary Institute for<br />
Cancer Research in Sydney earlier this week and I reminded my audience that although<br />
Australia has only 18 million people, it contributes two percent of the world's<br />
aggregate in medical research. If you think about it over the last 100 years, given the<br />
small size of our population, the Australian nation has contributed enormously and<br />
disproportionately in a very positive way to medical science around the world.<br />
We have one other great advantage as we go into the Asia Pacific region. We are seen<br />
as bringing to that region the advantages of our association with western civilisation<br />
without perhaps some of the disadvantages which are carried by other nations. We are </p>
<p>Fax from 4 11 15/ 09/ 97 13: 14 Pg: 4<br />

seen as a new society, we are seen as an open society and we are seen as a tolerant<br />
society. We do have continuing economic problems. No-one denies that. And no-one denies<br />
that the challenge of a still unacceptably high level of unemployment is one of the<br />
principles of those economic challenges.<br />
But let me say of unemployment, let us not forget that our opponents had 13 years to<br />
solve the problem of unemployment, And the average rate of unemployment during<br />
that 13 year period was precisely what it is today, and that is 8.7 percent. And that is<br />
said to remind the Australian community that those who had 13 years to fix the<br />
problem have little credibility in lecturing us after only 18 months. But having said<br />
that) my friends, reducing unemployment remains a challenge and it can only over time<br />
be reduced in two ways.<br />
We must first of all, generate a much faster rate of economic growth. And we are<br />
succeeding in doing that. Only a few weeks ago the Governor of the Reserve Bank in<br />
a speech that I've never heard a Reserve Bank Governor make before, said that the<br />
time had now been reached in Australia where you could remove the speed limits on<br />
economic growth. And he fet that the Australian economy could grow at 4 or<br />
percent a year or even faster without running into balance of payments or inflationary<br />
problem. And it's those amongst you in the audience, particularly the students here<br />
tonight who've studied economics closely will know that over the last 20 or 30 years<br />
one of the things that has bedevilled the Australian economy is that we have only been<br />
able to afford the luxury of strong economic growth for a short period of time before<br />
either inflation has taken off or we've had a balance of payments crisis and the Reserve<br />
Bank has had to contract the economy, raise interest rates, or a particularly harsh<br />
Budget in order to restrain demand has had to be introduced.<br />
Now we have in front of us the opportunity of freeing ourselves from that constraint<br />
and we are in the process of freeing ourselves from that constraint. And that is the<br />
direct result of what my Government had done over the last 18 months. If we hadn't<br />
cut spending in our first two budgets, we wouldn't have had five reductions in interest<br />
rates. If we hadn't have cut spending in our first two budgets, we wouldn't have been<br />
able to keep inflation down. If we hadn't have cut spending in our first two budgets<br />
we wouldn't now have the prospect of much stronger economic growth.<br />
And it's stronger economic growth that lays the foundation of higher levels of<br />
employment and therefore reduced unemployment in the years ahead. I know it is<br />
taking time,% I understand that. And I am sensitive to the frustration and concern of<br />
those in the community who are trying to find jobs that are being unsuccessful.<br />
But falling unemployment is always the last of the important economic indicators to<br />
come right. And I believe and my colleagues believe very strongly that the changes<br />
that we have made particularly in the labour market, the fiscal changes we've made,<br />
the budget changes, the way in which we have reduced debt in Australia, all of those<br />
things will contribute towards higher economic growth in the last half of 1997 and<br />
significantly higher economic growth in 1998. And if that occurs as we believe it wI,<br />
then unemployment will respond in a very positive way and we can look forward to an<br />
improved employment outlook into 1998. </p>

Can I also say to you ladies and gentlemen, that as well as dealing in that general<br />
economic way with the challenge of unemployment, we're also willing to take specific<br />
decisions which are designed to generate a greater sense ofjob security within the<br />
Australian community.<br />
I make no apology at all for the decision that the Government took in relation to the<br />
textile, clothing and footwear industry earlier this week. That decision was designed,<br />
my friends, to send a signal about job security, not only to the people in that industry,<br />
but also to people in other sections of Australian industry. And I want to say, to those<br />
in the community who may have criticised that decision, that when it comes to<br />
international comparisons, Australia is up there or ahead of the best, so far as trade<br />
liberalisation around the world is concerned.<br />
We have reduced tariffs, we have opened the Australian economy, we have embraced<br />
trade liberalisation in a way that most other countries have not done. There are<br />
benefits in trade liberalisation, enormous benefits. But it's also important that the pace<br />
of change be such that the Austraian community can absorb it and the Australian<br />
community can adjust to it.<br />
And when y'ou consider that not terribly long ago, the effective rates of protection in<br />
the textile, clothing and footwear industry were around 150-250 percent, that as<br />
recently as 1990 the protection for clothing and apparel was 55 percent and will be<br />
down to 25 percent by the year 2000 and 17.5 percent by the year 2005, nobody can<br />
seriously say that we haven't set a very cracking pace so far as trade iberalisation and<br />
reducing protection is concerned.<br />
So friends, as I look back over the last 18 months, I look back with a very great sense<br />
of pride. I also look back in a personal sense with a period of time in which I have the<br />
great fortune of having the sustained loyalty and support and the enthusiastic<br />
commitment not only of my Parliamentary colleagues, but also of literally thousands of<br />
supporters and members of the Liberal Party all around Australia.<br />
I've been a member of the Liberal Party now since 1958 which is quite a long time<br />
ago. And I have devoted all of my adult life and the latter part of my adolescent years<br />
working for the Liberal Party, I think I know the streets and the letterboxes of this<br />
part of Sydney about as well as anybody can know the streets and letterboxes. I have<br />
pamphleteered from Canipsie through to Enfield South to Croydon to Drummoyne to<br />
Five Dock to Abbotsford. I've spilled over into Concord and when it got particularly<br />
dark and the street lights went out, well I got into Burwood as well.<br />
My experience has been very much the experience of a grassroots campaigner. And I<br />
believe in that great injunction of the late Speaker of the American House of<br />
Representatives, Tip O'Neil, when he said that all politics was local. And if ever<br />
somebody demonstrates that he believes it, it is Paul Zammit.<br />
And keeping in touch with your local community is what makes a highly successfu~ l<br />
Member of Parliament and a highly successfuil politician. And can I say to you without<br />
any sense of exaggeration or hyperbole that there is no Member of my Federal </p>

Parliamentary Party who is a more persistent, a More effective, a more repetitious<br />
advocate of the interests of his electorate than Paul Zammcit.<br />
Woebetide the Ministerial colleague of mine who ignores an issue that affects the<br />
people of Lowe. And he has been in a short period of time, he has been a tremendous<br />
advocate for the interests of the people of Lowe. But he is representative of a new<br />
wave of men and women in the Federal Parliamentary Liberal Party. And how proud I<br />
amn that we have in our Parliamentary ranks in Canberra a record number of women<br />
Member of Parliament. And we have done it without quotas, We have done it<br />
without saying you've got to have such and such a percentage. We have done it on<br />
merit. We've done it on ability, without resorting to the patronising, divisive, imposing<br />
quotas.<br />
And can I also say to you my fiends, although it has been a good 18 months and we<br />
have achieved a great deal, that politics in Australia now is more volatile than it used<br />
to be.<br />
Australian politics is a lot less tribal than it once was. There are fewer Australians who<br />
can be regarded as permanently rusted on to the Liberal side of politics or permanently<br />
rusted on to the Labor side of politics. There are more who move around in the<br />
middle and that makes the quality of local representation more important. it makes the<br />
performance of a Government once it has been elected more important and it makes it<br />
even more important that your local representatives have an understanding of the<br />
electorates that they represent. And it's very heartening for me to look around this<br />
room tonight and know that I am looking at a group of people who are very<br />
representative of the Lowe electorate.<br />
There's a great age range, there's a range in ethnic diversity, there's a range of<br />
business and personal interests and I think that sends a very positive and a certainly<br />
very encouraging message to me.<br />
The final thing that I want to say to you ladies and gentlemen, is that the last 18<br />
months has not only been about economic, industrial relations, foreign policy and other<br />
of the issues that you more instinctively associate with things like, with politics and<br />
with political endeavour. It has also been a period of time in which we may have made<br />
some very significant advances in social policy.<br />
I am particularly proud of the fact that it was a Liberal Government which was able at<br />
long last and sadly, of course, in the wake of a great tragedy, to bring about uniform<br />
and effective national gun control legislation. And your own local member, Paul<br />
Zanmnit, played a very significant part in terms of the enthusiastic support that he gave<br />
to that measure.<br />
It's also been a period of time in which we have kept faith with our commitment to<br />
preserve the social security safety net. One of the great promises I made before the<br />
last election was that although we were determined to control the size of the budget<br />
deficit, although we were determined to pursue disciplined economic policies, we<br />
strongly supported the notion of a decent safety net for those in the community who<br />
needed reassurance and needed assistance. </p>
<p>Fax from 4 It 15/ 09/ 97 13: 14 Pg: Y<br />
SEP 15 ' 97 13: 08<br />
I am very proud that we've kept our commitments to the self-funded retirees within<br />
the Australian community.<br />
I know that when interest rates come down it's good if you're borrowing money, but<br />
it's not so good if you're living on the interest earning. I understand that and I can say<br />
to you that that is why it is very important that we keep inflation down. That is why it<br />
is very important that we have honoured the commitment we made about the tax<br />
threshold for self-funded retirees, the commitment we made about tax incentive for<br />
private health insurance. And, of course, there'll be more good news for retired people<br />
on the I1st July next year, when the I5 percent taxation rebate for savings which won't<br />
be subject to a means test or an income test, comes into operation. And that will be a<br />
benefit to all people who save within the Australian community and of particular<br />
benefit to those who are retired and living on their earnings.<br />
But ladies and gentlemen can I simply say to all of you thank yoiu for the tremendous<br />
support and understanding and forbearance and enthusiasm that you have given to my<br />
Government over the last 18 months.<br />
It is an enormous privilege to be the Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia. It is an<br />
even greater privilege to be the Prime Minister of Australia. I could not have achieved<br />
that without the understanding and support of the rank and file of the Liberal Party and<br />
the understanding and support of so many people represented by people in this room<br />
tonight, who've been prepared to give their time and their money and their resources.<br />
Can I thank the sponsors of this great occasion tonight. Can I thank those like Rick<br />
Damelian and others who've been so incredibly generous in sponsorship and financial<br />
support, not only tonight but on many other occasions in the Lowe electorate.<br />
We've only been in power for IS months. Remember we were in Opposition for 13<br />
years. And I want to remind our political opponents just how awfulI it is to be in<br />
Opposition for that long period of time. And the only way that that can be done of<br />
course, is for us to provide good and stable Government over a long period of time.<br />
I have a very good Cabinet. 1 have an outstanding Parliamentary Party. I believe there<br />
is great goodwill in the Australian comimunity towards what we are endeavouring to<br />
achieve. We have achieved much over the last 18 months, but there is a lot that lies<br />
ahead of us. And above aft, I want to see over the next 18 months and in the years<br />
beyond that, I want to see a united, tolerant, cohesive Australian nation fully realising<br />
its potential as we move into the 21 st Century.<br />
And when you think of the 2 1st Century, I particularly think of the young people in<br />
our midst and I want on behalf of everybody else here tonight to wish those young men<br />
and women, who are our guests tonight, every success as they sit for their Higher<br />
School Certificate in a few weeks time.<br />
It is one of those incredibly challenging periods in one's life and I wish all of them<br />
great success and I hope that each and every one of them not only achieves the Higher<br />
School Certificate results that they want, but they also find the careers in the </p>
<p>Fax from 4 11<br />
SEP 15 ' 97 13: 09 15/ 69/ 97 13: 14 Pg: 8<br />
professions or pursuits or occupations that they really want to experience in the years<br />
ahead.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. Thank you, Paul and Rita for organising such a<br />
wonderful occasion. Thank you Paul and Rita for being such marvellous<br />
representatives of the people of Lowe in the national Parliament.<br />
Thank you.<br />
