The Prime Ministers reaffirmed that the'economic<br />

look beyond the precise balancing of advantages in<br />
trade negotiations to ensure that the long term benefits<br />
of wide economic co-operation were not obscured.<br />

Governments would ur. dertakea comprehensive study of<br />
ways to achieve more effectively the fundamental objective<br />
of economic co-operation and of making the best possible<br />
use of the resources of the two countries.<br />

had been made in reaching solutions to problems in the<br />
sale of clothes driers and carpets to Australia.<br />
following M4r Crean' s recent visit to New Zealand.<br />
Although final details had yet to be worked out a position<br />
had been arrived at which could enable free trade in<br />
clothes' driers between Australia and New Zealand.<br />
On carpets an approach was being evolved under<br />
which New Zealand carpets could have access to Australia<br />
at a volume which would maintain traditional trade levels.<br />
Industries of the two countries were now being consulted,<br />
and final decisions in these areas are expected to be<br />
announced shortly by the appropriate Ministers.<br />
The two Prime Ministers welcomed the increase<br />
in Ministerial contacts that had taken place between<br />
Australia and New Zealand in the past year.<br />
They agreed that the volume of exchanges, particularly.<br />
in the * conomia area* was now such that thexre would be merit<br />
in establishing arrangements vhiai~ would enable relevant.<br />
Ministers to take an overall view of the relationship OptWeen<br />
the two countries. </p>
