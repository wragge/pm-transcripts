EMBARGO: 4.30 p. m.<br />
j6May 1974<br />
: THE CARE AND EDUCATION OF YOUNG CHILDREN<br />
During his speech today in Sydney's marginal Bennelong<br />
electorate, Mr. Whitlam announced the details of the Labor<br />
Government's new child care program.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that by 1978, half a million Australian<br />
children would have access to both pre school educational<br />
opportunities and child care. Pre school education will<br />
be free for all children. Child care will be subsidised<br />
with parents contributing to the cost according to their<br />
means. Eventually, all children, whether they be at home<br />
or in care, would benefit under the plan.<br />
The goals of this new program are:<br />
to increase the social development and<br />
learning ability of all children, regardless<br />
of income, family or ethnic background;<br />
to provide care for all children who need it,<br />
be it occasional or regular;_<br />
to increase the quality of parents' lives, in<br />
particular, the life of the working mother.<br />
This program would include not only full day care facilities<br />
and educational opportunities. It will also offer emergency<br />
and occasional care, before and after school care, holiday<br />
programs, informal play groups, toddlers' groups and babysitting<br />
pools.<br />
Each community will be involved in the development of facilities<br />
appropriate to their area.<br />
The cost of such a program will be $ 130 m. in a full year.<br />
In contrast, the previous government promised $ 5 million towards<br />
child care in 1972 but neither the Gorton nor the McMahon<br />
Government managed to spend anything. The Whitlam Government<br />
has spent $ 18 million on child care in the last six months.<br />
The Liberal-Country Party says that it really cares for the<br />
children of Australia yet it is prepared to spend in a full<br />
year less than the Whitlam Government has spent in developmental<br />
programs in the last six months.<br />
The Liberal-Country Party agrees that there are over 300,000<br />
children requiring child care and yet it says that it will<br />
reject or reduce this program, not because it isn't adequate<br />
to overcome the needs in a commuunity, but because it would<br />
cost too much. A detailed outline of the child care program<br />
is attached. </p>
<p>For these facilities to be developed in an imaginative and<br />
decentralised manner, the Australian Government will make grants<br />
through the States to Local Government and community organisations.<br />
The Australian Government will provide assistance to the<br />
communities to enable them to work out their needs and administer<br />
the facilities of their choice. Evidence and commonsense<br />
demonstrate that quality care requires the involvement of parents<br />
and the community in this program. The Australian Government<br />
program will involve families and community organisations in the<br />
control of facilities in their areas. Such a scheme will make<br />
possible the full and imaginative use of the present limited<br />
supply of professionally trained people. It will also use those<br />
skilled mothers in the community who might choose to earn a<br />
living caring for children rather than on an assembly line.<br />
Education for the care of children must involve all those people<br />
who are or could be caring for children: first and foremost the<br />
parent, both mother and father; secondly those called upon by<br />
parents as a substitute to help care for their children;<br />
thirdly, the highly trained professional, the mothercraft nurse,<br />
the pre school and primary school teacher, the social worker,<br />
psychiatrist and other professionals whose work is associated<br />
with children.<br />
A program of this sort will cost about $ 130 million in a full<br />
year.<br />
A program of this sort is needed<br />
15,000 children left unattended during the working day;<br />
365,000 children under the age of six who are children<br />
of working parents. One in every two of these children<br />
is in the care of persons absent from the home for more<br />
than eight hours per working day;<br />
one in every three of these 365,000 children is in the<br />
care of relatives, friends or neighbours. One in every<br />
ten only attend a nursery school, creche or similar<br />
institution.<br />
The Liberal-Country Party says it really cares for the children<br />
of Australia. It says it would reject or reduce a program<br />
designed to overcome the present need both for care and<br />
education of the young. It says it would cost too much. </p>
<p>DETAILED OUTLINE OF THE PROGRAM FOR THE<br />
CARE AND EDUCATION OF YOUNG CHILDREN<br />
The Labor Government has developed a new and imaginative program<br />
f or the care and education of young children. This program is<br />
now ready for implementation.<br />
The program will offer diverse and interrelated facilities in<br />
the development of which each community will be involved. The<br />
scheme will benefit half a million children by 1978.<br />
Key features:<br />
pre-school education will be free for all children whose<br />
parents choose to send them. All children, whether they<br />
are cared for in their own home or elsewhere will have<br />
access to these educational opportunities;<br />
child care will be subsidised, with parents contributing<br />
to the cost according to their means. The main thrust<br />
of the program in the first few years will be to offer<br />
financial and other assistance to the children of<br />
disadvantaged families.<br />
The Australian Government program breaks down the traditional<br />
distinctions between child care and pre school facilities. It<br />
recognises the need for educational, health and welfare<br />
components in child care; it recognises the need for these<br />
same services for children whether they be at home or in care.<br />
What matters is the total development and happiness of the child<br />
and the family. The programs now being-developed will offer<br />
genuine choices to mothers and families and will ensure that all<br />
children enter school free of the disadvantages which may follow<br />
from inadequate pre school and child care facilities.<br />
The key element in the ' new design' is flexibility. Innovation<br />
and diversity will be stimulated.<br />
This program will not only include full day care programs and<br />
education programs, it will offer emergency and occasional care,<br />
before and after school care, holiday programs, informal play<br />
groups, toddlers' groups and baby sitting pools, to mention but<br />
a few. Similar schools are already in existence in other<br />
countries. Australia lags behind the rest of the world.<br />
The program is sensibly based on a recognition of the value of<br />
much of the care already being provided within communities.<br />
At present one in every three children remains in the care of<br />
relatives, friends or in what has become to be known as family<br />
based child care. This form of care will continue to be<br />
developed and will begin to be supported by a wide range of<br />
services. The thrust of the government's contribution will be<br />
the provision of emergency facilities for sick children or children<br />
in the care of a sick mother, access to education within family day<br />
care facilities, counselling services, training opportunities for<br />
the day mother and provision of welfare and medical services. 2/ </p>
