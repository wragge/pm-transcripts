FOR PRESS: PM. NO. 26/ 1970<br />
RUMOURS ABOUIT PROPOSED INDUSTRIAL 1<br />
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
It is necessary to dispose of some of the wild stories and<br />
mistaken rumours which are circulating concerning the proposed<br />
Industrial Development Corporation.<br />
An official, detailed statement will be made at the<br />
appropriate time by the Government, and prior to that any<br />
observations on the details of the proposal can be nothing but<br />
speculation. However, there are certain matters which should be<br />
made clear. These are<br />
It is not intended that the Corporation should have the<br />
status of a bank or that any loans it negotiated would<br />
be guaranteed by the Commonwealth.<br />
It Is not intended that the Corporation should work under<br />
the jurisdiction or subject to the direction or influence of<br />
any Commonwealth Department. It would be an institution<br />
established by the Government by statute and be entirely<br />
free of any influence other than that set out in the statute<br />
creating it. It is intended that its directorate should<br />
include iion-Government persons of top business<br />
experience. It would in no way diminish capital in-flow from overseas.<br />
Its objective would be, on the exercise of a business<br />
judgement, and when an Australian enterprise desired it,<br />
to substitute fixed interest borrowing abroad for some<br />
of the overseas money at present supplied in return for a<br />
surrender of Australian equity. Any internal borrowing<br />
would be kept to an absolute minimum and would be subject<br />
to the agreement of the Reserve Bank.<br />
It would in no way conflict with the functions of the States<br />
or in any way affect their freedom in industry matters. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Its function is to tap those sources of overseas funds<br />
from which overseas companies at present borrow for<br />
investment in Australia. If it does this, and thereby helps<br />
to assure that a greater proportion of Australian<br />
development remains in Australian hands, its objectives<br />
should commend themselves to all who do not think<br />
attempts to maximise Australian ownership are<br />
positively bad.<br />
