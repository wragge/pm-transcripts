STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ XCEATING MP<br />
COMMITMENT OF AUSTRALIAN FORCES TO SOMALIA<br />
The Government has decided today to provide a lrge-scale<br />
commitment of Australian forces to the United Nations<br />
mandated Operation Restore Hope in Somalia.<br />
Tragic famine and clan warfare in Somalia have taken the<br />
lives of an estimated quarter of a million Somalia and<br />
two million more are immediately at risk of starvation.<br />
The extent and severity of the famine has been horribly<br />
compounded by the total collapse of law and order.<br />
Predatory bands of gunmen have preyed upon aid shipments<br />
for private gain in a way that the entire international<br />
community has found repugnant.<br />
In this appalling situation Australian and other<br />
international Non-Government Organisations ( MO0s) have<br />
shown great courage and compassion, struggling against<br />
frightening odds to get food and medicine to the<br />
suffering and the starving.<br />
Australians have been rightly proud of the efforts of<br />
these groups. The Australian public have privately<br />
donated an estimated $ 11 million to the relief effort in<br />
Somalia, and the Government has added S8.5 million in<br />
this calendar year.<br />
In this situation, the United Nations has tried to<br />
facilitate the delivery of aid. It created~ UNOSOM~ aG a<br />
peacekeeping operation.<br />
But UNOSOM was slow to get underway and was not<br />
structured adequately to deal with the problems it faced.<br />
Somalis continued to die.<br />
That is why we welcomed President Bush's action in<br />
Offering to provide substantial US troops to a now<br />
coalition of forces that would try to enforce the peace<br />
in Somalia, not simply keep it.<br />

<p>Operation Restore Hope is a unique operation. The<br />
United Nations has never before sanctioned intervention<br />
on such a scale in the internal affairs 6-t a memnberstate,<br />
for humanitarian purposes.<br />
It is important that Operation Restore Hope succeed, both<br />
for the people of Somalia and to show that after the Cold<br />
War, the international community can cooperate to relieve<br />
suffering. The Australian Government has decided therefore to<br />
provide an infantry battalion group of about<br />
including a r educed squadron of armoured personnel<br />
carriers ( APC&amp;) and associated administrative support.<br />
Initial elements of the battalion group will leave<br />
Australia before Christmas. The others will arrive in<br />
Somalia by about 10 January 1993.<br />
The battalion group will be provided in the timeframe<br />
required by the coalition of forces to enable it to make<br />
a worthwhile contribution to the overall operation. The<br />
estimated additional cost of sending a battalion group to<br />
Operation Restore Hope will be $ 19.5 million.<br />
ThQ battalion will be in Somalia for 17 weeks, after<br />
which it will be withdrawn.<br />
We will then expand the size of the Movement Control Unit<br />
( MCU) which we have already committed to the follow-up<br />
UNOSOM operation from 30 to 45 personnel.<br />
The contribution of about 900 personnel will be the<br />
largest commitment of Australiian ground forces Overseas<br />
in the last 20 years.<br />
With our already substantial commitment in Cambodia, this<br />
places limitations on Australia's scope to participate in<br />
further acekeeping peffort a in the near futuee Ãµ . But<br />
Australia is proud to take its place as part of this<br />
coalition to enforce and keep a just and humanitarian<br />
peace.<br />
My thoughts and those of the Government and Australian<br />
people are also with the men and women of our battalion<br />
group as they prepare for a very different January from<br />
the traditional Australian summler holiday period.<br />
We wish them every success in their task and look forward<br />
to welcoming them home safely to Australia at the end of<br />
their deployment.<br />
