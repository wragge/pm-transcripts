PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THIE PIUME MNITER, THE IION PJ. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, THE PARK ILANE HIOTIEL, SYDNEY, 13 NOVEMBER 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
J Mr Keating, do you uice with Dr Hewson's ideas about citizenship?<br />
PM: I think people needing to be here four years, broadly no I don't. I think the two<br />
year citizenship has worked well and the question about knowing about the words<br />
of the national anthem 1 thought were made well last night. These things are<br />
important, but I do thinK that most people who take citizenship In this country take<br />
it consequently and know what they are doing.<br />
J: Will the ptocess to change the Australian flagb e in place by the end of this term of<br />
Parliamnicat?<br />
PM: No, what I said was whenever any of our national emblemnis change the community<br />
should Know about it, be part of the debate and it shouldn't change without their<br />
support.<br />
J; But Isn't your Depailinent working out a process for that debatc?<br />
PM: No, I'm at least talking about it whenever I get a chance like on occasions such as<br />
this.<br />
J: So will you be taking to Cabinet a submission?<br />
PM: No.<br />
J: What would you like to scc In place by the year 2000? I li I v i v k </p>
<p>PM: As I said there by the year 2000 1 think we will see an Australian R-ead of State.<br />
That all of these constitutional issues and constitutional forms should he well<br />
debated and discussed in this country, they have been taboo subjects and they<br />
shouldn't be.<br />
J! Have you got a personal choice for the Head of State yet?<br />
PM: Well of course I don't. That is a penonally silly question.<br />
J; Mr Keating, the changes to ' One Nation' today, how will they help the people on<br />
the dole line at present?-<br />
PM: What we are ensuring to see today that all of the budgcted expenditure of the " One<br />
Nation' package is actually spent, When I announced It we did say that we will<br />
need to monitor the spending tomse that the spending does--take place. Wc have<br />
but Int sonme AreiS it is not possible to spend the monies within the financial . year<br />
we think and so therefore we are moving some of the funding into areas where<br />
there is a demonstrated capacilty to spend and where there is a greatet need and in<br />
the labour market programs is one such place.<br />
J: Is that an acknowledgmnent of failure?<br />
PM: No, you've got to understand some of this was nail money. The States of Australia<br />
left the railway systems In a dinosaur position. Now we are trying and very<br />
rapidly to pull them back Into something like a modern transportation System, but<br />
It is going to take time and some of the monies which we had ready for rail line<br />
expenditure arc now going to be first subject to survey&amp; and engineering planning<br />
that basically the State rail system just haven't donc. We presume that the State<br />
rail systems would have done basic engineering planning and survey work on rail<br />
lines and they hadn't done it. So what it means is it will still be done, the money<br />
will still be spent, but in a later year, so the systems wilt still be built just as we<br />
planned excpt that in this year where we need the money spent for nationul<br />
employment reasons we will move some of those funds into places where we can<br />
spend the money fruitfully and quickly.<br />
J: ( Inaudible)<br />
PM: No, If you are going to try and spend a couple of billion in this country within a<br />
year you've got to be careful about how you do it and if its not running as quickly<br />
in some areas you shift it to others. It'sjust a sensible business like thin&amp; to do.<br />
I. Who is responsible for the delay in your opinion specifically?<br />
PM: Delay in spending rail money?<br />
J: Well in the ' One Nation' package in total, local government, the States? </p>
<p>3<br />
PM: It Is basically the State rail systems who are trying to scramble from fifty years of<br />
obsolescence, ( hat's the problem. But that is not a problem in itself because we'll<br />
just add that money on in the out years, so the projects will be completed buat over<br />
a longer time frame, another financial year will be added to the existing<br />
construction phases and what that means is It will free up ( linds this year which<br />
can be spent where there is a lot of demand. There Is a lot of demand for the<br />
labour market programs amongst young people.<br />
How long do you think ir will take before jobs are actually being created from the<br />
moncy ainvuniced today?<br />
PM: For instance Jobstart is running very strongly as a demand driven pmgramn and<br />
requires more funding so basically that will go on from this very day. Some of the<br />
others we are trying to put the labour market programs into oroups so that we can<br />
group them for large employers so that they can take them on rather than as<br />
Individual persons for individual programs, they take them as a job lnt, that iR by<br />
their hundreds. So what we've done is cbange the nature of some of these<br />
program,; so they can be packaged up, that means that we will need to spend more<br />
money on them that's what we did last night.<br />
1: How many cxtra jobs will be created as A r* 91ult Of the extra spending?<br />
PM: It is a* matter of not just the extra jobs fromn the extra spending, but realising the<br />
Jobs that have come from the spending arc already available and as we've said that<br />
could be for young people. We have enough funding there to give 100,000. young<br />
people between fifteen and nineteen six months training and a wage subsidy at the<br />
end. % oit is a matter of whether we can get thoft programs up and we can get<br />
companies and Institutions to take them on.<br />
JAre the State~ s doinig eniough?<br />
PM: They are doing all the things we have asked of them by and large, they have<br />
dropped the ball a bit In relation to rail, but beyond that hy and large they are<br />
doing their part in road works and local government is doing mote than its padt in<br />
the Locsl Govcrnment Program which we Introduced in the Budget. In fact that is<br />
now at tile point where we can spend additional monies on it and we are spending<br />
additional mionies on it as of last night.<br />
J: Any specific Statcs?<br />
PM: No, I can't remember which ones.<br />
I. Would you ennsider releasing more funds if unemployment doesn't fall? </p>
<p>i rLi _ LI i Uv i CI'u r .4j 4/<br />

PM: This year demonstrates two things that the fiscal stimulus was the right thing to<br />
do, John H1ewson said we should cut $ 7 billion out of the Budget, we've added $ 2<br />
billion on to it and if we cut $ 7 billion out the economy would just go back Into<br />
recession. The OECD the day before yesterday urged governments to embark<br />
upon an expansionary fiscal policy and we are doing it. The key point hero is that<br />
the Opposition's policies would push Australia back into in a recession and whilo<br />
the economy isn't growing as fast as we would like it, we are on the right policy<br />
track and what we were doing last night Is fine tuning the policy we already have.<br />
J: Prime Minister what's your reaction to the 800 rail jobs going in NSW today?<br />
PM: I didn't hear about that, I've only just heard from you.<br />
J: Prime Minister, do you still believe that unemployment will be below 10 per cent<br />
by next year's Budget?<br />
PM: The forecasts for employment are very much on track with the Budget. We are<br />
probably under target on unemployment at this Stage of the year.<br />
J: Can you recite the words to the national anthem?<br />
PM: I know both verses as a matter of fact, but I'm not singing them for you. I'll write<br />
them down just give me a hit of paper and I'll write them down for you. I just had<br />
a bad chest cold, but I can assure you I learnt them after we adopted it in the 1970s<br />
and I've been singing it manfully right around the country ever since, even if all of<br />
you haven't,<br />
