THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ADDRESS TO PARTICIPANTS AT THE LONGREACH<br />
COMMUNITY MEETING TO DISCUSS THE<br />
WIK 10 POINT PLAN<br />
LONGREACH, QLD<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Well thank you very much Tim Fischer. To Larry Acton and the Mayor, Mrs<br />
Maloney, and to my fellow Australians.<br />
Can I say that I welcome very much the opportunity for the first time to talk directly<br />
and frankly and openly to a large number of my fellow Australians who I knowv are<br />
deeply concerned, deeply worried and feel that their situation has been made needlessly<br />
vulnerable by a highly impractical court decision. Can I also say to you ladies and<br />
gentlemen that although I was born in Sydney and I have lived-al[ of my life in the<br />
urban parts of Australia, I have always had an immense affection for the outback and<br />
for the bush. I say that at the outset because in all of my political life no charge I<br />
would reject more emphatically, and no charge would offend me more, than the<br />
suggestion that what I've done and what I've believed in has not taken proper account<br />
of the concerns of the Australian bush. And I want to spend, in the limited time<br />
available to me, to tell you where some of the misapprehensions are wrong, to explain<br />
to you that the plan the Federal Government has will deliver the security, and the<br />
guarantees to which the pastoralists of Australia are entitled, without at the same time<br />
producing many of the disadvantages, the instability, the expense and the years of<br />
Constitutional challenge which would result if the simplistic alternative of blanket<br />
extinguishment were adopted.<br />
Now I know there are people in this audience who don't agree with that. I respect that<br />
and I want this morning to have the opportunity to explain why I believe what we have<br />
in mind delivers the guarantees you want without the downsides. But in doing that can<br />
I again remind you as Tim did, that the present Native Title Act was the product of the<br />
combined votes of the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and<br />
Independents in the Senate. Every man and woman who was a member of the Liberal </p>

MAY 17 ' 97 13: 43 P. 8<br />
4 Party and the National Party in 1993 voted against the Native Title Act. And all of the<br />
claims, the bogus claimis, the ridiculous ambit claims that have now been put over y'our<br />
properties are the result of legislation that was opposed tooth and nail by all of my<br />
colleagues. And I want that understood because we are often accused of going back<br />
on 1993. We didn't want 1993, we voted against it. And I think it's very important<br />
that the outset that that be understood.<br />
Now ladies and gentlemen could I say a number of very direct things to the pastoralists<br />
who are here, and through this meeting to the pastoralists throughout Australia. That<br />
under our 10 point plan, no pastoral leaseholder can lose anything at all under their<br />
pastoral lease, nothing at all. I've had people say to me over the past few weeks that<br />
they are frightened that as a result of native title claims that they can be thrown off<br />
their property. I see signs here saying that people bought their land, of course they<br />
bought their land. Can I say to you, you can't lose your land, and people who are<br />
quoted around this country saying that native title claimants could have you thrown off<br />
your land, could have you dispossessed, could take away from you what you have paid<br />
for, that is absolutely 100% wrong. And the legislation that we are going to introduce<br />
into the Federal Parliament will confirm that situation, and put beyond any legal doubt<br />
that those sorts of fears are completely unfounded.<br />
The second guarantee, and I use that word carefully, and I use that word deliberately.<br />
The second guarantee I give you is that no pastoral leaseholder can have their title<br />
affected by, or diminished, by a native title claim. None at all. Not affected by it or<br />
not diminished by it.<br />
The third very important guarantee I give you my friends is that no pastoral leaseholder<br />
can have their conduct or their activities in any way connected with the carrying out of<br />
a pastoral or a primary production activity interfered with by a native title claim.<br />
We've had all this talk over the last few months that you'll need the permission of<br />
native title claimants to put in a fence, to sink a dam, or to do anything that is<br />
incidental to the carrying on of your business. Could I say no, no, no that cannot<br />
happen. Because under the guarantees that wvill be contained in this legislation the<br />
right to negotiate, that stupid property rightta a ie ontv il liat<br />
alone, unlike other title holders in Australia, that native title right wfi be completely<br />
abolished and removed for all time in relation to the activities of pastoralists carrying<br />
on not only strictly defined pastoral activities, but also the fbl extent of primary<br />
production activities which you can possibly imagine and which are contained in the<br />
definition under the Taxation Act and as we all know unfortunately, definitions in the<br />
Taxation Act are very widely couched indeed.<br />
So ladies and gentlemen they are the first three guarantees that I want to give you and<br />
can I just repeat them. That you can't have your title in any way diminished or<br />
affected by a native title claim. You can't be put off your property. You can't be<br />
stopped from carrying on your pastoral activities on your property. Your right to do<br />
that will be fully confirmed. No pastoral titleholder can have their title in any way<br />
affected or diminished, but most importantly of all, you can go away from this meeting<br />
safe in the knowledge that when this legisation is passed in the national Parliament.<br />
you will, have the fulal and unfettered capacity to run your property. You will not only<br />
be able to carry on pastoral activity, but you wrill be able to diversify' into all aspects of </p>
<p>Fax from : 17/ 05/ 97 13: 48 Pg: 3<br />

3<br />
primary production. You will even be able to carry on an incidental tourist business, a<br />
farm-stay business, if that is what you want. And while ever the dominant purpose of<br />
the use of the land remains one relating to pastoral or primary industry activity, you<br />
will be able to do that without getting the say-so, the permission, the beg-your-pardon<br />
or whatever of anybody else. You will be subject like anv other Australian citizen to<br />
the operations of the ordinary laws of the States of Australia and the ordinary laws of<br />
the Commonwealth of Australia. but please don't believe this fear-mongering that says<br />
native title claimants can throw you off your property. They can't. We will never ever<br />
allow that to happen.<br />
Now ladies and gentlemen, tile other guarantees that I want to give you are these.<br />
That if there are any compensation payments ordered to be made in relation to the<br />
compulsory acquisition or compulsory resumption of any established native title rights<br />
anywhere in Australia, that compensation wi~ ll not be borne by tile pastoralists of<br />
Australia, it will be borne by the general body of the Australian taxpayer on the ratio of<br />
to be paid by the Commonwealth Government, and 25% to be paid by the State<br />
governments. And if anybody here before me thinks that compensation payable for<br />
native title is going to come out of the pockets of the individual pastoralists, in relation<br />
to whom property claims have been made, can I promise you that that is 100%<br />
inaccurate and 100% wrong. We are not going to ask the individuals who may be<br />
related to these claims in anyway to pay the costs of compensation. Can I also say to<br />
you that in relation to the issue of compensation, that no matter what route is chosen<br />
by the government, if we were to go down the blanket extinguishment route there<br />
would still be compensation payable in relation to any established native title rights.<br />
Because there is a clause in the Commonwealth Constitution that effectively says, that<br />
if any property right is extinguished or taken away, it can only be done on just terms.<br />
And whether you like that or not, whether I like it or not, whether people in other<br />
parts of Australia like it or not, it is the law of this country, it is in the Constitution.<br />
and please don't anybody go away from this meeting imagining that the blanket<br />
extinguishment over pastoral leases of any possible native title of that blanket<br />
extinguishment is something that can be done and thereby escaping thle liability and thle<br />
possibility of compensation. But can I emphasise with you again that wve have worked<br />
out a compensation arrangement which I understand to be acceptable to all of the State<br />
governments of Australia whereby if there is compensation as a result of a compulsory<br />
acquisition procedures of the State then that compensation wvill be borne not by you,<br />
alone, it will be borne by the general body of the Australian taxpayer. And the people<br />
in the cities arnd the people who have got another view on this, a view different from<br />
you, they will have to contribute, along with the rest of the Australian community and<br />
the general body of the Australian community. Could I also promise you, as I have<br />
already, that there will be a far more generous approach provided and afforded in<br />
relation to legal assistance and legal aid for pastoralists who may be involved in any<br />
kind of action.<br />
The other thing that I want to emphasise to you my firiends is that the existing Native<br />
Title Act as both Tim Fischer and I said at the outset, the existing Native Title Act is<br />
nothing more than an administrative nightmare. The existing Native Title Act was<br />
opposed by me, and it was opposed by the Liberal and National Parties in 1993<br />
because we knew what has now happened would happen. We were divided by the<br />
press at the time. I will never forget when the Native Title Act was passed in 1993. </p>

the entire federal parliamentary press gallery ( inaudible) out of boredom and Gareth<br />
Evans and Cheryl Kernot danced and embraced arnd hugged each other in the Senate<br />
chamber. When John Hewson criticised it, as the then leader of the opposition, he was<br />
howled down, he was abused and he was criticised by the politically correct press of<br />
the federal parliamentary press gallery. We were the people who opposed it. And I<br />
want to drive that point home again and again, because we knew what has now<br />
happened would occur. We knew people would have bogus claims put on their<br />
properties. We knew the right to negotiate was a licence for people to come from<br />
nowhere and make a claim on your property and then say until you pay me out. we're<br />
not going to allow you to do anything with your property. Well let me say I regard<br />
that as repugnant, and I regard that as un-Australian and unacceptable and that is going<br />
to be removed by the amendments that are already in the Federal Parliament, You<br />
won't have to put up with that anymore. And under the procedures that wve have in<br />
place ladies and gentlemen, bogus claims will not succeed. Under the procedures that<br />
we have in place, all of the claims that have already been lodged will have to go<br />
through the far more stringent procedure which we are legislating for. Under the<br />
procedure that we have in place the capacity of people to come from nowhere and to<br />
try and interfere with the conduct of your pastoral business wvill be taken away<br />
completely. Can I say two other things about the detail of the plan. One of those relates to ( fhe<br />
question of access. I can understand the fear in the community that people who have<br />
no connection at all with your land can come from a distant part of Australia and say,<br />
well years and years ago my relatives, or my ancestors, or my friends, or the other<br />
members of my tribe had a connection with this property, and therefore I've got some<br />
right to come onto your property and to exercise my traditional access rights. Well<br />
under the amendments that we are framing that can't happen. Unless somebody has a<br />
current physical connection with the land, I repeat that, unless somebody has a current<br />
physical connection with the land, than access rights cannot be obtained. Now they<br />
cannot. And that if any of those rights are to exist, those rights must be exercised at all<br />
times with complete respect for, and in complete deference to. the rights of the<br />
pastoralists who own and operate the property.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, can I say to you this is a difficult issue. It is an issue which goes<br />
to the heart of your right to survive in a very difficult physical and economic and social<br />
environment. Some of you may have thought that my comment about my concern for<br />
the outback of Australia was the sort of thing that politicians say at the beginning of<br />
speeches. Can I assure you it's not. Can I assure you that I am happy to spend as<br />
much time as you can and I can today to listen to your questions, to answer them as<br />
openly as! I can, and then afterwards to meet as many of you as I can to listen to what<br />
you have to say. I believe that we need to move forward. I believe that we need to<br />
take action as a nation to put the doubt and the confusion created by the very<br />
impractical decision of the High Court in the Wik case, to put that behind us. We have<br />
two choices. We can go down the path that I've endeavoured to explain to you today.<br />
A path that will guarantee you the untrammelled right to run your properties. It will<br />
guarantee you the right to retain your leaseholds. It will guarantee you the right not to<br />
have your ownership and occupation of your properties in any way disturbed. It will<br />
guarantee your Tight not only to carry on pastoral activities, but also primary<br />
production activities in the widest possible sense of that term. It will guarantee you </p>
<p>Fax from 17/ 05/ 97 13: 48 Pg:<br />
MAY 17 ' 97 13: 46 P. 11<br />
against any liability personally for the payment of compensation. It will guarantee you<br />
access to any legal aid assistance if you want yourself, although you don't have to<br />
make that choice, be involved in any claims to establish native title which will primarily<br />
be ones conducted between the claimants and the State governments of Australia. It<br />
will provide all of those guarantees. But it does not have the downside of the<br />
alternative.. The alternative is attractive on the surface, I understand that. The alternative of<br />
blanket extinguishment is attractive on the surface. But there are three weaknesses<br />
with that approach. The first is. not necessarily the most important, the first is that the<br />
potential compensation bill for the nation would be much greater. The second is that<br />
there is a strong possibility of a Constitutional challenge to such legislation and if that<br />
legislation of blanket extinguishment were found to be unconstitutional, then it would<br />
necessitate the carniage of a referendum of the Australian people in order to overturn<br />
that particular finding because it would be a finding of unconstitutionality under the<br />
Federal Constitution. And thirdly, and most importantly, I believe that the prospects<br />
of securing passage of the plan that I have put forward through the Senate. and the<br />
prospects of ( inaudible) a sense of security and a sense of stability within a relatively<br />
short period of time are much greater than in relation to the blanket extinguishment<br />
option which would certainly be rejected by the Senate and would then inevitably<br />
require, if it were to be carried, its re-presentation and then passage of an ultimate<br />
double dissolution and joint sitting of the Federal Parliament following another<br />
election. Now ladies and gentlemen, well can I say to you that the way t , o go is to get<br />
what you want quickly, to get what you want without the risks involved in the<br />
alternative way. You can take the risky way and in two years time you would be no<br />
further ahead. In two years time there would be a similar meeting. In two years time<br />
you'd be asking me to remember 1997. In two years time you'd be back arguing this<br />
thing again. I mean the great virtue of what I'm arguing for ladies and gentlemen is<br />
that it does deliver the guarantees that I outlined, it does give you security, it does give<br />
you stability, but it doesn't have the disabilities and the downsides which are inherent<br />
in the alternative proposal. It is a proposal that delivers on our commitment to give<br />
security and stability to pastoral leaseholders and it is in my view an outcome that will<br />
be seen by the entire Australian community as a fair and just solution to a very very<br />
difficult national problem,<br />
Thank you. </p>
