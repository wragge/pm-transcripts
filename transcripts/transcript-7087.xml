TRAN'SCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, KING DAVID HOTEL, JERUSALEM<br />
27 JANUARY 1987<br />
L 0 E -PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawk-,-did you-urge--Mr -Shamir-to accept-thhe<br />
Soviet Union and the PLO in an international peace conference?<br />
P: I -put -to -the-Pri-me iitr tIbeiv h conciept _ oftfh~ e_<br />
international conference had merit. And that means that I also<br />
indicated in that context there is a place for the Soviet Union<br />
as part of that process. . As far as the PLO was concerned, I didn't<br />
go specifically to that. It is quite clear that the question of<br />
thie PLO is-something that will have to he determined in the<br />
processes of discussions between the parties as they go further<br />
down the path with peace processes. Clearly, the position of<br />
myself and my Government is that the capacity of the PLO to play<br />
a role in these processes depends on their pkeparednes to<br />
recognise the right of Israel and-that-is done most desirably,<br />
of course, by an amendment to their charter which calls for the<br />
destruction of Israel. Alternatively, in terms of the approach<br />
that King Hussein was purs~ ng between February of 1485 and<br />
February 1986. The recognition On their part of the resolutions<br />
242 and 338 constituting a basis for negotiation.<br />
JOURNALIST: What * hs Mr Shamir ' s response?<br />
PM: The Prime Minister repeated his position that they didn't<br />
like the idea of an international conference that was a matter<br />
essentially for negotiation between the parties directly concerned.<br />
I put the view to him that we wvould not see, and as I understood the<br />
Jordanian position, they would not see the conference as imposing<br />
solutions upon the parties within the framework of an<br />
international conference properly convened on agreement between the<br />
Earties that it uould provide a framew~ ork within which discussions<br />
etween the parties would take place. Because it is obviously the<br />
case that in the end no agreement is going to be no viable agreement<br />
is going to emerge except out of negotiations between the parties.<br />
But an international conference could provide a framework. I<br />
raised the question of the resumption of diplomatic relations bertween<br />
th~ e Soviet Union and Israel and some change in the attitude of the<br />
Soviet Union and the treatment of Soviet Jewry. And the Prime<br />
Minister indiicated that in th1e event that these things were to<br />
happen then that could constitute a changed position within which<br />
there wouldibb a place for the Soviet Union in the processes concernir<br />
the achievement of a peaceful resolution of the Israeli<br />
JOURNALIST: has he asked you play any--role?<br />
PM: No, he hasn't asked me to play a role.<br />
ki </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Do you see a role for yourself?<br />
PM: No, I don't push a role for myself but I merely indicated<br />
again to Prime Minister Shamir as I did to the King of Jordan and<br />
the Prime minister of Jordan that if there was any way in which<br />
Australia could be of assistance, however small, we stood ready<br />
to be of assistance. And the Prime Minister noted that with<br />
appreciation. JOURNALIST: Is it possible that Mr Sheverdnadze will come if and<br />
when he comes to Australla?<br />
PM: of course. I will-discuss thesje, issues-with Mr-Sheverdnadze<br />
if and when he comes to Australia.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr -Hawke.,-. could raise-the--subjec-t of -th. visittoL__<br />
Australia by Mr Ariel Sharon. Does it concern you that there<br />
could be some controversy and concern amongst Australians by that<br />
visit? Have you been concerned by it?<br />
PM: obviously there could be some concerns about that but all I<br />
can say is that that hasn't been a matter of discussion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you welcome him to Australia?<br />
PM: It won't be my role to welcome him. When Ministers come to<br />
Australia the Prime Minister doesn't meet Ministers. The<br />
Minister concerned meets and deals with Ministers.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, just getting back to the middle East talks<br />
that you had with Mr Shamir. Did you feel in any sense that his<br />
attitude was somewhat inflexible?<br />
PM: He ' has got a tough position. But let me say this that I<br />
have no doubt that the Prime Minister and the Government of<br />
Israel is committed to achieving a just and durable settlement of<br />
the Israeli/ Arab dispute. And I think that the Prime minister<br />
recognises that both within Israel and outside Israel there are<br />
differences of opinion about the paths to peace, how to get<br />
there. And I would think he recognises that there is legitimate<br />
room for these differences of opinion. And I would hope that his<br />
attitude would be that if you can keep talks going in a variety<br />
of ways, including the involvement of other countries like<br />
Australia, in these sorts of discussions that gradually there is<br />
going to emerge sufficient commonality of ground to accelerate<br />
the processes. But I think what has got to be understood is that<br />
you are dealing here with a dispute of longstanding in which<br />
* there are long historical and deep emotional feelings and..<br />
attitudes involved. And it is somewhat unrealistic to expect<br />
them to be dissipated overnight. The important thing that I have<br />
discerned in the two countries now that I have visited Jordan<br />
and Israel that there is a real commitment to achieving peace.<br />
And all of us who have an interest in trying to assist in the<br />
achievement of that objective have got to keep on trying and, as<br />
I say, to try to get to a position where there can be sufficient<br />
common ground to get real negotiations going.<br />
JOURNALIST: Could there be greater flexibility there on the part'<br />
of Mr Shamir? </p>
<p>PM1: Well, obviously one would always like to see a maximum of<br />
flexibility but it's not for me to come here and tell the Prime<br />
Minister of this country by public exposition how he should<br />
conduct himself. The proper ways of conducting these affairs are<br />
by quiet and diplomatic discussion and by enabling the parties<br />
involved, in these case Israel to understand the integrity of the<br />
way in which you put a position and I am certain that Mr Shamir<br />
understands and accepts the full integrity of. Australia's<br />
position in this<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think that he was at all impressed? I assume<br />
that you put to him your impressions-of.-the--Jordanian visit.<br />
made it very clear that you were impressed by their integrity.<br />
Do you think that you made an impact on him at all?<br />
PM: Yes, I think I did, because as you would appreciate that<br />
some two and a half hours of discussions with the Prime Minister,<br />
and then some informal discussions and over three hours with the<br />
King, I did have a fairly unique opportunity of getting the most<br />
up to date detailed exposition of the Jordanian position, and<br />
yes, I do think I was able to impress Mr Shamir, firstly, with<br />
the total integrity and commitment of the Jordanians to wanting<br />
to achieve a just, reasonable and durable peace between Israel<br />
and their Arab neighbours. I have certainly succeeded in<br />
conveying that, and I think I also succeeded in conveying to Mr<br />
Shamir the reason behind Jordan'-s thinking as to the appropriate<br />
processes, as to why Jordan saw an international conference as a<br />
necessary part of those processes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you see any prospect of Mr Shamir moving on this<br />
matter? Was he at all impressed1 by your arguments about the<br />
conflict of the framework of that matter?<br />
PM: Well, you will have to ask Mr Shamir if you have the<br />
opportunity. You would have to ask him as to what impression I<br />
had upon him in expressing the views that I did. But what you<br />
have got to understand when you are talking about Mr Shamir's<br />
views and positions is that he is the leader of a coalition<br />
government and that within that Government he readily<br />
acknowledges as there is within Israel as a whole, there are<br />
differences of opinion, and he acknowledges that there are<br />
diversities and legitimate differences of opinion, so the<br />
processes of going down this tortuous path to peace, the<br />
processes not only between Israel and her neighbours and other<br />
countries who are interested in this issue but it-is also a<br />
question of processes within Israel.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think that Mr Peres has it right, that his<br />
position seems to be very similar to yours?<br />
PM: As yet, Greg, I haven't had the opportunity as you would<br />
appreciate of talking with Shimon Peres, he returns to Israel<br />
tomorrow, and I will have the opportunity of fairly lengthy<br />
discussions with him during tomorrow afternoon and tomorrow<br />
evening at the dinner that he is giving for me. I suppose it is<br />
obvious from what Mr Peres has said publicly, I suppose it is<br />
obvious from the reports of the meetings at Alexandria last year </p>
<p>between Prime Minister Peres, as he then was, and President<br />
mubarak that there is a greater degree of similarity between what<br />
he has been saying and the view that I have about what will be<br />
necessary to get these processes going effectively and let me<br />
make it quite clear I don't come to Israel in any sense to try<br />
and exacerbate any differences that there may be between the<br />
Prime Minister and his Foreign Minister. That would be<br />
counter-productive. In the end these processes are going to have<br />
a chance of working, then there has to be an Israeli position,<br />
the achievement of that position is properly for the<br />
p-roce-sse s of -th-is g6e~ it-.-<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you-ur ge.. the P-rim e Minister to stop the<br />
settlements program in the West Bank, and secondly, did j0u urge_<br />
Israel to sign the non-proliferation treaty?<br />
PM: Well, taking the first part of your question, it is fairly<br />
obvious, the direct answer to your question is I didn't say that,<br />
I didn't go to the issue and say please stop the settlement. I<br />
make the point that in so far as we are talking about the rights<br />
of self-determination for the Palestinians with the possibilities<br />
of an independent state emerging and then I will be saying that<br />
the view that's emerged to me from discussions in Jordan as to<br />
the most likely outcome of those processes would be a form of<br />
confederation with Jordan. I mean it follows from that, that our<br />
statement and policies beforehand about the five-year settlements<br />
is understood. Now the second part of your question about<br />
non-proliferation, I did discuss that matter with the Prime<br />
Minister Shamir. I said to the Prime Minister that Australia<br />
which has an alliance relationship with the United States, has<br />
nevertheless consistently since we've been in Government, pursued<br />
the cause of disarmament, or vigorously perhaps in the pursuit in<br />
the other issue in the international sphere, and I pointed out to<br />
him the commitment that we have to th,-NPT and that we saw this<br />
as an important part of the progress on the part of realistic and<br />
verifiable disarmament. And said to him specifically that we<br />
would regard it as appropriate for Israel to consider an<br />
adherence to the NPT. The response of the Prime Minister was an<br />
interesting, and I think, an important one. He recognised<br />
Australia's interest, and proper interests in these matters. He<br />
said that the position of Israel was this: that they had offered<br />
and their position had remained this to the states in the<br />
region. They, Israel, want the states in the region to sign an<br />
agreement to which Israel would be party, rennouncing the<br />
acquisition and utilisation of nuclear weapons, and he said to me<br />
that if the states of the region were prepared to sign such an<br />
agreement that's what Israel would do, and I asked whether that<br />
would be within the framework of the NPT and he said it was<br />
conceivable it could be within that framework but what was<br />
important was that it had to be a real agreement, a resourceful<br />
agreement, and it would probably need even more than the NPT.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did Mr Shamir actually ask you for your agreement of<br />
representation from the Soviet Union?<br />
PM: He raised the question of not only the release of Soviet<br />
Jews, but the treatment of Jews within the Soviet Union, and<br />
asked me and the Government to do whatever we could in that </p>
<p>regard. And he did that in the context of expressing his<br />
gratitude for all that I and the Government and had done in that<br />
respect. I said to him that both I and Bill Hayden had<br />
consistently since we've been in Government at every appropriate<br />
opportunity raised these issues and that we will continue to do<br />
SO.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, did Mr Shamir indicate to you the<br />
Arab countries had agreed to sign an agreement on the nuclear<br />
weapons, that Israel might be prepared to dismantle its nuclear<br />
-__--armaments-program?<br />
PM: Well, it seemed to me to follow logically that this was an<br />
agreement-which he wished to see, then that would follow. I<br />
didn't ask him what the extent of their program was, we have seen<br />
the public reports. But obviously it follows logically that if<br />
there was to be a signed agreement--that there-was to be noacquisition,<br />
no utilisation, then the extent that any state was<br />
in a current situation which was not consistent with such a<br />
treaty, then they would have to take the steps to become<br />
consistent with the treaty.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you know about the Sharon visit, at the time of<br />
the invitation from the Trade Minister?<br />
PM: Not immediately, no. You know the way I run this<br />
Government, that I don't stand over my ministers, and say before<br />
you make decisions which are legitimately within your portfolio.<br />
JOURNALIST: sensitive<br />
PM: Yes, but there are a lots of things that happen which are<br />
sensitive, and part of the strength of my government is that<br />
minister's know that I have confidencg in them and I'm not an<br />
interfering Prime minister. I have said many times, and it is<br />
appropriate to say it again, that it is an extraordinarily<br />
competent Ministry it is the best Ministry by far since the war<br />
in our country. One of the reasons for its strength is not only<br />
the individual competence of the Ministers, but the relationship<br />
I have with them.<br />
JOURNALIST: you know about it in advance..<br />
PM: Hey, that sounds terribly like a hypothetical question.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think it damages the perception of your<br />
even-handed policy towards the Middle East, given that your<br />
Government has rejected the UN seminar in Australia, would have<br />
brought a PLO diplomat to our country?<br />
PM: There is no comparison to a solution. We'll have to leave<br />
it there. </p>
