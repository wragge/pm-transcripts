INTERVIEW WITH DUNCAN FAIRWEATHER<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, you got a sympathetic hearing in<br />
Europe, what realistic hopes do you have that Australia's<br />
case will be accepted by the Common Market?<br />
PRIME MIINISTER: I believe that Australia's case is now<br />
better understood than it's ever been. We also have the<br />
circumstances in which the United States has said that they<br />
will walk away from these trade negotiations unless<br />
agriculture is included. Now when I spoke to Mr. Jenkins<br />
he made it perfectly plain that the result in Geneva would<br />
be unreal for Australia, of no use to Australia, unless it<br />
opened up the reality and the prospect of trade in beef with<br />
the European Community, for example and it was the first time that<br />
I had heard him talking in those terms, even about the prospect<br />
of trade in a realistic way. So, I think the chances are better<br />
than they have ever been. I also. think that it's vastly<br />
important because these trade negotiations are going to set<br />
the pattern of world trade for many years ahead and Australia<br />
is a very significant trading nation who can't afford to ignore<br />
or be shut out of one of the largest and most affluent trading<br />
blocs the world has ever seen. I know quite well that our<br />
markets in other parts of the world, in Asia and Korea and<br />
Japan and Southeast Asia, are going to expand and grow both<br />
ways and a great deal of attention is being devoted to that<br />
but it's in Europe, where these non-tariff barriers, discriminatory<br />
practices, are pursued.<br />
QUESTION: There's been some criticism that you may have harmed<br />
Australial's relations with the EEC by speaking out so frankly<br />
and openly in Europe. Why did you decide to go there to conduct<br />
this campaign rather than leaving it to Mr. Garland or the<br />
normal diplomatic avenues.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There are two matters you see. The bilateral<br />
matter has principally been handled by Mr. Garland but the final<br />
discussions that we were having with the European Community was<br />
coinciding in the run-down period for the Multilateral Trade<br />
Negotiations which began in 1973. They are meant to come to<br />
a conclusion in July of this year and that's only a very short<br />
time away and the Government felt, I felt, that the matters<br />
were so serious that Australia's view needed to be pressed<br />
with the utmost vigour and with all the force at our command<br />
and that's why this visit was undertaken, to add what weight<br />
we can to making these trade negotiations a success, to opening<br />
up world trade. Not just for industrial goods but for<br />
agriculture and for commodities because unless that happens<br />
I think we could well face a very difficult trading future.<br />
What happens this year is not just going to affect this / 2 </p>

PRIME MINISTER: ( continued) year, it will set the pattern<br />
ToEr many years ahead and it's going to affect the livelihood<br />
and the well-being, therefore, of all Australians.<br />
QUESTION: There's a meeting of the seven economic powers<br />
in Bonn next month. What influence are they going to have on<br />
the sort of outcome that you are looking for?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well if they have a good constructive meeting<br />
amongst themselves, obviously that will help to set the outcome<br />
for a constructive result of the trade negotiations. If they<br />
ended up by going in every different direction, obviously that<br />
wouldn't help. I don't really expect enormous results out of<br />
that Bonn summit. If you look at past summits, statements<br />
have been made which all of them could embrace but they have<br />
statements~ of intention, statements of principle, perhaps more<br />
than statements of firm and committed action. I think that<br />
the Bonn summit will be looking to expansion of demand~ to<br />
maintaining barriers against undue protectionism. I hope they.<br />
will also be looking to matters that will advance the trading<br />
opportunities of the developing world and also I would hope<br />
saying something about the need to have a broad based result<br />
at Geneva which would include agriculture, not just industrial<br />
goods. But what they do determine at this stage, its speculation.<br />
They are the sorts of areas that I would like to see covered.<br />
QUESTION: In our relations with the Common Market are you<br />
going to use uranium as a bargaining lever?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: A number of people in Europe asked me about that<br />
and one of theTEuropean Commissioners, a year ago, in fact<br />
he virtually suggested that that ought to happen because he<br />
said you negotiate with us over uranium, this is your right,<br />
because we are the ones who can give you access. We don't want<br />
. to use uranium in those terms because safeguards are a quite<br />
separate matter. There are international obligations in that<br />
insofar as the supply of uranium is concerned, there again I<br />
believe international obligations in the supply of energy to<br />
an energy short world. Now I would hope that Europeans will<br />
come to a responsible and reasonable result as responsible<br />
and reasonable people and wouldn't really try to press Australia<br />
beyond endurance. I've also said of course that the strength<br />
of Australia's view, and the determination behind that view<br />
should not in any sense be underestimated by the European<br />
Community. QUESTION: So there is a point at which uranium might be<br />
considered as an option?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't want to say anymore than I have on<br />
tis ' particular subject, I really don't. I hope we will be<br />
concluding a-safeguards agreement with Britain very shortly.<br />
It's been agreed between officials and be comifig for the<br />
Australian Government for confirmation and then I understand / 3 </p>

PRIME MINISTER: ( continued) it lies on the table at EURATUM<br />
for a month, then the British will agree it that's what<br />
I was told by their Ministers when I was there I've also<br />
been advised that the French want to have a similar safeguards<br />
agreement and the Germans might also be interested so there<br />
is considerable interest in Europe, quite apart from other<br />
countries with whom we have been negotiating, for Australia's<br />
uranium. We've again pointed out that reliability of access,<br />
reliability of supply are both important principles in trade.<br />
Again, I would be like to be able to tieat uranium as separate<br />
and something of particular importance and significance and<br />
I hope we will be able to maintain that.<br />
QUESION: Is there a warning carried in your strong<br />
anti-protectionism statements in Europe for inefficient producers<br />
in Australia that they can't expect to be shielded from<br />
cheap imports forever?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think you've got to look at Australia's<br />
producers in a different light from the sorts of remarks that<br />
have often been made about European producers. When speaking<br />
with one group, with one person in particular in Europe, I<br />
mentioned that his concern about people being locked into<br />
inefficient industries but he was saying that in the context<br />
of government subsidies to those particular industries,<br />
government subsidies to employment in those particular<br />
industries. Now Australia has no programs, I think, of a<br />
similar vein. Our training schemes are across the board, not<br />
directed to particular industries so we haven't got the situation<br />
in which governments are locking capital and manpower into<br />
particular industries through quite deliberate government<br />
subsidies and against the best long-term interests of the<br />
country concerned. We know quite well that in Australia, as<br />
in other countries, there has to be re-structuring, but I<br />
have said on a number of occasions, re-structuring is very<br />
difficult when industry is flat. It would have been much<br />
easier ten years ago, fifteen years ago, when matters were<br />
booming and there would have been jobs in other industries<br />
moving away from the ones that might have had, in the judgement<br />
of some investors, a slightly dubious future. We seek to<br />
support Australian industry, we will continue to do so. At<br />
the same time in any country there has to be a capacity to<br />
move into those areas where the resources and energies can<br />
be used properly. Nobody can be guaranteed that what they<br />
do today, they are going to be able to do in 50 years time<br />
in precisely the same way and I don't believe any Australian<br />
manufacturer would suggest that or ask for that. The capacity<br />
and strength of Australia is going to depend on our capacity<br />
to adapt, to change, to modify, to innovate, to do exciting<br />
and new things which will advance the Australian cause and<br />
I believe more and more people are coming to understand that.<br />
It is our job as a government to stand with industry, whether<br />
it is primary industry or secondary industry. To give encouragerent<br />
and support where that is necessary; to give protection where<br />
that is necessary but to do it-in accordance with proper<br />
trading principles and not in the way that I think is utterly<br />
in defiance-of those principles as has occured in Europe. / 4 </p>

QUESTION: What's your thinking at the moment on a phased<br />
lowering of tariffs against imports from Asian countries, a<br />
phased reduction which I understand Mr. Lee would like to<br />
see? PRIME MINISTER: He would like to see more trade but he<br />
also knows that there has been more trade, with ASEAN countries<br />
exports to Australia over recent years have been growing<br />
at 40 percent a year. Now while any country would like to<br />
increase its exports to Australia at a greater rate, ASEAN<br />
countries know quite well that there is a limit to the<br />
rate of increase of penetration in the Australian market.<br />
They also know that we are doing a good deal to help and<br />
my good friend the Prime Minister of Singapore also knows<br />
that. At this very moment, there is an ASEAN-Australia<br />
Industrial Seminar taking place in Melbourne. In October<br />
of this year there will be an ASEAN-Australia Trade Fair.<br />
Now both these things came out of proposals that I made<br />
at the Kuala Lumpur meeting last year. Both were designed<br />
to help promote the economic and commercial cooperation between<br />
ASEAN and Australia to expand trade between ASEAN and Australia<br />
but especially in a difficult market situation when there is<br />
unemployment. The Prime Minister of Singapore and other ASEAN<br />
leaders know quite well that there is a limit to their degree<br />
of penetration into our markets. In fact, Australia imports<br />
more per capita industrial goods from the developing world<br />
than I think any other country and I've made the point again<br />
or in the past, that if the ASEAN countries have the same<br />
access to North America and to Europe as they have for Australia<br />
in textiles, apparel and footware, three-sensitive areas, they'd<br />
be exporting an extra $ 1,000 million worth of goods each year.<br />
Now that just highlights the kind of access they've got to our<br />
market compared to the very limited access they've got to<br />
North America and to Europe and so I believe that Australia<br />
has behaved as a good neighbour in these particular matters.<br />
When you are talking about a phased reduction, we have of course<br />
said that we will be part of the ( inaudible) tariff proposals<br />
at the Multilateral Trade Negotiations. Whether that takes<br />
place depends upon the degree of reciprocity we get from other<br />
trading countries which will allow access for Australian<br />
commodities, for Australian goods, and we will have to make<br />
a proper judgement about that but we'd certainly be :. very much<br />
opposed to sudden-moves of the kind that occurred in the past<br />
were without any reciprocity, without any benefits for<br />
Australian traders. The Australian tariff was cut by 25 percent<br />
overnight. That did great harm. It led to very considerable<br />
damage and we got no advantage from it in terms of access to<br />
other markets. That sort of thing I was opposed to then, I<br />
remain utterly opposed to it. -The formula approach being<br />
discussed at Geneva we are prepared to participate in, but<br />
whether we can go the course, which we have made quite plain,<br />
depends upon the kind of access we get for Australian goods.<br />
