PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE lION P J KEATING MP,<br />
DOORSTOP, HYATT HOTEL, CANBERRA, 26.10.92<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Irish presidents arc welcome?<br />
PM: Well they are with me particularly, so I had a very good talk.<br />
J: What sort of things did you discuss?<br />
PM; I think she said at the Press Club that we should keep the content of our<br />
discussions privatc, and I think that is a good rule.<br />
J: Mr Keating do you believe that the Coalition is going to impose a wage freeze?<br />
PM: I will answer just this one question. The Coalition is going to push 8 million<br />
Australians onto common law wage contracts. What Dr Hewson established<br />
yesterday was he has not the faintest idea about how he will protect the living<br />
standards of Australians against exploitation by anybody who may employ them.<br />
All the flexibility that anyone requires in the labour market in this country is now<br />
available through the system of enterprise bargaining and enterprise agrecments,<br />
which this Government has established. The only flexibility that we don't provide<br />
is flexibility down cutting people's pay and cutting thcir conditions of work. In<br />
the end that's what John Hewson and John Howard are after, they arc after their<br />
pay packet. That's why they're slipping and sliding over this question of minimum<br />
raitcs of pay. It's the old Tory agenda, it has never changed.<br />
