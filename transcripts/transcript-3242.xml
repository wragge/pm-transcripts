CHAMBER OF COMMERCE -NATIONAL BANK SURVEY<br />
The Survey of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and the<br />
National Bank discloses a sound, healthy and growing economy.<br />
Employment is high, profitability is high, trading is good<br />
and business expectations for the future are that this situation<br />
will continue. The survey confirms that the economic management of Australia<br />
has been in good hands.<br />
Where is the alleged " crisis" that Mr Snedden is trying to<br />
sell to Australians.<br />
Mr Snedden's scare tactics are devised to bolster this<br />
opportunistic bid for power.<br />
They have no foundation in expert surveys.<br />
The survey does reveal the extent of inflationary pressures<br />
in the economy.<br />
The Government has taken firm action to alleviate these<br />
pressures over the last 17 months.<br />
Our actions to stop the flow of foreign money, to reduce domestic<br />
liquidity, to cut tariffs and the impact of the Prices Justification<br />
Tribunal have all worked in the right direction.<br />
Despite the opposition of Liberal and Country Party spokesmen<br />
to all of these measures we have persisted with them and they are<br />
now beginning to have their effect.<br />
The most recent statistics reveal that the rate of inflation<br />
is beginning to slow down. We will continue to act on the best<br />
economic advice available to the Government to finally beat the<br />
problem of inflation.<br />
