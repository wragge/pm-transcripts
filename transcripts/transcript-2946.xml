NO DATE<br />
M/ 92 6 June 1973<br />
PRII7, MI". ISTR'S VISIT TO I1IDIA<br />
Following is the text of a speech given by the Prime<br />
Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Whitlam, at a dinner<br />
given in his honour by the Prime Minister of India in New Delhi on<br />
Monday, 4 June, 1973.<br />
" It is a moving occasion indeed for me to be here on your<br />
invitation as Prime Minister of Australia, in your canital in<br />
this ancient seat of kings, emperors, viceroys and now the centre<br />
of the world's largest democracy.<br />
Your gracious invitation came very soon after the change<br />
of Government in Australia. Nothing could have been more gratifying<br />
0 to me, nothing could be more attuned to my own desires than that I<br />
should return to India as soon as nossible in the life of my new<br />
Government. The honour you have done me, and through me, Australia,<br />
is deeply anureciated and will not easily or quickly be forgotten.<br />
In the countries I have so far visited an Prime Minister,<br />
in New Zealand, in Indonesia, in Canada, in Britain, I have been<br />
at some nains to emphasize the continuity of Australian policy<br />
desnite the change of Government. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I do so again here in India. There was, for example, no<br />
disagreement between the two sides in the Australian Parliament<br />
about the support given by the previous Government to the_ emergence<br />
of Bangladesh as an independent nation.<br />
The previous Government's prompt recognition of Bangladesh<br />
was warmly sup-norted by the whole Australian people. Nevertheless<br />
I cannot help but feel that there has been something missing in<br />
recent years in the relationship between our two countries.<br />
There has been perhaps too much of the feeling that we can<br />
take each other for granted. It is, for instance, just not good<br />
enough that I should be the first Australian Prime Minister to visit<br />
Delhi for fourteen years. It may be that because of our recent<br />
preoccunation with Indo-China and the fascinating possibilities<br />
Australia has before her in developing new-relations with China<br />
and Japan, our relations with India have not been given the<br />
attention they should have. If this has been so I intend to amend<br />
it and amend it thoroughly.<br />
I particularly look forward to closer co-operation with<br />
India in the United Nations. We are now both members of the<br />
Security Council. When my Government took office I gave a number<br />
of new instructions on the way our votes would be cast in the<br />
Security Council and the General A: asembly.<br />
It is significant I think that all the departures from<br />
the orevious pattern of voting have brought us in line with India.<br />
It has not been, of course, a question of our just following / 13 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
India: but it is an indication of the closeness of our views on a<br />
great range of issues facing the world on race discrimination, on<br />
de-colonisation, on Southern Africa, on human rights, on the need<br />
to keep this region free of great power rivalries.<br />
We gratefully acknowledge the moral leadership India has<br />
so often given in the cause of world neace. In that continuing<br />
quest we can never forget or overestimate the pioneer role played<br />
by your father. Perhaps never in human history and certainly not in the<br />
history of the democracies has so great a man had his works so<br />
faithfully and splendidly carried forewsrd by his daughter.<br />
The generation in which India achieved indenendence was one<br />
not lacking in great world leaders. None lives so brightly in the<br />
memory, not only of the millions of his fellow countrymen but all<br />
mankind, as Jawaharlal Nehru.<br />
I find it fascinating to read in his great work, " The<br />
Discovery of India", his observations about Australia fascinating<br />
and moving at the same time, because this profound book was written<br />
in a British nrison when his work and the work of his own father<br />
for independence seemed smashed beyond hope. And I find that in a<br />
book in which he has drawn deep lessons from the history of India<br />
covering 5,000 years, he drew an example from an event then occurring<br />
in my own country a referendum whether to give greater social<br />
powers to the Central Government of Australia. / 4 </p>
<p>He speaks of the continuing difficulty confronting<br />
Central Governments in Federal systems in persua~ ding the States<br />
to abjure any morsel of t'leir powers, even in war.<br />
The defeat of that referendum in 1944 happened to be a<br />
crucial event in the development of my own political thinking. I<br />
find it profoundly moving that such an event in siuch a far off<br />
country provided a lesson for so great a man at such a crisis in<br />
his own life. The lesson, I'm afraid, is still to be learnt in<br />
my own country. It was also in that work that Nehru said that the measure<br />
of Indian progress would be the role India would give to her women.<br />
Your premiership, Madam Prime Minister, is certainly a striking<br />
symbol of that nrogresrs. Never in history has a woman faced so<br />
formidable a task and met that task with such skill and devotion.<br />
With the change of Government in Australia, my country<br />
loolks for a fresh apnroach and we hope, a more fruitful approach<br />
towards all our neighbours. I have indicated that we are seeking<br />
no sharp break with our past role but we are certainly not<br />
satisfied by all the aspects of the role Australia has played in<br />
the past. My Government could not, for instance, be content to<br />
maintain the old course of a generation of unthinking hostility<br />
towards China. Yet our policy is not by any means to place China at the<br />
centre of our afflairs: rather we seek to ratify the reality of </p>
<p>China as a significant member of the world community.<br />
We do not propose any radical change from our traditional<br />
close friendship with the United States: but wve now look for a<br />
more matiure, a give-and-take relationship. Again, w-. e will continue<br />
our very close friendship -with Britain: but we want a relationship<br />
based less on kin and more on kind namely on th-e basis tho, t we<br />
are tl.. o indep-endent nations of a kind, with common interests as<br />
well as common institutions.<br />
So I would want our developing policies to be seen more<br />
as an effort to remove anomalies rather than as a complete breaking<br />
with the past. This is particularly so in the case of India. The anomaly<br />
I find is this:-here are two great democracies bordering the<br />
Indian Ocean, both members of the Commonwealth, both deeply<br />
dedicated to world peace, both with Federal systems, both holding<br />
great institutions in common: and yet we haven't forged the very<br />
close relations I believe we should have.<br />
I profoundly believe that Australia has everything to<br />
gain by the closest possible co-operation with India. W4ith all<br />
that we hold in common there is no need for formal or written<br />
arrangements: our friendship need be no less enduring and.<br />
fruitful for that.<br />
Madam Prime Minister: Australia is proud to be as<br />
closely related with so great a nation, so remarkable a<br />
civilization, as India. Of course, our views sometimes </p>
<p>-6-<br />
perhaps our interests will not always coincide. I believe what<br />
both our countries seek is a relationship mature enough to<br />
acknowledge such differences and to discuss them freely whenever<br />
they arise. It is a deep honour you have done me, and my country, in<br />
inviting me to your country to help further, as assuredly we shall,<br />
that relationship." </p>
