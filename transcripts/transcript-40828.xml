    <content><![CDATA[<p>I look forward to welcoming His Excellency Li Keqiang, Premier of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China, and his wife Madame Cheng Hong to Australia from 22-26 March.</p>
<p>This visit will highlight Australia’s strong economic relationship with China and our mutual commitment to encouraging trade and investment in our region.</p>
<p>China is our largest trading partner, with two-way trade of $150 billion in 2016. The China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA) has greatly strengthened trade and investment between our two countries, driving growth and job creation. We continue to see record bilateral investment, education exchanges and a booming tourism sector with close to two million journeys between our two countries in 2016.</p>
<p>Both our economies are in the midst of important transitions, creating new opportunities for collaboration in services, innovation and investment. Premier Li and I will announce the next stage of ChAFTA’s evolution to respond to these emerging opportunities.</p>
<p>At our annual leaders’ meeting, we will speak frankly and constructively about maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. We will also discuss ways to strengthen our growing cooperation in a range of areas including energy, research and innovation, law enforcement, education, and tourism.</p>
<p>Lucy and I look forward to hosting Premier Li and Madame Cheng Hong in Canberra and Sydney.</p>
