    <content><![CDATA[<p>I will be in Japan, Korea and China. In all three countries I will be taking with me a delegation of very senior business leaders but in China I will be joined by the Trade and Investment Minister Andrew Robb who will, himself, be leading to Australia Week in China a delegation of over 700 business people from every part of the Australian business community.</p>
<p>What we need to understand is that trade means jobs. The wealth and the prosperity of our country â the growth and the future of our country â depends upon more and freer trade. That is what this trip really is all about â it is about more and freer trade because trade means jobs.</p>
<p>I should also say a word about the Western Australian Senate election today.</p>
<p>The only reason that the carbon tax and the mining tax are still in place is because Labor and the Greens are blocking the repeal legislation in the Senate.</p>
<p>If you want to get rid of these anti-Western Australian taxes, today, you have got to vote for candidates who are absolutely committed, unambiguously committed, to getting rid of these anti-Western Australian taxes and that means voting Liberal.</p>
<p>Send a strong message to Canberra. Send a strong message to the Labor Party â you canât say one thing in Perth and do the opposite in Canberra.</p>
<p>Thatâs my plea.</p>
<p>This election in Western Australia does matter. It is important for your future. It is important for the future of our country.</p>
