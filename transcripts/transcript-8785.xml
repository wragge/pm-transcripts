TEL: OFFICL OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CANOERHA 3/ 93<br />
STATEMENT FROM THE OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
The announcement today of a February 6 election in Western Australia is welcome.<br />
The people of Western Australia now have an opportunity to show their support for<br />
Premier Lawrence and her Government. They also have a chance to reject the divisive<br />
and confrontationist policies of the conservative parties.<br />
Voters in Western Australia should think twice before opting for a Liberal Party whose<br />
Federal President,, Mr Goldswortl, this week threatened to make life tougher and less<br />
secure for all Australians under Liberal regimes.<br />
Carmen Lawrence has attracted a high level of personal support in the State, reflecting her<br />
commitment and hard work on behalf of all Western Australians. She has served the State<br />
well, and should be given an opportunity to continue.<br />
