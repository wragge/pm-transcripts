TRANSCRIPT OF' SPEECH TO TRANSPORT WORKERS UNION FEDERAL COUT-HCIL<br />
9 MAY 1983<br />
First of all, thank you very much for the invitation which was<br />
extended to me to come along and open your Council Meeting. I<br />
apologise for taking a little bit long. There is a Cabinet<br />
meeting going and I have had to leave that a bit early. There<br />
are some matters I had to before leaving.<br />
The f irst thing I want to say is to emphasise to you the very<br />
fundamental course of the industry in which you and your members<br />
have evolved. I have always said that there is no part of our<br />
economy which is essentially more important, not only<br />
intrinsically, but in terms of the efficient functioning of -the<br />
rest of the economy, than the transport centre. At the la-test<br />
assessment transport, storage and communication constituted about<br />
14% of our gross national product and the transport industry is<br />
far away our biggest service industry. The ramification and<br />
visibility to our transport industry in relation to our geography<br />
and the distribution of our population is best illustrated<br />
perhaps by remembering the fact that about 80% of our total<br />
population lives in the triangle which goes from Brisbane to<br />
Adelaide to Hobart. Despite what some people say, Hobart is part<br />
of Australia, and we certainly believe it is, although others attimes<br />
seem to suggest that it is not. Now 80% of our population<br />
lives in that triangle, but in terms of the land mass of<br />
Australia, that triangle represents about 10% of our land mass,<br />
with 80% of the population Ithere, so you have the situation where<br />
a concentration of your services to some extent in that triangle<br />
to provide about 80% of the population, and yet because we are so<br />
vast and something like 20% of our population are living in about<br />
there are a valid setL-of problems which relate to the<br />
provision of adequate services to the rest of our population.<br />
That emphasises the importance of the economics of the transport<br />
industry. We have come into Government with a clear understanding<br />
of the importance of your industry and we are committed as a<br />
Government, to promoting an efficient and equitable natioa<br />
transport system, which is going to be related to those facts that<br />
I have alluded to. Vie are committed, as I say, to creative<br />
consultations with the State Governments who also have responsibility-.<br />
in this area and certainly with the Tribunal and with relevant<br />
emi Jd?&amp; r organisations equitable, safe, reliable and<br />
convenient transport system and one which is going to pursue the<br />
national objectives of efficiency i~ n a socially effective w-. ay.<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>There are some things that we have already done in the very short<br />
period that we have been in office. We have indicated our<br />
commitments to these objectives. You will appreciate that just<br />
in the last week or so we have injected an amount of about<br />
$ 265 million into QANTAS, TAA and into the Australian National<br />
Line. I am sure that our acts in that regard would meet with your<br />
philosophical commitments to the view that there i~ s an important<br />
place in our overall national transport system for a public<br />
proposal. We will also be directing our attention to the<br />
establishment: of a National Airport Authority and we will give<br />
a national enquiry into the Rosebud Transport Industry. We will<br />
also be looking towards the establishment of an Interstate<br />
Commission to investigate discrimination i~ n pricing, anomalies<br />
and inefficiencies in interstate transport.<br />
Now, I trust that in those introductory comments I have done two<br />
things. First, to get clearly in your minds our appreciation of<br />
the importance of your industry. You are ostensibly representing<br />
the interests of workers in an industry which is important in<br />
itself, and as I say, the efficiency of which very largely<br />
determines how efficient our overall on this operation is<br />
going to be. Secondly, I trust that I have established in your<br />
minds that already, in the short time since we have been in office,<br />
that we have done things already, directing our attention to issues<br />
which are important to your industry and therefore of interest to<br />
your members.<br />
There are unfortunately 2 other things that I have to refer to.<br />
Firstly, you will understand that we have inherited a budgetary<br />
situation imposing very, very considerable constraints upon thecapacity,<br />
that we as a Government have to do all the things that we<br />
would like to do. It can't be repeated toe often, that we were<br />
led to believe, and you and your members were led to believe that<br />
the sort of budgetary situation that we would be looking at in<br />
1983/ 84 would be a deficit of the order of $ 6 billion. That was<br />
one of the great and most deliberate deceptions that has ever been<br />
practised upon the people of this country since the history of<br />
Federation. In fact, those previous Government leaders, who were<br />
saying to the people of Australia during the election campaign,<br />
that there would be a budget deficiL to the order of $ 6 billion,<br />
knew and knew clearly, that it was very, very much more than that.<br />
In fact they knew at the highest stage of the election campaign<br />
that the deficit that we could contain in the forthcoming financial<br />
year without any change in existing programs, would be about<br />
$ 9.6 billion. Now, it would be nice for -the Government t~ o believe<br />
that we just have an over-extended budgetary de ficit stain<br />
That you can go on doing all the things that have been done,<br />
introduce all the new programs that you want, and on the revenue<br />
side, niot impose any more charges, but just let the deficit blow<br />
out without limit. Now, unfortunately, that doesn't represent the<br />
facts of life. There are limits to.... if you don't limit the<br />
size of the budget deficit then there are three economic results<br />
which inevitably follow. </p>
<p>3<br />
One is that to finance an unlimited budget deficit you have to<br />
sell Government paper and this is like, simply..... out and if<br />
they do, that imposes very heavy burdens, most of all upon the<br />
people who represent the people on the lower and middle income<br />
levels who suffer most as interest rates blow out. It is also<br />
associated with significant increases in inflation, and again,<br />
the wealthier sections of the commiunity have a relatively much<br />
greater capacity to look after themselves in that sort of<br />
situation, than the people that you represent, who suffer most<br />
if there are rising interest rates, but also rising inflation.<br />
The third economic consequence is, of course, that you start to<br />
have unbearable pressures upon the So, I simply say to you<br />
that the Government has inherited such a deceptive mess, then we<br />
have to change policies in the things that we are able to do.<br />
Having said that, let me say before I go on to the other areas that<br />
you expect me to speak to you about, that we have been engaged in<br />
the very few weeks since we have been in Government in undertaking<br />
a detailed review of the budgetary situation in Australia. We have<br />
looked at, and are still looking at a whole range of expenditure<br />
programs that we inherited. We are looking at the area of<br />
taxation expenditure. In economist jargon we are talking about<br />
those concessions which are available to the taxpayers, which over<br />
the years in a way which has always concerned itself to the<br />
considerations of equity and giving information to those who are<br />
most in need. Also, of course, you have inflation. Now we<br />
are doing that, not simply for the sake of acquiring knowledge, as<br />
satisfying as that may be, but we agree that we have a real<br />
responsibility in terms of the electoral mandate given on 5 March,<br />
to move as quickly as we can to implement policies which are going<br />
to get the economy moving in general, and particularly to start to<br />
generate more jobs and so, within a couple of weeks, we will be<br />
introducing into the Parliament of Australia a statement which will<br />
be directed towards achieving those ends. We can start to see<br />
without waiting that it is quite artificial saying all this when<br />
you have then got a Budget to see what things can be done<br />
immediately to try and keep the economy moving to provide more jobs.<br />
Now, obviously in that context the question of what happens to the<br />
claims from all sections of the community upon our resources is<br />
important. As far as you are concerned, the question of wages 3is<br />
important. Noone is more conscious than I am of the need to get<br />
equity in terms of restraint and indeed in the Parliament at tile<br />
end of last year, when we were in Opposition, we said, in Opposition<br />
that the Government's approach then it wasn't sufficient just to<br />
be looking and called upon wage and salary earners to exercise<br />
restraint, when nothing was being done at all in other areas. So<br />
we promised in the election campaign that our Government would move<br />
towards trying to ensure that greater equity was operating in this<br />
economy as the mood to 83 to that the necessary restraint<br />
was exercised throughout the community. That was essentially at<br />
the core of the Economic Summit proceedings which we had on the<br />
week commencing 11 April. We recognise the Government continue<br />
to recognise that if we are going, as a community, to be able to<br />
move, to get the economy moving to create more jobs, then this<br />
restraint has to be exercised during 1983 and the sorts of things<br />
that we are doing are to create the Economic Planning Advisory<br />
Council and we will be moving also to establish the prices<br />
surveillance mechanism. I have also written to the companies of </p>
<p>-4<br />
Australia to ask that they exercise restraint in dividend payments<br />
and in emoluments and perquisities of directors in the cream<br />
positions of the top companies. We are in respect of<br />
professional incomes approaching all. professional associations -to<br />
ask if they agree voluntarily to the restraints exercised within<br />
the mechanisms of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and<br />
I can assure you that the policies we will adopt in our May<br />
statement and the August Budget, at the fiscal level, will be<br />
directed towards trying to achieve equity, so no inflative<br />
capacity in the community to make a contribution we will be<br />
making it compared to those with the least capacity. S&amp; it was<br />
quite unequivocably that the major mission of our Government is to<br />
who do not have jobs. -Those of you, as representatives of peovile w'hc<br />
are in employment, we want you, as people....... to share with mny<br />
Government that our major commitment is to those who do not have the<br />
luxury in these circumstances of employment. Our major objective<br />
is to take the direction to create more jobs and we want you to<br />
share our with us. Now, I have made it clear, that that does<br />
not mean that we are looking endlessly at a wage freeze. I hav., e<br />
made it quite clear at discussions in the Sunmmit and the statemeint<br />
that was produced that we will go into a National Wage Case later on<br />
in this year with a view to some movement in the later part of<br />
year and that 1984 as providing the basis for indexation full<br />
indexation because it is quite clear that the absence of any<br />
centralised wage fixing system from July 81. gives a situation in<br />
which the whole impetus of %.. age determination in this country broke<br />
down . Those who did have the power were going to be able to get<br />
their position rosier and, of course, those without jobs at all were<br />
in the worst possible position of all and so, I say to you that i do<br />
hope that this great union, one which association with the<br />
Labor Movement going back a very long way at Federal and State level<br />
and which can associate itself with a Government which you know is<br />
committed to the welfare to those in the community who most need it.<br />
There is no other issue which is more important than that and I ask<br />
you to remember that in the last 12 months we have been in..<br />
about million in the level. of unemployed. There is, this day,<br />
out there in Austral~ ia at the very minimum, official figures,<br />
million of our fellow Australians unemployed that is about' one<br />
in three of our kids between the ages of 15 and 19 who want a job<br />
one in three of them can't get a job there has been simply no<br />
objective of the whole Labor Movement -political and industrial<br />
which is more important, in our judgement, than taking decisions<br />
which are going to increase the possibility of That's going t~ o<br />
require on the part Members of Parliament, people whowok<br />
people in professions, it is going to require all. of us to<br />
exercise restraint. I come here as Prime Minister of this Labor<br />
Government, not asking you for something which is unreasonable. I<br />
say this specifically in regard to the Prices and Incomes Accord<br />
because there are sections of that Prices and Incomes Accord which<br />
are very important principles. I think it is a travesty of justice<br />
that in 1983 we haven't in this country a national industrial<br />
health and safety code. That you can have a situation where so<br />
many working men and women are losing their lives because we<br />
haven't got a code. We are moving now that an integral part of </p>
<p>what you agree with the Prices and incomes Accord. I have<br />
directed all the Ministers to go through the Prices and Incomes<br />
Accord in regard to all the areas and we have agreed that<br />
things ought to be done democracy that we move immediately.<br />
They are not being put on the back burners . The Government is<br />
doing all the things, are moving to do all the things that the<br />
Trade Union Movement in discussions with us has regarded as<br />
appropriate trying to lift the working environment within<br />
Australia, which your members operate in, so I do put it to You<br />
that in the situation where you have got a Government who<br />
understands the real needs of your membership and overwhelmingly<br />
understands the need to create more jobs so that we can start to<br />
create a more equitable society, you will be prepared as an<br />
integrally important union in consultation with us, I am not sayig<br />
it imposingly, but in consultation with us, in the mechanisms that<br />
we will establish, as a result of the discussions we have in the<br />
Labor Movement when wve were in Opposition and now in Government,<br />
that you will play your part in assisting us in getting the<br />
economny moving at a higher level of activity to create more jobs<br />
those that are desperately needed. These are overall objectives<br />
but there can't be anything more important, I pledge to you<br />
without hesitation that, in all that we do we will be consulting<br />
with you, that we will also be consulting with those employers, So<br />
that we can get, as far as possible, the best input from all of you<br />
to the decisions that we take. While it may he a little bit<br />
to have to exercise that restraint in 1983, I want to put to you<br />
that the signs are there now, that the economy is about to turn<br />
round, not only as a result of what is happening in this country,<br />
but as a result also of some of the signs of increasing<br />
activity overseas and, of course, something drought,<br />
something that is going to give considerable impetus in many ways<br />
in this country. So please, I do plead with you, to identify<br />
yourselves with that broad program and noble objectives that we<br />
have with the Trade Union Movement to cooperate with us in that<br />
way. we were asking for restraint capacity for exercising<br />
restraint and we can be looking for a sprinkling economy to move in<br />
the next year and beyond and that will give us an economy in which<br />
we will have a real capacity of not only to maintain, but to<br />
improve the standards of living of all people in this community and<br />
to do it in a way which provides equally to those who are in the<br />
greatest need. . Until. those things, and I do have confidence that<br />
you will respond profitably to what I am putting to you. I have<br />
very much pleasure and again thank you for being here..... </p>
