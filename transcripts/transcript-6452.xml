SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER AT THE FIJIAN WELCOMING CEREMONY<br />
29 AUGUST 1984<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
APPRECIATE THE FINE WELCOME WHICH HAS GREETED ME HERE TODAY.<br />
THE SOUTH PACIFIC HAS A WELL-REGARDED REPUTATION FOR<br />
MAKING THE TRAVELLER FEEL WELCOME, AND THE PEOPLE OF FIJI<br />
ARE NO EXCEPTION. THE SPLENDOUR OF THIS CEREMONY IS A TRIBUTE<br />
TO THE WARM-HEARTED GENEROSITY OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS GREAT<br />
ISLAND NATION.<br />
I AM PARTICULARLY HONOURED BY THE PRESENTATION OF THIS FINE<br />
TABUA. I WOULD PARTICULARLY LIKE TO THANK THE SCHOOL PUPILS OF<br />
RATU KADAVU LEVU AND ADI CAKOBAU. I AM VERY IMPRESSED THAT BY<br />
THEIR PARTICIPATION OF THIS FINE AND DIGNIFIED CEREMONY TODAY<br />

<p>1A.<br />
IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU HERE IN<br />
SUVA TODAY.<br />
IT IS ALMOST A YEAR AGO THAT I HAD THE HONOUR OF WELCOMING<br />
YOU, MR PRIME MINISTER, TO AUSTRALIA FOR THE CANBERRA SOUTH<br />
PACIFIC FORUM.<br />
I AM ESPECIALLY PLEASED THAT I AM IN FiJI VIRTUALLY WITHIN<br />
THE YEAR.<br />
MR PRIME MINISTER, WE HAVE BOTH JUST COME FROM TUVALU WHERE<br />
WE BOTH ENJOYED THE WARMTH OF HOSPITALITY OF THE TUVALUAN<br />
GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE.<br />
Now I HAVE THE IMMENSE PLEASURE OF EXPERIENCING FIJI'S.<br />
IN TUVALU . WE HAD THE<br />
OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS A WIDE AND VARIED RANGE OF SUBJECTS<br />
OF IMPORTANCE TO THE REGION. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE RESUMPTION<br />
OF OUR TALKS THIS AFTERNOON.<br />
WVIE IN AUSTRALIA BELIEVE THAT OUR FUTURE LIES WITH THE<br />
ASIA/ PACIFIC REGION.<br />
/ 2s </p>
<p>2.<br />
4/ LY . REOGN ISE' T1T-. " E,-WE A. REA7 JEAL TO CO TRI" U'TE<br />
TO THE REGION AND WILL ERY LI KELY BE SUB ST ANTIALLY AFFECTED<br />
BY REGIONAL DEVELOPMENTS, IT IS VERY MUCH IN THE INTERESTS<br />
OF ALL OF US WITHIN THE REGION THAT WE CONSOLIDATE THE<br />
CONDITIONS OF EFFECTIVE REGIONAL ( CO-OPERATION. THE TASK OF<br />
IDENTIFYING REGIONAL SOLUTIONS TO REGIONAL PROBLEMS IS AMONG<br />
OUR MOST IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITIES.<br />
AS WAS VERY APPARENT AT OUR LATEST MEETING IN TUVALU, THE<br />
SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM GIVES THE COUNTRIES OF THE REGION THE<br />
OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS IN A FRIENDLY AND INFORMAL WAY, MATTERS<br />
OF MUTUAL CONCERN. IT ENABLES US TO REACH A BETTER UNDERSTANDING<br />
OF EACH OTHER'S POSITION ON THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OF ISSUES<br />
RANGING FROM SECURITY CONCERNS TO SOCIAL WELFARE. IT ALSO<br />
PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS A VIEW OF DEVELOPMENTS<br />
WHICH DIRECTLY AFFECT US ALL.<br />
I THOUGHT THE EXPRESSION OF GRAVE CONCERN BY ALL THE SOUTH<br />
PACIFIC LEADERS AT THE PERSISTENCE BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT<br />
IN THEIR PROGRAM OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS TESTING IN THE PACIFIC<br />
DESPITE THE LONG-STANDING PROTESTS OF THE GOVERNMENTS AND<br />
PEOPLES OF THE REGION WAS A MOST VISIBLE DEMONSTRATION OF<br />
A SHARED, DEEPLY FELT REGIONAL ANXIETY.<br />
IT IS SIMPLY NOT ACCEPTABLE TO US, THE COUNTRIES OF THE<br />
SOUTH PACIFIC, THAT THE FRENCH SHOULD BE USING THE SOUTH<br />
PACIFIC CUR O,' N PRECIOUS E;, V! ROW" EMT IN THEIR EFFORTS TO<br />
PERFECT WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION,<br />
S. 1/ 3. </p>
<p>3.<br />
AusT AL: A, FOR ITS PAR'T, HA'S SUS'Pfl -DIDSl -I P., rS-OF U '* AIN 1i.<br />
TO FRANCE AS EVIDlU CE OF OUR CCHIT iU; D CONCERN OVER THIS<br />
TESTING, EXTENSIVE AND IMPORTANT DISCUSSIONS ALSO TOOK PLACE AT THE<br />
FORUM ON THE CONCEPT OF A SOUTH PACIFIC NUCLEAR FREE ZONE,<br />
THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS.<br />
THE DECISION TO ESTABLISH A WORKING GROUP TO TAKE FURTHER<br />
THE DRAFT SET OF PRINCIPLES ON SUCH A ZONE AND TO REPORT TO<br />
FORUM GOVERNMENTS IS A VERY USEFUL STEP FORWARD.<br />
IT WILL ENABLE FURTHER ELABORATION OF THE CONCEPT ON THE<br />
BASIS OF CONSENSUS BETWEEN COUNTRIES. IN THIS WAY THE<br />
INTERESTS OF ALL WILL BE FULLY REPRESENTED IN THE PROPOSALS,<br />
MOST IMPORTANTLY IT SHOULD PRODUCE A CONCRETE AND REALISTIC<br />
PROPOSAL WHICH CAN BE PRESENTED CONFIDENTLY TO THE INTERNATIONAL<br />
COMMUNITY AT LARGE.<br />
IT IS MY PROFOUND CONVICTION THAT WE, THE COUNTRIES OF THE<br />
REGION, MUST DO WHAT WE CAN, USE WHAT INFLUENCE WE HAVE, TO<br />
REDUCE THE DREADFUL THREAT OF NUCLEAR WAR,<br />
I'E CANNOT LEAVE IT TO THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS STATES ALONE TO<br />
DETERMINE ALL ACTION IN THESE AREAS, WlE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY<br />
BEFORE OUR PEOPLE TO BE HEARD ON THESE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES,<br />
g </p>
<p>-GOVE. RNMENT-HAS GIVEN ITS FULL SUPPORT FOR TH. E NUCLEAR.<br />
T<br />
. R -PROLI ATiO: TREATY. THAT TREATY I N CUR VIEW,, IS THE<br />
MOST IMPORTANT MULTILATERAL NON-PROLIFERATION AND ARMS<br />
CONTROL AGREEMENT IN EXISTENCE. NATIONALLY WE ARE DOING<br />
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO STRENGTHEN INTERNATIONAL ADHERENCE<br />
TO THE TREATY.<br />
CERTAINLY AUSTRALIA REJECTS CATEGORICALLY ANY NUCLEAR WEAPONS<br />
OPTION FOR ITSELF,<br />
THE NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY ALSO SPECIFICALLY AFFIRMS<br />
THE RIGHT OF ALL COUNTRIES TO USE NUCLEAR ENERGY FOR PEACEFUL<br />
PURPOSES. IT REQUIRES THOSE COUNTRIES IN A POSITION TO DO SO<br />
TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR ENERGY IN<br />
MEMBER COUNTRIES WHICH WISH TO USE THIS SOURCE OF ENERGY<br />
FOR PEACEFUL PURPOSES.<br />
ACCORDINGLY, UNDER THE TREATY, AUSTRALIA HAS A DOUBLE OBLIGATION:<br />
-TO WORK TOWARD DISARMAMENT, AND TO SHARE RELEVANT<br />
RESOURCES WITH THOSE COMMITTED TO THE USE OF NUCLEAR<br />
ENERGY FOR PEACEFUL PURPOSES,<br />
OUR POSITION AS A MAJOR URANIUM PRODUCER IS VERY RELEVANT IN<br />
THIS REGARD.<br />
IT WOULD BE EASY TO TAKE THE SOFT OPTION, SELECTIVELY, TO ADOPT<br />
A PASSIVE ATTITUDE TO THOSE CBLIGATIONS OF THE TREATY WHICH<br />
MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO SHOULDER, </p>
<p>WE WILL NOT DO SO,<br />
ONLY THROUGH CONSISTENT AND DETERMINED EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN<br />
AND STRENGTHEN THE TREATY IN ALL ITS ASPECTS ARE WE LIKELY<br />
TO ENSURE THAT THE SPREAD OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IS PREVENTED,<br />
IT IS OUR PARTICULAR HOPE THAT ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE<br />
SOUTH PACIFIC, THROUGH THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE NUCLEAR<br />
NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY AND THE SOUTH PACIFIC NUCLEAR FREE<br />
ZONE, WILL MAINTAIN THE SOUTH PACIFIC AS AN AREA WHERE<br />
NEIGHBOURS CAN LIVE TOGETHER IN PEACE AND HARMONY.<br />
IN OUR SHARED REGIONAL PURSUIT OF THESE GOALS, FORMAL AND<br />
INFORMAL SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS, PARTICULARLY THE ANZUS ALLIANCE,<br />
MUST CONTINUE NOW, AS IN THE PAST, TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS OF THE VIEW, AND I KNOW THAT THIS<br />
VIEW IS SHARED BY FIJI, THAT IT IS VITAL IN OUR EFFORTS TO<br />
ENHANCE FURTHER THE SECURITY AND STABILITY OF THE REGION, THAT<br />
WE NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACTORS WHICH HAVE WORKED TO OUR<br />
COLLECTIVE ADVANTAGE FOR NEARLY FOUR DECADES.<br />
IN THIS REGARD I CAN CLEARLY STATE THAT AUSTRALIA WILL CONTINUE<br />
TO WELCOME SHIP VISITS BY OUR ALLIES. I AM PLEASED,<br />
MR PRIME MINISTER, THAT FIJI SHARES THE SAME VIEW,<br />
WE INEED TO PRESS FOR A MORE OPEN AlrD EQUITABLE INTERNATIONAL<br />
TRADING SYSTEM IN WHICH THE MAJOR TRADING COUNTRIES W'' ILL ALLOW<br />
US LESS RESTRICTED ACCESS TO THEIR MARKETS, PARTICULARLY IN<br />
THE AREA OF AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES.<br />
,16. </p>
<p>I KNOW TH. T Fiji AS A PA. RTICULAR I N ER" ST H ERE I1 THE S UGAR<br />
TRADE, AND I AI SURE THAT FOR YOU., AS FOR US, THE COLLAPSE<br />
OF THE INTERNATIONAL SUGAR AGREEMENT NEGOTIATIONS SOME WEEKS<br />
AGO HAS CAUSED CONCERN,<br />
As A NEW ROUND OF MULTILATERAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS MIGHT BE<br />
STARTED BEFORE MUCH LONGER, WE IN THE REGION SHOULD, AS I<br />
SUGGESTED LAST ' YEAR, BE CONSIDERING HOW WE MIGHT REGISTER<br />
MOST EFFECTIVELY IN THE MINDS OF THE MAJOR TRADING NATIONS<br />
THE INTERESTS WHICH WE SHARE AS COUNTRIES OF THE REGION,<br />
TOO OFTEN IN THE PAST OUR CONCERNS HAVE BEEN PUSHED ASIDE.<br />
AUSTRALIA WILL SUPPORT A NEW ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS ONLY IF<br />
IT SERIOUSLY AND EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSES OUR SPECIAL CONCERNS<br />
AND THE CONCERNS OF OUR NEIGHBOURS,<br />
WE CONSIDER IT TO BE OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO THE COUNTRIES OF<br />
THE REGION THAT THE PROTECTIONIST TRENDS OF THE RECENT YEARS<br />
OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC RECESSION BE REVERSED,<br />
AUSTRALIA HAS, I BELIEVE, A PARTICULAR ROLE TO PLAY IN<br />
CONTRIBUTING TO THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF THE REGION. AS A<br />
PARTNER IN DEVELOPMENT WE CAN HELP STIMULATE ECONOMIC GROWTH,<br />
ENHANCE TRADE PROSPECTS AND ENCOURAGE SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT<br />
WITHIN THE REGION. </p>
<p>TO THIS END HAVE GIVEN THE REGION TIHE HIGHEST PRIORITY<br />
IN OUR OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM1' E ARE<br />
CO: I;' ITTED TO PROVIDING1 $ 0 MILLION IN AID TO THE SOUTH<br />
PACIFIC IN THE 5 YEAR PERIOD TO 1987/ 88. INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY<br />
PROGRAMS ARE BEING DEVELOPED ACCORDING TO PRIORITIES SET BY.<br />
RESPECTIVE INATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND ADMINISTERED W ITH THE<br />
GREATEST POSSIBLE FLEXIBILITY,<br />
UNDER OUR DEFENCE CO-OPERATION PROGRAM, WE PROVIDE MILITARY<br />
AS WELL AS POLICE TRAINING.<br />
TO ASSIST IN ECONOMIC GROWTH WE HAVE PROVIDED ENLARGED TRADING<br />
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRODUCTS OF THE COUNTRIES OF THE REGION<br />
THROUGH THE SPARTECA TRADE AGREEMENT. I'E ARE AWARE THAT SOME<br />
COUNTRIES, INCLUDING FIJI, ARE NOT HAPPY WITH ASPECTS OF THE<br />
OPERATION OF SPARTECA, ESPECIALLY IN THE RULES OF ORIGIN<br />
PROVISIONS AND ALSO WITH APPAREL, . WE HAVE THEREFORE ESTABLISHED<br />
WORKING GROUPS AIMED AT RESOLVING THESE DIFFICULTIES AND WILL<br />
EXTEND FOR A FURTHER YEAR THE " SEED" QUOTA FOR APPAREL.<br />
AT THE AUSTRALIAN MARKETING END WE HAVE ALSO ASSISTED THE<br />
ACTIVITIES OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC TRADE COMMISSIONER IN SYDNEY<br />
AND HAVE EXTENDED A'RANGE OF MARKETING ADVISORY SERVICES TO<br />
-ASSIST ISLAND PRODUCERS TO DEVELOP AN AUSTRALIAN MARKET,<br />
FIJI HAS A TRADE IMBALANCE WITH AUSTRALIA BROUGHT ABOUT IN PART<br />
BY YOUR IMPORTS OF FUEL AND FUEL PRODUCTS. BECAUSE OF THIS<br />
FACTOR, A TRADE IMTA1.-LANCE IS VIRTUALLY INEVITABLE: AUSTRALIA<br />
TOO RUNS A BILATERAL TRADE IIMBALANCE WITH THOSE NATIONS FROM<br />
VWHOM SOURCE THE BULK OF OUR OIL IMPORTS,<br />
,/ 8 </p>
<p>IT IS PLEASING., HOWEVER., TO'SEE THAT YOUR EXPORTS TO<br />
AU STRALIA HA ; C7:, A3J) 3D Y 1' ER 50 CE[; T I LAST<br />
TWO YEARS AND THAT EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE IMBALANCE ARE<br />
CONTINUING ON BOTH SIDES.<br />
A FURTHER ASPECT OF FIJI's BALANCE OF PAYMENTS SHOULD BE<br />
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN ASSESSING BILATERAL PAYMENTS BETWEEN<br />
NATIONS IN THE INVISIBLES ACCOUNT. ONE OF THE MAJOR ITEMS<br />
IN THIS ACCOUNT IS EARNINGS FROM TOURISM, AUSTRALIAN<br />
TOURISTS CONTRIBUTE VERY SIGNIFICANTLY TO FIJI's EARNINGS.<br />
THE CO-OPERATION BETWEEN OUR AIRLINES QANTAS AND AIR PACIFIC<br />
IN JOINTLY PROMOTING FIJI AND THE REGION AS A HOLIDAY<br />
DESTINATION FOR AUSTRALIANS HAS BEEN A MAJOR SUCCESS, AND I<br />
HAVE EVERY EXPECTATION THAT FIJI WILL CONTINUE TO BE A MUCH<br />
SOUGHT-AFTER OVERSEAS HOLIDAY DESTINATION FOR AUSTRALIANS.<br />
IT IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW MUTUAL CO-OPERATION TO<br />
ACHIEVE A COMMON OBJECTIVE CAN BENEFIT BOTH OUR COUNTRIES.<br />
MR PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIA AND FIJI SHARE MANY COMMON OBJECTIVES AND ASPIRATIONS.<br />
WE ARE BOTH PART OF A REGION WHICH WE WISH TO SEE CONTINUE<br />
AS AN AREA OF PEACE, PROSPERITY AND POLITICAL STABILITY, </p>
<p>' E HAVE A PARTNERSHIP BASED ON MIU TUAL RESPECT AND<br />
U'. DE3RS TAI DING. IT IS A PARTE: RSHIlP HICHI CAN IN THE<br />
FUTURE ONLY DEVELOP TO OUR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE AND TO THE<br />
ADVANTAGE OF OUR REGION.<br />
I CAN ASSURE YOU AUSTRALIA REGARDS THIS COMlMITMENT AS AMONG<br />
ITS MOST IMPORTANT. E WILL CONTINUE TO DO EVERYTHING WE<br />
CAN TO ASSURE THE MAINTENANCE OF CONDITIONS THAT WILL ALLOW<br />
THIS PARTNERSHIP TO FLOURISH. </p>
