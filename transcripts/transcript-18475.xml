The Prime Minister today expressed her condolences at the passing of Senator Judith Adams.</p>
<p>Senator Adams, Coalition Deputy Whip, was a representative who brought a depth and breadth of life experience to the Parliament. She had friends across traditional party lines, and her absence will be keenly felt by her colleagues of all political persuasions.</p>
<p>Our thoughts are with her family and friends at this difficult time.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, I pay tribute to Senator Adams for her contribution to public life, and offer our condolences to those she loved.  </p>
