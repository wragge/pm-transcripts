PRIME MINISTER Press Statement ' No. 177<br />
23 January 1974<br />
TARIFFS ON DOMESTIC APPLIANCES<br />
' he Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, today announced<br />
details of the Government's acceptance, with minor variations,<br />
of the report of the Tariff Baord ( now Industries Assistance<br />
Commission) on domestic appliances, heating and cooling<br />
equipment, etc.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that in general, the Tariff Board<br />
has recommended a tariff duty of 25% for the goods under reference.<br />
However, there are several exceptions to this whereby some products<br />
will be subject to a duty of 20 per cent and others 35 per cent.<br />
Generally, these recommendations provide for the existing tariff<br />
rates for a number of goods to be reduced significantly. The<br />
Board has stated that evidence supplied by local manufacturers<br />
and other information indicate that major economies could be<br />
achieved by re-organising production activities. These economies<br />
( coupled in many cases with substantial natural advantages) would<br />
allow the industries to operate profitably and probably to command<br />
a larger market under reduced levels of protection. More efficient<br />
production would also provide substantial national benefits.<br />
Because the protective situation which applied until<br />
recently offered few inducements to change, the Board has recommended<br />
duty levels designed to encourage a better use of-resources while<br />
providing adequate protection for the more efficient producers.<br />
The better use of resources and the lower levels of protection should<br />
bring * siqnifi cantly reduced prices to consumers ( including most home<br />
owners) as well as general economic benefits to the community as a<br />
whole. Mr. Whitlam indicated that the industries covered by this<br />
report include the second major consumer products sector of the<br />
economy to be reviewed recently by the Government. ( The first<br />
was the consumer electronic equipment and components industry.) / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Goods covered by this latest report are wide ranging and<br />
are of major importance to Australian consumers in that many are<br />
now ' necessities' and constitute substantial investments for<br />
most Australian home owners. They include refrigerators, washing<br />
machines, clothes dryers, freezers, dish washing machines, ranges<br />
ovens, and small stoves ( commonly referred to as whitegoods);<br />
certain refrigeration components, air conditioners and commercial<br />
refrigeration; portable appliances such as toasters, irons, kettles,<br />
etc., and water heaters and space heaters.<br />
The Government has decided not to accept the precise<br />
recommendations of the Tariff Board in respect of a suggested deferral<br />
of some duty reductions for two years. Instead, it has decided to<br />
phase-in the duty reductions over the two year period, beginning with<br />
an immediate reduction and further reductions in 12 months and 2 years<br />
hence. This will enable firms to be subjected to a more gradual<br />
increase in competitive pressures and encourage them to undertake<br />
the necessary re-organisation at an early date. The present high<br />
level of consumer demand both here and overseas and the resultant<br />
pressure for higher levels of production will ease adjustments in<br />
the industry. The Government has accepted the Board's recommendation<br />
that a bounty be paid on the production and sale in Australia of<br />
sealed compressors of 1.5kw or less because of the importance<br />
of compressors as components in the manufacture of refriger'ators<br />
and room air conditioners. The payment of bounty will provide local<br />
regrigerator and air conditioner manufacturers with the immediate<br />
advantage of lower prices for an important component and thereby<br />
assist them to prepare for the reduced level of protection on their<br />
appliances. Mr. Whitlam said that details of the customs tariff changes<br />
arising from the Government's decision will be announced when<br />
administrative arrangements to implement them have been finalised.<br />
In accepting the Tariff Board's recoupindatkons, the<br />
Government has decided that assistance will be made available to<br />
firms and employees who may be disadvantaged by the proposed tariff<br />
changes. Details of assistance and eligibility will be announced<br />
after the completion of the Government's general consideration of<br />
adjustment assistance principles. If necessary, interim assistance<br />
arrangements will be implemented.<br />
