PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF TIHE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
DOORSTOP, AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL, 26 AUGUST 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Given the AS situation at the moment, is there any need to change interest rates?<br />
PM: The markets arc big enough and ugly enough to look after themselves. But I think<br />
it's incumbent upon a few of you people in the media to reflect upon other things.<br />
That is, what we've just seen there is one of the symbols of Australia at war, a war<br />
which was entirely material in changing the course of Australia's history. And the<br />
media has got a long term remit as well as the very day to day rcmit in reflecting<br />
upon thesc things, the things that make up the nation and not just to be dismissed<br />
in the daily hurly burly of picasing your producers or your news directors.<br />
J: But the markets don't. Just how long can the Reserve keep propping up the dollar?<br />
PM: Well obviously what I've just said has made no impact on you whatsoever. It's<br />
gone straight over the shoulder, hasn't it?<br />
J: Aren't wc fighting another sort of war though, at the moment a sort of financial<br />
war to kccp our end up?<br />
PM: Oh, I doubt it, I doubt it, I doubt it.<br />
J: So you are confident that you won't have to take action on interest rates?<br />
PM: Wcll the markets arc, as I said, big enough and ugly enough to look after<br />
themselves.<br />
J: And how long will the Reserve stay there propping up the dollar?<br />
PM: Wcll, you know, I've got nothing more to say about that than that.<br />
J: Should the gold pass system be modified to stop rorts? </p>

21<br />
PM: I don't know. Look, nothing of MPs entitlemecnts should evcr be abused,<br />
obviously. But to say that says it all. I mean it's not an issue of major national<br />
momcnl, is it?<br />
3: And is it being abused?<br />
PM: Well, I haven't seen the report.<br />
J: Will you be spending any time in Queensland hclping out Waync Goss in the<br />
campaign?<br />
PM: Well, as I go there in the normal course of my duties, yes.<br />
