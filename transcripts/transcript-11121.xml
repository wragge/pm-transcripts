<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>Good morning John, good to be with you.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>And John Howard has been laying the official wreath on behalf of the</p>
<p> Commonwealth government. Very moving, going into the shrine on ANZAC</p>
<p> Day.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, this is the first ANZAC day dawn service I've attended in</p>
<p> Melbourne. I've tried in each of the years since I've been</p>
<p> Prime Minister to be in a different location, and this year I wanted</p>
<p> to come to Melbourne. It's a beautiful shrine. Of all of the</p>
<p> shrines in the State capitals around Australia it's hard to beat</p>
<p> it. It's very impressive. It is very dignified in the approach,</p>
<p> and the layout of the gardens around it is very conducive to, I guess,</p>
<p> a focus on what it's about.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>And in public life Prime Minister, you must have been attending ANZAC</p>
<p> Day ceremonies in one capacity or another for a very long time. I'm</p>
<p> sure you, as many others have remarked on the change, in the significance</p>
<p> of it. In the psyche of.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh the way it's come back. Well it had never gone but there was</p>
<p> a period when, I first entered Parliament in 1974. 1975 was the first</p>
<p> ANZAC Day I attended as a Member of Parliament. I'd been on many</p>
<p> other occasions as a citizen because my dad had been in World War</p>
<p> I and I used to go and watch ANZAC marches in Sydney when I was a</p>
<p> kid very regularly. But there was a time in the 70s where people were</p>
<p> starting to say: oh it will eventually die out. But there has been</p>
<p> a reclaiming of it by the younger generations of Australia.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There's a combination of reasons. There's a growing interest</p>
<p> in the history of our country as we get towards celebrating a hundred</p>
<p> years of federation. People are rediscovering what a remarkable country</p>
<p> it's been and what a remarkable contribution that it made. I</p>
<p> mean when you remember that in World War I for example, almost 400,000</p>
<p> Australians volunteered out of a total male population of little more</p>
<p> than 2.5 million, all ages. It was an astonishing response. When you</p>
<p> think that in all of that war it was an entirely volunteer army, and</p>
<p> except for fairly limited circumstances it was largely a volunteer</p>
<p> army in World War II as well. So people are rediscovering our history</p>
<p> and they're rediscovering that great sense of pride that people</p>
<p> have in all parts of our history, and not least the contribution that</p>
<p> people have made to defending this country and making it free.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>It was very fashionable to bag ANZAC Day, in the 70s in particular.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can remember....yeah, and the 60s and 70s. Well and also there</p>
<p> was, I say a piece by Alan Seymour the other day, who wrote that play</p>
<p> Â‘The One Day of the Year', which at the time created a lot</p>
<p> of controversy. It might now be seen in a slightly different light.</p>
<p> But it was. I mean a lot of people didn't share that bagging</p>
<p> but there were some who did. But all of that has now gone and there</p>
<p> is a rediscovered reverence for that to this day, and for the deeds</p>
<p> of Australian service men and women generally.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>And it's a day that brings Australians together like no other.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It certainly does.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>I mean just walking around since the dawn service this morning, and</p>
<p> talking to people. I would have had conversations now with Australians</p>
<p> of every possible age and generation, and every possible ethnic background.</p>
<p> People who have no personal family connections to Australian military</p>
<p> history but still feel compelled for what ever reason to come along</p>
<p> today.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I've had the same experience. I went and talked to all the</p>
<p> people who are having breakfast outside the barracks, and I would</p>
<p> have spent three-quarters-of-an-hour talking to them and I had exactly</p>
<p> the same experience. There were a lot people there obviously who'd</p>
<p> been in the war, children of people who'd been particularly in</p>
<p> World War II. But there were also a large number of people, as you</p>
<p> say, different ethnic backgrounds. Everybody sort of drawn as to a</p>
<p> magnet around this particular day. It was the one day, to use Seymour's</p>
<p> expression, it is the one day of the year that is very distinctively</p>
<p> unarguably Australian. Now that's not....I'm not saying</p>
<p> it's the only day of national importance to us but it has an</p>
<p> emotional pull and an impact on the Australian community and the Australian</p>
<p> psyche that none other has. And that's its special resonance,</p>
<p> and in a sense it's more important that we acknowledge that instead</p>
<p> of engaging in an endless search always as to why. I mean sometimes</p>
<p> with these things the acknowledgement of the significance of something</p>
<p> is as important as to why. But I mean there is obviously, for different</p>
<p> people there are different reasons. The people who were in the war</p>
<p> and who had loved ones in the war of course, it has a very special</p>
<p> resonance.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>It strikes me as you speak, that it's the sort of felling you</p>
<p> try to encapsulate in the preamble to a constitution for instance.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I won't talk about that today because there's a bit</p>
<p> of political debate about that and I have a golden rule on ANZAC Day</p>
<p> I never talk about anything that has any kind of party political....</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Not wanting to get into that but it is that feeling.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well ANZAC Day does have a very real feeling, very special feeling.</p>
<p> It's something that people believe belongs to Australia alone,</p>
<p> and it has an "Australianess" about it that none other has.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>We'll be talking later this morning to Mr Toma Bunjanin (sic)</p>
<p> who's the secretary of the first sub-branch of Serbian ex-servicemen</p>
<p> in Victoria. Made a point of some controversy, the Serbian ex-servicemen</p>
<p> will be marching here in Melbourne...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm very pleased about that.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>They're not marching in Sydney....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, well I mean....they are Australians of Serbian origin and they</p>
<p> were wonderful allies of the allies during World War II. I've</p>
<p> seen them for years in the marches in Sydney and I'm very pleased</p>
<p> indeed that they are marching here because they are first and foremost</p>
<p> citizens of Australia and the people who fought alongside the allies</p>
<p> during the war are an honoured part of that experience, and they are</p>
<p> an honoured part of the Australian community. That's quite separate</p>
<p> and apart from judgements people make about what is now occurring.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>What's happening in Serbia now is a political dispute of today.</p>
<p> What we're celebrating is something that happened...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well what we're remembering is something that happened more than</p>
<p> 50 years ago and the Australians of Serbian descent were magnificent</p>
<p> allies of ours and they fought very bravely, and they tied down, on</p>
<p> some estimates, helped to tie down 15 to 20 German divisions in World</p>
<p> War II and they were wonderful allies. Now one of the great things</p>
<p> about ANZAC Day is that you can remember that and you can see that</p>
<p> for the great deed that it then presented. The fact that we can also</p>
<p> very very freely acknowledge without bitterness the fact that we fought</p>
<p> against other countries who have now contributed magnificently to</p>
<p> the modern day Australian population. I mean one of the things about...you</p>
<p> can remember without that remembrance creating any present day difficulties</p>
<p> and I think that's a magnificent thing too.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>I can't agree with you enough and you said, they're Australian</p>
<p> first.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Exactly. I see people always as Australians first, an obviously we</p>
<p> each of us have our distinctive heritage which we want to preserve,</p>
<p> and that's fine. But we're all Australians first.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>And what we can achieve in Australia as Australians is to put aside</p>
<p> some of those ancient disputes and rivalries that have in fact have</p>
<p> been the cause for many of those people to come here in the first</p>
<p> place.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well indeed, and that applies, I mean whether it's a dispute</p>
<p> in the Balkans, or years and years ago a dispute in Ireland, or a</p>
<p> dispute somewhere else. Once you come to this country something else</p>
<p> takes over and that's what we particularly have to offer. And</p>
<p> we are reminded on a day like this that that really is what those</p>
<p> people fought for.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>There was a piece Gerard Henderson wrote which was in The Age</p>
<p> and The Sydney Morning Herald, I think maybe on Tuesday</p>
<p> or Wednesday, saying basically if you go far enough back in the lineage</p>
<p> of most Australians they are boat people of one kind or another, whether</p>
<p> they were boat people from Asia, or from Eastern Europe, or Central</p>
<p> Europe, or even from Ireland, the proportion of the Australian population</p>
<p> that can trace some element of that in their family history is phenomenal.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well yeah. Apart from....</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah perhaps. But the point, if you're talking about migrant</p>
<p> people, yes, apart from of course the indigenous people, but the rest</p>
<p> of us at some stage had ancestors who came to this country from another</p>
<p> country, yes. Although I don't know that, I mean boat people</p>
<p> is perhaps stretching it a bit. But I understand his point. I won't</p>
<p> argue with it.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>That's good. The other thing I've seen in one of the papers</p>
<p> today, there's an extract of your speech for today and you do</p>
<p> talk about Â‘mateship'. You do talk about Â‘mateship'</p>
<p> in your ANZAC Day speech.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. Well one normally associates that with ANZAC Day, indeed with</p>
<p> a lot of other characteristics. I had a man come up to me a moment</p>
<p> ago and he spoke about the great volunteer spirit of Australia, and</p>
<p> I think that's very very much part of it too.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Indeed. Now 20 minutes to 9. John Howard, Prime Minister, you're</p>
<p> off I think to Indonesia tomorrow.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm going to Indonesia tomorrow, yes. I'm leaving Australia</p>
<p> at 1.00pm tomorrow, and I'll be having my meeting with President</p>
<p> Habibie on Tuesday and I expect to return to Australia on Tuesday</p>
<p> evening. And I have a commitment here in Melbourne on Wednesday night</p>
<p> so I've got a bit on in the 48 hours.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>You certainly have. But high expectations for that visit. You said</p>
<p> you don't want to talk politics and I don't want to.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't want to talk any party politics. We are all Australians</p>
<p> together today. Our differences of political party and background</p>
<p> should be put aside. I don't want to talk about that, but I'm</p>
<p> happy to talk about, you know, in a broad sense, about the importance</p>
<p> of the visit, and there is an ANZAC Day....</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>I mean we've had many returned servicemen calling in on our talkback</p>
<p> during the week saying that when I served in Timor we made a promise</p>
<p> to those people that we wouldn't forget them because of the help</p>
<p> they gave us in World War II.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Many of the Timorese people were very helpful, yes they were. And</p>
<p> a number of the World War II diggers who were taken prisoner of war</p>
<p> by the Japanese remember with affection the help of the people of</p>
<p> Timor. And that's one of the things that weighs on the mind of</p>
<p> members of the Government and I'm sure all people who are concerned.</p>
<p> And what I want, recognising that we are dealing with a government</p>
<p> that has sovereignty over East Timor, that's the Indonesian government,</p>
<p> and that's been the position now for 25 years, we want to drive</p>
<p> home the concerns that we have and it's opportune and appropriate</p>
<p> that I have a meeting with the Indonesian President tomorrow.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>All Australians are keen to see that resolved in a way that preserves</p>
<p> the human rights of the people....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is everybody's aspiration and we have to try and do</p>
<p> that in a way that is always consistent with Australia's own</p>
<p> national interest because that is the ultimate responsibility of any</p>
<p> government and any Prime Minister to look after the interests first</p>
<p> and foremost of the Australian people</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Good luck. Thank you for your time this morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thanks John.</p>
