    <content><![CDATA[<p>MBARGO 900 PAL.<br />SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. E, G. WHITLAM, MoPe,<br />TO THE AUSTRALIAN FARMERS' FEDERATIOQf<br />CANBERRA, TUESDAY 29 OCTOBER 1974<br />I RECALL WITH GREAT PLEASURE THE RECEPTION YOU<br />GAVE ME A YEAR AGO WHEN I ADDRESSED YOUR FEDERATION HERE<br />IN THIS CIT?, YOU SHOWED YOURSELVES THEN AS YOU HAVE<br />ALWAYS DONEIN YOUR NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND<br />IN YOU PRE-BUDGET SUBMISSIONS TO THE CABINET TO BE<br />RECEPTIVE, RESPONSIBLE AND REASONABLE. SINCE I LAST<br />SPOKE TO YOU OUR ECONOMIC PROBLEMS HAVE INCREASED AND THE<br />DIFFICULTIES FACED BY FARMERS HAVE INCREASED. I ACKNOWLEDGE<br />THOSE FACTS FRANKLY AT THE OUTSET. I MAKE NO APOLOGY,<br />HOWEVER. FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S RURAL POLICIES. I . INTEND TO<br />SHOW YOU THAT OUR POLICIES ARE NOT ONLY SOUND BUT GENEROUS,<br />AND THAT IF WE ARE TRULY DETERMINED TO IMPROVE THE'PROSPECTS<br />OF OUR RURAL INDUSTRIES THERE IS NO RATIONAL ALTERNATIVE<br />TO THEM. I AM NOT HERE TO OFFER YOU SOFT SOAP OR HOLD OUT<br />PROSPECTS OF MAGICAL SOLUTIONS, ANY MORE THAN I AM PREPARED<br />TO DO SO FOR OTHER SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY. I WANT TO<br />TELL YOU AS CLEARLY AND FULLY AS I CAN WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR<br />YOUR INDUSTRIES AND WHAT WE HOPE TO DO. I WANT TO CONVINCE<br />YOU THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS YOUR INTERESTS TRULY<br />AT HEART, AND THAT YOUR FUTURE GIVEN GOODWILL AND GOOD<br />SENSE IS A BRIGHT ONE.</p>
<p>-2-<br />IT IS TEMPTING FOR FARMERS IN TIMES OF ECONOMIC<br />DIFFICULTY TO SEEK A SCAPEGOAT FOR THEIR PROBLEMS. 1Tis<br />PARTICULARLY TEMPTING TO MAKE THE LABOR GOVERNMENT THE<br />SCAPEGOAT AND IMAGINE THAT ALL YOUR TROUBLES CAN BE LAID<br />AT THE GOVERNMENT'S DOOR. YOU WOULD BE VERY FOOLISH TO<br />ADOPT THAT ATTITUDE. IHAVE TOO MUCH RESPECT FOR YOUR<br />INTELLIGENCC AND YOUR REALISM AS MEN* OF. THE LAND TO IMAGINE<br />THAT YOU WILL FALL FOR THE LINE, SEDULOUSLY FOSTERED BY<br />OUR OPPONENTS, THAT LABOR IS AN ANTI-RURAL PARTY. WE HAVE<br />HEARD THESE SLOGANS BEFORE. IHAVE ANSWERED THEM BEFORE.<br />IAM TIRED OF THEM AND I AM PREPARED TO BET THAT YOU. ARE<br />PRETTY TIRED OF THEM YOURSELVES. THEY SOLVE NOTHINGI.<br />THE DIFFICULTIES FACED BY OUR RURAL INDUSTRIES ARE OF TWO<br />BROAD KINDS. THERE ARE THOSE CONCERNED WITH CHAN~ GING<br />INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WORLD PRICES AND CLIMATIC'AND<br />SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS. No GOVERNMENT CAN DO MUCH ABOUT THESE<br />DIFFICULTIES OTHER THAN RELIEVEHARDSHIP AS BEST IT CANTHOUGH<br />ON THE QUESTION OF OVERSEAS MARKETS WE HAVE A<br />PARTICULARLY FINE RECORD AND I SHALL DEAL-WITH IT LATER.<br />THE SECOND KIND OF PROBLEM YOU FACE HAS TO DO WITH THE<br />GENERAL ECONOMIC-CONDITION OF THE NATION. ' TO A LARGE EXTENT<br />THE PROBLEMS FACED BY RURAL INDUSTRIES ARE THOSE FACED BY THE<br />ENTIRE COMMUNITY. YOU ARE NOT ALONE.' INFLATION TOUCHES ALL<br />OF US AND BEATING INFLATION IS A TASK FOR ALL OF US. IT<br />ALSO HAPPENS TO BE A PROBLEM FOR EVERY DEVELOPED COUNTRY IN<br />THE WORLD. .3</p>
<p>-3-<br />IT IS IN NO WAY HELPFUL TO PRETEND THAT FARMERS ' AN ISOLATE<br />THEMSELVES FROM THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY OR FROM. THE REST<br />OF THE WORLD, OR THAT THEIR DIFFICULTIES CAN BE CURED<br />WITH A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY OR A LITTLE EXTRA LIP-SERVICE<br />FROM A GOVERNMENT OF ANOTHER COLOUR. ANYONE WHO TRIES<br />TO SELL YOU THAT LINE IS UNDERRATING YOUR GOOD SENSE,<br />ANYONE WHO-BELIEVES IT IS DOING HIMSELF AND THE FARMERS<br />OF THIS COUNTRY A DISSERVICE.<br />THE LONG-TERM PROBLEMS OF THE RURAL INDUSTRIES<br />ARE DEEP AND COMPLEX LIKE THOSE OF ALL OTHER INDUSTRIES.<br />THEY HAVE TO DO WITH A GENERAL AND PERVADING CRISIS IN THE<br />WESTERN DEMOCRACIES, THEY HAVE TO DO WITH THE LONG-TERM<br />EFFICIENCY OF OUR INDUSTRIES, THE USE WE MAKE OF OUR<br />MANPOWER AND RESOURCES, THE CONDITIONS OF OUR CITIES AND<br />TOWNS AND TRANSPORT, THE PROBLEMS OF MARKETS, INTERNATIONAL<br />TRADE AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. I ASK YOU TO FACE THESE<br />FACTS WITH ME. IF YOU PREFER TO BLAME EVERYTHING ON THE<br />GOVERNMENT, IF YOU IMAGINE THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN SOLVE<br />YOUR PROBLEMS MERELY BY A CHANGE OF HEART, IF YOU PREFER<br />TO LIVE IN A WORLD OF FANTASY AND COUNTRY PARTY SLOGANS<br />THERE IS LITTLE MY GOVERNMENT OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT CAN<br />DO FOR YOU. IT IS TIME FOR MORE CO-OPERATION, MORE<br />GOODWILL AND, IF I MAY SAY SO, A LOT MORE ' REALISM FROM THE<br />FARMING COMMUNITY. I DO NOT'BRUSH ASIDE YOUR PROBLEMS AND<br />I DO NOT DENY YOUR RIGHT TO PROTEST IF YOU BELIEVE YOU HAVE<br />GENUINE GRIEVANCES. I DO SAY THAT FARMERS WHO DEMONSTRATE<br />AGAINST THIS GOVERNMENT SHOULD EXAMINE THE RECORD FAIRLY AND<br />LOOK AT THE FACTS ABOUT THEIR DIFFICULTIES AND WHAT THE<br />GOVERNMENT HAS DONE TQ HELP THEM.</p>
<p>-4-<br />I'AM HAPPY TO LET THE FACTS PSEAK FOR THEMSELV. S, I HOPE<br />YOU WILL BE HAPPY TO LISTEN TO-THEM,<br />I PUT IT TO YOU THAT NO GOVERNMENT HAS DONE<br />MORE FOR THE FARMERS THAN MINE. NOT JUST FOR THE MAN<br />ON THE LAND BUT FOR THE WHOLE RURAL COMMUNITY, FOR THE<br />3,000,000 AND MORE AUSTRALIANS 24% OF OUR PEOPLE WHO<br />LIVE IN COUNTRY TOWNS. AND NOT JUST IN TERMS OF CASH<br />BENEFITS AND SPENDING BUT IN THE DIFFICULT, CREATIVE, TESTING<br />BUSINESS OF SEEKING LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS AND DEVELOPING<br />THE'INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES NEEDED TO SECURE A BETTER<br />LIFE. FOR FARMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES.<br />LET ME GIVE YOU SOME FIGURES FIRST OF ALL. MONEY<br />ISN'T EVERYTHING BUT THE FIGURES SPEAK LOUD AND CLEAR. IN<br />OUR LAST BUDGET, OUTLAYS ON RURAL ASSISTANCE TOTALLED<br />$ 488 MILLION $ 158 MILLION MORE THAN LAST YEAR. THERE WAS<br />A NET INCREASE IN OUR PAYMENTS TO AGRICULTURE OF $ 88 MILLION<br />OVER THE BUDGET IN 1973-74. THAT IS HARDLY THE SORT OF<br />BUDGET ONE WOULD EXPECT FROM AN ANTI-RURAL PARTY. I AM<br />AFRAID WE HEAR ALL TO LITTLE FROM THE FARMERS AND THEIR<br />SELF-PROCLAIMED ALLIES ABOUT THE CREDIT SIDE OF LABOR'S<br />LEDGER THE $ 56 MILLION WE ARE SPENDING ON AN ANIMAL HEALTH,<br />LABORATORY, THE $ 28 MILLION WE ARE SPENDING ON A DAIRY<br />RESTRUCTURING SCHEME, THE $ 40 MILLION WE ARE SPENDING IN<br />INCREASED FIRST ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR WHEAT, THE $ 45 MILLION<br />WE ARE SPENDING ON THE NATURAL DISASTER RELIEF FUND, MOST OF<br />WHICH WILL GO TO PEOPLE IN COUNTRY AREAS. THESE ARE JUST<br />A FEW EXAMPLES.</p>
<p>IN* THE CONTEXT OF CASH BENEFITS PERHAPS I SHOULD<br />DEAL PROMPTLY WITH ONE PARTICULAR AND NOTORIOUS GRIEVANCE<br />OF THE RURAL COMMUNITY. TO LISTEN TO THE COUNTRY PARTY<br />ANYONE WOULD IMAGINE THAT ALL THE TROUBLES OF THE RURAL<br />SECTOR WERE DUE TO OUR DECISION TO ABOLISH THE SUPERPHOSPHATE<br />BOUNTY. WE DECIDED TO END THIS SUBSIDY. BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL<br />REASONS FOR INTRODUCING IT REASONS WHICH ALONE WOULD JUSTIFY<br />A MEASURE OF THIS KIND AT THE TAXPAYERSI EXPENSE NO LONGER<br />EXIST. IT WAS INTRODUCED WHEN THE PARAMOUNT NEED OF THE<br />AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WAS TO ENCOURAGE RURAL PRODUCTION. TO<br />EARN FOREIGN EXCHANGE. THERE IS NO LONGER SUCH A NEED. THE<br />ABOLITION OF THE BOUNTY MOST OF WHICH WENT TO THE WEALTHIEST<br />FARMERS WHO NEED IT LEAST WILL SAVE ABOUT $ 56 MILLION.<br />THAT IS APPROXIMATELY THE COST OF OUR PROPOSED ANIMAL HEALTH<br />LABORATORY. THE BENEFITS TO RURAL PRODUCERS FROM THAT<br />LABORATORY WILL BE INFINITELY GREATER THAN THE BENEFIT FROM<br />THE SUPERPHOSPHATE BOUNTY. SO HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE<br />MORERATIONAL USE OF RESOURCES,. As YOU KNOW, WE HAVE REMOVED<br />A NUMBER OF OTHER RURAL SUBSIDIES WHICH WE CONSIDERED<br />WASTEFUL OR SELF-DEFEATING. THE SUPERPHOSPHATE BOUNTY IS THE<br />ONLY ONE OF THESE SUBSIDIES WHICH THE LIBERAL-COUNTRY PARTIES<br />HAVE SPECIFICALLY PROMISED TO RESTORE AND IF THERE HAD NOT<br />BEEN AN ELECTION LAST MAY I DOUBT IF THEY WOULD HAVE PROMISED<br />EVEN THAT. SO WHENEVER YOU ARE TEMPTED TO BLAME A LABOR<br />6*<br />GOVERNMENT FOR DECISIONS THAT YOU FEEL TO'BE AGAINST YOUR<br />INTERESTS, LOOK CAREFULLY TO SEE WHETHER OUR OPPONENTS WOULD<br />ACT ANY DIFFERENTLY$ / 6</p>
<p>-6-<br />IWANT TO DEAL WITH THE BROAD ASP~ T.*: S OF OUR<br />PROGRAM AS THEY AFFECT COUNTRY DWELLERS NQT JUST<br />FARMERS. IT SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT EVERYTHING THIS<br />GOVERNMENT HAS DONE FOR. CITY PEOPLE IT HAS DONE FOR<br />COUNTRY PEOPLE AS WELL.,. IT IS CENTRAL TO OUR PHILOSOPHY<br />THAT THE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE To AUSTRALIANS FOR A<br />BETTER LIFE SHOULD BE AVAILABLE EQUJALLY TO ALL AUSTRALIANS<br />WHEREVER THEY LIVE. OUR ACHIEVEMENTS IN EDUCATION, HEALTH<br />CARE AND SOCIAL WELFARE, TO TAKE JUST THREE EXAMPLES, ARE<br />NOT BENEFITS FOR CITY PEOPLE ALONE. IN MANY WAYS TH EY ARE<br />OF GREATER IMPORTANCE TO COUNTRY PEOPLE. MY COLLEAGUE<br />SENATOR WRIEDT MADE THE POINT THE OTHER DAY THAT ONLY 4%<br />OF AUSTRALIAN FARMERS HAD HAD A TERTIARY EDUCATION. THAT<br />REGRETTABLE FACT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE. LIMITED EDUCATIONAL<br />OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE IN THE COUNTRY. CHILDREN IN RURAL<br />AREAS HAVE SUFFERED FROM THEIR ISOLATION. WE ARE THE FIRST<br />GOVERNMENT TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM. ONE WAY OF SPENDING<br />FUNDS ON EDUCATION IS TO CONCENTRATE ON PROGRAMS FOR<br />ISOLATED CHILDREN IN RURAL'AREAS. THAT IS WHAT WE-* ARE DOING.<br />IKNOW WHICH COURSE IS MORE IMPORTANT IN THE LONG RUN. LET<br />US FACE THESE FACTS SQUARELY IF ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF OUR<br />CHILDREN. I 1 0 S 17</p>
<p>-7-<br />THE LAST LIBERAL BUDGET PROVIDED $ 2k MI1LLION FOR<br />SPECIAL ASSISTANCE FOR ISOLATED CHILDREN. THIS '( EAR WE.<br />HAVE BUDGETED FOR $ 11k MILLION. THE LAST LIBERAL IlObtiET<br />GAVE $ 6 MILLION FOR RURAL UNIVERSITIES. WE ARE SPENDING<br />$ 21 MILLION THIS YEAR. FOR COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION<br />IN THE RURAL SECTOR, IT WAS $ 12 MILLION IN THE LAST LIBERAL<br />BUDGET; IT IS $ 47 MILLION IN OUR BUDGET..<br />IF WE TAKE SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENTS WE FIND THAT<br />$ 880 MILLION -OR 46% O OF OUR TOTAL EXPENDITURE THROUGHOUT<br />AUSTRALIA GOES TO RURAL AREAS. OUR REGIONAL EMPLOYMENT<br />DEVELOPMENT SCHEME, OUR NATIONAL ROADS AND HIGHWAYS<br />PROGRAMS, OUR PLANS FOR CHILD CARE, OUR SPECIAL ASSISTANCE<br />TO INDUSTRIES IN COUNTRY CITIES AND TOWNS AFFECTED BY<br />UNEMPLOYMENT -THESE ARE ALL MEASURES OF PARTICULAR BENEFIT<br />TO COUNTRY PEOPLE. OUR TAX CUTS FOR PEOPLE ON INCOMES<br />BELOW $ 10,000 A YEAR WILL ASSIST MANY FARMERS. SO WILL OUR<br />PROPOSAL TO ALLOW MORTGAGE INTEREST PAYMENTS AS A TAX<br />DEDUCTION. So WILL OUR RECENT DEVALUATION. SO WILL OUR<br />LOWER TARIFFS. SO WILL OUR ABOLITION OF RADIO AND TELEVISION<br />LICENCE FEES. ALL THIS SHOULD BE OBVIOUS, BUT TOO OFTEN<br />THESE THINGS ARE FORGOTTEN.</p>
<p>-8-<br />WE ARE ACUTELY CONSCIOUS OF FLUCTUATION IN<br />FARMERS' INCOMES. THESE FLUCTUATIONS CAUSE HARDHIPj,;<br />AND UNCERTAINTY FOR MANY RURAL PRODUCERS. IN ADDITION TO THE<br />PARTICULAR GOVERNMENT MEASURES I HAVE DESCRIBED, WHICH WILL<br />RAISE LIVING STANDARDS IN ALL RURAL AREAS, WE ARE DETERMINED<br />TO DO WHAT WE CAN ABOUT INDIVIDUAL INCOME FLUCTUATIONS.<br />I HAVE TODAY. ASKED THE INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE COMMISSION TO<br />REPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT ON WHAT ASSISTANCE MAY BE NEEDED TO<br />REDUCE THESE FLUCTUATIONS. THE INQUIRY WILL BE DETAILED<br />AND COMPREHENSIVE AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT CONSIDERABLE<br />SBENEFITS WILL FLOW FROM IT TO THE WHOLE FARMING COMMUNITY.<br />WHEN I-SPOKE. TO YOU LAST YEAR I TOLD YOU THAT WE SAW THE<br />I. A. C. AS THE GREAT INSTRUMENT FOR RATIONALISING AND, WHERE<br />"' FCESSARY, AUGMENTING OUR ASSISTANCE TO RURAL INDUSTRIES,<br />SINl" THEN WE HAVE REFERRED MANY RURAL MATTERS TO THE<br />I. A. C. FOR INQUIRY AND REPORT. IT WILL HELP YOU IF I LIST<br />THEM BRIEFLY: SUPERPHOSPHATE MANUFACTURING, MUSHROOMS,<br />APPLES AND PEARS, DRIED VINE FRUITS, BOVINE BRUCELLOSIS,<br />AND TUBERCULOSIS SLAUGHTER COMPENSATION cHEMES, RURAL<br />PROMOTION, RURAL RESEARCH, RURAL RECONSTRUCTION, DAIRYING,<br />NEW LAiiD FARMS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA, NITROGENOUS FERTILIZER<br />SSUBSIDY. THUS YO. "' ILL SEE THE STRENGTH AND SCOPE OF OUR<br />EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THEIR I-" PECTS OF OUR RURAL INDUSTRIES.<br />I SHALL DEAL BRIEFLY" WITH OUR ACHIEVEMENTS IN<br />FOUR INDUSTRIES OF GREAT IMPORTANCE. .1/ 9</p>
<p>THE OUTLOOK FOR THE WOOL INDUSTRY DE TTE<br />FALLING PRICES IS MORE SECURE TODAY AS A RESULT-. OF<br />LABOR'S POLICIES, IN DECEMBER 1972 WE INHERITED MR. ANTHONY'S<br />FLEXIBLE RESERVE PRICE SCHEME, Now THE LABOR GOVERNMENT<br />' HAS DECIDED THAT THE WOOL INDUSTRY SHOULD BE PROTECTED BY A<br />FLOOR PRICE. IT HAS BEEN FIXED AT THE EQUILAVENT OF 250<br />CENTS A KILO CLEAN FOR THE FULL 1974-75' SEASON,. IN EFFECT,<br />AUSTRALIAIS CUSTOMERS NOW KNOW THAT DURING THE CURRENT<br />SEASON THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BUY WOOL BELOW THAT PRICE.<br />THIS WILL GIVE THEM CONFIDENCE IN THE AUCTION ROOM. THEY WILL<br />KNOW THAT THE VALUE OF THEIR STOCKS WILL NOT FALL DRASTICALLY<br />AND THAT COMPETITORS WILL PAY THE SAME BASIC PRICE FOR WOOL<br />SUPPLIES AS THEY WILL. THE WOOLGROWER WILL HAVE GREATER<br />CONFIDENCE IN THE INDUSTRY KNOWING THAT A FLOOR HAS BEEN<br />PLACED UNDER THE MARKET.<br />IN ADDITION TO THE FLOOR PRICE MECHANISM, THE<br />AUSTRALIAN WOOL CORPORATION HAS BEEN AUTHORISED TO CONTINUE<br />TO OPERATE A FLEXIBLE RESERVE PRICE SCHEME WHEN MARKET<br />VALUES ARE ABOVE 250 CENTS A KILO. IN OTHER WORDS, IF THE<br />MARKET RATE IS ABOVE 250 CENTS AND A SLUMP SETS IN, THE<br />DECLINE WILL BE SOFTENED WITH THE PRICE FALLING GRADUALLY<br />UNTIL THE FIXED FLOOR IS REACHED,<br />ON THE EVE OF THE BUDGET, THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO<br />PROVIDE DIRECT LOANS TO THE AUSTRALIAN WOOL CORPORATION FOR<br />ITS FLOOR PRICE OPERATIONS WHEN THE BANKS ARE UNABLE TO MAKE<br />FUNDS AVAILABLE, IN EFFECT, THE LABOR GOVERNMENT IS NOW<br />PROVIDING ITS OWN FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE WOOL MARKET AND NOT<br />) U T UARANTEEIN LQAN$ FROM THE BANKLNG .110</p>
<p>WE HAVE ALREADY INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO PROVIflE $ 150 MILLION<br />TO SUPPORT THE FLOOR PRICE.<br />WE HAVE HELPED WHEATGROWERS IN POSITIVE AND<br />CONSTRUCTIVE WAYS. ONE OF THE FIRST ACTS Or THE GOVERNMENT<br />WAS TO RECOGNISE THE VALIDITY OF WHEATGROWERS' CASE FOR AN<br />INCREASED FIRST ADVANCE PAYMENT, PARTICULARLY AT A TIME<br />WHEN STOCKS WERE AT AN ALL-TIME LOW. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN<br />FIFTEEN YEARS, THE FIRST'ADVANCE WAS ' INCREASED BY A SPECIAL<br />INCENTIVE PAYMENT OF 10 CENTS A BUSHEL. AT THE SAME TIME$<br />THE GOVERNMENT AGREED TO APPLY THE INCREASED FIRST ADVANCE<br />TO A RECORD DELIVERY QUOTA OF 514 MILLION BUSHELS FOR 1973-74,<br />WE ALSO INTRODUCED AN ADDITIONAL FLOATING POOL OF<br />MILLION BUSHELS FOR STATES WHICH EXCEEDED THEIR QUOTA.<br />FOR THE 1974-75 CROP, THE GOVERNMENT HAS ACCEPTED THE<br />RECOMMENDATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN WHEATGROWERS' FEDERATION<br />THAT THE BASE QUOTA SHOULD REMAIN AT 514 MILLION BUSHELS.<br />THE FLOATING POOL HAS BEEN INCREASED TO 74 MILLION BUSHELS.<br />liH FIRST ADVANCE PAYMENT OF $ 1.20 PER BUSHEL WILL APPLY,<br />IN ADDITION, AFTER NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE WHEATGROWERS'<br />FEDERATION AND THE GOVERNMENT, A NEW FIVE-YEAR STABILISATION,<br />PLAN FOR THE WHEAT INDUSTRY HAS BEEN FORMULATEr. I EXPECT<br />THAT WE SHALL BE MAKING A FURTHER ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WILL<br />ENCOURAGE WHEATGROWERS LATER THIS WEEK. ./ li</p>
<p>S. 4;<br />THE GOVERNMENT HAS SHOWN ITS CONCERN FOR THE MEAI<br />INDUSTRY DESPITE STRONG PRESSURES FOR RESTRICTIONS ON<br />THE EXPORT OF MEAT, WE REFUSED TO INTERFERE WITH THE<br />NORMAL MARKET FORCES WHICH DETERMINE THE QUANTITIES OF<br />MEAT RETAINED FOR THE DOMESTIC MARKET OR SENT FOR EXPORT.<br />THIS DECISION WAS TAKEN IN THE BELIEF THAT IT WAS IN THE<br />BEST LONG-TERM INTERESTS OF BOTH PRODUCER AND'CONSUMER.<br />THE PROVISION OF OVER $ 1 MILLION TO COMPENSATE OWNERS<br />OF REACTOR LIVESTOCK HAS ENABLED THE TUBERCULOSIS<br />ERADICATION CAMPAIGN TO BE ACCELERATED, IN ADDITION TO'<br />OUR PROPOSED ANIMAL HEALTH LABORATORY. THE GOVERNMENT<br />WILL ESTABLISH A BUREAU OF ANIMAL HEALTH WITHIN THE<br />S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. MR R. W. GEE HAS ALREADY:<br />BEEN APPOINTED DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU. IT IS ALSO<br />PROPOSED TO SET UP A NATIONAL ANIMAL HEALTH ADVISORY<br />COUNCIL ALONG THE LINES OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH AND<br />MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL. THERE IS A REAL NEED TO<br />INTRODUCE A SINGLE MEAT INSPECTION SERVICE TO ELIMINATE<br />THE DUPLICATION AND INEFFICIENCY THAT ARISES FROM THE<br />PRESENT SYSTEM OF BOTH AUSTRALIAN AND STATE GOVERNMENTS<br />PROVIDING MEAT INSPECTION. DISCUSSIONS ARE BEING HELD<br />WITH THE STATES TO TRY TO REACH AGREEMENT ON A-SINGLE<br />SERVICE TO COVER ALL MEAT PREPARED IN AUSTRALIA FOR<br />LOCAL OR OVERSEAS CONSUMPTION.</p>
<p>A'.<br />-12-<br />WE ARE BUILDING A STRONG EFFICIENT AND COMPETITIVE i<br />SUGAR INDUSTRY THE GQVERNMENT HAS ALREADY ANNOUNCED THAT<br />. IT WILL CONTINUE THE NITROGENOUS FERTILISER SUBSIDY AFTER<br />DECEMBER 31 THIS YEAR TO ASSIST SPECIAWSED REGIONAL<br />eGROWTH AND TO ENSURE CONTINUEA. LOCAL FERTILISER. PRODUCTION.<br />E. WANT TO ENSURE THAT AUSTRALiA IS NOT-AT THE MERCY F<br />OVERSEAS. SUPPLIERS OF FERTILIZER. THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES',<br />: THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ASSISTANCE TO SUGAR PRODUCERS AND<br />. THE HORTICULTURAL INDUSTRIES IN IRRIGATION AREAS WHERE<br />THERE IS A NEED TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVE OF SOIL FERTILITY.<br />9 1;<br />i' IICI<br />THE FRUIT GROWING INDUSTRY HAS PROBABLY SUFFERED<br />MORE THAN ANY OTHER RURAL INDUSTRY THROUGH RISING COSTS<br />OF PRODUCTION, INCREASING FREIGHT RATES AND CONTRACTING<br />SMARKETS To ASSIST THE INDUSTRY THE GOVERNMENT MAINTAINED<br />STA. 3LISATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR EXPORTS IN THE 1973 SEASON<br />THROUGH GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE OF $ 2.75 MILLION IT<br />SALSO MADE iAAILABLE IN THE 1973 SEASON ABOUT $ 1.6 MILLION<br />. TO HELP THE INDUSTRY ADJUST TO OUR REVALUATION OF THE 1<br />AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR. FOR THE 1974 EXPORT SEASON, APART<br />FROM SUPPORT THROUGH STABILISATION, WE AGREED TO SUPPORT<br />A TASMANIAN GOVERNMENT SCHEME FOR THE SHIFMENT OF APPLES<br />To EUROPE AND THL "' ITED KINGDOM,. WITH A FINANCIAL.<br />COMMITMENT OF $ 2 MILLION. SiMILAR SCHEMES HAVE BEEN<br />AGREED TO WITH THE QUEENSLAND AND WESTERN AUSTRALIAN<br />S GOVERNMENTSe o / 13</p>
<p>-13<br />THEY HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO GIVE THE INDUSTRY A BREATHING<br />S SPACE SO THAT NECESSARY RESTRUCTURING MEASURES CAN BE<br />SPUT INTO EFFECT, WE HAVE REPLACED THE APPLE AND PEAR<br />BOARD WITH THE AUSTRALIAN APPLE AND PEAR CORPORATION, WHICH<br />WILL BE A SMALLER AND MORE EFFICIENT BODY WITH POWER TO<br />TRADE IN ITS OWN RIGHT IN FRESH FRUIT AND PROCESSED FRUIT<br />PRODUCTS,<br />. i A YEAR AT CURRENT PRICES.-Y<br />THERE IS ANOTHER BROAD THEME RUNNING THROUGH<br />OUR POLICIES AND IT IS THE BASIS OF ALL RURAL PROSPERITY.<br />THAT IS THE ENLARGEMENT OF MARKETS. . OUR BASIC OBJECTIVE FOR<br />RURAL EXPORTS IS TO PROVIDE A FIRM AND LASTING BASIS<br />FOR INCREASED TRADE IN RURAL COMMODITIES. SINCE DECEMBER<br />1972 THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONCLUDED MANY TRADE AGREEMENTS<br />OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO YOU AS FARMERS, I AM PROUD OF<br />THESE AGREEMENTS, I SHALL LIST THE MOST IMPORTANT OF<br />THEM. ' IN JULY 1973, WE SIGNED A TRADE AGREEMENT WITH<br />CHINA IN WHICH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED THE<br />PRINCIPLE OF LONG-TERM COMMODITY AGREEMENTS, AUSTRALIAN<br />RURAL PRODUCTS MENTIONED IN THE AGREEMENT INCLUDE WHEAT.<br />AND OTHER GRAINS, SUGAR, WOOL. COTTON, TALLOW, HIDES AND<br />SKINS, BREEDING ANIMALS, PAPER AND PULP, A LONG TERM<br />CONTRACT WAS NEGOTIATED WITH CHINA FOR UP TO 4.7 MILLION<br />TONNES OF WHEAT OVER A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS. AT CURRENT<br />PRICES, THIS WOULD BE WORTH MORE THAN $ 600 MILLION. CHINA<br />HAS ALSO SHOWN INTEREST IN LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS FOR OTHER<br />COMMODITIES, INCLUDING A SUGAR AGREEMENT WORTH $ 50 MILLION</p>

<p>S IMPORTANT AS OUR MAJOR EXPORT MARKETS ARE, WE<br />ARE CONSCIOUS OF THE NEED TO AVOID TOO MUCH DEPENDENCE ON<br />ONE OR TWO MAJOR MARKETS FOR OUR PRIMARY PRODUCTS. TO<br />FURTHER EXPAND MARKETS FOR AUSTRALIA'S PRIMARY PRODUCTS,<br />THE GOVERNMENT WILL ESTABLISH AN OVERSEAS AGRICULTURAL<br />MARKETING SERVICE, . THE SERVICE WILL BE STAFFED BY<br />EXPERIENCED MARKETING MEN IN KEY MARKETS OF THE WORLD AND<br />SUPPORTED BY THE NECESSARY FACILITIES IN AUSTRALIA,<br />SITS ROLE WILL BE TO IDENTIFY AND MEASURE MARKET<br />OPPORTUNITIES, PROVIDE MARKET INTELLIGENCE AND UP-TO-DATE<br />INFORMATION ON LOCAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND REGULATIONS,<br />TO INVESTIGATE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, AND TO CO-ORDINATEPROMOTION<br />PROGRAMS, / 16<br />A : TRADE AGREEMENT WAS CONCLUDED : WITHTHE L.
