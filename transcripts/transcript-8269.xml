    <content><![CDATA[<p>FOR MEDIA 11 MARCH 1991<br />
Australia is again proud to join other Commonwealth<br />
countries in celebrating Commonwealth Day 1991. The<br />
variety of the Commonwealth's achievements reflects the<br />
rich diversity, of its members as well as their common<br />
commitment to creating a fair, peaceful and sustainably<br />
productive world for all. </p>
<p>The Commonweal. th's achievements in southern Africa<br />
deserve specia-l mention this year, as we see reforms<br />
taking place in South Africa. The Commonwealth can take<br />
pride in the role it has played. It has been at the<br />
forefront of international calls to end apartheid, and<br />
played a catal. ytic role in the decision of the<br />
international community to impose measures on South<br />
Africa. The Commonweal~ th has recently decided on ways to give<br />
practical encouragement to the reform process in South<br />
Africa. At this encouraging stage, we look forward with<br />
hope to the maintenance of the momentum of reform in<br />
South Africa. </p>
<p>Through the Commonwealth, Australia is pursuing its<br />
global commitmrent to the environment. Many Commonwealth<br />
member nations are environmentally fragile, and some are<br />
particularly susceptible to climate change. Australia's<br />
response to provide training on the effects of climate<br />
change for Commonwealth member nations has been well<br />
received. The first phase of the program has been<br />
successfully completed, and confirms that it will provide<br />
real and practical benefits for the people of the<br />
Commonwealth. Since the last Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting<br />
in 1989, the Commonwealth has been engaged in a rigourous<br />
review of its roles and functions. The priorities<br />
identified during the review will be considered at the<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting at Harare in<br />
October. This process will ensure that the Commonwealth<br />
continues to meet the needs of its members, as it has<br />
done over the past forty years. I am confident that the<br />
Commonwealth will be able to face the challenges of the<br />
1990s and beyond. </p>
