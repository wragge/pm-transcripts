THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
12 MARCH 1974<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Ladies and gentlemen. I haven't got anything to<br />
volunteer to you. Is there anything you want to ask me?<br />
QUESTION: I refer to the return of power of the Labor Government<br />
in Britain and your previously unsuccessful attempt to get<br />
support from the Heath Administration for Australia's argument<br />
with the French over nuclear testing in the Pacific. Have you had<br />
any contact with the new Foreign Secretary, Mr Callaghan, about the<br />
proposed French tests this year, if not, would you expect to get<br />
more sympathetic support from the new Administration than from the<br />
previous encumbrance at 10 Downing Stre et?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We haven't had any communications with the new<br />
British Government yet. I do think that they will be more positive<br />
on this matter than the previous administration.<br />
QUESTION: Sunday night in your address to the nation, you were<br />
talking about the five referenda which you said would be held<br />
at the same time as the Senate election. In viewof what's been<br />
happening in the Senate, does this mean that the Senate election<br />
will not be held until it is possible to hold the 5 referenda.<br />
Alternatively, will you hold the referenda after the Senate election.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, the proposal all along has been to hold the<br />
referendums at the same time as the Senate election. That was<br />
stated more than 6 months ago at the Constitutional Convention<br />
in Sydney, and it has been stated on several occasions since then.<br />
My broadcast and telecast on Sunday night dealt with the four<br />
referendums for which bills have now been twice passed by the<br />
House of Representatives and once rejected by the Senate. The<br />
broadcast and telecast didn't deal with the Constitution Alteration<br />
( Inter-Change of Powers) Bill because while it has gone through<br />
the House of Representatives it hasn't yet been voted on by the<br />
Senate. If the Senate rejects that bill then that referendum<br />
couldn't be put to the people. The other referendums can all be<br />
put to the people because, even if the Senate twice rejects them,<br />
there has been the necessary double passage by the House e<br />
Representatives. QUESTION: But if the Senate does not reject them in time for perhaps<br />
the date you were thinking of for the Senate election, would you<br />
then hold the Senate elections back?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It is quite clear that the Senate knows that these<br />
referendums are to be held together with the Senate election<br />
and if there was any delay in the Senate we would make it clear<br />
that that would be regarded as a failure to pass and we could ther....<br />
QUESTION: You would go to the Governor-General on this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, yes, as the Constitution provides. The<br />
Constitution has always made it possible for the Governor-General<br />
to put a referendum to the people if it has been twice passed by<br />
the House of Representatives and twice rejected by the Senate.<br />
The Senate can't prevent a referendum being put to the people in<br />
those circumstances. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
QUESTION: You say the Constitution makes it possible for<br />
Sir Paul Hasluck to do that. Hlow certain are you that he would take<br />
this view. Is it mandatory for him to take the view~ that you<br />
have suggested?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am certain the Governor-General would act on<br />
the advice of his Attorney.<br />
QUESTION: Even if the Senate approves the referendum on the<br />
exchange of powers, it's not possible now for you to have that<br />
referendum in conjunction with the Senate election before May 12,<br />
and the likelihood of the Senate having rejected a change in the<br />
Standing Orders is in fact a delay of about another month. Do you<br />
now have any hope whatsoever of putting back the Senate election<br />
until June to have that referendum with it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Senate election doesn't have to be held until<br />
the end of June because the Senators who will be elected will take<br />
office on 1 July. Ordinarily Senate elections, like House of<br />
Representatives elections, are held on Saturdays. So, accordingly,<br />
it would be possible to have the Senate election on the last<br />
Saturday in June. I'd add that I would expect certainly hope<br />
that the Senate would pass the Constitution Alteration ( Inter-Change<br />
of Powers) Bill because this bill was approved, in principle, in<br />
fact applauded by the Premiers of N. S. W. and Victoria. Also, by<br />
the Premiers of South Australia and Western Australia<br />
and the Attorney-General who was leading the Tasmanian delegation<br />
at the Constitutional Convention last September. And while the<br />
Premier of Queensland didn't endorse the proposal he didn't reject<br />
it either. Since then the seven Parliamentary draftsmen, the<br />
Commonwealth, the six State ones and all the Attorneys-General,<br />
the Commonwealth and the six State ones, have considered and approved<br />
the text of the bill which I introduced and which the House of<br />
Representatives passed. This was promised at the Constitutional<br />
Convention six months ago, so it would be a gross breach of faith<br />
if the Opposition parties in the Senate were to delay that bill.<br />
You mention the call of the Senate. Under the Standing Orders of<br />
the Senate such a call takes place on the third reading. If, on<br />
the second reading, the Opposition Senators were to vote &amp; qainst<br />
the bill then, of course, there would never be any third reading,<br />
there would never be any call of the Senate, so one would know I<br />
expect the fate of that bill on the second reading.<br />
QUESTION: What's the date of the Senate election?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That depends on the dates on which the Senate passes<br />
any of the five bills for rererendums ,.. hich are before it or the<br />
date on which it rejects any of the four which it has already<br />
rejected once. I should add that if the Senate this time passes any<br />
or all of those four which it previously rejected, then two months<br />
must elapse before those referendums which it approves are put to<br />
the people. If it rejects those all of them the second time<br />
then -there is no minimum period before they are put to the people. </p>
<p>QUESTION: I was just wondering what your reaction was to the apparent<br />
reluctance by the A. C. T. U. Executive to co-operate in the<br />
introduction of some skilled car workers from the Philippines to<br />
Australia as permanent settlers, and further if you feel that this<br />
decision may have caused some misgivings in Manila about<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am discussing Mr Cameron, the Minister for<br />
Labor, Mr Grassby, the Minister for Immigration, and I are discussing<br />
this matter with the officers of the A. C. T. U. next Friday morning<br />
in Sydney.<br />
QUESTION: Just following on that que~ tion. Do you still believe<br />
that they should be allowed to come to Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I will make no more statements on this matter until<br />
Friday morning.<br />
QUESTION: Do you remain committed to completely abolishing the means<br />
test on old age pensions in the life of this parliament?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You know what I have said in the policy speech.<br />
QUESTION: Do you have any plans to visit the flood areas of N. S. W.?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am seeing if I can arrange my program to go there.<br />
QUESTION: We understand there is an Interim Report from the<br />
Henderson Inquiry into Poverty received by the Government. I wonder<br />
when that report will be released?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We haven't discussed it in Cabinet yet. It hasn't<br />
been circulated in a submission to Cabinet yet. I would expect<br />
that it would be released this session.<br />
QUESTION: There has been discussion over recent days by Mr Crean<br />
the Treasurer, on the question of restructuring the tax scale.<br />
He said today he would do it. Do you believe this should be done<br />
in this year's Budget.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We haven't discussed this. There has been no<br />
submission to Cabinet on this matter.<br />
QUESTION: To take you back to David Solomon's question. Were you<br />
saying that the only influence on you on what date you decide to<br />
have the Senate election was whether or not you could hold the<br />
referenda on the same day?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We shall hold the referendums on the same day,<br />
and I can't say what that day is yet because the Senate still has<br />
the bills for the referendums before it.<br />
QUESTION: Would you give favourable consideration to any suggestion<br />
that the federal Government should enter the life and general<br />
insurance field? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I think there are much greater ar-gulnts for the<br />
federal Government entering the general insurance fild than fuc<br />
it entering the life assurance field. Life assurance is 3enera). y<br />
mutual and there is a fair amount of competition on the terms thet<br />
are available. I do believe it is important that the Australian<br />
Government should enter into the general insurance field mjost<br />
of the State Governments have already entered it. It is a field<br />
which io dominated still by foreign companies.<br />
QUESTION: The West Australian and the federal Government<br />
co-operated on feasibility studies of the West Australian log of<br />
the national pipe grid. This report has been presented and<br />
has been available for some time but hasn't been released. When<br />
do you expect that this report will be made public?<br />
PRIME MINISTER; I didn't think it w-s available yet.<br />
QUESTION: Well it has been widely leaked in West Australia and<br />
it has been presented to the Government.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I didn't know it had.<br />
QUESTION: Abolition of the means test, Prime Minister. Would you<br />
counternance any slowing down in the abolition of the means test<br />
beyond the lifetime of this Parliament.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: As you know, before the last elections both the<br />
Liberal Party and the Labor Party committed themselves to the<br />
abolition of the means test in the lifetime of this Parliament.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Gorton indicated in 1970 that the Commonwealth would<br />
pay all legal costs if the StaLes took the Seabed issue to the<br />
High Court. Is this your intention also?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I haven't considered that. We have given no<br />
undertakings on that. The States, you will remember, acted without<br />
consulting the Australian Government on some matters in this field<br />
when they petitioned the Queen to refer certain matters to the<br />
British Privy Council. And, as the Queen stated in bhr : peech<br />
opening the Parliament, both the British and her Australian<br />
ministers advisedher not to do so.<br />
QUESTION: I am wondering how you reconcile the referendum proposal.<br />
to make all electorates equal in numbers of people with your past<br />
adherence to the principle of " one vote one value". If you still<br />
adhere to " one vote one value", will you be extending the franchise<br />
if the referendum is passed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The referendum bills, you remember, guarantees<br />
that everybody who is 18 or more shall have a vote for every House<br />
of Parliament in Australia not only the two federal Houses of<br />
Parliament but all the State Houses of Parliament including, of course<br />
the Legislative Council of which isn't elected directly<br />
by the people at all. So, there will be no extension of the franchise<br />
The Bill itself guarantees the franchise to people who are 18<br />
or above except where there are laws restricting the franchise in the<br />
case of people of unsound mind or serving prison terms. Any such<br />
restrictions, like any other applications of that Constitutional<br />
proposal, are left to the High Court to determine. Anybody who has<br />
a vote or believes he should have a vote will be able to approcuh the<br />
High Court under this referendum proposal, so there will be no<br />
extension of the franchise involved in the referendum proposals. </p>
<p>QUESTION: But what about the question of " one vote one value"?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: My view on this has been expressed for 10 years<br />
in the Parliament 10 years and 1 month. Ever since the Warren<br />
Court, the Supreme Court of the United States, laid down that<br />
principle. The Australian Constitution borrowed from the United<br />
States Constitution the provision that in determining the number<br />
of members in the House of Representatives from the various States<br />
one should take into account the respective population of those<br />
States. Now, the U. S. Supreme Court, for ten years now, has said<br />
that one also equates the population of districts, as they call<br />
them, within each State, and that is what we are doing in this<br />
referendum proposal. We say that the population is what is considered<br />
in determining how many members there will be in the House of<br />
Representatives from each State. And we therefore say that in<br />
consistency there ought also to be regrard paid to the population<br />
in determining the respective size of the electorates inside each<br />
State. I have said this for over 10 years now.<br />
QUESTION: Has it been established, and are you satisfied that<br />
there was no cover-up of the Perkins Affair by your staff?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Certainly I am satisfied. I am surprised that you<br />
are making that insinuation. People made it in the Opposition<br />
parties in the House of Representatives to their discredit and in<br />
breach of the customs and courtes * ies of the House, mentioned the<br />
name of one of my advisers a contemptible action. Now, I hope<br />
you are not suggesting that any of them have done it but, in case<br />
you are, or in case any of the viewers have such a suspicion, then<br />
it is their duty as well as their option to give any evidence for<br />
that suspicion to the Crown Solicitor or to the A. C. T. Commission. 1--<br />
of Police. As you know, there have been persons arrestect arribincj<br />
from the incident of Thursday week and also there have been some<br />
summonses issued but I am not sure whether they have all been<br />
served or if all the perscns concerned have been arrested. But once<br />
it was known that there might have been facts not disclosed in the<br />
undefended proceedings before the Canberra courts then the<br />
Attorney-General, immediately, through the Secretary of his Department<br />
had the Crown Solicitor for the A. C. T. and the Police Commissioner<br />
for the A. C. T. look into this matter. As a result there have been<br />
summonses issued and some at least of them have been served and<br />
the persons concerned arrested.<br />
QUESTION: I was just wondering whether you would make a categorical<br />
declaration now that you will adhere to the schedule that you<br />
proposed to abolish the means test in the lifetime of this Parliontent?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have answered enough questions on this already.<br />
I won't make any further statement on-it. I believe what I hav&amp;. said<br />
is quite clear, but what I have said I am not going to repeat.<br />
QUESTION: You have saved me the trouble of asking a question,<br />
Prime Minister.<br />
PRIME MvINISTER: That doesn't deter many of you because my observation<br />
of these conferences is that you all want to get your own pers,:? nal<br />
reply to the same question. </p>
