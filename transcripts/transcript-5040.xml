PRIME MONISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 5 MAY 1979<br />
JOINT TASK FORCE ON DRUG TRAFFICKING<br />
The Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Fraser, and the Premier of<br />
New South Wales, Mr Wran, today jointly announced the establishment<br />
of a Commonwealth/ State Task Force aimed at securing convictions<br />
of persons engaged in drug-trafficking.<br />
The two leaders said that the establishment of the Task Force<br />
flowed from the joint recommendations of the Commonwealth<br />
and New South Wales Royal Commissioners on Drugs, Mr Justice Williams<br />
and Mr Justice Woodward. They praised the co-operative attitude<br />
which had been adopted by the judges.<br />
" Through their inquiries the two Royal Commissions have probed<br />
into many areas associated with the drug problem and have been<br />
able to identify possible leads to people involved in drug<br />
trafficking", Mr Fraser and Mr Wran said. " T~ t is now the hope<br />
of both our governments that the Task Force will follow these<br />
leads and bring offenders before the Courts, and that convictions<br />
will follow"<br />
The Task Force represents a unique exercise in Commonwealth/ State<br />
co-operations between law enforcement agencies. It will involve<br />
elements of the New South Wales Police, the Commonwealth Police,<br />
and the Federal Narcotics-Bureau and will operate independently<br />
of other law enforcement agencies in the pursuit of particular<br />
targets. The exercise, if successful, may lead to similar operations in<br />
other States and Territories.<br />
The Task Force will act on advice obtained from the R~ oyal Commissions<br />
and from all relevant Commonwealth and State agencies. In particular,<br />
the law enforcement agencies of the Coi-mmonwealth and the State will<br />
supply all intelligence available to them relating to the targets<br />
of the Joint Force.-<br />
in accordance with the co-operative nature of-the arrangements,<br />
the Commonwealth will provide accommodation for the Task Force<br />
and expenditure other than the salaries of the officers involved<br />
will be shared equally by the Commonwealth and the State. ./ 2 </p>

" The co-operative effort of the two Governments in setting up the<br />
Task Force clearly demonstrates their concern at the extent of<br />
illegal drug trafficking in this country, and the formation of<br />
the Joint Force is a positive step towards more effective investigation<br />
and suppression of drug offences", the two leaders said. " To say<br />
this is not to overlook the significant contribution already made<br />
by the State and Commonwealth law enforcement agencies in combating<br />
the illegal drug trade, but rather to add a new dimension to the<br />
fight against the despicable trafficking that endangers the lives<br />
of so many Australians, particularly the young", said Mr Fraser<br />
and Mr Wran.<br />
" The existence of this new Force, and the heavy penalties now<br />
available to the courts for those convicted of drug offences,<br />
should act as a clear disincentive to those thinking of engaging<br />
in this most insidious and destructive of crimes."<br />
