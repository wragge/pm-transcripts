    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Governmentâs first priority is always to keep our country safe. The Minister for Justice, the Honourable Michael Keenan MP, will take on the role of Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Counter Terrorism. In that role he will be my primary point of contact within the ministry on counter terrorism matters. He will be responsible to me for ensuring that counter terrorism efforts across the Government are properly coordinated. He will be supported by the new Commonwealth Counter Terrorism Coordinator in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Mr Greg Moriarty.</p>
<p>Senator the Honourable Connie Fierravanti-Wells as Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General and as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services, will take on responsibility for ensuring that all the relevant community engagement programmes in the Social Services portfolio are aligned and contribute effectively to the Governmentâs broader efforts to promote community engagement and to counter violent extremism.</p>
<p>I should also acknowledge the presence today of the Honourable Philip Ruddock MP, who is not being sworn, who of course will be my Special Envoy for Citizenship and Community Engagement.</p>
