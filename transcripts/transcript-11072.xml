<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, on the issue of aging. Do you agree with suggestions</p>
<p> coming from the Labor Party today that Australia's immigration</p>
<p> intake should be increased to pay for an aging population?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think immigration is an issue that should be debated in a sensible</p>
<p> fashion. At the present time we have a more balanced immigration intake</p>
<p> than we used to have. The Coalition Government has put a greater emphasis</p>
<p> on skilled migration than on family reunion and that's certainly</p>
<p> the way to go. And that sort of approach is better economically for</p>
<p> the country and will make a greater contribution to caring for older</p>
<p> people in the Australian community. I don't think what Mr Sciacca</p>
<p> has said has been adopted as Labor policy. But I think a sensible</p>
<p> debate on immigration is always desirable.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would that debate encompass an increase in the immigration numbers?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think if you have a debate on something you debate every aspect</p>
<p> of it. Although I make it very plain that the present Government will</p>
<p> not depart form a non-discriminatory immigration policy.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you agree with the general idea though that an increase in, for</p>
<p> example, skilled business migrants, could help us with this problem</p>
<p> of the aging population?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we have changed the policy. I mean we have already done this.</p>
<p> We inherited an immigration policy that was grossly skewed against</p>
<p> skilled migration and we changed it, and we have brought in far more</p>
<p> emphasis on skilled migration. So if the Labor Party is now saying</p>
<p> that it supports that, then I welcome their expression of bipartisan</p>
<p> support for a greater emphasis on skilled migration.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you see any need at this stage for a rise in the number of those</p>
<p> skilled migrants?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We look at it each year according to Australia's national need.</p>
<p> I'm not going to commit the Government on the run to some kind</p>
<p> of dramatic change. We think we've got the balance right at the</p>
<p> moment, but we look at it each year and the immigration minister,</p>
<p> will in the normal course, be bringing a recommendation to Cabinet</p>
<p> for the next annual intake. And we'll make a decision based on</p>
<p> the needs of the Australian community. But I repeat that we fixed</p>
<p> it when we came into office by putting a greater emphasis on skilled</p>
<p> migration.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Beazley said this morning that's the wrong approach, the year</p>
<p> by year look at immigration and it should be done on an quarter basis</p>
<p> [inaudible].</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Mr Beazley always goes out of his way to be different from the Government.</p>
<p> He's becoming an knee jerk oppositionist.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What's your reaction to the figures from the Chamber of Industry</p>
<p> and Commerce that we need about 43,000 more than the current intake.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look I'm not going to conduct a debate at this news conference</p>
<p> on the whole thing. I've just said that what our policy is and</p>
<p> that we welcome debate.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The farmers on the southern tablelands are experiencing a very tough</p>
<p> time at the moment with the fires. What can the Government do to help?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there are standing arrangements to cover these situations. Once</p>
<p> again we see the magnificent response from the volunteers for the</p>
<p> fire services. The are particularly bad fires. The stock losses are</p>
<p> between 4,000 and 5,000 which was really quite devastating for many</p>
<p> of the farmers, the primary producers in that area. But we have standing</p>
<p> arrangements which automatically come into play between the Commonwealth</p>
<p> and the State governments. But I express the admiration of the Government</p>
<p> to the people of the tablelands area who've fought so hard against</p>
<p> these fires and continue to do so. We are a great volunteer society</p>
<p> and they deserve our gratitude.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you make of the discrepancy between Bruce Baird's claim</p>
<p> that there was an agreement between him and some of the top media</p>
<p> bosses to ignore stories about the duchessing of Olympic officials</p>
<p> in the lead up to Sydney's Olympic bid?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Go and ask Bruce Baird about that. I'm not here to give a running</p>
<p> commentary on everything in the newspaper.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you accept that your Senate Committee, the Government Senate Committee</p>
<p> on the GST has accepted the fact that the GST, there's no economic</p>
<p> difference whether food's included or not?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don't. That interpretation is quite wrong. If you read what</p>
<p> they said they didn't say that. They in fact said no evidence</p>
<p> was presented to the inquiry to justify the exclusion of food. And</p>
<p> they also went on to say that in efficiency terms the inclusion of</p>
<p> food was desirable and they also went on to say further that no evidence</p>
<p> of disadvantage for the less well off in the community was demonstrated.</p>
<p> The reporting of their conclusions is misplaced and wrong and it doesn't</p>
<p> support the argument that there is no economic difference whether</p>
<p> you have food in or out.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you concerned that after these reports have come out, these first</p>
<p> rounds of reports, the Democrats certainly seem to be (inaudible)</p>
<p> their position?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think Peter that there is a long way to go before a final decision</p>
<p> is made and when you're in the situation of the Democrats you've</p>
<p> got to find something to say each day to sort of keep yourself in</p>
<p> the game. I don't think anybody should draw too many conclusions</p>
<p> from what people in the minor parties are saying at the present time.</p>
<p> We put this plan before the Australian people. We were courageous</p>
<p> enough to put ourselves on the line and to stand or fall on it. And</p>
<p> we intend to see implemented because the Australian people voted for</p>
<p> us. If the parliamentary process means anything then a government</p>
<p> that gets a mandate on such a difficult issue as that has a right</p>
<p> to introduce it, and I think the Australian people increasingly will</p>
<p> see our point of view on that.</p>
