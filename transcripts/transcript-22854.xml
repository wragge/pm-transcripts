    <content><![CDATA[<p>From the day we took office four years ago the Government has worked hard to tackle unemployment.</p>
<p>Thanks to the creation of 650,000 new jobs, the unemployment rate has fallen from 8.5 per cent in March 1996 to its lowest level in almost a decade at 6.7 per cent.  Now there are around 125,000 fewer Australians out of work than four years ago.</p>
<p>It is vital that these efforts be maintained because I strongly believe that unemployment remains too high, especially in some regional areas of Australia.</p>
<p>One way we can tackle this problem is through Work for the Dole which has implemented our principle of mutual obligation.  </p>
<p>In return for the communityâs help for those in need, young unemployed Australians are accepting the personal responsibility to give back to the country that supports them.</p>
<p>So far 57,000 young people have been part of 1,500 community based projects designed to give them greater self esteem and a new work ethic</p>
<p>The results are for all to see.</p>
<p>Recently I presented the annual Work for the Dole achievement awards where every major winner came from a location in regional Australia such as Wyong, Albany and Gympie.</p>
<p>Gosfordâs Troy Bryant received the best participantâs award for his work with the local council where he mastered practical skills such as fencing, concreting and landscaping.   </p>
<p>But it was Troyâs motivation of his peers and his encouragement of their work ethic that brought him praise and a full time job with the Gosford Council.</p>
<p>That is exactly the type of outcome Work for Dole is striving to achieve.</p>
<p>Troy joins the 70 per cent of participants who now feel greater self-esteem as a result of Work for the Dole, our practical programme to encourage hope, experience and responsibility amongst young Australians. </p>
