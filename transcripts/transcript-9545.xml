PRIME MINISTER: S. 29/ 9'<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ1 KEATING MP<br />
PROPOSED TRANS-TASMAN MUTUAL RECOGNITION AGREEMENT<br />
I am pleased to announce today a decision by the Council of Australian<br />
Governments ( COAG) to release, in conjunction with the New Zealand<br />
Government, a discussion paper on ' A Proposal for the Trans-Tasman Mutual<br />
Recognition of Standards for Goods and Occupations'.<br />
The objective of the proposed scheme is to reduce regulatory barriers to the<br />
trans-Tasman trade of goods and movement of people practising registered<br />
occupations. The release of the discussion paper marks the commencement<br />
of a public consultation period lasting until 31 July.<br />
One of the early initiatives of COAG was the signing of the Mutual<br />
Recognition Agreement ( MRA) in May 1992.<br />
The MRA was a significant reform for Australia. For the first time, an<br />
enterprise could sell its products anywhere in Australia without having to<br />
comply with a range of different State regulations relating to product<br />
standards, testing and certification, packaging and labelling.<br />
In many instances, this has led to reductions in compliance costs and<br />
increased economies of scale for business as well as greater choice for<br />
consumers. Similarly, a person registered to practise an occupation in one State or<br />
Territory is now able to obtain automatic registration to practise an equivalent<br />
occupation in any other, without having to go through the whole registration<br />
process again.<br />
A Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Agreement would extend the application<br />
of mutual recognition to New Zealand, leading to benefits for Australian and<br />
New Zealand businesses, consumers and service providers.<br />
Tariff barriers having been eliminated between Australia and New Zealand<br />
under the Closer Economic Relations ( CER) Trade Agreement, a mutual<br />
recognition agreement would reduce barriers to trade arising out of divergent<br />
regulations and standards. </p>
<p>For Australian business, a TTMRA will create a market of over 20 million<br />
people in which they can sell their goods free of tariffs and regulatory barriers<br />
to trade.<br />
Initiatives to support the reduction of regulatory barriers to trade are being<br />
considered by APEC.<br />
A Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Agreement would put Australia and New<br />
Zealand at the forefront of reducing regulatory barriers to trade and set a<br />
positive example to other APEC members as to what is achievable.<br />
