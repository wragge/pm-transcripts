ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
BUSINESS LUNCH<br />
ADELAIDE 20 NOVEMBER 1984<br />
HAKYOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT<br />
THE ECONOMY AND ABOUT ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT.<br />
THIS GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS EFFECTIVE ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT TO BE<br />
THE LYNCHPIN UPON WHICH ALL OUR OTHER ASPIRATIONS DEPEND,<br />
IN A VERY FUNDAMENTAL SENSE, A MORE RAPIDLY GROWING<br />
ECONOMIC CAKE PROVIDES MUCH GREATER OPPORTUNITY FOR ACHIEVING<br />
THE TYPE OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGES THAT SO MANY OF US<br />
WANT TO SEE.<br />
ECONOMIC GROWTH IS NOT IN SOME WAY AT ODDS WITH ACHIEVING<br />
A FAIRER AND MORE EQUITABLE SOCIETY. RATHER IT IS CRUCIAL<br />
TO ACHIEVING IT. OUR CAPACITY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF<br />
AUSTRALIANS WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED AND TO IMPROVE THE LIVING<br />
STANDARDS OF THOSE NOT FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE DIRECT BENEFICIARIES<br />
OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY BOTH GOALS OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY IS<br />
DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE,<br />
WHEN THIS GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED TWENTY MONTHS AGO, WE RECEIVED<br />
A MANDATE FROM THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE TO CARRY THROUGH A NEW<br />
APPROACH TO THE PROBLEMS THAT AFFLICTED OUR ECONOMY AND OUR<br />
NATION. WE UNDERTOOK AN APPROACH THAT MEANT THAT INFLATION AND<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT COULD BE SUCCESSFULLY TACKLED SIMULTANEOUSLY AND<br />
THAT MEANT THAT THE DEEP DIVISIONS IN OUR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL<br />
FABRIC COULD BE HEALED. </p>

LAST YEAR'S NATIONAL ECONOMIC SUMMIT WAS A WATERSHED IN THIS<br />
NEW APPROACH. IN THAT UNIQUE FORUM, WE OBTAINED THE SUPPORT<br />
OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE INCLUDING BO0TH THE TRADE UNION<br />
MOVEMENT AND BUSINESS.<br />
FROM BUSINESS PEOPLE I SOUGHT CO-OPERATION IN AN ATTEMPT TO<br />
MAKE THE PRICES AND INCOMES ACCORD WOR(, I PROMISED<br />
BUSINESS NOT JUST THE RESULTS OF A TEMPORARY ECONOMIC RECOVERY,<br />
BUT ALSO A FIRM BASIS ON WHICH A LASTING RECOVERY COULD BE BUILT.<br />
My GOVERNMENT COMMITTED ITSELF TO PROVIDE BUSINESS WITH STABLE,<br />
PREDICTABLE, COHERENT GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND CONTINUED<br />
EFFORTS TO MAKE THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT MORE CONDUCIVE TO<br />
INNOVATION, ENTERPRISE AND ECONOMIC GROWTH.<br />
THESE UNDERTAKINGS REFLECT THE BASIC ECONOMIC REALITY THAT<br />
IN OUR MIXED ECONOMY THE PRIVATE SECTOR PROVIDES THREE<br />
OUT OF EVERY FOUR JOBS. THEY MEANT THAT THE FOCUS OF OUR ECONOMIC<br />
POLICY WAS TO CREATE TOIE CONDITIONS FOR A PROFITABLE AND<br />
DYNAMIC BUSINESS SECTOR. THEY MEANT SETTING IN TRAIN POLICIES<br />
THAT WOULD REDUCE INTEREST RATES, CONTAIN BUSINESS COSTS,<br />
RESTORE OUR INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS, AND BOOST DEMAND<br />
WHILE. PRIVATE SECTOR ACTIVITY WAS WEAK. ONLY IN THIS WAY<br />
WOULD BUSINESS CONFIDENCE BE RESTORED AND THE NECESSARY<br />
BROADENING OF THE RECOVERY TAKE PLACE. </p>

NOW NINETEEN MONTHS AFTER THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE ALL THAT HAS<br />
BEEN ACHIEVED.<br />
THOSE OF YOU IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY t-MOST OF THIS<br />
AUDIENCE HARDLY NEED REMINDING OF THE DRAMATIC TURNAROUND<br />
IN THE ECONOMY SINCE THE MIDDLE OF LAST YEAR.<br />
YOU KNOW THAT FR~ OM A PERIOD OF RECESSION, FALLING EMPLOYMENT,<br />
HIGH INFLATION AND A STAGNATING BUSINESS SECTOR, WE NOW<br />
HAVE A STRONG AND INCREASINGLY BROADLY BASED RECOVERY IN<br />
OUTPUT AND EMPLOYMENT, INDEED NO-ONE COULD<br />
REASONABLY EXPECT ECONOMIC IND) ICATORS TO TESTIFY MORE<br />
CONSISTENTLY TO THE SUCCESS OF THE CO-OPERATIVE APPROACH<br />
WHICH WE HAVE FOSTERED. NOR COULD ANYONE HOPE FOR A SET<br />
OF INDICATORS WHICH DEMONSTRATED MORE CONVINCINGLY THAT,<br />
IN ARRIVING AT OUR POLICY CHOICES, WE HAVE STRUCK THE<br />
RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN, ON THE ONE HAND, THE NEED FOR<br />
ECONOMIC STIMULUS WHILE PRIVATE SECTOR ACTIVITY WAS WEAK<br />
WHILE, ON THE OTHER HAND,#( THE NEED THEREAFTER TO PROGRESSIVELY<br />
CUT BACK ON FISCAL STIMULUS SO AS TO ALLOW RECOVERY TO BECOME<br />
SELF SUSTAINED. s o m4/ 1 </p>

IHIGHLIGHTED JUST SOME OF THOSE INDICATORS IN MY POLICY<br />
SPEECH, EMPLOYMENT IS UP; INFLATION IS DOWN; INT REST*<br />
RATES HAVE DECLINED; CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS AT RECORD<br />
LEVELS; BUSINESS CONFIDENCE HAS BEEN-RESTORED; BUSINESS<br />
INVESTMENT IS GROWING BY THE MONTH; THE HOUSING INDUSTRY<br />
IS BUOYANT; MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION IS RISING, BUSINESS<br />
PROFITS ARE UP AND LABOUR COSTS CONTROLLED; INDUSTRIAL<br />
DISPUTES ARE DRAMATICALLY DOWNi AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR<br />
BORROWING REQUIREMENT AS A RATIO To GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT<br />
Wll FALL SUBSTANTIALLY, THIS FINANCIAL YEAR,<br />
TODAY NOBODY ANY LONGER QUESTIONS THAT THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY<br />
IS WELL AND TRULY UNDERWAY. BUT THERE ARE MOIRE<br />
PROMI SING DEVELOPMENTS.<br />
I POINTED OUT YESTERDAY IN COLLIE IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA<br />
THAT OUR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE NEXT YEAR WILL BE STRENGTHENED<br />
BY THE RETURN OF GROWTH IN RESOURCES INVESTMENT, WHICH HAS<br />
REMAINED DEPRESSED SO EAR IN THE RECOVERY. IPOINTED OUT THAT<br />
OVEn TIlC PA3T THREE MONTHS, SIrq~. t WL H-NISHED WORK ON THE<br />
BUDGET, MAJOR RESOURCE DEVELOPMENTS TO THE VALUE OF ABOUT<br />
BILLION HAVE MOVED FROM BEING " GOOD IDEAS" TO BEING<br />
CONSIDERED BY THEIR PRIVATE SPONSORS AS CERTAIN TO PROCEED<br />
THROUGH 1985. 5/ </p>
<p>N IS~ : 11~\ 7C ColINUNI _ A.' 11i' A I UE FBA: 09 22N4-.1!<br />
THIS NEW RESOURCE INVESTMENT WILL BE ON TOP OF INVESTMENT<br />
THAT IS STRONGLY GROWING IN OTHER SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY,<br />
IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT THE BUDGET ESTIMATE OF 5 PER CENT.<br />
REAL GROWTH IN PRIVATE INVESTMENT THIS FINANCIAL YEAR<br />
WILL BE EASILY EXCEEDED.<br />
MOREOVER, THE RESOURCE PROJECTS WHICH NOW SEEM CERTAIN<br />
TO PROCEED DURING 1985 ARE ONLY THE BEGINNING. A RANGE<br />
OF OTHER PROJECTS, INCLUDING THE RE-OPENING OF THE<br />
KWINANA BLAST FURNACE FOR PRODUCTION OF PIG IRON FOR<br />
CHINA, ARE AT A PROMISING STAGE OF NEGOTIATION.<br />
THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE OCCURRING IN AN ECONOMIC CLIMATE<br />
WHICH, EVEN WITHOUT NEW RESOURCES INVESTMENT, WOULD LOOK<br />
VERY PROMISING INDEED. THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS ALREADY<br />
WIDELY BASED, AND SOUTHi AUSTRALIA IS FULLY SHARING IN<br />
THAT RECOVERY.<br />
INDEED YOUR STATE IS A LEADER IN THE NATIONAL HOUSING<br />
RECOVERY WITH DWELLING COMMENCEMENTS INCREASING BY MORE<br />
THAN 50 PER CENT LAST FINANCIAL YEAR. EMPLOYMENT IN<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIA HAS SHOWN A WELCOME GROWTH OF MORE THAN<br />
3 PER CENT OVER THE YEAR TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDING<br />
IN OCTOBER. WE WANT TO SEE THAT CONTINUE.<br />
ONE OF THE ENCOURAGING FEATURES OF OUR PERIOD IN OFFICE<br />
SO FAR HAS BEEN THE SUCCESS WE HAVE HAD IN REDUCING<br />
INTEREST RATES FROM THE RECORD LEVELS OF OUR PREDECESSORS. 0 6<br />

IN THE CASE OF HOUSING INTEREST RATES THE FALLS HAVE<br />
GENERALLY BEEN AROUND ONE PERCENTAGE POINT. IN THE<br />
CASE OF MOST OTHER INTEREST RATES THE FALLS HAVE, BEEN'<br />
MUCH LARGER. AND, THE BEST IS STILL AHEAD OF US,<br />
AUSTRALIA AND AUSTRALIANS WILL DURING 19a5 REAP THEC<br />
INTEREST RATE REWARDS THAT ARE FLOWING FROM THE<br />
SUCCESSFUL POLICIES OF THE PAST 20 MONTHS. WE'VE<br />
PLOUGHED THE FIELDS AND SOWN THE SEEDS. IN THE VERY<br />
NEW FUTURE, WE WILL HARVEST THE CROP.<br />
BUT, OF COURSE, WE MUST CONTINUE THE POLICIES THAT ARE<br />
STARTING TO HAVE SUCH PRODUCTIVE EFFECT.<br />
THAT REQUIRES, FIRST OF ALL, THAT INFLATION BE KEPT<br />
UNDER CONTROL BECAUSE WITHOUT CONTROL OF INFLATIONARY<br />
PRESSURES AND INFLATIONARY EXPECTATIONS INTEREST RATES<br />
CANNOT ' BE B3ROUGHT DOWN OR KEPT DOWN. WE HAVE ALREADY<br />
HALVED INFLATION. WE EXPECT INFLATION WILL BE LESS THAN<br />
FIVE PER CENT IN THE Y'EAR AHEAD AND WE ARE DETERMINED<br />
TO KEEP IT BELOW FIVE PER CENT.<br />
CONTINUED MODERATION IN INTEREST RATES WILL ALSO REQUIRE<br />
RENEWED EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE BURDEN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT<br />
SECTOR PLACES ON FINANCIAL MARKETS. WE HAVE ALREADY<br />
MADE EXCELLENT PROGRESS IN OUR FIRST TERM. AND ONCE AGAIN<br />
ICAN ASSURE THE COMMUNITY THAT WE WILL CONTINUE OUR<br />
WORK OF PUTTING THE PUBLIC FINANCES OF THIS NATION BACK<br />
IN ORDER'At.' D CREATING THE CONDITIONS WHERE FURTHER INTEREST<br />
RATE REDUCTIONS CAN OCCUR. </p>

IN OTHER WORDS, AT PRESENT, THE OUTLOOK FOR INTEREST<br />
RATES IS AS BRIGHT AS IT HAS BEEN FOR MORE THAN A<br />
DECADE,<br />
BY CONTRAST, THE OUTLOOK FOR INTEREST RATES WOULD BE<br />
BLEAK IF THE COALITION POLICIES WERE PUT-IN AFFECT<br />
AFTER DECEMBER 1. THE OPPOSITION'S ECONOMIC POLICIES<br />
ARE, QUITE SIMPLY, A GUARANTEED RECIPE FOR HIGHER<br />
INTEREST RATES. RISING INTEREST RATES WOULD, FOR A<br />
STARTr, BE THE INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE OF THE INFLATIONARY<br />
WAGE-PRICE SPIRAL THAT WOULD BE CREATED BY THE OPPOSITION'S<br />
WAGES POLICY WHICH PROPOSES THE DISMANTLING OF THE<br />
CENTRALISED WAGES SYSTEM UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE<br />
PRICES AND INCOMES ACCORD, WHICH PROPOSES THE UNDERMINING<br />
OF THE ARBITRATION SYSTEM AND WHICH INVITES TRADE UNIONS<br />
TO GO OUT INTO THE MARKET PLACE AND ACHIEVE WHATEVER<br />
WAGE INCREASES THEY CAN THROUGH THE UNFETTERED EXERCISE<br />
OF INDUSTRIAL MUSCLE.<br />
HIGHER INTEREST RATES. WOULD ALSO BE THE INEVITABLE<br />
CONSEQUENCE OF THE MASSIVE INDIRECT TAX SLUG THE OPPOSITION<br />
IS PROPOSING AS PART OF ITS TAX POLICY. THAT CUMULATIVE<br />
INDIRECT TAX SLUG WOULD DIRECTLY AND SHARPLY LIFT THE<br />
CONSUMER PRICE INDEX, FEED INTO. THE WAGES PRICES SPRIAL<br />
AND CREATE ADDITIONAL INFLATIONARY PRESSURES THAT WOULD<br />
PUT IRRESISTIBLE PRESSURE ON INTEREST RATES. NOT ONLY<br />
WOULD WE NOT YET HAVE THE REDUCTIONS THAT WE EXPECT NEXT<br />
YEAR BUT THERE WOULD BE EVERY REASON TO EXPECT AN INCREASE<br />
Of ABOUT 2 PER CENT IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. </p>

THE BUSINESS COMIMUNITY WOULD SUFFER AND AUSTRALIAN<br />
FAMILIES WOULD SUFFER. FOR EXAMPLE, A TWO PER CENT<br />
INCREASE IN HOUSING LOAN INTEREST RATES WOULD ADD'AROUND<br />
$ 44L TO THE MONTHLY REPAYMENT OF AN AVERAGE FAMILY<br />
PAYING OFF ITS OWN HOME.<br />
CORRESPONDING INTEREST RATE INCREASES IN OTHER AREAS<br />
WOULD SERIOUSLY WEAKEN INVESTMENT, RISK THE POSTPONEMENT<br />
OR CANCELLATION OF NEW DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, DAMAGE<br />
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND UNDERMINE JOB PROSPECTS.<br />
THAT IS THE STARK CONTRAST THE AVERAGE AUSTRALIAN AND<br />
THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS CONFRONTED WITH. THE CERTAINTY<br />
OF FURTHER REDUCTIONS IN INTEREST RATES UNDER THE PROVEN,.<br />
INTEGRATED ECONOMIC POLICIES OF my GOVERNMENT, AND<br />
AGAINST THAT, THE INEVITABILITY OF A RETURN TO RECORD<br />
HIGH INTEREST RATES UNDER THE SAME IRRESPONSIBLE,<br />
UNCOORDINATED HOTCH-POTCH POLICIES OF OUR OPPONENTS<br />
POLICIES WHICH PRODUCED THOSE DISASTROUS RESULTS IN THE<br />
PAST AND WHICH WOULD.. 4AS I SAY, INEVITABLY DO THE SAME<br />
AGAIN. THE TASK WE WILL FACE IN OUR NEXT TERM OF OFFICE IS TO<br />
TURN--THE RECOVERY NOW UNDERWAY INTO SUSTAINED STRONG<br />
GROWTH WITH LOW INFLATION, AND TO ENSURE THAT THE<br />
BUSINESS CLIMATE REMAINS FAVOURABLE FOR NEW INVESTMENT<br />
AND FOR NEW JOBS, .6/ 9, .09 </p>

IN ORDER TO MEET OUR OBJECTIVES FOR GROWTH, EMPLOYMENT AND<br />
INFLATION DURING OUR SECOND TERM, I HAVE MADE FIRM COMITMENTS<br />
IN THE VITAL AREA OF FISCAL POLICY.<br />
THOSE COMMITMENTS ARE ON THREE SPECIFIC MATTERS THE BURDEN<br />
OF TAXATIONj THE SIZE OF THE BUDGET DEFICIT AND THE GROWTH<br />
OF GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE. OVER THE NEXT TERM OF THIS<br />
GOVERNMENT THERE WILL BE NO OVERALL INCREASE IN THE BURDEN<br />
OF TAXATION, THERE WILL BE A REDUCTION OF THlE DEFICIT AS A<br />
PROPORTION OF GDP AND EXPENDITURE GROWTH WILL NOT BE AS<br />
FAST AS GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY.<br />
THESE COMMITMENTS REFLECT THE FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE THIS<br />
GOVERNMENT ATTACHES TO SUSTAINING ECONOMIC GROWTH. THEY<br />
REFLECT OUR BELIEF THAT WHAT THE ECONOMIY AND BUSINESS IN<br />
PARTICULAR, NEED FROM GOVERNMENT IS A STABLE AND PREDICTABLE<br />
POLICY ENVIRONMENT. THEY PROVIDE ASSURANCE TO BUSINESS OF A<br />
LONG TERM ENVIRONMENT FAVOURABLE TO INVESTMENT AND TO GROWTH.<br />
WITH THE POLICIES WE ARE PURSUING, BUSINESS CAN BFE CONFIDENT<br />
THAT THE TIME IS RIPE FOR MEASURED EXPANSION AND GROWTH<br />
AND FOR FURTHER INVESTMENT IN THEIR OWN BUSINESSi IN THEIR<br />
OWN F UTURES AND IN AUSTRALIA'S FUTURE. </p>
