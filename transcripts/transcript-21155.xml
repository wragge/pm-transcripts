    <content><![CDATA[<p>It gives me great pleasure today to announce the membership of the Australian National Council on Drugs (ANCD) for its forthcoming three year term, under the continuing chairmanship of Major Brian Watters AO.</p>
<p>  The ANCD is the Australian Government's key advisory body on illicit drugs policy.  It has played an important role in the development and implementation of effective strategies to address illicit drug use in our communities.</p>
<p>  I am confident that the new membership of the ANCD has the right mix of experience, knowledge and expertise to provide advice to government on this very complex matter.  The ANCD's advice over the next three years will be vital to support ongoing policy and programmes and to shape government responses to emerging illicit drug priorities, including:</p>
<p> * amphetamines and other stimulant drugs;   * treatment programmes for people with both mental health and illicit drug problems; and   * working collaboratively with countries in the Asia-Pacific region to combat illicit drugs.</p>
<p> Many challenges remain in our fight against illicit drugs in this country.  Together the ANCD and the Australian Government will continue to develop and implement a balanced and comprehensive response though law enforcement, prevention, education and treatment services.</p>
<p>To those departing members, I thank you for your dedication and hard work on the ANCD and wish you well in your future endeavours.  I would also like to welcome four new members and look forward to working with the new ANCD in the future.</p>
<p>The full list of the ANCD's membership is attached.</p>
