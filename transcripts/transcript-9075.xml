PRIME MINISTER 143/ 93<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
VISIT BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF LAOS<br />
I am pleased to announce that the Prime Minister of the Lao People's Democratic<br />
Republic, His Excellency Mr Khamtay Siphandone, and Mrs Thongvanh Siphandone<br />
will make a State visit to Australia, as guests of the Australian Government, from 14 to<br />
19 December.<br />
Prime Minister Khamtay will be accompanied by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the<br />
Minister of Industry and Handicraft, as well as senior Lao officials. The Prime<br />
Minister will have talks in Canberra before attending a privately organised trade and<br />
investment forum in Sydney entitled ' Indochina and Beyond: A New Regional Focus'.<br />
Australia is developing its links with Laos -and there is good potential for further<br />
expanding commercial ties. Two way trade is increasing and Australian companies are<br />
involved in major infrastructure projects. In 1992 Australian exports to Laos totalled<br />
$ 20.4 million with strong sales of gold, silver and platinum. Transfield recently<br />
concluded a development agreement with the Government of Laos for a hydro-electric<br />
power station at Nam Theun. The billion dollar project is the largest and most<br />
important ever negotiated by the Lao Government. This is a tribute to the<br />
professionalism of Australian business and the experience which Australia can bring to<br />
such substantial infrastructure projects.<br />
Australia is a significant aid donor to Laos, with a program of development<br />
cooperation activities valued at $ 9.5 million in 1993-94. The Mekong friendship<br />
bridge designed, constructed and funded by Australia is a symbol of our<br />
commitment to Laos's development. I look forward to attending the opening of the<br />
bridge in April next year.<br />
Prime Minister Khamntay's visit provides an opportunity to strengthen government-togovernment<br />
links between our two countries and to discuss how we might build on the<br />
solid foundation we have established for economic relations.<br />
