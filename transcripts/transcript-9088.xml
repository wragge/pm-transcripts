PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISThR, THE BON P J KEATING MP<br />
THE HON JOHN DAWK[ NS MP<br />
I congratulate John Dawkins on his courageous personal decision to relinquish the post<br />
of Federal Treasurer to return to the backbench, with a view to eventually retiring from<br />
Parliament before the next election.<br />
I am, of course, saddened at the departure from the Cabinet of a friend and colleague<br />
of such distinction, passion and ability.<br />
As I said in the Parliament tonight, in John Dawkins we saw the Cabinet Minister's role<br />
performed par excellence.<br />
John Dawkins has had a highly significant mninisterial career, spanning about I1I years.<br />
Among his many achievements, his spearheading of the formation of the Cairns Group<br />
of agrcultural trading nations stands out as a major contribution to public fife in<br />
national and international terms.<br />
He has, of course, achieved many other things in public life in Australia, in a range of<br />
Ministries. He will be remembered for reforms to public sector management; his<br />
transformation of the tertiary education system, and his tireless work on the<br />
Government's Expenditure Review Commidttee. Most recently and particularly as<br />
Treasurer, he has played a significant role in the reformation of Australia's economy for<br />
a new, outward looking and competitive era.<br />
He has been one of the great reformers within the Labor Government.<br />
He leaves the office of Treasurer with Australia growing strongly; with inflation<br />
beaten; and with economnic indicators pointing inexorably towards a strong recovery<br />
and new prosperity for Australians.<br />
I salute John Dawkins and congratulate him on the grace and style with which he<br />
reached and announced this important personal decision. I extend my best and<br />
warmest wishes for the future to him, to his wife Magge, and to their family including<br />
their newborn baby girl, Alice Esther.<br />
