PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 31 DECEMBER 1987<br />
I warmly congratulate Peter Dowding as Western Australia's<br />
new Premier-elect.<br />
I am confident that the election of Mr Dowding will ensure<br />
that the popular, stable and forward-thinking leadership<br />
provided by his predecessor, Mr Brian Burke, over the past<br />
five years will continue in Western Australia.<br />
Mr Dowding will bring to his Premiership wide experience and<br />
a strong social conscience, particularly in the youth area,<br />
and is certain to build on Labor's substantial record of<br />
achievement in Western Australia.<br />
I know that the close relationship that exists between my<br />
Government and the WA Government will continue under his<br />
leadership, and I look forward to working with him. 003714 </p>
