MIDDLE EAST MARCH 19279<br />
The Prime Minister said today that the Australian Government<br />
welcomed the dramatic progress towards an Egyptian/ Israeli<br />
peace treaty which had been achieved during President Carter's<br />
recent visit to Egypt and Israel. " The prospects for the<br />
signature of a treaty are clearly now very good", the<br />
Prime Minister said.<br />
The Prime Minister paid tribute to the statesmanship of<br />
President Carter whose personal initiatives both at Camp David<br />
last September and in making his recent visit to the Middle<br />
East had kept alive the Egyptian/ Israeli dialogue at times<br />
when deadlock appeared likely. He also praised the courage<br />
of President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin in their willingness<br />
to work tirelessly in the interest of achieving a treaty.<br />
The Prime Minister said a treaty between Egypt and Israel<br />
would be an historic event not only in itself, but in the<br />
stimulus it would provide to bring about peace in the Middle<br />
East as a whole. The Australian Government hoped that other<br />
Arab States, w~ hose participation in the peace process will be<br />
necessary if there is to be a lasting Middle East settlement,<br />
could also be encouraged to join future negotiations. The<br />
Prime Minister expressed the hope that as the treaty was<br />
implemented, the doubts of other Arab States would lessen and<br />
that work on a comprehensive Middle East settlement would proceed.<br />
The Prime Minister concluded by reaffirming the Australian<br />
Government's support for all moves designed to end the long<br />
years of tension and suffering in the Middle East, and to bring<br />
about a stability and peace absent from the region for so long.<br />
