<p>Australia's first National Security Strategy highlights the dramatic economic and strategic shift towards the Asia-Pacific region and provides a blueprint for national security over the next decade.</p>
<p>Complementing the Australia in the Asian Century White Paper, the National Security Strategy will ensure Australia takes advantage of the opportunities of the Asian Century whilst focussing national security efforts on the risks and challenges that come with change in the region.</p>
<p>The attacks of 11 September 2001 remain the most influential national security event in recent history. The threat of global terrorism heralded a new era for national security in Australia and worldwide.</p>
<p>But it is critical we continue to review and update our priorities and policies as the national security environment evolves with the rise of Asia.</p>
<p>The National Security Strategy will ensure Australia remains one of the world's safest and most secure countries.</p>
<p>The Strategy  -  which builds on the Government's 2008 National Security Statement  -  will guide the country's response to risks and identifies the main challenges and threats to Australia's national security, including instability in our region, conflict and coercion affecting our interests, malicious cyber activity, terrorism, espionage, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and serious and organised crime.</p>
<p>The number of cyber incidents has increased by 42 per cent over the past two years. The strategy emphasises the necessity of partnerships  -  with the Australian community, business and international governments  -  to better protect the country against potentially devastating cyber-attacks and to meet other national security challenges.</p>
<p>It will also encourage the innovation Australia will need to help manage the security risks of the future.</p>
<p>The National Security Strategy will ensure our Defence Force, police, diplomats, border protection personnel and intelligence agencies continue to work cohesively together by providing focus across government.</p>
<p>The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, under the guidance of the National Security Adviser, will drive implementation of the Strategy across Government.</p>
<p>Copies of the Strategy will be made available online at <a href="http://www.dpmc.gov.au">www.dpmc.gov.au</a></p>
