JRNLST: Prime Minister, knockers ignoring Australia's record for racial tolerance?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Knockers? Yes, they are. I am fed up with the self-flagellation to which some in this country<br />
believe we should subject ourselves. I think we have blemishes, of course we have blemishes. But<br />
if you look at the overall record, especially in the last generation, we are a tolerant, open,<br />
harmonious society. We've welcomed people from the four corners of the earth. We took more<br />
Indo'-Chinese refugees per capita than any other country in the world. We have a meticulously<br />
non-. discriminatory immigration policy and so far as I am concerned, and I think I speak on behalf<br />
of millions of Australians, I am fed up with the sense of defensiveness and the self-flagellation that<br />
some want us to submit ourselves to.<br />
We can look the rest of the world in the eye and be very proud of our record and we should bend<br />
the knee to no country overseas when it comes to the record of racial tolerance and the record of a<br />
harmonious society. I mean, we have done things in this society that no other society on earth has<br />
done. President Clinton acknowledged that when he came to Australia in October of last year and,<br />
I think it's about time more Australians said what I've said in very open and direct terms.<br />
JRNLST: What's made you so fed up now, Prime Minister about this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I guess the reminder, having gone overseas, ofjust what a successful society this is. That's<br />
not mneant to be a criticism of America or Britain, they're pretty harmonious, tolerant societies,<br />
civilised societies as well. There is no particular reason. I mean, do I have to have a reason. It's<br />
not a blinding flash. It's just a very strong conviction and what is important is not the timing,<br />
rather the substance of what I'm saying and what I'm saying is that this is a tolerant, open society.<br />
And we talk ourselves down if we run around saying that we should be ashamed of this or that.<br />
Now, of course, we have blemishes. Of course we treated the indigenous people of this country<br />
very badly in the past and of course, we should make amends by giving them a better and a more<br />
fulsome future. But if you look at the broad sweep of the last 30 or 40 years, we have built an<br />
open, diverse, tolerant, remarkable society and it's about time more Australians said it and stopped<br />
apologising for the past and stopped apologising for what we have achieved.<br />
JRNLST: You've talked about a separate administrative structure for the Torres Strait Islands this morning.<br />
What will that mean for ATSIC and how will it work9<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I think you'll in a sense have a Torres Strait Islander, ATSIC type arrangement. It's just that<br />
they want to be dealt with differently and separately from the Aboriginal community. It's not that<br />
they have any hostility to them, it's just that they are a distinctive group and they clearly are. I<br />
mean, anybody who understands the history of the indigenous people of Australia will recognise the </p>
<p>sharp differences and we recognise that and in the spirit of proper devolution and subsidiarity and<br />
whatever other principle you want to apply, it ought to occur.<br />
JRNLST: How soon would you expect that to be in place?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we would want it in place by the year 2000. In fact, we may have some legislation fairly soon.<br />
JRNLST: Prime Minister, there are two Black Panthers on the US Olympics Organising Committee who will<br />
be coming to Australia in the next few months. The fact that the Government is going to ban<br />
Lorenzo Ervin, does that mean that those two Black Panthers will be banned as well?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, the reason that I objected to Mr Ervin was because he had a criminal conviction. I don't<br />
think you'll find any reference in what I said to his membership of particular organisations. I found<br />
it bizarre, extraordinary, incredible that somebody who'd been given two life sentences for<br />
hijacking an aircraft and kidnapping the people on board should be allowed into this country and I<br />
don't think any Australian needs much more explanation than that.<br />
JRNLST: Why can't the Australian Government forgive him if he's received the US Presidential pardon?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, what happens in America is for Americans. What happens in Australia is for Australians. We<br />
do not want people of proven bad character in this country. If it was good enough to exclude<br />
people like Gerry Adams who runs the Sinn Fein which is the political wing of a terrorist<br />
organisation. And if its good enough to ban David Irving, I think it's good enough to keep this<br />
particular man out and may I say that I am echoing certainly the sentiments, if not the precise views<br />
of Aboriginal leaders. I saw Neville Bonnor the other night properly warning the Aboriginal people<br />
to stay away from this character.<br />
JRNLST: Prime Minister, should Australians be prepared to take lower wages in the interests of creating<br />
more jobs?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Now look, I'm not arguing that we should cut minimum wages, let me make that clear. What I'm<br />
saying is that one of the reasons that unemployment in the United States is lower than it is in<br />
Australia is because traditionally America's minimum wage structure has been different, but I'm not<br />
saying that the Australian ethos, which is that if you get a job you should have a decent minimum<br />
wage, I don't think that ethos should be altered. But I do think people should understand when<br />
they seek to compare the unemployment levels in our country and the United States that one of the<br />
reasons why the American jobless rate is lower, one of them, it is not the only reason, is because it<br />
has a different minimum wage structure.<br />
JRNLST: Prime Minister, does this mean that the rock solid guarantee on take-home pay that you had at the<br />
last election will be the Coalition policy for the next election?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh, there is no backing away from the rock solid guarantee, no. Nor is there any backing away, I<br />
saw some suggestion this morning of a backing away in relation to the dole. I mean the level of the 2 </p>
<p>dole is not in my view the issue. If people have no other means of support than the unemployment<br />
benefit it's certainly not a large sum on which to live. I have strong views about the conditions that<br />
should attach to people getting the unemployment benefit but if they meet those conditions then it's<br />
certainly not a princely sum and I don't think any fair minded Australian would argue that it is but I<br />
do think fair minded Australians are increasingly supporting the principle that I espouse of mutual<br />
obligation. Tony Blair interestingly enough calls it reciprocal obligation and that principle of mutual obligation<br />
is that society should help people by providing a proper safety net but in return, society is entitled<br />
to say to those people from time to time you will be called upon to do something in return for that<br />
benefit, and that is why we promoted work for the dole and that is why I look forward to the pilots<br />
in work for the dole being up and running. There are, according to my advice, many organisations<br />
around Australia who are enthusiastic to participate in the work for the dole scheme. I think it has<br />
wide support. I think it drives home a very important Australian principle. It's another part, in my<br />
view, of what we should develop in the Australian ethos and that is the principle of mutual<br />
obligation and I think we have to see all of these things as an integrated approach. We look after<br />
peop~ le but in return they can be called upon to do something. If they are able bodied and healthy<br />
they can be called upon to do something in return and I think there's wide support for that in the<br />
Australian community and particularly wide support for it amongst many people who have been<br />
touched by unemployment.<br />
JRNLST: So on minimum wages, Mr Howard, could I just clarify, what you're saying is that Australia will<br />
not be able to achieve as low an unemployment rate as America if it chooses not to drop its<br />
minimum wage?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No what I am saying is that one of the reasons at the moment why there is a differential is that the<br />
Americans have lower minimum wages. I am not going to say that you wouldn't still get to a much<br />
lower rate in this country with the current approach to minimum wages. I am just saying at the<br />
moment in existing conditions that's one of the explanations and I think it's important in the debate<br />
about unemployment that we understand that every society makes trade offs and we have always<br />
had an ethos in this country of a fairly high, decent minimum wage and I am not arguing that that<br />
should go. I haven't argued that. I think if you look at what I have said, I have been very careful<br />
not to argue that but I have been quite deliberate in pointing out to the Australian people that if you<br />
look at America, one of the reasons why the Americans have gone further down the track in<br />
reducing unemployment than we have is the minimum wage situation but there are other things<br />
about American society less desirable that I don't wish to import into Australia. I mean, there's no<br />
doubt that social breakdown and dislocation and levels of crime in the United States are much<br />
higher than they are in Australia. Now people will argue for decades about the linkages between<br />
those things and welfare benefits and so forth and everybody will have different views but you have<br />
to look once again at all of these things to get an overall picture but our approach as enunciated at<br />
the last election remains but it's important that people understand when you look at the United<br />
States that that is in present circumstances one of the reasons why there's a differential.<br />
JRNLST: Are you calling for a national debate on this subject?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't know that, I mean, I have been described as calling for a national debate<br />
JRNLST: You said it a couple of times </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes well I like having national debates about lots of things, Tony. Look, I think of course you<br />
should debate unemployment. Of course we should have a better understanding of why the level of<br />
unemployment in Australia is where it is. I mean, we're having a Cabinet meeting in a few weeks<br />
time that's going to be devoted almost entirely to talking about the unemployment issue. Now, that<br />
doesn't mean to say that we're going to turn things on their head. But what it does mean to say<br />
that from time to time my Government will set aside a whole day for senior Minister to just focus<br />
on an issue, rather than working through an agenda and dealing with some submissions on narrow<br />
topics.<br />
We did it on health and we're going to do it on unemployment and I expect that we're going to do<br />
it on defence and foreign policy and I daresay we might have the odd discussion on taxation over<br />
the next few months.<br />
JRNLST: In calling for a national debate though and mentioning repeatedly the American experience on<br />
minimal wages and the link with unemployment benefits which are much lower also,<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't know that I mentioned the link with unemployment benefits.<br />
JRNLST: Well you did.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I mentioned it but I don't think quite as frequently.<br />
JRNLST: You said that they could have a lower minimum wage because unemployment benefits were much<br />
lower than Australia.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I did mention that once, yes.<br />
JRNLST: Aren't you actually inviting Australians to look at this very seriously as a possible way to go in the<br />
future? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, think I'm doing no more or less than what I said. And, I think you're, I think that's an<br />
interpretation that you may choose. As a free citizen you have a right to choose to put that<br />
interpretation on it, but I had no more or less purpose in raising the issue than what I've explained<br />
to you over the last few minutes, that if we are debating these issues and, people often say to me<br />
well, why is America's unemployment rate than Australia's? They do, they say that to me, I get<br />
asked that and it's a fair question and what I'm saying in reply is one of the reasons is that America<br />
has a different minimum wage structure and a different welfare structure. I mean it is much harder<br />
to get unemployment benefits support in the United States than it is in Australia. We have made it<br />
appropriately a little tighter and in fairness to the rest of the community, but it is somewhat<br />
different in the United States and there's a long history to that.<br />
I mean, Australia has a different ethos than the Americans and it is important that we understand<br />
these things. There is a great danger in all these debates that people will make sort of, they will<br />
extrapolate from the experience of one country to another, without understanding the cultural and<br />
historical differences that have shaped the institution of the two societies. </p>
<p>JRNLST: Prime Minister, I wonder if I could ask you a question. about small business. Are you concerned at<br />
all at the Reserve Bank's decision to sell off two thirds of its gold holdings will have, will force<br />
some marginal gold producers out of business.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I can't predict what's going to happen in a market as free-wheeling as gold.<br />
JRNLST: The pressure is going to be downwards not upwards.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I just don't know, I mean Jim, I'm not going to make myself a hostage to what's going to<br />
happen in the market in the next six, twelve, eighteen months or two years. Can I say that the<br />
Reserve Bank began, according to my advice, selling some months ago. If you look at the activities<br />
of gold mining companies, gold producers both in Australia and elsewhere, many of them have been<br />
themselves behaving in a way over recent months which has exerted a downward pressure on the<br />
price of gold. The Reserve Bank of Australia took a sensible, prudent, completely unexceptionable<br />
and utterly defensible position in the interests of Australia and in the interests of all of us in<br />
deciding to sell gold and put the proceeds into some interest-bearing securities. I mean, at a time of<br />
low inflation, and where the expectations are that the inflation will remain low for a long time, it<br />
plainly makes a lot of sense to get out of gold and get into Yen and to US dollars and to all sorts of<br />
other currencies and investments of that kind.<br />
The other point I reinforce is that you will find if you examine what's occurred over the past few<br />
months that a lot of the companies have been pretty busy in relation to gold futures and the<br />
combined effect of all of that is not to have been to exert an upward pressure on the gold price, but<br />
indeed rather to have exerted a downward pressure and I mean, I can understand the feelings of<br />
gold companies, but the Reserve Bank is an owner of gold resources and a player in the market like<br />
anybody else. It has a responsibility to the welfare of the Australian people and it took a shrewd,<br />
correct, defensible investment decision. It has copied, in doing so it has duplicated the behaviour of<br />
other central banks around the world and I find the criticism of the Reserve by some of the<br />
companies as a little rich and particularly against the background of some of the things that I have<br />
mertioned.<br />
JRNLST: But if the net effect is fewer rather than more jobs and few exports rather than more, isn't that bad?<br />
PRJ1ME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I just think Jim, you can't make long term predictions at the present moment. I mean, these<br />
things bounce around, they really do and the idea that you should go on holding an asset that<br />
doesn't give you any return, that is worth at the moment $ 2.5 billion but might be worth somewhat<br />
less and you're getting no return out of it, I tell you what, if your investment adviser behaved like<br />
that, you'd fire him and I mean, that really is the bottom line and the bank has the responsibility to<br />
the Australian people. It's written into its charter and it would be almost, you might say it's a<br />
breach of trust for the bank not to take proper care of the investment of the resources and what we<br />
have seen is the bank sell, put the money into other securities, it's strengthened the balance sheet.<br />
We haven't tried to grab it the way that I think one other western government tried to get hold of<br />
the proceeds of a conversion and I think the whole thing has been done in a very prudent,<br />
economically conservative, economically correct and economically orthodox way and I think the<br />
Reserve Bank has met its obligations very fully.<br />
