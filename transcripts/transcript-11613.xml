    <content><![CDATA[<p>During his interview with Senator Meg Lees on the "Sunday"</p>
<p> programme earlier today, Nine Network political editor, Laurie Oakes,</p>
<p> said that extra Defence spending would be paid for out of the sale of</p>
<p> the rest of Telstra.</p>
<p>Mr Oakes appeared to be referring to an article in The Age newspaper</p>
<p> on Saturday March 4.</p>
<p>Extra Defence spending is not linked to the sale of Telstra. I have,</p>
<p> however, said that if the rest of Telstra was sold then the Government</p>
<p> would be in a stronger position to accelerate spending on rural and regional</p>
<p> infrastructure.</p>
<p>I told The Age that Australia needed to spend more on Defence and that</p>
<p> tighter Defence budget management and greater budget flexibility in later</p>
<p> years would help to achieve this.</p>
<p>My remarks were not intended to give the impression that increased Defence</p>
<p> spending was contingent on the sale of Telstra.</p>
