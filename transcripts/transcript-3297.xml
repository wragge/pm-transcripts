PRESS STATMENT NO. 268<br />
VISIT TO CANADA BY THE MINISTER FOR SERVICES AND PROPERTY<br />
The Prime Minister, the Honourable E. G. Whitlam,<br />
today announced that the Honourable F. M. Daly, Minister<br />
for Services and Property, will study the conduct of the Federal<br />
elections in Cahiada, where polling is to take place on 8 July.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said. that, in view of the great public<br />
interest in electoral administration following the recent<br />
Australian elections, the elections presented an excellent<br />
opportunity to study the Canadian system with the possibility of<br />
improving the Australian legislation.<br />
Having regard to the period of three months required<br />
for the completion of the current Australian Senate elections,<br />
the Australian Government is particularly anxious to examine in<br />
depth the methods used and the time required for the finalisation<br />
of elections in Canada. To this end, Mr. Daly would visit<br />
several of the Provinces in addition to Ottawa.<br />
He would also be looking at several other aspects of the<br />
Canadian electoral legislation and procedures whilst the election<br />
is in progress, including voting procedures, political party<br />
campaign expenditure and a limitation thereon, allocation of time<br />
on television and radio for the promulgation of election matter,<br />
the " blackout" period prior to the elections, and, newspaper<br />
advertising. These aspects of electoral legislation were<br />
particularly relevant In view of the electoral legislation which<br />
the Government proposed to introduce early in the next Session.<br />
The Government is determined to improve the Australian<br />
Electoral system and will ensure that the-Electoral Office is given<br />
adequate facilities to administer our elections efficiently. The<br />
structure, systems and facilities of the Australian Electoral<br />
Office are currently being examined and the Government proposes to<br />
engage a Management Consultancy firm to assist the Australian<br />
Electoral Office and the Board in this examination.<br />
The Minister will be accompanied on his visit by Mr. F. Ley,<br />
Chief Australian Electoral Officer and Mr. I. F. Weise, Australian<br />
Electoral Officer for Queensland.<br />
