Your Majesty</p>
<p>Your Royal Highness</p>
<p>Her Excellency the Governor General</p>
<p>His Excellency Mr Bryce</p>
<p>Secretary General</p>
<p>Fellow Commonwealth leaders</p>
<p>Premier Barnett</p>
<p>Ministerial and Parliamentary colleagues</p>
<p>Delegates from around the Commonwealth</p>
<p>Other distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>I extend a very warm welcome to all leaders and delegates to this great city of Perth.</p>
<p>A city so emblematic of the resilience and optimism of the Australian character.</p>
<p>A city that looks out along the arc running from Asia and the Subcontinent to Africa where so much of the Commonwealth's history has been written.</p>
<p>It is the story of an Empire with a complex past, that chose to reinvent itself as a free association of nations, drawn from all six inhabited continents, and from many backgrounds, faiths and cultures.</p>
<p>The strength and success of our fellowship is no accident.</p>
<p>It comes from a commitment to make Commonwealth values real and present in the life of each member nation.</p>
<p>And to ensure those member nations that fall short understand that their peers want to see change.</p>
<p>Unlike other global bodies united by practical concerns such as commerce or trade, we are also joined by a very different motivation.</p>
<p>We are a "Commonwealth of values".</p>
<p>Shared values of peace, democracy, racial equality, the rule of law and a commitment to social and economic progress.</p>
<p>Shared values freely embraced and consensually expressed.</p>
<p>Values we can put to work in addressing some of the most pressing concerns that face our world like climate change, financial stability and food security.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth is vital to addressing such challenges.</p>
<p>Representing 54 nations and one-third of the world's people, how could it be otherwise?</p>
<p>But we also must be a more agile Commonwealth, equipped to respond when our values are tested and to speak clearly when our voice needs to be heard.</p>
<p>At Port of Spain we re-affirmed the special strengths that come from our unique heritage but we also resolved to make the Commonwealth stronger.</p>
<p>Friends, 2011 is a fitting moment for reflection and renewal because it marks the 80th anniversary of our association.</p>
<p>80 years since our predecessors endorsed the Statute of Westminster in 1931.</p>
<p>That year saw Gandhi imprisoned in the struggle for India's freedom.</p>
<p>Australia marvelled at the batting feats of a young cricketer called Bradman.</p>
<p>And a baby named Desmond Tutu was born in a remote town in the Transvaal.</p>
<p>Recently Archbishop Tutu celebrated his 80th birthday, and it is amazing to think of the changes that have occurred in just one lifetime:</p>
<p>The Cold War has come and gone.</p>
<p>New challenges like Aids and climate change have emerged.</p>
<p>Marvellous new technologies like the Internet have transformed the way we live.</p>
<p>The world has changed, and a wise institution changes too.</p>
<p>So as the Commonwealth journeys towards its centenary, it is time for renewal.</p>
<p>To answer the question posed of our organisation  -  how do we best pursue our timeless values in a world of change?</p>
<p>Let us make CHOGM 2011 memorable for answering this question.</p>
<p>Memorable for being the Meeting that gave the Commonwealth the direction it needed at a time of global uncertainty and risk.</p>
<p>In so doing, we will be faithful to our values, and faithful to the people who have sent us here.</p>
<p>May we prove worthy custodians of the trust they have placed in us.</p>
<p>And ensure our Commonwealth values speak as clearly to future generations as they have to the past.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Australian people, I am deeply honoured to be your Host.</p>
<p>And I wish this for our meeting  -  that we each give our best to achieve the best for all of our nations.</p>
