dUTll ; LUkI; ñ ON AT 1EDT-L ILLILY,<br />
TOWPSVILLL, QUEE. NSLAlJ 29TH JULY__ 1966<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister. Mr Harold Holt.<br />
M'r iayor, . Mr Premier, Ministerial and Parliamentary<br />
Colleagues, Chief of the General Staff, Miss De Lacy and Gentlemen,<br />
This is a very happy thought on the part of the<br />
1' ayor, a very generous and hospitable thougft, to have so<br />
representative a gathering of the To. insville strength, plus the<br />
r. any visitors who have coie here for these two functions, at this<br />
pleasant luncheon gathering here today, and I do appreciate your<br />
kindness, Ir Mayor, in arranging this.<br />
It is a notable occasion, as you rightly stress.<br />
For me, a very happy one, because we do sincerely believe in this<br />
cause of northern development, and to see manifestations in these<br />
two practical achievements of a strengthoning on the academic<br />
side with the first university in the northern part of Australia<br />
in a tropical area of Australia, and the launching of a great new<br />
military establishment, itself the outstanding establishment of<br />
its kind in a tropical area, this is a double which many municipalities,<br />
11r Mayor, or the rural areas would certainly welcome if that<br />
good fortune came their way.<br />
I am sorry to learn that it has brought with it<br />
some of the problems of groi. ing pains to which you have rmde<br />
reference. At the thrce layers of government Federal, State and<br />
Municipal government we are all in severe financial straits.<br />
Now this doesn't add up very happily for the taxpayer, but I may<br />
comfort the taxpayer by saying that we have reached a point with<br />
some of our taxes that as we increase the tax we get less money<br />
back by way of revenue, so vie don't get much encouragement to<br />
tax you more heavily when that is the way you respond to our<br />
treatment. But I can assure you, Mr Miyor, that the Premier has<br />
already told me today of the difficulties of his own State and of<br />
one of its most important industries. I have had from the Premier<br />
of Victoria and the Promier of Now, South ales signals of distress.<br />
My colleaguos know of the vonics we went through a week or so back<br />
as we prepared our own Budget details, so I think we will have to<br />
go on praying for rain and the increased revenues that come from<br />
good seasons. Droughts still mean much to us in the loss of<br />
revenue, in the loss of carriage of goods by railways and the<br />
other con: Lercial activities associated with them which affect the<br />
budgets of governments. Althou h we weathered the effects of this<br />
last, or current, drought remarkably ' well, I think in an earlier<br />
period of Australian history it would have meant economic disaster.<br />
It has nevertheless taken its toll on the economy, and we have<br />
felt some discomfiture from it.<br />
But don't let us dwell on that rather gloomier aspect<br />
of our affairs on a day when we are able to point to developments<br />
of a constructive and positive kind in the life of this comraunity.<br />
Townsville is a very remarkable city. I think there can be few<br />
in the Commonwealth and, indeed, few in the world which can claim<br />
greater diversity of a. ctivity and of interest. You have got your<br />
rural wealth and activity, the cattle, the sugar, the mineral wealth<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
that proceeds from your lead, zinc, copper and matters of that<br />
sort. You have a tourist potential second to none I don't<br />
know any resort around the world that can so consistently live<br />
up to labels as Tonsville can. I have visited several of them,<br />
and for consistency of sunny vieather and pleasant climate and<br />
this accessibility to reef islands and the fishing ñ n the area<br />
these things help to mark this city out above almost any other<br />
that could be mentioned. I regret to have to report one serious piece of<br />
disillusionment. Arising out of this luncheon here today, I<br />
was relishing, as no doubt several of you were, these deli. ghtful<br />
fish sticks that we have been eating for lunch and I was asking<br />
which particular reef fish this was, only to be told that those<br />
wore imported fish sticksl Now, I think you've got to do<br />
something about that Mr Mayor. We claim that we have fish<br />
beyond number in the waters of the reef and it seems a<br />
contradiction in terrs that that beautiful fish we relish so<br />
much and that I pursue so actively has to be replaced by imported<br />
articles eating into the trade balances of this country.<br />
Well, Mr hyor, you have a bright prospect ahead<br />
for this city. It is in a sense the capital of the north of<br />
Australia. It will go on from strength to strength. It will<br />
have a much more richly diversified com~ unity activity because<br />
the academic society of the university makes its own contribution<br />
to a more richly fulfilled life, and at the same time, the lively,<br />
young; er, vigorous members of the Services the Air Force and the<br />
Army stationed here they, with that little bit of military pomp<br />
and circumstance, will add something to the diversification and<br />
enjoyent of life in a community such as this.<br />
I hope to be able to come back year by year<br />
because I am sure that year by year, Townsville will become an<br />
increasingly attractive place to visit, and an increasingly<br />
enjoyable place in which to live and attend to one's affairs.<br />
You have a prosperous future ahead of you, and quite obviously<br />
you have in the imaking of a great northern city a cause for which<br />
you and your fellow councillors can labour with enthusiasm in<br />
the years ahead. Our best wishes to you. You will be receiving such<br />
co-operation as Comronwealth and State Governments can give to you.<br />
There will be various points, particularly in relation to the<br />
university and the Service establishments at which you will be in<br />
direct contact ' with the Como. onwealth Governmont. I hope we treat<br />
you kindly. If you feel we do not, then I give you direct access<br />
to the person of the Prime iinister.<br />
So, Gentlemen, this happy occasion has been made<br />
possible by the Lhyor and his colleagues. We thank them and hope<br />
that under their leadership, this will be a city of which all<br />
Australia can be truly proud. </p>
