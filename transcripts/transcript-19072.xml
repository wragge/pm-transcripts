<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of Anzac Warren Snowdon today announced grants to encourage communities across Australia to become involved in the Centenary.</p>
<p>The Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program, providing $100,000 per electorate, will enable and empower communities across Australia to commemorate the Centenary of Anzac in their own way.</p>
<p>Communities are encouraged to start identifying local initiatives that recognise Australian service during the First World War.</p>
<p>The Centenary of Anzac 2014-2018 stands to be one of the most important commemorative periods in Australia's history. Around 330,000 Australians served overseas during the First World War including more than 50,000 at Gallipoli. There are a large number of Australian families with links to our first Anzacs and diggers and the impact of the war was felt by every community across the country.</p>
<p>A committee will be created in each electorate to work alongside local Federal MPs on grant proposals.</p>
<p>The grants will provide communities throughout the country with an opportunity to pay tribute to those involved in the First World War and to reflect on the lives of those who served and sacrificed in Australia's name.</p>
<p>Projects which could be considered for grant funding include:</p>
<p>·         Public commemorative events</p>
<p>·         New First World War memorials or honour boards</p>
<p>·         The restoration of existing First World War memorials or honour boards</p>
<p>·         The preservation, interpretation and display of First World War wartime and military memorabilia and artefacts</p>
<p>·         School projects related to the First World War</p>
<p>Grant funding will be available in 2013-14.</p>
<p>Information on the grants including the Program's guidelines will be available on the Anzac Centenary website shortly: <a href="http://www.anzaccentenary.gov.au">www.anzaccentenary.gov.au</a></p>
