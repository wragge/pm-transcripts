PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, ORANGE CIVIC THEATRE, ORANGE, 20 SEPTEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Mr Keating, there was some expectation that there may be an<br />
announcement pending or today on the freight terminal proposal..<br />
freight terminal in Parkes. You alluded that sort of need, is it likely it<br />
would be there?<br />
PM: What I did say today is that I have now asked my two colleagues<br />
Laurie Brereton and Bob Collins, that is the Minister for Transport and<br />
the Minister for Primary Industries to come back to me with a report<br />
about the needs of air freight capacity and specialised air freight<br />
facilities for this country. I think it is true that much of the air freight<br />
has been prioritised around the passenger needs and obviously the<br />
big terminals at Sydney and Melbourne are in the main, configured as<br />
passenger facilities. We need to do better with freight. Whether it is<br />
done in Sydney or Melbourne or Parkes or wherever, at least we will<br />
get an idea, I should hope, of what we need and then think about what<br />
sort of strategies we need to employ to bring them..<br />
J: It seems that there is very strong support for an airport here in this<br />
region, something they wouldn't enjoy in western Sydney..<br />
PM: No, but by the same token, I think, these things can't be sub economic,<br />
they have to be economic. So, we need to see by some analysis<br />
whether such an investment would actually be a productive thing for<br />
the country. If the country spends its scarce capital into sub economic<br />
resources then we move backwards. We have always got to keep<br />
moving forward, so we can only do that with investments which are, of<br />
their essence, productive and that requires us to do at least the<br />
feasibilities and look at the requirements of the air freight industry as a<br />
whole. I think we can do that. </p>
<p>J: Mr Keating, you spoke very strongly about environment issues today,<br />
the relationship with the land, what is your response to the green<br />
movement threats to withdraw..<br />
PM: I thought you would notice that the Conservation Foundation came out<br />
contradicting that story in the Sydney Morning Herald on Monday, by a<br />
part of the NSW conservation movement. We are going to do, I think,<br />
as good a job as can be done on putting into place a sustainable basis<br />
of forestry in this country. It is a difficult thing in a federation like this<br />
to sign the States up and to get them all committed at once to a<br />
strategy which defines adequate reserve systems, looks at sustainable<br />
practices et cetera. But, we are now in that process and I have got<br />
now doubt while we are in the process we will get a bit of jockeying<br />
along by various interest groups and prodding along, but we will be<br />
doing our very best for the environment and for having a decent forest<br />
products industry.<br />
J: Which States take the most persuading ( inaudible)..<br />
PM: That is a question for other than a news conference. I'd need to go<br />
back and look and see where we think people are, but again, I am<br />
hopeful that we can conclude some good thing nationally.<br />
J: Mr Keating, the polls today show the environment is one out of 8 out of<br />
13 policy areas people think that the Opposition could do a better job<br />
in and they don't have policies. How hard is that going to make it for<br />
you to as you told your backbench to get out there and sell yourself?<br />
PM: I think the Opposition are into basically environment chainsaw policies<br />
by and large. I think, they are the chainsaw specialists in the<br />
Australian environmental debate and I don't really think that most<br />
people that have the environment at heart think the Coalition would<br />
serve their interests. If you look at the things we have done in<br />
Australia, they have been over a decade quite profound for the<br />
environment, under this Labor Government and we are still doing it in<br />
all those areas which are most difficult to do, like forestry, very difficult.<br />
Landcare, the thing I have just-been speaking about, salinity, soil<br />
degradation. No government but this Labor Government has tackled<br />
those things the Murray-Darling, in a serious way, water these are<br />
the big environmental issues and we are the only ones, I think, either<br />
competently taking them on or successfully taking them on.<br />
J: What does it say to you though that a lot of people obviously believe<br />
the Opposition will do a better job?<br />
PM: The public are quite smart about needling governments along, they are<br />
always making you sit you know, putting the burr under your saddle. A. </p>
<p>J: But how can you do that the polls such as that would rate the<br />
Opposition ahead on virtually all of the major issues?<br />
PM: These are the sorts of questions I used to get asked in 1992. I used to<br />
give the same sorts of answers.<br />
J: Is Carmen Lawrence a factor ( inaudible)..<br />
PM: I'm not here to play press gallery games.<br />
J: Mr Keating, I've got a few staff and I've got to organise Christmas<br />
holidays, can I do it safely knowing the election will be after<br />
Christmas?<br />
PM: I've always said the public expect us to squeeze as much value out of<br />
these parliaments as we can and I'm certainly lining my holiday up.<br />
So, why should I muck yours about.<br />
J: 94 per cent of our food companies are off shore, are you concerned<br />
about that, should we be concerned about that and what can we do?<br />
PM: Well I don't know whether it is as high as that figure. But there is a<br />
substantial number that are owned offshore. But the main thing is that<br />
they develop in a way which works for Australia. That is, that their<br />
product and the growth of their product works in our domestic economy<br />
and in our external accounts and to our greater wealth. I think they<br />
are. But that is not to say that we shouldn't have a good sustainable<br />
agri-business in this country which is Austral ian-owned. Some<br />
substantial chunks of it are Australian-owned and I would like to see<br />
those grow.<br />
J: Where?<br />
PM: Where are they going to come from? I think they are going to come<br />
from the sort of businesses which we have seen in this region,<br />
Manildra, the Dubbo Abattoir these sorts of businesses. I mean<br />
entrepreneurship always proves, I think, where you see good<br />
entrepreneurs that they can grow a sensible business. But also having<br />
those linkages into the multi-national corporations is a good thing for<br />
Australia. It does give us market access around the region that we<br />
mightn't otherwise have.<br />
J: Mr Keating, the Opposition Leader is unveiling a foreign debt billboard<br />
at the front entrance of Parliament House this afternoon. He obviously<br />
believes that is a big vote winner, yet you are playing that down..<br />
PM: He is also telling the MTIA what the Coalition will do for business and<br />
I can tell the business community what the Coalition will do for<br />
business. The first thing they will do is scrap the Accord. The next </p>
<p>thing that will happen is you will get sporadic wage breakouts, any<br />
central bank will then stick up interest rates to try and hold inflation,<br />
growth will then dip, the profit share will get knocked about and the<br />
whole cooperation at the workplace will go and, of course, the thing<br />
that will go with it is job growth. So I mean that is what the Coalition is<br />
going to do for business and that is the other thing they are doing<br />
today.<br />
J: Prime Minister, you have spoken in your speech about the current<br />
account deficit. How more confident are you about reducing that<br />
deficit, given ABARE's forecast yesterday...<br />
PM: Well they were both good numbers as you intimate. ABARE's export<br />
projections were encouraging and I think that 8 per cent drop in<br />
imports yesterday tends to confirm the view that the Statistician put at<br />
the last balance of payments release. That is, that it has peaked and it<br />
is probably on the way down. If that is the case, of course, we get<br />
back to some more sustainable rates on the current account deficit.<br />
But it is a point I was making earlier to the conference. In a continent<br />
this large, we are always going to need capital requirements greater<br />
than our savings railways, ports, wharves, mines, farms, factories.<br />
We will never in a country this big, ever, afford them just from our<br />
domestic savings and that is no bad thing. It is like a person buying<br />
their home. They can't afford it from their own domestic savings. They<br />
use someone else's, but they grow an asset. We are using someone<br />
else's and we are growing an asset too.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you were speaking in regard to the drought and what the<br />
Government has done for it still worried about anomalies for<br />
exceptional circumstances. Is there going to be a review?<br />
PM: Well I don't know that there are anomalies with it. There are, maybe,<br />
Ferceived or argued anomalies. We have this body called RASAC,<br />
which advises us on which particular districts ought to be appropriately<br />
declared as exceptional circumstance areas. And where we think<br />
there have been, let's say, difficult circumstances but not exceptional<br />
under the criteria we have sough~ t to do some special things for those<br />
districts. Some of them, of course, in New South Wales. But we are<br />
about to receive a RASAC report and you know if the tom-toms mean<br />
anything, some of the shires around this district may qualify.<br />
J: Mr Keating, this district covers a broad cross section of the society I<br />
believe you have polling showing that if the Government stops<br />
hereafter is that a reflection on your<br />
PM: I don't know. I mean David Simmons has kept on coming back and<br />
Rob's going to take his place, we think. So I think we are confident<br />
about it. But, again, competence is one thing, work and effort is<br />
another and I think care, commitment, work effort, diligence to a locaL </p>
<p>community is what makes the result in the end and we have been<br />
doing that.<br />
J: Mr Keating, as a folliclely-challenged member of the Press Gallery, is<br />
there any truth to the claim that you are banning photographs from<br />
behind?<br />
PM: Well I saw that story in the Sydney Morning Herald today and let me<br />
assure you the story is completely inaccurate and completely wrong.<br />
I have had no conversation with the Speaker about this, none<br />
whatsoever, nor has a member of my staff. The Speaker did this on<br />
his own initiative with the Sergeant-At-Arms. Mr Seccombe from the<br />
Herald was told that. But Mr Seccombe has no respect for accuracy or<br />
truth and he gets that, of course, from the leadership of the Sydney<br />
Morning Herald, which has a very low premium on accuracy or truth in<br />
reporting.<br />
ends </p>
