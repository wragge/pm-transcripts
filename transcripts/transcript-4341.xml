FOR PRESS 9 MARCH 1977<br />
ADDRESS AT THE OPENING OF THE " GENESIS" EXIIIBITION AT THE A. N. U.<br />
It is with much pleasure that I welcome you to this very fine<br />
exhibition Genesis of a Gallery. The exhibition began its<br />
Australian wide tour in Adelaide twelve months ago and has<br />
visited Darwin, and all State capitals, other than Melbourne,<br />
where it may be shown later.<br />
It has been seen and enjoyed by many thousands of people and wari~ y<br />
received by artists and art critics. It illustrates the<br />
range and diversity of the national collection which will find<br />
its home in the National Gallery.<br />
Creating a National Gallery of Art which will take its place<br />
amongst the great galleries of the world is an exciting : nd<br />
challenging task. The decision of this Government to pursue with<br />
enthusiasm this long-standing objective is a reflection of the<br />
confidence of Australians in their artistic achicvements.<br />
The exhibition before you is an important step towards fulfil; n ct<br />
of the nation's desire to collect, preserve and exhibit the best<br />
of our heritage and to expose it to study by the critical minds<br />
of the present and future generations.<br />
For success, the Gallery must of course have these objectives.<br />
In the case of our own gallery, as you will see tonight,<br />
we are aiming higher. The Gallery is building up a collection<br />
which recognises the continuity of the European cultural tran: liio.<br />
and in particular, its important influence on Australian art.<br />
In addition, the collection includes cxamTples of othrc tr. iLL.~ i.:<br />
as you will see in those items representing African, Meianesian.<br />
Columbian-American, and Asian art.<br />
The collection is an expression of our belief as a nation in<br />
ourselves, and our creative spirit. It shown that . we are prep<br />
tc shape our taste and have our curiosity aroused by s. ttinP. ihe<br />
achievements of our artists alongside those of other nations<br />
and peoples, old and new.<br />
M.. ny o, yoP . il nerhans have had the 2xnc'ri ence in so. e n: ar<br />
of the world, of visiting galleries which have becom::-mummMified<br />
museums of . hich have existed largely, even primarily, s<br />
temples of study for a select minority. Our Gallery is to have<br />
a more lively future and it is being developed :. Lth a i: uch<br />
broader vision. </p>
<p>We I k forward to the. day when our national collection will<br />
have i. s own home, and we have every confidence that will be<br />
a dii lnguished o\ ne. It will, as you know, be Canberra's<br />
privilege to have this institution, just across the lake from<br />
this national university, appropriately set alongside three<br />
other noble institutions Parliament House, the National Library<br />
and the High Court. But just as these other institutions<br />
must, in order to retain their relevance to society understand<br />
the needs of, and serve the whole Australian community, so<br />
must the Gallery.<br />
Art, like justice, should not only be done, but should be seen<br />
to be done. It must be available to the people. Art cut off<br />
from the larger society is isolated in an ivory tower, but when it<br />
is made available to the people, it gives Australians something<br />
to measure themselves against.<br />
I am pleased to say that although Genesis is in the final stages<br />
of its Australian tour, it is hoped that shortly Genesis Two<br />
will be mounted. It is also hoped that exhibitions will<br />
continue to be sent on tour each year.<br />
I understand that special exhibitions will be made available to<br />
regional and municipal galleries in order to demonstrate<br />
a particular aspect of art such as etching or print making<br />
and that it is proposed to lend works to State galleries and<br />
institutions. As well, the Gallery Council has been<br />
continuing the " art current" programme under which new works<br />
from outside Australia are acquired for circulation to centres<br />
in which there are art schools or university fine art departments.<br />
The purpose of this programme is to give students and others an<br />
opportunity to keep abreast of new ideas and methods being<br />
developed overseas.<br />
There are also plans to establish a school lending programme<br />
under which small changing exhibitions or artefacts, arts, and<br />
crafts will be circulated to schools. If art is to flourish,<br />
it must attract the young to enjoy it.<br />
In short, the national collection, of which you are sc. ing part<br />
tonight, is to be an integrated and living part of our national<br />
cultural and educational life. It should provide us with endless<br />
enjoyment and enable us to take a significant step forward in the<br />
appreciation of our art and that of the world around us.<br />
Of course, to establish a national art collection, especially in<br />
today's art market, requires a generous long term supply of funds.<br />
The Government will, of necessity, be the primary patron and the<br />
value of the public contribution is patent. But at the same time,<br />
I believe there to be an important role for private patronage of<br />
the arts. Private patronage has the virtue of fiexibility of<br />
taste. It can support the experimental and avant-garde.<br />
Competing with the public purse, it provides a safety valve against<br />
the possibility of a dictation of taste, against the makini, of<br />
political and personal rather than artistic judgements. I.<br />
. I </p>
<p>I<br />

My hope would be that the education and experience provided by the<br />
national collection would increase rather than diminish private<br />
support for the arts. For seven years now, our collection<br />
has been built up mainly by Mr James Mollison. Just two weeks<br />
ago, I was pleased to announce his appointment for a term of<br />
seven years as the first Director of the Australian National<br />
Gallery. I would like to congratulate him tonight and say again<br />
that I am confident that he will continue to bring imagination<br />
and flair to the important task before him.<br />
I am very pleased to declare the Genesis exhibition in<br />
Canberra, open. 000oo00000 </p>
