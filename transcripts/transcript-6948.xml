PROME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
EXTRACT OF SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AT THE SA STATE ALP CONFERENCE<br />
ADELAIDE SUNDAY 8 JUNE 1986<br />
Delegates,<br />
We are at a watershed year in the history of our Government, our Party<br />
and our nation.<br />
our conduct in the challenging weeks and months to come, our conduct as a<br />
Government, as a Party but, above all, as a people, the whole<br />
Australian community will be crucial in shaping Australia's future fo. r<br />
the rest of the century and beyond.<br />
The nature of the task ahead may be different from our task in the past<br />
three years.<br />
But two fundamental things remain absolutely unchanged and unchangeable.<br />
The first is our supreme objective : the basic objective of our<br />
Government and out: Party to build a better, fairer and more rewarding<br />
future for all Australians and to build a stronger, more secure<br />
Au st ral1i a.<br />
And the second thing that remains unalterable is our basic approach the<br />
achievement of national reconstruction through national cooperation.<br />
The hallmark of our Government since its election less than three and a<br />
half years ago has been continuity of policy, consistency of approach and<br />
the courage to take tough decisions vital to the nation's interests and<br />
the welfare of the people.<br />
And those qualities which stand in such marked contrast with the actio. is<br />
of our predecessors throughout their seven disastrous years.<br />
So often, our opponents knew the right thing to do. They knew the<br />
urgent, necessary thing to do. They never had the courage to do it.<br />
They would never front up and take the tough decisions.<br />
That is why they're in Opposition, that is why they will stay in<br />
Opposition, and that is why they lack any credibility and why they are<br />
without credentials in the eyes of the Australian people, who know that<br />
leadership in times of national difficulty comes only from Labor.<br />
The Coalition's lack of courage in Government is matched only by their<br />
lack of principle in opposition.<br />
And I don't believe any aspirant for the highest office in memory has<br />
demonstrated that lack of courage in office and lack of principle in<br />
opposition as the present incumbent Honest John Howard. </p>
<p>As Treasurer, Howard did the work of looking at tp e tiuest ion<br />
of bringing in foreign banks. He knew it was the rigb<br />
thing to do to give the Australian people a more<br />
copetitive banking system. They didn't have the courage to<br />
do it. The same with the de-regulation of the financial<br />
system. The same with the floating of the dollar.<br />
And he certainly knew what was happening to Australia's tax<br />
system. It was under Howard that tax avoidance and evasion became a<br />
national scandal and a permanent disgrace to the coalition<br />
which let it happen. When they had thrown the national<br />
economy into its worst crisis for fifty years, the tax<br />
avoidance industry was the fastest-growing industry in<br />
Australia, as Commissioner Costigan said in his first report<br />
in 1982.<br />
Indeed, by then, with economic growth at zero, it was the<br />
only growth industry in Australia.<br />
Howard knew what had to be done. He moved to do it and<br />
then buckled under.<br />
He knew that reform of the tax system was urgent. He knew<br />
what was happening. He knew that the average wage earners<br />
were being pushed into the higher marginal tax brackets but<br />
as PAYE taxpayers, they were bearing the burden of tax<br />
avoidance devices available only to the wealthy.<br />
Yet he has opposed and obstructed our tax reforms and, in<br />
particular, the measures which are essential to our<br />
undertaking for significant tax cuts this year.<br />
He now says he would remove the legislation to tax fringe<br />
benefits which of course is just another way of saying that<br />
he is opposed to the tax cuts.<br />
Because, delegates, the tax on fringe benefits cannot be<br />
taken in isolation. It is part of our total package of tax<br />
reform.<br />
But delegates, what did Mr Howard have to say about fringe<br />
benefits in 1985? He invoked his friend, Mr Valder, the<br />
National President of the Liberal Party. Mr Valder had<br />
said: ' of course they are right. of course Mr Keating is<br />
right to be bringing them in. They have the courage to do<br />
it; it is the right thing to do. We want them to do it and<br />
if, perchance, the Australian people should not see the<br />
merits of this, we will reap the benefit!' He was all in<br />
favour of it.<br />
And this is what Honest John Howard had to say: ' What Mr<br />
Valder said on fringe benefits was not all that different<br />
from what a number of us have said. If you are able to cut<br />
the top marginal rate of personal income tax, then it is<br />
fair in that context, and that context alone, to do<br />
something about fringe benefits.' </p>
<p>So that's the Howard record on taxation. But-of course,<br />
delegates, his record as Treasurer will never be forgotten<br />
by the Australian people.<br />
They will never forget that the Howard years culminated in<br />
Australia's worst economic crisis for fifty years.<br />
These were the worst of seven bad years.<br />
Delegates, Just look at the record: the Fraser years, the Hawke years;<br />
the Howard yea--s, the Keating years.<br />
ECONOMIC GROWTH<br />
Fraser years : annualised growth 2.6%<br />
Our years to March 1985 annualised growth 4.2%<br />
EMPLOYMENT In the seven Fraser years, 340,000 jobs.<br />
Hawke to April 1986, annualised growth 3.5% per annum.<br />
669,400 jobs<br />
Under us, in less than half that time, double the jobs.<br />
INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES<br />
In their years, the average ' annual number days lost was 3.02<br />
million. We have more than halved that, to 1.4 million.<br />
Delegates, That's the record: That's the contrast.<br />
The Liberal record; The Labor record. Treasurer Howard;<br />
Treasurer Keating.<br />
What a choice! What an alternative! Yet they now put<br />
forward as their alternative the very policies, the same<br />
approach which produced the disasters of pre-1983.<br />
The economic and social vandalism they espouse would strike<br />
at the foundations of all that has been achieved over the<br />
past three years.<br />
First and last they are the enemies of the Accord the<br />
Prices and Incomes Accord which, not only through its<br />
machinery and practical application, but, perhaps even more,<br />
through the spirit of co-operation it represents, has been<br />
the basis of recovery.<br />
They propose no alternative except a return to the old days I </p>
<p>and to the old ways.<br />
Yet what were the consequences of their approach? Failure<br />
down the line, even on their own avowed objective of<br />
containing wages.<br />
The wage explosion they produced 1981 led to the worst<br />
unemployment for 50 years. Average weekly earnings grew at<br />
an average of 11.4 per cent in each of their seven years,<br />
compared with an average of 6 per cent under the Accord.<br />
Award wages rose 9.2 per cent, year on year, compard with<br />
5.4 per cent under the Accord.<br />
And of course those comparisons demonstrate something more<br />
than the success of the Accord and of our approach, and 0<br />
something more than the plain stupidity of the Liberal<br />
alternative. They show in a striking way, the degree of restraint which<br />
has been exercised by the union movement and by the parties,<br />
to the Accord, now for three years and more.<br />
It shows how the Labor movement will respond to responsible<br />
leadership. It shows how the workers of this country are prepared to<br />
sacrifice the shadow of short-term gains to achieve the<br />
substance to forego the illusion of wage increases which<br />
are destined only to be wiped out almost immediately by new<br />
inflation. It shows that Australians in employment are prepared to<br />
exercise restraint to help put their fellow Australians back<br />
into employment and to give their kids a chance for jobs.<br />
And it is on that basis of restraint and responsibility that<br />
we have been able to create 670,000 new jobs in 3 years.<br />
And the two essential elements in that achievement have been<br />
leadership and understanding leadership for the whole<br />
community, understanding by the whole community.<br />
It has been achieved through the leadership provided by the<br />
Labor Governments of Australia and the great leadership and<br />
responsibility of the Australian Labor movement.<br />
It has been achieved because the Australian community as a<br />
whole has understood the problems and understood what is at<br />
stake in solving them.<br />
And now, those qualities leadership and understanding<br />
are needed more than ever.<br />
They have been the foundation for the successors of the past<br />
three years. They will be the condition of our success in<br />
the years ahead.<br />
We have shown what can be achieved by this approach we </p>
<p>have shown what. can be achieved together.<br />
Together, we won our way out of the worst economic crisis<br />
for 50 years.<br />
Together we created the strongest growing economy in the<br />
industrial west.<br />
Together we created 670,000 new jobs.<br />
Now on the foundations we have laid together, from the<br />
position of strength we have established, we shall take<br />
Australia and the Australian economy through its present<br />
difficulties.<br />
As a result of the massive decline in the terms of trade, we<br />
have had inflicted on us a reduction in Australia's economic<br />
capcity to sustain standards. No single section of the<br />
community, no one section of the economy, can be asked to<br />
carry the burden alone.<br />
The restraint we now call for is restraint all round. It<br />
must be restraint and responsibility by all sections, by all<br />
governments, by business as well as unions.<br />
And let me emphasise, delegates, that these current<br />
difficulties must be placed in the perspective of the<br />
success and achievements of the past three years.<br />
That is the basis for the confidence we can all have in our<br />
capacity to surmount the problems.<br />
And the most important element in that confidence is the<br />
maturity the Australian community has so amply demonstrated<br />
in those years the capacity to understand the problems,<br />
the capacity to make a common commitment to their solution,<br />
the capacity to respond to leadership, the capacity for<br />
restraint and responsibility.<br />
And let me emphasise, at this Labor Conference, another<br />
important point indeed, the fundamental point for us as a<br />
Labor Government, as a Labor Party, and as a Labor movement.<br />
In setting out to achieve, as we have, sustained ' economic<br />
growth, we have never lost sight of our goals and<br />
objectives.<br />
We have never seen growth as an end in itself, but, always,<br />
as the necessary means through which we can achieve our<br />
great social aims in building a better, fairer society.<br />
For us, the creation of jobs has not only been a central<br />
objective of our economic policies, it is central to our<br />
social objectives our objectives of greater equity, not<br />
only f-or those able to take part in the productive processes<br />
directly, but for those of our fellow Australians who depend<br />
upon a compassionate society if they are to share equitably<br />
in the fruits of growth. </p>
<p>And let there be no doubt about the depth and strength of<br />
our continuing commitment to our wider social objectives.<br />
We shall not be diverted from them.<br />
On the contrary, it is precisely to protect the great social<br />
advances of the past three years and to build for further<br />
advance that we are determined to lend all our efforts in<br />
the weeks and months ahead towards the protection of the<br />
Australian economy.<br />
Delegates, want to turn briefly to other mattirs because it would<br />
be altogether to mistake the nature of our Govenment to<br />
suppose its total pre-occupation was with economic matters,<br />
crucially important as they are.<br />
The Labor Government has restored a proper sense of<br />
independence, self-respect and concerned, constructive<br />
endeavour to the conduct of Australia's foreign policy.<br />
In the time available to me, I will discuss two matters<br />
which illustrate our achievement and our approach.<br />
It is appropriate that, at the end of a week in which the<br />
Foreign Minister, Bill Hayden, introduced into Parliament<br />
legislation designed to give effect to Australia's<br />
obligations as a party to the South Pacific Nuclear Free<br />
Free Zone Treaty, I should refer to the Labor Government's<br />
policies on nuclear issues..<br />
That Treaty itself is one of our major initiatives and<br />
achievements. Under it, Australian associates itself with<br />
the common aspirations of South Pacific countries to prevent<br />
the testing, acquisition, production and stationing of<br />
nuclear weapons and the dumping of nuclear waste in our<br />
region. our aim now is to achieve the support of the five<br />
nuclear weapons states for this significant arms control<br />
measure which will strengthen security in the South Pacific.<br />
The long-term objective of Labor policies is a world without<br />
nuclear weapons. At present, however, in a world where such<br />
weapons exist, the main concern must be the avoidance of<br />
nuclear war. We are firmly of the view that a stable<br />
deterrent relationship between the United States and the<br />
Soviet Union is the best means currently available of<br />
ensuring nuclear restraint and of providing the necessary<br />
confidence to engage in negotiations to reduce, and<br />
eventually eliminate, the nuclear arsenals. The Government<br />
believes that Australia has an important contribution to<br />
make to the achievement of these objectives. That<br />
contribution is evident in our support for effective stable<br />
deterrence through our hosting of the joint facilities, our<br />
port access policy and other arrangements and in our active<br />
arms control and disarmament policy. </p>
<p>our commitment to encouraging effective arms control derives<br />
from the catastrophic potential of war in the nuclear age<br />
and our firm belief that the nuclear weapon states do not<br />
have the exclusive right to determine issues relevant to<br />
arms control and international security. Every nation has<br />
the right and responsibility to be heard on these issues and<br />
the Australian Government is determined to continue to<br />
exercise the right to the full.<br />
The Government has maintained a close and constructive<br />
dialogue with the United States on arms cortrol issues. I<br />
recently wrote to President Reagan to express Australia's<br />
concern at the announcement by the U. S. Administration of<br />
its intention to breach the arms limitations set out in the<br />
SALT II Treaty.<br />
We attach great importance to compliance with the terms of<br />
the SALT II Treaty by both the United States and the Soviet<br />
Union. Its numerical limits provide an important measure of<br />
predictability as to the strategic nuclear balance. Despite<br />
its imperfections, the existing arms control regime is the<br />
only available basis from which to proceed, if agreements<br />
for significant reductions in the arsenals of the<br />
super-powers are to be negotiated.<br />
Moreover, whatever the basis in fact, the Government sees a<br />
risk of a perception developing in Australia, as a result of<br />
the U. S. decision, that it is Washington rather than Moscow<br />
which is taking the initiative to break out of existing<br />
agreed constraints.<br />
We understand United States concerns about Soviet<br />
compliance. indeed I had earlier written to General<br />
Secretary Gorbachev, informing him of Australia's view that<br />
the Soviet union has a case to answer on specific issues of<br />
compliance and urging the USSR in the strongest terms to<br />
demonstrate full compliance with existing agreements and, if<br />
necessary, to go out of its way to do so.<br />
But for the reasons I have outlined above, we would be very<br />
concerned if the United States goes ahead to allow its<br />
forces to exceed the SALT II limits and future decisions<br />
regarding United States strategic forces were made without<br />
reference to the SALT constraints.<br />
Our nuclear policies also attach the highest importance to<br />
the major nuclear arms control treaty in existence, the<br />
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and its system of<br />
verification, including International Atomic Energy Agency<br />
safeguards. In a letter to Mr Gorbachev of 13 May, I drew attention to<br />
Australian proposals for international action on nuclear<br />
safety in the wake of the Chernobyl tragedy. These<br />
proposals were essentially for an interim early warning<br />
mechanism, an international convention on information<br />
exchange and mutual assistance in the event of nuclear<br />
incidents, and international efforts to improve nuclear<br />
safety standards. </p>
<p>On 4 June, I received a message from the General Secretary<br />
which endorsed in broad terms the Australian proposals<br />
which, in the meantime, had also been the subject of<br />
discussion by the IAEA Board of Governors.<br />
A special meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors on 21 May,<br />
convened to discuss international nuclear safety, adopted a<br />
decision compatible with the main elements of the approach<br />
Australia is promoting.<br />
It is encouraging that the Soviet Union is now playing a<br />
constructive role on this issue.<br />
I contrast our record of achievement on these issues wit4<br />
that of our opponents who, among other things, have<br />
denounced the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone, uncritically<br />
endorsed and promised Australian pacticipation in the<br />
Strategic Defence Initiative and, when last in Government,<br />
broke off all sensible communication with the USSR.<br />
I would also like to refer to the Government's policies on<br />
South Africa, an issue of great importance to our Party and<br />
our country.<br />
The Australian Labor Party will not compromise with<br />
institutionalised racism. We will not take the role of<br />
passive spectators, while a monstrously immoral system is<br />
imposed by an armed and ruthless state apparatus on a<br />
largely defenceless black majority, which continues to be<br />
denied the most elementary human rights.<br />
Make no mistake, the violence which grows worse daily in<br />
South Africa is a direct consequence of the apartheid<br />
system. The only hope now for a peaceful solution to the proolems of<br />
South Africa is for the regime to indicate by actions, not<br />
cleverly calculated, deliberately ambiguous words, that it<br />
is genuinely prepared to dismantle the apartheid system and<br />
to negotiate honestly with the black opposition.<br />
To date, there is absolutely no sign of this. What we have<br />
had, at one level, is a series of so-called reforms which<br />
are clearly designed to delude world opinion that something<br />
significant is occurring while in practice doing nothing to<br />
change the essence of the inhuman apartheid system. At the<br />
other level, we have had the use of naked violence and<br />
police repression against blacks, and those few principled<br />
whites who dare protest against the system and, three weeks<br />
ago, the violation of the sovereignty and territorial<br />
integrity of South Africa'a neighbours by totally<br />
unjustified armed force.<br />
Pretoria has most recently made another outragous attack<br />
outside its borders, this time on Angola, is now planning<br />
stringent measures to prohibit or deal with any<br />
demonstration commemorating the tenth anniversary of the<br />
deaths in Soweto on June 16 and is making irrational, false<br />
attacks on the African National Congress. </p>
<p>The regime's refusal to permit freedom of expr ession and.<br />
assembly to blacks and liberal whites stands in stark<br />
contrast to its tolerance of the emergent Afrikaner Fascist<br />
movement. The Labor Government can take pride in the position it has<br />
taken on South Africa. We have toughened the measures taken<br />
by previous Australian Governments. we have indicated that<br />
we will support comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions<br />
if the world community decides to apply them. We were among<br />
the first to introduce economic measures of our own against<br />
South Africa.<br />
But we have not seen sanctions as an end in themselves.<br />
AS Bill Hayden has said, we have sought to bring the South<br />
Af rican Government to its senses not tbo its knees. At the<br />
Commonwealth meeting at Nassau, it was an Australian<br />
initiative to set up the Eminent Persons Group, whose task<br />
was to find a way to bring the South Africa regime and the<br />
opposition together, to negotiate the end of apartheid<br />
peacefully. In launching this initiative, we had no illusions about the<br />
difficulty of the task because we knew the nature of the<br />
Botha regime. We were also aware of the suspicions which<br />
black nationalists in South Africa would naturally feel<br />
about a process which was open to misunderstanding.<br />
In fact, the Group has performed its task with great<br />
integrity, energy and skill. it succeeded in winning the<br />
confidence of South Africa's black opposition and of the<br />
front-line States. it established its credibility<br />
internationally and created hope for peaceful change.<br />
I Lnerc'iore dh: Cpl\' regret that as a result of Sc-,-th : Mricin<br />
intransi~ je. ncc the efforts of' the Comnmomwealth Group to<br />
o ncou rayq u negotiations have failcd. In its own words<br />
in a message sent to myself and other Commonwealth leaders,<br />
the Group has made the reluctant but unequivocal judgement<br />
that further talks would not lead anywhere in the current<br />
circumstances. The EPG represented a determined effort by the Commonwealth<br />
to seek a basis for peaceful negotiation. The initiative<br />
also represented a conscious decision to test the South<br />
African Government's willingness to pursue genuine change<br />
and to offer it an option other than South Africa being<br />
relegated even more to international isolation and<br />
opprobrium. The EPG had discussions with the South African Government<br />
and with all other groups which must be involved in a<br />
solution. The negiotiating concept produced by the EPG was<br />
fair and reasonable. The South African Government responded<br />
not by indicating support for the concept, but by raising<br />
critical quoetions about central elements of it. </p>
<p>In these circumstances it is impossible to avoid the<br />
conclusion that South Africa's response was motivated not by<br />
a genuine commitment to negotiation but rather a desire to<br />
string the exercise out for purely tactical purposes.<br />
It gives us no joy whatsoever to reach the conclusion that<br />
South Africa is basically unwilling to change its internal<br />
or external behaviour. Australian interests, the interests<br />
of the international community and the interests of all<br />
South Africans would have been served by South Africa<br />
responding to the EPG initiative to accomplish a real change<br />
of course.<br />
It is still our hope that the South Africa regime will<br />
release unconditionally Nelson Mandela and all other<br />
political prisoners; legalise the African National Congress<br />
and give it and all other political * groups the right to<br />
normal political activity; remove the troops from the<br />
African townships, and negotiate the end of apartheid<br />
without pre-conditions.<br />
But the Labor Government must face the situation as it is.<br />
Accordingly, unless there is dramatic change in the two<br />
months remaining before Heads of Government of EPG countries<br />
meet in London in early August, I expect to be taking into<br />
that meeting the view that additional measures are<br />
necessary. Cabinet will in due course be considering<br />
concrete steps that Australia could take in this regard.<br />
To those who argue against sanctions that they will<br />
allegedly hurt the black community most, I say that I prefer<br />
to believe black South African patriots like Desmond Tutu<br />
when they say that the black community could not suffer more<br />
than it already does under the apartheid system.<br />
The Labor Government has been at the fore-front of the South<br />
African issue. We will continue to be at the fore-front.<br />
Our position on this once again stands in the starkest<br />
contrast to that of our opponents. our party has every<br />
reason to reject the divisive, unjust and failed policies of<br />
the 1975-83 era. But on the issues of South Africa and<br />
racism, Malcolm Fraser's credentials, in Government and<br />
since, are impeccable. It is a disgraceful indictment of<br />
his successors first Peacock and even more obviously<br />
Howard that they have overturned, almost gleefully, one of<br />
the few legacies of integrity of these seven years.<br />
CONCLUSION Delegates, my friends,<br />
Exactly a year ago, at this conference, I said I had come to<br />
bring a three-fold message.<br />
It was first a message of pride pride in what we had been<br />
able to achieve together. </p>
<p>It was a message with a challenge the continuing challenge<br />
of building a society and an economy of greater equity and<br />
efficiency. It was above all a message of confidence confidence in the<br />
capacity of our party, our movement, our Government and our<br />
people to meet the challenge.<br />
And my message today is exactly the same: the sense of<br />
pride, the acceptance of challenge, the deep confidence.<br />
We have shown over the past three yeas what we can do<br />
together.<br />
We have shown as an Australian community that we can beat<br />
the rest of the world. I believe that with a continuation<br />
of the responses and the approach, which made that<br />
achievement possible, this Party, this Government, and this<br />
great people of Australia will prove worthy of the<br />
challenge.<br />
Given that response, we can continue the reconstruction<br />
which is the basis for continued growth.<br />
We can continue to create more jobs for Australians.<br />
We can continue to give greater hope to our young.<br />
We can continue to give greater real benefits to those in<br />
our community who depend, through the social welfare system,<br />
on the sense of fairness and justice of the community as a<br />
whole. Delegates, I thank you for your contribution since the beginning of<br />
1983 to help your national Labor Government deliver the<br />
goods in a way that was never believed possible by the<br />
sceptics. And I know that in the weeks and the months and<br />
the years of challenge ahead of us, you will play your part,<br />
at the very. forefront of the nation, in the common effort we<br />
must all make together, as once again Labor takes up its<br />
historic task, as we have done in peace and war, to lead<br />
this great nation to an even greater future.<br />
I </p>
