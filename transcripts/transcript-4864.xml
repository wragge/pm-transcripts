PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 25 October 1978 A<br />
Interview with Paul Curtis, Australian Hi-Fi Photographics Magazine<br />
Question: more or less how did it start, how did you get involved with<br />
photography? Prime Minister:<br />
I think probably travelling and just taking pictures of different<br />
places that were interesting that I mightn't ever go to again.<br />
Then when you start to get a family you take pictures of the kids,<br />
and so it goes on.<br />
Question: Roughly, how many years have you been involved with it?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
About 20 years, or a little more. More than 20 years.<br />
Question: Do you shoot mainly black and white, or colour print or colour<br />
slides. Prime Minister:<br />
Well I'm a bit lazy about that now, and so it's mostly colour<br />
negatives. It used to be colour slides. Some movie photography,<br />
but having not so much time as I used to, you want something that<br />
you can put in a book that you can look at without having to get<br />
out complex projectors and screens, and that's really the reason<br />
for colour negatives.<br />
Question: Is there any subject you most enjoy taking?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well something interesting, something different. Wildlife, if<br />
you can get close enough to it.. For a while -I grow great<br />
camelias, we've got 70 or 80 camelias at home -I thought of<br />
collecting a series of different camelias and maybe one day<br />
publishing that. But as a politician I never have enough time<br />
to take it far enough. A very great part of it is plainly<br />
activity ( inaudible) whatever is interesting at the moment.<br />
It gives you a record, reminds you just as well as a diary<br />
and probably more effectively, axid I think in a more attractive<br />
way. Question: Do you find that you are taking all your pictures when you are<br />
overseas and when you are at home? / 2 </p>
<p>Prime Minister:<br />
well when you go to different places. When I went to Birdsville<br />
I had a camera with me, camping out in the desert. If I go to<br />
different places in Australia I take a camera. Often when you are<br />
going overseas its just business and meetings, one hotel to another,<br />
and hotels are very much the same, and so there isn't a great deal<br />
of opportunity for photographs. Going to China and going to Japan,<br />
when you had several days looking at the country after initial<br />
discussions was obviously quite a different matter, providing<br />
very interesting and fascinating opportunities for photography.<br />
Question: Tell me, when you are taking pictures overseas do you get any<br />
comments from other Heads of State about your photo interests?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I don't think so. President Scheel who was here wave goodbye from<br />
his plane and then he camne out again to take some photographs of<br />
the latest model Viscount. He arrived this morning at the airport<br />
with a camera in his hand. Quite often you go to a meeting and<br />
find other people who are interested in photography, or they will<br />
give their camera to one of their staff to blast away with.<br />
Question: Are there any other physical figures, political figures, who share<br />
your interest, apart from President Scheel?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well I haven't discussed it to any lengths with any of them.<br />
I just noticed that President Scheel was carrying a camera and<br />
using it.<br />
Question: It doesn't crop up in the course of conversation?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well it has. I have no doubt a number do. I think some members<br />
of the Royal Family use one of those tiny little Minoxes. Others<br />
use a small Rolex ( inaudible). But all sorts of people take<br />
photographs from time to time of a great variety of things.<br />
Question: What about your family. Do any Qther members of your family take<br />
pictures too?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
At different stages I think the kids have all had Instamatics.<br />
They have gone through phases of taking photographs. I don't<br />
know that any of them are develop ing into a fanatic and ardent / 3 </p>
<p>photographer at the moment. My wife Tamie in recent times has<br />
struggled to become a bit more interested in the use of a full<br />
lens Minox. She won't use a big camera because its too<br />
bulky, too heavy and too ostentatious probably. She uses one<br />
of those small ones about the size of a pack of cards. In the<br />
last few months she has been taking quite an interest and trying<br />
to do something more than just point a camera and snap paying<br />
attention to the composition of the photograph. Whether it's<br />
an interest that will last or not I don't know yet.<br />
Question: I get quite heavily involved via industry association ( inaudible).<br />
Do you feel that you are self-conscious when you are carrying<br />
a camera?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It depends what it is. In many cases I don't if you are looking<br />
at things. But if you are getting out of a car and you officially<br />
have to greet somebody or you are waiting for somebody officially<br />
on the steps of Parliament House or reviewing a guard of honour,<br />
in those circumstances it would look very odd if you went around<br />
with a camera dangling in your hand or around your neck. That was<br />
one of the reasons why I first got interested in small-sized<br />
electric cameras. But I've basically given the very small cameras<br />
away. The Minox, or whatever, the smaller one is to hard to get<br />
good quality out of, it was too hard to get good processing, and<br />
too slow anyway.<br />
Question:<br />
Have any cartoonists picked up your camera carrying habits?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
One of them ought to have. Pickering should have, because I Iour~ c , ect<br />
a book of his sometime last year I think, and he always a pipe in<br />
my mouth, and I haven't smoked a pipe for four years, so I thought<br />
I'd buy a pipe to make him honest and he thought he would buy me<br />
a pipe to make me honest, and that's the pipe he bought me that<br />
long-stemmed Dunhill, which must have cost him a fortune. And<br />
launching the book he wanted me to draw him or draw a line on a<br />
cartoon. I said no I wouldn't, I'd take a photograph of him<br />
instead, but I didn't tell him I was going to take a photograph<br />
with a fish-eye lens. That reminds me, some body wanted me to<br />
do a cartoon of something and I said get one of those fish-eye<br />
photographs. / 4 </p>
<p>Question: That's quite interesting. It would be new.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Somebody is having an exhibition or something at present on them.<br />
Question: How many pictures on average a month would you take, or is that<br />
a difficult question.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well there is no average. It might be none, if I'm going<br />
somewhere it could be several rolls. I operate on the hope<br />
that if you take a lot of photographs, one or two of them will<br />
be worth keeping. I take a lot more than I ever put in a book.<br />
Question:<br />
And do you look back on those books fairly often, or do they<br />
just get put in a book and forgotten.<br />
Prime minister:<br />
The family look back on them occasionally. I look back on them<br />
occasionally. I can't say I go to a photo album every night, but<br />
they are there, and they are a reminder, a record.<br />
Question: Do you think of your photography as a private thing or do you<br />
enjoy showing your work to others and do you send people prints?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It is a private family thing more. But if I've been on a trip<br />
or been somewhere and taken some photographs of other people<br />
I might send them copies of them, but more generally it's a family<br />
affair.<br />
Question: I would like to ask you some questions about your favourite piece<br />
of equipment, but I understand you mightn't want to mention brand<br />
names and stuf f like that.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Why not do it on what sort of cameras, what sort of lens length.<br />
I don't have to mention names. I think it's fairly clear. </p>
<p>Question: What sort of equipment do you use in a kit form?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
A standard 35 nun camera. I don't think I've used the standard<br />
nun or 55 nmn lens for a very long while. ( inaudible) wide<br />
angle 24 mm lens, which is the one that a very large number of<br />
press photographers use I think on a continuous basis. Its a<br />
versatile lens and for any filming that is around it's a very<br />
good lens. And it's a good lens inside. I have a fish-eye<br />
lens, which I use for odd occasions, but it's more a fun lens<br />
I think than one for serious photography, and I don't really<br />
like zoom lenses, although I have got one. I think they are<br />
a bit slow to use, a bit cumbersome, and I'm not sure that<br />
they are quite as sharp as a fixed focal length lens. And I<br />
have one telephoto lens and a 500 mm lens, which is good for<br />
wildlife or whatever, although when I really wanted it I didn't<br />
have it, which was an opportunity missed. Next time I hope it<br />
will be with me. The other lens which is interesting is the<br />
close-up lens, which gives a very great degree of magnification,<br />
and that is the lens I usually use for flower photography<br />
photographing camelias. I sometimes think it would be<br />
interesting to experiment with close-up photography of all<br />
sorts of different kinds. It really takes you into quite a<br />
different world and a fascinating one. But that will have to<br />
wait a little while<br />
Question: Do you want to give any criticisms or philosophies or likes or<br />
dislikes about camera design?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well it has advanced enormously, is much more versatile and is<br />
also easier to use than used to be the case. I think it will<br />
get very dull when there is automatic focusing and automatic<br />
everything, although I've got no doubt that automatic cameras<br />
sell in great quantities but they don't always assist the<br />
photographer's own creativity unless you can override the<br />
automatic elements and make the camera do exactly what you<br />
want. I think it's something that a lot of people get a great<br />
deal of pleasure out of families in particular can get a great<br />
deal of pleasure because it does provide a visual record, and I<br />
think that's the best record of different things that you do with<br />
your kids, your family, the good times you've had together.<br />
I don't think I've got anything in particular to say about<br />
equipment other than that. There is an enormous range. It must<br />
obviously be very hard for peopae to make up their minds what<br />
they want to buy if they don't have firm ideas of what make they<br />
want to go to, or what sort of camera they want to get. The<br />
opportunities are great, and generally the instruments are<br />
fairly easy to use these days. I can remember the first camera<br />
I had was, I suppose it would be by today's standards about<br />
or 60 years old, it would take six or eight films on a role.<br />
It was quarter plate size. Was that a regular size, quarter<br />
plate? And that used to take good, reliable black and white<br />
on old-fashioned slow film. But photography is a lot more / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
exciting today. It's one area where technology has opened up<br />
many new possibilities and I think greatly expanded the market<br />
because it has opened up more opportunities. The only camera<br />
you could get was the old quarter plate design or its<br />
equivalent, and I don't know that there would have been as<br />
many people interested as there are now.<br />
Question: How about flash? Do you like to use flash, or do you prefer<br />
to get along without it?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I like to carry a flash with me. I have one of those bounce<br />
flash things which reads it out automatically. It doesn't<br />
have. to bounce flash, but it can bounce and read automatically<br />
and make it very easy to use. Again if you are going to some<br />
places it enables you to take photographs that otherwise you<br />
wouldn't we saw midnight corroborees in Central Australia.<br />
That would have been missed completely if I didn't have a<br />
flash. In those circumstances I think it's well worth using.<br />
Question: Is there any particular photographer whose work you most admire?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think there are a number of good photographers. I don't<br />
suppose you'd mind me saying it, but Bruce Postle of The Age<br />
I think is a creative photographer and a good one. A particular<br />
photograph of his helped me out of a political problem on one<br />
occasion. Some of my political foes were trying to create, as<br />
I believe, a rather unfavourable image of Fraser as being archaic<br />
and unreasonable, and so they printed T-shirts deriding the English<br />
pound, to put value back into the pound and all sorts of other<br />
antiquated statements of that kind, and the press were starting<br />
to make something of this. So we worked out what we should do<br />
about it and got two attractive girls from the rag trade, and they<br />
donned these T-shirts, and they laid down on their backs and<br />
stuck their legs in the air, and they had a photograph of Fraser<br />
which they held between them. And I think Bruce Postle got up<br />
onto the ceiling and took a photograph looking down on them.<br />
This photograph appeared on the front page of The Age and I had<br />
a mini-press conference at the same time and said that I greatly<br />
valued my friends putting out these T-shirts because ( inaudible)<br />
Frank Crean and the one about-putting value back into the pound,<br />
and that I thought Jim Cairns had relieved matters. I picked out<br />
various political figures around, the ones who I thought were<br />
appropriate for a particular T-shirt, and that was the end of<br />
that spoof. The photograph spoofed the spoof very effectively<br />
and very well.<br />
Question: Any particular favourite type of picture? I was just thinking / 7 </p>
<p>7<br />
you could be a very good candid photographer.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, I don't think so. It depends upon circumstances. Some of the<br />
most interesting photographs are of people or incidents having<br />
people in them, incidents involving people have got more interest<br />
than just places. You can go to different parts of the world<br />
and photograph different places which are interesting and which<br />
you haven't seen before, and these provide a good record, and<br />
more than a record they provide a photographic opportunity.<br />
Question: Have you got any comments you'd like to make about the approach<br />
of Australian press photographers as against those that you meet<br />
overseas? Prime Minister:<br />
No, I think Australian press photographers basically do a fair<br />
enough job. They have got to take film, they do it. If given a<br />
reasonable opportunity they let it go at that. I don't think<br />
I'm usually pressured in trying to get photographs, they have<br />
got a job to do, to take photographs which are meant to be<br />
newsworthy. I think it's an easier question to ask and answer<br />
than one about Australian journalists.<br />
Question: Have you done any of your2iack and white film?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, never. I thought if I got involved I just wculdn't'have<br />
time. </p>
