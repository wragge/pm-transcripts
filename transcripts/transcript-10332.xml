PRIME MINISTER WIK<br />
At my meeting yesterday with Mr Fischer, Mr Anderson and National<br />
Party Federal President Don McDonald, during which aspects of my ten<br />
point plan were discussed, Mr McDonald and Mr Fischer proposed some<br />
wording changes.<br />
These changes, which made no difference to the substance of the plan,<br />
included confirmation that a pastoral lease, clearly stated to confer<br />
exclusive possession, would extinguish native title. This reflects the<br />
common law as expressed by the High Court in the Wik decision.<br />
At no stage did I agree, or would I agree, to changes which would allow<br />
avenues of extinguishment of native title beyond those already stated in the<br />
ten point plan.<br />
It would appear that Mr McDonald's reference in the penultimate<br />
paragraph of his press release today is to the procedure whereby native<br />
title can be compulsorily acquired by the states, subject to fair procedures<br />
and proper compensation.<br />
The current Native Title Act already allows for the compulsory acquisition<br />
of native title by state governments.<br />
Whilst the Government will continue to welcome input from both the<br />
Liberal and National Party organisations, a finn Cabinet position has been<br />
determined. Legislation will be established to give effect to that decision.<br />
