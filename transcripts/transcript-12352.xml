<p>E&amp;OE................................</p>
<p>Well thank you very much Rick Allert, Ladies and Gentlemen. I suppose the contribution that the wine industry makes to the economic strength, quite apart from the social enjoyment of life in Australia, is best encapsulated by my reflecting that about 36 years ago when I had a working holiday in the United Kingdom, Kangaroo Butter was probably the largest export to that country.   And I was talking to one of my sons a few weeks ago - he's planning to have a working holiday in the United Kingdom starting sometime this year - and I reminded him that the largest single export to the United Kingdom is now, I understand, red wine. And that little story in a sense is a metaphor for the way in which the wine industry has assumed such economic importance in Australia and of course the contribution that it's made to the enjoyment of life and the way in which the wine industry and everything associated with wine has become part and parcel to the Australian experience is something that all of us are very familiar with.</p>
<p>I do want to thank the generosity of the Australian wine makers for the Centenary of Federation blend. I understand the contributions total in value some $2 million and the wine makers throughout the country's wine regions each contributed 225 litres of their premium red wine from their 1999 vintage. And in December last Len Evans, Brian Coser, John Hanley and Ian McKenzie got together to produce the all Australian red wine. And 40,000 magnums of the Centenary of Federation Wine have been produced and this is the first time such a blend has been made. Each magnum is to be numbered in a present and put in a presentation box. And that'll include information - you'll be pleased to hear Mr Tony Eggleton, the National Director of the Council of the Centenary of Federation - will have information about the Centenary of Federation, it may even identify our first Prime Minister in terms of that extraordinary successful ad. And all aspects of the industries' contribution as I said amount in value to some $10 million.</p>
<p>And proceeds from the sale of the wine are going to go to a number of important projects including the Wine Foundation. And one of the responsibilities of that body will be to promote more research and better understanding in relation to the abuse of alcohol within our community and some of the resources from the sale of the wine will also go towards producing an oral history of the wine industry in Australia.</p>
<p>So I really am delighted that I was asked to be patron not only of this Centenary project but also of the Wine Foundation. I think it's a splendid idea and the Wine Centre in Adelaide which is taking very very quick shape and I understand will be ready for official opening in August will bring together in a very very effective way all that is so wonderful about the wine industry in Australia.</p>
<p>It is a great Australian industry. We are now after only France the second largest exporter of wine to the United Kingdom having replaced countries such as Italy and Spain and Germany in recent years. And when you understand the horrendous trade barriers through which we must sell and don't get me started on that subject or you'll be here in this hot environment for a very long period of time. It is a remarkable tribute to the quality of the product and it also is a remarkable tribute to the tremendous enthusiasm of the people who have made the Australian wine industry great. And I'm delighted that some of the great names in the industry such as John Hanley and Len Evans are here today. I really do appreciate that very much. And I'm delighted to see my former colleague and old friend David Brownhill who's Chairman of the Wine and Brandy Corporation also with us and to you Rick for the leadership that you've given to the industry and to John Kubrick as President. Can I say thank you to all of you, you're very warmly welcome to the Lodge.</p>
<p>I have great pleasure in launching the Centenary of Federation Wine Project, I think it's a wonderful way to mark the Centenary of Federation. Just think 100 years ago the place of wine drinking in the Australian community was quite different from what it is now. There was a very very different scene a very different attitude, a far more exclusive thing, the consumption of table wines in Australia 100 years ago. And fortunately all of that has changed and it is now something that, to use that frequently invoked word, is a far more inclusive pleasure than what it was 100 years ago and that is a terrific thing.</p>
<p>Wine is enjoyed by all sections of the Australian community and I think this project is a wonderful way to mark the Centenary and it is very important that the proceeds from the sale will go to such very appropriate causes. I have great pleasure in launching the project, thanking the wine industry for it's immense generosity and to the tremendous contribution that it's made to our country.</p>
<p>Thankyou.</p>
