    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.............................................................................................</p>
<p>Well, thank you very much, Dr Eric Tan, to Philip Ruddock, the</p>
<p>   Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in the Federal</p>
<p>   Government, to Colin Barnett, to Sir Charles Court, the former Premier</p>
<p>   of Western Australia, Senator Alan Eggleston, to my other Parliamentary</p>
<p>   colleagues, if I have missed any of them, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I am especially delighted to have the opportunity on this visit</p>
<p>   to Western Australia to address the Chamber of Commerce. It's</p>
<p>   a timely opportunity. It's a timely occasion and it is a chance</p>
<p>   to say a few things that are important to relations between Australia</p>
<p>   and Australia's neighbours in the Asia Pacific region, and</p>
<p>   it's also an opportunity for me to say something about the</p>
<p>   values that bind all of us together as Australians, irrespective</p>
<p>   of our racial or ethnic background.</p>
<p>I start by complementing the Chamber on the tremendous contribution</p>
<p>   that it's made to the commercial and social vigour of the city</p>
<p>   of Perth. There has been, for a long time, very close links between</p>
<p>   Western Australia and many of the nations of Asia. And I know that</p>
<p>   during his time as Premier, Sir Charles Court fostered very close</p>
<p>   links between Western Australia and the nations of Asia. And that</p>
<p>   tradition has been carried on by the Coalition Government in power</p>
<p>   in Western Australia at present.</p>
<p>The investment that has flowed and the contribution that has been</p>
<p>   made as a result of those links has played a very impressive part</p>
<p>   in building the economic strength of Perth and the economic strength</p>
<p>   of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It's also an occasion to thank the people of Chinese descent</p>
<p>   who have come to Australia from different parts of Asia for the</p>
<p>   contribution that they have made to the Australian nation. It's</p>
<p>   an occasion for me, on behalf of all Australians, to mark the enormous</p>
<p>   contribution of Chinese Australians to our nation. That is a contribution</p>
<p>   that is felt in every walk of life. It is felt in commerce. It is</p>
<p>   felt in the professions. It is felt in politics. It is felt in community</p>
<p>   life generally. And the bonds that have been developed between Australians</p>
<p>   of different backgrounds is one of the important and enduring values</p>
<p>   of the Australian community. And it is important at this time that</p>
<p>   those values and those bonds be very forcefully and powerfully stated.</p>
<p>Australia has a very long record of openness and tolerance towards</p>
<p>   people who have come to our shores from all around the world. In</p>
<p>   the years that immediately followed World War II, the doors of Australia</p>
<p>   were thrown open wide to hundreds of thousands, indeed millions,</p>
<p>   from different parts of Europe. But for a long time the doors were</p>
<p>   not thrown open to people from Asia. And it was under the Prime</p>
<p>   Ministership of Harold Holt who lead a Coalition Government in 1967</p>
<p>   to formally abandon what was known as the white Australia policy</p>
<p>   and from then on progressively Australia adopted and embraced a</p>
<p>   non-discriminatory immigration policy.</p>
<p>The level of immigration and the composition of the migrant intake</p>
<p>   to Australia will always be a matter of legitimate debate. And there</p>
<p>   are strongly held views on both sides of the argument as to whether</p>
<p>   Australia would benefit from, in present or immediately foreseeable</p>
<p>   circumstances, a significant increase in the migrant intake. And</p>
<p>   that is a debate that should be encouraged.</p>
<p>The Government that I lead has made a number of decisions since</p>
<p>   it came to power, which it believes have been in the national interest</p>
<p>   to alter the intake with a greater emphasis on skilled migration</p>
<p>   and a slightly lower emphasis on family reunion. And we have also,</p>
<p>   because of our assessment of economic circumstances, induced a reduction</p>
<p>   in the overall intake. Now there are those in the community who</p>
<p>   will disagree with that. There are those in the community who will</p>
<p>   argue that it ought to go further. And that is a matter of legitimate</p>
<p>   political debate in Australia.</p>
<p>But so far as I am concerned, and so far as the Government is concerned,</p>
<p>   we bring to that debate a number of very important principles. The</p>
<p>   first of those principles is that over the decades, particularly</p>
<p>   since World War II, migration has made an enormous contribution</p>
<p>   to Australia. It has helped change Australia for the better, not</p>
<p>   for the worse. It has helped make Australia a more outward looking,</p>
<p>   a more welcoming, a more interesting country. And perhaps the most</p>
<p>   valuable thing that I have observed over the years is the way in</p>
<p>   which we have been able to absorb into Australia people from something</p>
<p>   like 150 different countries with a remarkable degree of harmony.</p>
<p>   And that has been one of the great Australian achievements. I can't</p>
<p>   think of a country in the world that has done it more successfully.</p>
<p>   Nor can I think of a country in the world that has been able to</p>
<p>   do it and in the process preserve a core set of Australian values</p>
<p>   that maintain a long continuity of values connecting us now in the</p>
<p>   last years of the 20th Century, with the early beginnings</p>
<p>   of the Australian federation almost 100 years ago.</p>
<p>So we have bring to that debate as a Government, our view that</p>
<p>   immigration has been an enormous plus for Australia, and for Australia's</p>
<p>   development. And another principle or another value that we bring</p>
<p>   to the debate about immigration in Australia is that immigration</p>
<p>   in this country should be based firmly and absolutely on the principle</p>
<p>   of non-discrimination. In other words, we will not choose people</p>
<p>   according to their race, their ethnic or national origin. We do</p>
<p>   not prefer somebody because he or she is of a particular ethnic</p>
<p>   background against somebody else who is of another ethnic background.</p>
<p>   And I do want to make it very clear that the Government is firmly</p>
<p>   and resolutely opposed to any change in the non-discriminatory character</p>
<p>   of our immigration policy. It remains an important cornerstone,</p>
<p>   a core value of the approach that we bring to immigration. We believe</p>
<p>   that Australia's links to the various parts of the word have</p>
<p>   been enormously enhanced by the way in which we have been able to</p>
<p>   absorb people from different parts of the world.</p>
<p>We are proud of our record of tolerance. But like all things that</p>
<p>   we hold dear, like all values that are central to our being as a</p>
<p>   nation, the principle of tolerance and openness is not something</p>
<p>   that can be taken for granted. There are some in our community who</p>
<p>   would seek to foster division based on race and ethnic background.</p>
<p>   And it is the obligation of all of us, whatever our political beliefs,</p>
<p>   to hold firm against those attitudes. I believe they are minority</p>
<p>   attitudes. I believe they are attitudes that are held in contempt</p>
<p>   by the overwhelming majority of the Australian community. And they</p>
<p>   are certainly attitudes that are held in contempt by the members</p>
<p>   of the Government I have the privilege of leading.</p>
<p>I have often spoken, ladies and gentlemen, within the context of</p>
<p>   other polices of the Government, I have often spoken of the principal</p>
<p>   of mutual obligation. We have a policy in relation to work for the</p>
<p>   dole, which speaks for the principal of mutual obligation, that</p>
<p>   we as a civilised decent society have a belief that people who,</p>
<p>   through not fault of their own, are not able to get work, should</p>
<p>   be supported by the community, subject to certain principles and</p>
<p>   certain tests. But we say that in return for that support, those</p>
<p>   people should be willing to put something back into the community</p>
<p>   if it is reasonable of us to ask them to do so. And that principle</p>
<p>   and that policy which finds, the principles expressed through the</p>
<p>   policy of work for the dole, of mutual obligation, has been quite</p>
<p>   well received within the Australian community.</p>
<p>And I often see, ladies and gentlemen, the interaction between</p>
<p>   people who come to settle within Australia as being in another way</p>
<p>   the working out of that principal of mutual obligation. We who live</p>
<p>   in Australia have an obligation of welcome, of acceptance, of decency,</p>
<p>   of harmonious treatment and of tolerant understanding, of people</p>
<p>   who come to our country. And in return, those who come have an obligation</p>
<p>   to embrace along with all other Australians, whether they were born</p>
<p>   here or have come from another nation, have an obligation to embrace,</p>
<p>   along with all other Australians, the values that bind us together</p>
<p>   as Australians irrespective of their ethnic background.</p>
<p>And I've had occasion, in other circumstances, to remark that</p>
<p>   the things that unite us as Australians, are infinitely greater</p>
<p>   and more enduring than the things that divide us or put us apart.</p>
<p>   And those things that unite us as Australians, are things of which</p>
<p>   we should frequently remind ourselves. And they are things and values</p>
<p>   to which Chinese Australians, along with Australians of other ethnic</p>
<p>   descents have made an enormous contribution. They are the principles</p>
<p>   of tolerance and of fairness. A striding towards an essentially</p>
<p>   classless, egalitarian society. A belief in individual effort and</p>
<p>   individual liberty. A respect for the right of every Australian</p>
<p>   to treasure and to practice and to mark his or her own cultural</p>
<p>   heritage consistent with their membership of the broader Australian</p>
<p>   community.</p>
<p>Chinese Australians have made a particular contribution to our</p>
<p>   community. The energy that they have displayed in commerce and in</p>
<p>   the professions, constantly draws admiration from their fellow Australians.</p>
<p>   The contribution that they have made to the bonds of family life</p>
<p>   is equally something that draws admiration from their fellow Australians.</p>
<p>The Government has placed an enormous importance on the family</p>
<p>   unit. It's long been my belief that as well as being the environment</p>
<p>   in which children can best be raised to adulthood, united functioning</p>
<p>   families are the most effective social welfare system that any nation</p>
<p>   has devised. And the contribution made by the Chinese in particular,</p>
<p>   but not exclusively, to the strengthening of the family unit and</p>
<p>   the ideal of the strength of the family unit within Australian society</p>
<p>   is enormously important.</p>
<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, on this 50th anniversary,</p>
<p>   if I can put it that way, in meeting terms of the establishment</p>
<p>   of this firm, I did want to say those few things about some values</p>
<p>   that I regard as important, and some values that I regard as essential</p>
<p>   to the continuity of the kind of tolerant, harmonious society in</p>
<p>   which we all believe. There is no place within the modern Australia,</p>
<p>   for any semblance of racism or any semblance of intolerance based</p>
<p>   on racial difference. There is no place within our community for</p>
<p>   those who would argue that race or ethnic background should be a</p>
<p>   determining factor in the way in which people are treated or the</p>
<p>   way in which people are entitled to exercise their rights under</p>
<p>   the law.</p>
<p>I believe very strongly in a united Australian nation in which</p>
<p>   all people are equally accountable under the same set of laws and</p>
<p>   from which all Australians, irrespective of their background, are</p>
<p>   entitled to an equal dispensation of justice.</p>
<p>Before I conclude, I would like to say one or two things as well</p>
<p>   about the economic circumstances of Australia, particularly in relation</p>
<p>   to the Asia Pacific region. It is without any equivocation one of</p>
<p>   the proudest boasts of the Government that we have been able to</p>
<p>   give to Australia a measure of protection through the building of</p>
<p>   Australia's economic foundation which has meant that the worst</p>
<p>   effects of the Asian economic downturn have not come to Australia</p>
<p>   in a way that might otherwise have been the case if we had acted</p>
<p>   differently.</p>
<p>Over the last two and a quarter years, the Government has worked</p>
<p>   very hard to strengthen the foundations of the Australian economy.</p>
<p>   We now have the lowest inflation rate in the OECD area. We are projected</p>
<p>   to have probably the fastest economic growth rate of the G7 nations</p>
<p>   in 1998 and possibly also 1999. Australia now has the lowest interest</p>
<p>   rates that we have had for more than 30 years. And whereas three</p>
<p>   years ago we had a budget deficit running at $10.5 billion a year,</p>
<p>   I am very happy to say that Australia is now in surplus. Our levels</p>
<p>   of business investment are strong and Australia is widely respected</p>
<p>   in international financial and economic forums. But very relevantly</p>
<p>   to the region, that strength has enabled Australia to play a role</p>
<p>   in helping the countries of the region that are going through very</p>
<p>   difficult economic times. Along with Japan, Australia is the only</p>
<p>   country which has participated in each of the three international</p>
<p>   monetary fund bailouts of Indonesia, Thailand and Korea respectively.</p>
<p>   And we have done that because it is in the long term economic interests</p>
<p>   to do so. It is in Australia's interests that we have strong</p>
<p>   economies in the region. It is in Australia's interests that</p>
<p>   we build those economies up and help them during their hours of</p>
<p>   difficulty and need.</p>
<p>And when, as inevitably be the case, there is an economic resurgence</p>
<p>   in the Asian Pacific region, because there will. I have enormous</p>
<p>   long-term confidence in the economic strength of the Asian Pacific</p>
<p>   region. And when, inevitably the economic resurgence comes, the</p>
<p>   contribution that Australia made in the hour of need of many of</p>
<p>   those countries will be well and favourably remembered. We have</p>
<p>   not been a fair weather friend. We have put our financial support</p>
<p>   where our political rhetoric has been. And that contribution will</p>
<p>   be understood and it will be remembered.</p>
<p>The Government has endeavoured, in the two and a bit years that</p>
<p>   it has been in office to further build and diversify the links that</p>
<p>   already existed with so many of the nations in the region. And we've</p>
<p>   been particularly successful in improving Australia's relations</p>
<p>   with China consistent with the maintenance of very good relations</p>
<p>   with other parts of the region.</p>
<p>I am also very proud of the fact that through all the difficulties</p>
<p>   that Indonesia experienced a few months ago and which continues</p>
<p>   to experience, Australia has remained a very strong and faithful</p>
<p>   and reliable friend to that country and has recognised the long-term</p>
<p>   importance of the bilateral relationship between our two countries.</p>
<p>Japan, today, has chosen a new Prime Minister, the former Foreign</p>
<p>   Minister, Mr Obuchi. I want to take this opportunity of placing</p>
<p>   on public record my thanks to the man that he will succeed, Mr Hashimoto,</p>
<p>   for the contribution that Mr Hashimoto made to good relations between</p>
<p>   our two countries. He was a good friend of mine and he was a good</p>
<p>   friend of Australia. But I look forward to cooperating with equal</p>
<p>   warmth and closeness with the new Prime Minister of Japan, our best</p>
<p>   customer, our most important trading relationship and a nation with</p>
<p>   whom Australia has so much to share in the years to come.</p>
<p>When I became Prime Minister I said that I would continue the close</p>
<p>   relations between Australia and the nations of the Asian Pacific</p>
<p>   region. Our emphasis has, of necessity, been a little different</p>
<p>   from that of our predecessors. All governments do things in their</p>
<p>   own way and they do them a little differently and they have different</p>
<p>   impacts as time goes by. Without, in any way, weakening the links</p>
<p>   between Australia and the Asia-Pacific region, I wanted to make</p>
<p>   sure that our economic links with Europe and North America were</p>
<p>   as strong as they could possibly be. And I frequently said that</p>
<p>   the Government has tried to follow a policy of Asia first'</p>
<p>   as distinct from the policy of Asia only,' which sometimes,</p>
<p>   I think, was the impression given by the policies pursued by our</p>
<p>   predecessors. And in maintaining those links and in diversifying</p>
<p>   those links, we have been greatly aided by the contribution of so</p>
<p>   many Australians of Asian descent within our community. And they</p>
<p>   have played a very important role, on a people-to-people basis,</p>
<p>   in furthering our understanding of the communities with which we</p>
<p>   wish to develop and diversify those linkages.</p>
<p>We spend an enormous amount of time in this country navel-gazing</p>
<p>   about what kind of society we are. It seems that, on some occasions,</p>
<p>   that we engage in a form of public fretting about what it really</p>
<p>   means to be an Australian. It always strikes me as rather unnecessary</p>
<p>   and rather odd and rather unproductive. Because national identity,</p>
<p>   in so many ways, is an instinctive thing. It's something that</p>
<p>   belongs to the emotions rather than to the formal description. You</p>
<p>   don't write down what it means to be an Australian. You feel</p>
<p>   what it means to be an Australian. You don't indulge some kind</p>
<p>   of intellectual exercise in trying to enumerate Australian qualities</p>
<p>   and Australian values, you practice them. And we're practicing</p>
<p>   one great Australian value here tonight with such an enormously</p>
<p>   diverse audience, in terms of ethnic and racial background, yet</p>
<p>   we are bound together by something that is far greater than that</p>
<p>   diversity and that difference and that is a common love and a common</p>
<p>   commitment to our nation.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the Chamber of Commerce. I</p>
<p>   congratulate the forum on having made such a great contribution</p>
<p>   to the city of Perth, to the understanding and the harmony that</p>
<p>   exists between people of different backgrounds within the Australian</p>
<p>   community. I thank you for listening and I wish all of you much</p>
<p>   happiness and much success for the future.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, I'm Wilson Wu, Chairman of the International</p>
<p>   Business Council of Western Australia and also, happily, Vice President</p>
<p>   of the WA Chinese Chamber. In my work I travelled in parts of Asia.</p>
<p>   There's no doubt, as an Australian myself now and very proud</p>
<p>   to be one for the past 11 years, I came across a lot of business</p>
<p>   people asking about the Hanson phenomenon. Now, I'm very proud</p>
<p>   to say that we, in our own - I should rightly point out - always</p>
<p>   tell our friends and business people abroad, Australia is, indeed,</p>
<p>   a very tolerant society and, indeed, that is our hallmark. But,</p>
<p>   regardless, we still have to confront this recent phenomenon in</p>
<p>   terms of, perhaps it's a perception that maybe, just maybe,</p>
<p>   we're beginning to be seen or perceived by some of our friends</p>
<p>   abroad as being beginning to go along maybe a different path by</p>
<p>   some politics of divisiveness. So I'm asking, perhaps, as Prime</p>
<p>   Minister, you could give us some advice how we, as Australians going</p>
<p>   abroad, can confront this in a more positive role so that we can</p>
<p>   assist the Government, as well as in our own ways, make this perception</p>
<p>   correct.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'd be happy to try. There are a number of things you</p>
<p>   should say to those people about Australia. The first thing that</p>
<p>   you should say is what you mentioned in your question. And that</p>
<p>   is, Australia is a very harmonious, tolerant society. You might</p>
<p>   remind them, for example that on a per-capita basis Australia took</p>
<p>   more refugees from Indo-China in the 1970s than any nation on earth.</p>
<p>   You might remind them of that. You might also remind them that Australia</p>
<p>   has a very open, liberal democracy. We allow people to exercise</p>
<p>   freedom of speech in this country. We allow people to run for office.</p>
<p>   We are proud of our robust democracy. We have a free and open press.</p>
<p>   Sometimes it aggravates us, but it's infinitely better than</p>
<p>   the alternative, which is a cowed or muzzled press. You should remind</p>
<p>   them of that. You should also tell them that whilst some of the</p>
<p>   policies of the One Nation Party seek to exploit differences based</p>
<p>   on race, which they undoubtedly do, that the great bulk of the people</p>
<p>   who have voted for that party in Queensland have done so for other</p>
<p>   reasons. And I think it's very important, and I'm glad</p>
<p>   of the opportunity of such a gathering as this to speak very directly</p>
<p>   and to speak very frankly, because unless we have an understanding</p>
<p>   of what is happening we will get the messages wrong, not only to</p>
<p>   the Australian community but we'll get the messages wrong overseas.</p>
<p>The principle thing on which One Nation is playing is economic</p>
<p>   insecurity and bewilderment about change. But you have added to</p>
<p>   that an element of intolerance and insensitivity and desire to exploit</p>
<p>   differences based on race. Whenever you refer to people by a racial</p>
<p>   label you are running the risk of promoting hostility unless it</p>
<p>   is done in the most benign and understandable of circumstances,</p>
<p>   as I might do tonight by referring to people of Chinese background</p>
<p>   because this is the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and it would be</p>
<p>   rather strange if I didn't. It would be rather ill mannered</p>
<p>   of me if I didn't.</p>
<p>But the point I want to make to you, Wilson, is that the support</p>
<p>   base for the One Nation Party is drawn, principally, from people</p>
<p>   who respond to a simplistic answer to their difficulties. When you</p>
<p>   don't exercise power or hold office it's very easy to</p>
<p>   offer an instantaneous solution to everyone's problems. It's</p>
<p>   very easy to say that the way to improve Australia's rural</p>
<p>   economy is to keep out imports without being honest enough to acknowledge</p>
<p>   that if Australia locks out imports from other countries, those</p>
<p>   countries will lock out Australia's exports and that that would</p>
<p>   be very counterproductive. Now, what I would counsel you to say,</p>
<p>   suggest you might say to those people is, certainly, that we are</p>
<p>   a very tolerant country. You should say to them that we are a country</p>
<p>   that the great majority of whose citizens have no truck with and</p>
<p>   have no belief in and have no time for racism or intolerance based</p>
<p>   on race or ethnic difference. You should also point out that Australia,</p>
<p>   like all other countries that are open democracies, have experienced</p>
<p>   the rise from time to time, for a period of time, of political parties</p>
<p>   whose doctrines are based on economic populism and simplistic solutions.</p>
<p>   It's happened in other countries and there's no reason</p>
<p>   why it oughtn't happen in Australia. </p>
<p>Those who ask me: how do you deal with One Nation. I reply by saying,</p>
<p>   you deal with One Nation by reason, by argument, by fact, by commitment,</p>
<p>   by demonstration, but most of all by demonstration, that the policies</p>
<p>   you espouse are better than any alternative policies. The best way</p>
<p>   that the Government can deal with One Nation or, indeed, any other</p>
<p>   political party  because I take the opportunity of saying</p>
<p>   that the economic policies of One Nation are almost indistinguishable</p>
<p>   from those of the Australian Labor Party. On most of the major economic</p>
<p>   issues of debate in Australia at the present time, One Nation and</p>
<p>   the Labor Party are much closer than One Nation is to the Liberal</p>
<p>   Party or to the National Party. There's a strange view running</p>
<p>   around that they're closer to us on economic policy. They are</p>
<p>   much closer  I mean, Hanson and Beazley are almost indistinguishable</p>
