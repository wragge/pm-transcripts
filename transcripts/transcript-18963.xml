<p>Australia unequivocally condemns today's launch of a long-range rocket by North Korea.</p>
<p>The launch is a provocative and irresponsible act which has allowed North Korea to again test its ballistic missile technology.</p>
<p>North Korea's nuclear and long-range missile programs and its proliferation of sensitive technologies threaten the stability and security of our region.</p>
<p>North Korea's testing of long-range rockets violates United Nations Security Council resolutions and the Security Council's Statement earlier this year, and it defies the will of the international community.</p>
<p>Australia urges the Security Council to meet urgently and respond firmly.</p>
<p>This was another disappointing example of North Korea choosing a path of militarism and isolation.</p>
<p>This is North Korea's second, costly, long-range rocket launch this year.  And all the while its people struggle to get the food they need to survive.</p>
<p>We call on the North Korean Government to abide by UN Security Council resolutions, stop its provocations, improve the wellbeing of its people, and engage constructively with the international community.</p>
<p>Australia will be expressing its concerns directly to the North Korean Government. </p>
<p>We will continue to work vigorously with our friends and partners in the region, including with the Republic of Korea, to uphold peace and stability in North Asia. </p>
