    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce today that the Australian Government is providing $3 million in 2003-04 to the Menzies Foundation to support innovative health research.</p>
<p>The Menzies Foundation is a non-profit, non-political organisation created in 1979 to promote excellence in health research, education and post graduate scholarship by Australians.  This year, the Foundation will celebrate its 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>The Foundation has played a key role in health and medical research in Australia and formed productive partnerships between Australian and other countries.</p>
<p>The Foundation has also supported the establishment of the Menzies School of Health Research in Darwin and the Menzies Research Institute in Hobart, and has provided financial support for the Sir Robert Menzies Centre for Australian Studies in London.</p>
<p>  Work at these centres includes research into diabetes, heart and renal disease, maternal and child health, infectious diseases such as malaria, SIDS, cancer and multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>  The funding announced today will allow the Menzies Foundation to continue its outstanding work and to maintain its international reputation for excellence in health and medical research.</p>
<p>This financial support is a further demonstration of the Australian Government's commitment to health and medical research through the National Health and Medical Research Council.  </p>
