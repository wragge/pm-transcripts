Chr~ i McI~ wov, Margarcr COuffoyle, other distinguishcd guests, ladies, and gentlemen. it is<br />
a grcat dcliilit to address t06% coniference as past of the Ifrst Federal Council meeting of the<br />
new era of I~ ibcrad guvununt. I rumenbdr the day of the launch or our womnen's policy,<br />
remcrnlvr vety well and what a surxessraI policy it was and what a great~ sucuom~ we had<br />
in securine, thc electioun of a record number of wconen to the national Pzirliamnent.<br />
If ever a poUlical party dcemonstrated in relation to something that acticin speaks louder than<br />
rhvtuziu, tLhc l. ibvral Party demonstrated it with female representation. As it has been in so<br />
mainy other arcas, aftic rcpivsentation, miany other areas vf svprcstntaliort. so it has been<br />
in Motaion to fomrale represenaution in the national Parliamcni. We don't bdlive in the<br />
parniing symibolism of quotas, we believe in the practical reality of treating women on<br />
their~~~~ nnirlvnt by increasingly barte numbmr of them will elected as LIbeal<br />
members of the national Parliament. And just before I canto here I spoke on the phone to<br />
one of those wonicrt who was swept into office on the 2nd of March and one who is very<br />
much in our droughts at the preset time. And if ever a memnber of tho I iral Party, if<br />
cvsr a candidate for office is in our thnughts, and if ever a candidate descrvs ftta preat<br />
Austraian commodity of a fair go, it's Jackie Kelly. And if tomorrow tho pcoplo of<br />
Lindsay fix on a choice betn sromebody new, wmrebody igorous, wmfcbody acfive and<br />
somrebody whoe rprm~ nis ( bk' futurc and discards somebody who's part of the failed pat<br />
tlueJ they WMl indeud vote for Jackie and vore for her dircely tomorroW.<br />

flamly other arcas of life.<br />
If you took al thc differcrit policies aw we havv tried to bing dmwn you lovs4, at owr<br />

two days ago one of the Sreal btawfils of that policy s tAtl it will allow pvUPte to mnorc<br />
efrbezively blend their workqlace and their fxnily rusponslblity. And that is not only<br />

I'nI Very happy to say that in a bUd&amp; Ct WhiCh, in Other areas contain Some Very Signifficant<br />
arnd stringmn spending dcisonx, wo were able to mnake more mnircy " Avable for<br />
counsolling in relation to duniestic iolcnce. We were; able to make mare moncy . vailablc<br />

mnanigc and rulationship guidance. If prevcntion irs bett than curc in matters of Straigh~ t<br />

bmeadnwn of lii. relationship and Itsq negativu liostilo, violent attitudes that c~ ugc<br />
unuiappinoss and caurm abuse.<br />
I'm particularly prqud of my GovormniVs initiatives in thc area of small business.<br />
Women in small bumincss now conprise somethingj like 30 to 35 per cent of Mhe total small<br />
businoss swcor and it's growing at a very rapid rate. Thw successful entwy of women into<br />
the smull business component of the servicc sector of our eeonoiny is particularly rapid.<br />
Nowhere do you~ Soo the transformation of Mhe workforcc from that old paradigm of bluecollar<br />
malc employod in niatifaetaring, woiijn to a foruman in one Lurgo afta where<br />
most of the employces congregate. than in thre ara of wnall businms with woman. And<br />
the way in which in rctail, in computing servioms i marketing, in certain areas of<br />
manufacturinS in tourism, in trade promnotion, in just so many othe. r areas, thate has been<br />
a spoctalr growth orft participation of women And our polioia for the all<br />
businoss community of Australia arc very mtuch designod to crihaneu the growtih of small<br />
busincis". And I look forward to the day when I hops it's not too distant when tt<br />
industrial relations bill dme pass and we will have swepi away thoso ridculous wtfir<br />
dismissal laws.<br />
Ilic reality of courso, ladicq and gentlemen, is that as timc goes by and we move into the<br />
ar;-M century lucr; will be fewer and fewer Australiats aniployod by big companies and<br />
therC Will be proportionately morm and more employed by smnall companies. I don't tMink<br />
the modemn community has Yet understood fully thu impact of the ommznrurications<br />
revolution on fth role of tmall businesses in our society. The way in which thoso Ijiree<br />
tools of that revolution the personal computer, the mobile telephoac and the facsinileo<br />
machine havc absolutely rwoltifordse the doing of business by small firms. Those, three<br />
tools alono ive to wntail firnis, including in particular and this is relevant wo many women<br />
as it is to mon including a greater capacity to work out of your own home. Thu way in/<br />
which those three tooLs have revolutionized the circumstances in whivch you do business, I<br />
don't think has been fully undmtood.<br />
It used to be tho cane in the 1970s that bUS was bcautiful that utless you becarne bigger<br />
and biggcr then you couldn't got the economies of scale, you couldn't Sav yourself a<br />
sufficiently Atrong conomic. base to penietrate 3 worldwide maket, and unless you cohered<br />
with another unit to form a larger unit you were't going to mAlc. ii. But modem<br />
conuunications have altered so much of that, and to use the currentI idiom, those changes<br />
