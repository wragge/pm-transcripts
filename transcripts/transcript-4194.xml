MEDIA RELEASE PROTEST AGAINST THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister, Mr. Anthony<br />
The action of demonstrators in engaging in vandalism<br />
at St. Stephen's Church in Sydney was deplorable, and will be<br />
condemned by the great majority of people.<br />
What this hooligan element does not seem to understand<br />
is that it was not Sir John Kerr who turned a 5-seat Labor<br />
majority in Federal Parliament into a 55-seat Liberal-National<br />
Country Party majority last December, but the Australian people<br />
themselves. The Labor Party itself stands condemned for its continued<br />
failure to make the slightest effort to disown the actions of<br />
a violent, very small minority in attacking the constitutional<br />
and democratic system which enabled the community to express<br />
its own judgement last year.<br />
Canberra 26 July 1976 </p>
