PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP,<br />
TO THE INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS LUNCHEON, MELBOURNE<br />
WEDNESDAY 21 APRIL 1993<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
The change in our circumstances over the last decade, even<br />
over the last three years, has been profound so profound<br />
it is likely that we have yet to completely absorb its<br />
meaning. We remain beset by all sorts of problems yet the promise is<br />
undeniable. We have never had such opportunities and in<br />
the last decade we have put ourselves in a position where we<br />
have every reason to believe that we can grasp them.<br />
For all the failures -of the last decade we were bold enough<br />
and conscientious enough to do those things which have given<br />
ourselves a chance in the world.<br />
For all that remains to be done the vision of Australia as a<br />
successful trading nation integrated with the world and the<br />
region is now taking shape.<br />
For all the obstacles we still have to overcome, it is<br />
possible that we are now within reach of a new era of<br />
Australian prosperity of self-sustaining growth, of<br />
saving, invest ment, rising productivity, rising incomes,<br />
rising saving, and more growth.<br />
We have eliminated inflation as a problem in the Australian<br />
economy and we have a government, a trade union movement,<br />
a community committed to preventing it ever coming back.<br />
We have upgraded the skills of the workforce, and we have<br />
put into' place plans to continue upgrading it. </p>
<p>2<br />
We have a much more competitive regulatory environment -and<br />
we will do more.<br />
We have cut industrial disputes to less than half their<br />
level ten years ago, and workplace bargains now cover one<br />
third of employees under federal awards.<br />
Above all, we have begun to internationalise the economy and<br />
change the pattern of production.<br />
We have set ourselves on an irreversible path of winding<br />
down the tariff protection which for so long fettered the<br />
Australian economy. A practical, sensible and measured<br />
program. We have shifted the trade deficit from over 3 per cent of<br />
GDP 10 years ago, to a small surplus in the last financial<br />
year. We have increased exports as a share of GDP from 13 per cent<br />
to over 20 per cent.<br />
The significance of the structura-lchanoe is underlined by<br />
the fact that manufacturing exports are today consistently<br />
equal to or greater than rural exports. Service exports are<br />
now one fifth of our total exports.<br />
We are exporting a higher and higher proportion of product<br />
to the booming markets of East Asia. A higher and higher<br />
proportion of it consists of manufactures. And thatexported<br />
product is more and more coming from relatively<br />
small, highly adaptable firms which depend upon exports for<br />
their survival and growth.<br />
These are big changes substantial, real, and irreversible<br />
changes. There were also shortcomings in the eighties: they left us<br />
with a million people unemployed.<br />
In the course of the election campaign and on the night that<br />
the votes were counted, I said that reducing unemployment<br />
would be the first priority of a second Keating government.<br />
It will be.<br />
Unemployment is principally a result of the recession.<br />
It is an undeniable fact that unemployment is not going to<br />
fall dramatically in the next few years, and equally </p>
<p>3<br />
undeniable is the fact that longerm unemployment will<br />
increase.<br />
There are now more than 300,000 people who have been<br />
unemployed for 12 months or more. As unemployment falls<br />
over the next few years the number of long-term unemployed<br />
will increase as employers often prefer to take up new<br />
entrants to the labour market or those with only short<br />
periods of unemployment.<br />
But I can tell you now we will not be accepting long-term<br />
unemployment as an insoluble problem, or as an inevitable<br />
fact of life in the new economic order.<br />
Over the past two years, we have greatly increased<br />
assistance for the long-term unemployed and improved the<br />
effectiveness of our labour market programs.<br />
In my speech on election night, I renewed the Government's<br />
commitment to helping those who are unemployed. In<br />
particular, we are determined to reduce long-term<br />
unemployment and assist people who are in this position. If<br />
new policies and practices have to be developed we will<br />
develop them.<br />
The Employment, Education and Training Minister, Kim Beazley<br />
is now examining the full range of programs for the longterm<br />
unemployed to see where improvements can be made.<br />
One thing I think we should now be asking ourselves if the<br />
practice of wholesale retrenchment is really a synonym for<br />
efficiency. We should ask if the human consequences and the social<br />
consequences are not too great. If the economic burden on<br />
the nation does not outweigh the benefits to productivity.<br />
If the uncertainty and resentment retrenchments create does<br />
not in fact reuc efficiency. And if the initial<br />
improvement to the bottom line of balance sheets is not in<br />
many cases more than offset by the resulting inability of<br />
firms to gear up to meet opportunities as demand expands.<br />
I think governments and business alike should be asking<br />
these questions.<br />
As I said during the election campaign: we got a lot right<br />
in the eighties, but we also got a few things wrong. </p>
<p>4<br />
It is not right that the unemployed should alone pay for<br />
these mistakes; any more than it is right that governments<br />
should withdraw from the consequences of their actions.<br />
The fact is we cannot separate economic ends from social<br />
ones. It is expected of governments that they should seize<br />
national opportunities, such as those which now present<br />
themselves. They should seize them because the national<br />
interest is at stake, the well being of the nation and the<br />
people. The same is true of our social responsibilities, especially<br />
our responsibilities to the unemployed.<br />
I take the March 13 result as a mandate for an Australian<br />
social democratic agenda for strong economic policy<br />
married to programs which produce not just social justice<br />
but social cohesion and strength.<br />
In no way should that put the Government and business at<br />
odds. The success of economic policy depends on the success<br />
of business. The opportunities will have to be seized by<br />
business. The national interest depends on business and<br />
to a very considerable extent I mean small and medium sized<br />
business. I am saying that we have mutual interests and mutual<br />
responsibilities in the economy and society. I am saying<br />
that we should work together for economic an oca ends. I<br />
am saying that our vision should be broad, inclusive,<br />
nationa. We should share it.<br />
The prospect of a new era of Australian prosperity derives<br />
from our having the preconditions of low inflation and a<br />
restructured economy: yet we feel it is also within reach<br />
because there is a new sense of national energy and national<br />
purpose.<br />
Business leaders should not be surprised that tangible<br />
benefits spring from such intangible things as shared goals,<br />
energy and purpose they have their parallels in every<br />
decent management text book.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, the eighties were a time of real<br />
achievement, but they were also a time of slow productivity<br />
growth, slow income growth, and of national saving<br />
inadequate to the investment task we faced.<br />
The trick in the coming decade will be to keep all our gains<br />
on inflation, on competitiveness, and on exports. </p>
<p>To keep all these, and at the same time to increase our<br />
investment so that productivity rises faster, and incomes<br />
rise faster, and generate the savings out of which further<br />
investment and further growth is sustained.<br />
It can be done.<br />
There Ja a new confidence abroad.<br />
Already we can see that the expansion currently underway is<br />
quality expansion.<br />
Growth has now been posted for five consecutive quarters.<br />
The current growth rate of 2. 5 per cent is slower than we<br />
need to make real inroads into the numbers of unemployed,<br />
but we need to bear in mind the context of a slow world<br />
economy, where two of the three major world economies are<br />
still in recession.<br />
More importantly the recovery that we have seen over the<br />
past five quarters displays precisely those characteristics<br />
that are required if Australia is to achieve higher and<br />
sustainable growth throughout the 1990s.<br />
Our current inflation rate of 0.3 per cent is the lowest in<br />
the industrialised world.<br />
Net profits in the December quarter 1992 were 75 per cent<br />
above the levels of a year ago.<br />
Productivity in the market sector has grown by 2 per cent<br />
over each of the past two years.<br />
And by tying wages growth increasingly to productivity, unit<br />
labour costs will remain competitive. We have already seen<br />
real unit labour costs fall 0.5 per cent over the last year.<br />
In the last three years only one country out of 23 surveyed<br />
by the OECD saw its trade competitiveness improve more than<br />
Australia's. The performance of our manufactured exports provides an idea<br />
of how effective these trends can be. While world economic<br />
growth has been slowing, Australia's manufactured exports<br />
have continued to grow. In the current financial year, they<br />
are nearly 20 per cent higher than in the corresponding<br />
period for the previous financial year.<br />
The characteristics of our growth provide encouraging signs<br />
for the future. When the world recovery begins in earnest, </p>
<p>Australian firms, operating in a low-inflationary, highproductivity,<br />
competitive environment, will be well placed<br />
to reap the benefits and create in Australia growth of a<br />
kind which will mean long-term employment opportunities.<br />
Success in the coming decade certainly depends on things we<br />
must do in Canberra.<br />
It depends crucially on Australian workers, who must<br />
continue to adapt and change and win for themselves the<br />
increasing incomes that are within their grasp. Under the<br />
workplace bargaining system we have adopted and which we<br />
will entrench this year, employees themselves are for the<br />
first time in our history able to create the circumstances<br />
of their own prosperity.<br />
But its up to business leaders to now seize the<br />
opportunities to take advantage of the new structure for<br />
business which is now being laid down.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
Investment is the key to economic growth.<br />
The continuing opening of Australian industry to<br />
international competition ensures that firms can no longer<br />
afford to ignore advances in technical capabilities and the<br />
competitive advantages associated with them.<br />
We need to invest not just for replacement purposes, but<br />
also for strategic purposes.<br />
This requires our investing in our people, in ideas and in<br />
physical capital.<br />
It starts with a highly skilled and responsive workforce.<br />
This has been the foundation for our successes in developing<br />
new export markets, and it will continue to be.<br />
The demand for a highly skilled workforce provides enormous<br />
challenges for our entire education system, challenges that<br />
are being met: first through our reforms to secondary and<br />
university education, now through a major transformation in<br />
vocational training.<br />
Australia's record of investment in ideas has been mediocre,<br />
but we have begun to develop an increasingly innovative<br />
culture. </p>
<p>7<br />
The Government has provided direct grants and assistance<br />
through the taxation system, especially the 150 per cent tax<br />
concession, to encourage greater business contribution to<br />
research and development. Direct assistance is also<br />
provided to fund cooperative research centres to facilitate<br />
greater collaboration between universities, research<br />
institutions and industry.<br />
The most pressing need today is to lift investment in<br />
physical capital.<br />
Many businesses and banks scaled back their operations as<br />
they sought to strengthen balance sheets after the excesses<br />
of the late 1980s. While addressing severe debt problems<br />
was often necessary, the resultant fall in investment<br />
spending cannot continue.<br />
Business fixed investment increased solidly in the December<br />
quarter, and I hope this is the start of a strong recovery<br />
on investment.<br />
The conditions are there for this to materialise low<br />
inflation, good profits, industrial peace.<br />
Moreover, we now have an extremely competitive tax regime<br />
with the corporate tax rate at 33 per cent, accelerated<br />
depreciation and incentives to invest through the<br />
development allowance and the additional investment<br />
allowance announced in " Investing in the Nation".<br />
In addition, we are encouraging banks to get out there and<br />
lend for worthwhile projects based on a close knowledge of<br />
the firm's operations. The banks assure us they starting to<br />
respond. As the recovery strengthens, we need as a nation to finance<br />
expanding investment through domestic saving.<br />
Saving is not a constraint on our economic recovery over the<br />
next year or so.<br />
And, indeed the recovery itself will lift national saving.<br />
But increased national saving is a central goal for policy<br />
in the 1990s.<br />
That is why we introduced the superannuation guarantee<br />
charge, and why we will increase its rate over the decade.<br />
It is also why we are committed to bringing the deficit down<br />
to 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. </p>
<p>You can be assured we will do it but you can also be<br />
assured that we will not ignore other priorities as we do<br />
SO.<br />
We will also continue our program of micro economic reform.<br />
We will build more competitive industries by strengthening<br />
competition. The National Competition Policy Inquiry led by Professor<br />
Hilmer will report shortly.<br />
An immediate priority will be to improve the performance of<br />
our trading enterprises. The reform of management<br />
structures, pricing regimes and opening up these markets to<br />
competition can achieve important gains for competitiveness.<br />
The cooperation of the States is vital and we have<br />
established processes through the Council of Australian<br />
Governments to develop national approaches to reform. The<br />
States have a lot at stake not only are they accountable<br />
for the performance of their GBEs there is also scope for<br />
reform to contribute towards the repair of their budgets.<br />
one feature of the recession that has been of considerable<br />
concern has been its impact on different regions. It is<br />
inevitable that differences between regions will develop<br />
from time to time, but the severity of this downturn in<br />
parts of the country demands specific action by Government.<br />
In Alan Griffiths, we now have a senior Minister in Cabinet<br />
charged with regional development. As a result, the<br />
regional dimension of all Government policies will come<br />
under constant focus.<br />
Existing programs will be reviewed, including to ensure<br />
harmonisation with State programs.<br />
More generally, any constraints on development in the<br />
regions will be assessed with an aim of facilitating new<br />
investment. There has been some speculation that this Government may<br />
adopt a more interventionist approach to industry.<br />
Let me say this.<br />
Labor has always believed that Government has a pivotal part<br />
to play in developing Australian industry, one where<br />
sensible intervention is called for. </p>
<p>Hiding behind the tariff wall was not sensible.<br />
Handouts to favoured industries with little future in a<br />
competitive world economy were not sensible.<br />
Rather, we will continue to encourage our industries to<br />
respond to competitive forces.<br />
We will continue to foster responsive workplaces.<br />
We will continue to provide support where the market alone<br />
does not perform adequately, in areas such as research and<br />
development, in export finance, in services to small<br />
business. We will continue to encourage investment through the tax<br />
system, and to foster closer relations between banks and<br />
business. We will continue to improve the nation's infrastructure and<br />
to press for the efficient provision of services like<br />
transport and power.<br />
All this is the basis for Labor's industry policy..<br />
Where fundamental change is needed, we will provide<br />
adjustment assistance so that our industries and businesses<br />
can adapt to new challenges, just as we have in the rural<br />
sector and TCF industries.<br />
Where bringing major players together helps industries at<br />
large to seize opportunities we will do so, just as we have<br />
in telecommunications and processed food.<br />
Of course we do not face a level playing field in the world<br />
economy. But the answer is not to prop up industries that can only<br />
survive in a protected domestic market.<br />
Rather, the answer is to use dexterity and awareness to<br />
ensure that Australian industry can compete effectively in<br />
the world.<br />
And, as our export performance demonstrates, this strategy<br />
works. Ladies and Gentlemen, </p>
<p>All these are important issues for the government, but there<br />
is no economic reform more central than to complete the<br />
construction of a system of industrial relations which will<br />
enhance productivity, protect the weak, and distribute<br />
fairly the rewards of cooperation in the workplace.<br />
We have come a long way in a short time with industrial<br />
relations. Since 1983 we have more than halved the days lost through<br />
strike action.<br />
We have dramatically cut real unit labour costs while<br />
restoring the profit share.<br />
Australia's union movement is committed to wage increases<br />
consistent with maintaining our international<br />
competitiveness. And we now have workplace or enterprise bargains<br />
proliferating rapidly.<br />
There has been substantial progress, but I think we need to<br />
do a lot more.<br />
Let me describe the model of industrial relations we are<br />
working towards.<br />
It is a model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at<br />
the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards<br />
provided by arbitral tribunals.<br />
It is a model under which compulsorily arbitrated awards and<br />
arbitrated wage increases would be there only as a safety<br />
net. This safety net would not be intended to prescribe the<br />
actual conditions of work of most employees, but only to<br />
catch those unable to make workplace agreements with<br />
employers. Over time the safety net would inevitably become simpler.<br />
We would have fewer awards, with fewer clauses.<br />
For most employees and most businesses, wages and conditions<br />
of work would be determined by agreements worked out by the<br />
employer, the employees and their union.<br />
These agreements would predominantly be based on improving<br />
the productive performance of enterprises, because both<br />
employers and employees are coming to understand that only </p>
<p>productivity improvements can guarantee sustainable real<br />
wage increases.<br />
We would continue to have an Accord with the trade union<br />
movement, guaranteeing the safety net of the award system<br />
and the steady accumulation of occupational superannuation,<br />
with improvements to both the safety net and occupational<br />
superannuation governed by a commitment to international<br />
competitiveness. We would have an Industrial Relations Commission which<br />
helped employers and employees reach enterprise bargains,<br />
which kept the safety net in good repair, which advised the<br />
Government and the parties of emerging difficulties and<br />
possible improvements,-but which would rarely have to use<br />
its compulsory arbitral powers. Instead, parties would be<br />
expected to bargain in good faith.<br />
We would have sufficient harmony between State and Federal<br />
industrial relations systems to ensure that they all head in<br />
the same direction and used the same general rules.<br />
That is the goal we are working towards. So how f ar are we<br />
from reaching it?<br />
Whea enw enerprse brgans which cover one third of the<br />
workforce under federal awards. Over eight hundred<br />
agreements covering nearly three quarters of a million<br />
employees. That is extremely encouraging, but its not enough not<br />
nearly enough.<br />
We want it to be close to one hundred per cent of employees<br />
under federal awards.<br />
And federal awards, of course, cover less than one third of<br />
all employees.<br />
In all of the six state systems only a small number of<br />
employees are covered by enterprise agreements.<br />
NSW, the biggest state, has only about 7,000.<br />
Victoria has only about 80 agreements in total.<br />
And of course there are lots of employees who for one reason<br />
or another don't have a union to represent them.<br />
We need to make the system more flexible and relevant to our<br />
present and future needs. </p>
<p>12<br />
We need to accelerate workplace or enterprise bargaining and<br />
this is as much a responsibility of employers as it is of<br />
unions and governments.<br />
There are not enough enterprise bargains and the bargains<br />
we do have are sometimes not sufficiently comprehensive.<br />
We need to find a way of extending the coverage of<br />
agreements from being add-ons to awards, as they sometimes<br />
are today, to being full substitutes for awards.<br />
As we change to a national system of workplace bargiqning<br />
our laws and institutions will need to be mo dified to fit<br />
the system we are creating.<br />
For example we have laws which give the AIRC a role and<br />
powers that are not well suited to the system we are trying<br />
to create.<br />
My own view is that the government should provide the<br />
direction and leadership necessary to ensure that Australian<br />
industrial relations operate to advance our national<br />
interest.<br />
The Government should do this and we will.<br />
It is our responsibility to work out a way in which the IRC<br />
has suitable powers to run the kind of system we need not<br />
the kind of adversarial system we have had.<br />
The shortcomings in our legal structure go well beyond the<br />
role of the AIRC.<br />
They are also quite plain in the lack of credible means of<br />
enforcing agreements.<br />
Where agreements or other awards apply there should be<br />
clear, substantial and easily enforceable penalties for<br />
breaches. An integrated, comprehensive and simple framework for making<br />
and enforcing agreements.<br />
These are shortcomings which I have asked the industrial<br />
relations minister Laurie Brereton to look into and remedy.<br />
Over the next three or four months he will be consulting as<br />
extensively as he can with employers and employees and<br />
their unions, with the states, with the AIRC, with academics<br />
and experts to come up with the best solutions. </p>
<p>13<br />
The solution will certainly include legislation implementing<br />
our commitment to ILO conventions on minimum pay equal pay<br />
and on redundancy.<br />
I know Laurie Brereton will invite the liveliest debate and<br />
I hope all interested parties will join it.<br />
I expect that by the time we get to the Budget sitting of<br />
Parliament he will have put together a package to renovate<br />
the legal and institutional structure of Australia's<br />
industrial relations and one that fits with the national<br />
system of workplace bargaining we are already creating.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Completing industrial relations reform is another link in<br />
the chain of reform which began a decade ago. It is<br />
important now that we accelerate the reform so that all the<br />
other elements of flexibility in the economy can work in<br />
greater harmony.<br />
I am confident about success. As I said in the campaign, I<br />
now dare to believe that the dream of decade or more ago is<br />
about to be realised. That Australia will become a<br />
creative, innovative, manufacturing nation in the front rank<br />
of trading nations and the front rank of social democracies.<br />
I now believe it will happen because there so many signs to<br />
tell us what we have done is succeeding and that is the<br />
best assurance that we will succeed in doing all that<br />
remains to be done. </p>
