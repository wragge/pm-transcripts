    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Gillard Government today welcomed the announcement by Afghanistan's President, Hamid Karzai, that a third tranche of provinces and districts would begin transition to Afghan-led security responsibility from the middle of the year.</p>
<p>The third tranche includes Uruzgan Province, where Australia's Mentoring Task Force, Special Forces and Provincial Reconstruction Team work with their Afghan and International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) counterparts. </p>
<p>With the third tranche of transition, more than 75 percent of Afghanistan's population will live in areas under Afghan security lead.</p>
<p>At the Lisbon NATO-ISAF Summit in November 2010, Afghanistan and ISAF countries agreed that Afghan security forces would take responsibility for security by the end of 2014.</p>
<p>President Karzai's announcement is a strong signal that the transition process is on track. </p>
<p>Australia is firmly committed to Afghanistan and to the agreed transition strategy and its implementation. </p>
<p>Transition is a gradual process, not an event, achieved when the conditions are right on a province-by-province and district-by-district basis.</p>
<p>The inclusion of Uruzgan province in Tranche 3 reflects the progress made by Afghan, Australian and ISAF military and civilian teams in improving security and in the training and mentoring of the Afghan National Security Forces.</p>
<p>As transition gets underway in Uruzgan, Australia's Mentoring Task Force and Special Operations forces will support Afghan National Security Forces as they progressively take the lead for security.</p>
<p>As ISAF has said, the complete process of transition in an area can take 12-18 months, meaning that Australia's target of completing transition in Uruzgan by the end of 2014, and possibly earlier, is on track.</p>
<p>Australia will continue its strong support for Afghanistan after transition, including through a training and advisory role and through a possible special forces contribution.  This ongoing commitment to Afghanistan will be a feature of Australia's contribution to the Chicago NATO-ISAF Summit next week, which we will attend.</p>
