The Acting Prime Minister, Dr J. F. Cairns,<br />
released the following statement after today's Cabinet<br />
Meeting in Sydney.<br />
The Cabinet today considered the distribution of<br />
funds donated by the people of Australia to assist the people<br />
of Darwin. The Prime Minister in his statement of 30 December,<br />
1974, indicated that the Government was concerned to ensure<br />
that the money so readily donated by sympathetic and<br />
concerned Australians was distributed in a responsible manner,<br />
to relieve the hardship of the people of Darwin, recognising<br />
that the majority of them are no longer in Darwin.<br />
The Cabinet noted that a Committee has been formed<br />
comprising representatives of the Red Cross, the Salvation<br />
Army, the Aborigines, the women and children of Darwin, the<br />
Australian Council of Churches, and of the Northern Territory<br />
Legislative Assembly, the City of Darwin Corporation, and<br />
Government institutions.<br />
The committee will be responsible for the<br />
distribution of funds channelled into it.<br />
Commenting on today's Cabinet meeting, the Acting<br />
Prime Minister Dr J. F Cairns, said the Australian Government<br />
would assist the Committee to the full, not only in<br />
co-ordinating the activities of the Committee with the<br />
activities of Government Departments, but would also ensure<br />
that the funds are used for the purposes for which they were<br />
donated. </p>

Dr Cairns said that while he understood the desire<br />
of Darwin's political leaders to exercise responsibility in<br />
the use of donated funds, the matter could not be left to<br />
them alone. This was partly because the majority of Darwin's<br />
residents are not in Darwin at all, and partly because<br />
there can be much duplication in the distribution of funds<br />
unless the Committee handling the funds is aware of all<br />
allocations made by Government Departments, voltntary bodies,<br />
and others. Similarly, some persons could be left out altogether.<br />
Dr Cairns stressed the positive and non-political<br />
stand taken by himself, the Australian Government, and the<br />
Leader of the Opposition and called on all concerned to<br />
re-establish the spirit of co-operation that has prevailed so<br />
far throughout Australia.<br />
Dr Cairns said the Australian Government did not<br />
require that funds be handed over to it, nor did it want to<br />
deprive local political leaders of a full role in deciding<br />
what is done. But equally, he said, the Government would<br />
not abdicate its own responsibilities, not only to Darwin<br />
residents, still in Darwin, but to the majority of them who<br />
are elsewhere. " I say to Darwin political leaders, to Premiers,<br />
Mayors, sponsors of funds and to all others: Let us work<br />
together in ensuring that the generosity of the Australian<br />
people is properly used for the benefit of the people of<br />
Darwin." 7 January, 1975<br />
Note: Donations etc collected in various Darwin appeals can<br />
be sent. to Mr John McDonald, Executive Officer, Darwin<br />
Relief Appeal, Darwin; or to the Minister for the Northern<br />
Territory, Parliament House, Canberra. </p>
