F76/ 15<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 2 February 1976<br />
PUTTING JOBS FIRST<br />
The Government's paramount responsibility is to overcome<br />
inflation, so that th~ ere will be jobs for all those who want<br />
to work.<br />
While inflation remains at high levels, individuals do not<br />
have the confidence to spend, and businesses, small or large,<br />
do not have the confidence to invest in the future of their<br />
-industries. A 63.4 percent increase in wages and salaries would increase<br />
unemployment and inflation, and undermine the confidence necessary<br />
for economic recovery. This large increase would quickly lead<br />
to price rises. These in turn would lead to further wage<br />
claims. The vicious cycle has to be broken.<br />
In the present circumstances, we had to place the highest<br />
importance in fighting inflation and in creating jobs.<br />
We have placed jobs first. We have placed Australia first.<br />
I believe the great majority of Australians now recognise<br />
that high wage increases result in higher prices and the loss<br />
of jobs by tens of thousands of Australians.<br />
our responsibility in managing the nation is to break the<br />
inflationary spiral. If the Government is not prepared to tackle<br />
this task, no one else will do so. And thus we made the decision<br />
that we did. ./ 2 </p>

It would have been easy to take the other path and fail<br />
to oppose passing on the C. P. I. increase in full. It<br />
would have been irresponsible, and it would have been paid<br />
for by * nigher unemployment and inflation.<br />
Australia c-nnot afLford continued inflation, continued unemploymnent.<br />
I can understand the disappointment that some people may feel,<br />
but the Govern~ ment has had to choose between jobs and illusory<br />
wage increases. That choice may nct be popular in the<br />
short-term. But for the good of the Australian economy,<br />
for the employment of Australian people, for young men and women<br />
seeking their first job, there is no question that the choice<br />
we have made is the only responsible one.<br />
Earlier we indicated a willingness to listen to other<br />
people's views concerning the P. J. T. A conference is<br />
being organized to discuss its future in March. That has been<br />
welcomed. Now with the fullest knowledge available to us from Government<br />
departiaents, with more recent knowledge concerning the<br />
economy, we believe that earlier views on implementing wage<br />
indexation to the fullest extent of the C. P. I. have to be<br />
modified if Australia's inflation and unemployment is to<br />
be overcome.<br />
I have al-raady said there are no soft options left for<br />
Australians. There is no quick way out of our economic<br />
problems. The Federal Government must do what it believes<br />
to be right to overcome inflation and to restore employment.<br />
A -further-statemenyt will be made later this week concerning,<br />
economies in the Federal Government's own Budget. </p>
