P~ ME NIONSTER<br />
FOR PRESS SEPTEM4BER 19, 1976<br />
TEXT OF ADDRESS GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER AT THE LIBERAL<br />
PARTY FEDERAL COUNCIL<br />
This morning's meeting of Federal Council provides me with<br />
the opportunity to express publicly on my own behalf, and<br />
on behalf of the whole Parliamentary Liberal Party my thanks<br />
for your work of the last year.<br />
There has never been a period in the whole history of our<br />
Party so fraught with difficulty or crowned with so magnificent<br />
a victory.<br />
Almost a year ago, on that Sunday morning iin October when<br />
Federal Council last met, I am sure we all felt that the future<br />
of Australia was in the balance.<br />
At that critical time, and in the weeks that followed only one<br />
fact stood betw., een the survival and recovery of our country and<br />
its continued slide into the abyss created by the Labor Party's<br />
ideology and fLolly, breach of law and of-convention.<br />
That fa, c t was the determination, the unity, and the quality of<br />
the Liberal Party in Parliament and in the organisation.<br />
The Party Sir Robert Menzies founded more than three decades<br />
ago rose to its greatest challenge and triumphed.<br />
We all know how very different Australia would be today, and<br />
how very different its future, if there had been no united<br />
Liberal Party, no Party committed to the ideals of Liberalism<br />
in that critical hour. At that epic moment Liberals throughout<br />
Australia stood their ground.<br />
We achieved unity, we earned victory, because we had made<br />
Opposition, in the words of Sir Robert Menzies, " a great<br />
constructive period" for the Party.<br />
We knew that we had a programme which expressed our philosophy<br />
and which met the needs of Australia.<br />
We knew that we had an organization which had never been stronger<br />
and never better prepared to fight an election campaign. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
Those are facts which should not be passing phases in the history<br />
of a Party. Developing the Party's programme and securing its<br />
organisational strength must be constant endeavours if we are<br />
to fulfill our responsibilities to the Australian people.<br />
I am pleased to say that since the Federal Election last<br />
December the Party organization has continued its active and<br />
positive role.<br />
Today we have 30,000 more members than a year ago.<br />
The organizational Committees have been strenthened. They are<br />
a valued source of support and advice.<br />
The Secretariat under Tony Eggleton has a vital role in<br />
providing support for the Parliamentary Party and the Party<br />
Organization around Australia.<br />
It services the very valuable backbench committees through its<br />
day to day contacts with the Parliamentary Party the Secretariat<br />
has become a valuable channel for communication between the<br />
Parliamentary Party and the Organization.<br />
I believe that we need to be alert to opportunities for<br />
consultation and co-operation between the organization and the<br />
Parliamentary Party.<br />
I have requested the Joint Standing Committee on Federal<br />
Policy to undertake a programme of meetings in the next few<br />
months with the object of reviewing specific policy areas.<br />
I would now like to look more closely at the significance of<br />
last year's federal election for the future of Australia,<br />
and f: or the futcure course of policy under this Government.<br />
The election last year marked a turning point in Australian<br />
histor1y. The A'ustraLan people chose one approach to building Australia<br />
and rejected another.<br />
In rejecting the Labor Party. Australians rejected Labor's<br />
vision of a society dominated by a powerful few. a society<br />
of high taxes which minimized freedom and maximized direction<br />
over people's lives, a society in which all were to be expected<br />
to confor-nn to the narrow conceptions of the labor leadership,<br />
a society in which the nation's whole educational system was<br />
to be dom,. inated from the centre, where enterprise could move<br />
only with the permi-ssion of the nation's political masters,<br />
where the bureaucracy absorbed more and more of the nation's<br />
workforce as it sought to regulate more and more of the nation's<br />
life, where the government actually sought to persuade people<br />
of the benefits of dependence on government in every aspect of<br />
life, where the poor and disadvantaged were offered words and promis.<br />
great reforms but where the words were empty and the promises<br />
unfulfilled. The Liberal Party's approach on the other hand held out an<br />
exciting prospect of a free and compassionate society growing in<br />
prosperity and able to meet the challenges of social and<br />
technological change. / 3 </p>
<p>In this society government would work in partnership with the<br />
whole community.<br />
Our task is to establish the circumstances in which people<br />
can make their own decision in which the main driving force<br />
is the enormous energy of the Australian people.<br />
The Liberal Party's vision is of an Australia where men and<br />
women can dream and work to realise their dreams not a world<br />
where a few with delusions of grandeur impose their private<br />
view on everyone.<br />
Our view is of a boisterous, argumentative, alert and tolerant<br />
society. Of a people experienced in bearing responsibility,<br />
equipped with the skills and the institutions to cope with<br />
technological change, determined to defend their independence<br />
but open and compassionate towards the rest of the world.<br />
Of an Australia in which the disadvantaged have genuine opportunity,<br />
and in which Government assistance recognises the equal right to<br />
choice and opportunity of those in genuine need.<br />
It is a vision of an Australia where Government is democratic,<br />
accessible and responsive and where power is decentralised and<br />
decisions taken as closely as possible to those affected.<br />
An Australian where a vigorous enterprise can express itself and<br />
contribute to the life of everyone.-where people seek to enjoy<br />
and live in harmony with the natural world of which they are<br />
an essential part.<br />
In the last year we have worked to give reality to that vision.<br />
Inevitably we have given first priority to the most disastrous<br />
legacies of Labor inflation and unemployment.<br />
Before the election last year we developed a detailed strategy<br />
to get Australia moving forward again.<br />
That strategy involved: bringing Government spending under<br />
control; providing major assistance to private enterprise to<br />
expand job opportunities; introducing tax reforms and procedures<br />
of consultation to encourage wage restraint; and encouraging<br />
national recognition of the common interests we all have in<br />
controlling inflation.<br />
That strategy was and is the right strategy.<br />
We have adhered to it consistently since the election last year.<br />
The economy is now recovering.<br />
It is going to be a long haul but there is every indication<br />
that the strategy is working.<br />
There have been inevitable costs, but these costs are much<br />
less than those that would have suffered uinder Labor's mad<br />
extravagance. There is still room for a wider appreciation of the fact that<br />
in recent years the Labor Party encouraged expectations to<br />
run beyond resources. / 14 </p>
<p>Labor's view that a government can go on spending and spending<br />
is still held by some.<br />
This was reflected in one comment made on the budget that it<br />
was an economic rather than a social document that it was<br />
concerned with figures rather than people.<br />
This is fundamentally wrong. There is, and can be, no divorce<br />
of economic and social objectives.<br />
A desire for social reform without regard to economic reality<br />
led to the tragedy of the Labor years.<br />
The failure of economic policy leads inevitably to the failure<br />
of crucial aspects of social policy.<br />
A better Australia cannot be built on declining production and<br />
failing industry.<br />
Opportunities cannot be expanded when confidence is undermined<br />
and initiative and enterprise are penalised.<br />
The poor and the weaker sections of the community cannot be<br />
protected under economic conditions in which only the well-to-do<br />
and powerful would have any chance of protecting themselves.<br />
The young cannot achieve a better life when economic policies<br />
cripple private enterprise, destroy jobs, and put home ownership<br />
out of reach.<br />
Our great social objectives expansion of opportunities,<br />
assistance to those in need, protection of the environment<br />
cann-t be adecuately achieved when national production is falling<br />
rath~ er tflan rising.<br />
We are-determ-ined to eradicate inflation and restore job<br />
oppo-r ultie<br />
That is the pr incipal purpose of the budget.<br />
That is why the budget is a document of major social importa nce.<br />
Only on the basis of a responsible economic policy do expressions<br />
of concern become more than empty words.<br />
The g~ overnment'is particularly concerned with the level of<br />
unemployment. The strategy we are pursuing aims at a gradual and sound recovery.<br />
It is designed to achieve a reduction in unemployment by mid 1977<br />
and it offers the best hope for a soundly-based longer-term<br />
expansion of job opportunities.<br />
In the immediate future our particular concern will naturally<br />
be with the school leavers.<br />
The vast majority of last year's school leavers have now found<br />
jobs. But at the end of July there were still 12,7000 of last<br />
year's school leavers still unemployed. </p>
<p>One problem here is making sure that job opportunities which<br />
do exist are brought to the attention of those looking for work.<br />
Clearly there have been problems with this cause of unemployment<br />
in the past.<br />
In an effort to minimize this problem we are instituting an<br />
inquiry into the Commonwealth Employment Service to see what<br />
can be done to improve recruitment processes; we have also<br />
introduced a significant relocation scheme.<br />
For the remainder of my time today I would like to discuss some mediun<br />
and longer term problems which face Australia problems to which<br />
the Liberal Party in particular must address itself.<br />
In moving towards the kind of Australia we all want certain<br />
priorities stand out: one is taxation reform.<br />
The drift towards an ever larger role for Government in allocating<br />
resources a drift which was not just a product of the Labor<br />
years has produced a tax system in which levels are too high,<br />
which contains many inequities, and which undermines incentive.<br />
This year we have given unmistakable evidence of our determination<br />
to introduce tax reforms both for individuals and companies.<br />
For companies we have made a start on trading stock valuation<br />
adjustments and have undertaken to allow not less than 50%~ of<br />
the full adjustment as deductions from this year's income.<br />
We have also increased the retention allowance for private<br />
companies.<br />
We have already put an end to the impact of inflation on<br />
personal tax levels, through the introduction of full personal<br />
income tax indexation.<br />
This reform will put a stop to unlegislated increases in the<br />
personal tax b'urden.<br />
It will have a major role in restraining the growth of Government.<br />
Its benefits will be very obvious in future years.<br />
But it is only the first step.<br />
In the medium and longer term our objective is a personal tax<br />
system which permits individuals to retain a larger proportion<br />
of their earnings so they can have greater independence in<br />
meeting their own needs according to their own values.<br />
We want a tax system which rewards initiative and contains<br />
incentives to responsible independent action.<br />
A government whose philosophy is based on respect for the<br />
individual, in present circumstances must have tax reform<br />
as an important priority.<br />
Alongside the tax system our philosophy demands that we look<br />
very closely at the scope, structure and efficiency of the<br />
government sector.<br />
The problems here are obvious: a vast expansion in the size of<br />
government . a piecemeal accumulation of functions, a growing<br />
intrusiveness of government into the lives of individuals, a<br />
growing concentration of power in the Federal Government ./ 6 </p>
<p>In our conception of Government the public sector ought to be<br />
a lean and efficient instrument of policy, and provide a<br />
responsive administration which as far a3 possible expands the<br />
capacities of other institutions and individuals.<br />
This year we have firmly set the course by: reducing the size<br />
of the federal Public Service,-which will be carried further<br />
through this year, by commencing a major decentralisation of*<br />
government power and function through our federalism reforms.<br />
All the essential principles of the federalism policy have been<br />
agreed upon with the states, and its implementation is now well<br />
under way.<br />
We have also taken a number of significant steps to strengthen<br />
the individual citizen in relation to the bureaucracy.<br />
We have expanded the machinery available to individuals to<br />
assert their rights through an Administrative Appeals Tribunal<br />
and introducing legislation for a Federal Ombudsman.<br />
The Law Reform Commission has been asked to examine and report<br />
on unwarranted invasions of privacy in areas under the control of<br />
the Commonwealth Parliament. For example, invasions arising<br />
from information collected, recorded, or stored by the Commonwealth<br />
Government Departments, authorities and corporations.<br />
We will also be legislating in the area of freedom of information.<br />
Given our general approach, active review of the Government<br />
sector will be a continuing concern of this Government.<br />
Wie have recently received the report of the Royal Commission<br />
on Australian Government Administration. It will receive<br />
very close attention.<br />
The Liberal Party's concern for reform in the Government sector<br />
should not, of course, be confined to the Federal Government.<br />
In recent years a number of the state administrations have grown<br />
just as rapidly as the Commonwealth Public Service and there has<br />
been a major expansion of state spending and state activity.<br />
Alongside taxation policy and review of the Government sector,<br />
there is a third area where the Government's long term objectives<br />
will require further action. That area is the market of free<br />
enterprise sector of Australian society.<br />
If a country is to provide real recogiition of the right of<br />
people to freedom and self-respect, the vast number of goods<br />
and services produced by private enterprise, by individuals,<br />
must be made available as far as possible through voluntary<br />
market processes.<br />
A properly functioning market system does not just happen.<br />
In a modern industrial economy governments have a vital role<br />
in establishing standards of fair and proper conduct.<br />
Properly conceived and functioning laws do not restrict but<br />
expand freedom. They prevent the powerful from trampling on the<br />
weak. They stop exploitation, and facilitate enterprise and effecti<br />
choice, </p>
<p>7.<br />
That is why efficient action against restrictive trade practices<br />
is so important and why we have recently reviewed the operation<br />
of the restrictive practices legislation.<br />
I notice that the report of the Trade Practices Inquiry recommended<br />
that there should be legislation to cover restrictive practices<br />
by trade unions as well as business concerns.<br />
The activities of some trade union leaders can inhibit the<br />
freedom of workers and the chance of workers realising their<br />
interests just as the activities of some large corporations<br />
can inhibit smaller businesses in their legitimate activities.<br />
That is why we have introduced secret ballot legislation.<br />
That is why that legislation is now in operation.<br />
There is continuing azncern by the Government with the whole<br />
network of legal rules governing the functioning of the market<br />
sector.<br />
We want rules that fairly expand the area of freedom, not rules<br />
merely for the sake of rules from which there is no real public<br />
benefit. A properly functioning market system is an unparalleled instrument<br />
for control and influence over the productive process by the people.<br />
It not only produces the most efficient allocation of resources, but<br />
the most rational decisions about the use of resources.<br />
It not only produces the greatest scope for enterprise and<br />
harnesses it -for the benefit of the community.<br />
It exoresses better than any single set of Government decisions<br />
could hope to do the pattern of community preferences.<br />
In such a system it is the people who decide what activities<br />
shall orosper and what enerprises shall profit, through their<br />
choices of products and services.<br />
It provides workers with choice of employer, choice of job, as<br />
well as choice of product and service.<br />
The free enterprise market system described in this way is,<br />
of course, an ideal.<br />
One of the great challenges we face as a Party in giving<br />
reality to our philosophy is constantly to improve the operation<br />
of the market economy, and improve the capacity of all our<br />
citizens to reap its benefits.<br />
We have been too modest for too long about its benefits for all<br />
our people.<br />
It is because of the benefits of this system to individuals that<br />
there is growing interest in extending its role in the area of<br />
social securi ty.<br />
The Liberal Party's belief in freedom is an expression of our<br />
commitment to human dignity and to the value of each person.<br />
That same commitment must also make us initiators in the field<br />
of social security. .1/ 8 </p>
<p>Our approach in this area is quite different to that of the<br />
Labor Party.<br />
The Labor Party aims towards a system of universal services<br />
administered by a centralised Government monopoly, and systems<br />
of benefits which can only be funded by ever higher taxation.<br />
It is an approach which in the end makes everybody dependent<br />
on what Government chooses to provide.<br />
The approach underlying the Henderson Report on Poverty was<br />
very similar to ours. The Report stated that: " An adequate<br />
income allows ( a person) freedom of choice and freedom to<br />
participate in activities of his choice. It contributes<br />
greatly to personal freedom and the extent of opportunities<br />
available."<br />
We have now initiated a significant experiment in accordance<br />
with this philosophy in the welfare housing area.<br />
The Treasurer announced in the budget that we had decided to<br />
undertake a housing allowance voucher experiment. " Should<br />
the experiment prove successful, implementation of such a<br />
programme would give low income families the financial<br />
means to select their own rental accommodation on the open<br />
market". Our family allowance scheme, which will give significant help<br />
to 300,000 low income families with 800,000 children, and will<br />
lift many families above the poverty line, underscores our belief<br />
in the contribution an adequate income can make to human dignity<br />
by providing choice and expanding opportunity.<br />
Beyond the area of social welfare it is a basic responsibility<br />
of a Li"-' beral Government to expand the capacity of all Australians<br />
to choose effectively.<br />
We esta-;" blshed a Department of Business and Consumer Affairs<br />
because these issues are so closely linked.<br />
Improv-ing the capacity of consumers to express their wishes<br />
effectively, will be a continuing concern of this Government.<br />
In the area of consumer protection, we are presently considering<br />
recomm-aendat-ions of the Committee of Inquiry into the Trade<br />
Practices Legislation.<br />
Consumer protection is an integral part of a properly functioning<br />
market system.<br />
In reaping the benefits of freedom a great contribution must<br />
be made by our schools, colleges, universities and other<br />
educational institutions.<br />
A society based on freedom is inevitably one of change sometimes<br />
very rapid change. Technology is developing rapidly. Our<br />
freedom enables us to utilise the power of science most effectively.<br />
Concepts of education are changing. There is a vigorous debate<br />
on the purpose of education and its appropriate function in our<br />
society. Our educational system must adapt to the needs of people for job<br />
mobility, for retraining. it must be appropriate to the needs of<br />
n~ nnip in the exhilarating new age we are entering. </p>
<p>As evidence of the importance we place on education, in the<br />
recent budget education was one of the very few areas to<br />
receive a real increase in funds. We also restored triennial<br />
funding. The Government is also, however, acutely aware that there is<br />
a widespread concern about the functioning of our schools and<br />
post-secondary institutions.<br />
We have taken the view that an examination of education is now<br />
required. Accordingly, I announced the decision of the Government last<br />
week to establish the most important inquiry into post-secondary<br />
education since the Martin Inquiry over a decade ago.<br />
Having particular regard to current circumstances this Inquiry<br />
will also examine the broader issue of the relationship between<br />
education and employment.<br />
Education needs to equip a person for a satisfying and rewarding<br />
life. One fact of the greatest importance in achieving this<br />
objective is satisfying and rewarding work.<br />
This Inquiry will provide a perspective on educational planning<br />
up to the year 2000.<br />
The Committee of Inquiry is being directed to have particular<br />
regard for the Government's objectives of: widening educational<br />
opportunity; expanding educational and occupational choice;<br />
developing quality and excellence in all spheres of education,<br />
and encouragirg community participation in education and training<br />
mater7 Educi-ion is not only concerned with imparting technical skills.<br />
It rnees also to impart a quality of judgement. The great<br />
challenge -o educators is to combine the teaching of skills<br />
with inat broader understanding.<br />
The vi-ew that the best education need not be relevant, even on a<br />
broad definition of relevance, condemns us to failure in our<br />
efforts to cope with a fast changing world.<br />
Our enjoyment of freedom will depend greatly on the quality<br />
of our educational system and the values our educators impart.<br />
Unless our schools and universities, alongside the family, teach<br />
tolerance, a sense of personal responsibility, a respect for<br />
others and for their freedoms, and above all a maturity of<br />
judgement and rejection of dogmatism, it is certain that the<br />
great ideal of a society based on freedom and human dignity will<br />
remain finally beyord our reach.<br />
Education, and the appropriate pattern of the educational system,<br />
will, i. hatever our views, be one of the major issues facing the<br />
Australian people for the foreseeable future.<br />
As a Party which is truly Liberal truly dedicated to fostering the<br />
conditions in which a satisfying life is available to everyone we<br />
must be prepared to work with all our energies to achieve this goal. </p>
<p>It is the Labor Party that needs to be fearful of change, not us.<br />
The spirit of the age is rejecting the conformist, tightlyregulated,<br />
bureaucratically dominated society that is the<br />
inevitable product of Labor's approach. People will less and<br />
less tolerate the coerced subordination of the many to the few<br />
that is inherent in the Labor ethos.<br />
This year we have seized the initiative.<br />
For the first time in many years the full life and meaning of<br />
our approach to Government have found expression in a series<br />
of major reforms which will make Australia a more vital, dynamic,<br />
compassionate and above all freer society.<br />
For too long we have accepted as inevitable the growing dominatio,-<br />
of the few at the centre. We have seen all the western democracic<br />
moving in this direction.<br />
Higher taxes, bigger government, more centralised government,<br />
more and more regulation, a growing dependence of everyone<br />
on the state these seemed the inevitable and universal trend.<br />
They were eroding not merely our freedoms but our sense of<br />
ourselves of what made the democracies distinctive from the<br />
bureaucratic socialist societies of eastern Europe and the<br />
. Soviet Union.<br />
Many were questioning whether the democracies still had anything<br />
distinctive to offer.<br />
In Aus-ralia three years of socialism have brought a fundamental<br />
cha-e to our thinking.<br />
But i all the western democracies people are once more raising<br />
fund-a~ an. l questions about the role of Government-and the direct<br />
of c-ar-e in America, in Europe, in Britain.<br />
Once before Australia led the world in democratic and social<br />
refor.<br />
. We are doing so again.<br />
In Governm-ent we have embarked on an historic devolution of<br />
power to the states and local councils. We have put an end<br />
to the increase'in the burden of personal taxes, resulting.<br />
from inflation. We have strengthened the position of the<br />
individual in relation to the bureaucracy. We have reversed<br />
the trend towards bigger and bigger Government at the federal<br />
level. </p>
<p>11.<br />
yn th: economy we have begun a series of major reforms to<br />
*.: otect companies against inflation. We have restored<br />
incentives for the exploration and development of our vast<br />
mineral resources. We are introducing an income equalisation<br />
m! e for rural industry. We have got the economy moving<br />
ag.. ai. We are introducing a range of measures to alleviate<br />
unemployment in the short term.<br />
In the industrial area we have made secret postal ballots<br />
mandatory in all elections for office bearers.<br />
In social welfare we have introduced the historic family<br />
allowances scheme to lift many families out of poverty.<br />
We have initiated the imaginative housing voucher allowance<br />
scheme. We have argued in the Arbitration Commission to<br />
protect those on lowest income.<br />
For the aged we will be protecting the real value of pensions<br />
by automatic adjustments. We have a substantial programme<br />
to secure homes for the aged.<br />
We have greatly increased assistance for handicapped persons.<br />
We have established a major new home savings grant scheme.<br />
We have increased real spending on education, and we announced<br />
the most far reaching enquiry into education since the mid<br />
sixties.<br />
The Liberal Party of Australia has shown in the last year that<br />
a colta change of direction that new hope is possible<br />
if t-he iI and commitment are there.<br />
There iS -ill a long way to go.<br />
Today -1 ' utlined some of the things we have already done<br />
and some paths for the future.<br />
Many issues and problems remain to be resolved if we are to<br />
move a,-rCs an Australia which is both freer and more humane.<br />
New w~; ys of looking at problems will be needed.<br />
An il-si-tive use of new technology will be required.<br />
F da. en t2 values of decent human relations will have to be<br />
a:.; erta d more strongly than ever before.<br />
We need to assert the values of moderation in political debate<br />
make ambiguous our disgust at tactics of intimidation and<br />
violence. We need to set an example of reason, of rationality in our<br />
approach to issues.<br />
The younger members of our. Party will have a crucial role in<br />
working through the problems and demands of this new age in lending<br />
their energies and their voices to ideals still far from being<br />
fully realised.<br />
The next year, and the one after it, are going to require great<br />
steadiness. / 12 </p>
<p>It will be a long haul to repair the ravages of the last<br />
three years of Labor.<br />
Many things we would like to do will not be possible in the<br />
short term.<br />
We will not cease in our determination to give voice and<br />
expression to the hopes of Australians.<br />
SIn future years people will say this was the time when<br />
Australia turned away from centralised, domineering, inefficient<br />
Government towards a better and freer society.<br />
I This was the time when a new perspective on Australia's future<br />
opened up. When new possibilities for change and reform were<br />
I seen. When the Liberal Party re-affirmed the vitality of its<br />
i philosophy and approach to Government.<br />
I. This was the time when our faith in the possibilities of<br />
freedom and democracy began to be renewed.<br />
