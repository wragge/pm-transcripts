THE 1996 SIR ROBERT MENZIES LECTUJRE<br />
THE LIBERAL TRADITION<br />
The Beliefs and Values Which Guide the Federal Government<br />
E&amp; OE CHECK AGAINST DELIVYERY<br />
We honour tonight the memory of Sir Robert Menzies as a great Australian leader and<br />
as the founder of modern Australian Liberalism-We recall the achievements of the<br />
national governments that he led, as well as the values that were the driving force<br />
behind them.<br />
But our purpose tonight is also a much broader one: one that is focussed squarely on<br />
the challenges of Australia's future, and on the central role of Liberal values and ideals<br />
in ensuring that they are met successfUlly.<br />
Menzies himself always had such a focus-He forged modemn Australian Liberalism not<br />
as a fixed ideology but as a political philosophy with values that need to be related to<br />
the great issues of the day, and of the future.<br />
Australian Liberalism has always been evolving and developing. It always will be. We<br />
are constantly relating Liberalism's enduring values to the circumstances of our own<br />
time enduring values such as the commitment to enhance freedom, choice and<br />
competition, to encourage personal achievement, and to promote fairness and a<br />
genuine sense of community in Australian society.<br />
In reflecting on Menzies' contribution to Australian life, therefore, we do not yearn for<br />
some lost golden age. Our aim is not to re-create the circumstances and public policy<br />
priorities of his time. That is clearly neither possible nor desirable.<br />
Australia today is very different to the Australia of the Menzies era. </p>
<p>Fax f o 19/ 11/ 96 09: 55 Pg: 2<br />
Our society is more diverse and better for that fact. Our social structures have<br />
changed significantly and will continue to do so. Our interaction with other countries<br />
is more pervasive making our perspectives wider and our opportunities for growth<br />
more abundant.<br />
Political and economic realities are also fundamentally different to those of the Menzies<br />
era. Many traditional political constituencies have been ' de-tribalied', with older<br />
instinctive loyalties giving way to less predictable patterns of party support. Our<br />
national economy is confronting the challenges of what will be the decisive forces of<br />
economic change into the next century namely, globalisation, technological change<br />
and the communications revolution.<br />
So much of the Australia of the Menzies era has passed into history. But we should be<br />
under no illusions about the importance of putting the achievements of Menzies into<br />
their proper historical perspective.<br />
The Menzies era has long been seen as a critically important target by the opponents of<br />
the Liberal inheritance in Australia. In their view, if the stature of Menzies could be<br />
demeaned and if the achievements of his long period in government diminished, then<br />
their own partisan political cause would be advanced.<br />
A year or two ago, we witnessed one of the high-water marks in the attempt to rewrite<br />
important parts of Australia's political history. It came in the form of a<br />
sustained, personalised and vindictive assault on the Menzies legacy orchestrated from<br />
the highest levels of the then national government.<br />
It was an assault without substance, without honour and without success.<br />
It failed because it was seen by the vast majority of Australians for the divisive,<br />
irrelevant and prejudiced attack that it was.<br />
It failed because it aimed to establish a form of historical correctness as a particular<br />
offshoot of political correctness.<br />
it failed because it aimed to set Australian against Australian, implying that those who<br />
did not share the then officially-endorsed view of the Menzies era were somehow<br />
lesser Australians and less patriotic than those who did.<br />
Above all, it failed because the facts of history simply did not sustain it.<br />
Our political opponents tried to convince Australians that the Menzies era created an<br />
' industrial museum' and that it was notable only for an economnic torpor and<br />
international isolation.<br />
They failed in that attempt because they could not re-write the facts. And the facts are<br />
that the Menzies era not only provided Australia with the strongest, sustained period of<br />
economnic growth in our history but also re-oriented Australian foreign policy towards<br />
a greater involvement in the Asia-Pacific region, </p>
<p>Fax from 19/ 11/ 96 09: 55 Pg: 3<br />
3<br />
Whether measured in terms of interest rates, employment, prices, national savings,<br />
current account deficits, net foreign liabilities, marginal tax rates on average income, or<br />
other standards of measurement, the fact is that the record of the Menzies<br />
Governments in the late 1950s and early 1960s was far more impressive than the<br />
record of its Labor critics when they were in office in the late 1980s and early 1990s.<br />
Yet, those of us who uphold the memory of Sir Robert Menzies for who he was, and<br />
for what he achieved for Australia, must not be simply reactive in defending his place<br />
in history. We must not sit back and be galvanised into action only when unjustified<br />
denigrations are made.<br />
In relating the values of Liberalism to the challenges of Australia's future, we need to<br />
recognise more explicitly the importance of our history.<br />
Our history must never become a refuge from the present. Nor should it ever become<br />
simply a pretext for smug self-congratulation, for wallowing in nostalgia or for viewing<br />
the past through rose-tinted glasses.<br />
But the heritage of Australian Liberalism is an important part of the broader history of<br />
Australia, and in my view we have been guilty in the past of not giving sufficient<br />
weight to its relevance.<br />
it is from the history of our political tradition that we can build on acquired wisdom. It<br />
is from our history that we learn for the future from the lessons of past practical<br />
experience. It is from our history that we can understand the scale of what our<br />
predecessors achieved. And it is from our history that the elements of both continuity<br />
and evolution in our political philosophy become apparent.<br />
We must never allow a vacuum to develop in which the history of Australian<br />
Liberalism is left to be interpreted by those who are opposed to the values that inspired<br />
it. The attempted re-writing of Australian political history over recent years by our<br />
political opponents should not be countered by an equA1y politicised re-writing to<br />
redress the balance.<br />
What is needed is a sense of balance, objectivity and honesty in drawing lessons from<br />
our past.<br />
Australian history is not some neat political fable in which the only national icons are<br />
people who share a particular political faith and in which the believers in other faiths<br />
are no more than peripheral players.<br />
Reassessing the achievements and shortcomings of our history should not become part<br />
of some broader process of ritualistic political eye-gouging.<br />
Australians deserve and are now getting the restoration of civility in public life.<br />
Where there are genuine differences of view, they need to be debated directly and<br />
robustly, but not in a personally abusive way. </p>

Nor does our political system benefit from instinctive political ' oppositionism'. Where<br />
there is broad agreement I believe that nothing is lost by recognising that fact.<br />
These principles need to be applied particularly when assessments are being made of<br />
Australia's political history.<br />
The facts of that history need to be interpreted on their own merits, and not with a predetermined<br />
outcome in mind nor in some kind of divisive and judgmental way that uses<br />
modern values and standards as the benchmarks for adequacy.<br />
Glib and sweeping generalisations too often become easy substitutes for measured and<br />
factual historical judgments.<br />
We should never accept, for example, the often quoted but factually incorrect<br />
depiction of Labor as the party of ' initiative' and ' non-Labor' as the agents of<br />
' resistance' in Australian history. Nor should we accept the historical portrayal of<br />
Labor as the ' enlargers' of Australian life, and the political opponents of Labor as mere<br />
4straighteners'.<br />
We should contest and dispute these mythologies for the simple reason that the facts of<br />
history do not sustain them.<br />
In doing so, of course, we should make no claim that the Liberal political tradition has<br />
had a monopoly on wisdom and good judgement over the past half century in<br />
Australia. With the benefit of hindsight there were, of course, some priorities which<br />
could have been pursued more vigorously and there were injustices in society that<br />
could have been remedied earlier.<br />
Hindsight always has that advantage. But the temptation must always be resisted to<br />
read history backwards that is, to impose on the past contemporary standards and<br />
priorities. The fact is that the Menzies era provided good government Qf integrity, high<br />
achievement: and strong leadership which Australians returned to office again and again<br />
because it was attuned to the aspirations of the great mainstream of Australian society,<br />
because it delivered on what it promised and, it is true, because of the internal<br />
divisions within the ranks of its political opponents.<br />
The achievements of the Menzies era laid the groundwork for the achievements of the<br />
Liberal political tradition more generally. And we need to ensure that those<br />
achievements are properly recognised as our political history is re-interpreted by a new<br />
generation of Australians.<br />
The Liberal political tradition has made a decisive contribution to nation-building in<br />
Australia.<br />
It has been the Liberal political tradition which has overseen the periods of greatest<br />
sustained economic growth in our history and which, through policies in support of </p>
<p>Fax fromt 19/ 11/ 96 09: 55 Pg:<br />
free enterprise, laid the foundations for Australia's modem manufacturing, agricultural<br />
and industrial development.<br />
It is our political tradition which facilitated the establishment of a modem national<br />
economic infrastructure,<br />
It is our tradition which has championed not only the rights of small business but<br />
opportunities in general for individuals to work hard and to achieve for themselves and<br />
their famnilies.<br />
it is our tradition which dramatically expanded educational opportunities for all<br />
Australians and which, through the decision over 30 years ago to provide direct<br />
government assistance to independent schools, ended many of the deep sectarian<br />
divisions and bitterness which had afflicted Australian society for wnore than a century.<br />
It is our tradition which opened up regional co-operation through economic initiatives<br />
beginning with the 1957 Australia-Japan Trade Treaty, through educational initiatives<br />
beginning with the Colombo Plan and through immigration reforms such as the ending<br />
of the White Australia Policy.<br />
It is our tradition which provided one of the world's most generous and compassionate<br />
responses to the Indo-Chinese refugee crisis of the late 1 970s and 1 980s.<br />
it is our tradition which expanded Australia's own defence capabilities and<br />
underpinned them with the negotiation of the ANZUS alliance.<br />
It is our tradition which oversaw the great surge of post-war migration to Australia<br />
and laid the foundations of our modern Australian society drawn from the four corners<br />
of the earth and united together by a common set of Australian values.<br />
It is our tradition which has had a ' fair go' for all as one of its driving forces and which<br />
has strengthened the social security safety net through such advancements in social<br />
policy as the extension of child endowment, pensioner medical services, health<br />
services, pharmaceutical benefits, housing, invalid and other pensions, mental health<br />
care, family allowances, and many other initiatives.<br />
It is our tradition which has led and won, the great debate of ideas over issues such as<br />
greater choice and security for Australian families, industrial relations reform, financial<br />
deregulation and privatisation.<br />
it is our tradition which oversaw the extension of the full rights of citizenship to<br />
Aboriginal Australians.<br />
it is our tradition which has made an historic contribution in so many other policy areas<br />
such as regional development, technology, environmental protection, child care and the<br />
growth of new industries such as tourism.<br />
And it is our tradition with our emphases on incentives for achievement deregulation<br />
and competition which is best suited to the demands of our economic fu~ ture: a future </p>

in which economtic enterprise will become more decentralised, in which small<br />
businesses will be even more important as generators of jobs and national wealth, and<br />
in which technology will change patterns of work and diversify the options for<br />
achieving growth.<br />
So much for hollow generalisations about parties of initiative and resistance in<br />
Australian history and in Australia's future.<br />
The personality of Sir Robert Menzies, and the achievements of his governments, lay at<br />
the centre of many of the historical achievements of the Liberal tradition to which I<br />
have referred.<br />
Tonight, however, is not the occasion for a detailed recitation of all of them. But I<br />
would like to take the opportunity to reflect in a personal way on what I see as the<br />
enduring legacy of Menzies' contribution to public life in Australia.<br />
Menzies, above all, was a great Australian nation-builder in the true sense of the word.<br />
He understood better than any political leader of his generation the nation-building<br />
capacities of private enterprise and a strategic but limited role for government.<br />
That is clearly evident in the record of his achievements in government in areas as<br />
diverse as national development, economic growth, trade and foreign policy, science<br />
and education, and the arts.<br />
It was his essential Australianness that underpinned his unequalled period of<br />
domninance in Australian political life.<br />
One of the most perverse myths about Menzies was his alleged subservience to Britain,<br />
and subsequently America. Like most Australians of his time, Menzies did have a<br />
special admiration for the English inheritance of the rule of law, democratic<br />
constitutionalism and personal liberty. But that did not make him any lesser Australian<br />
in fact, it made him a more robust one as he applied that unique inheritance to<br />
Australia's own national circumstances.<br />
Menzies fiercely attacked British indifference to Australian interests whether it was in<br />
strategic policy ( as in the Second World War), in trade policy or in any other aspect.<br />
For example, in the 1930s Menzies was a consistent opponent of British governments<br />
over their application of the 1932 Ottawa Agreement. He argued that the need for<br />
Australia to develop its own manufacturing base demanded greater understanding than<br />
Britain was prepared to extend.<br />
Furthermore, immediately after the Australian declaration of war in 1939, Menzies<br />
resisted British pressure to commit Australian forces immediately to Europe. He<br />
argued that the situation in 1939 was not the same as 1914. He agreed to send<br />
Australian forces to Europe only after he had an assessment of Japan's likely intentions<br />
and after he had insisted on, and received, a reassurance from Britain on its<br />
commitment to send a fleet to Singapore if Japan did move south. 19/ 11/ 96 09: S5 Pg: 6 </p>

Menzies' intense Australianness was highlighted in the political relationship he had<br />
with the Australian people. He articulated the hopes and concerns of the Australians<br />
of his time more effectively, more representatively and for a longer period than any<br />
other national leader.<br />
Menzies' political genius lay in that basic affinity with the aspirations of the Australian<br />
people. He understood the priority they placed on jobs, on rising living standards, on<br />
home ownership, on high economic growth, on a sense of national unity, and on<br />
opportunities for their children that were greater than they themselves had ex'perienced.<br />
And he developed priorities in national policymnaking and a role for national<br />
government that enabled those aspirations to be achieved.<br />
Menzies had his finger on the pulse of the Australian nation in a way that few other<br />
leaders have matched and none have surpassed. But the quality of his political<br />
leadership did not lie in perceiving or anticipating every shift in public opinion. He<br />
responded to public opirnion, but he also shaped it. He respected it, but he also guided<br />
it. He knew the difference between short-term public opinion and long-term public<br />
interest. Another aspect which I see as central in Menzies' enduring legacy is, of course, his<br />
role as the Founding Father of modem Australian Liberalism.<br />
Menzies' knew the importance for Australian Liberalism to draw on both the classical<br />
liberal as well as the conservative political traditions. He knew the importance for<br />
Liberalism of upholding people's fights and freedoms as individuals. He also knew the<br />
imnportance of values and priorities that had both a proven record of past achievement<br />
and a relevance to advancing Australia's national interests into the future.<br />
He opposed change for the sake of change, just as he opposed blind adherence to<br />
outmoded and ineffective practices that no longer served the national interest. He was<br />
a traditionalist in that he respected the wisdom that is shaped by experience. But<br />
where he was convinced of the need for change, he became its powerful advocate.<br />
This was clearly evident in the changing emphases of Menzies foreign policy with his<br />
awareness of the importance of the Asia-Pacific region in Australia's future and his<br />
creation of the framework for greater interaction with it.<br />
It was also evident in a range of his social and economic policies, and none more so<br />
than the new directions he charted for secondary and tertiary education.<br />
Menzies' practical approach to policy issues reflected the dualism in Liberalism's<br />
political philosophy. He believed in a liberal politcal tradition that encompassed both<br />
Edmund Burke and John Stuart Mill a tradition which I have described in<br />
contemporary termis as the broad church of Australian Liberalism.<br />
Pant of Menzies' legacy, therefore, is that Liberalism has developed political values<br />
that are neither ideological, on the one hand, nor mere bellwethers of every changing<br />
circumstance, on the other. </p>
<p>Fax Fo 19/ 11/ 96 89: 55 Pg: 8<br />

Menzies valued a broad-based political philosophy because he knew that it was fr~ om<br />
such a philosophy that Liberalism derived its enduring values values such as<br />
individual freedom, choice, diversity, opportunity, and the importance of strong<br />
families and communities as bulwarks against the intrusive power of the State.<br />
That is why the modern Liberal Party has never been a party of privilege or sectional<br />
interests or narrow prejudice.<br />
Menzies always championed individual freedom and spirit over collective action based<br />
on a corporate state, and he did so not to promote narrow and selfish outcomes but for<br />
the purposes of enabling every Australian to fulfil their hopes and aspirations.<br />
Liberalism has always pursued those purposes, and it will continue to do so.<br />
Another aspect of Menzies' legacy is that Liberalism has focussed on national interests<br />
rather than sectional interests.<br />
Menzies knew that a broad-based political philosophy is a necessary filter for the<br />
narrow aspirations of individual lobby groups. He understood that the weaker a<br />
political party's philosophical base, the more likely it is to be hijacked by single-issue<br />
groups which have a focus that is sectional and not national.<br />
These aspects of Liberalism lay at the heart of Menzies' political views. They have an<br />
enduring relevance and value, and modem Liberalism remains strongly committed to<br />
them. Any assessment of Menzies' influence on Australian public life would be incomplete<br />
without reference to the great strengthening influence he exerted in support of<br />
democratic constitutionalism in Australia.<br />
Throughout his long career in State and Federal politics, Menzies demonstrated<br />
consummate and, in my view, unrivalled skill as a political practitioner. But even more<br />
than that, he demonstrated his great commitment to Parliamentary democracy.<br />
He never forgot that the responsibilities of democratic government are not some preordained<br />
right bestowed on a privileged few, but are a gift from the people.<br />
He understood that the strength of our national political institutions directly affect the<br />
value of the democratic rights exercised by individual Australians.<br />
That is why Menzies placed the authority, standards and traditions of Parliament<br />
squarely at the centre of the national governments that he led.<br />
It is why he always insisted on adherence to the proper processes of Cabinet decisionmaking.<br />
It is why he championed the doctrine of the separation of powers. </p>
<p>19/ 11/ 96 09: 55 Pg: 9<br />
9<br />
It is why he refused to compromnise on the need for honest and competent<br />
administration and the accountability of government.<br />
It is why he turned his back on the attractions of a legal career in private practice in<br />
favour of fulfilling his deeply-felt sense of public duty.<br />
I have spoken tonight of the need to guard against the re-writing of Australian political<br />
history and, in particular, to ensure that the contribution of Robert Menzies and the<br />
Liberal tradition are accorded their proper place in it,<br />
There is, of course, a related and broader challenge involved. And that is to ensure<br />
that our history as a nation is not written definitively by those who take the view that<br />
Australians should apologise for most of it.<br />
This ' black arm band' view of our past reflects a belief that most Australian history<br />
since 1788 has been little more than a disgraceful story of imperialism, exploitation,<br />
racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination.<br />
I take a very different view. I believe that the balance sheet of our history is one of<br />
heroic achievement and that we have achieved much more as a nation of which we can<br />
be proud than of which we should be ashamed.<br />
In saying that, I do not exclude or ignore specific aspects of our past where we are<br />
rightly held to account. Injustices were done in Australia, and no-one should obscure<br />
or minimise them.<br />
We need to acknowledge as a nation the realities of what European settlement has<br />
meant for the first Australians, the Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, and in<br />
particular the assault on their traditions and the physical abuse they endured.<br />
We need to remember that there were wasteiful animosities that were generated by<br />
sectarian intolerance for so much of our history.<br />
We need to confront the scale of the damage we have done to our own natural<br />
environment. But in understanding these realities our priority should not be to apportion blame and<br />
guit for historic wrongs but to commit to a practical program of action that will<br />
remove the enduring legacies of disadvantage.<br />
That is why our priority should be a process of reconciliation with Aboriginal and<br />
Torres Strait Islander Australians built on a practical program to alleviate their<br />
disadvantage in terms of health, literacy, housing, employment and respec for their<br />
culture and traditions, as well as to facilitate the goal of greater economic<br />
independence. It is why we need to implement the plans we have put forward for the most<br />
comprehensive revitalisation in our history of Australia's unique but fragile national<br />
environment, </p>
<p>Fax from191/ 6 955 P: 0<br />
it is why we need to ensure that all Australians irrespective of their race, colour,<br />
beliefs or country of origin are accorded respect and dignity as individuals and are<br />
given an equal entitlement to achieve their aspirations, free from intinmidationi and<br />
discrimination. The debate over Australian history, however, risks being distorted if its focus is<br />
confined only to the shortcomings of previous generations. It risks being further<br />
distorted if highly selective views of Australian history are used as the basis for endless<br />
and agonised navel-gazing about who we are or, as seems to have happened over<br />
recent years, as part of a ' perpetual seminar' for elite opinion about our national<br />
identity. The current debate over Australian history would benefit from a more balanced<br />
approach, from a wider perspective and from less pre-ordained pessimism.<br />
In the broad balance sheet of our history, there is a story of great Australian<br />
achievement to be told.<br />
In that context, we are right to be proud of the economic achievements of our past<br />
building in a vast and unforgiving continent one of the world's great suppliers of food,<br />
minerals and agricultural commodities.<br />
We are right to be proud of having built one of the most prosperous, most egalitarian<br />
and fairest societies in the world,<br />
We are right to be proud of our tradition of mateship in both peace and war-<br />
We are right to be proud of living in one of the world's oldest continuous democracies,<br />
having pioneered advances in women's franchise, individual freedom, the<br />
accountability of governments and the rule of law.<br />
We are right to be proud of having established one of the most ethnically diverse<br />
societies in the world in which tolerance, respect for differences and opportunities for<br />
all have been the distinguishing features.<br />
We are right to be proud of our sense of Australian community characterised by our<br />
strong traditions of voluntary associations and our safeguarding of an effective social<br />
security safety net.<br />
We are right to be proud of our well-merited national reputation for innovation,<br />
practicality and down-to-earth common sense.<br />
These are all achievements that many generations of Australians have worked hard to<br />
secure. In highlighting them, we do not seek to obscure the failings of the past but to<br />
restore a sense of balance and perspective. I 19/ 11/ 96 09: 55 Pg: 18 </p>
<p>Fax from 19/ 11/ 96 09: 55 Pg: 11<br />
Australian history should never be a source of smug delusions or comfortable<br />
superiority. But nor should it be a basis for obsessive and consuming national guilt and<br />
shame. We need to work hard to remove the disadvantages which some Australians continue<br />
to endure as a legacy of our history. But we need to recognise that our history is also<br />
the story of a great Australian achievement in which we can, and should, take great<br />
pride. Finally tonight, I wish to turn to the future of Liberalism in meeting the challenges<br />
which Australia faces.<br />
Menzies' political success lay in building an enduring and broadly-based constituency<br />
that supported Liberalism's values and priorities. At the heart of that constituency<br />
were ' the forgotten people' of that era the men and women of the great Australian<br />
mainstream who felt excluded from the special interest elitism of the Liberal Party's<br />
immediate predecessors and from the trade union dominance of the Labor Party. They<br />
included small business people, farmers, employees in enterprises both large and small,<br />
women, famnilies concerned for their security, older Australians, young people in search<br />
of jobs and opportunity, and many others.<br />
Australia faces fundamentally different challenges to those of the Australia of the<br />
Menzies era. But Liberalism faces the ongoing challenge of building an enduring and<br />
broadly-based constituency across the great mainstream of our rapidly changing<br />
society. Over recent times, a new constituency has galvanised around new issues and in support<br />
of Liberal priorities.<br />
It includes many of the ' battlers' and families struggling hard to get ahead. It includes<br />
Australians, young and old, who want Australia to break free of the legacy of debt and<br />
deficits. It includes small business people who want to expand, invest and employ<br />
more Australians. It includes all those who want the talents of Australians to be<br />
liberated so that Australia can achieve its full potential. It includes all those who do<br />
not want their national government to respond to the loudest clamour of the noisiest<br />
minority. This new constituency does not represent a permanent realignment in Adstralian<br />
politics. Its continued support for Liberal priorities cannot be taken for granted it<br />
must be earned through keeping faith, through staying in touch, and through<br />
continuing to be humbled by the privilege of governing a great country like Australia in<br />
the interests. of all Australians.<br />
Liberalism now has an opportunity, unparalleled for almost fifty years, to consolidate a<br />
new coalition of support among the broad cross-section of the Australian people.<br />
It will only prove enduring if Liberalism continues to relate its fimdamental values and<br />
principles to the concerns and aspirations of the Australian mainstreamn, rather than the<br />
narrower agendas of elites and special interests-</p>
<p>Fax from~ 19/ 11/ 96 09: 55 Pg: 12<br />

That means building a genuinely shared sense of national purpose rather than an<br />
amalgamation of special interests.<br />
It means being flat stepping back from implementing the reforms that will make our<br />
economy competitive with others into the future, that will generate jobs and investment<br />
for Australia, and that will raise Australian living standards.<br />
It means communicating clearly the rationale for change where change is necessary,<br />
and ensuring that consequent reforms and burdens impact fairly on different sections of<br />
the community.<br />
It means not being a Government of economic dogma, but a Goverrnent of economic<br />
common sense.<br />
It means being concerned not only with economnic efficiency, but also with equity and<br />
fairness as well.<br />
It means seeking a more productive economy, a more responsible fiscal policy and<br />
more effective markets not as ends in themselves or as articles of some rigid<br />
ideological faith but as the practical means for achieving rising living standards,<br />
expanding employment opportunities and an effective social safety net.<br />
It means achieving a practical balance between the limits of government and the limits<br />
of markets, between laissez-faire economics on the one side and a suffocating<br />
centralism by government and bureaucracy on the other.<br />
It means understanding accurately in which direction the forces of change are taking<br />
the Australian economy towards smaller workplaces, towards more decentralised<br />
work patterns, towards more independent sources of employment in a dynamic and<br />
rapidly changing regional economy.<br />
It means enhancing job-creating investment in the Australian economy as we are<br />
doing through our Budget strategy of fiscal consolidation and enhanced<br />
competitiveness which is providing the climate for lower interest rates, as well as<br />
through our initiatives to make it easier to do business in Australia.<br />
It means putting the interests of Australian f~ aies at the centre of national<br />
policymnaking as we are through our family tax initiative, through our private health<br />
insurance rebates, through our maintenance of the social security safety net, through<br />
addressing the causes of family breakdowns, and through many other measures.<br />
It means giving Australians more choice in the way they live and work more choice in<br />
industrial relations, more choice to join or not to join a trade union, more choice in<br />
education, more choice in child care, more choice in telecommnunications.<br />
It means liberating and re-energising small businesses all around Australia as we are<br />
through our industrial relations, taxation, paperwork and other initiatives that will give<br />
them more incentives to expand, invest and create more jobs. </p>

it means strengthening the decentralised networks of famnilies, workplaces and<br />
communities as far more effective guarantors of choice, freedom and opportunity than<br />
centralised political and bureaucratic controls.<br />
It means significantly expanding measures to protect Australia's unique environment<br />
as we will through our historic one billion dollar Natural Heritage Trust of Australia<br />
just as soon as the Senate passes the legislation on the one third privatisation of Teistra<br />
which will provide the necessary funding.<br />
It means achieving the flil potential of our rapidly developing partnerships with the<br />
countries of the Asia-Pacific region at the same time as we continue to build on our<br />
important and longstanding relationships with our traditional friends.<br />
In meeting these challenges, Liberalism draws on a rich store of ideas and values. But<br />
our clearest guiding principle will be to stay true to what we have always been a<br />
political movement owned by no special interests, defending no special privileges and<br />
accountable onily to the Australian people in meeting the responsibility to build a better<br />
and fairer future for all of them. 19/ 11/ 96 09: 55 Pg: 13 </p>
