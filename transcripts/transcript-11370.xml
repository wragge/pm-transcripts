    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...................</p>
<p>It was my very special privilege to serve as a parliamentary colleague</p>
<p> and ministerial colleague with Kevin Newman and to have the rare privilege</p>
<p> of serving with husband and wife in public life of Australia. I count</p>
<p> it a very great honour to say some words.</p>
<p>First of all, of comfort and love and assurance to you, Jocelyn, to</p>
<p> Kate and Campbell, to their children, your grandchildren and the other</p>
<p> members of Kevin's family.</p>
<p>I first met Kevin Newman on the streets of Launceston, when I campaigned</p>
<p> for him as a fairly raw and new member of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Australian politics since World War II has produced many by-elections</p>
<p> but few of those by-elections have presaged coming events and have</p>
<p> been seen in subsequent times as watersheds in Australian political</p>
<p> history. None more accurately fits that description than the famous</p>
<p> by-election in Bass in 1975 that saw Kevin enter Federal Parliament</p>
<p> as the member for Bass.</p>
<p>Within a few months he became a Minister in the Fraser Government</p>
<p> and for the next seven years he and I were ministerial colleagues</p>
<p> together for the entire period of that Government. And Kevin held</p>
<p> no less than five ministries - Repatriation; Environment, Housing</p>
<p> and Community Development; National Developments; Productivity; and</p>
<p> Administrative Services. And he also in the course of discharging</p>
<p> his responsibilities in those two portfolios he assisted the Prime</p>
<p> Minister in Federal Affairs and he also assisted the Minister for</p>
<p> Defence.</p>
<p>Major General Phillips recalled the words, the injunction rather,</p>
<p> of Sir William Slim when he was Governor-General of Australia, that</p>
<p> the officers of the Australian Defence Forces should display courage,</p>
<p> faith and integrity. Throughout his parliamentary and ministerial</p>
<p> career Kevin lived out that injunction of the Labor Governor-General</p>
<p> of Australia.</p>
<p>I never found him to be other than unfailingly honest. I never found</p>
<p> him to be other than a loyal and dedicated member of a ministerial</p>
<p> team. He was a passionate advocate of the cause of the people of Tasmania</p>
<p> for whom he felt a special affinity and a special responsibility.</p>
<p>He was loyal to his Department. He advocated his causes and his beliefs</p>
<p> not always uncritically but always very tenaciously. He was always</p>
<p> of warm and friendly disposition to his colleagues.</p>
<p>During the time that he was Minister for National Development he had</p>
<p> to handle in 1979 and 1980 considerably difficult public debate about</p>
<p> the price of fuel and the introduction of new policies which led to</p>
<p> very significant dislocation for rural Australia and for many of the</p>
<p> businesses of Australia. And he did that with enormous skill and enormous</p>
<p> tenacity.</p>
<p>He played a very major role as the Minister for Administrative Services</p>
<p> and therefore as the Minister responsible for the Australian Federal</p>
<p> Police in the formation of the National Crime Authority where he played</p>
<p> a very major role in the fight against organised crime. And he was</p>
<p> one of the first ministers at a federal level to warn in very strong</p>
<p> and resolute terms about the threat of organised crime in this country</p>
<p> and its potential to corrupt people in high places and that was a</p>
<p> warning that was valid at the time and was subsequently borne out</p>
<p> by certain events.</p>
<p>I want to say to you, Jocelyn, on behalf of your many admiring friends</p>
<p> and supporters and colleagues in the Liberal Party and in the broader</p>
<p> community that you and your family are very much in our thoughts and</p>
<p> our prayers today.</p>
<p>Your partnership with Kevin was a very special one and something that</p>
<p> both of you treasured and all of us admired. Thirty-eight years of</p>
<p> being together you saw the difficulties of service life in that book</p>
<p> 'Partners' both you and Kevin spoke of the difficulties of separation</p>
<p> when both of your children were young. Kevin worried about the burden</p>
<p> that you carried particularly in relation to some of the criticism</p>
<p> unfairly directed at the servicemen involved in the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>Both of you maintained faith to each other and both of you were a</p>
<p> wonderful example of the great partnership for life. And in that book</p>
<p> Kevin spoke of that partnership and I use some of his words. And he</p>
<p> said: 'over recent years we have each had to look a doctor in the</p>
<p> eye while we were told we not immortal. That can be pretty hard to</p>
<p> come to terms with but it can also be enormously positive. The heightened</p>
<p> appreciation of life, love, family and friends you subsequently experience.</p>
<p> We think fortune has smiled on us. When we married it was for love</p>
<p> but we all know that choosing a mate for life can be pig in a poke.</p>
<p> For us a long marriage that worked. We have been blessed with great</p>
<p> children and grandchildren. We have both had important and influential</p>
<p> careers but best of all we are still best mates.</p>
<p>And who amongst us wherever we might have come from and whatever we</p>
<p> might have done in our lives would not want more than anything else</p>
<p> to be able to say that of our life and our loves and our partnerships.</p>
<p> And I think it sums up better than any words I can muster what was</p>
<p> important to Kevin. It sums up the simple faith in his country, a</p>
<p> love of his family, a proper sense of priorities and a belief that</p>
<p> in the words of his Governor-General and Commander in Chief that if</p>
<p> you live according to the principles of courage and faith and integrity</p>
<p> you can endure the challenges, you can endure difficulties, you can</p>
<p> make a difference.</p>
<p>Kevin was a well-loved colleague. He was a great servant of Australia,</p>
<p> he was a great servant of Tasmania, he was a great servant of the</p>
<p> cause of the Liberal Party of Australia. And I think I can speak for</p>
<p> all of those identities in thanking him and thanking God for him,</p>
<p> and assuring Jocelyn and Kate and Campbell and their family and their</p>
<p> friends of our great love and support and affection at this time.</p>
