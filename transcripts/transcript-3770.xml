PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH AT OPENING OF<br />
OZANAM VILLA HOSTEL, LISMORE<br />
8 JUNE, 1975 ^ I.<br />
YOUR LORDSHIP, ON, DOUG ANTHONY, MR. MAYOR,<br />
REVEREND CLERGY AND SISTERS, MEMBERS AND FRIENDS OF THE<br />
SOCIETY OF ST. VINCENT DE PAUL.<br />
IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO BE BACK IN<br />
LISMORE AGAIN AND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH ANOTHER<br />
ST. VINCENT DE PAUL INITIATIVE. IN FEBRUARY LAST YEAR<br />
I WAS ASKED TO OPEN THE OZAmAM HOME IN CANBERRA AND<br />
JUST TWO WEEKS AGO, MY WIFE AND I ATTENDED THE OPENING<br />
OF ST. BEDE'S IN HURSTVILLE,<br />
IN CANBERRA, THE BLESSING WAS GIVEN BY<br />
BISHOP CAHILL AN EASY NAME TO REMEMBER IN NEW SOUTH ' ALES.<br />
AT ST. BEDE'S THE BLESSING CAME FROM BISHOP CREMIN<br />
ANOTHER GOOD, EASY IRISH NAME. AND BEING A CHARITABLE<br />
MAN, BISHOP CREMIN FELT HE SHOULD WARN ME ABOUT LISMORE.<br />
HE TOLD ME THAT BISHOP FARRELLY HAD BEEN SUCCEEDED BY<br />
HIS LORDSHIP BISHOP SATTERTHWAITE, WHO MUST HAVE ONE OF<br />
THE MOST DIFFICULT ECCLESIASTICAL NAMES IN THE COUNTRY<br />
IF NOT THE WORLD. ,/ 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
I MUST SAY I WAS SO INTRIGUED ' Y THE NAME<br />
THAT I LOOKED IT UP INi A BOOK CALLED SI, R NAt OFl UT i E<br />
UNITED KIGDDOM., THAT WAS AFTER I COULDN'T FIND IT IN<br />
THE BOOK OF SAINS., ANYWAY, I LEARNED THAT IT'S OF<br />
SCANDINAVIAN ORIGIN AND MEANS " THE HILL PASTURE CLEARING".<br />
WHICH IS A QUITE PROPER NAME FOR SOMEONE WITH A FLOCK<br />
TO TEND, -BISHOP CREMIN WAS SAYING TO ME THAT WHEN<br />
HE WAS DOING POSTGRADUATE STUDIES IN ROME,<br />
BISHOP SATTERTHWAITE LED A CHARMED LIFE, HE WAS<br />
NEVER CALLED ON TO SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE NOBODY COULD<br />
PRONOUNCE HIS NAME. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE MIGHT<br />
LIKE TO CHANGE PLACES WITH ME.<br />
TWO WEEKS AGO AT ST. BEDE'S IN HURSTVILLE<br />
I WAS STRUCK BY THE GENEROSITY OF THE STATE PRESIDENT<br />
OF THE ST. VINCENT DE PAUL SOCIETY, BILL FITZGERALD.<br />
NOT ONLY DID HE PRESENT ME WITH A BOOK ILLUSTRATING<br />
THE PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN BY CATHOLIC CARE FOR THE AGED,<br />
BUT HE REMARKED ON THE SENSE OF PARTNERSHIP WHICH HAS<br />
GROWN UP BETWEEN THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AND CHARITABLE<br />
ORGANISATIONS IN TOGETHER IDENTIFYING AND SERVING THOSE<br />
IN THE COMMUNITY WHO NEED OUR ATTENTION AND OUR CARE,<br />
1 / 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
IT IS A VITAL PARTNERSHIP AND) I APPRECIATE THAT<br />
COOPERATION, 11TS TANGIBLE RESUJLTS, SUCH AS HOMES<br />
LIKE THIS ONE, W/ ILL STAND AND SERVE THE NEEDS OF<br />
GENERATIONS OF AUSTRALIANS WHO DESERVE TO DE LOOKED AFTER.<br />
PEOPLE ARE ALW'AYS ASKING WHEIRE THEIR TAXES<br />
GO, WHERE ALL THE MONEY IS BEING SPENT. IT IS EASY<br />
TO JUSTIFY EXPENDITURE ON OBVIOUS THINGS LIK( E EDUCATION<br />
AND HEALTH FACILITIES. ON PURELY ECONOMIC GROUNDS THE<br />
INVESTMENT BRINGS EXCELLENT DIVIDENDS FOR OUR SOCIETY<br />
AS A WHOLE. BUT THE REAL HUMANITY OF ANY SOCIETY [ S SEEN<br />
TrHROUGH THE WAY IT BOTHERS TO TREAT ITS OL-DER PEOPLE,<br />
PEOPLE W. 1HO HAVE RETIRED, HAVING( 5 GIVEN THEIR WORKING<br />
LIVES AND QUITE FREQUENTLY THEIR HEALTH, NOT TO0 MENTION<br />
THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS,, TO THE SERVICE OF THEIR<br />
COMMUNITY AND THEIR COUNTRY, EXPENDITURE ON THE NEEDS<br />
OF THESE PEOPLE CAN NEVER BE EXPECTED TO SHOW RETURNS<br />
IN MATERIAL TERMS. i v A </p>
<p>IT'S PRECISELY THAT SORT OF EXPENDITURE<br />
WHERE THE COMMUNITY SHOWS HOW I-HUMANE IT REALLY IS.<br />
WHERE GOVERNMENTS SHOW HOW MUCH THEY CARE. THESE<br />
ARE THE AREAS WHERE TIME AND AGAIN THE ST, VINCENT<br />
DE PAUL SOCIETY HELPS BRIDGE THE VERY REAL GAP<br />
BETWEEN THE HAVES AND THE HAVE-NOTS IN OUR SOCIETY,<br />
THESE ARE THE AREAS THAT CONCERN MY GOVERNMENT,<br />
THESE ARE THE VERY AREAS AT PRESENT UNDER CHALLENGE<br />
IN OUR COURTS, SOME TWENTY YEARS AGO, SIR ROBERT MENZIES<br />
INTRODUCED DIRECT FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR AGED PERSONS<br />
HOMES, IT BEGAN AS A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR SUBSIDY.<br />
WHEN A LABOR GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED IN DECEMBER 1972<br />
THE LEVEL OF SUBSIDY WAS 1'! E HAVE<br />
INCREASED IT SUBSTANTIALLY SINCE THEN, MOST RECENTLY<br />
LATE LAST YEAR, WHEN WE RAISED IT TO A $ 4 DIRECT<br />
FEDERAL SUBSIDY FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR SPENT. THIS<br />
OZANAM VILLA HOSTEL, AMONG MANY OTHERS, BENEFITED<br />
FROM THAT DECISION, IT HAS BEEN ABLE TO ATTRACT A<br />
MAXIMUM SUBSIDY OF $ 470,538 FROM THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT,<br />
IN ALL, THIS LISMORE HOME HAS HAD $ 601,267 IN FEDERAL<br />
GRANTS, DIRECT GRANTS. IT IS ONE OF 16 ST. VINCENT<br />
DE PAUL HOMES IN NEW SOUTH WALES ACCOMMODATING 565 PEOPLE<br />
AND ATTRACTING DIRECT AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT GRANTS OF<br />
$ 2,998,142, </p>
<p>BUT WE'-C AINNOT AFFORD TO TAKE-SUCHI THINGS<br />
FOR GRANTED, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE ARE HIGH COURT<br />
CHALLENGES WHICH CAST DOUBT ON THE RIGHT OF THE<br />
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PAY MONEY DIRECTLY TO CHARITABLE<br />
ORGANISATIONS FOR AGED PERSONS HOMES AND HOSTELS,<br />
IT ALSO AFFECTS OTHER VITAL COMMUNITY-ORIENTED SERVICES<br />
WHICH ARE SUBSIDISED, RANGING FROM MEALS ON WHEELS TO<br />
THE BLOOD TRANSFUSION SERVICE, SO MANY THINGS WE TAKE<br />
FOR GRANT. ED AND WHICH SUCCESSIVE FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS<br />
HAVE EITHER INITIATED OR HELPED SUSTAIN,<br />
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SCHEMES INVOLVING<br />
QUITE COLOSSAL AMOUNTS OF MONEY, SCHEMES DESIGNED<br />
TO STREAMLINE THE PROVISION OF VITAL COMMUNITY SERVICES<br />
THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA, SCHEMES IN WHICH ALL THE CHURCHES<br />
HAVE A REAL INVOLVEMENT, THE ST, VINCENT DE PAUL SOCIETY<br />
IN PARTICULAR IS CONCERNED WITH THE PROVISION OF SERVICES<br />
RANGING FROM CARE OF THE HANDICAPPED TO SHELTER FOR<br />
THE HOMELESS, ALL OF WHICH DESERVE AND GET DIRECT<br />
FEDERAL SUBSIDIES. 1 6/ 6 </p>
<p>THE CONTENTrI ON ADVANC: ED BY TH OSE CHALLENGINC;<br />
US IN THE COURTS IS THAT THIS MONEY OUGHT TO D; E DOLED<br />
OUT TO THE INDIVIDUAL STATES WHICH CAN IN TURN DOLE<br />
IT OUT TO RECIPIENT COMMUJNITY ORGANISATIONS, AND PROJECTS,<br />
WE ARE TALIKING ABOUT $ 31 MILLION UNDER THE ACED PERSONS<br />
HOMES ACT, $ 19 MILLION UNDER THE AGED PERSONS HOSTELS ACT,<br />
ALL. THAT COULD BE ACHIEVED BY CHANNELLING SUCH<br />
MONEY THROUGH STATE BUREAUCRACIES WOULD-BE THE HOPELESS<br />
SLOWING UP OF FUNDING FOR AREAS OF CARE WHICH SHOULD NOT<br />
HAVE TO WAIT UPON THE RESOLUTION OF PETTY MANUJFACTURED<br />
RIVALRIES. PEOPLE NEEDING CAP~ E INVARIABLY NEED IT<br />
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER,-1 DON ' T NEED TO TE'LL THAT<br />
TO THIS AUDIENCE WdHICH HAS ALREADY DEMONSTRATED HOW<br />
MUCH IT CARES. THEL HOLY SPIRIT CONFERENCE OF THE ST. VINCENT<br />
DE PAUL SOCIETY HERE IN LISMORE REALISED THE PRESSING<br />
NEED FOR ADDITIONAL ACCOMMODATION FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE<br />
IN THIS AREA, AND IN BUILDING THIS NEW HOSTEL, THEY<br />
CARRIED ON THE WORK BEGUN sY FATHER JOHN ROGER ArD<br />
MiR. ARTHUR MONAGHAN IN 19691 THIS NEW HOSTEL IS A<br />
CAREFULLY PLANNED AND EXECUTED PROJECT, INCORPORATING<br />
THE LATEST DESIGN IDEAS AND CATERING FOR 149 ELDERLY<br />
RESIDENTS AND 2 LIVE-IN STAFF, 1 ,17 </p>
<p>7,<br />
THE SOLE CRITERION FOR ADMISSION AS ALWAYS WITH<br />
1HOMIES RUN BY THE ST, VINCENT IDE PAUL SOCIETY IS NEED,<br />
I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS ALREADY A WAITING LIST FOR<br />
ADMISSION TO THIS NEW HOSTEL AND THAT THERE ARE 50 PEOPLE<br />
WAITING FOR ADMISSION TO THE ORIGINAL WING,<br />
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE TIME WILL COME<br />
WHEN THE MEMBERS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT CONFERENCE WILL<br />
SIT DOWN AND CONSIDER THE WAITING LISTS AND WONDER<br />
WHETHER THEY SHOULDN'T ADD TO THIS OZANAM VILLA COMPLEX<br />
TO MEET THE CONTINUING COMMUNITY NEED FOR THIS KIND OF<br />
ACCOMMODATION AND THE CARE THAT GOES WITH IT,<br />
WHEN THAT HAPPENS, MY GOVERNMENT WILL BE<br />
HAPPY TO COOPERATE WITH THEM IN THE EXCHANGE OF IDEAS<br />
AND ADVICE ON THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS KIND OF<br />
BUILDING, AND PROVIDING THE HIGH COURT CHALLENGE TO<br />
OUR FUNDING OF SUCH COMMUNITY PROJECTS DOES NOT SUCCEED,<br />
MY GOVERNMENT WILL BE DELIGHTED TO ASSIST ONCE MORE<br />
WITH THE PROVISION OF THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE SUBSIDY,<br />
THERE IS A VERY PEAL SENSE IN WHICH WE'RE ALL IN THIS<br />
TOGETHER, I HAVE VERY MUCH PLEASURE INDEED IN DECLARING<br />
OPEN THIS LATEST ST, VINCENT DE PAUL PROJECT, THE OZANAM<br />
VILLA HOSTEL, A FITTING REMINDER OF THE VISION OF YOUR<br />
FOUNDER, FREDERIC OZANAM, </p>
