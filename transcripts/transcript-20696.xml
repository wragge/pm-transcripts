    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm very well.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>...seems to have caused a bit of a storm today. Do you stand by them? Regret them in any way?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't. I haven't attacked the loyalty of anybody. I've simply pointed out that if there's a demonstration, it does give some encouragement to the leadership in Iraq. I think that's just a matter of commonsense, it's not a question of questioning people's loyalty. I mean, I accept, I defend the right of people to protest completely in a democratic society, I've always done that and I always will. But people have to understand that if you do that it does send a signal, just as the things I do send signals to other people.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And you're convinced it would have comforted Saddam?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, well, there's no doubt that... it was commented upon, the demonstrations not only in Australia but all around the world were commented upon by the Iraqi regime and very favourably.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would you like to see a repeat? Would you be concerned about a repeat...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the question of whether there's a repeat is a matter... that's a matter for them. But look, any suggestion that I'm questioning the right of people to protest is false. I mean, I heard Mr Crean say I was imputing the loyalty of those people, I'm doing nothing of the kind - they're perfectly loyal, decent Australians. I just make the point that just as I have to accept the consequences of my conduct, other people who are involved in this debate must understand that their actions have an impact.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And John Brogden, how's he looking?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think he's looking very well. I think he's been very active. I think since Christmas the Opposition has released a large number of imaginative policies in a lot of areas of bread and butter concern to the people of New South Wales.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And he'll be taking an even more active role?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I will certainly be giving him my strong support. But in the end, State elections are determined on State issues, as Federal elections are determined on Federal issues. But he will receive my very strong support.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can he win?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I believe he can, yes. It'll be difficult but, you know, a lot of people didn't think Bracks was going to beat Kennett a few years ago, I didn't. And you can't ever predict elections and I think one of the amazing things is how the Premier of New South Wales is getting let off scot-free by the media for refusing to debate Mr Brogden. It's been an accepted element of election campaigns now for 20 years that the leaders debate each other. And I think it's incredible arrogance on the part of Mr Carr to refuse to debate him and if I may say so, I think the media's got a job to hound Mr Carr into facing his opponent. Thank you.</p>
