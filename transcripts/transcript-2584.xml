PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF RICHARD CLEAVER LODGE<br />
PERTH, W. A.<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, The Rt Hon. William<br />
McMahon, M. P. MAY 7, 1972.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
Thank you for your welcome and for the opportunity to<br />
be here today. This occasion is an important one for every one who<br />
has the welfare of old and handicapped people close to their hearts.<br />
But most of all it is important to those elderly people who will<br />
move into this new lodge to live. This new building is to be their<br />
home, and in it I know they will find security and care as well<br />
as contentment and happiness. In it they will find friendships and<br />
associations which will do much to remove fear and loneliness from<br />
their lives. I do not believe that any nation . can be at ease with<br />
its conscience while there are old, and frail, and handicapp~ d<br />
people in our midst who are without proper care.<br />
The problems of modern governments are many and complex,<br />
but there must still be in the forefront of our policies, the<br />
welfare of the people whose life's work is done., and who are without<br />
the means to look nfter themselves. In one way or another,<br />
every elderly person in our community played a part in making'<br />
Australia a favoured country in the world.<br />
Just think for a moment of the events in our history<br />
through which a person of seventy years of age has lived. They<br />
saw the foundation years of this commonwealth, and saw us grow and<br />
mature from a rural to an industrialised society: Two world wars<br />
and other conflicts7 droughts, depression, flood and fire; progress,<br />
development, achievement and prosperity. All these things good<br />
and bad have given Australians many reasons to be proud. They<br />
have made us a nation. Let us not forget, then, that today's old<br />
people were the young people of those yesterdays of our history.<br />
They were part of the pioneering force in our community. They<br />
worked hard and they rcarcd families and gave real m-aning to the<br />
old song " Advance Australia Fair". Those of them who are in need<br />
should not be forgotten now, and here at Swan Cottage Homes they<br />
are not forgotten. </p>
<p>This is one of the leading institutions of its kind in<br />
Australia. Nearly twelve years ago, it was founded by my friend<br />
Dick Cleaver to provide modern low cost housing for elderly people.<br />
At that time he opened a bank account of ten dollars. Today the<br />
Swan Cottage Homes organisation controls assets valued at two and<br />
three quarter million dollars. There are now 401 units providing<br />
accommodation for 531 people with a later potential for 617 people.<br />
I think you will all agree that this is a magnificent result of the<br />
dedication and inspiration of Dick Cleaver and Mrs. Cleaver, and I<br />
pay my tribute to them now.<br />
I think it is appropriate that this new block, which I will<br />
officially name shortly, is called after him. One of its impressive<br />
aspects is the effort made and one which is obviously succeeding<br />
to treat elderly people as individuals and not as numbers in an<br />
anonymous group. This is tremendously important because each one<br />
of us, whatever our station in life, has pride and self-respect.<br />
If our needy old people cannot have these things because of our<br />
neglect then the nation will have a stain on its record which will<br />
be to its eternal shame. This village protects the pride and selfrespect<br />
of all who come under its roof. It offers constant care for<br />
those who must have it. It offers a home for those who need one.<br />
My Government regards its sgial welfare policies as among<br />
our highest priorities. We have been actively reviewing, revising<br />
and extending them and each year has seen some now assistance being<br />
given or existing benefits increased. This will go on. The<br />
business of looking after those in need is " unfinished business",<br />
so far as my Government is concerned. It may be a task without end,<br />
but we are determined that the Government will play its part and<br />
play it in a significant way. Under the Aged Persons Homes Act<br />
which I had the pleasure of introducing into Parliament the<br />
Commonwealth government has given substantial assistance towards<br />
this project. Much has also been provided by dedicated fund-raising<br />
efforts. My Government does depend heavily on community effort and<br />
interests: For the identification of the needs of old people and the<br />
areas where help is most wanted.<br />
Governments can act against p xe only with the guidance<br />
and help of their own citizensand when help is given, it is the<br />
personal touch of the local groups of welfare workers and the staffs<br />
of the institutions themselves which makes the old and the frail and<br />
infirm feel that human beings ar: helping them not an anonymous,<br />
remote and impersonal government. Today marks the completion of<br />
another project in the proud record of Swan Cottage Homes. They have<br />
have served a noble purpose and have set an example to the nation<br />
i: so many of their activities. The development of their resources<br />
is not at an end by any means. We need to spend very substantial<br />
sums to help our elderly citizens who cannot help themselves.<br />
Since the Aged Persons Homes Act came into force in 1954,<br />
Commonwealth grants have totalled about 131 million dollars and when<br />
all subsidised projects have been completed, accommodation will have<br />
been n-ovided for over 41,000 old people. / 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
This is a fine community effort, and I don't want to appear<br />
to be suggesting that it is mostly the Government that has done<br />
all this. The Government is a substantial contributor, it is true,<br />
and will go on providing as much as it can, but this is, in fact,<br />
a co-operative effort by Government, by people, by institutions and<br />
companies. I want to see it continue throughout the whole range<br />
of our social services. My Government is pledged to help and help<br />
it will. Our record in the past is, I believe, a good one. But<br />
we are not satisfied. We want to do better and we intend to do<br />
better. We want to see our old and needy people all of them<br />
secure, remembered, and at peace in the evening of their lives.<br />
I believe this is a national duty for us all and one we must and<br />
will fulfil. </p>
