    <content><![CDATA[<p>Melbourne</p>
<p>This is a great day for this shipyard, for our Navy, for the Australian Defence Force and for the defence of Australia.</p>
<p>Seventy one years ago today, the great British fortress of Singapore surrendered.  The Royal Navy's Prince of Wales and the Repulse had been sunk only two months earlier.<br />
Within days, Darwin was bombed.  Within months, the first Canberra would be fighting in her final battle for us. </p>
<p>In those days, we truly learned that while our alliances are vital and our friends are many, our security is always ultimately in our own hands.</p>
<p>That is the lesson of the 15 February 1942 and it is a lesson we carry with us on the 15th of February 2013 as we name this ship.</p>
<p>That the best defence is self-defence: that for an island nation, its own Navy is its historic guarantee.</p>
<p>From those days to these, from Savo Island to the Middle East Area of Operations, the name Canberra has served our Navy and our nation well.  </p>
<p>I am proud that soon it will serve us again.</p>
<p>The Canberra and her sister Landing Helicopter Dock ship will give our Navy, and our Defence Force as a whole, an entirely new ability to defend Australia and our interests.</p>
<p>They will give our Defence Force an unprecedented ability to exercise and operate on land and sea â supporting amphibious operations and operating independently in our region and beyond like never before.</p>
<p>And when the Australian Navy is called on to provide humanitarian assistance, the Canberra will be ready.</p>
<p>The new Canberra will carry some of our finest war fighters â and it is a tribute to some of our most impressive skilled workers.</p>
<p>935 Australians will work on the Landing Helicopter Dock ships before they put to sea: hundreds of fine Australians doing great Australian jobs.</p>
<p>The Government is committed to maintaining industries here in Australia with the capability to support the Australian Defence Force â and we are committed to creating and supporting the kind of skilled, well-paid work done here at Williamstown.</p>
<p>That's why projects such as the Air Warfare Destroyers and the Future Submarines are so important.</p>
<p>To the veterans and members of the HMAS Canberra/HMAS Shropshire Association â we honour you on such an important day.</p>
<p>I pay my deepest respect and our nation's deepest gratitude to the veterans who served on the first HMAS Canberra during the Second World War.</p>
<p>They never let us down.</p>
<p>No HMAS Canberra has ever let us down â I know we will be proud of the new ship Canberra and all who sail in her.</p>
