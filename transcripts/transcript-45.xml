to you, Mr. Prime Minister, the Government and people of<br />

deeply convinced that the establishment of an attitude<br />
of mutual understanding and thorough collaboration by<br />
states and peoples on the basis of the principles of<br />
peaceful co-existence presents the brightest guarantee<br />
of safety, the strengthening of peace and the removal<br />
of international tension. N. Khrushchev<br />

The Australian Government and the people, for their<br />
part, will continue to pursue with sincerity and vigour<br />
the objectives of lessening international tension and<br />
Sestablishing trust and lasting peace amongst nations,<br />
If genuine good will and co-operation could be brought<br />
