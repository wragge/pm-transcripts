    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well ladies and gentlemen I've called this news conference to announce a number of changes to the Federal Ministry.  I'm announcing that Dr Kemp, the Minister for Environment and Heritage, Daryl Williams, the Minister for Communications, and Christine Gallus, all of whom have announced that they will not be recontesting the next election, will be resigning their current positions and a result I'll be replacing them with a number of people and bringing in some new members to the Ministry.</p>
<p>I'll appoint the current Minister for Territories and Roads, Senator Ian Campbell from Western Australia, as Minister for the Environment and Heritage. I propose appointing Senator Helen Coonan, currently Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, as the Minister for Communications.  I'll promote into the Ministry from her current position as Parliamentary Secretary to the Defence Minister, Mrs Fran Bailey, who will become the Minister for Employment Services and Minister assisting the Minister for Defence.  Mr Jim Lloyd, currently the chief Government Whip, he represents the New South Wales electorate of Robertson, will become the Minister for Roads.  I will appoint as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr Bruce Billson, the Member for Dunkley in Victoria, and as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence I'll appoint Ms Teresa Gambaro, the Member for Petrie in Queensland.  And I will promote Mr Mal Brough who's currently Minister for Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, I'll promote him to the position of Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer and I propose appointing Mr Kerry Bartlett, currently the Liberal Member for Macquarie in New South Wales, as the Chief Government Whip, in place of Mr Lloyd.  These changes will maintain the sense of forward looking and continuity of the Government, Ian Campbell has very significant political skills, strong communications skills in a very important area, namely the environment, and Helen Coonan I am sure will handle the very sensitive and important portfolio of communications extremely well.</p>
<p>I do want to thank David Kemp and Daryl Williams and Christine Gallus and emphasise that in no way is this announcement a reflection on them or their abilities, the reality is that all of them have indicated that they won't be contesting the next election and therefore the maintenance to the ultimate degree of continuity and forward looking requires that people who will be seen as continuing and maintaining that forward momentum the appointment of those in their places should take place. I think it will further strengthen and invigorate and refresh the Federal Ministry as we move through this year.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) clearing the decks?.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I'm not clearing any decks, the ship continues to sail on that very steady course.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible).</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No it's got nothing to do with that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible).</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't propose any major changes in policy areas, it's really, it's not a policy driven thing because in areas like communications our policy is well settled and we're not signalling any changes in any of those areas. Our commitment in the environment is very strong.  But it's just necessary, given that the three people involved are standing down, it's necessary in my view in the interests of maintaining to the full the continuity, that there be some new people in those positions.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well as soon as I can make arrangements.  I have the commission of the Governor General to make this announcement this afternoon and as soon as I can make arrangements with His Excellency, they will be sworn in.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think so, not at all.  The idea that you never make a change to a crew member... as long as the captain is tried and true and experienced and knows where he's going, because ultimately he determines the direction of everything.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it depends on their performance and it also depends on whether we win.  I never presume on the outcome of the election, but clearly these people are appointed to these positions until the election and if the Australian people are kind enough to re-elect the Government, then I will look afresh at everything.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there's always room for fresh blood, particularly when you have plenty of talent.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I didn't say that.  What I said was that I wasn't, by these appointments, signaling any particular changes.  I'm not saying there will be, but you shouldn't see these in a policy change framework.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>By the way in which they are articulate and argue and explain current policy.   Thank you.  Is that all you needed?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the problem has been created by the states because they basically won't sensibly cooperate.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But you've still got to find...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we will find a place on Commonwealth land for Commonwealth waste.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You're just proving my point.  You are just proving my very point.  I mean they say they're in favour of a national solution as long as it doesn't happen in their state.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don't, I don't.</p>
<p>  Thank you.</p>
