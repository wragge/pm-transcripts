PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 26 ARCH 1988<br />
I shall visit the United States from 19-25 June.<br />
The centrepiece of my visit will be Washington, where I look<br />
forward to renewing my contacts with President Reagan,<br />
Secretary of State Shultz and other senior officials of the<br />
Administration. I have been invited to address a Joint Session of the United<br />
States Congress and will also hold meetings withsenior<br />
Congressional leaders. I regard the invitation as a great<br />
honour for Australia.<br />
I shall also visit New York, Chicago and Austin, Texas and<br />
take the opportunity to meet and address political,<br />
business, banking, and investment leaders in those centres.<br />
I shall be visiting the United States at an important<br />
juncture. For example, President Reagan and General<br />
Secretary Gorbachev are scheduled to hold a Summit meeting<br />
in Moscow just prior to my visit. The Presidential election<br />
campaign leading to the installation of a new Administration<br />
in January 1989 will be well under way.<br />
My visit will provide the opportunity to discuss major<br />
developments in international relations and the world<br />
economy with American leaders and to further Australia's<br />
important political and economic interests with our United<br />
States ally. 005314 </p>
