    <content><![CDATA[<p>It is with great sadness that we have today learned of the passing of Jørn Utzon. I extend my sincere condolences to his family and friends.</p>
<p>Jørn Utzon was a visionary architect whose legacy includes one of the world's most spectacular and inspiring buildings, the Sydney Opera House. Standing proudly on the edge of Sydney Harbour the Opera House is one of the most internationally recognised symbols of our nation.</p>
<p>Utzon's vision has brought pride to all Australians and many beyond our shores. Just last year the Sydney Opera House was declared a World Heritage site in recognition of its universal values.</p>
<p>Today I honour him and his creation and know that all Australians will join me in celebrating his legacy. </p>
