    <content><![CDATA[<p>Given the particular hardship faced by those who lost their homes in the Western Australian fires earlier this month, I have authorised additional Commonwealth support in the form of cash payments to people who have lost their principal place of residence or had it rendered uninhabitable.</p>
<p>The cash payments will amount to $1000 for each eligible adult and $400 for each eligible child. Western Australians who are entitled to this assistance will now be able to apply immediately to Centrelink on 1802 233.</p>
<p>This will be over an above the support given by the Commonwealth Government to the Western Australian Government under the long standing Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. Through these arrangements, the Commonwealth assists the states with the costs and resourcing of response and recovery in relation to large scale disasters. </p>
<p>The recovery of the families that have lost their homes and the local communities will take some time. I am committed to working with Premier Carpenter to support the ongoing relief and recovery effort.</p>
