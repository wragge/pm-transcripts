    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was saddened to hear of Charlie Bell's death from cancer at the early age of 44.</p>
<p>He had fought valiantly for months against the disease which claimed his life.  To his wife Leonie and daughter Alex, his mother and other family members I extend my sympathy on their great loss.</p>
<p>Charlie Bell was an outstanding Australian businessman who rose to the top of a worldwide corporate entity - McDonalds - at a very youthful age.</p>
<p>He personified the cheerful, helpful efficiency which has always been a trademark of the company he served all of his working life.</p>
<p>To many he was a role model for other Australians aspiring to succeed in a highly competitive business environment.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Government Charlie Bell headed an inquiry into the burdens imposed by red tape and regulation on small businesses.  He brought to this task his typical qualities of energy and plain speaking.</p>
<p>Charlie Bell's premature death has robbed the business world of a man who possessed both intense commitment to his responsibilities and great integrity.  He was at all times a fine ambassador for corporate Australia.</p>
