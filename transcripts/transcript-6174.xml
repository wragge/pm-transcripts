PRIME MINISTER<br />
For Media Embargoed until12.3l a~ m 6 August 1983<br />
Today is the thirty-eighth anniversary of the dropping of an<br />
atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima. This event added a new<br />
and terrible dimension to the scourge of war. On behalf of the<br />
Government, I wish to mark the occasion by reaffirming our<br />
dedication to the pursuit of world peace and our commitment to<br />
policies designed to halt and reverse the arms race.<br />
The appalling sacrifice made by the people of Hiroshima and<br />
Nagasaki in 1945 is a permanent reminder to us that the<br />
spectre of nuclear holocaust looms over the world and presents<br />
a fundamental challenge to all governments. Australia, under<br />
the Labor Government, is paying special attention to the field<br />
of arms control and disarmament. In the short period since we<br />
came to office, the Government has announced a number of<br />
initiatives in this field. We have appointed Australia's<br />
first Ambassador for Disarmament and are strengthening our<br />
capacity to handle disarmament questions.<br />
Notwithstanding the complexity and divisiveness of many<br />
of these issues, we will do what we can to ensure that the<br />
tragedy of Hiroshima is not repeated. </p>
