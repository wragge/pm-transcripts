PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
Like all Australians I was appalled to learn of the incident at Darling Harbour this evening<br />
and relieved that His Royal Highness suffered no harm.<br />
Physical violence, even the threat of physical violence, has no place in Australian society.<br />
Prince Charles is a very good friend of Australla and a very welcome visitor.<br />
I sincerely hope that the remainder of his stay here will, like his many previous visits, be an<br />
enjoyable one and that all Australians will welcome him wherever he goes.<br />
SYDNEY January 26 1994 </p>
