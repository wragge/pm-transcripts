PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 20 February 1985<br />
The Queensland power dispute has now developed to the point<br />
where it is causing national damage as well as the very<br />
considerable harm and inconvenience it is bringing to the<br />
people of Queensland.<br />
The dispute also has the potential to do serious harm to<br />
Australia's standing as a reliable exporter.<br />
In these circumstances, I call upon all parties to the dispute<br />
to accept the recommendations of the State Industrial<br />
Commission which will allow an immediate return to work.<br />
I also call on all of the unions taking action in support of<br />
the Electrical Trades Union to return to work and cease any<br />
retaliatory action.<br />
This course of action is now urgently needed in the interests<br />
of both Queensland and the nation as a whole. </p>
