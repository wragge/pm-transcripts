STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER v<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, Q, C.<br />
FOR THE PROTECTION OF CONSUMERS qy. 3<br />
IN THE POLICY SPEECH WHICH I DELIVERED ON"<br />
BEHALF OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY AT THE LAST FEDERAL<br />
ELECTIONS, I MADE PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE POLICIES<br />
OF A LABOR GOVERNMENT IN RELATION TO PRICES. IN THIS<br />
CONTEXT I REFERRED TO THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSUMER PROTECTION<br />
ACTIVITIES, CONSUMER KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROPERTIES AND<br />
QUALITY OF PRODUCTS CAN SERVE AS A POWERFUL RESTRAINT. ON<br />
UNJUSTIFIED PRICE INCREASES,<br />
OUR APPROACH WILL FOLLOW TWO PRINCIPAL PATHS.<br />
NAMELY: 1, THROUGH THE FORMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION<br />
OF A FRAMEWORK OF STANDARDS DESIGNED TO<br />
PROTECT BOTH THE PHYSICAL AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS<br />
OF CONSUMERS; AND<br />
2. THROUGH A FRAMEWORK OF APPROPRIATE LAWS.<br />
MY PURPOSE AT THIS TIME IS TO FURNISH INFORMATION<br />
ON THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN REGARD TO THE FIRST OF<br />
THESE BROAD APPROACHES. ,/ 2 </p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT IS ACTIVELY ASSESSING BOTH THE<br />
NEEDS OF CONSUMERS AND ITS OWN EXISTING CAPABILITIES<br />
IN REGARD TO MEETING THOSE NEEDS, THIS EXAMINATION IS<br />
PROCEEDING, BOTH PROGRESS AND PLANS FOR FUTURE ACTION<br />
WILL BE REPORTED TO THE HOUSE AT APPROPRIATE TIMES,<br />
CONCERNING THE QUESTION OF STANDARDS FOR THE<br />
SAFETY, QUALITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF CONSUMER GOODS,<br />
THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THE NEED FOR SUCH STANDARDS TO BE<br />
AT THE ONE TIME1 BOTH REALISTIC AND EFFECTIVE, -THE<br />
CONSIDERABLE BODY OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERTISE<br />
NOW EXISTING IN AUSTRALIA HAS MUCH TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE<br />
ACHIEVEMENT OF ACCEPTABLE BALANCES BETWEEN THE NEEDS AND RIGHTS<br />
OF CONSUMERS ON THE ONE HAND AND THE PROBLEMS OF MANUFACTURERS<br />
ON THE OTHER, THE GOVERNMENT WILL THEREFORE MOVE TO EXPLOIT THE<br />
CAPABILITIES OF ITS OWN SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES,<br />
VARIOUS DIVISIONS OF THE CSIRO AND LABORATORIES OF SEVERAL<br />
DEPARTMENTS ARE REPOSITORIES OF EXPERTISE ON WHICH WE CAN<br />
CAPITALISE IN FORMULATING SOUNDLY BASED AND REALISTIC STANDARDS<br />
FOR CONSUMER GOODS,<br />
THE MINISTER FOR SCIENCE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR<br />
CO-ORDINATING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CONSUMER STANDARDS<br />
AND HE WILL SHORTLY OUTLINE THE ACTIVITIES OF AGENCIES, WITHIN<br />
HIS DEPARTMENT, OF RELEVANCE TO CONSUMERS, ,1/ 3 </p>
<p>I PROPOSE SUGGESTING TO STATE PREMIERS<br />
AT THE PREMIERS CONFERENCE TOMORROW THAT THEY ASK<br />
THEIR APPROPRIATE MINISTERS TO MEET WITH THE MINISTER FOR<br />
SCIENCE TO DISCUSS* WAYS OF ARRIVING AT UNIFORM STANDARDS<br />
AND ENSURING THAT THE ACCEPTED STANDARDS ARE OBSERVED,<br />
IHAVE DRAWN ATTENTION OVER MANY YEARS<br />
TO THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF THE DEFENCE STANDARDS LABORATORIES<br />
IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SUPPLY, MANY OF THE ITEMS TESTED BY<br />
THE LABORATORIES WERE RAW MATERIALS AND OTHER PRODUCTS NOT<br />
GENERALLY OF CONSUMER INTEREST, ON OTHER OCCASIONS.<br />
TESTS HAVE BEEN COMMISSIONED BY PRIVATE ORGANISATIONS,<br />
THE RESULTS OF WHICH BECAME THE PROPERTY OF THE ORGANISATIONS<br />
CONCERNED, NEVERTHELESS TESTS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED<br />
OF PRODUCTS WHICH COULD BE OF INTEREST ALTHOUGH THEY<br />
DID NOT INCLUDE ALL BRAND NAMES REASONABLY AVAILABLE<br />
NOR DID THEY GENERALLY RELATE TO ALL PROPERTIES OF THE GOODS,<br />
THE DEFENCE STANDARDS LABORATORY HAS, FOR EXAMPLE,<br />
TESTED KITCHEN KNIVES, BICYCLE COMPONENTS, HACKSAW BLADES,<br />
HERBICIDES, SHOELACES, TOOTHBRUSHES, PENCILS, DETERGENTS AND<br />
CLEANING COMPONENTS, SUNGLASS LENSES AND FLOOR TILES,<br />
OTHER LABORATORIES IN THE COMMONWEALTH HAVE CONDUCTED TESTS<br />
PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO PROCUREMENT OF STORES FOR THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH SERVICE, THE COMMONWEALTH STORES SUPPLY AND<br />
TENDER BOARD HAS TESTED A WIDE RANGE OF OFFICE EQUIPMENT AND<br />
SUCH'-OTHER MATTERS AS ELECTRIC LAMPS, CLOCKS AND TOWELLING,<br />
MANY OF THESE TESTS WERE CONDUCTED FOR THE BOARD BY THE PMG,<br />
WHICH HAS, IN ITS OWN RIGHT AS A MAJOR PROCUREMENT DEPARTMENT, i S 4 </p>
<p>CONDUCTED OTHER TESTS SUCH AS ASSESSMENTS OF THE VALUE<br />
OF RETREADED TYRES, THE LABORATORIES OF THE DEPARTMENT<br />
OF WORKS TO GIVE A FINAL EXAMPLE, HAVE TESTED ANTI-CORROSIVE<br />
COATINGS AND FLOOR TILES.<br />
UNFORTUNATELY, THE TESTS CONDUCTED HAVE NOT BEEN<br />
IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONSUMER PRODUCT TESTING PRACTICE.<br />
MANY HAVE BEEN DIRECTED SIMPLY TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE<br />
WITH CONTRACTUAL SPECIFICATIONS AND OTHERS HAVE NOT BEEN<br />
DESIGNED TO PROVIDE COMPARATIVE RESULTS. THE MOST SEVERE<br />
RESTRICTION FOR CONSUMER PORTECTION PURPOSES ARISES FROM<br />
THE FACT THAT THE PRODUCTS TESTED WERE NOT PURCHASED FROM<br />
SOURCES OF SUPPLY AVAILABLE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC.<br />
TESTS CONDUCTED BY THE LABORATORIES GENERALLY INVOLVE<br />
PRODUCTS SUPPLIED BY THE MANUFACTURER AND AS IS WELL KNOWN,<br />
CONSUMER ORGANISATIONS WOULD NOT CONSIDER SUCH TESTS AS<br />
DEFINITIVE. THE LABORATORIES AND AGENCIES IN THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
WILL PROCEED WITH A REVIEW OF TESTS CONDUCTED IN THE RECENT<br />
PAST THAT MAY BE OF CONSUMER RELEVANCE AND APPROPRIATE<br />
FOR PUBLIC RELEASE.<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH PAINT COMMITTEE, WHICH IS SERVICED<br />
BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SUPPLY, WAS ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED BY<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH IN THE LATE 1940' s, FOR THE PURPOSE OF<br />
ENSURING THAT THE PAINTS BOUGHT BY THE COMMONWEALTH FOR ALL<br />
PURPOSES, GAVE A SATISFACTORY SERVICE. IN TIME A NUMBER OF<br />
OTHEF, COMMONWEALTH BODIES, INCLUDING HOUSING, AND<br />
D, CA,, A. AND A NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS AND AUTHORITIES OF 11111,,, </p>
<p>THE STATE OF VICTORIA, JOINED THE SCHEME IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY.<br />
IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE SCHEME THE C. P. C. ISSUED<br />
SPECIFICATIONS FOR PAINTS, TESTED MANUFACTURERS' PRODUCTS<br />
OFFERED AS CONFORMING TO THOSE SPECIFICATIONS, AND<br />
CIRCULATED AMONGST ITS MEMBERS LISTS OF THOSE " APPROVED"<br />
PRODUCTS THAT TESTS SHOWED DID CONFORM. EACH PARTICIPANT,<br />
WHEN HE BOUGHT A BATCH OF " APPROVED" PAINT, CHECKED IT<br />
FOR CONFORMITY WITH THE SPECIFICATION, ALL OF THIS TESTING<br />
WORK WAS SHARED BETWEEN THE MEMBERS ACCORDING TO THEIR INTERESTS,<br />
TESTING FACILITIES, AND PAINT USE; ALL RESULTS AND EXPERIENCE<br />
WERE SHARED. IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN AN EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE<br />
IN THE SCHEME AS THE CAPABILITIES AND FACILITIES OF THE<br />
MANUFACTURERS HAS INCREASED. NOW THE EMPHASIS IS ON<br />
REQUIRING MANUFACTURERS TO PRODUCE A CERTIFICATE OF TEST,<br />
FROM A LABORATORY CERTIFIED AS COMPETENT BY THE<br />
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF TESTING AUTHORITIES, DEMONSTRATING<br />
THAT THE PAINT CONFORMS TO SPECIFICATIONS.<br />
THE DEPARTMENT OF SUPPLY RECENTLY WROTE TO AUTHORITIES<br />
IN THOSE STATES THAT ARE NOT AT PRESENT PARTICIPATING IN THE<br />
C. P. C. SCHEME, INFORMING THEM OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS, AND<br />
INVITING THEM TO RECONSIDER, IF THEY WISH, THEIR PARTICIPATION<br />
IN THE REVISED ARRANGEMENTS, a to/ 6 </p>
<p>6.<br />
IN CONSULTATION WITH ALL RELEVANT AUTHORITIES<br />
WE WILL INVESTIGATE THE APPLICABILITY OF THE C. P. C. SCHEME<br />
FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION PURPOSES. THE TESTING PRACTICES<br />
OF THE VARIOUS LABORATORIES AND AGENCIES WILL BE REVIEWED<br />
FROM THE SAME PERSPECTIVE. THEIR WORK WILL MAKE A<br />
CONTRIBUTION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL CONSUMER<br />
STANDARDS SCHEME, I HAVE ASKED THE MINISTER FOR SCIENCE<br />
TO CONTINUE HIS INVESTIGATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF<br />
CONSUMER STANDARDS AND THE TESTING OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS,<br />
IN CONJUNCTION WITH RELEVANT STATE AUTHORITIES, THE<br />
RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WILL<br />
BE APPLIED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONSUMER INFORMATION<br />
WHICH WILL SERVE AS AN IMPORTANT RESTRAINT ON UNJUSTIFIED<br />
PRICE INCREASES,<br />
