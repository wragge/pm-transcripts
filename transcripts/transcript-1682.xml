    <content><![CDATA[<p>_ rC<br />17 OCT 19617<br />18 RA O<br />LUNCHEON IN HONOUR OF MR EISAKU SATO<br />PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN<br />PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA 12TH OCTOBER, 1967<br />Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt.<br />Mr Prime Minister, Your Excellen cies, Gentlemen:<br />It's a great pleasure on behalf of the Australian Government<br />and people to welcome our distinguished visitor, and shortly I shall be<br />proposing a toast to him. We welcome the Prime Minister and the very<br />distinguished official party which has accompanied him, and perhaps since<br />we are eating in a parliamentary dining-room, I can be permitted to give a<br />special welcome to Mr Nishimura, who leads the Prime Minister's party<br />in the Diet, and as a Prime Minister myself, I recognise the importance<br />of paying tribute to those who support us, Prime Minister. There are other<br />members of the Diet, members of the House of Representatives and<br />Councillors as well as the official party. They are all very welcome indeed.<br />This is the third visit to Australia by a Prime Minister from<br />Japan, and each of thEse visits has been a notable, and indeed historic<br />occasion. The first was by Mr Kishi who, appropriately and aptly enough<br />was the Pk~ ime Minister's brother, and I am glad to see the family tradition<br />maintained by him. He came in 1957. We welcomed Mr Ikeda in 1963, and<br />now we. have Prime Minister Sato.<br />He has been Prime Minister since 1964 but before then, he had<br />a very distinguished public career in a variety of capacities. Both he and I<br />had the dubious pleasure of being Ministers of Finance in our respectiVe<br />countries which estaliishes a bond of sorts between us. He was Minister<br />in Charge of Olympic Affairs, just to show how widely his activities have<br />ranged, and he has, of course, held many other high offices.<br />We speak to him on this occasion which is for us another notable<br />and historic occasion, because his visit comes at a very sigrdficant period in<br />the relations between our two countries. The past istbhind us; the present<br />is a period of mutually beneficial trade and growing co-operation in the<br />institutions of Southi-East Asia and the Pacific, and the future is an exciting<br />prospect of growing co-operation with a significant role for each of us in<br />the affairs of what is becoming an increasingly important and significant<br />area of the world. There has been almost daily awareness between our countries<br />of the increasing range of contacts. They range over matters of international<br />affairs, of trade, of aid, of sports, and in the cultural field, and so we do<br />find it especially pleasing, Prime Minister, to have another visit from the<br />Head of Government of your country after a four-year gap. 1 hope that as<br />the years go on, the intervals will become briefer. I look hopefully to a time<br />when it may be possible for me to return this visit, and I acknowledge<br />publicly with great appreciation the invitation you extended earlier to me today<br />and in which you indicated that the Emperor of Japan had personally joined.<br />It is a compliment which I value and I hope to find an occasion when it will<br />be mutually convenient for you to receive me.<br />I was in Tokyo myself for the International Bank and Monetary / 2</p>
<p>2-<br />Fund Meetings in 1964 and I recall then the impression of great growth and<br />activity which was so evident in your capital city at that time.<br />There are, of course, many reasons for the increasingly close<br />links between our two countries. We have broadly similar political systems<br />much closer, when I study them than I had earlier realised.: We have a<br />concern that we share together for the wellbeing of the region and its economic<br />progress. We have ourselves increasingly important and economic trade links.<br />We co-operate in the field of aid, particularly in this area of the world. We<br />have cultural links; we are drawing increasingly ourselves upon the traditional<br />and distinctive cultures of Japan. Our economies are, to a remarkable. degree,<br />complementary. We do compete in certain fields perhaps, but the notable<br />thing about the economies of our two countries is the way in which we can each<br />help the other. We are both democracies. You have an hereditary Emxperor we<br />an hereditary monarchy. We both have written Constitutions. There are two<br />Houses in both the Japanese Diet and the Australian Parliament, and I have<br />no doubt, Prime Minister, you have your problems with each of them.<br />Our Cabinets are formed of members from the Parliament. We share a<br />concern, as I have said, for the region. You lie at the north of it Australia<br />and New Zealand lie at the south of the Pacific Region.<br />Inevitably, and naturally, and most desirably, we are both, as prospering and<br />rapidly-developing countries, concerned with the wellbeing of our neighbours.<br />By 197C you may rank as the third industrial power in the world.<br />You are certainly on the ascendant all the time. You have, I think, the highest<br />rate of growth of national product of any industrialised country in the world.<br />We, for the time being at any rate, enjoy a higher per capita income and one of<br />the world's highest living standards. You apply a hig her proportion of your<br />gross national income to investment, but we rank, we understand, about second<br />to you, and we are at this time devoting a higher proportion of our gross<br />national product to international aid an~ d to the services of defence.<br />So all these similarities I have mentioned and our common int erests<br />in the past decade have brought our two countries increasingly close together<br />in many ways, We are co-operating in the Asian and Pacific Council. We<br />frequently discuss together in the United Nations matters in which we find we<br />share attitudes on many of the significant issues. We are both greatly<br />concerned with the stability of Asia because for us peace in Asia is a<br />prerequisite for our own wellbeing as indeed it is for the wellbeing of those<br />countries with which we are in neighbourly condition. Any State in Asia<br />that regards a high degree of instability and political chaos either in the rest<br />of the world or in any of the neighbouring countries around us as advantageous<br />to its inte rests represents a common problem for our two countries.<br />We, like you, hope most ardently for a peaceful settlement of<br />the conflict in Viet Nam, and we, like you, have regretted that a series of<br />peace initiatives has not been successful. More than forty in number have<br />been attempted from many and varied sources, and for our part, as I know<br />from yours, we will do what we can to promote a successful peace negotiation<br />for a just and enduring peace in the area. It is in the national interests of each<br />of our countries as it is in the interest of the wellbeing and security of the<br />people most directly concerned.<br />When the Government of North Viet Nam appreciates the<br />determination of the Allied effort and understands the price to be paid from / 3</p>
<p>-3<br />aggression, perhaps there will be real hope of successful negotiations<br />guaranteeing the independence of South Viet Nam.<br />You can claim-to rank at this time as the world's sixth trading<br />nation and you are on the move up in the ladder of international trade.<br />Last year you were Australia's best customer in terms of the value of<br />goods imported from us, and as you pointed out in our discussions in<br />Cabinet this morning, if you had not been, you would soon be in that position<br />because of the incmasing part that Australian production will be playing in<br />your own economy.<br />You are the largest buyer of our wool and our coal, of our iron<br />ore and concentrates, of our non-ferrous ores and concentrates, of our<br />unwrought copper, and our second largest market for sugar, mutton and<br />lamb and butter. You are the largest supplier of yarns and textile fabrics<br />to this country, cf-our iron and ste4 of fish products, and a major supplier<br />of motor vehicles and electrical machinery.<br />The ten-year-old trade agreement with your country, to which my<br />colleague, the Deputy Prime Minister made such a notable contribution, was<br />one of the earliest of our post-war agreements and surely the most<br />successful. Apart from facilitating important flows of trade in each<br />direction, the agreement provides for regular, and in our view, most<br />valuable discussions and consultations between traders and our governments,<br />and it is a happy circumstance that here with us today we have so many<br />members of the Japan/ Australian Business Co-operation Committee who are<br />making their contribution to this success.<br />Our countries are clearly bound to continue to have close economic<br />relationships, and by 1970, we confidently expect you to have the third<br />largest economy in the world.<br />Our many co-operative links in the aid field include shared<br />membership of the Development Assi stance Committee, shared membership<br />of the International Bank and Monetary Fund, shared membership of the<br />Foreign Exchange Operations Fund for Laos; we are members of the<br />International Bank's Co-ordinating Group for Aid to Malaysia and Thailand<br />and of its Consultative Group on Ceylon. Vle both have a very considerable<br />interest in the wellbeing of Indonesia which you visited so recently. We<br />are both members of the Colombo Plan organisation, both members of<br />ECAFE and both members of the Asian Development Bank. Your contribution<br />was extremely generous $ 20 million. We ferl that while this ranked with<br />that of the United States, Australia with a commitment of $ 85 million has<br />shown its goodwill with a contribution out of all proportion to our population<br />and national wealth.<br />It is important that the countries in our region should evolve<br />co-operatively. Aid is an important way of co-operating. We give aid,<br />in the words of the late President Kennedy " because it is right not because<br />we are looking for repayment or because we are looking solely to the<br />material benefits that can come to our countries". It is a gesture of<br />international -goodwill, and we believe it is accepted on that basis.<br />One of our great problems in making effective contact with you is<br />our language. You have done much better in that respect than we have, Prime<br />Minister. I have been somewhat humbled to find that you can communicate<br />with me in my language certainly to a very much greater degree than I could</p>
<p>-4<br />ever hope to communicate with you in yours. But increasingly Japanese<br />is being learned at Australian schools and universities, and I hope this<br />process will continue. Only today two new scholarships for Australians<br />to go to Japan are being announced one, the Australian/ Japan Business<br />Co-operation Scholarship is being sponsored by the Business Co-operation<br />Committee to which I have referred, and will permit a scholar at a<br />Japanese university to study there for one year. The Salonju-Hamersley<br />Scholarship will also provide a year's study for an Australian graduate.<br />And I hope this process will expand and increase because It is by having<br />well-trained, well-educated people from our two countries come to know<br />closely the circumstances of the other that our understanding will be<br />enriched and mellowed.<br />We appreciate your cultural contributions in Japanese films;<br />Japanese art and Japanese backgrounds are being used increasingly in.<br />cultural settings in this country. Increasingly we are becoming aware of<br />the richness of Japan's cultural heritage. The 1970 World Exposition is<br />to be held in Osakca and it is a matter of particular pleasure for Australia<br />to be represented there. We are sure that you will be able to draw on<br />many countries to support you, and this will be one of the notable events<br />in the cultural and economic development of our region of the world.<br />Your theme will be progress and harmony for mankind. We look forward<br />to participating in the exposition and we feel that the expositbn theme is<br />a fitting statement of our common purposes.<br />It is our firm object, and youars also, I am sure, to work together<br />with all men of goodwill towards the pr ogress and harmony of mankind.<br />We have a special contribution, each of us, to make in this region of the<br />world, and let us hope our friendship, our co-operation and our collaboration<br />will make a notable advance in the history of mankind in the countries around<br />us who are looking for the kind of leadership and assistance that we are<br />able to contribute to them. We could work for no better aim and we could<br />leave ourselves no better heritage.<br />And it is in that spirit, Mr Prime Minister that we welcome you<br />here. I ask my colleague, the Deputy Prime Minister, who has, as you<br />will be so well aware personally, done so much to promote good relations<br />between our two countries, to support me in the toast I am shortly to<br />propose, and then we will call upon the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition<br />to demonstrate to you that in the sentiments that we express, we are united<br />in the Parliament of this nation.</p>
