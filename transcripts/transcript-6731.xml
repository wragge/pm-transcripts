TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH KEN BEGG ON 11AM 20 SEPTEMBER 1985<br />
BEGG: Good Morning Prime Minister, welcome to 11AM.<br />
PM: Thank you Ken.<br />
BEGG: It would seem on the face of it that this is a package<br />
that gives more than it takes. Is that right?<br />
PM: Very much more. every cent that will be raised is raised<br />
from those basically who in one way or another have been avoiding<br />
their tax payments and we are giving that back and more so that<br />
the average taxpayer next year, in the first year, will get about<br />
$ 9.00 a week and then $ 15.00 a week for next year. And that is<br />
going to mean importantly that the extra dollars that people earn<br />
at work is not going to be raided so much by the tax collectors.<br />
They are going to have more discretion available to them.<br />
BEGG: No catches?<br />
PM: No catches, I mean, we couldn't be more open about it. We<br />
have faced a situation, Ken, where under the system that had<br />
been allowed to develop under our predecessors, so many of the<br />
high income earners have been able to avoid paying any tax at<br />
all or paid very little. That meant that the tax scales upon<br />
ordinary Australians have been kept high and have been coming in<br />
at progressively lower levels of income and that meant that the<br />
extra dollar that they earnt was more and more being soaked up<br />
by the tax man. So we have given fairness and equity and discretion<br />
back to the ordinary taxpayers by making sure that the free lunches<br />
and the tax haven dodgers are now paying and through them paying<br />
we are giving the money back to ordinary Mr and Mrs Australia.<br />
BEGG: It is going to cost you $ 2 billion to give the tax money<br />
back. Where are you going to finance iiHow are you going to<br />
finance that sort of money?<br />
PM: Well you are referring to That's the first one which meets<br />
the Accord so that we are going' to be able to keep the rate of<br />
wage increase down and therefore lessen inflation and keep<br />
employment prospects up. Now we will be picking up our ca'. pacity<br />
to do that in part-out o . artures that bc<br />
and also in pa-t out of fi... ca. drag. 7. nd t! at mL-ans tlhat e<br />
be imposing any burdens, it means that taking from thc top in1come<br />
earners who have been avoiding tax, we are giving that ncck in<br />
large measure to the upper income brackets who have just been<br />
paying too much. tax, the honest taxpayer. And, of course, in<br />
regard to the lower tax brackets, we gave them massive tau </p>
<p>reduction in rates last year when we reduced the bottom rate from<br />
down to<br />
BEGG: But the Treasurer talks about fiscal responsibilty, belt<br />
tightening in order to pay for it. Does that mean we are going to<br />
be in for more cost cutting, more razor<br />
PM: Oh no, it means that we have imposed a discipline upon ourselves<br />
that no other government has done. We are not going to allow this<br />
to be paid for plus wilc% 1t new expenditure programs and let the<br />
deficit blow out. We have got the trilogy imposing that constraint<br />
upon us. And that is proper, I think that's what the taxpayer wants.<br />
He wants government to say ' alright, we are going to bring the tax<br />
rates down, we are going to decrease the tax burden and we-. are going<br />
to at the same time bring the deficit down'. They want that to be<br />
done so that there is more discretion out there for the ordinary<br />
Australians to make their own decisions. But at the same time we<br />
will be able to keep the levels of real expenditures in those areas<br />
where people want them and necessarily need them. They don't want<br />
us to be cutting down in defence and education and those things. So<br />
we will be able to keep those levels up.<br />
BEGG: But we still will have restraints upon ourselves. Now one of<br />
the so called ' nasties' the capital gains tax. In five years of<br />
operation it will only net you $ 25 million. I wonder whether it<br />
was really worth all the political flak?<br />
PM: Yes, because you see the existence of the capital gains tax<br />
will mean that we will be closing off that avenue which has been a<br />
major area of tax avoidance in the past. People were just avoiding<br />
tax by way of income, they were converting that to capital and there<br />
was no capital gains tax there. Now this will mean in regard to all<br />
future assets) and as you appreciate, it doesn't apply to any existingly<br />
owned assets. But in regard to newly acquired assets, a capital<br />
gains tax on the real gain will apply and that will act as a bar<br />
to. tax avoidance in the capital accumulation area which had involved<br />
a massive distortion of investment in this country which was agains t<br />
the interests of Australia. It inhibited areas of economic growth, and<br />
therefore it inhibited employment.<br />
BEGG: You have hit your own Ministers and Backbench fairly hard.<br />
They have been treated fairly equally I suppose you would say. It<br />
does seem to me though they might have had a-case. They might have<br />
been hardl. y done by.<br />
PM: Well there is a sense in which the structure of the rernuneration<br />
of Members of Parliaments have been somewhat artificial. And now-.<br />
they will have to have the same processes as in the private sectcr-.<br />
That is in regard to that part of their emolument which is cash<br />
allowances, they are going to have to substantiate that. Now: for th'-7_-<br />
who can fully substantiate well then they won't be hit. But for ths<br />
* of them who can't then there will be a tax impost. But to their<br />
credit and I don't want to be partisan about this, I know th. ere olf<br />
have been unhappiness on the opposition side too. I have heard them<br />
complaining about what we are doing. But to be fair to Parlia~ entarlans<br />
on both sides, I think they will accept and agree that they can't<br />
have special rules -for thin as against th~ e Private sctlor. </p>
<p>* BEGG: Do you feel there is any risk in the fringe benefits taxes,<br />
* in the clamp down on the entertainment allowances, of jeopardising<br />
your relationship with business?<br />
PM: No, I think there will be some parts that~ won't like, Eor instance,<br />
taxing of fringe benefits in the hand of the employer, they won't<br />
like that. But there is much of what we have done that they will like.<br />
And they are approaching this in the context where we have restored<br />
business profitability to historically high levels frcm the low<br />
level that existed under the previous government when we came. That<br />
has meant billions of dollars more profits going to companies and<br />
that has been right because companies have got to have those profits<br />
to invest and then employ. So they are going to be able to meet this<br />
relatively light burden out of a significantly higher level of profits<br />
which have come from our decisions in government and our overall<br />
macro-economic policy. But the other point I make is that there are<br />
also some goodies. One thing that the business community, Ken, has<br />
been crying out for for years and which they couldn't get under<br />
years of conservative government was the end to double taxation<br />
of dividends. Now with full imputation that has gone. It has cost<br />
us $ 250 million but we think it is right, not just for the companies,<br />
it is right for the community that you shouldn't have the distortion<br />
of investment patterns that accompanied that double taxation of<br />
dividends. So I think the business community will have the capacity<br />
to take an overall view of this and see this as part of sensible<br />
general economic policy.<br />
BEGG: Finally Mr Hawkef you have been in a bunker, You have been<br />
in Cabinet almost for nine months. ' Vou have had a tax summit that<br />
has cost you politically, have taken a lot of flak. Wouldn't<br />
it have been better not to have had the summit, Wouldn't it have been<br />
better to have made these decisions......<br />
PM: No I don't think so. And you are quite right, It has cost us,<br />
being tied up in the processes leading up to the summit and then<br />
after the summit because we have been buggered in the sense that we<br />
have been here in Canberra doing the work. We have paid some price<br />
for that. But in politics I think you have got to be fair. I said to<br />
the Australian people in the last election, ' look, we have turned<br />
this economy around, growing better, doing better than any economy<br />
in the world now from being in its worst recession * for 50 years'<br />
But now the one thing that we have got to do for the long term<br />
future of Australia as well as immediate fairness for ordinary<br />
Australians, is to reduce tax rates to get fairness, to get a better<br />
structure for the allocation of investment resources. Now I believe<br />
that they are going to welcome that and they will see now that we<br />
have done~ r'job in the area of financial deregulation bringing more<br />
banks in, of having a sensible Prices and Incomes Accord, sensible<br />
monetary policy. The one thing that was left to be done to look<br />
after the future of this country was to get rid of the delapidatcd,<br />
unfair, regressive sort of tax system, regressive in economic growth<br />
terms, that we had. Now we have fixed that up. We have now created<br />
a basic economic structure for the policy future of Australia which<br />
will mean that we can continue to have the high levels of growth<br />
which put us far beyond the rest of the world and do that with<br />
acceptably low levels of inflation, continue to create more -nd more<br />
jobs, to bring an Austra1ia~ that your viewer wants, a f airer AuF~ tr:. 2.'-Z<br />
where the burden to distribute it fairly in a way which is goliny to<br />
maximise growth. And I think it has been worth the temporary price<br />
to pay to get that system.<br />
BEGG: Mr Hawke, thanks very much. </p>
