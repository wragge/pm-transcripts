PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA, THLE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
PREMIEI OF VICTORIA, THE HON JEFF KENNEYJ7, MLA<br />
HISTORIC REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENT SIGNED<br />
Today, I was pleased to sign Australia's first Regional Forest Agreement ( RFA)<br />
with the Premier of Victoria, the Hon Jeff Kennett MLA.<br />
The RFA for Ea# t Gippsland expands and consolidates Victoria's impressive<br />
reserve system. Almost 90 per cent of the East Gippsland region is public land,<br />
with 50 per cent of that land within a Comprehensive, Adequate and<br />
Representative ( CAR) Reserve System.<br />
Today's agreement is a milestone in Australian forest management.<br />
The RFA will give greater certainty of access to timber resources, providing the<br />
basis for investment in the timber industry and the creation of new jobs<br />
providing up to an estimated $ 140 million boost for the economy.<br />
The agreement is for the next 20 years and includes provision for a<br />
performance review every five years.<br />
The lead up to today's historic signing has involved extensive cooperation<br />
between the Commonwealth and State Governments.<br />
It is a welcome and positive result for the environment and the economy and<br />
illustrates that with sound policy it is possible to reach a balanced and<br />
responsible outcome in forest management.<br />
Today's signing ensures world class protection of wilderness, old growth and<br />
biodiversity. It provides for the ecologically sustainable development of forests<br />
within and outside the CAR Reserves. Faoxm0 3/ 02/ 97 10: 20 Pg: 1 </p>

The CAR Reserve System in East Gippsland meets or exceeds all the nationally<br />
agreed conservation criteria and surpasses international standards.<br />
Mr Ken~ nett said that " this outstanding result is largely due to the extent of<br />
Victoria's existing reserves and the State's detailed forest planning and<br />
management arrangement?".<br />
The State and Federal Governments will pursue options for complementary<br />
legislation to support the agreement.<br />
Both the Pr-emier and I thank the Ministers and Departmnental officers involved<br />
in the negotiations leading up to the historic agreement.<br />
The Regional Forest Agreement is a result of a great deal of hard work and<br />
commitmnent on the part of everyone involved including scientists, researchers,<br />
officials and coununity groups. It is also a credit to all those members of the<br />
public who took part in the extensive consultation process, workshops and<br />
public meetings.<br />
This is the first of many Regional Forest Agreements for Australia's forests.<br />
