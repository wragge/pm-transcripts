PRIME MINISTER 93/ 94<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
Premier Fahey's new plan for the so-called " greening of the Cahill<br />
Expressway" gives everybody an indication of the complete botch Premier<br />
Fahey and his Government are making of the founding site of the nation.<br />
Premier Fahey is on the record a number of times saying he knows the<br />
Expressway should go but he now wants to spend money retaining it and<br />
apparently knocking out one traffic lane for landscaping.<br />
If this Expressway is as important to traffic as he alleged it was when the<br />
Commonwealth Government proposed removal of the Expressway, how is the<br />
State Government now able to reduce the traffic capacity of the roadway?<br />
The NSW Government is apparently now issuing a questionnaire to Sydneysiders<br />
asking them how to beautify the Quay. No decision making just<br />
questions.<br />
The obvious way to beautify the Quay is to take the eyesore down.<br />
This hotch-potch proposed by Mr Fahey will not do anything to reduce the<br />
widespread perception that Mr Fahey's stewardship of the City is bereft of<br />
any of the vision needed to celebrate the foundation-site of the country as the<br />
new century and the Olympics approach.<br />
