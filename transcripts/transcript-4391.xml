L97IJ<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS~$ O JNJM N1AY. ' 19.7 7<br />
It is good to be in* Xaunceston--v-aain. The Bass electorate has<br />
a very special place in the-heakt~ of all Liberals.<br />
Just two years ago Bass Vot~ rs gave Australia the lead by<br />
electing Kevin Newman in a magnificent by-election victory.<br />
It was one of my first duties when elected Lecader of the<br />
Parliamentary Liberal Party to lead the campaign. That Win gave<br />
us all great heart, and rpuxred our efforts, culminating in the<br />
election victory of December 1975, in which Libea~ als won all<br />
five Tasimanian seatz in the House of Representatives, and which<br />
charged us with -the task. of restoring the economy and defeating<br />
inflation.-<br />
Our task was clear. To gain control over Government spending<br />
a-nd inflation. To argue for wage restraint, and to restore*<br />
confidence and strength to the'private sector so that employment<br />
opportunities would be created.<br />
We said from the outset this task, would take three years. But<br />
already w-, e are seeing the beginnings of sustained ' growth, and a<br />
reduction in inflation. The Consumer Price Index for the March<br />
quarter showed a rise of only 2.3% the lowest for a March quarter<br />
in four years.<br />
The most reliable evidence available to us indicates an inflation<br />
rate of just over 10% for the course of 1976. Still too high,<br />
but mark~ edly lower than the inflation rate for the precediftg two<br />
years, flut further progress will only be made if our policies<br />
are maintained. Vi! e have set about holding Government spending . in<br />
the next budget, and estimates for the comning year are currently<br />
being subjected to the most eytensive review.<br />
In successive national wage cases, the Governienf has argued for<br />
wage restraint. However, it is taking a long time to reduce<br />
unemploymnent becauge of high inflation, and the fact that rapid<br />
wage increases have priced many people out of the labour market.<br />
The extent to which Australians accept wage restraint will largely<br />
determ ine tlie ex~ tent to which further reductions in inflation and<br />
unemployment can be achieved in 1977. / in spite of </p>
<p>Ln spite of the severe restraints which we have had to impose on<br />
Government spendin-g, wie have taken a number of steps to alleviate<br />
particular probleras faced by Tasmania, and to sp) ur Tasmania's<br />
development. We have introduced a freight equalisation scheme which<br />
enables Tasmanian business to compete more favourabl. y on interstate<br />
markets. The estimated cost of the northbound scheme this financial<br />
year is almost $ 16 million. In addition, as I annotunced in George Tow<br />
last November, there will bo a southbowid scheme which will operate<br />
retrospectively from 1. July 1976. The minister for Transport,<br />
Mr. Mixon, will be announcing details of the southbound scheme<br />
shortly. The Government recently gave approval to IPEC to import two aircraft<br />
which will considerably increase capacity for the Bass Strait. air<br />
freight service. This decision has been challenged i~ n the High<br />
Court and we await their judgement. The Government also approved<br />
the import of two now replacement aircraft by air express.<br />
In Launceston, vie are proceeding with acquisition of the land for<br />
the Australian Maeritimeo Colleg6, and the interim counci. has, beent<br />
working actively to get this fine project. uncl~ r'way.<br />
We have granted a substantial stum for -the Inveresk Urban Redevelopment<br />
Scheme; an exciting initiative involving co-operation between the<br />
Commonwealth, the state, local government, and a community group.<br />
The Comonwealth is also spending more than $ 20 million nn the<br />
T1aunceston General fospital.<br />
In Hobart, the new Advisory Council for Inter-Governmental Relations<br />
is establishing i1ts Secretariat, and the headquarters for our activity<br />
in -the Antarctica is being relocated there. The Government has<br />
contributed $ 36 million to restore -the Tasman Bridge anid related<br />
works. We have also contributed to the internationally acclaimed<br />
south west National Park.<br />
We recog-nise that Tasmranian Industry has experienced particularlydifficult<br />
problems in recent times, and we expect to receive within e,*<br />
the next few weeks an interim report from Sir Beade Callaghan who we<br />
commissioned to inquire into the pzoble-ms of Tasmanian industry.<br />
I believe that the initiatives which we have taken after only 18<br />
months in office, amply demonstrate the Governi-ent's very real<br />
concern with the special problems and needs of Tasmnania.<br />
Taking'all the me-asures I. have referrcd to, Tasmania has<br />
benefitted by over $ 87 million in capital works and $ 17,000,000<br />
in recurrent expenditure from the special provisions made for your<br />
state by this Government. would </p>
<p>-3-<br />
I woul. d now like to turn to referendums which Australians will<br />
be voting on in 1H. days time. It is important that we talk about<br />
this because the success of the referendums will make a major<br />
contribution to the constitutiona. development of our country.<br />
It will establish whether as a nation we are willing to make<br />
constitutional chanqes which will introduce major and considered<br />
reforms to improve our constitution.<br />
The four constitutional referendums propose fair, sensible and<br />
just changes to reform the constitution anid I am sure that they<br />
will be successful.<br />
In the past, people have tended to vote no on constitutional<br />
questions. Blut these referendums are different. They do not<br />
seek more power for politicians. They do not seek more power<br />
for Canberra. They do not weaken the states. These referandums<br />
meet all the requirements Australians have set for constitutional<br />
changes. The proposals have been carefully considered. and there has been<br />
extensive consultation about them. There was detailed discasslor<br />
of the principles oIUall four referendums at the Hobart Constitutional<br />
Convention last year. The Commonwealth, al1 the states,<br />
local government, and all the major parties, wer e represented<br />
at the Convention. The principles of the four proposals were<br />
adopted overwhelmingly by -the Convention.<br />
The changes are supported on a bipartisan basis by all the major<br />
federal parties-. Each of the four proposals, we are now supportin
was passed in the House of Representatives without a single<br />
dissenting voice, and each was passed by an overwheLming majority<br />
in the Senate.<br />
Putting the four proposals forward is evidence of our concern to<br />
make necessary constitutional reforms, and of ou. r support for<br />
the cons titutional convention which was initiated-and this should<br />
be emphasised by the states.<br />
The people have to be allowed to vote on these proposaln which art<br />
generally supported and which are sound, otherwise the<br />
Constitutional Convention would be a meaningless exercise.<br />
S Clearly, -the issue of constitutional reform is more important<br />
than that.<br />
The four changes are thiese. First, that elections for the Senate<br />
and House of Representatives should be held simultaneously. It<br />
is simply common sense thiat elections always be held at the same<br />
time, and that the only time you have to vote in a federal electic<br />
is when you have to choose Australia's Government. This proposal<br />
will maintain and strengthen the Senate. It also means we will<br />
not have to vote in as many federal elections. Otherwise we<br />
could have as many as four elections in the next four years.<br />
If this proposal is not passed, the future of the Senate could<br />
ultimately be put in jeopardy. It is sometimes said that<br />
simultaneous elections can be achieved by bringinq the House<br />
of Representatives election forward to coincide with that of<br />
the Senate. Unfortunately, that is just not practical. At the<br />
last election, the two Houses were elected at thie same time<br />
because there was a double dissolution. Despite this, they are </p>
<p>4<br />
now out of phase once again. This is because under the constitution<br />
Senators terms are back-dated to the previous July 1. The term for<br />
the House of Representative!!( on the other'lhand only begins when<br />
Members are sworn in, usually some weeks after the election. This<br />
means that unless the constitution is changed, the only way to bring<br />
the elections together would be': repeatdy to cut short the term of<br />
the House of Representatives. . The., three year term is however<br />
already relatively short. One -of -th Shortast Parliamentary terms<br />
. in the democratic world, Fur~.'~ 94 n itwul amgrgo<br />
Government. Far from weakening the Senate ~ as some have alleged, the simultaneous<br />
elections proposals will strengthen the Senate and its capacity to<br />
protect the states. It was an'acc ident that in 1975 -there were bills<br />
enabli-ng the Governor General ,' to dJLp' 69hve both HIouses and make them<br />
both face the people. Had the -Senate not been able to face the people<br />
themselves, so that their act-ions might be judged, -a number of<br />
would not have agreed to block supply. This attitude was<br />
soundly based because auiy House of Parliament that sends another Ho<br />
to the polls, while not itself being judged by the people, will not<br />
survive. A number of Senators at the time knew this, and as grave<br />
as the errors of the forrmer Government were, these Senators were only<br />
prepared to use the Senate's major power because the Senate would<br />
itself face the people of Autralia and be judged. I myself would 0<br />
never have sought the blocking of supply from a Senate that would not<br />
itself have also faced the people of Australia. If the Senate was<br />
not in the position to go to the people, there would have been no<br />
double dissolution; there would have been no election.<br />
The Senate's powers are great, and anyone who wants them to remain a<br />
living reality will campaign for this proposal and vote for it.<br />
For unless the present situation is changed, I can foresee two<br />
alternative consequences. The Senate might refuse to check a bad<br />
-Government unless there happened to exist the circumstances whi ch,<br />
would per-mit a double dissolution. Alternatively, if Senators wereW<br />
to make the House of Representatives go to an election without facing<br />
the people-themselves, then there would be a public outcry against the<br />
Senate which could lead to the Senate's powers being restricted,<br />
or abolished. Either of these alternatives would be bad for<br />
* democratic government:, bad for the states, bad for Australia. 0<br />
That is why it is important that this referendum be passed. it<br />
will preserve the protect the Senate's powers and hence protect<br />
the states.<br />
The second referendum proposal is that, whenever a Senator dies or<br />
resign-s, he will be replaced, for the remainder of his term of office,<br />
by a member of the same party. This will guarantee that your choice<br />
of parties for the Senate cannot be altered by accident or design.<br />
* Proportional representation for the Senate is intended to make the<br />
Senate represent all sectors of the electorate in precisely the<br />
correct proportions. Yet under the constitution now, a Senate<br />
vacancy can complete) ly change the party balance. It is fundamental<br />
to our democracy -that only the people should determine the balance of<br />
-the parties in the Senate. Once this proposal is accepted, the<br />
peoples choice will be preserved tuntil they have an opportunity to<br />
make another choice at the next election. / The third<br />

The third referendum proposal is that voters in the A. C. T. and<br />
Northern Territory should have a vote in all future referendums.<br />
This is a fundamental right all other Australians have. I know<br />
of no rational or reasonable argument for denying Territorial.<br />
voters this basic right. -Territorial voters have the same<br />
obligations as other Australians. Ths% pay taxes, they are<br />
obliged to observe the laws of the Commonwealth. They vote for<br />
Members of Parliament. The outco 6ofreferendums affect them<br />
as much as they do other Austra ans. 7 Our democracy is the<br />
weaker until the voters of tle Tei-N tories have the basic right<br />
to vote in referendums resto ed to them'.<br />
The fourth and final referendum proposal is to set a retiring age for<br />
federal justices. High Court\ zjustices would retire at 70, and the<br />
retirement age for other Federal'C qr judges would be determined<br />
by Parliament. The proposaLAdqe-sno t affect the terms of judges<br />
already appointed to the 6ench.-There is thus no question of<br />
acting in breach of the existing judges terms of appointment.<br />
This proposal is only reasonable. Most jobs have retirement ages<br />
and for good reason. Judges are as affected by old age as the<br />
rest of us. It is only fair that after the age of 70 responsibility<br />
should be handed over to younger people. This is even more<br />
important now that the new system of Federal Family Courts have<br />
been set up.<br />
AlL four referendum proposals are fair, just and reasonable. They<br />
meet all the requirements for success. They have been extensively<br />
considered. They have the support of all major federal parties.<br />
They do not involve more power for Canberra. They will make the<br />
Constitution work better. The polls show that all. referendums have<br />
significant support in all states. But one of the things which has<br />
surprised me is that there is not a great deal of passion about thereferendums.<br />
It has become apparent that one of the reasons for<br />
this is that the arguments in favour of the referendums are so<br />
simple, straightforward and reasonable, that most people cannot<br />
see how contrar-arguments can be put. This view is well founded,<br />
but in it lies a danger. A danger of complacency.<br />
The referendums are important, to the future of Australia, to the<br />
P future of our political system. Those people who think the<br />
referendum propositions should be passed over cannot afford to be<br />
complacent. Although the rightness of the referendum proposals is<br />
not in question, except on the most specious grounds, the referendums<br />
will not pass themselves. All people who care about constitutional<br />
and political reform in this country have a responsibility to work<br />
for the referendums. If we all do this, then the referendums will<br />
be passed, and we will have a better constitution one which will<br />
serve Australia's needs more effectively now and in the future.<br />
The people of Tasmania have a critical part to play in the process<br />
of making the Australian constitution a better document, in the<br />
task of improving the Australi. an political system.<br />
In May 1975 you took the lead. I believe you will do so again<br />
on 21 May 1977. </p>
