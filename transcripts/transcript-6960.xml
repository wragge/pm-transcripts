TRANSCRIPTI OF INTERVIEW WITH DEPRYN flINCH, 3AW, 12 JUNE 1986, E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
Hi P resumably anybody who did what you had to do last<br />
nig ' would be disappointed when you see the papers and hear the<br />
rea~ ction to it, the rejection of a lot of the spirit of what you're<br />
saying?<br />
H. one would have liked a more fulisone response but I've been on the air<br />
this morning Derryn and 1 think the sound media has been very, very<br />
much m~ ore perceptive, if I may say so, I hope you keep that record<br />
up. But, people who were expecting a budget speech, where you were<br />
puLLiny out, setting all the details of the budget, simply had the<br />
wrong set of expectations. I think the judgemient needs to be made<br />
now In terra5 of the next steps that are involved, starting tomorrow, with<br />
the Premniers' Conference. And then with the Budget, and I've promised<br />
that the decisions will be tough and necessarily tailored to meet<br />
the challenge confronting the nation. Now I just simply have a<br />
great faith in the ordinary Australian people, I thihk they'll respond.<br />
Aind the other thing I'd like to say is it's fascinating to me to see<br />
the statements of the Business Council of Aus. saying, " oh yes not<br />
bad in some respects, but we're a bit sorry that the PM supported the<br />
productivity superannuation case" e they come out and say that now, but<br />
what they've been saying to us in our consultations is that they think<br />
that's the right thing to happen.<br />
Hi What you've done or your support for it?<br />
H. Support for it.<br />
Ill. . he main issue of your speech, sure ly9 was it aimed at the Australian<br />
people, * to say let's all get together or was it aimed with your<br />
eye over the International Market hoping that you'd breat-he some life<br />
into the dollar?<br />
H. A good question Derryn, and you have two markets. You obviously are<br />
talking to the Australian people and that was my main concern, talking<br />
to them. Obviously, also~, you're trying to get a message to the business<br />
community here and internationally. Unfortunately I don't think that<br />
they have been as pcrccptive as they ought to be in understanding that<br />
the policy and approach that I outlined is the best possible one </p>
<p>-2<br />
because if you doh't have the centralized wage fixing system and theI<br />
reduced real wage outc6me that I believe can be obtained under the<br />
approach I'm outlining, then the alternative is the free-for-all<br />
situation that's been advocated by the opposition whichlin their lastI<br />
year, produced 16% explosion in wages and that will be disastrous for<br />
the business community. Now I think gradually they will have the<br />
wit and the wisdom to understand that.<br />
sort of buried in the middle of the Age story, a comment that I found<br />
very pessimistic and a bit disappointing, was that you were asked about<br />
the reaction of the financial markets overseas in London and New York<br />
and you said anid I quote " I wuvld have to ask the international<br />
community what moxe can a Govt. do?" It sounds aS if you're almost<br />
throwing your hands up over it? I<br />
That was directly related, just to fill out the context in which I was<br />
saying it. in the areas in whioh the Govt on macroeconomic considerations1<br />
in the area under the Govt's control or influence what more can the<br />
Govt do. I said. There are areas that I referred to. one was the<br />
area of budgeWv policy, fiscal policy, now I said we are exercising<br />
in our processesq getting ready for the budget very.) very considerable<br />
restraint. Already identified a billion dollars worth of savings against<br />
Govt. programs and more to come, and we will be tough with the states,<br />
so we will bring in a budget which will be tough and then secondly<br />
I said in the area of wages which is a second importat-. area, there we<br />
don't set wages but we can exercise some influence, put a position<br />
and what we're talking about is a wages outcome of only a 2.3% increase<br />
in 1986, the only National Wage Case increase. Discount involved<br />
in the delay in this case, a further discount by no further wage increase<br />
till January ' 87, and then arguing for further discounts. So I was saying<br />
In that sense what more can a Govt do in these important areas?<br />
Hi Alright you've mentioned the states, getting tough with the states,<br />
I had Premier Cain-on a few minutes ago and, not exactly his words,<br />
but I think it-gives the message, he believes if you don't give the<br />
states the 2% increase that he believes they're legally entitled to,<br />
it will be the equivalent of you stealing from a trust fund?<br />
Hi. But what you've got to understand, and I know that John Cain does that)<br />
the components of Federal Govt. outlays to the State do not consist<br />
only of the 2% grant, the current grant. There are other areas of<br />
Govt. outlays to the state~ and I'm sure that John Cain does not delude<br />
himself that we're not looking at those areas.<br />
Hi Would I be right in saying that the " deal" if you can use that word<br />
-/ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
is they will get their 2% but they'll also have the screws tightened<br />
in making pledges over overseas borrowings?,<br />
H. Well) you appreciate Derryn that I'm not going to 90 before I meet the<br />
Premiers, I'm not going to talk about what we're g~ ing to be puttingI<br />
to them, that's not fair to the Premiers. The fair thing is to give<br />
them a good clear indication that weure going to be tough, -The details<br />
of our toughness should properly be put to them.<br />
Hi Alright, a different issue, one you raised last night about voluntary<br />
work for people who are unemployed especially young people. And I<br />
preface it by saying that I know that 14r Howe believes that I have<br />
contempt foi the millions of Australians who are in that situation, so<br />
he sdid in the House recently, but do you really believe that the<br />
way you outlined It it can work. You say that you want to have<br />
voluntary work, community work for yot# 5 people especially, who wan t to,<br />
and you quoted Priority one and say that's what they want to do.<br />
In your travels do you really believe that the young unemployed people<br />
now, some of them, many of them even really want to do community work,<br />
voluntary work?<br />
H. All I can say is that I met literally hundreds round Australia as I did<br />
hto( A1 CM-. 1 don't make things up Derryn~ whatever criticism you have of me<br />
you know I don't make things up, the talking I did vith the young people<br />
of Australia was that they overwhelninI. felt, firstly they wanted a<br />
job if they could got one, let me put a parenthesis in here, of course<br />
there are some people in the Australian community who don't want to<br />
work, I'm not saying there are not some, but-the overwhelming majority<br />
want to do something. And they said well if we can't get a job Mr Hawke<br />
in the ordinary market we'd at least like to do something for the<br />
community.. So our responsibility now is to sit down with the voluntary<br />
organisations with the States and local Govt and try and build up a<br />
bank of community work which the unemployed can do, not five days a<br />
week because they've got to be given the opportunity of continuing to<br />
look for work, but it's not something that~ being imposed. you seelupon<br />
what I believe is basically a reluctant constituency, I think they<br />
want to do it and I know that the community feels that it should be done.<br />
ty( te\. e as<br />
Hii Well I as A a Prime Minister that you're wrong. I believe there are a lot<br />
of people there who don't want to work, and I think in terms of the onev<br />
who do want to do voluntary work, and it's laudable, are already doing<br />
it or trying to, and you wouldn't know the name Allison Rooks-she's<br />
a young girl from Geelong she's about to lose her unemployment benefits </p>
<p>" 4-<br />
because she does voluntary work and the CES says she's not allowed to.<br />
M. Well 1 am not prepared-to accept that as the total explanation of the<br />
facts, if you would like or she wo ld like to give me the details<br />
I will guarantee to have that case looked at. I can't accept that<br />
the explanation that you give is accurate.<br />
H. deiibdrati misrepresenting gomething, but I don't think that that's<br />
necessarily all the circumstances.<br />
Hi Alright.<br />
H. I give you and Allison my undertaking that if she or youor she<br />
throughyou send me the details here at Parliament House I will have<br />
that looked at.<br />
Hi I can leave that one case alone, it's not fair to drop that on you,<br />
H. There's no question of dropping it, I'm just simply undertaking that if<br />
you send me all the details I'll have it looked at.<br />
Hi But if you look at it this way surely if young people, who you say the<br />
ones you've all talked to, who are getting unemployment who can't find<br />
work and some of them just can't find work, really want to do<br />
voluntary work, they'd be doing it there is plenty of voluntary work<br />
out there for kids right now, anybody any age?<br />
H. Well you say that but with respect to you Derryn what you've got to<br />
understand is these kids haven't got the opportunitythe capacities<br />
for communicating, identifying with the areas where you say these things<br />
exist. What we as a community should do is to say, we will organise<br />
the availability of community work, we'll accept as a comminity the<br />
the responsibility of doing that so that it can be identified to the<br />
young people, so that there can be supervision. What we want to do is to<br />
have a situation where~ while it's not work experience in the normal<br />
sense at least there will be some sense of identity amongst the<br />
unemployed with the community. The only nexus at the moment between<br />
this P6xmmunity and the unemployed is the sterile connection that<br />
exists when they pick up an umemployment benefit cheque. I want to see<br />
a situation where the relationshipthe nexusbetween the community and<br />
the unemployed is a much more positive one so that the unemployed can<br />
have the feeling that they do have a relationship with thetnmunity<br />
which is providing the benefit and vice-versa that the community can feel<br />
that there is some return.<br />
Hi Why wouldn't you make it compulsory?<br />
H. Because the realities are it'ssilly to talk about compulsion now when<br />
we won't have the opportunity at least for a considerable period of time<br />
of getting a sufficient bank of community work which would match the number </p>
<p>of the unemployed. i'm quite certain that as we build up this bank<br />
the problem will not be one-of compelling people to get in, I believe<br />
we will not have, certainly in the early stages, enough work opportunities<br />
to match the number of people who will want to do it. I've said that<br />
if much further down the tracklyou reach the position where you are able<br />
to create more commnunity work opportunities than there were there to<br />
be filled and there did emerge then an identifiable situation of<br />
people saying'no', not prepared to do anything, then I think at that<br />
stage the community would be asking the Govt to look at the question<br />
you raised. But it's an irrelevant question in the realities that<br />
we're facing, what we need to do, and what I know the community wants<br />
and what I believe the unemployed community wants is to get them the<br />
opportunities to do this sort of work. And that's what we're going to<br />
address ourauelves to<br />
Hi You* re well aware Mr Pm there' s a growing feeling out there in Aus.<br />
when you travel roulhe country one of thO-, I mean GovtS suddenly find<br />
-themselves confronted with one big thing like the Fraser Govt may be<br />
hit with one big thing that starts to grow in the community. Here at<br />
the moment under the Hawke Govt. after your second election out there<br />
there are thousands of ordinary working Joes who are paying their<br />
PAYE taxes and they look at what they conceive to belperceive to be,<br />
massive welfare fraud and they are sick of it.<br />
H. And I'm sick of fraud and may I say that one of the basic reasons why<br />
I want the Australia Card in, the best way of stopping fraud is to have<br />
an Australia Card with photograph.<br />
Hi I couldn't agree more.<br />
H. it will save us millions of dollars.<br />
Hi What are your chances?<br />
H. Well let me put it this way, if you have any influence with the Liberals..<br />
Hi I doubt I'd have anymore influence with them than I have with you.<br />
H. I don't know about that I wasn't implying that you did. If you can<br />
persuade the Liberals and the Democrats-that this is necessary to get<br />
the most effective-means of stopping social security fraud then that's<br />
whais necessary. My party, the Govt, has make the decision that we<br />
should have an Australia Card with photograph, for two reasons. one<br />
to ensure that people don't dodge their obligations to pay tax and<br />
secondly that we nail social security fraud. Now that's the best<br />
way of doing it and if people want that to happen then they should<br />
pressure the Libs and the Democrats to make sure that they allow<br />
that legislation to pass the Senate.<br />
Hi Yeah I go along with that. </p>
<p>L4/"
Hii You invoked last night in youv speech, you invoked the names of people<br />
likeDeCastellaJohn BertrandRen Lexcen, Joan Sutherland) and I agree<br />
they are not only heroes and achievers but out there there are<br />
thousands of unipmed Deeks and Bertrands etc etc but the argument can be<br />
put that by what your Govt has done in the past 2 or 3 years is that<br />
you are putting hurdles in the way of a marathon runner that you're<br />
taking the wings off the keel when it comes to people trying their<br />
best in small business getting them going, things like the fringe<br />
benefits packages, things like that.<br />
R. It can be argued. but it's argued wrongly because let's look at the facts.<br />
As a result of a combination of policies followed by this Govt<br />
business profitability, that is for large and small business, is back<br />
to the record levels of the late 60' s and early 70' s and far beyond I<br />
what operated under the previous Govt. So the combination of policies<br />
already there has acted to their benefit. So anyone who wanted to I<br />
argue it would be arguing incorrectly. Let me just give you, read to<br />
you~ from a letter that was sent to me earlier this month from a company<br />
in Victoria which gives you a concrete illustration of the truth of<br />
what I'm talking about. ( Read letter "$ 70M plant" CJ L)<br />
Now there's a specific example of a company writing to us saying<br />
thanks Mr Hlawke as a result of what you Govt has done this is what we've<br />
been able to do. You refer to the EDT akay, I'll take that head on.<br />
I am absolutely committed to a proposition that-we had to end a system<br />
where a very small proportion of the people in this country were able<br />
to avoid their taxation obligation, where the great majority of people<br />
the great majority of your listeners had no opportunity of doing it.<br />
And it meant that the great majority of your listeners were paying<br />
more tax because a small majority were able to get their remuneration<br />
in a non-wages/ salary form to avoid tax.<br />
Hii I agree with part of that Mr PM, but haven't you thrown the baby out<br />
wth the bath water? Because it's not only to get people who are say"<br />
hiding or getting their school fees paid or the big company car, it<br />
spreads across a heck of a wide spectrum. And people sotne in factories<br />
and some in Department Stores and some school teachers and..<br />
H. You can talk about the wide spectrum, and I'm telling you that as far<br />
as the actual recipients of fringe benefits are concerned at the maximum<br />
it was about 11% of the total wage and salary force. And that small<br />
proportion was imposing an added burden on the other 85-90% and that's<br />
not the way equity works as far as I'm concerned. The second thing,,<br />
remember this when you talk about the FBT. The Govt. is not going to<br />
get an extra net cent out of it. All the money that comes to the Govt </p>
<p>i~ i s.<br />
from the FET is going back to reduce the marginal rate from 60 down to<br />
49 and the other intermediate rates. We can't give incentive to<br />
people in the community, including people in thebusiness community<br />
the salaried area, we can't give them the incentive of very substantial<br />
reductions in their income tax rates so that they're Paying so -mucbout<br />
of every extra dollar in tax unless we make sure that we get revenue<br />
in and we get it in from the areas of people who in relation to the<br />
rest of the community were on a rort.<br />
Hi Then people on a rort, as you say it, that would also include the country<br />
policeman Lhe country school teacher whose rent in the State of Victoria<br />
may go up by $ 30 $ 40 $ 50 a week.<br />
H. WellI'm saying to you that as far as the implementation of the fringe<br />
benefits tax Paul Keating has worked meticulously, has worked<br />
assiduously, to listen to all representations about particular difficulties,<br />
a large number of adjustments have been made and in the overall<br />
approach I believe that he has done a magnificent job of trying to<br />
accommodate as far as you reasonably can while retaining a system of<br />
getting at those people who have been rorting. And as I say, without the<br />
income that you get from abolishing the Fringe Benefits we would not<br />
be able to be producing a result where the top rate will be coming down<br />
from 60 to 49 and the other intermediate rates will also be coming down<br />
very significantly. This Govt. cannot manufacture resources out of thin<br />
air. As I said in my Speech to the Nation Last Night, it's not Bob Hawke's<br />
or Paul Keating's or the Govt's money that we're using. it's the moeny<br />
of the people of Australia for their collective purposes and welfare.<br />
And we've got an obligationDerrynto see that that money isas generally<br />
as possible, raised as fairly as possible so that undue burdens are<br />
not being put on the majority by the opportunities provided to the<br />
minorities to rort the system.<br />
Hi well, I think despite what you say it's a minority rorting the system,<br />
and I think those people should be rooted out, but I think you've got<br />
a time bomb on your hands with the extent of the Fringe Benefits Package.<br />
H. Let me say this, that's your view. ll the research that we've undertaken,<br />
and independent research shows that the overwhelming majority of the<br />
Australian people approve of what's been done 6n the Fringe Benefits Tax. 1<br />
the research shows it. And it's not surprising when you have the great<br />
majority of the Australian people being ordinary PAYE taxpayers with<br />
no opportunity Lo rort the system they applaud a Govt. which is going to<br />
say we're going to reduce the burden on the majority by ensuring that<br />
a small minority can't rort the system. I'm not worried about the<br />
reaction to the IBT because the overwhelming majority of people are in </p>
<p>-8-<br />
Ct situation where they can't rort the system. They are Pay as you earn<br />
taxpayers, they go to their office) they go to their factory, their<br />
tax obligation is taken out under the PAYE system and they are sick<br />
and tired., as they ought to be, of knowing that over the years they'Ive<br />
paid billions more in taxation because a minority have ripped them of f.<br />
They support it.<br />
Hi Alright. One final question Mr PM and I ' said this was a speech<br />
last night both for here and for abroad, the reaction abroad was not<br />
good, I'm sure you'd concede that with a drop ift the dollar..<br />
H. Oh well just wait a minute about that. The international business<br />
community might have had some quite false expectations and had an<br />
immediate reaction to it. If they were expecting a budget speech in<br />
which we were going to detail all our cuts and expenditures, they were<br />
wrorty. And I think they will come to understand particularly when they<br />
start to see the evidence tomorrow of the toughness of this Govt s<br />
position, when they understand that what we're saying about wages<br />
will produce a significant outcome. I am~ confident that they will<br />
make the appropriate and the correct judgement then, that you've got<br />
a Govt which in the macroeconomic area is setting up a policy<br />
framework best calculated to produce the appropriate outcome.<br />
Hi. with respect Mr PM, it doesn't matter if they misconstrue it or if they<br />
have wrong expec tation s, they did it.<br />
H. ,,, irmnediate reaction, i am saying that I am confident that as the actual<br />
decisions are borne out that they will make a positive judgement,<br />
that's what I'm saying.<br />
Hi Alright, if it doesn't work do you devalue again?<br />
H. Well I don't think that's going to be necessary because I think that<br />
we~ have had the worst now of the massive decline in the terms of trade)<br />
because since June in that very short period of about 9 months there was<br />
about a 9% decline in our. termns of trade, I don't think that is going<br />
to continue. I think now, that provided there is the appropriate<br />
reactions from the business the trade union community and the Arbi Comm3<br />
believe in those circumstances we will have the right setting. I<br />
HI. One final question should you have made the s peech a year ago?<br />
H. With respect, a silly question mate, this speech is made because in the<br />
last 12 months the world by what it has done in regard to our prices<br />
that we get for our exports, they* ve marked us down in a way which has<br />
lost us three percent of our National Income, it is because of what's<br />
happened In the last 12 months that I've had to make the speech nlow.<br />
Hi Alright Mr PM I thank you for your time.<br />
