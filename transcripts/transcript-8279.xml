PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 12 APRIL 1991<br />
In line with the Federal Government's National Agenda for a<br />
Multicultural Australia, I announce today the implementation<br />
of the Community Relations Strategy.<br />
This will provide $ 5.7 million to fund practical programs in<br />
keeping with the objectives of the Agenda, released by the<br />
Government in July 1989.<br />
This is an important and concrete outcome of the Agenda,<br />
which now sets in train community relations initiatives<br />
targting all areas of our society.<br />
It is appropriate that the strategy should be implemented at<br />
this time when events in the Middle East continue to focus<br />
attention on racial and religious differences. I am proud<br />
that, despite some incidents of deplorable harassment of<br />
Arab, Muslim and Jewish Australians during the Gulf War, the<br />
vast majority of Australians clearly demonstrated their<br />
commitment to a multicultural society by standing firm in<br />
their opposition to such discrimination.<br />
The strategy has been developed by four Government agencies:<br />
the Office of Multicultural Affairs; Aboriginal Torres<br />
Strait Islanders Commission; Department of Immigration,<br />
Local Government Ethnic Affairs; and Human Rights Equal<br />
Opportunity Commission. During planning, these agencies<br />
consulted over 250 community organisations, together with<br />
Commonwealth and State/ Territory government bodies, and each<br />
agency will administer programs under the strategy.<br />
Practical, innovative projects will be pursued under the<br />
strategy tackling grassroots issues in areas such as<br />
legislation, police, media, youth, education and public<br />
housing. The initiatives being funded will involve wide<br />
sections of the community and government at all levels.<br />
I am delighted that community groups, Commonwealth,<br />
State/ Territory and local governments are co-operating in<br />
this initiative.<br />
While the programs announced in the strategy are scheduled<br />
for completion in 1992-93, this should not be seem as the<br />
end of the strategy. The projects being tested, implemented<br />
and evaluated will have wide implications for the community<br />
as a whole and for individuals, particularly those from<br />
under-represented groups for years to come. C-. </p>
