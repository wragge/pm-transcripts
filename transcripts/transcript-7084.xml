PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF SPEECH AT WELCOME CEREMONY, JERUSALEM, 26 JANUARY 1987<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
Prim~ e Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen. Thank you Mr Prime Minister<br />
~ d d 4<br />
for your welcome -pleasure for me to~ accept<br />
renewed invitation extended to me by President Herzog and to<br />
come here as the first Australian Prime Minister to visit Israel.<br />
This is appropriate because Australia has had very close ties with<br />
the Nation of Israel since the very prime of its * nception and I<br />
personally have had close ties . since my first visit here in 1971,<br />
and it is my hope as~ q~ Prime Minister that this visit, myself, my<br />
wife and those accompanying me will1 playi? part in further<br />
strengthening those ties which are long standing. Today,<br />
Mr Prime Minister, is Australia's National Day and it is appropriate<br />
for me to in those circumstances that Australia and Israel have<br />
this very much in common. It has been the dream, the aspirations and<br />
the endeavours of immigrants who have made our Nations strong.<br />
Relations between us span so many fields of cultural, scientific and<br />
cRc~ x V<br />
economic endeavour, but whatever rt-h-relations are in those<br />
fields. whatever the relations between Governments it is the relation,<br />
Mr Prime Minister, between people. between individuals which mean so<br />
much in the ultimate, to strengthen the relations . between nations,<br />
and in that regard, of course, there is a-special bridge between<br />
Australia and Israel. In the facts of the very large Jewish<br />
community that we have in our Nation, it is not possibleAPrime<br />
Minister, to describe in a short time-on this occasion the magnitude<br />
.2<br />
A </p>
<p>of the contribution that has been made to Australia by the Jewish<br />
people throughout our history, but it is a contribution which marks<br />
and sustains everyjelement of the Australian endeavour. Mr Prime<br />
Minister,, I look forward, with those accompanying me. to details<br />
&amp; constructive discussions with you and your Ministers about the<br />
issues of great importance in isreion~ f 1temtTT f<br />
bilater-al interest between-us and overwhelmingly, Mr Prime Minister,<br />
I trust that in the discussions we have, we will be able to talk<br />
about that issue/ of overwhelming importance and that is the question<br />
of securing in the future, peace for Israel and peace in this region,<br />
most<br />
and I know Mr Prime Minister, that we will be able to have/ useful<br />
discussions on that matter. I thank you agait for your welcome<br />
and I bring to you and the people of Israel the best wishes of the<br />
Government and the people of Australia. </p>
