PRESS STATEMENT NO. 118<br />
23 August 1973<br />
AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC SERVICE WAGE FIXATION<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, said today the<br />
Government was concerned about systems of wage<br />
increases which tend to give least to those whose<br />
needs are greatest and which tend to widen still<br />
further the gap between high income groups and those<br />
on lower and middle incomes.<br />
The Government has asked Mr. Cameron, Mr. Bowen,<br />
Senator Bishop and Senator Willesee to consult with<br />
the the Australian Council of Salaried and<br />
Professional Associations and the Council of Commonwealth<br />
Public Service Organisations on the appropriate procedures<br />
of pay fixation in the Australian Public Service.<br />
Cabinet has decided not to file responses to the<br />
present applications to vary determinations covering<br />
postal grades and the second and third divisions of<br />
the Public Service.<br />
