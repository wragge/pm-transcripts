<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, it's been a dramatic year, a long hard year</p>
<p>   I guess but certainly the economy has been doing extremely well</p>
<p>   given the vicissitudes in the rest of the world. When you got re-elected</p>
<p>   you said you'd be a different Prime Minister this term. What</p>
<p>   sort of things can we expect this next year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you are always different the second time around. There's</p>
<p>   no doubt the Australian economy, as you say, has performed very</p>
<p>   well. I don't think the Australian economy has been as strong</p>
<p>   for 30 years as it is now and a lot of that is due to the policy</p>
<p>   measures the Government introduced when it came to power in 1996.</p>
<p>   If we had not got the budget back into balance we would have been</p>
<p>   knocked for six by the Asian economic downturn. And the Australian</p>
<p>   public realised that and as we move into Christmas and people understand</p>
<p>   just how strong the Australian economy is and how lucky we are compared</p>
<p>   with the rest of Asia there's an even deeper realisation of</p>
<p>   that reality. </p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Of course it's not just luck, it's Jeff Kennett's</p>
<p>   friendly advice according to him. He's had a tremendous impact</p>
<p>   on your success in some of these areas like taxation reform.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, I have appreciated the support that Jeff Kennett has given</p>
<p>   and others have given to the campaign for tax reform. Most people,</p>
<p>   however, know that I have supported reforming the Australian taxation</p>
<p>   system for a long time and I have probably been involved in more</p>
<p>   attempts to reform the Australian taxation system than any politician</p>
<p>   on the current or recent political landscape. But I have certainly</p>
<p>   appreciated his support and I want to take the opportunity of paying</p>
<p>   tribute to Peter Costello's role as Treasurer in helping to</p>
<p>   put the taxation package together. These things are team efforts</p>
<p>   and one of the great strengths of the Government I am privileged</p>
<p>   to lead is that it is a very good team and it's an even stronger</p>
<p>   team in the second term than it was in the first term and that is</p>
<p>   becoming increasingly apparent in the Parliament.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Now, speaking of your Treasurer, next year we recognise could be</p>
<p>   a lot harder, growth will be slowing down as Asia and the rest of</p>
<p>   the world bites on the Australian economy. You have now read the</p>
<p>   taskforce report that you appointed to look into international finances.</p>
<p>   Are we still vulnerable to the kind of meltdown that occurred this</p>
<p>   year and what action should Australia take now in keeping the task</p>
<p>   of reform highlighted?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you should never be complacent and you should always press</p>
<p>   on with further necessary reforms. The reform effort is never over.</p>
<p>   There's never a point at which you can rest and say, we don't</p>
<p>   need to do anything more. You'd have to do it in a way that</p>
<p>   takes the public with you but the idea that there's a point</p>
<p>   at which the reform process is over is wrong and that's why</p>
<p>   tax reform is so necessary.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>But specifically on the overseas matters like the flow of international</p>
<p>   capital, is there something that Australia can take the initiative</p>
<p>   on.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Australia....we had an investigation of this straight</p>
<p>   after the election and there are a number of reforms particularly</p>
<p>   in relation to certain aspects of the activities of hedge funds</p>
<p>   that we have put to the international financial community. And there</p>
<p>   was quite a lot of support for them at the APEC meeting and I hope</p>
<p>   that in the not too distant future there can be further action in</p>
<p>   the group of 22 which is really a group of leading countries and</p>
<p>   middle economies such as Australia which cover geographically all</p>
<p>   parts of the world. And I think if there can be more concerted action</p>
<p>   we can smooth out some of the bumps that have occurred without in</p>
<p>   any way undermining the fundamentals of the global market system.</p>
<p>   I mean, we are not going back to controlled exchange rate system</p>
<p>   because if ever you have had an illustration of the advantage of</p>
<p>   a flexible exchange rate it's how it's worked in Australia's</p>
<p>   favour over the last year. One of the reasons why Australia has</p>
<p>   been able to adjust so well and to absorb without real damage the</p>
<p>   shocks coming from the Asian-Pacific region is that we have had</p>
<p>   a flexible exchange rate and we have been able to take the adjustment</p>
<p>   through our exchange rate. Now, if we have had a regulated approach,</p>
<p>   a controlled exchange rate, we would have been knocked around a</p>
<p>   lot more because the decisions that are taken daily in a micro way</p>
<p>   in a flexible exchange rate system just won't be taken in that</p>
<p>   way in a controlled exchange rate.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Now, you have been saying that your even more enthusiastic about</p>
<p>   your taxation reform. Now, on top of the recent survey that shows</p>
<p>   that two-thirds of Australians oppose it being on food, are you</p>
<p>   concerned by Brian Harradine's toughening comments about taxation</p>
<p>   on life's necessities?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Matt, we had a nationwide survey on the 3rd of October</p>
<p>   and the Australian public voted for our plan. I really think references</p>
<p>   to opinion polls and surveys and everything after you have had an</p>
<p>   election in which our tax reform plan was the main issue nominated</p>
<p>   as the main issue by both the Government and the Opposition and</p>
<p>   the Government's been returned. Our total responsibility then</p>
<p>   is to get it through and I am very committed to getting it through.</p>
<p>   I notice some reference in the introduction to the programme about</p>
<p>   further elections. Look, I am not talking about further elections</p>
<p>   I am talking about getting this platform through. We have just had</p>
<p>   an election so let me make it clear, I am not talking about further</p>
<p>   elections. I think the Australian public has had enough elections</p>
<p>   for a while but it does want the Parliament to pass the legislation</p>
<p>   it voted for in a nationwide political survey of the highest order</p>
<p>   on the 3rd of October.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>But if the Senate were obstinate enough to block having the tax</p>
<p>   on food you'd have no alternative....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Matt, I am not going to get into hypothetical situations, one thing</p>
<p>   at a time. We are positive, we are hopeful, we are reasonably confident</p>
<p>   about getting our legislation through. I don't take anything</p>
<p>   for granted. Naturally I understand there's a Senate committee</p>
<p>   process to be gone through and I'll go through it. The Government</p>
<p>   will go through it and we'll make all the information available.</p>
<p>   But, gee, we have just had an election let's not start talking</p>
<p>   about fresh ones. </p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>In the meantime, Peter Reith seems to have blown it with Senator</p>
<p>   Colston. How sneaky was that do you think enabling the small business</p>
<p>   unfair dismissal regulations to be disallowed over Christmas when</p>
<p>   he could have put it to Parliament?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it wasn't sneaky. That sort of thing has been done by</p>
<p>   governments over the years. If you've got a regulation making</p>
<p>   power you use it. And we used the regulation making power because</p>
<p>   the Senate refused to pass it in a legislative form. I don't</p>
<p>   think he's blown it at all. And the onus will now be on the</p>
<p>   Labor Party and others in the Senate when it reconvenes in February</p>
<p>   of next year to decide whether they are going to vote out of existence</p>
<p>   up to 50,000 more jobs, because that's what's at stake</p>
<p>   Matt. What's at stake here is not some rhetorical debate between</p>
<p>   the Democrats and the Labor Party on one hand and the Government</p>
<p>   on the other. It's up to 50,000 jobs.</p>
<p>PEACOCK: </p>
<p>Isn't the question here certainty though? I mean, neither</p>
<p>   small business nor the people who could be sacked know where they</p>
<p>   stand at the moment.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Matt, 50,000, up to 50,000 jobs can be created and it's not</p>
<p>   my word, it's the word of people in small business. Everybody</p>
<p>   talks about small business, how important it is to job creation.</p>
<p>   And here we're trying to do something to encourage small business</p>
<p>   to take on more staff.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Yes, but that's my point Prime Minister, if you'll pardon</p>
<p>   the interruption. On this programme a couple of days ago we had</p>
<p>   industry saying: well we don't know what to advise our members</p>
<p>   because quite possibly this will be reversed and they might get</p>
<p>   into trouble if they do take action.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well whose fault is that?</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Well surely....you're the Government, I mean, [inaudible]</p>
<p>   situation.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But Matt, who is threatening to strike it down?</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>So you're saying that because the other side's bad you</p>
<p>   can be bad too?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But how is it bad to want to create up to 50,000 jobs? How's</p>
<p>   it bad to implement a policy that you took to the election? </p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Howard, does it help if people don't know where</p>
<p>   they stand?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm sorry, please don't interrupt. I said before the</p>
<p>   election that if we won the election we would implement these changes.</p>
<p>   We have a mandate to make these changes and there are up to 50,000</p>
<p>   new jobs can be created and the Labor Party and the Democrats are</p>
<p>   threatening to destroy those jobs, the potential for them to be</p>
<p>   created, by voting down this regulation. Now, that's their</p>
<p>   decision. But there's been nothing sneaky, nothing improper</p>
<p>   and if only the verdict of the Australian people would be respected</p>
<p>   by the Democrats and the Labor Party in the Senate we might have</p>
<p>   some more jobs created in the new year.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, ABSTUDY has gone. Pauline Hanson wants it back</p>
<p>   yet the Minister says that nothing much has changed in that system.</p>
<p>   What has? Will any indigenous child be worse off next year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well what's happened Matt is that we're going to treat</p>
<p>   all Australians equally except where there is a clear collective</p>
<p>   disadvantage for Aboriginal students, they will get a bit extra.</p>
<p>   That's what's happened.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>And the republic. You've said that people shouldn't underestimate</p>
<p>   your resolution to campaign against the republic. So, you are not</p>
<p>   changing that [inaudible]?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well once again I don't...this must be based on some newspaper</p>
<p>   report I've not seen presumably based on an interview I gave.</p>
<p>   Look, my position on the republic is this, that I'm not going</p>
<p>   to be involved in a day-to-day campaigning sense. I've said</p>
<p>   that. I'm not going to be making statements on the thing every</p>
<p>   day. But I have a view on it and people will know that view.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>And will there be 10 questions?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Ten questions, no. There certainly won't be 10 questions.</p>
<p>   I think it's a stupid idea. I think it should be fairly straightforward.</p>
<p>   But, Matt, we're going to follow very closely what the Convention</p>
<p>   decided because that was the promise I made to the public and to</p>
<p>   the people who came to that Convention. I've said that I would</p>
<p>   put the Convention model if a clear consensus emerged for it to</p>
<p>   the Australian public. And that's what I'm going to do.</p>
<p>   I'm committed to doing that. I'm not going to alter that</p>
<p>   model. I mean, people are making suggestions that it ought to be</p>
<p>   altered, or it ought to be refined. We gave a pretty clear commitment</p>
<p>   at the Convention that we would put what the Convention adopted.</p>
<p>   Now, I feel honour bound to do that. There maybe some tiny things</p>
<p>   that are left to our discretion but what was decided by the Convention</p>
<p>   I'm honour bound to put and the members of the Government will</p>
<p>   have a free vote. I don't see myself being involved in a day-to-day</p>
<p>   sense in the campaign but if people ask me my view I'm duty</p>
<p>   bound to give it. I don't, incidentally Matt, find any great</p>
<p>   interest in the Australian community at present in the issue. I</p>
<p>   can't remember in the last six months one person, other than</p>
<p>   members of the media, raising the issue of the republic. It is never</p>
<p>   raised by Australians I mix with, and I mix with a very wide cross-section</p>
<p>   of the Australian community. The issue is never raised on either</p>
<p>   side. There is no great passion against it but equally there's</p>
<p>   no great passion for it. </p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>I guess the passion will be over cricket and the appearance before</p>
<p>   the Pakistanis this week, and next week you're on holidays.</p>
<p>   As a creature of habit, does it upset you no longer going to Hawks</p>
<p>   Nest?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, in a nostalgic way Matt it does. But we've been going</p>
<p>   there for about twenty years. We found that some sections of the</p>
<p>   media last year, not might I say the ABC, but some sections of the</p>
<p>   media last year rather over did it and spoilt it, which is a pity.</p>
<p>   So we've decided we won't go there this year. We're</p>
<p>   going somewhere else but for reasons I'm sure you'll understand,</p>
<p>   we're not talking about that. But that's one of the reasons.</p>
<p>   There are other reasons too. It's a great spot and we have</p>
<p>   very fond family recollections of it because we have been going</p>
<p>   there for the last twenty years.</p>
<p>PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, thanks for joining us. Merry Christmas.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Merry Christmas to you and all of your listeners Matt. It's</p>
<p>   been nice talking to you again.</p>
<p>PEACOCK: </p>
<p>Talk to you again next year.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p> [ends]</p>
