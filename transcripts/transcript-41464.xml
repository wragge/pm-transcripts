    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Hon. Barnaby Joyce MP has announced that he will resign as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, effective 8am on Monday.</p>
<p>I thank Barnaby for his service as Deputy Prime Minister and in his various Ministerial roles in which he has been a fierce advocate for rural and regional Australia.</p>
<p>The Coalition between the Liberals and the Nationals is Australia’s most successful political partnership, having endured for more than 95 years.</p>
<p>This partnership is undiminished and will continue to deliver opportunity and security for all Australians.</p>
<p>Pending the Nationals’ election of a new leader and consequent Ministerial changes, the Hon. John McVeigh MP will act as Minister for Infrastructure and Transport.</p>
