    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, Attorney General, Robert McClelland and Foreign Minister, Stephen Smith today launched the 2010 Counter-Terrorism White Paper, Securing Australia, Protecting Our Community.</p>
<p>The first responsibility of government is the protection of Australia, Australians and Australia's interests.</p>
<p>Since 2001, over 100 Australians have been killed in terrorist attacks overseas.</p>
<p>The threat from terrorism is real, persistent and evolving.</p>
<p>This White Paper outlines the Government's assessment of the threat from terrorism and how we will deal with that threat. It is the first such White Paper to bring together both the international and domestic elements of Australia's counter-terrorism policy.</p>
<p>Security and intelligence agencies report that, while there have been counter-terrorism successes, they have been offset by the rise of groups affiliated with, or inspired by, al-Qa'ida's message and methods.</p>
<p>Another apparent shift has been the increase in the threat from people born or raised in Australia, who have become influenced by the divisive narrative espoused by al-Qa'ida.</p>
<p>The bombings in London on 7 July 2005 - which were carried out by British nationals - brought into stark relief the real threat of globally-inspired but locally generated attacks in Western democracies, including Australia. </p>
<p>The hotel bombings in Jakarta in July 2009 remind us of the enduring international threat, and the attempted bombing of a United States airliner on 25 December 2009 reminds us that terrorist groups constantly develop new tactics. </p>
<p>In response to this developing threat, the Government will continue to ensure that agencies are appropriately resourced and practical action is taken to protect Australia and Australians.</p>
<p>The Government has made a number of important changes to the way Australia responds to terrorism. The Counter-Terrorism White Paper sets out:</p>
<p>- the establishment of a Counter Terrorism Control Centre to increase coordination across government agencies;</p>
<p>- new investment of $69 million over four years to introduce biometric checks for visa applicants in around 10 countries;</p>
<p>- a strengthened approach to aviation security;</p>
<p>- a strategy to counter violent extremism in Australia; and</p>
<p>- how we will ensure that our counter-terrorism laws both fight terrorism and protect the rights of all Australians. </p>
<p>No government can guarantee that Australians will be free from the threat of terrorist attack.</p>
<p>But this Government will take all necessary and practical measures to combat the threat.</p>
<p>This White Paper forms part of the Government's national security reform agenda.</p>
<p>It is a further step in delivering a safer, more secure Australia.</p>
