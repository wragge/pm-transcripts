FOR PRESS: PM. NO 44/ 1970.<br />
The Prime Minister, the Right Honourable J. G. Gorton, M. P.<br />
issued the following statement today on the death of the<br />
late Mr. Jim Fraser, M. P. for the A. C. T.<br />
Jim Fraser will be missed both as a man<br />
and as a dedicated representative of the citizens of<br />
Canberra. Although we were politically opposed I<br />
have always known him as a thoroughly good, decent,<br />
and able man. He had no touch of malice or meanmindedness<br />
anywhere about him.<br />
I am sure that all Members of Parliament<br />
will be genuinely saddened at losing him and I extend,<br />
to his wife, son, and brother our very real condolences.<br />
I hope that it may comfort them to reflect<br />
that throughout his life he did his duty as he saw it<br />
courageously and to the utmost of his capacity.<br />
CANBERRA </p>
