    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the President of the Argentine Republic,</p>
<p> Dr Carlos Saul Menem will visit Sydney and Canberra</p>
<p> from 29 March to 1 April. Dr Menem will be accompanied by senior</p>
<p> Argentine ministers and a large business delegation.</p>
<p>The visit is an excellent opportunity to build further the trade and</p>
<p> investment links between our countries. The business delegation accompanying</p>
<p> Dr Menem will include representatives from the transport, agriculture</p>
<p> and mining sectors.</p>
<p>Australia and Argentina are both strong commodities producers, with</p>
<p> fast developing manufacturing and services sectors. Argentine industries</p>
<p> are increasingly turning to the Asia-Pacific for new markets and Australian</p>
<p> companies are being drawn by opportunities in South America.</p>
<p>Australia and Argentina share similar perspectives on a range of international</p>
<p> issues, including our mutual interest in liberalising agricultural</p>
<p> trade.</p>
<p>I look forward to my discussions with Dr Menem, with a view to deepening</p>
<p> the relationship between our countries.</p>
