PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 7<br />
SEPTEMBER 1989<br />
E 0 PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, have you been advised of the<br />
New Zealand Government's decision on the frigates?<br />
PM: Yes, I have. The Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr<br />
Geoffrey Palmer, was kind enough to ring me earlier this<br />
morning and to announce that, by a good majority, the New<br />
Zealand Caucus had agreed to the proposal. That is that New<br />
Zealand will agree, on the basis of the discussions they had<br />
here last week, to purchase two frigates with the option of<br />
a further two.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think that serves relationship,<br />
given the United States mix to it?<br />
PM: Well, I think it's a very positive decision for the<br />
relationship. I'd made the statement that if it hadn't been<br />
that way, it would inevitably have had some adverse<br />
implication. But I do want to make this point, that I<br />
believe that the Government of New Zealand has made its<br />
decision on this issue on what it sees as the merits. I<br />
mean, I don't think it's been a question of saying ' well<br />
won't Australia be annoyed if we don't make the decision'.<br />
I believe that the Government of Mr Palmer has examined this<br />
very closely and has made the decision that it's in the best<br />
interests of New Zealand and I welcome it in those terms.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, when do you expect domestic air<br />
services to return to normal? This weekend, next week?<br />
PM: To normal? No possibility of them returning to normal<br />
this week. There's never been any suggestion by anyone that<br />
they would return to normal this week, but what I am<br />
confident of is this, that there must be an increasing<br />
understanding now on the part of the Federation of Pilots of<br />
the determination of the employers in the airline industry<br />
and of the Government. May I say of the trade union<br />
movement that the outrageous claims and approaches and<br />
tactics of the Federation are not going to succeed. I<br />
believe that this is having an increasing impact amongst<br />
former employees and that increasingly more of those pilots<br />
will sign up with Australian and Ansett and that that will<br />
mean that in the near future I can't put the precise day </p>
<p>PM ( cont) upon it, but I hope it will be certainly by the<br />
beginning of next week that some aircraft of the airlines<br />
will be operating in their own right. Now I hope that the<br />
pilots will understand, and I want to say this in as a<br />
constructive way as I can, I hope they understand it.<br />
Those are the facts, those facts are not going to change.<br />
The Government and the airlines and, may I say the ACTU, are<br />
committed to that position. I think it's relevant to that<br />
question that's been asked that I should address the<br />
development of yesterday where there has been this so-called<br />
offer by the Federation through its President, Mr McCarthy.<br />
Now that has been properly categorised right throughout the<br />
media and by the airlines themselves as a sham. Mr Strong,<br />
I think, summed it up very well. There's never been before,<br />
I think, in industrial relations history the position where,<br />
in a dispute, an offer to return to strike is regarded as an<br />
offer. No-one can take that seriously. But I do want to<br />
take this opportunity, in the context of your question, to<br />
address one thing that was said by Mr McCarthy in his letter<br />
to Ansett in which he made the outrageous claim, and total<br />
misrepresentation, that it was Ansett and the Government<br />
who, way before, had planned the shutdown of the industry.<br />
I mean, it's a manifest lie on its face, but I just had a<br />
little bit of work done to establish where, the<br />
responsibility lies and I would like to share with you that<br />
information. The Federation of Air Pilots has been putting<br />
out a publication, it's called Deadline ' 89. Fascinating<br />
document as you will come to see. it's been being issued at<br />
least since February, why, its issue number one was<br />
February. I just give you a few quotes from some of the<br />
issues of Deadline ' 89 so that we can see precisely who has<br />
been planning the shutdown of the industry and how<br />
meticulously they have been planning it. February ' 89,<br />
Deadline ' 89 ' Deadline ' 89 will be issued regularly and<br />
cover many of the questions that you . will have in the months<br />
to come addressing topics such as the actions companies may<br />
take in the case of prolonged industrial action, legal<br />
implications, Press reaction, how the strike will be<br />
organised, progress reports on negotiations of the company,<br />
historical information,. financial management and other<br />
issues that will provide a full dossier for you to refer to<br />
during the year'. This is February and that ended on that<br />
page with a resolution that the Federation informs the<br />
Government and all companies of its intent to restore pilot<br />
salaries by 1989 using every means available. Gets better.<br />
April Deadline ' 89. ' At some stage in one's working life<br />
the potential to face a non-income period ( NIP) exists.'<br />
well, that has its connotations, I suppose. ' Now may be the<br />
appropriate time for the more prudent pilot to review both<br />
long and short term financial arrangements. By careful<br />
planning beforehand, the full impact of such a NIP can be<br />
dramatically reduced'. And on the same page, ' Be prepared<br />
to adjust your lifestyle in the period leading up to and<br />
during the NIP, eg, eating at home is cheaper than eating<br />
out'. Then we have, ' Establish other employment<br />
opportunities. Many people have acquired a taxi drivers'<br />
licence-, many may decide this is an excellent opportunity to<br />
have a complete break from the house and go fishing, work on </p>
<p>PM ( cont) the car, start a lawn mowing business'. Great<br />
stuff. Concluding with this observation from Mr Terry<br />
O'Connell, Executive Director, ' A major reason for the<br />
stopworks being called was to inform you of the major battle<br />
ahead should the existing system not become flexible or<br />
pragmatic enough to remedy your real salary slippage.<br />
Should it reach that stage, then it will be a real battle as<br />
we will be fighting the Government, the arbitration system,<br />
the companies and all the vested interests. Pilots, by<br />
being united, have done it before and we can do it again.'<br />
I mean, the audacity of the Pilots' Federation in this sham<br />
offer they made yesterday, to say in the light of all the<br />
evidence, that the planning was by the Government and Ansett<br />
to close down the airline industry. It can be seen for what<br />
it is, yet another instalment of the incapacity of the<br />
Federation to face up to either the realities or the truth.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what does the dispute say about<br />
people's right to strike in Australia, to withdraw their<br />
labour, without being hit with massive fines or the sack?<br />
PM: It says this. That we have by the historical<br />
understanding of the Australian community, established a<br />
system within which the employers and trade union movement<br />
of this country are able to discuss, negotiate, conciliate<br />
and have arbitration for the resolution of their industrial<br />
disputes. And within that the right to strike has<br />
manifestly existed if you know anything about the statistics<br />
and the history of Australia. what we have in this case is<br />
a situation where a particular organisation, which is an<br />
organisation registered under the system, they have chosen<br />
to be in that system, which as they have said, they have<br />
used to their very great benefit. That is the history.<br />
They have been in the system, used it. They made a decision<br />
that they want to be out of that system. The Federation<br />
said, we're out. Now the facts are simply there, if they<br />
decide to go out then by their decision they expose<br />
themselves to the law which is available, not only to their<br />
employers, but to others who may be affected by their<br />
decision. But of course you see in this situation they have<br />
ceased their employment relationship.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are there any circumstances at all in which you<br />
or any of your ministers would negotiate with the pilots<br />
Federation? PM: The Federation is not relevant now. The Federation is<br />
not relevant now and not relevant for the obvious reasons.<br />
They have withdrawn from the system and as late as yesterday<br />
say, we will not operate in the system. Will not operate in<br />
the system. Now they have said that is their position. And<br />
the next point of course is that there is no employment<br />
relationship. They don't speak for the employees of the<br />
airlines because there are no employees except those that<br />
are signing up now. And let me say, if there is one thing<br />
that those signing up are saying is, have nothing to do with<br />
, the Federation. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: How many have signed up?<br />
PM: Yes, I could have guessed that it would come from you.<br />
Look, Mr Jull as the agent of the pilots in the Parliament<br />
yesterday tried that one. You think there is one thing that<br />
the pilots would like to know. Well two things. The pilots<br />
would like to know how many of their former colleagues have<br />
signed up and what the contents of the contract are. The<br />
pilots' agent in the Parliament tried that one yesterday.<br />
Now I wasn't through their agent in the Parliament going to<br />
give them the information they would dearly like to have.<br />
Nor am I going to give them the information via you.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, yesterday you said or raised<br />
the possibility or said that the question of recompense for<br />
employees, non-pilot employees of the airlines could be on<br />
the agenda. You spoke that they were in a unique position,<br />
unlike for example workers in the tourism industry. Could<br />
you elaborate just what you meant by that?<br />
PM: Yes. Some people have some difficulty in<br />
understanding, it's perfectly clear. The dispute is in the<br />
airline industry. It is the dispute in the airline industry<br />
which is threatening not merely to break the wages system<br />
but via that to wreck the Australian economy. So it doesn't<br />
seem to me that it requires a considerable degree of<br />
understanding or intelligence to understand therefore the<br />
uniqueness of the airline industry. There is no dispute<br />
elsewhere which is threatening to wreck the Australian<br />
economy. It is in the airline industry. Therefore one's<br />
attention has to be given to what course of action is<br />
necessary to ensure that the wages system and the Australian<br />
economy is not wrecked. Now I think that's a relatively<br />
easy concept to understand, it having been put. Now<br />
therefore what is the situation with-which we're confronted?<br />
It is this; that as a result of the dispute by a small and<br />
privileged group within the airline industry we are faced<br />
with that threat, the threat of a collapse of the wages<br />
system and the destruction of the Australian economy. Now<br />
the rest of the employees in that industry have firstly, at<br />
all times abided by the system, restrained their claims and<br />
have been an essential and integral part of the support of<br />
the system and they within their industry, in respect of<br />
their two employers or basically two employers Ansett and<br />
Australian in respect of their employment they are running<br />
the risk in their industry. But because of the action by<br />
these other people, the pilots, that they will be<br />
disadvantaged and would have the capacity in those<br />
circumstances if they were disadvantaged, to take some<br />
action which would in the industry where the dispute<br />
threatening the economy exists, could produce the<br />
catastrophic result. Now as far as other industries are<br />
concerned let it be quite clear, I and the Government<br />
acknowledge, I acknowledge, that they are being hurt,<br />
particularly in the tourism industry. The dispute is not<br />
there, the dispute is not in the tourism industry<br />
. threatening the economy and in that industry there is no<br />
complic-ation in regard to the dispute as to the stand-down </p>
<p>PM ( cont) procedure been used and it is being used.<br />
Employers in the tourism industry are standing down their<br />
employees and that action of stand-down does not in any way<br />
impinge on the dispute. The possible stand-down of<br />
employees directly working with pilots in that industry has<br />
potential implications for the dispute. Now what I'm saying<br />
is that in this situation the letter to the Government from<br />
the two airlines asking for these matters to be taken into<br />
account is, I am saying, properly on the table. I'm not<br />
saying what the outcome will be but for the reasons that I'm<br />
giving there is a relevance, it's appropriate for them to<br />
put that there. It's not yet been considered by the<br />
Cabinet, I haven't put it to Cabinet, but I have been open<br />
and direct in saying there it is, it will be considered.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it Prime Minister the fact that if Cabinet<br />
was to proceed down this path it would in fact create a<br />
precedent and if there were further industries where there<br />
were strike action outside the national wage guidelines<br />
which threaten the wages system then the Government would<br />
have to take follow-up action?<br />
PM: I am not going to canvass the whole range of arguments<br />
not because I'm afraid of canvassing the whole arguments<br />
but it's not appropriate to do that before it may be<br />
necessary to be considered by Cabinet. But I would make<br />
this point; that the airlines are this position if<br />
an employer was operating in a deregulated, non-government<br />
regulated industry and is faced with this situation, what<br />
that employer would be doing would be to make his decisions<br />
as the market would allow him to to increase his prices to<br />
the extent that he was still operating, to increase his<br />
income and of course in the case of the airlines they are in<br />
a regulated industry, both in respect of the prices that<br />
they charge and also in terms of the cost to them which are<br />
a matter for decision by the two auth6rities, the Federal<br />
Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Corporation<br />
which deal with landing charges and other affecting the<br />
industry. They are in a regulated environment where they<br />
don't have the freedom because the Government is regulating<br />
both sides of their equation. In a free market situation<br />
where an employer and another industry was not so regulated,<br />
what he would do. I mean it's obvious, it's not a question<br />
of argument, if he was still operating to any extent, he'd<br />
whack up his prices, whack up his prices, and he'd be<br />
totally free to do so. In this industry they don't have<br />
that freedom. They are subject to Government regulation.<br />
Now I'm not saying that that is the total answer to the<br />
question but I say it is a relevant consideration in respect<br />
of your question, is this precedent? Is this the same<br />
situation as every other part of industry? Obviously on<br />
that ground there are distinctions that can be taken into<br />
account. Now having said that, I don't want to canvass the<br />
issue any more because that's a matter which will be<br />
considered by Cabinet at the appropriate time. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Today's job figures, unemployment down,<br />
participation up. Is that another indication that there is<br />
no indication of easing monetary policy?<br />
PM: No, no, no. It's a confirmation when I say no, no,<br />
no, I'm not ending my answer to the question of easing the<br />
monetary policy but what I'm saying about indication is<br />
that it is another element of what I've been saying for some<br />
time that the signals are mixed. I mean you'* v e heard me say<br />
this in the Parliament and elsewhere and if you'd been<br />
sitting in the Caucus which you're not entitiled to you<br />
would've heard me saying it there. The position with which<br />
the Government is faced is that we are getting mixed<br />
indications about what the impact of existing policy is.<br />
There are a number of indications, particularly I would<br />
suggest in the . housing industry, which suggests that the<br />
impact is there and that there is the beginnings of a<br />
slow-down in activity. Now there are others which suggest<br />
that the economy is still growing at a fairly strong rate.<br />
Now I guess in respect of these employment figures one can<br />
say that very consistent with a still fairly strong<br />
level of growth. we now have an unemployment rate which has<br />
fallen to which is the lowest level since October<br />
1981. we have a participation rate I might point out, at<br />
63.4% which as far as I can ascertain is the highest<br />
participation rate ever. So we've got to feed these figures<br />
into the other indicators that are coming through. Let me<br />
make this point however, that looking to the basic<br />
foundation of the economy when you take into account the<br />
massive investment that has been taking place and the growth<br />
in the workforce, we are creating an economy which is<br />
basically going to meet the essential core problem that we<br />
have been facing. As you'll appreciate that problem has<br />
been if you look at the statistics of last year we had a<br />
7.7% increase in gross national expenditure and an increase<br />
in production of about 3-1/ 2% and that gap, that 4% gap, is<br />
filled by imports which we had a 25% increase in imports and<br />
if you want the essence of the problem there it is, last<br />
year, 7.7% increase in gross national expenditure, a 3-1/ 2%<br />
increase, production, gap gap filled by imports,<br />
increase in imports. Now what we're seeing with the massive<br />
increase in investment and associated growth in employment<br />
is the creation of an increasing capacity within Australia<br />
to meet our own requirements and to expand our export<br />
capacity. So it's in that sense where we take comfort and<br />
pride, I might say, in the fact that now with these figures<br />
we have created one million five hundred and forty six<br />
thousand six hundred new jobs since we've been here. our<br />
decision as to the point at which we relax monetary policy<br />
Will be made, as I have said consistently, it will be made<br />
at the earliest point which is consistent, responsibly, with<br />
the conduct of macro-economic policy, we'll do it as soon as<br />
we possibly can but not a day earlier.<br />
ends </p>
