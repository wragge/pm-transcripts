PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPLEASE CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY TU1E PRIME MINISTERj THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
WOMEN IN SPORT AWARDS<br />
BRISBANE 17 MARCH, 1994<br />
It is my great pleasure to be with you again tonight.<br />
Last year, I enjoyed the occasion very much.<br />
But it was in the middle of an election campaign. Elections are the political equivalent<br />
of the Olympics but, the pity is, they occur more frequently<br />
Elections have a way of making every living, breathing thing, including sport, political<br />
and I know that is not to everybody's taste.<br />
It is not to my taste, for a start.<br />
Tonight I can speak to you unsullied by politics, and at the end of a year in which the<br />
winds of' change really did blow very strong in Australia.<br />
There is a new optimismn around; in the economy and in the nation at large, I think.<br />
And in sport.<br />
Some pcople say that if the Australian cricket team is winning, or Greg Norman, or we<br />
pick up a gold medal or two somewhere in the world the whole nation lifts, even<br />
when the other news, the cconomic news, is not so good.<br />
But just now we've got them cycling together the Australian economy is flourishing<br />
again and so is Australian sport.<br />
So, if' the theory is true, in the nineties we should be able to lift enormously.<br />
In the last twclve months there has been no bigger boost to this very welcome<br />
phenomenon than the Olympics 2000 decision.<br />
It was a great boost to national confidence. </p>
<p>We are honoured to have with us tonight, Shirley de la Hunty, one of the few<br />
Australians who knows what it was like to compete and win at the Olympics in front of<br />
her own crowd.<br />
We are six years away now from having the opportunity to see that again.<br />
The night we won the Games in Monte Carlo will remain a highlight of my time as<br />
Prime Minister and a great memory always.<br />
But when all the work has been done, when the events are over and the crowds have<br />
left Homebush and all the competitors have gone home, the success of Sydney 2000<br />
will depend not on politicians or organisers or officials.<br />
The glory will belong to the competitors.<br />
What we remember about Melbourne 1956 is not the method by which the city won<br />
the right to stage the Olympics, or the extraordinary efforts of the organising<br />
committee to actually get the show on the road.<br />
We remember names such as Cuthbert, Fraser, Rose and, of course, Strickland.<br />
If you watched the National Athletics Championships on ABC television last weekend,<br />
you would have seen among the familiar Anglo-Celtic names, new ones like Costian<br />
and Poctschka and Capobianco and Van der Kuyp.<br />
On the same weekend, if you watched the one-day cricket, you would have seen a<br />
young man named Chee Quee scoring a century.<br />
If you had watched the netball, you would have seen a young woman named Avellino<br />
shooting goals.<br />
Look at an Australian sporting team these days and increasingly you see a microcosm<br />
of the contemporary society and in the energy and success they represent, I believe a<br />
view of Australia's future.<br />
The presence of people from vastly different backgrounds at the higher levels of<br />
competition embodies the principle that all of you try to promote that sport is for<br />
everybody. They should inspire Australian youngsters to realise that our Olympics 2000<br />
competitors can come from any cultural background, any gender, or any school.<br />
Their example, like that of the Cuthberts and Kilborns and Flemings and Frasers and de<br />
la Huntys, teaches this generation the television generation, the multicultural<br />
generation that sport is indeed for every Australian.<br />
These elite sportsmen and women are a permanent reminder that this is a society open<br />
to talent: open, in fact, to anyone who wants to participate. </p>
<p>They serve as an inspiration to people who want to compete at any level.<br />
I said at the beginning that some things are best left divorced fr-om politics. The truth<br />
is that athlctcs can do things which politicians can only hope to do.<br />
Politicians can talk until they are blue in the face about the need for the community to<br />
accept people of different backgrounds, and they might if they are lucky in a lifetime<br />
do as much for the cause of tolerance and reconciliation as Cathy Freeman does in 22<br />
seconds. A politician can talk about the need for women to enjoy the same opportunities as men<br />
and achievc less in a year than Betty Cuthbert achieved in less than two minutes as an<br />
Olympian. Or what she achieves every time she appears in public today, every time we remember<br />
her. It is not only because we bathe in her reflected glory: it is because she embodied then,<br />
and still does now, the enormous effort that goes into such success in sport, and to see<br />
it triumphant gives us inspiration and hope for our efforts in life.<br />
All of us need this example.<br />
As they make their way dceper into positions of opportunity and influence, and into<br />
spheres of our national life from which they have been too long held out, women need<br />
it. But men probably need it more.<br />
Men need it to remember what other elements in our culture incline them to forget.<br />
It will heclp men to remember the absolutely equal entitlements of women in the wider<br />
society if they rememnber their absolutely equal perhaps even greater contribution to<br />
sport. They have, after all, won I I of the 14 track and field Olympic gold medals in the postwar<br />
era.<br />
They do, after all, participate in broadly equal numbers.<br />
We can hardly define ourselves by our feats in sport and ignore at least half the people<br />
who have achieved them Australian women.<br />
This gathering is a celebration of women in Australian sport. It is a celebration of the<br />
great contribution that women make; of their central and equal role in sport at every<br />
level-of the equal part thcy have played as models and inspirations for the nation at<br />
large. </p>
<p>4<br />
As Prime Minister of a country for which the " fair go" is a by-word and tolerance a<br />
basic part of what it means to be Australian, I not only congratulate all of you, I thank<br />
you for the contribution you are making to Australia in ways that go beyond the<br />
boundaries of sport. </p>
