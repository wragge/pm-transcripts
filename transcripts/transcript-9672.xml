PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP, AND<br />
THE NEW ZEALAND PRIME MINISTER, THE RIGHT HON JIM BOLGER,<br />
DOORSTOP, WILLIAMSTOWN, VICTORIA, 22 JULY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PJK: Well, you all know that the Prime Minister and I both made remarks for the<br />
launch of the Anzac class frigate, Te Kaha. But I would like to just<br />
endorse the remarks that the Prime Minister made and repeat the remarks<br />
I made to and to say that I thought it was a very clear manifestation of the<br />
cooperation between Australia and New Zealand. The fact that we work<br />
together collaboratively on a single class of ship, like this, that bears the<br />
name the proud name of Anzac, the history of which and the culture of<br />
which we share says something I think about the modern relationship in<br />
peace and how we can develop ourselves, develop a defence capability<br />
here. How we can see technological spin-offs in both of our countries.<br />
How, by improving and building on our defence material capability, we<br />
can, at the same time, support other industries and while giving ourselves<br />
a stronger defence posture. These are all sensible things and I made the<br />
remark earlier, in the Cold War of course everything was internationalised<br />
and all regional problems were subsumed into the bipolarity of the<br />
Cold War environment. With its cessation, of course, we see much more<br />
obvious regional tensions in the world. You can see it in many places and<br />
therefore the solutions for these problems are tending to come regionally.<br />
In this region of the world, we have taken that lesson I think and we are<br />
doing things together and I was very pleased to be here on this significant<br />
occasion and very pleased to have Jim Bolger in Australia for the launch<br />
of Te Kaha. As you know, we have had a meeting together. We ranged<br />
over a number of subjects. CHOGM which the Prime Minister, of course,<br />
will be hosting later this year. APEC which we are collaborators in and<br />
where we have another meeting coming up to advance the Bogor<br />
Declaration, that is the Osaka meeting later this year. Of course we<br />
discussed the testing program of the Government of France in the Pacific<br />
and I think we have made it clear to ourselves, we are determined to<br />
maintain the pressure on France to modify its program, that is to desist<br />
from testing weapons and also to encourage further international focus<br />
upon France. We have seen the South Pacific Forum already exercising<br />
some substantial pressure on that country and as you know, the Forum </p>
<p>2<br />
will be also meeting later in the year and we will be having a continuing<br />
dialogue with Forum partners about how we advance that pressure.<br />
J: Will you be sending a warship?<br />
PJK: I will just come to that in a moment. And I think that probably covers the<br />
great majority of the things that we have spoken of. I would be happy to<br />
take questions, but before I do I might invite the Prime Minister to say a<br />
few words.<br />
JB: Thank you, Prime Minister. And can I repeat my thanks that I expressed<br />
at the launch that you came to Melbourne today to be associated with the<br />
launch of the first New Zealand Anzac ship. We believe, as I said there, it<br />
has been a very good project. There were a lot of cynics around that New<br />
Zealand would not gain any material advantage in terms of construction<br />
components being offered to New Zealand industry. We have, in fact, had<br />
a very substantial spin-off into our industry from the Anzac ship project<br />
and we think it has gone very, very well. The progress that we have made<br />
since the agreement was signed in 1959, I think, has been very positive. I<br />
think it has been an excellent example of a Anzac project, drawing on all<br />
those elements of Anzac, and I was delighted to be able to announce<br />
today that New Zealand will, in fact, construct a memorial in Canberra<br />
recognising the shared sacrifices of our two countries. But in particular, of<br />
course, the New Zealand component to that. So I will be very pleased to<br />
put that together, obviously in consultation with those in authority in<br />
Canberra. In terms of the meeting that the Prime Minister and myself<br />
have just had, as Prime Minister Keating said, we looked at the three<br />
major conferences coming up the South Pacific Forum in Papua New<br />
Guinea; then we will have the CHOGM meeting, which I will have the<br />
privilege of chairing in Auckland; and, almost immediately after, the APEC<br />
meeting in Osaka. And there will be some commonality and, of course,<br />
some unique elements to each of those conferences. Clearly, the Forum<br />
we both expect will want to take a* v-ery strong position in expressing its<br />
total objection to France on its proposal to recommence testing in the<br />
Pacific. We will also want to maintain pressure on France to get the<br />
firmest possible commitment and from other countries of a nuclear<br />
weapons state, on agreement to sign up to a Comprehensive Test Ban<br />
Treaty. That is what we must have if the world is to stop the proliferation<br />
of nuclear weapons and we have no difference, at all, between the<br />
positions that we want to take in terms of those goals. And, as I have said<br />
in New Zealand, that we also want to see the closure of the Mururoa<br />
testing facilities, so that there is no possibility of France coming back to<br />
test in the Pacific and the signing up to the protocols of the South Pacific<br />
Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. So, in that area, we can see some progress I<br />
think internationally. There seems to be a second wave coming through<br />
with governments and Parliaments around the world now taking a stronger<br />
position. Japan has come out very strongly in recent days in its proposal<br />
to seek a resolution from the United Nations and we would certainly want<br />
to support that. The Russian Parliament has come out condemning the<br />
tests. Many of the European Parliaments have and so on. So there is a<br />
second wave coming through of criticism, rejection, of the French proposal<br />
and we hope that President Chirac and his Government will be taking </p>
<p>some note of that. Both countries, both Governments, are certainly<br />
looking forward to maintaining the momentum that was in the APEC<br />
meeting in Bogor, where quite a historic agreement was reached in terms<br />
of moving towards free trade, or freer trade, in our part of the world. We<br />
want to maintain that in Osaka as well. Now those are the substantive<br />
ones. We obviously expressed our satisfaction with the days events and<br />
how they had gone and, you know I think in a very real way, underpins the<br />
unique relationship between Australia and New Zealand and just the way<br />
in which it was done there today, I think, is very practical in terms of the<br />
business of developing a defence capacity. But, I think, very symbolic in<br />
the way that the two countries have been able to develop these<br />
procedures. That is about it.<br />
J: Mr Keating, what specifically will New Zealand and Australia be doing to<br />
stop the French?<br />
PJK: Well we have already made, I think, well let me say, we have both led a<br />
substantial campaign against the Government of France in this policy they<br />
have, this needless policy. I mean I think the main object of both of our<br />
Governments would be as the Prime Minister said, that is to stop the<br />
spread of nuclear weapons. I mean the thing that matters most in the end<br />
is how we deal with the end of the Cold War? How we deal with the<br />
proliferation risk that the world faces from both the dismantling of old<br />
nuclear programs and also the much freer availability of expertise and<br />
materials, keeping the materials tight, keeping a check on the expertise,<br />
are all the things material to containing proliferation and the<br />
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is one of the ways that we can limit that<br />
proliferation. But actually dismantling these facilities and dismantling<br />
Mururca is just another example of that. In terms of how we go from here,<br />
as you know the Government of Australia has proselytised on this issue in<br />
Europe. I have published letters in French publications and we will be<br />
now I think with Japan making its point of objection clear, a number of<br />
other European Governments having done so, I think that President<br />
Chirac would be now somewhat surprised by the reaction to the testing<br />
decision and that sort of support I think we'll see how the debate goes in<br />
the Pacific Forum. But within the Pacific Forum, we may be able to<br />
advance further support, maybe for some United Nations resolution, some<br />
United Nations action on which Australia and New Zealand participates.<br />
J: Will you send a navy ship up to Mururoa?<br />
PJK: No, we thought about this originally. You send navy ships when you want<br />
navy ships to do naval things. And I don't think any of us want this on this<br />
occasion.<br />
J: Will you join New Zealand in going to the World Court?<br />
PJK: Well I didn't know that New Zealand was necessarily going to the World<br />
Court and we have looked at some of the issues with the International<br />
Court of Justice. But there are two matters. One, it is not certain whether<br />
or not any proceedings could be dealt with before the testing program was<br />
completed. And, secondly, where the law of the matter lay. </p>
<p>JB: Can I just say on that for the Australian journalists perhaps. We are<br />
looking at the details of how a case might be taken to the World Court and<br />
I am working in collaboration with the other political parties in<br />
New Zealand. But it is a very narrow opportunity and it may not be<br />
possible and I think from what I have heard, the Australians who already<br />
looked at this prospect have found it a difficult one to fight. Just to find the<br />
legal standing to take a case that will have some weight. But we are still<br />
pursuing that and, if it is possible, we will. But we have to determine that<br />
there is a realistic prospect there.<br />
J: Mr Keating, how disappointed would Australia be if New Zealand did not<br />
exercise its options to buy frigates 3 and 4?<br />
PJK: Well this is for the Government of New Zealand, exclusively, to think<br />
about. In terms of its defence procurement program over time and, of<br />
course, that is some time out from here. There was no need and isn't a<br />
need at this point to be coming to any resolution about that. But I think,<br />
you know, the obvious point I would make and the Prime Minister in a<br />
sense has joined me in this today, as we have a single class ship which<br />
we are building together. So whatever option there is for New Zealand to<br />
purchase ships in the future, this is obviously a strong point of the Anzac<br />
program. But, again, that has got to be seen against the background of its<br />
own defence force requirements and its own procurement program.<br />
J: Prime Minister Keating, are you concerned with signals sent out yesterday<br />
by the French Ambassador in Wellington that France is unwilling to sign<br />
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and that there might be more than<br />
eight tests in actual fact?<br />
PJK: I didn't see that.<br />
JB: If the Prime Minister hasn't seen it, I think we should say there seems to<br />
be some confusion as to the message the Ambassador to Wellington was<br />
conveying. In the morning it seemed to be a very considerable measure<br />
of doubt as to whether France, if there wasn't a Comprehensive Test Ban<br />
Treaty, wouldn't actually just continue to test. In fact there seemed to be<br />
some enthusiasm in the presentation from the Ambassador that France<br />
would want to test. But, by the end of the day, they had released a<br />
statement to clarify, or to re-state, that they only had intention for eight<br />
and they would sign up to the Test Ban Treaty. So I am really saying I<br />
think there has been some quite confused message come from the French<br />
Ambassador based into Wellington.<br />
J: Are you satisfied by that [ inaudible]?<br />
JB: Well I made my view very clear early yesterday that we would be<br />
astonished and we would be outraged if there was a suggestion that there<br />
was going to be any additional testing. We are totally outraged there is<br />
going to be eight and if that isn't a firm position, then it would be a worse<br />
position. But I have some surmised that, in fact, the Ambassador's </p>
<p>presentation may have been inaccurate in the morning and hence the<br />
correction later in the day.<br />
J: Mr Keating, the New Zealand Government is saying that it wants no more<br />
[ inaudible} in relation to the CTBT, whereas I understand that<br />
Australia's position is to support the possibility of micro-yield or so-called<br />
bench top tests? If that is correct what is the rationale for Australia?<br />
PJK: Well I don't think we have yet articulated what elements we would like to<br />
see in a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Although, we have very clear<br />
ideas about it. I think that we would like to see is, that we see the<br />
post-Cold War era as an opportunity to rein in the proliferation risk and<br />
that comes by way of testing weapons. But also, as I said earlier, the<br />
diversion of materials and expertise. What is particularly objectionable<br />
about France is that it is a democracy. This is not a totalitarian regime, or<br />
a military regime, doing this or testing within its own metropolitan area.<br />
This is a democracy affronting other smaller States distant from it. That is<br />
the essential point of objection. Beyond that is the notion that right when<br />
we are all trying to get a better non-proliferation regime, when this historic<br />
opportunity has arisen at the end of the Cold War, a democracy is out<br />
there testing weapons. I mean that is the problem and that is what we<br />
object to. The French have as great an interest, a greater interest, than<br />
we have in fact in seeing these proliferation risks diminished, given the<br />
fact that they are situated in an area where there are a lot of weapons<br />
battlefield weapons and strategic weapons. And, not only that, there are<br />
14 reactors of the same design as Chernobyl sitting in the Ukraine and in<br />
other parts of Russia, which have inherent design faults which are going<br />
to have to be overhauled and decommissioned and there is no way those<br />
States are going to go to coal or other fossil fuels. So there is going to<br />
have to be a replacement reactor program. Now that is something the<br />
Government of France, and all the West European Governments for that<br />
matter, have got to deal with. So it is these sorts of issues that go beyond<br />
simply a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It goes to the opportunity and<br />
a democracy flouting the opportunity.<br />
J: But you are not ruling out the possibility that Australia would allow the<br />
with some degree of physical testing?<br />
PJK: Well I am not answering the question at all. I am not here to discuss<br />
design issues in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty whatsoever.<br />
J: Was there any discussion on John Major's response to the nuclear testing<br />
issue and what pressure Australia and New Zealand, combined, might<br />
bear on Britain to speak up?<br />
JB: I just noted in our discussion, Catherine, that Prime Minister Major had not<br />
come out. Whereas a number of European Governments had come out<br />
strongly against the French position and I presume the reason is that he is<br />
also, of course, the leader of a nuclear power. They have their own<br />
nuclear facility. But no as I said before I am disappointed that John Major<br />
hasn't come out, but I have to say that Prime Minister Keating and myself<br />
didn't spend much time on that at all. </p>
<p>Malaysian journalist]. This collaborative venture represented by this<br />
Anzac project breaks some new ground in this part of the world.<br />
Transfield is proposing to do the same thing between the Australian and<br />
Malaysian navies. Can I ask the assessment of both of you what this<br />
means in terms of industry collaboration and what this collaboration can<br />
contribute to its regional defence and regional security and its regional<br />
relations?<br />
PJK: Well maybe, perhaps, I will begin. The obvious thing is that we would<br />
have a regional core naval design construction and repair facility, which<br />
means that any defence arrangements within the region must be stronger<br />
if the vessels are designed for tropical waters, if they are designed to<br />
suit our particular naval requirements and their weapons systems and<br />
their repair are not subject to long voyages to other countries of origin<br />
obviously, it is stronger here. And I think we would see any program with<br />
Malaysia being an adjunct to that sort of strength. And I think Prime<br />
Minister Bolger will attest to the fact that we are seeing a fairly broad<br />
spread of capability here. He made in his public remarks, references to<br />
New Zealand industry for instance, the spin-off for New Zealand industry<br />
from this program. There would be, of course, a similar spin-off for<br />
Malaysia and we would all be the better for having a stronger naval design<br />
and construction capability in this part of the world, in this region of the<br />
world. So I think we are seeing something new. We are seeing the very<br />
clear development of this facility and, of course, in Australia's case we<br />
have also got the submarine facility in South Australia, where we are now<br />
completing these 3,500 tonne, state-of-the-art, world class submarines.<br />
So together we are building some real capacity and, of. course, were<br />
Malaysia to choose the Australian design, then it too would benefit from<br />
these arrangements.<br />
JB: I think the judgement we have made-has gone very well, as I said earlier.<br />
The New Zealand participation has been positive, it has been significant<br />
so the work that has come back to New Zealand firms has been across a<br />
range of areas and quite large in terms of the size of the contracts that<br />
have been put into New Zealand. So all I can say is that from a New<br />
Zealand perspective, working with Transfield here in Melbourne, we have<br />
had a good relationship, our industry has had a good relationship.<br />
Last question.<br />
JB: Yes, I want to go and see the rugby.<br />
J: Was there any discussion on the civil aviation market?<br />
JB: Very briefly and in essence we agreed that if the two commercial<br />
operators that are in discussion, which is Ansett Australia and<br />
Air New Zealand, can find a commercial resolution that makes sense to<br />
them, we would both welcome it. That is where it is.<br />
J: Mr Bolger, are you happy about the degree of cooperation between New<br />
Zealand and Australia on the nuclear testing issue? </p>
<p>JB: Yes I am. I have had no difficulty at all with it and I feel certain, following<br />
our discussions today, that we are going to see that cooperation move<br />
forward in the various forums that are open to us to advance the objection<br />
of this part of the world, but really I think the objection of the world, or the<br />
great majority of the world opposes France breaking its moratorium and<br />
recommencing nuclear testing. I am absolutely certain that is true. The<br />
great majority, overwhelming majority of the world, wants to see a halt to<br />
the proliferation of nuclear weapons. You only have to reflect back a few<br />
months at the concern, almost fear, that has been generated at the<br />
prospect that North Korea was going to develop nuclear weapons. The<br />
only way we can prevent that is in fact to have a very strong test ban<br />
treaty and for the nuclear weapons states to continue with a program of<br />
reducing their nuclear arms and that is what we want to see happen. We<br />
don't have any difficulty in pursuing that in tandem, wherever the options<br />
are open to us to pursue it in tandem. Don't you reckon we should go and<br />
see the rugby?<br />
PJK: Thank you indeed.<br />
JB: That will be the biggest battle of the day. Win it for us, well I have said I<br />
think the All Blacks will be about ten in front, but Paul has got a different<br />
view.<br />
J: What is that Mr Keating?<br />
PJK: Well what do you expect me to say.<br />
JB: I mean the All Blacks have now got to sort of lift New Zealand's honour<br />
after the Australian netballers beat the New Zealand netball team by one<br />
goal yesterday. I mean I am sorry, Paul, we have got to win this one, we<br />
are under some pressure now.<br />
PJK: You have had too many wins lately.<br />
JB: Thank you all.<br />
PJK: Thank you.<br />
