TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER TiE 1I0N PJ. KEATIG, MP<br />
JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH SENATOR THE HON PETER COOK,<br />
MINISTER FOR INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, CANBERRA, 2 DECEMBER 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: All right we might make a start. Over the last couple of months, the last eight<br />
weeks or so the Comnmonwealth Government has become increasingly concerned<br />
about the threat to recovery in Victoria, which is about thirty per cent of the<br />
national economy, which has been occasioned by the industrial relations policies<br />
of the Kennett Government which is, of course, running on the agenda of the<br />
Hewson lead Opposition in Canberra. This is not just a threat to the recovery, but<br />
indeed to social cohesion in Victoria and which has put at risk the operation of the<br />
flexible structure of enterprise bargaining which the Commonwealth Government<br />
has put in place and where just now in the space of six months we've seen over 550<br />
enterprise agreements negotiated for higher remuneration and better productivity<br />
without rancour and which is the key to Australia's productivity advance.<br />
The Government has always taken the view that successful economics have a<br />
value system of co-operation and one where reform and competition takes place<br />
within that co-opcrativc framework. This has been abandoned by the Liberal<br />
party in Victoria and by the Federal Opposition. Instead they prefer the old master<br />
and servant relationship and are now relying upon and will rely upon the master<br />
and servant provisions of the common law. One should havo thought that in the<br />
lattcr part of the twentieth century Premier Kennett and his Liberal party<br />
colicagucs would have understood that the mature relationship which exists in<br />
industrial Australia today could no longer return to the master and servant<br />
rclationship. The simple point is that social and industrial unrest puts recovery at risk so the<br />
Commonwealth decided to legislate in a way which we think should end wide<br />
spread industrial action in Victoria which has been in some respects crippling to<br />
the Victorian economy and of course, may be in the future. But it does protect<br />
people and will protect pcople from being forced onto individual contracts. The<br />
Commonwealth lcgislation is to provide for coverage under federal awards </p>
<p>TEL: 2-. D e c. 2 T9 . uerv/ i<br />
. t q,<br />
administered by the Australian industrial Relations Commission for groups of<br />
employees, organisers and unions in Victoria who wish to make sucb a<br />
transformation. And undcr the Commonwealth's foreign affairs power, the<br />
Commonwealth will legislate to give the Commission power to set minimum<br />
wages, equal pay and termination of employment in the state of Victoria for<br />
groups who don't enjoy particular federal award coverage and this legislation<br />
under that head of power will come from the 1I LO conventions which have already<br />
been ratified and ones that will be ratified in the future.<br />
So the end result is I think, there will be a choice for Victorian employees they<br />
can as groups seek registration under federal awards, but the legislation will apply<br />
only where no industrial and arbitral structure exists and of course as Victorian<br />
tends in its legislation to see the cessation of the operation of all awards in Murch<br />
of this year, that condition will obtain in Victoria. T7hat is there will be no arbitral<br />
structure and therefore access to the federal award will take place under this<br />
legislation. The end result should be as I said, in wide spread industrial<br />
disputation this is a remedy for that, people do have recourse, not just to individual<br />
common law master and servant contracts. This is not to say that in relation to the<br />
Kennett government's changes in respect to hospitals or schools one won't see it<br />
localised in sporadic industrial disputation around redundancy and these other<br />
issues. But in terms of widespread industrial disputation this gives the employees<br />
and the public of Victoria protections which the Kennett governent wishes to<br />
take from them. Now Ill invite my collcague the inister for Industrial Relations,<br />
Petcr Cook to add some remarks to mine.<br />
PC: Thanks Paul. I think the Prime Minister has actually explained it quite clearly.<br />
The point is that we believe and stand by fair and independently determined<br />
awards as governing and protecting basic and minimum employment conditions.<br />
Awards arrived at by free arbitratio -n where necessary. By contrast our political<br />
opponents and the Kennett government support individual employment contracts<br />
and the choice which Mr Howard and Mr H-cwson have often talked about the<br />
choice is now clear. People can opt for awards, guaranteed proper minimums<br />
independently determined or they can opt for Mr Kennett's individual employment<br />
contract and I don't think there's much doubt what people will choose, they'll<br />
choose the protection of the tried and true, almost century long system we have in<br />
this country.<br />
In addition wc will be as the Prime Minister has said, legislating minimum<br />
protections in minimum wage,,, equal pay and protections against unfair dismissals<br />
or victimisat ion at the point of termination of employment and provisions that will<br />
allow redundancy. The external affairs power will be the head of power we use,<br />
ILO conventions will be the mecans of establishing the treaty relationship.<br />
1: Without the co-operation of the Victorian employers, I mean it is all very well for<br />
the unions to say well) yes we'd like the federal award, we'll have that. What<br />
happens if the employers resist particularly if it's a State government? </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Dec. 92 18: 39 No. 021 P U. 5/ 1<br />
PC: A lot of employers don't want the Kennett style industrial relations, they don't<br />
want to break the harmony that has been created under us. As you know Victoria's<br />
industrial disputation is off the bottom of the ABS graph and employers want to<br />
continue that co-operative relationship we have generated. So a number of<br />
employers will want to co-operate with unions and workers to shift state awards to<br />
federal jurisdiction. But if there is a dispute, that is a paper dispute, an argument<br />
and an employer wishes to remain within the Kennett system, then the matter is<br />
heard by the federal Industrial Relations Commission and because there will be in<br />
Victoria no independent access to arbitration that will be one of the guidelines we<br />
will encode in our legislation which will enable the federal commission to make a<br />
decision in those circumstances to facilitate the transfer of the state award and turn<br />
it from a state award to a federal award.<br />
J: Does this also apply to Victorian state public servants?<br />
PC: Victorian state public servants are subject to an appeal that has gonc to the High<br />
Court, that was taken and argued in June and you will recall at that time there was<br />
a negotiation on about awards for the state public service. The NSW government<br />
and the Kennett opposition opposed that and the federal court upheld that, it's on<br />
appeal at the High Court; we arc waiting a decision on that. would expect the<br />
decision will be that the award could stand and if I'm right about that expectation<br />
then state public servants under the first thing that we are doing here will be able<br />
to transfer their state award to the federal area. Under the second thing we are<br />
doing here, the minimum payments provision, they'll be able to do that anyway as<br />
soon as we get that legislation through.<br />
[-lHow can it be that you can widen the determination of minimum wages for the<br />
Commission in a way that doesn't affect the power of other state tribunals other<br />
than Victoria?<br />
PC: The distinguishing feature about Victoria is that in the past, like every other state,<br />
they had an arbitration systemn to which if there was a dispute a party could go and<br />
have the othcr party called before the Commission and have the dispute settled.<br />
What Kennett has done is remove that right. You can't get to the Commission in<br />
Victoria unless both parties agree. So if the party that is exploiting the other party<br />
doesn't agrec to call on the umpire you can't get before the judge. That means<br />
there is an cnd in Victoria of compulsory arbitration. Now where that has occurred<br />
by the actions of the state government then the federal Commission will facilitate<br />
upon application by unions or employers, the transfer of the state award to the<br />
federal jurisdiction.<br />
J: Priruc Minister, when will this legislation of yours be introduccd in the House?<br />
PM: As soon as we are able to get it in. As soon as we are able to bring it in. </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Dec. 92 18: 39 No. 021 P. 04/ 7'<br />
J: You have to anticipate the High Court challenges to the use of external affar<br />
powers?<br />
PM;. We are not necessarily anticipating it, but we are confident about our position on<br />
the matter. There has been other principal acts of the Commonwealth held to be<br />
valid by the High Court under the foreign affairs head of power and we think given<br />
the fact that the ILO conventions are conventions entered into by employers,<br />
employees and governments for minima, mostly in countries that don't have<br />
jurisdictions as we have, that seeking to have them apply in this country would be<br />
very much, not only doing in the letter and spirit which the Parliament has ratified,<br />
but in doing it, doing it in accordance with an international convention.<br />
pC: Can I[ just say this, what does it tell you about a government if it be the Kennett<br />
government that you have in mind or if it is John Howard, if its he that you have<br />
in mind, what does it tell you about them and their proposal? They want to block<br />
access to Australian workers to independently determine fair minimum wages,<br />
equal pay, prevention of victimisation at the point of termination, or redundancy.<br />
1: You say you are considering legislation for other standards including annual leave<br />
and matcrnity/ parental and hours of work, would that be legislation based in the<br />
Commonwealth's external affairs power?<br />
PC: Yes, there are HLO conventions upon which we can base legislation for annual<br />
leave, parental lcave, hours of work, those conventions are there. The priorities<br />
however are to guarantee protection of minimum wages, equal pay and a<br />
prevention against victimisation at the point of termination of employment and to<br />
guarantcc reasonable redundancy rights in the event of being terminated.<br />
1: To what extent arc you actually creating a precedent for the Opposition by a use of<br />
the external affairs power if it wants to usc some of the Commonwealth's powers<br />
like this for its own legislation if it wins office?<br />
PC: John Howard said he won't use the external affairs power.<br />
PM: He made that explicit today in a press statement.<br />
J: you are sort of changing the deal if. you like before he comes into office.<br />
PC: B3ut lct's get it clear the field that wc arc changing to. As the Prime Minister said a<br />
momcnt ago the ILO is the labour agency for the United Nations and like the<br />
World Health Organisation makes standard international proclamations on health<br />
standards, the ILO makes them on labour standards and when they adopt them,<br />
they adopt them in a plenary in which thcy arc voted for by workers, governments<br />
and employcrs and they have to be carried to be then presented to govrnmcnts<br />
and those standards havc been adopted in the case of minimum wages and in the<br />
case of equal pay by all Australian's states and the Commonwealth. In a case of </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Dec. 92 18: 39 No. 021 P. Ut)/ le<br />
termination as the Prime Minister said, we will now adopt that convention. These<br />
are international minimum labour standards and is someone going to tell us that<br />
these don't apply to Australia when the world expects them to apply to countries<br />
all over the globe.<br />
J: When this goes into the High Court it will means months maybe years of<br />
uncertainty and it certainily will mean that you'll go to a federal election not<br />
knowing the validity or legality of this legislation doesn't it?<br />
PM: But there will still be access to it. There will still be access even were there to be a<br />
challenge, just because the legislation may be challenged doesn't mn to say it<br />
won't be operative until a judgement is made.<br />
1: Will you be separating federal award changes from the ILO base changes or will<br />
you be wrapping it up in one legislative package?<br />
PC: No, we will be able to move on the changes to the Federal Act immediately on<br />
facilitating thc transfer of State awards to Commonwealth jurisdiction and we'll do<br />
that by using an omnibus bill that is now in the Senate on industrial relations by<br />
adding in a few clauses and I would expect that would go through immediately<br />
and be able to dealt with in the House when it comes back. As far as the other<br />
changes arc concerned we'll need to develop new bills for that and as the Prime<br />
Minister has said we'll do that as soon as we can.<br />
J: Do you have assurances from the ACTUJ that this will mean the end of industrial<br />
disputation?<br />
PM. It's not a matter of assurances and it is not the ACTU that is in a position to<br />
provide them, it Is that the core of the problem is that the arbitral tribunal process<br />
Is to be suspended, all intentions, purposes in Victoria and awards cancelled as of<br />
the 31 March 1993. That is the basis of this widespread industrial disputation,<br />
these measures give thc people affected by those changes an alternative, and one I<br />
think can reasonably assume, therefore, that the widespread disputation or<br />
demonstrations mounted as an appeal to the Kennett Government, in respect to the<br />
legislation, those people will reasonably regard this as of sufficient quality as a<br />
remedy to deal with their perceived injustice.<br />
J: In other words you are giving the trade union movement the capacity to back-off a<br />
damaging industrial campaign which would also hurt your Govcrnmcnt by giving<br />
them breathing space and an alternative?<br />
PM: No. What wc are doing is giving the employees of Victoria the right not to be<br />
pushed into common law, master and servant contracts, 600,000 individual<br />
contracts. The Liberal Party says they arc intcrcsted in choice, well now<br />
organisations of employees have got a choice. </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Dec. 92 18: 39 No. 021 P. 06/ 17<br />
1: Are you saying it is important that the unions now don't continue that campaign of<br />
industrial action?<br />
PM:. That is a matter for them. Our problem with all of this is the disruption which it is<br />
causing to Victoria and to confidence in Victoria. As I say in the press statement I<br />
think we are starting to see that in the classified job advertisements which have<br />
fallen in the Age Newspaper, DEETs indicators of skilled job vacancies released<br />
yesterday show rises for all other States, but no movement in Victoria. Victoria is<br />
a large part of the national economy, it has been recovering, we want it to<br />
continue.<br />
PC: Can I just support that by saying this to give you an example of what we mean<br />
nurses In Victoria today are taking industrial action in protest of the fact that<br />
because they are shift workers and lose weekend penalty rates, their salary is<br />
reduced by 25 per cent. What is the response of the Victorian Health Minister?<br />
On public radio today she said that they will be offering, I think, 2,500<br />
redundancies among health workers.. There can't be any guarantee that the<br />
Victorian Government which appears to be off the rails won't go further off the<br />
rails and provoke, in various sectors of public enmploymcnt, particular industrial<br />
disputes.<br />
J: Mr Kcating, have you or Senator Cook had talks about this with Mr Kelty and Mr<br />
Halfpenny, and what has been the response?<br />
PM: Senator Cook and I have had talks with the ACTU about some of the principles. I<br />
have not spoken to Mr Halfpenny about it, I don't think Senator Cook has.<br />
J; What has been their response to that?<br />
PM: Well I think they would regard this as an appropriate legislative remedy by the<br />
Commonwealth to this provocation in Victoria and giving cffcct to a set of<br />
conventions which the Commonwealth has ratified and which now an appropriate<br />
national circumstances can bc used, in terms of their reflection in legislation. The<br />
ACTU has been a party to the disputation in Victoria and the cause is the central<br />
cause, the fact that 600,000 Victorians are going to bc pushed onto common law<br />
contracts. So, you take the contract or you take the sack.<br />
J: is it hypocritical to be now relying on ILO minimum standards whcn the ILO has<br />
found that your own union rationalisation program breaches freedom of<br />
association?<br />
PC: No it's not. But I am glad you raised that point, we will enter it on Friday in a<br />
discussion with the employers and the u nions about repealing our minimum size of<br />
unions decision. So, we conform with the ILO.<br />
J: it's a bit late now isn't it, it's already had an cffect? </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Dec .92 18 : 39 NWo. 021P . O07-7<br />
PC: No, no it is not a bit late now. When we introduced that it was a reasonable thing<br />
against all of the jurisprudence of ILO previous decisions to do. But they have<br />
found that way now and we have said, we are good corporate citizenis, we will<br />
abide by [ LO decisions and that will be something that I will talk to the employers<br />
about on Friday with the unions. But the point that I think I should also make is<br />
the significance of the ILO and its conventions and decisions. That's an<br />
application the employers made which indicates the employers accept the<br />
sovereignty and authority of the ILO. Therefore, when we encode in Australian<br />
law ItO conventions which have been adopted tripartitely at international<br />
conventions we would expect that they to would be consistent and accept those<br />
stanidards.<br />
1: Can you guarantee to have the safety net legislation passed before an election is<br />
called?<br />
PM: We are going to pass it as quickly as we can pass it.<br />
J: Will that be before the election?<br />
PM: Well as quickly as we can pass it. It is as simple as that. Don't ask me tricky<br />
questions about the election timing please. But we will introduce some of it in the<br />
Senate and pass the balance in the House, or where we need to legislate dirctly we<br />
will introduce it properly in the first place in the House of Representatives. There<br />
Is no cause why it shouldn't be passed by Christmas.<br />
J: Is there a risk that business and international investors might see this as a signal<br />
that the Federal Government doesn't believe that there is a case for speeding the<br />
pace of reform in the labour market?<br />
PM: We don't regard this as reform. We don't regard Kennett's obscurantism reform.<br />
We regard it as a trip down the time tunncl to the 19th century, to the master and<br />
servant structure which is a disruptive, confrontationist, non-coopcrative structure.<br />
So, if you go arnd ask the markets, ask the markets what they think of the<br />
cooperative cnvironment of Japan, of the cooperative environment of many<br />
successful countries. This is the antithesis of cooperation, this is not<br />
rnicroeconomic reform, this is not labour market flexibility without rancour, where<br />
there is an inducement to higher productivity and higher remuneration. I noticed a<br />
day or so ago, the statistician produced the profit results, company profits before<br />
tax, they are rising again back near the peak, back up to the peak, towards the peak<br />
of 1988-89, which was way above the ' 60s historical golden mean. Where they<br />
are now must be near the ' 60s average. So what is Mr Kennett saying? That<br />
wages are too low, and this is before there is any volume on the bottom line, as the<br />
recovery strengthens and we start to see volume, when overheads have already<br />
been covered, the profitability will go straight to the bottom line and that profit<br />
share will jump inordinately. What are thcy saying? What is the Liberal Party </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Dec. 92 18: 69 No. U21 tvJJu/ 1t<br />
saying? That wages are too low, that the profit share above the ' 60s golden mean<br />
is not enough, because that's all they are about, they are about depressing wages.<br />
As we have said often in the Parliament, Senator Cook and myself, the industrial<br />
agreements the Governments introduced gives all the flexibility in the world,<br />
except flexibility downwards, the one thing that John Howard, John Hewson and<br />
Jeff Kennctt want is lower remuneration for Australian workers. That means a<br />
profit share higher than that which we have experienced or are experiencing. Is<br />
this reasonable? Answer, no.<br />
J: Mr Keating, the statement says that the legislation isn't designed to create new<br />
national standards, but to what extent does this greater power for the arbitration for<br />
the Industrial Relations Commission, even if it is only for those people not subject<br />
to a State jurisdiction, still going to create a national standard or a national floor<br />
under rninium wages?<br />
PM: There is a national floor now, there is a floor now in minimum rates, but these are<br />
having less to do with pay rates. Pay rates are being negotiated under industrial<br />
agreements where the productivity is being shared between the employer and the<br />
employee. What this provides is the extension of the Federal power of the<br />
arbitration commission to make awards, in respect of minima, for those<br />
organisations which seek that coverage and for other employees who seek to have<br />
a minima established. This provides that coverage. But again, we are talking<br />
about minimas which are below, mostly, the actual paid rates of the country. But<br />
again it all gets back. What do these people want, a profit share which is at such<br />
levels beyond any historic experience? If you ask the Kennett Government what<br />
do they want, I don't think they know. What is the point of this, to push the profit<br />
share to such levels that we have never seen? Australia is a very competitive<br />
country as compared with other countries in respect of wage rates. The share of<br />
national income going to wages in this country is very competitive with<br />
comparable countries. What do they want?<br />
J: The Government has all but wrapped up its wage deal with the public sector now,<br />
when will we see the completed negotiations, and can you hope to have that<br />
wrapped up by Christmas as well?<br />
PM: What we do in the next phase of our industrial transition is something the<br />
Government is still thinking about and I couldn't give you any timetabling about<br />
when.<br />
J: You would like to have that finished before the election?<br />
PM: It depends what we would be seeking to finalise.<br />
J: Should you presumably be thinking about as the Treasurer indicated yesterday,<br />
about how you would stop a second round effect on inflation from depreciation. Is<br />
that one of the factors that you will be looking at, and would it mean that you </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Dec .92 18: 39 No. 021 P. 09/ ir<br />
would be looking for some sort of wage deal stretching over, say, a two year<br />
period?<br />
PM: Welt I thought you were all telling me yesterday the column is faltering. How arm<br />
people going to collct high price increases in a so-called faltering economy? Or<br />
don't you really believe that?<br />
1. The Treasurer also suggested that the economy is about to take off. So based on<br />
what he is saying, presumably you will be wanting to look at locking in low<br />
inflation?<br />
PM: Productivity at the moment, I think the national accounts was running in the<br />
market sector at about 3 per cent in the year to September, 3 per cent. So, there is<br />
a huge productivity surgc in there which is going to go a long way in maintaining<br />
inflation. And the fact that the economy is growing, but modestly, means that the<br />
tear-away notion of price taking from higher import prices is think remote.<br />
J But you arc also saying minimum wages are a very important part of your<br />
platform, Mr Keating, that you want to protect low paid workers. So, it is fairly<br />
important, isn't it, that you find some mechanism for protecting those low paid<br />
workers but also locking in inflation, if you have any economic adjustment?<br />
PM: Laura ( Tingle), we do have an inflation rate of .7 per cent.<br />
J: Mr Fraser and Mr Dawkins have both indicated that it is likely to rise because of<br />
depreciation.<br />
pm: well there will be some impact from the dollar, but look at the enormous ramrod<br />
effect the depreciation is going to have for growth and activity in the economy,<br />
PC: See, trimmed labour productivity in the market sector over the last 12 months was<br />
3.6 per cent, that is not bad in terms of productivity performance in the OECD<br />
group.<br />
J: Senator Cook, you said soon after the election of Kennett that there was already an<br />
adequate process for workers wanting to switch to federal coverage. Why is that<br />
process now inadequate?<br />
PC: I don't think it was inadequate, but I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be made<br />
more adequate. If I can explain that, the avenue existed but the principles incoded<br />
in the act didn't take account of someone doing what Jeff Kennett did, so we arc<br />
just making the act take account of that and provide the avenue more easily and<br />
swinging that door that exists more widely open. But we are going beyond that to,<br />
we are putting in this provision for minimum wages which will have I think quite<br />
an important effect across the economy and will also have an effect on freeing up </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Dec. 92 18: 39 No. 021 P. 10/ 17<br />
the tabour nmarket further because it will enable small groups or individuals to<br />
approach the Federal Commission to fix minimum rates in their particular case.<br />
J: Mr Keating In your talks with the unions in August you put a $ 10 plus $ 10 wage<br />
proposal, I think it was, where is that now up to and when will that be finalised?<br />
PM: Well Senator Cook basically has carriage of its progress, do you want to reply<br />
Peter?<br />
PC: well at the moment we are still in the process of settling that down and making a<br />
final decision with the ACTU as to what we do. But the important element of it is<br />
that we wanted to allow breathing space to get as many workplace agreements up<br />
as possible.<br />
I: it Is supposed to come in about March.<br />
PC: While we are putting in our efforts to get work place agreements up it means we<br />
will turn our attention soon to protecting minimum standards, this is one of the<br />
things that will help us do that. But the important and strategic priority is to push<br />
as many workplace agreements through as possible to get that productivity<br />
through.<br />
J: Do you think the implementation of that will be delayed somewhat from the<br />
August talks?<br />
PC-It's clearly delayed now, it will be delayed a little longer too, I think, but the<br />
prospcct of..<br />
J: But the implementation was supposed to be next year, wasn't it?<br />
PC: The proposal was for an increase in March, 1993.<br />
J: Will that be delayed?<br />
PC: It depends on how soon wc decide to move, but at this stage it looks like the<br />
March date might be pushcd back a little.<br />
J: How much?<br />
PC: It's hard to say.<br />
J: Thrcc months, six months?<br />
PC: No, no, you can't put a time on it like that. Once our workplacc agreemlent for the<br />
Australian Public Scrvice is registered, if it is on Friday, and I expect it will be, we<br />
will get a very clear idea about thc growth and spread of workplace or enterprise </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Dec. 92 18: 39 No. 021 P. 11/ 1?<br />
.47 i<br />
bargaining in the economy. The impetus we've built up from that and the<br />
generation of productivity improvement we've got will provide us with a platforma<br />
to make a decision about that application.<br />
h: Can you clarify an answer to an earlier question. What's to stop workers in another<br />
State taking advantage of this legislation? Should they be unhappy with their deal<br />
with the State Government?<br />
PC: The trigger, in terms of transferring State awards to the Commonwealth, is the<br />
absence of a proper arbitration system in a State. As far as the minimum wages,<br />
equal pay, and termination of employment provisions are concerned, where a State<br />
jurisdiction operates to determine those in our legislation, we will respect the rol4<br />
of that State jurisdiction. Where a State jurisdiction doesn't operate to determine<br />
those, they'll have access to our Federal system.<br />
J: Have you consulted Victorian employers about this legislation in advance, as well<br />
as the ACTU, and if so what was their reaction?<br />
PC: rm going to talk to the industrial parties, employers and unions, in the national<br />
consultative forum of thc NLCC on Friday. I will talk to the Victorian<br />
Government as well. I make the point they never did us the courtesy of talking to<br />
us. And a lot of their laws have federal implications. One of those enduring<br />
implications is, for example, under Victorian State law people covered by federal<br />
awards could still be deemed to be criminals if they took part in industrial action.<br />
No-one talked to us about that. There are a myriad of other implications, but<br />
because they're crass and ignorant and don't consult, there's no reason why it<br />
shouldn't be proper. We will consult appropriately.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you said at the time of the One Nation statement that any Government<br />
that couldn't run the economy at 4 per cent should give the game away.<br />
PM: No, no, just understand what I said. I said any economy that can't travel at 4 per<br />
cent without spilling into Imports should give the game away.<br />
J: So we've got the constraint now of imports and wc can't travel it?<br />
PM: No, no, what I said was, and I've made the paint in thc Parliament plenty of times,<br />
not that we ought to be growing you're not that simple that you think that means<br />
that we should be growing at 4 per cent all the time. Surcly not. What do think<br />
we're going to bounce from recession to 4 per cent growth overnight? What I was<br />
saying simply was this that to the Liberals' eternal shame, after 30 ycars of<br />
government, the most the Australian economy could grow before the demand<br />
spilled into imports was 4 per cent. That is, they had no fat in the infrastructure to<br />
handle 5 or 6 per cent growth rates like a lot of the countries to our North have in<br />
this part of the world. Once we got to 4, there was no more capacity left and we<br />
spilled into imports. What I said was, if we can't run the Australian economy at 4, </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Dec. 92 18: 39 No. 021 P. 12/ 17<br />
12<br />
that is if we regarded the growth limit as being under 4, then you should throw in<br />
thc towel. And let me repeat it, because we ought to be able to run this economy<br />
at 4 per cent at least, and will need to bring unemployment down in a sustained<br />
marked way in the long ternm.<br />
3: current pace of recovery?<br />
pm: I thought yesterday's reporting was pretty strange. T7he Sydney Morning Herald<br />
had " New Figures Kill Hopes of Recovery" and then they had a graph on page 2<br />
which had an obvious recovery. There's the peak of 1989, 4 per cent, there's the<br />
recssion, and there's the climb out of 2 per cent. The economy is growing as we<br />
think, in terms at as I read to you in the House last week if you were there the<br />
Economist has got us in their forecast, which is a world-wide one, for the year to,<br />
2 per cent for Australia and higher than all of the other countries surveyed,<br />
Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden,<br />
Switzerland, the UK and the USA.<br />
1: So you are satisfied with the 2 per cent growth rate?<br />
PM: I think no, I think the recovery has not been fast enough. But we are recovering. I<br />
don't think there's any basis for these sort of headlines " Killing Recovery", or<br />
" Faltering".<br />
1: Aren't you running with a B~ alance of Payments constrained at 2, Mr Keating?<br />
PM: I don't think you can deduce that at this point of the cycle, no. Look, if the import<br />
growth represents a trend, there's a lot more going on ou t there than the National<br />
Accounts say. It could be, and it may well be, that businesses are simply<br />
optimistically holding stocks for Christmas, and that we're not seeing basically a<br />
trend. If we're seeing a trend there, they're either going into stocks or they're going<br />
Into thc economy. If they're going into thc economy, we're doing better than<br />
obviously.<br />
J: Business investment figures yesterday wcrc down again, you've got business<br />
surveys showing a lack of confidencc, you've even got a leading businessman this<br />
morning saying that the economy is in crisis.<br />
PM: Who was that?<br />
The Manager of Woolworths on AM.<br />
PM: He's decided to sign up with the Liberal Party. He's signed up with the Liberal<br />
Party, he's in favour of the GST, he's speaking at their meetings. Look, lct mc just<br />
1: Put him on your list? </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Dec. 92 18: 39 No. 021 P. 13/ 17<br />
13<br />
PM: No, no, I don't have lists, but I can read. Look, we are reaching a point after a long<br />
deleveraging of business in this country after the high debt cycle of the ' 80s, the<br />
profit share is recovering. I don't know whether many of you saw it September<br />
Quarter the profit share is recovering, we're reaching a point soon where that<br />
balance between debt and equity is reaching the point where businesses will start<br />
looking around for investment opportunities. This had to happen. It has taken in<br />
the Wcstcrn world about 18 months longer than everybody thought for this<br />
delevcraging to happen. But it's not well and truly on the way. The profit share is<br />
recovering. And of course, any volume is going to see, as I said once you've got<br />
your overheads covered all volume is basically cop for the bottom line.<br />
J: You don't think there's a<br />
PM: No, I do not. We've got housing up 12 per cent for the year, 5 per cent for the<br />
quarter. I noticed some people said that there was a reliance on public sector<br />
demand, well I've got some of you saying the One Nation spending is not coming<br />
through fast enough, and when it comes through you say you're relying on public<br />
sector demand. The game is deteriorating, the analysis game, if that's the basis of<br />
your analysis. Two weeks ago the big trouble was that One Nation spending<br />
wasn't all being spent, this week the problem is that there is too much public<br />
expenditure in the growth numbers. Can just say, for all you sleuths out there,<br />
that stock building was in at .5 for non-farm stocks and 1 can tell you this, I<br />
don't have any superstitions about stocks, they're mostly goods that are put on<br />
shelves, and they're goods made by people, and so you can count them in to<br />
private sector demand. And then someone said private sector final demand fell by<br />
1 think we are entitled to say that stocks are part of the private economy. If you<br />
put thc stocks back into private demand, well of course private demand rose in the<br />
quarter along with public demand, which has given us .5 per cent for the quarter,<br />
2.1 per cent for the year, faster I think than most if not all OECD economies, and<br />
across the year, not the quarter, private demand was up 1.1 per cent.<br />
J: But how can you count stocks in that way unless they walk past the cash register?<br />
PM: If you don't think stocks are part of the private economy, old son, where do they<br />
belong?<br />
J: If you're not satisfied with the current pace of recovery, and there's no indication<br />
the economy accelerating, what do ) you intend to do about it?<br />
PM: Thec September quarter, like all National Accounts, still represent a bit of recent<br />
history, and it was for July, August and September. It would be a brave person<br />
who said that the economy is not growing as quick or more quickly in the last<br />
quarter.<br />
J: So do the Budget forecasts on growth stand? </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Dec. 92 18: 39 No. 021 P. 14/ 17<br />
14<br />
PM: I think we need time to see, but this quarter I'm told is right on the button with the<br />
quartrly through-the-year structure of the Treasury's forecast.<br />
1: Mr K~ eating, regardlcss of where stocks sit in the economy, the basis strategy of<br />
your government is to try to see as much activity in the net exports sector of the<br />
economy as possiblc. Now, yesterdays National Accounts certainly showed that's<br />
not happening, partly through a slowdown in the world, and partly because<br />
imports are rising. That still creates a basic dilemma between your goals of<br />
boosting employment and not running up a Balance of Payments constraint. How<br />
long are you prepared to see that dilemma continue and to put pressure on the<br />
current account?<br />
PM: I think the dilemma, as you put it Laura ( T7ingle), is resolving itself through the<br />
ramrod effect of the exchange rate. The markets have seen this. It's already made<br />
a 13 per cent adjustment down in the exchange rate. We will see that push activity<br />
through the economy in the next 12 months. Why have we got such a result in net<br />
exports? Answer commodity prices are down, rural volumes are down. And<br />
what have the exchange markets done? They've adjusted the rate accordingly. So<br />
the conundrum you're addrcssing, the markets have already addressed. it's sitting<br />
therc now.<br />
3: Mr Keating, what do you think of Mr Fraser's suggestion for a growth strategy<br />
statement?<br />
PM: I think Mr Fraser is at pains to advise the community what he sees are the<br />
prospects for growth in the Australian economy and the very great opportunities<br />
Australia has. You notice in his recent address, he was largely endorsing the<br />
structurc of governmecnt policy. He was not urging that there be a new structure. I<br />
think what he is after is some mechanism or method to tell the community that<br />
great structural progress has been madc, and that Australia is adjusting, and that<br />
some of the gloom that is dispelled by people knowing that the fundamental<br />
adjustment in the economy is still taking place. I think that's the point of the thing.<br />
J: Do you agree with it?<br />
PM: Yes I do, and I think the Treasurer responded to that yesterday.<br />
J: Mr Keating, on spending and on jobs, Senator Tate admitted this week that the<br />
local capital works funding that went to New South Walcs was not being used to<br />
create new jobs but only keep those jobs that already existed. Is that the case in<br />
other States, and if so doesn't that run slightly contrary to what the Government<br />
said is<br />
PM: While it may in somec cases be correct, upon examninat ion think Senator Tate<br />
would ind that it's not correct. I was in Bundabcrg recently, the very day I was </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Dec. 92 18: 39 No. 021 P. 15/ 1-<br />
there 21 people were put onto one of these programs in that city at that time who<br />
were not employees of the Bundaberg City Council. So this is happening all over<br />
the place. There is additionality, as they say, to all of these things.<br />
J: Senator Cook, given that you would legislate to give effect to the ILO convention,<br />
and if it's not thrown out by the High Court, does that mean constraint on a future<br />
Liberal Government in just wiping out the legislation, or doe it put constraints on<br />
( inaudible) if you do that?<br />
PC; I don't think it will be thrown out by the High Court, let's get that very clear. But<br />
if we legislate minimum standards and an incoming Governiment wants to remove<br />
minimum standards, and if they've got a Parliamentary majority, they can. But<br />
how would you look out there in the community trying to knock off minimum<br />
standards? So if they want to do that, they'll reveal the colour of their morality in<br />
these sort of issues.<br />
J: How do you see the IRC actually implementing this, through a national test case?<br />
PC: No, the way in which wc would propose to legislate is to enable the IRC to do<br />
what it does now, in fact, to declare minimum rates of awards, so that their<br />
minimum standards would be an appropriate standard for the industry sector.<br />
J: Mr Keating, a lot has been made of your comment on Lateline the other night<br />
when you said the micro reform agenda was largely completed.<br />
FM: I was speaking about the Commonwealth own purpose authorities, not the<br />
Commonwealth induced national Look, let mc just make this point. In a<br />
country like Australia, the micro economic reform will never be completed, it's<br />
impossible to complete it because it implies that everything is at optimums in<br />
the labour market, in the product market. Of course it is not and can never be in<br />
any country. So there will always be a desire to make any country more<br />
competitive and more efficient. But in terms of the Commonwealth's own<br />
authorities and its things, in such things as airlines are largely completed;<br />
telecommunications, a competitor, a sunset clause, full competition in 5 years from<br />
now; in tariffs. Wherever you go around the Commonwealth's realm, the big<br />
agenda of thc middle ' 80s is largely behind us, but much of the Commonwealth's<br />
agenda now will be about making State authorities in the public sector more<br />
competitive. But of course, the big agenda will always be making the private<br />
product marlcts more competitive through enterprise agreements, et cetera. That<br />
was the point I was making, that people were saying to us in the ' 80s, you've got to<br />
do thc ports and wharves, you've got to do the airline system, you've got to do the<br />
telecommunications. They are largely done, that's the point I'm making.<br />
V: You're still saying there's a lot still to do? </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Dec. 92 18: 39 No. 021 P. lb/ 1?<br />
a' L~,** DOW4<br />
16<br />
PM:. I think in the public sector, broadly categorised, yes. And particularly in State<br />
authorities for which the Commonwealth does not have authority. That is, where<br />
we've got to do things cooperatively with thc States, we have a national agenda<br />
there. But that's not our own purpose thing. Where we've been in the box seat on<br />
our own things, wc'vc done them.<br />
1: Will you be pushing the States on Monday when YOU See them to speed up micro<br />
reform?<br />
PM: in some respects we'll be talking about micro issues. The agenda for this meeting<br />
some of it will be in areas like electricity where again we are on the verge of a very<br />
dramatic change, thc separation of power generation from distribution. And again,<br />
an area where the Commonwealth's own Interest are the generating units of the<br />
Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme, but where the Commonwealth has a<br />
national interest in the operation of the Electricity Commissions of the various<br />
States. So that's the point I was making.<br />
1: Mr Keating, in Mr Hawke's New Federalism there was an aim of cooperation with<br />
the Premiers to eventually get rid of industrial tribunals in the States. Is this still<br />
an aim that your Government would like to work towards?<br />
PM: Would you like to say something about that, Peter?<br />
PC: Yes, we've been pursuing that, and we're doing it cooperatively with the States.<br />
We've done a number of things to help reach that goal. We've appointed, where<br />
States nominated them, all their Commissioners to our bench and they've<br />
appointed our Commissioners to their benches; we opened a common facility in<br />
Adelaide the other day where that there's' one court with both parties using it.<br />
We're moving in that direction. I think there is, as an ideal outcome, a good idea<br />
that we have one industrial relations system in Australia instead of seven. Or, in<br />
the case of Victoria, you'd have to say six and a bit. But we're working towards<br />
that, and I think it would be a desirable outcome to get there.<br />
J: When do you intend to talk to the Victorian Government and about what?<br />
PC: Pretty soon.<br />
Have you spoken to other State Governments?<br />
PC We'll conduct proper consultations with the States and we'll get on our bike and do<br />
it immecdiately.<br />
J: But you've already decided what you're doing.<br />
J: What's thc point? </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Dec. 92 18: 59 NO . UZI<br />
17<br />
PC: There is a lot of point. In the case of many of these State Governments they'll<br />
want to see our legislation to make sure that what we say is the principal, where<br />
there is a genuine Commission. This legislation won't intrude, theyll want to see<br />
that, they're not affected by that, so we'll show them that and go through the<br />
legislation. That's the standard way of proceeding.<br />
J: If they disagree with the legislation you will just go ahead anyway.<br />
PC: As the Prime Minister said, we've got an obligation to the Australian community<br />
to push the recovery through even better, and Victoria is a blight on that landscape,<br />
and if they want to continue to be a blight I don't think that's consistent with our<br />
national focus at all.<br />
J: Senator Cook, if there is a large number of workers who are already outside the<br />
award, wouldn't you expect a flood of dissatisfied workers to the IRC?<br />
PC: There's not a large number of workers outside the award system. The award<br />
system covers about 82 per cent of Australian workers, and of the remaining 18 per<br />
cent most of those are managerial or professional. So there's not a large group<br />
outside the award system, but there arc some outside the award system. And the<br />
significant thing about the changes that we're proposing to legislate minimum<br />
wages, whether some of those people are in a union or not they can approach the<br />
federal Commission and have a fair minimum determined for them.<br />
