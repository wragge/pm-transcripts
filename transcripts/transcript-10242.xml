February 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
DOORSTOP FAIRBAIRN<br />
E PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good morning.<br />
JRNLST: What do you want to get out of your first overseas trip this year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, a reconfirmation of the very close friendship and historical association with New<br />
Zealand. JRNLST: On the White Paper how do you hope to put the Coalition stamip on the White Paper? It's<br />
been reported that you are expecting to take a hard-nosed approach to it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't think a running commentary on a White Paper is suitable for a noise laden doorstop at<br />
the airport.<br />
. JRNLST:<br />
There were some rocky times in the relationship between the previous government and New<br />
Zealand. Do you think that under your government that's been repaired and we have resumed<br />
a close relationship with New Zealand? 15/ 82/ 97 11: 42 P~ j: I </p>
<p>15/ O2/ 97 11: 42 Pg: 2<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
Well the people have always been close. Government's can never wreck good relationships<br />
between close friends but under my government the relationship has got I think a little warmer<br />
because 1 have a good personal relationship with Mr Bolger, we have a lot in common and I<br />
will be futrthering that over the next two or three days.<br />
JRNLST: Prime Minister how would you describe your WIK negotiations yesterday?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
They were quite friendly. They were very detailed, they highlighted the complexity of the<br />
issue. I don't want to raise expectations that we have bridged the differences because they are<br />
still very great. But there was a lot of good will. Everybody was trying and I'm going to keep<br />
trying to get a negotiated settlement but at the end of the day as the government we have to<br />
take a decision<br />
JRNJ. ST:<br />
What do you hope to have achieved and by when?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I've indicated that I wouild like to put a final position to my colleagues by Easter and that<br />
seems to be a timetable that all the interested parties both accept and understand. Thank you.<br />
ends </p>
