MACQUARIE NETWORK WEEKLY BROADCAST<br />

NUCLEAR TESTS 21 JUNE J972<br />
Goodnight Lately there has bean considerable public comment and<br />
controversy about the current series of French nuclear tests in the<br />
Pacific. I want to explain to you, as clearly as I can, what<br />
the facts are about tho Government's policy both on the French<br />
nuclear tests, and on all nuclear tests in the atmosphere, as well.<br />
No matter where they are undertaken and no matter which nation,<br />
friendly or unfriendly conducts them.<br />
I want to explain, too, the facts about Australia's<br />
vote at the recent Environmental Conference in Stockholm. Once<br />
you have these facts, I invite you to make your own judgment on the<br />
many comments and opinions which are currently being heard on this<br />
subject. Our oolicy on nuclear matters proceeds from the starting<br />
point that Australia's role in nuclear energy is concerned with its<br />
peaceful uses. The harnessing of the great force of nuclear energy<br />
remains one of the great opportunities for gocd of our generation.<br />
So we have a twofold objective We must learn to use<br />
nuclear technology for peace, but we must also contain, and eventually<br />
dissuade, its potential use for war and destruction.<br />
As far back as 1963, a partial nuclear test ban treaty<br />
was concluded. it was supported by many nations. This treaty<br />
specifically bans nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in outer space,<br />
and under water. Australia took its basic stand against nuclear tests<br />
when it ratified this treaty. It should be unmistakeably clear,<br />
therefore, that our attitude is most definitely not a new or a<br />
belated one. Rather iq it a clear, firm and long-standing policy<br />
introduced by, and supported by, successive Liberal and Country<br />
Party Governments, particularly my own. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
If anything, this strong opposition to atmospheric<br />
testing which Australia expressed in becoming a party to the partial<br />
test ban treaty nine years ago has become even stronger as time has<br />
passed. In line with this long-standing policy of opposing the<br />
tests, we have repeatedly conveyed to the French Government, through<br />
the proper channels and in unequivocal terms the firm opposition of<br />
the Australian Government and people to French nuclear tests in the<br />
Pacific. Australia was the first country to protest against the<br />
French tests in 1972. We have made that protest repeatedly since.<br />
My Government is dedicated to upholding the partial<br />
nuclear test ban treaty. That is our policy. It has not changed and<br />
it will not change. At Stockholm, we abstained at first on a resolution<br />
about nuclear tests because our primary purpose of opposing atmospheric<br />
tests was already covered by that policy. As well, we did not think<br />
the Environment Conference was the ideal forum to go into the<br />
difficult technical issues underlying questions of disarmament and<br />
world peace, including a more comprehensive treaty.<br />
But because this action seemed to raise some doubts<br />
about our central policy of opposition, we decided to once again<br />
underline our fundamental opposition to all atmospheric tests for all<br />
time by voting for the resolution whon it reached the plenary session<br />
at Stockholm. I hope this establishes my and my Government's<br />
position clearly. In the modern world, it is possible for nations to have<br />
serious differences on some issues, while continuing to co-operate<br />
on others. President Nixon's visits to Peking and Moscow are<br />
examples. I very sincerely regret to say once again that France<br />
has failed to respond, despite our co-operation with her in other<br />
areas. We have taken every reasonable step we can to persuade France<br />
to halt the tests. Last Friday, the day after I arrived back from my visit<br />
to South-East Asia, !' had a personal message conveyed to the President<br />
of France. On Monday, in Sydney, I shared a platform with the French<br />
Ambassador to Australia. After hearing him speak, I felt obliged to<br />
state that none of the explanations the Ambassador had given would,<br />
in any way, or in any shape at all, change my own opposition or that<br />
of my Government or that of the Australian people to nuclear tests<br />
in the atmosphere. Lot there be no misunderstanding on this score. I and<br />
my Government want the current series of tests abandoned. That has<br />
been made as clear as crystal in the past few weeks and even as<br />
recently as last night when Mr Marshall and I sent a joint message<br />
to the Conference of the Commnittee on Disarmament in Geneva.<br />
Thanks and Goodnight. </p>
