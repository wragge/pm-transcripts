The President of -the Hellenic Republic, His Excellency<br />
Mr Constantine Karamanlis, will be making a State Visit to<br />
Australia from Tuesday 9 to Sunday 14 March 1982.<br />
The visit will be the first to Australia by a Greek<br />
Head of State.<br />
The President's program will include a number of public events<br />
in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne which will provide an<br />
opportunity for the many thousands of people of Greek descent<br />
living in Australia to welcome him.<br />
The ties between Australia and Greece are wide-ranging but<br />
none is more important than the personal links which have<br />
resulted from Greek migration to Australia the Greek<br />
community is one of Australia's oldest and biggest migrant<br />
groups. I am personally looking forward to welcoming President Karamanlis<br />
and I am certain that the reception he receives from all<br />
Australians will be a warm one.<br />
President Karamanlis will arrive in Canberra at 10.30 am on<br />
Tuesday 9 March and remain until Thursday 11 March. He will<br />
be in Sydney from 11-13 March and in Melbourne from 13-14 March.<br />
In Canberra on Tuesday 9 March, the President will attend a<br />
State dinner given by the Governor-General of Australia and<br />
Lady Cowen. On that day he will also visit the Australian War<br />
Memorial. On Wednesday 10 March, the President will be guest of.<br />
honour at a State Luncheon at Parliament House. Included<br />
among the guests will be representatives of the Greek Community<br />
throughout Aiustralia. President Kramanlis will also attend a<br />
reception at. Government House at which heads of Diplomatic<br />
Missions wil~ l be presented and a dinner at the Hellenic Club<br />
