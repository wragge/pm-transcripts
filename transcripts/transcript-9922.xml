PRIME MINISTER 7/ 96<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
MR BURGESS AND MR HOWARD<br />
On the very day we celebrate our nationhood and social harmony, the<br />
National party candidate for Leichhardt has chosen to make remarks which<br />
are deeply offensive to the great majority of Australians and to the values by<br />
which we live.<br />
His remarks are a particular insult to all those Australians who have ever<br />
attended a citizenship ceremony and all those who may be contemplating it.<br />
They make a racist mockery of Australian citizenship ceremonies and<br />
procedures and in doing so also mock the principle of tolerance on which<br />
modern Australia depends.<br />
Mr Burgess would be a member of a coalition government and it is therefore<br />
Mr Howard's duty to disown these comments and call on Mr Burgess to<br />
withdraw and publicly apologise. Passing that responsibility to his Deputy,<br />
Mr Fischer, is an unacceptable response from a man who aspires to lead the<br />
government. If Mr Howard fails this test of leadership, Australians will have a<br />
right to wonder how loud a voice the likes of Mr Burgess would have in a<br />
Coalition government.<br />
