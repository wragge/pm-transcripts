PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 4 OCTOBER 1979<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE<br />
PREMIER OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA.<br />
THE BANK OF ADELAIDE<br />
The Premier of South Australia, Mr David Tonkin, called on<br />
the Prime Minister and Mr Philip Lynch, Minister for Industry<br />
and Commerce, representing the Acting Treasurer, in Melbourne<br />
today to clarify the position of the Bank of Adelaide with<br />
regard to Commonwealth Government policies.<br />
The Prime Minister and the Premier noted that the commercial<br />
arrangement between the Bank of Adelaide and the Australia and<br />
New Zealand Banking Group Limited had been entered into after<br />
full consultation with the Commonwealth Treasurer, the then<br />
South Australian Premier, Mr Corcoran, and the Reserve Bank of<br />
Australia. Those arrangements included the provision of massive<br />
financial support to the Bank of Adelaide by the major trading<br />
banks and the Reserve Bank and an understanding that the Bank<br />
of Adelaide would seek a merger with a larger Australian trading<br />
bank. They were entered into against the background of longstanding<br />
Government policy in respect of the overseas ownership<br />
of banks operating in Australia. The arrangements successfully<br />
stabilised the position of the Bank of Adelaide and ensured that<br />
it remained in a position to meet fully its commitments.<br />
The Prime Minister said that the policy with regard to foreign<br />
ownership of Australian banks was undoubtedly a matter that would<br />
be examined carefully by the Committee of Inquiry into the<br />
Australian financial system. It would be inadvisable for the<br />
Government to make an ad hoc change in that long-standing policy<br />
before receipt of the Committee's report and the Government's<br />
detailed examination of any recommendations that might be made in<br />
this area. The Commonwealth Government therefore has concluded<br />
that the current. policy relating to overseas ownership of<br />
Australian banks should be followed.<br />
Against the background of the existing commercial arrangements<br />
between the Bank of Adelaide and the Australia and New Zealand<br />
Banking Group Limited and the long-standing policy with regard<br />
to foreign ownership of Australian banks, the Prime Minister<br />
said that, as foreshadowed by the Treasurer in his statement<br />
of 9 June 1979, arrangements are in train for the necessary<br />
consents and authorisations under Commonwealth legislation to<br />
be obtained so that the proposed merger arrangement between the<br />
Bank of Adelaide and the Australia and New Zealand Group Limited<br />
could proceed. </p>
