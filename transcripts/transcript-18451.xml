Australia has lost one of our sporting greats with the passing of Jim Stynes this morning, following his courageous battle with cancer.</p>
<p>As a sporting legend Jim inspired millions with his sportsmanship, making a lasting contribution to Australia's game.</p>
<p>But he will always be remembered for the heroic and brave way in which he handled adversity  -  for this he will remain a legend.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Dublin, Jim moved to Australia in 1984 to play a foreign code, only to quickly master it.</p>
<p>Jim represented Melbourne Football Club for 264 AFL matches, winning his club's best and fairest award four times and the Brownlow Medal once in 1991.</p>
<p>But these achievements are just one segment of his extraordinary life. Jim used the opportunity AFL gave him, to become someone who changed lives.</p>
<p>Through his youth organisation Reach, he touched the lives of thousands of young Australians, helping them to realise their full potential.  </p>
<p>It was work close to his heart and work that he continued even in the face of his battle with cancer.</p>
<p>Jim was also a faithful servant of his beloved Melbourne Football Club.</p>
<p>He took on the Presidency when the club was at its lowest ebb and managed to shape a bright future and new direction for the organisation - for this they owe him a tremendous debt.</p>
<p>Above all, Jim was a loving husband and father who will be sorely missed by his wife, Sam, and their two children.</p>
<p>The thoughts of the nation are with them today as they grieve the loss of a wonderful man.  </p>
