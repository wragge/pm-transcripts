PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MiINISTEIF,, TH7E HON P. J. KEATING MP,<br />
DOORSTOP, LE MERIDIEN HOTEL, MONDAY, 25 OCTOBER 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, how did the meeting with ViWr Gob go?<br />
PM: It was exceptionally warm and we had 1Ti. any things in common the trade<br />
between Australia and Singapore which is growing now inexorably, all the time;<br />
the co-operative things we are doing, not just in Australia and Singapore, but<br />
with third countries particularly in south-east Asia and also our mutual interest<br />
in APEC which, of course, Prine Minist er Goh will be attending the APEC<br />
leaders summit in Seattle next month and wve were talking about that too.<br />
J: Does he share your view of APEC becomaing an economic community at this<br />
leaders summidt?<br />
PM: I think Singapore is verny strong about APEC's prospects and the verny nice<br />
coincidence of events which have brought it about and the fact that we the two<br />
largest economies in the world verny interested and verny keen to develop a multilateral<br />
structure that is, of course, the US and Japan so he is quite excited<br />
about APEC as I am.<br />
J: Prime Minister, why did th6 Commonwealth squib the issue of human rights?<br />
PM: I don't follow your ' squib' comment.<br />
J: Well, they didn't issue the Paphos Declaration, it seems to be a verny watered<br />
down statement.<br />
PM: I see, you mean the humanitarian statement. Because, I think, basically that it<br />
was not possible to draft something whichi saw the Commonwealth taking on<br />
some crisis management, dispute settling rc'le which is what some of the drafting<br />
had anticipated. That is not the Commronwealth's strength, it is not the<br />
Commonwealth's role. Some of us said that a day or so ago, I said it to you<br />
yesterday and I think that is the reason why it will be reflected though in the<br />
communique, but in more appropriate terns.<br />
J: What was the thinking behind maintaining residual sanctions against South<br />
Africa until there is a democratically elected government in place? </p>
<p>PM: I think there has been a consistency on ihe Commonwealth's part about these<br />
things, but again, we are very up beat about the prospects of the election of a<br />
democratically elected non-racially select,. d government and I indicated in this<br />
morning's session that Australia would. be contributing financially, to the<br />
monitoring effort on the part of the Commonwealth.<br />
J: With the personnel that we would be expected, the election observers or<br />
whatever, that we would be expected to pirovide as well, is that in addition or in<br />
exchange for involvement in any United Nations forces?<br />
PM: No, that would be in addition to. I also said we would be inviting some of our<br />
staff to participate in the monitoring, tha: is some of our electoral staff, as well<br />
as the financial commitment by Australia, which was very well received.<br />
J: Prime Minister, how hard a job do you think it is going to be to get the situation<br />
in South Africa after the election sorted out, how long realistically do you think<br />
it is going to take, how long will Australia be involved?<br />
PM: I don't think I could say Peter ( Harvey) exactly how long that would take. It<br />
depends on how much good will there is on the part of the South Afican<br />
community in general after the election;, but it will be a watershed for that<br />
country and watersheds to produce a change of sentiments, so it may well be<br />
that things run there as they did in Zimbabwe.<br />
J: Mr Keating, can you see Australia and -he Commonwealth reaching the point<br />
where they might impose sanctions on Turkey over Cyprus?<br />
PM: Cyprus is essentially in the charge of th,. United Nations and I think what the<br />
communique will express today is a recitation of the Commonwealth's support<br />
for the UN resolutions which have been passed on this in 1974 and 1984, but I<br />
don't think the Commonwealth sees for itself a role in taking primary carriage<br />
of the matter. It is properly with the UN, but we think it is a useful thing to<br />
support the UN's efforts.<br />
J: Do you think sanctions would work againist Turkey?<br />
PM: I don't know, but that begs the question about who manages the dispute and it<br />
won't be the Commonwealth managing it.<br />
J: What have you really achieved here after five days?<br />
PM: I think getting a very firm statement of support for the conclusion of the GATT<br />
Round is a particularly important thing at this critical junction. I mean, the<br />
Commonwealth's meetings have been held coincidently as it turns out with quite<br />
important epochs in the history of countries and communities most particularly<br />
obvious was Rhodesia and South Afica. It happens also to be true this year for<br />
the GATT and getting such a firm statement of support and a delegation to visit<br />
the key players in the GATT Round at this key time would be a very useful </p>
<p>thing. If this meeting succeeded in doing ihat and that only it would have been<br />
well worth having and beyond that, of counse, it has done other things.<br />
J: Why do you feel it necessary to issue a statement in relation to Dr Hewson and<br />
Mabo?<br />
PM: Because I think his position is becoming appalling, that is why. Dr Hewson is in<br />
a position now where Mr Court has called on his support and what Mr Court<br />
is saying he wants to extinguish, he want tc actually abolish native title, he wants<br />
to wipe out the thing the High Court said Australia indigenes have. Now, where<br />
does Dr Hewson stand? For how long can he hide from these vital questions<br />
particularly at a time when Mr Reith is saying that the High Court is usurping<br />
the role of Parliament, that it needs to be reformed, to use his word, that a<br />
Coalition government would need to reform it, whatever that means, whatever<br />
threat that implies for the High Court and while there is great division in the<br />
Liberal party between the likes of Mr Woolridge Mr Reith and between other<br />
Liberals and Mr Court. And the implied threat that Western Australian<br />
parliamentary liberals who are supporting Dr Hewson's leadership won't support<br />
him if he doesn't toe Mr Court's line. I think it is time that Dr Hewson stood up<br />
on Mabo and said on this matter of great principle where he stands.<br />
J: Prime Minister, is there anything in the legislation that we don't know about that<br />
might spring a surprise and cause great concern to some elements of the<br />
community like pastoralists?<br />
PM: No, I don't think so. Let's not be trying to give Dr Hewson any outs this is a<br />
very simple matter. The High Court has siid that there is a native tite flowing<br />
from Aboriginal tradition and custom in th common law of Australia does he<br />
support that or does he support Richard Ccurt and if he supports that he should<br />
put his shoulder to the wheel and support tlis legislation.<br />
J: Who do you think is going to win the split then between the two factions in the<br />
party who do you think will come to the ascendancy?<br />
PM: The Liberal party on this key question is very divided and given the fact that<br />
since the election Dr Hewson has done noihing but play a spoiling role on the<br />
Budget and more laterally on Mabo, then I think it is time on a matter which is<br />
going to extend way beyond this Parliament. A matter that goes back to the<br />
actual genesis of our settlement to have a resolution of this is a matter of high<br />
policy in Australian public life. And for him to be ducking and weaving, or<br />
worse, conniving in any attempt by Richard Court to actually abolish native title<br />
would leave the Liberal party without any credibility on this key matter.<br />
J: Prime Minister, what are hoping to achieve now in Indonesia with your talks<br />
with President Soeharto?<br />
PM: Well, it is eighteen months since I have seen President Soeharto and I think<br />
given the fact that I have got to overfly or fly through Indonesian air space, it<br />
was a reasonable time to actually call in and say hello and just recap on the </p>
<p>eighteen months of events which have taken place and take the opportunity to<br />
have a talk about APEC which is now a month away the Seattle meeting<br />
what we see for APEC; how he is seeing the APEC matter unfolding and so we<br />
can compare notes ahead of the meeting.<br />
J: Do you have any specific goals out of that meeting at all?<br />
PM: No, I just think routine visits by neighbours should be more of the rule rather<br />
than the exception.<br />
J: Are you expecting clear support from President Soeharto as opposed to Dr<br />
Mahathir's opposition to some aspects of APEC?<br />
PM: Indonesia has had a very careful, but nevertheless pragmatic approach about the<br />
great opportunity which APEC opens. I mean, APEC opens the opportunity of<br />
seeing in a multi-lateral context the trading interests of the first and second<br />
largest economies in the world, along with those of the Asia-Pacific community.<br />
It is a great opportunity and, I think, Indonesia understand that and has seized<br />
upon that.<br />
J: In your meeting with Mr Goh, you said that you talked about trade with third<br />
countries, the sort of joint venture trade into other areas, is there anything<br />
specifically that the two governments can do to promote that or is that going to<br />
happen within a wider context of APEC?<br />
PM: It is happening now, it is happening at a ferocious speed now. There are so<br />
many joint ventures being entered between Australian companies and<br />
Singaporean companies for business, not just in Singapore, but for other<br />
countries of the region. I think that the collaboration between Singapore and<br />
Australia will just continue to grow and grow.<br />
J: Prime Minister, Mr Howe has said that a jobs levy on higher income earners<br />
will be considered by the Government, is it a possible goer?<br />
PM: We won't be anticipating any of that until I receive the report on employment<br />
which will be handed down in a month from now, so we will see what the<br />
Commidttee recommends and then we'll take a position about it.<br />
J: Is there growing support for the idea in the Government?<br />
PM: It is a fashionable idea at the moment, but whether the fashion will give up the<br />
solidity I think it would require will depend on what comes from the Report.<br />
ends </p>
