<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, Bill Clinton's decision not to attend APEC,</p>
<p>   does that send the wrong signals to the region at a time when the</p>
<p>   push for free trade is facing enormous obstacles?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There are reasons for the President not coming. I understand those</p>
<p>   reasons. Clearly they are related to what is happening in Iraq and</p>
<p>   the President's decision is entirely understandable. I would</p>
<p>   hope everybody in the region will see it in that light and fully</p>
<p>   understand his reasons for not coming.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is this shaping up as the most crucial APEC Summit with Japan threatening</p>
<p>   to de-rail the EVSL Agreement on liberalising free trade in those</p>
<p>   15 key sectors?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>All of these summits are important and it is essential in the background</p>
<p>   of a difficult Asian economic climate that we maintain the momentum</p>
<p>   of APEC. But they are always important meetings. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You have plans for a bi-lateral with President Habibie. Are you</p>
<p>   concerned that domestic problems in some of the countries that are</p>
<p>   attending may upset the push to liberalise free trade?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look I'm not going to sort of give a lengthy analysis of</p>
<p>   what's happening in other countries in these circumstances.</p>
<p>   I'll be talking to President Habibie. We have a good relationship.</p>
<p>   I'll be very keen to get his assessment of what is happening</p>
<p>   in Indonesia. Indonesia is going through a very difficult transition</p>
<p>   phase and Australia should have sympathy and understanding and recognise</p>
<p>   the enormous adjustment that has to take place in that country.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is there any sign that Japan is willing to give any ground on the</p>
<p>   forestry and fisheries....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'll be getting a briefing on that from Mr Fischer when</p>
<p>   I arrive in Kuala Lumpur. </p>
<p>Could I just say in relation to President Clinton that whilst all</p>
<p>   Australians would welcome a genuine change of heart by President</p>
<p>   Saddam Hussein regarding United Nations' inspections. It has</p>
<p>   to be a genuine change of heart for it to be worthwhile and I'm</p>
<p>   a little sceptical that the conditions that he has apparently attached</p>
<p>   to the United Nations' concessions may indeed conceal the reality</p>
<p>   that he is unwilling to cooperate. And I can understand the scepticism</p>
<p>   that has already been expressed on behalf of the British Government</p>
<p>   and also on behalf of the American administration. Thank you.</p>
<p>(Ends...)</p>
