TRANSCRIPT OF FARMERS FEDERATION OCTOBER 14,_ 1976<br />
P. M. Inaudible If all sections of the commpnity could adopt an equivalent<br />
attitude, I think we would work our way out of our difficulties<br />
very quickly indeed.<br />
The last few years and still the present, are obviously<br />
difficult for rural industries. National prosperity can't<br />
be built on a declining rural sector; on a rural sector that<br />
is not adequately profitable. It can't be built if the<br />
manufacturing industry isn't adequately profitable. All<br />
industries and all Australians are basically independent.<br />
The message from that address as I would understand it is<br />
that there is a basic unity within the Australian nation<br />
and all sections are, to some extent, dependent upon other<br />
sections in the Australian community. It is no good believing<br />
there will be prospetity in the factories and the cities<br />
unless there is also prosperity in the country side.<br />
We have had to give priority in our economic policies, as<br />
you know to attacking inflation. Without that we won't<br />
be able to restore profitability and both are essential<br />
for rural industries.<br />
In the wider community unless we sucessfully attack<br />
inflation, there won't be adequate jobs for people in<br />
Australia who want to work. Nothing destroys the incentive<br />
to invest for industries to advance more quickly than the<br />
kind of inflation that we have had over the past two or<br />
three years.<br />
In the months since the election we have brought Government<br />
spending under control and as you know, in the May statement,<br />
we have knocked off over $ 2,500 million in the estimates<br />
of expenditure. We ended up with a growth of 11% in the<br />
Commonwealth budget. It is worth noting that in all the<br />
states there was a much more significant growth in their<br />
budgetary expenditures than that. Some states still spent<br />
19% more this year than last year. States have still tried<br />
to come to usand say they haven't got enough resources.<br />
They have really got enough resources. It is a question of<br />
their own priorities. If some states want to have the<br />
abolition of probate duties which is something most of<br />
us probably hate the probate duties not the abolition<br />
a higher priority than other matters, then that is a<br />
matter for the state. But they can't pick up their own<br />
high priority. matter's and then come to us for the matters<br />
they put at the bottom of their list of priorities.<br />
The growth in their budgets has been significantly greater<br />
than ours.<br />
In this question of bringing expenditure under control,<br />
I think it is also worth just recalling for a moment what<br />
we have done for local government. There, the increase<br />
is 75% and up to $ L40 million and that was the largest<br />
increase in our budget and for a very deliberate purpose.<br />
We believe that there would be-too great a burden on rate<br />
payers in many parts of Australia, especially in rural<br />
areas and we hope that local government authorities would<br />
use these funds at the very minimum, to hold rates steady.<br />
Hopefully, even to reduce rates. I find that in some<br />
parts of Tasmania, local government authorities have<br />
increased rates by 20% in rural areas still in a time such as this </p>
<p>2.<br />
I find that very hard to understand because the rate payers<br />
can't stand these kinds of increases and all spheres of<br />
government have got to understand also that they can't go<br />
on spending more and more of other peoples incomes more<br />
in real terms each year especially when our gross national<br />
production is static, or as it was under the last year or two<br />
of Labor, actually declining. That is what creates the squeeze<br />
in the private sector. That is what creates the squeeze on<br />
farmers.<br />
When people come to us as they have on one or two occasions,<br />
and said what can they do about local government that has<br />
put up rates when they should hold them steady or even better<br />
reduce them. There is a short answer of course because the<br />
local government councils who makes these decisions are elected<br />
councils and they have to come up for re-election. Therefore,<br />
I would think it would be in the hands of rate payers themselves<br />
to determine what they can do for councils who will not exercise<br />
restraint in their own expenditure. I say that knowing quite<br />
well that there are demands on local government that are<br />
Important and have to be met. At the same time the increasing<br />
funds made available this year was creating an opportunity to<br />
local government to relieve the burden on their own constituents<br />
and I believe they ought to do it.<br />
in our own efforts to reduce expenditure, by the end of this<br />
year, the Public-Service will be over 25000 less than it would<br />
have been-under the guidelines operating under our predecessors.<br />
I think that is-a significant decrease. It is probably the<br />
first time for 25 or 26 years in which there has been an<br />
actual decrease.-. It has been a slow and steady increase in<br />
the size of the Service since November last year.<br />
We have undertaken significant reforms in the Federal system<br />
and I have spoken of these in relation to the states and also<br />
in relation to local government.<br />
We have fully-indexed personal taxes. This doesn't just apply<br />
to this year, it applies again on the first of July next year<br />
and everytyear thereafter so it stops the unlegislrated tax<br />
increase-tht comes with inflation. The effect of it of course<br />
is less, if inflation is less, as I hope it will be, as it must<br />
be, but nevertheless there is a continuing benefit in that<br />
particular legislation. It will require governments to be honest.<br />
On other fronts we have legislated for secret postal ballots<br />
in union elections. More and more unions are coming to conduct,<br />
as they now must,, their elections in those ways.<br />
We have undertaken specific measures expressing our concern<br />
with the limits of the funds available to us for rural industries.<br />
The investment-allowance applies to a large part of purchases.<br />
for rural industries. I know it doesn't help very greatly,<br />
the farmers who haven't got an income but nevertheless the<br />
allowance is there and for some rural industries it is of<br />
significant assistance.<br />
The reserve price for wool has increased on the new basis<br />
of and average 275cents a kilo on the old method of measuring<br />
the reserve price.-the market price is strong at the momentto<br />
provide longer termcstability, we said that that would<br />
apply as a minimum, not only for this year, but also for next<br />
year. Obviously we would hope to be in a position to be able<br />
to review that in the manner in which Australia would want for<br />
the next season. At least if it is established a mimium over<br />
a two year period. I believe that indicates confidence in the </p>
<p>industry which is in some degree a contrast with earlier<br />
attempts to reduce the floor price at a time when it was<br />
just starting to regain some confidence, that a move by<br />
the Government of the day which damaged confidence in<br />
the industry, for probably the following six or nine months.<br />
That I hope is past.<br />
We are pressing to get the legislation of income equalization<br />
deposit scheme introduced and passed in this session. There<br />
may be some drafting problems in relation to that but I believe<br />
we can do it. That scheme will at least apply to this years<br />
income.<br />
The negotiations and discussions fo~ r the establishment of a<br />
rural bank are proceding and there is no doubt that that bank<br />
is going to be established. We hope that existing banks in<br />
this position will want to be involved in it with us but if<br />
they don't the rural bank will be established in any case.<br />
I would like to issue a slight note of warning in relation<br />
to the rural bank. I suspect that some people think that<br />
it will solve all problems. It can solve some longer term<br />
problems where longer term finance is needed. We have also<br />
said it will be available for the purchase of producers<br />
equipment instead of having to go to hire purchase terms.<br />
It is not going to solve the problem unless there are<br />
adequate prices for the product the farmers have to sell.<br />
That is basic to the whole operation.<br />
The other thing can help and help quite considerably but<br />
they can't overcome the basic situation if the return to<br />
producers is inadequate.<br />
There have been measures to help the beef industry in rural<br />
reconstruction and there is no need I think for me to detail<br />
these.<br />
We are hopeful in the longer term and I can't place a time<br />
on it, that the markets in Europe-. will open again for beef.<br />
Also that markets in Japan will expand. This is going to<br />
take a pressing because they have got their own domestic<br />
beef lobby as we well know.<br />
In the United States we are in the middle of an argument<br />
at the present time because they are caught in a situation<br />
shortly-before an election where immense pressure is being<br />
brought by their own beef lobby and where the problem basically<br />
has been caused not by anything Australia has done.<br />
The problems are caused largely by imports from Canada<br />
imports into the United States.<br />
I think you probably know what has happened over the course<br />
of this year. The Americans have got a practice of having<br />
pre paid zones and beef was coming in<br />
and Australian beef was been used for processing and entry<br />
into the United States. This was legal. It was within<br />
United States law. Indeed, an attempt was made at some<br />
stage in the United States to make it unlawful for that<br />
entry to come in and Congress wouldn't buy it. To relieve<br />
the United States of.. pressure we said we wouldn't ship more<br />
beef through after September 10. That again was<br />
a voluntary action of ours. One that was within the law and<br />
one that didn't have to be taken. We have done what we can<br />
to assist them with that particular problem<br />
out of their own law or lack of will to take action<br />
against beef in But the real problem has come<br />
from Canada. Canada has always refused t~ o be part of a<br />
voluntary restraint arrangement into the United States. What<br />
they have always done is pencil in the amount of beef they<br />
think will come from Canada. This year they pencilled in 50 to </p>
<p>million pounds. It looks as if imports from Canada<br />
will be about 100 million pounds and that is about the<br />
extent of the United States problem for this import year<br />
to them. What we have been pressing obviously is that<br />
the quotas issued at the begining of the year should<br />
remain and there should be no reduction in those quotas.<br />
It has also been put in the strongest possible terms<br />
that any discriminatory action against any one country<br />
would not be something that the Australian Government<br />
or people would be able to understand. At one stage<br />
some of their officials were suggesting that the nice<br />
way to overcome the problem was for Australia alone<br />
to voluntarily agree to reduce its quota significantly<br />
below the amount that had been allotted to us. In-other<br />
words Australia was being expected to solve the problem<br />
caused by Canada and that was quite unacceptable to<br />
Doug Anthony and myself and the whole of the government.<br />
I am sure it would have been quite unacceptable to all<br />
of you.<br />
What decisions they make about these matters I can't tell.<br />
All I can say is, that I have been in direct'touch with<br />
the President twice; once to Doug Anthony when he was<br />
acting for me a few days ago; and on my own return I have<br />
also spoken to the Embassy and L-ouri: officials-in the<br />
United States are pressing the Australian case as strongly<br />
as a case can be put. It is obviously a matter of significant<br />
importance to beef producers over the next few weeks.<br />
We have widened the support that is available for drought<br />
in drought assistance.<br />
We have joined in the contemplation of the slaughter of<br />
cattle which is a solution to our problems that I don't<br />
like but in certain circumstances a number of states<br />
asked us to support that programme in this way and we<br />
have done it.<br />
I think there is some misunderstanding about the nature<br />
of the government's support for drought relief. There<br />
has always been a circumstance in which states meet<br />
a certain basic expenditure which hasn't been ordered<br />
for about 15 years, so with inflation it doesn't bear<br />
much relationship to their own budgetary capacities.<br />
They meet all the expenditure on agreed items up to<br />
that base amount and after that we pick up the total<br />
expenditure and go on picking it up without limit.<br />
The states objected to this saying that it was unfair<br />
that they had to meet the expenditure up to a base<br />
amount. So we said if you don't like that arrangement<br />
we will go dollar for dollar with you from the first<br />
dollar spent. They have either choice, I think they<br />
are going to stay with the old arrangement. The widening<br />
of the drought assistance is reasonably forthcoming and<br />
if there are new measures proposed that need to be examined<br />
they will be promptly.<br />
The superphosphate bounty has been continued and the IAC<br />
recommended that it be continued. I think that struck some<br />
of us with a degree of surprise in view of past history but<br />
nevertheless the IAC on that particular incident made what<br />
I certainly believe to be the appropriate and right decision.<br />
I think that some other farmeis bcl ev-\ e it is the right<br />
decision.<br />
There are acute problems of apple and pear industry that we </p>
<p>know and measures have been taken by the government to try<br />
and ease the burden in that particular area. Again a solution<br />
that we don't like to problems. We have eased the eligibility<br />
provision so that farmers can get unemployment assistance<br />
and in certain circumstances I think that has been quite<br />
essential. I think it is quite wrong that every other<br />
group in the Australian community could be eligible for<br />
unemployment assistance but a farmer, because he was living<br />
on his farm even if he presently didn't have work to do, was<br />
ineligible. Farmers in that kind of circumstance also of course are<br />
particularly benefited from the new system of family allowances.<br />
If you look at the percentage of people in low incomes and in<br />
a number of primary industries, they would not have been able<br />
to have benefited from the family rebates. Their incomes<br />
just wouldn't have been high enough to get that benefit.<br />
The new system of family allowances makes sure that that<br />
family will benefit.<br />
But we don't look to measures of that kind~ obviously as being<br />
more than a short term assistance because the objective is<br />
to move rural industries into a situation in which they can<br />
be profitable and adequately stand on their own feet with<br />
appropriate support and assistance and appropriate policies<br />
from government to enable that to occur.<br />
General economic recovery is critical to achieving that<br />
objective. The economy is recovering. Indicators are<br />
obviously mixed at this stage. After the events of the<br />
last two or three years, the recovery is clearly going to<br />
be slow. It is very easy to jam an ocean liner onto the<br />
rocks but not so easy to get that ocean liner off the rocks<br />
and sailing properly with all systems working well. We never<br />
said it would be quick before the elections. We said it would<br />
take the full three years to get the economy where we thought<br />
it ought to be. The Government has great confidence in the<br />
future of Australia's rural industry and it will be seeking<br />
to take its part and make sure that it is a viable and<br />
prosperous and happy future working in partnership with<br />
Australia's rural industries I am sure together we can<br />
achieve that.<br />
Mr President, the spirit within the spirit of that paragraph<br />
of your speech, your address that you read out, I have no<br />
doubt about the outcome.<br />
Gentlemen, I have great pleasure in declaring this conference<br />
open. </p>
