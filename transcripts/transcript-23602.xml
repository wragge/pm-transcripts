    <content><![CDATA[<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it is a real thrill to be here in my own electorate and itâs a real thrill to be joined by the local state Member, Mike Baird, who happens to be the Premier, as well as so many colleagues from around our country and I acknowledge all of them. I particularly acknowledge my friend and colleague Michaelia Cash, my friend and colleague Kevin Andrews, the Minister for Social Services.</p>
<p>As the brother of three sisters and as the father of three daughters, I shudder at the thought that there are women and children in our country who do not feel safe in their own homes and all too often it is because of someone else who lives in the same home.</p>
<p>Our homes should be refuges, not prisons, and we all have a duty to make our homes and our country a safe place for those we love.</p>
<p>There is no excuse for violence against women and children â never, ever.</p>
<p>It is, however, a shocking fact that one in three women over the age of 15 experience physical violence in their lifetimes.</p>
<p>I want to make it absolutely crystal clear that truly strong men never hurt women, they never hurt children. They do whatever they can to stop violence, particularly violence against the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>This Government â all governments â want to make our country safe â safe for everyone.</p>
<p>This Government made a key election commitment to fully implement the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children.</p>
<p>This issue is a challenge for all levels of government and it is a challenge for every part of our community.</p>
<p>We all must work together to stop the violence before it happens.</p>
<p>The Second Action Plan, which we are launching today, is about improving what we already do in terms of prevention, action and support.</p>
<p>It contains 26 practical measures that all governments agree are critical at this stage of the national plan to improve womenâs safety.</p>
<p>The plan has been developed on advice from the National Council to Reduce Violence against Women. The council spoke with thousands of people â literally thousands â it received hundreds of submissions and it held roundtables to construct a plan that is sensible, that is practical and which will make a real difference.</p>
<p>I thank my Ministerial colleague, Michaelia Cash. I also thank my Parliamentary Secretary Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells for their work chairing these round tables.</p>
<p>Now a key initiative of this plan is the development of a national domestic violence orders scheme. If women or children receive a court order to protect them in one state, that should protect them in all states. Domestic violence orders are court orders and they should be enforceable nationwide. If a woman moves interstate she shouldn't have to prove all over again that she's at risk.</p>
<p>Now this has been talked about for too long and now it must happen. This Second Action Plan will have a particular focus on stopping violence against indigenous women, women from culturally diverse backgrounds, and women with a disability because this is where urgent action is needed and where progress does need to be made.</p>
<p>But while there is so much to do, good things are happening. Things such as the Manly Women's Shelter to which Margie and I were introduced by the late Ellie Hunt. The women who are being helped by the Manly Women's Shelter are incredible women. Yes, they've suffered and yes, they face tough challenges but with the help of the shelter they're rebuilding their lives. My times with them have been a reminder that there must always be help and there must always be hope for the women and the children who face violence.</p>
<p>So can I say to everyone I am proud to be standing here with you today. I really am proud to be standing here with you today to make a stand against this terrible curse on our society. I am pleased to launch the Second Action Plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children and I thank everyone here for the contribution you've made to it.</p>
