    <content><![CDATA[<p>This morning on Brisbane radio the Premier of Queensland, Mr Beattie, made the extraordinary claim that he would find it difficult to put more funds into hospitals because Queensland hasn't received any extra money out of the GST, and does not expect additional money until 2006.</p>
<p>This claim is not borne out by the facts.</p>
<p> According to figures published recently by the Treasurer, and agreed to by all state and territory Treasuries, Queensland is the first state to receive a financial windfall from the GST (from 1 July 2003). Furthermore, over the coming five years, Queensland will receive in GST proceeds an additional $1.1 billion over and above what would otherwise have been received under previous revenue sharing arrangements.</p>
<p>This will provide Queensland with an ample source of funds for additional spending commitments.</p>
<p>The Premier himself should have remembered that on 5 March 2002 he explicitly acknowledged that Queensland would receive additional funds as a result of the GST.</p>
