    <content><![CDATA[<p>Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen will be remembered as one of Queensland's most influential political figures.</p>
<p>He was a powerful conservative who boldly advocated his convictions. While his views may often have differed from his political opponents, no-one could deny his love of Queensland.</p>
<p>The young Joh had a tough upbringing. He suffered from polio in one leg and his family struggled during the Depression. Rising above these challenges Joh demonstrated industrious abilities from an early age. He designed and constructed a successful peanut thresher, pioneered the use of scrub chain clearing and began an aerial spraying business.</p>
<p>In 1947, Joh entered the Queensland Legislative Assembly by winning the State seat of Nanango for the Country Party. From 1950 until 1987 he held the seat of Barambah. He was appointed a government minister in 1963, before becoming Premier of Queensland in 1968. He held that position for some 19 years and 3 months, the longest period of any Premier of that State.</p>
<p>Amongst his achievements were the abolition of death duties, the construction of the Wivenhoe dam and the Tarong power station as well as the fierce promotion of industrial and resource development in the State of Queensland.</p>
<p> He was knighted in 1984.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government, I extend to his wife Lady Flo, his son, John, daughters Helen, Meg and Ruth, and to other family members and friends, our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.  </p>
