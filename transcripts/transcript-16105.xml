    <content><![CDATA[<p>Morris Iemma has made a substantial contribution to public life in NSW over two decades.</p>
<p>Morris achieved much for NSW, both as a Senior Minister and Premier of Australia's largest state.</p>
<p>Morris put mental health on the national agenda, brought James Hardie to account and made tough decisions for NSW's future in the areas of desalination and energy reform.</p>
<p>Morris also recently oversaw a highly successful World Youth Day festival.</p>
<p>Morris' ability, work ethic and leadership skills were acknowledged in his elevation to Premier in 2005.</p>
<p>Two years later he delivered Labor a record fourth consecutive four-year term in NSW.</p>
<p>I wish Morris, Santina and their family all the best for the future.</p>
