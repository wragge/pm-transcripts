EMBARGO: 6.00 a. m<br />
31 March 1983<br />
FOR MEDIA 31 March 1983<br />
President Reagan has invited me to make an official working<br />
visit to the United States. I have accepted with great<br />
pleasure the President's invitation, and shall be meeting<br />
with him at the White House on 13 June, 1983.<br />
The United States and Australia have a strong tradition<br />
of friendship and co-operation and I look forward to<br />
this opportunity to talk with the President about matters<br />
of mutual interest.<br />
It is probable that I shall include visits to some other<br />
countries in the itinerary. Consideration is being given<br />
to this, and an announcement of the full program will be<br />
made in due course. 0<br />
