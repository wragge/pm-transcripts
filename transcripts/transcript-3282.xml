SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
AT A NATURALIZATION CEREMONY, LIVERPOOL COUNCIL CHAMBERS,<br />
3 JUNE 1974<br />
Australia has just come through a national election in<br />
which, whatever you may hear to the contrary, there were clear<br />
winners and clear losers. In the decision you are taking here this<br />
evening, however, there are no losers, only winners. The nation<br />
wins, because each new citizen represents an increase in the strength<br />
of our national family and our national spirit. And each of you, as<br />
a new citizen, wins personally from your choice to become an<br />
Australian. By accepting our invitation to citizenship, you have<br />
reaffirmed your earlier, perhaps hesitant, decision to seek your<br />
future among us. Tonight you are identifying yourself officially<br />
for the first time as Australians but you are not relinquishing<br />
anything you hold dear from your past life. Since the arrival of the<br />
first fleet in 1788, new settlers have been linking their own<br />
future with that of this land people of two worlds blending in a<br />
new loyalty to Australia. This has been our history and our strength<br />
and is no less true tonight. You are adopting the most realistic<br />
stance that you could adopt, one that accords with both the past and<br />
the future, with your own interests and with the nation's interests.<br />
Tonight you are acknowledging that your future is here<br />
in Australia, but you are not attempting to sever the old roots that<br />
will bind you forever to your first homeland. No one can dictate<br />
to you what your deepest feelings should be what should be in your<br />
heart tonight and I would not dare to try. Let me just say that<br />
your official status from tonight confers on you two grounds for<br />
pride, based on the strength of two cultures, two life-styles,<br />
your ' share of the heritage'. In that respect you are to be envied<br />
above those of us,, who share only one common heritage.<br />
The cumulative impact of the 817,000 people who since<br />
1949 have joined the national family-through citizenship has been<br />
to change the very concept and content of that citizenship. Today,<br />
people from more than 70 nations make up Australia, a nation<br />
subservient to none, firmly and responsibly seeking its own destiny.<br />
In the electorate of Werriwa alone, at the last census there were<br />
57,000 people born overseas nearly one third of the total population<br />
of the electorate. Thus we are creating a cohesive society of many<br />
parts, where cultural diversity can lend interest, charm and enjoyment<br />
to the national life without forfeiting that harmony, that inner sense<br />
of belonging ' together with' is the expression of true nationhood.<br />
One solid foundation for that harmony must be in<br />
equal and indivisible citizenship rights. For that reason the<br />
Government has already moved to end all discrimination in the conditions<br />
of citizenship. Today we have one criterion, one oath, one ceremony,<br />
with all discrimination banished. We make no distinctions on the<br />
grounds of national origin or former citizenship, and certainly none<br />
on the grounds of race. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The widespread approval given to this new approach is<br />
shown by the great increase in the rate of citizenship applications<br />
under the new provision which became operative on 1 December 1973.<br />
In 1972 a total of 38,402 people were granted citizenship. In 1973<br />
this figure jumped to 57,102 an increase of nearly 50%. Further,<br />
for the four months up to the end of April this year citizenship<br />
applications continued to increase at an even higher rate. The verdict<br />
of those who in the past eighteen months have decided to join the<br />
national family cannot be denied Australian citizenship today is<br />
more desirable than at any time in our history. The symbols of a<br />
strong independent nationhood are not a cheap gimmick, an empty<br />
gesture meant to impress ourselves rather than the world. There is<br />
a wide and deep current of agreement in our society about what our<br />
true national identity should be.<br />
There is another quite objective statistical measure<br />
of the confidence migrants now feel in Australia's future. The success<br />
of a national immigration program is shown not only in the personal<br />
efforts and sacrifices of those establishing themselves in a new land.<br />
It is revealed in the statistics of those who, having tried the<br />
great adventure, leave Australia with no intention of returning.<br />
Since the Labor Government came to power, these figures have declined<br />
from 33,172 in 1972 to 30,325 last year. This is the first<br />
significant decline since 1964 in what we call the ' migrant drift',<br />
and represents a resurgence of optimism in what Australia offers to<br />
newcomers. Many of the things which have persuaded you, and thousands<br />
of your fellow-migrants, to become Australian citizens are the result<br />
of one man's efforts on behalf of our migrant people. That man is<br />
Al Grassby, the Minister for Immigration a great friend, a stalwart<br />
colleague, a true patriot, a fine Australian. No one has worked<br />
harder for the welfare of migrants and achieved more solid and lasting<br />
benefits for them and their families. It is a sad and bitter blow to<br />
O me and the government that we have temporarily lost the services of<br />
Al Grassby. It is a tragic irony that the forces he opposed so<br />
staunchly and successfullyas a Minister, as a member of Parliament<br />
the forces of hate, of prejudice, of ignorance, of racial<br />
distrimination have now helped to defeat him. I know you will regret<br />
this event as profoundly as I do. I know you will repudiate the<br />
campaign tactics used against him, just as I and all decent Australians<br />
repudiate them. They have no place in Australia, they have no place<br />
in the kind of open and tolerant society that Al Grassby worked so<br />
hard to achieve. I pay tribute to him here tonight. Ceremonies such<br />
as this, here and all over Australia, are eloquent testimony to the<br />
achievements of his public career, the strength of his character, the<br />
breadth of his vision and the power of his ideals.<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government and people Ii<br />
welcome you all as new citizens of our nation and wish you every<br />
happiness and success in the future. </p>
