I. SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES<br />
AT NATURALISATION CEREMONY, PERTH, ON 24TH JULI, 9Q6l.<br />
Sir, Parliamentary colleagues, and ladies and gentlemen:<br />
I want to say a few words to those who are, tonight, taking a step<br />
which in the life of any human being is a very, very important one. Those of us<br />
who have had the good fortune to be born in a country, to live in it, to-enjoy<br />
its life, to take our citizenship for granted, can't know very much about what is<br />
involved in pulling up the roots of the family and moving into another country,<br />
moving right across the world and entering into a new life, and a new<br />
citizenship. This is a very remarkable event.<br />
Whenever I think about it I say to myself " What does persuadq people<br />
to move from one country to another?" I might ask you ladies and gentlem3n<br />
tonight, " What was it that persuaded you to leave your ancient home, and to come<br />
here?" There have been times in the world's history when people loft their own<br />
country because they were, in effect, driven out of it we have seen something<br />
of that in the modern world; we have seen something of that in the last<br />
thirty years of human history people being compelled to leave hone, so to<br />
speak, because home was no longer home, no longer the kind of home they wanted<br />
to live in. These are the tragic events of modern history. And when that<br />
event happens to anybody there must be one passion in the heart, and that is to<br />
go to the country where those things can't happen to you, to come out of a<br />
country whoa~ freedom has been snatched away from it, and to come to a country<br />
where freedom will be defended by everybody, whatever political party he may<br />
belong to,. whatever religion he may profess, where everybody is agreed that we<br />
are free people, free, as Mr. Cash says, to pray as we want to pray, to speak awe<br />
want to speak, to assemble as we want to assemble.<br />
Well, of course, there have been other movements in the world's recent<br />
history or modern history in which people left and came to another country<br />
because they saw in that'new country an opportunity which they didn't see at<br />
home: not driven out, but drawn out by the prospect of a new life.<br />
In case any of you who are being naturalised tonight think that we<br />
political fellows here on the platform are tr-ating you as if you were scanething<br />
apart, let me say this to you: there is not a man on this platform, and not a<br />
woman on this platform, who didn't have a grandfather, or a great-grandfather,<br />
who came to Australia he might not have been called at that time a " migrant",<br />
or a " new Australian" ( Laughter, applause) so you know we are all the same,<br />
aren't we? Don't let yourself feel that you are a sort of something apart,<br />
something odd in the Australian community, because you are not. Let me tell you-<br />
I'll speak only for myself: on my father's side, my grandfather and my<br />
grandmother came to Australia from Scotland. Now any Scot here tonight would say<br />
" What a mistake". ( Laughter) " To leave Scotland to come here'." But they came<br />
here and looking back on it I've no doubt they said, " A very good country to go<br />
to, Australia, because although we will be ' new Australians' when we get there,<br />
our grandson will be Prime Minister"' ( Laughtor, applause) You make a note of<br />
that. Put little Willy's name down. ( Laughter) Stranger things have<br />
happened. On my mother's side my grandparents came out because my<br />
grandfather on her side thought that there was gold in Australia. Instead of<br />
looking for it in Kalgoorlie, which might have been a rather successful thing to<br />
do, he looked for it in vain in another part, in the State of Victoria. He was,<br />
I suppose, a new Australian. I don'-t know.<br />
You see the point I am getting at? Your grandchildren will be as much<br />
old native-born Australians as I am today. ( Applause) And so I want to say to<br />
you: don't feel odd, Some of you may face language difficulties, although I am<br />
staggered at the skill and speed with which people learn to speak, not only<br />
English, but Australian ( Laughter) you know, a slight complication upon<br />
standard English. But don't be worried if you think that you speak our<br />
language indifferently. I remember I had a colleague, once, a genial character,<br />
rather rough and ready, to use our idiom, who had to receive a French football<br />
team. They arrived and the leader of the team said to my colleague, " Excuse,<br />
please, I don't speak English very well" and my colleague, with a flash of<br />
candour said, " Don't worry about that, old boy, neither do ( Loughter) </p>
<p>But all those things are passing phases. It is quite true that many<br />
of us had grandparents who came here from what we call the " old country", from<br />
England, from Scotland, Wales, from Ireland, wherever it might be, and so there<br />
were none of these problems of language, although even there there were some<br />
some. And many of you have come from ancient countries in Europe and you have<br />
different tongues, different backgrounds, marvellous histories, marvellous<br />
literature, marvellous music. You carry with you an enormous store in the mind<br />
and in the heart. These are tremendous contributions to Australia. It was said<br />
a little while ago that migration has meant something tremendous to Australia in<br />
the post-war years and I want to repeat it. It is tremendously true.<br />
I go around Australia a good deal in order to have the pleasure of<br />
having one man out of ten say " Good on you" do you know that idiom? a:. d the<br />
other ten saying " Baaa'" All this, of course, is the veryproof of freedom in<br />
Australia. Prime Ministers here don't go around with a posse of police around<br />
them: they just go around. Sometimes people are friendly; and sometimes they<br />
are not. And the Prime Minister hopes for the best, being by nature and<br />
experience a good high-spirited fellow, you see.<br />
But when I look around this country, for whose political leadership,<br />
rightly or wrongly, I have been responsible for a long, long time, I can't<br />
imagine that Australia would be as prosperous, as happy, as forward looking,<br />
today, if it hadn't been for this remarkable inflow of good people into<br />
Australia. ( Applause)<br />
It has been a wonderful thing for us and I want every one of you who<br />
will be naturalised tonight to realise that this is not all one way. We are not<br />
just being nice to you: we are grateful to you. And you are not just to be<br />
grateful to us for having received you: I want you to feel a proper pride in<br />
what you find yourselves able to do in Australia. In some of the greatest<br />
. ndustries that I know of in Australia the progress would have been a mere<br />
fraction of what it is today if it hadn't been for hundreds of thousands cf<br />
people coming in willing to work, willing to contribute, willing to become good<br />
contributing citizens of Australia. Anybody who knows anything about our great<br />
industries will realise at once that what we call the great migration programme<br />
has been of immeasurable benefit.<br />
So I just want to say to you: don't be nervous, as if you were in a<br />
strange land, because, as I explained to you before, your grandsons willbe on<br />
the same footing as I am tonight. There is no occasion to feel nervous or<br />
strange. Don't feel that any man's hand is against you. Because the only really<br />
unpopular people in Australia are politicians and football umpires. ( Laughter)<br />
It is a great thing, a difficult thing for you, the parents, a<br />
difficult thing; a difficult thing for you who, having reached mature years have<br />
had to make this great change, I know, a tremendously difficult decision to make.<br />
But for your children, for your children, this is the land of opportunity., I am<br />
perfectly certain that nobody who looks at it along these lines will ever doubt<br />
that it was a great thing tc come here. We are a friendlypeople. We are not<br />
stuffy. We are not consumed by snobberies of class, or some of this nonsense<br />
that has beset some of the older countries of the world. You are in an<br />
essentially democratic country where every man has a chance to stand on his own<br />
feet, and every woman, and to be taken at his or her own true value by other<br />
people. Nothing could be better than that: to be free, to feel that there is no<br />
shadow over you, to feel that there is none of the paraphernalia of dictatorship<br />
in this country, that we are, in the truest sense, a friendly community, a<br />
brotherhood, and a sisterhood of people.<br />
And so we are, in Australia where any boyor girl has a vi: ta of<br />
opportunity which can be marched along provided there is ability and character<br />
and courage and determination a country of freedom, of equality before -the law,<br />
a country which governs itself at its own will, through the people it chooses,<br />
without compulsion of anybody else, to serve it in Parliament or municipal life.<br />
This is, I am proud to say, in ray opinion the freest country in the worl.<br />
