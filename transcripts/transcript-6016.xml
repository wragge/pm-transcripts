Imzprovement Plan to his Minister.<br />
Following the election, the rsovernment will ta. Xe all<br />
necessary action to consider the details of the reconumendat ions<br />
and implement them as a matter of priority.<br />
The Joint Cominittee. of Public Accounts Report on the Selection<br />
and Development of Senior Managers in the Commonwealth<br />
Public Service deals in greater detail with some of the matters<br />
discussed in the Rleview of Commonwealth Administration, and<br />
contains many recomnmendat ions and suggestions which, in effect,<br />
amnplify the Review. The Government intends to make a<br />
detailed response to that Report to the new Parliartent, but<br />
to the exctent that it is consistent with the Review, its<br />
detailed suggestions will be ta)~ en up as a part of the<br />
implementation of the Review.<br />
The Governmrent will also consider putting forward the<br />
Review's proposals through the normal Parliamentary, processes<br />
relating to:<br />
a reform of Parliamentary sitting times<br />
* a referendum to enable the appointthent of members<br />
of Parliament to assist Ministers.<br />
I would like to thank. onoe again Mr Reid, Sir Ronald Elliott<br />
ahd Proferssor John Rose, together witb their support staff,<br />
for producing a report which contains sensible, realistic<br />
but imaginative specific proposals to ensure that Cormnowealth<br />
Administration i. z better able, by building on its current<br />
achieve-mcnts, to meet the challenge of rapid change, a ne--essaryj<br />
wntrol ov; er resources, greater public scrvtiny and<br />
technological development.<br />
