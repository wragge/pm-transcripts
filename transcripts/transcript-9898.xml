ACTING PRIME MINISTER<br />
HOWARDS HOLLOW PROMISE<br />
John H-oward's promise today that he would guarantee that workers receive the<br />
same rate of pay under his Industrial relations system simply cannot be believed.<br />
It runs counter to a raft of previous statements he has made on Industrial<br />
relations, Including his wholehearted embracing of the Victorian and Western<br />
Australian Industrial relations systems.<br />
Australians should remember that Jeff Ken nett promised Victorian workers<br />
before the 1990 State election: " You won't lose a dollar".<br />
Since then workers have seen: all State awards abolished, leave loadings for all<br />
Victorian workers abolished with workers losing an average of $ 430 before tax<br />
each year; sick leave entitlements reduced and no entitlement to pro-rata sick<br />
leave; no entitlement to redundancy pay; and the independent Victorian iRC<br />
abolished. That is why 400,000 workers have fled Jeff Kennett's Industrial relatins system<br />
and transferred to federal awards.<br />
In Western Australia overtime, penalty rates, holiday loadings and hours of work<br />
are not guaranteed. The minimum houriy rate for young peopie is $ 3.77 an<br />
hour, This Is the system that John Howard said he would like to see throughout<br />
Australia. If the Opposition Leader today genuinely wanted to ensure that workers should<br />
keep their current award and conditions, why then has he campaigned so long<br />
for industrial relations reform?<br />
His belittling of the union movement today and his sidelining of the IRC are code<br />
language for an outright attack on the job security of workers, and In the end,<br />
wage cuts. It would also lead to massive Industrial confrontation, just like John<br />
Howard's bad old days. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The only guarantee of workers' wages Is the Government's, which Is enforceable<br />
through the IRC.<br />
The employment advocate which Mr Howard proposes to have replace the IRC<br />
would do no more than in effect file workplace agreements. It would not have<br />
the power to protect the rights and conditions of Australian workers.<br />
Under Mr Howard, Australian workers would have to finally seek fair conditions<br />
at employment through civii courts. This would be ridiculously expensive and<br />
cause major delays.<br />
Despite Mr Howard's professed concern for Austraian youth, he did littie today<br />
to guarantee work and training opportunities for young people.<br />
He owes young Australians the detail of his real plans, which undoubtediy will<br />
inciude cutting their wages, removing their conditions and abolishing Working<br />
Nation programs.<br />
