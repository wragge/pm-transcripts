PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, CANBERRA RACECOURSE, 7 MAY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister would you encourage moves by the<br />
Labor Party to not run a candidate against Mr Macphee if he<br />
ran as an independent?<br />
PM: It's purely hypothetical. Mr Macphee is yet to make a<br />
statement about what he's going to do. I don't see any<br />
benefit for me or Mr Macphee in speculating about what will<br />
happen. The only certain thing is of course that the<br />
Liberal Party has demonstrated conclusively its lurch to the<br />
extreme right. Now how that develops to Mr Macphee's<br />
advantage or ours is a matter that will be worked out in the<br />
future.<br />
JOURNALIST: What should he do then, Sir?<br />
PM: It's not a matter for me to tell Mr Macphee what to<br />
do. I wouldn't presume to tell Mr Macphee what he should<br />
do. That's his business.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will this whole incident rebound on Mr Howari?<br />
PM: Yes. It already has.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think this will be the turning point as<br />
to whether they'll win or lose the election?<br />
PM: That point was passed a long time ago. They were never<br />
going to win it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke what about the possibility of an Aci'<br />
Liberal/ Labor coalition?<br />
PM: Well it conjures up some remarkable pictures doesn't<br />
it. I really haven't been involved in that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you support it?<br />
PM: Again, if the Party here were to work out that that's<br />
the only way in which there could be a sensible governing<br />
position arrived at, well then I guess we could live with<br />
that. JOURNALIST: Is it important for the ACT Labor Party </p>
<p>PM: Let me say that if it happens here there is no chance<br />
of it happening anywhere else at a state or a federal level.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well if it did happen would it be embarrassing<br />
to the federal sphere?<br />
PM: No it wouldn't be embarrassing to-me. I think the<br />
embarrassment would perhaps be for the Liberal Party to some<br />
extent. But I mean they have now got a system here which<br />
has sown up some very strange results and some people might<br />
regard this as sort of a crowning of achievement in an<br />
episode of rather bizarre developments.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about the fact that your Labor Party's<br />
been talking with the No Self Government Party with a<br />
possibility of a coalition.<br />
PM: I've run out of interest in this subject my friend.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke do you think now that people who are<br />
against Mr Howard might see it as a good time to challenge<br />
him for the leadership at all?<br />
PM: There's been a serious undercurrent against Mr Howard<br />
now for over a year, very intense and the only reason he's<br />
there is that they can't discover anyone who they think's<br />
got any qualities of leadership to replace him. But I think<br />
the councils of desperation may be accelerating a bit now.<br />
