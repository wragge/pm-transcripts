PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 30 SEPTEMBER 1979<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
During last week what has now become known as the Finnane Report<br />
was tabled in the New South Wales Parliament.<br />
This was a report compiled on the directions of the Attorney-General<br />
of Mr Walker, on behalf of the N. S. W. Labor government.<br />
It is important that the nature of the Report be understood and<br />
it is also important that the role of the N. S. W. Government be<br />
understood. Mr Finnane was asked to enquire into the business<br />
affairs of a number of companies which Mr Sinclair, former<br />
Minister for Primary Industry was associated with.<br />
The inquiry was conducted in private, witnesses gave their<br />
evidence to Mr Finnane in private, there was none of the normal<br />
cross-examination that would occur in a court of law, there was<br />
no testing of evidence by counsel as would occur in a court of<br />
law. There was no opportunity to examine the credibility of<br />
witnesses as in a court of law.<br />
As a result of this process, Mr Finnane came to his personal<br />
conclusions and findings. We need to ask whether this is a<br />
reasonable way for the N. S. W. government to conduct its investigations.<br />
We need to understand that the conclusions in the Finnane Report<br />
could not be presented in a court of law. Its findings are not<br />
facts, they are the opinions of Mr Finnane, after taking evidence<br />
in the way which I have described.<br />
None of this represents a criticism of Mr Finnane, because as<br />
I am advised, it is not unusual for such inquiries to be conducted<br />
in this manner.<br />
It is a criticism of the N. S. W. procedure. It is hard to believe that<br />
the N. S. W. government did not intend the tabling of the Report-I<br />
to be damaging to Mr Sinclair. As I am advised, and from the<br />
Financial Review editorial of last Friday, 28 September, there<br />
was a lock-up for journalists and officials were busy pointing<br />
out the particular pieces of greatest damage to Mr Sinclair.<br />
That had nothing whatever to do with justice. It might have a<br />
great deal to do with politics, but it is surely plain that an<br />
inquiry of this kind, on the direction of the Attorney-General<br />
should not be exploited for political purposes, with political<br />
objectives. If that is to be the part of the N. S. W. Attorney-General / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
the normal protection of the law is absent and any person could<br />
be arbitrarily destroyed.<br />
The N. S. W. government sought not only to introduce the matter<br />
into the public arena, through tabling in its own Parliament<br />
in a way damaging to Mr Sinclair. There was clearly a degree<br />
of co-operation with the Federal opposition in Canberra which<br />
over much of the last two years has sought to introduce material<br />
under cover of Parliamentary privilege and create a poisonous<br />
atmosphere in relation to Ian Sinclair.<br />
If there had been no inquiry, if there had been no examination, if<br />
there had been no possibility of a prosecution, one could have<br />
understood the Opposition's tactics in seeking to reveal and to<br />
probe. But that was not the case, there was an inquiry sponsored<br />
by the Labor government of N. S. W. Mr Sinclair himself had<br />
referred the matters to the Corporate Affairs Commission and<br />
to the Taxation Commissioner so inquiries were in train. There<br />
was no question of the matters not being properly examined.<br />
There was no need for Parliamentary debate to expose, because<br />
the matter was under a most vigorous examination under the<br />
direction of the N. S. W government.<br />
Against that background, any introduction of the matter into<br />
the Federal Parliament is plainly designed to poison the atmosphere<br />
against Mr Sinclair, under cover of Parliamentary privilege.<br />
It is important to note that while there were allegations against<br />
Ian Sinclair in the Finnane Report, no prosecution has yet been<br />
launched. No official charges have been made by the law authorities<br />
in N. S. W. but a most damaging report has been published, and<br />
widely publicised.<br />
Is it reasonable for such a report to be published in these<br />
circumstances?-1s it reasonable for a government to undertake<br />
actions of that kind to publish such a report when it has<br />
not yet made up its mind whether it intends to prosecute or not?<br />
The allegations have been made against Ian Sinclair. How can<br />
his position be determined and finally resolved?<br />
Unless the N. S. W. government takes some action the allegations<br />
will stay in the air. They have been made. The only thing<br />
Ian Sinclair would be able to do to answer those charges is to<br />
make his own statement of the position as he sees it.<br />
That does not dismiss the charges. That does not end the<br />
speculation. They are still there in the public domain.<br />
There is only one way these allegations can be finally determined.<br />
There is probably only one way Ian Sinclair's innocence, or<br />
otherwise, could be proved and that it through the normal court<br />
processes. ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
I know that is what Ian Sinclair wants. An opportunity to prove<br />
his innocence through the processes of law through a fair trial.<br />
Surely in all fairness Australia owes that much to any person,<br />
whether they are a public figure or somebody who shuns publicity<br />
and merely seeks to go about his own business.<br />
But have not the circumstances been established in which Ian Sinclair<br />
is almost unable to attract a fair trial?<br />
How many people would there be in our ccrmunity uninfluenced by-the * publicity,<br />
uninfluenced one way or another by that Report tabled in the<br />
N. S. W. Parliament?<br />
The way this matter has been handled by the N. S. W. government<br />
creates a very real doubt as to whether the due processes of<br />
the law are now adequate to enable Ian Sinclair fairly to have<br />
his opportunity to have his day in court.<br />
And yet, despite that heavy qualification there are only three<br />
options open.<br />
The Finnane Report and its findings can be left hanging in the<br />
air, with theJN. S. W. government taking no action whatsoever. If<br />
that is the course they pursue a grave and serious injustice<br />
will have been done. An injustice that would condemn the<br />
N. S. W. government for every day that it exists.<br />
The secon * d course of action would be for the N. S. W. government<br />
to launch a prosecution. Mr Walker might continue to say<br />
that that is a matter for Mr Finnane to recommend and I understand<br />
that he has been told to come back from his holdiay to form his<br />
recommendations but they will only be recommendations.<br />
The N. S. W. Crown Solicitor would make his own recommendations.<br />
But it would be Mr Walker as Attorney-General who would finally<br />
be able to say whether or not that prosecution would proceed.<br />
There is no way the Attorney-General can avoid that decision.<br />
He cannot disassociate himself from it. If he acquiesces in<br />
what a Crown Solicitor might decide, he still gives that his<br />
support. Such a prosecution, despite the qualifications that I have<br />
mentioned offers by far the best hope of justice being done<br />
and the truth finally revealed.<br />
And finally if the.: N. S. W. governme -nt is not prepared to launch<br />
that prosecution, the only other option which would leave any<br />
dignity to the government cf N. S. W. would be for the Finnane<br />
Report to be totally repudiated by Mr Wran and his government.<br />
If they do not prosecute, if they are advised that a prosecution<br />
could not be sustained, if there is any justice left in the State<br />
of N. S. W. so far asthis'case is concerned the Report must be<br />
repudiated. The Sinclair case, the Finnane Report, is a very significant event.<br />
Not merely because it involves a senior Minister of my government<br />
but because it throws bare to the light of day, a contemporary<br />
challenge to the rule of law, to the right to a fair trial, and<br />
to the role of the Parliament. / 4 </p>
<p>4-<br />
There are many quasi-judicial tribunals, there are many<br />
investigative bodies established by governments. A number of<br />
them conduct their inquiries in the same manner that Mr Finnane<br />
conducted his. Should there be some new rules for the conduct<br />
of such inquiries?<br />
The reports, once made, are handled in different ways. Clearly<br />
there needs to be much greater care in the way the reports<br />
are handled, and the purpose for which they are used.<br />
Because if Ian Sinclair can be denigrated and damaged in the<br />
public mind as a result of the Finnane Report, next week, next<br />
month, next year that same process could be used against you or<br />
any other member of the Australian community.<br />
The last matter which needs seriously to be examined is the role<br />
of Parliament when such investigations are under way. Should<br />
the Parliament allow itself to debate these matters, to have<br />
evidence introduced, or what is alleged to be evidence, part heard,<br />
inadequately understood andoutof its proper context? If such<br />
matters concerned a case in a court of law, Parliaments could not,<br />
and would not, behave in that way. But as we have seen these<br />
processes are capable of very severely damaging, and are<br />
capable of even destroying the reputation of people.<br />
Going beyond the Sinclair affair and the Finnane Report, there<br />
are serious matter of principle involved. They affect all<br />
governments and your Commonwealth government is certainly not<br />
prepared to ignore these matters.<br />
For the rmrent it is up to the N. S. W. government whether they<br />
prosecute, or will they themselves repudiate the Finnane Report?<br />
They have no other option that will leave them with any dignity<br />
or any honour. </p>
