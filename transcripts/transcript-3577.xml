JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
GIVEN BY THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER, MR. E. G. WHITLAM<br />
AND PRIME MINISTER OF THE NETHERLANDS, MR. J. M. DEN UYL,<br />
IN THE HAGUE, 6 JANUARY 1975<br />
Well, Ladies and Gentlemen, our Australian friends are very<br />
short of time, therefore we will immediately start and make your<br />
questions very short.<br />
DEN UYL: Well only a very few introductory remarks as to have<br />
as much time as possible for Mr. Whitlam and your questions. Let<br />
me say how very glad we are to have the opportunity to have this<br />
exchange of thoughts. We dealt with the position of Australia<br />
in the world, the position of Holland in the European community<br />
the way Australia looks upon the European community and the role<br />
of Holland in it, questions of co-operation in development aid<br />
and in the relation, of course, thepolicies towards Indonesia.<br />
And besides that we dealt with a number of bilateral questions.<br />
Well, I would think that is enought introduction and I would<br />
like Mr. Whitlam to put forward a few introductory remarks.<br />
WHITLAM: You will see from what the Prime Minister has said<br />
the range of matters which we discussed. It has been a very<br />
fruitful weekend and the Prime Minister, his wife too, may I<br />
say, and his Ministers and his officials have spent very many<br />
hours witht he Australian party. It has been very easy for us to<br />
exchange views because our countries are exceptionally similar.<br />
Sure we are remote in geography, we are disparate in size, but we<br />
have the same population we have the same average income, we<br />
are among the most highly industrialisedcountries in the world,<br />
we are among the largest trading countries in the world and of<br />
course the Governments are fraternal ones. Six years ago I<br />
was in the Netherlands and met Mr. Den Uyl for the first time<br />
and we since have become Prime Minister at the same time.<br />
DEN UYL: I became so just a few months after the elections.<br />
WHITLAM: Yourelection system is confusing to other people and<br />
ours is confusing to other people. Your election took place<br />
some days before ours in 1972, but it took some months to<br />
achieve a decision as to who was to be Prime Minister. </p>
<p>Last May we had an election and it was three months before we<br />
knew who were to be the members of the Parliament. So it is<br />
indicative of the stress under which all western societies,<br />
even those with the benefit of social democrat Governments,<br />
Labour these days. It has been a very fruitful weekend and<br />
since the Netherlands makes a quite exceptionally disproportionate<br />
contribution to the EEC, the OECD, to International bodies in<br />
general. It has been valuable to us not only for the understanding<br />
of the world as a whole and particularly of the<br />
countries with which we compare ourselves. So thank you very<br />
much for what you have done in the party, in the Government,<br />
among officials, over Friday, Saturday, Sunday and now Monday.<br />
QUESTIONE Were any decisions taken during the negotiations<br />
during the weekend?<br />
DEN UYL: You might not call them decisions, because we did not<br />
have a particular agenda on which to negotiate but we made<br />
some appointments on wider consultations, on migration problems,<br />
on co-operation and development fields, on questions of uranium,<br />
and the ultracentrifuge installationswe have in Holland<br />
just appointments for wide a prolonged consultations.<br />
QUESTIONS: Mr. Prime Minister, there is a quite big rumour<br />
that there is a big contract for Australia selling uranium to<br />
either the EEC. ( Sic). Whtat is true about this rumour and is<br />
Holland interested in uranium or what?<br />
WHITLAM: As I understand this situation the EEC cannot<br />
collectively enter in to contracts concerning uranium. Obviously<br />
the Australians will be discussing the general situation of<br />
uranium in each of the EEC countries they visit and we will be<br />
visiting half a dozen of them. Any specific contracts have to<br />
be made with individual countries as things stand at the<br />
moment. Nevertheless the development of Australia's vert great<br />
uranium resources it is believed we posses one-fifth of the<br />
proven uranium resources in the world the development of these<br />
is a matter of international concern and negotiation because<br />
Australia does not have the technology and Australia by herself<br />
does not have the capital to develop these resources as far as </p>
<p>-3-<br />
they have to be developed and as far as we would like them to<br />
be developed in Australia. The Netherlands is associated with<br />
Britain and West Germany I have already visited Britain and I<br />
shall be visiting West Germany in one particular process<br />
for enriching uranium. Very naturally Australia and Japan,<br />
which are conducting a feasibility study into the question of<br />
enriching Australia's uranium, will be interested in the<br />
attitude of these three countries which have this particular<br />
process. QUESTION: There were no appointments made about selling uranium<br />
to the Netherlands?<br />
WHITLAM: There were no contracts mabe, no, no, no.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister was there any specific discussion on<br />
provision of technology?<br />
WHITLAM: The provision of technology was very obviously one<br />
of the matters discussed.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Prime Minister we understand that you discussed<br />
the need for Great Britain to stay in the Common Market. Can<br />
you elaborate on that in any way please?<br />
WHITLAM: I do not want to give the impression that I would be<br />
telling the British what they should do and I am sure my<br />
colleague does not wish to give that impression either. But<br />
nevertheless it is relevant for Australia to express her attitude<br />
about Britain's membership of the community since traditionally<br />
Britain was Australia's biggest trading partner. She is by no<br />
means Australia's biggest trading partner now. We look at<br />
questions of trade these days in terms of the Community and the<br />
Community is the largest trading partner of Australia now. I<br />
can say that there is no possible advantage, in the Australian<br />
Government's view, in Britain leaving -the Community. Previous<br />
Australian Governments may have given that impression. I fear<br />
they did give that impression not only in Britain when the<br />
Conservatives and Labor has sought to join the Community,<br />
but they also gave that impression among the six who then<br />
constituted the Community. They gave the impression that </p>
<p>Australia resented Britain joining the Community and they gave<br />
the impression that they wanted to frustrate any such accession<br />
by Britain and now my Government takes no such attitude and<br />
certainly should leave no such impreesion. There is in our<br />
view no possible advantage to Australia in Britain leaving<br />
the Community. I suppose I can go further and say that these<br />
days so many things depend on international co-operation.<br />
It is absurd for the west to be so divided as it is. We are<br />
in our social and economic and political habits in Australia,<br />
a western country, and we believe it strengthens our sort of<br />
societies, the mixed economies the hitherto affluent countries<br />
of the world, the countries which trade and manufacture for<br />
them to work together. Accordingly, I suppose, I hope it is not<br />
regarded as too muck out of place that we believe that the<br />
west in general will be much stronger, happier, more effective<br />
if it works together. And that includes Britain working with<br />
her neighbours on the continent.<br />
DEN UYL: May I add one word to what Mr Whitlam said about<br />
Britain. It was rather peculiar to discover that I would think<br />
that there are hardly any other countries inthe world that<br />
would be so eager to see Britain within the European Community<br />
than Australia and the Netherland. That was our experience of<br />
discussing these affairs.<br />
QUESTION: Could I reverse that question in other words would<br />
you that Australia might be worse off if Britain were to<br />
leave the Common Market?<br />
WHITLAM: I do not want to speculate on whether Britain will<br />
leave the Common Market. I cannot tell what would happen if she<br />
did. QUESTION: Mr. Prime Minister, changing the subject somewhat, we<br />
are in a part of the world which particularly felt the effects<br />
of the Arab oil embargo and which has felt the effects of the<br />
increase in oil prices. Can you spell out here Australia's<br />
attitude to American initiatives for an oil-sharing scheme and<br />
also can you tell us now whether Australia will attend the<br />
conference of consuming nations which America proposes? </p>
<p>WHITLAM: Well no arrangements have been made yet. Obviously<br />
I have discussed in each of the European countries I visited this<br />
general question, that is, the possibility of disrupting the<br />
whole infra-structure upon which trading countries have relied<br />
up till now and the access to resources. Australia's situation<br />
is not entirely the same as that of western Europe. Quite<br />
obviously that must be the case because we do have ample energy<br />
resources ourselves in general and we are situated on the other<br />
side of the oil-rich lands.<br />
QUESTION: Do you have any other...<br />
WHITLAM: No I will not elaborate at this stage.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Prime Minister, can I ask a question on<br />
immigration? I was tlaking to Dr. Moss Cass, Minister for the<br />
Environment and Conservation. He said zero population was for<br />
the time being the policy of Australia because that would give<br />
an example on how to keep population down on the planet,<br />
while Mr. Tom Uren said the one percent population increase<br />
was his policy, but the one percent population increase, as the<br />
average is 1.9, cancels out the 0.8 percent increase in immigration.<br />
Has any commitment been made during your visit? Did you discuss<br />
the question or can you give any information on the immigration<br />
policy as far as the Dutch...<br />
WHITLAM: I will not respond to your kind references to my<br />
colleagues. My practice is not to comment in terms of what<br />
other people are reported or thought to have said. So I<br />
therefore overlook what you said them. You will accept that I hope<br />
with good grace. Now on the question of immigration that is,<br />
you asking my views. Well, that is fair enough. There has been<br />
a diminution in migration from western Europe since the 1950' s.<br />
There have been for very many years now migrants from, say the<br />
Netherlands to Australia. There are about 160,000 people in<br />
Australia who migrated from the Netherlands, but most of them<br />
came in earlier years. With increasing prosperity and security<br />
in western Europe we have found that the number of people from<br />
the Netherlands and other western European countries has declined. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Most of the migrants to Australia now come from Southern<br />
Europe from Italy, and Malta, Yugoslavia, Greece, Cyprus.<br />
There has been a reduction in the target of migrants which the<br />
Australian Government has sought. The immediate reason for<br />
that has been the extent of unemployment in Australia. It is<br />
no kindness to the people coming to Australia or the people<br />
who are already there to have people competing for too few<br />
jobs. Also there is probably an overall situation: migrants<br />
particularly in the last ten years or so, have settled in Sydney<br />
and Melbourne which are already growing too much. And<br />
furthermore we were finding the Australia was losing a great<br />
number of migrants becuase Australia's socialservices, health<br />
service, housing facilities, were not as good as those for<br />
instance in western Europe. Our social services can't compete<br />
with those of the Netherlands although they have been improved<br />
immensely in the two years of my Government. And furthermore<br />
we have now made the payment of social services to people who<br />
have earned them in Australia available to them anywhere in the<br />
world. In the Netherlands particularly, we found that there<br />
were a great number of people who had worked and settled very<br />
happily in Australia but as they became older, decided to<br />
retire in the Netherlands because the social services were very<br />
much better. Our prime objective now is to make people who<br />
have migrated Australia or people who from now on migrate to<br />
Australia happy in Australia. And while we are bringing<br />
fewer migrants to Australia the number of migrants who are<br />
staying is very much larger. The net gain is as great as it<br />
used to be and the number of people becoming naturalised as<br />
Australian citizens has almost doubled in the two years that we<br />
have been a government. We are now concerntrating on the<br />
migration of peoplewho have relatives in Australia or who have<br />
skills for which there is an un-fulfilled demand in Australia.<br />
Some figures I notice havebeen quoted in the Netherlands of the<br />
reduced numbers of migrants those figures are an extrapolation<br />
of a small period. They are greatly exaggerated.<br />
QUESTION: Can we expect the Australian dollar to align with one<br />
of the stronger European currencies in th e months ahead? </p>
<p>-7-<br />
WHITLAM: You don't find Heads of Governments commenting on<br />
matters of currency but our alignment is with a basket of<br />
currencies among which of course are some European ones.<br />
Roughly the basket is proportionate to the extent of our trade<br />
with the various countries concerned.<br />
QUESTION: ( Indistinct, but about discussions in Paris)<br />
WHITLAM: Well this obviously should wait until I have spoken<br />
with the French. Our general attitude has been up till now<br />
that it is proper for us to make arrangements for the disposal<br />
of uranium with those countries whic h accept the IAEA<br />
safeguards.<br />
QUESTION: In answer to my earlier question you clearly said<br />
that uranium technology had been discussed, And I asked you<br />
if in fact there had been a specific offer of technology<br />
Could you answer that?<br />
WHITLAM: There was an exchange of views on it. I mentioned<br />
earlier that the Netherlands is involved with two other countries<br />
the West Germans and the British in one particular form of<br />
enrichment. And as you know the Head of the Australian<br />
Department of Minerals and Energy has been visiting the site and<br />
holding discussions himself there.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Den Uyl, would the Netherlands have reservations<br />
about Japan being tied in with Australia as far as any uranium<br />
deal is concerned because of Japan's constitutional position<br />
whereby it is not allowed to withhold secrets from the public?<br />
DEN UYL: Well, it is one of the points which should be considered<br />
if consultations proceed and we would have to consider any<br />
agreement. But what is happening now is just as Mr. Whitlam<br />
already pointed out, that we are looking at possibilities.<br />
QUESTION: Can I ask a question about dominance in the Indian<br />
Ocean and the change of the strategic centre in the world from<br />
western Europe towards the Indian Coean. You want Diego Garcia </p>
<p>not to be included in the security system of the United States<br />
but by now, as the order becomes more contented, even Dr.<br />
Kissinger is talking about not taking the Arab oil fields.<br />
Does Australia feel that the whole strategic situation is<br />
changing and is tis cabinet adjusting its position?<br />
WHITLAM: There again, do you mind if I take the same attitude<br />
in you conmments on Dr. Kissinger as I took on your comments<br />
about Dr. Cass and Mr. Uren. This may be your technique, it<br />
is not mine, Now you asked me quite legitmately about the<br />
Indian Ocean and about Diego Garcia. It is not the wish of the<br />
Australian Government not of any government in the Indian<br />
Ocean that there should be a confrontation or escalation by the<br />
United States and the Soviet union in the Indian Ocean or<br />
anywhere. But of course, you ask about the Indian Ocean.<br />
We don't want the Indian Ocean, which has been ahppily free of<br />
this super power rivalry, to become the centre of it.<br />
QUESTION: But didnot you in the United States especially talk<br />
about having your own self-realisation and that it does not<br />
only mean not having a confrontation between the Great Powers<br />
byt having a say of your own.<br />
WHITLAM: I have in the United Nationsand my foreign minister<br />
has in the United Nations supported:' the various proposals to<br />
have a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean. That is the attitude<br />
that my Government takes and it is the attitude which all the<br />
countries around and in the Indian Ocean also take.<br />
QUESTION: Obviously a lot of your talks so far have contained<br />
a lot of discussion on the world economy. Could you tell us<br />
how you seee the short and long term future and how you think<br />
European countries are going to fare in the next twelve months?<br />
WHITLAM: The universal feeling in the countries I visited<br />
has been and the reports that they give me of the feeling in the<br />
other countries of western Europe is that of the two great evils<br />
which beset us all to an unexpected and unprecedented extent<br />
inflation and recession-the latter is the greater threat to our<br />
society and our economy. And they are of course doing what they </p>
<p>-9-<br />
can to reduce the inflation but they are more worried immediately<br />
about the recession.<br />
QUESTION: Are they pessimistic?<br />
WHITLAM: They are apprehensive but not pessimistic. Obviously<br />
one hopes that the efforts which we are all making will succeed.<br />
Speaking for myself, I think they will.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Whitlam, is it the view of the European leaders<br />
you have spoken to so far the President Ford has accepted bad<br />
advice and exaggerated the problem of recession? If so, do<br />
you agree with them or not?<br />
WHITLAM: The general feeling, if I may say so, has been that the<br />
advice that President Ford had been receiving had been contrary<br />
to the feeling which I have just stated as being that of the<br />
western Europeans. But I would not presume to say what adivce<br />
the President is now receiving or taking. There seems to be some<br />
feeling that the advice which he was given and was known to have<br />
been given earlier might not be accepted by him and the Congress.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Dne Uyl, have you made any specific arrangments<br />
on migration or has there been any proposal?<br />
DEN UYL: Mr. Whitlam pointed out Australian migration policies.<br />
For our part we have stressed the significance that Dutch<br />
emigration to Australia could be continued and we have underlined<br />
that there are some aspects of present Australian migration<br />
policies that stress in particular the entry conditions being<br />
relatives or having special qualifications. There might be some<br />
points which would be worthwhile to discuss further, as<br />
spontaneous emigration always has played a great part in the<br />
Netherlands. But our feeling is that by having consultations<br />
in this field there are real prospects for emigration being as it<br />
was in recent years.<br />
QUESTION: Can you be more specific on this point?<br />
DEN UYL: No. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Mr. Whitlam have you felt like a farmer who took a<br />
holiday and had his barn catch fire because of what has happened<br />
in Darwin and now Tasmania? What is yourfeeling about this<br />
and does it strike you as something to marvel at?<br />
WHITLAM: Well the thought had not occurred to me.<br />
QUESTION: The OECD I believe has decided to jointly remain<br />
open for trade and capital movement. But I believe Australia has<br />
not as yet signed this agreement. I s there any reason why<br />
they have not?<br />
WHITLAM: The general question of investment in being considered<br />
by us and some aspects of it such as double taxation agreements<br />
have been discussed in most of the countries we visited.<br />
QUESTION: Plr. Den Uyl, has any decision been made about uranium?<br />
DEN UYL: You know that in the project for producing the technique<br />
of enrichment for uranium by ultra centrifuge you need to have<br />
uranium to have the process realised commercially so at any time<br />
the three countries which are co-operating in the project will need<br />
uranium. QUESTION: ( indistinct)<br />
DEN UYL: I cannot make statements at this moment on the<br />
amount we need or about the time at which we will need uranium<br />
but the so-called troika, the three countries co-operating in the<br />
project will need uranium, that is quite sure.<br />
QUESTION: A domestic question. Have you been advised what<br />
caused the Hobart tragedy? What action are you prepared to<br />
take?<br />
WHITLAM: I sent a cable to Mr. Reece, the Premier of Tasmania, I<br />
suppose twelve hours ago and I got a, I received a message of<br />
thanks from him. Now you have the text I think. I expect there<br />
will be an inquiry into how such a ludicrous happening took place.<br />
It's beyond my imagination how any competent person could steer </p>
<p>-l4-<br />
a ship into the pylons of a bridge, and But I have to restrain myself<br />
because I would expect the person responsible for such an act would<br />
find himself before a criminal jury. There is no possibility<br />
of a Government guarding against mad or incompetent captains<br />
of ships or pilots or aircraft. </p>
