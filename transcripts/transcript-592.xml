SPEECH BY HIS M4AJESTY KING EJM1BOL OF THAILAND<br />
AT THE STATE BANQUET HELD AT PARTLIAMENT HOUSE,<br />
CANIBERRA ON 28TH AUGUST, 1 962.<br />
I am going to dispense myself of calling you<br />
Excellencies and so on ( hear, hear) ( applause) because<br />
it takes time,<br />
I just wish to thank you for this demonstration,<br />
just to tell you how much we are touched, And we are<br />
very grateful to the Government and people of Australia<br />
for the warm welcome.<br />
Thank you for the kind words, Mr. Menzies, and may<br />
I add that we have advanced our Visit because no Visit<br />
would be complete without meeting you here.<br />
And thankt you also, Mr, Whitlam, for your kind<br />
words. I will tell you something about Thailand, that<br />
" Thai" means freedom, but before that, I will have to<br />
tell you about a little conversation we had just now,<br />
Mr. Prime Minister and myself, as to how it comes that<br />
we had to put on this very stiff costume ( Laughter) and<br />
I think that many of you would agree with me that it is<br />
really uncomfortable,, ( Hear, hear) ( Applause).<br />
But I also had to mention something else first<br />
as a politeness but not only as a politeness, that we<br />
are very sensible to the kind attention of His Excellency<br />
the Administrator, Sir Dallas and Lady Brooks ( Hear, hear)<br />
( Applause). They have greeted us in a very kindly way<br />
and we are really grateful,<br />
It has been a long desire for us to visit this<br />
great country of Australia, We have heard so much about<br />
the beauty of the land its flora and fauna and above<br />
all, that this country has so many resources, natural<br />
resources, and with these natural resources, Australians<br />
have made much progress with hard work, and now Australia<br />
has become the greatest nation the greatest industrial<br />
nation, in South East Asia. ( Applause)<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, you have said just now that we<br />
have many things in common the Thai nation and the<br />
Australian nation and would add something else, that<br />
we have also the love, the ideal of freedom, of justice.<br />
The Thai people have kept their freedom and they are Thai,<br />
that means free,, They have kept -their freedom with hard<br />
work also and not only hard work, but blood. They have<br />
defended themselves and they have tried to build up their<br />
country all ifDugh the years centuries, as you have said,<br />
always fighting, keeping their freedom and that is why<br />
our people are proud to be Thai, ( Applause)<br />
We have a long history but perhaps you don't know<br />
that we have a long history of democracy also, Seven<br />
hundred years ago, a King in -the old. Capital of Sukhothi<br />
had an edict and had carved in stone about freedom of trade<br />
and also he had a gong beforea his palace where any of his<br />
subjects could come and sound it; he would be received<br />
by the King and would get justice if there was any grievance,<br />
( Applause) I call that democracy, ( hoar, hear) that anybody<br />
can have justice, arid this is se-ven hundred years ago and<br />
all through history, we have this sense of justice anA liberty. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Now about tha relations between our two countries.<br />
In the past, you called Thailand, or Siam, a country in<br />
the Far East but you saw that Far East that was from<br />
Europe, not from Australia, Now you have become Australians<br />
and our country is not the Far East, it is the Near North.<br />
( hear, hear) ( Applause). And for tqis reason I can say<br />
that we are much closer now, and the number of our students<br />
who come here is increasing. I hope that this movement<br />
will go on; that means that we will have more students<br />
coming here and I hope also that there will be more<br />
Australians coming to our country, so that we can understand<br />
each other better with knowledge and understanding and<br />
real knowledge, not the knowledge of hearsay ( hear, hear).<br />
( Applause) 0<br />
Apart from this kind of relatlon, we have also the<br />
relations with the organizations, that is the United Nations,<br />
the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, the<br />
South East Asia Treaty Organization and the Colombo Plan.<br />
I don't have to say that I would like to urge more and more<br />
co-operation in the support of these organizations*<br />
About the recent events in Laos) we were very pleased<br />
to see your reaction and you sent some of your forces into<br />
Thailand, We have visited them and I think it is a very<br />
good thing that they have come. It has demonstrated that<br />
both countries are ready to stand against any aggression<br />
and ready quickly. Back home we are very grateful for<br />
this quick action. ( Applause) Not because we get your<br />
help but because we see that Australians realise now that<br />
Thailand is in fact the front line defence of Australia,<br />
( Hear, hear) ( Applause).<br />
To come back to similarities we have. We have<br />
many more similarities not only in the field of freedom<br />
or sense of duty or all that has been mentioned, but in<br />
industry we have also the same trend of similarities,<br />
You have th wool9 we have silk but the animal or the<br />
beast that produces wool is much bigger than the insect<br />
that prcduces silk ( Laughter) but it is similar, In<br />
sports, Australians we know excel in tennis and we, our<br />
boys and girls, also excel in badminton. ( Applause)<br />
But here again, your tenni. s is much bigger than badminton<br />
and eveA in the faunza, we have in Thailand some birds,<br />
sparrows. You have sparrows, but they are much bigger.<br />
( Laughter) Donvt laugh, because we call the ostrich o: the<br />
emu the foreign sparrow. ( Laughter) I could go on with the<br />
kangaroo also that you are so proud of. We call it jingJo,<br />
but we call also the jingjo a little animal like this which<br />
is like a waterbug much smaller than your product.<br />
In Australia we can see now that you have everything<br />
in much bigger dimensions than the things we have in our<br />
country. Even the doctor is flying; he is a flying doctor.<br />
We have only the very humble mobile units. ( Laughter)<br />
But the principal thing is not size, We have something<br />
in common which is the most important, and that is a warm<br />
heart. ( Hear, hear) ( Applause)<br />
Mr, Prime Minister, you have been to Thailand many<br />
times, and each time it was a different time now the<br />
first time, it was in 1940? Yes, that is a long time ago.<br />
But he was the Prime Minister. and then each time he went to<br />
Thailand he was still the Prime Ministers, so I just want to<br />
congratulate h-im for this record in uremiership. ( Applause).<br />
o0o o oo./ 3 </p>
<p>.2<br />
I hea-r that you have been bothered by something<br />
on your visits, that is the mosquitoes, You dontt like them<br />
much, It is a shame because perhaps we could receive you<br />
mar. y more times and perhaps we should have the pleasure to<br />
meet you more often. That is why we have to come here to<br />
meet you. ( Laughter) In coming here , We bring the greetings<br />
of the Thai people, 27 million of them, to all your people<br />
in Australia their goodwill, their good wishes, and to<br />
commemorate this Visit, we bring as a token of our friendship,<br />
as a token of our goodwill, this model of the Royal Barge.<br />
( Applause). I dcnut know to whom I will give it because<br />
if I give it to the Prime Ministerg Mr. Whitlam will protest,<br />
so I just want to give this model of the Royal Barge to this<br />
building. ( Hear, hear) ( Applause) And I hope you will<br />
receive it on behalf of the building, ( Uaughter) But as<br />
the building has no hands, I will ask both Mr. Menzies and<br />
Mr, Whitlam to receive it so that perhaps you will have<br />
unanimity in this alsoo ( Laughter) ( Applause) If you don't,<br />
it would be a shame; it would fall down and break into so<br />
many pieces that you could not put it together,<br />
Now I want to wish everly success and prosperity<br />
to this Commonwealth of Australia. My best wishes to the<br />
Government, to the Parliament including the Opposition and<br />
thus to the whole nation and to all the people in this<br />
country, of this nation, of Australia,<br />
Thank you, ( Applause), </p>
