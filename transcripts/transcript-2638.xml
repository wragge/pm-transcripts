PRIME MINISTER<br />
OFFICIAL OPENING OF NABALCO PTY. LTD. ALUMINA PLANT<br />
GOVE, N. T. 1 JULY 1972<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. William McMahon<br />
CH, MP.<br />
Many of you have come from other parts of the world<br />
for this ceremony, and many more of you have flown in from<br />
" down South". I have come from Darwin and Kununurra, where I<br />
have had the pleasure of inaugurating several other northern<br />
development projects. I want to thank you, Mr Meyer, the Chairman of Swiss<br />
Aluminium Limited of Zurich, and the Australian partners, for<br />
inviting me to take part in this opening ceremony.<br />
I am sure I speak on behalf of all the guests when I<br />
say how impressed and enthused I am by what I have seen and<br />
heard. I understand that this impressive and massive alumina<br />
plant has been'korking up" for about a month now. And I am told,<br />
too, that we may have to wait a few weeks more before we see the<br />
first production alumina perhaps another five or six weeks.<br />
I wish I could stay that long but, as you will know, it would<br />
pose difficulties in a year like this.<br />
Mr Chairman, you and your partners in this<br />
European and Australian joint venture can take pride in the fact<br />
that this plant will be " on stream'" one month ahead of the<br />
company's own schedule, and five months ahead of the deadline<br />
agreed to with the Federal Government.<br />
It is now just over three and a half years since the<br />
joint venture agreement was signed, with the present level of<br />
per cent Australian participation. The partners then thought<br />
that exports of bauxite would commence in 1P71, that the first<br />
stage of an alumina plant of half a million tons per annum capacity<br />
would be complete by tih end of 1971, and that expanded production<br />
of a million tons a year of alumina would be achieved by the end<br />
of 1974. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
In 1969, these objectives had to be revised to take<br />
account of the delay flowing from financial reconstruction of the<br />
project. Taking this into account, it is all the more remarkable<br />
that in this remote and undeveloped part of Australia, where literally<br />
all the basic infrastructure had to be provided before construction<br />
could begin, you have completed this alumina plant ahead of target.<br />
There must be few projects of this size, cost and complexity anywhere<br />
in the world which have been completed in such a short period.<br />
This is a tribute not only to you, Mr Meyer, and to<br />
your executives, but to the many contractors and sub-contractors and<br />
to the multinational workforce who have met their deadlines, and shown<br />
again that Australian and international partnership can operate<br />
successfully to bring a major mineral project into operation.<br />
We have already seen this happen in the West, we are<br />
seeing it here again today in the North. I am sure that with<br />
experience as a guide and barring the unpredictable, as the project<br />
develops, it will beat the forecasts and the target dates for future<br />
development. Another illustration of this success story is that the<br />
plant will produce one million tons of alumina per annum by next July,<br />
sixteen months ahead of schedule. By then, the Gove Project will be<br />
generating an annual export income of $ 60 million, and that income<br />
could double in the foreseeable future, with expansion of the alumina<br />
capacity and possible eventual development into aluminium refining.<br />
There has been, as we all know, a downturn in the<br />
aluminium industry. That is true, but the speed at which this venture<br />
is going ahead shows the confidence of the industry in the fact that<br />
this is a temporary situation.<br />
This project has in fact an assured market for the<br />
whole of its alumina production for twenty years, and the Australian<br />
partners may choose to sell uo to 30 per cent of production themselves.<br />
For the basic raw material, bauxite, Gove alumina<br />
can arrange contracts for up to 40 million tons over 20 years. It<br />
has already contracted 33.5 million tons, including 19.5 million tons<br />
to Japan, and 14 million tons to Eurooe. This is private enterprise<br />
in action and deserves to be praised by all of us.<br />
To gain some idea of the significance of this project<br />
to the Territory, we should recall that the total value of mineral<br />
production here in the Northern Territory in 1962-63 only nine<br />
years ago was $ 7.5 million, and five years ago, it was only a<br />
little over $ 20 million. Gove is a project of great national significance. It<br />
makes its contribution in many ways to export income, to employment<br />
and, if you will forgive me as a former Treasurer, to our taxation<br />
income. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
It bears mentioning again that these achievements have<br />
been made possible by a co-orerative effort between Australian and<br />
overseas investment, investment that has been welcomed because it has<br />
played a dynamic role in Australia's general economic development<br />
throughout the postwar period. It has added to our domestic savings,<br />
even though they have been high by world standards. These investments<br />
have also brought here technological resources and managerial know-how<br />
which might not otherwise have been available to us.<br />
Recently, in Canberra, we have completed a far-reaching<br />
review of overseas investment policies. As a result, we will soon<br />
be presenting five papers to the Cabinet dealing with<br />
whether there should be some regulation or control of<br />
capital inflow;<br />
whether we need better guidelines for borrowing;<br />
the question of interest rates;<br />
whether Australian companies should have greater flexibility<br />
to invest overseas; and<br />
whether there should be more flexibility in overseas.<br />
corporations borrowing here from us.<br />
These papers will be considered with the objective of ensuring that<br />
the decisions made are unmistakably in the best interests of Australia<br />
and Australians. It is obviously in the national interest to ensure thait<br />
there is major participation by Australian companies in ventures of<br />
this kind. I am glad that the Australian equity of 30 per cent<br />
may be increased to 50 per cent depending on future programmes.<br />
Australian companies may not have the majority financial<br />
holding in this venture, but I understand there has been a true takeover<br />
on the staff side, and that Australians now occupy some 60 per cent<br />
of senior managerial Positions. As well, it is the company's policy<br />
that Swiss managers will be progressively replaced by Australians.<br />
Mr Meyer, it is more than satisfying to me, as Prime<br />
Minister of Australia, to oen this plant with the knowledge that it<br />
will process Australian natural resources in accordance with the<br />
policy of the Federal Governmrent, and it will make an important<br />
contribution, not only to decentralisation and northern development,<br />
but to the prosperity of this wonderful and developing country of ours.<br />
Mr Meyer, to you and your Australian colleagues and to<br />
all the people present here too, I can say that it is with the<br />
greatest pleasure that I officially open this plant and look forward<br />
to seeing it get really into production. 1 </p>
