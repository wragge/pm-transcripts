J WL IIAVL AI'PRUVLJD rIL FIRST DIRECT GRANTS EVER MADE BY<br />
AN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNCILS,<br />
FOR THE FIRST TIME AN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS READY TO<br />
IIELP LOCAL COUNCILS DELVELOP THEIR SERVICES AND AMENITIES<br />
FOR THE PEOPLE. MARYBOROUGH CITYCUNIL IS RECEIVING<br />
$ 130,000 ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE GRANTS COMMIIDN.,<br />
LOCAL COUNCILS THROUGHOUT QUEENSLAND ARE RECEIVING<br />
MILLION. THESE GRANTS ARE GIVEN WITHOUT INTEREST;<br />
THEY NEED NOT BE REPAID. THERE ARE NOi STRINGS ATTACHED,<br />
THEY CAN BE SPENT BY THE LOCAL COUNCILS AS THEY SEE. FIT.<br />
THEY ARE MADE ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF AN EXPERT INDEPENDENT<br />
BODY. THEY INVOLVE NO POLITICAL PATRONAGE OR FAVOURITISM,<br />
THE DJELKE-PETERSEN GOVERNMENT HAS LAWAYS RESISTED<br />
ATTEMPTS TO INVOLVE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IN THE WELFARE<br />
OF LOCAL COUNCILS AND REGIONS. IF THEIR EFFORTS HAD BEEN<br />
SUCCESSFUL MARYBOROUGH TODAY WOULD BE $ 130,000 WORSE OFF<br />
AND COUNCIL RATESWULD BE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO RISE<br />
FURTHER.<br />
2. UNDER LABOR'S PROPOSALS A HIGH-GRADE ALL-WEATHER HIGHWAY<br />
WILL LINK MARYBOROUGH WITH BRISBANE AND EVENTUALLY WITH<br />
SYDNEY AND MELBOURNE. DESPITE OPPOSITION OBSTRUCTION<br />
WE HAVE PASSED THE NECESSARY LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE<br />
$ i1,126 MILLION FOR OUR NATIONAL ROADS PROGRAM OVER THE NEXT<br />
THREE YEARS, a / 2 </p>
<p>WI-. ARE THE F-IRST NATIONAL GOVERNMENT 10 UNDERTAKE THIS<br />

1; iiU Jl! CI. i I 0 I1 AI. ONI NO I'LIVlOUS Fl.) ERAL GOVERNMINT<br />
CARLD ENOUGH TO DO IT EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD THE<br />
NECESSARY CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS.<br />
WE WANT TO SEE-MARYBOROUGH-PROPERLY SERVED BY SHIPS OF<br />
IlE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL LINE. MR. BJELKE-PETERSEN, ALONE<br />
AMONG THE PREMIERS HAS PREVENTED A. NL. SHIPS OPERATING<br />
BETWEEN PORTS WITHIN HIS OWN STATE. QUEENSLAND CITIES<br />
HAVE BEEN DENIED AN ESSENTIAL SHIPPING SERVICE SOLELY<br />
BECAUSE OF THE OBSTINACY AND PREJUDICE OF THE OUTGOING<br />
PREMIER. MR. BJELKE-PETERSEN'S ATTITUDE IS NOT SHARED<br />
BY THE AUTHORITIES IN OTHER COASTAL PORTS. MR. BORZI,<br />
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CAIRNS HARBOUR BOARD, AND A FORMER<br />
STATE CANDIDATE OF THE NATIONAL PARTY, SAID IN HIS<br />
1973-74 ANNUAL REPORT:<br />
" THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL LINE'S WEEKLY CARGO<br />
SERVICES TO AND FROM THE SOUTH BROUGHT INCREASED<br />
TRADE AND REVENUE. UNFORTUNATELY THE BOARD'S<br />
SUPPORT OF MOVES TO HAVE A. N. L. GRANTED THE<br />
PRIVILEGE OF CONDUCTING AN INTRA-STATE CARGO<br />
SERVICE HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL TO DATE." </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Ll, THE BJELKE-PETERSEN GOVERNMENT HAS REFUSED TO<br />
CO-OPERATE IN OUR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN THE WALKERS LTD.<br />
SHIPYARD IN MARYBOROUGH, WHEN WALKERS ANNOUNCED THEIR<br />
DECISION TO CEASE SHIPBUILDING WE IMMEDIATELY SOUGHT<br />
WAYS OF KEEPING THE INDUSTRY GOING. ON 24 APRIL I<br />
INVITED WALKERS LTD. AND THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT TO<br />
JOIN WITH US ON A 50-50 BASIS TO ESTABLISH A NEW SHIPBUILDING<br />
AND ENGINEERING WORKS AT MARYBOROUGH AND<br />
REHABILITATE WALKER'S EXISTING FACILITIES WHILE THE NEW<br />
YARD WAS BEING BUILT. MY COLLEAGUE, CHARLIE JONES, THE<br />
MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT, VISITED MARYBOROUGH TO SEEK WAYS<br />
OF KEEPING THE YARD OPEN. HE OFFERED TO GO IT ALONE<br />
IF THE OTHER PARTIES REFUSED TO CO-OPERATE. WALKERS<br />
REFUSED THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S OFFER TO LEASE THE<br />
YARD AS A GOING CONCERN. THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT<br />
REJECTED OUR OFFER TO TAKE A HALF SHARE IN REHABILITATING<br />
THE YARD AND DEVELOPING A NEW SHIPBUILDING AND ENGINEERING<br />
WORKS. THE WORKFORCE HAS NOW DISPERSED AND MUCH OF THE<br />
EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN SOLD. MARYBOROUGH HAS : BEEN DEPRIVED<br />
OF THIS THRIVING AND IMPORTANT INDUSTRY LARGELY BECAUSE OF<br />
THE ATTITUDE OF THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT. ,/ 4 </p>
<p>LIINDUSTRIAL<br />
ACTIVITY IN MARYBOROUGH IS AT A LOW EBB<br />
BECAUSE THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO ATTRACT<br />

WHICH WOULD STIMULATE EMPLOYMENT AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE.<br />
lMUNCY I-ROVIDI) ED BY THE / AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS SPENT<br />
MORE SLOWLY AND SPARINGLY BY QUEENSLAND THAN BY ANY OTHER<br />
STATE. So FAR THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT HAS SPENT ONLY<br />
18% OF THE MONEY AVAILABLE IN CAPITAL GRANTS FOR EDUCATION<br />
IN 1974 AND 1975. IT IS BUILDING FEWER HOUSING COMMISSION<br />
HOMES THAN ANY OTHER STATE DESPITE OUR OFFER OF A VIRTUAL<br />
BLANK CHEQUE FOR WELFARE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION, ONLY Ai<br />
STATE LABOR GOVERNMENT LED BY PERC TUCKER AND WORKING IN<br />
CO-OPERATION WITH THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT CAN DEVELOP<br />
