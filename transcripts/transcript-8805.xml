SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE RON P. 3 KEATING MP,<br />
LAUNCH OF THE NATIONAL MEDICARE HOSPITAL ENTITLEMENTS<br />
PUBLIC INFORMATION CAMPAIGN, SYDNEY, 1 FEBRUARY 1993<br />
PLEASE CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
Let me begin with a brief, real life story.<br />
A little girl called Emily was born with a heart<br />
condition. She had her first serious operation when she was only<br />
five weeks old. She recently had a second.<br />
She's had the best of care. A top cardiologist, surgeon,<br />
and the best of nursing, medication twice a day.<br />
Emily's parents were frightened not only about Emily's<br />
welfare but about how much her treatment would cost.<br />
They feared they would have to sell their home.<br />
Had they lived in the United States. possibly they would<br />
have. Emily's parents knew that in the United States families<br />
are frequently crippled by medical expenses.<br />
So, what did all of Emily's treatment cost? Apart from<br />
the heartache nothing. Medicare paid for everything.<br />
Emily's parents now know that Medicare has given Emily a<br />
life she might not have had.<br />
They say Medicare is a life saver.<br />
Every Australian can take comfort and pride in this.<br />
There is no better system of health care in the world.<br />
it is fair as health care should be-. Like illness and<br />
accident it does not discriminate between rich and poor.<br />
it shares the risk among us all. And it delivers health<br />
care of the highest quality. </p>

Australia has one of the best public hospital systems in<br />
the world. And you won't find more dedicated GPs an~ d<br />
community health workers anywhere.<br />
Medicare is simple and fair. Every Australian has their<br />
own health Insurance pre-paid under Medicare it's the<br />
care you're entitled to.<br />
Under Medicare, every Australian is entitled to access to<br />
hospital and GP services, and necessary medicines.<br />
Under Medicare, Australians make 88 million visits to the<br />
GP every year. Seventy per cent are bulk billed.<br />
There are nearly three million admissions to public<br />
hospitals. And over 160 million prescriptions are delivered by our<br />
community pharmacists.<br />
Medicare delivers high quality health care public<br />
and private.<br />
Public hospitals like Monash Medical Centre in Melbourne,<br />
Westrnead in Sydney, R~ oyal Perth, Royal Adelaide -so<br />
many. Under Medicare, some of our greatest hospitals -St<br />
Vincent's here in Sydney, the Mater and Wesley in<br />
Brisbane, the Mercy and Epworth in Melbourne, are private<br />
not-for-profit hospitals.<br />
They are run by people concerned about the quality of<br />
health care.<br />
Labor will continue to support our greath'o * spit as<br />
public and private. But we reject the American approach<br />
of handing over our health care to profiteers.<br />
That's because Medicare is an acknowledgement that basic<br />
health care is something every Australian is entitled to.<br />
Today we are here to celebrate Medicare's ninth birthday.<br />
It is the achievement of one of Labor's most cherished<br />
goals fair and quality health care for all.<br />
Because of Medicare, Australia has stability and security<br />
in health care.<br />
These nine year old Australians helping us celebrate<br />
today have never known the uncertainty that Dr Hewson is<br />
threatening.<br />
Most of you have probably forgotten, and these nine year<br />
olds have never known, that before Medicare, one of the<br />
most common reasons for being jailed for non-payment of<br />
debts was unpaid health bills. </p>
<p>L' W*-Js<br />
3<br />
Under Liberal governments in 1971 and 1981, two million<br />
Australians had no health insurance at all because they<br />
could not afford i t<br />
In the United States, 37 million Americans have no health<br />
insurance and cannot gain access to health services.<br />
Dr Hewson wants to take Australia back to the days of a<br />
vwo classg-health system private care for those who can<br />
pay and public care for the rest.<br />
It is ironic that Dr Hewson is proposing a us-style<br />
health system at a time when the US is looking to<br />
Australia and Medicare as a way of ending the US health<br />
nightmare. Dr Hewson's health policy contains the same elements that<br />
are wreaking haVoc -in the US. He would replace public<br />
facilities with private services, have health charges<br />
dictated by doctors, and introduce tax rebates for health<br />
insurance. It is no wonder the AMA is campaigning for Dr Hewson.<br />
The AMA is looking forward to a billion dollar pay rise<br />
for about 40,000 doctors courtesy of the Liberal's<br />
health policy.<br />
All of this would drive up the cost of health care for<br />
each Australian and for the country as a whole.<br />
The US spends twice as much per person on health care as<br />
we do in Australia for less care.<br />
Even cheap health insurance policies cost more than<br />
$ 5,000.<br />
Dr Hewson believes that health care should be subjected<br />
to market forces, as if ill-health and accident obeyed<br />
the same economic laws as the price of fish or tomatoes.<br />
But there is clear evidence both here and overseas that<br />
the market does not work for health care.<br />
Health is not like other goods. we never know what<br />
illness is going to cost or when an emergency or illness<br />
will strike.<br />
We need to band together to share the risk. That is what<br />
Medicare enables us to do.<br />
Dr H-ewson will make you take out private health insurance<br />
-if the private insurer willacetou </p>
<p>LL 4<br />
One little noticed area of concern in the Fightback<br />
health policy is that private insurance does not always<br />
cover people for pre-existing serious conditions Such<br />
a9 Multiple Sclerosis or cancer.<br />
under Dr Hewson such people would be penalised through<br />
much higher medical charges, through tax penalties, and<br />
through refusal of insurance coverage.<br />
Fightback could seriously penalise the chronically sick.<br />
it is a case of your money or your health.<br />
Dr Hewson will cut $ 1.4 billion out of public hospitals.<br />
This will force the States to close more than 10,000<br />
public beds. 450,000 fewer people will be treated.<br />
Dr Hewson will take that $ 1.4 billion from public<br />
hospitals and hand it to doctors and private prof itmaking<br />
companies.<br />
He will place profit before the interests of patients.<br />
Under Dr Hewson, Australian families will pay $ 20 a week<br />
more for health care.<br />
The main reason some people are confused about the costs<br />
of hospital care is because private insurance funds, the<br />
AMA and private profit hospitals have generated<br />
uncertainty and fear.<br />
They want people to be fearful they have a vested<br />
interest. They attack the Government for rewarding States which<br />
improve access to hospital services for public patients.<br />
The Government has a duty to look after the well-being of<br />
the entire community; to maintain quality services for<br />
everyone. These vested interests are looking after their profits.<br />
Australians have every reason to feel proud and confident<br />
about Medicare.<br />
Dr Hewson does not believe in Medicare.<br />
He is going to make sure you can't afford to go to your<br />
GP. He is going to price sick people out of the market.<br />
That is his policy.<br />
He will abolish bulk billing for all but cardholders. He<br />
will make you p~ y-your bill upfront. i r t u V 1. . L IIU </p>
<p>Dr Hewson wants to rip the heart out of our quality<br />
health care system.<br />
Labor fought to introduce Medicare and we must protect<br />
it.<br />
Through Medicare, we are committed to building on the<br />
strengths of our health system.<br />
Labor recognises that the health need$ of Australians are<br />
changing. Our population is ageing.<br />
Hospital admissions will increase and there will be<br />
greater use of high technology procedures.<br />
We want to ensure that our hospitals are equipped to cope<br />
with these changes.<br />
That's why Labor Is spending an additional $ 1.6 billion<br />
to strengthen Medicare and its guarantee to every<br />
Australian of fair access to hospital services.<br />
Dr Hewson will sacrifice the certainty and security of<br />
Medicare for the cost and uncertainty of a privately-run<br />
sys tern.<br />
He will dismantle Medicare. He will make every<br />
Australian pay more for their health care.<br />
As Emily's parents now know, Medicare provides quality<br />
care and pays all your costs.<br />
I want the people of Australian to know what they are<br />
entitled to under Medicare. AS long as it exists no one<br />
should be fearful.<br />
Thank you. </p>
