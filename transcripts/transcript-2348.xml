SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER AT THEB<br />
AUSTRKE 9NEGRWN99-T<br />
IN SINGAPORE 18 JANUARY 1971<br />
Members of the Australian Alumni:<br />
I found the introductory speech absolutely full of interest. I listened<br />
with great attention to the suggestion that there should be much more Australian<br />
investment in Singapore.<br />
But you know there is Australian investment here. I think I have heard<br />
of the Hume Pipe Company. Perhaps, Sir, your remarks which I have taken note<br />
of might also be directed to a number of investors in Singapore, because there<br />
is great investment in Australia from people in Singapore. They are constantly<br />
building buildings, buying land and indeed, I met a gentleman the other night who<br />
had such foresight that he had invested not in Australia but he did own 90 per<br />
cent of the brewery in New Guinea. This indicates that there is a flow of<br />
investment and investible funds generated from Singapore, which could well<br />
perhaps be used here if the requirement for investment is so great.<br />
But I don't know that the requirement is so very great. I come here from<br />
time to time, and every time one comes, one sees immense changes in the skyline,<br />
and onle sees a city really growing and growing apace.<br />
I don't know whether there is unemployment but I gather there is very<br />
little unemployment, particularly as far as the young is concerned. I gather there<br />
is a shortage, indeed, of skilled labour and unskilled labour.<br />
I had thought of Singapore as one of the success stories not onl y of this<br />
part of the world but one of the success stories of modern times, comparable in<br />
many ways with Venice of old a city state, a state dependig largely on commerce,<br />
on export and on import, situated where the trade routes of the world cross. But<br />
with this great distinction, that it has no danger of sinking beneath the waver.. but<br />
rather is demonstrably day by day reaching for the skies.<br />
And this is the feeling one has of Singapore.<br />
It is possible I put it no higher than that it is possible that Australia<br />
itself may have contributed a small amount to the capacity which had led to this<br />
success story. I think that you members of the Alumni are living illustrations of<br />
what I hope will be an enduring link between our countries though we may from<br />
time to time criticise each other, as the previous speaker criticised me and as<br />
I propose to criticise him later on but also I hope and believe that it is an<br />
illustration of one very successful means of international co-operation. / 2 </p>
<p>In the last twenty years, Australia has welcomed more than 10, 000 fellows<br />
and scholars from Asian and African countries under the Colombo Plan and such<br />
Government aid schemes alone not counting private students. Six hundred and<br />
forty-two of these scholars have come from Singapore. Australia provided the<br />
facilities for training of all kinds. But Singapore students took advantage of those<br />
facilities with diligence, with success, so that in 1969, 96 per cent of Singapore<br />
Colombo Plan students doing undergraduate courses in all years passed their<br />
examination 96 per cent.<br />
N1ow anybody who has a knowledge of the normal pass rate of Australians<br />
and others in Australian universities would realise what an unusually excellent<br />
result this is. We tend to have a 40 per cent failure rate i the first year, of<br />
Australian students, and yet 96 per cent of the people from Singapore Colombo<br />
Plan people passed their courses.<br />
I think that this is a compliment to the calibre of the students that have<br />
been selected by their Government to come to Australia, and I think that it is a<br />
compliment to the students themselves that they have taken: full advantage of the<br />
opportunities so provided. And it is clear proof that the cost of the Colombo Plan<br />
courses, which now totals some $ 40 million, is being fully productive which all aid<br />
schemes are not and is fulfilling the purpose for which it was designed, which all<br />
aid schemes do not do.<br />
As an illustration perhaps of this, I am informed that that magnificent<br />
c-onference hall in which the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference is now<br />
being held was in fact designed by an architect who took his first degree in<br />
Architecture in Melbourne, in Australia. He then went somewhere else, I gather,<br />
to do a postgraduate course, but clearly because of his undergraduate course, was<br />
able to design a building of such excellence.<br />
Apart from the Colombo Plan itself Government-sponsored students, those<br />
of whom I have spoken so far there were some 10, 000 privately-f inanced students<br />
from Asia, Africa and the Pacific in our schools and universities and colleges last year.<br />
I haven't got the figures on the pass rates of the privately-financed students but I do<br />
kno v that they are not as good as the figures of the Government-sponsored Colombo<br />
Plan students. Nevertheless they do come back and they do practice as accountants,<br />
lawy ers, doctors, and engineers with a technical knowledge which must be and<br />
obviously is of advantage.<br />
This kind of operation seems to me to be one which stands high in any<br />
attempt at international co-operation to raise the economic and living standards of the<br />
countries of the world. For the aim of econorrc assistance, and this I believe it<br />
is important to understand, the aim of economic assistance should never be to<br />
provide a hand-out. It should be to provide resources, it should not be to provide<br />
resources for consumer spending or for dissipation. Because if that were to be the<br />
concept of international aid, then it would merely result in a requirement for a<br />
continuing dole, and that would be as repugnant to the receiver as it would be to the<br />
donor. And it would do nothing whatever to tackle the real problems of underdeveloped<br />
countries. </p>
<p>The realI aim, surely, ought to be to provide capacity in the form of<br />
technical expertise, professional expertise and capital, so that industries can be<br />
developed, or when insufficient is produced in any country for its internal<br />
consumption agricultural production can be increased. In fact, the aim should be<br />
to provide developing countries with the means to produce and to try to see they<br />
have the opportunity of selling any such increased production.<br />
VWhat better way can there be to provide the means to produce than to see<br />
that the elite of a country, as I believe you intellectually are, have the greatest<br />
possible training in all those fields which, if applied to the growth of a nation, can<br />
accelerate that growth and see that it goes in the proper direction. If,' when this<br />
has been done, when this kinad of assistance has been provided, the resulting<br />
improvement and there-always is a resulting improvement the resulting<br />
improvement is swallowed up by an unrestricted increase in population, then I am<br />
sorry, but that is a problem for the country aided to solve.<br />
It is not an argument for more and more aid from donor countries. And<br />
there is no place in which this is more realised than in this State of Singapore where,<br />
I do not have to tell you, measures have been taken to ensure that increased<br />
production, that increased prosperity is not dissipated . by . an unlimited increase<br />
In population. So when we say that t he gap between the richer and the poorer countries<br />
shou' I be reduced and this is something I have heard a considerable amount about<br />
in the last couple of days I believe that that means that the richer countries should<br />
provide the poorer with the means and the opportunity of closing that gap, and it<br />
is then up to the less developed countries to use those opportunities to close that gap<br />
by their own efforts.<br />
And cau you find a better example of that being don-, e thatrds evident in<br />
this State of Singapore? As your own Prime Minister so cogently said :" The<br />
richer countries cannot be expected to adopt the role of beinig forever their<br />
brother's keeper". And some of those in the less developed countriec. will have to cease to<br />
adopt the role of expecting as a right that somebody will keep them no matter<br />
what they do. But though we may not and should not be our brother's keeper, we<br />
must be, and we try to be our brother's helper and then it depends on the brother<br />
who is helped what the end result will be.<br />
So in providing the advice and the technical education which we in Australia<br />
are now able to do, and in seeing the graduates of these courses contributing so<br />
greatly to their countries' own advance as we see it here, we have in action a proper<br />
plan of assistance properly used by its recipients and resulting in that economic<br />
advance and that self-reliance which must be the real, ultimate aim of all plans<br />
of assistance. And I believe, quite genuinely,, that I can congratulate Singapore because I<br />
think the principles which I have enunciated have been understood and applied and that<br />
such assistance as has been given has been used to the full and that the results of<br />
that use can be seen all around us. So I congratulate you. / 4 </p>
<p>But the benefits of this kind of international co-operation don't stop there.<br />
Thlere is the advantage to students, and let us again take Singapore, of being educated<br />
not only in one country, not only in Australia. Some go there, some go to Canada,<br />
some go to the United States, and some stay in Singapore. And this leads to the<br />
opportunity for a cross-fertiisation of knowledge for people studying particular<br />
practices with slightly different systems in different countries, and then coming<br />
back and being able to marry the best of what they have got from each of the countries<br />
in Which studies have taken place.<br />
Over and above that, there is, think, the enduring advantage that people<br />
who live in any country for a number of years come to know that country in which they<br />
live. If they don't know a ccuntry from personal experience, they may read about it<br />
and they may get a completely false picture. But if they have lived there, they know<br />
it. Some don't like it. Most of them do. And knowledge of a country is the beginning<br />
of understanding, and understanding between countries will be a most significant<br />
"~ spin-off from the educational facilities provided.<br />
Later, in the years ahead, one may hope for a cross -fertilisation of students<br />
Australians coming to Singapore, Singaporeans coming to Australia, and so on.<br />
This is perhaps, at this stage, a dream. And yet we are at the moment in the middle<br />
of a Commonwealth Prime. Ministers' Conference where Heads of Governmenzt are<br />
meeting to try to see if they can overcome the exigencies and exacerbations of the<br />
present and keep together in order to have a chance of making ideals and dreams come<br />
true. I believe that it will be useful if this Heads of Government Meeting says<br />
what the Commonwealth is. And I hope they will say it properly and that means<br />
they will say what I believe. I believe that the Commonwealth is an association<br />
of free, independent nations with some common tradition,. meeting without decisions<br />
being taken by vote there are no majority opinions binding on any member of the<br />
Commonwealth, there is no consensus which has any binding effect whatever on an~ y<br />
member of the Commonwealth who does not agree with the majority who have a<br />
consensus. Rather it is an association through which people can exchange their ideas<br />
of what should be done, and in what fields it should be done. And there has developed<br />
during the course of this Conference clear indications of what all members of the<br />
Commonwealth feel are the fields in which action should be taken.<br />
Looking forward through this decade and into the -future, what are the<br />
problems likely to face not only the Commonwealth but nations generally? It appears,<br />
and I agree with this, that most believe that one of those problems is the maintenance<br />
of peace in the world. Some think peace is threatened by a disparity of wealth in<br />
countries. I beg leave to differ. I do not think Cambodia was invaded because she<br />
was poorer than the invaders. </p>
<p>I do not think that the wars we have seen since the second great war resulted<br />
from a disparity of income. I do not think that the Five Power Pact which we Britain,<br />
Singapore, Malaysia, New Zealand are to enter into is designed to try and protect<br />
this'region from an attack by people who are poorer.<br />
Rather do I feel it is an ideological urge for conquest, then that ideological<br />
urge will be able to be met, and more importantly, more hopefully, that those who<br />
may have such an ideological urge or nationalistic urge will see that the game is not<br />
worth the candle. At any rate the maintenance of peace is one of the items which the<br />
Commonwealth Association sees as significant for the future.<br />
Anoth, 7r is the freeing of trade. I-don't . want to go into this in any great<br />
depth because &amp; early every country is thoroughly in favour a! freeing trade and reducing<br />
tariffs except for the commodities which they manufacture. But they can see the<br />
unarguable principles in favour of doing it for the commodity other people manufacture.<br />
But there still is a need to see what can be done so that new countries who<br />
are pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, who are using the technical knowledge<br />
they get to produce more, will have an opport unity at least of selling their produce.<br />
And this is another matter which all those sitting around the conference table in<br />
Singapore believe it will be difficult to solve Mks, as I thinktc it would be difficult<br />
to solve it. But does that matter so much if the problem is first isolated and then,<br />
difficult or not, attempts are made to seek to overcome it.<br />
There is next the question which I have touched before, the provision of<br />
aid between country and country. I don't think I need to add anything to what I have<br />
said as to how I and my country approach this problem. But it is not one-sided. And<br />
as an illustration of this, may I give you a brief anecdote of what happened this<br />
morning during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference. ( I shouldn't<br />
do this, I know. I am breaking secrecy but there is nothing much in it, as you will<br />
see when I have finished.)<br />
But it was suggested by a great friend of mine from a Caribbean country<br />
that sometimes donor countries came to these conferences with a rather patronishing<br />
kind of approach you know, " What can we do for you sort of thing, one that I<br />
thoroughly understand. But it just so happened that Australia is a sugar-producin-g<br />
country, as the Caribbeans are sugar-producing countries, and England is going<br />
into the European Economic Community and is going to seek, I think, to look after<br />
the interests of Caribbean sugar-producing countries, but not necessarily Australia<br />
as a sugar-producing country.<br />
But the Caribbeans are inclined to help us. So I was able to point out to my<br />
friend that we didn't go there with a patronising air at all. What we went there for<br />
really was to ask him and his Caribbean brother to help this brother within the<br />
Commonwealth, and was able to paraphrase those remarks of the late President<br />
John Kennedy that we do not come here to ask what we can do for Barbados, but<br />
rather to ask what Barbados can do for us. / 6 </p>
<p>.6.<br />
And this is an illustration of the tW07way traffic which can take place in<br />
this field of trade.<br />
Another matter which wil occupy the Conference for long is under the<br />
heading of racism, which I think you described, Sir, as the White Australia Policy.<br />
Heads of State are prepared to say, as I am, that racism is an unmitigated evil, and<br />
it is. I am prepared to say and mean that we will abolish racism within Australia.<br />
I don't think that those of you who have been there will have noticed<br />
any racism unless you were extraordinarily unfortunate while you were livig<br />
in my country. There is legal discrimination still in some Australian States<br />
against Aboriginals, but my Government has told those States that those laws will<br />
be repealed by those States within two years, or if they are not, we will move in<br />
and repeal them. So there will be no Governmental discrimination inside Australia.<br />
I am prepared to say that and to mean it.<br />
I think there are other countries where racial discrimination may be<br />
more pronounced than it is in my own. I know people always tend to talk on this<br />
subject as if it were just a matter of Negro versus European that was involved<br />
in the word " racism", but I think all of you will know that it is not. I think that<br />
all of you will know that there are grave strains in a com munity when there are<br />
two races or more each forming significant proportions of the population.<br />
You are a lucky State. You are able, quite properly, to call yourself<br />
a n-. ilti-racial society, and get the good feeling that comes from being able to<br />
say that. And if one replies and says yes, but you are 90 per cent Chinese or<br />
per cent Chinese and therefore Singapore is homogenouc" as we will keep<br />
Australia homogenous, that nevertheless still enables you to say you are a<br />
multi-racial society.<br />
Well, we are moving a little bit that way. There were 6, 000 non-<br />
European people who became Australian citizens last year we probably have a<br />
little higher percentage of homogeneity than Singapore but there is a good deal of<br />
similarity, I do assure you.<br />
As far as the application of an immigration policy is concerned, I have<br />
no hesitation in saying what I am now going to say, and I propose to make no<br />
apology for saying it.<br />
Looking around the world, I see social problems between Negro and<br />
European in England, I see grave danger to normal living in the split between<br />
the races in the United States. I read not long ago, of some riots between races<br />
not far away from where I am standing now, riots which could easily have spread<br />
to Singapore. I am not going to allow that kind of danger to occur in Australia. There<br />
are racial tensions, and whether there ought to be or not doesn't matter. We live<br />
in a world of reality. We don't live in a world which would be different if we could<br />
shatter it to bits and then remould it nearer to our heart's desire. And in reality,<br />
there is thought there ought not to be tension between races when there are / 7 </p>
<p>large numbers of different races living in one country, and terisions between peoples from<br />
different regions. Sir, in reply to what you said, I can only say this. As far as I am concer.-ed,<br />
any Governmental discrimination of any kind on grounds of race will not exist in<br />
Australia. It will be abolished. I cannot say that feeling won't exist because that is<br />
not under the control of Governments. It will take time aid education for the vast bulk<br />
of a population to have no difference feeling whatever when they are talking to a Negro<br />
or somebody with a different colour skin. It will take time.<br />
At the moment, there are brighter people from any race you care to mention,<br />
and less intelligent people from any race you care to mention. The bright ones have no<br />
trouble, have no difficulty. They are on the same wavelength. They get together, but<br />
it will take some time before we attain the ideal which I think I share with you in common,<br />
where even those who are not so bright will not feel -prejudice towards people who<br />
are different. I think that the coursa which we are following holds great chances of achieving<br />
real racial tolerance. I think it holds better chances than, if we were to risk the ' Kid<br />
of racial conflict that other countries have. I think that if wie build up gradually i-nside<br />
Australia a proportion of people who are not of white skin, then, as that is gradually<br />
done, so there will be a complete lack of consciousness that it is being built up, and<br />
a complete lack of consciousness of difference between the raceg. And if this can be done,<br />
as I think it can, then that may provide the world with the first truly multi-racial<br />
society ;. ith no tensions of any kind possible between any of the races within it. At<br />
any rate this is our ideal.<br />
And if we are misguided in the way in which we, anre seeking to attain it, then<br />
all I can say, Sir, is that we have got the responsibility to try and do it. We have got<br />
the responsibility to try and explain it, and for my own part, I don't propose to<br />
apologise for it.<br />
Now I think I should finish where I began by sayig once again what an honour<br />
it is for me to be here with you who have, I hope, happy memories of my Own country,<br />
who have a true knowledge of my own country, who may assess it differently from me,<br />
but who I hope would have a friendship for Australia, as I have got a friendship for<br />
Singapore. When I first came here there was no wall that was not pock-marked with<br />
, shrapnel. When I first came here, my friend the Australian High Commissioner to the<br />
United Kingdom had close aquaintance with Changi when it was quite a different building<br />
from that which it is now. From that time I have been here occasionally not often<br />
enough met many people from here and steadily grown to admire and like this State.<br />
It prcyides stability. It provide~ s a success story.<br />
And for all those reasons I thank you greatly for this opportunity to talkto<br />
V, 6u tonight. </p>
