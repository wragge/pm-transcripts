THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
RADIO INTERVIEW WITH PRU GOWARD, RADIO NATIONAL<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Well Prime Minister thank you for joining us this morning. You've certainly had your<br />
successes with policy, sometimes I think even to your own surprise, but is Rupert<br />
Murdoch right that we are in danger of becoming a backwater if there's not faster<br />
reform? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No I think the remarks Rupert made indicate just how disconnected he's becoming<br />
with Australia. Anybody who's been in Australia over the past few months,<br />
particularly the past couple of months and has really followed things closely could<br />
barely say that we haven't achieved some quite fundamental reforms. The industrial<br />
relations legislation which won't come into operation until the first of January..<br />
GO WARD:<br />
But a lot of business people say it's quite a serious compromise.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well they should wait and see it operate. If it had compromised fundamentals we<br />
wouldn't have accepted the compromise.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
All right. What about tax reform though, Prime Minister? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we made a commitment that there would be no GST during the first term and I<br />
repeat that commitment. I have no intention of dishonouring it but we made a change<br />
to the capital gains tax so far as it affects small business which has enormous<br />
consequences. Any small business operator with a business valued less than $ 5 million<br />
can sell that business and move into another business of like value, it doesn't have to<br />
be the same kind of business, and could in fact do that three or four times during his<br />
working lifetime and it was correctly described by the Business Review Weekly as the<br />
biggest tax reform in decades. So whilst a GST is not on this term, I've said that, and<br />
it's not going to change and I just repeat that, to suggest that there have been no tax<br />
changes at all, particularly a change like that that will help literally 70 80% of small<br />
businesses in Australia in a quite mammoth degree...<br />
GO WARD:<br />
But Rupert Murdoch makes the point that terms here are very short, three years. You<br />
say no tax reform this time.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I said no GST.<br />
GO WARD.:<br />
Sorry, no GST this time.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, there's plenty of tax reform and we've fixed the capital gains tax burden for small<br />
business. That's a pretty major reform given they employ so many Australians.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
All right but if it is going to be next term and you've got a chorus of business people<br />
calling for it, is it time you started indicating your sympathy to it, I mean, where you're<br />
going to go with it? We don't really know whether you even want a GST.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I haven't said anything about anything being next term. I've only just started this term.<br />
The time to talk about next term is when next term is approaching. I haven't finished a<br />
year yet. Everybody should just have a holiday at Christmas and I hope they do but we<br />
look back on nine months of doing all the things we said we were going to do and<br />
anybody who has really followed Australian politics closely would have to<br />
acknowledge often to their surprise and against their predictions that my Government<br />
has actually delivered on all the essential commitments it made at the last election. </p>
<p>GO WARD:<br />
And a double dissolution for this term is now out of the question.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You never say never about anything in politics but I like the idea of governing for three<br />
years at a time but I'm not going to say " never" about something like that. I certainly<br />
don't have it in contemplation but you can't ever say never in politics.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Howe Leather was a big issue when President Clinton's visit was upon us. Cabinet<br />
was to have decided what to do to help those 500 workers hanging out for Christmas.<br />
What did you decide on that this week?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well that matter is still under discussion.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
So it was not raised at Cabinet as Mr Moore indicated.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't normally talk about what was raised or not raised at Cabinet. I simply say<br />
to you it's still under discussion.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Those 500 workers might like to know.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I understand that and thank you for taking up their cause and I'm very sensitive to it as<br />
well. GO WARD:<br />
But it is about industry policy isn't it and a complaint that business makes that there<br />
isn't one.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well there is. I mean, industry policy is low inflation, low interest rates, industrial<br />
relations reform, other microeconomic reform. There is a debate, the debate is about<br />
the extent to which governments should specifically intervene or provide specific<br />
support to particular industries. I mean let's cut through... </p>
<p>GO WARD:<br />
Like Howe Leather, yes<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
let's cut through the generality, the verbiage. The debate about industry policy is the<br />
debate about the extent to which governments should explicitly intervene to give<br />
subsidies or incentives...<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Or tariffs.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
or tariffs. Although tariffs are really increasingly on the way out in an era of floating<br />
exchange rates. I mean, our general tariff rate's down to five per cent apart from the<br />
motors and the textiles. So it really is about the extent to which you specifically<br />
intervene and give a nudge in a particular direction. That's what the debate about<br />
industry policy is about. So it's a pretty limited debate. Nobody surely would contest<br />
the proposition that if you have a low inflation, lower interest rate climate is a more<br />
benign atmosphere for investment.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
And the waterfront, that is one of your challenges there are reports this morning that<br />
you're prepared to send the troops in. Rupert Murdoch might like to hear that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, that didn't come from me or from any of the Ministers I've spoken too unless<br />
they had conversations that were totally different from the ones I've had. Sounds as<br />
though somebody's been to a Christmas party too many.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
What, a Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no, it hasn't come from a Minister. My understanding is that when you say a<br />
senior source you don't mean a Minister. Anyway...<br />
GO WARD:<br />
But you deny it, you don't think you'll go that far? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh look, we don't have any plans to use troops. And as far as putting unionists in<br />
gaol, the only circumstances unionists would go to gaol would be like you or me, if<br />
they or we break the criminal law.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
There is also some concern about the Government's determination to get on top of the<br />
deficit, the Government deficit...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Really. Most of the commentary this year has been that we've gone too far.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
But I think you'd agree that economic commentators are concerned that there won't<br />
be... PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no. And most of them... there are one or two... there will always be one or two<br />
who, for the purpose of as they see it, keeping everybody honest, they want to push it<br />
a bit further. I mean, they operate on the principle that it's DR plus one deficit<br />
reduction plus a bit more. And even if you put the thing into surplus they say you've<br />
got to have a bigger surplus. That's all right, I accept that. But nobody seriously says<br />
we squibbed fiscal consolidation. We did a terrific job.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
But is that the end of it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we're having a mid-year review. What I said on a sister programme to yours last<br />
week was that we didn't have in mind a repeat of the magnitude of last year. But as to<br />
precisely what we do in the budget, we have a parameter of getting it into underlying<br />
balance if we can in year three, we want to hang on to the $ 7.2 billion of savings over a<br />
two year period.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
And the ' if we can' is not a proviso?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no, look stop... you people, with great respect, do spend too much time sort of<br />
grabbing on to something. We've set ourselves a goal and we're working towards that </p>
<p>goal. But the thing I said was not sort of going through an exercise similar to last<br />
year. But that doesn't mean to say there won't be further savings sought and<br />
particularly if people want to spend more money in their portfolios they will need to<br />
find offsetting savings.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Now, the social issue debate of the year Rupert Murdoch, amongst others, says<br />
you've been distracted by others.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, he said... I1 was fascinated with his comment that we were distracted by the guns<br />
debate. Well, yes I was. I plead guilty to that. I think the Australian public wanted<br />
me to be distracted by that. They, in fact, didn't regard it as a distraction. And safety<br />
in the streets and in public places and in the home is a mainstream social issue in this<br />
country, as it is in the country of Mr Murdoch's residence, the United States. I'm<br />
surprised that anybody, anybody would see concern about that as being nothing better<br />
than a distraction.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
You might have considered the race debate an initially a distraction, but would you<br />
agree now that it is feeding into real things like university students not wanting to enrol<br />
here? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Whenever anything. I mean, if people, either before or after Pauline Hanson made her<br />
speech, are the subject of any kind of racial insult, I mean, I find that absolutely<br />
repulsive. And I want to take the opportunity of saying that students from Malaysia,<br />
indeed foreign students generally, are very welcome, very welcome indeed in this<br />
country... GO WARD:<br />
He's talking about bringing them home.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we'll wait and see...<br />
GO WARD:<br />
But it is feeding in, isn't it </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, can I just finish. They are very, very welcome in this country. We've not had a<br />
race debate. We've had a debate about responses to a speech and nobody in the<br />
Government, nobody in the Opposition, nobody is seriously arguing that we should go<br />
back to the White Australia policy. I've made that very clear under no circumstances<br />
is that going to happen. We have a non-discriminatory immigration policy and we<br />
always will. The level of that immigration intake is something for very legitimate<br />
debate. We're really having a debate about responses to a speech and I've expressed<br />
the view before that I think if a lot of people, including many in the media, had<br />
followed my example on that you probably wouldn't be asking me that question this<br />
morning. GO WA RD<br />
And the Republic, Prime Minister, you've promised a Peoples' Convention half<br />
elected will you deliver that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We are looking at all of that at the moment. What we will deliver is a process that will<br />
fuilly involve the Australian people.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
But it might not be that half elected Peoples' Convention.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we are looking quite honestly at whether there's a different way. You can have<br />
half appointed, half fully elected. You could have half appointed, half elected in an<br />
indirect fashion involving local government and State governments. You could have<br />
some kind of indicative plebiscite first and then have some kind of convention. We are<br />
looking at a whole range of ways...<br />
GO WARD:<br />
The word ' Convention' will appear eventually?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I would be quite surprised if at the end of our deliberations the process does not<br />
involve ' Convention'. But what's important in this is that we don't wrap it under<br />
push it under the carpet but equally we don't push it with unnecessary haste and also<br />
that we have a process that involves everybody fuilly and I can assure the Australian<br />
people that will happen. But I'm not going to be, sort of I'm not going to have a<br />
timetable forced on me by visiting commentators. </p>
<p>GO WARD:<br />
All right. Just two quick ones Prime Minister. Health reforms do you consider there<br />
might be a need to change the community rating principle?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it's a central element of our policy and I'm going to obviously look at the<br />
Productivity Commission Report. I'm going to read it over the holiday break and see<br />
what it's got to say. But I haven't read it yet, I've only read the newspaper reports<br />
and a brief summary provided by my Department. So all I can say is that until further<br />
notice the current policy stands.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
And finally and I guess in a way this is a curiosity item, it's an insight into you why<br />
won't you send a good will message to that gay Mardi Gras rally in Sydney? Just why<br />
not? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I don't send messages to everybody who asks me for one. I've actually got... . it's<br />
not a question of a view about homosexuality but there are certain groups in the<br />
community who are sort of subject to ridicule in that parade. And some of those<br />
groups, I mean they've had a bit of a shot at Catholic nuns for example, they've had a<br />
bit of a shot at other public figures who I've had sort of cordial relations with. I just<br />
choose for those and other reasons. But it's really got nothing to do with a view about<br />
homosexual conduct. I think people who know me and know me well know that the<br />
last thing that I am is in any way hostile towards individuals who are homosexual<br />
quite the reverse. But I choose for those I've stated and other reasons not to. And the<br />
fact that I'm apparently alone doesn't trouble me. I haven't sought out to be I<br />
haven't sought out to do that but if that's the situation, that's the situation, so be it.<br />
GO WARD:<br />
Prime Minister thank you and happy Christmas.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And you too. </p>
