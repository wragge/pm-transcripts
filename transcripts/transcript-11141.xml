<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>John Howard, now that Australian police are committed to East Timor,</p>
<p> what will they actually do?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, all of that is to be worked out with the United Nations. What</p>
<p> I have said is that if we are asked by the UN we will respond sympathetically</p>
<p> but the numbers and precisely what they will do is to be discussed</p>
<p> with the Secretary-General.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>But it will only be an advisory role. It seems very clear from what</p>
<p> the Indonesians are saying that they would not expect the UN advisers</p>
<p> including Australians to participate beyond an advisory role, is that</p>
<p> your understanding?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think you will find that there will be a reasonably flexible interpretation</p>
<p> given to that. The exact terms of their engagement will be worked</p>
<p> out. Clearly, the Indonesians see themselves as having a prime responsibility</p>
<p> for security and safety because it's in their country. Plainly</p>
<p> the rest of the world including Australia wants to be satisfied that</p>
<p> there are adequate numbers of police to support the consultative process.</p>
<p> There is still an amount of detail to be worked out. It's an</p>
<p> unusual situation, it's not entirely novel. We have involved</p>
<p> ourselves in policing operations before. We want to be constructive,</p>
<p> we want to be helpful but we also want to be satisfied that our men</p>
<p> and women will be safe.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Given the death threats that have already been received by Australians</p>
<p> from the pro-Indonesian militia in East Timor, what assurances have</p>
<p> you received from President Habibie and General Wiranto about security</p>
<p> for the Australians that we would be sending there including medical</p>
<p> teams, Red Cross and so on?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, I have received plenty of general assurances of course. They are</p>
<p> part and parcel of negotiation and I am grateful for those but we'll</p>
<p> want more in our discussions with the Secretary-General with the United</p>
<p> Nations. We'll need to be satisfied, as far as we humanly can,</p>
<p> that our men and women will be as safe as possible recognising that</p>
<p> it would be foolhardy of me to pretend to anybody who goes into a</p>
<p> theatre such as that that there isn't some element of personal</p>
<p> risk involved. And that's part of the, I guess, the responsibility.</p>
<p> It's part of the life that people who are involved in police</p>
<p> and in the defence forces take on. Now, I'm not going to pretend</p>
<p> that there'll be no danger. It's my responsibility as Prime</p>
<p> Minister to tell the truth about that. It's also my responsibility</p>
<p> to try and get the maximum security arrangements that I can and I'll</p>
<p> be taking expert advice on that and we'll certainly be pushing</p>
<p> for that very hard.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>As you say, the Indonesian military are insisting that all security</p>
<p> in East Timor, leading up to the ballot, will be provided by them.</p>
<p> Given the highly questionable track record of the military right up</p>
<p> to this time in East Timor, how relaxed are you about having Australians</p>
<p> in their hands?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Kerry, I'm not relaxed about any aspect of this issue. It's</p>
<p> very difficult. And what we have tried to play is a constructive role.</p>
<p> We've tried to use our influence. We haven't walked away</p>
<p> from the problem, nor have we been unnecessarily bellicose about it</p>
<p> and I think we've got somewhere as a result. We want there to</p>
<p> be a civilian police presence under the auspices of the United Nations.</p>
<p> We want that to be adequate in numbers. And I'll need to be satisfied</p>
<p> that the arrangements are as secure as we can possibly make them for</p>
<p> any Australian to participate, not only as police but also as part</p>
<p> of the UN group that will actually conduct the consultation or the</p>
<p> ballot. In a sense, there are two separate roles.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>How convinced are you that General Wiranto will put his full weight,</p>
<p> as leader of the armed forces, behind providing adequate security</p>
<p> in Indonesia given that the kind of intelligence advice that you yourself</p>
<p> have been receiving that General Wiranto has been, quote: "at</p>
<p> least turning a blind eye", to killings in East Timor and failing</p>
<p> to rein in his own soldiers?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Kerry, I can't give rock solid guarantees, nobody can. But what</p>
<p> I can say is that I am a lot more confident now than I was a week</p>
<p> ago, or two or three weeks ago, that the Indonesians are very serious</p>
<p> about trying to restore a measure of stability and providing a reasonably</p>
<p> decent and open and non-intimidatory climate for the ballot. The eyes</p>
<p> of the world are far more on the Indonesians now than they were a</p>
<p> few days ago and certainly a few weeks ago. Indonesia needs the understanding</p>
<p> and the benevolence of the rest of the world because of her economic</p>
<p> difficulties. I think we should give credit to Habibie and others.</p>
<p> After all, he's the first Indonesian leader to accept the notion</p>
<p> of a free choice by the East Timorese people. The presence of General</p>
<p> Wiranto at yesterday's meeting and his involvement in the discussions</p>
<p> and the agreement that came out of it was reassuring to me.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Has President Habibie convinced you that Indonesia can deliver on</p>
<p> disarmament of all those, the paramilitary and others, on the pro-independence</p>
<p> side before the August ballot? I mean, did he present himself as confident</p>
<p> to you on that issue?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, he asserted great confidence, yes, he did. And certainly I found</p>
<p> him genuine. I also recognise that as the President of a country of</p>
<p> 211 million people, with many of those people in absolute poverty,</p>
<p> with an enormous economic challenge, with great ethnic diversity,</p>
<p> with 3,000 islands in the archipelago and only 900,000 East Timorese</p>
<p> out of 211 million, he does have other challenges and other responsibilities.</p>
<p> And I sometimes think the rest of the world loses sight of that.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Has he indicated how soon the disarmament process will begin presuming</p>
<p> that that document is signed at the UN on May 5, putting the framework</p>
<p> in?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, well, responding to that, Kerry, he argues that that process</p>
<p> of restoring a more normal situation, including people being encouraged</p>
<p> and obliged to lay down arms, that that process has already begun</p>
<p>  that it began last week when General Wiranto went to Dili when</p>
<p> they signed that agreement involving Xanana Gusmao and other leaders</p>
<p> when the peace and stability commission was established. Now, obviously</p>
<p> we all have to wait and see developments as they unfold. We try to</p>
<p> exert the maximum pressure consistent with retaining a capacity to</p>
<p> influence the outcome. We offer to help both financially and on appropriate</p>
<p> conditions with our personnel. Now, it is a difficult and fragile</p>
<p> situation and I'm not representing to the Australian people that</p>
<p> everything is going to go perfectly and swimmingly from now on. What</p>
<p> I am saying to them is that I am a lot more confident now than I was</p>
<p> a week ago. And this is the only path that Australia can follow. I</p>
<p> mean, we can't walk away and ignore it, nor are we going to sort</p>
<p> of turn around and invade the country. We really have to keep a proper</p>
<p> sense of perspective. We have three alternatives. We use our influence.</p>
<p> We have the unacceptable alternative of military action which is,</p>
<p> you know, absolutely totally and utterly out of the question, of course</p>
<p> it is. Thirdly, we just throw up our arms and say, well, we disengage,</p>
<p> we withdraw from any help to Indonesia, we sever our military ties,</p>
<p> we chop off our aid and we walk away. I don't think that will</p>
<p> help the East Timorese people.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Briefly on the GST, Prime Minister. Given the extent of Senator Harradine's</p>
<p> concerns about the GST, despite all of your assurances and Treasurer</p>
<p> Costello's assurances, concerns covering food, rent, transport,</p>
<p> clothing, charities, compensation for pensioners and many others,</p>
<p> how will you be able to meet those concerns without significantly</p>
<p> rewriting your tax package?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Kerry, we are looking very closely at what Senator Harradine</p>
<p> had to put. We're obviously not going to gut the package for</p>
<p> anybody but we are going to be willing to fine-tune it. I'm not</p>
<p> going to get drawn  fair question and I understand why you ask</p>
<p> it  but I'm not going to get drawn any further than that.</p>
<p> We want his support. We want Senator Colston's support. We'd</p>
<p> like the support of the Australian Democrats. We're not prepared</p>
<p> to take food out because that will represent a gutting of the package.</p>
<p> We are prepared to fine-tune. And obviously there will be a lot of</p>
<p> talk between now and the 30th of June.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>Okay, but there's obviously a clear difference between fine-tuning</p>
<p> and removing the tax on food or clothing and so on?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I've said that we're not going to take the tax off</p>
<p> food - we've said that all along  or, indeed, on something</p>
<p> like clothing. But there are other ways in which you can fine-tune</p>
<p> without damaging the essential commodity.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>We're going to be fascinated to see how you deal with that. You</p>
<p> had a very strong moral view against taking Senator Colston's</p>
<p> vote when he was first charged over the alleged travel rorts. His</p>
<p> case will be back in court in the next few days. The DPP will have</p>
<p> to make a decision about proceeding or not. Do you really now feel</p>
<p> no compunction about accepting Senator Colston's vote in these</p>
<p> circumstances?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it is no different from the Labor Party using Carmen Lawrence's</p>
<p> vote in the Lower House, is it?</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>We're talking about, we're talking about the expressions</p>
<p> of concern that you had on...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, no, look I accept, Kerry, that we changed our position from</p>
<p> about 18 months ago, we changed our position after the election. I</p>
<p> accept that and I think with the benefit of hindsight I probably took</p>
<p> too severe a view. And I should have stuck to the simple principle</p>
<p> that every man and woman is entitled to a presumption of innocence.</p>
<p> Now, Mal Colston is in exactly the same position as Carmen Lawrence.</p>
<p> And I make no comment on Carmen Lawrence other than to use her as</p>
<p> a comparison. She's entitled to a presumption of innocence. So</p>
<p> is he. That's our law. That's our doctrine. Now, we went</p>
<p> beyond that before the last election. We changed our position after</p>
<p> the election. I was criticised for that. I accept the criticism. There's</p>
<p> nothing I can do about it. But as of now, the fact that his case is</p>
<p> on call-over next week doesn't alter the position that unless</p>
<p> and until a man or woman is convicted, that person is entitled to</p>
<p> a presumption of innocence.</p>
<p>O'BRIEN:</p>
<p>John Howard, thanks for talking with us.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Pleasure.</p>
