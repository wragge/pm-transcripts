FOR PRESS P. M. V No 12/ 1970<br />
CONVERSION TO METRIC SYSTEM<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
Following detailed consideration of the recommendations made by<br />
the Senate Select Committee on the adoption of the Metric System of Weights<br />
and Measures, the Government has decided that Australia should convert to<br />
the Metric System as soon as possible.<br />
The Commonwealth has notified the States of this decision and has<br />
suggested that arrangements be made for a conference with them to discuss<br />
co-operation in those areas where co-operation may be required.<br />
The Government believes that the lasting benefits which will result<br />
from this decision will greatly outweigh the not inconsiderable transitional<br />
difficulties involved.<br />
The Government's aim is to complete the changeover during a<br />
period of ten years although conversion will be completed much sooner than<br />
this in some sectors.<br />
It is proposed to set up a Metric Conversion Board, on which a wide<br />
range of interests will be represented, to plan, guide, and facilitate conversion.<br />
The Board will be responsible to the Government through the Minister for<br />
Education Science and will be expected to make appropriate recommendations<br />
from time to time after full consultation with those concerned.<br />
Although the . Government realises that some compensation may be paid in<br />
such unusual and special cases as are accepted by the Government on the<br />
recommendation of the Metric Conversion Board it is expected that, as in other<br />
countries the costs of effecting the change will, in general, be borne by those<br />
incurring them. By allowing time for natural obsolescence and depreciation<br />
of plant and machinery the cost of conversion will be greatly reduced.<br />
Experience in other countries such as Japan where conversion is complete<br />
has shown that by forethought and good planning these costs can be greatly<br />
reduced. The decision to convert is in line with decisions which have already<br />
been taken in the United Kingdom, South Africa, New Zealand and South East<br />
Asian countries and in announcing it the Government wishes to pay tribute to the<br />
work of the Senate Select Committee under the leadership of the late Senator<br />
Keith Laught.<br />
