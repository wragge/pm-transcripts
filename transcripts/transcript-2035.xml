PRESENTATION TO H. M. A. S. HOBART OF U. S.<br />
NAVY UNIT COMMENDATION 14HAY 1969<br />
SYDNEY, N. S. W. 21 APRIL 1969<br />
Speech by the _ Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Admiral Baumberger, Admiral Grabbe, Parliamentary Colleagues<br />
and Distinguished Guests and Officers and Men of the Royal<br />
Australian Navy:-This is a proud day for the Royal Australian Navy<br />
and for the officers and men of HMAS Hobart in particular, all of<br />
those who have served in her in the past or who are now serving in<br />
her. To you, Admiral Baumberger, I say thank you for all<br />
you have said, thank you for the honour you do the Australian Navy,<br />
and, through it, the Australian people, by the presentation of this<br />
Unit Commendation from the United States Navy.<br />
I take this opportunity of personally congratulating<br />
Commodore Griffiths and those who served with him when this<br />
Commendation was won. The job they did was in the best and finest<br />
traditions of the Australian Navy.<br />
This, too, I think, is a day we will all remember as<br />
one more demonstration of the friendship between the Australian<br />
and the American people, a day when our comradeship in arms with<br />
the United States receives special recognition. I say with great<br />
conviction that our two countries are not " fair-weather friends"<br />
We have stayed together, we stay together and we stick together<br />
whether the going is rough or smooth.<br />
Hobart's service with the Seventh Fleet as " an eager,<br />
aggressive and dauntless member" ( to quote from the Commendation)<br />
is an example of that spirit. It's been like that for a long time now,<br />
and that's how I believe it will continue.<br />
This is the first Unit Commendation from the United<br />
States Navy to be awarded to a ship of the Australian Fleet and it will<br />
have a special place in the battle honours of our Navy. For myself,<br />
I feel particularly gratified because I like to feel, in a way, that<br />
Hobart was one of my ships. She was the second of the three guided<br />
missile destroyers ordered from the United States during my time<br />
as Minister for the Navy and she was the first Australian warship to<br />
serve in Vietnam. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
I say to you all officers and men of the Navy here<br />
today that though the conflict in Vietnam is long, and though our<br />
naval ships are engaged on faraway seas, the Australian public and<br />
Government do not forget you.<br />
They admire and respect you for the way you are<br />
doing your job. They are grateful to you for what you are contributing.<br />
They support you. And zhese, of course, are sentiments that apply.<br />
to all our servicemen who are performing with such distinction. IndIeed,<br />
it was less than a year ago in Washington that I had the privilege of<br />
accepting a Presidential citation on behalf of the Sixth Battalion Royal<br />
Australian Regiment. Hobart has done two tours of duty with the Seventh Fleet<br />
off Vietnam and, as you know, is just across the way at Garden Island<br />
refitting. She is being given even sharper teeth by the fitting of an<br />
Australian-made, Australian-designed anti-submarine missile system,<br />
[ kara, and I have no doubt that she will continue to give a good account<br />
of herself, wherever she is engaged.<br />
Today there is change all round and the Australian Navy,<br />
along with our other Armed Forces, will have continuing commitments<br />
in Pacific and Asian waters even when the conflict in Vietnam is over.<br />
It must be the best-equipped and the strongest Navy our resources can<br />
allow, and that's the responsibility of the Government and its advisers.<br />
But it must also be the best-led and the best-manned fleet. And that is<br />
up to the officers and men who man it, and if they continue to man it in<br />
they way in which they have, then there is no doubt it will be the<br />
best -officered and best -led fleet.<br />
I thank you, Sir, for being here today. thank the United<br />
States Navy for Hobart's commendation and all that it means to us, to<br />
the officers and men who have served or are serving in Hobart and to<br />
the Australian people from which they come. </p>
