    <content><![CDATA[<p>The White Paper on Homelessness, The Road Home, was launched today by the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and the Minister for Housing, Tanya Plibersek.</p>
<p>The White Paper outlines a plan for reducing homelessness in Australia by 2020, with specific goals to:</p>
<p>     * Halve overall homelessness; and</p>
<p>     * Provide accommodation to all rough sleepers who seek it.</p>
<p>There are currently 105,000 homeless people in Australia, of whom around 16,000 sleep rough.</p>
<p>The White Paper is a huge injection of funds. It provides an additional $1.2 billion over four years - a 55% increase in investment in homelessness and a substantial down payment on a twelve year reform agenda.</p>
<p>It includes a commitment of $800 million over the next four years for new support services for homeless people and $400 million over the next two financial years for social housing, to house the homelessness.</p>
<p>This injection of funds is part of a $15.1 billion package agreed by the Council of Australian Governments that will stimulate the economy and generate up to 133,000 jobs over coming years.</p>
<p>In response to overwhelming feedback from consultations on the Green Paper, the White Paper focuses on three core strategies:</p>
<p>     * Turning off the tap' - better prevention of homelessness</p>
<p>     * Improving and expanding services to help more homeless people</p>
<p>     * Breaking the cycle of homelessness by providing long term housing and support.</p>
<p>Through new funding and reforms we aim to:</p>
<p>     * Help up to 9,000 more young people to remain connected with their families; </p>
<p>     * Help up to 2,250 more families at risk of homelessness to stay housed;</p>
<p>     * Provide day to day support to an extra 1,000 adults with mental illness; </p>
<p>     * Build up to 2,700 additional public and community houses for low income households who are at risk of homelessness;</p>
<p>     * Fund a network of 90 Community Engagement Officers within Centrelink to support people at risk of homelessness; and</p>
<p>     * Build up to 4,200 new houses and upgrade up to 4,800 existing houses in remote Indigenous communities </p>
<p>     * Allocate aged care places and capital funds for at least 1 new specialist facility for older homeless people every year for the next four years.</p>
<p>Homelessness is everyone's responsibility and the White Paper offers a once in a generation opportunity to reduce homelessness in Australia.</p>
<p>This White Paper was the first to be announced by the Rudd Government, which promised to make tackling homelessness a priority.</p>
<p>The White Paper delivers on that promise.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to monitor developments in homelessness and will take further action where necessary.</p>
<p>The Government recognises the critical need for national leadership, a clear vision and measurable goals.</p>
<p>Reducing homelessness is a shared responsibility that will take a sustained financial and reform effort by all levels of government, business, charities and the community.</p>
<p>The White Paper is available at Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA) website or by calling 1800 774 055.</p>
