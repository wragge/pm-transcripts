The Gillard Government will provide $21.4 million to construct a new cancer care centre at Springfield to help local residents suffering from cancer get access to quality care.</p>
<p>The new centre will offer day and radiation oncology, and include two new linear accelerators, consultation rooms and a research unit.</p>
<p>Speaking in Springfield, the Prime Minister said this funding would help improve cancer outcomes for patients in the region.</p>
<p>The Western Corridor has been identified as having one of the highest needs for radiotherapy services in Queensland.</p>
<p>This new centre will reduce the need for patients to travel to facilities in Brisbane or Toowoomba for treatment.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister thanked Mater Health Services for their in-kind contribution of the land on which the Centre will be built, valued at $2 million.</p>
<p>Mater Health Services and the Springfield Land Corporation are working in partnership to develop the centre, and their vision for the region is appreciated by the entire community.</p>
<p>Radiation Oncology Queensland, an experienced private radiation oncology provider, will also be working in partnership with them to deliver expert radiation oncology services at the centre.</p>
<p>The Government has already committed $650 million to 24 regional cancer centre projects that support people with cancer to access the right care at the right time, as close as possible to home and family.</p>
<p>This commitment builds on the Government's already significant investment in cancer research, prevention, detection and treatment. </p>
