VISIT BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF MALAYA<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that the Prime<br />
Minister of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman, had accepted an invitation<br />
to visit Australia between 30th October and 14+ th November<br />
of this year. He would have discussions with the Australian<br />
Cabinet in Canberra and fulfil a number of important engagements.<br />
He would attend the opening of the Commonwealth<br />
Parliamentary Association meeting in Canberra and in the course<br />
of his stay there would also open the new offices and residence<br />
of the High Commissioner for Malaya. He would also visit some<br />
Australian States. Mr. Menzies said that he greatly looked<br />
forward to seeing Tunku Abdul Rabman who would be most welcome<br />
in Australia. Mr. Menzies added that he would visit Indonesia from<br />
about 2nd to 7th December. After that he would go on to visit<br />
Malaya between 7th and 12th December. He will be accompanied<br />
by Dame Pattie Menzies. He would have discussions with Government<br />
leaders in Indonesia and Malaya as well as seeing as much<br />
as he could of both countries which were important neighbours<br />
of Australia. Mr. Menzies said that his forthcoming journey<br />
would enable him to have firsthand contact with Indonesia which<br />
he had previously visited only for a very short time during the<br />
recent war. It had been necessary to defer the plans which<br />
he had made for Zoing there in 1956. It would also be his<br />
first visit to Malaya since that country achieved its independence<br />
in 1957. Mr. Menzies said that he had not set down any particular<br />
subjects for discussion withthe Indonesian and Malayan<br />
Prime Ministers nor had they proposed any to him. He-greatly<br />
appreciated both invitations he had received and he regarded<br />
the visits as falling into the general pattern he had been following<br />
of extending his personal contacts with the leaders of<br />
South and South-East Asian States.<br />
