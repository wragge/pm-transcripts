PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL 12 NOON<br />
FOR MEDIA 23 JUNE 1990<br />
New Zealand Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. Geoffrey Palmer will<br />
visit Australia from 28 June to 3 July 1990 as a guest of<br />
the Australian Government.<br />
This will be Mr Palmer's first visit to Australia as Prime<br />
Minister and it reciprocates my visit to New Zealand in<br />
February this year to commemorate the 150th Anniversary of<br />
the Treaty of Waitangi.<br />
Mr Palmer's visit coincides with the achievement on 1 July<br />
of full free trade in goods between Australia and<br />
New Zealand under CER.<br />
The main topic of discussions during the visit will be the<br />
current state and future directions of the CER agreement.<br />
Our talks will also cover a range of bilateral, regional and<br />
global issues, including the environment, when Mr Palmer<br />
meets with me and other Ministers in Canberra on 2 July. Mr<br />
Palmer will also visit Melbourne to meet community leaders<br />
and representatives of the business community.<br />
Both Australia and New Zealand can be proud of the speed and<br />
magnitude of the progress achieved to date under the CER<br />
Agreement. Our next challenge is to make progress towards<br />
removal of the few remaining barriers to trade in the<br />
services area, and to achieve greater harmonisation in a<br />
range of areas including business law, quarantine, and<br />
customs. I am confident that our talks will reinforce the<br />
momentum for reform.<br />
I welcome Prime Minister Palmer's visit not only as an<br />
opportunity to mark the achievements of the CER Agreement to<br />
date, but also as a timely demonstration of our political<br />
will to continue the process of greater integration of our<br />
economies. </p>
