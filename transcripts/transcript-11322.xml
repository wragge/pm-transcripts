    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...................</p>
<p>  Thank you very much Chris. To his worship the Mayor, to my ministerial colleague,</p>
<p>   Nick Minchin, to Shane Stone the Federal President of the Liberal Party,</p>
<p>   other distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>  Last night we were all delayed a little bit waiting for some legislation</p>
<p>   to go through the Senate to finally resolve the question to be put to the</p>
<p>   Australian public on the 6th of November in relation to the two</p>
<p>   issues of our Constitutional arrangements and the preamble.</p>
<p>  And I offered a lift on the VIP to Robert Hill and to Chris Gallus and to</p>
<p>   Alexander Downer. And we had a very, very pleasant discussion on the way</p>
<p>   over about a whole range of things. And about half an hour after we'd been</p>
<p>   up in the air Chris said: what are you doing for dinner tonight? And I said:</p>
<p>   well, eating. And she then said: well, why don't you join Alex and I in</p>
<p>   a restaurant in Glenelg. So we decided to do that and I had a very delightful</p>
<p>   evening last night in what is obviously a marvellous restaurant and soaked</p>
<p>   up some of the local ambience and experienced the great prosperity under</p>
<p>   the Howard Government here in the city of Adelaide.</p>
<p>  But I am particularly delighted to be here today. And when you have been</p>
<p>   in politics for a year or two you are always captured and enthralled by</p>
<p>   the ironies of politics. I mean, it really tickles my political fancy that</p>
<p>   a seat like Hindmarsh which for so many years was held by the Australian</p>
<p>   Labor Party is now in Liberal party hands. That intrigues me greatly.</p>
<p>  But I know this is a non-political occasion and it's an occasion to declare</p>
<p>   open a new electorate office. It's an occasion for me as Prime Minister</p>
<p>   and as Leader of the Federal Parliamentary Liberal Party to congratulate</p>
<p>   Christine Gallus on the tremendous work that she has done in the years that</p>
<p>   she has been in Parliament since 1990. She won a very difficult seat. It</p>
<p>   was not easy, it's never been easy to retain it.</p>
<p>  And over the years South Australia has delivered to, may I very proudly</p>
<p>   say, my Government has delivered to us as very large number of seats. A</p>
<p>   disproportionately large number of seats but a happily disproportionately</p>
<p>   large number of seats. And if I may be gender selective for a moment one</p>
<p>   of the reasons for that is that here in the State of South Australia we</p>
<p>   have been very lucky to have a large number of extremely skilful female</p>
<p>   members of Parliament who have brought particular campaigning skills. And</p>
<p>   indeed of all of the States of Australia we have a larger percentage in</p>
<p>   our ranks of women representing the people of Australia in the Federal Parliament</p>
<p>   than in any other part of the country. And that is a particularly important</p>
<p>   thing and Christine's own campaign skills have been very, very considerable</p>
<p>   and much admired. Her electorate's boundaries have changed, bits have come</p>
<p>   in that weren't expected and other bits have gone out that were lamented.</p>
<p>   But overall she's managed to project the stance of somebody who is involved</p>
<p>   with and concerned about her local community.</p>
<p>  The late Speaker of the American House of Representatives, Tip O'Neil, coined</p>
<p>   that now fairly well known phrase that all politics was local. And it is.</p>
<p>   And any of us who lose sight of the fact that politics is local and any</p>
<p>   of us who lose sight of the fact that you need to retain contract with your</p>
<p>   local community will very quickly find yourself either out of office or</p>
<p>   out of a seat. And as I look around today I can see that Chris Gallus has</p>
<p>   retained contact with her local community in a very impressive and a very</p>
<p>   representative way. And that that is the foundation of high quality representation</p>
<p>   in either the State Parliament or in the national Parliament.</p>
<p>  It is a time where it's very easy for us as Australians to feel hopeful</p>
<p>   and optimistic about our future. We've had a lot of news this week. But</p>
<p>   in many ways the best news of all came yesterday when we learnt that the</p>
<p>   rate of youth unemployment in this country had fallen by 5.8 percentage</p>
<p>   points since March of 1996. And I think that is. Because in the end what</p>
<p>   the responsibility of any government is to provide hope and optimism and</p>
<p>   enthusiasm for the young in our community. And we still have a long way</p>
<p>   to go because we still have an unemployment rate which is too high, but</p>
<p>   it is a lot lower than what it was three years ago. And that is coming off</p>
<p>   the back of an economy which has given to this country, not only a rate</p>
<p>   of economic growth, but a sense of national pride and achievement that we</p>
<p>   haven't had for a long time.</p>
<p>  One of the best feelings I had when I went overseas a few weeks ago was</p>
<p>   that I was going over as the Leader of a country that had outperformed just</p>
<p>   about every other country in the world economically. I was going as the</p>
<p>   Prime Minister of a nation that was seen as the economic strongman of the</p>
<p>   Asian Pacific region. I was going as the Prime Minister of a country whose</p>
<p>   political stability and economic strength was widely respected all around</p>
<p>   the world.</p>
<p>  I had a meeting last Sunday in Sydney with, with Paul Volker, the former</p>
<p>   Chairman of the US Federal Reserve, the man who preceded Dr Alan Greenspan.</p>
<p>   And he knows a little bit about the worlds economies and he was out here</p>
<p>   for an economic conference with the Reserve Bank. And he spoke to me then</p>
<p>   of the admiration he felt for what the Australian economy had done over</p>
<p>   the last few years and I got a copy of the latest edition of the Fortune</p>
<p>   magazine which has a major spread on the performance of the Australian economy.</p>
<p>  Recently the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and the Economist</p>
<p>   have all spoken of our economic achievement. Now this has been no accident.</p>
<p>   You make your own luck in government and in politics as you do in life.</p>
<p>   Not all of it's luck, some of it's luck, some of it's luck but most of it</p>
<p>   is at the end of the hard work of the government, our commitment to pursuing</p>
<p>   policies that were a bit unpopular and a bit risky at the beginning, but</p>
<p>   they are now starting to bear fruit. And we are all starting to enjoy the</p>
<p>   benefit of them.</p>
<p>  But we haven't focussed just on economics. We don't just live to borrow</p>
<p>   that famous biblical injunction, by bread alone. We are interested in things</p>
<p>   that go the quality of life in our community. We have tried to develop in</p>
<p>   this community over the last three years what I call a social coalition,</p>
<p>   where you get together the government, the welfare organisations, the business</p>
<p>   communities and the energy of individuals to solve challenges. And I am</p>
<p>   going to have the great privilege at the lunch I'm addressing in Adelaide</p>
<p>   later today to announce a remarkable act of corporate philanthropy on behalf</p>
<p>   of a very well known South Australian resource company in relation to activities</p>
<p>   at the university here in Adelaide. And I will have the opportunity then</p>
<p>   to go into some more detail about that.</p>
<p>  But it is an example of the spirit of cooperation between governments, communities,</p>
<p>   individuals which is so important. And we have involved the great welfare</p>
<p>   organisations of this community not only in looking after the needy which</p>
<p>   is their historic capacity and mission, but we have also involved them in</p>
<p>   policy making and in a number of areas such as drugs and other areas I have</p>
<p>   directly involved in an executive policy making capacity organisations such</p>
<p>   as the City Missions and the Salvation Army and the Society of St Vincent</p>
<p>   de Paul, because they not only bring human compassion to the solution of</p>
<p>   problems but they also bring a great skill and a great policy making capacity.</p>
<p>  But, it's a bit cool here, I don't want to delay you with a long speech.</p>
<p>   I want to thank you. I want to thank Christine Gallus. I want to thank her</p>
<p>   and her campaign team and all of the people of the electorate of Hindmarsh</p>
<p>   for the community that you represent. Federal Members are here to serve</p>
<p>   all people. They are not only here to serve the people that voted for them,</p>
<p>   they are here to serve the people that voted against them. And when we become</p>
<p>   Members of Parliament we have an obligation to look after and serve and</p>
<p>   represent and put forward the views and the concerns of all sections of</p>
<p>   the Australian community. And Chris has done that very well. She's not (inaudible)</p>
<p>   she's carried the Liberal banner very passionately, but she has also carried</p>
<p>   the Hindmarsh banner and the community banner very passionately and that</p>
<p>   is tremendously important. And in the long run that's what makes a high</p>
<p>   quality government and high quality parliamentary representatives, representation.</p>
<p>  So, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations to you Christine. And now, I've</p>
<p>   got to cut a ribbon. Thank you very much.</p>
