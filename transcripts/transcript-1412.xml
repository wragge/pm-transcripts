M AN I LA-CONFERENCE<br />
NOTICE TO ALL MEDIA<br />
I would appreciate early advice from all news media<br />
planning to send correspondents to the Manila Conference.<br />
In order that the necessary accreditation can be<br />
arranged, our Embassy urgently requires the names of Australian<br />
correspondents covering the conference. For use on identification<br />
tags, I need a passport size photograph of each correspondent as soon<br />
as possible. I would also like to know proposed travel arrangements and<br />
whether accommodation in Manila has already been arranged.<br />
Mr. Holt has agreed that newsmen may, if they wish,<br />
travel to and from Manila in the Prime Minister's special charter<br />
aircraft. They would be charged for their seats but the cost is<br />
likely to be less than the regular commercial return fare. I will<br />
require early advice from those who want to travel in the aircraft.<br />
Camera men and photographers should let me have a list<br />
of their main equipment so that the Embassy can make the necessary<br />
arrangements with the Philippines Customs to prevent such equipment<br />
being placed in bond.<br />
The latest estimate is that there will be over 600 correspondents<br />
visiting the Philippines for the conference. A. EGOLETON<br />
Press Secretary to the Prime Minister<br />
