Jj.,. AUSTRALIA t<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 8 JANUARY 1986<br />
on. 10 July, 1986, the Royal Australian Navy celebrates 75 years<br />
of service to Australia. on behalf of the Government of Australia<br />
I congratulate past and present-Naval personnel on this<br />
outstanding record.<br />
The RAN is an integral element of the Australian Defence Force.<br />
AS such it trains for war to preserve peace but, if necessary, to<br />
help defend Australia's freedom and prosperity. The need for such<br />
defence, and the importance of the RAN's contribution to that<br />
defence, are amply demonstrated by the RAN's participation in two<br />
World Wars and other conflicts since it was founded in 1911. The<br />
peace and prosperity Australians currently enjoy are due in no<br />
small measure to the efforts and sacrifices of men and women who<br />
have served or are serving in the RAN.<br />
There will be several national highlights to mark the<br />
Anniversary of. the RAN. These include the Navy's ' Salute ' 1to<br />
Australia' in Sydney on Friday, 24 January. This will involve a<br />
massed Fleet entry into Sydney Harbour, a fly-past by the Fleet<br />
Air Arm, and a subsequent march by naval personnel through the<br />
streets of Sydney.<br />
on Monday, 3 March, Her Majesty the Queen will officially unveil<br />
a National Naval Memorial in Anzac Parade, Canberra, at a<br />
ceremonial parade involving 1200 serving personnel and 2000<br />
ex-naval men and women representing ship associations from all<br />
parts of Australia.<br />
Friendly and allied navies closely associated with the RAN have<br />
been invited to participate in a Naval Review to be staged on<br />
Sydney Harbour on Saturday, 4 October. The -reviewing officer will<br />
be His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh, who is Admiral of<br />
the Fleet of the Royal Australian Navy. The Review will be<br />
followed two days later by a major air show at the Naval Air<br />
Station Nowra, in which aircraft from visiting fleet units are<br />
expected to participate.<br />
I wish the Royal/ Australian Navy every success in celebrating its<br />
Anniversary during 1986. </p>
