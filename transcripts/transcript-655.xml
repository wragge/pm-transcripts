Mr. President and Gentlemen<br />
I was thinking of the nrme of your body, the<br />
National Farmers Union and that naturally rovoked in me<br />
thoughts about the importance of a measure of unity among<br />
organisations which represent primary producers and I know<br />
that your own body represents a very substantial move in<br />
that field. It has always been important, it has always<br />
been difficult, because if I m! ay say so, having been born<br />
among them and seen a few of them since the man on the<br />
land is essentially an individualist, t hasn't been an<br />
easy task to develop organisations of yciiur kind, but it is<br />
tremendously important that that kind of work should go on,<br />
I believe that we are, increasingly, in a period in Australia<br />
when the highest possible degree of concerted opinion and<br />
concerted advocacy on the part of men on the land will be<br />
needed. I dontt say that in a gloomy way, hut I say it<br />
because I think we are entering a period of very great<br />
challenge. ! e have this challenge confronting us, as a<br />
matter of fct, in several ways.<br />
First of all, we hiiave all been exorcising our<br />
minds about the Common Market and I dontt propose to make<br />
a long talk to you about that becaus, really, there is yet<br />
very little fresh to be said on it as a result of whlat has<br />
or hasn't happened in the last six wee* ks. But I do think<br />
that we all reaise that unless these negotiations by Great<br />
Britain break down compl. etely, which is in the highest<br />
degroe improbable I would havs thought, then the terms on<br />
whichl Great Britain wi. ll ultimately enter the E. E. C. must<br />
have an impact on what has bean our traditional pattern of<br />
trade. We can't expect in the next six months or twelve<br />
months or whatever it may be to find that we are going<br />
along the old aths and existing in the middle of the same<br />
pattern of Comonwalth trade. Those things are going to<br />
be changed, And because they are going to be changed and<br />
because the markets that we must look for and explore wil. l,<br />
themselvces, tend to chsngeo tLhen it becomes infiniteJ. y more<br />
important that the views or primary producers as a wholo in<br />
Austiralia, in the defence and promotion of their owvn interests,<br />
should be, as far as possible, fully concerted ones,<br />
There is another aspect of the matter, One<br />
of the great problems that has confronted Australia andt<br />
we are not the only one to be confronted by it in the last<br />
ton years has been the remarka1le decline in our terms of<br />
trade. Our export earnings, in terms of value per unit,<br />
price per unit, have tended to decline, Our import prices<br />
have tended to rise and in the result, the termis of trade<br />
have moved steadily against the primary-produacing and exporting<br />
countries and, of course, steadily in favour of the highly--<br />
industrialised countries of the Old ' 1orld TLhis is a<br />
reciprocal process in whiiich Great Britain derives a benefit<br />
we are not complaining about that but from which we derive<br />
a marked disodvantago And it's because of this decline in<br />
the terms of trade that a lot of the best minds in the world<br />
have been concentrating themselves on the prpbj. ems of producing<br />
a healthier international position in relation particularly to </p>
<p>primary products, to r eot some stability of price, to get some<br />
payable element in the price, to get sone stability of market<br />
and of opportunity of increasing access to whatever the market<br />
may be, This is tremendously important and a good deal of<br />
discussion occurred in London and indeed has been cccurring in<br />
the last week at Brussels in relation to international commodity<br />
agreements and as you know, Australia has been one of the<br />
pioneers in this agitation. It's tremendously important,<br />
I was down the other morning opening the Conference<br />
of the Colombo Plan ard there you had represented a great number<br />
of countries, new countries, some of which we had never heard of<br />
probably five years ago. The Colombo Plan provides money, and<br />
we have found substantial quantit. ies the United States of<br />
America immense quantities of money, but every now and then it<br />
is necessary to remind the donors particularly the donors of<br />
the great, powerful countries of % he dest, that an increase<br />
of a few per cent, in the prices of the articles or goods that<br />
these people produce would be worth more than all the direct<br />
cash aid put together, I think this truth is beginning to<br />
be realised, We found increasing realisation of it in London.<br />
I am certain that the President of the United States is<br />
intensely conscious of it Ilnow that and that he hopes<br />
that his new Trade Expansion legislation will enable him to<br />
make a contribution to this kind of thing by exercising his<br />
tariff powers to encourage a freer flow of international trade.<br />
But there it is the terms of trade the urgent<br />
importance, if the world is not to get completely out of balance,<br />
to have primary production in relatively unadvanced countries<br />
like some of those of South East Asia, in relatively advanced<br />
countries like Australia, but, in any case, in any country in<br />
which exports of primary products are of the essence of national<br />
solvency, able to develop or create expanding markets. There<br />
is the urgently important matter of international agreements<br />
which give effect to that desire, which provide for payable<br />
prices and which give some stability, without which you will<br />
have all the up and down and all the uncertainties and with<br />
those uncertainties of income, the periodical balance of<br />
payments crisis in Australia with drastic measures having to<br />
be taken, There is only one way in which we can get rid of<br />
these occasional emergency actions and that is to get a greater<br />
stability in our export earnings and if we can, then I believe<br />
that we can stabilize our costs and everything else in Australia<br />
much more satisfactorily, Now the Government, of course, will do what it<br />
can on this. I assure you this is a problem very close to<br />
our hearts, but it is essential if I may say so, that you<br />
should never let us forget about it and the right way for you<br />
not to let us forget about it is for you increasingly to<br />
concert among yourselves and with other organisations, united<br />
policies, because after all, though you will in a sense be<br />
pursuing your selfish interests, you will in a much truer<br />
sense be pursuing the best interests of the Australian nation.<br />
The other thing that I want to say to you which<br />
has a bearing on this point the reasons for these challenges<br />
that we have is that Australia is going through a period of<br />
most dynamic growth, and when a country is growing in population,<br />
growing in resources, it encounters all sorts of internal<br />
strains. I suppose they might be described as growing pains,<br />
Here we are with a large immigration programme. I've not met<br />
anybody who would abolish it. I think it is held all round / 3 </p>
<p>Australia to be of great value to this countryo We've all<br />
adhered, to a policy of full employment and I don't hear<br />
anybody today challenge the desirability of that, e adhere<br />
to a g: reat number of these broad national policies because<br />
we believe that these are the conditions of Australian growth<br />
and yet they are all fighting each other in a sense You<br />
can build up your cost structure by a migration movement<br />
which is not quickly absorbed into productive activity in<br />
the country; you can build up your cost structure and full<br />
employment becomes over-full employment with bidding up for<br />
scarce labour and a high rise in the costs of production in<br />
the metropolitan industries, You can have all these tensions,<br />
these difficulties. All I want to say to you is that this<br />
again presents a challenge. This is particularly perhaps a<br />
challenge to government the challenge to keep all of these<br />
great national objectives in balance so that you have your<br />
development of secondary industries and of tertiary industries<br />
without floating up the costs of the primary industries.<br />
Then you may have a full development of primary industries<br />
at effective prices without interfering rith some other<br />
aspect in the overall national programme. It isn't easy,<br />
but then nothing is easy that matters. The real task is to<br />
keep these things in balance.<br />
There are quite a lot of people in Australia<br />
who seo one oroblom and see no others, It's our job to see<br />
the lot and to keep all of these considerations in mind,<br />
But, living as we do in great cities like Canberra, we<br />
perhaps hear a little more of some aspects of this great<br />
naional problem than we do of others. And, therofore I<br />
come back, Sir, to what I said to you never be afraid to<br />
maintain pressure on the political mind, It's an age of<br />
pressure and I don't mind, I am an expert at receiving it.<br />
( Laught But 1 have9 from the very beginning, taken a<br />
groat interest in the National Farmers: Union and I hope<br />
that you will continue to realise, Sir, that my door is<br />
always open when you have views: that you want to put to me.<br />
I hope that your Conference will be very<br />
successful, I now declare it open. </p>
