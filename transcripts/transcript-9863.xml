SPEECH AT THE LAUNCH OF ANDREW THEOPHANOUS' BOOK<br />
" UNDERSTANDING MULTICULTURALISM AND AUSTRALIAN IDENTITY",<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 1 DECEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Well, thank you, very much indeed, William [ Albonj. Could I also<br />
acknowledge the High -Commissioner of Great Britain, other distinguished<br />
members of the diplomatic corps, Mr Rebikoff, Lois O'Donoghue and, of<br />
course, my Parliamentary colleagues, other distinguished guests, Andrew,<br />
and ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Well about this time every year, Andrew has a new book and it has become<br />
at least once In my itinerary/ agenda for the course of the year. I always say<br />
that within the year we had better put a day in, for Andrew will have another<br />
book and I am very happy to be here this morning to launch this one.<br />
It reminds me, I think, of two points. One is that there are people in the<br />
Labor Party the Labor Party is full of people who have all sorts of views<br />
about all sorts of things, are in the business of politics out ot conviction not<br />
convenience and you can see this just in this work, alone, that Andrew has<br />
done, how thoughtful he has been and how he thinks about Australia, thinks<br />
about the way In which it is changing and tries to write down and record and<br />
perhaps lead in the way in which Australian thought has changed and is<br />
changing. So it is a very interesting polemic he has written and the prodigious energy<br />
which he displays with these publications is, of course, quite profound. He is<br />
talking about, of course, the perhaps singular most defining feature of<br />
Australian society today and that is the impact of the post-war migration<br />
program on the cultural identity of the country and it is, we believe, a great<br />
success story. We don't presume it is a model for the rest of the world.<br />
But I think we are an example of a culturally pluralist society that works pretty<br />
well and in this text he is, I think, trying to tell the reader why he thinks it<br />
works well and to say that our whole process is informed by democratic<br />

is main theme, I think, is that multiculturalism is successful because of the<br />
strength of the nation's oldest values. That is egalitarianism, principally, the<br />
belief that everyone deserves a fair chance or a fair go and our deep-rooted<br />
sense of democracy and our basic tolerance, which comes from it, is the thing<br />
which has given people the psychological space to let multicultural ism work<br />
in a way that we have been able to draw strength from it.<br />
He says that rather than diluting Australia's culture, it has replenished it.<br />
Replenished it around the theme that the place is, essentially, deeply<br />
democratic and tolerant and egalitarian and that the influences of<br />
multiculturalism have, in fact, highlighted, sharpened, and replenished those<br />
Instincts. And that people have brought colour and ambition to Australia and<br />
that has generally supported the tendency we have all had to these<br />
democratic ideals and democratic traditions.<br />
And I think people coming particularly in the early phases from Europe,<br />
who have in the first instance, changed the nature of the culture of Australia<br />
have found when they have come here, particularly rent by two World Wars,<br />
that the opportunities for freedom in Australia where these values are bound<br />
and, also, in the sun because it is always easier, I think, to feel happy and<br />
free in a temperate climate, than one does rugged up under a grey sky.<br />
But the whole notion of you Know, you share in the bounty of the country<br />
whether you are wealthy or not, when you share in the pleasure of its<br />
environment. And, I think, all of that has produced a great view that amongst<br />
migrants and in the community that the multicultural ism that has arisen from it<br />
has truly replenished that which we have had here.<br />
Of course no policy of the Government, or no document, could make<br />
multiculturalism work. That has to come from the community itself. But a<br />
strong Government commitment to multiculturalism is necessary and it is that<br />
commitment which, I think, Andrew rejoices in in the Labor Party and I think<br />
that we enjoy as a Party with people in the community.<br />
Could I also say that in saying that I don't believe that multicultural ism must<br />
ever be allowed to become an Ideological position, a sort of repository of<br />
political correctness, or something beyond criticism. But certain things are<br />
beyond the pale, like a racial basis in discrimination of our immigration<br />
system, or discrimination against migrants in the workplace etc.<br />
But, I think, the theme that the Government has been perhaps touching in the<br />
last couple of years is our general embrace of multiculturalism, but. making<br />
clear that everybody's first loyalty has to be to Australia. That is, within the<br />
bounds of Australian democracy and egalitarianism, the things which Andrew<br />
argues is actually feeding and replenishing our culture, the inspiration of it<br />
has to be always that which the democracy is about. And that is the first<br />
loyalty to the society we have created here and our first loyalty to Australia<br />
and, of course, that Is most obviously expressed in the allegiance which the<br />
Government strongly encourages and that is, of course, taking Australian<br />
citizenship, which we are seeing, I think, as a growing tendency amongst<br />
people who have had permanent resident status. . u16 ' C </p>

Andrew's book sets out a narrative on the Government's recent advances<br />
the National Agenda for Multiculturalism, first released in 1989. The National<br />
Multicultural Advisory Council has reviewed the National Agenda for us and<br />
the Government will soon formally respond to their report. The Racial Hatred<br />
Legislation, commitment to access and equity principles, the platform on<br />
which multicultural ism has built itself which is social justice, he refers to this<br />
and he says that the very essence of social justice are the things that hold the<br />
egalitarian notions together. Hence, the underpinnings of multicultural ism<br />
and he goes through some of the elements of it Medicare, education and<br />
training, superannuation for everybody, and in the broader, of course, the<br />
Native Title Legislation which brings into the social justice equation more<br />
obviously, of course, the first Australians.<br />
Now, these are all things which, I think, that we see as a matrix, as threads of<br />
a fabric. That is, it is not just about the Migration Program. It is not just about<br />
a separate cultural identification with the countries of origin of people. But it<br />
is about a bigger thing that they can identity these historic interests with the<br />
new-found, in the case of those who arrived as migrants, freedom and<br />
democracy here which is itself fed by a long egalitarian tradition, which is<br />
itself supported by social justice and social justice policies.<br />
And so while these things might seem to be in the realm of social policy, they<br />
are In fact part of community policy. These are points we often make of our<br />
opponents, wearily, about things such as Medicare, education and training<br />
because education is the great boundary jumper. It is the place where<br />
people skip through the stratumns and when only three children in ten<br />
completed secondary school ten years ago, you can bet that most of the<br />
seven of the ten, of course, represented preponderantly those of lower<br />
incomes and disadvantaged groups.<br />
Now, of course, this year that is eight in ten completing secondary school and<br />
we have had now a 60 per cent addition to tertiary places and an enormous<br />
revolution In vocational education. So that where once only 40 per cent of<br />
people were trained after secondary school 60 per cent cascading into,<br />
essentially, a labour market within which they were not equipped with skills<br />
will have now the great bulk of the community, 90 per cent odd, coming into a<br />
training situation post-secondary training.<br />
And that is not a statement about education, it is a statement about your<br />
society, It is a statement about mobility, it is a statement about the brightest<br />
people being chosen on their abilities from within the education system rather<br />
than their parents income or their parents social position. All of this has, of<br />
course, made it likely that the children of migrants take a greater role in the<br />
society. So, giving people universal protection against sickness which is not a market<br />
matter your well being should not be a matter for the market place<br />
education, training, the right to a decent income in retirement so that the<br />
Commonwealth's tax concessions are equitably drawn down, all of these<br />
things we think In the Labor Party buttress a whole notion of society and<br />
buttress the notion of multiculturalism. </p>

Now, you know, it is rare for me these days in a public address to ever let the<br />
Coalition off and I'm not going to do it today either. I just wanted to say a<br />
couple of things about them because there is a lot to say about them even<br />
though they don't say much, there is still a lot to say about them.<br />
We found something that goes to this subject. It is a report which Senator<br />
Short the Shadow Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs had<br />
commissioned by Mr Zachary Wilks of the University of Michigan. The<br />
document is entitled ' Building Australia's Future. An Evaluation of Settlement<br />
Services Prepared for the Office of Senator Jim Short, Shadow Minister for<br />
Immigration and Ethnic Affairs'. In his covering letter to select migrant and<br />
ethnic groups Senator Short states that this paper " is Mr Wilks' personal view<br />
and does not represent a Coalition position." However, it is a document that<br />
makes clear it is a research document prepared for, by and with the active<br />
co-operation of Senator Short and his office and it carries hence his<br />
imprimatur, It has been distributed officially by him at public expense. It says<br />
" The Coalition is currently reviewing several important matters in the areas of<br />
multicultural affairs and settlement services I would appreciate hearing<br />
from you on the topics identified",<br />
Should the Coalition win the next election, I'm sure this officially sanctioned<br />
circulated paper would no doubt be used by a Howard government as some<br />
sort of mandate for adopting the radical changes it recommends. I'll give you<br />
a little taste of just a couple of pieces of it.<br />
It says all business and skilled entrants including concessional family<br />
entrants who are in a skill assessed class should be required to have English<br />
as a precondition of entry. Without English ability their skills or business<br />
acumen are virtually worthless in and to Australia Well, of course, bad<br />
luck for Peter Abeles and Frank Lowy and Frank Belgiorno-Nettis. They<br />
wouldn't have made the grade on that basis.<br />
Then it goes on if they do not attend the courses or obtain English<br />
elsewhere then they should be denied access to welfare benefits. In the<br />
future their sponsors should bear their living costs In other words, If they<br />
don't attend courses and are trained proficiently in English they shouldn't get<br />
welfare benefits and their sponsors should be reminded they will have to<br />
carry the costs.<br />
It is so friendly. And it goes on to say this migrants without English ability<br />
including humanitarian and refugee entrants in particular should be required<br />
to undertake English language courses as a priority for settlement. They<br />
should continue to receive financial assistance while they are undertaking<br />
these courses. However, if they fail to attend class or drop out prematurely,<br />
they should not be eligible for future unemployment assistance unless they<br />
have obtained English either through the courses or elsewhere It is a<br />
hard world Mr Howard has in mind for the rest of us.<br />
1 wish Margaret Thatcher had come to Canberra recently. She could have<br />
endorsed Johnny as well as Jeff. She would have endorsed this for sure. </p>

if all else fails the Government may have to look at more prescriptive<br />
methods to ensure migrants obtain sufficient English skills so they can fully<br />
participate in society and are not at risk or impost to either themselves or the<br />
community. Such a proposal could involve proficiency certificates that would<br />
be awarded by accredited English programs and presented when applying for<br />
a job Here Is a little rub employers who fail to check for the certificates<br />
could be made subject to fines You see, all those nasty employers out<br />
there employing people who don't speak fluent English.<br />
Anyway, it goes on, there is pages and pages of it. I won't bore you with it. It<br />
is just typical of the Coalition's snaky approach to multicultural ism. One of<br />
the things I have said to Alexander Downer was multicultural ism is more than<br />
heading for the nearest Chinese restaurant. It Is more than chasing a<br />
meatball around a plate with a pair of chop sticks which is what he did on his<br />
foray to a Chinese restaurant in my electorate.<br />
In the Labor Party, of course, proficiency with chop sticks comes at the age of<br />
16. In the Liberal Party it comes at about 42 or 43 years of age, but by then<br />
the capacity for dexterity is long past. So, they never quite make it, there is<br />
certainly no accreditation in their youth. But, I don't know whether these<br />
things have ever occurred to our friends in the Coalition. At any rate, they<br />
don't have a view that we have, that the thing that multiculturalism has done<br />
has been to enlarge Australia, to make it bigger and to make it better, to<br />
make it more interesting, to make it more resilient and to do, as Andrew has<br />
suggested, replenish those basic instincts of egalitarianism and democracy.<br />
In that sense, as people live their lives here, as their children grow up here,<br />
the culture of Australia has changed to a newer identity. But one which is<br />
uniquely Australian is that which some of the rest of us might have identified<br />
or 40 or 50 years ago and indeed given our place in the world, our<br />
proximity to large, old societies like Indonesia, very old societies like Papua<br />
New Guinea and our proximity also to the fastest growing markets in the<br />
world. The change to Australia is one that in our cultural diversity is not just a<br />
social strength, but a strength in approaching these markets and being part of<br />
the community and region in a way we might not have conceived before.<br />
I have made the point and Andrew makes it well here, that you can't ever<br />
really be thinking about a society at peace with itself, comfortable with the<br />
changing nature of its culture and its identity without, of course,<br />
understanding that the people who must feel comfortable in this are our<br />
Indigenes. It is going to take a long time before the Australian indigenes feel<br />
comfortable with Australia, the way it is now, but I think we have made as<br />
strong a renewal of our efforts to that as perhaps any government has,<br />
certainly in recent years and we are going to keep that commitment up.<br />
But, you can't say that the place is open and fair and democratic if one<br />
Important and key section is excluded from opportunity or where the barriers<br />
to participation are too great. </p>

So, that is why that happy mix of social policy runs with the whole current of<br />
our society and it is why too, with a republic that in renouncing a European<br />
monarch as our head of state, we would have made that affirmation of the<br />
way in which we have changed and to say to all the people who have joined<br />
us that they are more likely to be and more welcome in being an integral part<br />
of society which they volunteered to belong to.<br />
I think we in the Party owe Andrew a debt for getting this down because<br />
debates come and go and the plasma of the debates exist at the time but<br />
then they disappear and you try to remember what debates were like<br />
years ago or 20 years ago and you can remember the highlights, but you<br />
don't remember the flux and I think what this text does is put that down. It<br />
puts all of the issues down, it gives us the threads of the debate and records<br />
this quite distinctive, defining change in our history. For that we thank<br />
Andrew and it is therefore with great pleasure that I officially launch his text.<br />
