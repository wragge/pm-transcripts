SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P4J KEATING, MP<br />
LAUNCH OF THE JUSTICE $ TATEMENT<br />
BRISBANE 18 MAY 1995<br />
Today it Is my privilege to launch the Commonwealth Government's Justice<br />
Statement a $ 160 million program of reforms to improve our justice system and<br />
make Australia a more equitable, democratic arnd just society.<br />
It is another practical demonstration of the Commonwealth Govemmenfs belief<br />
that Australia will be stronger and a better place In which to live if all Australians<br />
are able to share In the benefits of this democracy and, equally, share a faith In<br />
the ideas and values on which that democracy is built.<br />
The Justice Statement outlineS action the Government will take right across the<br />
legal system.-to reduce ctime, protect consumers, reinforce human rights, sImplify<br />
legislation, improve legal aid serVices and make the resolution of disputes outside<br />
the legal system a practical alternative to legal proceedings.<br />
In launching this Statement today I will concentrate on some of the measures to<br />
achieve our three main objectives for reform.<br />
The first objective is to bring justice to people, not people to lawyers.<br />
We want to help people resolve their problems before they get caught up in legal<br />
action. Many Australians first encounter the legal system in the difficult and stressful<br />
circumstances which almost invariably surround proceedings in Family Law.<br />
We will substantially increase funding for those family support services that help<br />
families through difficult times and, wherever possible, stay together.<br />
With the right support, many families are able to resolve ' their problems without<br />
legal intervention and its financial and emotional costs. </p>
<p>TEL: 17. ay. 15 INU. ULL<br />
2<br />
In doing this, we will also enable the courts to deal more Promptly with those<br />
cases which cannot be resolved by othor means.<br />
In total, we will provide $ 54 million over four year* for the expansion of family<br />
services throughout Australia: services which have been shown to help couples<br />
enter reletionships witrn a oetter understanding of the oommitment they are<br />
making, and families to work through protbleMS which May arise over the years.<br />
We will doUble the iurnber or marriage and relationship courses, piovide a~ 50 pidl<br />
cent Increase in family skills training, and " rate up to 20 new financial<br />
Counselling services. The Family Court's counselling services will be increased<br />
by 25 por oent andi more then 15,000 additional people each year will be assisted<br />
by family mediation.<br />
We will specifically extend these programs to assist families in regional and rural<br />
a reas.<br />
The Guvivinnint will also allocate an additional $ 2.4 million over tour years to<br />
improve the way family support services deal with family violence. We know from<br />
consultations with women in the communit that violence and fear of violence are<br />
pr~ ority Issues.<br />
One of the aims of the now funding will be to rind ways of preventing relationships<br />
beomn violent. But Staff Will also be trained in the best methods of responding<br />
to family violence, innClUdng the means by which they can help women who want<br />
to leave a violent relationship, or people living In violent circumstances who want<br />
the relationship to continue but the violence to stop.<br />
Our strategy Is also geared to provide families with the means to resolve disputes<br />
outside the formal proceose3 of the courts.<br />
Aiternative proceses, such as mediation, have Increasingly proved to be<br />
effective means of dealing with family breakdowns.<br />
R'ecause mediation glvpq ppople a greater stay In Mhe dacdqlons whirh affism their<br />
lives, the results are more likely to be acceptea and more likely to endure,<br />
We will encourage the shift from litigation to mediation by increasing the numbier<br />
of family mediators and funding the establshmient of new community mediation<br />
services around Australia,<br />
Alternative means, however, are sometimes inappropriate -for example, in<br />
disputes where there is Inequality or bargaining between the parties or where<br />
there Is a history of domestic violence, The Government will fund the Family<br />
Court to train mediators and counsellors in ways which will -enable them to<br />
recognise situations which demand resort to the legal system. r UZ/ V( </p>
<p>TEL 3<br />
As part of our objective to bring justice to the people we have developed ' Safer<br />
Australia', a national strategy to reduce crime and build Safer communities.<br />
Crime has debilitating, often devastating. effects on families and local<br />
communities. It carries significant social and economic costs.<br />
Although the State and Territory governments have primary responsibility for law<br />
and order, the national government can play a role where it is appropriate to its<br />
functions in the task of providing a secure environment for Australians.<br />
We will continue working with the States and Territories on issues such as gun<br />
control. We will tighten Australia's already stringent gun importation restrictions<br />
and ban the importation of handguns that can be adapted to duplicate machine<br />
guns. We will also provide $ 1.2 million over four years for community surveys to identify<br />
problem areas and develop responses to reduce crime. We will support local<br />
pilot projects which may make communities safer, such as improved lighting in<br />
public areas and better safety and surveillance In car parks and public transport<br />
centres. We will provide $ 2.8 million over four years to test local cdme reduction<br />
measures that will have application elsewhere In Australia.<br />
The second main objective of the Govemment's justice strategy is to ensure that<br />
Australians have access to legal services which are affordable and responsive to<br />
their needs and circumstances.<br />
As a first step, the legal aid system will be reformed.<br />
It was the Whitiamr Labor Government 20 years ago which first recognised the<br />
Importance of comprehensive legal aid arrangements.<br />
Through our funding of legal aid commissions and community legal centres, the<br />
Commonwealth remains the major source of funding for community legal<br />
assistance and the initiatives In the Statement reinforce that position.<br />
But despite its level of financial contribution, the Commonwealth has had little say<br />
in the distribution of the legal aid dollar.<br />
This will change.<br />
It is our view that the Commonwealth has an important role to play in ensuring<br />
national consistency in the delivery of legal aid services. T1EL.: May. 95 22: 35 No. 022 P. 06/ U( </p>
<p>TEL 4<br />
Uniform eligibility criteria, Uhflhormf performance measures and best practice<br />
principles will be developed to provide. as far as poSSie, equal acress to legal<br />
aid, regardless of where people live.<br />
An Australian 10901 Assistance Bonrd will be established to coordinate legal aid<br />
planning and policy and increase access end equity.<br />
We will also provide a total of $ 24 million over four years to Increase legal aid<br />
. qprviceA~<br />
At present there Is an Italance In legal aid funding. Criminal law cases currently<br />
absorb the major proportiori of the budget. While the Government agrees that<br />
anyone accused of a 6erious criminal matter needs legal representation, other<br />
legal problems can have different, but equally -serous, consequences for the<br />
people concerncd, For instance, women seeking protection from violence may<br />
be in grave danger, and unemployed workers may faco eviction proceedings, and<br />
yet not have access to legal assistan'ce.<br />
Over the next four years, Thp Government will provide an 2dditional $ 16.8 million<br />
to legal aid commissions to provide more ASSISncA In fgamily law and civil law<br />
111tturs. Traditionally, legal aid has provided assistance for the most needy inOiw ui ty.<br />
But many other Australians cannot afford private legal advice and representation.<br />
Contingency fees offer one solution, Under thcso arrongements, in cases where<br />
there Is a prospoct of an award of money, law~ yers provide their services with<br />
payment contingent on a successful outcome.<br />
But even when lawyers offer their services on a contingency basis, other uip-front<br />
tfe ofteni have to be met by the client In order to take legal action, * Such as those<br />
for expert witnesses arid medical reports. Those di.% buiserrierit costs can be<br />
prohibitively expensive.<br />
The Government will set up a $ 10.5 million National Disbursements Assistance<br />
Fund to moot the up-front costs of litigation where lawyers are acting on a<br />
contingency or no fee basis. These disbursements will only have to bo repaid if<br />
the client wins the tAse.<br />
WO knoQw tildt worirluriity legal centres are a cost effective and well-accepted<br />
method of providingj help to thousands of Australians.<br />
The centres are In touch with the needs of the local communities in which they<br />
operate, and provide assistance on a varioty of legal issues, including credit<br />
2dvice, family low, child support and social security matters. T1EL7:. May.' 95 22: 35 No. U22 IV. UL4/ u( </p>
<p>TEL: ar. ic.<br />
This Statement Provides a doubling of funding for Community legal centres, with<br />
an additional $ 30 mill ion over four years.<br />
Nine new community legal services will be established in high growth urban and<br />
regional locations.<br />
In a major new initiative, the Government will establish the National Women's<br />
Justice Strategy to redress the inequities women face In obtaining access to<br />
justice, The strategy will be part of the expanded community legal centres program. Its<br />
centrepiece will be a national network of women's legal centres,<br />
At least one specialist women's legal centre will be established to servie the<br />
needs of women in every State and Territory.<br />
The centres will provide advice through an Australia-w~ de toll free telephone<br />
service. The centres will also be given funding to cater for the needs of<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, the least well-served by the justice<br />
system; and outreach services will be provided for women in rural and remote<br />
areas. The third objective of the Government's justice strategy is to reform the legal<br />
profession, courts and tribunals to make them more accountable and accessible.<br />
Reducing the costs of legal services and promoting a greater consumer focus will<br />
increase access to justice.<br />
Competition reduces costs. And competition is coming to the legal profession.<br />
Last month, the Commonwealth and the States reached an historic agreement on<br />
the implementation of a national competition policy. The policy will apply to all<br />
professions. It will ensure consumers in the legal market enjoy the same<br />
protection as people in other sectors. Unnecessary regulation will be removed<br />
and a more competitive and accountable legal profession created. Consumers<br />
will have greater choice and lawyers will have greater flexibility to meet consumer<br />
needs. Lawyers will benefit from these reforms through the creation of a genuine national<br />
market in legal services so that qualified lawyers can practise freely anywhere In<br />
Australia. But more needs to be done. ~ 05 00: 5 Wo 0F22 P. 05/ 07 </p>
<p>TEL' 17. May. 95 22: 35 No. 022 F. uU/ Uv<br />

While the Commonwealth's constitutional power to regulate the legal profession is<br />
limited, the Government will take action in areas that are within its power to<br />
provide better services for consumers.<br />
We will require lawyers acting In Federal matters to disclose to clients the likely<br />
costs of legal action, and canvass with them the possibility of alternative<br />
procedures. We will overhaul the fee scales that apply In Federal courts with a view to<br />
developing a simpler structure and more accurate charging rates.<br />
The Government will work with the States and the profession to accelerate<br />
reform, but we will not hesitate to act if reforms are delayed.<br />
If the States do not do so, we will legislate to permit contingency fees in Federal<br />
matters, other than family and criminal law, and we will Introduce legislation to<br />
permit advertising by lawyers.<br />
The Government is also working to improve the operation of our courts and<br />
tibunals. Justice Is not well served if people do not understand what happens in<br />
our courts or have difficulty using them.<br />
A t the Justice Forum held last year I expressed an interest in the creation of<br />
charters for courts which would set out the standards of access and service which<br />
people can expect In courts and how they might be treated,<br />
I am pleased that the courts are keen to take up this idea, and we will be<br />
supporting their Initiative with funding.<br />
We will also provide funds to develop facilities in our courts which cater for the<br />
needs of people with a disebility and people caring for children.<br />
The Justice Statement also addresses deficiencies which have been Identified<br />
within our courts, particularly in the Family Court,<br />
Extra staff will be provided to the Family Court to deal with Its current backlog of<br />
Cases and handle peak case loads. Additional funding will be provided to<br />
increase Family Court services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.<br />
And we will fund an expansion of court translatino and interpreting ocrvices, to<br />
etboth Indigenous peoples and people of non-English speaking backgrounds.<br />
We will al~ so provide funding for professional development courses for judges,<br />
focusing on Issues such as gender and cross-cultural awareness. </p>
<p>TEL: 17. May. 95 22: 35 No .022 P. 07/ 07<br />
7<br />
This statement concerns Australian justice and the Australian people. it is 8<br />
Justice statement and a comprehensive one but it goes much further than that.<br />
It we can create a justice system which is simpler, cheaper and more accessible<br />
we will extend our democracy and strengthen belief in it; we will increase respect<br />
for our laws and the ideas and principles on which they are based. This Justice<br />
Statement Is an Investment in Australian democracy.<br />
It Is also an investment in the quality of Australian life. If we can reduce crime,<br />
find solutions to domestic violence and family breakdowns, and mitigate the<br />
trauma which accompanies these tragedies, Australian communities will be better<br />
places In which to live and work and raise children,<br />
That Is the bottom line of this justice statement-in the end our legal system is<br />
much less about the traditions, -symbols and Institutions of the law grand as they<br />
may be than it is about providing a safe and secure environment for all<br />
Australians. There can scarcely be a better means of encouraging trust in the law and faith in<br />
Australian democracy. </p>
