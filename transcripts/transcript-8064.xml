TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH RANALD MCDONALD, RADIO<br />
JULY 1990<br />
MCDONALD: Good morning, Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Good morning.<br />
MCDONALD: I won't go through my introduction again, but<br />
anyway I could, of course, want to talk to you about the<br />
speech you made to the National Press Club yesterday.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
MCDONALD: Now you say there should be uniformed<br />
supervision of the non-bank deposit taking institutions,<br />
as is obviously important to Victoria, how do you see the<br />
State and Federal roles in this?<br />
PM: Well I said, very simply, that we will include this<br />
item now in the lead up to the first Premiers' Conference<br />
that I've scheduled for the end of October. We'll have<br />
work done between the Commonwealth and the States leading<br />
up to that and the aim will be to try and arrive at an<br />
agreed approach on this matter so that we can satisfy the<br />
two criteria of effectiveness of supervision and<br />
uniformity. Now that would mean that, as a result of<br />
cooperation between the States and the Commonwealth, we<br />
could see instituted in every State, a system which would<br />
be seen as effective in supervising the operations of the<br />
deposit taking non-bank financial institutions, with the<br />
responsibility for that supervision remaining with the<br />
States because, as I said yesterday, Ranald, there is<br />
simply a vast myriad of these deposit taking non-bank<br />
institutions around the country and that some of them are<br />
very, very tiny and it wouldn't be appropriate to have a<br />
centralised actual supervision, but what is appropriate<br />
that the supervision that does exist, as I say, be<br />
effective and be uniform.<br />
MCDONALD: You use the word remaining, so quite clearly<br />
responsibility lies with the States currently?<br />
PM: It does as a matter of law and of the Constitution.<br />
MCDONALD: Alright. Let's look at your overall approach<br />
to what has been dubbed the new federalism. You use the<br />
word achievable, you therefore clearly have-not--gone--to--</p>
<p>the absolute total solution of rewriting the<br />
Constitution? PM: Well, no because we live in the real world. I mean,<br />
I'm neither dictator nor a person who has such ambitions<br />
to be a dictator. We have to operate within the system<br />
that we have and therefore what I've set out in<br />
yesterday's speech is a series of processes which can<br />
achieve effective reform and essentially those processes<br />
are in two parts. One is to do with the working within<br />
the Constitution as it stands and I have now invited the<br />
States to set up, appoint a representative to meet with<br />
the Secretary of my Department, Mr Codd, which will<br />
prepare papers leading up to the October special<br />
Premiers' Conference that I have called and I've set up<br />
in my own Department now a high level unit under Helen<br />
Williams which will have ongoing responsibility. Now<br />
this process is directed towards getting an agenda which<br />
will identify the areas of duplication and overlap which<br />
exist between the levels of Government in the delivery of<br />
services to citizens and to say well, is there a better<br />
way in respect of each of these areas for the delivery of<br />
these services. In some cases, Ranald, that would mean<br />
conceivably, the Commonwealth getting out and giving it<br />
over to the States and perhaps with financial<br />
compensation. In other areas it may mean the reverse<br />
the States would agree that there's some things that we<br />
may do better from the centre, but the aim in every<br />
respect, the criterion is the better, more efficient<br />
delivery of services to the citizens. So that's that<br />
category. The second category of process is in regard to<br />
possible reform of the Constitution itself and here I've<br />
pointed out to our history where we have an abominably<br />
poor record in achieving Constitutional change, basically<br />
because they've always been in the context of partisan<br />
controversy. So what I'm proposing, starting in<br />
March/ April of next year when we'll have the centenary of<br />
the first Federation Convention in Sydney in March/ April<br />
1891, that we will then together, governments,<br />
oppositions and non-government people, sit down and try<br />
and work out areas of agreement that we can put to the<br />
people by way of referendum.<br />
MCDONALD: And you suggest that now is, for all sorts of<br />
reasons, the best time to bring about such a major<br />
change. Are you really being specific about why?<br />
PM: Well, yes. We are now at the beginning of the last<br />
decade of this first century of the Federation and, as a<br />
keen student of history, I'm very much aware of the fact<br />
that it took the last decade of the 1890s to forge the<br />
Constitutional instrument which created the nation of<br />
Australia. It's a fascinating thing to do, Ranald, to<br />
read through, as I have done, the actual record of the<br />
debates of those three Conventions. The first was in<br />
Sydney in 1891, was followed then by the 1897 Convention<br />
in Adelaide and then the third Convention in Melbourne in<br />
1898 and it was a fairly tortuous process. I mean, for </p>
<p>A 3<br />
instance, you may be interested, your listeners may<br />
be, on one of the heads of power in the Commonwealth<br />
Constitution, the one which gives the power to have<br />
conciliation and arbitration, at the first Convention in<br />
Sydney in 1891, that proposal was debated and its<br />
inclusion in the Constitution was defeated by a vote of<br />
to 12. In 1897 they debated it again and it was<br />
defeated by a vote of 22 to 12 and it was only then, at<br />
the last Convention, that it got in and a change of two<br />
votes would have left it out entirely. So, it was a<br />
long, tortuous process because various interests are<br />
involved. So the reason now in part is to say, well<br />
we're now at the beginning of this last decade, let's<br />
commit ourselves as we come up to that centenary of<br />
Federation on the first of January 2001, let's commence<br />
now a decade of commitment to changing the relationships<br />
between the States, but in the Constitution as it stands,<br />
but also direct ourselves to the proposal to try and make<br />
the Constitution itself as relevant as it possibly can be<br />
to what is going to be a tough, competitive, demanding<br />
21st century.<br />
McDONALD: Well of course also it requires the<br />
co-operation of State Premiers, the Opposition and<br />
whatever and without bringing an unpleasant note into it,<br />
presumably it's easier without a Joh Bjelke-Petersen or<br />
Robin Gray. I mean you have a situation where you might<br />
have a chance of support from the State Premiers don't<br />
you? PM: Without making any reflection on the two gentlemen<br />
to whom you've referred I think it is true as I said<br />
yesterday at the National Press Club, that we've never<br />
had a more congenial propitious set of circumstances than<br />
we've got now. And it's not simply the fact that the<br />
majority of State Premiers are of my political<br />
persuasion, because I've paid proper credit to Nick<br />
Greiner, the Liberal Premier of New South Wales,<br />
yesterday. Because I must in all fairness say that Nick<br />
Greiner has been very open and constructive in his<br />
approach to this issue. So we've got leaders of calibre<br />
around Australia now. People who I think do have an<br />
understanding and share with me a vision of what<br />
Australia needs to be if its going to face up to the<br />
challenges of the next century. So the times are good.<br />
McDONALD: Now what about the position of local<br />
governments. It's mainly concentrated on Federal and<br />
State relationships. What about local.<br />
PM: I've taken that into account and indeed in the<br />
letter which I sent yesterday to the Premiers I indicated<br />
that I had written to the Chairman of the Local<br />
Government Association with a view to having the Local<br />
Government Organisation represented at the Premiers'<br />
Conference that I've called now for the end of October.<br />
So that they will be able to participate in those items<br />
which were of direct relevance to them. The reality is, </p>
<p>and I'm glad you went to this question, the reality is we<br />
have three tiers of government in this country. The<br />
publicity is nearly always either upon us at the Federal<br />
level or at the States. But we tend to forget, those of<br />
us who are engaged in those two levels of politics and<br />
commentators tend to forget that in a day to day sense of<br />
our Australian citizens, local government has a<br />
continuing impact upon them and a continuing relevance.<br />
So we have to make sure that in our talk about<br />
re-equipping ourselves for the challenges of the future<br />
that local government is brought into it.<br />
McDONALD: Well let's say we reach agreement and there's<br />
a system of real co-operation between the three tiers,<br />
what actually happens then to make it law?<br />
PM: Well there are some things that won't require a<br />
change of law but rather a change of practice and<br />
procedures. For instance in the area of program delivery<br />
it may simply be a decision, for example, that in a<br />
particular area we will say to the States, well we think<br />
there's certain national standards that ought to be<br />
operative and if we can get agreement on those sort of<br />
concepts then the actual delivery of particular services<br />
can be handed exclusively over to the States. Now that<br />
won't requir necessarily a new piece of legislation. In<br />
some cases it will. But where it requires legislation<br />
that would be a matter of a change of the law by us, we<br />
would change our law and the States would reflect that in<br />
their own legislation. But in many areas it would simply<br />
be a decision taken executively which would then be<br />
administered by the States. Now of course that category,<br />
where we are talking about the better integration of<br />
services, the better delivery of services. Now of course<br />
if you take a matter like transport. Now this is one of<br />
the big areas of challenge as I referred yesterday to the<br />
issue of rail. Now what we've got to do and what we're<br />
about already is States and the Commonwealth trying to<br />
have a national rail freight initiative. Now in that<br />
area what we want to do is to try and reduce the<br />
impediments to commerce that currently exist by the<br />
division of authority, not merely the physical division<br />
of three difference guages, but the division of authority<br />
in this area. Now there, there may be some change in<br />
legislation required.<br />
McDONALD: And what about a referendum? Because<br />
presumably-PM: Well a referendum in that area, yes. If you're<br />
actually going to, in that second category of my concern<br />
of changing the Constitution, that of course is a matter<br />
of law and that would require these stages. Firstly, in<br />
the convention, the first of which will be held in March<br />
or April next year, will be April I would think of next<br />
year, which will I repeat, not be simply governments and<br />
opposition represented but academics and institutions<br />
represented. There we would try and get agreement as to </p>
<p>an issue. Now the example I gave yesterday was the four<br />
year term. I doubt very much if there is anyone of<br />
significance who questions that it would be for better<br />
governments of this country to have four year terms<br />
rather than three. Now what we've got to do is to try<br />
and talk through issues like that, get bipartisan<br />
agreement and then of course the legal processes are that<br />
we at the Federal level then put a law through the<br />
Federal Parliament proposing a change of the<br />
Constitution. And that is then put to the people.<br />
McDONALD: So there would be one referendum.<br />
PM: Well, let me make this point. I said yesterday I<br />
don't want to see one long drawn out year's long process<br />
to come up with some voluminous report at the end which<br />
then deals with a whole compendium of decisions. What I<br />
want to see is a series of decisions. Both in the first<br />
area of administrative arrangements between the<br />
Commonwealth and States but also in this area. I think<br />
for instance the four year term referendum should go to<br />
the people at the next Federal election. There may be<br />
other areas of constitutional reform which are more<br />
complex, will take perhaps some years to talk through so<br />
that we would in some senses, may replicate the last<br />
decade of the 1890' s so that it will be a series of<br />
constitutional changes over this period.<br />
McDONALD: In a way that represents the sort of best of a<br />
system of the community taking part, decision by<br />
decision, rather than being presented with one package.<br />
PM: Oh yes. I think if there's one thing we learn from<br />
history and it's in two parts, but firstly that<br />
constitutional change is very difficult to achieve in<br />
this country. That's the first thing, an obvious lesson<br />
we learn from history. And the sub lesson from that is<br />
that they don't like packages very much. But underlying<br />
all that is the most important lesson of all. And that<br />
is that if we can get bipartisan agreement then you can<br />
get change. I mean the most recent example of that was<br />
back in the sixties when on a bipartisan basis power over<br />
Aboriginal affairs was put into the hands of the<br />
Commonwealth and with the government, the then<br />
conservative government of the day, supported by the<br />
Labor opposition an overwhelming majority in the<br />
States for this change.<br />
McDONALD: Yes. All right Prime Minister many thanks for<br />
talking to us this morning.<br />
PM: It's been my pleasure Ranald, thank you very much<br />
indeed.<br />
