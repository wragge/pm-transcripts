PRIME MINISBTE<br />
FOR MEDIA 14 JANUARY 1991<br />
The Australian Government deplores the Soviet<br />
Government's use of force over recent days in Vilnius,<br />
the capital of Lithuania.<br />
The use of force is inconsistent with President<br />
Gorbachev's past emphasis on seeking a peaceful and<br />
negotiated resolution to the question of Baltic<br />
independence. The Soviet military's actions in Lithuania threaten to<br />
undermine the more favourable attitude of Western<br />
countries towards the Soviet Union since the reform<br />
process began. They have the potential to affect the<br />
future course of co-operation between East and West.<br />
Australia does not recognise under international law the<br />
incorporation of the Baltic States in the Soviet Union.<br />
The aspiration of Lithuania and the other Baltic States<br />
for independence has been clearly reaffirmed by their<br />
democratically elected Parliaments. The resort to force<br />
fails to acknowledge the fundamental democratic mandate<br />
of the Lithuanian Government and Parliament. Resolution<br />
of the status of the Baltic States is a complex matter,<br />
but the use of force will be not produce a viable<br />
solution. I urge the Soviet Government to reconsider its despatch<br />
of additional military forces to the Lithuanian capital.<br />
I urge the Soviet authorities to exercise restraint, so<br />
that an already delicate situation is not worsened.<br />
The Australian Government will be carefully watching<br />
future developments in Lithuania, in the hope that the<br />
tragedy which appears to be in the making can be avoided<br />
and peaceful dialogue restored.<br />
We are registering our deep concern about developments in<br />
Lithuania with the Soviet Government. I have asked Dr<br />
Blewett to call in the Soviet Ambassador this afternoon<br />
to make these points. </p>
