SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATINGO, MP<br />
INAUGURAL FORUM OF THE COALITION OF AUSTRALIAN PARTICIPATING<br />
ORGANISATIONS OF WOMEN ( CAPOWI)<br />
It was with great pleasure that I accepted your invitation<br />
to participate in today's seminar.<br />
I have some important announcements to make concerning the<br />
subject of this seminar, Australia's landmark antidiscrimination<br />
legislation, the Sax Discrimination Act.<br />
I will also announce changes to our Affirmative Action<br />
legiglation. It would be hard to think of a better occasion to make these<br />
announcements than the first event organised by Australia's<br />
first coalition of women's organisations, called<br />
appropriately enough CAPOW!<br />
I am informed that CAPOW! aims to Increase communication and<br />
cooperation between Australia's leading women's<br />
organisations. Some twenty national women's organisations have indicated a<br />
wil. lingness to participate in the coalition when issues<br />
arise that concern their memberships.<br />
This is an important new development in the political<br />
evolution of women's groups in this country and r wish the<br />
coalition every success.<br />
I am very happy to be associated with your first public<br />
event. I understand that six organisations participated in<br />
arranging today's forum, among them such long-standing </p>
<p>2<br />
groups as the Women's Electoral Lobby, the-Australian<br />
~ e~ raft oBn sinss nd roessional Wom-en and the YWCA.-<br />
-Wendy Fatin, who assists me on Status of Women matters, was<br />
a founding member of WEL, and I know she was also involved<br />
In the formation of another of today's sponsors, the<br />
National Foundation for Australian Women.<br />
The remaining two groups involved today are the ' Australian<br />
_ WomeA'sHeLalt h __ Net -work and the National Woman's Housing<br />
Caucus, both examples of newer bodies representing community<br />
interests important to women.<br />
These are all groups with whom the Government has worked<br />
closely, both through the Office of the Status of -Women in<br />
my department, or through their periodic membership of the<br />
-National-Women'sConsultative Council.<br />
This partnership between women's organisations and the<br />
Government is important.<br />
It's important to us because we value your opinions and<br />
your advice.<br />
It's important to us because you help us communicate with<br />
women in the community, and because your policy skills and<br />
political hard work have contributed greatly to Australia's<br />
proud record in advancing the status of women.<br />
I hope it's important to you as well.<br />
I trust that you value the access this Government has<br />
accorded women's organisations in its policy making process,<br />
including representation at such important national<br />
gatherings as the 1985 Tax Summit and the recent Youth<br />
Summit, as well as your involvement in various advisory and<br />
consultative bodies.<br />
This partnership between women and government has evolved<br />
during the ten years of this Government.<br />
It is our way Labor's way of working with<br />
org anisat ions.<br />
It involves mutual trust and mutual respect and a genuine<br />
sharing of views.<br />
We don't always agree with one another, but at least we<br />
listen and we talk. It is a means of moving forward,<br />
together, towards our shared goals. </p>
<p>our partnership with you over the past decade has produced<br />
an unprecedented program of reform.<br />
integral to that program was the Sex Discrimination Act and<br />
the Affirmative Action legislation but before I move on to<br />
fay announcements in that area, I would like to take the<br />
opportunity you have given me today to share with you some<br />
of my own observations on the changing status of women.<br />
I am sometimes accused of being " urcntutd when it<br />
comes to the subject of women!<br />
Well perhaps in the past there was some truth to that, but I<br />
can assure you that no father of daughters these days can<br />
stay unreconstructed for long and I have three daughters!<br />
I watch them growing up and I worry for them sometimes, as I<br />
know tho world can still be rough on women.<br />
That alone would be sufficient motivation to do everything<br />
in my power to make the world a better place for women.<br />
But in fact my learning process started even before my girls<br />
came along.<br />
I have sisters too, and when I reflect back on when we were<br />
growing up I realise that I had advantages that were denied<br />
to them.<br />
I see now that that was unfair.<br />
I have learned, too, from the subsequent lives of some of<br />
the girls I went to school with. One in particular had a<br />
very hard time when her husband left her stranded with three<br />
little kids.<br />
I've also learned from women I have met in my capacity as a<br />
politician representing a suburban electorate west of<br />
Sydney. But I've done more than listen and learn I've acted.<br />
The media would have you thinking that I'm living testament<br />
to the joke that compares Australian men with Treasury bonds<br />
the difference being that Treasury bonds eventually<br />
mature! Well, as Treasurer, I did more than wait for bonds to<br />
mature! I am proud of what I was able to do of benefit to women. </p>
<p>As Susan Ryan _( who is here today) will tell you, I'm sure, I<br />
gave her support in the Cabinet room for the policies she<br />
brought forward including the sex discrimination<br />
legislation.<br />
My colleagues and I made sure we found the funds for<br />
programs like child-care a program which, I don't have to<br />
tell this audience, has expanded almost five-fold since<br />
Labor was elected.<br />
The one program where I did get directly involved and of<br />
which I am immensely proud is the Child Support Agency.<br />
I was instrumental in placing that Agency within the<br />
Australian Taxation Office which, I can tell you, was not<br />
exactly rapt in the idea back in 1988 when I proposed it.<br />
But they accepted the idea in the end and now can take the<br />
credit for overseeing one of the most effective methods in<br />
the worl of collecting child support from non-custodial<br />
parents. Since the Agency was established, we have gone from<br />
collecting maintenance payments from only 30 per cent of<br />
non-custodial parents to 70 per cent.<br />
And few things have given me greater pleasure in government<br />
than to see justice brought to these shirkers and for the<br />
women and children they left behind to be able to improve<br />
their standard of living through payments they are fully<br />
entitled to receive.<br />
During the past nine years there has been an Increase of<br />
million jobs, current unemployment levels notwithstanding.<br />
Women got 64 per cent of those jobs.<br />
Bill Kelty and I arranged for supplementary payments to go<br />
to low-paid workers the vast majority of whom are women,<br />
and the Minimum Rates Adjustment progress which saw childcare<br />
workers and others receive hefty and deserved<br />
increases. I backed the portability of award superannuation which saw<br />
women,, many for the first time in their working lives, able<br />
to save for their retirement and not be totally dependent on<br />
a husband's super.<br />
And there have been other innovative actions. </p>
<p>For instance, I appointed Anna Booth as the first woman<br />
member of the board of the Commonwealth Bank and Hylda Rolfe<br />
to chair the Prices Surveff-fance Authoriity.<br />
As Prime Minister I have reminded Ministers of the<br />
importance of appointing appropriately qualified women to<br />
major boards and authorities.<br />
Women now make up around 20 per cent of statutory and nonstatutory<br />
appointments.<br />
This is not a high number but it is an improvement on the<br />
1988 f igrure of only 12 per cent.<br />
We can do better than this and we will.<br />
I was very pleased a few weeks ago when my colleague the<br />
Treasurer, John Dawkins, announced the historic appointment<br />
of Janet Holmes a Court to the board of the Reserve Bank.<br />
Yet another milestone for women.<br />
Under my Government, there will be many more.<br />
I am proud to be part of a Government which has earned<br />
Australia a reputation world-wide for its progressive<br />
women's policies.<br />
Several months ago, I had the pleasure of presenting<br />
Australia's secondCE -DAW -Report to Mrs Mervat Tal la-wy,<br />
chairwoman of the UN Committee on the El-imination of<br />
Discrimination Against Women.<br />
During that presentation, Mrs Tallawy told me she considered<br />
Australia to be at the forefront of countries that had made<br />
major improvements in the status of women.<br />
Let me assure you today that my Government will continue<br />
those progressive policies.<br />
Even in the six months since I delivered the One Nation<br />
statement we have been able to build on the achievements of<br />
the 19809 and continue our programs of innovative change.<br />
In addition to our major infrastructure reforms, In road and<br />
in rail, in electricity and in aviation, we are continuing<br />
our economic and social reforms.<br />
The Superannuation Guarantee Levy, which will give lowincome<br />
women for the first time access to retirement _ income. </p>
<p>An extra 27,000 child-care places and an increase in fee<br />
relief to reduce child-care costs for 135,000 families.<br />
in health, major reforms to-Modicare, including $ 50 million<br />
this financial year to reduce waiting lists, and a further<br />
$ 1.23 billion over five years to improve access to public<br />
hospitals. in women's health, a major new program was recently<br />
finalised when 11l the States and Territories signed on.<br />
As my colleague the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for<br />
Health, Housing and Community Services, Brian Howe,<br />
announced earlier this week, 5 million Australian women will<br />
be covered by the cervical cancer program which will provide<br />
screening via pap sm; earsi every two years for all women aged<br />
between 18 and<br />
We announced a S93 million package of support and assistance<br />
for carers most of whom are women.<br />
I know only too well how valuable is their compassionate<br />
work in caring for elderly and disabled people.<br />
And much much more.<br />
Gone I hope forever are the days when women's<br />
contribution to the economy, and to society as a whole,<br />
could be ignored.<br />
Gone as far as this government is concerned are the days<br />
when women Is needs could be overlooked.<br />
The transformation of women's lives over the past two<br />
decades is one of the most dramatic social movements we as a<br />
country have ever experienced.<br />
Women have moved into the labour market in massive numbers.<br />
From being just 33 per cent of the labour force in 1972,<br />
women are now 42 per cent.<br />
in 1972, 39 per cent of women were in the labour force.<br />
Today 52 per cent are and Government projections suggest<br />
that by the time we reach the next century, 61 per cent of<br />
women will be in paid employment.<br />
Around 40 per cent of adults in the workforce have dependent<br />
children, and 45 per cent of women whose youngest child is<br />
aged under four are in paid employment. </p>
<p>women are entitled to economic independence and the figures<br />
I have just quoted suggest large numbers of women are eager<br />
to achieve it.<br />
There are many rewards to being in the labour force, besides<br />
earning an income and gaining an identity beyond one's<br />
family roles.<br />
But there are many stresses Involved in trying to reconcile<br />
our working and family lives.<br />
Women shoulder most of this burden, or should I call it a<br />
" double burden", because women tend to be the ones who have<br />
the unpaid job of managing the time-tables of family members<br />
and who run family finances in addition to their paid job<br />
outside the home.<br />
But increasingly men are being cailed on to share these<br />
responsibilities and this is a good thing. But I know<br />
from my own experience the strains this can put on people.<br />
As a Government we recognise the burdens on workers with<br />
We ratified ILO Convention 156 in 1990 and we are currently<br />
developing our policy responses to strongly promote the<br />
implementation of this convention.<br />
In particular, we will be encouraging employers to make<br />
work-places more " family friendly" so that our private and<br />
public lives can mesh more harmoniously than is often the<br />
case today.<br />
These kinds of stresses are not the only problems women face<br />
in the workplace.<br />
There is also sex discrimination. Being overlooked for<br />
promotion. Sexual harassment. Barriers sometimes overt<br />
and ugly, sometmsqieubl and even invisible that<br />
stand in the way of women participating fully in the<br />
economy. As a Government we are absolutely committed to identifying<br />
and removing such barriers where we are able, or to<br />
providing remedies to women to take action where that is the<br />
appropriate recourse.<br />
Pre-eminent in the latter category is the Sex Discrimination<br />
Act and the Affirmative Action Act. </p>
<p>These two pieces of legislation stand as one of Labor's<br />
greatest achievements.<br />
When the Sex Discrimination Act was enacted in 1984 it<br />
became tangible evidence of our commitment to advancing<br />
women's equality.<br />
The Affirmative Action legislation, proclaimed in October<br />
1986, was a world wide first in providing a legislative<br />
framework to assist companies to identify and remove<br />
barriers to equal opportunities for women in employment.<br />
These laws served as a benchmark o f our determination to do<br />
all we could as a Government to retrench attitudes and<br />
practices that discriminate against women.<br />
They provided legal remedies for women to use against those<br />
who would deny them equal opportunities, and they ensured<br />
that special programs for women to counter discrimination,<br />
or recognise women's special needs, would be available and<br />
lawful.<br />
As a GovernmTent we are proud to have crafted such an<br />
important reform.<br />
And let me take a moment to pay tribute to Susan Ryan.<br />
I'm sure Susan won't mind if I describe her as the " big<br />
sister of the Sex Discrimination Act".<br />
After all, as an Opposition Senator she first introduced<br />
similar legislation as a private members bill in 1981 and<br />
later, as a Cabinet Minister, made sure this legislation was<br />
an early priority of the first Hawke Government.<br />
The legislation has worked.<br />
Women have used it to seek justice and redress.<br />
It has helped change attitudes towards discrimination and<br />
has made us understand how widespread and unacceptable<br />
sexual harassment is.<br />
But like most laws, these need to be scrutinised from time<br />
to time to ensure that they are in tune with current<br />
realities.<br />
We have been given the opportunity to revisit this<br />
legislation with the report of the Lavarch Committee on<br />
equal opportunity and equal status for women in Australia. </p>
<p>That report, entitled Half Way to Eaa. contains seventynine<br />
recommendations,'-many of which deal with the operation<br />
of these two law.<br />
I expect to be able to respond to the report as a whole<br />
later this year, but today I went to announce the<br />
Government's response to those recommendations which refer<br />
directly to that legislation.<br />
Our full response is set out in considerable detail in the<br />
statement which I have released today.<br />
Copies are available to all present at today's seminar.<br />
Since some of the responses are somewhat technical, I will<br />
not mention themi all here but simply concentrate on those we<br />
judge to be the most significant.<br />
The Government has decided it will amend the Sex<br />
Discrimination Act in the following ways:<br />
6 by extending the Act to cover federal industrial awards<br />
and certified workplace agreements made after the date of<br />
the amending legislation.<br />
This means individuals will be able to complain to the<br />
Sex Discrimination Commissioner about the discriminatory<br />
operation of awards and certified workplace agreements<br />
and she will be able to refer the complaint to the<br />
Industrial Relations Commission which will be required to<br />
vary the award unless there is a compelling public<br />
interest reason not to.<br />
0 by prohibiting dismissal on the grounds of family<br />
responsibilities. by strengthening the sexual harassment provisions of the<br />
Act.<br />
We will remove the need for a complainant to demonstrate<br />
disadvantage; it will be sufficient for the complainant to<br />
have felt offended, humiliated or intimidated by the<br />
behaviour in question and that It was reasonable to have<br />
felt that way.<br />
We will make sexual harassment of students by other<br />
students, and staff members by students unlawful, extending<br />
the present provision which covers only the harassment of<br />
students by staff. </p>
<p>We will extend the operation of the sexual harassment<br />
provisions to the provision of goods and services and to<br />
other areas where discrimination is unlawful under the Act,<br />
for instance to unions, club., employment agencies and<br />
bodies deciding employment qualifications.<br />
Women will gain greatly from this strengthening of the Act.<br />
Imte as lanlords cannot harass tenantsfr, xmpe<br />
We will further amend the Act:<br />
* by allowing complaints of victimisation to be dealt with<br />
by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner by conciliation.<br />
Previously, people who complained of victimisation had to go<br />
to the Federal Court and argue their case all over again to<br />
seek redress; this Is an expensive and daunting procedure<br />
and the Government was concerned that it may have deterred<br />
women from making justifiable complaints.<br />
* by ensuring that determinations of the Human Rights and<br />
Egmal Opportunity Commission are registrb-e in the<br />
Federal Court when they are made.<br />
In the absence of an appeal, the determination becomes<br />
enforceable as an order of the Federal Court, thus<br />
increasing the effectiveness of determinations of the Sex<br />
Discrimination Commissioner which at present are not binding<br />
in responding to the Lavarch Report and following a<br />
statutory review by _ my -colleagthuee Minister for<br />
Industrial Relations, Peter Cook, we have also agreed to<br />
significant amendments to our Affirmative Action legislation<br />
in order to strengthen its effectiveness.<br />
We have decided to adopt a policy of contract compliance,<br />
whereby all Government departments will ensure that<br />
recipients of Government contracts and industry assistance<br />
have met their obligations under the Affirmative Action<br />
-legislation. My colleague the Minister for Administrative Services,* Nick<br />
Bolkus, has already announced that his Department would not<br />
purchase goods or services from suppliers who do not comply<br />
with the Affirmative Action legislation.<br />
Other departments will follow suit as soon as the<br />
operational details are worked out. </p>
<p>We have also decided to extend the operation of the Act to<br />
cover voluntary bodies employing 100 or more paid employees.<br />
This will bring an estimated 60,000 additional employees<br />
under the Act and will mainly affect the largest charities,<br />
independent schools and the Catholic school system.<br />
It is the Government's intention that these amendments to<br />
the Sex Discrimination Act and the Affirmative Action ( Equal<br />
Employment Opportunity for Women) Act will be passed before<br />
the end of this year.<br />
The Government has classified them as " essential for<br />
passage" during this sitting of the Parliament.<br />
We want to ensure these important and necessary reforms are<br />
implemented as quickly as possible.<br />
Our response to the Lavarch Report has been framed with<br />
care. We wanted to be able to reply to the Report as quickly as<br />
possible, but we also needed to be sure that the legislation<br />
would be improved by any changes.<br />
With some of the recommendations, we felt that more time was<br />
needed to consider and consult before agreeing to amend the<br />
legiselation. For instance, the Government is aware of the concern by some<br />
women's groups that S. 33 of the Act be amended to ensure<br />
that special measures to promote equal opportunity for women<br />
are not unlawful.<br />
We also know that many of you are worried about the test for<br />
indirect discrimination.<br />
Both of these are complex and difficult matters.<br />
I note that you are holding workshops on each of them this<br />
afternoon. I do ask that you convey your recommendations to<br />
my Office or to the Office of the Status of Women because<br />
these are among a number of Lavarch recommendations which<br />
the Government has decided to accept in principle but wanted<br />
more time to consider.<br />
I have asked my colleague the Attorney-General, Michael<br />
Duffy, who was responsible for framing the amendments to the<br />
Sex Discrimination Act, to come back to the Government in<br />
February next year with definitive responses on those<br />
recommendations. </p>
<p>There are two exception.<br />
we as a Government felt we needed a longer period of time to<br />
consider the implications of removing the permanent<br />
exemption of the Australian Defence Forces in respect of<br />
women in combat.<br />
My colleague the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel,<br />
Gordon Bilney, has agreed to re-examine that exclusion and<br />
its legislativa basis after he receives the results of a<br />
review of women employed in combat-related positions later<br />
this year.<br />
Similarly, it was the Goverrnent's view that the<br />
implications of the exemption present enjoyed by religious<br />
schools needed to be thoroughly examined, and widely<br />
consulted, before a decision was taken.<br />
In both these cases, the Government has agreed to reconsider<br />
the recommendations in September 1993.<br />
To sum up, the overall response I have been able to provide<br />
today is comprehensive and very specific.<br />
I have tried to avoid becoming too technical while providing<br />
you with a flavour of the extent of our response.<br />
I am satisfied we have been able to respond positively to<br />
the vast majority of the recommendations and that where we<br />
are not able to act immediately, we have signalled our<br />
intention to do so after adequate investigation and<br />
consultation. Finally, let me commend Michael Lavarch and the Government<br />
members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee<br />
on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for their thorough and<br />
constructive report.<br />
They have led us through a complex set of issues with<br />
clarity and vision.<br />
But I'm sorry I can't say the same for the Opposition<br />
members of that Committee who presented a dissenting report.<br />
They took the view that some of the recommendations for<br />
changing the legislation would have " the consequences of<br />
diminishing rather than enhancing the equal opportunity and<br />
the equal status of Australian women"! </p>
<p>Well, let me say that this is just one more area where the<br />
Government and the Opposition are poles apart.<br />
We recognise and want to eradicate inequality, injustice and<br />
unfairness. They want to create new hierarchies, new division., new<br />
tensions and new antagonisms in our society.<br />
We want to work in partnership with the important Australian<br />
groups. We want to consult with and listen to women's organisationa,<br />
business, trade unions, welfare groups, environmental<br />
groups, young people.<br />
Our one nation is predicated on reconciling the various and<br />
differing elements of Australian society.<br />
We want fewer tensions.<br />
We want less aggression and violence.<br />
We want to close the distances in our nation, be they<br />
between cities, between sectors or between sexes.<br />
We want accord and harmony.<br />
These are our common goal.<br />
We as a Government and, I am confident in saying, you as<br />
members of women's organisations, are dedicated to improving<br />
our society, to making it a fairer and nicer place.<br />
I was criticised earlier this week by the press for devoting<br />
my entire speech at the National Press Club to a critique of<br />
Fightback!<br />
But my main business at the Press Club was to analyse the<br />
opposition's policy because I hold such strong views on the<br />
damage that Fightbanki would do to this country were it ever<br />
to be put into practice.<br />
I hope you will forgive me for saying so in this forum but I<br />
believe I would not be doing my job if I were not to alert<br />
Australians to the fate that I am convinced awaits them if<br />
Dr Hewson and his band of wreckers were ever to get their<br />
hands on the levers of Government.<br />
__ fjqhtback! is a damaging and destructive doctrine. </p>
<p>It is especially unfair to women.<br />
The Opposition is trying to peddle the fantasy that our<br />
proposed tax cuts are of no benefit to women.<br />
Low income earners, many of whom are women, would not<br />
benefit from our policy, they allege.<br />
well, let me set the record straight.<br />
It is Fightback! and the CST that women should fear<br />
Fightback! will tax the purse and compensate the wallet.<br />
Give male earners an income tax cut while their wives are<br />
slugged with a 15 per cent GST on every item of food and<br />
clothing required by the household.<br />
Is this the Coalition's idea of fairness? To leave women to<br />
bear the brunt of the tax?<br />
Under the Coalition's enterprise bargaining system, women's<br />
wages are likely to fall back to the low levels of twenty<br />
years ago when women earned on average only 67 cents for<br />
every dollar earned by men.<br />
Under Labor's centralised wage-fixing system, the earnings<br />
gap between women and men has been reduced.<br />
A recent ILO study noted Australia's record, showing that<br />
award rates of pay for full-time, adult non-managerial woman<br />
are now 90.1 per cent of the earnings of their male<br />
counterparts, leaving aside overtime.<br />
By extending the Sex Discrimination Act to industrial awards<br />
and certified workplace agreements, as I announced earlier,<br />
we are demonstrating the strength of our commitment to a<br />
fair, award-based industrial relations system.<br />
The barbaric survival of the fittest ( and the strongest)<br />
policies of Dr Hewson would force women workers off awards<br />
and into individual employment contracts where their wages<br />
and conditions could be substantially reduced.<br />
make no mistake about who would suffer most under Fightback!<br />
women.<br />
Child-care will be more expensive because of the OST.<br />
More than 100,000 women would lose their Family Allowances. </p>
<p>Health care would once again become an entitlement of the<br />
wealthy. The Coalition would close down the Affirmative Action<br />
Agency, slash the resources of the Human Rights and Equal<br />
Opportunity Commission and, thus, the Sex Discrimination<br />
Commioaioner, and generally reduce the role of government in<br />
promoting fairness and opportunity for all Australians.<br />
But most of all it would deny us our vision and our<br />
determination to make Australia a better and a more<br />
equitable society.<br />
Imagine an Australia where women could pursue their dreams<br />
and their ambitions, unfettered by discrimination, no longer<br />
harassed or deterred by man-made barriers.<br />
An Australia where women were not " half-way to equal" but<br />
where we all lived in peace, harmony and equality.<br />
I can imagine such a place.<br />
It's where I want to live; it's where I want my daughters to<br />
live. it is 8 place we can achieve by working together, the way we<br />
do now.<br />
I give you my solemn undertaking today that I will work<br />
hard, do my bit to help us get there.<br />
Together, in partnership, I am convinced we can make it.<br />
CANBERRA 19 September 1992 </p>
