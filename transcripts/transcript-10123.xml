2 October 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
DOORSTOP INTERVIEW GOSNELLS, PERTH<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the tax summit is on this week in Canberra. There is a push for a GST on.<br />
What's you attitude to that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, my attitude is that we went to the last election promising that there would be no<br />
GST and it is just not on. I mean, there is no way in this term of Government that we<br />
would dream of that, contemplate or consider a GST. We said we wouldn't and we meant<br />
what we said about it. I don't mind debate about taxation reform and I want to say to<br />
everybody who is talking about it now, our policy remains and we are not changing that<br />
policy but Iwatch the debate with interest.<br />
JOURNALIST: Jeff Kennett has suggested that there might be a recession in the next couple of years.<br />
What's your response to that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think Jeff ought to have a holiday.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you working on plans for a GST in any future<br />
PRIME MINISTER </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No. JOURNALIST: If there's a ground swell of support there for it, would you reconsider it? Jeff Kennett<br />
wants one, Richard Court wants one, I mean, there's a fair bit of support there for it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we've only just been elected and I'm going to do in this term what I said I would do<br />
in this term. I've got a full agenda of economic reform in this term and I'm sticking to<br />
that and I just want to make it plain to everybody and it is always easy of course to debate<br />
the other bloke's agenda that's easy. I'm responsible for my agenda, the Federal Liberal<br />
Party agenda this term does not include any contemplation of a GST.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you accept Mr Howard that basically the tax system..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I can't hear either of you.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)., media barons ( inaudible)., against a full public media inquiry. Why did<br />
J inaudible).., not to go with the public inquiry?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Because the decision we made yesterday was better.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Because it will produce a more intelligent debate.<br />
JOURNALIST: </p>
<p>Do you have some reminders in sight for voters in Lindsay?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I certainly have got some reminders. The people of Lindsay have been told by the Labor<br />
Party that after seven months of opposition there solution is to jack up their tax. I don't<br />
think the people of Lindsay are going to appreciate being told that they ought to pay more<br />
tax. The battlers of Lindsay are paying enough tax already, they don't want to be told by<br />
the Labor Party to pay more tax.<br />
JOURNALIST: campaign in the seat?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, that's a matter for the people of Lindsay, but you've got a very clear choice. If you<br />
vote Labor, you are voting for Gareth Evans' higher taxes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, are you planning an overhaul of family court services?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No. JOURNALIST: There are rumours that you are going to privatise mediation services within the family<br />
court to make the family court a port of last resort.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I am not personally aware of that. I mean, I'll go and check it. I am not aware of that.<br />
Look, it's not something that comes to my mind at all.<br />
JOURNALIST: in your plan for the family.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!!! </p>
<p>4 JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Pauline Hanson was invited by the National Party to address the meeting<br />
in Queensland. Do you approve of that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh look, I don't run the yardstick over what the hundreds of Liberal and National Party<br />
branches around Australia do, and I'm not going to be the judge and jury of who ought to<br />
be invited to different branches. I'm staying right out of that, that's entirely an<br />
organisational matter. If you want to know my views on immigration, my views on<br />
relations with the rest of the world, my views on Aborigines, I am always happy to give<br />
them, but I just say again and I'll keep on saying it, John Howard does not announce the<br />
policy of his Government to the Australian people by way of reaction to the speech of an<br />
independent member of Parliament.<br />
ends </p>
