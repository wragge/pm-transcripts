TRAIISCRIPF OF INTERVLEW WITH PRIME MNISTER FOLLOWING<br />
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT KIM YOUNG-SAM, SHILLA HOTEL,<br />
SEOULO KCOREA, 21/ 6/ 93<br />
PH: Well I've just come away from a very convivial<br />
discussion with President Kim Young-sam, a long and<br />
Interesting meeting vwhere I think we found such<br />
common ground on many issues. We had a broad<br />
discussion about our relationship between our two<br />
countries, the context we york in in tre Asia<br />
Pacific, various janUes which relate to North Asia,<br />
in particular that is, the relationship on the<br />
Korean Peninsula. Various problems vith the North, a<br />
discussion abot the nuclear issue, their relations<br />
with other countries In the region China and<br />
Japan and ours, APBC and its prospects. In all a<br />
very truitful conversation which 1' ll be happy to<br />
qIve you more details about at the press conference<br />
later.<br />
J; Prime Minister is Australian business doing enough<br />
to get into this rapidly growing market do you<br />
think?<br />
PX; Well We've rmt done that such, either countryl, in<br />
terms of Investment compared to say other countries<br />
ot the area. And yet we are natural partners. Korea<br />
In already a customer for a very large proportion of<br />
our mineral exports and we can do much ore<br />
together. The complementary nature of the economies<br />
is really quite profound. So, I think they see<br />
Australia having particular advantages, not just as<br />
a raw material supplier, but as a provider of<br />
services and also our skills in sUch things as<br />
telecommunications, water quality, the environmental<br />
sciences, computer sciences and services<br />
education services, tourism. There is I think<br />
tremendous potential between these two countries and<br />
maybe veve been late in the piece discovering It,<br />
but I think certainly the President understands<br />
that, a e e2 </p>

3: you raisa" the isue of the republic in the speech<br />
at lunch time. Peter Reith's nov Saying only a<br />
tolken debate, John Rewson' a back ing off at a hundred.<br />
miles ani hour. Isn't this rather bad ne for you?<br />
PK: gor X think that it may not in the first Instance be<br />
good ses for Autralia. I mean, you're not seeing<br />
the ladrship from the Oppoition on any of these<br />
subjects. mr Reith regards hivself an a champion<br />
* soler on constitutional referenda. Let me tell you<br />
I may this to the Liberal Party advisedly -he<br />
was the Labor Party's, beat asset in the last fifteen<br />
to eighteen months. No wat withouat a shadow of a<br />
doubt throughi all our plling and everything<br />
else M r Reith was wn iquously Labr's best<br />
asset. Nov. whenever he wish*$ to come to the<br />
leadership of the Liberal Party ye will, of course,<br />
be over the soon.<br />
As far as Dr Howson is cncerned, Dr Hewson has an<br />
opportunity to show some real form on a matter which<br />
the High Court has made a decision about and t6 put<br />
down the crude and primitive remarks of the leader<br />
of the National Party -he's obviously in a<br />
position way beyond his capacities in life -and<br />
also to make it clear on the matter that Australia<br />
not should, but must, become a sovereign country<br />
where its head of state is an Australian, on that<br />
there must be leadership from the Liberal Party and<br />
if it's not first Instance it will have to come<br />
later.<br />
ends. </p>
