PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 30 OCTOBER 1978<br />
The Prime Minister sent the following telex to Mr Hamer today:<br />
My dear Premier<br />
I have noted the views expressed in your message<br />
regarding the annual profit announced by Telecom<br />
Australia. Telecom's profit of $ 185 m. represented a return<br />
of only 2.7% on its net assets, a very modest<br />
return by the standards of most business enterprises.<br />
The $ 185 m. will be used towards the<br />
financing of Telecom's Capital Development Program<br />
of over $ 900 m. in 1978/ 79.<br />
If the profit made by Telecom had been smaller, it<br />
would of course have been necessary for its<br />
borrowing in the market to be greater in order to<br />
finance its capital program. This would have<br />
added to the pressure on interest rates and made<br />
it more difficult for us to achieve the reductions<br />
which we all regard as essential. It would also<br />
have made it more difficult for semi government<br />
authorities in your own and other States to raise<br />
the funds they require in the market without<br />
upward pressure on interest rates.<br />
I believe that we should welcome the efficiency<br />
of this enterprise and the fact that it is able<br />
to generate capital from internal sources while<br />
providing an important community service.<br />
As you will be aware, Telecom has announced extensive<br />
cuts in STD charges effective from 25 November and<br />
is moving to a 60% reduction in off-peak STD charges<br />
and extension of free line plant entitlement to 16 km.<br />
Telecom is also examining the possibility of extending<br />
local call areas around the Metropolitan centres<br />
and is looking at varioug options aimed at assisting<br />
rural areas including one which would give isolated<br />
rural subscribers access at local call rates to a<br />
centre providing a reasonable range of goods and<br />
essential services. Since your message to me was<br />
made public, I am releasing this reply.<br />
Yours sincerely,,<br />
( Malcolm Fraser) </p>
