FOR PRESS PM No. 93/ 1971<br />
PENSION INCREASES<br />
SUPERANNUATION AND DEFE1VCE FORCES<br />
RETIREMENT BENEFITS FUND<br />
The Prime Minister and Acting Treasurer,<br />
Mr. William McMahon, announced today that, arising from<br />
the Superannuation ( Pension Increases) Act 1971 and the<br />
Defence Forces Retirement Benefits ( Pension Increases)<br />
Act 1971, which were recently passed by the Parliament, the<br />
pensions of retired Coimmonwealth employees and retired<br />
members of the Defence Forces will be increased from pension<br />
payday 14 October 1971. The increases are related to the<br />
level of salaries that applied at 30 June 1971 and appropr~ ate<br />
increases will also be paid to widows and certain orphans.<br />
Ur. McMahon said that the Superannuation and<br />
Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Boards have arranged for<br />
the payment of the increases to those who are eligible with<br />
their normal pension payments on 14 October 1971. While<br />
about 33,000 pensioners will receive their increases on that<br />
date, there are about 250 pensioners who, because of the<br />
complexities attaching to their individual cases and the<br />
magnitudo of the overall task, may have to wait a short time,<br />
until the subsequent pension payday, for the payment of the<br />
increase. CANBERRA 11 October 1971 </p>
