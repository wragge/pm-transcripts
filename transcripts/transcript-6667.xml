PRIME MINISTER,<br />
FOR MEDIA 8 July 1985<br />
Cabinet today unanimously agreed that to enable it to<br />
discharge its responsibility of making final decisions,<br />
work should proceed on the framework which, as enunciated<br />
by me on Thursday, represents areas of broad agreement<br />
emerging from the Tax Summit, including:<br />
a crackdown on avoidance and evasion as<br />
outlined in Option A;<br />
some extension of the direct and indirect tax bases,<br />
including a consumption tax on services;<br />
adequate compensation of the needy;<br />
reductions in personal income marginal tax rates;<br />
the possible replacement of the income tax threshold<br />
with tax rebates;<br />
possible changes to the existing dependent spouse<br />
rebate and family allowance arrangements; and<br />
the possible introduction of a full imputation system<br />
with company tax rates aligned with the top personal<br />
income tax rate.<br />
The Cabinet will require significant further details and<br />
costings, to be provided as soon as possible, to enable<br />
it to make such final decisions.<br />
The Cabinet also agreed that:<br />
the Treasurer bring forward further detailed papers<br />
to enable the final decisions to be made; and<br />
I would arrange for a Taxation Sub-Committee of<br />
Cabinet to be established to consider submissions<br />
prepared by t: he Treasurer, before they are<br />
brought to Cabinet. </p>
