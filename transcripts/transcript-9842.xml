NOVEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PJK Can I begin by saying how delighted I am to see Jean Chretien in<br />
Australia. We have become firm friends over time now. But more than<br />
that, more than our personal relationship, what is indeed a great<br />
pleasure is to see a Canadian Prime Minister here in Australia. Pierre<br />
Trudeau came here, I think, in 1970 or there about and our<br />
relationship in the world has been so significant over time, right<br />
through this century, that our common links and much of our common<br />
culture is such that our relationship between us becomes somewhat<br />
unremarkable though, of course, the strength of it is quite remarkable.<br />
It is time, I think, on these occasions to take the opportunity to<br />
underline how much we do have in common and how much we have<br />
mattered in the world in various ways when we have acted in concert,<br />
in unity in various things, not just the conflicts but in other times.<br />
I think, we have been two countries that have always stood up for good<br />
values, for good Ideals, for good things and this is still true and I think<br />
even this CHOGM meeting where we have had a number of difficult<br />
issues, again, Canada and Australia are part of a solid majority for<br />
taking decisions that matter and doing things that mean something.<br />
Of course, one of the things we now have in common is APEC and as<br />
Australia and Canada looks more to Asia and the Pacific, not only is it<br />
good for our trade and our growth, but it is good for the sense of unity<br />
it brings to the Asia-Pacific which has strategic implications as well as<br />
trade implications. So, we are partners in that and we were partners at<br />
Bogor and we will be partners, again, at Osaka this weekend. Again, I<br />
think, it underlines the importance of a common view about the way the<br />
world Is moving and some of the big issues, That is, how East Asia<br />
develops, how we keep the resources up to it, how we participate in it.<br />
These are all important things.<br />
So, we have had an interesting discussion around those subjects and<br />
around some of the bilateral Issues. I congratulated the Prime Minister </p>
<p>2<br />
on his role in the debate in Canada over Quebec and the maintenance<br />
of Canada as a cohesive society with an identity of its own because I<br />
can't think of another country in the world that has something liIke the<br />
opportunity that Australia has.<br />
Canada is, in fact, a larger country than Australia in terms of its<br />
geography. Mostly where we go Australia is a very large or the largest<br />
country in discussions and we have a relatively small population here<br />
18 million Canada, in that vast land has a relatively small population<br />
too and it is a great opportunity given to us and the importance of<br />
maximising that opportunity both at home and in the world is, I think,<br />
something we both appreciate.<br />
At any rate, It has been a good discussion, but more importantly, some<br />
of that discussion we have already had in New Zealand and we have<br />
already done things there and we have got more things to do on the<br />
weekend. The important thing to say, for my part, how delighted I am<br />
that Jean Chretien can be with us on this occasion as a Prime Minister<br />
of such a great and friendly country and to be in Australia with Aline<br />
who we have come to know well and to like too and to introduce him to<br />
the Australian media always a dubious introduction, but I'm sure they<br />
will be on their best behaviour.<br />
JC: Merci beaucoup, Paul. I don't have to add, I think, it was a very good<br />
discussion. We have a lot in common, not only history and culture and<br />
vast land and so on, but we are both part of the Pacific and it is<br />
extremely Important for Canada to become more and more a part of<br />
the Pacific.<br />
In our discussion we realise that it is extremely important that APEC be<br />
a success. We have virtually the same interest and, of course, we can<br />
be for Australia a good link with North America. And Australia can be<br />
with us a good link with the people living in this part of the world. So,<br />
for Canada for example, our trade with the Pacific is bigger than our<br />
trade with the European continent by 50 per cent and we have done it<br />
In the last five years. So, the Pacific is getting more and more<br />
important for all of Canada and it is why I am happy to be able to work<br />
with the Prime Minister of Australia to make sure that the goal of 2010<br />
and 2020 be met so there will be freer trade and free trade in this part<br />
of the world. And it is where the growth and the people are at this<br />
moment and I am sure that working together we will achieve this. On<br />
the bilateral basis since we met two years ago, the number of<br />
exchanges has increased quite substantially, we have had eight<br />
Canadian Ministers visiting Australia and about the same number of<br />
Minsters came to Canada from Australia. And, you know, investment<br />
is growing and the exchanges are growing and I think that we can be<br />
very good partners.<br />
So, I am delighted to be here. It is my second visit, I was here 24<br />
years ago. There are some politicians here too that I met then. I have<br />
met with the Governor-General and I had met him many years ago and<br />
/ I r 4 1 N 1J14 U U0 rF . U </p>
<p>its one politician that has been around longer than 1, but he said to me<br />
$ we will be both beaten in terms of record by Paul Keating, he is still a<br />
young man.'<br />
Any questions?<br />
J: ( interpreter]-Mr Prime Minister, Mr Keating has a keen interest In<br />
Australia becoming a republic. Could you tell us whether Canada has<br />
a similar kind of agenda and could you also comment on Mr Trudeau's<br />
comments that he made several years ago?<br />
JC: I can reply In English, okay. The Monarchy is not a problem in Canada<br />
at this moment. We have other problems to debate, so nobody is<br />
debating this problem. Of course, I have followed with some interest<br />
what Mr Keating has been debating here in terms of republics, or the<br />
possibility of having a republic. It is an interesting debate that we are<br />
following. There are some local reasons to speak about it, but for me<br />
I have other problems at this moment. That is, as I said at one time,<br />
you know I have to deal with some problems in Quebec with those who<br />
want to separate. I don't want to have the Monarchists on my back<br />
too. So, you know, one problem at a time and it is not an issue at all in<br />
Canada at this moment. As far as Mr Trudeau's comments he made,<br />
I said I will comment about it when I have read what he said. Well<br />
I can make a comment, yes. That Is true that Canada is the most<br />
decentralised federation in the world, but perhaps we'd [ inaudible].<br />
That is all.<br />
J: Have you been studying in Australia how Australia deals with its<br />
secessionist movements, or how Australia has dealt with its<br />
secessionist movements we have got them but they have just about<br />
disappeared.<br />
JC: You had apparently something in the 30s, that occurred in 1935.<br />
J: [ inaudible), at a low level.<br />
JC, Yes.<br />
PJI( Very low.<br />
JC: But it was a low level. It was pretty substantial in 1935 and you are<br />
still together. So I studied that you are still together and Canada is still<br />
together. So we are all right.<br />
J: Both Japan and Mexico have sent diplomatic letters expressing<br />
concern over Canada's spying activities. What assurances would you<br />
give to them?<br />
JC: You know I make no comment about it because it is an employee who<br />
said that something you believe, you might believe. I don't know. I am<br />
not commenting on that. So I don't know, on a daily basis, the </p>
<p>operation and you have to act within the law. If somebody accused<br />
them of acting outside of the law, fine.<br />
J: What will you say to Mexico and Japan who are concerned?<br />
JC: I don't think they will complain because, for me, I don't know if it is true<br />
or it is not true. So that is what I will tell them.<br />
J: [ inaudible] wants an inquiry. What kind of an inquiry should it be?<br />
JO: This is the second time that somebody working for that organisation is<br />
talking and I don't know exactly there is mechanism for surveillance<br />
and they have to respect the law. So that is the only thing I can say.<br />
J: Mr Keating, could you just explain for Canadian readers the benefits of<br />
becoming a republic and then, Mr Chretien, could you ever envisage<br />
Canada becoming a republic? Maybe I could put it that way.<br />
PJK: Well, I think, Australia as an island continent with a multicultural<br />
society which has got of course a very large derivative component<br />
from Britain and Ireland and from Europe we have developed a<br />
culture here which is changing as post-war migration has changed it.<br />
And now, I think, in the culture of the new Australia, an identity and a<br />
sense of identity, an independence of identity has emerged here quite<br />
strongly. We live near very large and old societies which are different<br />
from us such as Indonesia, 190 million people, the largest Muslim<br />
country in the world and to approach them and to be a member of the<br />
community of nations in this direct part of the world, I don't think we<br />
can be there as some sort of constitutional derivative of Britain.<br />
To say that, you Know, here we are the Australians of new, those with<br />
a culture they have developed here, representing the things we have<br />
done here, but by the way our Head of State is The Queen of<br />
Great Britain. it Is not going to work here anymore. It has been useful<br />
In the past and we have developed a strong country here and a good<br />
culture here. But I think it is past. That we live in a group of countries<br />
which are demonstrably, by their geography and culture, Asian<br />
countries and now that we have such an opportunity in this very large<br />
and vast continent to create something of our own here. It has to be<br />
the full expression of the Australian sovereignty and Australian identity<br />
which could only really come from our Head of State being one of us.<br />
J: Mr Chretien, do you ever see those reasons pushing Canada towards<br />
a republic?<br />
JC: There was a special problem here a few years ago when the<br />
Governor-General decided to sack the Prime Minister, if I can use<br />
that word, and it is still a controversy because I was reading this week<br />
Mr Whitlam was commenting on that and is still not very appreciative<br />
of what happened that day. But we have the problem here of an<br />
elected Senate that we don't have in Canada. So, the institution is<br />
not creating any problem in Canada, the other state is the Queen of </p>
<p>England, but she is represented by a Governor-General, and we have<br />
managed to alternate between a French one, and an English one,<br />
and we have managed to be above controversy. There was a<br />
problem in the 20s you were not there, I was not there<br />
but... ( inaudib le). was sacked more or less by the Governor of the<br />
time, and eventually there was an election and since that time the<br />
Governor-General in Canada has always acted on the advice of the<br />
Prime Minister. So, we don't have the type of problems that was<br />
caused here 20 years ago, so, as I said, there is no controversy, and<br />
no great gain, or no great losses to be seen at this moment with that<br />
problem.<br />
J: Sir, a question about Canadian politics.<br />
JC: Yes.<br />
J: Would you in Canada retain in your Cabinet a Minister who was<br />
found by a Royal Commission to have lied?<br />
PJK: That's a trick question.<br />
JC: Very tricky.<br />
PJK Its not very tricky, really.<br />
JC: It depends, you know you're asking me a question that it Is<br />
absolutely political, and after 32 years in Parliament, I don't answer to<br />
all political questions that are addressed to me.<br />
PJK: I'll put it in the vernacular it was a duffed up, tricked up Royal<br />
Commission, who brought down, a dodgy finding, and it's being<br />
treated with the contempt it deserves by the Prime Minister of the<br />
day.<br />
JC: Some nice words.<br />
J: ( interpreter) Mr Prime Minister, have you in your discussions with Mr<br />
Keating have you reached an agreement on how to maintain<br />
Canada and Australia's position .( Inaudible).., position -In the<br />
APEC discussions?<br />
JC: ( interpreter) During our discussions we have made a lot of progress<br />
on discussions with relation to Indonesia. We hope to maintain that<br />
progress through discussion, and that Australia and Canada will<br />
maintain a strong position In APEC through our mutual discussion<br />
together..<br />
PJK Can I just add to that, and just say that Bogor set with clarity<br />
declared with clarity what the objectives were. And there was a full<br />
commitmnent to those objectives. What Osaka is about, is laying<br />
down a plan of action for those objectives. So, this is an important </p>
<p>meeting to back in the Bogor Declaration. I think the fact that Jean<br />
Chretien and I were very much in support of President Soeharto's<br />
initiative and declaration the content of the declaration at Bogor it's<br />
Important that we now round that out in Osaka, and that's why I think<br />
we see this meeting as being a significant one.<br />
J: ( interpreter) Mr Prime Minister, you have spoken about reform and<br />
reconciliation in Canada following the recent referendum?<br />
JC: ( interpreter) We have formed a Committee to examine these two<br />
aspects, and we have to work towards solutions before Christmas.<br />
This Committee will certainly look at working towards reconciliation,<br />
and correct certain assertions that were made which were false<br />
during the referendum campaign.<br />
PJK: Maybe one last question, and then we will leave it, thanks.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you have described 2010 and 2020 the other day as<br />
important yardsticks is that an indication that there is some flexibility<br />
in those end dates?<br />
PJK: No. They are end dates, and I think our position I think I would<br />
probably speak here for Prime Minister Chretien, too is that we don't<br />
mind flexibility within the dates, but we don't want flexibility outside<br />
the dates. And I think that has been generally most people's<br />
position.<br />
JC: And It is kind of complicated because it is a long period of time<br />
years and some countries might become quite advanced in their<br />
development, who are not at this moment, because the progress in<br />
some Pacific nations is fantastic. . And from a period of 3-4 years, we<br />
have a country that could claim that it's a have-not, and suddenly<br />
become a pretty prosperous nation. So, its wide flexibility is<br />
absolutely needed.<br />
PJI( Thank you very much.<br />
ends. </p>
