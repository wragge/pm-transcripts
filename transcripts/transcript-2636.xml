OFFICI2'. L OP.' ui OF THE DRIWI RIVER<br />
DARWIN, N. T.<br />
S2eech by the Pripic Minister,. thze Rt. Hion. William<br />
Mci-Iahon, M-I. P. 29 June, 1972.<br />
May I apologise to you for the delay in getting hare th~ is<br />
afternoon. I am not any good at arithmetic, but I am -told that<br />
we had a headwind of betw., een 100 and 22* 0 milas ner hour, ane2 that<br />
delayed us for an hour.<br />
I ho-e your rcmarks about your own P1. rc-mier turn out to be<br />
wrong. I you havc your new Lcader and your new Statehood, not<br />
at the time you get your next damff, b. ut at the time you get your next<br />
power station,<br />
This is trw first visit to the Torrit-ory sincz. I becacr Prime<br />
Minister and I ca loo: i-ng forwar2! to it even though it migh1t only<br />
be a few days. Bccausc it is mary vurnosed visit to sec the<br />
mining dOVelOnn~ ents at Gove, to visit Darwin agaix. after a lcrng<br />
absence, to have talks with the, aboriginos at the Yirrkala ' M'is: sion,<br />
and to open tlia ne w Ab-original Transitional College in rnhemn Land.<br />
First, mav i talk to yo-u butthe 7orritory and its future.<br />
I and my Govarnment have faith in ! Iustralia andd in tho futuro of the<br />
north. This dam 11r. eierhas said to cost $ Y! 9 million and the<br />
largest ever build in the:. Territory -is unmistakable proof of that<br />
f aith. Bu'_ let me put this project in the context of the total. volume<br />
of new public works being providzed by the Conmnonwealth.<br />
Since 1967, Cemrn cnwelth Capital expenditure of nearly two<br />
hundred million d-ollars aFs been ap prove: d, and total Commonwealth<br />
capital and maintenance expend~ iturLe has beer. almost 630 million<br />
dollars. ' A lot of monay, mione\ iell spcnt because it is<br />
providing the basic infra-structuire: for dev' lcpment and for progress.<br />
Let uF, take mining first. big ventures at Gavc, Groote<br />
Evlandt and Tcnnant Cre; ek have involved new investment of almost<br />
400 million dollars. The conner and gold mines at Tennant Creek<br />
and the manganese mine at Groote_: ' Eyelandt arc alread y major income<br />
earners for us. </p>
<p>Production of bauxite at the 300 million dollar . Gove project<br />
commenced in 1971. By mtid-1973 the project will be producing<br />
1.4 million tons of bauxite and one million tons of alumina a year.<br />
This will include 60 million dollars of export income.<br />
These, and other mining projects, have attracted large-scale<br />
private capital, modern technology and people. Private<br />
initiative has been encouraged, and services have been provided by<br />
the Commonwealth Government, in order to get these projects of f th6'<br />
ground. But it is fair to say the development has only been made<br />
possible by the faith and enterprise and large-scale investment of<br />
the companies involved.<br />
Then there ' is the investment in the pastoral industry, in<br />
tourism and in prawning.<br />
More than a decade ago, we took the initiative to construct<br />
beef roads. To date, more than thirty million dollars has been<br />
approved in expenditure on these roads. This has given a significant<br />
lift to the pastoral industry and to overal national and local<br />
development. Today 96 per cent of the cattle turned off are<br />
transported by road, and the value of the turnoff has doubled to more<br />
than 22 million dollars a year.<br />
I am sure the tourist industry has uncalculable but enormous<br />
potential. In fact tourists are now spending more than $ 20 million<br />
a Year here.<br />
Ta6 -~ ain~ industry, which has developed over the last three<br />
years, is supplying about a third of the nations's prawn exports.<br />
* This remarkable growth in the basic industries has led to a<br />
rapid increase in population, as Mr. Reiher said, at a rate of about<br />
nine per cent a year.<br />
Darwin and Alice Springs are attractive in themselves and have<br />
become the fastest growing towns in Australia. They've nearly<br />
doubled their population over the Past six years, and can no l. onger<br />
be regarded as frontier towns.<br />
During the last five years, the Commonwealth has matched this<br />
outstanding growth by programming now works in the main Territory<br />
centres valued at very nearly 100 million dollars. This means a big<br />
improvement in the quality of life for the people who live here,<br />
and who want to come here in the future.<br />
The government iJs also deeply concerned in case there should be<br />
any possible conflict between the full development of the nation's<br />
mineral wealth and the need to preserve the nation's environment.<br />
In the reconciliation of these conflicting interests, we have<br />
adopted a realistic and I believe, a practical ap * oroach. our<br />
Paramount concern is Z2ustrali&amp;' ncitie-na iiuLe(: rcst, iin.-the welfare<br />
in its widest sense of our own people.<br />
The government would be irresoonsible if it failed to<br />
develop the recently discovered uranium deposits, but we are not<br />
interested in development for development's sake. ./ 3 </p>

Wo ar,? coPnc? rnud about ccnsorvation of t'ic natural environment<br />
an'. the preservation for posterity of unique feat. ures of the<br />
ecology. The study which we have initiatedi on various, aspects of<br />
the onvironment in areas of potential uraniuim develooment in the<br />
Alligator River region, is an exanrple of our poliCy in action.<br />
This study, jointly fi.? aic-d by tho government and the mining<br />
comp:.. tes, is estimated to cost rnor than 500 thousand dollars.<br />
it will Pd-kntify and evaluate th flora arid fauna and other<br />
natural resources of tile area, so that the mining development_ can<br />
proceed in a ; way consistent i ti the prteservatc fauiu n<br />
. rrcrlaccable gart of our country.<br />
The government's aim is-crnsistent with the descrP-ntion by the<br />
Secretary of the Interior in th tUnitr-d States.-<br />
proror balance between rz-ourcc: develonment and the<br />
maintenance of leasant surround ' incrs'<br />
We want to saee r-evelonment that i,. ill make a pormnennt contribution<br />
