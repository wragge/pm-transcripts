    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today, 113 years ago, the Australian flag flew for the first time on top of the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Today is the very first time that the national Parliament has officially commemorated Australian National Flag Day.</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge the work over many years of Mr John Vaughan, now the head of the New South Wales branch of the National Flag Association, for everything he has done over the years to bring about National Flag Day.</p>
<p>I also want to pay tribute to a former Governor of New South Wales, Sir David Martin, who was one of the early movers behind National Flag Day. In 1989, Sir David Martin said, and I quote, “I can understand the wishes of many Australians to have more light-hearted symbols to wave on certain occasions, and I share their feelings. I’m a happy admirer of kangaroos, koalas, wattle, waratahs, broad-brimmed hats and cans of beer. By all means, let’s make happy, slick, wonderful emblems for use on particular occasions. But in the midst of such light-hearted cheering, I’m comforted to know that the Australian flag remains at the masthead, proclaiming our maturity, continuity and stability as a nation. In the short history of Australia, our people have been involved in many activities and events of great turmoil, anguish, strife, pressure, anxiety, unhappiness, hopelessness, but also, and most particularly, success, joy and jubilation. And on almost all of these occasions, this flag has been a rallying point. It’s become associated with Australians and our great deeds, strong victories and some gallant defeats. It’s become identified with our proud history and our fine traditions”.</p>
<p>They were fine words of Sir David Martin and I am pleased and proud to adopt them today.</p>
<p>I also wish to recall the words of my friend and former colleague, our former Prime Minister John Howard, who in 1996 said, and I quote, “My government seeks to reinforce Australian values and to create a secure and stable environment for our national institutions and trust between government and the people. Protection and respect for our national symbols is an important part of this. Our national flag is a unifying force, is a familiar and a powerful image and a focus for national pride”.</p>
<p>So, today, my friends and fellow Australians, we salute this flag of ours that has been with us almost every step on our national journey.</p>
<p>It’s a flag of stars and crosses. The crosses represent our history and our heritage. The stars under which indigenous people have roamed for tens and tens of thousands of years, represent our dreams, past, present and future.</p>
<p>As Australians we are proud to say that we were born under this flag, have fought under this flag, have cheered for this flag and many of us wish to be buried under this flag.</p>
<p>We live in challenging times and it’s right that we should have a public and formal celebration of our national flag. Fittingly, today also marks the 75th anniversary of the commencement of Australia’s involvement in the Second World War, when on this day, Britain declared war on Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>We are a creative and a capable people who have always faced the future with confidence. This was the spirit of those who designed our flag. This is the spirit that encourages and embodies the values and the principles which have made Australia strong and prosperous.</p>
<p>I encourage everyone to fly the Australian national flag proudly and to celebrate our flag’s day.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
