    <content><![CDATA[<p>Toyota Australia has launched the first ready-for-sale hybrid vehicle to be built in Australia.</p>
<p>The Hybrid Camry increases consumer choice by giving motorists the option of buying an Australian-made hybrid.</p>
<p>It expands Australia's manufacturing capacity today, and provides a platform for future growth.</p>
<p>It gives us a practical way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - and to do it right now.</p>
<p>It is a clear sign of Toyota's commitment to this country, and to the renewal of the Australian car industry.</p>
<p>The Hybrid Camry will be around 30 per cent more fuel efficient and produce around 30 per cent fewer emissions than a standard Toyota Camry.</p>
<p>At least 10,000 vehicles will be produced each year, mostly for sale at home, with around 300 to be exported to New Zealand.</p>
<p>Production of the Hybrid Camry is expected to inject around $90 million into the Victorian and South Australian automotive parts industries and support jobs at Toyota's suppliers.</p>
<p>More than 50 hybrid-unique parts will be sourced from local suppliers.</p>
<p>The Altona plant is one of only five Toyota plants in the world manufacturing the Hybrid Camry.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is supporting the production of the vehicle with $35 million in funding from the $1.3 billion Green Car Innovation Fund, a key element of A New Car Plan for a Greener Future.</p>
<p>The Victorian Government also made a significant contribution.</p>
<p>The Government is working with other Australian car and component manufacturers on ways to build cleaner, greener cars that reduce carbon emissions and improve fuel efficiency.</p>
