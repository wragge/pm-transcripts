lAWS: Ioware you?<br />
P t~ ' Vory wiell thank you.<br />
JAW$: First things first the Swans5 didn't do too well.<br />
iJ. N~ o. it was a terrible drubbing. it was one of those<br />
occaesions John where you had one video, Carlton, playing I think<br />
right ' At its very peak and the other side, the Swans, playing<br />
far'from theirs. And unfortunately it didn't produce a good<br />
camej. But congratulations to them. Thoy played very well.<br />
LAWS.' They did. It must be a bit of a change for you -backing a<br />
loser, eh?<br />
" Purely temporary John.<br />
LpWg: ' Andt to make it worse Carlton is Malcolm Fraser's team I think,<br />
isn't it?<br />
Well! didn't have a bet w: ith Malcolm but Don Chipp<br />
i. s a Vbry avid and much longer-torm supporter of Carlton than<br />
even, 1alcolui and he to-ok off m~ e.<br />
LAWSt : On the assets test situation, when that was originally introduced<br />
I got into terrible trouble from almost everybody except you, I think,<br />
becaulse I thought the original plan was a pretty good one. You told<br />
Me y~ u-thought it was a pretty good one. So what changed your mind on<br />
it? P. M1 nll we camne to look at in mnore detail. Vio listened<br />
to r~ pcentations from a number df people in the comumunity<br />
and it's quite clear John that while tho principle of the<br />
first plan wias aboolutely correct, that it had too many anomalies<br />
in I~ t and uncertainties. it renlly diotinguiehed markedly btetween<br />
People who had chosen different lifostyles. You could got an a<br />

.984 IN! TERVIEW WITH JOH{ N LA~ WS 9.00am<br />
P1~ ONOLY </p>
<p>P. M, conte exemption if you had a holiday home to a certain<br />
extent, but othar people who had invested their savings in<br />
other ways weren't exempted. And the more I looked at it<br />
and thought about it the more I realined we needed to do some<br />
more work on it. And that's why, John, we set up this committee<br />
under Professor Gruan and we had people froma the RSL, the<br />
Civilian Widow-s, the Avatralian Pensionore Federation and<br />
other bodies. And in the result that was very uaeful because<br />
they. pointed out,, r think convincingly, the ineqyuities of that<br />
scheme. And what we've come up with now, I think is the fairest<br />
that we poenibly can do becauoe it leaves the homue out. People<br />
are not going to -be assets-tenlted on their home and I think that<br />
* not only for those with vary high valued homes, John, but for<br />
I., lesser-vlued it's a psychological feeling for them and I didn't.<br />
* want to upoot that attachement that they had to it.<br />
LAS Yes. -Now it's obvious that a lot of people are still confused;,<br />
even' by the calls we've had here already. Can you b~ riefly and s* imiply<br />
outline the assets test?<br />
P. m's Vale~ VIl do it as briefly an~ d aimply as I oan. with7:<br />
one prelimiinary comment. One of the problems that we've had,<br />
not jufat this Government but the whola welfare systom,, iB that<br />
tharo is an~ income test on receipt of the pension and the real<br />
inequity that vie had in Australia was that people who were<br />
very much better off than others because they had a large asset<br />
level were so able to arrange those that thay got little income.<br />
* And so while they were . signif icantly better of f than others, people<br />
wuhowere receiving an Sinoome from their lower level of assets8<br />
were being deprived of the pen~ ion, or having it reduced. So<br />
what we had to do was to ha e a test on assete as well. But nlow<br />
it's not on both, it's one or the other. And that means that<br />
people % vith very high levels of asuets will now either loce the<br />
penoion or get a reduced amount. Now that means in specific<br />
tor~ s tis, so that we can got some peasuro of who's affected.<br />
No-one'a home will be counted, John. It doesn't itattar at all.<br />
Tht'e. not counted as an asset which will be used against them<br />
getti. ng the pension. ' The hornets out,<br />
LRIO#. OK, so even if it's a trillion dollar house it doesn't matter?<br />
Yes now then wthat we say is thise: tak~ e the married couple.<br />
Their home, they can have their home and additional assets of<br />
* worth $ 100,000 and they otill receive the full ponsion. They would<br />
have t~ o have assets in &amp; ddition to their house worth a $ 175,000<br />
beforo they would looe the full panalon.<br />
LAWl$ OK fo 10000 to $ 175,000 the pension is affected but it<br />
doesn't vanish until you reach the maximum of $ 175,000?<br />
P. M.:.. 4l75100O.. And at a figure of $ 137,000 for instance they<br />
* would still be getting a half pension. Now that's for the married<br />
Couple. For the single pensioner, JohtD, still home completely<br />
excclm. de4 no worry about that. And they can have $ 70,000 6f<br />
assets in addition to the home and still receive the full1 pension<br />
* and similarly as with the married couple it gradually phases<br />
out tp Up to $ ll5,00C, they can still have $ 115,000 in addition<br />
to their home of other assets; before they lost the pension. </p>
<p>P. M. eont. t So that's the essential atructure of it. It's<br />
vqry fair I think in the sense that what it means it's the<br />
arithmotic of equity, if you like. It means that for the<br />
. overwhelming majority of pensionerO whom we want to help and to<br />
whom we will give additional assitance to in the next Budget,<br />
AMd particularly to pensioner rentera, it means that we'll have<br />
additional rewources availa~ ble to us in the future from not<br />
paying the ponsion to people with ' very very high levels of<br />
4ooets. And that additional aitount of money will mean a<br />
greater capacity to help the groat majority of pensioners.<br />
LAS: OK. Now in order -to fulfil this commitment of yours to<br />
increase welfare benefits in the next Budget to these pensioners<br />
to -whom we ref er, it's now mooted, and strongly., that you're gin<br />
to ' introduce death duties.<br />
N4o. John, what we're witnessing Is an opposition<br />
who has boen almost totally 412credited in this country,<br />
1~ picking up all sorta of strava, clutching at thorn. They<br />
are best described by the press releane of Professor Cruen<br />
after the decision of the Government where he said, and rightly<br />
said, that we had made some mistakes in the handling of this4.<br />
in tho introduction of itl but then he went on to attack<br />
the Oppo'sition and naid they deserved to be regarded as<br />
supremnely opportunistic cynicas. Now they are trying to divert<br />
attention from the very necessary reform that we introduced<br />
by axgain inducing &amp; ll sorts of fears. I un~ derstand that<br />
XFr Peacock's reported over the Ãµ .* eekOhd as talking about the<br />
case of a penitioner who 4ooo blind and wants to then dispose<br />
of a car to the son or-daughter,, but would be prevented under<br />
tis test. Now I don't know how despicably low and into the<br />
gutter the Leader of the oppos~ ition can get, but that's just<br />
about the bottom of tho'barrel, Becaune there ic a specific<br />
pkovision in the arrangements wre bringing in for a hardship<br />
clause where there are particular dircumstances of hardship<br />
that arice. Now that would clearly b-a covered by such a<br />
clause, And I would like to say to you John, and X think you<br />
knowr thit, that this opportunism and cynicism of Mr Peacock<br />
and oaome of tho ILibnrals ought to be set against the fact<br />
that there'a a large section of the Liberal Party who are<br />
applauding a" d support what thIs Govornment has done, And<br />
you-referred to the football game A while ago it's very<br />
interesting that at lunch on Sunday I was sitting there with<br />
John Elliott who's one of the leading Liborals, talked about<br />
as aposuible successor to Miz Peacock, he happens to be<br />
Presidont of the Carlton Football Club, and he said<br />
c~ ngratulationa on what you've done. Ho vaid I'll w: ita to<br />
you and tell you so. Woll in other words, you've got people<br />
therb reflecting the same sort of thing as Senator Chaney<br />
who was their M~ inister for Social 9ecurity when they were<br />
in Government, You remember?<br />
7' r ,, S </p>
<p>And he said,...<br />
z&amp; WS j Yes I do and was pretty good at it too, wasn't he?<br />
he was good arid he said this in 1981, this is an<br />
exact quote from him * I think wo cannot escape the fact<br />
. that there are some genuinely needy pensioners in this country<br />
who do not receive enough help while come other people<br />
by the advantagsos arrangement. of their assets are able<br />
to draw on this system to a greater extent than their real<br />
degree of need would aeon to justify." Now ther6' s Chaney<br />
when ho was their Minibiter for Social Security who knew<br />
the system. John Howard has exaqtly the same position and<br />
gxproased it as recently as last'November when he was<br />
criticising our first toot but just said that wasn't a good<br />
* way of doing it, but agreed wiith the principle. Now I think<br />
it a a tragedy when you've got this situation John that they<br />
know that what wde're doing lo right, and for this cheap<br />
opportunism try and frighton people.<br />
OK, so no death duties?<br />
P. Mts No we've got no plans for death duties John.<br />
: Los~: And you don't see any plans for death duties?<br />
P. Mat No, r don't see any plans. that we've vaid<br />
and this is somothin~ f that we've urged by the business<br />
communit2y of Auatralia, tho Businass Council of Australia<br />
have urged thivo the ACTU have urged this, every academic<br />
concerned with the system has urged us that we sit down<br />
with tho community and analyse the whole tax system. Now<br />
valve boen told we've got to do that to try and create and<br />
fairer and more equitable taxi system.<br />
LJS: OK, and that may well include death duties.<br />
Well, I'm not saying, I mean how can 1, 1 don't know.<br />
What I'm doing is aaying that we ~ iill ask the relevant<br />
organisations in the community to talk with us about this,<br />
put their proposals. For instance, there is a very strong<br />
push coming from within the Liberal Party and other sections<br />
that we have a widely based indirect tax, either a valued added<br />
tax# or an iquivalent.<br />
SYes well I tbink that's agood idea that value added tax.<br />
PI. 1.: W1ell cee, those sorts of things are talked about<br />
by some people. Other people talk about death duties.<br />
Other people talk about other forms of tax. Now I can't<br />
I./ </p>
<p>cont. t. honestly say that we're not going to look at the<br />
whole thing. We are, we'll l~ ook at the whole range of<br />
taxation. We'll ask the business community, we'll ask the<br />
trade unions, we'll ask relevant informed academics, we'l.<br />
aeX community organisations to talk with us about the whole<br />
structure of tax in this country, so that ove time on the basis<br />
of an informed community and the largest level-of consensus that<br />
Ne can get, that we can get a tax system which does what any<br />
tax system basically has egot to do. What the tax systemn it;<br />
about i. s to-have the community transfe~ rring resources from<br />
individuals and companies to the government, so that. the Government,<br />
cAn do for the cormmunity the things that the community wants<br />
dcz'es like the building of hospitalo, roads, schools, the looking<br />
after the dofence of the country. That's what the tax system's<br />
about and the secret of a proper taxation system is that the<br />
community can, as far as possible, be satisfied that they are<br />
giving up their money in the way that they see as the most<br />
equitable form~ to that they can have delivered to them the<br />
things that they want delivered. Th~ it's what it's all about<br />
and what my Government's about is to try and have that process<br />
of consultation so that the community can say to government<br />
well, look, we think generally speaking that these are the<br />
betcombination of ways for ui to give the Govornment the<br />
money, the resources* that will enable us the community to<br />
have the Government deliver the services that we want. Now<br />
that process requires a whole lot of discussion andl analysis<br />
and it's not helped by tho injoction of cyncial opportunistic<br />
fears by an increasingly discredited Oppooition.<br />
LA" Ss Yes well I cZrtainly agree with that. I . think that we're<br />
.: all getting a little ti red of tha't. But can I ask you as a<br />
personal question, if you had your choide between dual. h duties<br />
and valudl added tax, what would you personally pick?<br />
P. M. t I don't nlee it as a choice John.<br />
LAWS: If you had to make a decision between them?<br />
But John that really is a wrong way of putting it.<br />
it's not a choice between death duties and a value added tax,<br />
If you wanted to say which sort of tax would moot immediately<br />
help you stop tax avoidance you would say a value'added tax<br />
because people can't avoid their income tax that way, whatever<br />
they purchase is going to got caught by that, But according<br />
to that criteria a value added tax in a more sensible one.<br />
tut that you'know * thatt won't be the only criterionthat people<br />
Vill use in making judgements about' taxes.<br />
LMS SYes. It's worked wel. l in other parts of the world, hasn't<br />
Yes, it'' l-been pretty widely employed and th~ y have been<br />
capable of being adjusted through time to m~ eet teething problems. e. 9 9/ 6<br />
* 1. </p>
<p>H, LAWS OK.. NOiv just before we get away from Andrew Peacock finally<br />
because I'm going to be asked this question so I need to ask you,<br />
he is now also claiming that the elderly will face reduced cxempLions<br />
and tougher assets tests once you've got the next election out of T-he<br />
WellJ i'im glad that he concedes that we're going to wink<br />
the next election. Everyone else seems to and it's significant<br />
that he's conceding it too. But what you ought to understand<br />
that in conceding the next elections, of course, he won't be<br />
the Loader of the Opposition after that, It will either be<br />
Mr Howard who supports the assets test principle or perhaps<br />
Mr Elliott that's talked about as being brought in to replace<br />
and he is congratulating me on it. So in the pogt-election<br />
situation you're going to have at least honest Liberal 1eade! ship<br />
who adheres to the principles that they've been expressing over<br />
a loihg period time. N~ o, as far as change after the next election<br />
i6 concerned, why if we were goitig to do that would we have Introduc<br />
the indexation concept. We h-ave said that when we bring in the<br />
legislation these threshholds will be indexed, no that as values<br />
increase through time they will be adjusted by the index so that<br />
it' $ 100,000 now for married couplan, $ 70,000 for the uingle.<br />
No in tvelve months time if the Index haas gone up by 5 or 6% then<br />
that $ 100# 000 will go up to $ 105$ 000. So we've put in~ to the<br />
Anr~ oincement the exact opposit6. og what Mr Peacock is saying.<br />
LM$ ISt Yes. So you have written in an increase rather than a decreaz<br />
P. M. t Written in a protective guarantee that the value of assets<br />
will be adjusted in mondy torms to reflect what the valuation of<br />
the market is showing.<br />
LAI4Ss Who is going to decide on the value of the pensioner'., assets<br />
P. M. 1 Well, that's boon arranged in a way which will be as<br />
least intrusive as poesible. If you take the question of the<br />
household effects and personal effects, we've said well look:<br />
we'll accept that a figure of $ 10,000 will cover the household<br />
and peroonal effects. We're not going to send people in and<br />
value the'Gheeta and the furniture and all that sort of r-tulf,<br />
because we want the least intrusion, t And people will just have<br />
thAt there, and if they've got assets over and above that,, then<br />
it will be self-declaration. The formt will be made available<br />
to them and they can declare. And within a very short time it<br />
will be clear to the overwhelming majority of pensioners tha~ t<br />
they are not caught up at all. And then that way, John, after<br />
we've had to appoint quite few peoplL in the first year to get<br />
the thing going, it will become a very very unintrusive and<br />
alm~ ost self-regulating thing in the oubsequent years. a. / 71 </p>
<p>LAWS I OK. So in other words you are taking as little as<br />
possible with as little trouble to the people as possible.<br />
Yes because that's what this Governmnent's about. We, want<br />
to help and co-operate with peoplo. Wec were told by the<br />
National Economic Sunimit in April of last ycar John by business,<br />
by the welfare organisations, by the representatives of pensioners<br />
and other groups, that there had to be in this great country of<br />
ours, ther~ e had to be some sort of sacrifice by those best able<br />
to m~ ake it, if we were going to get the economy moving and ' Look<br />
after those inost in need. Now what this is about is at the<br />
end now of twelve months when we've really got the economiy<br />
moving, as you know and you've rocognised, this is part of<br />
trying to make sure that we do put Government. in the position<br />
of being ablo to help that section of the cotnunity who need<br />
it most. So that means that very very well off people like<br />
John Law*, and Bob Hawke, and people at this sort of level.<br />
We shoaldbe prepared to make a little bit of a sacrifice, and<br />
I know we are, I know you are,<br />
LMI8: Sure I agree with that.<br />
P014,; Yes$ sure,<br />
X.. IIS; I agree with that. I think tthat that's eminently<br />
reasonable and I think that the people who don't agr-ee with it<br />
really don't understand what looking after a country is all about.,<br />
and that is what it's all about -looking after the country'.<br />
That's exactly 4hat it't itbout John. Tt'B not trying<br />
to say to someone whole been able to accumulate vast assets<br />
that they are guilty peopl. e, or you're critical of them.<br />
On the contrary we recognise that that sort of motive for<br />
building up and growing, that's helpful to the economy.<br />
But we then say, well look in that circumstance it's real: ly<br />
a bit m~ uch to excpect that wie need to pay you a pension or a~<br />
I part pension as well, if you've got million worth of<br />
assetu, It doesn't make,,, ense.<br />
LAS: t I'm not sure that any of us are goirg to do our children<br />
1a great favour by leaving them vast sums of money, frankly.<br />
Well I think. 4thatla right, John. Just to give you<br />
sort of idea of the level of impact its adjudged that this<br />
this schome will affect about 45,000 people, and that's less<br />
than two pe cent of pensioners. So we are really, you see,<br />
going at the very very top and. And M! y owAi view is that the<br />
overwhe~ lming majority of that 45,000 would be like John<br />
Bay# well I think that's fair thing. </p>
<p>. AWS: Yes. Look I would hope so, otherwise there is very little<br />
point in considering yourself a good citizen,<br />
P. M. I think that's right John.<br />
LAWS: Just quickly, away from that for a moment, we've tot a<br />
prbblem in NSW, we've got a few, but one in particular the mass<br />
resignation 6f surgeons in NSW hospitals. Do you see that as<br />
being the start of an orchestrated campaign against Medicare?<br />
I don't think so John because as I understand it, and<br />
I haven't been brought fully into this, but as I understand it<br />
it's said to be particularly as a result of some special<br />
provisions in New South Wales, under the New South Wales<br />
government legislation that they brought in. So I don't<br />
see that it's being suggestod as Auctralia-wide John.<br />
: LAWS-. If it spreads will you buy into it then?<br />
Oh, it became more than the New South Wales, that<br />
we'd obviously get involved. But what I intend to do is to<br />
have a talk with Dr Blewett today or tomorrow just to be<br />
briefed on it, John,. Zto see if it does have any broader<br />
implications. Because no I understand it it doesn't at<br />
this ot. aGe.<br />
LAWSt OK. Well in summary it would appear that the assets test<br />
in its present form is palatable to most people except Andrew<br />
Peacock. It would also appear that the general public are prepared<br />
to accept it for what it is for the benefit of the country nd<br />
-for the benefit of the future of the country. Let's hope it stays<br />
that way. Let's hope it works. Let's hope it doesn't get cha-lnged<br />
7 after the next election.<br />
P-Ii It won't John.<br />
A. SL Good on you.<br />
Thank you, thank youbye roye. </p>
