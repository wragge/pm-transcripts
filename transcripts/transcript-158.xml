FOR PPRSS St.' tement by the Prime -Minister<br />
RGIiI\ T rNiNCL: i;. SS<br />
The recent decisions of the Conciliation Commission<br />
regarding margins and the application in a number of cases of the<br />
marginal percentage increase even to high salaries made it<br />
necessary for the Public Service Board to make increases right<br />
along the line in the Second, Third and Fourth Divisions of the<br />
Commonwealth Civil Service, the top adjustment being P775 a year.<br />
These increases are being in effect challeneged by the Public<br />
Service Associations on the ground that they do not represent a<br />
285) adjustment. These changes have, however, made it necessary<br />
to review the salaries of Permanent Heads and certain Statutory<br />
Officers since, without substantial adjustment, many of them would be<br />
receiving less than ' Second Division officers employed under them.<br />
The salaries of these officers are ithin the authority<br />
of the Cabinet which ha. s now decided to approve an increase of<br />
Å 900 a year in the salaries of Permanent Heads. The salaries of<br />
the principal officers of Statutory Corporations and those others<br />
which are determined by the Government will now, be reviewed in the<br />
light of this decision. The date of adjustment will be the 3rd<br />
December, 1959, which is the gener.. l date applying to other sections<br />
of the Commonwealth Public Service.<br />
Cabinet also decided that the Secretary of the Department<br />
of External Affairs should be placed in the higher of the two<br />
categories which ap-ly to Heads of Depr. tnments.<br />
I think I should emphasise the fact that these changes<br />
in salary, together with those previously announced, have been<br />
made unavoidable because of the new doctrine which appears to have<br />
been adopted that the salary even of a highly paid executive should<br />
be divided into the basic wage plus a margin and that that margin<br />
should v. ry just as does the margin of a skilled tradesman, such<br />
as a fitter and turner. e know. of no other country in the<br />
world in which such a strange and indeed dangerous conception applies.<br />
Should it become accepted as a settled doctrine there may well be<br />
damaging consequences in Australia.<br />
