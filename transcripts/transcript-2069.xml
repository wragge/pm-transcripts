FOR PRESS: PM. No. 49.1969<br />
PATROLLING OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton.<br />
Patrols by the RAN and the RAAF along the Great<br />
Barrier Reef are to be increased.<br />
For some time now, the RAN and the RAAF have<br />
been regularly patrolling Australia's major fishing grounds.<br />
The increased range and frequency of these<br />
surveillance missions along the Great Barrier Reef will provide a<br />
further deterrent to breaches of Australia's fishing laws.<br />
Action will be taken to apprehend any unlicensed<br />
fishing boats found operating in the area in contravention of those<br />
laws. CANBERRA, 13 June 1969 </p>
