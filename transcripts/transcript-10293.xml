Fax . from: 31 March 1.997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE 11ON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
DOORSTOP INTERY[ EW, CADBURY FACTORY, BEIJING<br />
O<br />
Jourlsts:-Prime Minister you're visiting a British owned factory here in China, what's the<br />
relevance of that to Australian invesnent here today?<br />
PFJRME MUGMIL-l~<br />
Well the investment here oriinated out of a decision made by the Australian arm of<br />
that oprution and it's a factory built according to Austrlian specifications, it's<br />
managed by an Australian, there ame obviously benefits for Australians in that I don't<br />
think we should ever adopt such a sub-divided, small minded view of the world that<br />
says unless something is entirely A nstlaian owned without any iwvolveenent of any<br />
otber counuy that you don't even look at it Cadhury's is a company thai ha<br />
operated in Ausu-lia for long time and it's employed hundreds of thousands of<br />
Austalians over the years and wodd-wide prospeity of t* at company is obviously of<br />
benefit to those Ausbaliaru<br />
IRNIST;<br />
Do profits from hem go back staight to Australia?<br />
PRP" hMERUgER:<br />
Well r's no different frm any oth prt of the company's opiftion<br />
JRNIST: So what tfhree b enfts to Am&amp;" aia ( ifat diblq)? 31/ 83/ 97 28:: I I </p>
<p>Faxfrom PRE MINIR<br />
Well I think if you have a company which is stng world-wide T think the<br />
demonstration to the people herv of Austmlian rnanagurial expoita, the quality of<br />
that tbctory matches Aushiian specificafions and that is vay considerable. And the<br />
fact that Australian managerial oxprtse Is part and parcel of the opertion and a very<br />
imnportant purt of the operation, of course that is beneficial. But the fre of Australian<br />
investment and Aiustalizo economic activity ixi China has many feature and I don't<br />
think it diminishes the ov= Wal impact of that Of course expected along the wa~ y<br />
of the inveswient will come through companies whose parentage is not Australia.<br />
JPlNLST: Prime Mnistr, wbat initatives will you be unveiling in your speech this afternoon?<br />
PREME MISTERL<br />
Well, I'll be cinpbasising that I see the; relationship be-tween our two countries as a<br />
pazlncsbp in growth. The growth potealW of China is there to be seen and we must<br />
take every oppomtuity to Involve ourselves as partners realistically sweing the<br />
complemcntaxy character of our economnics. We have very complcmentazy<br />
ecnics. We awe reliable supplims of raw materials, we have world class<br />
Maknagerial xetse, we have top quality technology, particularly in the nding and<br />
other sectors. One of the things China needs is a govenimental and service sector<br />
infrastructure arid the capaity of our service indastries in law Wn accuntancy, and<br />
indecd in the public service. China needs advice and help and counsel in providinag a<br />
public service infrastructure throughout such a vut coury and the capacity of<br />
Australia to provide that is immense.<br />
JRMLST: So w may bc able to sec Australian dqprrenU sellin servces oversea ro Ching?<br />
PRIME MINISTR.<br />
Well, 1 hava a YbrOW minde Vw about ft I think You haveto be flexible, you<br />
have to recognise ( inaudible) chnges and I would imagn that in a rnumaber of areas<br />
the expertise of the Austalian Public Servc, which is very widely respeced around<br />
the world will be available and it is one of the thMg I iMted to raise with t Chines<br />
governMICnL<br />
JRNLSTz-<br />
PRIME AUNUrER. Fafo m31/ 03/ 97 20: 20 Pg: 2 </p>
<p>Fax. from Well, one area that's already been under discussion is the subject of, here between<br />
Senator Newman and a member of the Chinese government there is the possibility of<br />
that area needing to be explored. So we shouldn't just see that partnership as being<br />
overly in the private sector, The point I made yesterday and I will make again today<br />
is the congruence of the government and the business facets of administrative<br />
projections in China is very ( inaudble) that is how things are seen here and it is a<br />
question of us adapting to the circumstances of the markets. It would be foolish to<br />
allow any opportmity to get in the way of getting a share in the activity and a share of<br />
the market.<br />
JRNLST: Mr Howard, human rights groups are ( inaudible) for it's approach to the human rights<br />
issue? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I will be taking the approach that best serves Australia's national interests. My<br />
response to that is to promote and look after and defend the position of Australia, the<br />
values of Australia, the prosperity of Australia, the interests of Australia. I am happy<br />
for what I do in China to be measured by one criterion and one criterion alone. Was it<br />
good for Australia? I am not inteested in any other measurement because that is my<br />
responsibility. I am the Prime Minister of Australia. I go overseas representing the<br />
interests of Australia in the broadest definition of that expression and I am quite<br />
content for others to judge what I do according to whether it is Australi's interea or<br />
not That is the only thing that concerns me.<br />
JRNLST: To that end, Prime Minister, do you expect to have any success on the matter of<br />
James Peng on this visit? Do you expect he may be released?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I am not going to flag every detail of what may be discussed berween myself and the<br />
Chinese Premier or the Chinese President I think you, all of us have to be realistic<br />
about what can be achieved all of us have to be realistic about what approach is most<br />
likely to bring results. It's easy to proclaim loudly on a soapbox from afar It is so<br />
sensible to recognise what can be achieved by the steady building up of a close<br />
relationship It is often the close relationship which over time started quietly which<br />
yields the stronger result than a ilationship begun in sound and fury but over rime not<br />
producing such a esult and therefore let us masure these tings by results and the<br />
result are what counts but results accoding to the national interest of Australia<br />
That's what matrs, the national interests of Auralia.<br />
( inaudible) 31/ 83/ 97 20: 28 Pg: 3 </p>
<p>Fax. f Pon PRIM; E MNIITER&amp;<br />
I think T have a rusponsibility first and foremost as the Prime Minister of Australia<br />
and as rime Minister of Australia everything I do here will be calculated to advance<br />
the interests of Australia. It is in the interests of Austrlia to have a close relationship<br />
with China It's also in the interest of Austalia never to be reluctant to defend the<br />
vales and piinciples both at home and abroad so what I s= k to do is achieve a<br />
balance, a synthesis and a mix, if you like, between those two things because all of<br />
them go to the Austalian national interest Thank you. 31/ 03/ 97 29: 20 Pg: 4 </p>
