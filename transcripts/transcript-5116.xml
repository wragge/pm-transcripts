. MEDIA RELEASE DEATH OF MR ALF MAIDEN<br />
( Statement by the Acting Prime Minister, the<br />
Rt Hon. J. D. Anthony, M. P.)<br />
I am saddened to learn of the death today<br />
of one of Australia's most distinguished public servants,<br />
and a servant in particular of Australia's primary<br />
producers, Mr Alf Maiden;<br />
Mr Maiden was the Secretary of the Depart nt<br />
of Primary Industry when I became the Min-ister in 1967.<br />
Until he became Managing Director of the Internation~ al<br />
Wool Secretariat in 1969 I enjoyed, as did the Gover'nment,<br />
the benefit of the advice he was able to give from his<br />
long experience in the fields of agricultural economics<br />
and rural policy. Subsequently, as Chairman of the International<br />
Wool Secretariat and of t he Australian Wool. Corporation,<br />
Mr Maiden played a role of immense significance to the<br />
Australian and world wool industries.<br />
His death has removed from the rural industry<br />
scene a man of great strength and wisdom, and a man who<br />
devoted himself throughout his life to the cause of<br />
placing Australian agriculture on the soundest possible<br />
footing. I express my deapest sympathy to Mrs Maiden<br />
and the family.<br />
July. 1979 </p>
