 I will visit Turkey, France and Israel from 21 April to</p>
<p> 4 May to attend Anzac Day memorial services at Gallipoli and to further</p>
<p> strengthen Australia's relations with all three countries.</p>
<p>At this year's dawn service marking the 85th anniversary</p>
<p> of the ANZAC landings at Gallipoli I will join NZ Prime Minister Clark</p>
<p> in inaugurating the new ANZAC Commemorative Site at Anzac Cove, a site</p>
<p> of enduring significance for Australians everywhere.</p>
<p>During my visit to Turkey from 22 to 26 April, I will hold discussions</p>
<p> with President Demirel and Prime Minister Ecevit. Building upon our historical</p>
<p> links with Turkey, I hope to encourage greater substance to bilateral</p>
<p> relations and further growth in trade and investment.</p>
<p>My visit to France from 26 to 29 April will include a visit to the WW</p>
<p> I battlefields of the Somme, and talks with President Chirac, Prime Minister</p>
<p> Jospin and key members of the French government and business community.</p>
<p> Our long-standing bilateral relationship is substantial and expanding.</p>
<p> I intend highlighting Australia's strong economic performance and</p>
<p> contribution to regional and Pacific security as a basis for strengthening</p>
<p> our commercial and government-to-government ties.</p>
<p>During my visit to Israel from 29 April to 2 May I will hold discussions</p>
<p> with Prime Minister Barak, President Weizman, and others. I will attend</p>
<p> a Holocaust Memorial Service at the Yad Veshem Holocaust Monument and</p>
<p> will also be honoured to accept an honorary doctorate of philosophy from</p>
<p> the Bar-Ilan University. I will also address a business lunch hosted by</p>
<p> the Australia/Israel Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>I will also hold discussions with Chairman Arafat and key members of</p>
<p> the Palestinian Authority in Gaza. Australia strongly supports a lasting</p>
<p> and genuine peace in the Middle East and my discussions with Prime Minister</p>
<p> Barak and with Chairman Arafat will encourage the efforts of all parties</p>
<p> toward this objective.</p>
