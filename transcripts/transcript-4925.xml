FOR PRESS 13 DECEMBER, 1978<br />
LUNCHEON FOR PRESIDENT BONGO<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government and people, I extend<br />
to you, your Excellency, a very warm welcome to Australia.<br />
In the past, visiting leaders from African nations have<br />
by and large come from Commonwealth countries and we<br />
are delighted that you have-chosen to come to Australia<br />
on a private visit.<br />
We welcome this opportunity to meet with a leader of<br />
one of the French speaking countries of Africa, but our<br />
pleasure in receiving you in Australia as our guest runs<br />
deeper than that.<br />
As Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity in 1977,<br />
you personally brought a wealth of experience and tact<br />
to that position at a time when African issues were at<br />
the forefront of world attention. Under your leadership,<br />
Gabon has become one of the most prosperous countries<br />
in Africa and your experience suggests that your<br />
Government has much to contribute to the international<br />
debate on economic development.<br />
Both our countries are developing and exploiting a wide<br />
range of natural resources. We are both, for example,<br />
uranium producers and we both stand to benefit from a<br />
more stable approach to world commodity trade.<br />
The Australian Government has been active in encouraging<br />
the development of a more stable and equitable trading<br />
system through means of a Common Fund. International<br />
negotiations on the establishment of a Common Fund have<br />
reached a critical point. At one stage it seemed that<br />
the recent UNCTAD negotiating conference might end<br />
without any consensus being achieved. It was heartening<br />
that in the end both the developed and developing countries<br />
moved towards consensus on a number of the important issues.<br />
Many aspects still require further negotiation, particularly<br />
the size of the Fund and the financial details. What is<br />
needed is a hard-headed analysis by all groups of the<br />
possible options which are available so that the next<br />
negotiating conference can move towards practical agreement<br />
on a viable Common Fund. / 2<br />
As </p>
<p>2<br />
This will demand from all participants a significant<br />
degree of political will, flexibility and pragmatism.<br />
It will also require intensive consultation and<br />
cooperation between countries particularly between<br />
developed and developing countries so that all the<br />
major problems and issues in the North/ South Dialogue<br />
can be fully understood and extreme and intransigent<br />
views on either side modified. It is for just this<br />
reason that the Foreign Minister and myself will be<br />
attending an informal meeting of a number of Heads of<br />
Government in Jamaica later this month called by<br />
Prime Minister Michael Manley.<br />
Your Excellency's visit to Australia has provided another<br />
opportunity for these issues to be examined in a friendly<br />
and informal manner, far removed from the atmosphere<br />
of confrontation and rigid group negotiating stances<br />
which has been seen all too often in the past.<br />
Your Excellency, Australia is following with close<br />
attention political developments in the African continent.<br />
The stability and relative prosperity which Gabon has<br />
enjoyed in recent times provides an optimistic pointer<br />
for the future. But of course not all is well in the<br />
African continent.<br />
In our view there can be no durable peace in Africa until<br />
lasting solutions can be found to the problems in<br />
Southern Africa.<br />
Our two countries are both firmly opposed to the South<br />
African Government's policy of Apartheid. Any policy based<br />
on the supposed superiority of one race over another<br />
constitutes a total denial of fundamental human decencies<br />
and a continuing affront to humanity. It is doomed<br />
to ultimate failure, and we totally reject it.<br />
Your Excellency, I have found our discussion today<br />
interesting and valuable. We are delighted that you<br />
found it possible to visit us. 000---</p>
