PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH KEITH CONLON, ABC RADIO<br />
ADELAIDE 20 MARCH 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
CONLON: Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, good morning.<br />
PM: Good morning Keith.<br />
CONLON: Welcome to<br />
PM: Thank you very much indeed.<br />
CONLON: It's been a campaign that many people are<br />
complaining about in terms of getting off the issues and<br />
now we've got another one. But with the promise that we<br />
will get back to some of the fundmentals that I think the<br />
electorate wants to hear about, have you introduced<br />
racism as Mr Peacock says?<br />
PM: On the contrary. I've gone out of my way to say<br />
that I have not and would never accuse Andrew Peacock of<br />
racism because it's not a warranted charge. What I have<br />
said of Mr Peacock though is that he's engaged in<br />
reckless adventurism.<br />
CONLON: But don't we get back to semantics again? What<br />
you mean is he's really gone into an emotional and<br />
PM: I don't believe that he is racist. But what I do<br />
believe is that you can't make sense of what he's done in<br />
this issue at all. This matter of the Multi-Function<br />
Polis has been on the public agenda for the best part of<br />
three years. He's had the opportunity to be, his<br />
own federal president, Mr Elliott, has made it quite<br />
clear that he is enthralled by the idea, he's vigorously<br />
Urged it, his NSW counterpart has also done it. One week<br />
before Mr Peacock made this decision the relevant<br />
minister, shadow minister, Mr Howard, said that it should<br />
be looked at on its merit and not be sunk in a sea of<br />
hostility. CONLON: Would you accept<br />
PM: If I could just go to this and in the week before<br />
this is what the Opposition officially said in response<br />
in the Sydney Morning Herald to a request as to what<br />
their position was, this is what they said a week before. </p>
<p>' The proposal is unique for Australia and deserves<br />
extensive consideration.' That was the official position<br />
of the Opposition. Then just a few days beforehand they<br />
go off on this proposition.<br />
CONLON: Would you accept Prime Minister that perhaps it<br />
has been ill-sold at the least because what people have<br />
in their minds is not what the MFP proposes, even at this<br />
stage.<br />
PM: Not ill-sold, not ill-sold at least. Look at what<br />
Mr Will Bailey, I mean Mr Will Bailey is no stooge of the<br />
Labor Party.<br />
CONLON: No, but Will Bailey is a person who's going to<br />
read the reports. I'm talking about the electorate at<br />
large.<br />
PM: But what he is saying is right, that this is not a<br />
proposal in regard to which a decision has been made.<br />
What you've got is a set of principles, one of which<br />
principle specifically, Keith, specifically spelt out<br />
there shall be no concept of an enclave. This body of<br />
highly responsible people, top leaders in business and<br />
from Government, have been working on a proposal to do<br />
what? To try and have some arrangement whereby we will<br />
have brought to Australia the very best of technology<br />
from Japan, from Europe, the United States, so that<br />
Australia can meet the challenge of the major issues that<br />
you talk about. What are the major issues? The major<br />
issues is Australia going to be able to be competitive<br />
in the future? Exports, substitute imports what's the<br />
key to doing that? The key to doing that is getting the<br />
best technology married to a better trained Australian<br />
workforce. And you've had the best brains in industry<br />
and the most considerable figures, including the<br />
president of the Liberal Party, John Elliott, working on<br />
this issue.<br />
CONLON: Prime Minister, would you accept that Professor<br />
Garnaut has warned about perhaps a different kind of<br />
enclave from the other people. He suggested that there<br />
is danger with the MFP of it turning into an enclave of<br />
internationalism of excellence amid a sea of mediocricy.<br />
PM: No, but you know, what Professor Garnaut said was in<br />
a-statement which he produced, a statement which was in<br />
outrage against what Mr Peacock had said. And he was<br />
pointing out that in regard to what Mr Peacock had done<br />
was not only dangerous in regard to the proposal for a<br />
Multi-Function Polis, which Professor Garnaut properly<br />
said has to be decided on its merits. No decision has<br />
been made about it. This is why the work is being done.<br />
But Professor Garnaut's point went much further and he<br />
was outraged by what the Leader of the Opposition had<br />
done. He was saying that the approach of the Leader of<br />
the Opposition was very dangerous in terms of the<br />
relations of Australia with Japan. </p>
<p>CONLON: Do you accept in the meantime that regardless of<br />
why it was raised that this issue might be the one that<br />
sees the election won and lost on talkback radio?<br />
PM: I don't believe so. You've got to have a very very<br />
poor judgement of your fellow Australians if you'd come<br />
to the proposal that this could win the election for Mr<br />
Peacock. It is undoubtedly true I've acknowledged this<br />
over the years that in Australia there are some people<br />
who are racist in general and some who are anti-Japanese<br />
in particular. But I would've thought that people who<br />
had that sort of thinking, I wouldn't have had their<br />
support anyway. But I will not, in this election or any<br />
other occasion, compromise the commitment I have to<br />
Australia's future. And if there's one thing that is<br />
absolutely critical Keith to Australia's future, it is<br />
that we be enmeshed with our region. Japan is part of<br />
that. Japan is our largest trading partner. If we in<br />
Australia are going to be able to move away from total<br />
reliance on what we grow and what we dig up out of the<br />
ground to develop our competitive manufacturing<br />
industries, we have to be meshed into this dynamic<br />
region. We've got to get the best technology from there<br />
and other parts so that we can compete. And anything<br />
which directly or indirectly involves a derogation from<br />
that position is the worst thing that we can do for our<br />
children and their children.<br />
CONLON: Let's come to economic management. What do you<br />
say to the people who say it was actually missing from<br />
your policy speech?<br />
PM: I say they don't know what they're talking about,<br />
simply don't know what they're talking about. In a<br />
campaign you have your policy speech and you have your<br />
whole range of other statements. Now in February, the<br />
22nd February, I made a major speech on micro-economic<br />
reform and our program for the future in which I set out<br />
the ten areas of reform in the future period. On the<br />
question of the economic future, it is Hawke and the<br />
Government which has been available to and has answered<br />
all the questions that have been put.<br />
CONLON: Given the concern about micro-economic reform,<br />
about an export culture being developed, about changing<br />
our ways, why wasn't there more of that in your speech?<br />
PM: There was. I mean you take for instance what<br />
could be more critically important to the future economic<br />
structure of Australia than the creation of 50 cooperative<br />
centres of excellence, scientific research<br />
excellence. I mean nothing could be more critical. Here<br />
we are, I'm going to establish and have to be spending<br />
$ 100 million a year within five years on the creation<br />
around Australia of 50 co-operative centres bringing<br />
together the best of CSIRO, our universities and private<br />
industries to get to the leading edge of research, as I </p>
<p>said, to transform excellence in ideas into productive<br />
output. Nothing could be more central than that.<br />
CONLON: No-one would deny that. But it's not the only<br />
central issue. People would say when are you going to<br />
tackle the waterfront, when are you going to get down to<br />
the real micro-economic reform?<br />
PM: The answer to that would be, given in this last week<br />
by the industry itself. I mean have you read what the<br />
industry itself has said in this last week? The industry<br />
has praised the Labor Government, said for the first time<br />
a government has tackled these issues, tackled it<br />
effectively and that the Labor way of tackling it has<br />
proved effective and is to be preferred to the<br />
alternative, the Opposition. That's come from the people<br />
in the industry itself. And look at the facts. As a<br />
result of what we've done, already, by 1992 manning<br />
levels in the Australian shipping industry will be at the<br />
OECD average. All you ever had before was talk and<br />
bluster, no action from the conservatives. We've done<br />
it. CONLON: What about train drivers though.<br />
PM: Now let's go to the waterfront. A plan which is<br />
already producing significant increases in productivity<br />
which will remove 3000 of the elderly people from the<br />
wharves, bring in 1000 younger people, substitute the<br />
system of pool employment which you've got now, which is<br />
not conducive to productivity improvement, and substitute<br />
particular employer/ employee relationships. Now the<br />
people in the industry and the users in the industry have<br />
come out in this last week and praised us for doing that,<br />
said nothing's been done before and that what the<br />
Opposition is talking about would be counterproductive.<br />
You can't have much better than that.<br />
CONLON: While we're talking about productivity, the<br />
Accord is about steady change. Is that a reasonable<br />
description? PM: I think steady change is a fair way of putting it,<br />
but steady and effective change. It's very interesting<br />
that just within the last 24 hours or so the figures have<br />
come out from research the National University which<br />
suggest on their calculations that as a result of the<br />
Accord real wages are some five percent lower than they<br />
would otherwise have been and in regard to employment<br />
that employment is somewhere between 300 and 700,000<br />
higher than it would've been in the absence of the<br />
Accord. CONLON: So we've traded off.<br />
PM: Of course we've done That's what the essence of<br />
the Accord has been, that the trade union movement has<br />
been prepared to substitute higher money wage increases </p>
<p>for lesser money wage increases and improvements in the<br />
social wage. They've taken comfort from the fact, for<br />
instance, that the Government has poured an enormous<br />
amount of money into educational opportunities so that<br />
now instead of having one in three of our kids staying on<br />
in school we have nearly two in three of our kids staying<br />
on. Now for a working man, nothing can be more important<br />
that the Government act in a way which increases the<br />
likelihood that his boy or girl is going to be able to<br />
stay on in the education system.<br />
CONLON: Prime Minister, on the Accord, on apparent<br />
industrial peace<br />
PM: Not apparent, a 60% reduction in industrial<br />
disputes. A 60% reduction. Now that's not apparent.<br />
Not by anyone's judgement.<br />
CONLON: I kept the broad figures. Can I put to you a<br />
couple of questions, particularly for our state-wide<br />
listeners who are concerned about a couple of disputes<br />
that go on. GTS Freight in our Riverland is being<br />
affected by TWU pickets that are in defiance of a federal<br />
court order they're looking for higher wages. There's<br />
an abattoirs dispute which some people say will start<br />
affecting metropolitan meat supplies some time shortly.<br />
There are strikes, lightning strikes happening with the<br />
Meat Industry Employees Union in support of a 38 hour<br />
week. Now are they signs that the Accord really is a<br />
bandaid affair?<br />
PM: Of course it's not. I mean, what do you say to the<br />
proposition, look at the seven years, that under the<br />
Accord you've had a 60% reduction<br />
CONLON: But what about these issues for the state-wide<br />
listeners.<br />
9PM: Wait a minute<br />
CONLON: They don't want to know about the past, they<br />
want to know about now.<br />
PM: This is the present. This is taking the whole of<br />
the seven years. It's not the past. It's taking the<br />
whole of my seven years under an Accord system. Now if<br />
you want to wipe away Keith and say oh well a<br />
reduction, we'll forget that, that's got nothing to do<br />
with it.<br />
CONLON: No<br />
PM: Ok. Well then let me go to the next point.<br />
CONLON: What about these.<br />
PM: Well I'll tell you about these. I'll tell you about<br />
these. If you want a society which is going to be free </p>
<p>of strikes then you move to a left wing dictatorship or a<br />
right wing dictatorship. If you want a society which is<br />
not going to have strikes, that's what you've got to<br />
have. A communist dictatorship which fortunately are<br />
disappearing now, and right wing dictatorships, they<br />
haven't entirely disappeared but let's hope they do. But<br />
in a free society there are going to be strikes. The<br />
question is are we going to have an Australia in which<br />
you have a system which minimises the possibility of<br />
strikes, not eliminates them, minimises them, or<br />
encourages them. And what Australia is faced with now,<br />
you point to these two disputes. I'm telling you, I will<br />
not produce an Australia where there are no strikes.<br />
CONLON: Ok, but what about producing an Australia where<br />
people aren't trying for less hours a week at a time when<br />
you're talking more productivity.<br />
PM: I'm talking more productivity and the answers are<br />
being produced. Have you noticed how the Opposition has<br />
dropped off what was a lie, where they were saying<br />
productivity was stagnant, it hadn't increased. Of<br />
course the figures that are out now from within Australia<br />
and within the OECD show that the productivity<br />
improvements in Australia under this period have been<br />
very very considerable, of the order of three percent per<br />
annum. Now of course you're going to have much greater<br />
co-operation in a situation where the attitude of the<br />
Commonwealth Government is this. That is that there is a<br />
role for Government and the Arbitration Commission to<br />
intervene. Against the words of Mr Peacock last year,<br />
which is still his philosophy, he said that Government<br />
should withdraw from disputes, there's no place, what<br />
Australia needs is the Government out of disputes and out<br />
of wage fixing as such. That is why Mr Peacock would've<br />
let the pilots get their 30%. And if the pilots had got<br />
their 30% so everyone else would've gone for it. In<br />
other words you can go back to what you had in the past,<br />
a free for all rather than a fair for all situation.<br />
CONLON: Can we look at the fourth term, the Hawke term<br />
as you hope to see come Saturday night. The Accord is<br />
based on really a soft landing, isn't it. It'll work for<br />
everybody if the soft landing comes in. Isn't that what<br />
you're saying?<br />
PM: No, the Accord is not based on a soft landing.<br />
CONLON: The goods are, the goodies are, the results<br />
workers are based on a soft landing.<br />
PM: Not based on a soft landing. What we did was<br />
inherited in ' 83 this is what the Accord came out of<br />
the hardest landing this economy had had for 50 years.<br />
We had the worst recession in 50 years in ' 83, the<br />
hardest landing ever had.<br />
CONLON: But this is the next Accord that you </p>
<p>PM: It's another version of the Accord. The Accord is<br />
adapted to changing circumstances. Now for this present<br />
situation, what we negotiated at the beginning of this<br />
year was a lower money wage increase than the trade union<br />
movement could've negotiated. What Bill Kelty and the<br />
ACTU have been doing over the last 12 months is knocking<br />
back offers of very substantial money wage increases,<br />
because they took the view that that would be against the<br />
interests of the economy. We-' ve negotiated a wages<br />
outcome of the order of seven percent. Also as part of<br />
the agreement, instead of a money wage increase, is a<br />
three percent improvement in the superannuation factor<br />
over three years. Which will mean that at the end of<br />
this three years which has been now negotiated that every<br />
worker under an award will be having paid into his or her<br />
fund $ 30 a week by the employer.<br />
CONLON: That's the good news for the people in work.<br />
But what if, as many people are now predicting a<br />
recession comes, the trade-off is out of whack isn't it?<br />
PM: You're simply wrong. Would you point to me the many<br />
people who are predicting a recession. Who are the many<br />
economists or many people who are predicting a recession?<br />
CONLON: I'm not in a position to list them. I'm<br />
asking a question about a recession.<br />
PM: I'm not trying to be difficult Keith. Would you<br />
tell me one economist who's predicting a recession, one.<br />
CONLON: No, I can't<br />
PM: Of course you can't.<br />
CONLON: But I can talk in terms of business confidence.<br />
What about the Chamber of Commerce figures today?<br />
PM: But that's a different proposition about business.<br />
Of course business is saying that activity is slowing<br />
down. But I hope you'll admit to me that that is<br />
different from your assertion that many people are<br />
predicting a recession. You can't name me one economist<br />
who's predicting a recession.<br />
eONLON: No, but I can say that the Chamber of Commerce<br />
today in the Advertiser is reported to find that 40% of<br />
businesses which responded to their most recent survey<br />
expect to cut staff numbers in the next year.<br />
PM: That is not a recession.<br />
CONLON: It's pretty tough if you're one of the blokes<br />
out of work. </p>
<p>PM: Well wait a minute. Let me tell you what the<br />
average rate of employment growth has been under my<br />
period of Government.<br />
CONLON: Excuse me a moment, I've just got someone<br />
playing with my microphone. Just make a bit of noise out<br />
there in the electorate.<br />
PM: The average rate of employment growth under my<br />
Government has been 3.5% per annum. And may I just<br />
contrast that with what the average rate of employment<br />
growth was under my predecessors. It was in other<br />
words I've created, with my colleagues and with the<br />
cooperation of the trade union movement and of employers,<br />
we've created jobs five times faster than they did.<br />
CONLON: But you're also presiding over record<br />
bankruptcies.<br />
9 PM: Not record bankruptcies. We've got a situation<br />
where in that growth of jobs that I'm talking about, 1.6<br />
million new jobs, 93% of them have been in the private<br />
sector, 93%. Now what I'm saying is that the rate of<br />
employment growth will slow down somewhat. The rate of<br />
employment growth will slow down somewhat. In that sense<br />
we will have the soft landing. And that's what's been<br />
expected by the banking industry, it's what's been<br />
expected by economists. There's all the difference in<br />
the world. But in doing what the Government has to do,<br />
we've had to slow down the rate of economic growth. The<br />
simple statistic was in the previous year we increased<br />
our consumption by eight percent, increased our<br />
production by four percent, and that gap of four percent<br />
was made up of extra imports. So we've had to slow down,<br />
had to slow down the rate of growth so that we can deal<br />
with that excessive level of imports.<br />
CONLON: brakes aren't on too hard and it's too late<br />
to take them off.<br />
PM: I'm certainly guaranteeing that. But more<br />
importantly in a sense in an election period I guess<br />
people might say oh well, the Prime Minister will want to<br />
put the best gloss on it. I understand that reaction if<br />
people want to say that. I'm asserting it. After all,<br />
we've been in charge of the economy for seven years and<br />
had record growth. Growth, may I recall, our rate of<br />
growth has been almost twice as fast as the growth in GDP<br />
as under our predecessors, employment five times as fast.<br />
So I have the authority to talk about relative<br />
performance. But in a sense now, more importantly than<br />
what I'm saying Keith, the banking sector, not only here<br />
but overseas, you've got the position where the<br />
assessment overseas is in our favour. You heard what's<br />
been said this morning on AM it's part of your network.<br />
CONLON: Indeed. </p>
<p>PM: And there you had a New York analyst, Lisa Cinstrom,<br />
saying that the market would be shocked by an<br />
Opposition victory, an Opposition victory would be more<br />
negative for the currency. Everybody here is looking for<br />
a Labor victory.<br />
CONLON: Is it sort of the bad news or the bad news<br />
because the Commonwealth Bank has just raised it's five<br />
year fixed interest rate.<br />
PM: What are you trying to suggest from that? What's<br />
the general implication of that?<br />
CONLON: Well, it<br />
PM: What's the general implication<br />
CONLON: That maybe the interest rates aren't coming down<br />
as promised by Mr Keating.<br />
PM: You are the only person in Australia, apart from Mr<br />
Hewson, who's put that. There's not one economist, not<br />
one person in the banking industry<br />
CONLON: Well can you explain to people who are concerned<br />
out there about their mortgages<br />
PM: Certainly can.<br />
CONLON: why it is that a fixed interest rate goes up<br />
at the same that they expect it to come down.<br />
PM: Ok, I'll tell you exactly why. There's a thing<br />
called the prime asset ratio. That was the requirement<br />
that we had upon the banks as to the proportion of their<br />
assets they had to hold and what we call prime assets,<br />
which specifically referred to longer term Government<br />
bonds. We reduced that prime asset ratio. In the result<br />
the banks sold off their longer term securities and<br />
particularly Government five year bonds. When there was<br />
a lot of selling of the bonds, by definition, the yield<br />
on them went up. And that was the security by which the<br />
banks financed their five year mortgages. So when the<br />
cost of that particular instrument went up as a result of<br />
selling following the reduction in the prime asset ratio,<br />
when the cost of their financing instrument went up, they<br />
correspondingly moved up their fixed mortgage rate, their<br />
fixed five year mortgage rate. And in doing it said<br />
specifically, they said it, that it had nothing to do<br />
with what would happen to variable mortgage interest<br />
rates. So there's your complete answer. That's what<br />
happened. And you've had the banking industry itself<br />
saying that mortgage rates will come down, variable<br />
mortgage rates will come down. There's your answer. And<br />
for you to suggest that for a very specific technical<br />
reason why a five year fixed rate went up that that has<br />
any meaning for variable interest rates is, I'm sorry </p>
<p>Keith, but just flying in the face of what the bank<br />
itself said.<br />
CONLON: Did they not also say that mortgage rates will<br />
stay at these levels for months?<br />
PM: No, they didn't. The banking industry is now<br />
saying, the banking industry is saying that it's their<br />
expectation that in the relatively near future mortgage<br />
rates will come down. And why? I mean they're not<br />
saying it because they want to help me politically or<br />
help anyone politically, or to take a political role.<br />
They are reflecting two simple economic facts. The first<br />
is that there has been a reduction in the level of<br />
activity. And with that reduction in the level of<br />
activity, some reduction in the level of demand for<br />
money, but it's also secondly associated with that first<br />
point, been a reduction in the cost of money to the<br />
banks. And they are simply saying there's an economic<br />
fact which follows from fact one and two. The third fact<br />
follows that there will be a reduction in mortgage rates.<br />
CONLON: So on<br />
PM: argument.<br />
CONLON: So on the third fact, how much and when?<br />
PM: As I've said, I'm not in a position to say how<br />
much. I can say, in terms of when, I believe very soon<br />
after the election, in a matter of weeks after the<br />
election. What the amount of reduction will be Keith<br />
will depend upon the decisions that's made within the<br />
banking industry.<br />
CONLON: Is that another way of saying it might be one<br />
percent and then stay there for a long time?<br />
PM: No, it's not a way of saying that at all. I believe<br />
that there will be a reduction in the short period and<br />
the important point is, for the reasons I've put, I think<br />
they'll be sustainable.<br />
CONLON: But is John Howard perhaps the person being most<br />
honest in this campaign by saying that whoever gets in,<br />
interest rates will remain relatively high?<br />
PM: Well it Just depends when you sort of clock into<br />
John Howard and hear what he's saying. I've just noticed<br />
in the paper, I think it was yesterday, that he said<br />
they'd come down by two percentage points in a relatively<br />
short time.<br />
CONLON: Would you go with that?<br />
PM: No depends on who wins the election. Well, no,<br />
that's not a laugh. </p>
<p>11<br />
CONLON: Would you go with it with a Hawke Government.<br />
PM: With a Hawke Government I believe that is a<br />
reasonable prognostication. What is certain is that if<br />
there were, and I think this it quite hypothetical, if<br />
the Opposition win it is certain that interest rates<br />
would have to rise. Why? A very simple reason. I mean<br />
again, these are not opinions, it is a factual analysis.<br />
Under the Opposition there would be a wages explosion,<br />
there is no question about that because they would say<br />
off you go boys, use your strength, and wages would<br />
skyrocket fact one. Fact two is that one of the<br />
reasons why we can predict with confidence a fall in<br />
rates is that we have got a budget surplus which we've<br />
protected. We are now four days from an election Keith,<br />
four days from an election and Mr Peacock still hasn't<br />
answered the question, where's the money coming from? He<br />
has got the best part of a $ 7 billion unfunded promise to<br />
the electorate. Now that will blow the budget surplus,<br />
S that is on the outlay side. On the revenue side he's<br />
going to give back billions of dollars by abolishing the<br />
Capital Gains Tax and shovelling billions of dollars into<br />
the pocket of the wealthiest 1% of the community. So by<br />
his blowout on the outlay side and by giving away<br />
billions of dollars he is going to destroy the surplus.<br />
If you destroy the surplus and have a wages explosion<br />
interest rates must rise.<br />
CONLON: Talking promises for a moment. At the beginning<br />
of the campaign I think there was perhaps an<br />
understanding in the electorate that this shouldn't be<br />
about promises, it shouldn't be about hand-outs, about<br />
fist full of dollars and all that stuff because there is<br />
an understanding by the electorate that we are still on a<br />
hard road. Why is it then that we get these sort of bits<br />
and pieces coming out, even as late as yesterday, where<br />
you are really handing out promises with dollars<br />
attached? PM: No. The first thing I did at the beginning of this<br />
year with my colleagues, I said to them we will not be<br />
making a promise of one single cent in this campaign<br />
unless beforehand we have identified additional savings.<br />
The scoresheet was put out at the beginning of the<br />
campaign, there was the amount of savings over three<br />
years and identified for each year which would enable us<br />
to fund commitments. And as I have gone through this<br />
campaign and journalists are probably getting a bit sick<br />
of it almost, but there they accept it, there is the<br />
scoresheet. Up it goes, there was the savings beforehand<br />
and there against that the promises.<br />
CONLON: But that is the other side of the coin isn't it<br />
Prime Minister, that last year we were told things were<br />
as tight as a drum, they couldn't be tighter but now you<br />
find over a billion dollars in cuts? </p>
<p>12<br />
PM: In three years, three year's of savings, three<br />
year's of savings not in one year. And we have done<br />
that, not something new, look at what we have done. We<br />
have had four successive years, four successive years of<br />
real cuts in outlays, something that the conservatives<br />
never did. In the last three years because of our<br />
responsibility in conducting the affairs of the<br />
Commonwealth Government we have had a $ 17 billion<br />
surplus. Never been done before and we have used that to<br />
pay off every cent of Commonwealth Government overseas<br />
debt. So I haven't done something new now, before this<br />
election campaign, it is what I have been doing for over<br />
the period of seven years. We believe there were certain<br />
additional things that we should put to the people which<br />
required outlays but I said to my people if we are going<br />
to do that let's find the savings, and we have done it.<br />
Not something new, a continuation of what we have been<br />
doing for seven years.<br />
CONLON: Prime Minister, finally today can we talk about<br />
what might happen after Saturday. Do you see a real<br />
possibility of Ted Mack and Janine Haines on the cross<br />
benches in a very tight parliament?<br />
PM: A much greater likelihood of Ted Mack being there<br />
Keith. He is obviously a remarkable campaigner<br />
CONLON: This is in North Sydney<br />
PM: That is right Keith, against Spender<br />
CONLON: Do you reckon he'll win?<br />
PM: Well the indications seem to be that Mack will beat<br />
Spender. I mean you have got the two things operating<br />
there. You've got Mack who is a proven performer in<br />
getting into lower house seats he got there in the NSW<br />
parliament, and an encumbant who hasn't got a very<br />
impressive record.<br />
CONLON: Well what about I can hardly expect you to<br />
give a completely unbiased opinion about Kingston but<br />
what do you think will happen?<br />
PM: I think that Mr Bilney will win. You have got the<br />
position that has been put very clearly by Don Chipp, the<br />
founder of the Democrats, who made it quite clear that he<br />
thinks it is wrong for the Democrats to be going into the<br />
House of Representatives. Because he said their house<br />
really is the Senate where they have the capacity,<br />
according to his analysis I mean after all he should<br />
know he founded the Democrats it is within that house<br />
that they can honestly, according to Don Chipp, discharge<br />
their function of watching the other parties. You see<br />
you try and get into the House of Representatives<br />
he said you've got to pander to every group. That's, I<br />
think, a fair analysis on his part. And on the other<br />
side you've got Gordon Bilney who's been been an </p>
<p>13<br />
outstanding Member. He's been an outstanding<br />
representative. I mean you ask<br />
CONLON: He's got the problem that he's been very good in<br />
Canberra but not so good in Kingston.<br />
PM: All I can say to the electors of Kingston, that<br />
there's no member who more vigorously pursues the<br />
interests of his electorate and does it without fear or<br />
favour than does Gordon Bilney.<br />
CONLON: You mentioned Don Chipp Prime Minister, is it a<br />
bit cheeky using Chippy to suggest that the Australian<br />
Democrats should put their second preferences to Labor.<br />
You didn't get his permission..<br />
PM: Wait a minute. Let's be fair about this. The<br />
advertisement was shown to Chipp. He did not object to<br />
its use.<br />
CONLON: So you asked him after you'd made it.<br />
PM: But before it was put to air. And he raised no<br />
objection to it being used. So let's be fair about that.<br />
CONLON: He was a bit testy about it wasn't he?<br />
PM: No, he didn't appear to me to be testy. I think he<br />
knows, I mean it was very interesting the issues that he<br />
raised, wasn't it, as to what Democrat voters should take<br />
into account in casting their determinative second<br />
preference. Because he knew, he knew that on each of<br />
those issues that Labor was a country mile in front of<br />
the conservatives.<br />
CONLON: It's an interesting election though isn't it<br />
Prime Minister? It's certainly<br />
PM: All elections are interesting.<br />
CONLON: This is perhaps the most interesting for the<br />
apologists who will be still scratching their head maybe<br />
days later. Because this surely is the first time that<br />
you ' ye actually had to spend a lot of money and time<br />
chasing second preferences.<br />
PM: The non-major party vote will be higher in this time<br />
than in any previous election, that's right.<br />
CONLON: Newspoll today says 21%. Do you think it's on<br />
target? PM: If Newspoll is right I'm happy. It will give us a<br />
higher second, a higher two-party preferred vote than we<br />
got in 1987. I could settle for that.<br />
CONLON: It's a kick in the pants though isn't it, 21%<br />
who don't want to vote for either major party. </p>
<p>14<br />
PM: It's a kick in the pants up with which I'll be<br />
prepared to put to get an increase in my majority.<br />
That's the sort of kick in the pants that I can cop.<br />
CONLON: Prime Minister, thanks very much for your time<br />
today. PM: Thanks very much indeed Keith, I've appreciated it<br />
very much.<br />
