TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINSTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
PARKROYAL HOTEL., BRISBANE<br />
TUESDAY 2 AUGUST, 1994<br />
J: You've made some pretty strong criticisms of Greenpeace, are there<br />
other factors involved?<br />
PMV: Well, I didn't want to extend the Forum press conference out here but I<br />
will take some domestic questions.<br />
J: Are you concerned that Australia's willingness to train Indonesian<br />
troops will in any way undermine the American human rights push in<br />
that country?<br />
PM: I don't think so. I think that the President has made his policy clear in<br />
respect of China. That is, that one has a bigger influence on countries<br />
when you are relevant to them and that is when the United States<br />
made a decision on MFN for China in the same way as Australia has a<br />
more relevant relationship with Indonesia than Wts had in the past on<br />
all Issues including human rights.<br />
J: Mr Keating, John Fahey has announced a public consultation into the<br />
future of Circular Quay, today. You've got some strong personal views<br />
on that what would you like to see done, and do you think a public<br />
consultation is the way to go about it?<br />
PM: Well, it's no substitute for leadership, and I hope the Premier has<br />
written to me saying that he wants to engage the Commonwealth again<br />
In a discussion about the financial costs of a chang to Circular Quay,<br />
and we're quite happy to have the discussion. But we want a real one<br />
and we want all the facts on the table.<br />
J: So, you're prepared to. put some money in?<br />
PMV: We are. But under certain conditions.<br />
J: Whats your reaction to Alexander Downer's letter involving the<br />
Ciftiens Initiated Referendum? </p>
<p>PM: Well, I thought there was a very revealing piece in today's Canberra<br />
" times where he admitted he had not told the truth six years ago when<br />
questioned about his attitude to the Citizens Initiated Referendum. Of<br />
course, this bogs the question, when is he telling the truth? -He will<br />
have to let us know. And he told a press conference, he told an ABC<br />
journalist recently, Paul Lyneham on the 7.30 Report he said, " I'm the<br />
most open and honest person you'll ever find." Well, I mean generally,<br />
if any of us in public life me, or John Hewson, or Bob Hawke, or<br />
Malcolm Fraser came out and said, as Alexander Downer has said, " I<br />
am the most open and honest person you'll ever find", yoU~ d get. a<br />
horse laugh right through the cou~ ntry. He said this, and then has<br />
admitted that he has told an untruth on this question of* Citizens<br />
Initiated Referenda... which means you can't tell when he is telling the<br />
truth. But, more than that the notion of him being the most honest<br />
person around is actually debunked by himself, on his own admission.<br />
Can I just say, though, that about his defence yesterday in respect of<br />
Mabo where he says itVs all about Aboriginal health the Liberals<br />
always put this in these terms: you can have Aboriginal health, better<br />
health and better education, or land, but you can't have both. Where,<br />
in fact is about improved. health and education and land. And, as any<br />
number of people wise about this subject will say, irs the alienation<br />
from the land which affects the welfare of aboriginal people. Now, this<br />
Government has vastly improved funding for aboriginal health and<br />
education, and of course last obviously so, in the response to the<br />
Deaths In Custody Royal Commission. But, what he's about saying is<br />
you get one or the other. And really, what ifs all about is essentially<br />
appealing to the redneck group in the West Australian Liberal party<br />
upon whom he has relied for support in his challenge.<br />
So, ifs not surprising that today the mining and farming leaders are<br />
concerned about Mr Downers ill-considered remarks because<br />
repealing the Native Title Act or even saying you will, creates great<br />
uncertainty as to tenure and as to title. Now, I know Richard Courrs<br />
trying to do this with the High Court challenge. But they say no-one<br />
will know the mining companies and the pastoralists say that no-one<br />
will now where they stand if the act is repealed. So, the tribunal is, in<br />
operation we're watching closely how it's working, and we think irs<br />
working effectively. So, this notion that it needs to be repealed can I<br />
Just say in seeking to help him, the Leader of the National party said<br />
today in a press statement that Alexander Downer said he would<br />
repeal the legislation, as an option, if iK proved the Act was unworkable<br />
But thats not what Alexander Downer said at all. What he said was, " If<br />
I have to repeal the Act to achieve our goals, then thars what I'll do."<br />
No mention of unworkable that's only the spin being put on it by Tim<br />
Fischer as a Coalition partner. So, the fact is, here, the Liberals are<br />
up to their usual business say to the Aboriginal community, ' We know<br />
better. We know what's beat for you. Ifs better health and better<br />
education, but it's not land' When the Aboriginal community * say, " No, </p>
<p>no, no, what we need here is access to land", and what-anybody in the<br />
debate about aboriginal policy knows, Ws the alienation of aboriginal<br />
people from their land which produces most of the problems in their<br />
welfare. So, you know, the Liberals the point I made yesterday, let<br />
me repeat the point the Liberal Party has lost its way as a political<br />
party. It has no policy on Australia's identity, and even on things like<br />
social cohesion, going as they must to how we relate to our indigenes,<br />
they prove again even after the Mabo debate has been had, and the<br />
Bill hat, been initroduced and passed they prove again that basically,<br />
they are. about the policies of social division and can't give the lead as<br />
a political party which Australia now needs. The Liberal Party is not<br />
capable of giving a lead on these big issues of identity and culture and<br />
on social policy, and Alexander Downer has displayed that again in the<br />
last 24 hours.<br />
J: Is Mr Downer himself a bigot do you think Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Well, I made it quite clear yesterday. I noticed a bit of sloppy reporting<br />
on this point I said that he was givng support to, you know what I<br />
think is unrestrained bigotry on the part of the Western Australian<br />
Liberals. Now, I don't know quite in the end where Alexander Downer<br />
stands on this, but I hope that upon reflection, he'll recant from his<br />
views of giving succour and support to these unworthy rednecks.<br />
ends. </p>
