<p>NATIONAL ECONOMY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
Wednesday, 7th February, 1962.<br />
Cabinet has, after valuable consultations with a wide range of<br />
industries and interests, reviewed the present state of the Australian economy.<br />
It has closely considered policy and appropriate action.<br />
There are certain very important matters which should not be forgotten.<br />
The base of our economy has been significantly strengthened. Great<br />
and indeed dramatic improvements have been effected in our trade balances. In<br />
consequence, our overseas reserves, which were running down a year ago, are now<br />
sound. The internal price level, as reflected in the Consumer Price Index,<br />
has been brought to a remarkable stability. The Loan Market is buoyant.<br />
This buoyancy is of great significance for the public works programmes, and<br />
will result in a smaller call upon the Commonwealth Budget for the supplementing<br />
of Loan funds.<br />
These highly satisfactory results have increased the capacity of<br />
the Commonwealth to play an effective part in dealing with current circumstances.<br />
We acknowledge that the promise of recovery which appeared late last year has<br />
not been realised sufficiently in practical results, and that it must now be<br />
promoted with greater speed. We find ourselves confronted by two problems<br />
which are, we believe, closely associated. They are:<br />
1. The existence of a level of unemployment which represents a serious<br />
human problem for thousands of people and a material economic waste<br />
through the existence of unused resources of men, materials and<br />
installed industrial capacity.<br />
2. A weakness of confidence; an uncertainty about the future which<br />
is limiting buying and production. We are in particular conscious<br />
of the fact that the manufacturing industries, in which employment<br />
can rise or fall quite substantially, and whose prosperity is so<br />
significant to the migration programme, have expressed a feeling of<br />
uncertainty as to whether the Government will protect their<br />
activities and give reasonable assurances of their future. This<br />
presents a problem to which we, as strong supporters of Australian<br />
manufacturing, have directed close attention. It is common ground<br />
that the business problem is to-day not one of financial or credit<br />
stringency, for the money holdings of the public and of the business<br />
community, and the liquid assets of the banks, are, in general, high,<br />
but one of reluctance on the part of many to spend on commodities or<br />
to invest in expanded enterprise and production. </p>
<p>2<br />
I propose, on behalf of the Government, to set out, as clearly as<br />
possible: the national objectives to which we will direct ourselves;<br />
the measures by which we will seek quick results in an attack<br />
upon the unemployment problem, and<br />
some longer-range measures which are designed to encourage a<br />
strengthening of confidence.<br />
Before doing so, I want to emphasise that we are not attempting<br />
at this stage to anticipate the nature of the 1962-63 Budget, or such longrange<br />
problems as will fall for decision hereafter.<br />
OUR NATIONAL OBJECTIVES:<br />
Upon the present solid foundations of the Australian economy, we<br />
aim to build a great nation, with expanding production and trade and rising<br />
standards of living. We must promote and achieve growth at a rate which will<br />
provide employment and a stimulating future for a constantly growing work<br />
force. We must maintain a constant stream of migration so that those engaged<br />
in the planning and execution of productive and business enterprise shall see<br />
before them expanding horizons and a growing demand for what they produce or<br />
sell. We look to private enterprise to play the major part in our expansion.<br />
As the essential condition of such growth and expansion, we must<br />
develop our basic national resources of land, water, power, minerals, science,<br />
and skill. The achievement of these objectives will require a sense of<br />
dedication, a wide realisation of their vital importance, and a high degree<br />
of co-operation from all sections of our community.<br />
None of those who interviewed us wished to generate anything in<br />
the nature of another inflationary boom; nor do we. But we make it clear<br />
that, so far from desiring stagnation, we are determined upon growth. We<br />
believe that this can be reconciled with a reasonable stability of the<br />
Australian cost and price structure, and with a strong external position.<br />
IMMEDIATE MEASURES: It is true that, as usual in the past, the number of those<br />
registered for employment rose sharply in December. They will rise further<br />
again during January ( the figures for which will be shortly known). This<br />
is the time of the year when scores of thousands of boys and girls leaving </p>
<p>-3-<br />
school register for employment. It is also a time when seasonal unemployment<br />
is considerable. But we must all do what we can to see that succeeding<br />
figures come down as fast as we can make them. In short, we have looked for<br />
measures producing the quickest possible results, putting into a second category<br />
( which I will deal with later in this statement) those measures which<br />
will carry forward and enhance these results.<br />
We have decided as follows<br />
1. We will put before the meeting of Premiers next week an offer to<br />
provide forthwith a special non-repayable grant of Å ElOi. for employment-<br />
giving activities, mainly in the works field. The detailed<br />
application of this sum, as a supplement in the current financial<br />
year, will be discussed with the Premiers. It is our intention<br />
that it should be supplied and allocated mainly on the basis of<br />
meeting employment needs.<br />
2. We will, over the balance of the current financial year, advance an<br />
additional Å 5m. to the States for housing. This allocation will be<br />
discussed with the Premiers mainly on the basis of meeting employment<br />
needs in the building and associated industries.<br />
3. We will propose to the States that semi-government and local government<br />
borrowing authorisation for this financial year be at once<br />
substantially increased. Much quick employment could be provided<br />
in this way.<br />
4. The problems created by the recent Census in relation to financial<br />
assistance grants to the States will be approached by us in a helpful<br />
fashion. We estimate that the acceptance of these proposals will, over the<br />
next four to five months, add some 125m. to the spending resources<br />
of the States and their subsidiary bodies. Concentrated as they<br />
will be into a short period, these expenditures should give, directly<br />
and Indirectly, a quite powerful stimulus to employment and to<br />
business.<br />
6. Recognising the personal and family problems of those compelled to<br />
rely upon Unemployment Benefits, we propose to make certain increases<br />
as follows-. Present Rate New Rate<br />
Weekly Weekly<br />
Adult or Married Minor 13.15. 2. 6<br />
Wife Å 92.12. 6 Å E3.<br />
First Child 12. 6 15.<br />
Subsequent Children Nil 15. each ch il1d. </p>
<p>4<br />
All of these payments for children are additional to the normal<br />
child endowment payments.<br />
We will introduce, in the first session, legislation to provide<br />
that these increases will operate as from March 1st. The provision<br />
for children after the first is new, and will give added<br />
material family assistance.<br />
7. We will introduce a measure to provide a rebate of 5% in personal<br />
income tax for the income year 1961-62. This will be made effective<br />
( in reality retrospectively) by reduced P. A. Y. E. deductions as from<br />
March 1st, 1962, appropriate adjustments being made in relation to<br />
provisional tax payments. In the case of P. A. Y. E. taxpayers, for<br />
example, this will mean that the deductions to be made in the concluding<br />
four months of the current financial year will be reduced<br />
to an extent which will make the overall 5% rebate effective.<br />
To provide an overall 1961-62 rebate of in the of tax,<br />
the rebate would, in the four months March 1st June 30th, be 3/-<br />
in the of tax). The effect of this measure will be to add<br />
to the disposable income of the community over these four months.<br />
8. A review has been made of the Commonwealth's own works programme<br />
to see what further scope there may be for accelerating works now<br />
in progress or bringing forward projects on which an early start<br />
could be made. This has disclosed some useful, if limited,<br />
possibilities for such action in fields like Defence, the Post<br />
Office and civil works generally and these are being put into<br />
operation urgently.<br />
9. Sales tax on motor cars and station wagons and other motor vehicles<br />
now taxable at 30% will, as from the date of this announcement, be<br />
taxable at the reduced rate of 226.<br />
On commercial motor vehicles, motor cycles, and motor vehicle parts<br />
and accessories, the present rate of 162/ 3% will be reduced to 1206.<br />
In the field of Housing, and additional to what I have said about<br />
advances to the States, we have made the following new decisions<br />
War Service Homes. We will propose to Parliament that<br />
the maximum advance be increased in all categories from<br />
Å 2,750 to Å 3,500. Applications for loans on the new<br />
basis will be received from the date of this announcement.<br />
The actual making of the loans will of course await amending<br />
legislation in the forthcoming session.<br />
Steps are being taken to promote further increased lending<br />
for housing by the Commonwealth Savings Bank and other<br />
financial institutions. </p>
<p>LONGER TERM MEASURES: The measures I now announce are not to be taken as covering the<br />
whole field of future action. For instance, we are putting in hand a complete<br />
review of tariff policy and the functions of the Tariff Board. In the case of<br />
the rural industries, so vulnerable to costs, further encouragement of productivity,<br />
already notably increasing, is essential. We are investigating<br />
such problems with all speed.<br />
But in the meantime, and to assist in a restoration of confidence<br />
and therefore employment, we have made the following significant decisions:<br />
1. We have decided to introduce, for manufacturing activities, a system<br />
of Investment Allowances at a rate of These allowances are to<br />
apply to new plant and equipment used in manufacturing production.<br />
Naturally there are many details to be settled matters of technical<br />
definition and the like and the Treasurer will make a comprehensive<br />
statement on this at an early date. Subject to this, all I shall<br />
say here is that we intend the concession to be available on plant<br />
delivered and installed after the date of this announcement.<br />
Legislation will be brought down in the forthcoming session of<br />
Parliament. We have thought it right and timely for several reasons to introduce<br />
a measure of this kind just now. One is to provide a general<br />
encouragement to investment in manufacturing industry to which we<br />
must look, perhaps more than to any other industry, for increased<br />
employment opportunities, not only in the months ahead of us but in<br />
the longer term. A second is that we see a vital need to assist<br />
and encourage the pursuit of higher efficiency in this great sector<br />
of our economy so that it may produce what we ourselves need at lower<br />
costs and in greater volume. It is also most important that our<br />
manufacturing industries should be, in this way, helped to meet on at<br />
least equal terms the industries of other countries in the markets<br />
where we are trying to win a foothold.<br />
The third reason is that we want to make it plain to manufacturing<br />
industry that it has not only our confidence but also our practical<br />
backing in the great expansion it must undertake if our national<br />
growth is to go on at the rate we want to see.<br />
2. Confidence is important, for while Australian industry can be affected<br />
by import competition, it can be affected even more by a falling off<br />
in general customer demand in Australia. Should it, at any future<br />
time, become necessary to impose any check upon such demand, imports<br />
must take a due share of restriction. </p>
<p>C, -6-<br />
We have no intention to re-introduce import licensing as we have<br />
k~ nown it. But recent experience has suggested that in some<br />
industries,, or some sections of some industries, an inrush of<br />
imports has done real damage. Where any such case is established,<br />
special and temporary measures are justified, pending the operation<br />
of the machinery we propose. Certain motor vehicle components,<br />
certain chemicals, textiles, paper products and categories of timber<br />
may be examples.<br />
A competent independent Special Adviser on whose advice we will consider<br />
imposition of temporary Quantitative Restrictions upon a<br />
particular commodity will be appointed.<br />
The intention would be to make Legislative provision to bring this<br />
Special Adviser within the Tariff Board framework. We will take<br />
legislative steps to make it clear that in future the Tariff Board<br />
may, in the special circumstances of any particular case before it,<br />
recommend a Quantitative Restriction if it thinks fit, where such a<br />
recommendation would not conflict with the The Minister<br />
for Trade will take an early opportunity of elaborating these ideas.<br />
3. We had a valuable discussion with the Trading Banks about various<br />
important matters which affect their operations. We are examining<br />
these in a sympathetic way. Further discussions will be needed<br />
before we reach finality. The Treasurer has since carried on these<br />
discussions with the representatives of the Trading Banks and the<br />
Governor of the Reserve Bank, Special attention is being given in<br />
these talks to the problem of longer term lending particularly for<br />
rural development and for certain classes of export sales. Meanwhile,<br />
I want to emphasise that we want these Banks to be able to<br />
play an increasingly important role in our progress.<br />
4. At the time of our last Budget the Government considered the position<br />
of the Commonwealth Development Bank, which has shown itself to be a<br />
useful supplement to other sources of finance for primary and secondary<br />
industry, and said that it wished the Bank to be able to maintain its<br />
important functions. An amount of Å Sm. was provided in the Budget<br />
by way of additional capital for the Bank, It undertook then to<br />
keep the funds position of the Bank under close review and it has now<br />
decided that, to ensure that the Bank will be able to maintain its<br />
current volume of lending to industry, a further amount of Å 5m. should<br />
be provided for it in the current financial year.<br />
The measures which the Government has decided upon, and which I<br />
have now announced, are far-reaching. They proceed from our unqualified faith<br />
in the future of Australia, and from our desire to give tangible reasons why<br />
this faith should be shared and acted upon by Australian industries and people. </p>
<p>4 1 7<br />
Our emphasis is upon national growth. A vigorous policy of<br />
expansion with migration can, of course, create challenging problems. But<br />
it is part of our policy and firm intention that should there arise in future<br />
symptoms of undue pressure upon our resources of manpower and materials, we<br />
should be in a position to deal with such matters by specifically designed<br />
measures. To facilitate the taking of any such action at an appropriate<br />
time, we intend to engage in periodical consultation with those engaged in<br />
practical production and business.<br />
We live in a great country. It is our task to see that it becomes<br />
better and stronger as the years go on.<br />
Canberra, 7th February, 1962. </p>
