    <content><![CDATA[<p>In recent weeks Mr. Beazley has delivered conflicting messages to</p>
<p> different audiences about the future of Telstra's dividend.</p>
<p>On June 21 he appeared to tell Channel Nine's Sunday program</p>
<p> that new initiatives in rural and regional areas would be funded by</p>
<p> Labor from part of Telstra's dividend.</p>
<p>Four days later he talked to a CEDA conference of only being able</p>
<p> to retain existing programmes, rather than funding any new initiatives.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr Beazley has refused to reveal where the money would</p>
<p> come from as Telstra dividends are already factored into budget spending.</p>
<p>He admitted on June 25 that "we know this money is there in the</p>
<p> Budget".</p>
<p>You can't spend the same money twice, Mr. Beazley.</p>
<p>If he does not intend additional spending then the Leader of the Opposition</p>
<p> should now reveal which areas of spending such as hospitals, nursing</p>
<p> homes, Medicare or schools, will be cut to find "guaranteed"</p>
<p> bush infrastructure spending.</p>
<p>These confused and conflicting promises come from a former failed</p>
<p> Finance Minister, whose Labor Government irresponsibly left a $10.5</p>
<p> billion budget deficit when it lost office.</p>
<p>The Coalition has a clearly budgeted position with the proceeds from</p>
<p> the Telstra sale to be used to retire Labor debt and provide a social</p>
<p> bonus for all Australians.</p>
<p>Labor always says one thing and does another.</p>
<p>Mr. Beazley sold Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, after telling the</p>
<p> electorate that he wouldn't. Many Australians therefore suspect</p>
<p> that Mr. Beazley will do the same over Telstra if he ever was returned</p>
<p> to Government.</p>
<p>Kim Beazley's dividend confusion will only reinforce Australians'</p>
<p> cynicism over Labor's empty Telstra pledges.</p>
