    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what do you hope to achieve by the visit?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Most importantly get to know the new leadership of China, the most populace country in the world, a hugely important trading and political partner of Australia';s, and in particular to talk about not only the bilateral relationship but also North Korea. So I couldn';t be coming here at a more important time and the value of a quick visit like this is enormous.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So it';s much more than just a courtesy call then?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes. It';s to get to know the new President and the new Premier, and also to talk about the terrific advances in the bilateral relationship.  We have come a long way in the last few years and I don';t want anything to happen that will occasion slippage in the relationship and also of course North Korea is at a very crucial stage.  The Chinese have played a very constructive role in relation to North Korea,a very positive role which Australia appreciates and Australia strongly supports.</p>
<p>   JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will be urging them to use their leverage on North Korea or just asking them….?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well  we have in the past pointed out how influential China is in relation to North Korea and I will continue to do that. The important thing is China has to date played a very constructive role.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is Beijing';s influence in Pyongyang exaggerated though?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don';t think it';s exaggerated. Every country acts according to its own national interest whether it';s North Korea or Australia or China or the United States.  But of countries around the world none has greater influence on North Korea than China.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you be asking for Chinese participation in a possible interception of North Korean ships…?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that issue is a little more in the background at present because the six-power talks have been organised and I think the emphasis is on a diplomatic solution at the present time.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you be carrying any messages from Richard Armitage from your talks from last week?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I';m not carrying any messages for anybody except messages from the Australian people and messages from my own government. We have a full blown very mature, very constructive relationship with China. We';ve seen the trebling of our exports I think over the last six or seven years, and of course we signed that landmark natural gas deal last year which is a huge mark of Chinese confidence in Australia as a reliable supplier.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, one of the reasons you';re here is to get acquainted with the Chinese new leadership.  What sort of things do you expect the Chinese leadership in future Chinese foreign policy in terms of North Korea and Taiwan?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well in relation to North Korea I said a moment ago that China';s played a very constructive role and I am sure that will continue. Our own one China policy is well known in Beijing. It';s been consistently stated over a number of years and that won';t change.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think [inaudible] for Iraq will be a topic of discussion?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you have any plans to talk about Burma and the Chinese leverage on the regime for the release of Suu Kyi?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it';s not as important as some of the other issues but it may well come up.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>human rights, will that be….?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we have a human rights dialogue and I will be indicating that we';re well pleased with the progress that';s being made on that.  It';s a much better way of achieving things on that front than the old habit of putting your hand up in favour of a resolution and never actually talking to each other about human rights.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>If it weren';t for SARS Prime Minister would you have made this visit a lot sooner?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, yes I would have.  I in fact had planned to go to the Boao Forum but that had to be put off. But I gather I';m amongst the first batch of leaders to meet the new Chinese leadership and that';s from my point of view an important mark and an important symbol of the significance that we attach to the relationship.  Thank you.</p>
