FOR PRESS: PM. NO. 104/ 1972<br />
NATURAL GAS PIPELINE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon.<br />
William McMahon, M. P.<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that he had been<br />
informed that substantial orders are being placed in Australia by<br />
East-Australian Pipeline Corporation Limited on account of<br />
Australian Gas Light Company for steel pipe to be used in the<br />
construction the main trunk and lateral lines for the Gipgealpa/<br />
Sydney natural gas pipeline.<br />
Negotiations had been proceeding for some time between<br />
East-Australian Pipeline Corporation Limited and local manufacturers<br />
on the question of whether these manufacturers could meet the<br />
required specifications for the steel pipe required for the main<br />
route. At the request of all parties the Department of Customs<br />
and Excise was involved in these negotiations.<br />
Following these negotiations and recent detailed<br />
investigations, East-Australian Pipeline Corporation is now satisfied<br />
that the Australian steel producers and pipe manufacturers are<br />
capable of meeting the technical specifications required for the<br />
pipe which is to be purchased from them.<br />
The Prime r'' ii. ster went. on to say that<br />
approximately 80 miles of the 34" nmin trunk line will be<br />
manufactured in Australia by Steel ains Limited from X63 steel<br />
plate to be produced in Australia. This is the total amount tendered<br />
for by the Company. Tubemakers of Australia Limited also has the<br />
basic capacity to produce steel pipe of 34" outer diameter and had<br />
been offered a contract for approximately 160 miles of the main<br />
trunk line the tent of the Company's capacity. I<br />
However, East-Australian Pipeline Corporation has also<br />
offered a cc^ tn: t to tubemakers for the su!] y. ly of ooroximately<br />
170 miles of steel pi-e of 20/ 22" outer diameter required for the<br />
gas distribution system and main lateral connections to other major<br />
centres in New South Wales. / 2 </p>
<p>The Company has advised that is is not possible for it to<br />
produce both lines in the time required and it has elected to<br />
manufacture the 20/ 22" line. The high strength steel plate for<br />
that contract will be supp~ lied from Australian ? roduction.<br />
The Prime Minister stated that he had also been advised<br />
that orders for the balance of the lateral and distribution lines<br />
will be placed in Aiustralia.<br />
All contracts -those let in Australia and in Japan<br />
provide the same guarantees as to warranty and performance to<br />
specification. The Prime Minister has been advised that because of the<br />
size of this contract and the delivery requirements it is not<br />
possible for one pipe manufacturer to supply the bulk of the<br />
contract which must be imported. The Australian Gas Light Company<br />
therefore proposes to impoort the bulk of the pipeline from three<br />
Japanese manufacturers.<br />
The Department of Customs and Excise has been examining an<br />
application for by-law admission of the steel pipe which had to<br />
be imported from Japan. By-law admission of imported goods<br />
subject to protective duties is only given if suitably equivalent<br />
goods are not reasonably available in Australia.<br />
Since the Australian Gas Light Company is obtaining in<br />
Australia all the pipe that can be made in this country within the<br />
required delivery period the Minister for Customs and Excise has<br />
approved duty free admission of the necessary imports.<br />
The Prime Minister commented that the matter had been<br />
resolved very successfully.<br />
The decision by the Australian Gas Light Company meant<br />
that Australian manufacturers and workers would be engaged in the<br />
production of as much of the pipe line as can be produced in<br />
Australia. In addition of course, Australians would be responsible<br />
for laying of the lines, at the same time the bulk of the pipe<br />
would be imported from Japan without the need to increase costs by<br />
attracting the normal duties.<br />
This imvortant Australian project would now go ahead<br />
with advantage to all parties concerned, manufacturers,<br />
unions and consumers.<br />
