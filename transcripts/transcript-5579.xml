PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA THURSDAY<br />
Joint Statement by the Prime Minister and Minister<br />
for Defence ,7 MAY .1981<br />
Defence Review<br />
Mr John Utz, Chairman and Chief Executive of Wormald-<br />
International Limited, will chair the major Review of Defence<br />
Qrganisationf announced by the Prime Minister as being part<br />
of the Review of Commonwealth Functions. The other members<br />
of the Review committee will be General Sir Arthur MacDonald,<br />
former Chief of the Defence Force Staff, now retired;<br />
Sir Frederick Wheeler, company director, former Head of the<br />
irreasury and former Chairman of the Public Service Board; and<br />
Mr Eric Neal, Chief Executive and Director of Boral Ltd.<br />
IThe Government is very pleased that these distinguished<br />
people are able to give their time to this important task, and.<br />
have so readily and willingly agreed to participate.<br />
The Review will assess the suitability of the higher<br />
defence organisation to propose and implement policy for the<br />
achievement of government defenc'e objectives.<br />
When the Royal Commission of Australian Government<br />
Administration reported in 1976, it noted that its enquiries<br />
had not touched on the defence area because at that time the<br />
amalgamation-of what had previously been five separate<br />
departments into the present single defence organisation was<br />
still under way. The Royal Commis ' sion recommended that, after<br />
a few years experience of the present pattern of defence<br />
administration, an independent body should be appointed to<br />
undertake a thorough study of the effectiveness of -the structural<br />
arrangements and their possible relevance to other-fields of<br />
Government responsibility.<br />
It is the Government's view that this is now an<br />
appropriate time to stand back and consider whether further<br />
improvements might be made, and in what respects.<br />
As already indicated in the Parliament, the terms of<br />
reference provided for the Review are:-<br />

machinery in the light of experience since the<br />
Defence reorganisation of 9 February 1976, with<br />
