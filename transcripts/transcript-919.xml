INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL<br />
" OMN'S BOARD MEETING HELD AT CANBERRA ON<br />
APRIL. 1964<br />
Speech by the Prime Minni: te. r L Rt, Hon, Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Madam President, Mr. Byrne, Your Excellencies and Ladies<br />
I feel completely unnerved ( Laughter) by two circumstances.<br />
The first is that when I was cajoled into coming here<br />
I use the word " cajoled" though I might have said " ordered" or<br />
" compelled" ( Laughter) I was under the slight misapprehension<br />
that this was a board meeting. Well, it is the biggest board of<br />
directors I have ever looked at in my life. ( Laughter)<br />
And the second unnerving circumstance is that today<br />
was, I think, one of the very few occasions that I can recall when<br />
I was marched into a roomful of women in complete and respectful<br />
silence, ( Applause) Those are two special circumstances but,<br />
of course, there is the overriding circumstance that for a man to<br />
stand up I exclude the idl. e members of the Diplomatic Corps<br />
( Laughter) before an audience of 40C women is a very great<br />
ordeal, believe me, because opinions differ as to whether men<br />
understand women or don't. I am one of the few fallows honest<br />
enough Uo admit that I don't and, therefore, I will just have to<br />
say something on my own account,<br />
" The decade of opportunity" this is a splendid topic,<br />
It would have been even better if I hadn't been reminded in the<br />
lobby outside that in 1951, I had made a profound obsorvation on<br />
this very matter an obvorsation that I had long since forgotten,<br />
but still, "' the decade of opportunity" that is a good title and<br />
more than a good title, a very good theme because it is<br />
constructive. It means that you are not here to ventilate the<br />
grievances of the past but to envisage the opportunities of the<br />
future. This, I think, is a thing equally valid for you as it<br />
would be for a corresponding number of men gathered together<br />
here. " The decade of opportunity".<br />
Now, I had a look at your objects and if I may quote<br />
a rather abbreviated snippet from them, I saw that one of the<br />
purposes is to provide information and assistance to achieve equal<br />
status for women in political life. Now, of course, countries<br />
vary, In Australia I believe that there is, for all practical<br />
purposes, an equality of status in political life. This varies,<br />
of course, from place to place, but in my own State of Victoria,<br />
and in the case of my own Party, the selection of candidates for<br />
Parliament is made by a convention of people representing equally<br />
men and women. The fact that they almost invariably select a<br />
man for a candidate is not my responsibility ( Laughter). I think<br />
there is, in substance, equality of status for women in political<br />
life but we can't end there, can we? Equality of status, I suppose,<br />
means equality of opportunity. We all, man or woman, have our<br />
chance, politically, by vote, by influence, by represenation in<br />
Parliament and so on. How far we take advantage of that opportunity<br />
is really a matter for us and not for other people,<br />
I want to say something to you about this question of<br />
politics, because although I am not quite as long in the tooth<br />
as a Prime Minister as you might suppose, I have still had some<br />
experience of it and I suppose I might be regarded as having some<br />
expert views in the political field, Quite true. I needed to be<br />
reminded that it is twentyfive years since I first became Prime<br />
Minister but I think that in justice to the people of Australia,<br />
it should be pointed out that two years and four months later I<br />
was relieved of the burden of office. ( Laughter) And that it / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
took another eight years for me to purge my offences and be once<br />
more admitted to this office, If_ you want to see a genuine<br />
quarter-century head of government, you want to go to South<br />
Australia and insist on them showing you Sir Thomas Playford who<br />
has been Premier of that State well, I think he was Premier<br />
before I first became Prime Minister of Australia and he has<br />
been Premier ever since and, so far as I can judge, only the Grim<br />
Reaper will remove him from office, ( Laughter)<br />
Howeverg even in my limited experience, something is<br />
learned and I thought I would like to say this to you that you<br />
are an international body, as we have been reminded that you<br />
have come here from a variety of countries some of them old<br />
in government and some of them new in independence and selfgovernment;<br />
it is just as well I think, for us to ask the<br />
question: What is involved in taking a hand in politics? And<br />
in particular, for a woman to take a hand in politics.<br />
I hope you will not think me offensive when I say<br />
that it is not sufficient for any woman just to stand up and<br />
say, " I am a woman. Parliament ought to have the women's point<br />
of view and therefore elect me to Parliament", because I would<br />
be most astonished to discover that there is any more unanimity<br />
of view among ten women than there is among ten men. ( Laughter)<br />
I don't undertake to say at any time what the man's point of view<br />
is but I know what my own is, mostly, but I don't undertake to<br />
generalise and I think it is a mistake to generalise,<br />
The first thing to do about politics is to understand<br />
quite soon that this is a business of the utmost seriousness,<br />
It lends itself to fun occasionally, to a little genial abuse<br />
occasionally, but it is a matter of the utmost seriousness. It<br />
is the business of the nation and if the business of the nation<br />
is to be conducted with skill, with understanding, with humanity,<br />
then there are some things that must be learned about ito<br />
Not at all sufficient for any one of us to go into Parliament and<br />
say, " I don't need to know any of the basic elements of p. olitics<br />
I come here to argue for so-and-so and this I will continue to<br />
argue for until I achieve it. It may be right; it may be<br />
wrong, but that's my theme."<br />
Now I believe, in my own old-fashioned way, that you<br />
can't begin to understand the politics of a country and therefore<br />
to participate in politics of that country unless you know the<br />
true structure of government in that country until you really<br />
know what is the machinery by which that particular nation has<br />
chosen to get itself a government and to get itself law3s This<br />
is where all the variety is met.<br />
Here we are in Australia. We are a Federation. We<br />
have six States who were, until 1901, self-governing colonies<br />
completely attending to their own affairs and then we had a<br />
Federal Parliament and a Federal Goverinent which has some<br />
specific powers of a national kind entrusted to it, all the other<br />
powers remaining with the States. Now this is a complex system<br />
of government, Highly complex. It is a highly legalistic<br />
system of government because as somebody says that the Conmonwealth<br />
Parliament has part of the law which it had no power to<br />
pass, it is liable to find itself in the High Court of Australia,<br />
corresponding to the Supreme Court of the United States of<br />
America and having its law declared invalid. You can't separate<br />
a good deal of logalism from federalism, but you can't begin to<br />
understand the political problems of Australia without first<br />
understanding that it is a country with a federal system and<br />
that powers are divided between the national Parliament and the<br />
State Parliaments. You don't solve problems as people very 00 / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
freauent. ly try to in Australia by taking then all to Canberra,<br />
( Laughter) because most of the problens that people want to take<br />
to Canberra ought never to cono he,. e a t c: ll; they belong to the<br />
State Parliament or the State Govorn( mnt or the municipal council<br />
or municipal governmrent. Even in our oe. n countryvhere we have now<br />
sixty-odd years of experience, there are far too many people who<br />
undertake to talk about politics who just dontt understand the<br />
structure of government, the division of power, the division of<br />
authority and therefore the division of responsibility in a<br />
federal system. Those who come from the United States know a<br />
great deal more about this because the United States has a federal<br />
system. I will say something nore about that in a moment because<br />
there again, there are plenty of opportunities for error and<br />
nisunderstanding, Now, our great neighbour, New Zealand, intimately<br />
associated with Australia, has two advantages, if I might put<br />
it that way, and I think they would put it that way from their<br />
point of view, One is that they have none of this problem of<br />
legalism because they do not have a federal system. They have a<br />
unitary government, Rightly or wrongly, they have one government<br />
over one people. That is a very great advantage to then from the<br />
point of view of simplicity, of understanding the political scene.<br />
I am not saying that the sane system would apply to Australia<br />
because I don't think it would. And of course there are other<br />
great advantages that we, being fairly near and somewhat larger,<br />
they are able to tell us their opinion of us with complete<br />
friendliness and with great effect, ( Laughter)<br />
Now I said that if you take the United States, you<br />
have another federal system of government with a division of<br />
powers between Washington and the various American States. If<br />
you go further afield into other countries, other countries in<br />
the British Commonwealth, you will find an almost infinite variety<br />
of systems of government, some of them with a high centralisation<br />
of power in the executive, some of them not, but I defy anybody<br />
to identify the system of government in almost any one of them<br />
with the system of government in any other and that of course is<br />
right. That is as it should be because you don't make people<br />
independent in order to compel thoe to adopt your system of<br />
government; that is a denial of independence and when people<br />
become independent, they have a perfect right to choose their<br />
own system of marrging their affairs and they nay choose to do it<br />
by a concentration of power in the central executive that would<br />
be intolerable to us in Australia or they may find some middle<br />
course, but whatever it is, it is theirs.<br />
There is a good deal of false optimism in the world<br />
about this matter, People are very tempted to think particularly<br />
in some of the great Western countries that all you have to do<br />
with a former colony now to become an independent nation is to<br />
endow it with a parliament, or whatever it might be called and all<br />
is well you have established a new system of government. Of<br />
course you haven't because all systems of government proceed from<br />
the ground up. They grow; they are not built from the roof<br />
down; they are not imposed on people. They have to be, in the<br />
long run, the choice of the people themselves. Therefore there<br />
is an infinite variety of ways and means of a country governing<br />
itself. Having said that, I just want to turn back very<br />
briefly to what I was saying about the United States of America,<br />
a country held in great respect and affection in Australia, a<br />
country to whom we are bound by many -agnificent ties, but we<br />
are quite capable of misunderstanding Americans and American </p>
<p>administratlion just in the same way as in London there is always<br />
adanger that ww-: 1: e. 1 be a gravoe nii.-, s-,-, dcrstanding of American<br />
policy and in Washington-a gralic i-in21sndrstanding of British<br />
policy. This used to trouble me a great deal wondering how this<br />
came about, how could there be any instinctive opposition between<br />
people so close, so identified in their ultimate ideals and in<br />
a great deal of their history. How could there be this, as an<br />
instinctive matter; why did this irritation arise; why was it<br />
that every few years you would find such an uproar going on in<br />
London and'in Washington that you would ' think the two countries<br />
were going to become inveterate enemies., We have all seen this<br />
happen, haven't we. And I have a theory about it.<br />
My theory is that people have neglected the first<br />
lesson to be learned in politics and that is to understand the<br />
structure of government to understand h~ ow policies are evolved<br />
and how they a. 3' e pi~ t inio ' operation, because if you do that, you<br />
will at once realise that the American procedure and the British<br />
procedure are utterly unlike and until people on my side understand<br />
the differences, they will tend to misunderstand the results and<br />
misunderstand the circumstarnces. Just let me explain what I mean<br />
and in this respect, what I say about the United Kingdom is<br />
equally true about my own country because we derive our governmental<br />
Pystem from the Old Country. All right.<br />
How does a policy become evolved, a public policy<br />
on some informational matter particularly? How does that become<br />
evolved in London? By a Cabinet, they have a Cabinet meeting.<br />
The Foreign Minister circulates papers about his particular<br />
problems, about nation X Y or Z. They all have an opportunity<br />
of reading them. The red boxes go round and the hav their<br />
keys and they read them. Then they arrive at the Cabinet meeting,<br />
and then they discuss what the policy ought to be, and at the end<br />
of the Cabinet meeting, that has been determined, It is no<br />
longer the policy of an individual, it is the policy of the<br />
Government of the United Kingdom, delibera-tely, carefully worked<br />
out and therefore when it is announced, people may accept it,<br />
sub3ect to the inf rmi-ty of politicians who do occasionally<br />
change their minds, I know, but people will accept that as the<br />
policy on this problem of Great Britain,<br />
If some private Member of Parliament makes an<br />
extravagant speech, either on the extreme right wing or the extreme<br />
left wings and, you know, these wings are projected in all<br />
parliaments6, nobody need assume that what he says is the policy<br />
of Great Britain indeedton the contrary everybody in Groat<br />
Britain knows that it isnt the policy of Lhe Government because<br />
if it wore the policy of the Government, he wouldn't bother to<br />
make the speech. He has made his speech to exhibit his difference<br />
not his agreement, and the result is nobody really assumes that<br />
because this type of extravaganza is engaged in, one way or the<br />
other? that that has anything to do with the poiicy of Great<br />
Britain. That is true in Australia,<br />
Now7in the United States, their system of evolving<br />
policy is quite different. They evolve policy far more through<br />
the process of public debate than we do in British countries.<br />
Take an examplo. The Secretary of State, the Foreign Minister<br />
of the United States, a great functionary, he is, in the eye of<br />
the world, the man who expresses and is responsible for the<br />
foreign policy of the United States but very frequently before<br />
he has time or opportunity to come Lo a conclusion the matter is<br />
taken up before a Committee of Congress -Foreign Affairs<br />
Committee, Foreign Relations Committee -and he is there crossexamined,<br />
very frequently publicly, about how his mind is running,<br />
how it works. Then somebody else comes along who is the majority<br />
leader in the Senate or who is a very prominent Memaber of the House<br />
0~ M 0 0 </p>
<p>of' Representatives, and he is called before the Committee and all<br />
this is thrashed out, you see, day aftcr day, day after day, in<br />
public, so that the policy on -this matter perhaps begins to emerge<br />
as a result of public discussion, because this is public discussion<br />
if the press people are there and not uncommonly the television<br />
people. Now in Great Britain, where they are accustomed to<br />
the habit of pronouncement, they read this. They say, " O0h,<br />
well, did you see what so-and-so said? He is the majority leader<br />
in the Senato and this is what they are going to And when<br />
the following day it turns out that somebody equally authoritative<br />
has said to the same Committee that exactly the opposite is what<br />
they want to do, a feeling arises I have seen this happen<br />
that there is too much fluctuation in policy. " All this variation,<br />
why don't they make up their minds," wlhereas the truth is, of'<br />
course, that this is part of the process of making up the mind and<br />
nobody ought ever to get excited about it until the end result,<br />
The late John Foster Dulles was a friend of mine and<br />
he was a man of great character; very contrcversiai, I agree,<br />
but a man of great character and of high patriotism, I knew him<br />
well, but Foster Dulles liked to have public conferences and<br />
public discussion, Well, each man to his choice; he liked this,<br />
but he used to think aloud at these conferences, I have twitted<br />
him at this in the past. He used to think aloud, He used to<br />
say, " 1Well, now, ask a question. Look, one thing we could do<br />
about this would be so-and-so" and he would explain that with<br />
great clarity arnd the gentleman from the Indianapolis Gazette<br />
or whatever ii might be if that line suited his papers, would<br />
rush out and put it on Lo the wires. Perhaps before two minutes<br />
had gone, Foster Dulles, still thinking aloud, would say, " Well,<br />
on the other hand...." 1 and he would give the benefit of his<br />
views to the conference, discussing three or four alternative<br />
possibilities. ' dell, now, this I concede at once, was very good, if<br />
all reported from a public educational point of view. It would<br />
help people Lo understand what the possibilities were on th . s<br />
matter, but of course in the result, view No. 1 would be in the<br />
afternoon newspapers somewhere and view No. 2 in the morning<br />
papers some-where and view No. 3 in the following afternoon's<br />
papers because these are the rules of life. And the result was,<br />
a lot of people used to say, " Why doesntt he stick to one<br />
policy? Why doesn't he keep his mind clear? Why all this<br />
wavering around?" And I would frequently have to explain to<br />
people that it wasn'ft that at all, that when he reached his<br />
conclusions, he reached a firm concliusion and his technique,<br />
though well understood in the United States, wasn't understood<br />
at all in Great Britain or in Australia.<br />
Now, I dontt want to convert this into a series of<br />
historical reminiscences but I just want to establish the one<br />
point that I wanted to make to you that if you want to lead up to<br />
a more complete approach to politics and political activity for<br />
women, then to begin with you must understand something about<br />
the system of government In your own country and, if possible,<br />
something of the comparative systems of government in the world,<br />
because if we all understood them, clearly, we would be saved a<br />
great deal of misunderstanding and occasionally a certain amount<br />
of ill temper. In short, this business of politics is not just<br />
a matter of making speeches about some current or casual problem.<br />
The business of politics is the business of government and it<br />
can't be conducted with skill or with safety unless the people<br />
who are engaged in it understand the foundations of their science / 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
and their art as well as its particular app] icauions at any given<br />
momento Now hcat all nay seen very dull but I remember<br />
many years ago reading a book by, I think, Stephen Leacock.<br />
It night well be because it was a very wise and cnusing book.<br />
He pointed out that in one part of the United States of America<br />
where he lived once, he encountered a judge who, whenever there<br />
was any family occasion a wedding, a funeral, a christening,<br />
a jolly get-together always arranged to have himself called on<br />
to speak and always gave a short but powerfil talk on the American<br />
Constitution. ( Laughter) There is a lot tr-be said for that old<br />
judge. I hope not to be so tedious as that but I thought the<br />
opportunity should not pass without ny suggesting that there are<br />
basic elements in all these things which should not be neglected,<br />
And having said that at undue length, I now I<br />
was going to say have great pleasure in declaring the conference<br />
open, but I have great pleasure in declaring the Board open. </p>
