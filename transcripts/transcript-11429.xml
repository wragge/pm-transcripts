<p>To the Premier in Western Australia, Richard Court, to my ministerial</p>
<p> colleague, Wilson Tuckey, to Cheryl Edwards. And also can I say to</p>
<p> all of the advisers little stunts like that of course will get a bit</p>
<p> of coverage but they will not deter the Australian Government or the</p>
<p> Western Australian Government from informing the Australian people</p>
<p> and most particularly the people of Western Australia that the Regional</p>
<p> Forest Agreement is a very balanced result between jobs and the protection</p>
<p> of important forests.</p>
<p>It is the product of detailed scientific analysis and extensive community</p>
<p> consultation. The RFA in Western Australia protects more than two-thirds</p>
<p> Â I repeat, more than two-thirds Â of the region's</p>
<p> old growth forest, provides 12 new national parks and 25 additions</p>
<p> to existing parks, and over 150,000 hectares of new formal reserves</p>
<p> are established. Importantly, industry will benefit from 20 years</p>
<p> of resource security and the removal of export impediments.</p>
<p>The RFA contains a combined $59 million timber, tourism and regional</p>
<p> industry development package to which both the Federal Government</p>
<p> and the Western Australian Government have made contributions.</p>
<p>So the package will focus particularly on the Nannup, Pemberton and</p>
<p> Manjimup region to ensure not only the maintenance of a viable timer</p>
<p> industry but also the expansion of the tourism industry. The WA timber</p>
<p> industry has the potential to create around 500 extra jobs in the</p>
<p> region over this period.</p>
<p>Can I just conclude this introductory remark by saying that I recognise</p>
<p> that there has been an intense debate in Western Australia. In all</p>
<p> of these cases it is the desire of the national Government to get</p>
<p> a fair balance between conservation values and job security. We are</p>
<p> slave to neither one or other side of the argument. We will never</p>
<p> take decisions that will wilfully destroy Australian jobs in regional</p>
<p> areas of our country but I think our record both here in East Gippsland,</p>
<p> elsewhere in Victoria and in Tasmania demonstrates very strongly that</p>
<p> we have a commitment to environmental values.</p>
<p>I want to personally thank my two Ministers, Robert Hill the Minister</p>
<p> for the Environment, and Wilson Tuckey who is the Minister for Forests.</p>
<p> Both of them have worked very hard with their State counterparts to</p>
<p> get this result. And I also to you Richard want to thank you for the</p>
<p> very constructive leadership role that you have discharged in Western</p>
<p> Australia and I am very pleased that we are signing an agreement which</p>
<p> is fair and balanced. There'll be some noise from narrow interest</p>
<p> groups but I am sure the broader population in Western Australia will</p>
<p> see this as a very balanced and fair outcome.</p>
<p> [Premier Court speaks]</p>
<p>Before I depart could I just say again to you, Mr Premier and to your</p>
<p> colleagues, thank you very much. This has been a very good example</p>
<p> of co-operation between the Commonwealth and the State of Western</p>
<p> Australia over an issue which has generated a great deal of debate,</p>
<p> a great deal of emotion and an enormous amount of media coverage not</p>
<p> only in Western Australia but throughout the country.</p>
<p>And I am delighted that we have now signed the fourth of the Regional</p>
<p> Forest Agreements, we still have quite a number to go. I hesitate</p>
<p> to say it but I don't think any might prove as difficult or protracted</p>
<p> as this one and it's even more credit to you and to your colleagues</p>
<p> and to my two Ministers that we have had such a balanced outcome.</p>
<p> I agree with you, it can't be black and white. I think it's</p>
<p> a fair package, it protects jobs, it protects the industry, it is</p>
<p> sensitive to the environment and it's a great credit to our Ministers.</p>
<p> So I will leave this link up, I thank you and I will leave it to the</p>
<p> Ministers to sign the other parts of the agreement.</p>
