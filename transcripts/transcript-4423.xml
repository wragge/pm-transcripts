PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS<br />
ADDRESS BY PRIME MINISTER AT DINNER IN BRUSSELS 16 JUNE 1977<br />
I thank you for your kind words and warm welcome. It is a great<br />
pleasure for me to visit your country, a nation with which Australia<br />
has many interests in common, and with which we have sound and<br />
friendly relations.<br />
Geographically, our countries are almost as far apart as two<br />
countries can be, and our experiences have been very different.<br />
You have always been at the centre of international affairs. once<br />
you were on the frontier between two hostile European powers the<br />
cockpit of Europe. Now you are the heart and headquarters of the<br />
European Community.<br />
A generation ago, by contrast, Australia was situated outside the<br />
main currents of international politics, although our fighting men<br />
have more than once earned us a place in the peace council of the<br />
world. We have been influenced greatly by remoteness and isolation,<br />
by what one Australian historian has called the tyranny of distance.<br />
These dif ferences have been lessened by changing patterns of international-<br />
politics by technology, and by increasing interdependence.<br />
They have always been less important than the values and interests<br />
we share.<br />
Belgium and Australia are among the comparatively small number of<br />
genuinely democratic countries which exist in the world today.<br />
Your recorded history is iftuch longer than ours. The establishment<br />
of modern Belgium however almost coincides with the history of<br />
European settlement in Australia; and our democratic institutions<br />
have developed in parallel.<br />
These institutions differ in detail, but in both cases they are<br />
structured to make political leaders responsible to the people;<br />
to preserve and strengthen individual liberty and provide the<br />
conditions for enterprise and achievement. And not only have our<br />
democratic institutions shown a broadly similar development, but<br />
our societies and economies are much the same. Twice this century,<br />
our two countries, along with the other democracies, have fought to<br />
preserve their liberty. We were successful because, under challenge<br />
we have found the will and the unity necessary to survive.<br />
Today, the democracies face different challenges both domestic<br />
and international the military power of authoritarian regimes is<br />
growing; the democracies are facing a period of economic difficulty<br />
and rapid social change; greater and sometimes unrealistic demands<br />
are-made of democratic governments. / If the </p>
<p>2<br />
If the democracies are to meet the challenges they face, they will<br />
have to do so collectively, not in isolation. They will have to<br />
appreciate their interdependence, state clearly and confidently their<br />
common interests and values and formulate effective policies in<br />
terms of them.<br />
This world outlook should not, and cannot, be left to the great<br />
democratic powers alone. I believe that countries like Australia and<br />
Belgium have an important part to play. Our stake in the outcome is<br />
as great and our responsibility is as clear. In shaping an adequate<br />
democratic response to these challenges Belgium's role is a vital one.<br />
Your country has been amongst the most imaginative and energetic proponents<br />
of a united Western Europe. Given the background of centuries<br />
of conflict, the movement towards Western European unity has been<br />
impressive.<br />
Australia, for her part, has given and will continue to give firm support<br />
to the achievement of greater unity amongst Western European democracies.<br />
The substantial progress made in the last decades perhaps makes it understandable<br />
that Europeans have mainly concentrated on their own affairs.<br />
But the situation that now faces us calls for an outward looking Europe<br />
one which sees its role in global terms.<br />
Most of the world's democracies are located in Western Europe and without<br />
their full and active commitment the democratic view in international<br />
affairs will be seriously attenuated.<br />
I hope that the Community's potential for contributing to the resolution<br />
of major international problems, to the development of the international<br />
economic system, and to an expansion of world trade, will be fully<br />
realised. Belgium has not only been one of the great architects of<br />
Western European unity, but it has also been one of the strong supporters<br />
and most active participants in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.<br />
While Australia's immediate security interests lie especially in Asia and<br />
the Pacific, we always have been closely interested in European security<br />
arrangements. For despite our location, we are very aware of Europe's<br />
strategic importance and the contribution the European Community makes<br />
to the North Atlantic community and to the present global balance. All<br />
democracies I believe are becoming increasingly aware that national<br />
security cannot be safeguarded in one area alone but must be looked at<br />
on a global basis; that our strength does not lie in any one region<br />
North America, Europe or Japa~ n but in our collective strength and will.<br />
We need to foster this awareness and avoid narrow, exclusively regional<br />
preoccupations to be aware of the impact of our decisions not only on<br />
our own country, but on the rest of the world. If we do not do this<br />
then we run the risk of damaging the interests we all have in common.<br />
I am in the happy position of visiting a country with which we have very<br />
good relations. We hope to see these relationships continue to grow to<br />
the mutual benefit of both our countries. We will take every<br />
opportunity to strengthen our relations in all respects. </p>
