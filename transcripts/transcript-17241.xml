    <content><![CDATA[<p>PM: It's great to be here in Penguin. It's great to be here in Tassie, and great to be here to talk about the economy and jobs, and great to be here to celebrate the success of local small businesses which have become medium businesses. And what we've seen is that at work today with this great business here, in this part of regional Tasmania. We're here with the Tasmanian Government, and of course, with Sid Sidebottom, our local Member, and the Industry Minister, Kim Carr, and the local state Member, to talk about how the Australian Government can assist with local business, local jobs, making a difference for local families.</p>
<p>You know, the first business of Government is to keep the economy strong. That's why we acted decisively in the onset of the global financial crisis to make sure through our national economic stimulus strategy that we would keep the economy going and protect jobs when they were being lost by the millions around the world. And the result- the Australian economy, unique among the major advanced economies around the world, kept- was kept from going into recession. We kept growing positively. We've ended up with the second lowest unemployment of all the major advanced economies, with the lowest debt and the lowest deficit.</p>
<p>That is the report card of this Government on the economy. By the way, I noticed my political opponent says we should pull the rug from under that, that we should cancel the Government's national economic infrastructure stimulus strategy. I don't think Mr Abbott realises the impact that has in pulling the rug from under the economy nationally, but critically, in regional Australia as well. Which brings me to what we're talking about here today.</p>
<p>The people in northern, north western Tasmania have been doing it really tough because of what's happened with the global financial crisis. It's not their fault. What's happened here, in many cases, has been a result of global factors at work. But as a result, many people in this region have lost their jobs over the last year or so. Now, you can either just turn your back on that and say not my problem. Or, if you're in the business of Government and making a difference, you say what can we do to practically be of assistance, and to help local businesses who are out there having a go, like the one we're with here this morning, Penguin Composites.</p>
<p>This is a great story of a local small business at work. This is a business, I'm advised, which began in the 80's, have I got it right guys? Moved in the 70s, moved in the 90s, they started with that shed down the bottom of the hill, and as things have expanded they moved up the hill. And what we see is an increasingly diversified small business, medium sized business here in regional Tasmania selling products to all parts of Australia. This is a good story, made possible by all these workers and apprentices over here who we've met as well this morning.</p>
<p>So the business of Government is how can we take what this firm is already doing and lend a helping hand on the way through, in particular in regions which have been doing it tough. And that's why today, with the Government of Tasmania, we are announcing 36 successful projects which have been decided upon between our Government and the Tasmanian Government as part of the overall stimulus strategy for northwest and northern Tasmania, this Innovation and Investment fund for northern Tasmania.</p>
<p>These 36 projects, of which this one here at Penguin Composites is one, will create about 400 local jobs. And it's based on a partnership. What we invest is also partnered with the investments by the local businesses themselves. And of course, in this project here, we're looking at an investment of $1.3 million to expand workshop capacity at two sites, to fund new plant and equipment, and generating about 46 new jobs. This company makes fibreglass, composite and metal products for industry applications, and I've had some time to look very closely at some of the innovation which is underway here. And it's really, really exciting stuff.</p>
<p>So we'd like to be partners in your future progress. Partners in your expansion of jobs here. Partners in the expansion of your export opportunities around the world, with sales to the Australian mainland as well. This is, however, one example of a partnership. Looking more broadly across just this immediate area as well, Forth Farm Produce of Forth will receive investment of over $2 million to construct and fit out a purpose-built broccoli and bean grading and packing facility, expected to generate 54 new jobs.</p>
<p>VEC Civil Engineering of Ulverstone, awarded over $1 million in investment to develop new precast beds for the construction industry and the purchasing of equipment. The project is expected to create 30 new jobs.</p>
<p>Greenham Tasmania, of Smithton, awarded over $1.1 million to expand its meat processing facilities to increase capacity and facilitate the development of a new range of value-added beef products, a project which we anticipate will create 25 new jobs. Now, each of these, you might say, is small. But you know something, from little things, big things grow. And you see that with businesses like this. And if we can provide a helping hand on the way through, to become co-investors in the success of these businesses, then I think we're doing some good things for this local community, for this region of Tasmania, and for regional Australia more broadly.</p>
<p>Sid Sidebottom, the local Member, has been in my ear and Kim Carr's ear about the absolute importance of these projects to make a difference in a part of regional Australia which has been doing it tough. So we're proud to be partners with Sid, the State Government, local businesses, 36 of them that we're announcing today, to get out there and make a difference for local jobs, supporting local families.</p>
<p>Of course, part and parcel of all that, as I said, is keeping the economy strong. Part and parcel of that means keeping in touch with local communities like this as well. So the second thing I'd like to announce today is that the Australian Government will be conducting its next Community Cabinet here in the northwest, here in Tasmania. This'll be in Burnie, in the month of May. Sid will be doing the catering personally. And- oh, sorry, you didn't know that - Sid will be assisting with the catering personally, and he'll be doing the community barbecue.</p>
<p>So we're going to bring the entire Cabinet to Burnie, and we're going to sit down for an extended period of time, not just in a formal session for a couple of hours where we take questions from the floor- but more importantly, with Ministers from right across the Government going out and speaking to local businesses, local community organisations, Local Government, and working out what we can do more to be of partnership with the good folk of this area, and the businesses who are helping make it tick over.</p>
<p>The last thing I'd say before inviting the Premier to speak as well is it's Sid's birthday, so be kind to him with the questions today. You can rip in to him tomorrow.</p>
<p>BARTLETT: Thank you Prime Minister. Well, if I might just add again my thanks for seeing the Prime Minister here on the northwest coast. Yesterday we spent some time in some of Tasmania's hospitals that will benefit significantly from the generationally significant hospital health reforms that the Prime Minister has led. And it's a great pleasure also now to be able to announce together with the Prime Minister these 36 projects across the north and northwest of Tasmania, an area as you heard has been hit by the global financial crisis, but it is an area also that has great resilience, its people have great resilience, and the other great characteristic of coasters, northwest coasters particularly, is their spirit of innovation.</p>
<p>I have just had myself sworn in as Tasmania's first Minister for Innovation, Science and Technology, and I will be spending a lot of my time on the northwest coast working with innovative firms like this, and many others on the list that the Prime Minister and I have announced today, in developing their innovative capacity to build productivity and to build export markets, and therefore jobs for Tasmanians. We are back on the job, and it is a great pleasure to be back on the job with the Prime Minister, and with the local Members Sid and Brenton- who I've appointed as my Parliamentary Secretary- with specific focus on the northwest economy, and northwest jobs.</p>
<p>That is our commitment going forward, with the Federal Government, to ensure that the northwest economy remains robust, continues to work its way through the challenges that no doubt events like McCain, like the pulp, have had the impacts- work its way through, remains robust, and continues to produce jobs and job certainty and job security for the people of this area. Thank you Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PM: Thanks very much Premier, and just before we take your questions, the driving force behind all this at the national level has of course been the Industry and Innovation Minister, Kim Carr. And I'd thank him, personally, and publicly, for the work he's done.</p>
<p>This is very detailed work. Lots of submissions from lots of firms right across this region, and I think, Kim, you've had to sift through more than 100 together with your advisers and officials, and make sure they come up to scratch. So in terms of the success of this northern Tasmania Innovation and Investment fund, the driving force has been the Industry Minister Kim Carr, I'll ask him to say a few things, and then we'll take your questions.</p>
<p>CARR: Well, thank you Kevin. Can I just indicate that the Department of Innovation is very, very proud of the projects that we have announced today. And I want to thank the officers that are here today that have facilitated that these processes have been undertaken so smoothly, and so thoroughly. But can I just say that the real genesis for this project, Prime Minister, if I might just correct you slightly, is Sid Sidebottom.</p>
<p>Sid Sidebottom came to me with a delegation of Mayors from right across the region, came across to Melbourne and said look, Kim, we've got a serious problem, a very serious problem. There was a lot of speculation about the future of the pulp and paper industry. A lot of speculation about big manufacturing plants across the north and the northwest of the state. And he said, well, you people are- you know, as a Government we've said that we are committed to standing shoulder to shoulder with working families. What does that mean for me locally? What does that mean for the people that are losing their jobs?</p>
<p>And what Sid has driven through to the Government nationally is us making sure we pay attention, pay attention to that fundamental commitment of standing shoulder to shoulder with working families in periods of great difficulty. And together with the State Government, we've found the willingness to actually put our money where our mouth is, to come with solid projects, and 126 projects have come forward- we were very, very surprised at the strength and the quality of the projects. We are certain that this is a model that works, which we've used in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>Thanks to Sid, we've had two things done as a result of those discussions. Firstly, the establishment of this innovation investment fund, and secondly the establishment of the pulp and paper industry strategy group, which has now led to the establishment of the pulp and paper innovation council as we move forward to deal with the very significant problems that we face in practical ways, in ways that ensures that blue-collar workers that know that they've got a friend in Canberra, a friend here in the Tasmanian Government and they know with our local members of parliament, a determination to ensure that everybody gets a fair cut of the action.</p>
<p>PM: OK, thanks very much, folks, and now over to you.</p>
<p>That's terrific. Well, thank you. Goodbye. I'm off.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, I think after (inaudible) people are a little nervous about how this money will be spent. Are the checks and balances (inaudible)?</p>
<p>PM: Well, these projects have been carefully evaluated by the Industry Department. On the specific evaluation processes I'll turn to the Industry Minister for comment.</p>
<p>CARR: Can I just indicate that the selection process is made up of representatives from the State Government, representatives from the Department of Innovation, through AusIndustry, and local, independent business consultation. We're very, very confident about the quality of the projects, the capacity to manage these projects, because we've done it in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>We know it works and we know that there is the 430 jobs that we're seeing directly as a result of these jobs, we'll see new investment into the region, new opportunities for the region and we'll see, as a result of that, further investment that'll come from these things.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: (inaudible) where are you at with regional cancer services for Braddon?</p>
<p>PM: Well, because our friends in the State Government have taken a little bit of time to sort out who the government was going to be, and that's been very much in the in-tray of His Excellency, the Governor of Tasmania, but I am reliably informed resolved in the last 48 hours - otherwise I don't know what I'm doing standing here with David - we've actually both here and in South Australia delayed those announcements to make sure that the governments are sworn in in both those states. Now we'll work on the detail of those announcements. I think we are on track to do that before long.</p>
<p>Sid has been very strong on the fact that we need to see more oncology services across the North West. I understand that. We are, as a government, committed fundamentally to improving the delivery of cancer services to regional Australia. We are the first government in the country's history to roll out more than half a billion dollars worth of investment in radiation oncology services, in chemotherapy, in linear accelerators, in PET scanners, etcetera right across regional Australia - 22 different locations. These are in states and territories except Tassie and South Australia so far.</p>
<p>The commitment's there. We get it. Too many people defer their treatment for cancer if they live in regional areas because the travel just gets them down, and I think it is just wrong in Australia that people who live outside the major cities are three times more likely to die of cancer within five years of diagnosis than those who live in the major cities. It is just wrong, and one of the reasons we are turning this around is because we think everyone in the country should have a fair go. We believe that's the case when it comes to industry and jobs. We also believe it when it comes to health services.</p>
<p>It's one of the reasons why we're rolling out this new National Health and Hospitals Network - funded nationally, run locally to deliver better hospital and health services on the ground.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, home insulation employers say they've been misled. They're saying you assured them in February there would be another program. Did you mislead them?</p>
<p>PM: The conclusions of Minister Combet is that, consistent with what he and the Government have said previously is that safety is the first priority. We've been very mindful of the advice which has been contained in the report done by Dr Allan Hawke, a former senior official of the Australian Government and previous Australian governments, and therefore we must make sure that we continue to complete the inspection program, complete the rectification program and deal with the problems which have arisen.</p>
<p>I'm also advised by Minister Combet that the work associated with that program will be very substantial. He's been in very close contact with those involved in the industry. This, we think, is, based on Minister Combet's advice and the conclusions of Dr Hawke, the right course of action in these circumstances.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Tony Abbott is saying that your decision to roll back childcare places is (inaudible) for working families (inaudible)?</p>
<p>PM: I think what you need to have a look at is prior to the last election we said that we would increase the childcare tax rebate for working families from 30 percent to 50 percent. Now, this is a huge increase and the Government has delivered every bit of that when it comes to actually paying for or helping families pay for their childcare services. That's there, that's out there, it's being received.</p>
<p>The second point goes to the question of the availability of childcare centres. What's fundamentally changed here is, over the last four or five years, is the pace of the roll out of centres anyway through the private sector. There has been, I think, I'm advised, something like a 21 percent increase in the number of centres which have been rolled out. I think, from memory, the number of additional centres that has been rolled out over the last several years is something like a thousand. I think I'm right to say that in the period ahead we're looking at another 250 or so to be rolled out from the private sector.</p>
<p>Our view as a Government is that the private sector is out there doing its job and providing those extra centres, and that's what the private sector should be doing.</p>
<p>We have rolled out a number, particularly in areas of particular need. I've visited some, for example, which deal with the challenges, for example, of young children who are suffering from various forms of autism, various other categories of disability. These are very important things to do.</p>
<p>If the private sector is rolling out at a greater pace than was clear before, then it's a good thing that these centres are being rolled out. As I said, the core thing for mums and dads out there is to make sure that we do everything possible as a Government to underpin the affordability of quality childcare, and the core of that lies in us as a Government committing prior to the last election to increase the childcare rebate from 30 percent to 50 percent. We've honoured that to the letter. That's been done for some time now.</p>
<p>As for the physical availability of centres, the private sector is stepping up to the plate much more rapidly than I think most people would have considered possible before.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Why was Kate Ellis given the job of handing down that bad news, because you said in February you would be responsible for both the good and the bad in (inaudible)?</p>
<p>PM: Well, can I say very unequivocally that as the Prime Minister of the country I am accountable for what this Government does and that includes things that go according to plan and things where there are changes, and things where there are problems - I accept full responsibility for that, don't change that one bit.</p>
<p>We also have a system of ministerial accountability and responsibility where individual ministers take charge of particular areas of responsibility within the government, and Mr Combet in one area and Kate Ellis in the other, that's as it should be, but as far as me being accountable for things that go right and things that go wrong, that hasn't changed one bit.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: When was the Government informed that the NRL was taking action on the Storm?</p>
<p>PM: Found out sometime yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: (inaudible)</p>
<p>PM: This is, I said this earlier this morning - when I first heard about this yesterday afternoon I didn't believe it, firstly. The second thing was, having been told twice or three times what had happened, I was, like most Australians, just stunned by it - just stunned. I mean, I'm a patron of the Broncos in Brisbane and I've met a lot of these players over a long period of time now. I think all fans of the great game of rugby league will feel really let down by this, really let down. I feel really deeply for Melbourne Storm supporters. If there's any group of more loyal supporters I don't know where you'd find them and they'd be feeling absolutely gutted by this, so I think the NRL has made a tough decision but they've made the right decision in terms of the future of the game and the integrity of the game.</p>
<p>All these football codes have rules, and they only work and the public only have confidence in the game when the rules are being upheld, and the rules haven't been upheld here. People feel cheated, cheated badly - fans feel cheated, the other players feel cheated, I think the game itself has been cheated as well.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: What's the Government's advice Australians planning to travel to Thailand?</p>
<p>PM: We have been following events in Thailand very closely. The Department of Foreign Affairs has recently, I'm advised, changed the travel advisory for Australian citizens and the advice now from the Department of Foreign Affairs is that people should reconsider their need to travel.</p>
<p>Can I say this very clearly to all Australians who are thinking about travelling to Thailand and those who are there: read carefully, very carefully, the evolving travel advice of the Australian Government. We do not write these things up there on a whim. We are following events closely in Thailand. We have many Australians in Thailand and many who regularly travel there. When we say in our travel advisory you should reconsider your need to travel, we mean that.</p>
<p>This is a very dangerous and explosive situation in Thailand and we need to be very, very careful that Australians don't get caught up in any trouble. We know that we've already had one Australian injured on April 22 when a bomb exploded at a train station in Bangkok. There's a lot of violence out there at the moment and I don't see it letting up any time soon.</p>
<p>Please, please, please, Australians travelling to Thailand - look very carefully at the Government's travel warnings. This is a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Are you worried that upgrading this advisory could upset the Thai Government?</p>
<p>PM: My first responsibility as Prime Minister of Australia is to do whatever is possible to underpin the security and safety of the Australian travelling public. From time to time that causes frictions with other governments around the world. I think you know what I'm talking about. It's happened before and it will happen again, but the first responsibility of government is security of its citizens. Therefore, when we receive advice about the unfolding security situation in Thailand we must make that available to the travelling public, and I would urge, again, the Australian travelling public to look very closely at what we put online up there from the Department of Foreign Affairs on the current situation in Thailand.</p>
<p>OK folks, I think we might rock and roll. Thank you again to all who are here. Sid, and for those who are looking after his birthday celebrations, Sid told me he's, did you say you were 43?</p>
<p>SIDEBOTTOM: 43, yep that's right.</p>
<p>PM: There you go, 43 years old. I think he's putting on drinks down the pub after work so there you go. </p>
