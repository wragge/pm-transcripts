VICTOILIAN DIVISION STATE COUNCIL OF THE<br />
LIBERAL PAiTY 01" AUSTRALIA<br />
MELBOUHlNE 28 JUJLY 1971<br />
SPEECH B3Y TILE, PRIPI[ E MINISTER, MR. WILLIAM Mcl4AIION<br />
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
It had been my intention to talk to you this morning<br />
about Liberal Pa. rty policies and other domestic matters.<br />
Because of recent events involving our international<br />
relptions, I thought it would be better if I clearly identified<br />
our policies relating to China.<br />
You will recall that about a fortnight ago, I chose<br />
China as my subject when I talked to the Young Liberals in<br />
;. lelbourne Since then we have had the announcement by Presi( lent<br />
Nixon that he will go to Peking sometime before May of next<br />
year for talks with Premier Chou En-Lai.<br />
The decision is of profound importance to the whole<br />
of the free world and naturally it has attracted a tremendous<br />
amount of interest and comment.<br />
I informed the Australian people the day it was<br />
announced that my Government welcomed this decision wholeheartedly<br />
and that President Nixon had our complete support in the initiative<br />
he was taking We sincerely hope that his journey will be a journey<br />
for enduring peace.<br />
There are two comments I want to make at the outset.<br />
The first is that President Nixon's initiative is a beginning.<br />
It is an exploration. It is not yet a settlement of matters at<br />
issue between these two powers, or indeed of matters at issue<br />
between the free world and the communist nations of Asia.<br />
Therefore patience, as well as support, will be<br />
necessary and we must not be rushed or forced into hasty<br />
decisions. We do not want to compromise our bargaining<br />
position qnd there is no overriding national interest that<br />
compels us to do so. We must keep all our options open. 2/. </p>
<p>It is our interests, not China's, that I am<br />
deeply concerned with.<br />
I also want to emphasise that my Government has, in<br />
fact, been active over a long period. In many cases we have<br />
been in the vanguard.<br />
We have, as I shall show, made a number of practical<br />
moves: To establish our position in relation to<br />
representation of China and Taiwan in the<br />
United Nations.<br />
To find a way to bring about normal bilateral<br />
relations between the People's Republic that<br />
is Mainland China and ourselves.<br />
We have done this without any surrender of our<br />
national interest or the principles which govern our conduct<br />
in international relations.<br />
Our actions are predicated on the basis that we are<br />
not a great power and cannot play a decisive role in resolving<br />
the issues between East and West.<br />
But we are independent, we have a voice which I<br />
know is respected, in our region we have friendships and<br />
alliances which we want to honour. We will not unceremoniously<br />
dump our friends. 3/. </p>
<p>UNITED NATIONS<br />
We have closely watched the movement in the<br />
United Nations towards admission of the People's<br />
Republic and the trend towards recognition by a number<br />
of other countries in the free world all of them, it<br />
should be noted, outside the Asian region.<br />
These events prompted me when I was Foreign<br />
Minister to have a new reappraisal made of the trend of<br />
our future relations with the People's Republic, with<br />
the Soviet Union and with Japan. The China study began<br />
in October ! 970. In May I announced publicly our<br />
intention to seek a dialogue with China, proceeding<br />
cautiously step by step with the normalisation of<br />
relations as our final objective.<br />
This was two months before President Nixon's<br />
announcement of his planned vrisit to Peking with<br />
precisely the same objectives and in much the same words.<br />
In May of this year I said that we would not<br />
oppose China's representation and admission to the United<br />
Nations, and in a broader context-I said that it was<br />
inevitable and right that China should be a member of the<br />
United Nations General Assembly and should hold the<br />
permanent seat in the Security Council.<br />
I also said and I have repeated it since that<br />
we believed the Republic of China Taiwan should be<br />
given the chance of maintaining its membership if it so<br />
desired. We have had talks with Taiwan on this matter and<br />
I hope we have been able to influence her to consider<br />
accepting proposals for retaining her membership.<br />
It has been suggested that Taiwan may herself<br />
decide not to seek continued membership. That, of course,<br />
would create another situation. This would be a decision<br />
within Taiwan's own jurisdiction and for Taiwan iiself to<br />
make. It is clear from our talks to date with<br />
representatives of the People's Republic of China that the<br />
status of Taiwan is a major factor in their thinking.<br />
So it is on our part. We have repeatedly said<br />
we are anxious to preserve the rights of the fourteen and<br />
a half million people of Taiwan. These include the right<br />
to continued membership of the United Nations.<br />
I believe a majority of Australians share this<br />
anxiety and want us to treat Taiwan honourably. o .4/ </p>
<p>The United Nations alone can decide this issue.<br />
It is a matter for a collective decision, not for unilateral<br />
action by us. We will not abandon Taiwan, nor prejudge<br />
her position in advance of any decisions in the U. No,<br />
neither will we seek by any procedural device to exclude<br />
Peking. The People's Republic on the Mainland, has been<br />
informed of our views on the question of admission to<br />
the United Nations. I emphasise that my public statements<br />
on representation are still in advance of any declaration<br />
of attitude by America. o </p>
<p>RECOGNITION<br />
Turning now to the problem of recognition of the<br />
People's Republic.. In the May speech I used the phrase<br />
which had been used by the Department of Foreign Affairs<br />
some time before, that our objective was to normalise<br />
our bilateral relations with the People's Republic.<br />
We have no hostility to the great Chinese people<br />
whose history and culture have contributed much to the<br />
achievements of mankind.<br />
I believe that, in due time, it will be possible<br />
to reach a point when we are able to recognise the People's<br />
Repiublic with honour and without deserting old friends.<br />
But 1 cannot see that happening as the first result of the<br />
first dialogue. Other decisions have to be taken.<br />
Meanwhile we want to keep moving towards normal relations<br />
with China without waiting on completion of the<br />
formalities for full diplomatic recognition.<br />
You will recall that President Nixon said that<br />
the action he was taking would " not be at the expense of<br />
old friends". That, too, is our view. That is where<br />
Australia stands.<br />
I can tell you that we have made some progress<br />
in our dialogue with-China. We know more about the other<br />
side's position and they know more about ours. The<br />
Chinese responses to our approaches have clearly shown<br />
that the Chinese Government is positively interested in<br />
establishing diplomatic relations with the Australian<br />
Government. The dialotgue is continuing.<br />
We are active in trade and we also want to develop<br />
our cultural and scientific relationships with China.<br />
As you know, the Minister for Trade and Industry<br />
recently announced a liberalisation of the strategic<br />
exports list. The goods on the restricted list are those<br />
with defence or security importance.<br />
I have not yet heard anyone say we should remove<br />
these restrictions. So far as Taiwan is concerned, our exports have<br />
increased very substantially in recent years to about<br />
million a year.<br />
We have therefore a substantial interest in both<br />
China and Taiwan for trade.<br />
Our position in regard to travel, cultural<br />
exchanges and sport with China is free. .6/ </p>
<p>We do not place any unnecessary obstacles in the<br />
way of visits of Australian citizens to China, or of<br />
Chinese citizens to Australia.<br />
In all of this we have followed a consistent<br />
and rational policy that has placed us well ahead of<br />
most countries of the West in our dealings with China.<br />
We have always hoped that by encouraging contacts<br />
between the two countries in a number of lesser fields,<br />
and by private contacts between the people of the two<br />
countries, a greater understanding of each other's<br />
positions would develop and the prospects of a normalisation<br />
of political relations would be enhanced.<br />
In taking the steps that we as a Government have<br />
taken, we have always had in mind the need to consider<br />
the policies and attitudes of the many Governments in our<br />
part of the world with whom we have close and friendly<br />
relations, and for whom China is in many cases an even more<br />
important factor than for Australia.<br />
Many of these, like Australia, do not have<br />
diplomatic relations with China. Many of them have<br />
suffered as a result of Chinese policies directed<br />
specifically against them.<br />
It has been obvious to the Australian Government<br />
that any precipitate move by Australia to improve<br />
relations with China could well have caused difficulties<br />
for some of the countries in the South East Asian region.<br />
We have therefore taken the course of careful<br />
and constructive diplomatic groundwork, aimed at exploring<br />
the areas in which we may have a meeting of minds with<br />
China, I wonder how much Peking knows about the depth<br />
and scope of Australia's relations with the countries of<br />
South East Asia.<br />
These relations are nursued for the purposes of<br />
economic development, of stability and of constructive<br />
regional co-operation among the peoples of South East<br />
Asia. They arenot directed against the interests of any<br />
country. Indeed, let me say clearly that we would not<br />
wish to exclude China from this adventure. But this<br />
Government will not prejudice the close and constructive<br />
relationships we have developed with our neighbours in<br />
this part of the world for the sake alone of better<br />
relations with Peking.<br />
Our relations with all of these countries are<br />
important to us and we want our friends to understand<br />
what we are seeking in our attempt to normalise our<br />
relations with China. For our part, we understand and<br />
will not denigrate the efforts of our friends to adjust<br />
their own policies to the changing circumstances in Asia. </p>
<p>VI ETNAM<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, I sincerely hope that when<br />
President Nixon meets Premier Chou En-Lai there will be<br />
another opportunity to bring fresh influences to bear<br />
in the search for an honourable peace in Vietnam.<br />
I like to think that the tragedy of this war<br />
is moving to its close, but I believe that peace with<br />
justice will only be secured if an understanding can be<br />
reached between East and West based on the Bandung<br />
Principle that each nation in the region shall be free to<br />
choose the Government it wants and live the way it wishes.<br />
When we went into South Vietnam in response to a<br />
request from its Government we did so in our own national<br />
interest and to honour treaty obligations. We felt that<br />
there was a real danger at that time of the whole of<br />
South-East Asia falling to communism.<br />
The joint action of the allies in Vietnam in<br />
resisting this threat and enabling the smaller countries<br />
of Asia to determine their own future has led to a<br />
significant improvement in the security and stability of<br />
the region, Vietnamisation is, in fact, being<br />
successful. With courage and determination the South<br />
Vietnamese forces have steadily taken over the brunt<br />
of the combat role, so much so that our operational role<br />
is now winding down and we can now look forward to the<br />
withdrawal of all of our combat forces.<br />
My wish is that this should be a matter for<br />
Parliament to consider and I shall be making a statement<br />
on our position in Vietnam during the forthcoming session.<br />
The withdrawal of allied forces will not, of<br />
course, solve the problems which face the people of Vietnam.<br />
A lasting -peace in Indo-China can only be achieved on the<br />
basis of a political settlement in which all of the parties<br />
participate. The Australian Government has consistently<br />
supported the principles upon which the Geneva Agreements<br />
of 1954 relating to Indo-China and those of 1962 relating<br />
to Laos are based.<br />
If a new arrangement is to be more successful than<br />
those arrived at by the earlier conferences, there will<br />
need to be greater participation in the formulation of<br />
the arrangements by those most directly concerned,<br />
including the Governments of North and South Vietnam. a. ao8 </p>
<p>We took part last year in the Djakarta Conference<br />
on Cambodia in the belief that it is through the co-operation<br />
of the countries in the region that p~ eace and stability can<br />
best be achieved in Asia.<br />
We believe that in any future initiatives for a<br />
peaceful political settlement of the Indo-China question,<br />
great emphasis should be placed on particiipation by<br />
Asian countries. Stability is most likely to flow from greater<br />
Asian participation in solutions to Asian problems.<br />
The issues about which I have spoken China and<br />
Vietnam are two important international issues. The<br />
debate in Australia on China and Vietnam has, to an<br />
undesirable extent, become entangled with party politics.<br />
The search for a lasting solution in the interests<br />
of all the Australian people has sometimes been forgotten<br />
by some people in a scramble for temporary personal<br />
satisfaction. These are extremely complex issues, the importance<br />
of which no responsible government can afford to ignore.<br />
The Government of this country is not some kind of performing<br />
troupe that can turn on a different act in every capital of<br />
this region. We believe that Australia has a real and<br />
positive role to play, and is playing it, and will play it<br />
more and more as we grow and as we identify our interests<br />
around us. But we recognise that we cannot order the world<br />
to our own specifications, Others bigger than we have much<br />
more capacity to do so, Our influence can best be<br />
exercised in concert with our friends, great and small.<br />
We will have very little influence if we behave<br />
inconsistently and with quixotic attention only to what is<br />
happening day by day. What we are trying to do is to move<br />
in an orderly and responsible way towards the resolution of<br />
these problems. This is the reality of the position of a country<br />
like Australia. We support what the United States is<br />
attempting. If it leads to rapprochement with China on<br />
fair and reasonable terms this will be good.<br />
If the Vietnam war and the problems of the Indo-<br />
China states can be approached initially with mutual<br />
restraint and then at the conference table, of course the<br />
Australian Government favours it.<br />
We will do all in our power to help promote<br />
international detente, but let us not deceive ourselves by<br />
exaggerating our own capacity to prodluce it, </p>
