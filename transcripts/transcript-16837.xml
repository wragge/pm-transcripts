The Australian Government will contribute $200,000 to developing the Zelman Cowen Gallery of Australian Jewish History at the Jewish Museum of Australia.</p>
<p>The contribution to this worthwhile cultural project marks the 90th birthday on 7 October of Sir Zelman Cowen, a remarkable Australian and former Governor-General.</p>
<p>The Jewish Museum of Australia, of which Sir Zelman has been patron since its inception in 1982, is planning to raise $1.5 million to bring this project to life.</p>
<p>The Australian Government hopes its contribution will encourage the Jewish community and the broader Australian community, the corporate, legal and philanthropic sectors and the State Government to also support the Gallery.</p>
<p>The Jewish Museum of Australia is a community museum established to explore and share the Jewish experience in Australia and benefit Australia's diverse society.</p>
<p>Sir Zelman Cowen has contributed immeasurably to Australia as a naval intelligence officer during World War 2, a Rhodes Scholar, Dean of Law at Melbourne University, Vice-Chancellor of the University of New England and University of Queensland, and Governor-General from 1977 until 1982.</p>
