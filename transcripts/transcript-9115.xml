PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
LAUNCH OF WESTFIELD ENDOWMENT FOR ENSEMBLE<br />
DEVELOPMENT, CANBERRA<br />
FEBRUARY 1994 EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
I am very pleased to be here today at the launch of this significant development in<br />
Australia's musical life.<br />
My regard for music and those who make it is no secret. I believe music brings out the<br />
best in people. It inspires them, it sustains them, it soothes and comforts them.<br />
It's difficult to imagine life without music. Such a life, I'm sure, would be very bare<br />
indeed. The thought of not being able to settle down with a CD after a day in this<br />
place, for example, is pretty horrible to contemplate.<br />
Musicians are among those creative artists who put a premium on the use of<br />
imagination, whether as composers or performers. And in this they provide a lead for<br />
all of us.<br />
We need, as a nation, to put a premium on imagination. And creativity. And<br />
innovation. Successful societies place a high value on these things. They are prepared to take the<br />
trouble to develop them, and that means nurturing the talented individuals in whom<br />
these qualities reside. Particularly the emerging talent.<br />
As I've said before, this Government is more than prepared to play its part in the<br />
process. We've demonstrated that with our support for the arts in the years we've been<br />
in office, and particularly in last year's Budget.<br />
Wt-are-detrin ed -to-forge-a new role-for the arts-in-Austr alia, and our forthcoming<br />
cultural policy statement will articulate what we believe this role should be, and how<br />
we intend to help bring it about.<br />
In the meantime, however, we've put the Arts Ministry into Cabinet, where it belongs.<br />
And we've combined it in a portfolio with Communications, in recognition of the fact<br />
that cultural and communications development are inextricably linked together. </p>
<p>But we can't and won't do it all alone.<br />
We are also determined to see the level of private support for the arts in Australia<br />
substantially raised.<br />
The arts need more corporate support, more patronage. We need to get up to the level<br />
of other countries in this area.<br />
The smart people in our corporate world know this.<br />
They know that the arts take a lead in projecting Australia to the world as an exciting,<br />
dynamic country with which it pays to form partnerships..<br />
They know that by helping Australian artists they are also, ultimately, helping all<br />
Australians. Frank Lowy and the Westfield Group, with this award have confirmed ( as if it needed<br />
to be-) not only their acumen and far sightedness as eminent members of our corporate<br />
sector, but also their generosity as long time supporters of the arts in Australia.<br />
In one sense, of course, they couldn't help it. Genuine lovers of the arts, I believe, feel<br />
the frisson that a work of art conveys. They recognise the essential part the arts play<br />
in their lives. Just as they recognise the inescapability of the debt to art that this<br />
creates. Its a debt that can be repaid in many ways, but one of the most important is by direct<br />
financial support of artists. We need to do more for our artists. All of us.<br />
That is why this award is particularly well directed.<br />
It is the first award in Australia specifically designed to support developing ensembles.<br />
It means that young Australian musicians will have some financial security while they<br />
work together to achieve professional excellence.<br />
And the size of the endowment means that an annual award can be given in perpetuity.<br />
It is with great pleasure, then, that I officially launch the Westfield Endowment for<br />
ensemble development.<br />
I am sure that you will join with me in applauding the generosity of Westfield in their<br />
-extraordinary-gesture to honour Tony -Berg -in his professional capacity as a<br />
businessman, and in his private commitment to Musica Viva and to music development<br />
in Australia-<br />
It is an honour richly deserved.<br />
Thank you. </p>
