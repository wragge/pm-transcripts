-AUSTRALIA,-<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS: PM No. 26/ 1972<br />
NAVAL SUPPORT FACILITY COCKBURN SOUND, W. A.<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. William McMahon, C. H., M. P.<br />
The Government considered today revised<br />
estimates of cost for the construction of the Naval Support Facility<br />
at Cockburn Scund, Western Australia. When the announcement was<br />
made in October 1970 of the decision to proceed with the second<br />
stage of the project the actual facilities on Garden Island the<br />
total estimated cost was $ 38 million. The first stage, construction<br />
of the causeway linking Garden Island with the mainland, is well<br />
in hand. The latest estimate is $ 48.5 million. The<br />
increase is attributable mainly to escalation in construction costs,<br />
design changes found necessary as a result of more detailed site<br />
investigations and some variations in actual requirements.<br />
The Government decided, subject to examination of<br />
the second stage of the project by the Parliamentary Public Works<br />
Committee, that the proposal should proceed and to the previously<br />
planned completion date of the end of 1975.<br />
The facility, when completed, will provide<br />
support for up to four escort vessels and three submarines for<br />
periods up to a year without drydocking. The proposed works include<br />
wharves, workshops, stores, administrative offices, barracks for<br />
personnel, an armament depot and armament jetty, training facilitics<br />
and an operational headquarters.<br />
In confirming the decision to proceed with the<br />
second stage of the Naval facility at Cockburn Sound, the Government<br />
took into consideration the strategic changes occurring in the<br />
Indian Ocean area, including the increasing Soviet Naval activity.<br />
The Naval Sunoort Facility at Cockburn Sound will<br />
provide a base for our ships to operate in the Indian Ocean for<br />
extensive periods and may be seen as a demonstration of our interest<br />
in contributing to the security of ocean areas adjacent to Australia.<br />
The facility would be available to the United<br />
States and Britain and will thus assist their nrerations in the<br />
Indian Ocean. </p>
<p>0 2.<br />
These two countries have expressed interest<br />
in the Cockburn Sound facilities in connection with the<br />
deployment of their ships in this area.<br />

for Defence.<br />
