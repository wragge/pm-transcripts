7 August 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD, MP<br />
DOORSTOP INTERVIEW SYDNEY<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Prime Minister it's quite an incredible welcome back for our athletes.<br />
PRIME MNISTER:<br />
It is a fantastic occasion and I just want to say again how proud a Australians are of the<br />
tremendous achievements of this team, It was an achievement that's surpassed any others and<br />
every single member of the team is entitled to feel the pride, I'm sure they have, and to enjoy the<br />
adulation and the affection of a very grateful and a very proud nation.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will the Federal Government guarantee more funds..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We will guarantee, absolutely, to meet in full the commitments that we made before the last<br />
election. Any suggestion that we are going to cut funding for Olympic sport is wrong. We won't<br />
do that. We will, obviously, want to play our full part in ensuring that Australia's performance in<br />
the Year 2000 is equal, if not better, than the achievement in 1996 and that means an effort, not<br />
only from the Government, but also an effort from the corporate community.<br />

PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I beg your pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you going to say anything about Arthur Tunstall's comments?<br />
PRIME MINISTER;<br />
Oh look I'm not going to talk about that.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Did you find what he said embarrassing though? I mean, ( inaudible)..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm simply not going to get into that?<br />
JOURNALIST: So the word is, there won't be cuts towards Olympic funds?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There certainly won't be no. There certainly will not be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you maintain levels of funding..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, yes we will.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you guarantee ( inaudible)<br />
PRIMHE MINISTER:<br />
We will maintain in fll the commitment that we made before the last election, which was to<br />
maintain the programme or athlete preparation right through to the games. I mean we're not just<br />
doing it, obviously, in this year's budget and then do something sneaky in the next one. Look, we </p>
<p>Fax from~ 0 7/ 08/ 96 14: 43 Pg: 4<br />
are giving an unambiguous commitment to maintain the funding that was previously committed. I<br />
spelt that out before the election and there won't be any backtracking and there won't be any<br />
cutting of Olympic funding. But I do want to take the opportunity of saying that we need and the<br />
teams need and the Olympic Committee needs very strong corporate support and very strong<br />
community support. It is not just the responsibility of the Government, it is also the responsibility<br />
of the entire community.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)...<br />
PREME IN1ISTER:<br />
I haven't spoken, I'm sorry yes, I just heard the bloke on the left.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)..<br />
PIM MINISTER:<br />
Would you like to repeat the question? You've now got me utterly and comprehensively<br />
confused. JOURNALIST; Has Mr Carr made any requests for help from the Federal Government to help with security or<br />
transport as yet?<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
Well I haven't had any direct requests from himi or any direct conversations, but I am certain that<br />
he will do that and it is equally certain that I will co-operate in every appropriate way with Mr<br />
Carr, We had a general discussion some weeks ago about preparations for the games. Obviously<br />
we'll have a look at the security situation. There's clearly a role for the Federal Government,<br />
there's also clearly a role for the State Government. I think there's also a need to understand that<br />
there is an Australian way of handling security problems. We are Australia, we're not any other<br />
country, we have our own culture, our own tradition, we have our own style. We want tile games<br />
of the new millennium to be an event that people remember, enjoy and feel free and happy about<br />
and we've got to keep that in mind in relation to any of the security aspects of preparation and<br />
surveillance while the games are actually on.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible).. </p>
<p>07/ 08/ 96 14: 43 PS:<br />
PRVM MINISTER:<br />
Well there's no doubt that the firmer the budget, the more likely it is that there could be another<br />
interest rate cut. It's ultimately in the hands of the monetary authorities and not directly in the<br />
hands of the Government. But one of the virtues of having a tight budget is that you're more<br />
likely to cut interest rates. I have no doubt that one of the reasons the Reserve Bank cut official<br />
interest rates last week was the knowledge that the Government was taking a firm approach to the<br />
budget. If we had of adopted the advice of our opponents in relation to the budget I don't believe<br />
interest rates would have been cut last week.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PlUMIE MiISTER:<br />
Oh, people in my situation always like them to be bigger.<br />
Thank you.<br />
