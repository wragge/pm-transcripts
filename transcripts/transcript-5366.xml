PROPOSAL FOR NEW ZEALAND TO ATTEND MEETINGS OF'<br />
THE RECREATION MINISTERS' COUNCIL<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, announced today that<br />
he had sought the agreement of all State Premiers and the<br />
Chief Minister for the Northern Territory to the Australian<br />
Government's proposals to invite the New Zealand Government<br />
to send its. Minister responsible for Recreation and Sport to<br />
meetings of the Recreation Ministers' Council.<br />
In detailing some of the background to the proposal., Mr Fraser<br />
said that since its establishment in 1973. Commonwealth, State<br />
and Territory Ministers have met regularly for the purpose of<br />
co-ordinating the development of sport and recreation in<br />
Australia. At its last meeting, Ministers agreed that as there<br />
are a great many areas of common interest with New Zealand, not<br />
least in the sport and recreation field, it would be desirable<br />
to invite the appropriate New Zealand Minister to join the<br />
Council as an observer thus expanding the scope for better<br />
communications in this area between the two countries.<br />
" The proposal is in harmony with the recent discussions I<br />
had with the New Zealand Prime Minister in Wellington on<br />
20/ 21 March", Mr Fraser commented. " At these consultations<br />
we agreed on a framework for developing an even closer<br />
relationship betweeen the two countries in a wide range of<br />
activities". " Both Mr Muldoon and myself are concerned to ensure that a<br />
closer relationship between Australia and New Zealand should<br />
provide a stronger base for the expansion of their links with<br />
other countries, particularly those of the Pacific. and<br />
South East Asia". </p>
