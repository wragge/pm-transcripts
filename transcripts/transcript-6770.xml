    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER<br />EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF THE BUSINESS COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA<br />TUESDAY 29 OCTOBER 1985<br />THIS IS THE THIRD OCCASION ON WHICH I HAVE HAD THE HONOUR TO<br />ADDRESS THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF THE BUSINESS COUNCIL<br />SINCE I-TS INCEPTION IN 1983 THOUGH, I MUST ADMIT, ONLY THE<br />FIRST OCCASION ON WHICH I HAVE ADDRESSED THE BCA IN TWO<br />CITIES SIMULTANEOUSLY.<br />I CONGRATULATE THE BCA ON ITS INITIATIVE IN ARRANGING THIS<br />DUAL-CITY PRESENTATION.<br />THIS ADDRESS MARKS THE THIRD YEAR OF FRUITFUL DIALOGUE AND<br />CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE COUNCIL AND THE LABOR GOVERNMENT. IT IS<br />A DIALOGUE WHICH HAS NOT SOUGHT TO DENY LEGITIMATE DIFFERENCES OF<br />OPINION WHERE THEY EXIST. BUT A DIALOGUE, NONETHELESS, WHICH HAS<br />DEMONSTRATED OUR SHARED AND UNAMBIGUOUS COMMITMENT TO A DYNAMIC<br />AND GROWING ECONOMY TO WHICH SUSTAINED EXPANSION OF THE PRIVATE<br />SECTOR IS OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE.<br />I BELIEVE, AS I SAID AT THAT FIRST AGM IN 1983, THAT<br />REGULAR, INFORMED AND PROFESSIONAL CONTACT BETWEEN BUSINESS<br />AND GOVERNMENT IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC DEBATE AND<br />ADVOCACY IN AUSTRALIA. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE<br />WORKED AT CONSTANTLY BY BOTH PARTIES, INCLUDING THROUGH<br />DISCUSSIONS SUCH AS WE HAVE HAD TODAY.<br />AND, ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT, I PLEDGE TO CONTINUE TO<br />PROMOTE A CLOSE AND FRANK WORKING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US.<br />IT IS NOW WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED, BOTH HERE IN AUSTRALIA AND<br />OVERSEAS, THAT THE ECONOMIC POLICIES WHICH THE GOVERNMENT<br />FIRST ANNOUNCED IN 1983, AND HAS CONSCIENTIOUSLY APPLIED<br />SINCE THAT TIME, HAVE DELIVERED THE MOST CONSISTENTLY<br />SUCCESSFUL ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN AUSTRALIA FOR OVER A<br />DECADE. RECOGNITION IS ALSO SPREADING OF THE CENTRAL ROLE<br />OF THE ACCORD. TO QUOTE BUT ONE RECENT EXAMPLE, THE<br />SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE OECD HAS DESCRIBED THE RESULTS OF<br />THE ACCORD AS " BRILLIANT". THESE RESULTS INCLUDE, AS YOU<br />ARE ALL AWARE, A SIGNIFICANT CUT IN INFLATION, A SHARP<br />WINDING BACK OF REAL UNIT LABOUR COSTS AND A CORRESPONDING<br />RESTORATION OF THE PROFIT SHARE.<br />r -mpm</p>
<p>OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES HAVE BEEN THE BEST OR CLOSE TO THE<br />BEST IN THE WORLD, AND WE ARE VERY NEAR TO DELIVERING ON OUR<br />COMMITMENT OF 500,000 NEW JOBS, WELL WITHIN THE THREE-YEAR<br />TIME FRAME.<br />OUR FORECASTS, BROADLY ENDORSED BY THE OECD, SHOW CONTINUED<br />STRONG GROWTH IN BOTH OUTPUT AND EMPLOYMENT IN 1985-86 AND<br />BEYOND. EVEN THE MORE PESSIMISTIC OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR<br />FORECASTERS HAVE BEGUN TO LIFT THEIR EXPECTATIONS IN THE<br />LIGHT OF THE STRONG GROWTH IN EMPLOYMENT WHICH IS OCCURRING.<br />NONETHELESS SOME COMMENTATORS SEEM SCEPTICAL THAT<br />AUSTRALIA's GROWTH PERFORMANCE CAN BE MAINTAINED INTO THE<br />MEDIUM TERM. I BELIEVE THAT, JUST AS IN THE CASE OF THE<br />SCEPTICS OF 1983, SUCH SCEPTICISM IS MISPLACED.<br />THE LESSON OF THE EXPERIENCE OF MANY COUNTRIES IN OUR<br />REGION, INCLUDING JAPAN, IS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR<br />AUSTRALIA TO AIM TO GROW MORE RAPIDLY THAN THE WORLD AVERAGE<br />PROVIDED OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUFFICIENTLY COMPETITIVE:<br />COMPETITIVE IN BOTH THEIR HOME MARKETS AND ON WORLD MARKETS.<br />AS I HAVE OFTEN SAID, THE DEPRECIATION OF THE $ A HAS<br />PROVIDED BOTH AN OPPORTUNITY AND A CHALLENGE: AN<br />OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE AUSTRALIAN SUPPLIERS HAVE BECOME MORE<br />COMPETITIVE AS A RESULT, BUT A CHALLENGE TO ENSURE THAT THE<br />GAINS IN COMPETITIVENESS ARE SUSTAINED.<br />THE NEW AGREEMENT CONCLUDED WITH THE ACTU UNDER THE ACCORD<br />IS DESIGNED TO MAXIMIZE THE ADVANTAGE REAPED BY AUSTRALIA<br />FROM THE SUBSTANTIAL OPPORTUNITY WHICH DEPRECIATION<br />PROVIDES. MOST COMMENTATORS HAVE FOCUSSED ON THE ACCORD'S AGREEMENT TO<br />SEEK A 2 PER CENT DISCOUNT FROM WAGES INDEXATION IN THE<br />FIRST NATIONAL WAGE CASE OF 1986, ON THE BASIS THAT THE<br />IDENTIFIED IMPACT OF THE DEPRECIATION ON THE CPI AMOUNTS TO<br />AT LEAST 2 PER CENT. ON CURRENT INDICATIONS THAT WOULD<br />INSULATE WAGE COSTS FROM THE DIRECT EFFECT ON PRICES TO THAT<br />TIME OF THE DEPRECIATION WHICH HAS OCCURRED.<br />IT HAS BEEN ARGUED BY SOME THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE<br />ACHIEVED SOME PART OF THAT DISCOUNT IN THE WAGES CASE JUST<br />CONCLUDED. INDEED, THIS OPTION WAS CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY<br />THE GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, A M4AJOR FACTOR IN OUR FINAL<br />DECISION TO SEEK THE 2 PER CENT DISCOUNT NEXT YEAR WAS THAT<br />THE IMPACT ON UNDERLYING WAGES COSTS OF A SIX MONTHS DELAY<br />A DELAY UNTIL EARLY 1986 WAS FOUND BY TREASURY TO BE<br />MINIMAL BY THE END OF 1986. IN THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEW IT WAS<br />A SMALL PRICE TO PAY TO SECURE THE SUBSTANTIAL BENEFITS OF<br />DEPRECIATION WHICH THE BROADER PACKAGE CAN DELIVER.</p>
<p>THE REST OF THE BROADER PACKAGE WHICH HAS RECEIVED LESS<br />ATTENTION INCLUDES AN AGREEMENT BY THE UNIONS TO DELAY ANY<br />PAYMENT ARISING OUT OF THE PRODUCTIVITY CASE UNTIL JULY<br />1986, TO MODERATE THE EXTENT OF THE PRODUCTIVITY CLAIM TO 3<br />PER CENT, AND TO SPREAD THESE PAYMENTS OVER TWO YEARS I<br />WOULD NOTE, IN PASSING, THAT WORKERS ARE ENTITLED UNDER THE<br />CURRENT PRINCIPLES TO APPLY TO THE COMMISSION FOR SUCH AN<br />INCREASE IN RECOGNITION OF THEIR ENTITLEMENT TO A FAIR SHARE<br />IN THE INCREASE IN REAL NATIONAL INCOME. FINALLY, AND<br />IMPORTANTLY, THE NEW AGREEMENT ALSO RENEWS THE VITAL<br />COMMITMENT TO " NO EXTRA WAGE CLAIMS" FOR A FURTHER TWO<br />YEARS.<br />ALLOWING FOR THE GROWTH OF LABOUR PRODUCTIVITY WHICH COULD<br />REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO OCCUR OVER THE PERIOD, THIS SET OF<br />AGREEMENTS TOGETHER IMPLY THAT REAL UNIT LABOUR COSTS IN TWO<br />YEARS TIME SHOULD BE NO HIGHER THAN AT PRESENT. THEY IMPLY<br />THAT THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE PROFIT SHARE WHICH HAS OCCURRED<br />UNDER OUR POLICIES CAN BE PRESERVED. MOREOVER THEY IMPLY<br />THAT INFLATION, HAVING RISEN AS A RESULT OF THE INITIAL<br />INCREASE IN PRICES OF TRADED GOODS, WILL HAVE RETURNED IN<br />1986-87 TO AROUND THE LEVELS OF THE PAST TWO FINANCIAL<br />YEARS, WITH A PROSPECT OF FURTHER SLOWING IN 1987-88.<br />IN OTHER WORDS THE PACKAGE WILL SUBSTANTIALLY ACHIEVE<br />PRECISELY WHAT IS REQUIRED. IT WILL INSULATE DOMESTIC COSTS<br />FROM THE REALIGNMENT OF RELATIVE PRICES WHICH WAS INITIATED<br />BY THE DEPRECIATION OF EARLY 1985, AND IS ESSENTIAL TO<br />ENABLE THAT DEPRECIATION TO BE EFFECTIVE.<br />SUCH AN OUTCOME WOULD BE FAR LESS CERTAIN IN THE ABSENCE OF<br />THE ACCORD. THE ATTEMPT TO ACHIEVE DISCOUNTING IN THE<br />ABSENCE OF THE ACCORD WOULD HAVE ENSURED THE RENEWED<br />OUTBREAK OF A WAGES PRICES SPIRAL FED BY EXTRA CLAIMS, A<br />SPIRAL WHICH WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE REFLECTED IN A DOWNWARDS<br />SPIRAL OF THE EXCHANGE RATE, AND A REDUCTION IN BUSINESS AND<br />CONSUMER CONFIDENCE. THIS WOULD HAVE MADE FAR HARDER THE<br />TASK OF RESTORING CONTROL OVER DOMESTIC COSTS AND INFLATION,<br />AND PUT THE STRONG RECOVERY ACHIEVED AT AN END.<br />THE NEW AGREEMENT UNDER THE ACCORD WILL THUS PROVIDE A SOUND<br />BASIS ON WHICH THE BUSINESS SECTOR CAN FUNCTION IN RELATIVE<br />CERTAINTY AND CONFIDENCE, AND ON WHICH AUSTRALIA AS A NATION<br />CAN BUILD ITS FUTURE PROSPERITY.<br />THE SEPTEMBER QUARTER CPI, SHOWING AN INCREASE OF ONLY<br />2.2 PER CENT, PROVIDES TIMELY CONFIRM4ATION THAT INFLATION IS<br />NOT ABOUT TO ACCELERATE AS RAPIDLY AS SOME OF THE MORE<br />PESSIMISTIC FORECASTERS OF A MONTH OR SO AGO WERE<br />PREDICTING. INDEED THE CPI IS WELL ON TRACK FOR AN OUTCOME<br />OVER THE COURSE OF 1985-86 IN LINE WITH THE BUDGET FORECAST<br />OF 8 PER CENT. BARRING THE UNEXPECTED, INFLATION SEEMS<br />LIKELY TO LEVEL OUT AT ABOUT THAT RATE BEFORE TRENDING DOWN<br />AGAIN.</p>
<p>THE NEW AGREEMENT IS SUPPORTED FIRST BY A CONTINUING FIRM<br />MONETARY POLICY A POLICY DIRECTED TO SUPPORTING THE<br />REQUIRED ONGOING RECOVERY IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, BUT NOT SO<br />RAPID A PACE OF EXPANSION AS TO REKINDLE AVOIDABLE INFLATION<br />AND, SECOND, BY RESPONSIBLE FISCAL POLICY.<br />THE GOVERNMENT THIS YEAR HONOURED A SERIES OF FISCAL<br />COMMITMENTS THE TRILOGY WHICH HAVE ONLY BEEN MET ONCE<br />SINCE 1961. NO OTHER GOVERNMENT HAS IMPOSED ON ITSELF SUCH<br />A DEGREE OF FISCAL DISCIPLINE IN. THE POST-WAR PERIOD.<br />OUR COMMITMENTS TO RESTRAIN OUTLAYS, TAX RECEIPTS AND THE<br />BUDGET DEFICIT AS A PROPORTION OF GDP WILL CONTINUE TO BE<br />HONOURED IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS. BUT IN REACHING OUR RECENT<br />AGREEMENT WITH THE ACTU,-THIS GOVERNMENT HAS WILLINGLY<br />ACCEPTED SPENDING RESTRAINT OVER AND ABOVE THE PRIOR TRILOGY<br />COMMITMENT. EVEN THOUGH TAX CUTS BROADLY EQUIVALENT TO 2 PER CENT OF THE<br />WAGES BILL WILL BE PROVIDED FROM SEPTEMBER 1986, THE CUTS<br />WILL BE FINANCED BY ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURE RESTRAINT AND NOT<br />BY ADDITIONAL BORROWING. THE GOVERNMENT IS THUS DETERMINED<br />TO ENSURE THAT, EVEN AS PRIVATE EXPENDITURE IS MAINTAINED,<br />THE SHARE OF GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE IN GDP IS FURTHER<br />REDUCED. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MEASURES ALREADY IN PLACE TO CURB<br />THE BUDGET DEFICIT AS A PROPORTION OF GDP, THIS WILL HELP TO<br />CURB THE EXTENT TO WHICH AUSTRALIA NEEDS TO FINANCE DOMESTIC<br />SPENDING BY RECOURSE TO FOREIGN SAVING AND THUS INCUR A<br />CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT.<br />IN TIME, THE IMPROVEMENT IN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION WHICH<br />THESE ARRANGEMENTS PRESERVE WILL BEGIN TO REDUCE THE CURRENT<br />ACCOUNT DEFICIT AS A PROPORTION OF GDP. AS A CONSEQUENCE,<br />DOMESTIC PRODUCTION WILL BEGIN TO GROW AT A SOMEWHAT FASTER<br />PACE THAN DOMESTIC DEMAND AND, AS OECD FORECASTS TESTIFY, AT<br />A PACE WHICH IS FASTER THAN ALL COMPARABLE ECONOMIES AND<br />ABOUT TWIC9 THE AVERAGE GROWTH RATE ACHIEVED IN AUSTRALIA<br />OVER THE FRASER-HOWARD YEARS.<br />AS THE BUDGET PAPERS INDICATE, THE REDUCTION IN THE CURRENT<br />ACCOUNT WILL INITIALLY BE SMALL, REFLECTING THE USUAL LAGS,<br />BUT GROW AS THE YEAR PASSES.<br />THUS THE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT COULD AMOUNT TO ABOUT 5 PER<br />CENT OF GDP IN THE RECENTLY COMPLETED SEPTEMBER QUARTER, A<br />RESULT WHICH WAS INFLATED BY BOTH THE CELEBRATED J-CURVE.<br />EFFECT ON NOMINAL VALUES AND THE SEASONAL PATTERN OF TRADE<br />TRANSACTIONS. ON CURRENT FORECASTS, THE DEFICIT COULD<br />DECLINE FROM 4.9 PER CENT OF GDP IN 1984-85, TO ABOUT 4.6<br />PER CENT OF GDP IN 1985-86 TAKING THE YEAR AS A WHOLE. BUT<br />THE DECLINE IS EXPECTED TO BE MORE MARKED OVER THE COURSE OF<br />1985-86 SO THAT THE FIGURE AROUND THE END OF THAT FINANCIAL<br />YEAR IS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT 4 PER CENT OF GDP, WITH FURTHER<br />REDUCTIONS IN LATER QUARTERS.</p>
<p>SUCH AN OUTCOME WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH A GRADUAL EASING<br />OVER TIME IN OUR INDEBTEDNESS TO FOREIGNERS AS A SHARE OF<br />GDP. WHILE RECENT WORK PUBLISHED BY THE OFFICE OF EPAC HAS SHOWN<br />THAT AUSTRALIA'S PRESENT LEVEL OF NET INDEBTEDNESS IS LESS<br />CAUSE FOR CONCERN THAN SOME OF THE MORE ALARMIST<br />COMMENTATORS WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE, IT IS CLEAR THAT<br />AUSTRALIA COULD NOT LONG GO ON ADDING TO OUR OBLIGATIONS TO<br />FOREIGNERS AT THE PACE OF THE LAST FEW YEARS.<br />THE DEPRECIATION AND OUR POLICY RESPONSE, BASED ON THE<br />ACCORD PROVIDES A BASIS FOR ENSURING THAT AUSTRALIA'S<br />OBLIGATIONS ABROAD CAN BE SERVICED WITHOUT EITHER MASSIVE<br />DISRUPTION TO THE ECONOMY OR INTOLERABLE FUTURE STRAIN ON<br />THE EXCHANGE RATE. WITHOUT THE ACCORD THAT ADJUSTMENT COULD<br />ONLY HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AFTER A SHARP CONTRACTION OF THE<br />DOMESTIC ECONOMY WHICH WOULD BE COSTLY IN BOTH ECONOMIC AND<br />SOCIAL TERMS.<br />THE TRADE POLICIES PURSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT ALSO SEEK TO<br />ENHANCE AUSTRALIA'S GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. WE ARE THUS<br />ACTIVELY SEEKING TO PROMOTE THE COMMENCEMENT OF A NEW ROUND<br />OF MULTILATERAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS; A ROUND, MOREOVER,<br />WHICH PROPERLY ADDRESSES THE INTERESTS OF AUSTRALIA AND<br />OTHER COUNTRIES IN OUR RAPIDLY GROWING REGION.<br />IN ADDITION, AUSTRALIA IS ACTIVELY SEEKING TO DEVELOP<br />MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL TRADE LINKS WITH THE ASEAN COUNTRIES.<br />AND WE RAVE GIVEN PRIORITY TO THE PACIFIC REGION IN THE<br />DEVELOPMENT OF TARGETTED MARKETING STRATEGIES, WHICH SEEK<br />ESPECIALLY TO IDENTIFY THE SCOPE AND NATURE OF POTENTIAL<br />EXPORT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY IN THE REGION.<br />THESE INCLUDE CHINA AND JAPAN, UNDER THE CHINA ACTION PLAN<br />AND THE JAPAN MARKET STRATEGY RESPECTIVELY. SUCH<br />INITIATIVES PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR AUSTRALIA<br />TO SHARE IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH OF OUR REGION.<br />BUT TO CAPITALISE ON BQTH REGIONAL AND WORLD GROWTH,<br />AUSTRALIA NEEDS INNOVATIVE, FORWARD LOOKING, EXPORT-ORIENTED<br />ENTERPRISES. IT NEEDS ENTERPRISES PREPARED TO INTRODUCE NEW<br />PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES, OR TO EXPLOIT OPPORTUNITIES TO<br />POSITION. THEMSELVES IN NICHES OF THE WORLD MARKET WHERE<br />AUSTRALIA'S ENDOWMENTS OF SKILLS, RESOURCES OR TECHNOLOGY<br />CAN BE USED MOST EFFECTIVELY. OUR POLICIES SEEK TO<br />ENCOURAGE JUST SUCH INDUSTRIES.<br />WE RECOGNISE THE ROLE OF PROFITS IN PROMPTING INVESTMENT AND<br />FACILITATING STRUCTURAL CHANGE. WE SEEK TO ENCOURAGE A MORE<br />EFFICIENT PUBLIC SECTOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO KEEP THE<br />BURDEN OF REGULATION TO THE MINIMUM NECESSARY TO MEET THE<br />ASPIRATIONS OF AUSTRALIANS. AND, WHERE NECESSARY, WE SEEK<br />TO PUT IN PLACE PARTICULAR POLICIES TO FACILITATE FORWARD<br />LOOKING, GROWTH-SUSTAINING STRUCTURAL CHANGE.</p>
<p>DURING THE GOVERNMENT'S FIRST 2 1/ 2 YEARS IN OFFICE, THESE<br />HAVE INCLUDED THE STEEL AND MOTOR VEHICLE PLANS; THE<br />DECISION TO FLOAT THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR AND TO REMOVE<br />VIRTUALLY ALL EXCHANGE CONTROLS; AND THE MEASURES<br />SUBSTANTIALLY TO DEREGULATE THE BANKING SECTOR AND TO<br />ENCOURAGE INNOVATION AND COMPETITION WITHIN THE FINANCIAL<br />SERVICES SECTOR AS A WHOLE. I BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT CAN<br />REASONABLY CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE ALL MET WITH WIDESPREAD<br />APPROVAL. WHEN I ADDRESSED YOU SOME 13 MONTHS AGO I OUTLINED THE<br />GOVERNMENT'S BROAD INTENTIONS IN RELATION TO BUSINESS<br />REGULATION AND INVITED THE BCA TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNMENT<br />TO ESTABLISH PRIORITIES FOR REFORM. I WISH TO RECORD MY<br />THANKS TO BCA FOR THE SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION WHICH<br />RESULTED. AND I AM PLEASED TODAY TO BE ABLE TO INFORM YOU<br />OF SOME DECISIONS WHICH WE HAVE TAKEN.<br />BUSINESS DEREGULATION IS AN ISSUE WHICH, IN THE PAST, HAS<br />BEEN LONG ON RHETORIC AND LAMENTABLY SHORT ON ACTION. BUT<br />AS HAS BEEN AMPLY DEMONSTRATED, WE ARE A GOVERNMENT PREPARED<br />TO GET THINGS DONE. AND WE HAVE TAKEN DEREGULATION OUT OF<br />THE " TOO HARD" BASKET.<br />THE GOVERNMENT APPRECIATES THAT COMPETITIVENESS IS NOT<br />ENHANCED WHERE ADDITIONAL COSTS ARE IMPOSED ON INDUSTRY<br />THROUGH UNNECESSARY REGULATION OR EXCESSIVE " RED TAPE".<br />WHEREVER IT IS POSSIBLE, SUCH IMPOSTS WILL NOW BE REMOVED.<br />IN CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH REGULATION IS REQUIRED IN THE<br />BROADER NATIONAL INTEREST, WE WILL BE CONCERNED TO ENSURE<br />THAT FOR THE FUTURE THE LEAST COSTLY REGULATORY REGIME IS<br />IMPOSED. AND IN TERMS OF CURRENT REGULATIONS, WE HAVE BEEN<br />IDENTIFYING AND TAKING ACTION WHERE INEFFICIENT<br />ADMINISTRATION OR THE NON-UNIFORM APPLICATION OF SIMILAR<br />REGULATIONS BETWEEN STATES HAS IMPOSED UNWARRANTED COSTS.<br />A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TASK FACING THE GOVERNMENT IS TO<br />RETAIN A RELEVANT, EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE REGULATORY<br />FRAMEWORK IN THE FACE OF DYNAMIC CHANGES TO ECONOMIC AND<br />SOCIAL PRIORITIES. THIS DIFFICULTY IS ALL THE MORE ACUTE<br />BECAUSE, AT THE SAME TIME, THE REGULATORY PROCESSES MUST BE<br />SUFFICIENTLY PREDICTABLE THAT THEY DO NOT THEMSELVES BECOME<br />A CONTINUING SOURCE OF UNCERTAINTY AND SPECULATION, OR OF<br />ADDED COSTS.<br />WITH THESE CONSIDERATIONS IN MIND, THE GOVERNMENT HAS<br />DECIDED THAT EACH MINISTER PROPOSING NEW REGULATIONS MUST<br />EITHER INCLUDE SUNSET PROVISIONS, OR DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE<br />IS A GOOD REASON FOR NOT IMPOSING THEM. I BELIEVE THIS<br />APPROACH STRIKES AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN CAPTURING<br />THE BENEFITS OF SUNSET PROVISIONS, WHILE AVOIDING THE COSTS<br />AND DELAYS OF TOO RIGID AN APPLICATION.</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THAT THE TASK OF DETERMINING THE<br />APPROPRIATE EXTENT OF REGULATION IN THE CONTEXT OF COMPETING<br />ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL POLICY OBJECTIVES IS A DIFFICULT ONE.<br />AS THE BCA HAS ARGUED, THE COMMITMENT OF BUSINESS, AND MORE<br />IMPORTANTLY GOVERNMENTS HAS TO BE A CONTINUING ONE.<br />SO AS TO FACILITATE THE CONTINUING PROCESS OF REGULATORY<br />REVIEW, A BUSINESS REGULATORY REVIEW UNIT HAS BEEN<br />ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY<br />AND COMMERCE.<br />THIS UNIT WILL PROVIDE A POINT OF CONTACT FOR BUSINESS TO<br />PROPOSE REGULATORY CHANGES, AND IT WILL REPORT FREQUENTLY TO<br />INTERESTED ORGANISATIONS ON PROGRESS WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />INITIATIVE. SENATOR BUTTON WILL BE SEEKING IN THE NEAR<br />FUTURE THE SECONDMENT OF BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVES TO THE<br />UNIT. TODAY I WISH TO REPORT TO YOU THAT, CONSISTENT WITH THE<br />PRIORITIES WHICH HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AS A RESULT OF<br />CONSULTATIONS WITH STATE AND TERRITORY GOVERNMENTS, UNIONS,<br />SCA AND OTHER INDUSTRY BODIES, THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN<br />CERTAIN DEREGULATORY INITIATIVES IN RESPECT OF EXPORT<br />CONTROL GUIDELINES AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT POLICY AND WE HAVE<br />DETERMINED A SET OF PRIORITIES FOR FURTHER WORK.<br />THE GOVERNMENT HAS HAD UNDERWAY FOR SOME MONTHS A<br />CASE-BY-CASE RE-EXAMINATION OF EXPORT CONTROL GUIDELINES. OUR CASE BY CASE APPROACH REFLECTS THE INTRICACIES OF THE<br />ARRANGEMENTS, AND THE DIVERSE RANGE OF POLICY INTERESTS<br />WHICH VARIOUS CONTROLS SEEK TO FURTHER.<br />OUR APPROACH IS A CAUTIOUS ONE, AND DRAWS ON CONSULTATIVE<br />PROCESSES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE. BUT WHEREVER CONTROLS DO NOT<br />SERVE LEGITIMATE ENDS OR INVOLVE EXCESSIVE COSTS, OUR<br />INTENTION IS THAT THEY SHOULD BE RELAXED OR ABOLISHED AS<br />SOON AS POSSIBLE.<br />TODAY I WISH TO REPORT TO YOU THE STATE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />THINKING IN THREE AREAS: BAUXITE/ ALUMINA, PETROLEUM AND<br />COAL. CONSISTENT WITH OUR GENERAL APPROACH, THE MINISTER FOR TRADE<br />IS RELEASING FOR COMMENT A PAPER PROPOSING SUBSTANTIAL<br />CHANGES TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF CONTROLS APPLICABLE TO THE<br />EXPORT OF BAUXITE AND ALUMINA.<br />UNDER THE DRAFT PROPOSALS, COMPANIES NO LONGER WILL REQUIRE<br />PRIOR APPROVAL BEFORE ENTERING INTO NEGOTIATIONS, AS HAS<br />BEEN THE REQUIREMENT SINCE 1978. EXPORTERS SELLING TO<br />UNRELATED PARTIES CAN EXPECT TO RECEIVE AUTOMATIC EXPORT<br />APPROVAL, THOUGH IT WILL REMAIN OUR OBJECTIVE THAT PRICES<br />RECEIVED SHOULD BE COMMENSURATE WITH THE NATIONAL INTEREST.</p>
<p>CONTRACTS BETWEEN RELATED PARTIES OR NOT AT ARMS LENGTH<br />WILL, NATURALLY, CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY<br />TAX AUTHORITIES. HOWEVER, OPTIONS WILL BE DEVELOPED<br />FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COMPANIES INVOLVED TO<br />MINIMISE THE PROCEDURES REQUIRED WITH A VIEW TO REMOVING THE<br />EXISTING UNCERTAINTIES.<br />THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO HAD UNDER EXAMINATION EXPORT<br />CONTROLS APPLICABLE TO PETROLEUM. WE HAVE NOT, AT THIS<br />STAGE, TAKEN FINAL DECISIONS -IN RESPECT OF CRUDE OIL. BUT<br />THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW IN A POSITION TO ANNOUNCE THE<br />SUBSTANTIAL RELAXATION OF CONTROLS APPLIED TO MOST PETROLEUM<br />COMMODITIES. FROM TODAY, EXPORT CONTROLS FOR LPG, CONDENSATE<br />AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS ARE TO BE REDUCED TO A MONITORING<br />ROLE UNDER TERM APPROVALS. THIS WILL REPLACE THE CURRENT<br />CARGO-BY-CARGO OR QUARTERLY APPROVALS, AND PROVIDE GREATER<br />CERTAINTY TO EXPORTERS SEEKING PROFITABLE OPPORTUNITIES IN<br />CURRENT TRADING CONDITIONS. A CONDITION OF THE RELAXATION<br />IS THAT COMPANIES CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT<br />DOMESTIC PETROLEUM POLICIES, AND OTHER POLICIES SUCH AS THE<br />PROHIBITION ON EXPORTS TO SOUTH AFRICA.<br />THE MINISTER FOR TRADE HAS BEEN CONSULTING FOR SOME MONTHS<br />WITH UNIONS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF BUSINESS INTERESTS IN THE<br />COAL INDUSTRY ON EXPORT CONTROL MATTERS. THE GOVERNMENT IS<br />CONSCIOUS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COAL MARKET HAS BEEN<br />AFFECTED IN RECENT TIMES BY A RANGE OF FACTORS SUCH AS<br />CHANGING PATTERNS OF DEMAND, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND RAPID<br />TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES. THESE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE COMPLICATED<br />THE OPERATION OF EXISTING EXPORT CONTROLS.<br />IN VIEW OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COAL INDUSTRY FOR<br />AUSTRALIA'S EXPORT EARNINGS AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE IN THE<br />DOMESTIC ECONOMY, THE GOVERNMENT IS CONTINUING ITS<br />CONSULTATIONS WITH THE AIM OF EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS<br />OF THE EXISTING CONTROLS IN MEETING THEIR STATED OBJECTIVES.<br />THE GOVERNMENT HAS RECENTLY CONDUCTED A THOROUGH REVIEW OF<br />FOREIGN INVESTMENT POLICY. THIS POLICY HAS BROAD COMMUNITY<br />SUPPORT, REFLECTING THE STRONGLY HELD BELIEF THAT IT IS<br />ESSENTIAL TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN, ON THE ONE HAND, THE<br />NEED TO ATTRACT FOREIGN CAPITAL AND EXPERTISE IN ORDER TO<br />SUSTAIN GROWTH AND, ON THE OTHER, THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT<br />FOREIGN INVESTMENT IS WORTHWHILE AND THAT AUSTRALIANS<br />RECEIVE A FAIR SHARE OF THE FRUITS OF GROWTH.<br />THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ACCEPTED IN FULL THE RECOMMENDATIONS<br />FOR SWEEPING LIBERALISATION PROPOSED BY THE BCA. BUT WE<br />HAVE GONE SOME WAY TO TAKE UP THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE BCA AND<br />HAVE ALSO IDENTIFIED OTHER AREAS WHERE A RELAXATION OF THE<br />POLICY REQUIREMENTS COULD BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT COMPROMISE TO<br />THE GOVERNMENT'S BASIC OBJECTIVES.</p>
<p>A MAJOR STEP THAT WE ARE TAKING IS TO ABOLISH THE SO-CALLED<br />" OPPORTUNITIES TEST". WE KNOW FROM OUR DISCUSSIONS THAT<br />THIS TEST HAS BECOME A CONSTANT IRRITANT TO FOREIGNERS<br />WISHING TO INVEST IN EXISTING BUSINESSES AND DOMESTIC<br />VENDORS. BUT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS IT HAS RARELY RESULTED<br />IN A SUCCESSFUL COMPETING AUSTRALIAN BIDDER COMING FORWARD.<br />HOWEVER, THE EXISTING AUSTRALIAN EQUITY PARTICIPATION<br />GUIDELINES IN RESPECT OF NEW MINING OR, WITH ONE EXCEPTION,<br />REAL ESTATE PROJECTS WILL BE MAINTAINED. THE EXCEPTION<br />RELATES TO SMALL DEVELOPMENTS FOR LATER RESALE, WHERE THE<br />GUIDELINE WILL BE ABOLISHED.<br />THE GOVERNMENT ALSO INTENDS TO ENSURE THAT THE SPUR TO<br />COMPETITION AND EFFICIENCY IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR<br />UNLEASHED BY OUR DEREGULATION OF THE BANKING SECTOR IS<br />MAINTAINED. ACCORDINGLY, PROPOSALS TO ESTABLISH NEW NON-BANK<br />INTERMEDIATIRES OR TO ACQUIRE AN INTEREST IN AN EXISTING<br />ENTITY WILL BE APPROVED, UNLESS IT IS DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY<br />ARE CONTRARY TO THE NATIONAL INTEREST. MOREOVER, POLICY<br />APPLICABLE TO THE INSURANCE SECTOR WILL BE EASED TO BRING IT<br />INTO LINE WITH THE APPROACH ADOPTED FOR THE SERVICES SECTOR<br />MORE GENERALLY, AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT PROPOSALS WILL NOW BE<br />APPROVED IF THEY DEMONSTRATE NET ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO<br />AUSTRALIA. IN ADDITION, ALL FOREIGN INVESTMENT POLICY THRESHOLDS ARE<br />BEING SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED.<br />TAKEN TOGETHER THESE POLICY CHANGES WILL SIGNIFICANTLY<br />REDUCE THE EXTENT OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT REGULATION THEY<br />WILL EITHER EXEMPT FROM EXAMINATION OR SIMPLIFY AND<br />STREAMLINE THE EXAMINATION PROCESS FOR AROUND 1/ 3 OF ALL<br />FOREIGN INVESTMENT PROPOSALS.<br />FOLLOWING OUR CONSULTATIONS WITH INTERESTED GROUPS, THE<br />GOVERNMENT HAS IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL PRIORITY<br />AREAS FOR DEREGULATORY ACTION.<br />THE LONG ADVOCATED NATIONAL UNIFORM CODE OF FOOD REGULATIONS<br />HAS BEEN AGREED TO IN PRINCIPLE AND IS CLOSE TO<br />IMPLEMENTATION. THE CURRENT NON-UNIFORMITY OF THESE<br />REGULATIONS IS ESTIMATED TO INVOLVE COSTS TO INDUSTRY OF<br />ABOUT $ 50 MILLION A YEAR.<br />PLANS FOR SIMILAR COMMONWEALTH-STATE CO-OPERATION WITH<br />RESPECT TO A NATIONAL BUILDING CODE AND CHEMICALS<br />NOTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT SCHEME ARE WELL ADVANCED.<br />THESE ARE IN ADDITION TO EXAMINATIONS ALREADY IN TRAIN WITH<br />STATES TO REMOVE STATE PURCHASING PREFERENCES AND TO<br />STANDARDIZE WEIGHTS AND MEASURES REGULATIONS.</p>
<p>RECENT REVISIONS TO ENTRY PROCESSING ARRANGEMENTS HAVE<br />SUBSTANTIALLY CUT SEA AND CARGO CUSTOMS CLEARANCE TIMES.<br />FURTHER REFORMS TO CUSTOMS ADMINISTRATION ARE PLANNED TO<br />SIMPLIFY CLEARANCE PROCESSES AND' FURTHER REDUCE COSTS.<br />ACTION HAS ALREADY BEEN TAKEN WHICH HAS STEMMED THE GROWTH<br />OF DUPLICATION OF STATISTICAL COLLECTIONS. MAJOR BUSINESS<br />ORGANISATIONS WILL NOW BE INVITED TO IDENTIFY EXISTING CASES<br />OF DUPLICATION WITH A VIEW TO. ELIMINATING THEM WHEREVER<br />POSSIBLE. FOLLOWING ON FROM THE SUBSTANTIAL DEREGULATION OF THE<br />BANKING SECTOR, OFFICIALS ARE TO EXAMINE THE SCOPE TO<br />RATIONALISE CONTROLS ON NON-BANK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WE<br />ALREADY HAVE REVIEWS AND STUDIES UNDERWAY OF THE REGULATION<br />OF THE TRANSPORT AND AVIATION INDUSTRIES.<br />A LARGE NUMBER OF INITIATIVES HAVE ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED<br />OR SET IN TRAIN IN RESPECT OF PRIMARY INDUSTRY REGULATIONS.<br />THESE INCLUDE REDUCED REGULATION OF WHEAT, CANNED FRUITS AND<br />EGG MARKETING. FURTHER ACTION IS PROPOSED TO MINIMISE THE<br />IMPACT ON COSTS OF THE EXPORT INSPECTION SERVICE, AND TO<br />CURB THE ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS ON THE TEN STATUTORY<br />MARKETING AUTHORITIES RESPONSIBLE TO THE MINISTER FOR<br />PRIM4ARY INDUSTRY.<br />A NUMBER OF COMPANIES PARTICIPATING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE<br />ACTION PILOT PROGRAM EXPRESSED INTEREST IN PROVIDING<br />WORK-BASED CHILD CARE FACILITIES FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES BUT<br />WERE FRUSTRATED BY REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE PROVISION OF<br />SUCH FACILITIES. THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO APPROACH THE<br />STATES TO ASK THEM TO REMOVE EXISTING LICENSING REQUIREMENTS<br />AND REGULATIONS RESTRICTING CHILD CARE FACILITIES TO GROUND<br />FLOOR LOCATIONS.<br />MANY OF THESE AREAS REQUIRE THE CO-OPERATION OF STATE<br />GOVERNMENTS, BUSINESS AND UNIONS IF MEANINGFUL PROGRESS IS<br />TO BE MADE. I TRUST THAT SUCH CO-OPERATION WILL BE<br />FORTHCOMING AND TIMELY.<br />THE INITIATIVES TAKEN OVER THE PAST YEAR OR SO, AND THOSE<br />ANNOUNCED TODAY, GIVE CREDENCE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES<br />ON BUSINESS REGULATION. AND IN CASES WHERE IT CAN BE<br />CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THAT DEREGULATION IS IN THE BEST<br />INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC OR WHERE MORE EFFICIENT<br />ADMINISTRATION WILL REDUCE THE BURDEN ON BUSINESS, WE WILL<br />CONTINUE TO TAKE SUCH ACTIONS.</p>
<p>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN<br />I HAVE JUST RETURNED FROM THE MEETING OF THE COMMONWEALTH<br />HEADS OF GOVERNMENT IN THE BAHAMAS. AMONGST OTHER THINGS<br />THIS BROUGHT HOME TO ME YET AGAIN THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF<br />AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE: NOT FOR US THE 13 PER<br />CENT UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM; NOR THE 16<br />PER CENT INFLATION RATE OF NEW ZEALAND; NOR THE MAMMOTH 7<br />PER CENT OF GDP BUDGET DEFICIT OF CANADA. AND THE ECONOMIC<br />SITUATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE<br />COMMONWEALTH IS OF COURSE MUCH MORE SERIOUS.<br />ALL AUSTRALIANS, INCLUDING BUSINESSES AND UNIONS, CAN<br />JUSTIFIABLY FEEL PROUD OF WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED. WE SHOULD<br />ALL RECOGNISE THE CRUCIAL ROLE WHICH CO-OPERATION AND<br />CONSENSUS HAS PLAYED IN BRINGING THOSE ACHIEVEMENTS ABOUT;<br />AND COMMIT OURSELVES ONCE AGAIN TO CONTINUE TO WORK FOR A<br />BETTER AUSTRALIA.<br />THE WORLD DOES NOT OWE US A LIVING. CONTINUED ECONOMIC<br />SUCCESS NEEDS TO BE WORKED AT, TO BE EARNED. WE MUST ALL<br />REMEMBER THAT IMPERATIVE AND STRIVE FOR THE REWARDS WHICH<br />ONLY SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH CAN BRING.<br />L</p>
