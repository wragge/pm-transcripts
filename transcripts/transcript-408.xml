ITO0. 3 TV REICORDING. " 1TAL. K TO TY2 NATTG~ IV~<br />
BY THE PT1: 1 1 TbT. HON R G ,13<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I appear to be back once more at the schoolmaster's<br />
desk but I hope you'll forgive me. But there are various<br />
aspects of the election that I want to cover, so far as I can,<br />
in these little talks.<br />
Now in my Policy Speech, if you were enthusiastic<br />
enough to listen to it, I said something about Foreign Policy<br />
and the Treaties tha. t we've made with other countries. This<br />
time I though' I might say something to ycu about four outstanding<br />
problems in the international situation in the world.<br />
The first of them is Di. sarm! ament. I have a map<br />
here and I'll refer to it a little later on, but for the purpose<br />
of talking about disarmament perhaps I don't need a map very<br />
much, because there can be no disarmament in the true sense<br />
unless you ca-a have the Great Powers of the world, facing up<br />
to the realities and agreeing to something that is practical.<br />
Now the Commonwealth Prime 1inisters, of whom I was one, earlier<br />
this year met in London and we passed unanimously a resolution<br />
about disarmament, indicating the broad terms on which we thought<br />
it might be achieved and, in particular, we said that the<br />
beginning should be a suspension of nuclear tests. In other<br />
words, that none of the great Nuclear Powers and there are<br />
three of them four of them including Frahco<br />
should make any further tests, until arrangements had been made<br />
to suspend them altogether, with proper inspection, with some<br />
feeling of assurance on both sides that the other side wouldn't<br />
be playing a ' rick. That's fair enough. ell the discussions<br />
went on about the suspension of nuclear testing. The Western<br />
Powers held up; Great Britain didn't make another test; the<br />
United States didn't make another test; and after months of this,<br />
all of a sudden, Khrushchev announced that the Soviet Union was<br />
going to resume testing and since that day they've " fouped off',<br />
I think the expression is, about 30 bombs including some bombs<br />
of a size unparalled in modern history.<br />
Now thut is a tremendously serious problem. Vwhat<br />
are we to do about it? I for one would like to say to you, that<br />
I see no reason why the United States of America should consent<br />
to sit quietly while the Soviet Union goes on, and on, and on,<br />
testing weapons. The time comes when the United States of<br />
America, our powerful friend, will have to say, " Well we must<br />
defend ourselves. We must not fall behind." Otherwise the<br />
great deterrent of the bomb will cease to be a deterrent. But<br />
I think the important thing, is that the Great Powers should once<br />
more meet. They ought to meet before the end of this month in<br />
Geneva, and get back into the Conference Room, because so long<br />
as nations are testing these horrible weapons, so long wi]. l there<br />
be a great tendency to provide them for other powers and the<br />
more nations who have these weapons, the greater will be the<br />
risk of an explosion. Nowi that broadly represents our approach<br />
to this matter. Nowi the next matter that I want to mention to you is<br />
one of the " hot spots", as they call it, of the world, and that<br />
is the problem of Berlin and West Germany. If you can see this<br />
__ A </p>
<p>map, it shows in hatched lines here, West G'ermany; East Germany<br />
is here; Berlin is inside the area of East Germany,, like an island,<br />
with an air passage from it to the Western world, and with railway<br />
access to the Western world. But in itself, it's an island in<br />
the middle of what is now called East Germany.<br />
Now I don't want to go into the history of this matter,<br />
but I do want to say this to you, that the Western Powers have<br />
precisely the same rights, and for precisely the same reasons,<br />
in Berlin, as has the Soviet Union. They were the victorious<br />
allies in the war, each of them assumed responsibility for a<br />
Sector of Berlin with the right to have troops, with the right<br />
to maintain contact and access. This is beyond argument.<br />
Khrashchev himself doesn't endeavour to argue about it. But<br />
of course, what has happened is that the Soviet Union has, in<br />
effect, incc.-pora-Ged East Germany in the Soviet Union. They<br />
pretend it's an independent country. Of course it isn't. It's<br />
a satellite country. The best proof of that is that i~ n these<br />
recent disturbances.. there have been Soviet troops to the nuamber<br />
of many thousands, on the porimeter of Berlin, md now, fortifications<br />
between one part of the city and the other, are being set<br />
up. If Khrushchev If Khrushchev wants peace, as so many of his friends<br />
in Australia pretend they want peace, he can get it quite easily.<br />
He can say to the West " All right we will leave Berlin as it is.<br />
Each of us with his ovm rights. Each of us with his own access.,<br />
We will not prevent the people of East Germany from leaving East<br />
Germany if they want to, because this is their right under the<br />
Treaty of Human Rights." ( Under any conception of humanity a<br />
man ought to be allowed to leave his own country). " And therefore<br />
wea will agrce to free emigr'ation from East Germany into<br />
West Germany", an emigration which you know has been going on,<br />
until stopped by him recently, at a tremendous rate. And above<br />
all, he can say 11' 1jo can settle the question as to whether Germa. ny<br />
ought to be re-united. We'll agree to an election. A free<br />
election, in which both West and East Germans will vote."<br />
Now this may seem to you, or to me, pretty simple.<br />
Those are the conditions of peace. He won't have one of them.<br />
I tell you quite plainly, that in my view, in the view of my<br />
Government, the responsibility for the tension in relation to<br />
Ber-lin in Germany lies squarely at the doors of the Soviet Union.<br />
And if you want our position summed up I'll say we are completely<br />
on the side of the Wecstern Powers, on this matter.<br />
Nov! in the meantime, down here in the south -ast of Asi",<br />
in L-A-0-most of us call it Laos, but I believe correctly<br />
it ought -6o be called " Louse", but anyhow there it is, and this<br />
country is a peaceful rur! r'l country. Only wanting to live<br />
by itself, and yet it is bedevilled today by civil war, by<br />
Communist pressure from the north, by all kinds of agitations,<br />
which I've no doubt are designed to make that country a satellLV. t,-<br />
of the Communists, whether of the Soviet Union, or of Communist<br />
China, perhaps is no great matter. VWe of the West, if I may<br />
so dscrie us bu we include we of the South East because if<br />
we include the SEATO the South East Asian Treaty Nations,<br />
Pakistann, Thailand and thu Philippines and Australia and New<br />
Zealand-to say nothing of Great Britain and Ame rica, and France-.<br />
we have said that we don't want Laos to'be a satellite of any<br />
group in the world. I.-le wiant that country to be free, to be<br />
completely independent, to be neutral -and not to be aligned with </p>
<p>any other Piwer. Tho-L again, that's pretty simplc, isn't it?<br />
That's pretty straight forward. You couldn't find any fault<br />
with that. But for months at Geneva the Soviet Union has<br />
prolonged the negotiations and after all this time we now are<br />
not much nearer to achieving that peaceable result than we were<br />
three or four or five months ago,<br />
The same kind of trouble arises in relation to South<br />
Vietnam. A very gallant little country. An outpost:-of defence<br />
against Communism. While nearer to us we have our other problem,<br />
I hope that it's one that will be fixed up, and that's the problem<br />
of our attitude towards West New Guinea and the position of<br />
Indonesia in relation to it.<br />
Now I just want to make it clear to you you'll read<br />
some heate. statements occasionally we are on friendly terms<br />
with Indonesia. We ought to bel We want to bel There is a<br />
country which has development in front of us; a country that we<br />
can help; a country, thousands of whose students we take into<br />
Australia, we have every reason to be friendly with Indonesia,<br />
but we have one difference of opinion, and that's about West<br />
New Guinea, which Indonesia claims, and the soverignty over<br />
which is at present in the Netherlands.<br />
Now I'll make a long story short you've heard<br />
politicians say that before today, but I have to because the<br />
clock is moving on.-Our attitude towards the rost New Guinea<br />
problem is exactly the same as our attitude towards our own<br />
section of New Guinea. We believethat it is the duty of the<br />
occupying power to bring the people, the native, indigenous<br />
people of this island up to a state where they can govern themselves.<br />
We want none of this Congo business in New Guinea.<br />
We as kustralians are paying many millions a year to build up<br />
Papua and New Guinea on our side of the island. The Dutch have<br />
agreed that they are all for self-determination in the West, but<br />
Indonesia has said this is not a case for self-determination,<br />
" this part of New Guinea ought to belong to us and we are not<br />
offering self-determination to the local inhabitants."<br />
That's our difference. And you would think very<br />
poorly of me, or of my Government, if I didn't take the<br />
opportunity of making it quite clear that this business of<br />
self-determination, of bringing people to a point where they<br />
arc capable of governing themselves and then letting them<br />
make their own choice as to where they are going, ts is<br />
vital to us, because in a strange and rather democratic world,<br />
we Australians are democrats. We believe in democracy, and we<br />
believe that in due course, not too soon and not too late, but<br />
at the right time when we've brought education to the right point.<br />
health services to the right point; some understanding of local<br />
self-government to the right point; when the day comes after all<br />
those things, when the people of th-. t island, or our section of<br />
it, are able to detrmnino t+ hr fntur-we say they must and<br />
they should, and that's our view in relation to West New CGinea.<br />
And all I need say is that, so far as we understand the position,<br />
the Government of the Netherlands has exactly the same attitude<br />
towards that problem in West New Guinea as we have in thl East.<br />
And so you see in brief, peace, peace, the problem of<br />
peace. Wve are on the side of peace, The little survey that<br />
I've given you will, I hope, indicate to you that if there is any<br />
desire to break the peace, it resides outside this country, and<br />
outside those other great countries whose friend we are, </p>
