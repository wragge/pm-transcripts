<p>Tony Windsor long ago earned the respect and affection of his community in New England. In the past three years he has earned the respect and affection of many Australians from all political persuasions. Millions will be sorry to see him depart the Parliament at the coming election and I will be one of them.</p>
<p>Tony served ten years in the New South Wales Parliament, including a period of minority Government, and thirteen years in the Parliament of Australia, including three years of minority Government. He is one of Australia's great parliamentarians.</p>
<p>Tony Windsor's legacy can be seen all around the community where he lives and which he loves so much. I have seenfor myself the benefits high speed broadband already promises for the people of Armidale.</p>
<p>Many will think of the Environment Protection Bio-diversity Act Amendment (Water Trigger) as his signature achievement in this final term of public office and one characteristic of Tony himself: legislating a responsible and mature policy approach to an issue of great community concern among the people he represents.</p>
<p>I have enjoyed working with Tony Windsor and I wish him and Lyn many happy years together in retirement.</p>
