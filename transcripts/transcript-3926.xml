PJ1E M4INISTER' S INTERVIEW ON CHAN4NEL 7 NEWS 18 OCTOBER 1975<br />
bir Whitlam, what',; the possibility of a half Senate election through<br />
either deferral or rejection of Supply rather than the normal<br />
circumstances now?<br />
There has to be an election for half the Senate before the end of<br />
next June because half the senators' terms of office will expire<br />
at that time. Now it's usual for the new senators to be elected in<br />
November or DEcember beforehand and to do that one would issue<br />
writs about this time. I haven't made up my mind when I will advise<br />
the Governor-General to ask the State Governors to issue writs for<br />
that half Senate election. When I give him that advice will depend<br />
very largely how soon the Opposition makes uP its mind about the Bu dget.<br />
They are threaten" hg to reject the Budget Bills; they haven't yet<br />
done so. They've at this stage only carried a motion to defer<br />
debate on it.<br />
There' s obviously a deadlock -who is going to hack down?<br />
Well they'll have to. I can assure you that I shall not. There will<br />
not be an election for the House of Representatives just because the<br />
( Senate wants it.* The Governor-General issues the writs for a<br />
House of Representatives election on the advice of the Govern-ment.<br />
And the Government has a majority in the House of Representatives, and<br />
there is no sign that it will not keep that majority that is,~<br />
the Government will have an election for the House of Representatives<br />
at the ordinary timze in another eighteen mionths.<br />
Q: Well, Mr Fraser has suggested that the Governor-General could intervene.<br />
is that possible?<br />
No , it would be completely improper for the Governor-General to do it.<br />
it was possible for the Kings of England to do something like that a<br />
few centuries ago, but it is not p ossible today. But not only that, our<br />
Constitution expressly says that the writs for a House of Representatives<br />
election are issued by the Governor-General-in-Council that means<br />
by the Government.<br />
Just summing that up you don't believe, well you believe that the<br />
opposition will pass Supply; you don't believe there'll be a House-of<br />
Representatives election next year.<br />
I'm certain that there will not be a House of Representatives election<br />
just because the Senate says so. I'm not certain that the Opposition will<br />
pass the Budget in the Senate; I'm not certain, of t -at. I am certain<br />
of the other there will not be an election for the House of Representatives<br />
except at the proper time, and that is not determined by the Senate.<br />
Well, if it doesn't pass the Budget, can we really expect the sort of chaos<br />
that we've been hearing...<br />
There will be very great disruption in economic matters, businesses and so onvery<br />
great disruption, that is true. But that is what the Opposition is<br />
risking. </p>
