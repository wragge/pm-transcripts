    <content><![CDATA[<p>I have noted Commodore Bainimarama's decision not to attend the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders' Meeting in Niue.</p>
<p>His attendance was expected and there is no reason he should not do so.</p>
<p>Commodore Bainimarama promised Leaders at last year's Forum that he would hold elections in Fiji by March 2009. He has since announced that he will not hold elections on this timetable.</p>
<p>Commodore Bainimarama had the opportunity, through his attendance at the Forum, to explain this decision in person to Pacific leaders.</p>
<p>Fiji will still be, despite his absence, a major feature of Leaders' discussions in Niue. There is no reason why Commodore Bainimarama should not attend for those discussions, as he did last year.</p>
<p>Australia's view remains that Commodore Bainimarama should meet his solemn commitment to hold elections by March next year. </p>
