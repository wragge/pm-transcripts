FOR PRESS P. No. 87/ 1966<br />
DEATH OF DR. VERWOERD<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister, the Rt, Hon,<br />
J. Mchwen<br />
Mr. McEwen said that he had been greatly shocked<br />
to learn of the assassination of Dr. Verwoerd. He had today<br />
sent messages to South Africa's Acting Prime Minister, Dr.<br />
Donges, and to Mrs. Verwoerd expressing profound sympathy and<br />
regret over this tragic event.<br />
The Government had not been able to agree with<br />
some of the policies adopted by the South African Government,<br />
but it was always possible to respect Dr. Verwoerd's personal<br />
qualities. The ending of his life in this way in the heart<br />
of Parliament itself must be a matter for the greatest regret.<br />
CANBERRA, 7th September, 1966. </p>
