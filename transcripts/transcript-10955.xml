<p>Well thank you very much Gary Ringwood, to my ministerial colleagues</p>
<p>   John Anderson and Mark Vaile, to all of the representatives of Telstra</p>
<p>   who are here today, the other members of the Supermarket Council,</p>
<p>   ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>This is certainly a very important and a day of great pride and</p>
<p>   achievement for the Supermarket to Asia Council and I would like</p>
<p>   to record my personal gratitude to Gary Ringwood for all the energy</p>
<p>   that he has brought to bringing this project to fruition. There</p>
<p>   is a lot of good news around about the Australian economy at present</p>
<p>   and there's justifiable pride in the fact that the Australian</p>
<p>   economy has been able to weather the worst of the Asian economic</p>
<p>   downturn with less damage than many people believed as little as</p>
<p>   six or twelve months ago. And one of the good pieces of news that</p>
<p>   I heard this morning at the meeting of the Supermarket to Asia Council</p>
<p>   was that despite the downturn that occurred in the Asian-Pacific</p>
<p>   region, exports of Australian food over the last 12 months to all</p>
<p>   destinations have risen by something in the order of 10 per cent.</p>
<p>   And that is a remarkable achievement, given the difficulties in</p>
<p>   our part of the world.</p>
<p>The food industry in 1997/98 was valued at $72.6 billion and it</p>
<p>   employs more than 500,000 Australians across all regions. And in</p>
<p>   1997/98 total food exports were over $18 billion and nearly 60%</p>
<p>   of that was earned in Asia. And to continue to expand our markets,</p>
<p>   to make certain that the relative success that Australia has thus</p>
<p>   far had in escaping the impact of the Asian economic difficulties,</p>
<p>   to consolidate that success into greater achievements in the future</p>
<p>   we must continue to innovate and aggressively promote ourselves.</p>
<p>   And FoodConnect is a clear and practical manifestation of this.</p>
<p>   It is a demonstration of how the information economy is becoming</p>
<p>   increasingly relevant and crucial to our export industries such</p>
<p>   as agriculture. It will allow Australian producers to interact electronically</p>
<p>   with customers and businesses in their supply chain. Electronic</p>
<p>   commerce offers the potential to new and expanded markets and many</p>
<p>   new jobs in our agricultural industries as our efficient competitive</p>
<p>   producers take their products to the world. And it will make it</p>
<p>   much easier for small and medium sized businesses to get into export</p>
<p>   markets giving them larger markets and the capacity to invest and</p>
<p>   employ more people.</p>
<p>It is a very exciting development in our drive to become the supermarket</p>
<p>   to Asia. It would not have been possible without the assistance</p>
<p>   of Telstra and I do want to record the Government's gratitude</p>
<p>   to the company for the tremendous assistance and</p>
<p>   co-operation and great enthusiasm of which Gary has spoken that</p>
<p>   the Telstra organisation brought to this project. It is an exciting</p>
<p>   development. I thank all of those associated with it. It represents</p>
<p>   one of the great practical outcomes thus far of the Supermarket</p>
<p>   to Asia Council's work which I remain very enthusiastic about</p>
<p>   and have had the opportunity at the Council meeting this morning,</p>
<p>   the first since the recent federal election, to reaffirm my personal</p>
<p>   commitment to, and involvement in, and also the very strong commitment</p>
<p>   of the Government.</p>
<p>I'm therefore delighted to be here. I'm delighted to</p>
<p>   be part of the launch and to formally launch it. Thank you.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
