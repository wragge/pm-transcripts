PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 2 MAY 1991<br />
I have today received the final report produced by the<br />
Resource Assessment Commission on the Kakadu Conservation<br />
Zone. The Government will now study the report closely, with a<br />
view to making a decision on this issue by early June.<br />
The report will be tabled and publicly released as soon as<br />
multiple copies are available. This is likely to be early<br />
next week.<br />
The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Tickner, has<br />
received an Aboriginal Heritage report on the Kakadu<br />
Conservation Zone by Mr Justice Stewart, and the two reports<br />
will be considered in tandem by the Government.<br />
