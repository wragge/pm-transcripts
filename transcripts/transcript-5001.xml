PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 27MRH 9<br />
PARLIAMENTARY LUNCHEON FOR HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS<br />
THE PRINCE OF WALES<br />
This is a special occasion for us all, because it is a<br />
pleasure and privilege to have you, Sir, as our guest<br />
today in Parliament House.<br />
We welcome you most warmly, for you come, not only as the<br />
young and greatly respected Prince of Wales, but also as an<br />
old friend of many Australians inside and outside this place.<br />
Moreover, on this, your seventh visit to Australia in 13 years,<br />
you've made many new friends some of whom, if our newspaper<br />
photos are accurate, seemed to dispense with the formalities<br />
usually associated with greeting royalty. But perhaps that<br />
only serves to highlight the warm feelings that the people of<br />
Australia have for the Royal Family.<br />
Your participation in some special anniversaries in Australia<br />
has involved you in some hard travelling, but neither distances<br />
nor our ubiquitous bush flies nor even the rigorous attention<br />
of our press seem to deter you. The good humour with which you<br />
take it all is characteristic of the Royal Family.<br />
The Crown, of course, has a fundamental role to play in this<br />
Parliament. In the Constitition, our founding fathers wrote<br />
that " the legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested<br />
in a Federal Parliament which shall consist of the Queen, a<br />
Senate and a House of Representatives"<br />
This point was well made by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the<br />
Second when, as the first ruling Sovereign to visit Australia,<br />
she opened Federal Parliament here in 1954. Her Majesty told<br />
the assembled Members and Senators that and I quote " In<br />
a real sense you are here as my colleagues, friends and<br />
advisers." It is in that spirit, Your Royal Highness, we<br />
welcome you today.<br />
Just as the Monarchy has a strong and an assured place in'the<br />
hearts of the British people, so it has here in Australia.<br />
The traditions, the stability and the continuity of the British<br />
monarchy make one of the great stories of history. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
The ability and the readiness of the Crown to respond to<br />
the needs and aspirations of its people, its recognition of<br />
the need to changc as circumstances alter, has enabled<br />
the Monarchy to make a positive contribution to democratic<br />
government in the 20th Century. This was seen most clearly<br />
by the founders of our nation.<br />
Our form of Government, with the Crown at its Head, was<br />
deliberately chosen by the people of the six founding states.<br />
Their's was an act of free choice. In the words of the<br />
Constitution they: . agreed to unite in one indissoluble<br />
Federal Commonwealth under the Crown.. This was a natural<br />
decision for them to make. They had seen that the Monarchy<br />
could adapt to change and, as was expected, the Crown did not<br />
hinder nor resist the Australian people's deeply-felt yearning<br />
to govern themselves.<br />
Our history has been one in which the transition from colonialism<br />
to self-government has been peaceful and in which the Crown<br />
has played an important, constructive part.<br />
The Commonwealth of Nations is a further example of how the Crown<br />
responds to new situations. In not much more than half a century<br />
the " British Empire" became the " British Commonwealth" and<br />
later the " Commonwealth of ' Nations". Throughout, the Monarchy<br />
has retained its central role. It has given a focal point for<br />
the unity of the Commonwealth of Nations " a unity with<br />
diversity" as it has been described with members pledged to<br />
co-operate in the cause of " peace, liberty and progress"<br />
Last year, Australia hosted the Regional Meeting of Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government. It was a stimulating experience to<br />
sit in that company, seeking to find solutions to common problems<br />
by discussion and a readiness to co-operate for mutual benefit.<br />
The Crown helps to link nations of different races in a common<br />
purpose as it has linked the British people in a more direct<br />
way over all the years. Australia is proud of its links with<br />
the Throne-and I firmly believe that the great majority of<br />
Australians want our relationship with the Crown to continue.<br />
Of course, early Australians' links with England were of a<br />
more material kind they rattled when they walked. Yet from<br />
those early settlements has sprung a free, independent and prosperous<br />
nation which will be ever conscious of the traditions it has-,<br />
inherited.<br />
As the Monarchy has changed, so Australia has changed. In earlier<br />
times, we were very much an Anglo-Saxon community. Our geography<br />
made it '_ inevitable that one day that would end. The aftermath<br />
of the Second World War . accelerated that process. In the post-war<br />
period many people from many lands saw Australia as a land of<br />
political freedom, a land of economic opportunity. .3 </p>
<p>3<br />
The great migration brought with it significant changes to<br />
Australia. We are steadily developing into a multi-cultural<br />
society, where people from many backgrounds still cherish and<br />
preserve their traditions and at the same time contribute<br />
to the emergence of a distinctive Australian culture and<br />
the evolution of a stronger Australia.<br />
Together Australians are building a greater country to do<br />
this they have needed independence and freedom of spirit.<br />
Perhaps it is a consequence of this individualism that we do not think<br />
often enough about what Australia has done for our well-being<br />
and in turn what we can do for Australia. This suggests a<br />
need for a greater effort to focus attention on our nation's<br />
achievements and aspirations.<br />
Australia Day presents us with such an opportunity. It is a<br />
day on which we can reflect on the progress our nation has<br />
made and re-affirm our faith in the ability of Australians to<br />
meet the challenges of the future. The Government, therefore,<br />
has decided to appoint a new National Australia Day Committee.<br />
It will advise on and co-ordinate efforts to foster the observance<br />
of Australia Day through existing Australia Day organisations<br />
and through other cultural, historical, ethnic, sporting,<br />
children's and youth organisations. The committee will be selected<br />
from as wide a spectrum of the community as possible to<br />
reflect Australia's diversity. The new Australia Day committee<br />
will contribute, I hope, to giving expression to our national<br />
pride as an independent nation and a member of the Commonwealth<br />
of Nations, owing allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen.<br />
