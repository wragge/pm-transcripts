TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, BRISBANE, MARCH 9 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, could we get your response to the ANZ<br />
bank forecasts, no signs of a recovery for the economy'?<br />
PM: It's a job Vacancies series, it goes up and down a bit<br />
but it's been running the right way for quite a while<br />
so I wouldn't be focusing too much on that. SiLgns of<br />
recovery are ambiguous, that's why the Government did<br />
introduce the Statement it did to try and accelerate<br />
the recovery. And, of course, it will take some time<br />
for that to have effect. The first payments are not<br />
made until April, s0 it's going to take a while to have<br />
an affect.<br />
J: What about banks suggestion another cut in interest<br />
rates?<br />
PM: I'm not sure. Banks are sellers of money, they're<br />
always suggesting lower interest rates.<br />
J: So you're not considering that at all?<br />
PM: No.<br />
J: Are you confident figures due out later this week might<br />
be a bit more optimistic?<br />
PM: I think we are seeing, as I said, ambiguous signs.<br />
Some signs seemed as though recovery is underway,<br />
others don't. The popular interpretation is that we're<br />
at the bottom of the trough, that may well be -true.<br />
J: The job advertisements are a pretty good indicator, and<br />
they're showing a drop..<br />
PM: Yes, but they have been showing a rise for a few months<br />
now, so there may be some correction to the statistics. </p>
<p>2<br />
J: This drop puts it back to the amount it was in<br />
November, so really you haven't made any progress at<br />
all.<br />
PM: Again, I think it is patchy, it is very hard to tell.<br />
J: The report this morning says that during the last 12<br />
months the number of jobs has dropped.<br />
PM: Employment has risen, it's the job vacancies.<br />
Employment has risen in the period, but so too has<br />
unemployment and the job vacancies were showing signs<br />
of improvement over a period of time. But apparently<br />
in this month they have dropped again. What does that<br />
mean? It is very hard to say what it means.<br />
J: What do you think the figure will be later today?<br />
PM: I don't know, let's wait and see.<br />
J: Do you have any comment to make on the distribution of<br />
that speech you made in 1970?<br />
PM: No, it's only the Liberal Party doing what it normally<br />
does. In the 1970s they were still arguing for capital<br />
punishment and militant about the fact that God Save<br />
the Queen should still be the national anthem. They<br />
were then raving reactionaries and a lot of them still<br />
are now.<br />
J: Your attitudes have changed a lot since then,<br />
obviously?<br />
PM: I worked out that, in the period, women deserved a<br />
greater go and I tried to give it to them in the<br />
and I catalogued that today in the speech. I think<br />
this is yet to dawn on the Liberal Party.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you admitted that you're not widely<br />
regarded as a feminist. Have you got a lot of work to<br />
do until the next election?<br />
PM: As I went through some of the things I had done when in<br />
the 1980s I tried to do everything I could to give<br />
women an opportunity, mainly with employment. With<br />
things like access to superannuation, which they were<br />
formerly not given, they had no preserved benefits,<br />
with a child maintenance agency so that husbands who<br />
had responsibilities to them, faced them, the Family<br />
Allowance Supplement to low paid families, mostly of<br />
course supporting women. But one of the greatest<br />
burdens that we'll see on women in the future, were it<br />
ever to come to pass, would be the goods and services<br />
tax. I can think of no other issue which will put such<br />
a burden on women as the GST and that whole problem<br />
about income exchange within families, about transfers<br />
within families would have to be part and parcel of a<br />
per cent impost on food and clothing and all the </p>
<p>3<br />
things that women are, in the main, responsible for in<br />
the family.<br />
J: Prime Minister on another matter, do you intend to<br />
reignite the Special Premiers Conference agenda?<br />
PM: I'm not here to go around the world for sport. That's<br />
an issue, but the Premiers will be speaking to us about<br />
the Premiers Conference round. Some are supporting the<br />
reconvening on issues that were formerly part of the<br />
Special Premiers Conference agenda. Many of them of<br />
course have been adopted and I have, in the One Nation<br />
Statement, moved that debate along with some of the<br />
issues which were on the agenda. So I have got an open<br />
mind about it.<br />
J: Do you see a need for another Special Premiers<br />
Conference?<br />
PM: I think Australia has to be run co-operatively and it<br />
means I think, therefore, that the Commonwealth and the<br />
States have got to work together. What the processes<br />
are in that working together is a moot point, but the<br />
most important thing is that we should be working<br />
together and will be working together.<br />
ends. </p>
