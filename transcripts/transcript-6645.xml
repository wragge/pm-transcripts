PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 7 JUNE 1985<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AND THE PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
NEW SOUTH WALES RAINFORESTS NOMINATED TO<br />
WORLD HERITAGE LIST<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the Premier of New South<br />
Wales, Mr Wran, announced today that the New South Wales<br />
rainforests would be nominated to the World Heritage List.<br />
The nomination will be lodged with the Secretariat of the<br />
World Heritage Committee in Paris and will be considered by<br />
this UNESCO Committee during 1986.<br />
The World Heritage List, established under the UNESCO<br />
Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural<br />
and Natural Heritage ( the World Heritage Convention),<br />
identifies areas of " outstanding universal value", ther<br />
disappearance or destruction of which would constitute a<br />
" harmful impoverishment of the heritage of all nations of the<br />
world". Eighty three countries have signed the World Heritage<br />
Convention and to date there are some 188 properties on the<br />
World Heritage List. These properties range from the Grand<br />
Canyon in the USA, the Pyramid Fields of Egypt, Chartres<br />
Cathedral, France, and the Taj Mahal in India, to the<br />
Sagarmatha National Park ( containing Mt Everest) in Nepal.<br />
Five Australian properties are already on this list the<br />
Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu National Park, the Willandra Lakes<br />
Region, the Lord Howe Island Group and the Western Tasmania<br />
Wilderness National Parks.<br />
The rainforests now nominated comprise seven areas of New<br />
South Wales totalling 205,000 hectares. They contain nine<br />
National Parks, five Nature Reserves and three Flora </p>
<p>Reserves. A schedule of the nominated properties is<br />
attached.<br />
The Prime Minister and the Premier said the New South Wales<br />
rainforests represented both cool temperate and sub-tropical<br />
forests and were the descendants of vegetation types which<br />
occurred in Australia over many millions of years. As a<br />
reflection of the continuity of habitat the rainforests<br />
contained many " primitive" organisms, both plant and animal,<br />
of great value to science.<br />
The nominated sites also included significant samples of wet<br />
and dry sclerophyll forest and striking examples of landscape<br />
diversity. The rainforests are survivors of the ancient<br />
Gondwanan super-continent, the progenitor of all present<br />
southern continents. Their value is therefore not limited to<br />
Australia. An agreement was reached during 1984 with all Commonwealth,<br />
State and Territory Ministers responsible for wildlife<br />
conservation and national parks for dealing with the<br />
nomination of places in Australia for inclusion on the World<br />
Heritage List.<br />
Mr Hawke said the Commonwealth's announced policy in relation<br />
to world heritage nominations was not to take unilateral<br />
action and the Commonwealth Government was delighted to<br />
receive the New South Wales nomination.<br />
The Prime Minister paid tribute to the foresight of the New<br />
South Wales Government in protecting the State's rainforests.<br />
" Because of the legal protection and the active conservation<br />
measures taken by Mr Wran and his Ministers, the rainforests<br />
of New South Wales will be preserved for future generations<br />
of Australians", Mr Hawke said. </p>
