    <content><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations General Assembly Leaders’ Week is the biggest summit on the international calendar.</p>
<p>From 17-22 September, I will represent Australia at the 2016 UNGA in New York and engage with our US partners in Washington DC. I will be joined by the Foreign Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection.</p>
<p>These meetings will focus on matters of vital strategic interest to Australia, such as global stability and border security.</p>
<p>The Australia-US Alliance is the bedrock of Australian foreign and defence policy.   </p>
<p>While in New York, I will set out my vision for the US-Australia relationship in the 21st Century, including how we must seize new opportunities to further develop the bilateral trade and investment relationship through innovation.</p>
<p>At UNGA I will participate in summits on refugees and migration hosted by UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, and President Obama.</p>
<p>Australia has a positive story to tell. Our secure borders enable one of the most generous humanitarian programs in the world. Border security is an essential ingredient to a more orderly and effective response to refugees, and to eliminating incentives for transnational criminals that traffic for money and people.</p>
<p>My meetings in Washington DC with Secretary of Defence Carter and senior national security and intelligence officials will build on the discussions Vice President Biden and I had in Sydney this year around global and regional security issues.</p>
<p>In Washington I will also launch the inaugural Australia-United States Cyber Security Dialogue. This will establish the foundation for new US-Australian cooperation on law enforcement to address the current and emerging threats we face in the cyber age.</p>
