    <content><![CDATA[<p><font size="3">The reference to me in Candace Suttonâs column in <i>The Sun-Herald</i> today was both inaccurate and offensive.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">For the record, I have never expressed any views to my husband about suitable appointments to fill current vacancies on the ABC board. Nor has my husband sought my views.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Moreover, the columnâs suggestion that I would regard a personâs sexual preference as relevant to his or her suitability to fill a position on the board of the ABC is not only wrong but deeply offensive to me.</font></p>
