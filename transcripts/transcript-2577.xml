PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS: PM. No. 42/ 1972.<br />
TRADE PRACTICE AND OVERSEAS INVESTMENT<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. William<br />
McMahon,<br />
For some months past, the Government has been considering<br />
proposals for strengthening the restrictive trade practicos<br />
legislation of the Commonwealth.<br />
The issues involved have required careful and detailed<br />
considerationas they profoundly affect the future development and<br />
standards of efficiency of the Australian economy.<br />
They also influence the most effective allocation of<br />
resources with consequent long-term impact on cost and price inflation.<br />
The Government has now decided that the Attorney-General<br />
will make a comprehensive statement to Parliament during the<br />
present Session probably during the next two sitting weeks.<br />
The proposals have boon considered in the context of the<br />
Government's attitude to restrictive trade practices and also its<br />
belief in a free enterprise system under which citizens have as much<br />
freedom as possible to participate in the production and<br />
distribution of the nation's wealth.<br />
The Prime Minister went on to say that it would be<br />
remembered that the decision of the High Court in the Concrete<br />
Pipes Case had clarified the Commonwealth's Constitutional powers<br />
in the area of restrictive practices and the extent of its<br />
legislative capacity in this area.<br />
The Government recognises the impact that such legislation<br />
can and will have on the future development of this country.<br />
It has therefore decided that the appropriate course is<br />
to make a statement to the Parliament for debate, as a means of<br />
informing the public mind, and as a basis on which discussions with<br />
industrial, commercial and other interests can take place before a<br />
bill is prepared. / 2 </p>
<p>During the present Session, a Treasury paper on<br />
overseas investment in Australia will also be tabled by the<br />
Treasurer. This paper will not put forward policy proposals but<br />
will again provide the basis for discussion of a large range of<br />
issues concerning the general field of overseas investment in<br />
Australia and the desirability of controlling capital inflows in<br />
the interests of the Australian people.<br />
It, too, will assist the Government to arrive at<br />
decisions in this area of private capital inflows.<br />
CANBERRA, 3 May, 1972. </p>
