PRIME MINISTER<br />
FORMEDIA 6 JUNE 1984<br />
The Prime Minister today sent the following message to the<br />
Queensland Premier, Mr Bjelke-Petersen;<br />
" My dear Premier,<br />
I note that 1984 is a special year in Queensland<br />
as it marks the 125th Anniversary of Statehood.<br />
On behalf of the Commonwealth Government, and all<br />
Australians I extend congratulations to the people<br />
of Queensland on achieving such a significant<br />
milestone. This year, in particular, Queensland people can look<br />
back with pride at the growth and development of the<br />
State since 1859 and look ahead with anticipation<br />
to continued achievement in the future.<br />
Yours sincerly,<br />
Bob Hawke." </p>
