Prime Minister Julia Gillard today paid tribute to one of Australia's greatest nation-builders and former Prime Ministers, Ben Chifley, by officially opening the Chifley Home Education Centre in Bathurst.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister joined Chifley family members and the Mayor of Bathurst Regional Council, Paul Toole, at the Chifleys' Bathurst home, which will host the new education centre.</p>
<p>The new Chifley Home Education Centre documents the many reforms Ben Chifley achieved for our nation including:</p>
<p> * 	Laying the foundations for Australia's post-war economic boom with reforms like uniform national taxation and policies for full employment;<br />
 * 	establishing unemployment and sickness benefits;<br />
 * 	expanding access to a university education;<br />
 * 	introducing federal funding of public hospitals and the creation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme;<br />
 * 	welcoming refugees from war-ravaged Europe as part of the post-war immigration boom; and<br />
 * 	giving Australia a leadership role in the establishment of the United Nations.</p>
<p>The new centre also recognises the construction of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme, a project which is widely credited as one of Chifley's finest achievements and recognised internationally as one of the great engineering feats of the world.</p>
<p>Speaking at the site, the Prime Minister said the Chifley Home Education Centre would help enrich the cultural identity of both Bathurst and the nation as a whole.</p>
<p>In the darkest days of the Second World War, Labor was called on to lead the nation through a very tumultuous period of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Against the odds, the legendary leadership of John Curtin and Ben Chifley reconstructed the nation and prepared it for peace and a new global order.</p>
<p>The Busby Street site served as the only home of Ben Chifley and his wife, Elizabeth, and was opened as a memorial to the former Prime Minister in 1973.</p>
<p>The new extension to the centre includes exhibition areas, a museum shop, and an interactive education room with period furnishings and historical artefacts.</p>
<p>The $540,000 project was funded by the Australian Government, Arts NSW and the Bathurst Regional Council. </p>
