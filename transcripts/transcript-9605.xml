ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
YOKOHAMA WAR CEMETERY AT HODOGAYA SATURDAY, 27<br />
MAY 1995.<br />
We are here to mourni the loss of the 280 Australians buried here and to give<br />
thanks.<br />
We mourn because they died young and far from home and did not have a<br />
chance to live out their lives in the country they loved, among the people they<br />
loved. We mourn because they were Australians like ourselves and they suffered<br />
cruelly. We mourn because they remind us of the 17,000 other Australians who died<br />
in the war against Japan, almost half of them as prisoners; and of the<br />
millions of others who died in that war.<br />
And we give thanks because it was by the courage and sacrifice of people<br />
like these that our country was saved.<br />
It is because they loved freedom that we enjoy freedom.<br />
It is because they loved and believed in Australia that we have an Australia to<br />
love and believe in today.<br />
We give thanks because they set us an example by which to live. Their<br />
graves remind us of our duty to Australia.<br />
These Australians endured forced labour and imprisonment.<br />
They died of inhuman treatment and neglect.<br />
We know that what they went through others went through in prison camps in<br />
other parts of Asia in Burma and Thailand, Borneo and Ambon.<br />
We will never forget the evil that was done to our fellow Aus tralians. </p>
<p>2<br />
And we believe that Japan should not allow these events to be forgotten.<br />
We believe that our friendship will be stronger if the truth about these events<br />
is known to the Japanese people and we are pleased that the Japanese<br />
government has taken steps to make it known.<br />
As Australia remembers the end of the war this year we honour all those who<br />
fought and died. And we remember all the innocent lives that were lost.<br />
We pledge ourselves to see that these things do not happen again.<br />
For that reason we also pay tribute to those who have had the vision and<br />
faith to build a partnership between our two countries.<br />
They saw that their duty to the dead was a duty to the living.<br />
We could pay no greater tribute to the Australians buried here than to<br />
dedicate ourselves to another fifty years of peace and friendship between<br />
Australia and Japan.<br />
Among these graves we remember the terrible suffering and destruction that<br />
the war inflicted on a generation.<br />
And we are reminded that our greatest gifts are peace and freedom and our<br />
greatest duty to preserve them.<br />
For that we give thanks to these Australians.<br />
They died so far from home, but we know they are here and we will never<br />
forget them.<br />
ENDS </p>
