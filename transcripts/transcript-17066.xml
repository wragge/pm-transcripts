    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australians today can all welcome the decision by the Vatican to canonise Blessed Mary MacKillop, who will be Australia's first saint.</p>
<p>This is a deeply significant announcement for the five million Australians of Catholic faith, and for all Australians whether of Catholic faith or not.</p>
<p>Mary MacKillop is an extraordinary figure in Australian history; a pioneering woman who dedicated her life to the poor and to advancing the cause of social justice in Australia.</p>
<p>She gave many children the opportunity of an education and worked for the homeless, the destitute and the marginalised. In a time when many children grew up in poverty and had little chance of gaining access to a decent education, Mary MacKillop changed the course of many young Australians' lives.</p>
<p>Today, a century after her passing, the work that Mary MacKillop began continues through the Sisters of St Joseph, whom I have had the opportunity to visit at the Mary MacKillop Place in North Sydney.</p>
<p>Mary MacKillop's story is a great inspiration to all Australians, and all Australians can welcome today's announcement. </p>
