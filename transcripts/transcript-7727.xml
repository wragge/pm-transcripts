I<br />
' Mf~ i<br />
Minister of Poland, Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki:<br />
Please accept my personal/ congratulations on the<br />
historic occasion of your election to the position of<br />
Prime Minister of Poland. The overwhelming majority by<br />
which you were elected in the Parliament shows the<br />
support and respect which you enjoy. I<br />
For a long time, Australians have watched with sympathy<br />
and hope the struggle of Solidarity to obtain basic<br />
rights and freedoms for the Polish people. Your election<br />
as Prime Minister will realise many of the desires of<br />
the Polish people for a Poland which is democratically<br />
and justly governed.<br />
During this time of immense chag-in Poland, you can be<br />
assured of my government's support. i We will assist, to<br />
the extent possible, the process of reform in Poland. I<br />
look forward to working closely-with you.<br />
