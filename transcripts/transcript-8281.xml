ASIA-PACIFIC ECONOMIC INSIGHT CONFERENCE<br />
CANBERRA 15 APRIL 1991<br />
Ross Garnaut<br />
Distinguished guests<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
This Conference meets at a time of profound economic change<br />
within Australia, within our region and in the wider world.<br />
I am pleasqd to be able to address you tonight, as I<br />
strongly b~ lieve that the Conference will serve the vital<br />
purpose of alerting Australians to the directions in which<br />
the Asia Pacific economies are evolving and to the<br />
opportunities these trends present for Australia.<br />
It is important at such a time that decision makers in<br />
Australia and abroad seek to understand this dynamic process<br />
of change, and to master it not only so that pitfalls can<br />
be avoided but also so that the undoubted opportunities that<br />
await us as a nation and a region can be maximised and<br />
harnessed to the pursuit of higher living standards.<br />
It is within this spirit that I wish to speak tonight on the<br />
changes underway in Australia by recalling, first, how far<br />
we have come, before outlining to you what we need to do to<br />
make further progress.<br />
Throughout most of this century, Australia sought<br />
deavelopment in comparative isolation isolation based not<br />
only on our distance from markets but also, perhaps<br />
paradoxically, on the bounty of the country which reduced<br />
the pressure on us to search for overseas markets for<br />
anything other than agricultural or mineral products.<br />
But over recent years Australians have been learning that we<br />
ax~ e doing ourselves a great disservice if we pretend that<br />
Australian isolation from the challenges of the region and<br />
the world can somehow continue to be the norm.<br />
This is reflected in changes in our foreign policy, in our<br />
d: scrimination-free immigration policy, and in many aspects<br />
of our national life. But my subject tonight is the<br />
internationalisation of Australian economic policy and<br />
pearspectives, and our increasing enmeshment in the economies<br />
of the region.<br />
6504~ A<br />

<p>Australia has always been a plentiful producer of primary<br />
goods, helping feed the people of the region and fuel the<br />
burgeoning industries of North East Asia. But never before<br />
have we had such legitimate confidence that we could play a<br />
role as full regional partners across the spectrum of<br />
economic activity. That is the prospect that is at hand<br />
today, replete with significance for all of us.<br />
Since 1983 we have gone a long way up the boulder-strewn and<br />
arduous uphill road of reforming our domestic economic<br />
institutions and attitudes.<br />
Our goal is an Australia with a vibrant flexible economy,<br />
enmeshed with our trading partners in our region and beyond<br />
an Australia wheres work practices, business management and<br />
academic excellence match or better the best in the worldan<br />
Australia where we maximise the potential of our people<br />
and ensure them the economic and political opportunity to<br />
reach that potential.<br />
Our determination to achieve these goals was exemplified in<br />
the recent statement I delivered to Parliament, Building R<br />
nnmp~ titjvA Auigtral La<br />
No better symbol, anad proof, of Australia's historic<br />
preference for isola~ tion over international enmeshment can<br />
be found than our historic legacy of tariff protection. It<br />
is that legacy that this Government has substantially<br />
reduced and, with the 12 March statement, now virtually<br />
eliminated. In summary, I announced the Goverment's decision to<br />
reduce tariffs for most manufactured products Vo 5 per<br />
cent by 1996; and<br />
reduce tariffs to 25 percent on textiles, clothing and<br />
footwear and to 15 percent on passenger motor vehicles<br />
by the year 2000<br />
Turning the pernicious and pervasive tide of Australia's<br />
traditional protectionism will, I am confident, be regarded<br />
as a watershed decision in the history of this nation. The<br />
fact is, behind high tariff walls, Australian industry was<br />
able to regard the domestic market as its captive. Industry<br />
was given little incentive to improve the quality of its<br />
product or adopt nesw technology. Managers and workers were<br />
able to eschew international best practice as an<br />
irrelevancy, and indulge in debilitating confrontation<br />
instead of cooperation.<br />
Worse still, tariff~ s damaged our traditional efficient<br />
export industries agriculture and mining by raising<br />
input prices directly, and encouraging and facilitating<br />
excessive wage increases. 63505 </p>
<p>It was the Australian consumer who paid the immediate<br />
penalty of tariffsa: higher prices. But ultimately it was<br />
the Australian economy as a whole that suffered simply,<br />
because Australian industry was incapable of competing on<br />
world markets and all this at a time when the rest of the<br />
world, including our own region, was growing rapidly.<br />
It is important that you understand that these latest tariff<br />
reductions formed part of a wider economic statement aimed<br />
at lifting Austrhlian competitiveness through further tax<br />
reforms, new support for training for managers and<br />
apprentices, and new initiatives to help build Australia as<br />
a " clever country".<br />
One specific initiative that may be of interest to this<br />
audience is our new scheme to facilitate work experience for<br />
our graduates and corporate executives in the Asia Pacific<br />
region. In turn I want to stress that this package of reforms is<br />
complemenfpary to the developing momentum of micro economic<br />
reform in other areas in particular, our unprecedented<br />
campaign to lift the productivity of our waterfront and land<br />
transport systems, historic changes to telecommunications<br />
and domestic aviation, and pathbreaking reforms in workplace<br />
culture and in eliminating the duplications of our Federal<br />
system of Government.<br />
And these in turn must be seen in the context of Australia's<br />
international initiatives. I refer in particular to our<br />
regional diplomacy, spearheaded by my 1989 proposal to<br />
establish a new forum of Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation,<br />
and our campaign as founder and leader of the Cairns Group<br />
in the Uruguay Round of GATT to strengthen the multilateral<br />
trading system.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The building of an internationally competitive Australia has<br />
been a tough task. There is a long way to go before our<br />
people are making full use of their talents in intensive<br />
-two-way trade, beyond primary products, in advanced<br />
manufactured goods and services. But we take some comfort<br />
from the fact that, despite the clouds and gloom of<br />
recession, the long-term structural change that we need is<br />
shining through.<br />
En the second half of the 1970' s our manufacturing exports<br />
grew by a compound rate of 1.4% a year. In the first half<br />
of the 1980' s that had lifted to 4.5% per year. In the<br />
second half of the 1980' s we had improved the rate to nearly<br />
: L3 per year. Growth over the past two years is the<br />
strongest yet, at an average rate of 24% per year. This has<br />
contributed to recent balance of payments figures, showing<br />
t: hat the balance of our merchandise trade has been in<br />
surplus for 9 of the last 12 months and that exports were at<br />
a record level of $ 4,452 million in February.<br />
6 506 </p>
<p>By comparison with this encouraging progress in<br />
manufacturing exports, our agricultural exports have<br />
stalled. In the second half of the 1970' s our agricultural<br />
exports grew by nearly 9t per year. By contrast, in the<br />
1980s, despite the large productivity gains of our farmers,<br />
they have been stagnant.<br />
A large part of the reason is clear: agriculture, as you all<br />
know, stands out as a dishonourable exception to the general<br />
commitment by advanced countries to liberal trade.<br />
The combined farm subsidies of the EC, and to a lesser<br />
extent the US and Japan, have recently averaged more than<br />
$ 300 billion a year for a sector that produces about 3% of<br />
their GDP. But this direct cost on their consumers,<br />
manufactures and service industries does not stop there. A<br />
bloated, subsidised agricultural sector restrains the<br />
standards of living in the advanced countries and blocks<br />
development and trade expansion in developing countries, and<br />
in primary exporting countries, like Australia. That is a<br />
pernicious syndrome that we must all work to reverse.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I do not pretend that Australia is anywhere near the end of<br />
our reform path or that our achievements to date are unique<br />
in the region.<br />
But I do say this. Given the magnitude of the reform task<br />
that lay ahead of us, we have made significant progress.<br />
Australia is entitled therefore to expect that economically<br />
developed countries of our region, such as Japan and Korea<br />
will examine their own practices in agricultural protection<br />
and join with us in pressing the EC and United States, in<br />
order of priority, to cease their export subsidieqland wind<br />
back import restrictions, a<br />
Failure to secure commitment to real reform in these areas<br />
will not only jeopardise the potential benefits that we know<br />
will flow from the successful conclusion of the Uruguay<br />
Round, it will also cripple the ability of the world trading<br />
system to continue to provide the engine for further<br />
economic growth. Significantly whilst we will all suffer,<br />
those countries least down the path of economic development<br />
will be damaged the most.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
The excellent resource publication you have received as<br />
participants in this conference highlights the benefit to<br />
individual countries in our region and elsewhere of low<br />
inflation. For over twenty years Australia has in comparison with its<br />
trading partners b~ een a high inflation country. This factor<br />
has undermined our exporters' competitiveness and has warped<br />
the investment decisions of our business people and foreign<br />
investors. 6507 </p>
<p>We are now breaking through to be an economy of<br />
comparatively low inflation with a rate that, at 6.9% is<br />
below the OECD average and is trending substantially lower.<br />
The initiatives announced on 12 March will strengthen that<br />
downwards trend, bringing commensurate falls in interest<br />
rates. t<br />
With these economic foundations in place and the unique<br />
success of the Accord in our approach to industrial<br />
relations we will see the continued natural growth in our<br />
manufacturing and service areas coupled with continued<br />
performance of minerals development and exports.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
I have focussed on the changes we are making in Australia<br />
with, on the basis of the evidence I believe, some<br />
justif~. able pride in our achievements while acknowledging<br />
the process cannot stop.<br />
Change is occuring in our regional partners and in the 12<br />
March statement we acknowledged that with the decision to<br />
freeze preferential tariff levels for Hong Kong, Singapore,<br />
Korea and Taiwan. In this way we have preserved their<br />
positions whilst our general tariff levels move down to meet<br />
their present levels before both move to<br />
It would be remiss of me to fail to recognise the very real<br />
changes that have occurred elsewhere in our region. They<br />
have complemented our moves and stand to benefit our entire<br />
region. To mention all the countries or all the changes<br />
would take too long and would duplicate much of the program<br />
content of the conference.<br />
In our early meetings, the then Prime Minister of Japan,<br />
Mr Nakasone, and I focussed on the need for the multilateral<br />
trade negotiations, which was later launched as the Uruguay<br />
Round, to deal effectively with agriculture for the first<br />
time. We are getting closer but we are not there yet.<br />
Certainly we recognise the importance of Japan's step, after<br />
many and sometimes difficult discussions at many levels,<br />
including Prime Ministerial, to remove quotas from beef<br />
imports. Japan has also taken the less glamorous but equally<br />
important steps of addressing inadequacies in its anti trust<br />
laws and regulations inhibiting new entry of business.<br />
Protective restrictions on new shopping centre developments<br />
are to be revised. Since 1989 Japan has been the world's<br />
leading foreign aid donor and has kept approximately 80 per<br />
cent of that aid untied.<br />
In Korea there has been signficant reform of financial<br />
markets and structural reforms in the ownership and<br />
management of the large corporate groups.<br />
6508 </p>
<p>Indonesia has significantly removed restrictions on foreign<br />
investment projects, liberalised the financial sector,<br />
reduced maritime transport regulation, moved to a tariff<br />
basis for protection from quantitative restrictions and<br />
reduced some tariff levels and has started a program of<br />
improving the efficiency of its state enterprises that are<br />
involved in so many of the sectors of its economy.<br />
The striking similarity of the economic reform processes<br />
throughout our. region are indicative of the potential we<br />
have in the last decade of the twentieth century for closer<br />
economic cooperation for our mutual benefit.<br />
By our continuing to work together, recognising differences<br />
where they occur and drawing upon our divergent experiences<br />
to address the problems we will undoubtedly face, we can<br />
ensure that the powerful growth continues in East Asia, it<br />
spreads to more countries, including Australia, and that it<br />
brings prosperity to all of our peoples.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
The unique opportunity we have to work together for our<br />
future is clearly demonstrated in the Asia Pacific Economic<br />
Co-operation process.<br />
This flexible, dynamic process will further facilitate our<br />
ability to develop Individually and as a region. The APEC<br />
process is evolving in a way which complements existing<br />
regional and multilateral structures. I hope it will soon<br />
be extended to include the Peoples Republic of China, Taiwan<br />
and Hong Kong and scan thereafter other regional partners.<br />
APEC participants now account for 46% of world<br />
production and one third of world trade<br />
Our region is one of high growth, rising productivity<br />
and intensive trade and investment interaction.<br />
The underlying forces which gave rise to APEC will intensify<br />
in the coming decadei as the focus of world production and<br />
trade shifts increasingly towards the Pacific and as the<br />
Asia Pacific economies play a more active role in world<br />
affairs. The crucial interest for Asia Pacific economies is in<br />
developing a framework of support for, and commitment to,<br />
liberalising internLtional trade and economic policies.<br />
My Government has committed Australia irrevocably to this<br />
course. Cooperation in trade, investment, human resources<br />
development, and in specific sectors such as energy and<br />
tourism, can bring benefit to all APEC countries.<br />
Even in the collection and sharing of trade and investment<br />
data, there is much to be done 509 </p>
<p>-work on trade promotion within APEC, for example, has<br />
led to an important proposal by Singapore for the<br />
electronic exchange of a wide range of trade and<br />
industrial information among APEC economies, based on<br />
the Singapore Trade Development Board's Globalised<br />
Information Network.<br />
APEC has a complementary relationship with the Pacific<br />
Economic Co-operation Conference ( PECC) and the involvement<br />
of the business and research sectors, alongside officials,<br />
in identifying practical opportunities for economic cooperation<br />
within its various task forces and forums.<br />
PECC's work on fisheries and the regional outlook, for<br />
example, feed directly into the APEC process.<br />
In the area of energy, to take another example, the<br />
countries of the region face a number of common issues and<br />
challenges. In co-operation with PECC's Minerals and Energy<br />
Forum, APEC has a promising work program. Work in train on<br />
specific areas includes study of energy supply and demand in<br />
the region; energy conservation and efficiency; clean coal<br />
technology; and research and development and technology<br />
transfer, Significant progress has already been made on<br />
steps to improve energy data in the region. Ultimately,<br />
this work is likely to lead to improved forecasts, with<br />
major benefits in planning energy infrastructure required to<br />
meet rapidly growing energy demands in the region. The<br />
energy project has an important and practical focus on<br />
environmental issues.<br />
The participants in APEC start from the fundamental<br />
commitment to strengthening the open multilateral trading<br />
system APEC members must hold fast to that commitment and take<br />
the steps that are necessary to push it forward at the<br />
national and regional level<br />
I am pleased that non-disciminatory regional trade<br />
liberalisation is on the agenda for detailed<br />
consideration at the next Ministerial level meeting in<br />
Seoul later this year.<br />
APEC's work is being built upon foundations laid in PECC, in<br />
the Pacific Basin Economic Council of business leaders, and<br />
in the Pacific Trade and Development Conference Series. The<br />
meshing of academic, business and Government resources to<br />
define the problems we face, and to find the solutions, is<br />
essential. All these bodies engage in the vital and productive<br />
processes of exchanging ideas and experiences and<br />
identifying opportunities for the future. In this, the work<br />
of economists here tonight has done much to build the<br />
intellectual basis for Pacific Economic Co-operation.<br />
G3510 </p>
<p>The Australian Naticnal University has played a central and<br />
valued role in these endeavours.<br />
Tonight I would like to announce a modest initiative to<br />
strengthen further the intellectual sinews of Pacific<br />
economic co-operation. Economists through the region are<br />
familiar with the jajrna1~ fAI Pnfin Ennnomtn<br />
Litgratunrp, which has been produced at the Australian<br />
National University for several years. I am pleased to<br />
inform you that the Australian International Development<br />
Assistance Bureau is developing a program to distribute the<br />
journal through the APEC countries.<br />
I congratulate economists in the Research School of Pacific<br />
Studies, and Ernst and Young, for organising this<br />
Conference. The information and analysis you have assembled<br />
will contribute to enhancing Australia's performance in Asia<br />
and the Pacific. I wish you well in your consideration of<br />
the issues facing our region. 6511 </p>
