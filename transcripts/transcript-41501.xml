    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>HOST: </strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister good morning.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:  </strong></p>
<p>Good morning!</p>
<p><strong>HOST: </strong></p>
<p>Now are these new super tanks made out of steel and therefore can we export them to the United States and will Donald Trump say ‘no’?</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Well certainly we can export Australian steel to the United States and they’re going to be made out of Australian steel. They’re being made for the Australian Army. These are the latest capabilities, they’re Combat Reconnaissance Vehicles that are going to built here in Queensland. 21st century technology, advanced manufacturing, the greatest capability and of course, keeping our soldiers safe.</p>
<p><strong>HOST: </strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister it’s great when you sort of talk ‘work stuff’, that’s all very well but do you and Trump ever get personal, like do you ever, sort of, bring him a latte and go: “How’s it hanging?” Like do you talk about that personal stuff?</p>
<p><strong>HOST:</strong></p>
<p>There’s an expression.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Well, no I haven’t used that expression that’s for sure.</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p>No, no look, it is a good, friendly, warm relationship I have with the President. We spent time together with Melania and Lucy. I mean we’re obviously very different people, but we’ve both had long business careers before we went into politics and we’ve got a lot of friends in common. So we’ve hit it off well and that’s important.</p>
<p><strong>HOST: </strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister can we just throw something at you? We’re doing a big thing at the moment here at 97.3; ‘in your corner’, with bullying. Of course you’d be aware of all the campaigns that are happening with the National Day of Action Against Bullying coming up on Friday. Did you get bullied at school and did you have someone in your corner?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Well I think like most people I experienced some bullying when I was a younger kid at school. Yeah I guess I found teachers and older kids that were able to help you out. Look, I think this campaign against bullying is so important. Lucy and I spent some time recently with Dolly’s parents, with her Mum and Dad and her sister. That’s a terrible case, a terrible story.</p>
<p><strong>HOST: </strong></p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>We have to say that we are absolutely going to have zero tolerance for bullying. I think it goes beyond – obviously the cyber dimension is very significant, but you know, it goes beyond the cyber dimension. The fact is that with social media of course, the bullying - say in my generation - that stopped at the school gate, can follow you home.</p>
<p><strong>HOST: </strong></p>
<p>That’s where we had to stop the Prime Minister as you heard a moment ago. We thank Malcolm Turnbull very much for joining us this morning and also showing that the Federal Government are in your corner as well.</p>
<p><strong>[ENDS]</strong></p>
