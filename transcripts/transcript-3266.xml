PRIME MINISTER'S<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, CASTLEMAINE 14 May 1974<br />
PRIME MINISTER: at 11.00 o'clock and I wanted to see this<br />
century old market at Castlemaine, following on Mr Justice Oakes.<br />
Commitee on the National Estate report who we are going to<br />
restore thexEmsk to the cost of 46,000. xTxhavxalso I also have<br />
of course a a dutiable because my gxxahex grandfather Henry Hugh Gough<br />
Whitlam was born here, in 1856. I am'the most Victorian of all<br />
pi political leaders-in our nation. Are there any questions you'<br />
would like to ask me gentlemen.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Anthony has now said that it wouldn't be possible to.<br />
^ n freeze food prices, Mr Snedden says he is going to. Do you have.-<br />
any opinion on whether or not that it is possible<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm ti d of trying to reconcile Mr Snedden and<br />
Mr Anthony. My own view is that one cannot realistically freeze the<br />
price of foods stuffs such as meat because as Mr Snedden himself<br />
confessed if one tries to do that, then graziers and sheep men<br />
will keep their cattle and sheep from the abitors. I don't regard<br />
it as any solution to follow Mr Snedden's idea that in-that case<br />
one could import meat. Meat hasn't been imported into Australia<br />
as I said at the Sydney Opera House yesterday, since Bennelong was. a<br />
lady boy, since Governor Philipp planted the Union Jack at Circular<br />
Quay. My govt took this attitude when the Parliamentary Committde<br />
on Prices made a recommendation about meat, the govt rejected the<br />
recommendation, believed it wasn't a realistic one. I agree with<br />
' Mr Anthony on this, I think Mr Snedden was just thrashing about on<br />
this one matter an as he has on all his last minute proposals for<br />
income and prices freezes. . J<br />
QUESTION: I noticed that the Mr. Snedden said that the Liberal Govt<br />
would spendx$ Af $ 200 Ezs million less on education..... </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I though t he said $ 300 million less....<br />
QUESTION: You may be right....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I was going on the Sun-Pic which said $ 300 million<br />
less.<br />
-QUESTION: Would that amount be important, would there be many<br />
S schools suffer.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: He doesn't specify. in wki rx ia what field of<br />
education he would reduce the prospective... what field or fields<br />
Sof education he would reduce the prospective expenditure. It may<br />
h be at the tetiary level, the universities, colleges of advanced<br />
education and both Government and non-Government teachers colleges<br />
for which my Government has made commitments. Presumbaly however,<br />
: the reduction in expenditure would mainly be at the expense of the'<br />
S secondary and primary schools. I suppose technical colleges are<br />
partly secondary and partly tertiary. He doesn't specify where<br />
Sthe reduction will be. It will be appreciated that the expa<br />
expenditure that my Government has undertaken in education has in'<br />
every case been on the advice of expert committees. For primary<br />
Sandsecondary schools it was. on the recommendation of the Karmel<br />
:~ Committee; the interim committee for the Schools Commission. On<br />
S. behalf of universities, it's been on the recommendation of the<br />
Universities Commission under Professor Karmel. In the colleges<br />
of advanced education it's been on the recommendation of the<br />
commission on advanced education under Swanson. Now so... And then<br />
the prospective expenditure that we will make on technical and further<br />
education will be on the basis of the recommendations of the tfn X<br />
Committee which was tabled just -before the Parliament was dissoljed,.<br />
It may be that there will be some expenditures which would relate to<br />
education on the recommendation of the Cochran ; Committee on training<br />
adult training and re-training and also of this inter-departmental A_<br />
committee which has reported on its findings concerning re-training<br />
1 ~-i </p>
<p>schemes in comparable countries. We haven't yet undertaken,<br />
we haven't yet as a government yet collectively endorsed the<br />
recommendations or haven't Sxax received the recommendations<br />
of the x Cohrane Committee and we haven't considered the<br />
recommendations of the Inter-departmental committee. The Kanla<br />
Committees report we have accepted in principle. David Kennedy,<br />
whose interest in education matters you'll all remember from<br />
his 3 years in the House of Representatives reminds me that<br />
there are on top of this, commitments concerning fees being<br />
S abolished and also living allowances being increased in number<br />
and amount. I mention all these matters they are all subjects<br />
of reports which we have received and we have also au accepted<br />
the recommendations of reports in the educational field and I<br />
have no doubt that we will acceptxtk for the coming budget<br />
that means for the scholarsatic and admÃ± cxaE academic year<br />
1975 and subsequenti years the recomendations of these<br />
. expert. After all they have been' uamxzxs unaminous recommendation.<br />
from widely representative committees and nobody fxom has<br />
. criticised them. Now I don't know which of these expenditures<br />
Mr Snedden is threatening to cut I d never heard him speci. fy<br />
what recommendations of these committees he rejects, in fact<br />
I don't remember him speaking on education matters at all in the<br />
S ' Parliament. QUESTION: Prime Minister, yesterday Mr Fairbairn challenged<br />
you to give a undertaking that your govt wouldn't increase the<br />
price of petrol, ( uncleac) he said that because of the ( unclear)<br />
increases on petrol ( unclear) petrol prices?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well about the prices o for Australian<br />
crude oil. We will not allow that price to be increased before<br />
the agreement expires in Sept next year. I would think it most<br />
unlikely that thereafter we would agree to any increase in the<br />
prices crude oil coming from deposits already discovered and </p>
<p>4.<br />
operating. I believe that Mr Fairbairn has been too naive<br />
in accepting the propaganda of the oil$ companies in the Bassy..<br />
Strait case its an overseas oil company ESSO, there is not a<br />
shred of. evidence to show that oil exploration in Australia is*<br />
S more expensive or that discoveries are less profitable than is<br />
S the case in any other country, its true that the price of crude.<br />
oil since the September War last year has increased in most oil<br />
producing countries it has increased not because of.* any increase<br />
in the cost of exploration or extractionxfor transport, its<br />
not been caused by any increase in the rake-off which the<br />
oil companies exact, its because. of the increase in the taxes<br />
and royalities imposed by the countries where the oil is found.<br />
Andx There is nothing to sxwh show that oil-exploration in<br />
Australia is more expensive or less profitable than in other<br />
S country. Our attitude to oil exploration is shown very clearly<br />
from our proposed legislation of the Petroleum and Minierals<br />
Authority, we believe that the proper way for a country to<br />
discover oil, one of the proven methods, of discovering oil in<br />
Sany country is for some gaokx governmental instrumentality in<br />
that country to take part in the search and the development and<br />
. that means that the govt of the country becomes k party to the<br />
information the the geoglogical formations and prospects, it<br />
Salso is able to share in the ownership of any deposits that<br />
are found as well as share, as well as share in the m knowledge<br />
which is gained. This is the method ta-t the French use its<br />
S the method : th4at the Italians its the method which the Canadians<br />
are now adopting and Brazil and there are a great number p of these<br />
countries have set up corporations of this character. Australia<br />
would<br />
S would I think,/ be the only country whexexthe the only industrialise<br />
country, or the only country where it is som sought where their<br />
are any indications of oil andxgHsx or natural gas that there<br />
is not a governmental instrumentality taking part in the search<br />
and the development of the oil and natural gas dsopx deposits. </p>
<p>The one that we have. been basing ourselves on for the last ten<br />
years in our thoughts has been any. In Italy the na inte<br />
nationale edro cabori and as in Italy and France, Canada to take<br />
the cases where we are. most familiar with the operations, it's<br />
not a Government monopoly.. The instrumentality as you know the<br />
he's<br />
bill sets out/ is authorised enter into consortia or arrangements<br />
of any kind for discovery and development and processing and<br />
. marketing with individuals or with companies and these companies<br />
can be overseas companies or Australian companies or with State<br />
Governments or with a combination of all of them. It's no secret<br />
about this because the bill has been twice passed by the House<br />
Sof Representatives and twice rejected by the Senate and it's one<br />
of the a six bills upon which the Governmr-General granted us<br />
a dissolution of both houses.<br />
QUESTION: Is there a possibility of a two-teered policy for<br />
prices and incomes?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That is a system which has been used in many other<br />
S countries. The price remains constant for the existing discoveries.<br />
The price is negotiable to new discoveries. That. is obviously.<br />
a method which one could consider in Australia. If you have an<br />
' instrumentality in the field such as petroleum and minerals<br />
authority, you have the n knowledge of what the costs are and<br />
S this is one of the reasons of oi^ d course why we want to get<br />
S into the tanker trade as well so that one's able to discover the<br />
cost of transporting. If Menzies hadn't sold out the Commonwealth<br />
0<br />
Oil Refineries, we would have been in a very much better position<br />
. in all these respects as to regards search, transport and<br />
refining and distribution.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, could I ask you your reaction to Mr Snedden's<br />
( unclear) indirect.. tax ( unclear)<br />
c I-</p>
<p>,6.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I've been asked the questions before on thit,-<br />
and I think I need only repeat the answers I've given previous l y.<br />
I see no reason why taxes direct,. or indirect, need to be<br />
increased in order to pay for any of our continuing commitments,<br />
the continuation of programs we've already introduced or for the<br />
introduction of programs for which we've already introduced<br />
legislation but which the Senate has rejected or for programs<br />
which I have undertaken in greater detail in my policy speech<br />
for this election. In particular I undertook two new commitments.<br />
One is to have a complete... to introduce a complete availability<br />
of care and education for children under 5 everywhere in Australia,<br />
city and country, new suburbs, old suburbs. That will cost an<br />
additional 130 million dollars in the coming financial year.<br />
It's mainly current expenditure. I'd emphasise it's not a<br />
capital intensive program at all. It's not like a program for<br />
schools or tertiary institutions. It's'a program based on people<br />
operating xx in existing community. facilities or in fact in their<br />
own homes or their own streets. The other proposal is to exempt<br />
the matrimonial home during the lifetime of the survivor of a<br />
marriage and the Treasury has worked that out as involving<br />
million a year. There was another proposal I made to exempt<br />
well to allow people to deduct from their for taxation purposes<br />
the amount when they paid for the support of dependants even if<br />
thos e dependants are not in Austalia. Treasury said there would<br />
be no cost to the revenue involved. Now I read Mr Snedden's<br />
statement yesterday and he makes no specific costings at all.<br />
The new programs that I've pronounced, I have just gone over now<br />
* and I have told you what the estimates of costs are. I put them<br />
in the policy speech. It's not necessary to increase direct or<br />
indirect taxes to pay for any of them. I issued costingcf those<br />
items which wel'cut and which Mr Snedden says that he would restore. </p>
<p>I didn't purport to go through the whole of his policy speech<br />
because it seemed to me it was deliberately... it was vague. Now<br />
. that was either because of her was deliberately vague or because<br />
She is constitutionally vague. But I did specify the cost of.<br />
those subsidies 9-concessions, loopholes and lurks which we<br />
had ended and which he said he'd restore.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, Mr Fraser says that all the<br />
Treasury predictions has to make, Government would have to<br />
Vc . K Government expenditure would have to rise by 5,000 million in<br />
74/ 75 to make way for its programs. . He goes on to say that.<br />
Mr Hayden told him that the Treasury estimates had been<br />
. publisheadn d believed that they had gone to Cabinet or a..<br />
Cabinet Committee. Is this true?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There has been no submission to Cabinet<br />
there has been no document prepared by Treasury. Mr Fraser<br />
baseds his allegations on a newsletter hyxsoma produced by<br />
' some body called Syntec. Mr Fraser has made several statements.<br />
I believe he is x the most prolific author of all the members of<br />
Sthe Opposition and most of them are based on Syntec. I think<br />
I heard him... Yes I did. I heard this and I saw this debate<br />
between Mr Fraser and Sir Charles Court and Mr Hayden and Mr.-<br />
Dunstan on Mike Willesee's show on Sunday and Mr Fraser mentioned<br />
Syntec as the basis of this allegation. Mr Hayden said that<br />
there have been no collation of departmental claims. That most<br />
of the claims are not in. I can verify that in my own Department<br />
claims, for instance in the Arts and so on are not in. It's<br />
the practice for departments to make all their claims b' the end<br />
of April. That's because a budget usually comes in in the middle<br />
of August. The claims have been deferred this year because as<br />
happened in 1951 k last time there was a double dissolution, the<br />
budget will not come in until B~ Ezam September. And accordingly,<br />
the claims will not even come in till the end of this month or even </p>
<p>into June and then the Cabinet will not be considering the<br />
various claims until late in July or even August. It depends<br />
when the first session of the Parliament take s place.<br />
. QUESTION: On behalf of Patrick Whiteman and myself, it's<br />
r got to do with your statement on public lending rights whether<br />
Sit's 50 cents a year or it's 50 cents per volume'. Is it an<br />
S. I annual or a lump sum?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'll have to find out.<br />
QUESTION: k( unclear)<br />
S PRIME MINISTER: I don't know. I think your volumes are selling<br />
very well. I do what I can to advertise them. I forget it<br />
S may be it's only for each volume that goes into a library<br />
and I would think that the run there is on your works that they<br />
wwo. u ld have to be replaced in more fequently than yearly.<br />
QUESTION: ( unclear)<br />
SPRIME MINISTER: Well that's becasuse they're bound in HongKong.<br />
I'm not aire if I'm right there but the authors get it but the<br />
only b publishers that get it are those who are Australians.<br />
Authors will get them even if they're even if they're overseas<br />
but Australian. Publishers that is the printer -' the publishers<br />
won't unless he's Australian. I think there's one other one isn't<br />
' there QUESTION: But it would have to be annually?<br />
:. PRIME MINISTER: I suppose so but that's only slow moving line.<br />
Laurie would be wise to ask it for each volume.<br />
': QUESTION: Mine will only be slow moving and I need it.<br />
'' PRIME MINISTER: Look give you a copy we can give you a<br />
copy of the report. I don't think there's enought copies to give<br />
S. all round. but there's no secret about it. You'll be in<br />
'. Canberra tomorrow and I'll show it to you.<br />
QUESTION: The other question you were quoted in the Sydney<br />
Telegraph on Monday I don't know where they got it from<br />
it was some interview but government expenditure is going to </p>
<p>increase by 20% next year rather than 50% by suggested by<br />
Mr Snedden. Can you give us details of that or verify it?<br />
RIME MINISTER: I stated this on Frost so it will come out<br />
I 4i.' tomorrow night and it would therefore be embargoed. until<br />
9 tomorrow night. I know you wouldn't have broken the embargo.<br />
J ., You were in the studio at the time but you must have seen it<br />
Si-in writing somewhere. I'm not suggesting that you/ ask a<br />
Squestion which hadn't been in print already which somebody<br />
S' .: else hadn't broken the embargo on but I was asked on the basis<br />
of Malcolm Fraser's quotation from Syntec. I think it was that<br />
things would go up 40% and I said that that had never been<br />
S suggested. There were no documents to that effect. And he said<br />
* where would it be. I said I think it would be somewhere midway.<br />
And that is purely a hunch. I point out that expenditure in<br />
S. the Government's sector in fact is rising more slowly than in<br />
the private sector. This is rot only in current expenditure<br />
'. but still more in capital expenditure. The latest statistics<br />
the statisticians latest bulletin shows I think -d I suppose.<br />
'.' you can look it up I'm going from memory that the increased<br />
capital expenditure by industries is respectively 40% whereas<br />
we have quite deliberately kept down capital expenditure except<br />
S. . where it would be cheaper than hiring private premises. But<br />
I did say on Frost that * k I thought it would be about 20 which<br />
is rather less than the estimates theprivate enterprise'is<br />
giving. QUESTION: Would that b 20% across the border, Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME'MINISTER: The average of the lot. It's obviously I would<br />
think expenditue on public housing this coming year wouldn't<br />
go up as much as the coming year wouldn't go up as much as the<br />
year just ending because it's been shown that the money can't<br />
be spent and there are many items which are continuing ones where </p>
<p>the expenditure would be less but I would expect that there<br />
would be some items in the cities field, urban and regional<br />
developmet which would be greater in the coming year than in<br />
the year just expired because the expenditure we allocated in<br />
last budget hasn't been all taken up by, the States. As you<br />
know in transport and land development alone there must be<br />
I'll have the figures precisely for tomorrow night at Bankstown<br />
but there must be over 40 million available for the New South<br />
4 ' Wales Government in Mr Crean's last budget which wasn't taken<br />
S up. Well we would be making it available in the next budget.<br />
Clearly the increase in expenditure would show up as a . considerable<br />
expenditure in the next budget but it wouldn't be such a large<br />
increase over the expenditure allowed for k in the last budget.<br />
QUESTION: I think Mr Fraser is basing his...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: On Syntec forward<br />
QUESTION: yest on what has been said about/ anHx estimates...<br />
' PRIME MIISTER: Well there aren't.... Forward estimates are not<br />
S yet in. They may be for some departments but Mr Fraser's been<br />
S a Minister. He knows that every departments puts in much more<br />
than it expects to get. The estimates. which we got from<br />
S departments last July were at least halved. And if we hadn't<br />
a lot<br />
been able to cut of these inherited lurks exposed by the Cooms<br />
TAsk Force, they would have t had to be cut further still.' Some<br />
of the Coombs Task Force recommendations will have their full<br />
, x impact in the new year. The superphosphate for instance will only'<br />
ibe half effective. It's meant no saving at all in 73/ 74. It will<br />
only make a half saving in 74/ 75 because the Act doesn't expire<br />
until;. the end of. December. 75/ 76 will be a complete saving.<br />
