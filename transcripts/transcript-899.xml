COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
' SPEECH : BY<br />
Rt. Hon. Sir ROBERT MENZIES, M. P.<br />
. ON<br />
ADDRESS-IN-REPLY TO THE<br />
GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH<br />
[ From the " Parliamentary Debates," 5th March, 1964.]<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES .( Kooyong-<br />
Prime Minister) am grateful to<br />
the House for giving , me 40 minutes. ' I<br />
hope I will notneed to employ it all. However,<br />
there are some things : that I would<br />
like . to say in the -course . of this debate on<br />
Im otion for the adoption. of the Addresseply<br />
to the . Governor* General's<br />
Speech. In particular, I want to refer to<br />
a few observations made by the Leader . of<br />
the Qpposition ( Mr. Calwell) and by some<br />
, f his supporters. I will come to them in<br />
. time.<br />
, Imust say,. if I. may do so without. giving<br />
offence,. that nothing. that the Leader of the<br />
Opposition said in this debate varied . from<br />
what he had said many times in the course<br />
of the election campaign. In other words,<br />
he gave us a'brief retrospective resume of<br />
his election speeches. The one thing ' that<br />
went . wrong : about them . was . that they did<br />
not succeed. : I understand the : position ! of<br />
the honorable gentleman; -I have been<br />
through these experiences myself. He has<br />
been through deep waters and shallow<br />
waters. Most of us who ' have had long<br />
service in politics ' have : had the experience<br />
of defeat and of victory. I was very<br />
interested to learn how the'honorable gentleman<br />
would -feel after two or three months<br />
of reflection. ' But there is no doubt about<br />
2057/ 64. him. I take off my hat to him. He does<br />
not bother to learn much from painful<br />
experiences. He came up with all the old<br />
cliches. He even permitted himself to say<br />
that I secured an election prematurely,<br />
which I did, in. a panic. This is a fascinating<br />
observation. ' He suggests that I was in a<br />
panic. -I suppose that is why I entered<br />
upon an election. This is quite a curious<br />
form of reasoning.<br />
Mr. Kelly.-Jt is a curious form of panic.<br />
, Sir &gt; ROBERT ' MENZIES.-I , thank . my<br />
friend for his observation. It ! is a curious<br />
form of panic. The suggestion . of . the<br />
Leader of theOpposition that I secured . the<br />
election prematurely in . a panic really,<br />
astonishes me. JI say this for the: record;<br />
it. is no. longer of very much public interest.<br />
The -honorable , gentleman had on three or<br />
four occasions challenged me to have an<br />
election. xUnless his performances on<br />
behalf of , the , Opposition were arrant<br />
humbug-that, of course, would be an<br />
unparliamentary . expression-he . must have<br />
thought that, the Government having a<br />
majority of one, he might defeat us in . a<br />
chance melee in. the House and produce an<br />
election. " I am bound to say that the only<br />
panic ever exhibited was. his when I finally<br />
accepted the invitation. That was when </p>
<p>the panic began. Of course, his present<br />
panic arises from the fact that the people<br />
supported us at the ' election.<br />
Up to the last week of the election campaign,<br />
the Leader of the Opposition had<br />
persuaded himself-he is not without talents<br />
in self-persuasion-that bhe would win.<br />
Indeed, he did what inexperienced fellows<br />
like me never do; he named the seats that<br />
he would win. Up to the last week of the<br />
campaign, we were pitiable objects. We<br />
had tumbled by sheer stupidity into an<br />
election. But in the last week we had the<br />
panic. Let honorable members recall it.<br />
The panic was in the last week. It was<br />
then that the Leader of the Opposition<br />
began to make the most astonishing series<br />
of extravagant and offensive allegations I<br />
have ever heard in a political campaign.<br />
I am not sure that he did not accuse me of<br />
obscenity-I have forgotten-but he certainly<br />
accused me of all the most remarkable<br />
things. This was at a time when I<br />
was saying to myself in the still watches of<br />
the night-if there are any still watches of<br />
the night for a politician or a prime<br />
minister-that my own boys were a little<br />
worried because I was, as an old colleague<br />
of ours used to say, rather too much of a<br />
little Lord Fauntleroy. In the last week it<br />
was really fabulous to be able to open the<br />
newspaper in the morning and read of the<br />
things that I had never said but which I<br />
was accused of saying..<br />
The honorable gentleman is responsible<br />
for his own tactics. He cannot blame us<br />
for those, unless he admits that in some way<br />
we applied pressure and forced him into<br />
these tactical errors. The honorable gentleman<br />
had begun his campaign with the most<br />
luscious collection of promises a week or<br />
eight days before I delivered my policy<br />
speech. He was going around the country<br />
talking about an Army group at Grafton,<br />
which was very important, and about the<br />
abolition of preferental voting. I must say<br />
that in almost 30 years in this Parliament I<br />
had never heard any member of the Australian<br />
Labour Party advocate the abolition<br />
of preferential voting, but, of course, I am<br />
open to correction. Will anybody correct<br />
me? No? In 30 years not a hint of this<br />
has ' been given but in the last week of the<br />
election campaign the honorable gentleman, being himself in a state of panic and<br />
apparently a little worried about the state<br />
of the parties in the electorates, said, " We<br />
will abolish preferential voting He did<br />
not say it in his policy speech, but he said<br />
it then. Happily his statement received<br />
wide publicity.<br />
All this time in the last week he was, if I<br />
may use the expression with the great conversatism<br />
so characteristic of me, screeching<br />
abuse about his opponents. Of course,<br />
when all this happened in the last week of<br />
the campaign, I, who had always believthat<br />
we would win, became completely coAiV<br />
fident of success, because these were the<br />
marks of panic and the marks of defeat.<br />
The honorable gentleman wants a little<br />
history and I am giving it to him. Thwe<br />
the gallup poll, that sacred thing, was pu<br />
lished on the Friday before the election.<br />
This revived his hopes, but they were<br />
dashed within 36 hours. By the following<br />
Monday he had revealed -himself-I say<br />
this to him as a old friend and an old<br />
political opponent-as the worst loser in the<br />
-history of Commonwealth politics. I am<br />
not engaging in a post mortem; I am engaging<br />
in a post vitam-a very different matter.<br />
I leave the post mortems to my opponents.<br />
ourI dop onliocty , r ealtlhye feeilm cmaleldedia teolny to orpeehreaatris2e?-.<br />
aspects of which are referred to in thed<br />
Governor-General's Speech, because the<br />
simple truth is that the people have<br />
approved of our policy and we are putting<br />
it into operation. Therefore, I will dej.<br />
very lightly with matters that have exerciso&gt; J<br />
the Opposition in this new session of Parliament.<br />
I will refer to just a few matters.<br />
I would need not 40 minutes but three<br />
hours to expose all the weaknesses in the<br />
Opposition's position so I will deal with<br />
just a few of them.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition spoke about<br />
Malaysia. That was a bold exercise on his<br />
part. I quote these words from his speechwe<br />
support the creation of Malaysia to<br />
the extent that it will promote the welfare of its<br />
people and the stability of South-East Asia and<br />
will strengthen the area-that is, our area-against<br />
Chinese aggression or Communist imperialism.<br />
Honorable members-at least those on this<br />
side of the House-will realize that that is<br />
a statement that we might have welcomed </p>
<p>very much at the time when Malaysia was<br />
under discussion. But the honorable gentleman<br />
then went on to say-<br />
But Indonesia's policy of confrontation cuts<br />
across those objectives and raises new and<br />
important issues. We need an anti-Communist<br />
Malaysia, but we also need an anti-Communist<br />
Indonesia. That was the end of the statement of<br />
policy. What does it mean? Does Indonesia's<br />
policy of confrontation cut across<br />
our support for Malaysia? We do not think<br />
so. When we made our statement in this<br />
', puse, we were not unaware of the Indo-<br />
,, sian tendency to confront, to threaten<br />
and to raise issues. Indonesia's policy of<br />
confrontation does not cut across our support<br />
for Malaysia.<br />
But the honorable gentleman, in effect,<br />
._ hts this question to himself: Does this cut<br />
across our support for Malaysia or does it<br />
strengthen our support for Malaysia? If<br />
the honorable gentleman was asking, " Does<br />
this policy of confrontation, which is being<br />
conducted by a country with which we all<br />
want to live in a state of peace and harmony<br />
and which is directed at a country<br />
which we are pledged to support and whose<br />
political integrity we are pledged to support,<br />
introduce new problems? he should have<br />
told us what those problems were. I<br />
1" Nonder how Malaysia-at this moment the<br />
whose borders forays and infiltrations are<br />
occurring-would regard these Australian<br />
Labour Party ambiguities. There is no<br />
ambiguity about our position. We have<br />
ated it; we have repeated it; we will<br />
d-' dhere to it.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition described<br />
my statement about Malaysia on behalf of<br />
this Government and on behalf of this<br />
country-a statement now completely<br />
reinforced by the electoral decision of the<br />
people-as vague and unsatisfactory. From<br />
the master of ambiguity, that is indeed a<br />
tremendous charge.<br />
When the honorable gentleman had said<br />
what he wanted to say on that matter, he<br />
took a side swipe at me-I believe that is<br />
the expression. I seem to be rather<br />
a disagreeable person, not enjoying as much<br />
favour with my opponents as I should. The<br />
honorable gentleman permitted himself, as<br />
he not infrequently does, to rewrite modem history. Let me occupy the time of the<br />
House for a few minutes on these matters.<br />
He said-<br />
When President Nasser nationalized the Suez<br />
Canal the Prime Minister, with his limited<br />
imagination-I admit that part; I have never had enough<br />
imagination to imagine what members of the<br />
Opposition would do about any mattertried<br />
to adjust the facts to fit his<br />
favourite formula. It was all a Communist plot<br />
as far as he was concerned.<br />
I did not know that such a question had<br />
ever been raised over the Suez Canal matter<br />
and my association with it. The Leader of<br />
the Opposition went on to say-<br />
Of course, he failed to get his view accepted<br />
because the United States itself saw the folly and<br />
danger of the course being pursued by the British<br />
Conservative Government.<br />
This is becoming the stock-in-trade of a<br />
number-I except some-of honorable<br />
gentlemen opposite: That I rushed in; that<br />
I was wrong; that in some mysterious<br />
fashion I persuaded eighteen large nations<br />
and small nations to agree with me-in an<br />
aside sort of way, rather a compliment. I<br />
was the actor in the drama.<br />
The honorable gentleman knows, or<br />
ought to know if he reads anything other<br />
than propaganda, that when President<br />
Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal I was<br />
on my way back to Austraila and that when<br />
I was in the United States I was told about<br />
it and was told that a conference of 22<br />
nations was to be convened at once in<br />
London. I telephoned my Acting Prime<br />
Minister in Australia and said: " What do<br />
you think? Perhaps I ought to go back,"<br />
because we in Australia have a lively interest<br />
in the Suez Canal and its future. I was<br />
told, " Yes, you ought to go back". I<br />
went to the conference. I do not need to<br />
elaborate this matter. All I can tell you,<br />
Mr. Speaker, is that after two or three days<br />
in that conference a scheme of proposals<br />
was produced and those proposals were put<br />
up to President Nasser. They were drafted<br />
by Mr. John Foster Dulles, the Secretary<br />
of State of the United States. They were<br />
American proposals. I thought they were<br />
very good ones, and so did the representatives<br />
of seventeen other nations. A resolution<br />
was carried that those proposalseminently<br />
reasonable, sensible and fair proposals-<br />
should be presented to President </p>
<p>Nasser, although not with very much hope<br />
of their being, accepted. But intrinsically<br />
they were pretty good.<br />
One night I was telephoned at my hotel<br />
just as I was about to come back to Australia,<br />
and I was invited to go up to the<br />
American Embassy. This is very interesting,<br />
having regard to this falsification of<br />
history. I arrived at the embassy at about<br />
2 o'clock in the morning, and there people<br />
were discussing this business. There had<br />
been a proposal that a committee should be<br />
appointed to present and explain these resolutions<br />
to President Nasser. There and then<br />
these people who, according to the Leader<br />
of the Opposition, regarded me with complete<br />
contempt, urged me to become chairman<br />
of the committee and to go to Cairo<br />
to put these matters to President Nasser.<br />
I did not want to go. I had been a long<br />
way from home for a long time. I had<br />
problems to attend to in Australia. But<br />
when. the Prime Minister of Australia is<br />
invited by representatives of eighteen<br />
nations, including the major nations in the<br />
non-Communist world, to do a job, however<br />
difficult and hopeless it may seem, I<br />
-do not believe it is any part of his responsibilities<br />
-to say, " No, thank you; I would<br />
sooner go home So I went and' put the<br />
-case and, of course, we did not succeed.<br />
I am free to admit that I did not ever think<br />
we would succeed; but we argued our case.<br />
I was the spokesman. Having received<br />
what I. rather thought was something in the<br />
nature of a compliment from eighteen<br />
nations, I returned home to, find that the<br />
-Labour Party in Australia regarded : this as<br />
a ridiculous exercise. Very well. Time<br />
does not . permit me to re-write history for<br />
the Leader of -the -Opposition, but if he<br />
wants to know whether I look back on that<br />
painful and. difficult exercise with. shame I<br />
say at once that I do not; I look back on it<br />
with. a certain amount of self-respect.<br />
Having fired a few shots on that matter<br />
-not for the ' first time; and indeed this<br />
ist. h e first time I have -ever bothered about<br />
them-the honorable gentleman went to<br />
1960. He has never got over 1960.<br />
Neither have I. It was the only time . I<br />
ever went to the General Assembly of the<br />
United Nations. A number of honorable<br />
members have been there, and I went there<br />
in October,. 1960. I had some discussions and moved an amendment to a, resolution.<br />
The amendment was-defeated. My. speech<br />
was never reported in. this country. Other<br />
speeches were. The honorable gentleman,<br />
who prefers second-hand sources of<br />
information, said the other night-<br />
In 1960 President Eisenhower and Mr.<br />
Macmillan, being shrewd judges of men, saw that<br />
the Prime Ministerthat<br />
is mewould<br />
risk almost anything for the sake of an<br />
hour or two of international limelight.<br />
This is it. What the honorable gentleman<br />
does not know-if he does know it, he<br />
suppressed it-is that at that meeting ) 1<br />
the United Nations a motion was submitted<br />
by some nations the effect of which was<br />
for President Eisenhower to have a conference<br />
with Chairman Khrushchev-not with<br />
the United Kingdom and not with Fran",<br />
a sort of half-summit meeting. What t.-<br />
honorable gentleman has forgotten is that<br />
President Eisenhower had already made it<br />
clear that he would not have a bi-lateral<br />
talk. Honorable members will remember,<br />
I hope, that in that year everything was<br />
lined up for a summit conference in Paris,<br />
, and then the incident of the U2 occurred<br />
and the summit conference was abandoned.<br />
I do not know whether the U2 incident was<br />
-the sole cause of the collapse of . the summit<br />
meeting or whether there was some other<br />
, cause. The people concerned in the sumr<br />
conference and therefore in the peace<br />
: the world--our . peace-were the Soviet<br />
Union, Great Britain, the United States of<br />
-America and France: At this meeting of<br />
* the United N'ations it was moved, seconded<br />
and went on. the record that there sho:<br />
be a conference between . the two, one-o1<br />
whom-President Eisenhower-had already<br />
, made -clear that he would not have a bilateral<br />
conference. Therefore it seemed to<br />
me--and I hope honorable members will<br />
not . think this ' is stupid-that to carry a<br />
resolution that there ' be a meeting between<br />
the two when. at least one of them had said<br />
he would not attend was rather -beating the<br />
air. So far from me homing in on this matter,<br />
which is : the legend on the part of the<br />
Opposition and -its academic advisers, I was<br />
invited by President Eisenhower-I do not<br />
boast about this--to come to Washington<br />
to discuss this matter. He also invited Mr.<br />
Macmillan to go to Washington to discuss </p>
<p>the matter. I went. Dean Rusk was there<br />
as well as various other people connected<br />
with the American Administration. We<br />
had a discussion about this matter at the<br />
White House later in the afternoon. I had<br />
suggested that it would not be a bad thing,<br />
instead of having a blank negative, to have<br />
an amendment moved which called on all<br />
four parties to have a summit conference,<br />
' to get back to the one thing that represented<br />
some hope for the world. These<br />
gentlemen whom I am supposed to have<br />
og-rolled in some way are not insignificant<br />
9_ eople. When I put my submission they<br />
said, " This has great merit They asked<br />
me to draft an amendment. I drafted an<br />
amendment. We discussed it that afternoon<br />
and I submitted it at the United<br />
ations. I am happy to say that although<br />
. he amendment was defeated, to the intense<br />
joy of Her Majesty's Opposition in Australia,<br />
it was supported by Great Britain,<br />
the United States, the Republic of France,<br />
Australia and Canada. The Soviet Union<br />
did not vote against the amendment; it<br />
abstained. Was that an unhappy event?<br />
I must tell honorable members opposite<br />
what. was in my amendment because they<br />
are badly in need. of instruction on this<br />
matter. I wonder whether anybody on the<br />
other side of the House will disagree with<br />
-x single' word of this amendment,. putting<br />
l; flim-flam, of a-political kind on one side.<br />
* My amendment recalled that there had been<br />
an arrangement for a meeting, ' that the<br />
meeting. did not begin its work and.. that the<br />
President of -the United States, -the President<br />
f the French Republic and the Prime<br />
-/ Minister of the United Kingdom, had made<br />
; public statements, saying that they would<br />
welcome such a meeting in order to reduce<br />
world . tension. -I went on-<br />
* Believing that much. benefit'for the world'could<br />
arise from a cooperative ' meeting of the ' Heads<br />
of government of these, four nations in relation<br />
to those problems which ' particularly concern<br />
them, Is this disagreeable -to the Opposition? The<br />
amendment -continued-<br />
Believing further that progress, towards the solution<br />
of those problems would be a material contribution<br />
to the general work for peace of the United<br />
Nations, Urges that such a meeting should occur at the<br />
earliest practicable date.<br />
I have heard Labour members,.. former<br />
Labour ' Ministers and. Labour -candidates time after time stand on platforms and say<br />
, that those are-their views. But when a<br />
Prime Minister drawn from a party other<br />
than their own expressed those views, and,<br />
if I" may say so, with some vigour, and<br />
secured the support of the great powers<br />
which, alone, if they act in concert, can<br />
reduce tension in the world, the result is<br />
the kind of jibe-the kind of sneering<br />
remark-that we have heard on this<br />
occasion. Sir, I will not occupy any more time on<br />
that matter. I do not want to re-write<br />
history for my opponent. I am too busy<br />
for that. So I will go on to a few contemporary<br />
issues-very few. In the course<br />
of his speech he once more returned to<br />
King Charles' head-the TFX bomber.<br />
The honorable gentleman became frightfully<br />
mixed up about this during the election<br />
campaign. At one stage I thought that<br />
he would repudiate the contract to buy the<br />
TFX. I am not sure that was not his<br />
intention. At another stage he said to the<br />
electors, Elect us to office and we will buy<br />
a replacement for the Canberra", as if you<br />
could buy it in a pawnshop. There was no<br />
appreciation of the fact that if you are to<br />
replace a magnificent vehicle like the<br />
Canberra bomber, which only the other day<br />
was the last word, then you must ensure<br />
that you will get . the latest word and, if<br />
possible, something which will be operative<br />
and effective for a reasonable time to come.<br />
The whole case about the TFX was<br />
stated. But, of course, there are people in<br />
various countries who do. not like orders<br />
being placed for aircraft other than their<br />
own, so the other day some scribbler wrote<br />
an article-my distinguished friend the<br />
Minister for Air ( Mr. Fairbairn) who knows<br />
about these things referred to it in the<br />
course of his speech yesterday-in which he<br />
said, " The TFX is. encountering enormous<br />
diffictilties My distinguished' opponent,<br />
always willing to snatch at even the slightest<br />
straw in. the torrent, said: " There you are.<br />
You woh't get the TFX until 1970." In<br />
' fact, nothing is known either from the<br />
United States, which has a vast interest in<br />
the . performance of this aircraft, or from<br />
the . people who are building the aircraft,<br />
that lends the slightest colour to these<br />
, arguments. I do -wish that the honorable<br />
: gentleman would not continue repeating<br />
, false figures. The . position is ' that the<br />
American Government has undertaken to </p>
<p>deliver the TFX order beginning in 1967.<br />
The Australian Government has accepted<br />
this estimate. We believe it is a sincere<br />
estimate, and nothing has occurred to cause<br />
the American Government to indicate that<br />
it will not be able to meet the delivery<br />
dates. Therefore, to use the old Australian<br />
phrase, this is another furphy. I say that,<br />
with great regard to the honorable member<br />
whose electorate includes Shepparton.<br />
I should like to refer to two other<br />
matters. I seem to remember that during<br />
the election campaign and during last year<br />
-I am open to be corrected-the Opposition<br />
devoted a great deal of its forensic<br />
talent to explaining that we were ruining<br />
the economy, that we were introducing a<br />
period of massive unemployment. Indeed,<br />
a little before then the Opposition was explaining,<br />
in the most learned fashionbecause<br />
I am sure its adviser was in a<br />
technical sense a learned man-that the<br />
loan market had been ruined. We were<br />
told what the Labour Party would do to<br />
restore it. Unfortunately for the Labour<br />
Party, this is all in the past now. The<br />
economy has not been ruined; on the contrary.<br />
The loan,' market has not been<br />
ruined; on the contrary, it is almost ' embarrassingly<br />
lush and fruitful. So what does the<br />
Opposition do? My friends on the other<br />
side of the House-I do not blame themday<br />
after day have been asking, " Will the<br />
Minister for Labour and National Service,<br />
through his counsel before the arbitration<br />
commission, tell the commission how<br />
tremendously prosperous this country is,<br />
how lush the loan market is, how marvellous<br />
is the state of the economy, how much<br />
productivity has increased? Having been<br />
through this kind of thing for some time<br />
I cannot find it in my heart to blame<br />
honorable members opposite. I suppose<br />
you try one thing and if it does not succeed<br />
you try another. If the solution turns out<br />
ultimately to be the opposite of the one<br />
you tried first, well, you know, life is full<br />
of mutations, so one can understand and<br />
forgive..-I shall refer to one other matter because<br />
I see that my time, so generously extended,<br />
is running out. During the last four sitting<br />
days I have been fascinated to discover an<br />
almost concerted plan by Opposition members,<br />
egged on a little, if I may say so to<br />
my old friend, by a speech from this side of the House, to talk about gerrymandering<br />
the electorate. " Gerrymander" is a<br />
beautiful word. It hails from America and<br />
it has a resonance in it. It is intelligible<br />
in English, so it is used. The Opposition<br />
claims that what we propose to do about<br />
the Commonwealth Electoral Act represents<br />
a gerrymander. I would have ignored<br />
this had it been just a passing exercise on<br />
the part of one honorable member but I<br />
suppose about ten honorable members<br />
opposite have claimed that we are proposing<br />
to gerrymander the electorate. Fortunately<br />
for us, and fortunately for Austral. Y<br />
most of them have explained what they)<br />
mean by the word. As I understand it-<br />
I speak subject to correction, because I am<br />
always willing to be corrected-they mean<br />
one vote, one value. They claim that tb~ -F<br />
must be no discrimination between a larn1,<br />
widespread rural electorate like Kalgoorlie<br />
or a compact metropolitan electorate like<br />
my own. There must be no discrimination<br />
because the moment you depart from the<br />
principle of one vote, one value, this is<br />
a gerrymander. I know that my friend<br />
the honorable member for Leichhardt ( Mr.<br />
Fulton) treats the statements of his colleagues<br />
with a certain amount of congenial<br />
contempt, but this apparently is the new<br />
Labour doctrine. The Labour Party has<br />
been in office in the Commonwealth for.<br />
seventeen years altogether, perhaps n,<br />
long enough from its own point of view.-<br />
The Electoral Act of the Commonwealth<br />
of Australia first became law 62 years ago<br />
in 1902--62 years ago! I was so cut to<br />
the quick by all this talk about gerrymandering<br />
that I put myself to a little troub;<br />
and said to my officer, Bring me the 1961<br />
Commonwealth Electoral Act Here it<br />
is. It is 62 years old, give or take a month<br />
or two. Section 16 of the act states-<br />
In making any distribution of States into Divisions<br />
the Commissioner-<br />
There was one commissioner in those daysshall<br />
give due consideration to--<br />
Community or diversity of interest,<br />
Means of communication,<br />
Physical features,<br />
Existing boundaries of Divisions;<br />
and subject thereto-<br />
I hope honorable members opposite will hold<br />
their breath so that they will not die of<br />
shock nowthe<br />
qluota of electors shall be the basis for the<br />
distribution, and the Commissioner may adopt a </p>
<p>margin of allowance, to be used whenever necessary,<br />
but in no case shall such quota be departed<br />
from to a greater extent than one-fifth more or<br />
one-fifth less.<br />
That was t-he position in 1902 and for many<br />
years thereafter. The current legislation is<br />
almost indistinguishable from the original<br />
except that the number of the section is<br />
different. It is now section 19, which is in<br />
these terms-<br />
In making any proposed distribution of a State<br />
into Divisions the distribution Commissioners-<br />
The plural, Commissioners is used now.<br />
ope that is not fatal-<br />
'-dall give due consideration to-<br />
Community or diversity of interest,<br />
Means of. communication,<br />
Physical features,<br />
Existing boundaries of Divisions and<br />
S Subdivisions,<br />
State Electoral boundaries;<br />
fhen follows the provisions about a tolerance<br />
of one-fifth up or one-fifth down. So,<br />
if honorable members will trouble themselves<br />
to read what appears in the policy<br />
speech on this matter, and what appears in<br />
the Governor-General's Speech, they will<br />
discover one or two points. I attach great<br />
importance to one of them and that is the<br />
trend of population in various areas. This<br />
was mentioned even by some honorable<br />
members opposite to-day.' These are important factors. We modernize them. There<br />
is no compulsion to make a quota difference,<br />
but there is the same permissive authority<br />
to the commissioners to go up or down by<br />
one-fifth. Yet I have lived long enoughtoo<br />
long, some may think-to find that what<br />
has been completely accepted in this Commonwealth,<br />
what has produced, by and<br />
large, sensible, honest recommendations,<br />
what has been left untouched and untouchable<br />
by every Labour government that has<br />
sat in the Commonwealth Parliament, is<br />
now to be described by honorable members<br />
opposite as a gerrymander. All I can say<br />
is that it is ludicrous; it is out of proportion;<br />
it is unreal. But I welcome it, if I may<br />
say so, because it shows after their defeat<br />
and after the failure of their ambitions, how<br />
barren members of the Opposition have<br />
become. This is all that they can find to<br />
come up with-an allegation which has<br />
only to be examined by a boy reading acts<br />
of Parliament to be exposed as utter<br />
humbug. Mr. Cyde Cameron.-Wind up. Your<br />
time is up.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-I have wound<br />
up. I thought it was a very good ending,<br />
and I hope you will remember, it.<br />
