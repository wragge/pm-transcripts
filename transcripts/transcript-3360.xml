GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
The Australian Government has approved the first grants<br />
ever to be made toleduce inequalities between local government<br />
areas throughout Australia. For the first time since its<br />
creation in 1933, the Grants Commission has reconmended grants<br />
for local government areas.<br />
The Government, which last year empowered the Commission<br />
to recommend aid for local government areas in addition to<br />
claimant States, has a} proved the body's proposals.<br />
It will grant a total of $ 56,345,000 to local government<br />
organisations throughout Australia in 1974/ 75.<br />
The allocations for Councils in each State are:<br />
New South Wales:<br />
Victoria: Queensland: South Australia:<br />
Western Australia:<br />
Tasmania: $ 21,359,000<br />
$ 14,630,000<br />
$ 8,954,000<br />
$ 4,774,000<br />
$ 4,959,000<br />
$ 1,669,000<br />
The grants will be paid to Councils through State Governments.<br />
The Australian Government has accepted the Commission's<br />
reconendation that no conditions be attached to the way in<br />
which local government bodies spend their allocations in 1974/ 75.<br />
The acceptance of the proposals of the Commission, an independent<br />
and non-political body, reprzecnts one of the most important<br />
advances in the history of Australian local government. This<br />
major breakthrough results fromi legislation introduced by the<br />
Government last year to expand the Commission's functions. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The Commission w; c. st,.! bishe-, d in 17133 to to provide<br />
recommendations for special grants to be paid to claimant<br />
States under Section 96 of the Constitution.<br />
At various times in the past 41 years these States have<br />
included Queensland, South Australia, Western Auctralia and<br />
Tasmania. The basis of making such grants has been the recognition<br />
that at various times some State! 7 have been le-ss advantaged<br />
than others, both in terms of finance and services.<br />
The Commission has served the purpose of helping to<br />
reduce such inequalities between States.<br />
The Grants Commission Act 1973 empowered the Commission<br />
to examine not just inequalities betwc~ en States but also the<br />
inequalities that exist between rcgi ons in the one State.<br />
This recognises that while a single State may be in a<br />
strong financial position overall, some areas within it may lack<br />
adequate services and facilities.<br />
Local Councils in such areas may not have the financial<br />
resources to overcome those deficiencies and even the relevant<br />
State Government may not be able to provide adequate assistance.<br />
It has become quite obvious that if the disabilities<br />
of some areas of Australia are to be overcome the national<br />
Government must provide special grants.<br />
That is the principle whi hh has guided the Grants<br />
Commission and the Government in their deliberations.<br />
National Government assistance for Councils is long<br />
overdue in Australia. Neither the Australiannor State Governments<br />
in the past have been prepared to provide adequate assistance<br />
to enable local government to provide the many essential services<br />
which the community now demands of it.<br />
Local Government has indeed been neglected and downgraded<br />
since the very beginnings of our federation.<br />
The extension of the Grants Commission's powers and<br />
the Government's acceptance of its recommendations will mean<br />
that local government, for the first time, will be given the<br />
kind of assistance that it so desperately needs.<br />
