Video presentation<br />
RALPH: That was the video which we used to introduce our<br />
presentation. We had more than two stars. We had two<br />
particular stars who did a great job for us today. The<br />
two girls in their gold blazers, Cathy Freeman and<br />
Michelle Ford. The other three speakers were the Prime<br />
Minister and I'll say something about him in a moment<br />
and Kevan Gosper and myself. Among the members we havehere<br />
with us at the table, the Lord Mayor Richard Wynne,<br />
Prime Minister, the Premier Joan Kirner, Lord Mayor of<br />
Brisbane Sally-Ann Atkinson, John Landy and Max Roger who<br />
did a great job in answering the only question we got.<br />
The Prime Minister was the star in terms of the<br />
presentation he made and in the direct communication just<br />
before the presentation itself with Melbourne. I'm going<br />
to ask the Prime Minister now to just briefly outline<br />
some of things he said and the messages that we received<br />
of Melbourne.<br />
PM: I was able to say to the members of the Committee<br />
that no city was better equipped to stage the Games than<br />
Melbourne and that no bid would have the greatest support<br />
and degree of support that we had, not only in Melbourne<br />
but the nation as a whole. I pointed out that at all<br />
levels of government and across all parties there was a<br />
unanimity of support. I referred with pleasure to the<br />
fact that my political opponent, but on this issue my<br />
ally, John Hewson, was there as was at the State level<br />
Alan Brown with the Premier of Victoria, Joan Kirner.<br />
And in those circumstances we were able to present a<br />
picture of total unanimity. The financial guarantees had<br />
come from the State Government and they were backed by<br />
US. I was particularly able to make the point which I<br />
think was unique for Australia when I said that I believe<br />
that Australia was the living embodiment of the Olympic<br />
ideal in that this nation, Australia, had thrown open its<br />
doors to the people from 140 nations around the world<br />
without discrimination in terms of colour, creed or race.<br />
And that each day we were the living embodiment of the<br />
Olympic ideal in that we had the people of all these<br />
different nations, creeds and colours, living and </p>
<p>co-operating peacefully together. And that that gave us<br />
the basis upon which we were able to make the promise to<br />
the International Olympic Committee that if they<br />
entrusted us with the honour and the responsibility of<br />
conducting a Centenary Games that we would deliver an<br />
Olympic Games that would never be forgotten. We were<br />
assisted in that message, as I say, by being able to<br />
refer to the fact that there in Melbourne at this time<br />
were gathered thousands of our fellow Melbournians there<br />
in the National Tennis Centre expressing their support.<br />
May I just say, as I said out there a while ago, I've had<br />
many moments of pride as Prime Minister of this country<br />
but I don't think there's ever been anything which has<br />
quite matched the pride, John, which I felt in you and<br />
all the team, which did not only Melbourne, but you did<br />
Australia proud. Have a look at the video now, from<br />
Melbourne, which came directly by satellite just before.<br />
Video presentation<br />
RALPH: The Prime Minister just said to me the best is<br />
still to come and you'll see that at the end. That was<br />
filmed just a little while ago before we went in to make<br />
the presentation. The people probably are finding their<br />
way home now from the Tennis Centre in Melbourne.<br />
Mr Hawke was in the garden just outside the hotel here<br />
filming that and then the whole thing was sent by<br />
satellite. So we were able to demonstrate just the<br />
standard of the media presentation and what can be done<br />
in Melbourne. I think it was an excellent performance.<br />
Now I'd like to invite the Premier, if she would like to<br />
comment on the presentation.<br />
KIRNER: Thank you John. May I start off by saying<br />
congratulations to the team and particularly to you John<br />
from Victorians. It was a great effort. Fantastic<br />
performance. You haven't seen all of it yet but the<br />
spirit of the people of Melbourne in that fantastic<br />
Tennis Centre actually permeated the whole of the room<br />
where we made our presentation. That centre is an<br />
example of the many excellent facilities in Melbourne<br />
that John and the Prime Minister said were ready and<br />
waiting to stage the 1996 Olympic Games. Those<br />
facilities are a tribute to people like our former<br />
Premier John Cain. Thank you John. People like him and<br />
our commissioners and their partners who've done so much<br />
to make this bid a great success. I think the hallmark<br />
of our bid was that it has really drawn active<br />
participation from the whole community our athletes,<br />
our unions, business, the opposition, three tiers of<br />
government and millions of people across the country, and<br />
our schoolchildren. Weren't they terrific in the<br />
program. All working together. All committed to a<br />
victory for Melbourne. And you know, I think it might<br />
just be possible. That sort of co-operation, that sort<br />
of commitment has been here this week in Tokyo and in the<br />
months leading up to it. If that sense of purpose and<br />
teamwork which I'm proud to have been part of, which I </p>
<p>believe will enable us to stage a great Olympic Games.<br />
As Kevan Gosper said in a magnificent speech to the<br />
gathering, we are ready and we are waiting. This week<br />
has been tremendously exciting. The presentation was<br />
exciting. Cathy and Michelle had the spirit of Australia<br />
just oozing out of them. When Cathy forgot her lines she<br />
said ' And I want my mum and dad come and see me run'.<br />
Wonderful. FREEMAN: And they will.<br />
KIRNER: And they will. In Melbourne. In 1996. It<br />
created a great spirit that I believe will carry our<br />
state and our country forward. This is a great day for<br />
Victoria and for Melbourne and for Australia. Thank you<br />
team.<br />
RALPH: I now invite the Lord Mayor Richard Wynne to say<br />
a few words.<br />
WYNNE: Thank you very much John. It's a fantastic day<br />
for me to be Lord Mayor of Melbourne and I'm so proud<br />
that it was our city, that fine city of Melbourne, which<br />
initiated this bid for the 1996 Olympic Games. I'd<br />
particularly like to single out my two predecessors as<br />
Lord Mayor, Councillor Winsome McCaughey and Councillor<br />
Bill Deveney who are here tonight, who have worked so<br />
tirelessly on behalf of the city for our bid. Over the<br />
last 20 months Melbourne has gained the confidence to<br />
project itself as a truly international city. We're a<br />
city of style, we're a city that has competed superbly<br />
and our bid today I think has been absolutely first<br />
class. And it's because I believe that many IOC members<br />
have felt a great affection and some have great<br />
confidence in Melbourne, its people and its potential as<br />
a great city to host the 1996 Olympic Games. Our city<br />
has grown with this bid and has gained great impetus to<br />
improve itself over the coming years. I also believe we<br />
can look forward tonight with great expectations. To our<br />
colleagues and friends at the Town Hall and to the<br />
thousands who are gathering tonight in our city square,<br />
thank you, thank you sincerely for carrying the torch for<br />
Melbourne. The support of those wonderful people of<br />
Melbourne has been absolutely fantastic and without that<br />
the strength, and that has truly been the strength, of<br />
our bid. But it's been fantastic. Thank you very much.<br />
RALPH: Michelle would you like to just tell them what<br />
you told the people inside, but in English this time.<br />
FORD: Would you like it in English this time. Firstly<br />
I'd like to say that I was very proud to be selected on<br />
this team and to represent Australia, and not only<br />
Australia but all my colleague athletes who have done<br />
just as well as I have. I really feel an honour. I also<br />
tried to tell the IOC members, if they could understand<br />
my French, that the Games is for the athletes and it's<br />
the athletes spirit and the emotion of the athletes that </p>
<p>carry the Games and the spirit of the Games and the<br />
feeling of the Games. This is what gives you a great<br />
Games. I believe, as do we all here, and I'm sure we<br />
will show it to you, that Melbourne will show you this<br />
great Games.<br />
RALPH: Now Cathy, you can just tell them how much you're<br />
looking forward to competing, not only in Barcelona but<br />
also in Melbourne.<br />
FREEMAN: Well as far as I'm concerned, I think I'm happy<br />
as long as I'm at the Olympics. But it will be extremely<br />
special to have it in Australia, in Melbourne. I've<br />
learnt so much. I've learnt so much. It's incredible.<br />
I'm proud. I'm so honoured to be here. I've learnt so<br />
much in the way that we've all been working as a team and<br />
we've become closer friends. We've stuck in there and<br />
really grown close together. I think that's the<br />
important thing. I don't care. I think Melbourne's won.<br />
I don't care.<br />
RALPH: Just before inviting questions, there are two<br />
points I'd just like to make. Firstly as has already<br />
been mentioned, Kevan Gosper made a direct appeal in a<br />
very effective and very nice way to his colleagues on the<br />
IOC that half the world should not be living in shadow<br />
and it was time to come to the Southern Hemisphere. He<br />
did quite a remarkable job. The Prime Minister made, as<br />
you would expect, an excellent address and carried, set<br />
the tone for that video that you've already seen. Also I<br />
should refer to our two musicians who were a star act<br />
We'll take questions and then we'll show you just that<br />
last clip that brought the whole thing to a climax, which<br />
runs for about three minutes. Questions please, and I'll<br />
share them with my colleagues.<br />
JOURNALIST: What sort of response did you get when you<br />
were in there? Did you feel that there was the sort of<br />
warmth that you were giving to them?<br />
RALPH: I think the response inside from where we were<br />
sitting, it was just fantastic. I think you could feel<br />
that the whole mood was becoming more positive as the<br />
presentation went along. I felt that it was very good.<br />
We had a lot of people come up to us after to tell us<br />
that they thought it was an excellent presentation.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did the IOC ask you any questions about your<br />
bid and can you tell us what things they wanted to know<br />
more about?<br />
RALPH: We only had one question and that was in two<br />
parts I guess, from one questioner. That was to help his<br />
colleagues who hadn't been there because he had what were<br />
the arrangements in relation to accommodation and the<br />
charges that were involved. We explained our support<br />
package where for the first one hundred members of any<br />
team for US$ 350 they will be provided with travel and </p>
<p>accommodation. The second was to ask for a bit more<br />
detail on the other venues and Max Roger gave a rundown<br />
on those to be built and on the ones that are already in<br />
existence. That was the only question we had.<br />
JOURNALIST: You sound very confident. I mean do you<br />
think you've swayed any votes in there?<br />
RALPH: I don't think we went backwards.<br />
JOURNALIST: I wonder if you can explain if there's any<br />
significance in the presentation in the salutation to our<br />
Olympians for the absence of Dawn Fraser, our greatest<br />
Olympian? And can you reassure us that her absence had<br />
nothing to do with the pending of sensibilities of the<br />
IOC.<br />
ROGER: I can do that. Dawn Fraser was to be involved.<br />
In fact, she was one of the first to be involved and one<br />
of the first to accept but unfortunately at the last<br />
minutes some other commitments intervened. She couldn't<br />
get to rehearsals and so she thought rather than run any<br />
risk of a less than top performance she'd better not do<br />
it. But she was very strongly with us in spirit.<br />
JOURNALIST: Your bid like a few others has been based to<br />
some extent, if not a great extent, on emotional factors.<br />
We are in a technological age. How important do you<br />
think it is, or does the Melbourne Committee think it is,<br />
that the decision should be more on technical aspects of<br />
a city's capacity to stage an effective Games than on<br />
reasonable but emotional issues?<br />
RALPH: David I think that what we have done in the bid<br />
document was to lay that out in great detail. I think<br />
that it's probably fair to say that we went to much<br />
greater level of detail in all of the work that we did in<br />
preparing our bid. our planning is well advanced to the<br />
extent that we have gone past just conceptual design of<br />
facilities that have to be built into detailed drawings<br />
in order to be able to come up with a budget in which we<br />
could have complete confidence. We've had the<br />
opportunity of showing nearly 70 of the members who are<br />
in that room the facilities. They've been to Melbourne,<br />
they've seen them, they've had it explained to them,<br />
they've asked questions, so that they've got, those<br />
people who have been to Melbourne, have received all of<br />
that detail previously. Those that haven't been have<br />
been visited by our commissioners on at least two<br />
occasions each and they've had the opportunity to ask<br />
questions, they've had all the detail explained to them.<br />
I don't think that before that we went into that room<br />
there was very much need to explain the facts except we<br />
wanted to cover those and that was drawn up out of those<br />
shots in the early part of the video. I believe that our<br />
bid was already, we had already, been given quite a lot<br />
of commendation on the standard of the bid itself. We<br />
had given all of that technical detail. The second </p>
<p>6.<br />
volume of the bid document has it laid out and every<br />
member has a copy of that. This presentation we didn't<br />
believe that we had to repeat that but we did in the<br />
speeches which you haven't heard, we gave quite a few<br />
facts in terms of our planning for security, our<br />
financial planning, about the state of the art in<br />
communications We gave a number of facts because we<br />
haven't repeated the speeches here. You've only seen the<br />
video section.<br />
ROGERS: Because some of Australia's venues are not<br />
necessarily as well known we had brought 20 plus of the<br />
sports federations to Australia in the past 18 months.<br />
We have worked very closely with them and once again here<br />
and I believe we had a completely clean bill of health in<br />
respect of each of the international sports federations.<br />
RALPH: Thank you Max. Now what we will do is we will<br />
show you the final video in which we wound up our<br />
presentation.<br />
Video presentation<br />
ATKINSON: Can I have a microphone. Just before we all<br />
go. I'm speaking, I guess, on behalf of the rest of<br />
Australia. The cities like Brisbane and Sydney and<br />
Adelaide and Perth who all backed Melbourne and I just<br />
want you to know, John, Prime Minister, Cathy of course<br />
who comes from Queensland, and everybody else who was<br />
part of the team, that I felt very proud to be part of<br />
Australia. And I know back home everybody else is going<br />
to think Melbourne is fantastic and we are all looking<br />
forward to going to the Games there in ' 96.<br />
