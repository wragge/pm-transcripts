PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 14 AUGUST 1989<br />
I am pleased to announce that the Prime Minister of<br />
France, Mr Michel Rocard, has accepted my invitation to<br />
visit Australia as a guest of my government on<br />
18-19 August. This will be the first visit to Australia<br />
by a serving French Prime Minister.<br />
On 18 August, we will meet to discuss Antarctica, the<br />
environment, the South Pacific, my regional economic<br />
initiative and other topics of mutual interest. We<br />
expect to make further progress on the issues which we<br />
discussed during my visit to Paris in June.<br />
Mr Rocard and I will also hold round table discussions<br />
with senior ministers from both Australia and France.<br />
In Mr Rocard's party will be Mr Le Pensec, the Minister<br />
for Overseas Departments and Territories, and Mrs Avice,<br />
the Minister Delegate for Foreign Affairs. As part of<br />
their program, the accompanying ministers will also meet<br />
the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and<br />
Trade. During Mr Rocard' s visit, we will also seek to enhance<br />
scientific and technological co-operation between our<br />
two countries and Mr Rocard will visit the Commonwealth<br />
Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.<br />
Mr Rocard's party ' will travel to Sydney on 19 August and<br />
will attend a conference on the Australian economy and<br />
our bilateral trade relations. The Treasurer,<br />
Mr Keating, will be present at the conference. </p>
