PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE,<br />
AUGUST 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: The decisions I'm about to announce of course are<br />
against the background of Australia's total unequivocal<br />
condemnation of the invasion by Iraq of Kuwait and its<br />
subsequent reported annexation. We join with the rest of<br />
the world in saying that we will not tolerate, will not<br />
stand idly by while any member of the international<br />
community purports to break the rules of civilised<br />
conduct in that way. We've been considering what more<br />
should be done in addition to our joining with the rest<br />
of the world in imposing sanctions, to give an additional<br />
response to what is happening in the gulf. We have been<br />
in contact with Washington on this issue. I have<br />
discussed the matter with a number of my Ministers, the<br />
Deputy Prime Minister Paul Keating, with Ministers Evans,<br />
Ray, Duffy and Button. And against that preparatory<br />
thinking that we've been undertaking President Bush<br />
called me this morning, I had a lengthy conversation with<br />
him. And out of that conversation we agreed that<br />
Australia would contribute to a multinational task force<br />
in the gulf. Let me make it clear that the primary<br />
purpose of that multinational naval task force will be to<br />
enforce the blockade on Iraq and Kuwait and of course to<br />
protect the exports from other oil producing gulf<br />
countries and to protect other trade in the gulf. That's<br />
its primary purpose, to enforce the blockade and to keep<br />
other trade free. But by its very nature its worth<br />
saying that the force will contribute to the deterrence<br />
we believe of further aggression by Iraq. Obviously when<br />
a decision of this sort is made there is a number of<br />
important issues of detail that have to be resolved and<br />
there will be discussions going on now between the United<br />
States people and ourselves to deal with those matters.<br />
Without being exhaustive they obviously include the<br />
question of the status of the force, what the other<br />
membership of it will be and the command structure. Our<br />
ships of course will remain under Australian National<br />
command, but they may operate when they get there, under<br />
US or some other form of actual operation control. Now<br />
these issues are important issues and they will be<br />
discussed now in the hours and the days ahead. We will<br />
send two guided missile frigates, FFG's, the Adelaide and<br />
Darwin and they will be supported by the replenishment<br />
tanker Success. Let me say, and if you want to go to any<br />
more technical questions on these matters, Admiral D </p>
<p>Beaumont is available. But let me say that these two<br />
FFG's are extremely capable ships with comprehensive self<br />
defence capability. They have a Standard air defence<br />
missile, Close In Weapons System, the Harpoon Anti-Ship<br />
Missile, Electronic counter measures and they will also<br />
be equipped with Sea Hawk helicopters. Each frigate has<br />
a crew of approximately two hundred, that's for each of<br />
the frigates and also the Success has a crew of the same<br />
magnitude. I'm given to understand that the ships will<br />
be able to leave Australia within five days and they will<br />
be on station within twenty two days. Let me say that we<br />
understand that in making this decision the deployment<br />
may involve significant risks. It is a potentially high<br />
threat environment into which the ships will be moving,<br />
but we have profound faith in the equipment and the<br />
training of our men in their capacity to meet any<br />
situation which they will be confronted. The actual<br />
conditions of service and other aspects will be<br />
considered by Cabinet, but let me make it quite clear<br />
directly to the members of our naval forces that are<br />
concerned and to the public that the Australian<br />
Government will be providing conditions commensurate with<br />
the serious nature of this deployment. So I conclude<br />
ladies and gentlemen as I began by saying that what we<br />
are witnessing in the gulf at the moment is a series of<br />
actions and threats which are entirely unacceptable to<br />
the Australian Government and we are prepared to play a<br />
responsible part in seeking to ensure that this<br />
aggression is deterred and that the blockade that has<br />
been decided upon and the embargoes that have been<br />
imposed should be effective. And I express the hope that<br />
in this way a further escalation of conflict will be<br />
avoided and the hope that President Suddam Hussein will<br />
understand that the only sensible course of action now is<br />
to withdraw his forces from Kuwait and to allow the<br />
restoration of the former government in that country.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister is Australia responding to a<br />
request from the United States or is this offer made off<br />
our own bat?<br />
PM: The matter was raised with us initially in the<br />
United States and we therefore responded. We had<br />
discussions with them there and it was out of those<br />
preliminary discussions that were initiated from the<br />
United States that the President rang me today and that<br />
out of those discussions we agreed that this Australian<br />
naval asset would be provided.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister these United Nations<br />
sanctions, wouldn't it have been better to wait for the<br />
United Nations or seek a United Nations response before<br />
committing ships?<br />
PM: We can always find a reason and an excuse for not<br />
playing a responsible role in a threatening situation and<br />
if we had wanted to do that yes we could have easily done<br />
that, but I believe that the gravity of the situation is </p>
<p>such that it warranted this action at this time by<br />
Australia. Obviously I believe it would be the<br />
preference of the United States as well as of Australia<br />
that there could be a United Nations flag operation and<br />
that is not out of the question. It may be that that<br />
emerges. But in circumstances of this kind I think it's<br />
not appropriate to wait until the ideal actually emerges,<br />
but if that can emerge Australia will be very happy.<br />
JOURNALIST: What other countries are going to be<br />
involved in this force?<br />
PM: Well already you will appreciate that there are<br />
naval forces there. You've got the United States, you've<br />
got Britain and you've got the Dutch. The Italians are<br />
going to be providing facilities and there is the NATO<br />
meeting today in Paris in which this whole issue will be<br />
discussed. So obviously a number of West Europeans will<br />
be involved and I know that the matter is being<br />
considered by our friends in Canada. I have had<br />
discussions by telephone with my friend Brian Mulroney<br />
and no decision has been made there, but the matter is<br />
being considered in Canada. It may be also that Japan<br />
could be involved.<br />
JOURNALIST: Any discussion Prime Minister of aircraft or<br />
ground crews?<br />
PM: No. There has been no question raised of any other<br />
Australian commitment other than the naval assets to<br />
which I have referred.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister US television networks have<br />
reported that you at some stage actually phoned President<br />
Bush, was there an earlier conversation?<br />
PM: No I didn't phone President Bush. But as I said<br />
quite straightforwardly there had been earlier<br />
discussions at officials levels initiated in the first<br />
place by the United States, but the only contact between<br />
President Bush and myself was the phone call from him to<br />
me this morning.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister did President Bush give you<br />
an assessment this morning of the likelihood of the<br />
conflict escalating?<br />
PM: Well he was you'll appreciate there are some<br />
aspects of the conversation that I can't make public<br />
but I think I can say this, that the President was<br />
optimistic about the degree of support that was being<br />
proffered. For instance in an operational sense he<br />
indicated that port facilities would be available in some<br />
neighbouring States, I won't name them for obvious<br />
reasons, but it wouldn't be therefore a situation that<br />
our naval forces would be operating without access to<br />
relatively adjacent port facilities. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Have you thought how long you might leave<br />
these ships there? The reason I ask is that I understand<br />
Iraq has supplies and it will be months before these<br />
sanctions bite, and secondly where are these three ships<br />
at the moment?<br />
PM: The two that we're talking about, the Adelaide and<br />
Darwin where are they Admiral?<br />
ADMIRAL BEAUMONT: Eastern Australia. In Sydney.<br />
PM: They are actually in Sydney. They are in Sydney.<br />
And the Success. And as I say, I'm informed it's five<br />
days, within five days.<br />
ADMIRAL BEAUMONT: They sail on Monday Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Yes, they sail on Monday.<br />
JOURNALIST: In the past both Presidents Carter and<br />
Reagan faced some pretty important consequences as a<br />
result of deploying forces into the Middle East. What<br />
are your apprehensions about sending an Australian<br />
contingent, given that background?<br />
PM: Well these are not decisions that any Prime Minister<br />
here or President of the United States makes lightly,<br />
because the record of the Government with which we are<br />
now particularly concerned is not a terribly attractive<br />
one. The United States particularly has a large number<br />
of people who are being detained in Iraq and Baghdad. We<br />
are doing everything we can of course to try and protect<br />
the welfare and the safety of Australian citizens. We<br />
are in constant communication, not only of course with<br />
our own diplomatic representatives but they with other<br />
like-minded countries. We will do everything we can to<br />
ensure the safety of Australians. But when you're faced<br />
with a situation like this you've, I believe, got to make<br />
the decisions which you believe are most calculated to<br />
bring about a situation where the aggressor will<br />
understand that a continuation of those actions is not<br />
only not acceptable to the international community but<br />
that any intelligent assessment of self-interest on the<br />
part of Iraq must lead to the conclusion that the troops<br />
should be withdrawn.<br />
JOURNALIST: first question Prime Minister, how long<br />
are we likely to stay there given Iraq's<br />
PM: I'm sorry Laurie. Well, obviously I can't give a<br />
definitive answer to that. I can express the hope that<br />
it would be a relatively short period. But you are right<br />
in referring to the fact that there is, according to the<br />
reports, a fairly substantial reserve of foodstuffs. We<br />
understand for instance that there's something like six<br />
months' supply of grain there in Iraq. But there is<br />
already, may I say, an impact of the sanctions. For<br />
instance, in regard to both pipelines, that is the </p>
<p>pipelines across Turkey and across Saudi Arabia, there<br />
are no tankers loading and those pipelines are now not<br />
operating. They will already be suffering an impact upon<br />
their receipts. And of course any expectation that they<br />
may have had about being able to receive the income from<br />
the very substantial Kuwaiti assets abroad, has been<br />
frustrated by the action that's been taken around the<br />
world including here in Australia to freeze those assets.<br />
So Laurie I think that in fact you'll already be starting<br />
to get a very significant impact, and that's an impact<br />
which will escalate in economic terms very significantly<br />
in the days and weeks ahead. So I repeat, that any<br />
intelligent rational assessment by the leadership of Iraq<br />
ought to lead to the conclusion that their best interests<br />
are served by a withdrawal. Now, unfortunately, we can't<br />
proceed on the basis that rational, intelligent<br />
assessments will be the only criteria in considerations<br />
which lead to action there. So I can't be dishonest to<br />
say I know how long, but I think what is true, Laurie, is<br />
that the more nations like Australia with a capacity to<br />
make a commitment as I've made, the more this is done and<br />
the more that the leadership of Iraq understands that<br />
they are confronting a very, very comprehensive<br />
opposition to their position, the more likely it is that<br />
we will be looking at a relatively short period. May I<br />
finally say, in answer to your question, that I think<br />
you'll agree that an important part in this gathering of<br />
a representative opposition will be what is done by parts<br />
of the Arab world and I'm hopeful that there may be some<br />
accession of Arab forces in those that will be lined up<br />
in opposition to Iraq.<br />
JOURNALIST: Despite the petrol price freeze, some of the<br />
impact of the Gulf conflict will feed through to the<br />
September quarter CPI. Do you believe this should be<br />
discounted from the wage increase that will flow as a<br />
result? PM: Well, frankly, I have, as a result of the action<br />
that the Treasurer took yesterday on behalf of the<br />
Government that we won't actually see any significant<br />
feed through, so to that extent I hope, Milton, that the<br />
question remains hypothetical and I therefore, you know,<br />
don't address it now. I mean, if the issue arises, we'll<br />
address it at the time.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just to clear up something<br />
PM: Yes, sure.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are we committed for the duration of the<br />
blockade? PM: Yes, we, as I've said, the primary purpose of the<br />
commitment of the Australian naval forces is to enforce<br />
the blockade and that's on Iraq and Kuwait and to<br />
protect, as I say, the movement of other oil producers in </p>
<p>the region and our intention would be to commit these<br />
forces for as long as is necessary to successfully<br />
achieve that primary purpose.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you believe it would be necessary to<br />
protect our personnel in the Navy from the possible use<br />
of chemical weapons?<br />
PM: Well, I'm sure that our naval authorities will be<br />
completely aware of the environment and the potential<br />
dangers into which they are moving and that they'll have<br />
all the appropriate protective apparatus. But when I've<br />
finished, if you want to address any, as I say, technical<br />
question like that, but that would be my obvious<br />
assumption. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister<br />
PM: And I see from the affirmative nod of the Admiral,<br />
that the Prime Ministerial assumption is correct.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you see the need to increase<br />
security on our shores because of any possible terrorist<br />
threats arising from our involvement?<br />
PM: Well, we have, as a Government, have attached very<br />
considerable importance to ensuring the capacity of<br />
Australia, both by our own efforts and by a high degree<br />
of cooperation with other nations, having the capacity to<br />
meet any terrorist threat. We haven't been slack in that<br />
regard in the past and I would believe that in the<br />
circumstances all those who have a responsibility in this<br />
area would be particularly alert.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, indications last night<br />
that you'd wait till next week before announcing a<br />
decision, did President Bush urge you to make an<br />
announcement more quickly than<br />
PM: No, as I've said to you, my dear friends, before and<br />
I say it again, don't get led away by what you write<br />
yourself in creating an expectation for me about my<br />
parameters and framework of decision-making. I mean, you<br />
don't do it and you haven't on this occasion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, has any assessment been made<br />
of the likely Iraqi reaction, especially with regards<br />
Australians that are still in Iraq or in Kuwait?<br />
PM: Well, let me say this. As you would imagine I have<br />
been following these issues almost on an hourly basis<br />
since the crisis arose and I have been reassured in my<br />
reading of the continuous stream of cables about the fact<br />
that our representative in Baghdad is in continuous<br />
contact with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs there about<br />
the welfare of Australian citizens and is doing that in<br />
very significant cooperation with other like-minded<br />
countries. So I can assure you that up till this point, </p>
<p>we've been doing all that we can and clearly in these<br />
circumstances we'll continue to do that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there any contingency for an adverse<br />
reaction by the Iraqis to our sending ships to the Gulf?<br />
PM: Well, the point I'm making is I don't think we could<br />
have been, up until this point, doing more than we have<br />
been doing to try and secure the safety of Australians in<br />
the region and we'll continue to do that.<br />
JOURNALIST: What is the extent of Australian role here?<br />
You've said that it's mainly an enforcement mechanism for<br />
the sanctions that are imposed, you've also said that US<br />
ships would be in control of the Australian ships<br />
PM: that could be, well..<br />
JOURNALIST: I'm just wondering, do you say that<br />
Australian ships will not be involved in any direct<br />
military attack or support for it<br />
PM: Let me, yes, that's a good question. I have<br />
said what the purpose is, what the agreement has been.<br />
If there were any request to escalate the role of our<br />
assets, then that would be a matter for request,<br />
discussion, negotiation and then decision.<br />
JOURNALIST: A related question, Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is this the absolute limit of our<br />
involvement, having ruled out the use of ground troops<br />
and our aircraft<br />
PM: Well, Laurie, no question has been raised about that<br />
and I will be totally frank with you in this, no question<br />
has been raised about it. It's our belief that the best<br />
that Australia, the most effective contribution that<br />
Australia can make is the one that we are making and I<br />
don't anticipate any request for assets from our airforce<br />
or from the army. I don't anticipate any requests<br />
because I don't think, in that respect, we are likely to<br />
be seen as able to be as effective by way of contribution<br />
as we are in our naval assets. If, and this is purely<br />
if such a request were at any time in the future to<br />
be made, we would obviously consider it, but I doubt that<br />
any such request would be made.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what are the chances of<br />
boosting our naval contribution to the blockade?<br />
PM: Well, let me say this, that the President was very<br />
grateful for the commitment that I made. It's seen as a<br />
very significant contribution and indeed when you look at<br />
our size, by any objective assessment, it is a<br />
significant contribution and again, from the </p>
<p>conversations that I've had and that have been held by<br />
our representatives, I don't anticipate that there will<br />
be a request for any larger commitment of our naval<br />
assets. Again, let me say this, if a situation arose<br />
where there were to be such a request we'd examine it,<br />
but I don't expect that such a request will be made.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, have you discussed this<br />
commitment with any of the Arab countries and<br />
particularly Saudi Arabia?<br />
PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you have any discussions with President<br />
Bush or have you got any information on the likely<br />
strength of Arab on this?<br />
PM: I did have a discussion with President Bush about<br />
this. I do have some understanding of his expectations,<br />
but I think, for reasons you'll understand, I can't go to<br />
that. JOURNALIST: What about the security of Australians<br />
elsewhere in the region, such as Saudi Arabia and<br />
Bahrain, other States?<br />
PM: Well, the comments that I made before about the<br />
safety of Australian citizens apply to those regions.<br />
Just, if I could refer to, give you some numbers. We<br />
know of 55 Australians in Iraq, about 3,000 in Saudi<br />
Arabia and less than 20 in Kuwait. I won't go to<br />
individuals, there is some information about some<br />
individuals, but that's the disposition, as it were, of<br />
Australians in the region and in each of those areas we<br />
are, either through our own diplomatic presence or in the<br />
case of areas where we don't have representation through<br />
other friendly embassies, we are in constant<br />
communication. We don't have reason at the moment to<br />
believe that all Australians, for instance, need to be<br />
evacuated from Saudi Arabia. We're recommending quite<br />
clearly that people don't travel there now. I mean, it<br />
would be quite pointless for people to be travelling in<br />
to that region, but you would appreciate that not only in<br />
regard to Australians, but in regard to a number of<br />
foreigners who are there in that region, a lot of them<br />
would be involved, for instance, in the oil production<br />
processes and it's important with the loss of the Iraq<br />
and Kuwait production which is of the order of four<br />
million barrels per day, that we don't have people<br />
leaving en masse from the other Gulf producing areas, oil<br />
producing areas, because it's important that to the<br />
extent they can, they increase their production to make<br />
up in part for the shortfall created by that loss of four<br />
million barrels per day.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, if there was a request later for<br />
wider military involvement, would you think it's<br />
necessary to take that to your full Cabinet and, </p>
<p>secondly, did you give any consideration to calling the<br />
full Cabinet together on this matter?<br />
PM: In answer to your first question, obviously at the<br />
next Cabinet meeting, whether there is a request or not,<br />
I will give a detailed report to the full Cabinet about<br />
this matter and if the question of further involvement<br />
did arise, we would have time to have a full Cabinet<br />
consideration of it and that would be done. In these<br />
circumstances, Michelle, I didn't regard it as necessary,<br />
but I think you can see that it was a fairly<br />
representative group of Ministers that I consulted.<br />
JOURNALIST: In light of decision, Prime Minister, is<br />
a special watch being kept on the Iraqi community in<br />
Australia? PM: On the?<br />
JOURNALIST: Light of today's decision<br />
PM: Whether<br />
JOURNALIST: Is a special watch being kept on the Iraqi<br />
community in Australia?<br />
PM: I think that question, the answer to that question<br />
is comprehended in something I said earlier, we would<br />
regard our normal processes, our normal relevant<br />
processes in Australia, to be operating appropriately and<br />
effectively. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what's your best assessment<br />
now of, firstly, the likelihood of an Iraqi invasion of<br />
Saudi Arabia and, secondly, the ability of the other oil<br />
producing countries to crank up their production and take<br />
up the shortfall?<br />
PM: Alright, well, there's two separate questions there.<br />
In regard to the first, as I say, I have been, I've had<br />
the capacity to follow all the intelligence on this<br />
matter and let me pay tribute to our relevant bodies here<br />
in Australia, particularly the Office of National<br />
Assessments which keeps up a continuous flow of<br />
information. I mean, I pay tribute to them. They are<br />
very effective. So relying on that and the conversations<br />
I've had, I would think on balance that an invasion from<br />
Saudi Arabia is unlikely, but as I said before, in answer<br />
to a previous question, one has to understand that in<br />
trying to analyse these situations, there's not only the<br />
criterion of rationality and self interest assessment,<br />
which needs to be taken into account because one would<br />
have thought that if those had been the only criteria<br />
that had been applied, one would have thought the<br />
leadership of Iraq would have adhered to the promise that<br />
it made to its Arab neighbours, to the Arab community<br />
generally, that they wouldn't invade Kuwait because an<br />
application of those criteria will have led to the </p>
<p>conclusion that an invasion was against the best<br />
interests of Iraq. But to the extent that you can<br />
therefore apply considerations of what intelligently is<br />
the most likely course of action, my answer is I think it<br />
not likely. Now in regard to the second but there is,<br />
could I just add this, this rider. There is so much<br />
evidence of an Iraq, a continued Iraqi presence in Kuwait<br />
beyond what is necessary merely to hold their position,<br />
and of a build-up of forces, additional forces still<br />
within Iraq and on the border, that you can't discount<br />
the possibility for that reason. Now as to the second<br />
question, let me say this. That, as I put to you, the<br />
combined production in day terms of Iraq and Kuwait is of<br />
the order of four million barrels per day. These things<br />
need to be taken into account in looking at the likely<br />
impact on the availability of oil and of prices. It is<br />
the case that the world has a higher level of stocks now<br />
than it has had for about six years and therefore there<br />
is a capacity to run down, let's say, those stocks by a<br />
million barrels per day for some time. If you make that<br />
assumption then the additional production that would be<br />
necessary from the rest of the OPEC and the non-OPEC<br />
countries would be only to the order of three billion<br />
barrels a day to make up the balance. The assessment is<br />
that there is that capacity available. It will obviously<br />
be regarded as in the interests of many of those<br />
producers to do so. There is evidence that they are<br />
doing it. In the pricing field you can perhaps draw some<br />
conclusions. Prices are expressed in United States<br />
dollars. Before the invasion the price per barrel was<br />
just under $ 2OUS a barrel. It peaked a couple of days<br />
ago at $ 30 a barrel. It's down to $ 25 now. Now you<br />
can't, just from those figures, draw any absolute<br />
conclusion but it's not inconsistent with the proposition<br />
I just put to you.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, could I ask a question of<br />
Admiral Beaumont through you, a technical question?<br />
PM: Yes sure.<br />
JOURNALIST: During the Kangaroo ' 89 military exercise,<br />
the Fills armed with exocet missiles bombing runs<br />
against the guided missile frigates, such as the ones<br />
we're sending. Are you able to say how often the Fills<br />
with the exocets have been successful in killing the..?<br />
ADMIRAL BEAUMONT: No I'm not.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you confirm that that does happen?<br />
ADMIRAL BEAUMONT: It does happen occasionally, yes. But<br />
for the most part against individual ships. But these<br />
ships would be operating as part of a task group we<br />
believe, so there'd be a layered defence process. But<br />
yes, it does occur. I'm not able to say how frequently.<br />
But suffice to say that the guided missile frigates have </p>
<p>a very competent and very capable anti-air missile system<br />
and have very good results in our exercises.<br />
JOURNALIST: Admiral, is that system a phalanx system?<br />
ADMIRAL BEAUMONT: No, I'm talking about a standard.<br />
JOURNALIST: So they're not equipped with that.<br />
ADMIRAL BEAUMONT: They are equipped with phalanx as<br />
well... JOURNALIST: On another topic, can you tell us what the<br />
implication will be for federal Labor with the change of<br />
leadership in Victoria?<br />
PM: No I can't. I don't want, obviously, to intrude<br />
unduly in what I've said consistently is the affair of<br />
the Victorian Parliamentary Party. I would like to take<br />
this opportunity of saying, I repeat what I said<br />
publicly, that I respect greatly the manner in which John<br />
cain relinquished the Premiership. Mrs Kirner's win was<br />
a decisive one. I believe that Mr Crabb is serious in<br />
the unqualified commitment he gave to her leadership. I<br />
believe now that there will be a concentrated attempt by<br />
all groups within the Victorian Labor Party to get behind<br />
Joan Kirner and to give her all the support that she's<br />
obviously going to need in this very challenging task.<br />
As far as the Commonwealth Government is concerned, we<br />
will, within what is appropriately in our capacity, do<br />
everything we can to assist her.<br />
JOURNALIST: In light of the present trends can you see<br />
Ros Kelly as the likely next Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Well, how old will she be when I retire? She'll<br />
have a lot of experience under her belt by then.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on the September special national<br />
conference, do you see the need for more flexibility to<br />
make decisions between meetings of the national<br />
conference itself. Do you think it would help your<br />
Cabinet if you did have that power?<br />
PM: Look, I'm not going to speculate in any way which<br />
may be unhelpful to the processes which, I can assure<br />
you, and you know, are going on now, between now and the<br />
special conference. There's a lot of talking going on<br />
between a lot of people and a lot of groups to try and<br />
get an outcome which is going to be the best for the<br />
Party and the Government. I think that when the time<br />
comes the Party will understand the importance of making<br />
decisions that are in the best interests of, not just the<br />
Party, but of the country. I have confidence that that<br />
will be the outcome. So I don't want to say anything<br />
more particular than that which could be unhelpful in<br />
these very detailed processes of discussion which are<br />
going on. </p>

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, does the fact that Michael<br />
Duffy is taking part in the opening ceremony of the new<br />
Chinese embassy indicate a thaw in our relations with<br />
China? PM: No, I think that's an appropriate level. He's the<br />
acting Foreign Minister and I think that's appropriate.<br />
We are handling this issue I think in a sensible way, and<br />
I don't mean just the issue of the opening of the<br />
embassy. I mean the issue of our relations. As I made<br />
clear, we've got to walk that, at some times difficult<br />
line, between making sure that China understands our and<br />
other nations' position that what happened some more than<br />
twelve months ago is not something to be forgotten, and<br />
at the same time on the other side try so to conduct our<br />
relations with them in a way which will mean that China<br />
is going to remain open to the rest of the world because<br />
it's in no-one's interests, and least of all those within<br />
China who want to see a reformed China and an open China,<br />
if countries like Australia close themselves off from<br />
them. So that's at times, as I say, a difficult line. I<br />
think we're walking it appropriately.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you see any inconsistency though in<br />
actions like Mr Duffy's and the Government's, in<br />
particular Senator Evans', strongly repeated condemnation<br />
of the National Party's visit to China?<br />
PM: No.<br />
