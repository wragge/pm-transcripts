<p>His RoyalÂ Highness the Duke of Edinburgh willÂ travel to and from Australia by regularly-scheduledÂ QantasÂ Boeing flights, on his visit to Perth for the BritishÂ Empire and Commonwealth Games. He will arrive in SydneyÂ from London via San Francisco on Tuesday, 20th November andÂ come on to Canberra by R. A. A. F. Metropolitan Convair.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness will leave Perth on his homewardÂ journey again by the Qantas scheduled Perth/ London service.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government has arranged withÂ Qantas for the Duke and his party to travel in the forwardÂ section of the aircraft. Normal seating facilities in theÂ rear compartment will be available to other passengers.</p>
<p>As His Royal Highness will be in Canberra onlyÂ briefly after the long flight, he will have few engagements.Â Details of these engagements are not yet available.</p>
