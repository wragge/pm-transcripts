SPEECH BY THE PRIME MlINISTER, MR, E. G. WHITLAM,. O. C.,<br />
AT THE OPENING OF THE MASTER BUILDERS' ASSOCIATION CENTENARY<br />
PARADE OF HOMES AND PRESENTATION OF THE " PEARCE RESERVE" TO<br />
THE MUNICIPALITY OF BLACKIOWN, AT KINGS LANGLEY, NEAR SEVEN<br />
HILLS,-FRIDAY 14 SEPTEMBER 1973-<br />
No ONE SEEING THIS EXHIBITION CAN BE OTHER THAN<br />
IMPRESSED AND ENCOURAGED BY THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
BUILDING INDUSTRY, No ONE CAN DOUBT THE INDUSTRY'S ABILITY TO<br />
PROVIDE HOUSING OF HIGH QUALITY AND IMAGINATIVE DESIGN. IT<br />
WOULD-BE A PITY, HOWEVER, IF THIS FINE DISPLAY OF HOMES WERE<br />
USED MERELY AS A PROMOTIONAL EXERCISE, IT SHOULD ALSO SERVE TO<br />
REMIND US OF A RESPONSIBILITY WE ALL SHARE -GOVERNMENTS1<br />
BUILDERS, DEVELOPERS, AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES -TO ENSURE THAT<br />
THE HOUSING NEEDS OF OUR PEOPLE ARE FULLY AND PROMPTLY MET.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WAITING Al" LONG TIME<br />
FOR A FAIR DEAL IN HOUSING, I HOPE YOU WILL FORGIVE ME IF I<br />
RECALL SOME WORDS I USED 20 YEARS AGOp IN MY FIRST SPEECH IN<br />
THE NATIONAL PARLIAMENT. I SAID THEN:<br />
NO~ ONE THINKS THAT 20 YEARS AGO THE PEOPLE OF<br />
AUSTRALIA WERE ADEQUATELY HOUSED; AND NOBODY<br />
THINKS THAT THEY ARE ADEQUATELY HOUSED NOW. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
TWENTY YEARS LATER, THOSE WORDS ARE STILL TRUE, IT IS SHAMEFUL<br />
THAT IN 1973, THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA ARE STILL NOT ADEQUATELY<br />
HOUSED, IT IS SHAMEFUL THAT IN A NATION WITH ABUNDANT SPACE,<br />
CONSIDERABLE WEALTH, A MODEST POPULATION, AND A GENERAL<br />
COMMITMENT TO THE IDEALS OF SOCIAL WELFARE, THOUSANDS OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN FAMILIES ARE BADLY HOUSED AND ARE UNABLE TO AFFORD<br />
THIS FUNDAMENTAL AMENITY OF A DECENT LIFE, MY GOVERNMENT IS<br />
DETERMINED TO PUT THIS RIGHT, WE ARE DETERMINED TO ENSURE, WITH<br />
THE HELP OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, THAT EVERY AUSTRALIAN<br />
FAMILY CAN SECURE ACCOMMODATION OF ITS OWN CHOOSING, APPROPRIATE<br />
TO ITS OWN NEEDS,<br />
THE BUDGET BROUGHT DOWN BY MY COLLEAGUE, THE TREASURER,<br />
LAST MONTH WAS ONE OF THE PRIMARY INSTRUMENTS IN THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
DRIVE FOR BETTER HOUSING, WE TOOK ACTION ON SEVERAL FRONTS,<br />
OUR PRIORITIES CAN BEST BE SUMMED UP BY COMPARING OUR FIRST<br />
BUDGET WITH THAT OF LAST YEAR, BY FAR THE BIGGEST INCREASE<br />
324 PER CENT WAS IN THE CATEGORY OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY<br />
AMENITIES, ,/ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
WE PROVIDED $ 136 MILLION FOR OUR INITIATIVES IN THE<br />
CITIES, INCLUDING $ 33 MILLION FOR EXPENDITURE ON NEW CITIES<br />
SUCH AS ALBURY-WODONGA. WE HAVE SET ASIDE $ 30 MILLION THIS<br />
FINANCIAL YEAR TO HELP THE STATES ACQUIRE LAND FOR URBAN<br />
DEVELOPMENT. THIS SHOULD BE SEEN AS MERELY THE BEGINNING OF<br />
A CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IN LAND<br />
ACQUISITION AND MANAGEMENT FOR THE BENEFIT AND WELFARE OF THE<br />
WHOLE COMMUNITY. AT THE PREMIERS' CONFERENCE IN JUNE WE AGREED<br />
TO ADVANCE $ 219 MILLION TO THE STATES FOR WELFARE HOUSING<br />
PURPOSES. THIS IS 26 PER CENT MORE THAN IN 1972-73,. WE<br />
PROVIDED $ 102 MILLION IN THE BUDGET FOR HOUSING LOANS UNDER THE<br />
DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES SCHEME THIS FINANCIAL YEAR. FINALLY, AS<br />
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE INTRODUCED A GRADUATED FORM OF TAX DEDUCTIONS<br />
OF INTEREST RATES FOR HOME BUYERS.<br />
THE KEY TO ALL OUR EFFORTS FOR DECENT HOUSING IS AN<br />
ATTACK ON THE HIGH PRICE OF LAND. IT IS INTOLERABLE THAT YOUNG<br />
HOME BUYERS IN THIS CONTINENT SHOULD OFTEN PAY MORE FOR AN EMPTY<br />
BLOCK THAN THEY DO FOR A HOUSE. WE ARE DETERMINED TO SEE THAT MORE<br />
LAND IS MADE AVAILABLE FOR HOUSING AT REASONABLE PRICES, THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS NEGOTIATING WITH THE STATES TO ESTABLISH<br />
LAND COMMISSIONS. THEIR PURPOSE WILL BE TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY<br />
OF LAND AVAILABLE FOR HOUSING AND TO INCREASE THE MARKET<br />
COMPETITION IN THE SUBDIVISION AND SALE OF HOUSING LAND. IN THE<br />
SAME WAY, OUR NEW CITY PROJECTS, UNDERTAKEN WITH THE SUPPORT OF<br />
THE STATES, WILL HELP ATTRACT POPULATION GROWTH AND HOUSING<br />
DEMAND AWAY FROM THE METROPOLITAN AREAS AND INCREASE THE SUPPLY<br />
OF LAND FOR HOUSING. I I/ U1 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS ENCOURAGING THE STATES<br />
TO ADOPT LEGISLATION FOR LAND PRICE STABILISATION, FROM READING<br />
THE NEWSPAPERS ONE COULD BE FORGIVEN FOR BELIEVING THAT THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT TO FREEZE LAND PRICES ALL OVER<br />
AUSTRALIA, WE OUGHT TO BE QUITE CLEAR THAT THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS NO POWER TO FREEZE LAND PRICES, OR EVEN TO<br />
STABILISE THEM, THE STATES HAVE THE POWER TO DO BOTH,<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIA HAS RECENTLY INTRODUCED A PRICE CONTROL ON HOME<br />
SITES, UNDER THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN SCHEME, THE FUTURE SELLING<br />
PRICE OF HOUSING SITES IS RESTRICTED TO THEIR PRESENT MARKET<br />
VALUE PLUS AN INFLATION FACTOR OF 7 PER CENT PER ANNUM, IN THIS<br />
WAY, THE INCENTIVE FOR SPECULATIVE DEALING IN HOUSE SITES IS<br />
REMOVED, NEW SOUTH WALES AND VICTORIA HAVE ALSO ANNOUNCED THEIR<br />
INTENTION OF INTRODUCING LAND PRICE STABILISATION LEGISLATION,<br />
WE WANT ALL STATES TO CO-OPERATE IN DEALING WITH THIS PROBLEM,<br />
WE SHOULD NOT DELUDE OURSELVES THAT LAND PRICE INFLATION<br />
IS CAUSED ONLY BY THE SPECULATOR, LOOKING FOR SIMPLE SCAPEGOATS<br />
LIKE SPECULATORS WILL NOT, IN THE LONG RUN, SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS,<br />
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT EXCESSIVE DEMAND THROUGH LAND SPECULATION<br />
CAUSES SOME_ OF THE LAND PRICE SPIRAL, LAND PRICE INFLATION CAN<br />
ALSO BE CAUSED BY A REAL SHORTAGE OF HOUSING LAND, AGAIN, I<br />
SUGGEST, THE STATE GOVERNMENTS CAN ADOPT A NUMBER OF MEASURES TO<br />
OVERCOME THIS DEFICIENCY. THEY CAN STREAMLINE THEIR PRESENT<br />
PLANNING MACHINERY TO REDUCE DELAYS IN THE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS,<br />
THEY CAN ENCOURAGE LAND OWNERS SITTING ON LAND SUITABLE FOR<br />
SUBDIVISION TO SUBDIVIDE IT AND SELL IT, THEY CAN ASSIST IN<br />
REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF UNPRODUCTIVE TRADING IN BLOCKS OF LAND, </p>
<p>I HOPE I WILL NOT BE ACCUSED OF SELF-AGGRANDISEMENT<br />
IF I QUOTE SOME REMARKS ONCE MADE IN THIS CONTEXT BY SIR WINSTON<br />
CHURCHILL, HE STATED THE POSITION VERY ACCURATEL'' IN THESE<br />
WORDS: " A LAND OWNER WHO HAPPENS TO OWN A PLOT OF LAND ON THE<br />
OUTSKIRTS OF A BIG CITY WATCHES THE BUSY POPULATION<br />
AROUND HIM MAKING THE CITY LARGER AND MORE FAMOUS EVERY<br />
DAY AND ALL THE WHILE HE SITS AND DOES NOTHING, ROADS<br />
ARE MADE, SERVICES ARE IMPROVED AND WATER IS BROUGHT<br />
FROM RESERVOIRS A HUNDRED MILES AWAY, AND ALL THE WHILE<br />
THE LAND OWNER SITS STILL, EVERY ONE OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS<br />
IS EFFECTED BY THE LABOUR AND THE COST OF OTHER PEOPLE,<br />
To NOT ONE OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS DOES THE LAND OWNER, AS A<br />
LAND OWNER, CONTRIBUTE, AND YET EVERY ONE OF THEM ENHANCES<br />
THE VALUE OF HIS LAND, HE RENDERS NO SERVICE TO THE<br />
COMMUNITY, HE CONTRIBUTES NOTHING TO THE GENERAL WELFARE,<br />
HE CONTRIBUTES NOTHING TO THE PROCESS FROM WHICH HIS OWN<br />
ENRICHMENT IS DERIVED,"<br />
ONE OF THE DEPRESSING FEATURES OF THE PATTERN OF OUR<br />
URBAN GROWTH IS THAT WHILE WE HAVE BUILT PLENTY OF HOUSES IN<br />
OUTLYING AREAS OF OUR GREAT CITIES, THERE HAS BEEN NO CORRESPONDING<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY FACILITIES AND SOCIAL OPPORTUNITIES,<br />
UNLIKE OUR PREDECESSORS, WE DO NOT EQUATE HOUSING WITH SHELTER,<br />
IT IS NOT' ENOUGH TO ERECT ACRES OF HOUSES IN SOCIAL AND<br />
ENVIRONMENTAL WASTELANDS, WE-MUST PROVIDE MORE AESTHETIC AND<br />
CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS AND MORE SERVICES FOR THOSE WHO ARE<br />
BUILDING THEIR HOMES, </p>
<p>-6-<br />
So MUCH OF WHAT IS PLEASANT AND COMFORTABLE IN<br />
OUR LIVING ENVIRONMENT CAN BE PROVIDED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT,<br />
IN THE LAST SESSION OF PARLIAMENT, WE AMENDED THE GRANTS<br />
COMMISSION ACT TO ENABLE LOCAL'GOVERNMENT TO APPLY ON A<br />
REGIONAL BASIS FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT, COUNCILS WILL BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHERE LAND SHOULD<br />
BE DEVELOPED AND WHAT WILL BE BUILT UPON IT. LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
MUST BE GIVEN THE RESOURCES IN FINANCE AND EXPERTISE TO<br />
COPE WITH ITS INCREASING RESPONSIBILITIES IN ENVIRONMENT,<br />
WELFARE AND HOUSING,<br />
GOVERNMENTS, HOWEVER, CANNOT PROVIDE ALL THE AMENITIES<br />
AND SERVICES THAT AUSTRALIANS NEED, PROGRESSIVE AND PUBLICSPIRITED<br />
DEVELOPERS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO DO MORE. THIS GREAT<br />
HOUSING ESTATE, AND THE RESERVE BUILT UPON IT, SHOWS HOW THE<br />
BEST AND MOST ATTRACTIVE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS CAN RESPOND TO THE<br />
COMMUNITY'S NEEDS, TOO MANY DEVELOPERS IGNORE THESE NEEDS.<br />
BY BRINGING HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE INTO AN AREA TO SATISFY A DEMAND<br />
FOR HOUSING, SEVERE STRAINS ARE IMPOSED UPON SERVICES AND<br />
AMENITIES. I SUGGEST THAT IF PRIVATE DEVELOPERS WANT PLANNING<br />
APPROVAL FOR THEIR INITIATIVES IN SUBDIVIDED ESTATES, THEY MUST<br />
BE PREPARED TO ACCEPT GREATER RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSEQUENCES<br />
-OF THEIR ACTIONS, ,/ 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
THIS HANDSOME DISPLAY OF HOUSES IS TANGIBLE EVIDENCE<br />
OF WHAT THE AUSTRALIAN BUILDING INDUSTRY CAN PRODUCE. THE NEW<br />
RESERVE AND RECREATION FACILITIES WILL ADD GREATLY TO THE<br />
ATTRACTIVENESS OF THE WHOLE AREA. I CONGRATULATE THE MANY<br />
BUILDERS INVOLVED; I CONGRATULATE THE HOOKER CORPORATION,<br />
NO AUSTRALIAN SHOULD FEEL THAT HOUSING OF THIS QUALITY, IN THIS<br />
ENVIRONMENT, WITH THESE ROADS AND SERVICES, IS BEYOND HIS MEANS<br />
OR RESOURCES, NO AUSTRALIAN SHOULD FEEL THAT A COMFORTABLE AND<br />
WELL-BUILT HOME IN PLEASANT SURROUNDINGS IS BEYOND HIS DREAMS,<br />
LET THIS BE THE STANDARD OF HOUSING EXEMPLIFIED IN THIS<br />
EXHIBITION TODAY WHICH WE SEEK FOR ALL OUR PEOPLE.<br />
