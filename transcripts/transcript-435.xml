    <content><![CDATA[<p>BUSH 1PIRES IN TICTORIA</p>
<p>The tragic bush fires in Victoria have shocked us all,Â and I extend my sympathy to those who have suffered bereavement,Â loss of their homes or personal distress in other ways.Â </p>
<p>I have received a request today from the Acting Premier<br />of Victoria, Mr. Rylah, through Senator Gorton for Commonwealth<br />financial assistance and I have replied as foliows<br />" You have requested Cowmonwealth grant towards<br />cost of providing relief to persons in distress as result<br />of disastrous bushfires. On behalf of Commonwealth<br />Government I wish again to extend deepest sympathy to all<br />people affected by this disaster. -Je are readily prepared<br />to join with ycar Government in contributing towards the<br />cost of a scheme designed to provide for the immediate<br />relief of persons in distressed and necessitous<br />circumstances. I assume that at the ea liest opportunity<br />you will furnish details of the damage and provide an<br />estimate of the cost of relief measures. Meantime<br />Commonwealth funds will be made available if required on<br />the usual conditions, namely ( one) for with State<br />Government ( two) the joint funds are used only for relief<br />of personal hardship and ( three) expenditure is in due<br />course certified by State Auditor-General."<br />In November last, the Commonwealth made a grant of up<br />to Å 30,000 on a for basis with the State of New South ; ales<br />for the relief of personal hardship resulting from the recent<br />serious floods in New South Wales.</p>
<p>The Premier of New South Wales, ir. Heffron has nowÂ informed me that additional funds will be needed for this purposeÂ and he has asked the Commonwealth to provide a further Å 20,000Â to match a similar amount to be made available by the State.Â 7e have agreed to provide a further grant of up to Å 20,000. asÂ sought by the Premier.</p>
