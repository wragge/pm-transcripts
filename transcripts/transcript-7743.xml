PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH JOHN MCKENZIE, 4CA CAIRNS,<br />
18 SEPTEMBER 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
MCKENZIE: Thank you for joining me.<br />
PM: My pleasure.<br />
MCKENZIE: Today you are to talk to us in far north<br />
Queensland. You have probably just heard me talking to Bill<br />
Ludwick, the Branch Secretary of the AWU in Brisbane.<br />
PM: I just heard the very end of it, John.<br />
MCKENZIE: People suffering here in far north Queensland, as<br />
you would be well aware, over the years of your tenure as<br />
Prime Minister. I suppose one thing you have really been<br />
renowned for is your compassion for people who are<br />
suffering. Is there anything you can say to those who have<br />
lost their jobs here in far north Queensland at the moment.<br />
PM: You talking as a result of the pilots dispute.<br />
MCKENZIE: Sure.<br />
PM: well the first thing I'd say is that the strength of<br />
the Australian economy, the enormous growth of the tourism<br />
industry in the period Sincei we have been in office is a<br />
direct result John, of the fact that we've had a wages<br />
accord and a wages system under which the workers of<br />
Australia have exercised very very considerable restraint<br />
and that has meant this enormous increase in jobs, a<br />
trebling of the number of jobs in tourism in particular. A<br />
trebling of, well quadrupling of turn-over in the industry,<br />
and a trebling of the number of overseas tourists. Now<br />
that's all happened because we have been able to have<br />
workers in this country very responsibly exercising wage<br />
restraint. And what this dispute is about now is a<br />
situation where the pilots are trying to smash that by<br />
breaking right outside the system undoing what all your<br />
listeners, workers and their dependents have done. Now<br />
there would be much greater problems if we just gave into<br />
the pilots, which we are not prepared to do. Now having<br />
said that, of course, I am desperately concerned about the<br />
fact that the action of the pilots has imposed this hardship<br />
on people in Australia, in general, and to some particular </p>
<p>-2-<br />
extent in your area. I met with the tourist industry here<br />
last week John. And let me say these things about this.<br />
Firstly, they were very responsible. They said, we are not<br />
asking for compensation, but there are two things that they<br />
asked me to do and which I was more than happy to do. And I<br />
would particularise that in regard to your area. Where<br />
there are people who are suffering financially, as a direct<br />
result of this pilots dispute, I would say, and I hope I<br />
could use your program to say it That their bankers<br />
should exercise consideration and restraint in dealing with<br />
those problems. They should help to accommodate them<br />
because this dispute will end, and the fundamentals of our<br />
tourist industry and of your area particularly, remain<br />
unchanged. People are still going to see Australia for what<br />
it is. That's one of best the tourist destinations in the<br />
world and within that situation, John, they are going to see<br />
your area as one of the most attractive parts of Australia.<br />
So the fundamentals remain unchanged and I would ask<br />
bankers, and those who are in a financial relationship with<br />
operators, to accommodate them during this period. The<br />
dispute will end, its not going to take an indefinitely long<br />
time. And they should be assisted during this time. That's<br />
the first thing. Secondly John, even before the tourist<br />
representatives came I had talked about the possibility of<br />
some assistance to the industry after the dispute. They<br />
raised this with me, and I have indicated that I will<br />
provide some federal assistance to undertake a campaign when<br />
the dispute is over just to let the rest of the world know<br />
that we are back to normal. And that the facts are as I<br />
said. That Australia still remains the best tourist<br />
destination in the world. And amongst that it is very hard<br />
to beat the northern part of Queensland.<br />
MCKENZIE: I have got to bring up a point there on your<br />
commitment to ensuring this will never happen again. I have<br />
had people in mum and dad businesses going broke. I have<br />
had people part-time and full-time employed in the<br />
hospitality industry saying, why should we wait for it to be<br />
all over. Why should we go back to the hospitality<br />
industry, because we can't guarantee there is a structure to<br />
ensure this will never happen again. How strong is your<br />
commitment to ensure this sort thing can't happen again?<br />
PM: Well that's what its all about. The very fact, and<br />
with respect it should be so glaringly obvious. If we<br />
allowed the pilots to say to the rest of Australia and to<br />
all your listeners, look, you have played the game, you have<br />
exercised wage restraint, and on the basis of that we have<br />
built up this enormous growth in the economy and in the<br />
tourism industry in particular. But if we allowed the<br />
pilots to say, well, frankly bugger you, we will just go and<br />
exercise our strength and get 30 per cent increases. Then<br />
you have got no guarantee because everyone else will do it.<br />
The whole thing will be wrecked. It is only by making sure<br />
that the pilots are not allowed to wreck the system that<br />
your lksteners, and the people you are talking about, can<br />
have any confidence in the future. They can have no<br />
confidence if the pilots are allowed to wreck the system. </p>
<p>MCKENZIE: Talking about compensation a moment ago, the<br />
Member of Leichhardt, Mr Gayler would have informed you, I<br />
presume, of the sort of anger that stirred up here in the<br />
tourist industry here in north Queensland. And some of the<br />
operators are saying, look if you are going to give<br />
compensation to the airlines for that, the way you are doing<br />
it, couldn't you make it contigent on perhaps airfare<br />
packages that would stimulate some more business coming<br />
a reduction in airfares<br />
PM: You go right to the very heart of what this is about.<br />
Two things to say. The airlines are not getting any<br />
compensation in a different way from the tourism industry in<br />
regard to the losses generally that they are suffering.<br />
They are not getting anything for their general losses. The<br />
one thing that distinguishes the airlines in this dispute<br />
from the tourism industry, is that the tourism industry can<br />
and is standing down its employees. The airlines can't.<br />
And the compensation, the word that is being used, the<br />
financial recompense, is financial assistance, however you<br />
want to describe it, that is limited to what the airlines<br />
are faced with which the tourism industry isn't. So they<br />
can't stand down their employees, because if they did the<br />
whole thing would stop. So they are getting financial<br />
recompense for that. The tourism industry is and can stand<br />
down their people. But for the general loss that the<br />
airlines are suffering they are not getting a cent of<br />
compensation. Now going to your point about fares. The<br />
very fact of making sure that this dispute is won is going<br />
to mean that the airlines are going to get enormous<br />
productivity improvements. Once they have recouped their<br />
losses, got back to normal operation, then they will be<br />
employing something like between four and 500 less pilots.<br />
The pilots will be flying more and out of that significant<br />
productivity increase there will be the capacity in the<br />
airlines to have a better approach to fares than they<br />
otherwise would have. And we have said to the airlines,<br />
that we expect that once they have recouped their losses in<br />
this dispute, then we expect the productivity improvements<br />
to be shared with industry generally and that includes in<br />
particular the tourism industry.<br />
MCKENZIE: On a personal note, it must be rather strange for<br />
you after so many years as chief advocate for the ACTU to be<br />
really working, in some ways, very strongly and very closely<br />
with employers. Does it seem rather strange to you at<br />
times? PM: Well what I have always tried to do is to see what is<br />
the best way in which you can advance the interest of the<br />
country generally. I believe when I was President to the<br />
ACTU, and in fact this is a matter of record, I had lots of<br />
dealings with employers. I had a good relationship with<br />
employers as well as leading the trade union movement. What<br />
I always try to do at the end of a dispute was to say, well<br />
look, what's the thing which is going to recognise the </p>
<p>interest of the parties immediately concerned and the<br />
community generally. And that's how we got disputes<br />
settled. In this case we have a position where the pilots<br />
federation has just made it clear John, from early this<br />
year, that they were going to smash the industry. Have you<br />
actually, are you aware John, of the things that the pilots<br />
planned from the beginning of this year to smash the<br />
industry. MCKENZIE: We have heard rumours.<br />
PM: Well I'll just say that they are not rumours. Just<br />
could I, have you got time if I could quote to you from<br />
their own publication. Now this, I mean they are coming out<br />
and saying that they are terribly upset about what has<br />
happened in the tourism industry. Shedding their crocodile<br />
tears, the federation. Just let me read you some of the<br />
things John, from their publication that is called<br />
' Deadline And its the Australian Federation of<br />
Air Pilots. Now here you are in February they say, this<br />
publication will be issued regularly and cover many of the<br />
questions that you will have in the months that come such as<br />
the actions companies may take in the case of prolonged<br />
industrial action. That is what they talk about, prolonged<br />
industrial action. That's in February 89. They say that<br />
they will pursue every means available to obtain their<br />
claim. Now let's go on to some of things they then say.<br />
Then, this is may I remind you, early February and April.<br />
They say at some stage in one's working life, the potential<br />
to face a non-income period, and they call that NIP,<br />
non-income period. The potential to face a NIP exists. Now<br />
may be an appropriate time for the prudent pilot to review<br />
both long and short term financial arrangements. They then<br />
said, be prepared to adjust your lifestyle in the period<br />
leading up to and during the NIP, for-example, eating at<br />
home is cheaper than eating out. They then say, establish<br />
other employment opportunities. many people have acquired a<br />
taxi driver's licence. Then they say, this period is an<br />
excellent opportunity to complete many of the things that<br />
you may have been wanting to do. You may decide this is an<br />
excellent opportunity to have a complete break from the<br />
house, to go fishing, work on the car, start a lawn mowing<br />
business. MCKENZIE: I say to you they are probably getting a bit fed<br />
up with it by now though.<br />
PM: They might do. But just let me give you the last<br />
quote. This is the pilots starting in February. They say,<br />
a major reason for the stopworks being called was to inform<br />
you of the major battle ahead should the existing system not<br />
become flexible to remedy your real salary situation.<br />
Should it reach that stage then it will be a real battle, as<br />
we will be fighting the Government, the Arbitration system,<br />
the companies and all the vested interests. Now in other<br />
words John, the Federation, starting back in February, were </p>
<p>quite prepared to smash the tourist industry. And not only<br />
prepared to, they were planning to do it. Now what I'm<br />
saying to your people is, my Government has not been<br />
prepared to allow this to happen. Sure, in stopping it<br />
happening there has got to be some, you know there is some<br />
intermediate problems and we will do what we can, when the<br />
dispute is resolved, with help in advertising, to build the<br />
industry up quickly again. I plead with the banks and<br />
others to help people who are in temporary difficulties.<br />
But the real point is that the Federation was determined to<br />
do what no-one else was doing, every other workers were<br />
abiding by the system, they were going to smash it. Smash<br />
the tourism industry. We are not going to allow that to<br />
happen. MCKENZIE: One final point, I have only got 30 seconds<br />
leading up to news. one of the local operators would like<br />
you, in your capacity as Prime minister, to exert any sort<br />
of influence you can on the companies, on Strong and Abeles,<br />
to get our quota of flights as soon as possible back into<br />
this city.<br />
PM: Yes. Well I will certainly say to them that consistent<br />
with what they have got to do with the rest of Australia,<br />
that they will do as much as they can to help up there. But<br />
they have got to, obviously, try and do it in a rational way<br />
in regard to the whole of Australia. But let me make this<br />
point. I don't think I have to say very much, because, ask<br />
who are the biggest investors in the tourism industry in<br />
this country, amongst the biggest investors. It's the<br />
airlines. MCKENZIE: Thank you for your time this morning.<br />
PM: Thank you John, very much.<br />
ends </p>
