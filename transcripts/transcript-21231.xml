    <content><![CDATA[<p>CAVE:</p>
<p> Prime Minister what have you achieved on this trip?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I've learned a lot first hand by speaking to Mr Bremer and General Sanchez, General Abi Zaid and also the two members of the Iraqi governing council. I think I have a much better understanding of both the challenges but also the progress that has been made in Iraq over the last year and I'm more determined than ever that Australia should stay the distance and finish the task that Australia has because if those who are trying to deny Iraq her opportunity for freedom succeed it will send a very bad message not only in the Middle East but around the world.</p>
<p> CAVE:</p>
<p> One of the challenges has been the almost total failure of the training of the local police and military.  One of the things we're going to be doing is training a brigade of the army. Did any of them ask you for more help in that regard?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> No we haven't been asked for more help in that regard. I wouldn't agree that the training exercise has been a total failure.</p>
<p> CAVE:</p>
<p> Well I was actually quoting Mr Chalabi who I interviewed last week from...(inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well yes I understand, well based on what I have been told by the people I have met I wouldn't accept that it has been a total failure but there have been quite a number of failures and that is a matter of concern and I think one of the important messages that came through strongly to me is that it's important that Iraqi leaders be more prominent in publicly asserting what they so fervently believe privately and that is that the terrorists must be defeated and that the opportunity for freedom given by the removal of Saddam Hussein should not be lost.</p>
<p> CAVE:</p>
<p> Did any of the people you spoke to today ask you to do more?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> No, they didn't. The people I spoke to in, from the Iraqi governing council, no I think look the general view is obviously anything that Australia does is appreciated and obviously if we did do more that would be appreciated but I had made it very clear all along that we did not have a capacity to have large numbers of additional troops, I called them peacekeepers at the time a year ago and that remains the case. That doesn't mean that if there is small increase for whatever reason in the number of people deployed that that should be seen as some reversal of that original policy.</p>
<p> CAVE:</p>
<p> So will we be changing the mix more towards training?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well I haven't made any decision to do that and I wouldn't suggest that that will happen. I am just going to absorb everything that I have learnt. The great bulk of the people doing the training from Australia have only just arrived or have just begun to arrive and it will be some time of course before their initial deployment works its way through.</p>
<p> CAVE:</p>
<p> Training isn't a short-term commitment so we are not going to be out of here in a hurry are we?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> We'll its not a short-term commitment.  I'm not putting a time on our departure. I've indicated that the upcoming budget will fund our involvement in Iraq until the middle of next year, that's the end of the next financial year, the 30th June 2005. That doesn't mean we are going to leave on that date but simply means that we're making prudent provision for being in Iraq for a while yet.</p>
<p> CAVE:</p>
<p> Right now you should be visiting HMAS Stuart. What happened?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well HMAS Stuart has been required to help out in the aftermath of the suicide bombing and indeed to rescue some of the American wounded who were caught up in that suicide bombing and I immediately indicated that I didn't want the Stuart diverted from that important task just because I wanted to visit the vessel. That would be absurd and the wrong priority.  I will be talking on the telephone to the captain of the Stuart in a few moments to send him my good wishes. I'm sorry I can't see it but I think everybody would understand first things first, their job is to be involved in the coalition operation and this incident is a reminder of how valuable we are. I mean here is a case of some suicide bombings designed to get at the oil terminals and some American coastguard people have been killed and others wounded and our vessel was there to rescue the wounded and to provide help. Now that is a live example of just how valuable is the presence of our vessel and it gives something for those who think they should come home to think about.</p>
<p> CAVE:</p>
<p> Was there any consideration of bringing Mr Latham on this trip?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> No I have heard some suggestion that I should have but in the past prime ministers when they visit troops overseas have never taken opposition leaders with them. It's appropriate if there is a commemoration where both sides of politics would be represented but I have visited forces before I have never taken Mr Crean or Mr Beazley and they didn't expect to - they go themselves. If Mr Latham wants to come to Iraq he is very welcome to and I'm sure that every facility will be provided to him as the alternative prime minister but the idea that automatically whenever the prime minister visits troops overseas he takes the opposition leader has never been the practice in the past and I don't think its appropriate.</p>
<p> CAVE:</p>
<p> Do you think talking to the people you spoke to today might have changed his mind?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I don't know that's matter for him. I'm, I'm not going to reflect, he's got a hard and fast policy of getting out. I understand that, I think he is wrong, I think he is totally wrong. My view is certainly been strengthened and reinforced but I don't really, you know Mr Latham's policy is Mr Latham's business. I think it's completely wrong and particularly at a time when our close allies and friends need some support.</p>
