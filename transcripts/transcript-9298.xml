TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM<br />
I AUGUST 1994<br />
PM: Thank you for your introductory remarks. I think the first thing I would<br />
like to say is that we've had an excellent day of informal discussions<br />
at the Leaders! Retreat. This Is a day without officials, so that its not<br />
as if there is the distraction of, if you like, documentation and notes et<br />
cetera in the course of presentations and discuissions. Rather, an<br />
informal discussion where the leaders can sit down and discuss<br />
problems and review the progress of the. region. Now, we had a long<br />
discussion this morning about economic growth rates in the region,<br />
about per capita GDP growth rates relative to other similar regions in<br />
the world, looking at ways in which we might improve our economic<br />
performance, looking at some of the inhibitions to that economic<br />
growth 2nd deciding that in some areas we ought to focus agin on<br />
the theme of the conference which is resource management or how<br />
to manage resources better. So, we had quite a lengthy discussion<br />
about fisheries, airlines, forestry, tourism et cetera. And also I'll<br />
come back to those in a moment also, we agreed to re-appoint the<br />
Secretary-General, leremia Tabsi, and to decide that the Forum next<br />
year will be held In Papua New Guinea, and the year after that in the<br />
Marshall Islands, and the following year, in the Cook Islands. SO, I<br />
think that the forum has produced some substantial outcomes and let<br />
me just go to them.<br />
In fisheries, leaders have agreed on the merits of a multi-lateral<br />
approach to negotiating access to their exclusive economic zones on<br />
the basis that they can better and adequately improve the terms by<br />
negotiating on a multi-lateral basis, and where we believe existing<br />
bilateral arrangements are adequate, they can be maintained in a<br />
multi-lateral context This, I think, would be a substantial departure<br />
from the nature of bilateral arrangements between Pacific Island<br />
countries for the exploitation of their economic zones with some of<br />
the major fish-conisuming nations, and tha the aim would be to lift<br />
income in the area for what is one of the largest fishery regions, and<br />
fisheries, of the world. So, we've agreed to agree on the merits to a<br />
multi-lateral approach and we'll be using our, we believe we need to </p>
<p>strengthen our forum fisheries agency capacity so it can ensure more<br />
effective national control and management of the region's fisheries.<br />
So. that of course will ensue in the next year.<br />
On airlines, there was general agreement about the need to deal with<br />
airline losses and the combined airline losses of the Pacific area now<br />
equate to the aid which Is being provided by both Australia and New<br />
Zealand, which means there's a very large drain on the net income of<br />
Pacific Island countries. So, we agreed to look at the airline losses to<br />
examine the option for a rationalisation of air services among Forum<br />
island countries, perhaps on a sub-regional basis. That is, on a basis<br />
where air route and air route management would be in zones that<br />
made sense in terms of reach, access, service, price etc. Taking into<br />
account, of course, the needs of sub-economic clients, that is, the<br />
needs of some distant island countries where the service will be<br />
perpetually sub-economic.<br />
On forests, leaders have agreed to take further steps to prevent<br />
unsustainable rates of logging and to ensure a reasonable return to<br />
land owners and governments. During the afternoon, Prime Minister<br />
Hilly and I made a separate statement and some Important<br />
commitments which will assist Solomon Islands to manage its forests<br />
more sustainably And, as a consequence of that, leaders strongly<br />
expressed a strong concern about the exploitation of tropical forests<br />
in the region and welcomed the recent initiatives by Vanuatu and the<br />
Solomon Islands to halt the spread of unsustainable logging practices<br />
Including the introduction of independent monitoring systems and<br />
an agreement on the need to secure better and adequate returns for<br />
the exploitation of this resource for national income purposes. The<br />
forum also endorsed the undertaking of leaders to the Melanesian<br />
spearhead group to examine uniform legislation procedures and<br />
practices in forest resources and there, Australia and I think New<br />
Zealand have offered assistance where that may be valuable.<br />
We also had a discussion about the contribution which tourism can<br />
make to the economies of the region and noted, in particular, the<br />
need to protect the region's fragile coastal zones so that, again, with<br />
some focus on the need to maintain coastal zones and also to try and<br />
adopt better coastal zone management practices wherever it's<br />
possible, for some assistance to be provided there. The recent report<br />
by the Australian Resource Assessment Commission has led to a<br />
number of conclusions and recommendations, which may have<br />
application to the Pacific Island states, and the Government of<br />
Australia has provided a booklet which is a guide to where these<br />
sorts of services might best be assisted in Australia, or from Australia,<br />
but with a renewed emphasis on the need to preserve attractive<br />
coastal zone regions. I think it was in that vein that Prime Minister<br />
Hilly made his announcement about the Marovo Lagoon, which is, of<br />
course, one of the most attractive regions of the whole Pacific. And, I </p>
<p>3<br />
think it bodes well for the understanding which leaders have, of the<br />
need to protect important parts of the environment<br />
So, could I just sum up by saying that I think its been a very<br />
productive day. Coming to conclusions about such things as<br />
fisheries, the need to lift national income from them, airlines, the need<br />
to reduce the call on national budgets, forestry the need to, again,<br />
lift national Income and take steps to prevent unsustainable rates of<br />
logging was. I think a very good and important outcome of the<br />
meeting. And. of course, we will go into formal session tomorrow.<br />
J: Prime Minister, Chris Hammer from SBS television, this new fishing<br />
arrangement, could that be described in any way as a cartel<br />
arrangement?<br />
P: No. I think that it is important for wealthy nations like Japan and<br />
South Korea to understand that they can't secure valuable resources<br />
at sub-economic rates of return. And, what the existing arrangements<br />
have shown is there has been a considerable exploitation of Pacific<br />
Island countries, under-reporting of captures, insufficient monitoring<br />
the multilateral nature Is not simply for any negotiation. But, rather,<br />
also to look at fish stocks, the prospects for aquaculture in adding to<br />
fish stocks and. also, better monitoring and better reporting so that<br />
these small states can get a better return from their valuable, and one<br />
of their few, natural resources.<br />
J: Mr Keating, lan McPhredran from the Canberra Times. I'm wondering<br />
if you expect any sort of a backlash from Malaysia on the issue of<br />
environmental, combating environmental piracy, and will you be<br />
raising that matter with Dr Mahatir or President 8uharto in the future?<br />
P: I haven't mentioned Malaysia but I've just said that I think the<br />
important thing is, that, again, Pacific Island companies are not<br />
exploited by unscrupulous companies who then, not only pay<br />
inadequate rates of return but also carry out logging practices which<br />
would not be tolerated in a developed forestry culture. Now, I think<br />
that, an understanding by wealthier countries who use these<br />
resources and who exploit them, of the smaller countries, is<br />
important And, whether, at the moment, of course, many of these<br />
companies are Malaysian companies and Korean companies and<br />
also some Indonesian companies. But, whoever the companies<br />
belong to, I think that they should be encouraged to be good<br />
corporate citizens, to not see an opportunity for exploitation arise and<br />
then take It to the full. At any rate, the national governments involved<br />
here are concerned about rates of exploitation and modalities of<br />
forestry and are obviously taking rdmedlal steps to change it<br />
J: Kelinga Seneviratne from IPS Newsagency. </p>
<p>PM: Where are you from?<br />
J: IPS Newsagency. Australia has been very strong on asking the<br />
Pacific Island nations to restrict logging because of its environmental<br />
impact. Now, also, now some of the foreign countries are going to be<br />
wiped out from the map in a couple of generations because of the<br />
greenhouse emissions and rising sea levels. As the Chairman of the<br />
Forum and also as Australia is one of the major users and supporters<br />
of coal, for example, would you, Australia, be willing to take the<br />
initiative at this Forum to offer restricting mining and export of coal<br />
and if not would Australia also be willing to consider opening up the<br />
borders for environmental refugees from the South Pacific?<br />
PM: Well, I don't tht~ s a very broad question. Lot me tell you this though,<br />
that Australia's interest in this matter is not so much protection<br />
against global warming. That is, the implication of your question is<br />
that the forestry, Australia's moves on forestry, are self interested<br />
ones which go to the international environment in which it lives. Well,<br />
this is not so. I mean, that is a natural interest, but the predominant<br />
interest is seeing a sustainable rate of exploitation of forests in the<br />
Pacific Island countries, because at the current rate of exploitation<br />
these reserves are going to go. But not only are they going to go, but<br />
in the doing of it the exposure to high rainfall of the resuling terrain<br />
will mean that a lot of the topsoil will end up in coastal waters and in<br />
lagoons and in reefs, and affect the fishing stocks as well. I think that<br />
Australia's interest in this Is to see that a. that there is a sustainable<br />
basis for alogging; b. that the environmental despoilatlon is one<br />
which is contained and manageable, and c. that national incomes are<br />
rising. We are not doing this because of what one may see as some<br />
threat to Australa in global environment terms. Now, the subject of<br />
our greenhouse gas emissions and water levels is a subject way<br />
beyond the capacity for me to detail at a press conference like this<br />
and involves, of course, commitments by other countries and the<br />
whole progress of international climate change conventions and the<br />
commitment to those conventions by the major developed countries.<br />
J Craig Skehan, from AAP. To what extent do you accept that<br />
corruption by some Islands' officials and politicians has been a large<br />
contributing factor to unsustainable agreements in resource areas<br />
such as forestry. Was that discussed today at the retreat and, what<br />
measures could be taken at the regional level to deal with corrupt<br />
practices in resource areas?<br />
PM: Well it was discussed today, but I couldn't say to what extent. That is<br />
a cause of the rates of exploitation and modes of exploitation on now.<br />
I think a lot of it is, perhaps a lack of comprehensive understanding of<br />
the impacts of the agreement of logging licenses and exploitation<br />
rates, which may seem feasible at the early stages of the exploitation<br />
of a forest, but then seem more worrying later. I think that's what has </p>
<p>happened now, and given the fact that at least two of the island<br />
states have now taken action to introduce moratoriums on further<br />
exploitation in certain regions and articulated a willingness to<br />
renegotiate licences, I think gives an indication that whatever is the<br />
reason for the permissible exploitation as to date, thats now being<br />
reviewed. In the case of Papua New Guinea, of course, Papua New<br />
Guinea is a much larger country with a much deeper resource base<br />
and a multi faceted resource base and has much more of a capacity<br />
therefore to be able to make judgements or professionally manage<br />
the development of resources and to deal with the more predatory<br />
behaviour of particular resource exploitation companies.<br />
1: Victor del Rio from Eco Television in Latin America. Mr Keating,<br />
about three months ago I attended a conference in which they were<br />
inviting mining companies, Australian mining companies to invest in<br />
Latin America, and during the conference they said that Latin<br />
America was surprised because of the few restrictions that the<br />
environmret using another task force. Is Australia willing to put<br />
some kind of code of ethics to the Australian companies, when they<br />
are investing in regions like Latin America to stop this practice of<br />
using the in Latin America?<br />
PM: Well, I am not aware of where one may say Australian companies<br />
have, as a class of investors, exploited regions. They will certainly<br />
exploit mineral and other opportunities in various parts of the world,<br />
but. I should hope their international corporate citizenship and their<br />
regard for the interest of other co untries and their communities is as<br />
high as their regard in Australia. Thaes not to say that any realm of<br />
commerce unfettered, and certainly unfettered by commitments of a<br />
company to best practice in, particulary in resource exploitation,<br />
won't be important So at this stage, I don't think we have seen the<br />
case for Australia needing to say to its corporations that there should<br />
be a code of conduct under which they observe, but I don't think youll<br />
find an example of an Australian company that's involved In the<br />
wholesale exploitation on an unsustainable basis and despoilation<br />
that cause concern in this context Now, I mean, I'm sure all<br />
companies around the world can be better corporate citizens and you<br />
can take environmental concerns to the nth degree. It all a matter of<br />
what the, proponents are prepared to do, what the licensing authority<br />
wishes, and in that case it's mostly national governments, what their<br />
concerns are. By and large, I think it's fair to say, Australian<br />
companies will take heed of concerns expressed by national<br />
authorities about particularly large extracting developments. I mean, I<br />
wouldn't think, -in fat I know of no Australian company, certainly a<br />
major one, involved in wholesale exploitation and under reporting of<br />
Income, and that's one of the problems here. </p>
<p>J: Janice.. from Radio New Zealand. Mr Keating, the decisions on the<br />
airlines today, wilt this, do you expect closure of some national flag<br />
carrying airlines?<br />
PM: Well, I think it means that there is a willingness on the part of the<br />
leaders to think about ways in which, I mean, let me put it this way,<br />
what they are interested in is air services. not airline ownership<br />
necessarily. They ame interested in the provision of air services and<br />
air services at an effective and efficient pricing. Now, whether that<br />
can be done, by, if you like, Pacific sub-regional carriers who service<br />
a region of the Pacific including those places which will always<br />
remnain sub-economic, or whether in fact this will need to be carried<br />
on National budgets, is a moot point. Thats the point that needs to<br />
be, that will be examined. I mean, I think what may arise, is tat, sub-<br />
Pacific carriers could service a region and even so * inso me areas it<br />
will be completely commercial, in others it will be sub-economic, but<br />
not requiring the subsidies of the magnitude they require now. So it is<br />
that willingness to look at multi-lateral, multi-lateral regional solutions,<br />
and the drain on budgets which, I think, is causing leaders to<br />
consider such an outcome, such an approach.<br />
J: Richard Breeze from APP. Very simple question, you mentioned that<br />
the combined losses of these airlines equalled the aid given by<br />
Australia and New Zealand. Would you care to point out an<br />
Australian dollar figure on that?<br />
PM: Its around about $ 100 million or thereabouts. That is the combined<br />
operating losses of the eleven airlines, which is around about, a bit<br />
over $ 108 million dollars.<br />
J. 0 Mr Keating, Sid Mart, Brisbane Couriar Mil. How would the fishing<br />
contracts, the new multi-lateral fishing contracts be policed?<br />
PM: Well, already the Forum Fisheries Agency has the capacity for some<br />
monitoring facilities and as you know that one of the reasons why<br />
Australia has developed a Pacific patrol boat program Is for policing<br />
of maritime areas and maritime boundaries. But again, one of the<br />
things that the review can address is how there can be better<br />
monitoring and policing, and of course, with better income, all this<br />
becomes more possible. I mean the fact is, I think many countries are<br />
not receivng adequate returns and therefore, of course, diminish any<br />
on budget costs for surveillance et cetera, a more mature structure<br />
allows for that and I think that's the point<br />
J: I'm Gladis Nofkn from the National ( inaudible) Mr Keating, the<br />
FINKS delegation to the Forum were, yesterday, prevented from<br />
attending the opening. Is there any reason why, and also what is the<br />
Forumn stand on the FINKS issue push for self determination? </p>
<p>7<br />
PM; Well, that' not being dlsoussed today, I can only say that well, the<br />
reason they did not attend Is because they are not members, that's<br />
the reaso, and, but again, there-Is a dlose, a relatively close<br />
association between Forum members and ema organisation, and of<br />
course, that will be seen tonight, at tonight's dinner whli is being<br />
hold, and wich Forum representatives will be attending.<br />
J: Mr Keating, Susie Grey from Fiji National Video Centre. I was just<br />
wondering if our Prime Minister, Mr Rabuka, sWoke to you about<br />
SPARTECA Is there is any possibility of. Australia following Now<br />
Zealand's example of a 6% reduction in rules of origin.<br />
PM: No. I haven't had 2 discujssion with the Prime Ministe on this<br />
occasion. I did at the last Forum, I think there has been soma talk<br />
between our countres over the course of the last yewr, and there was<br />
I think, some fear in Fiji that Australia was going to, if you like,<br />
toughen the conditions under SPARTECA of rules at origin. That is<br />
not so, but nor have we made them more conoesslonal. I mean rules<br />
of origin exst for apurpose. If goods are being made In terms of the<br />
rules in Fiji therm is not a problem in Australia.<br />
Mr Keating, do you have anything to say on Mr Dowr's comments<br />
today on Aboriginal health and your governmnenits record on that<br />
Issue?<br />
PM: well, ri just say this about Mr Downer, the thing Is that, the Liberal<br />
party has again, the Liberal party of Australia, the conservative party<br />
of Austraia has again demonstrated that it has no philosophy for<br />
office, It has no policy virtually on Australia's identity. ft claims to<br />
support the constitutional monarchy. it then says it's irrelevant and to<br />
be ignored. ft seeks to deny justice to indigenous Australians by<br />
saying it would overturn the histc Mabo agreement Wts not for<br />
Alexander Downer to say what Aboriginal people hold dear, and like<br />
most indigenous communities in the Pacific the spiritual link between<br />
Aboriginal people and Islander people and the land is a profound<br />
one. and the right to their traditional way of life and happines is tied<br />
up in their access to land. It is not simply about health and oducation.<br />
These are functional Issues whichi are dealt with under fuinctonal<br />
appropriations from the Commnwealth either through ATSIC or<br />
direcly. A reliance on health and eduction by Mr Downer is simply<br />
an obfuscation for a policy to try and remove the opportunity for<br />
indigenous Australians to have aoccss to land via Mabo. And, it<br />
means that Mr Downer is being run by the worst elements of<br />
consrvatve Australia and they, amongst other places reside in a<br />
very generous measure, of course, in the state of Western Australia.<br />
Sham an him, shame on him for contemplating it go much for Mr<br />
Downers fresh start.<br />
ends. </p>
