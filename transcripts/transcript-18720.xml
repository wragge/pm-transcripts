<p>The Gillard Government will make a $500,000 contribution to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation to assist with the preservation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial Site in Poland.</p>
<p>The Auschwitz concentration camp is an important place of reflection and memory. </p>
<p>It continues to serve as a solemn reminder of the terrible crimes perpetrated against millions of people during the Second World War.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Jewish Holocaust Centre in Melbourne, the Prime Minister said the ongoing preservation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau memorial site was an important way for future generations to remember the horrific events of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government is committed to supporting efforts that encourage education and understanding to ensure such atrocities are never repeated again.</p>
<p>Many Holocaust survivors, including from Germany, Austria, Poland and the then Czechoslovakia, found refuge in Australia and made it their home following the Second World War.</p>
<p>The resilience and courage of these survivors has contributed to Australia's vibrant multicultural society.</p>
<p>The Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation was established in 2009 by former Polish minister Wladyslaw Bartoszewski, a former prisoner of the Auschwitz Concentration Camp, to secure the preservation and conservation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial Site. </p>
