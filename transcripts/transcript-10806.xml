<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>Inaudible</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>I would imagine that given the great passion that Australians have for cricket there is an intense feeling of disappointment about the whole issue. Australians love their cricket and anything that looks as though it is knocking cricket off its pedestal is something that does deeply disturb Australians.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>Inaudible</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Well, I can only share what I know will be an intense feeling of disappointment. It’s clear with the benefit of hindsight that what Malcolm Speed has just said and that is that if the incident had been revealed at the time and the action taken at the time had been made known I think it would then have been seen in better perspective. And perhaps some of the connotations that are now being presented would not have been presented. These things are probably always best dealt with more openly and more candidly.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>Inaudible</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Well, the question of disciplining players in any sport is not something for day-to-day commentary from the Prime Minister, it is something for the relevant disciplinary tribunal in the game and that’s the Australian Cricket Board. I naturally am following this with interest because I love cricket as do millions of Australians. And these incidents only drive home how much we care about the game and how much we worry about the game’s reputation and its place in our national life.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>Inaudible</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no. I have spoken to the Chairman of the Cricket Board.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>Inaudible</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>No, I haven’t. I have spoken to the Chairman of the Cricket Board. I don’t spend my days in contact with cricketers much in all as on occasions I would find that appealing particularly as Christmas approaches and one’s mind inevitably turns to pleasant summer afternoons watching Test matches.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>Inaudible</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>I think the fact that people have reacted with a sense of disappointment does drive home the point that behaviour and demeanour in the game is still tremendously important. It’s not just a question of money, it’s also a question of behaviour. I think it’s important that that be said. They are both very fine players, there is no doubt about that. They are, in a sense, icons to young Australians, we all know that. I think they probably feel that fairly keenly now. I think we could all appreciate that.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>Inaudible</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Oh look, I am not going to set myself up as a judge of what they’ve said at their press conference. You ask me for comment as Prime Minister and as a great cricket lover but it’s not for me to pronounce a benediction on their behaviour and their conduct. That is for others to do and it is the responsibility of the Australian Cricket Board. I am reacting as a cricket loving Prime Minister and saying what I feel.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>Inaudible</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Well, I have no doubt that they’ll continue to contribute a great deal to the Australian cricket because they are both very fine players. Thank you.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>On another issue, can you tell us why you are not in Question Time…..</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>I am fulfilling an important family commitment and then I am going on to the President’s Cup dinner in Melbourne tonight.</p>
<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>Inaudible</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>No, we are all healthy but it is an important family commitment and it will be the first Question Time I have missed other than for an overseas trip since I have been Prime Minister. Thank you.</p>
