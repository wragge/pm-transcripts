    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today, I formally launch Japan's involvement in Australia's New Colombo Plan.</p>
<p>This important policy will foster closer ties between Australia and our region and develop stronger people-to-people and institutional links.</p>
<p>I am pleased that Japan, as a participant in this pilot phase â along with Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia â has shown such strong support for the New Colombo Plan. This will encourage increasing numbers of young Australians to study and gain career experience in Japan.</p>
<p>Australia is the most popular destination for Japanese school tours. The New Colombo Plan will enhance two-way mobility between our higher education sectors.</p>
<p>The story of the original Colombo Plan is remarkable. Some 40,000 future leaders came to our country from the 1950s to the mid-1980s and many of the changes that we have seen in our region over the decades have been influenced by those who â returning from this country â helped to lead others.</p>
<p>Our New Colombo Plan will be different and better than the original, adding an outward-bound component to the original one-way street.</p>
<p>Over time, this will be a true two-way New Colombo Plan which takes Australian university students to Asian universities to learn more about our region and brings the best and brightest talent from the region to Australia.</p>
<p>Australia has much to offer the world; but much to learn, as well â especially from Asia. </p>
<p>I am pleased to launch this first pilot phase of Japan's involvement in the New Colombo Plan, which complements Prime Minister Abe's ambition to double the number of Japanese students studying abroad.Â </p>
