    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was saddened to hear of the death yesterday of the Chief Police Officer of the ACT, Audrey Fagan APM.  </p>
<p>Assistant Commissioner Fagan was a respected police officer.  She made an exceptional contribution to the Australian Federal Police and to both the Federal and ACT governments.</p>
<p>Her leadership through the aftermath of the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States and contribution to the National Counter Terrorism Committee was first class.</p>
<p>She also worked as an AFP Liaison Officer in the offices of Attorney-General and Minister for Justice the Hon Daryl Williams AM QC MP and Senator the Hon Amanda Vanstone when she was Minister for Justice and Customs.</p>
<p>Ms Fagan's outstanding police skills were recognised when she was awarded the Australian Police Medal in 2004.  The citation for the medal noted her work in coordinating counter terrorism capabilities and her work enhancing and promoting the role of women in law enforcement.</p>
<p>Janette and I join the many Australians who knew and respected Ms Fagan in offering our sincere condolences to both Ms Fagan's family and to the Australian Federal Police.  </p>
