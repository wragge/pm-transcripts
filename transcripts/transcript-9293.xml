PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
THE COALITION'S CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM AGENDA<br />
It is littlo wondor thc Coailition heis split over its cobbled together<br />
Constitutional reform package.<br />
In their poll-driven haste to find an alternative to the Government's<br />
considered interest in Constitutional reform, the Liberals have come up with a<br />
mish-mash of measures, some of which nobody could accept not even the<br />
National Party.<br />
Over the past 48 hours we've seen Mr Reith isolated as the only supporter of<br />
Citizen Initiated Referenda described by National Party Leader, Tim<br />
Fischer, as " law-making cancer."<br />
Mr Downer a born-again Constitutional reformer has walked away from<br />
Mr Reith on CIR, after originally countenancing the idea.<br />
Mr Downer reportedly continues to support a range of measures, none of<br />
which addresses the principal flaw in the Constitution that our Head of<br />
State is not an Australian.<br />
So the Opposition's approach to Constitutional reform seems to be that if the<br />
Government has an agenda, they had better have one too never mind if it<br />
is a zany and untenable one.<br />
Just when it looked like the Opposition had finally come up with a policy<br />
the first since the arrival of the " new" leadership team it turns out to be a<br />
divisive and untenable pot pourri.<br />
