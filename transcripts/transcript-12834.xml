I am pleased to announce the list of Tasmanians to be awarded the Centenary Medal. His Excellency the Honourable Sir Guy Green AC KBE, Governor of Tasmania has indicated that he will present the medals to the Tasmanian recipients at functions to be held at Government House, Hobart in the New Year.<br />
The Centenary Medal was announced on 28 December 2001 to recognise Australians born in 1901 or earlier who were alive on 1 January 2001 (“Centenarians”).  In addition, the Federal, State and Territory Governments were invited to nominate persons for recognition in the General List of the Medal that have a made a contribution to Australian society or government.  The contribution may have been in a community, region, or particular activity or profession.<br />
The independent Council for the Centenary Medal comprising   Professor Geoffrey Blainey AC, Mr Rodney Cavalier,   Dr Margaret Valadian AO MBE, Mrs Marjorie Turbayne OAM and Ms Lisa Curry-Kenny MBE OAM has now completed the task of assessing nominations for the Medal and has finalised its report.  I would like to thank the Council members and the Commonwealth, State and Territory officials who assisted them for the considerable task they have undertaken.<br />
A schedule of the names of the Tasmanian recipients of the Centenary Medal is attached and is shown on the website <a href="http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au">www.itsanhonour.gov.au</a>.<br />
I have been advised that some states will not hold Vice-Regal ceremonies to honour their recipients. Once alternative arrangements have been finalised, the names of recipients in other states will be made available in the coming year.<br />
On behalf of the government I extend congratulations to all Tasmanian recipients of the Centenary Medal.</p>
