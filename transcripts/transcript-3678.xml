1, AU STHA LI/ A~<br />
PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 483<br />
4 April 1975<br />
VIETNAM ORPHANS<br />
The Australian Government has chartered a<br />
Qantas 747 jet to help in the evacuation of Vietnamese<br />
children destined for adoption by Australian parents, the<br />
Prime Minister announced in Townsville today.<br />
Mr Whitlam said the aircraft would leave<br />
Sydney at 4: 00 p. m. today for Bangkok carrying three doctors<br />
and twenty nurses to look after the orphans on their flight<br />
to Australia. It will also carry twenty-five tonnes of supplies<br />
for emergency relief in Vietnam for humanitarian purposes<br />
including rice, milk powder and corned beef.<br />
Mr W. Morrison, the minister assisting the<br />
Foreign Minister, will fly with the relief team to<br />
supervise the evacuation and report directly to the Prime<br />
Minister. The team will have as its medical director, Dr.<br />
W Langsford, First Assistant Director-General of the<br />
Public Health Division of the Australian Department of<br />
Health. The aircraft will wait in Bangkok to receive<br />
children being flown out of Saigon by RAAF Hercules<br />
aircraft. It will also bring back to Australia dependents and<br />
non-essential personnel being evacuated by the Australian<br />
Embassy in Saigon. The children will leave Saigon as soon as<br />
possible. So far three Premiers, Mr Dunstan, Mr Hamer and<br />
Mr Bjelke-Petersen, have responded to the Prime Minister's<br />
message to State Premiers last night seeking guarantees about<br />
the care of the children brought i~ nto Australia and their<br />
agreement to the waiving of usual formalities.<br />
Some delays are being experienced in Saigon in<br />
preparing the children for departure, but the Australian<br />
Embassy is working to overcome these and hopes the airlift<br />
of the children will be well underway tomorrow.<br />

/ ATTAkC.-LMENT: Premiers' Replies on Vietnam Orphans<br />
Mr Dunstan's reply states:<br />
" South Australia gives the underaking<br />
and agreements sought in your message tonight and we will<br />
make the arramgements you ask."<br />
Mr Hamer' s reply reads as follows:<br />
" I refer to your telegram of last night concerning<br />
the adoption of Vietnamese orphans. You have my assurance<br />
that we will receive orphans up to the number for whom<br />
there are approved families and that we will provide<br />
accommodation and care in the no ' rm-al way for those<br />
children amongst these orphans who are not eventaully<br />
chosen for adoption because of their medical or physical<br />
condition. Our Department of Social Welfare will maintain<br />
close and continuous liason with your Department of Labor<br />
and Immigration as requested. We would appreciate advice<br />
as early as possible of prospective numbers of children<br />
arriving in the next few days so that appropriate<br />
reception arrangements can be made. I have arranged for<br />
the Department of Social Welfare to send separate advice<br />
to your Department of Labor and Ihmigration about reception,<br />
placement, and ongoing care for these children."'<br />
Mr Bjelke-Petersen's reply reads as follows:<br />
Reference your telex re adoption of<br />
Vietnamese orphans by Queensland parents. Our Department<br />
of Children's Services is presently processing well<br />
over 2O0applications for such adoptions and is giving<br />
very* urgent priority to them. While it is anticipated<br />
further applications will be received I must emphasise<br />
that not every such application is necessarily from<br />
suitable adoptive parents and must be examined<br />
accord~ ingly. As always, the future welfare of the<br />
child concerned must remain the department's paramount<br />
consideration. In accordance with your request I<br />
confirm that my Government would be prepared to accept<br />
without the normal medical check any number of such<br />
children -up to the figure of 200 mentioned above.<br />
You may also be assured that the Department of Children's<br />
Services will maintain the closest liason with the<br />
Department of Labor and Immigration here." </p>
