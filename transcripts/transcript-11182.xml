    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Good morning sir.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>How are you Jeremy. Nice to be with you again.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>What is this business about you taking to the air on New Year's</p>
<p> Eve to settle us all down about the millenium bug? Are you serious?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well somebody asked me a question. I got an invitation from Richard</p>
<p> Alston would I do so. And I answered affirmatively. I don't know</p>
<p> whether he's got anything in mind. I don't have any particular</p>
<p> plan but obviously....let me put it this way, I certainly won't</p>
<p> be making plans to avoid travelling on New Year's Eve although</p>
<p> normally I don't. I normally spend New Year's Eve with my</p>
<p> family. But I did indicate that if I were invited I would do so.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>I wouldn't have thought it a wise career move.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Gee, you don't have much faith in the system.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>I guess that's true. You say that this referendum on the republic</p>
<p> might not be the last say. Why? Why not just have the referendum.</p>
<p> It won't succeed and then we can put all this nonsense to bed.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Jeremy, you know my position. I'm not in favour of change</p>
<p> but I was simply saying yesterday what was an obvious truth and that</p>
<p> is there's nothing to stop, if one referendum fails, there's</p>
<p> nothing to stop another one being put some time in the future. I'm</p>
<p> not saying that I'm advocating it. I'm not saying that I've</p>
<p> got any plan in mind to have a series of referendums. I was merely</p>
<p> answering a question. There is nothing to stop another referendum</p>
<p> being held if this one doesn't produce a result which a majority</p>
<p> of Australians some time in the future want. I mean it's all</p>
<p> I'm saying because under our Constitution you can have referenda</p>
<p> as often as you like. But it is the case that Australians don't</p>
<p> like having too many referenda and if this one is defeated my anticipation</p>
<p> is that it will be some years before another one is held but there's</p>
<p> nothing to stop another one being held. But equally it may not be</p>
<p> held for some time in the future. I think too much has been made of</p>
<p> what I said. I was merely stating the Constitutional position. Unfortunately</p>
<p> anything that I say on this issue is seized upon by those who have</p>
<p> an opposite view than I have on the Constitution as some kind of dark</p>
<p> plot to influence the result. Now everybody knows my position. I will</p>
<p> be voting no' in November, and I will be voting yes'</p>
<p> in favour of the new preamble which I began discussing yesterday with</p>
<p> Les Murray, Australia's most eminent poet. Now that's my</p>
<p> position. Everybody knows it and people shouldn't try and read</p>
<p> something sinister into what I said yesterday. If people want a republic</p>
<p> according to the model put forward by the convention they should vote</p>
<p> yes' in November. If they either don't want a republic</p>
<p> or they don't want a republic in that form well presumably they</p>
<p> will vote no'. If the referendum is carried we'll</p>
<p> become a republic on the 1st of January in the year 2001,</p>
<p> the centenary of federation, and that is an entirely appropriate date.</p>
<p> If there is a no' vote well as far as I'm concerned</p>
<p> it's off the agenda for some time. I wouldn't be seeking</p>
<p> to bring it back in the foreseeable future but somebody else in the</p>
<p> foreseeable future may. That's the point I was simply making</p>
<p> and there's nothing strange about that. And people should not</p>
<p> read some kind of sinister, devious, machiavellian plot on my part</p>
<p> into it.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well as you've steadfastly refused and I think you're right,</p>
<p> to say sorry. Now I see this morning that there is some talk about</p>
<p> a declaration of reconciliation which means we would profoundly regret</p>
<p> injustices of the past if we got an apology or we got forgiveness</p>
<p> from Aboriginal people. Is this up and running or....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that document that was in the paper this morning appears to be</p>
<p> the first draft of the Council for Reconciliation's declaration.</p>
<p> Obviously somebody has decided to give it to the newspapers. The Chairman</p>
<p> of the council, Evelyn Scott, wrote to me earlier this week enclosing</p>
<p> that document and some other drafts and I've written back saying</p>
<p> thank you for the first draft, we'll have a look at them, there</p>
<p> are some things in it that the Government can agree to and there are</p>
<p> some things in all of the documents that we can't possibly agree</p>
<p> to and others we think could be better expressed. I want to be positive.</p>
<p> I would like to try and have a document of reconciliation. I don't</p>
<p> know whether it can be achieved and I hope the debate does not get</p>
<p> bogged down entirely on this issue of whether the present generation</p>
<p> assumes responsibility for the claimed misdeeds of earlier generations.</p>
<p> My reason is not that I don't as a human being feel profoundly</p>
<p> sorry for injustices carried out on any Australian in the past. I</p>
<p> do. But I have always taken the fairly simple view that the current....you</p>
<p> can only apologise for things that you yourself did wrong. And if</p>
<p> I have not been part of any wrong doing and if I'm not part of</p>
<p> a generation that's been part of that wrong doing I've always</p>
<p> had a difficulty in assuming responsibility for the claimed wrong-doings</p>
<p> of earlier generations, particularly when those acts were sanctioned</p>
<p> by the law of the country at the time and in many cases the people</p>
<p> involved in them believed that they were doing the right thing. Now</p>
<p> there's a court case going on at the moment and I don't</p>
<p> want to talk about the particulars of that, it would be improper to</p>
<p> do so, however it's quite plain from other evidence that's</p>
<p> been given on this issue that not everybody who was involved in these</p>
<p> practices did it out of ill will. In fact most of the people did it</p>
<p> with great good will. And while now we don't agree with the practices</p>
<p> and wonder why they happened, at the time the community sanctioned</p>
<p> them and they thought they were doing the right thing.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Sure sure. Malcolm Stewart talking with Derryn Hinch this morning</p>
<p> says that British athletes may boycott the Olympic Games if they feel</p>
<p> the Queen has been insulted and snubbed by you opening the Olympic</p>
<p> Games rather than she.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well who's Malcolm Stewart?</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Malcolm Stewart's a correspondent in London.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, well I don't really care what Malcolm Stewart thinks on</p>
<p> this with great respect to him. Let me make a prediction. There will</p>
<p> be a very large British team here.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Are you familiar with the Parliamentary Member, Gerald Kaufman in</p>
<p> the UK?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I've heard of him yes.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>A British Member of Parliament said the International Olympic Committee</p>
<p> would violate its own charter if Queen Elizabeth doesn't open</p>
<p> the 2000 Olympics. What do you think of that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm indifferent to his view. The Queen of Australia acts</p>
<p> on the advice of her Australian Ministers. Not on the advice of Mr</p>
<p> Kaufman or indeed anybody else. I don't think there's any</p>
<p> violation of anything involved. I indicated when I was the Shadow</p>
<p> Minister for Industrial Relations in the Opposition, when our party</p>
<p> was led by John Hewson and Paul Keating was the Prime Minister of</p>
<p> Australia, that I though the Prime Minister of the day should open</p>
<p> the Olympic Games. I haven's sort of set this up to suit my own</p>
<p> position. I just think it's appropriate that the Prime Minister</p>
<p> of the day should open the Olympic Games. Now that's been my</p>
<p> view. It's not being disrespectful to anybody. I'm in fact</p>
<p> in favour of the present Constitutional arrangements. I don't</p>
<p> go out to offend the Queen or indeed anybody else but I just think</p>
<p> it's appropriate that the Australian Prime Minister of the day</p>
<p> open the Games. Now, as I say, I arrived at that position long before</p>
<p> I was either the Leader of the Opposition or, indeed, the Prime Minister.</p>
<p> I was, in fact, in effect advocating that as things then stood that</p>
<p> Paul Keating should open the Games because he was the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>There's a meeting in Sydney of financial gurus to discuss the</p>
<p> Asian crisis today. As far as our economy is concerned I guess really,</p>
<p> apart from the record deficit, it really wouldn't get much better</p>
<p> than this, would it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's very strong, Jeremy. And even the current account</p>
<p> deficit is only a record in dollar terms. As a percentage of our national</p>
<p> wealth each year it's not a record. And our capacity to pay for</p>
<p> it is better now than it's been for 15 years. In other words,</p>
<p> we are borrowing a lot of money abroad to finance that deficit but</p>
<p> our capacity to repay that money is better than it's been for</p>
<p> 15 years. So, even that should be put into perspective. But our economy</p>
<p> is very strong indeed. It is the envy of many other nations. It's</p>
<p> stronger than most thought it would be and the fundamentals are very</p>
<p> good. And I think the Australian community deserves thanks for the</p>
<p> way in which it's worked hard and effectively because it's</p>
<p> wage and salary earners and Australian businessmen and women that</p>
<p> have really made this strong economy. Governments can provide the</p>
<p> framework but it's the people who deliver the goods. And I want</p>
<p> to thank the people of Australia for the contribution that they've</p>
<p> collectively made to delivering such a strong economy that all of</p>
<p> us can be very proud of. And our exporters have responded magnificently</p>
<p> to what has happened in the Asian Pacific region. And through a flexible</p>
<p> exchange rate we've shifted our exports to other destinations.</p>
<p> Now, we need to press on. We shouldn't get complacent. We need</p>
<p> to continue reform. We need a new tax system. We need to further reform</p>
<p> our industrial relations system. And we have to keep working on innovative</p>
<p> ways of further reducing unemployment, which although at an eight</p>
<p> or nine year low is still far too high.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>There are some worrying signs coming out of China, which up until</p>
<p> now seems to have been pretty well unscathed, do you think as far</p>
<p> as Australia is concerned we are well and truly out of the woods?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we are through the worst of the Asian economic downturn. I can't</p>
<p> guarantee that we'll continue unhindered, uninterrupted, indefinitely,</p>
<p> no Prime Minister can do that. But we are through the worst of the</p>
<p> Asian downturn. And for so long as the United States' economy</p>
<p> remains very strong and the European economies remain as they are</p>
<p> reasonably strong then there ought to be no new shocks around the</p>
<p> corner from the rest of the world because we have lived for some years</p>
<p> now with a depressed Asian economy and, particularly, a very sluggish</p>
<p> Japanese economy. The American economic strength is very important</p>
<p> to us and to the rest of the world and the signs are that that will</p>
<p> still remain very strong. But you've got to remember that if</p>
<p> you're running growth at 4.7%, which we are at the moment, even</p>
<p> if that were to come off a bit down to something in the threes, we</p>
<p> would still be doing extremely well, extremely well.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>I think the Australian public would thank you. I don't know how</p>
<p> you could sort of test this but my gut feeling is that the Australian</p>
<p> people are grateful for your stand on this heroin debate where you</p>
<p> refuse to submit to the pressure which is all around you to have some</p>
<p> sort of heroin trial.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Jeremy, I hope they do because my stand is sincerely meant.</p>
<p> There are a lot of things in relation to drugs where I believe I have</p>
<p> common cause with State Premiers on both sides of politics. We all</p>
<p> want more law enforcement measures and we've put more money into</p>
<p> that. We all want more education for children against commencing the</p>
<p> drug habit. And we all want more resources put into treatment. So,</p>
<p> as to about ninety-five per cent of the debate I think there's</p>
<p> common ground. Unfortunately there's a huge focus on this question</p>
<p> of a heroin trial because it's an easy thing to report and it's</p>
<p> an easy thing for people to get emotional about. There is no evidence</p>
<p> of any successful trial, hard evidence of any successful trial, anywhere</p>
<p> in the world. Only this morning, before this programme, I read some</p>
<p> fresh material about the trial in Switzerland and that indicated that</p>
<p> the results coming out of that were, at very best equivocal, and on</p>
<p> a more negative construction, close to a failure. Now, it still goes</p>
<p> on but there's no clear evidence around the world that this thing</p>
<p> works and it just really does send, in my view, the wrong signal.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well, it defies logic.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>If you're an alcoholic, you don't kick your habit by being</p>
<p> given free alcohol.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is a very good way of putting it. And you cannot simultaneously</p>
<p> say to somebody - this is a very bad thing, don't start it, the</p>
<p> substance will destroy your life...</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...but you also say to them, but hang on, if you do start it, we</p>
<p> will provide an environment in which you can continue it if you're</p>
<p> unable to break the habit. Now, I can only imagine, as you can, how</p>
<p> difficult it must be for people to break addictive habits. But unfortunately</p>
<p> life is full of difficult situations for people. All sorts of circumstances</p>
<p> are difficult. And this idea that if people are hooked on it it is</p>
<p> some way implicitly acceptable that, you know, they not be continually</p>
<p> encouraged to the maximum extent to break the habit, I think, is quite</p>
<p> unrealistic.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>The extraordinary thing is that in all the reports  I've</p>
<p> seen that report you referred to this morning  they talk about</p>
<p> the affect on crime. So if you give somebody free heroin he won't</p>
<p> break in and steal your video tape recorder. But it fails to report</p>
<p> that it does nothing to get people off heroin. It just contains the</p>
<p> problem and, inadvertently, promotes the problem.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It does that and, of course, it also raises a whole lot of practical</p>
<p> questions. My understanding is that if somebody were on a heroin trial</p>
<p> they would require dosages of three, four, five, six a day. Now, you</p>
<p> just think about it. Unless people are, in effect, to go to a centre</p>
<p> that number of times a day or stay permanently in a centre, which</p>
<p> either of which options would involve a lot of resources, pressure</p>
<p> might then arise for them to be able to pick up the supplies of heroin</p>
<p> and take it with them. Now, that could open up all sorts of possibilities.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Jeff Kennett's saying that he's going to go it alone, what</p>
<p> would you say to that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm not sure that he has said that. People have reported</p>
<p> that he's said that. They're having a meeting today and</p>
<p> I expect that there will be a lot out of that meeting that I can support.</p>
<p> And I certainly want to work with the Premiers. I had a talk with</p>
<p> Mr Olsen about the issue, very briefly, in Adelaide earlier this week.</p>
<p> I want to co-operate with Mr Carr, the Labor Premier of New South</p>
<p> Wales and, indeed, with Kerry Chikarovski, if she replaces him later</p>
<p> this month. I'm not interested in political differences on this.</p>
<p> I just want to get a good outcome. But my understanding, Jeremy, is</p>
<p> that you can't have a heroin trial anywhere in Australia without</p>
<p> the Federal Government amending the Federal Narcotics Legislation</p>
<p> to permit the importation of pharmaceutical grade heroin. Under the</p>
<p> current Federal law such importation is illegal and the law would</p>
<p> have to be amended to allow it. Now, that's my understanding</p>
<p> and that is the basis of people constantly saying, well the Federal</p>
<p> Government has vetoed it. Well, we won't change that law. Now,</p>
<p> obviously if people believe they can do things notwithstanding that</p>
<p> law, well, I guess they will endeavour to do that. But that is my</p>
<p> understanding and I think my advice is right.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Would you consider introducing draconian penalties to be applied to</p>
<p> drug pushers, convicted people who push this wretched stuff?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there are very heavy penalties at the moment but most of that</p>
<p> is dealt with by State law.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>You see the problem with that is that you see these television reports</p>
<p> with people on the platform at Cabramatta and people in Redfern quite</p>
<p> openly selling heroin. They are obviously not frightened of being</p>
<p> caught.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is perplexing, although, in fairness to the police who</p>
<p> have a very difficult job, we do seem to be having more success recently.</p>
<p> But predominantly the police effort against drug pushers is a State</p>
<p> responsibility. I don't say that to shift the load or the blame</p>
<p> in any way but that's just the way our system operates. We have</p>
<p> Federal Police who, of course, are involved with our customs service</p>
<p> in stopping it if it comes into this country but once it's here</p>
<p> the actual selling of it to people is a breach of State law and attracts</p>
<p> very heavy State penalties. And I have no sympathy, nobody has any</p>
<p> sympathy, with drug pushers. They are the scum of the earth.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, could I get a quick comment from you on this, what</p>
<p> appears to be, shift of focus in defence policy where we would be</p>
<p> concentrating more on overseas expeditionary forces. I see that former</p>
<p> Defence Secretary, Alan Wrigley, he rejects the move to overseas involvement</p>
<p> as a strategy. He says it doesn't work, it's too expensive</p>
<p> and it should be scrapped.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I heard him on the radio this morning criticising it. What is</p>
<p> involved  and this is very much in the sort of exploratory stage</p>
<p> at the moment  what is involved, as I understand, is a recognition</p>
<p> that in future it is more likely that Australian military activity</p>
<p> will be involved in relatively small activities in other countries.</p>
<p> Now, I would have thought that's common sense. And, I mean, even</p>
<p> over the last few years we've been involved in quite a number</p>
<p> of peacekeeping roles. We did, of course, send some combat forces</p>
<p> in great combat readiness to the Gulf last year. They weren't</p>
<p> needed but they were nonetheless sent. I would have thought what is</p>
<p> being contemplated here is making sure that our military capacity</p>
<p> is geared in recognition that from time-to-time we may have to deploy</p>
<p> people in different parts of the world in relatively small numbers.</p>
<p> Now, it's not intended that we sort of permanently station people</p>
<p> overseas. I think, perhaps, there's been a misunderstanding or</p>
<p> a misinterpretation deliberately or otherwise of what's involved.</p>
<p> And I heard what Alan Riggley said this morning. I don't agree</p>
<p> with his criticisms of the Defence Force or the Defence Department's</p>
<p> culture. They have their own culture but that's not surprising.</p>
<p> They are a unique group of people. They are the only group of people</p>
<p> whose job it is to put their lives on the line for the rest of us</p>
<p> and that does make them, along with our police, it does put them in</p>
<p> a rather special category. It's hardly surprising, therefore,</p>
<p> they should develop a bit of a culture of their own. I don't</p>
<p> think there's anything wrong with that.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>You would have also heard this morning that Centrelink, apart from</p>
<p> their telephone gridlock, have got other problems like half a million</p>
<p> people have apparently been caught defrauding the system, yet only</p>
<p> less than one per cent of that half million have been prosecuted.</p>
<p> That doesn't really sort of add up, does it Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think it does. My understanding is that what happens is that</p>
<p> a lot of people who make errors, they make re</p>
