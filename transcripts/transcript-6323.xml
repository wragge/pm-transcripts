SPEECH BY PRIME MINISTER MiR HAWKE AT SINGAPORE/ AUSTRALIA<br />
BUSINESS COUNCIL BREAKFAST, 13 FEBRUARY, 1984<br />
MR CHAIRMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,<br />
I WAS VERY PLEASED TO ACCEPT YOUR INVITATXON TO JOIN YOU HERE<br />
TODAY DURING THIS MY FIRST VISIT TO SINGAPORE AS AUSTRAI. IA'S PRIME<br />
MINISIER. I AM, HOW.; EVER, NO STRANGER TO SINGAPORE LIKE MANY BEFORE<br />
ME I HAVe BEEN DEEPLY IMPRESEED BY SINGAPORE'S RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT.<br />
LEE KUAN YEW'S SINGAPORE DEMONSTRATES ALL THE QUALITIES OF A<br />
ROBUST, INDEPENDENT SOCIETY., HERE THERE IS A STRONG ENTERPRENEURIAL<br />
TRA, ITION GROUNDED IN A WELL-DEVELOPED WORK ETHIC. HERE THERE IS<br />
ALSO A DYNAMIC AND SUCCESSFUL ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT WHICH, THROUGH THE<br />
PRIORITY IT HAS GIVEN TO EDUCATION, LEARNING-AND SKILLS ACQUISITION,<br />
HAS ESTABLISHED A PARTICULAR CAPACITY TO ADAPT IN THE FACE OF<br />
CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES.<br />
SINGAPORE'S SUCCESS STEMS DIRECTLY FROM ITS ANTICIPATING THE<br />
DIRECTIONS OF ECONOMIC CHANGE . AND DEVELOPING AND ADAPTING STRATEGIES<br />
TO MEET THEM. SINGAPORE, IN SHORT, HAS SECURED ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF<br />
A FLEXIBLE, FAR-SIGHTED APPROACH TO DEVELOPMENT.<br />
IN DOING SO IT HAS MADE ITSELF INTO AN IMPORTANT FCCUS OF<br />
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WITHIN THE REGION.<br />
THIS GIVES SINGAPORE A PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE 1' 0 AUSTRALIA AND IS<br />
REFLECTED IN THE HEAVY CONCENTRATION OF AUSI'RALIAN COMMERCIAL AND<br />
BANKING INTERESTS IN THIS COUNTRY. IT ALSO HELPS EXPLAIN WHY A VERY<br />
SIGNIFICANT PART OF AUSTRALIA'S TOTAL TRADE WITH ASEAN IS WITH<br />
SINGAPORE. ACCORDINGLY MY GOVERNMENT'S INTEREST IN SEEING AUSTRALIA'S<br />
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ENMESHED MORE CLOSELY WITH THAT OF THE<br />
ASIA/ PACIFIC REGION FINDS A PARTICULAR POINT HERE IN SINGAPORE.<br />
HERE AS MUCH AS ANYWHERE WE SEE A DEDICATED INTEREST ON THE PART<br />
OF BOTH AUSTRALIANS AND SINGAPOREAN IN MAXIISING THE BENEFITS TO BE<br />
DERIVED FROM TH4E PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF CLOSER ECONOMIC RELATIONS<br />
BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES.<br />
ANY ASSESSMENT OF THE POTENTIAL OF TH4IS INVOLVEMENT WITH EACH<br />
OTHER, MUST BEGIN WITH4 AN APPRECIATION OF CONiEMPORARY ECONOMIC<br />
CONDITIONS AND LONG-TERM PROSPECTS IN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. LET ME<br />
CONCENTRATE MY IMMEDIATE REMARKS ON THE AUSTRALIAN SITUATION. </p>
<p>MY GOVERNMENT, ON COMING TO OFFICE lN MARCH LAST YEAR, HAD TO<br />
DEAL WITH A SHARI), DEEP RECESSION: EMPLOYMENT HAD DECLINED<br />
DISASITROULSY AND UNEMPLOYMENT RISEN. INFLATION STOOD AT TWICE THE<br />
RATE OF MOST MAJOR OECD COUNTRIES.<br />
WE GAVE TOP PRIORITY TO TURNING THIS SITUATION AROUND AND IN<br />
VERY CONSIDERABLE MEASURE -HAVE SUCCEEDED.<br />
BY THE SEPTEMBER QUARTER LAST YEAR, HELPED BY THE BREAKING OF<br />
THE DROUGHT, SIGNS OF A STRONG RECOVLRY W4ERE EMERGING.<br />
REAL GROWTH IN THAT QUARTER WAS OVER 4 PER CENT.<br />
A WIDE RANGE OF INDICATORS, SUCH AS IN HOUSING AND THE kETAIL<br />
TRADE FOR EXAMPLE, POINT TO STRONG GROWTH SINCE THEN.<br />
BETWEEN APRIL AND THE END OF JANUARY THIS YEAR JOBS EXPANDED BY<br />
OVER 2 PER CENT BY 134,000 NEW JOBS) AND SEASONALLY ADJUSTED<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT FELL FROM 10. 3 PER CENT TO 9. 5 PER CENT. TH4ESE FIGURES I<br />
MIGHT NOTE INCLUDE DISAPPOINTIN4G RESULTS FOR JANUARY BUT ARE<br />
NEVERTHELESS STILL VERY MUCH STRONGER THAN W AS ANTICIPATED BY ALL<br />
OBSERVERS AT THE TIME WE BROUGHT DOWN THE BUDGET IN BUDGET IN AUGUST<br />
LAST YEAR. INFLATION IN THE SAVE PERIOD W4AS BROUGHT DOWN FROM OVER 11<br />
PER CENT TO 8.6 PER CENT.<br />
LOOKING AHEAD WE EXPECT REAL GDP GROWTH OF AROUND 8 PER CENT IN<br />
THE COURSE OF THE CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR ( JUNE QUARTER ON JUNE<br />
QUARTER) AND CON4TINUED STRON GROWTH INTO 1934-85.<br />
CRUCIAL TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THIS RECOVERY INTO THE MEDIUM AND<br />
LONGER TERM WILL BE CONTINUED INCOMES RESIRAJNT. LAST YEAR<br />
AUSTRALIAN WORKERS RECEIVED A WAGE INCREASE OF 4.3 PER CENT, THIS<br />
YEAR THE INCREASES ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER.<br />
RESTRAINT OF THIS KIND HAS BEEN ACHIEVED WITHIN THE FRAM4EWORK OF<br />
THE PRICES AND INCOMES-ACCORD AGREED BETHEEN THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR<br />
PARTY AND THE AUSTRALIA N COUNCIL OF TRADE UNIONS AND PUT INTO EFFECT<br />
BY MY GOVERNMENT.<br />
AT THE HEART OF THE ACCORD HAS BEEN THE SEARC: H FOR COMMUNITY<br />
CONSENSUS AND A MORE CO-OPERATIVE. LESS COMBATIVE MEANS OF<br />
DETERMINING WAGE AND INCOME LEVELS.<br />
THIS APPROACH LAY BEHIND OUR COVENING OF THE N4ATIONAL ECONOMIC<br />
SUMMIT CONFERENCE W4E HELD LAST APRIL, JUST A MONTH AFTER MY<br />
GOVERNMENT TOOK OFFICE.<br />
THERE, REPRESENTATIVES OF FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS,<br />
ALL MEM1BERS OF THE EXECUTIVE OF THE AUSTRALIAN~ COUNCIL OF TRADE<br />
UNIONS AND 35 AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS LEADERS LENT THEIR SUPPORZT TO A<br />
STRATEGY FOR RECOVERY WHICH HAS SINCE THEN SERVED) AS A USEFUL GUIDE<br />
TO GOVERNMENT POLICY. </p>
<p>THAT POLICY W4AS ENUNCIATED THROUGH THE 17 MAY ECONOMIC STATEMENT<br />
AND IN OUR BUDGET OF AUGUST' LAST YEAR. WE HAVE COMBINED EXPANSIONA Y<br />
FISCAL P(' LIc-IES WITH FIRM O~ UT NOT TIGH4T MONETARY POLICIES. THIS IS<br />
ALLOWING STRONG GRCWTH BUT IS NOT FUELING INFLATION. IMPORTANTLY 14E<br />
HAVE FINANCED THE DEFICIT SUCCESSFULLY AT THE SAMI: TIME AS SEEING<br />
INTEREST RATES FALL BELOW4 THE LEVELS WHICH PREVAILED AT THE TIME OF<br />
THE BUDGET. BUT IT IS NOT SIMPLY-IN THE STYLE AND RESULTS OF ITS APPROACH TO<br />
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT THAT MY GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL.<br />
W4E HAVE ALSO RE-ESTABLISHED A CLIMATE OF CONFIDENCE AND<br />
STABILITY WITHIN AUSTRALIA.<br />
THIS FINDS VISIBLE EXPRESSION IN THE MARKED IMPROVEMENT WHICH<br />
HAS OCCURRED IN AUSTRALIA'S INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS.<br />
IN THE TWELVE MONTHS TO OCTOBER LAST YEAR, THE NUMBER OF WORKING<br />
DAYS LOST THROUGH IN4DUSTRIAL DISPUTES WAS THE LOWEST FOR FIFTEEN<br />
YEARS ( DOI-N TO 0.2 DAYS PER WORKER PER YEAR) AND LESS THAN HALF THAT<br />
FOR THE YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 1982. IN THE MA~ RITIME INDUSTRY A SECTOR<br />
OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO SINGAPORE THE NUMBER OF DAYS LOST IN THE<br />
PERIOD DROPPED 57 PER CENT.<br />
IT HAS BEEN A PARTICULAR PRIORITY OF MY GOVERNMENT T) SECURE THE<br />
ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ORDERLY AND STABLE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS SYSTEM<br />
CONSISTENT WITH OUR CONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICES IN AUSTRALIA. TH4E<br />
PRICES AND INCOMES ACCORD, THE ACTIVE SUPPORT WE HAVE GIVEN TO<br />
CREATION OF TRIPARTITE CONSULATIVE ORGANS AT INDUSTRY LEVEL, AND TI4E<br />
THOROUGH REVIEW AND RATIO NALISATI ON OF THE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS<br />
MACHINERY WE HAVE INITIATED HAVE ALL CONTRIBUTED TO THIS RESULT.<br />
IN SHORT, AUSTRALIA TODAY IS PUTTING BEHIND IT THE UNPRODUCTIVE,<br />
DIVISIVE AND CONFRONTATIONAL STYLES OF THE PAST AND I1N THEIR STEAD<br />
ESTABLISHING APPROACHES W4HICH EMPHASISE THE BENEFITS OF CONSULTATIVE<br />
AND CO-OPERATIVE ACTION.<br />
OUR IMMEDIATE TASK YAS GOVERNMENT WAS TO TURN THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
ECONOMY AROUND. AT EVERY POINT WE HAVE DIRECTED ATTENTION NOT MERELY<br />
TO THE IMMEDIATE ISSUES BUT TO THE MEDIUM AND LONGER-TERM<br />
C0ONSIDRATIONS NECESSARY TO PROMOTING AND SUSTAINING GORWTH. THE<br />
PERSPECTIVES WE HAVE BROUGHT TO BEAR HAVE GIVEN AS MUCH W4EIGHT TO<br />
LONGER-TERti REQUIREMENTS AS TO SHORT-TERM IMPERATIVES.<br />
WE HAVE CONTINUED TO GIVE APPROPRIATE ATTENTION TO THE NEED TO<br />
COMPLEMENT AUSTRALIA'S HIGHT RATE OF DOMESTIC SAVINGS BY INVESTEMNT<br />
FROM ABROAD.<br />
THE MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE POLICIES ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT, WHICH<br />
HAVE HAD BROAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT SINCE THEY WERE INTRODUCED IN THE<br />
LAST YEAR OF THE WHITLAII GOVERNM1ENT IN 1975, HAVE BEEN REAFFIRMED.<br />
WE HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT WE WELCOME PRODUCTIVE FOREIGN INVESTMENT<br />
WHERE IT PROVIDES ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR AUSTRALIANS TO<br />
PARTICIPATE IN4 THE ENSUING DEVELOPMENT.<br />
IN4DEED WE ATTACH SOME IMPORTANCE TO SINGAPORE'S RECENT EMERGENCE<br />
AS A MAJOR SOURCE OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN ENTERPRISES I14 AISTRALIA<br />
IN 1081/ 832 IT RAN4KED THIRD BEHIND TH4E UNITED) KINGDOM AND THE UNITED<br />
STATES. </p>
<p>WE REGARD THIS AS BEING PARTICULARLY RELEVANT TO THE QUALITY OF<br />
FUITURE RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. THAT IT IS BEING M TCHED<br />
bY AN EXPAN4DING AUSTRALIAN PRESENCE ON THE GROUN4D HERE IN SINGAPORE<br />
REFLECTS A H4EALTHY DEGREE OF RECIPROCITY lN THE RELATIONSHIP AND<br />
SUGGESTS THAT IN BOTH OUR COUNTRIES A VERY SOLID BASIS EXITS FOR THE<br />
CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF VERY CLOSE ECONOMIC RELATIONS BETWEEN US.<br />
BUSINESSMEN IN SINGAPORE WILL BE WELL AWARE OF THE BENEFITS THAT<br />
A DYNAMIC, INTERNATIONALLY-ORIENTED FINANCIAL SECTOR CAN MAKE TO<br />
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BOTH DIRECTLY, AS AN I14PORTANT INDUSTRY<br />
EMPLOYING LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE, AND INDIRECTLY, THROUGH THE<br />
STIMULUS IT CAN PROVIDE TO EXPANSION OF OTHER INDUSTRIES.<br />
WE IN AUSTRALIA HAVE BEEN EXAMINING OPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL<br />
REFORM. WE TOOK A SUBSTANTIAL STEP LAST DECEMBER WHEN W4E FLOATED THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR AND REMOVED A WIDE RANGE OF LONGSTANDING EXCHANGE<br />
CONTROLS. THE REMO%! AL OF THESE EXCHANGE CON4TROLS IN ITSELF HAS IN4CREASED<br />
THE POTENTIAL INVOLVEMENT OF AUSTRALIAN ENTERPRISES IN INTERNATIONAL<br />
TRANSACTIONS. THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEFORE IT AS PRESENT THE REPORT OF A<br />
COMMITTEE, THE MARTIN COMMITTEE, WHICH WAS ASKED TO PROVIDE ADVICE ON<br />
THE MERITS OF FURTHER DEREGULATION AND INTERNATIONALISATION OF THE<br />
FINANCIAL SECTOR IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
AMONG OTHER THINGSt THE COMMITEE, WHOSE REPORT WILL BE RELEASE<br />
LATER TH4IS MONTH, RECOMMENDS THE ADMISSION INTO AUSTRALIA OF A<br />
LIMITED NUMBER OF FOREIGN BANKS. I EXPECT THIS MATTER TO BE ADDRESSED<br />
BY MY CABINET IN THE NEXT MONTH OR SO.<br />
THE ADMISSION OF FOREIGN BANKS INTO AUSTRALIA WOUL. D INCREASE OUR<br />
INVOLVEMENT IN INTERN4ATIONAL FINANCIAL BUSINESS. BUT IF WE TAKE THIS<br />
STEP, WE WILL STILL NEED TO CONSIDER WHETHER TO MOVE IN ANOTHER AREA<br />
AS WEILL, TO FACILITATION OF OFF-SHORE BANKING IN AUSTRALIA. THERE<br />
HAVE, AS YOUi KNOW, BEEN EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST FOR SUCH A<br />
POSSIBILITY BY TWO AUSTRALIAN STATES. THERE W4OULD BE ADVANTAGES IN<br />
THE INCREASED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, EMPLOYMENT AND WORKFORCE SKILLS TH4AT<br />
WOULD COM1E W4ITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF OFFSH4ORE BANKING. BUT THERE W4OULD<br />
BE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROVISION OF THE TAXATION INCENTIVES<br />
THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE A MAJOR IMPETUS TO GROWTH IN THIS<br />
INDUSTRY. THESE AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS WILL NEED TO BE CAREFULLY<br />
WEIGH4ED IN ANY DECISION ON THESE ISSUES.<br />
WHATEVER THE DECISION TAKEN, THE COURSE W4E HAVE EMBARKED ON IS<br />
ONE WHICH HILL SEE AS I HAVE SAI1D MANY TIMES BEPORE IN AUSTRALIA<br />
CONTINUED FINANCIAL DEREGULATION WHERE REGULATION SERVES HO CLEAR<br />
PURPOSE IN4 PROMOTING ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY OR SOCIAL EQUITY. IT IS My<br />
GOVERNMENT' S VIEW THAT A MORE DYNAMIC, EFFICIENT AND OUTWARD-LOOKING<br />
AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL SECTOR WOULD INTERACT WITH THIS GREAT CENTRE IN<br />
A W4AY THAT WAS BENEFICIAL TO THEM BOTH. </p>
<p>MR CHAIRMAN, TH': TREND IS TOWARDS SIGNIFICANTLY CLOSER<br />
AUSTRALT. AN ' OVERALL INVOLVEMENT IN REGIONAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THE<br />
ALREADY SUBSTANTIAl-TRPDE RLLATIONSHIP AUSTRALIA ENJOYS WITH JAPAN IS<br />
TO BE BROADENED THROUGH A DETERMINED EFFORT AT DIVE RSIFI CATIO01 INTO<br />
NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE RAPIDLY GROWING TRADE WE HAVE W1ITH<br />
CHINA MAY ALSO BE TRANSFORMED, DEPENDING ON THE RESULTS OF A JOINT<br />
STUDY INITIATED BY PREMIER ZHAO ZIYANG AND MYSELF ON TkC PROSPECTS<br />
FOR INTEGRATING MORE CLOSELY OUR IRON AN4D STEEL. INDUSTRIES.<br />
IN SINGAPORE TOO, WE ARE SEEKING CLOSER INTEGRATION OF OUR TWO<br />
ECONOMIES. THE TRADE AND INDUSTRY POLICIES MY GOVERNMENT IS DEVELOPING<br />
SHOULD REINFORCE AUSTRALIA'S CAPACITY TO SECURE MORE FULLY THE<br />
BENEFITS ASSOCIATED W4ITH THE DYNAMISM OF T141S REGION'S ECONOMIC<br />
A CTI VI TY.<br />
THOSE POLICIES, AND INDEED THE CONTINUED DYNAMISM OF OUR REGION;<br />
DEPEND ON TH4E MAINTENANCE OF AN OPEN INTERNATIONAL TRADING SYSTEM.<br />
CALLS SUCH AS THOSE DY PRIME MINISIER NAKASONE AND SPECIAL TRADE<br />
REPRESENTATIVE BROCK FOR A NEW ROUND OF MULTILATERAL TRADE<br />
NEGOTIATIONS ARE BOTH TIMELY AND APT. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT HOWEVER<br />
THAT EVERY EFFORT NOW BE MADE TO ENSURE SUCH A ROUND C* GNTRIBUTES NOT<br />
ONLY TO GLOBAL TRADE EXPANSION GENERALLY BUT ALSO TO CONDITIONS<br />
CONDUCIVE TO EVEN STRONGER ECONOMIC AND TRADING ACTIVITY BY COUNTRIES<br />
OF THIS REGIUN. IF THIS IS TO HAPPEN A NEW TRADE ROUND WILL HAVE TO<br />
ADDRESS A NUMBER OF AREAS PREVIOUSLY PUT ASIDE AS EXCEPTIONS TO TH4E<br />
GENERAL TRADING RULES. SUBSIDIES AND NON-TARIFF BARRIERS TO TRADE,<br />
FOR EXAMPLE, S1HOULD BE ADDRESSED EFFECTIVELY.<br />
TO HELP ACHIEVE THIS RESULT I SUGGEST LAST NOVEMBER IN BANGKOK<br />
THAT COUNTRIES OF THIS REGION SHOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY HOW THEY<br />
MIGHT BEST SECURE ATTENTION TO THEIR INTERESTS IN SUCH A ROUND.<br />
SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN VERY ENCOURAGED B3Y THE SUPPORT W4ITHIN THIS<br />
REGIONAL FOR SUCH AN APPROACH. PRIME MINISTER NAKASONE AND PRESIDENT<br />
CHUN LENT THIS SUGGESTION THEIR EXPLICIT SUPPOF. T AND PREMIER ZHAODESPITE<br />
CHINA'S NOT BEING A MEMBER OF G. A. T. T. INDICATED CHINA'S<br />
INTEREST IN BEING IDENTIFIED WITH THE APPROACH I' HAVE PROPOSED.<br />
BEFORE LEAVING AUSTRALIA I ALSO RECEIVED FROM PRIME MINISTER LEE<br />
KUWAN YEW A. LETTER SUGGESTING THAT W4E SHOULD WORK TOGETHER TO THITS<br />
END. THIS WAS ESPECIALLY WELCOME. I INTEND FOLLOWING IT UP WITH4 HIM<br />
LATER TODAY.<br />
PROGRESS THROUGH4 A MULTILATERAL ROUND W4ILL NECESSARILY BE SLOW.<br />
RESULTS HOWEVER ARE THAT IS NEEDED AND, AS THEY ARE ACHIEVED, I<br />
AM SURE THE WORLD IJILL BE A BETTER PLACE FOR THEM.<br />
IN THIS REGARD I LOOK FORWARD PARTICULARLY TO AUSTRALIA AND<br />
SINGAPORE BUILDING ON OUR LONG-STANDING CLOSE AND PRODUCTIVE<br />
RELATIONSHIP, TO OUR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE, AND TO THE ADVAN4TAGE OF THE<br />
WIDE REGION OF WHICH WE ARE PART. </p>
