    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...................................................................................................</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I have just briefly left the Cabinet meeting to</p>
<p> announce that the Federal Government has decided on the basis that the</p>
<p> New South Wales Government will match the Federal Government's contribution</p>
<p> dollar for dollar, the Federal Government has decided to supplement in</p>
<p> cooperation with the State Government the amount coming under the deed</p>
<p> of arrangement for National Textiles to an amount so that the workers</p>
<p> will receive their full entitlements.</p>
<p>This commitment is conditional on a number of things. The first condition,</p>
<p> of course, is that the New South Wales Government will, as promised, match</p>
<p> the Commonwealth contribution dollar for dollar.</p>
<p>It is also conditional on all parties getting behind and supporting the</p>
<p> proposed deed of arrangement and that that deed of arrangement being approved</p>
<p> without any undue delay so that the funds that will flow from that deed</p>
<p> of arrangement and the action that will occur as a result of that deed</p>
<p> arrangement can be applied towards the realisation of the claims in accordance</p>
<p> with the law including importantly the claims of the workers.</p>
<p>The money will be paid by the Commonwealth Government and the State Government</p>
<p> up front so that there will be approximately $4 million available from</p>
<p> the two governments in effect immediately.</p>
<p>In addition to that and recognising the severe, relatively speaking,</p>
<p> the difficult employment situation in this part of Australia the Government</p>
<p> is also willing to make available training assistance to the retrenched</p>
<p> workers up to the tune of $2 million. This was an element of support that</p>
<p> I mentioned in my discussion with the delegation of workers I met at Williamtown</p>
<p> last Friday.</p>
<p>Can I say that in addition Mr Reith will be putting out a more detailed</p>
<p> statement which encapsulates the things that I have mentioned here but</p>
<p> also confirming the general approach that we are going to take in relation</p>
<p> to our basic payment scheme for the future. And he'll be canvassing</p>
<p> in some detail how we are going to deal with situations of this kind that</p>
<p> might arise in the future.</p>
<p>I have already indicated that I had a particular sympathy for workers</p>
<p> in a situation such as this. It is the obligation of governments to pursue</p>
<p> agendas of economic change and reform because they are beneficial to the</p>
<p> overall community. But it is also the obligation of governments where</p>
<p> people are hurt through no fault of their own as a consequence of that</p>
<p> economic change and reform it's necessary to give a bit of assistance</p>
<p> to those people.</p>
<p>And just as in other circumstances that assistance has been extended</p>
<p> particularly in an industry such as textiles which for many years was</p>
<p> supported by government but is now in the name of broader economic reforms</p>
<p> seeing its protection withdrawn. It is not unreasonable that special regard</p>
<p> by had to those circumstances.</p>
<p>The answer is not to slow down economic reform, the answer rather is</p>
<p> to take particular care that where there are particular victims of economic</p>
<p> reform those people are given a bit of assistance. And it was in that</p>
<p> light that I felt in this particular case having regard to not only the</p>
<p> regional circumstances but the character of the industry and the reform</p>
<p> process that's occurred in that industry, I thought that the right</p>
<p> and proper thing was to try and find a way of ensuring that these men</p>
<p> and women got their entitlements.</p>
<p>Now, the question of a broader basic payment scheme is something that</p>
<p> has to be considered away from the focus, I suppose, of a particular situation</p>
<p> and we must have regard to other factors in relation to that. But this</p>
<p> is an example of where governments should keep up the process of economic</p>
<p> reform but recognise that some people may get hurt in the process and</p>
<p> be willing to help those people. And I think what we have done is to provide</p>
<p> them with genuine help.</p>
<p>We'll be providing about $4 million and the New South Wales Government</p>
<p> about $2 million and I hope that the deed of arrangement can be concluded</p>
<p> as speedily as possible so that these people may, with the assistance</p>
<p> of the two governments, be able to get on with their lives. And I wish</p>
<p> them and their families better fortune in the future and I hope this assistance</p>
<p> from the two governments will help in some way to aid them in that aspiration.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So Prime Minister, is it the case that the National Textile workers are</p>
<p> being regarded by Cabinet as a one-off case or is the principle that you</p>
<p> have applied to National Textiles one that you intend to apply more generally</p>
<p> in terms of the Government's treatment of workers entitlements in</p>
<p> cases like National Textiles?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Jim, what we have done is to say we believe there should be a basic payments</p>
<p> approach to redundancy situations wherever they occur. In the case of</p>
<p> National Textiles because of the relatively higher rate of unemployment</p>
<p> in that area and also because it is an industry that's been affected by</p>
<p> economic change a top up over and above the basic approach was justifiable</p>
<p> and desirable.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, [inaudible] in the future if we do have some kind of</p>
<p> national entitlement scheme in place, would other workers that might find</p>
<p> themselves in a similar situation who might be in a strapped region as</p>
<p> well, expect something extra the Government to give them extra consideration</p>
<p> on top of the national safety net. . ?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What you should wait Fran is to have a look at Mr Reith's statement</p>
<p> and further comments that we are going to make. But what we've sought</p>
<p> to do today is to crystallise the Government's intentions in relation</p>
<p> to the problem, generally, and also to pay particular regard to circumstances</p>
<p> where because of economic change, you've got to remember that textiles,</p>
<p> clothing, and footwear is an area that was protected for a very long time</p>
<p> and that protection was begun to be unwound by the Hawke Government and</p>
<p> that process has gone on, and it is only fair and proper that we stand</p>
<p> beside these people in that situation particularly having regard to the</p>
<p> difficulties in that region.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, an estimated 20,000 workers a year find themselves under these</p>
<p> circumstances in less celebrated cases. Will you be looking at some of</p>
<p> those to see if they also . . .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Catherine, I've stated, Catherine I have stated what we have</p>
<p> decided today and I think that is about all I intend to say at this stage.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>. . . undertaking from the New South Wales Government today on your decision?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Mr Reith has an undertaking from the New South Wales Government</p>
<p> to match dollar for dollar what we do in relation to the entitlements.</p>
<p> And I am quite certain that . . . well, no I haven't been in touch</p>
<p> with Mr Carr, Mr Reith has been in touch with Mr Shaw and we're anxious</p>
<p> to work with the New South Wales Government in this. This ought not to</p>
<p> be something where the two governments do other than work together very</p>
<p> closely to assist the men and women of the region.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, do you think directors' duties should be tightened?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what we've said in the past and what we intend to do, is to</p>
<p> create a new offence, whereby anybody who acts in a way that is calculated</p>
<p> to deprive workers of their entitlements, or part of those entitlements,</p>
<p> then that should be an offence. Now that is a change to the Corporations</p>
<p> Law. Can I say that there is no allegation being made in this case that</p>
<p> that has occurred. But of course this case will be treated like every</p>
<p> other case. It will be treated on its merits. And if there is any fault</p>
<p> claimed well that'll be investigated. But I have to say that there's</p>
<p> been no claim of the breach of the law made to the Government that I am</p>
<p> aware of.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, just to get this clear, is it the case that for greater</p>
<p> generosity on the part of the taxpayers to occur where businesses to go</p>
<p> under, the two criteria are that it be a business which has suffered because</p>
<p> of microeconomic reform, and secondly that it be in an area, the business</p>
<p> be an area of higher than normal . . .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think what you can safely say Jim is that the reason that we have gone</p>
<p> beyond the basic payments approach in relation to National Textiles, is</p>
<p> because of those two reasons.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Inaudible.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am sorry, I can't hear you.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is the deed of arrangement a certainty. And if it isn't will there</p>
<p> be government, would the government be contributing more?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I have said that what we are offering is conditional on the deed</p>
<p> of arrangement being signed. Is that a certainty? Well, as far as we're</p>
<p> concerned, it should be. I would encourage everybody to get behind the</p>
<p> deed of arrangement. I raised that matter with the worker's delegation.</p>
<p> And I mean we are, in co-operation with the New South Wales Government,</p>
<p> we're going to pick up the difference between what is coming from</p>
<p> the company, from the liquidation process, so that they will get their</p>
<p> full entitlements. Now in those circumstances it's highly desirable</p>
<p> that the deed of arrangement be signed. And I would hope that all of those</p>
<p> people who can influence, including the union, will get behind the deed</p>
<p> of arrangement.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, in relation to the GST. Can you guarantee that new car prices</p>
<p> will still fall by 8%?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Phil, I can just repeat what I said. And that is as a result of the change</p>
<p> in the tax, there will be a fall, the price of cars will be lower to the</p>
<p> amount I mentioned than they would otherwise have been. It's axiomatic.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>. . . petrol pricing in Cabinet today. .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Sorry. .</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Senator Kemp said this afternoon that the Government would deliver on</p>
<p> its promise that petrol prices need not rise under the GST. Are there</p>
<p> any limits to that promise?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I can only tell you that we are going honour that promise.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well that means that the top price paid in the country will not increase</p>
<p> as a consequence of the GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Jim, I know what is patently the case. And that is that we are going</p>
<p> to honour our commitment.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So there are no limits to that . . .</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So, regional Australia can rest assured that under the GST they won't</p>
<p> be paying more?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, country Australia is going to do very well out of this tax package.</p>
<p> I haven't spent a week travelling around the Australian bush to see</p>
<p> other than great benefits delivered to rural Australia, as a result of</p>
<p> the taxation package. They will have cheaper diesel. All fuel for business</p>
<p> purposes in both city and country will fall by about 7 cents a litre,</p>
<p> because you will be able to get the GST back as input cost. And I think</p>
<p> that when people see the GST come in and they see the new tax arrangement</p>
<p> I think they're going to be well satisfied. Look, we might, I might</p>
<p> as well make this comment now that we are going to have a scare day, seven</p>
<p> days a week between now and the introduction of the new tax system. We</p>
<p> fully expected that and what has happened over the past few weeks is of</p>
<p> no surprise to me. I want to make it clear that the Government's</p>
<p> commitment to the implementation of the plan in full is absolutely irrevocable,</p>
<p> because we believe that it will benefit Australia. And I believe that</p>
<p> once the new plan is in the benefits will overwhelm the negative campaign</p>
<p> that is being waged by our political opponents. It is easy to run a negative</p>
<p> campaign. It's easy to run an argument. It's easy to run a scare.</p>
<p> It's easy to take a tiny bit of what a minister's said in an</p>
<p> answer in Senate Estimates and say this is outrageous, he is walking away</p>
<p> from the Prime Minister's commitment, when he wasn't doing any</p>
<p> thing of the kind. And I am talking about Senator Minchin. He wasn't</p>
<p> walking away from my commitment. And I don't walk away from it either.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will people [inaudible]. Is there a chance they will be?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the commitment we made in the election campaign will be kept.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you have a mechanism worked out for doing that yet?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Michelle, just be calm, be assured and be a good faith.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the National Party Federal President yesterday said she</p>
<p> wasn't happy and surely the National Party, and they are part of</p>
<p> your Coalition, and they are feeling that they have to speak out because</p>
<p> they are concerned about it. Doesn't that concern you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it doesn't. Can I tell you I don't....I mean, none of</p>
<p> this is of any surprise to me. I mean, this is the biggest tax change</p>
<p> this country has ever seen and of course you are going to have a bit of</p>
<p> static, of course you are. But people should remember there's $12</p>
<p> billion of tax cuts, cheaper fuel in the bush, cheaper more competitive</p>
<p> exports, lower operating costs, increases in pensions, abolition of provisional</p>
<p> tax, halving of capital gains tax, reduction of company tax. It's</p>
<p> terrific. And that is what people will increasingly focus on. And look,</p>
<p> I expect many news conferences like this. I expect many feisty interviews</p>
<p> on Radio National and 7:30 Report and Neil Mitchell and, of course, it</p>
<p> will go on. But in the end the wisdom and the national benefit of this</p>
<p> terrific taxation reform will break through and there will be sun all</p>
<p> around us.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, does Peter Costello need to follow your lead and get</p>
<p> out into the bush a little more often?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Mr Costello is doing a tremendous job as Treasurer and he has my total</p>
<p> support in what is a very difficult and challenging job both intellectually</p>
<p> and physically.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] and your rating has gone down considerably. Is that because</p>
<p> of the static, is it because of the GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that could be for many reasons Malcolm But look, I have experienced</p>
<p> every point, you know, on the sort of poll odyssey in my 25 years - every</p>
<p> point.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, can you promise the voters...sorry, not the voters</p>
<p> but the private motorists of say Nyngan and Bourke that after the introduction</p>
<p> of the GST they will pay no more for their petrol?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What I can promise you is that the Government's election undertaking</p>
<p> will be kept. And now I shall return to my colleagues and my duties in</p>
<p> relation to them. Cheerio. I really must depart.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] new VIP planes today?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Today? VIP planes...we haven't discussed that, not unless it's</p>
<p> occurred in the last couple of minutes. See you later.</p>
