PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 24 MAY, 1981<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
A couple of months ago, the ACTU President, Mr Dolan, and I<br />
agreed to establish regular talks between the Government and<br />
the ACTU to discuss our respective points of view on industrial.<br />
matters, and on other economic matters cf importance to<br />
Australia. It seemed to me I hope to both of us that such<br />
talks could be a constructive way of facing up to some of the<br />
industrial issues which arise in this country.<br />
This is a time in Australia's history when it is in the interest,<br />
of all of us to put conflict and division aside. For at a time<br />
when. the economy is recovering significantly, it would do great<br />
damxnajif Australians do not work together to increase the level<br />
of economic growth, to increase employment, to increase general<br />
prosperity-, and to establish conditions under which further tax<br />
cuts can 15e possible.<br />
Because private enterprise is responding so strongly to the.-*<br />
incentives provided by Government policies, we are now seeing<br />
a very broad-based recovery in the economy. Economic growth is<br />
faster than it has been for years. Employment is increasing,<br />
and unemployment is falling.: In April this year, unemployment<br />
was at its lowest in four years, and youth unemployment dropped<br />
substantially as part of this trend. All Australians want the<br />
revival of employment to continue. It is vital as a way to<br />
improve our standard of living, and in addition to that, all<br />
Australians are keen that young people in particular should be<br />
able to get jobs.<br />
I do not believe that anyone in this count ry really wants to see<br />
the improvements in our economy, and in the employment situation,<br />
placed at risk. And surely the union movement, with its concern<br />
for the welfare of its members and pot ' ential members, cannot<br />
want to impede economic recovery. All Australians are surely at<br />
one in wanting the economy to continue to strengthen.<br />
The fact is, however, that industrial dislocation, and any<br />
excessive pushing for wage increases outside the arbitration<br />
system must be seen as putting the economy at risk, especially<br />
where little or no account is taken of the capacity of industry<br />
to pay. In particular, there is a well established link between<br />
excessive wage increases and unemployment. The two are inseparable. </p>
<p>Part of the reason for the recent growth in employment is that<br />
Australian industry has come to be more competitive. This has been<br />
enabling it to sell more of its products, both at home and overseas.<br />
The quality of Australian goods is improving all the time. And<br />
the time is certainly well past when there was any reason -to think<br />
that goods made overseas are likely to be better than Australianmade<br />
goods.<br />
But industrial disruption and excessive wage rises certainly<br />
reduce the competitiveness of Australian industry.. And in one<br />
way or another, this is damaging to all of us. If manufacturers<br />
cannot sell as much, they wlll not be able to employ as many<br />
people. Less'production and fewer wage earners will undoubtedly<br />
lead to a situation in which overall prosperity in this country<br />
goes backwards rather than forwards.<br />
The Arbitration Commission recently established some new wage<br />
-fixation guidelines, which have been in operation for only a very<br />
short time. A large number of parties, including both the ACTU<br />
and the Government, made submissions to the inquiry conducted by<br />
the Commission. And it is surely now up to all parties to * give the<br />
new guidelines a chance, and to see how satisfactory they prove to<br />
be. Wage fixing systems are probably never perfect, but it is surely<br />
reasonable to give a fair try to a new set of arrangements.<br />
The__ Go~ yernment is well aware that there are certain difficulties<br />
and dissatisfactions with Australia's. existing wage fixing system. Because<br />
of these feelings, the Government has recently decided to establish<br />
a broad r" Enging independent inquiry into wage determination and<br />
in~ ustil relations in Australia. This inquiry will run concurrently<br />
with the new system of guidelines. The inquiry will take some<br />
eighteen months or so to complete, and it will be able to watch<br />
the new system in operation. I very much hope that all parties and<br />
organisations in Australia will approach this inquiry in a constructive<br />
way... For an inquiry such as this provides an opportunity<br />
for making the breakthroughs which so many of us would like to see,<br />
and which could have such a desirable impact on the industrial<br />
relations scene in Australia. It is my strong hope that nothing<br />
will be done to jeopardise the possible success of this inquiry,<br />
and I appeal to all parties to view it and approach it in a<br />
constructive way.<br />
Mr Dolan and I will be having the first of the regular meetings<br />
between the Government and the ACTU next month. And there are<br />
obviously several matters which both of us will be wanting to<br />
raise at that meeting.-It would be foolish to pretend that the<br />
issues are all easy ones. But the Government for its part will<br />
certainly be seeking constructive solutions that will be in the<br />
interests of all Australians. 0000000 </p>
