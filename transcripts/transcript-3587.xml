PRIME MINISTER'S CONFERENCE BELGRhADE<br />
JAUARY 1975;<br />
The following is the text of the Prime Minister's press<br />
conference held in Belgrade on 10 January 1975.<br />
Vitorovic. Radio Belarade<br />
Q. Would you like to comment on the talks with President<br />
Tito this morning-We didn't have a chance to read the toast<br />
yet,<br />
A, You are referring to the fact that a recording was<br />
made of the President's speech in proposing a toast at the<br />
lunch he gave us and also I suppose there was a recording taken<br />
of my response. But we did spend an hour and a half before the<br />
lunch discussing a wide range of matters.. It was naturally a<br />
matter of the greatest interest to the Australians to have such<br />
a full and free discussion with so eminent a leader of his<br />
country and, I think I can say, inspiration to the world in war<br />
and peace as your President The President showed a great<br />
interest in Australia and also a very great appreciation of<br />
the attitudes that my Government has demonstrated over the two<br />
years that we have been in office,. He is one of the world's<br />
great men and has been for a generation, We thought it a great<br />
occasion. ( Name Indistinguishable)<br />
Q-Mr Prime Minister I am from Nova Macedonia near<br />
Macedonia, I have two questions,~ The first question refers<br />
We would like to have your ideas and views.. How do you look<br />
upon the fact that you have 250 thousand Yugoslavs in Australia?<br />
What do you think of their contribution and their work towards<br />
the prosperity and the development of your country, especially<br />
w ith respect to their contribution to the promotion of friendship<br />
between Australia and Yugoslavi-* a. The second question we would<br />
appreciate having your views with respect to the efforts that<br />
are being made at present to have the Indian Ocean become a Zone<br />
of Peace and security. 12... </p>
<p>A, Australia has been interested in Yugoslavia for two<br />
full generations. We were allies throughout the First World<br />
War. At one period during the Second World War, Yugoslavia<br />
was the only country in the whole of the continent of Europe<br />
which was fighting for the same cause as Australia. Accordingly<br />
the quarter of a million Yugoslavs who have come to Australia<br />
have come to a country which was disposed to regard them highly<br />
indeed. They have proved very sturdy citizens in Australia.<br />
I can testify to that myself because there are a very great<br />
number of Yugoslavs who live in my constituency out of Sydney.<br />
Any Yugoslavs who come to Australia can be assured that they<br />
will find friendship and prosperity in Australia.<br />
You asked also about the Indian Ocean. Like every<br />
country round the Indian Ocean Australia deplores any prospect<br />
of a confrontation in the ocean between the United States and<br />
the Soviet Union. We do not want the Indian Ocean, which has<br />
been the freest of all the world's oceans from this rivalry<br />
between the two superpowers, to become infected by it. I have<br />
put this point through diplomatic channels and also directly<br />
to Washington. I have put it through diplomatic channels to<br />
Moscow and will do so directly in Moscow next week. Our concept<br />
is one which has the support of the President and the Government<br />
of Yugoslavia.<br />
Malcolm Browne, New York Times<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister in your toast to Prime Minister<br />
Bijedic the other day you mentioned that your country had a<br />
growing similarity in position to that of the non-aligned<br />
countries of the world and certainly your administration has<br />
demonstrated that. Do you feel that at some point that a<br />
non-aligned Australia could have n7' oblems of conflict with the<br />
ANZUS Treaty arrangement?<br />
A. Also in my speech last night I pointed out that we were<br />
an ally of the United States, There has never been any question<br />
oi' that, We are not a non-aligned country. Nevertheless we have<br />
supported, whereas the preceding Government of Aus-tralia did niot<br />
support, many of those concepts for which the non-aligned countries<br />
have fought for very many years. For instance the nonaligned<br />
countries have fought against colonialism: they have<br />
fought against racism: they have fought for development. The<br />
Australian Government now takes the same attitude on all those<br />
three matters. It would be astonishing if an Australian<br />
Government were to act hereafter otherwise since Australia is<br />
surrounded by countries to which the question of development,<br />
racism and colonialism are crucial. I would not believe that<br />
there is any real interest of the United States adversely<br />
affected by any of those policies. If ANZUS doesn't stand. for<br />
the three attitudes I have expressed then ANZUS is not ass<br />
wholesome as we believe it is. / 3. </p>
<p>Stn Zi] vkovic. Radio Belgrade<br />
Q. ( Inaudible)<br />
A. We can best contribute to this by understanding each<br />
other's attiti,-es in preparing for those wider gatherings where<br />
these subj4aots arise. There have been many occasions in the last<br />
two years and one a month for the last three United Nations<br />
General Assemblies where, for instance, Yugoslavia and Australia<br />
have clearly shown that they have each other's attitudes in mind..<br />
There was a completely new matter in the economic deal where<br />
we cooperated quite closely, namely, the International Bauxite<br />
Association. I think that is the answer, It is not that we would<br />
do so many things, just the two of us, but that we should be aware<br />
of each other's attitudes at wider gatherings where we are each<br />
present. Perhaps I could give another instance. There has been<br />
a serious economic affect to one of our industries and also the<br />
same industry in Yugoslavia through the precipitate, incons-iderate<br />
action of some of our trading partners, namely, our cattle<br />
indi~ stry. Now here is something -that we can't solve just the two<br />
of u~ s but we have discussed dealing with it in a wider context<br />
and that is something which was mentioned today.<br />
Z ivkovic Q. My second question is what are other spheres in which<br />
Yug.) slav/ Australian relations can be most successful, in the<br />
bileateral field. I am not sure I can answer tY*.' t question satisfactoriLy.<br />
T t'Lnk you have good instances in your first question and I don't<br />
know offhand what other fields I would add to those that you mentioned0<br />
ZirSFovi c<br />
Q. My third question0 Being twice in this count; ry you<br />
know this country better than most. May we therefore ask you for<br />
you-~ impressions of this country.<br />
A. Well I can't really claim to have any wide knowledge of<br />
Yugoslavia0 I know something of Belgrade and of the Dalmatian<br />
Coast so all I can say is that I am impressed by the growth and<br />
modernity of the Capital and the beauty of the coast.<br />
Mr Jost, Melbourne Age<br />
Q. Since you last went to the United States has anything<br />
occurred to make you believe that ANZUS is not as wholesome as you<br />
thought it was'?<br />
A. No. / 40.0 </p>
<p>Dusko Doder, Washington Post<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister as you know, the Ustashi is a very<br />
active organisation in Australia.<br />
A. Not as active as it was believe me.<br />
Q. I want to ask if the question of Ustashi has come up<br />
in your talks with Mr Tito and Mr Bijedic.<br />
A. Well let me say as you will understand, the Washington<br />
Post is my favourite newspaper.<br />
In the discussions that we had this morning with<br />
Mr Bijedic and his colleagues and with the President I don't<br />
think the word was mentioned. There was reference from the<br />
Yugoslav side of appreciation for the way that my Government had<br />
been vigilant in this matter. It is clear that the Yugoslav<br />
Government appreciates the fact that there have been no outrages<br />
from this quarter in Australia since the Government of Australia<br />
changed.<br />
Mr McKendrv. Australian Broadcasting Commission<br />
Q. My question follows that of my colleague from the<br />
Washington Post.<br />
A. You don't expect me to name my favourite station.<br />
r Hi hfield, A. B. C.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, during youlr discussions with Mr Bijedic<br />
did you raise the question Sir of &amp; Lleged activities of the<br />
Yugoslav Secret Police and, secondly Sir, could I ask you what<br />
progress has been made on the question of dual nationality.<br />
A. Neither of these matters arose in my discussions with<br />
Mr Bijedic last night or this morning, nor in the discuE: sions<br />
with the President. Now I want to make it plain that in giving<br />
that answer I am not in any way confirming any impression you may<br />
have that Yugoslav Secret Police do operate in Australia. I am<br />
not making any reference to that matter at all,<br />
Now on the second matter you raised. There has been<br />
for some time discussions through the normal diplomatic channels<br />
of one of the consequences of dual nationality. It was not<br />
discussed in my discussions with Mr Bijedic or with the President.<br />
I think the officials accompanying me might have discussed this<br />
aspect to which I refer of the question of dual nationality, the<br />
matter for which we are concerned is the right of persons in<br />
YugosLavia who hold Australian passports to have access to the<br />
AustrrLlian Consular services. Now progress has been made on this<br />
question. I don't think that one ought to express it in the </p>
<p>wider question of' dual nationality becuase this is obviously<br />
a very complex legal matter which effects any countries which<br />
have different legal systems. Australia has the English Common<br />
Law where in effect your citizenship depends on your choice of<br />
country. Yugoslavia and most European countries have the IUS<br />
SANGUINIS that is your citizenship depends on your ancestry. So<br />
there 2Inevitable conflict between the IUS LOCH and the<br />
IUS-SAI4GUINIS. Now we can't really solve this for the whole<br />
world. What we are concerned with is that Australians who have<br />
passports should be able to have access to Australian Consuls.<br />
Roy Gutman, Reuters<br />
Q. I am wondering in your speech and also in articles in<br />
tVhe International Review in Yugoslavia you said you would like<br />
Australia to be a representative at the next.-non-aligned conference.<br />
I am wondering has Yugoslavia agreed to back the Australian desf-re<br />
to be an observer or have they told you that there is some criteria<br />
that you must first meet and if so do you think you will be able<br />
to meet them. The second question on the Consular International<br />
area is do you expect that there might be a Consular agreement ' n<br />
the near future and could you give an outline of what it might be<br />
like.<br />
A. Australia would welcome an invitation to attend the next<br />
non-aligned conference as an observer or as a guest. We discus. Sed<br />
this matter both with Mr Bijedic and his Ministers and with the<br />
President. I think I can say they were sympathetic in the matter0<br />
I was not wanting to give the impression that there<br />
would be anything so formal as a Consular agreement between<br />
Australia and Yugoslavia to deal with the question of AustraliJ. an<br />
Consuls having access to bearers of t4ustralian passport11s in<br />
oo~ antries where those passport bear,. rs were still regarded as<br />
citizens by birth. I expect that this matter can be settled by<br />
an arrangement following an exchange of notes. It is a matter<br />
which may in due course come within a wider international convention<br />
it concerns a great number of Common Law countries, counit--ies<br />
whi-' ch have derived their basic laws from England such as not only<br />
Australia but also Canada, the United States and New Zealand silica<br />
each of those countries have accepted hundreds and thousands of<br />
migrants from countries which have the IUS SANGUINIS the old<br />
Napoleonic Roman system of law.<br />
Peter Barron, Sydney Daily Mirror<br />
Q. When you go to Moscow from Yugoslavia will you raise with<br />
the RussLafi leaders your attitude to political prisoners in Russ3ia<br />
and if soi what will you say.<br />
A0 Well I have already answered that in the affirmative on<br />
several previous occasions.<br />
R. Schneider, Australian<br />
Q. Are you able to say with confidence that training of anti-<br />
Yugoslav terrorist on Australian soil has ceased. </p>
<p>A. I can't be absolutely confident that I believe that the<br />
practice is very much less likely to be carried on in Australia<br />
now than was previously the case. The fact is that since t~ he*<br />
change of government in Australia there have been no further acts<br />
of overt terrorism from Ustashi quarters in Australia befJore<br />
that there had been every year around the 10th April for about<br />
years. Perhaps I could add that there may be still in<br />
Australia some clubs where the portraits of Ante Pavelic anad<br />
the Croation Republic flag with the letter are still<br />
displayed. This of course causes as much resentment among<br />
Australians, both those who were born in Australia and those<br />
who have come to Australia from other countries including<br />
Yugoslavia, as would the display of Hitler's portrait or the<br />
Swastika flag. This is not illegal. in Australia but it is<br />
greatly offensive.<br />
John Jost NeJbourne Age<br />
Q. You left me in doubt with respect to your answer<br />
on the non-aligned conference as to any conditions being<br />
placed.<br />
A. There has been no discussion among the members of<br />
the non-aligned movement on this question. Accordingly one<br />
can't say that there would be any conditions lai~ d down. All<br />
I. can say is that in discussions in Sri Lanka and Yugoslavia<br />
which are leading members of the movement and have been since<br />
its foundation that no such conditions were suggested.<br />
Roy Gutman, Reuters<br />
Q. There were reports that while you were in Paris and<br />
Rome you received assurances from the governments of the<br />
countries that they would soon sign and ratify the Nuclear<br />
Non-Proliferation Pact and that this was one of the conditions<br />
which Australia would sell uranium oxide. Could you say<br />
whether this is true or not.<br />
A. If there have been such reports they are not based<br />
on anything that I have said. So I have no comment to make<br />
on such reports if there have been such.<br />
Waters, U. P. I.<br />
Q. The balance of trade is very heavily weighted between<br />
Yugoslavia and Australia in favour of Yugoslavia. Was there any<br />
agreement reached today to try to adjust that balance arid in<br />
relation to that was there any decision to try and coordLinate<br />
the Yugoslav and Australian positions with regard to meat<br />
exports to the EEC.<br />
Both matters were probably discussed by the officials<br />
of both sides in the Working Party on Economics which met while<br />
I was with the President. There was some discussion as I<br />
indicated earlier during the discussions with Mr Bijedic and<br />
his colleagues this morning concerning the sudden closure of<br />
EEC meat markets to our two countries. I am not sure that </p>
<p>7.<br />
whether you suggested that this matter should be discussed in<br />
the EEC context but if you were suggesting that, that wouldn't<br />
be adequate because to take Australia's position, it has been<br />
similarly affected by a similarly precipitate and inconsiderate<br />
closure of the Japanese market to Australian meat and one of<br />
the repeated inconsiderate threats by the United States to<br />
Australia., It is rather in the GATT context, in the discussions<br />
with Mr lbijedic, it was suggested that this be handled. It is<br />
unfortunate that such instances do occur at the expense of<br />
countries which have developed a capacity to export products<br />
which other countries themselves also produce but not in<br />
sufficient quantity, and it is deplorable that such affluent<br />
countries as the European Economic Community, Japan and the<br />
United States should be such bad internationalists when local<br />
political pressures from primary producers become uncomfortable<br />
for them. They all adopt a very moralistic and patronizing<br />
tone when their own manufacturing exports are affected. One<br />
carn imagine the howls of outrage from Western Europe, Japan<br />
or the United States if Yugoslavia or Australia would dare to<br />
cut off manufactured exports in the way that each of them has<br />
cut off or is threatening to cut off meat exports from<br />
Australia. 0 There was in the discussions ' between Miniso-. eis some<br />
brief reference to the imbalance of trade between Australia and.<br />
Yugoslavia. This is another matter which was probably discussed<br />
in the Economic Working Party. Australia does give Yugoslaviia<br />
special status as a developing country Australia is very likely<br />
to agree to the Yugoslav suggestion for a double taxation<br />
agreement. I did myself make a passing reference in conversatiorn<br />
with the President that most of Australia's exports to Yugoslavia<br />
are wool and hides. These are the basis of highly estkeemed and.<br />
I trust thriving Yugoslavian industries and crafts. : believe<br />
that much of Yugoslavia's export i. K. ome comes from products<br />
based upon imports of Australian wool and leather into<br />
Yugoslavia. 0 Well, we meet in Moscow. </p>
