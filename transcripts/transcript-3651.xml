PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 465<br />
11 March 1975<br />
PENS IONS<br />
Cabinet agreed today to a further step in the<br />
abolition of the means test for age pensions, and on<br />
an increase in all pension rates.<br />
As promised in the September 1974 Budget,<br />
the means test will be abolished for people aged 70 to 74.<br />
There will be a three months period of grace in which<br />
claims may be lodged without loss of arrears. People<br />
and over were granted exemption from a means test<br />
by my Government in 1973.<br />
In accordance with its policy of increasing<br />
pensions twice a year, the Government proposes an increase<br />
of $ 5 a week in the standard rate of pension, with<br />
proportionate adjustments for other social security.<br />
and repatriation payments.<br />
Both measures will come into effect, if accepted<br />
by the Parliament, on the first pension day in May.<br />
CANBERRA. A. C. T. </p>
