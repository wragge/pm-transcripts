PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP MELBOURNE, 10 MARCH 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: What are your chances of winning the Wills by-election?<br />
PM: Well it's going to be a difficult election for us, we<br />
don't underestimate our difficulties, but we will be in<br />
there trying'.<br />
J: Do you think the Opposition's letters to the electorate<br />
of late are going to swing that<br />
PM: I think the debate in the last few weeks has shown the<br />
difference between the Government and the Opposition.<br />
The Opposition is pretty sterile, it doesn't want to do<br />
anything about an Australian recovery, it only wants to<br />
tax your WeetBix, and your Kelloggs, and your clothes<br />
at 15 per cent. I think everyone has got that message.<br />
When the Opposition have their way, the great burden of<br />
the GST will fall on Australian women, in the<br />
management of their households, and it will fall on the<br />
business people of this country, the small business<br />
people of this country, who will no longer have a<br />
Sunday afternoon off, they will spend Sunday afternoon<br />
calculating the GST and remitting the proceeds to the<br />
tax office. This is a small business community we are<br />
in, a shopping street, all these people will be tax<br />
collectors, ' all will have to spend their Sundays<br />
collating and reconciling the GST papers and the<br />
collections. That's the new world Dr Hewson has<br />
available to them. On the other hand, the Labor Party<br />
is trying to run Australia cooperatively, bring<br />
Australians together, induce a recovery, have the<br />
Government riot sitting on the sidelines, actually doing<br />
things to lift recovery and employment, and to make<br />
society better and more efficient on the way through.<br />
J: Do you think it helps our relations with Indonesia to<br />
have confidential documents and conversations from the<br />
Department of Foreign Affairs being leaked? </p>
<p>2<br />
PM: Well these are old conversations are they not, as I<br />
understand, 1988 conversations. And this debate was on<br />
back then and I think the Indonesian Government<br />
understands that.<br />
J: But is it fair, do you agree that the Soeharto family<br />
is constraining the growth in the Indonesian economy?<br />
PM: I wouldn't endorse those conclusions, no.<br />
J: Do you agree with the protest of Lusitania Expresso<br />
going to Deli at the moment?<br />
PM: We have given appropriate warnings to the dangers of<br />
people involved in going on that vessel and I can only<br />
repeat those warnings.<br />
J: Do you agree with their right to protest?<br />
PM: Well, people have got to weigh their right to protest<br />
against the consequences of them doing it, and I am not<br />
sure that anything that they may be involved with can<br />
materially alter what has happened, or the response by<br />
Indonesia.<br />
J: Prime Minister, given yours and the Governments good<br />
form, are you thinking of an early election?<br />
PM: Well, I answered that the other day. No, the people of<br />
Australia are entitled to get value from this<br />
Parliament, it's got 15 months to run, and that's why<br />
we take the view that people are entitled to<br />
representation and that's why we've brought an election<br />
on, on the llth of April, so that the electors of Wills<br />
can quickly have a representative in the Parliament.<br />
We believe that people should be represented, and that<br />
therefore that in this electorate, the electors here<br />
have the opportunity to send Bill Kardamitsis to<br />
Canberra.<br />
J: Is that a commitment then to not hold a general<br />
election until after this time next year?<br />
PM: No, they are not commitments. It's just simply that<br />
the Parliament has got a long way to run and it's our<br />
intention to see it run on.<br />
J: But no general election before the end of this year?<br />
PM: I'm not into the commitments business, that's absurd.<br />
J: On the question of the Indonesian protest, do you<br />
believe that that leak from the Foreign Affairs<br />
Department plus this protest is going to sour relations<br />
with Indonesia?<br />
PM: I don't know, you should ask them. </p>
<p>3<br />
J: Mr Keating, is the campaign here going to be all local<br />
issues as Mr Kardamitsis said or will it be a test of<br />
One Nation and Fightback?<br />
PM: I think it's a combination of local issues, the fact<br />
that we've got a candidate who is part of the<br />
community, who stands for Labor values as well as the<br />
fact that it has been an area represented by Labor very<br />
abley by our former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, as well<br />
as some discernment on the part of the electorate about<br />
the policies of the Partys. That is, between what the<br />
Government stands for and what Dr Hewson stands for,<br />
and I think that's the important thing. The important<br />
thing for us is to have our candidate elected to the<br />
seat of Wills and to get back on governing Australia.<br />
It is the most important job at the moment<br />
government, getting a recovery going, making certain<br />
that all the One Nation Statement's elements are<br />
adopted and put into place, that we see that impact on<br />
the economy and we get down to the job of governing and<br />
not be too distracted by the business of politics.<br />
J: governing Australia, your Aboriginal Affairs<br />
Minister wants to spend several hundred million dollars<br />
in the wake of the black deaths inquiry. How hard to<br />
you think it's going to be to get the States to keep up<br />
their side of the bargain on this question?<br />
PM: Cabinet is considering this matter soon and I think<br />
it's best to talk about that after its consideration.<br />
J: Do you expect the States to be fulsome in their<br />
response to the inquiry too? There have been<br />
difficulties there in the past with Aborigines.<br />
PM: I think it has been a very long running Royal<br />
Commission and I think all the parties have taken its<br />
recommendation seriously so I will be surprised if the<br />
States don't respond seriously and well.<br />
J: Prime Minister, last week you said that Wills should be<br />
a shoo-in for the Liberals, have you changed your mind<br />
in the last few days?<br />
I<br />
PM: The fact: is ' that the Liberal Party has got a very large<br />
lead in the polls. To deny that is to deny the<br />
undeniable. But as Bill said, we are going to be in<br />
there trying, we'll be doing our best and I hope we can<br />
win.<br />
ends </p>
