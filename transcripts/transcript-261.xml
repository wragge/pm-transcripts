WOOL MARKEING COMlITTEE OF ENQUIRY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies.<br />
Late last year I announced that in view of the<br />
importance of the wool industry the Government had agreed to the<br />
request of all the federal wool growing organisations that an enquiry<br />
be arranged into Australian wool marketing methods.<br />
After mature consideration the Government has decided<br />
to appoint an independent Committee of Enquiry comprising a Chairman<br />
and two members. The Chairman will be Sir Roslyn Philp, Justice<br />
of the Supreme Court of Queensland and the members will be Mr. A. M. C.<br />
Butfield, who recently retired from the position of General Manager<br />
of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, Sydney and Mr. D. H. Merry,<br />
B. Com., Chief Economist of the Australia and Now Zealand Bank,<br />
Melbourne. The organisations all requested that the Chairman<br />
should be a member of the Judiciary.<br />
The Government will be guided by the Committee itself<br />
as to whether it may perhaps be necessary or desirable at some stage<br />
to formally retain consultants to assist the Committee in the conduct<br />
of the enquiry. The terms of reference of the Committee of Efnquipy will<br />
be to enquire into the present systems of marketing and<br />
of promoting the sale of the Australian wool clip and<br />
matters relating thereto, and to report upon the<br />
efficacy of these systems;<br />
to report upon the merits of any other systems or of<br />
modifications of the present systems which may be<br />
advocated to the com. mittee of enquiry or which the<br />
conu--ittee itself considers would be of long-term<br />
benefit to the woolgrowing industry and in the best<br />
interests of the nation.<br />
The Government considers that the terms of reference<br />
of the Committee are sufficiently broad to provide for a full scale<br />
enquiry into the problems of disposing of the Australian wool clip<br />
to the best advantage. If it should transpire however that they<br />
do not fully cover all matters of importance the Government will be<br />
prepared to look at them again.<br />
It is expected that the Cormmittee of Enquiry will have<br />
its first meeting early in February to consider the general arrangements<br />
for the conduct of the enquiry and the procedures to be adopted,<br />
including the taking of evidence.<br />
In view of the great national importance of this enquiry,<br />
having regard to the key role of wool in jur economy, I appeal to all<br />
organisatins and others concerned w4ith the outcome of the enquiry to<br />
co-operate fully with the Committee in the complex and arduous task<br />
ahead of it.<br />
