Prime Minister Julia Gillard will travel to Bali to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Bali bombings in 2002.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will be holding services both in Bali and Canberra on 12 October, with Their Excellencies the Governor-General Ms Quentin Bryce AC CVO and Mr Michael Bryce AM AE to lead the Canberra service.</p>
<p>Two hundred and two people died in the first Bali bombings, among them 88 Australians. Many more were severely injured.</p>
<p>It was a moment of horror that had a profound effect on Australia as a nation and on the lives of survivors and the family and loved ones of those who died.</p>
<p>Time has healed many of the physical wounds caused by the bombings but it can never diminish the sense of wrong we feel at this act of terror. Forgetting would be the ultimate injustice  -  and we will never forget.</p>
<p>This tenth anniversary will be an important moment of reflection and remembrance for all Australians, but especially for those touched directly by the senseless violence of 12 October 2002.</p>
<p>We also remember the many Indonesians and citizens of other countries killed in the bombings.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government will provide financial assistance to Australians who were seriously injured and to the families of the Australians who lost their lives in the 2002 bombings to help them attend either service. This will help cover the costs of flights, accommodation and ground transport, in line with the package provided for the first anniversary.</p>
<p>Further details on the assistance package and eligibility are available by calling the Bali hotline on 13 61 25. The hotline will operate Monday to Friday from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm.</p>
<p>The memorial service in Bali will be held at the Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park and the Canberra service will be held in the Great Hall of Parliament House.</p>
<p>The services will be open to all Australians and other nationalities who want to come together on this day.</p>
<p>Further details about both memorial services can be found at <a href="http://www.dfat.gov.au/bali-anniversary">www.dfat.gov.au/bali-anniversary</a>. Members of the general public and media wishing to attend either event are asked to register their details via this website.</p>
<p>Further details on the program for both commemorations will be released shortly. </p>
