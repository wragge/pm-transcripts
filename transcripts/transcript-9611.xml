TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW ON RADIO 5AN WITH KEITH CONLON, ADELAIDE<br />
JUNE 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
KC: Prime Minister, Paul Keating, good morning,<br />
PM: How are you Keith?<br />
KC: Good thanks what's the last station you passed, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: We just got on at Belair...<br />
KC: He's just checking now to see what's coming up, I guess.<br />
PM: Blackwood was the last one.<br />
KC: Okay you are well on your way. You are well on your way to Eden<br />
Hills. Are you actually doing a Ben Chifley...<br />
PM: Yes I'm at the wheel here. ( Toot toot). You can hear it.<br />
KC: Was that you blowing the whistle?<br />
PM: That was me. Whistle blowing Prime Minister, you see.<br />
KC: Absolutely. Tell me, did you take some tips from Tom Hopkins the<br />
103 year old train driver that surely you met, from Adelaide, in<br />
Melbourne?<br />
PM; That was his great dream, you see. He said it was the great dream of<br />
all railway people to see the country united with a single gauge. And<br />
this link this Is one of the key things in One Nation was to build this<br />
link between Melbourne and Adelaide, to pull -Adelaide and South<br />
Australia more... . to bind It In further with the Eastern States, and I think </p>
<p>T4E. L: J un. 95 22: 11 No. 008 P. 02<br />

that's what it will do. And it's quite a thrill to come and see this track<br />
sitting beside the wide gauge the standard gauge being more narrow.<br />
You can see It obviously out of the window here.<br />
KC: Yes. What sort of cost savings do you think it will represent<br />
eventually, Prime Minister?<br />
PM:-I think it does tremendous things for costs, in terms of containers. But<br />
the main thing Is mobility it will really mean that say, the port of<br />
Adelaide will be able to compete with the port of Melbourne. Ships can<br />
dock here, then load up on the train and move them to Melbourne and<br />
Sydney quickly, and it will change the nature of South Australia as the<br />
transport hub, and it gives South Australian industry... we're going<br />
through a tunnel here Keith -just a sec..<br />
KC: The noise level has gone up. The Prime Minister is going through the<br />
first of the tunnels on the way down, and we have lost him completely<br />
of course, because we are in the middle of the tunnel.<br />
PM: Are you there?<br />
KC: You're out again?<br />
PM:-Yeah we're out again. It gives South Australian industry a great<br />
chance to do things that bring products into Victoria, New South Wales<br />
and Queensland, and of course, to go across to the West. So that<br />
whole trans-continental traffic of goods, and particularly containers, will<br />
be now for the first time ever routed through Adelaide and<br />
Melbourne; Melbourne via Adelaide.<br />
KC: Talking about that transport hub, Mr Keating, surely you are going to<br />
get a question or two about the Alice Springs to Darwin extension any<br />
further interest in that?<br />
PM: I'm not sure that this is in South Australia's interests because we<br />
have just gone through Eden Hills station, just one second ( toot<br />
toot)<br />
KC: The Prime Minister is just waving to. you have got the whole of Eden<br />
Hills Primary School out there?<br />
PM: They're right here excuse me a sec...<br />
KC: Righto. We'll just let the Prime Minister attend to some formal waving<br />
duties now, as he goes past the Eden Hills Railway Station.<br />
PM: The Northern Territory have been talking about taking the line to<br />
Broken Hill, and then to Sydney, which of course would see the whole<br />
of the traffic by-passing South Australia. I think South Australia, with<br />

this change, is in the box seat. I don't really know why people believe<br />
that If we build a line up to Darwin, it will help Adelaide and South<br />
Australia. All it would simply do even if it routes through South<br />
Australia -is take the traffic to Melbourne, not coming through<br />
Adelaide. But if it goes via Broken Hill, you won't even see it. And why<br />
would somebody on a ship take a container to Adelaide, and then take<br />
it by rail to Melbourne, If they could drop it at Darwin?<br />
KC: Yes. Let's take a look at the next leap Prime Minister, because it has<br />
been a huge leap to get the standard line in. But as well as that,<br />
people In the transport game are grappling with this huge leap forward<br />
of seeing private freight trains how soon so you think that will be?<br />
PM: Our idea Laurie Brereton is on the train with me this morning our<br />
Idea Is to set the track up, and call it the Track Australia. The track will<br />
be owned by a company, and the railway locomotive.. we're just about<br />
to go through another tunnel in a sec, Keith...<br />
KC: Thanks very much Prime Minister...<br />
PM; The loco's will be owned by somebody else.<br />
KC: This is a longer tunnel, so we will hang on while you go in yep, he's<br />
gone. He's in the long tunnel now, and in a moment he will come out<br />
at Sleeps Hill1 that's naturally out towards the plain. Hello oh blimey,<br />
we have lost him. We will try and get, by the way, because he is in a<br />
very long tunnel at the moment, and it will take a second or two. We'll<br />
take news headlines, and see if we can get to the Prime Minister, who<br />
is shortly to come through Clapham on that first standard rail freight<br />
train.<br />
( news headlines)<br />
KC: On the train and out of the tunnel, Prime Minister Paul Keating,<br />
welcome back.<br />
PM: Well, the city has just come into view, It looks marvellous.<br />
KC: You would be heading towards Lynton Station and then next Clapham<br />
and you will really be on the suburban run now.<br />
PM: We have got one coming up now. There is a crossing so we have got<br />
to blow the horn ( toot, toot) to make sure that nobody is on it and there<br />
is a few people on the station and you are exactly right, it is Lynton<br />
station.<br />
KC: Can I just ask about the passenger head office, Prime Minister, there is<br />
now, of course, a national passenger system that you can get on now,<br />

the Indian Pacific and so on. Is there a chance Adelaide might be theI<br />
headquarters for that?<br />
PM: I think that is a possibility. I think, we can do a lot with the passengers<br />
across the country, but just before we went Into the tunnel, we were<br />
talking about Track Australia and, I think, people need to understand<br />
this. It is a very Important concept. The track Is owned by a single<br />
company and the company's business will be to keep the track going<br />
and then the railway operators National Rail, TNT, or Brambles or<br />
whoever wants to move freight can then hire a loco and pull freight<br />
around the country on the track. So, the track Is separated from the<br />
railway companies, so we get competition In rail and the railway<br />
companies and, I think, this would really give us a very good track, an<br />
even better track than we have got today, straighter, faster, better<br />
maintained, and I think that would do a great deal for South Australia.<br />
KC: Rail 2000, which Is a group here very Interested in the future of rail,<br />
wants more money put In. They say One Nation has been fantastic,<br />
but of course, that has come to the end now and It wants to see a<br />
continuing commitment to the rail network. Are you, in effect, giving<br />
that via this new Idea?<br />
PM: I think so. That is why you get Investment money back Into the track<br />
and, of course, as you know we have had so many deaths on the road<br />
by these big container trucks carrying containers when many of them<br />
should have been carried on rail, but the track has been so poor and,<br />
of course, between Melbourne and Adelaide you had to change<br />
bogies. We have had poor routing's, poor construction often in the<br />
first place, and then no maintenance for 20 or 30 years. So, the rail<br />
system has gone into disrepair over the last 30 or 40 years and I am<br />
pleased this government has been able to bring it back to life.<br />
KC: Prime Minister, you are going to get a lot more waving that you'll have<br />
to do as you go through these suburban stations. Where are you<br />
now?<br />
PM: We are just coming down to a crossing. We went through Lynton and<br />
we are just at a road crossing. Just one second.<br />
KC: That sounds like Mitchim coming UP.<br />
PM: Yes, we are just at Mitchim<br />
KC: OK, Prime Minister, thanks very much for your time today. We will let<br />
you get back to the driving duties. Is this the fulfilment of a lifetime<br />
ambition?<br />
PM: Well, Labor Governments are great building governments. People are<br />
saying ' are we having an election?' Well, I'd rather build a railway </p>
<p>4. Jun. 95 22: 11 No. 008<br />
around Australia than have an election, frankly. Get the job done, get<br />
the job over and a couple of weeks ago Keith, talking to you, I had the<br />
pleasure of talking about and announcing the road through the<br />
Adelaide Hills and I drove up on it today through that Devil's Elbow,<br />
straightening all that out, extending the airport and giving international<br />
carriage of passengers in here. So, we will end up, I think, having a<br />
much better linkage to South Australia by air, by road and by rail.<br />
KC: Much appreciate your time today. Thanks for taking the call on the<br />
train. ( toot, toot). What a suitable way to go out, with another blast of<br />
the freight train whistle.<br />
