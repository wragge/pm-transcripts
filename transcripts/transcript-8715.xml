STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KE. ATING, MP<br />
UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government and people, I warmly<br />
congratulate Governor Clinton on his election as President<br />
of the United States of America.<br />
Governor Clinton's great victory represents a clear mandate<br />
for renewal and change. The American people have attached<br />
great importance to this year's presidential election, as<br />
demonstrated by the very high voter turn-out. They have<br />
responded positively to Governor Clinton's call for revival<br />
of America's domestic strength as a prerequisite for<br />
competing in the global economy and exercising effective<br />
international leadership.<br />
It is important for Australia, and other members of the<br />
international community, that the United States be confident<br />
of its own strengths and values and sure of its role in the<br />
world. This is especially critical in this time of profound<br />
change in the international system.<br />
The Government is encouraged by the moderate and<br />
internationalist foreign policy stance that Governor Clinton<br />
articulated durinig t: he campaign. He affirmed strong support<br />
for the multilateral trading system.<br />
on the immediate agenda, Australia attaches high priority to<br />
an early and successful conclusion of the -Uruguay Round of<br />
multilateral trade negotiations, and hopes the incoming<br />
Administration will work hard in this direction.<br />
The Government looks forward to working closely with the new<br />
President and his Administration. At this time of change in<br />
US political leadership, a point of continuity will be the<br />
close ties of partnership and cooperation which Australia<br />
and the United States have enjoyed for over half a century.<br />
The Australian Government also pays its respects to<br />
President Bush's achievements over the last four years.<br />
The world will long remember his successful management of US<br />
foreign policy during the challenging period as the Cold War<br />
ended, and his very effective leadership of an international<br />
coalition in response to Iraq's aggression towards Kuwait.<br />
