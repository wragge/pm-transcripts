PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA28 MARCH 1989<br />
It is with regret that I announce that the Hon. Gary Punch,<br />
the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support,<br />
has decided to resign from the Ministry.<br />
I have recommended to the Governor-General that this<br />
resignation be accepted. I wish to take this opportunity to<br />
express my appreciation for the contribution 14r Punch has<br />
made as a member of the Government.<br />
I will be recommending to the Governor-General that the Hon.<br />

and Aviation Support. Consequential ministerial changes<br />
will be announced as soon as possible, following election by<br />
Caucus of a new member of the Ministry. L 0 ' JPO IJ 14 11U. UU. 3J r . U<br />
