    <content><![CDATA[<p>TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />PRESS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSI--<br />19 OCTOBER 1993<br />E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />Well, I think you now have some outline in the press statement I published last<br />night on the decision by the Cabinet in the settlament of the many issues<br />involved in the question of the High Courts historic decision and the awarding of<br />Native Title. And I think that it is fair to say that this legislation will put flesh on<br />the bones of the High Court decision, that it will provide a substantial measure of<br />justice for Aboriginal Australians, and importantly with that a security and an<br />efficient system of land management across the country.<br />As I said earlier this morning this is a new deal ror Australian Aborigines, and as<br />such, a new deal between the indigenous and non-indigenous people of this<br />country. The High Court made its judgement and we now have the chance of<br />legislating away the fiction of terra nullius, and basing our national social policy<br />with Aboriginal Islander people on a truth rather than a lie.<br />And from that, of course, will flow not just simply~ justice for Aboriginal people<br />and a system of land management that works in combination with Native Title,<br />but a better basis, a real basis, for reconciliation that in the past has eluded us.<br />Because land is at the heart of Aboriginal dispo'ssession and the repossession<br />of land must be at the heart of any process of reconciliation in the future.<br />I think this process has created a new understanding between, certainly the<br />Government, but the Australian people, I feel and the Aboriginal community. I<br />would like to pay a tribute here to the Aborigine l leadership under Lois<br />O'Donoghue who did the courageous thing, took the step, seized the moment to<br />negotiate rather than demand, and to sit down and work out where Aboriginal<br />interests truly lie and where they could be offset against the legitimate economic<br />interests of this country. And in doing that we have been, I think, able to reach a<br />good settlement.<br />i / TO'd Å SO'ON S : 9T 16' 13O6T : 131</p>
<p>Now, as well uppermost in the Governments mind has been the interests of<br />Aboriginal people in being able to secure and work land, but also there has been<br />the requirement to see our great land based industries be able to go on as they<br />have in the past, to be able to access land, to cJ3rry out exploration and mining,<br />in the case of the mining industry, for grants of interests in relation to the<br />pastoral industry, or the tourism industry, or commercial development, that we<br />have a system here now which can happen within reasonably tight time frames<br />in processes which are exclusively with the States and ones where the States!<br />imperatives in land management, I think, are being met. From the States' point<br />of view their interest has been to see that past grants were valid, past grants that<br />they issued were capable of being validated, and that there was a workable<br />system for issuing new grants of interest over Native Title land in the future and<br />at the same time giving Aboriginal people a right to be asked a genuine right of<br />negotiation, but in the end the rights of the Statios to make decisions in the State<br />interest, in the State interest on what they think is viable in terms of their interest<br />in land and development.<br />But this is a Native Title Bill. The primacy of the, interests are with the title<br />holders, those people who can make claims, who would wish to make claims and<br />have Native Title awarded and protected. And the Bill therefore therefore the<br />primacy of the Bill goes to Aboriginal and Islanicer peoples interests. But it has<br />that happy mix, I think, between those interests and the interests of the rest of<br />the country, both in social and economic terms. And I think it does prove that<br />the cynics are not always right in thinking that differences here were<br />Irreconcilable, that there was no basis upon which a various interest could be<br />accommodated in relative harmony, in a package which could be agreed by the<br />various stake holders. Now, I think that has not been true and I think the<br />sceptics will have to think again, and if it means that access to land does<br />something, if late in the piece, about justice for Aboriginal people and their<br />inclusion in the laws of this country, in respect oif land in our greater society then<br />we will go along together as one country, as onia nation. And that's a core part<br />of what Mabo, I think, means.<br />Can I also say that I think it was important that the High Court in having made<br />this decision wasn't hung out to dry by the Parliament. That is, prestige was not<br />put under question, and that a decision well takan and courageously taken was<br />supported by the Government. There has been more ministerial time devoted to<br />this issue than any issue in the last ten years, and without that detailed work it<br />wouldn't be possible to develop a Bill of this sophistication, and without this<br />sophistication it wouldn't be possible to introduce this sort of legislation. It<br />wouldn't settle the issues without this sort of soph isti cation, and I may not have<br />another opportunity, but I want to place on the record the work done by the<br />officers of our Commonwealth public service, the officers in my department,<br />Prime Minister and Cabinet, Sandy Hollway, Mike Dillon, Robert Orr and others<br />who have worked tirelessly and ceaselessly now for over a year on this problem,<br />1/ 20Od Å SO* ON SS: 9T1 6* 130' 6T : 131</p>
<p>and who had previously worked on the reply to the Aboriginal Deaths in Custody<br />Royal Commission. They have been now working consistently on these issues<br />for a couple of years. So, I should like to take the opportunity to thank them, and<br />also those State Premiers who could see something bigger and something better<br />and tried to see what could be done to meet both the Commonwealth, the State<br />and the Aboriginal and Islander interest in this country, and those State officials<br />who were also involved in negotiation who tried and have materially in some<br />ways made the Bill a better Bill then it could have otherwise been. So, I might<br />leave my introductory remarks there and invite cuestions.<br />J: Can you explain the situation where you have got valid l ' eases, the<br />situation you talked about yesterday? Will Aborigines still be able to<br />dedicate their so called residual rights for the residual Native Title lots, or<br />have they been extinguished as well?<br />PM: Well, Tom, if Aboriginal people have given up residual rights on invalid<br />leases, and they have, in a sense why woiuld they bother on valid leases?<br />I think that is the question, that is, the key word here is valid, and the<br />validity will, I think, extinguish to all intents and purposes any rights other<br />than those of the pastoralists, or any other stake holder.<br />J: Will the Aborigines be able to use .( inaudible)<br />PM: Well the legal force of the Act will remain. I think the Act remains<br />unblemished. But how applicable it is to any of this is a moot point. I<br />mean, that's a matter really for Aboriginal people and their lawyers. I<br />can't see any application here because o'jr Bill, as I say, emanates from<br />the RDA and I don't think crosses any of its principles.<br />J: So, Prime Minister, it's the precedent of post 75 RDA validation that<br />protects pre ' 75 valid leases?<br />PM: Say that again.<br />J-It's the precedent of post 75 RDA validatio~ n by the Federal Government<br />which effectively protects pre ' 75 valid lealses?<br />PM: I have got no doubt councel for the defence would certainly argue that.<br />J: ( inaudible)<br />PM: Yes, I had a very positive phone call with Jeff Kennett this morning, and I<br />think that you will find that the States believe that this does provide a<br />workable basis of land management simply because the key institutions<br />are theirs. There won't be a Commonweotlth institution granting interest<br />;/ VO~ d Å SO'ON Si: 9T 16* 13O* 6T : 131</p>
<p>over Native Title land other than the ACT Commonwealth Tribunal, and<br />the ACT and Commonwealth lands, or that which would operate in a noncooperating<br />State. But for cooperating States there won't be a<br />Commonwealth Tribunal granting interest over Native Title land. So, all<br />the economic use side of the legislation is with the States. And we have<br />kept their structures, we have even kept to their wishes about just terms<br />being paid only on extinguishment and nct in any other terms, that is, for<br />any disturbance or disfigurement of the landscape. In all these key areas<br />the mining warden still remains, reconfigured, but remains as a key thing.<br />There will be a State ministerial override available if States wish to<br />exercise it. Of course they will have to do it with due caution, but it is, I<br />think, a real one. So, from the States' point of view they should regard the<br />thing as reasonable. As also particular caitegories of grants will be able to<br />be excluded from the special legislation. That is, the special negotiation<br />regime. They will have to be negotiated, hat is, those that can go ahead<br />without a process of negotiation which will keep the system lubricated,<br />compulsory acquisitions will still be available. it will apply to Native Title<br />land except where the acquisition is in order to make a grant to a third<br />party, there will be a negotiating period for that. But the the normal<br />acquisition right will obtain over Native Title land as freehold land, as I<br />say, compensation for impairment will be set in an accordance with<br />current State Territory procedures. So, from the States' point of view, and<br />of course, the Commonwealth will meet a large part of the compensation<br />for the period of validation ' 75 to ' 93. That is, all those interests which<br />would have been rendered invalid by the Racial Discrimination Act, or the<br />interaction of that Act with Native Title, wo will establish a regime there.<br />Existing Crown ownership of the sources can be confirmed, and access to<br />beaches, waterways, recreation areas can be confirmed to.<br />J: Prime Minister, what changed the position that you held in Question Time<br />yesterday from what we now have as the final position in regard to valid<br />title?<br />PM: Well, I told the Aboriginal people with whom I negotiated last week that I<br />would argue a case for them that there may be residual rights, however<br />slim, attaching to some of the leases invalidated because of the<br />interaction of the Racial Discrimination Act, Native Title or in relation to<br />the interaction of other Acts. And in argu:" ng that case I understood that it<br />meant that for those lease holders that thray may face some action.<br />Regardless of their likelihood of success they may have faced them. And<br />then last evening in negotiations with the Aboriginal community said well<br />maybe it is possible to consider a way where there is a greater Aboriginal<br />community benefit from a more certain set of rights then the slender set of<br />rights, the uncertain set of rights which might flow from Native Title rights<br />which were not inconsistent with a grant ini invalid leases. And so the<br />/ ZOd S900' N S : 9T Å 6* 130O6T ' 131</p>
<p>proposal we arrived at war, one where past oral leases are owned by<br />Aboriginal people, and there are many of them owned by Aboriginal<br />people, or acquired by Aboriginal people that is, for the future as well.<br />That if those holders can demonstrate a trgiditional linkage with the fand<br />under the Mabo principles we will turn it into, they will be able at the<br />Tribunal, or at the Federal Court to pick up a title equivalent to Native<br />Title. Now, I think this is very attractive for many Aboriginal people,<br />because as you know there are pastoral leases all over the country, they<br />own many and will have the opportunity of buying more and this gives<br />them a certain title and a certain access. And bearing in mind also that<br />the Commonwealth 2S part of this package is developing a land<br />acquisition fund of substance, some of those funds could conceivably be<br />employed in a acquiring pastoral leases which could then become Native<br />Title areas. So, considering, in their terms, the slender rights and<br />uncertain rights which may have obtained with invalid leases, they've<br />bargained something in return which they think is more certain and more<br />valuable. In that case, equity has been mot, justice has been done and<br />honour has been settled and a reasonable agreement has been made.<br />J: On page three of your statement you talk e bout the invalid leases<br />( inaudible)... before 1975 ( inaudible).., rights as yet unidentified in<br />law. And then you go on in the next paragraph to talk about, " The Bill will<br />provide that any leases which might be found to be invalid, in any<br />circumstances connected with native title, ican be validated." Does that<br />mean that they have to go to the Court firsi. to identify them or..?<br />PM: No. That means that the states can validla~ e them. See, we don't validate<br />the leases, the states do. But they've got to get the legislative authority<br />from the Commonwealth, via the RDA ( Racial Discrimination Act), to<br />actually effect the validations in a way which is not ultra vires of the RDA.<br />And it is the states who will be doing the validating and they will be able<br />to validate leases which, for one reason or another, may have become<br />invalid due to the interaction of the RDA or other Acts.<br />J: So it won't be required to be tested at law first?<br />PM: No.<br />J: When the bill provides for the states to val date those leases and where it<br />provides for extinguishment of native title will there be retrospective<br />procedural fairness provisions built into that, how will they work and what<br />safeguards will there be at the end of the clay?<br />PM: Well, under the special measures provision the Commonwealth will be<br />validating the titles and paying compensation. So, therefore, because the<br />iSO~ d SO* ON S9-: 9T Å-6* 13O* 6T -131</p>
<p>Bill emanates from the RDA and its authority the question about<br />procedural fairness, in a sense, does not arise. And there has always<br />boon some very grave legal doubt about whether procedural fairness ever<br />mattered. The preponderance of legal opinion would be that there was<br />not a racially discriminatory thing done by a land manager when that land<br />manager could never have known that native title existed; and that the<br />payment of compensation was sufficient tD actually validate a past title.<br />J: Has that been another concession by the Aborigines over the past few<br />days?<br />PM: Well, I think they understood implicitly thait the concession was, in a<br />sense, from the Government. That is, thsit we would employ the RDA<br />rather than in any way circumscribe or override it, and validate using its<br />authority.<br />J: Mr Keating, the deal you've worked out with Aboriginal people on pastoral<br />leases so that you can extinguish native title there why haven't you<br />done a similar deal for mining leases?<br />PM: Because a mining lease is the one variety of lease which does not<br />extinguish non Aboriginal title. A mining lease can be laid over non<br />Aboriginal title and when the mining ceases, the title revives.<br />J: But you said pastoral leases didn't extingu~ ish either<br />PM: The thing is, this is not so with other forms of title. But the symmetry here<br />is that a mining title does lie across other forms of non Aboriginal title and<br />the other forms of non Aboriginal title come back to full bloom, or are<br />capable of coming back to full bloom, whon the mining ceases. That is<br />the principle which is being established.<br />J: Is the land acquisition fund now part of this legislative package or is that<br />coming with the social justice package?<br />PM: It will be mentioned in the Bill, certainly th~ e second reading speech and, I<br />think, the Bill. But the development of it will come in a second piece of<br />legislation in the Autumn session of next year. So that there will be a<br />process of negotiation with the Aboriginal community who will then, with<br />the government, sit down and try and design a set of arrangements where<br />the control and the functions and the objectives of such a fund can be<br />reasonably met or successfully met. But Aboriginal and Islander<br />people will know, when the second reading speech on the native title Bill<br />is given and the Bill is introduced, that tha~ t will be an integral part of it<br />SO* ON S2: 9T 16* 130' 6T : 131</p>
<p>7<br />though it will not have been fleshed out ir substance, that is, in terms of<br />design.<br />J: Did you get last night from the Aborigines, agreement on these last<br />minute alterations in the package<br />PM: Yes. I met the same group that I had met the previous week, last evening<br />for probably an hour and a half, on and off. And we considered all these<br />issues, considered the weight of Aboriginal community interests and<br />where they lie when a lot of the claims go, about the probable success of<br />litigation, down to what people really think: they could secure vis a yis<br />what was likely to be offered. And that's when, I think, those judgements<br />were made.<br />J: Once rural land has been acquired, Primet Minister, and converted to<br />native title, it will then be the case that it can never be sold again?<br />PM: Well, I think the thing about native title is that government can acquire it;<br />it can be surrendered: but it will, I think, in the hands of the Aboriginal<br />community, probably be in perpetuity.<br />J: So, no matter how badly the property is run, no matter how badly run<br />down it becomes unlike existing farmland where, when things go wrong<br />it just stays on as it is?<br />PM; Well, I don't think you should assume.... tis is true with non Aboriginal<br />holdings across Australia, David. A lot of farms are over grazed or poorly<br />managed or where there is acute soil eronion this is not something<br />which would be a feature of Aboriginal holdings. In fact, I should imagine<br />that given the success which Aboriginal people are having in managing<br />land and getting even better at it and understanding the value of land<br />management that they'll make pastoral properties succeed. But there<br />is also the other thing these are lands which will be traditional lands,<br />which, of course, have other values and cither connotations to them. So it<br />has, if you like, a dual function of meeting a social need as well as an<br />economic need. And my assumption is tleat Aboriginal people, given the<br />opportunities to manage pastoral properties and they've had now some<br />substantial ones can do it and do it well.<br />J: Prime Minister, given that the farmers of Western Australia have an<br />absolute right of veto over development, would you envisage in this<br />passage that native title holders in Western Australia would have the<br />same right? And if Western Australia does not come to the party in this,<br />which it does not appear that they're going to, would native title holders in<br />Western Australia who are dealing througih a Commonwealth regime have<br />Å SO* ON S2: 9T 16-430O61 : 131</p>
<p>the same right to get equity of rights with freehold farmers in Western<br />Australia?<br />PM: Well that's a matter, I think, of legal opinion. I don't think we're certain<br />about that. And, of course, Western Australia could make it certain by<br />removing a veto right in the hands of non Aboriginal pastoralists. In which<br />case there would be no discrimination. But again, the authorities of this<br />Bill vis a vis the states, it's hard to say where the balance of that lies. I<br />wouldn't assume, and I don't think I would say, that the presence of a veto<br />right in the hands of Western Australian pastoralists will mean, ipso facto,<br />that such a right exists in the hands of a native title holder. In fact, I think<br />I would say the converse. But again, it will be a matter for legal opinion<br />and also a matter for the state of Western Australia itself.<br />J: Prime Minister, you said this was a good deal for the states. Have you<br />got any idea how many state Premiers will come on board now?<br />PM: Well, I spoke to Premiers Goss and Fahey late last week. I've spoken to<br />Premier Kennett, I think, last week and again today and when I have an<br />opportunity I'll speak to other State and Territory leaders today. Look, I<br />think that the negotiations at the Commonwealth bureaucratic level and<br />the state bureaucracies, about these issues, has helped put into focus the<br />states' bottom lines on land management. We've been able to see what<br />of that we can accommodate and what we can't. The great bulk of it has<br />been accommodated. And I think that whsan they look through the Bill, a<br />state land manager will say, " By and large, my prerogatives here, are met.<br />The economic, the land management prerogatives here, are met."<br />But at the same time, met in a way which gives Aboriginal people a right<br />to be asked about their property and a right to be involved in a real<br />negotiation, not just a perfunctory one. Not a courtesy but a real<br />negotiation. And in that, in maintenance of these state instrumentalities<br />and state systems I should think most stales will find it an acceptable<br />package. And particularly as the Commonwealth is prepared to meet a<br />substantial part of the cost.<br />J: Mr Keating, have you had any discussions with the Greens or the<br />Democrats on this, so far? And do you think it will get through the<br />Senate?<br />PM: Well, I've had a couple of discussions with them over the last two or three<br />months. And the last discussion I had wit i them was in the company of<br />Aboriginal representatives about two weeks ago. Two to three weeks<br />ago. I've not since, but I believe they're committed to the same principles<br />in this respect, that we are and that they wish to see an honourable<br />Å SO'ON SÅ: 9T Å 6' 10 ' 6T : 131</p>
<p>package fashioned here. One that does justice for Aboriginal interests<br />but, at the same time, works. And so that is why I'm confident that the Bill<br />will pass through both houses.<br />J, You said on the last page of this statement that greater recognition will be<br />given to the value of regional and local negotiations. How will you<br />facilitate those?<br />PM: Well it depends on how we wish to develop them and what prospects of<br />success they would have. That is, whether or not regional agreements<br />can be made as is the case in Canada and other places. We're at<br />least leaving that opportunity open. In some very obvious and discrete<br />areas of the country such agreements might be made. Even though there<br />is a patchwork quilt of titles there are vent common threads to some of<br />these titles and, therefore it may be possible to enter into regional<br />agreements.<br />J: Are you confident that the legislation will actually get through this year, Mr<br />Keating?<br />PM: Well, I am Laura, yes. I think it will proceed this year and I think it's<br />important that it does.<br />J: Prime Minister, did you give any commitments to the Aboriginal<br />representatives on the level of the funding; for the land acquisition fund<br />and do you have any Idea of the ball park estimate on the compensation<br />package?<br />PM: No, I can't go to that. That's something that the Cabinet has to consider.<br />But it will be a substantial fund and it will b2e a revolving fund. That is, a<br />proportion of it will be capable, a proportion of Commonwealth<br />subventions will be capable of being sperit on land acquisition but a<br />portion will probably I say probably he reserved for a revolving fund<br />so that the earnings base of the fund becomes, over time, the proceeds of<br />the fund. It goes on in perpetuity. And, in such a way there would be a<br />reasonable chance of success of it becoming a major acquirer and holder<br />of Aboriginal property.<br />J: Mr Keating is the Commonwealth.... .( inaudlible).... compensation for the<br />extinguishing of native title even where states may not agree to the<br />Commonwealth legislation?.<br />PMV: No. If a state does not agree, a state has 1: 0o validate, but in validating it<br />has to pay compensation. You see, these leases are state leases. These<br />titles are state titles, not Commonwealth titles. The validations are to be<br />7/ 6O* d Å 900N Si: 9T 16-13O-6T : 131</p>
<p>done now with the Commonwealth legislative authority, by the states. But<br />if they are not in our scheme and cooperating then the compensation will<br />be met by them.<br />J: Will you be expecting Mr Court to come on board with this?<br />( inaudible)...<br />PM: Well, I spoke to him and I think he's coming over this week. But I have<br />had no indication from him that he believes that Crown title should be,<br />should fall to a native title claim. He doesn't believe that native title<br />should be issued over Crown land. He believes the only titles that<br />Aboriginal people should have should be statutory titles conferred on<br />them. He believes that a conferred right is fine, but an inherent right isn't.<br />Now, its pretty hard from my position to argue with that because it's<br />diametrically opposed to what Mabo stands for.<br />But, again, I think he's got to consider thi: 3 in terms of the land<br />management questions for his state. Because we've certainly considered<br />it for Western Australia. We've taken fully into account that much of this<br />variety of land is in Western Australia and that the interests of Western<br />Australian industry that is mining, commercial, pastoral need to be<br />taken into account and we have taken threm into account, though we have<br />not had a meaningful dialogue with the state government. But one<br />doesn't need a meaningful dialogue with t: he state government to<br />understand what some of its core interests are, so we've got them in<br />there. But, in having very meaningful discussions with the rest of the<br />states I'm pretty sure that what they regard as core interests, are anyway,<br />the core interests of any Western Australian government and Western<br />Australian people. So, I think the Western Australian community ought to<br />be assured that the Commonwealth has very much had in its mind, its<br />interest, in framing this legislation.<br />J: Is there a message for the Opposition, Mr Keating?<br />PM: Well, I think that the one message for the Opposition is that they have<br />now consistently failed to be part of any negotiation. A number of<br />business organisations invited the leader of the Opposition as long as ten<br />or eleven weeks ago to join the Government in this matter. No response<br />has come. In the meantime Mr Reith has been appointed to basically do<br />to the Mabo legislation what he thinks he was successfully able to do to<br />the four year parliamentary term referendums. Now, Mr Reith was one of<br />the architects of Fightback! and Fightback was a dismal political failure<br />and I think that his tactics on Mabo have been a dismal political failure,<br />too.<br />Ends.<br />./ OT'd Å SO* DN S: 9T Å 6* 30* 6T:-131</p>
