FOR MEDIA 25 JANUARY 1989<br />
The Government has appointed Mr WGT Miller to be the next<br />
Director-General of the Office of National Assessments. The<br />
appointment will-be for a five year term from 24 April 1989.<br />
Mr Miller is currently Australian Ambassador to Japan, where<br />
he has been stationed since August 1986. He also served as<br />
Ambassador in Seoul from 1978-80 and had earlier postings in<br />
Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, New York and New Delhi. He has held<br />
senior positions in the Department of Foreign Affairs in<br />
Canberra, as Deputy Secretary from 1984-86, and previously<br />
as First Assistant Secretary in charge of North and South<br />
Asia and Defence and Nuclear Divisions. Throughout 1982, Mr<br />
Miller was seconded to the Department of the Prime Minister<br />
and Cabinet as First Assistant Secretary, International<br />
Division. Mr Miller will be the third Director-General of the Office<br />
of National Assessments. The Office was established in 1977<br />
to upgrade and co-ordinate Australia's capacity for<br />
assessment of international matters of national importance.<br />
The Government pays tribute to the retiring Director-General<br />
Mr MJ Cook ( whose appointment as Australian Ambassador to<br />
Washington is being announced by the Minister for Foreign<br />
Affairs and Trade). I take this opportunity to record the<br />
valuable contribution Mr Cook has made during his seven and<br />
half year term in that important Office. </p>
