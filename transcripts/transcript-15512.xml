    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government will provide up to $26.8 million for a new school to replace the current Amberley State School in Queensland. </p>
<p>This funding commitment will enable a new school to be built for 330 students and to provide out of school care for 60 students, and is subject to the Queensland Government advising the Australian Government of where the new school will be located.</p>
<p>Moving the school was necessary as a result of $500 million in capital works to expand the RAAF Base Amberley.</p>
<p>This means that the site of the existing Amberley State School will no longer be suitable for a school.</p>
<p>I am keen to ensure that students at the school are provided with a new school in a suitable location.</p>
<p>This has been an uncertain time for students, parents and the school community, and I thank them for participating in consultation process.</p>
<p>I also acknowledge the efforts of Cameron Thompson MP who has worked tirelessly with the Amberley school community and the Department of Defence to ensure this successful outcome.</p>
<p>My Government looks forward to the transfer at no cost to Defence of the existing school site and buildings which will eventually be contained within the perimeter security fencing for the base</p>
<p>The funding for the new school is in addition to the capital works already planned for RAAF Base Amberley.  </p>
<p>This investment is bringing important economic benefits to Queensland and to the Ipswich region in particular.  </p>
