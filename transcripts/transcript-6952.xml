PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH TERRY WILLESEE 11 JUNE 1986<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
WILLESEE: Mr Hawke thanks for your time.<br />
PM: my pleasure Terry.<br />
WILLESEE: Mr Hawke, you addressed the nation earlier tonight in<br />
your shirt sleeves. Was that symbolic?<br />
PM: No, it is the way I usually am in my office.<br />
WILLESEE: It wasn't preplanned?<br />
PM: No, I feel more comfortable that way in my office. That is<br />
the way I always am there and it seemed the most appropriate way<br />
of doing it.<br />
WILLESEE: I just thought, given with your pep-talk, to get us<br />
all going that might have been a down to work<br />
PM: If that is a bonus of the way I appeared so much the better<br />
Terry. WILLESEE: Right. You called for, amongst other things and we<br />
will come to those hopefully, you called for us all to buy<br />
Australian. How far should we take that?<br />
PM: As far as it is absolutely possible. I-think one of the<br />
problems about some of us in Australia is that we don't realise<br />
how good we are. We tend, some of us I think, to assume that<br />
because it is made overseas it is better. And that generally is<br />
not the case. What we have got to understand is that if we are<br />
going to give our Australian industry the best chance of<br />
competing overseas we have got to give them as big a base as<br />
possible. And certainly by buying Australian goods, we are going<br />
to help our current account problems. And we are going to help<br />
our employment situation.<br />
WILLESEE: Mr Hawke, what would you say to people-who-can af ford<br />
it, perhaps executives across Australia who are driving foreign<br />
cars? </p>
<p>2<br />
Pm: I would say " Buy Australian". We make great cars. Let me<br />
give you an example. The quality of Australian cars has improved<br />
so much that we are now having decisions made by the<br />
multi-national companies that they want to export the Australian<br />
product back into their home area. Ford for instance, is now<br />
going to be exporting its car into America. From Japan, they are<br />
importing now, more components made in Australia. The quality of<br />
the Australian product has improved that much that that is the<br />
judgement that these corporations are making about Australian<br />
products.<br />
WILLESEE: Are things so serious that perhaps those executives<br />
should trade their imported cars in right now, or should they<br />
wait? PM: I would much prefer to see them, with the rest of the<br />
community, making immediate decisions to buy Australians.<br />
WILLESEE: Have you considered how you will go about buying more<br />
Australian products?<br />
PM: Since I have been in, I have had an Australian car and I<br />
will continue to do that. And I will be trying to set an<br />
example. Where I have got the choice between buying Australian<br />
and buying overseas I will be going Australian.<br />
WILLESEE: With a government department, will they be instructed<br />
to buy Australian?<br />
PM: If you look at the complete statement that I have put out<br />
tonight, we go to that. We are going to be looking at the whole<br />
question of government purchasing so that we can do as much as we<br />
can. As a Federal Government, we will be asking the States to do<br />
the same to buy Australian where they possibly can, Obviously,<br />
in some areas, particularly in the defence area, there are<br />
some things that are simply not available, not made in Australia.<br />
But as far as possible, government will be doing what we are<br />
asking Australian citizens to do.<br />
WILLESEE: Mir Hawke, we are starting to get reaction to your<br />
speech tonight and we have a recorded interview with Mr Bob<br />
Ansett, the business leader. And we would like to have a look at<br />
his reaction to your speech earlier this evening.<br />
ANSETT: We have a system that has slowed down because, the<br />
economic system has slowed because there are no longer the<br />
rewards for people to invest and to build businesses and to<br />
manufacture so that we can export. And no matter what we<br />
want to exhort about buying Australian, there are less and<br />
less Australian goods to buy. The only solution is to<br />
provide the rewards for business to invest. And I am not<br />
talking just large business. I am talking about the 600,000<br />
small businesses who really are our future in this country.<br />
And I am afraid that the prescription that we heard tonight<br />
is not going to help in this regard. </p>
<p>3<br />
WILLESEE: Mr Hawke, what is your reaction?<br />
PM: First of all, I would say to Bob to look at the record.<br />
Under this Government the profitability of Australian business<br />
has been restored to the highest level since the end of the<br />
sixties. And that has been because of a combination of the<br />
policy decisions made by my Government and by the co-operation<br />
that has been given by the Australian community, including the<br />
Australian business community and the Australian trade unions.<br />
You can't ignore the facts, that is the very, very significant<br />
increase in profitability. That is what has happened. What we<br />
want to do is to help Australian business by the macro-economic<br />
environment, what we are saying about wages. And we also want to<br />
help Australian business by arranging particular decisions in the<br />
investment area, which we have made 150 per cent tax deduction<br />
in regard to research and development, one of the most generous<br />
systems in the world that we have brought in. And particularly,<br />
I want to help Mr Ansett and the Australian business community by<br />
getting my fellow Australians to say, before they made a<br />
decision, let's buy Australian.<br />
WILLESEE: Mr Hawke, you gave us in part a pep-talk, that is the<br />
impression I got, I may be wrong but that is the feeling I got<br />
from it, that it was in part a pep-talk?<br />
PM: In part it was, yes.<br />
WILLESEE: And once again the workers were asked to tighten their<br />
belts. But Mr Hawke, some don't have any notches left on their<br />
belts? PM: Let me say this there are 700,000 more with a belt, if I<br />
can put it that way. 700,000 new jobs as a result of the<br />
policies of this Government since we have been in office. The<br />
highest rate of employment growth in the history of this country.<br />
So that is the first thing I say, there are more people in work.<br />
And what I want to make sure is that as a result of the policies<br />
of my Government and the co-operation of the Australian business<br />
and trade union community, that we are going to continue to put<br />
more people into work. We have got a very simple choice, Terry,<br />
in regard to what the world has done in terms of what they are<br />
paying for our exports. The Australian economy will adjust in<br />
one way or another. It can adjust by a co-operative approach of<br />
the sort I am talking which will mean that we can keep growth<br />
going, keep creating jobs, or we can refuse to exercise the<br />
restraint and the economy will adjust then by rapidly declining<br />
exchange, rate burgeoning interest rates, lower employment and<br />
stagnant growth. And what we are saying as a Government, it is<br />
much more sensible that we exerc-i-se--restraint, recognise the factthat<br />
the world by what it is giving us for our export products<br />
has marked our national capacity down by three per cent. We<br />
can't ignore that, it is a fact. </p>
<p>WILLESEE: But what about those who can't tighten that belt<br />
anymore? PM: As far as our social welfare policies are concerned, we will<br />
attempt to ensure that the most needy in this community are not<br />
disadvanted. I think that is what society recognises as<br />
reasonable and certainly what the Government recognises as<br />
reasonable. commercial break<br />
WILLESEE: Welcome back to TWT and with us live from Canberra is<br />
the Prime Minister Mr Hawke. Mr Hawke, I would like to get your<br />
reaction, you mentioned in your speech tonight about putting the<br />
unemployed to work in a part-time capacity in the community,<br />
community programs. We have the reaction of Colleen Chesterton<br />
from the Australian Council of Social Services.<br />
CHESTERTON: I don't think it is workable for the unemployed.<br />
Let's face it, unemployed people whether old or young, want<br />
a full-time job. The Government has moved in this direction<br />
by introducing things like traineeships, like the Community<br />
Employment Program. Those, at least, were trying to give<br />
people some structured employment and training experience.<br />
But now we are told that they can get this sort of experience<br />
by just working for a couple of days a week unpaid. Now, I<br />
believe that unemployed people will feel that if they are<br />
good enough to be employed, they are good enough to be paid<br />
for it.<br />
WILLESEE: Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: Let me say this to Colleen and to your viewers. We are<br />
still spending more money, Terry, on the sort of programs to<br />
which Colleen refers the traineeships program, a whole range of<br />
training programs to try and give that experience to which she<br />
refers. I say again that we have created 700,000 new jobs<br />
record growth and we are going to continue to create jobs.<br />
Unfortunately, that still leaves a large number of people who are<br />
not employed or can't participate in these programs. And all I<br />
can is that if my experience in Priority One earlier this year<br />
and the end of last was that these people are saying sure, if<br />
we can't get jobs and we know that there can't be jobs for<br />
everyone at this stage, we would like to do something for, and<br />
with, and in the community rather than just getting the<br />
unemployment benefit. So that is what we are about. I think<br />
they want to be able to do something than just receive the<br />
unemployment benefit. I think the community wants it, so in a<br />
co-operative way, that is the situation we are going to try and<br />
r-ingabout. But I want to assure-Colleen that there is not only<br />
no diminution of what we are doing in the other areas, there is<br />
an increase. </p>
<p>WILLESEE: Prime Minister, we have a reaction also from the<br />
Queensland Premier, Sir Joh Bjekle-Petersen, so let's have a look<br />
at that. PETERSEN: He gave no hope and I feel sorry for the people of<br />
this nation. No incentive, no encouragement as far as he and<br />
his Government was concerned. You know, the massive<br />
spending, the high taxes, the high interest rates. And then<br />
to have the hide and the audacity plus the other things to<br />
say to people you have got to work harder, you have got to<br />
produce more, you have got to give us more money. He talked<br />
in terms of cutting the Public Service. He is the one that<br />
has created 400 times more public servants in his time than<br />
we have in Queensland, for example. And so he has gone from<br />
catastrophe to catastrophe. And he expects and says that the<br />
people are responsbile. We are all in it, we have all got to<br />
do something. He and his Government and their policies have<br />
created this situation and now he is asking you and me to<br />
bear the burden of their mistakes, and it is just not on.<br />
WILLESEE: Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: Just two things about Sir Joh. Firstly, Sir Joh should<br />
really come and talk to the people of Australia about economic<br />
performance because the economic statistics which have been put<br />
out in fact by the Liberal Party in Queensland, not by the Labor<br />
Party, show that the worst economic performance of any State in<br />
Australia is the Queensland performance under Sir John. Don't<br />
rely on me saying that. The Liberal Party in Queensland is<br />
saying it is the worst performance. So he is not the one to<br />
talk. Secondly, I am glad that Sir Joh talked about massive<br />
government spending. We will give him the opportunity on Friday<br />
of this week, in Canberra at the Premiers' Conference to<br />
participate in the reduction in government spending. And I am<br />
sure now from his observations that he will co-operate.<br />
WILLESEE: Mr Hawke you mentioned, just finally we are running<br />
out of time, the spirit. Were you trying to capture the spirit<br />
that we had in the times of the America's Cup by naming those..<br />
PM: What I was trying to say was that I think one of the beaut<br />
features of Australia is the way in which, right across the<br />
board, we do take great pride properly, not only of our<br />
international prominent sportsmen and women, but also I mentioned<br />
Joan Sutherland right at the top of the tree. Now, all I am<br />
saying is that I want us to get the same sense of excitement and<br />
shared participation when Australian firms, doing as many of them<br />
are doing, competing against the best in the world and winning.<br />
That is the sort of same spirit that we have got to get becaewe<br />
can do it there.<br />
WILLESEE: Mr Hawke thank you very much for your time this<br />
evening. PM: Thank you Terry.<br />
ends </p>
