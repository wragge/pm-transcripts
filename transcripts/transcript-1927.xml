DEATH OF SIR NORMAN BROOKES<br />
Tribute by the Prime Minister, Mr john Gorton<br />
Sir Norman Brookes was one of those rare men<br />
who become a legend in their own lifetime. His name has been a<br />
household word synonymous with sporting achievement for as long as<br />
most Australians can remember.<br />
His skill as a tennis player helped establish<br />
Australia's sporting reputation, and he continued to make a contribution<br />
to sport throughout his long life. He was an outstanding Australian whose<br />
efforts in many fields will long be remembered.<br />
I extend my deepest sympathy to Dame Mabel and<br />
other members of the family.<br />
