0 PECH BY THE PRIME MINIjTTR TH RTI HON.<br />
R. G. IMNZI3, C. H C. M. P. AT DENDIGO ON TUJDAY, THE<br />
12TH JULY, 9j60<br />
Sir, Senator, candidate nnd ladies and gentlemen:<br />
I always know that there is an election on when I come<br />
here -because they always send me here. Sometimes I see the same<br />
faces; and sometimes I don't. But tonight I am delighted t' 4 find<br />
what, in my experience, must be a record attendance, supporting a<br />
record candidate. ( Applause)<br />
S Some of those who have been listening in tonight will have<br />
h d him for a few minutes at the end of his speech. I nm sorry<br />
that they couldn't have heard him longer, because I think that<br />
anybody who sees him, hears him and, as you do, knows him and his<br />
work and his quality, must agree that Bendigo has . n opportunity<br />
of the first quality in this by-election.<br />
I am of course very sorry, personally, that there is a<br />
by-election, because it is by-election that has been brought about<br />
by the death of political opponent who wv:, almost a lifelong<br />
personal friend of mine Percy Cl-rey: mpn I knew very well in<br />
what I might c-ll my " respectable" d;-ys when I prlctised in the<br />
vicinity of the Arbitration Court, mostly for the Unions ( Laughter).<br />
And f: om that time on I knew Percy Clarey and I admired him very<br />
much. He was a man of character and quality and I know that a. great<br />
number of people in the Bendigo Electorate came to have such a regard<br />
S for him th-t they may have voted for him though that would not<br />
normally represent their political view.<br />
\: ell he has gone, " las. He is a great loss to his Party<br />
and a great loss to his friends. But now you must fill the vacancy.<br />
Your choice is not between somebody new and the memory of somebody<br />
who hhs gone. Your choice is between the candidates whose names<br />
will be on the ballot paper on S turdy. And . I -m bound to sny<br />
that if either of the other c'ndidCtes is within coo-ee of this one,<br />
you must be the richest electorate in the whole of the Commonwealth<br />
of Austr-li I know thnt my geni. l -nd unpredictable frind, Arthur<br />
Calwell, ( L-ughter) spends gre.-t number of his wciking hours working<br />
out rather sharp little observ-tions worth heaidline picturesque-</p>
<p>V 2.<br />
-nd hc loves nothiing botter th-n to desciribe people on the other side<br />
in 2. r-!* t'hor gr otcsque f-iuhion. And therefore I -ra -ccustomefd to<br />
being, told tbh-' t I i-i ltired old-Vell if I oim, thit is<br />
very good reason , or sending m-y friend Snoll in so that ho c:-n diE;<br />
mu in tho ribs occasionally 2 nd wiake me up. And if I am not -and<br />
of course Arthur dosen't really thinik thnat' I am .4then this is 7.<br />
splendid ppportunity of putting in a-longside of me into thisPalmont<br />
a man whose contribution * L'oou r joint iwis dom must be; of great<br />
v'-luo to the Commone.-ilth. This is araire c-, ndida-tc.<br />
I toll you I know -if you won't give me s) wcy on this mit-tor-<br />
I'm n bit of -in expert on c-ndid-, tcs, I have supported_ smo terriblo<br />
candidates in my time. ( L-ughtor, Applaiuse) They w--ore on theo right<br />
O side, but in the wrong vway, if you follow me, And so when I find a<br />
cindid-te who in the homely phrmeu is Ic :&gt; kcr' of a cndidaite I<br />
-Im delightod. And tonight I h', ivu never boen more dcliehted ( ApPlbuso)<br />
Now you h ye boen hea. ring from thu other spoakers tonight<br />
something vory -Qcur-itu indeed ibout some of the things th~ lt h-) vQ<br />
gone on inside Austr-li-, I h-ye, of' aourso, ha&amp; L some sm-ll h-ind<br />
in the things th-t hatve gone on inside Austr-. li7 not tha-. t politicians<br />
do ev.-rything7.. But it is good politicia n who know's , hat to<br />
do anL hen to do it and w-* hen to kccup out andl not butt in, Now<br />
that I think T'erh-. i-, s, ha-s b(-on the summxwr y o-our political1 2nd<br />
government activities. c haven'? t told every ma,-n how he ought to do<br />
his job. lea-ve tha t to the socia list oxports. Ye_ Yxi ve a<br />
sneaking idea th-. t most of you underst-nd your business bottur thn<br />
we 6. o. \ ih-. t h', vo to do is to try to crcente sort of economic<br />
clim: nte, economic xo-' thur, in which you c n get on w. ith your job and<br />
bring about the best results. And th-. t requires though I s-y it<br />
myself -a consider-ble . mount of knowledge -n o-
wisdom. And iwei ho-c tu'h-t -t the end of 10 yea:, rs or getting on now<br />
tow-rds 11 ye-irs, vo c-, n 7t lu~ ist leek our fellow ci-tizens of<br />
Austrili-in the eye and say tha t ' Iwe 1-v-Nn't let you down". And I<br />
think even our enemies might except in their more profcselo. ua1<br />
moments be disposed -to grco with th-: t. </p>
<p>Of course it is not the business of an Opposition to see<br />
anything gopd in what a Government does. That is understandable.<br />
And if I were the Leader of the Opposition today, leading this<br />
collection of bits and pieces with my Deputy leader cpntradicting<br />
almost everything I said, every time he opened his mouth with<br />
internecine disputes going on around every corner if I were in<br />
that happy position that my friend Arthur Calwell is in, I would,<br />
I think, enjoy myself.( Laughter) You see I would have no responsibility,<br />
because I wouldn't get into office anyhow. And so I<br />
could be quite free and speak at large.<br />
The other day to give you a si: ple example he ':. ent up<br />
to the Northern Territory and the Northern Territory is, of course,<br />
a very important place and presents an i!. iportant problem. It was<br />
a problem when he was a Einister in the Labour Government. But now<br />
that we are there and he has no liklihood of having his Promissory<br />
Notes taken up. because, he knows that he won't win with his Party<br />
behind him, or around him, or somewhere, ( Laughter) he said that<br />
we ought to be spending on the Northern Territory œ 60m. a year.<br />
A good round sum œ 60m. a year. So I thought I had better find<br />
out what he did about that when he had his last chance which<br />
ended in 1949. Well I have no doubt that he was as eloquent then<br />
as he is now and he's very eloquent and I find that the total<br />
amount of money spent by his Government in the Northern Territory<br />
in their last full year 1948/ 49 was œ 2,750,000. And my<br />
wretched Government neglects the Northern Territory in such a<br />
shocking way that in our last complete year we spent over<br />
( Applause) Well, you know, I daresay th;: t as they looked at it ft<br />
that time they thought œ 2-4m. was a round sum ; ind pretty ? ood I'm<br />
not saying that it wasn't. 7' ut I think that if I had assumed this<br />
post -f perpetual Opposition Leader as he has, I would at least not<br />
be condemning œ 15i. if I happened to remember that I h. d spent onesixth<br />
of that amount. And so I just mention that as throwing a<br />
humourous light on politics which is otherwise, of course I've<br />
warned Mr. Snell a very dull occupation. ( Laughter) If it weren't </p>
<p>0 4.<br />
for your good-natured co-operation this would be a dull meeting.<br />
Politics is like that. And you want to remiember it.<br />
But I wanted to talk to you in particular tonight, not<br />
about these local matters in the direct sense, but about some of<br />
the things that are going on outside Australia and which I have<br />
had some high responsibilities for discussing at first hand in otr<br />
parts of the world. They are not academic. What is . oing on in<br />
the world today will determine the whole issue of peace and war.<br />
Therefore we have a vital interest in it. And our interest beco * es<br />
more and more important in Australia. " ic have 10 million people.<br />
We have, numerically, the greatest Corn'unist power of the lot<br />
China just up north of us. It is estimated by people who know<br />
about these things that by the end of this century Communist China<br />
will have in round figurz-es a thousand million people far more<br />
than the Soviet Union and by the end of the century no doubt with<br />
considerable industrial expansion, with a considerable growth in<br />
skill and subject to what may happen in the field of disarmament<br />
the most tremendous forces. And between them and us we have Laos,<br />
full of disturbances; Cambodia, living ill-at-ease with Thailand.<br />
We have Thailand, anxious. We have North Vict Nam in the hands of<br />
the Communists and South Viet Nam under a very gallant little<br />
President, holding its own, trying to establish its own way of<br />
living. Malaya come to freedom and Independence under 7] ritish<br />
Administration; Singapore, troubled, uneasy. And Indonesia, with<br />
all its political storms, and problems, and indeed, with still a<br />
civil war on its hands.<br />
These geographical considerations are very grc. t, cnorrmo-s.<br />
And we don't do anything )-ood about them by ignorino. their existence.<br />
We must remember these thihns and it is iLcc. ubc as a Government,<br />
have understood about these thinros that ' e took a leading hand in<br />
establishing the South-East Asian Treaty with the United States,<br />
Great Britain, Prance, Pakistan, Thailand, the Philippines, all<br />
gathered together.<br />
In Washington the other day I attended the Annual Meeting<br />
of the Ministers in this Organization. This is something that is<br />
growing, something which, partly because it establishes a sense of<br />
conmmunity. and partly becuuse it attracts the powerful support of </p>
<p>5<br />
United States, is one of the great items in the future seourity<br />
of Australia. But in the meantime we are not thinking so much in this<br />
world about the Chinese. 1We have occasion to, The people in Formosa<br />
have occasion to. The people in Iaos and Caibodia and Thailand,<br />
they have occasion to. But in the great nations in the world the<br />
discussion, very naturally and inevitably, has been going on about<br />
the relations between the Soviet World and the free world, the 6ossibilities<br />
of a settlement, the pos. ibility of reducing tension and<br />
thereby, of reducing armaments. These are enormmus problems. And<br />
if any Australian thought they had nothing to do with a general<br />
election or a by-election in Australia, he would be making a cardinal<br />
error. And if I, as the leader of the Government of this country,<br />
ignored them, addressing a great audience of this kind, I would be<br />
unfit for my responsibilities.<br />
I was in London when the celebrated event of the Summit<br />
occurred. We had had a Prime Ministers' Conference. We had discussed<br />
with Mr. Macmillan on the kind of thing that might arise at the<br />
Summit, and gave our general views on the iatter. There was a high<br />
degree of unanimity among the Prime Ministers there and they were<br />
Prime Ministers, as you know, from all over the world. Well they<br />
went over to attend the Summit, a Meeting worked for by Harold<br />
Macmillan, wirked for successfully as we all thought and we all<br />
know what happened Khrushchev arrived and he just wiped it all<br />
out with insults and contumely. Very odd, that, when you consider<br />
that a year before he was the man who was saying, " Let us have a<br />
meeting at the Su,! mit". You remember that this was one of their<br />
great pieces of Communist propaganda " We are the people who want<br />
a meeting at the Sunumit; we are the people who want peace". They<br />
have Peace movements and these preposterous Peace parades which<br />
their Fifth Columnists in Australia carry on. " Peace, Peace" they<br />
cry, when there is no peace. ind therefgre one would have supposed<br />
that the Master of the Co1m* unist world would Iave arrived and said:<br />
" Right, let us sit down together; let us strive here. o for peace".<br />
And instead of that he threw it all away. He said " iNo conference".<br />
And why? Because an aeroplane, a United States aeroplane, had </p>
<p>been found. flying over Russia and therefore, enga: ing in " spying".<br />
And you know how offended a Communist would be to think of anybody<br />
being a spy. ( Laughter).<br />
Why did he seize the opportunity? Because he W. . s indignant<br />
about spying? Nonsense! Nonsense! For every intelligen-tagent<br />
employed by any of the free countries i'll warrant he employs a<br />
hundred. Nobody has the faintest doubt about it. Anyhow I am<br />
always very glad to know what is going on inside the country of a<br />
potential enemy. I think it is of great and vital importance to<br />
the free world thLt we should know where they have their points from<br />
which they can deliver a nuclear and blasting attack on Great Britain<br />
or on the United States itself. What a lot of humbug is talked in<br />
this world, putting this thing in a sort ) f " 0h, itts very unfortunate".<br />
Of course he wasn't troubled about that. W ihat troubled him<br />
* was that he knew it wasn't the first it couldn't have been but it<br />
was the first they had seen and it was the first that they had<br />
persuaded or brought down and it was brought down 1,000 miles * side<br />
the Russian Frontier. That is what troubled him. Because you see<br />
that meant that everything he had been saying to the Russian people<br />
about: " We're not vulnerable to counter-att,' ck; we have much better<br />
nuclear weapons; don't worry about these people: they would have to<br />
send theirs by aircraft and we could shoot them down". Well it is a<br />
bit awkward for that theory when one, the first one, not the first to<br />
go but the first to be caught, was a thousand miles inside the<br />
frontier. Tha. t demonstrated at once that the nuclear deterrent and<br />
we all know that in the hands of the free world it is a deterrent<br />
not a weapon of offence was and is an effective one. That is what<br />
annoyed him. And that is what annoyed those around him. And I have<br />
no doubt it annoyed a great number of his own people.<br />
So, his reaction was to become violent and protesting and<br />
denouncing and, as you know, he has carried on ever since like a<br />
bully, like a crude bully a very, very able man behaving like a<br />
crude bully. This is a tragedy for the world. Disarmament?<br />
What did we expcct tq Zet out of a Su . nit ? reetinrg?<br />
What do you suppose that the fair-mindad people who went there, </p>
<p>Mlacmil a and De Gau le and Elsenho'er, -rhat do you suppose they<br />
. anted to get from a SuW-nit Meeting? lot just a general chitterchatter<br />
about this or that: one or two things that might have<br />
bro. ght some hope to the uorld, some hope to ordinary men and women<br />
who are the victims of international tension and rill be the mass<br />
victims of . ar, they are the Teople whose i terests matter. And<br />
everyone of the four men should have been there thinking of<br />
hundreds of mil ions of ordinary raen and vomen and determined to<br />
achieve some result, something that would relieve the tensLons: A<br />
temporary arra-gement about Berlin f you like, I thought might be<br />
quite possible. Not a final settlement but something that postponed<br />
the argument, let thin: gs settle a bit. An Agreement about nuclear<br />
tests? . hy they had had a Confererce in Geneva lasting a long time<br />
and the gap w. h . ch began like that got narrower and narro ' er until I<br />
saw no reason whatever why a Meeting at the Summit should not close<br />
t. at gap and dispose of that problem and give to all of us our first<br />
ray of hope about the conduct of the Comunist powers.<br />
All thrown away; all . cejected: " Go away; I will not confer<br />
with you. I do not rant to have a settlement about nuclear tests".<br />
And a few reeks later hen the disarmament conference resudies in<br />
Geneva and the free world is on the very point of tabling concrete<br />
proposals in that great fLe d, the Soviet representative, on ir. struc.<br />
tion, wal: s out and brirgs the conference to an end.<br />
^ P Now, th.. s s not to be overlooked e are not going to<br />
have talks about Berlin; re are not go: g to have talks about nuclear<br />
tests; we are n-t going to have talks about disarmament. We who<br />
wanted to talk nor no longer wa't to talk.' This is one of the<br />
climacteric events in modern history. And the next thing that<br />
happens is that, pursuing the same technique, stirring up something<br />
here or thre, the probicg operations of , rhat has been called the<br />
Cold 4ar, we open our papers one daT and we see that Fidel Castro of<br />
Cuba I . ould not have thought him one of the world's great statesmen,<br />
but impudent and greatly e couraged by what happened in the case of<br />
Colonel Nasser, for example a little matter of which I knor somethi.<br />
g cocks a. snoop at the United States of America, steals<br />
hundreds of milliors of pounds w. orth nf other people's property and </p>
<p>the next thing that happens s: t is al. right-we, the Soviet<br />
Union, wil1 lo after you: ', re will provide you with oil: we ', rill<br />
get our hard in. vIe Iil1 produce what : e will describe as " economic<br />
aid" and by e couiraging jou to say u-speakable things against the<br />
sreat free nations of the world, re wil' bind you to us<br />
These are pretty ser. ous considerations. ' retti serious*<br />
that is the understatement of all time.<br />
N -v I just turn from that to say one more thing, to go<br />
back a little, about China.<br />
You know some of us have been regarded by some others in<br />
the Commonwealth as attaching undue importance to the Communist threat.<br />
I think that my very good friend, Mr. Nehru, has, though he has not<br />
sa. d it he is much too courteous to do that but I think that more<br />
than once he has thou ht that I had too fixed a mind on the question<br />
of the Soviet Union for example. But do not think he would say<br />
that today about China. I am sure that he would not. He of al-the<br />
great leaders in Asia, has been the one who has sought to interpret<br />
fairly and generously what has gone on inside Communist China. He<br />
has maintairned his full. diplomatic relations with Communist China.<br />
He has had a lot of direct personal contact writh the leaders, Mao<br />
Tse-tung and Chou En-lai and all of them. 1 would have thought<br />
that they iould regard him as a man who had been, so to speak,<br />
an honest broker, in these matters. And what has happened? His<br />
own Chinese frontier has been violated, fol owing on the incidences<br />
of Tibet. Al the disturbances along his frontier: Scores of<br />
thousands of refugees from Tibet drive: into his own country; all the<br />
surging troubles around the North of Nepal and the province of<br />
Ladakh and those other places on the ultimate north, north east of<br />
india. He has been made to understand something, by hard experience,<br />
of the arrogance and aggressive'ess of the Communist, whether he is<br />
in the Soviet Union or in Chion or in o. e of the score of countries<br />
which have been taken into captivity by them.<br />
No-, SLr, why do I occupy your time talking about those<br />
things? i4el, I talk about them, of course, because they are vastly </p>
<p>important to us. There might have been a time in the history of<br />
Australia when people thought thp. t we could live by ourselves and<br />
to ourselves. Nobody believes that today. Does anybody believe<br />
that, wrapped in o,-r own virtve -nd isolated in our own splendour,<br />
we can just go along untouched by hostile hands? Of course not.<br />
The very thought of it is unreal and ridiculous.<br />
e have our security involved in the security of the<br />
entire free world, in that of the United States and of Cn,-de rnd our<br />
other comrade countries of the Common'wealth: Greet ' ritEin, right<br />
there in the very cockpit of any conflict; the whole of The , est of<br />
Europe. Our security is bound upwith theirs. This is no dr,. for<br />
narrow conceptions, for narro-mindedness, for p', rochrlism. on these<br />
things. This is the day for the broad Lnd secrpin'-conceptjnn of<br />
where we stand in the world. And in crse vov think that perhaps thct<br />
is blowing a little hard on behalf of /' ustralia, let me tell you with<br />
great pride, that our voice, in spite of the limits to our numbers,<br />
our voice is a very respectable and respected voice in the councils<br />
of the free nations of the world. ( Applause)<br />
Now before I conclude I would just like to say something<br />
about how all that has its counterpart inside Australia. I<br />
have never pretended, nor v. oul. d anybody else, that as a political<br />
Sparty, the Australian Co.;: unists a;-ount to very much. They have contributed<br />
a pretty high number of lost deposits to the revenues of the<br />
country. Of course the people of Australia von't pvt then into<br />
parliament. Of course the people of Australia will never consc'o'sly,<br />
in large numbers support a collection of people whose action-s are<br />
treasonable in the highest degree. Of course they on't. e rn<br />
decent, honest, sensible people in Australia.<br />
Therefore t'-ey do 7 little shop \: indo stuf-on r1. nn. ng<br />
a candidate that's only shop c'i:-Caond it is r little ch-nce -Por a<br />
bit of propaganda. ' here they do their wor,-is elsevrhere. nd the<br />
whole history of the industrial ovelient in Australia in recent years<br />
has been the history of an attempt, som: etimes successful and sometimes<br />
unsuccessful, by the Communists to get control of Union offices.<br />
Everybody knows about this. Even my friend Arthur Calwell,<br />
who, I think I think 1 must have been away at the time denied </p>
<p>that there was a Unity Ticket problem, has been brought to<br />
believe that there might be one. ( Laughter).<br />
But I am not interested in the convolutions in the mind of<br />
these apologists for Unity Tickets. Al' i want to point out to you<br />
is that whatever the technique is that ' s to be employed, the<br />
Communist significance in Australia rests upon their chance of<br />
securing control, or an effective voice, in key trade unions. It<br />
does not require very much imagination to know that if the Communists<br />
achieved the position of leadership in the electric power generat-on<br />
field in the State of Victoria, equal to that which Jim hiealy has<br />
achieved in the ' L. terside Workers' Federation, then a Communist<br />
decLsion could black out this State just as well qs sealing up the<br />
ports of the State. This is what they ; re after. Do not run aiay<br />
with the idea that these are amiable theorists. These people are,<br />
a d always have been, the Fifth Column for Communist aggress. on<br />
proceeding from the great contries. They go there; they do their<br />
refresher courses; they have their ._ nstruct . ons. And the whole idea<br />
is.: Let us insert ourselves into Union office.<br />
Nor we, some little time back, kno ring that the rank and<br />
file Trade Unionist in Australia is a patriot and willi not have<br />
an/ thing to do with Fifth Columns or people of this kind, instituted<br />
a vastly improved secret ballot law rhich enabled smal] l groups the<br />
industrial groups themselves were able to play a great part in it<br />
to get a secret ballot where the ordinary Union ballot looked as if<br />
it had been fLxed or rigged. And as a result of that legislation<br />
designdd to free people from these Communist manoeuvres and give<br />
them an opportunity of chal'e-ging elections that were improperly<br />
conducted, was voted against by every member of the Labour party at<br />
Canberra. But when it went into operation the results of it * ere<br />
astonishingly good. Comnunist offici. l after Communist official<br />
found himself rejected at the polls. And then the Australian Labour<br />
Party, or what is left of it, said: " This will not do", th. s ias<br />
under its previous leadership " This wil' not do. Of course we<br />
hate the Communists but we do not to fall ov. t with them too<br />
much". A.: d so theystarted inside their own ranks, not a pro-Communist </p>
<p>11.<br />
movement but a viole t movement against the industrial groups.<br />
Because they know that if they could destroy them or their influence,<br />
then some of these eminent Com.: unists would begin to come back as<br />
they have begun to come back into Unton office.<br />
That is the -ihole pnint about Unity tickets: the shabby<br />
statements that have been made, these miserable unconv. incing denials<br />
are all exploded if you lo k at a Unity ticket. B-It that is only a<br />
symptom. The true disease is that the Australian Labour Party is<br />
utterly unaware of the Com; ainist infiltration techniques or, being<br />
aware, is quite indiffere. t as to whether they succeed or not.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen I could stand up here and talk to you<br />
for a couple of hours about many of the problems of the world and<br />
perhaps, with a bit of luck, I might interest you on them because I<br />
have seen a good deal in relation to them, as you know, in recent<br />
times. But rcally at a time like this, at a period in the world's<br />
history when I think there . re gr. at dangers Cuba is a symptem of<br />
a danger; it is a symptom of hor people like thot can think they can<br />
disregard the ancient homes of freedom, the great poiers of the<br />
world, disregard them, fli in their f. ces, treat them with contempt.<br />
That kind of state of affairs in the world is explosive, A big dog<br />
may taku an awful lot from r. little dog, but not for always. This is<br />
explosive matter. It is a matter in which re must, ourselves, be<br />
prepared to give th-greatest moral and other support to those<br />
nations whose stand in the ;, orld and rhose strength in the world are<br />
vital to our security. And, in the samc way, this is the time :. hen<br />
we must realise, as alwa/ s I think, that if our own Government has<br />
been able to stand firmly, to be recognised around the free world<br />
as being wrorthy of trust and co-operation, then this by-election<br />
presents you with an opportun. ty of saying: " At any rate we have<br />
confidence in this Government. ' Ie rill not weaken it by any vote<br />
of ours".<br />
