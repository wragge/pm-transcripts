The Gillard and Weatherill Governments today reaffirmed their support for Australia's automotive sector following a meeting with General Motors to discuss the company's future investment plans.</p>
<p>Manufacturing Minister Senator Kim Carr and South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill met with senior executives in Detroit to ensure the interests of our automotive sector are properly represented.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, said the meeting was another tangible step in our commitment to secure and strengthen the future of our automotive sector.</p>
<p>We know our economy is transforming which is why we made manufacturing a key focus of the Tax Forum and Future Jobs Forum and why the PM's Manufacturing Taskforce was created.</p>
<p>Now, in 2012, we have our sleeves rolled up, ready to build on this work with industry to ensure manufacturing remains a staple of our economy.</p>
<p>Speaking from Detroit, Senator Carr said it was important to present and discuss this support with the senior executives at General Motors, along with Mike Devereux (GM Holden Chairman and Managing Director) and Premier Weatherill.</p>
<p>âGM is going through its product planning cycle for next generation models.  Today, we wanted to discuss their plans and make clear our support and commitment for ongoing automotive, design, engineering and manufacturing in Australia,â Senator Carr said.</p>
<p>âAll parties are committed to GM Holden's Australian vehicle manufacturing operations. Supporting the investment plans of GM Holden and other Australian motor vehicle producers ensures we maintain our automotive manufacturing base and a more diversified national economy.</p>
<p>"As part of the discussion, GM has agreed to establish a working group to look at increasing opportunities for local component suppliers in global markets.</p>
<p>âThe New Car Plan for A Greener Future has been effective in attracting investment to the Australian automotive industry and I have every confidence that GM Holden will continue to make a major contribution to the Australian economy, and to those seeking highly skilled and highly paid jobs.â</p>
<p>Mr Weatherill said he was in Detroit to put South Australia's case for being a strong part of GM's future global plans.</p>
<p>"Today, we received a clear message from Mr Akerson and Mr Devereux that they are committed to working with government to secure Holden's future in Australia and in particular at the Elizabeth plant.</p>
<p>"One possible scenario being considered by General Motors is the closure of its Australian operations. We are, of course, urging GM not to pursue this course.</p>
<p>"Important progress has been made on the terms of this agreement to secure the future of Holden in Australia and is expected to be concluded in the coming weeks," Mr Weatherill said.</p>
<p>Senator Carr said GM Holden directly employs more than 4,800 people across Australia, with major design and engineering facilities and an engine plant at Port Melbourne. About 2,500 people are employed at its assembly plant in Elizabeth, South Australia. </p>
<p>The Victorian Government is also involved in the discussions on Holden's future, he said.</p>
<p>Senator Carr and Premier Weatherill met Dan Akerson, GM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Tim Lee, GM's President of International Operations.</p>
