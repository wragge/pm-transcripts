A/ SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTS2R THE RT. HON.<br />
R. G. iMENZIES T THE OPENING F THE ATOMIC<br />
ENERGY COMMISSION BUILDING, LUCAS HEIGHTS,<br />
ON F1RIDAYq 18TH NOVEMB, 3ER__ 1360<br />
Mr. Chairman, Parliamentary colleagues, ladies and gentlemen:<br />
I didn't make a specific reference to Senator<br />
Spooner because he, in these parts of the world, is an abiding<br />
presence. If he gives you as much trouble as he gives me<br />
about this place, then he is active on both fronts.<br />
I don't know why they invite a miserable politician<br />
to open a place, the work of which he doesn't understand,<br />
unless it is on the cynical principle that politicians are<br />
always dealing with things that they don't understand, and<br />
this is good enough practice anyhow.<br />
But when I heard the ominous words about some<br />
presentation, I remembered at once that two and a half years<br />
ago, I think, I went through the motions of opening the Reactor<br />
which is now known, I gather, familiarly as " Hifar",<br />
O though wthat " Hifar" means I have yet to understand.<br />
And in order that I might have a souvenir of this<br />
event they presented me with a beautiful little model of<br />
" Hifar", and I keep it in my study at The Lodge. So each time<br />
I w. ant a change from meeting, and encountering the<br />
eccentricities of Her Majesty's Opposition I go up and I have<br />
a look at the model of " Hifar". And I look at it, north,<br />
south, east and est, and at the end of that looking, I say to<br />
myself: " Menzies, how ignorant you arc" which I believe is<br />
very good for the soul and on the whole very good for the<br />
Atomic Energy Commission. ( Laughter)<br />
Because on the old principle which the Latins<br />
described as ' Omne ignotum pro magnifico' this mystery, this<br />
insoluble mystery, as it is to me induces in my mind such a<br />
respect for the work of the scientists, that Spooner gets<br />
another half million out of us before we know what has<br />
happened. ( Laughter)<br />
Still there may be something in common between<br />
these scientific people , nd the politicians. Because just<br />
before I came in I was being told by a very distinguished<br />
scientist, not far from me, that one of the jobs in the<br />
metallurgical section of this building, which I am opening<br />
this afternoon, is to try to discover how, when you have an<br />
assemblage of matter it falls apart; and how to discover the<br />
ways and means of preventing it from falling apart, and making<br />
it last for a couple of years.<br />
This is precisely the full-time duty of a Prime<br />
Minister dealing with a Cabinet. ( Laughter)<br />
I mention that fact to you because it shows that I<br />
and my colleagues here are engaged in, really, a scientific<br />
undertaking' A few years ago, not so many years ago, a very<br />
distinguished Australian scientist offered a sentiment in<br />
public, which was of course, published, that he looked forward<br />
to the time when every member of a Common. wealth Government<br />
would have a Science Degree. I thought, . that a terrible<br />
prospect that would be". I think that the scientists ought to<br />
be very thankful to the Federal Government for not including<br />
scientists. One or two we might get by with; but twenty<br />
scientists, sitting around a CCbinet Table, jach of them<br />
knowing full Tell that he knew far more about it than these </p>
<p>homely, and lowly bodies who conduct these actual operations,<br />
this would be the very definition, I think, of disaster.<br />
i think that we arrive at a very happy compromise<br />
when as in the case of this Commission, we find assembled<br />
together a remarkable team of scientific and technical peo'ple<br />
who are so persuasive, th-ough their spokesman, Professor<br />
Baxter, and through my benighted colleague, Sc' . tor Spooner,<br />
that they can induce ignorant politicians to do the right<br />
thing by them, and to encourage the scientific-work that they<br />
are engaged in.<br />
Now about that work I just want to say one thing. I<br />
may not say it in just two or three words, but one thing.<br />
It is not so many years ago that wo were accustomed<br />
to reading about the work being done, for example, by<br />
Rutherford. These great men who were then piercing the<br />
mysteries of nature and those were the days, in my ow. n time<br />
as a student, when the idea of splitting the atom . ras regarded<br />
as a rather rhetorical idea on which a couple of rather<br />
amiable people, or many moro, wore engaged.<br />
Cynical people, unacquainted with science, and<br />
unendowed with imagination would say, " Viell, what is the point<br />
of it? Suppose they do split the atom? iJhat then? How will<br />
that affect my standard of living? How will that affect my<br />
life? ! ill that grow me more vegetables? iWill that do this<br />
or that for a not uncormmon attitude of mind.<br />
And then our attention, the attention of laymen at<br />
least having been distracted from this matter, all of a sudden<br />
towards the end of the last war came the nuclear bomb; and<br />
all this projection into the public mind was a projection of<br />
horror. This was the great, ultimate instrument of<br />
destruction. I'm afraid, Sir, that even now, too many people<br />
think of research in nuclear physics and all its allied<br />
activities, as h-ving something to do with increasing the<br />
cap.: city of man to destroy man. Just as in the earlier days<br />
of the war, ; hen we discovered that a thing called " Radar" had<br />
been devised, it was thought of, and thought of for years, as<br />
an instrument aptly fitted for use in wiar. It is only since<br />
the war that re have discovered tz-. enormous variety of civil<br />
and useful purposes to which it can be put.<br />
So I just want to say to you that I think that while<br />
war quickens things, while war induces an enormous<br />
concentration of resources that may move forward the boundaries<br />
of scientific knowledge most dramatically, we are not to think<br />
of those things that have been moved forward, primarily in<br />
terms of war, 4e can't forget that aspect of it; but today<br />
the work that has to be done in this field is overwhelmingly<br />
directed to the betterment of human life and the strengthening<br />
of the human future.<br />
When scientists and their helpers in this wonderful<br />
enterprise, which has developed so magnificently, and has been<br />
so splendidly conducted, are working here, they are<br />
concentrating their minds, not so much on how to produce<br />
something that might be used to destroy somebody, as they are<br />
to fashioning an instrument which will give industrial power to<br />
places that now no longer have adequate supplies of material<br />
for industrial power. They are concentrating on something<br />
that may revolutionise the -holo industrial history of the<br />
country. </p>
<p>3.<br />
Jho knows? The by-products of these -r':' rprises,<br />
in the field of medicine, and engineering, and agriculture,<br />
lay reach points of revolutionary effect to compare with the<br />
trem. endous work of the bio-chemists in the course of this<br />
century. It is one of the odd things about us in our<br />
generation, that we have fed full on revolutions. There have<br />
been more revolutions in our time than perhaps in any other<br />
period in history; and some of then revolutions of blood and<br />
Iisery. But there have boon other revolutions in hum an life<br />
which we yet perhaps don't fully appreciate. I remain a little<br />
cynical, myself, about satellites in the sky just a little,<br />
I know I'm wrong. I ought to be fascinated by them; but I<br />
confess that I am very much more fascinated with the<br />
constructive work of the scientists, the enormous revolutions<br />
that have occurred in medicine, and engineering, and transport,<br />
and in the production of power, and the increase of resources<br />
in the world. For these things the scientists, the devoted<br />
scientists, working principally in the dark, so far as the<br />
public are concerned, anonymously, relatively unknown, with no<br />
hcadlines, these are the people who constantly lay us under a<br />
debt of gratitude that it does us good to remember from time<br />
to tiine. It isn't very long since this site, where we are,<br />
was just a vacant hill-top. It was selected for what I know<br />
we thought in the political field, was a rather bold and<br />
rather speculative enterprise, to establish an experiiental<br />
re-actor at Lucas Meights.<br />
1Jll, w. hat did this involve? What was it for? And<br />
I once more want to say that this Commission owes a great deal<br />
to my colleague Senator Spooner who has literally never lot up<br />
on this matter. Finally we became interested, Then finally<br />
w. e said: " Right, this seems a good thing to do". And oven<br />
two or three years ago it was a me: re frqction of what it is<br />
today. I believe that the development here, with over 700<br />
people engaged in their work in this area, is one of the most<br />
significant things in recent Austr.: lian history. It w; ill not<br />
only give us a place in the field of research in these<br />
iatters, a respuctable position in the world, but it wTill also<br />
do and continue to do what has already been happening. It<br />
will lead to exchanges of highly trained people, to<br />
contributions of knowledge, outward and inward, to a growing<br />
association with the Universities, and growing facilities for<br />
the ultimate post-graduate and research activities-at'<br />
Universities,. his will become a nucleus of advancement in<br />
physical science, the limits of which I believe no one can<br />
sue, And if anybody supposes that all that kind of<br />
progress is not practical what dividends does it pay? I<br />
make two replies: It will in fact, in the most vulgar sense<br />
of the word, pay dividends, because it is going to produce<br />
immenso practical results in Australia. But if it produced no<br />
practical dividends in that sense at all, it would produce an<br />
addition to knowledge in this country, and in the world as a<br />
whole which would do great honour to this country, and be a<br />
source of strength to it in the scientific councils of the<br />
nations. </p>
<p>I am vory happy to say, boforc I finish, that this<br />
Cormission, tho Cxacutivo iraanber of -rhich has boon r: forior<br />
