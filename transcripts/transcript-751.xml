<p>THE GEORGE ADLINGTON SYME ORATION<br />
SPEECH AND SPEAKERS<br />
In April 1929, being then a junior Minister in the McPherson<br />
government, I arrived at Scott's Hotel to attend the annual dinner of the<br />
Melbourne University Graduates' Association. Ten minutes later I was told<br />
that Sir George Syme, who was to have made the principal speech, had suddenly<br />
become ill. Would I speak in his place? I agreed, and did the best I<br />
could. Sir George Syme died a week later. He bore a name which has been<br />
part of the stuff of Victorian history. He himself added lustre to it;<br />
not just because he had remarkable technical skill, but because he had<br />
statesmanship, unselfishness, devotion, and a clear integrity. The great<br />
medical profession does itself honour by regularly calling his name into<br />
remembrance. My own qualifications to deliver the Syme Memorial lecture are<br />
open to grave doubt. True, in my hey-day at the Victorian Bar I appeared<br />
in quite a number of medical cases and cross-examined a considerable number<br />
of medical witnesses. True also, I have, on satisfactorily rare occasions,<br />
been a sometimes impatient patient. I have no more reason than most to<br />
believe in the infallibility of medical judgment, which in my own lifetime<br />
has had to be exercised in rapidly changing circumstances and in times made<br />
turbulent by a greater achievement of new knowledge and new techniques than<br />
can be found in almost any other field. But I have emerged with a profound<br />
respect for the medical profession, and in particular for its leaders and<br />
original thinkers. Sir George Syme was one of these. He sought to raise<br />
standards and to accept growing social responsibilities. He was one of<br />
your great statesmen. A statesman in any aspect of life has great responsibilities.<br />
He must evolve ideas, and, even more importantly, he must intelligently<br />
understand and assess those of others when they reach him. The product of<br />
these processes may be a policy and a course of action. In this event, he<br />
must convey to others something of his own beliefs and enthusiasms. He<br />
will sometimes do it in writing; he will, more frequently, find it<br />
necessary to do it in speech in conversation, in conference, in all the<br />
means of persuasion. For good or great ideas are not commonly their own<br />
advocates. They must be conveyed, with lucidity and conviction.<br />
In our world, speech grows more and more important. If<br />
competently engaged in, it can shorten time-tables and accelerate results.<br />
It is this reflection which has led me to select as my topic<br />
" Speech and Speakers", a topic which may not be so irrelevant to medical<br />
and surgical progress and practice as might appear on the surface. </p>
<p>2<br />
The art of speech is of course much admired.<br />
are numerous, for it is attractive. Its masters are few,<br />
are great. Yet it remains the most potent instrument for<br />
and political progress. Its practitioners<br />
for its difficulties<br />
spiritual, social,<br />
The passion for making speeches is prevalent, particularly in<br />
our own country and in America. It is, in my considered opinion, possible<br />
to survive, and, with good fortune, enjoy three speeches after a public<br />
dinner. But six or seven or eight, or more, are beyond reasonable human<br />
endurance. Yet, at a Smoke Night of a respectable body some years ago there<br />
were 29 speeches, and not all good. In a sound country town which I visited<br />
for some official purpose when I was Attorney-General of Victoria, I listened<br />
after lunch to 14 speeches, thirteen of which were, fortunately, highly<br />
critical of myself. In the United States people are so addicted to listening to<br />
speeches that they actually pay people to make them. This must be a splendid<br />
experience for the speaker; I have yet to enjoy it. In my own earlier<br />
political days I suffered greatly from two classes of men. One was the<br />
Chairman of a public meeting who, clearly and perhaps reasonably doubting<br />
my capacity to expound my subject, would make a preliminary explanation of,<br />
say, 20 minutes, usually leaving my political audience in such a state of<br />
vocal exasperation that it took me another 10 minutes to get a hearing at all.<br />
Still, it may turn out that I owe that Chairman something, for he unwittingly,<br />
in my salad days, gave me much practice in the handling of interjectors.<br />
The other<br />
called upon to move a<br />
minutes to explaining<br />
said had I know how. man I am thinking of was the good friend who, being<br />
vote of thanks, took the opportunity of devoting<br />
to a rapidly dispersing audience what I would have<br />
Yet, these little souvenirs of mine do establish that there is<br />
a widespread interest in speeches, a popular desire to make them, and even,<br />
though I hesitate, to listen to them. The subject therefore warrants<br />
( as I hope you will generously agree) some examination of principles and<br />
some illustrations from my own life and experience.<br />
In a growing world, the complexity of whose problems invites<br />
but at the same time defies quick or superficial judgment, the evolving<br />
or the criticising of ideas remains pre-eminent. Every research worker<br />
knows this. And, because " there is no new thing under the sun", which<br />
means that research is discovery, not creation, truths of an earlier discovery<br />
will from time to time have to be applied to new circumstances.<br />
The work of the thinker cannot end in the laboratory or the study if it<br />
is to be fruitful for mankind. It must be conveyed to others clearly<br />
and, where possible, simply, in writing or in speech. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Tonight I am, having regard to the clock, confining myself to<br />
speech. Indeed, I go along a narrower path still. I want to speak about<br />
that kind of speech Which is public or semi-public, des-igned to achieve<br />
some result other than the rare pleasures of conversation.<br />
As I understand the matter, public or semi-public speak ' ing has<br />
three main purposes; to instruct. to persuade, to entertain. The three<br />
are. I hope, not mutually exclusive. There ha79 been, of course, speeches<br />
designed for vanity, for personal notoriety, or for the purpose of occupying<br />
time, as in the case of a stone-wall or " filibuster". They do not fall<br />
within my thesis. There are almost as many methods of speech as there are speakers.<br />
I will illustrate some of them, from my personal knowledge.<br />
Winston Churchill wrote and read his speeches on most occasions.<br />
When I say " wrote", I should say that, in my own time, " wrote" meant'llictated<br />
and amended". Most of us, when we dictate, either to a human being or a<br />
machine, prefer to dictate alone. There is still a certain amount of selfconsciousness<br />
about it. Churchill was not like that. Early in 1941, for<br />
example, when I spent about 8 or 9 weekends with him at " Chequers". I walked<br />
in to his small study one evening, to find him, pacing up and down, dictating<br />
a draft of a broadcast. The stenographer was tapping away at a silent<br />
typewriter, in a corner. I offered to withdraw. Winston gave me a cigar<br />
and waved me to a chair. I soon discovered his methods (" You know my<br />
methods, my dear Watson!"). He tried every word, every phrase, for weight,<br />
for meaning, for sound. He knew, of course, that a broadcast speech must<br />
come effectively to the ear and must, if possible, achieve its instant<br />
persuasion and inspiration. He knew also something which, for the rest<br />
of us, would be a vain dream; that posterity would dwell upon his words.<br />
In the result, he had arrived at a composition with his stenographer.<br />
When he was just trying out a phrase, he would speak it in a low voice,<br />
almost like a grumbling whisper. When he had arrived at the phrase, he<br />
spoke it " loud and clear", and down it went.<br />
Thus softly " until victory is as~ ured" " until we have<br />
emerged victorious" " until" " UNTIL THE DAY HAS COME!"'.<br />
I remember, many years ago, when Ramsay MacDonald was Prime<br />
Minister, sitting in the gallery of the House of Commons, looking down on<br />
Churchill, who was then in the political wilderness. He sat, as he has<br />
in more recent years, in the front row, just below the gangway. He was<br />
speaking, i. e. he was reading his typed speech, which he had ensconced in<br />
a species of book, held in front of him. This disappointed me, for I<br />
had never heard Churchill speak before. But I suddently realised the<br />
superb art with which he could read. He wbuld pause, chuckle, change </p>
<p>4<br />
the tempo and the inflexion, and then deliver the carefully prepared phrase<br />
as if it were literally a brilliant impromptu. That was the occasion,<br />
recently referred to in a Melbourne newspaper, on which Churchill was<br />
criticising Ramsay MacDonald and, referring back to an earlier speech, said<br />
" and that, Mr. Speaker, was when I ventured to<br />
describe the Right Honourable Gentleman as er<br />
chuckle chuckle ( while every Member sat forward<br />
with expectancy) " as the bonelsss wonder!"<br />
So you will see that Churchill had his own methods. But the<br />
result, as we all know to our advantage, was all clarity, and feeling, and<br />
inspiration. I did not ever hear Lloyd George in a public or parliamentary<br />
speech. But I did have some opportunities, in long private conversations,<br />
of asking him about his methods. He wrote his speeches, memorised them,<br />
and delivered them in the high Welsh manner. This faculty of memorising<br />
a speech is one to which I have never been able to aspire. For me, it<br />
would be dangerous: I am sure that I would, mentally, be looking back<br />
over my shoulder, and the forward drive of my speech would be lost. But<br />
Lloyd George managed it to perfection. He was, of course, a-man of<br />
extraordinary and-magnetic personality, like Winston himself; such men<br />
can survive the dangers of any technique. Lloyd George's son, Gwilym,<br />
who was to become a Conservative Cabinet Minister, once said to me, at a<br />
small luncheon in London, " I believe you have been seeing something of<br />
my old man. What do you think of him?". I protested that this was an<br />
impossibly embarrassing question. Gwilym smiled, and waved my protest<br />
aside. So I sat up and said " Well, for many years now your father has<br />
made no political pronouncement with which I could agree. But if he<br />
thought it desirable to make me a disciple and an apostle, and exercised<br />
his powers upon me, I think I would find it necessary to follow him!".<br />
My third example of this speaking technique is the late J. M.<br />
Barrie. Back in the thirties, when the late Lord Dunrossil was " Shakes"<br />
Morrison, he took me to Stanway Hall, in the West Country, to meet<br />
J. M. Barrie. It was a fascinating experience, upon which I have no time<br />
to dwell tonight. But, as I walked around the grounds with Barrie, we<br />
fell to talking first about cricket, and then about speech making, and in<br />
particular about Barrie's famous rectorial address at St. Andrews on<br />
" Courage" one of the great speeches of our time. Those of you who<br />
have read it ( as I imagine you all have) will remember its extemporaneous<br />
quality and its flashes of whimsical and penetrating humour. " Well", he<br />
said, " Menzies, I wrote it, and learned it, and delivered it, and a<br />
fortnight later I could not have remembered it at all!" </p>
<p>I mentioned, then, the word " whimsical". I am of course<br />
conscious of the fact that the coantemporary intellectual rejects<br />
whimsicality, and probably rejects Barrie.<br />
I don't know whether they will regard this as evidence in their<br />
favour, but I feel compelled to tell you that, on this same memorable ( to me)<br />
occasion, Barrie said to me, " Did you ever think of writing a novel, Menzies?".<br />
Those of you who have known me only as a political tactician will be surprised<br />
to learn that I replied " Yes, frequently, but though I think I could write<br />
the dialogue, I could never invent a plot". To which Barrie replied:-<br />
" Take my advice". Write a play. A novel means 90,000 words. A play<br />
mean~ s only 20,000 words and they pay you five times as much for it."<br />
I record this memory not to cry down the name of one of the great<br />
literary figures of our time, but to prove, if it needs proving, that he had<br />
a wry humour of his own.<br />
Take anoth ' er type of speaker the after-dinner speakers. We<br />
have all suffered from many of them. After-dinner speaking is a great art,<br />
much neglected by the kind of man who thinks that, the state of euphoria<br />
induced by a good dinner should be counteracted by a dose of heavy statistics.<br />
Before the war, the late Lord Hewart, then Lord Chief Justice, was regarded<br />
as a great after-dinner man. The first time I heard him was at a great<br />
Anglo-American dinner in London. When his time came, he unashamedly pulled<br />
out from under his plate a typescript and held it up, and read it! He did<br />
better on the last occasion when I heard him, at a dinner at the Goldsmith's<br />
Company, when he was down to answer the last toast, that of " the other<br />
visitors". His speech I can remember vividly. " My Lords and Gentlemen,<br />
at this time of night I have two speeches of thanks. One is my short<br />
speech ' Sirs, thank you very much!' . The other, is my long speech ' My<br />
Lords and Gentlemen, I take this opportunity of thanking you very much<br />
indeed!' Pray regard me, on this occasion, as having made by long speech!".<br />
The best after-dinner speaker I-~ ever heard was the late Norman<br />
Birkett ( Lord Birkett), who was also a wonderful cross-examiner and advocate.<br />
He had a beautiful voice and a flashing wit, and, so far as I could tell,<br />
did not prepare the language of his speech in advance. He entertained his<br />
audience without fail; it was only later that they realised they had been<br />
instructed as well.<br />
Speech, especially clear speech based upon knowledge and clear<br />
thinking, is of immense importance to the expert witness. I will take<br />
just two examples from your own profession, many members of which have in<br />
my own forensic experience, failed as witnesses by under-estimating the<br />
cross-examiner and not refreshing their memory of the text-book elements<br />
of the subject in issue. But cross-examiners usually fell back defeated </p>
<p>6<br />
before Alan Newton and Victor Hurley. How admirable it was to listen<br />
to great experts who knew that a capacity for clear and authoritative<br />
expression is as important in one profession as in any other. Alan<br />
Newton was, of course, a man of most versatile genius. I thought he<br />
would have excelled in any field. The point I am concerned to make is<br />
that Newton never fell into the not uncommon error of thinking that the<br />
precisions of speech do not matter that " You know what I mean" is good<br />
enough. My personal methods may perhaps deserve a very brief mention.<br />
I invariably write memorial lectures, since I have what is, as<br />
yet, a not completely defeated hope that some day somebody may wish to read<br />
them. I write important formal statements for the House. All this<br />
writing I do in long hand, by a lead pencil! But I do not write debating<br />
speeches or public political speeches ( except, of course, a Policy Speech),<br />
or social speeches. I do a lot of preparation of facts and ideas, and<br />
make highly summarised notes and headings; but I never prepare the actual<br />
language. Naturally, drawing upon my own forensic experience, my mind<br />
turns to the advocacy of the courts of law. Yet, interestingly enough,<br />
the most persuasive advocate I ever heard was a soldier and engineer. Sir<br />
John Monash. When I was, for a brief period, a junior Minister in the<br />
McPherson government in Victoria, and John Monash was Chairman of the State<br />
Electricity Commission, a proposal he had put forward was almost unanimously<br />
rejected in Cabinet. When the news reached him he came straight up, and<br />
was without delay admitted to the Cabinet Room. He was given a seat at<br />
the table. He asked whether he had been rightly informed of the rejection.<br />
The answer was " Yes". He hitched up his chair, looked at all of us, one<br />
by one and said, slowly and firmly " It is clear to me that Ministers have<br />
not understood the matter. I will now explain it." He proceeded to do<br />
so, with a clarity and force I can remember to this day. We were all<br />
attracted by his magnetism and swayed by his argument. Questions were<br />
few, hesitant, and almost apologetic. When the final silence came, Monash<br />
produced an Order of Approval from his pocket and, with the mere hint of<br />
a smile, said " I take it then, Mr. Premier that my proposal is approved.<br />
If you will be good enough to sign this paper, I can depart". The Premier<br />
signed. We all, quite spontaneously stood up, and the great man left.<br />
I have always felt certain that if Monash had not possessed what the late<br />
Brudenell White once described to me as " the divine gift of utterance",<br />
his place in military and civil life would not have been as assured as<br />
it is. </p>
<p>7<br />
I have just referred to the great John Monash. I could contrast<br />
him with another great man and soldier, Field Marshall Lord Wavell. When<br />
Wavell wrote, whether in a life of Allenby or in a despatch to Winston<br />
Churchill, he wrote like a master. In the earlier part of 1941, when<br />
Wavell was greatly outnumbered in the Middle East campaign and Rommel's<br />
panzer divisions were rolling eastwards, I saw quite a few of the pungent<br />
messages sent out by Churchill, who was of course in complete command of<br />
direct and ( where necessary) colloquial language. I also saw some of<br />
Wavell's replies. They rivalled Winston's own. Yet, oddly enough, Wavell's<br />
conversational powers were limited., When I was in the Middle East in January-<br />
February, 1941, and had proper occasion to put quite a few questions to him,<br />
Wavell's replies were almost always monosyllabic and frequently cryptic. I<br />
naturally concluded that he did not approve of me. This did not surprise<br />
me, for many people had felt the same way. But later on, when I had arrived<br />
in London, I found that this was wrong; that he was very well disposed<br />
towards me; but that he had found oral utterance difficult and even<br />
embarrassing. He preferred to work out his ideas on paper, and was<br />
cautious of talk. It is perhaps for this reason that some other generals<br />
of the war achieved a quicker fame. The historian will ultimately, I hope,<br />
correct this, for Wavell's mind and character, exercised under great<br />
difficulties, were of the loftiest order. Perhaps the truth is that the<br />
power of exposition and persuasion is more important in an operational<br />
commander. I don't know. Wavell was acutely conscious of his great<br />
responsibilities, and would not lightly speak about them. Yet, years<br />
afterwards, in 1948, at a dinner at Leo Amery's house in London, I found,<br />
to my joy, that, with the responsibilities off, Wavell could talk freely<br />
and with fire and conviction.<br />
My first profession was that of the law, as a barrister. I<br />
loved it. Some people think it dreary; I cannot think why. But it is<br />
not my purpose to write or read a treatise on the practice of the law.<br />
Tonight I am concerned with expression, particularly oral. Expression<br />
in writing, as I have endeavoured to show in the case of Wavell, must take<br />
a high place. Barristers are briefed by solicitors to write opinions on<br />
matters on which the solicitor or his client thinks Counsel's opinion<br />
necessary. In my time at the Bar we wrote our opinions on blue draft<br />
paper, and only occasionally sent them out to a professional typist for<br />
copying. One consequence of these primitive methods was that, in order<br />
to avoid writer's cramp, we wrote with economy of language and managed to<br />
answer the questions without undue circumlocution. If, when we were<br />
juniors, we were briefed to draw interrogatories, ( which are written<br />
questions delivered before action and to be answered on oath by the opposite<br />
party), we seldom drew more than seven or eight. But they were drawn with<br />
such care that in most cases they could not be evaded, with the result that<br />
the calling of certain evidence at the hearing was rendered unnecessary.<br />
Then came the great age of the stenographers. They proliferated in </p>
<p>8<br />
Selborne:: Chamb'ers,. Opinions became much longer, and sometimes, cynical<br />
friends have told me, less intelligible and precise. As to interrogatories,<br />
their numbers multiplied out of all proportion to their results. It may<br />
be, of course, that one tends to glorify the past.<br />
" Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,<br />
But he'll remember with advantages<br />
What feats he did that day.'"<br />
But, from the point of view of speech, the great art of the law<br />
is advocacy; the examination or cross-examination of witnesses, and the speech<br />
to the judge or jury.<br />
My learned friends tell me that cross-examination is not what<br />
it used to be. Perhaps it never was. But, in my own time, I knew more<br />
than one case to be lost by bad cross-examination. Too many advocates<br />
forgot that to cross-examine a witness effectively you must study the<br />
witness and try to assess his strengths and weaknesses, instead of putting<br />
your head down and laboriously making notes of his evidence in chief.<br />
Good cross-examination requires homework to determine the real points of<br />
issue on the facts, a close study of the human being in the box, and a<br />
most careful, though perhaps casual-seeming, precision in the framing of<br />
each question. Repetition and noise and a belligerent attitude may tickle<br />
a few ears, but they will seldom win a case.<br />
But it is in the address to the court, judge or jury, that the<br />
highest arts of consecutive forensic speech and argument are called for.<br />
Here there is a distinction to be made between argument to a judge ( who<br />
is by popular legend a man not swayed by emotion) and an address to a jury<br />
( which is by equally popular legend subject to all the frailties of mankind).<br />
I hope that the greatest of contemporary lawyers, Sir Owen<br />
Dixon, will forgive me if I say that I did not ever think him to be quite<br />
at home addressing a jury. To use the modern jargon, he found difficulty<br />
in getting on to the same wave-length. But I never expect to hear a better<br />
legal advocate. And I say this having in mind, at the English Bar, such<br />
men as Wilfred Greene, Gavin Simonds, and Stafford Cripps. He wasted no<br />
words. He knew his case in all its aspects, and was of course extraordinarily<br />
well furnished with its legal background and its subtleties.<br />
But above all he had a superb sense of selection. If you were his opponent,<br />
hoping that you would have time, when your turn came, to dwell pleasantly<br />
on your better arguments, you suddenly found yourself precipitated into<br />
the most difficult argument of all, Owen Dixon having most unexpectedly<br />
sat down with a characteristically Dixonian smile.<br />
On the criminal side, I remember with pleasure George Maxwell,<br />
the most formidable advocate to a jury I ever heard, or, for that matter, </p>
<p>9<br />
ever heard about. Maxwell played, not upon the intellect, but upon the<br />
human emotions. He had a remarkable faculty for identifying himself<br />
with his client. So much was this so, that I have known him, as we<br />
robed at adjoining lockers at the Law Courts, to speak despondently about<br />
his client and tell me that all he could do was " to make a bit of a plea<br />
for mercy", and be back at the luncheon adjournment, shaking his head at<br />
me and saying " It will be a gross miscarriage of judgment if the young<br />
fellow is convicted!". By the time George Maxwell had made his final<br />
address and had convinced the jury that they ran some risk on the " dread<br />
day of judgment" if they wantonly or unreasonably convicted the accused,<br />
the case was almost over. I have heard quite a few professionally<br />
humorous counsel laugh their own case out of court. I have known a few<br />
criminal advocates succeed in being so detached that they lost contact<br />
altogether. But Maxwell was pre-eminent. Even when he became blind,<br />
at the height of his career, he had a superb touch. I looked into his<br />
court one day, just in time to hear him say:-<br />
" I now turn to the witness Robinson. I could not<br />
see him, gentlemen, because it has pleased the<br />
Almighty to deprive me of my si* 1t. But although<br />
I couldn't see him, I could hear him. And he sounded<br />
like a damned rogue!"<br />
Could I turn to my own second profession, that of politics?<br />
That it involves the art of speech is of course clear. It is hard to<br />
suppose that a great thinker who was inarticulate could command support<br />
and give effective leadership to a democratic electorate. This may seem<br />
to you to be a misfortune, and in one sense it is. But we must face the<br />
facts of Parliamentary democracy. People will not follow a eader whom<br />
they do not understand, or who seems to them to be unaware of the problems<br />
of their own lives.<br />
Thus it is that the great Parliamentary leaders in Australia<br />
or Great Britain have, in I suppose the great majority of cates, had the<br />
faculty of speech. They have, of course, varied. Fashions of speech<br />
change. The classical speech of the famous parliamentarians of the late<br />
18th century is still most readable for us. Burke, for example, may have<br />
bored the House of Commons, but he still reads uncommonly well today. On<br />
the other hand, coming to the 19th century, I find the speeches of Gladstone<br />
somewhat dreary reading. I remember that, having just been reading the<br />
story of his famous Midlothian campaign, I got hold of the speeches he<br />
then delivered. I am bound to say, with improper irreverence, that they<br />
would never have done for a modern audience. I at once concede that this<br />
comment ignores the effect of the voice and the appearance, which must have<br />
had a magnetism of their own. Of all the 19th century Parliamentary<br />
speakers, I confess to a preference for John Bright, whose flashes of simple </p>
<p>and moving prose, coming, as such things do, fromi the gerterotis emotions of<br />
the speaker's heart and mind. have the stuff of imortality in them.<br />
" The angel of death has been abroad throughout the<br />
land; you may almost hear the beating of his wings:"<br />
It is, of course, to be remembered that uncommon eloquence is<br />
sometimes self-defeating. The critics are all too ready to asisume that<br />
fluency and an apt choice of words can create -a great speech independently<br />
of thought and ideas. This not uncommon error'has temporarily done a<br />
disservice to the memory of that very great Prime Minister. Alfred Deakin.<br />
" Ali yes", you will hear someone say, " He was a silver-tongued orator" ( the<br />
word orator, by the way, has achieved an almost offensive connotation:)<br />
" but, after all, what did he say?".<br />
Now I heard Deakin only when I was a school-boy. But~ years<br />
afterwards, I became immersed in the stream of Australian political history,<br />
and became a Prime Minister myself. All I wish to say is that Deakin did<br />
more to fashion the great national policies of Australia than any other<br />
leader we have or have had. Men and their work are easily forgotten.<br />
But if you care to examine the foundations of Australian policies on defence,<br />
tariff, British trade, industrial arbitration, to say nothing of our<br />
irrigation systems, you will find the mary of Alfred Deakin. Yet, for<br />
the short run of history, he spoke too wet<br />
" Billy" Hughes observed no rules; as a speaker he was<br />
sui oieneris. The more eloquent of his earlier speeches do not, in my<br />
experience, come well out of a second reading. They lack restraint and.<br />
are over-decorated. But at the time, delivered with enthusiasm, despite<br />
the defects of his voice, they had a profound and at times an historic<br />
influence. Those were, of course, the days when he was expressing deeply<br />
held beliefs. Later on, when I was associated with him in Cabinets, the<br />
fires had burned low, lHe had become much too conscious of the pressures<br />
of what he regarded as contemporary or even temporary public opinion,<br />
The old wit remained, cruel and devastating, but as a speaker of persuasive<br />
or compelling power he had cepsed. Perhaps he stayed in politics too<br />
long; I will make a mental note of it.<br />
So that it will not be thought that I am entering upon the<br />
risky experiment of making a graded list of Australian political speakers,<br />
I will mention only a few, simply to illustrate my theme.<br />
Among leaders in my own time, J. A. Lyons was, I think. the best<br />
Parliamentarian. In my opinion, this has not been adequately appreciated.<br />
At question-time or in debate, he preserved, with the greatest of simplicity,<br />
the personal friendship of his opponents. He had-gre~ at. human. it1a nd gio </p>
<p>11<br />
malice. He could, of course, speak, and speak very well. But other<br />
aspects of Parliamentary life and government administration attracted him<br />
more, for he was above all a great humanist. There was much to learn<br />
from him. John Curtin and J. B. Chifley, both notable Labour Prime Ministers,<br />
were quite different personalities and speakers. Curtin had a philosophical<br />
quality; he spoke with great effect, and enjoyed the rounded period.<br />
Chifley was no orator in the conventional sense, and had a somewhat grating<br />
voice: but he was, in his direct and homely fashion, a powerful and<br />
commanding leader of his party.<br />
Quite a different type of speaker was W. A. Watt. He was, I<br />
think, the best platform speaker I ever heard; the voice strong and vibrant,<br />
the appearance almost piratical, the tempo measured, with every word and<br />
every syllable receiving its proper weight. He created a sort of<br />
intellectual compulsion. I should add, by way of irrelevant reminiscence,<br />
that many years ago, before I had thought of entering Parliament, I was<br />
asked to speak, as a sort of preliminary pipe-opener, at Geelong. The<br />
principal speaker was Watt, who was at his top, rejoicing our friends and<br />
destroying our opponents in the hall with unerring strokes. The next<br />
morning, I turned to the local newspaper, hoping, no doubt, to read some<br />
of my own boyish profundities recorded. What I read was a first-class<br />
report of Watt's speech, followed by the encouraging sentence " A Mr.<br />
Menzies also spoke, and revealed a peculiar sense of humour".<br />
No doubt my amour propre was wounded at the time, but I have<br />
since come to believe that it was one of the best reports I have ever had.<br />
The art of Parliamentary debate is, I think, suffering from<br />
some adverse influences. The introduction of the broadcasting of<br />
Parliamentary debates at Canberra has some advantages in public information.<br />
But my own feeling is that speeches are tending to become set speeches,<br />
and are losing something of their true debating quality. It was for the<br />
fear of this that Winston Churchill, himself a great Parliamentarian, used<br />
his influence, when the bombed-out House of Commons was being restored, to<br />
resist broadcasting and fighit for the re-creation of a House which could<br />
not seat all of the Members at the same time. He wanted to preserve the<br />
intimacy of debate, to make members still conscious of the fact that they<br />
are addressing the House, their fellow-members, and not the outside public.<br />
There is much to be said for this view, though perhaps the changing<br />
techniques of today are tending to impair it. In spite of the disproportionate<br />
and adverse publicity which is frequently given to quite<br />
trivial incidents, Parliament remains a remarkably good cross-section of<br />
the people; and this, after all, is its historic function. </p>
<p>12<br />
I hope that what I have said will have shown that there are<br />
many varieties of speech, several different purposes to be achieved, and<br />
greatly differing techniques. Are there, then, any basic principles?<br />
I would think not, for there are even more variations in audiences than<br />
there are among speakers. Indeed, there are clearly different tastes in<br />
different countries. In my limited experience, Americans, who practically<br />
invented that phenomenon, the lunch-time speech, delivered on the precarious<br />
foundation of cold meat, a lettuce leaf, and a warming draught of iced<br />
water, enjoy listening to written speeches, suitably stocked with statistics.<br />
In England, where the best after-dinner speakers are the best in the world,<br />
because they regard the speech as an expression of art, most speakers in<br />
the House of Commons appear to read their speeches. At Canberra, for<br />
intelligible reasons, many second reading speeches by Ministers and leaders<br />
are read, but most of the speeches in general debate, certainly most of<br />
the effective ones, are expressed in impromptu language. I have occasionally<br />
written out a speech on international or economic topics, or even a memorial<br />
lecture like this, where precision is essential. But whenever I have to<br />
do so, I dislike it. It is good for the record, but is not good for the<br />
direct audience. It secures better newspaper reporting, for obvious reasons;<br />
the art of reporting is in decline. But if the object of a speech is to<br />
persuade, the speaker must be sensible of his audience, must catch its mood,<br />
and must be prepared to turn aside into productive avenues at the expense<br />
of the pre-determined course. For, if you are to persuade an audience,<br />
you must metaphorically be down off the platform and among your listeners.<br />
And the object of persuasive speech is to have your audience not leave saying<br />
" He can speak", but saying " He was right!".<br />
My final observation is this. Over the course of history, many<br />
men have been asked to give advice about speaking. Let me start high.<br />
It was Demosthenes himself who said that the condition of oratory was<br />
" Action! Action! Actioh!". This was a somewhat cryptic statement, and<br />
has been sometimes misunderstood as if action meant physical action.<br />
As it happens, I have on a few occasions been asked by young<br />
men to offer advice on public speaking. My invariable answer is:-<br />
" There are three rules. The first is, have something to say. The second<br />
is, have something to say. The third is, have something to say.".<br />
I stand by this advice, though you will be the judges of my<br />
capacity to take it myself. </p>
