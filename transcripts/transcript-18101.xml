Australia condemns the brutal bomb attack on the United Nations building in Abuja, Nigeria, last night which has killed and injured many innocent civilians. </p>
<p>The United Nations is dedicated to preventing conflict, maintaining peace and helping the world's poorest and most disadvantaged. An attack on the United Nations is an attack on us all. </p>
<p>On behalf of the Government and people of Australia, I extend sincere condolences to the families of those killed and injured.  Our thoughts are with these families.  Our thoughts are also with the men and women of the United Nations, who serve with bravery and dedication around the world and who too often find themselves the victims of the conflicts they are working to solve. </p>
<p>Australia has conveyed its condolences to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. </p>
<p>We have also expressed our support and sympathy for the Government and people of Nigeria, who today are mourning many of their own citizens.  </p>
