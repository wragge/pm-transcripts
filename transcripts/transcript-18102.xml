Australians can now nominate their own local champions who have helped to promote inclusion and strengthen community relations under a new ambassador program set up by the Gillard Labor Government.</p>
<p>The People of Australia Ambassador program will see up to 40 local champions selected from nominations submitted by the public across the country.</p>
<p>The ambassador program is a key initiative of the Gillard Government's new multicultural policy -The People of Australia - announced earlier this year.</p>
<p>People of Australia Ambassadors will champion inclusion and provide advice to the new Australian Multicultural Council and to the Government about effective initiatives which promote belonging and leverage diversity in our communities.</p>
<p>Prime Minster Julia Gillard today encouraged Australians to nominate outstanding individuals from their neighbourhoods who have encouraged participation in their community.</p>
<p>Ambassadors will be appointed for a 12-month period and have key roles in annual community events and celebrations including Harmony Day on 21 March.</p>
<p>Communities and individuals can nominate a representative who has contributed to promoting the benefits of social cohesion and diversity, or has played a pivotal role in building strong community relations in Australia.</p>
<p>Nominations for the Ambassador roles need to be submitted before 7 October.</p>
<p>All nominations will be considered by the Australian Multicultural Council.</p>
