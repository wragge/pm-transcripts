Prime Minister Julia Gillard today warmly welcomed New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to Canberra for an official visit.</p>
<p>New Zealand is one of Australia's closest and most valued partners.</p>
<p>Our relationship is anchored in the bonds of our ANZAC tradition, the warm ties between our people and the unique closeness of our economic ties.</p>
<p>Trade between our two countries is substantial - $15 billion in 2010  -  and New Zealand remains one of our top ten global trading partners. Two-way investment is significant.</p>
<p>Reflecting the closeness of the relationship, Prime Minister Key addressed a joint sitting of Parliament, becoming the first New Zealand Prime Minister to do so and one of only a small number of world leaders to have had this honour.</p>
<p>This reciprocated the historic occasion when Ms Gillard became the first leader to address New Zealand's Parliament in February this year.</p>
<p>Continuing the Trans-Tasman Agenda </p>
<p>In February, Prime Minister Gillard and Prime Minister Key signed the investment protocol to the Closer Economic Relations (CER) agreement.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister was pleased today to sign with Mr Key a statement of intent to take a further step to deepen trans-Tasman ties through the phased establishment of a joint Australia-New Zealand Therapeutic Products Agency (ANZTPA).</p>
<p>ANZTPA will progressively establish common regulatory arrangements for therapeutic goods and a single trans-Tasman entry point for business. </p>
<p>A single regulatory framework will provide health benefits for consumers, reduced regulatory costs for industry and greater efficiency for governments. </p>
<p>The new scheme is expected to enhance the reputation of New Zealand and Australian therapeutic products on the world market.                                                                                                        </p>
<p>The Prime Minister also reaffirmed her commitment to further streamlining air travel between Australia and New Zealand and welcomed the commencement of a trial of integrated SmartGate systems in July.</p>
<p>The Prime Ministers welcomed cooperation to investigate the competitiveness of trans-Tasman mobile roaming rates, noting the potential benefits this could realise for consumers and businesses on both sides of the Tasman.</p>
<p>Centenary of ANZAC</p>
<p>Prime Minister Gillard welcomed agreement that Australia and New Zealand would work closely together in the lead-up to the centenary of the ANZAC landings in 2015 and other major First World War battles.</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand have already begun joint planning for the Gallipoli Dawn Service in 2015. </p>
<p>There will be close consultation in the development of national commemorative programs for the centenary of ANZAC. </p>
<p>The two Prime Ministers agreed to commission advice on possible joint Australia-New Zealand activities and programs to complement national commemorative programs.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister also announced that design work would commence for an Australian memorial in the proposed New Zealand Memorial Park in Wellington.</p>
<p>This memorial will be completed by the time of the centenary of ANZAC in 2015 and will reciprocate the New Zealand memorial on ANZAC Parade in Canberra. </p>
<p>Climate Change </p>
<p>New Zealand has had an emissions trading scheme since 2008 and the Gillard Government is committed to introducing a carbon price mechanism from 1 July 2012.</p>
<p>Both Governments recognise that expanding and linking global markets provides the most cost effective approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>To that end, the Prime Minister welcomed agreement to establish a senior officials group to work on arrangements to link our two emissions trading schemes at an appropriate point in the future.</p>
<p>Cooperation in the Pacific </p>
<p>The Prime Minister confirmed she would attend the Pacific Islands Forum in Auckland in September.</p>
<p>The Prime Ministers noted with concern recent developments in Fiji and the continuing impact of the Bainimarama regime on the Fijian people.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Gillard underlined the importance of maintaining firm pressure on Fiji to restore democracy and address human rights concerns.</p>
<p>People Smuggling </p>
<p>The Leaders discussed the need for regional cooperation to combat people smuggling. </p>
<p>Ms Gillard expressed appreciation for New Zealand's support for the Regional Cooperation Framework and New Zealand's commitment to combating illegal migration.</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand in the World </p>
<p>Prime Minister Gillard reiterated Australia's commitment to the future of Afghanistan and welcomed progress toward the transition of security responsibility to the Afghan Government by the end of 2014.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard and Mr Key looked forward to advancing shared interests at the forthcoming CHOGM meeting and in the East Asia Summit and APEC.</p>
<p>With the rising strategic and economic importance of the Asia Pacific, the Leaders welcomed the important decision by the East Asia Summit in Hanoi last year to include the US and Russia as members, agreeing this represented a major opportunity to build the architecture needed for a stable and prosperous region.  </p>
<p>They also welcomed renewed efforts to foster regional trade, innovation and integration, including through Australia and New Zealand's participation in negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Gillard confirmed the importance of concluding the Doha Round of world trade talks. </p>
