    <content><![CDATA[<p>I look forward to travelling to Washington and meeting with President Donald J. Trump later this month.</p>
<p>The visit, from 21-24 February, will be an important opportunity to further advance our countries’ ties built on one hundred years of mateship. This year will mark a century since Australia and the United States first served together at the Battle of Hamel.</p>
<p>The United States is Australia’s most important ally. Our friendship is underpinned by a deep alignment of shared values, including freedom, democracy and the rule of law.</p>
<p>The United States is our largest economic partner. Our comprehensive free trade agreement continues to develop strong economic ties with bilateral trade totalling over $42 billion during 2016-17.</p>
<p>Our partnership in pursuit of a secure, open and prosperous Indo-Pacific remains an abiding priority. We stand together in our resolve to confront the most serious threat to peace in our region – the illegal and reckless North Korean regime.</p>
<p>And there is more we can do to strengthen our partnership and drive economic growth and prosperity across the region.</p>
<p>While in Washington, President Trump and I will discuss an Australia-United States partnership for the 21st Century, including how we can strengthen our economic links to create more jobs, and expand our national security cooperation.</p>
<p>I will also deliver the keynote address to the Winter Session of the National Governors Association, which this year is partnering with the Australian Embassy in Washington DC.</p>
<p>This is consistent with our objective of deepening engagement with the US at all levels of government, in particular on shared policy opportunities and challenges related to innovation, infrastructure, education and employment.</p>
