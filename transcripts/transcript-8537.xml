PRIME MINISTER 56/ 92<br />
GOLD COAST RAILWAY SITE INSPECTION<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, the Queensland Premier,<br />
Mr Goss and the State Transport Minister, Mr Hamill,<br />
today conducted the first site inspection of the $ 300<br />
million Gold Coast Railway.<br />
They inspected earthworks at Helensvale, north of the<br />
Gold Coast, where the track bed for the new railway is<br />
being prepared.<br />
The new Brisbane-Gold Coast link is scheduled to carry<br />
its first services in 1995 some 30 years after the<br />
original rail link was closed by the Coalition State<br />
Government.<br />
Mr Keating and Mr Goss announced that preliminary works<br />
worth more than $ 20 million were progressing or about to<br />
commence. Included in this figure are:<br />
earthworks at Lake Coombabah, next to Helensvale<br />
($ 2.75 million of works on a 2 kilometre site);<br />
a road-over-rail bridge on the Pacific Highway at<br />
Staplyton, near Beenleigh ( valued at $ 2.5 million);<br />
earthworks on a 20-kilometre section of the railway<br />
between the Albert and Coomera Rivers ( valued at $ 7<br />
million); a rail bridge over Main Street, Beenleigh ( valued at<br />
$ 2.3 million);<br />
a road-over-rail bridge contract at Nielsens Road,<br />
Carrara ( valued at $ 560,000);<br />
earthworks on a 5-kilometre section at Merrimac,<br />
near the site of the Robina station ( contract to be<br />
awarded shortly, valued at $ 6.2 million).<br />
The establishment of the new rail link, at a total cost<br />
of $ 330 million, is being funded jointly by the<br />
Queensland and Federal Governments. </p>
<p>The Federal Government will contribute up to $ 58.5<br />
million under the Building Better Cities program and a<br />
futher $ 15 million will contribute to the Kuraby<br />
Beenleigh section under the Commonwealth's Urban Public<br />
Transport program.<br />
Mr Keating said his visit to inspect work on the railway<br />
underlined the Federal Government's commitment to the<br />
project. " The decision to close the original rail link was<br />
extremely short-sighted.<br />
" The Gold Coast-Brisbane region has been growing into one<br />
of Australia major urban agglomerations, yet this<br />
development has had to take place without appropriate<br />
public transport.<br />
The environmental benefits of this major public transport<br />
facility will be considerable.<br />
" The Federal Government sees the benefit, as I outlined<br />
in the One Nation statement, of using rail links to unite<br />
the nation and helping it to work more efficiently and to<br />
better environmental effect.<br />
" There is no better place to start than replacing the<br />
valuable infrastructure on the Gold Coast which was, in<br />
effect, vandalised 30 years ago by a short-sighted<br />
coalition government."<br />
Mr Goss said the project also represented a huge capital<br />
investment in urban public transport infrastructure which<br />
is generating major employment and income for the region.<br />
" This project has provided hundreds of jobs at a time<br />
when those jobs are truly needed," Mr Goss said.<br />
" We are not just making work for the sake of work. We are<br />
building a major project to benefit Queensland well into<br />
the next century."<br />
Mr Hamill said the Gold Coast railway would restore a<br />
vital transit link between Brisbane and the Gold Coast.<br />
" This project will resurrect a link built with foresight<br />
more than a hundred years ago, and the ripped up<br />
unceremoniously by the National-Liberal State Government<br />
three decades ago," he said.<br />
" We promised in 1989 to rebuild this important rail link,<br />
and that promise is being fulfilled."<br />
