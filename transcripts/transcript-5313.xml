INTERVIEW WITH PETER HARVEY ~ 72<br />
Question: PriLme Minister, do you think the demonstration against you was organised?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Yes, it had to be organised, you wouldn'It have had that many people there<br />
if it-wasn't.<br />
Question: By whom?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, it is very hard to know, I think. I have asked for a report<br />
which I haven't yet had to date, but the Fitzroy City Council passed<br />
a resolution some days ago, deploring the fact that I had been asked<br />
to open this old people's nursing home. One of the councillors has<br />
clearly been making speeches saying he expects a large number of people<br />
to attend, that he couldn't guarantee that it would be peaceful.<br />
Mr Innes and other Labor Party people boycotted the opening which is<br />
most unusual for an apolitical function of that kind. Mr Innes had<br />
originally accepted, but then he withdrew, as I understand, around<br />
about the time the council passed its resolution.<br />
Question: For anybody who has seen the television news tape of the demonstration,<br />
it is pretty obvious it was more than your ordinary, run of the mill<br />
demo which I think you would expect and take in good part. It struck<br />
me as being fairly savage. How did affect you?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, it was savage, and I think it was very dif ficult for the police<br />
who I believe did a very good job in the circum! tances. People had<br />
not been * expecting a noisy demonstration,' or a violent one, and<br />
be-cause of that, what was to be an outdoor ceremony, was transferred<br />
so that it took place inside the church. But there was enormous distress<br />
caused to the aged and the elderly, the patients in this particular<br />
nursing home-who suddenly found the environment in which they were<br />
living turned into a most disruptive one with noise and abuse and<br />
missiles being hurled. I understand that the whole of the area looked<br />
a shambles this morning as a result of this and as a result of the<br />
activities yesterday. I don't understand that mentality of people<br />
who want to turn the opening of a nursing home into something of this<br />
kind because, the Commonwealth is spending, or has committed, well<br />
over $ 400 million. Money has been spent over the last few years, the<br />
programme goes on over the next two or three. These nursing homes<br />
have been built'all over the country, homes for elderly people. It is<br />
the first such home in Fitzroy. We have done it, this Government has<br />
provided it because of our concern, and I would have thought it something<br />
that everyone would want to applaud.<br />
Question: Ycu are concerned about the elderly folk. Do you think now there is<br />
an obligation on you to avoid situations like that? MONDAY, MARCH 31 1980 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, I don't. I really don't you can't have the circumstance in which<br />
a Prime Minister gets driven off a university campus or out of certain<br />
suburbs. We can't have a country in which Prime Ministers can only<br />
wa]. k in certain parts. As Prime Minister, I represent everyone, no<br />
matter where they come from, the Government's task is to govern for<br />
the whole country, not just for those who voted Liberal, or those who<br />
who might be regarded as our supporters. This is one country. This<br />
is one nation, and while I will be looking at my programme to see<br />
in what places Tamie should or shouldn't come with me, I'm never going<br />
to not go into a certain place because somebody like this particular<br />
city council might pass a resolution, or somebody else might organise<br />
a demonstration. I don't think the people of Australia would want me<br />
to. I don't think they would expect that of their Prime Minister. </p>
