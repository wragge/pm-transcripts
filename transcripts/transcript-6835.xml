FOR MEDIA 10 February 1986<br />
The Prime Minister announced that the Governor-General in<br />
Council had today approved the following Public Service<br />
appointments.<br />
Mr M. H. Codd, formerly Secretary, Department of Community<br />
Services, has been appointed Secretary, Department of the<br />
Prime Minister and Cabinet. Mr Codd has had extensive<br />
experience in the Department of the Prime Minister and<br />
Cabinet where he worked as a Deputy Secretary and Under<br />
Secretary during the period 1978-1981. He has also been<br />
Secretary, Department of Employment and Industrial Relations<br />
and Chairman of the Industries Assistance Commission.<br />
Mr Codd replaces Sir Geoffrey Yeend, AC, CBE, whose<br />
prospective retirement from the Service was announced by the<br />
Prime Minister last December.<br />
Mr G. E. Rees, Deputy Secretary, Department of Community<br />
Services, will be Acting Secretary of that Department until a<br />
permanent appointment is made.<br />
Mr R. M. Taylor, formerly Secretary, Department of Transport,<br />
has been appointed Secretary, Department of Aviation in place<br />
of Mr C. W. N. Freeland.<br />
Mr Freeland has been appointed Secretary, Department of<br />
Transport in place of Mr Taylor.<br />
Mr G. L. Miller, Director of the Economic Planning Advisory<br />
Council Secretariat, has been appointed Secretary, Department<br />
of Primary Industry. Mr Miller was a Deputy Secretary in the<br />
Department of Primary Industry prior to becoming Director of<br />
the EPAC Secretariat in 1983. An announcement will be made<br />
later on the assignment of Mr L. P. Duthie, formerly Secretary<br />
of the Department of Primary Industry.<br />
Mr D. W. Challen will be Acting Director of EPAC until a<br />
permanent appointment is made. The position will be<br />
advertised immediately. </p>
<p>Mr E. M. W. Visbord, OBE, formerly Deputy Secretary of the<br />
Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, has been appointed<br />
Secretary, Department of Employment and Industrial Relations.<br />
Mr Visbord has had extensive experience in the economic and<br />
financial fields in both the Treasury and the Department of<br />
the Prime Minister and Cabinet.<br />
Dr M. S. Keating, Secretary of the Department of Employment<br />
and Industrial Relations, is to be Secretary-designate of the<br />
Department of Finance and will take up his position as<br />
Secretary in approximately three months time, succeeding<br />
Mr I. Castles, OBE. In the interim Dr Keating will be<br />
available as an adviser to the Minister for Employment and<br />
Industrial Relations.<br />
Mr Castles, who has been the Secretary of the Department of<br />
Finance for more than seven years, has made it known to the<br />
Government that he would welcome the opportunity of moving to<br />
another suitable position at an appropriate time.<br />
Mr Castles' placement will be announced in due course. In<br />
the meantime, he will continue as Secretary, Department of<br />
Finance. </p>
<p>TELEX TO MEMBERS OF EPAC<br />
DIRECTOR OF EPAC<br />
The Government has decided that the present Director of<br />
EPAC, Mr Geoff Miller, is to be appointed Secretary of the<br />
Department of Primary Industry. In advising you of this<br />
decision, I would like to explain the particular<br />
circumstances that have led us with some reluctance to end<br />
his present association with EPAC.<br />
As you know, the rural sector is going through a<br />
particularly difficult period. Consequently the Government<br />
must take steps to ensure that rural policy and the<br />
administration of Government services to farmers are managed<br />
efficiently so as to help the rural sector recover and<br />
position it to continue to contribute in a significant way<br />
to national economic growth and export performance. As a<br />
former Director of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics ( and<br />
incidentally a former " Man of the Year" in Australian<br />
Agriculture) and as a former Deputy Secretary of the<br />
Department, Mr Miller has extensive experience of economic<br />
issues and of administration in rural affairs.<br />
Given the importance of national economic policy in relation<br />
to the rural sector, Mr Miller's EPAC experience will also<br />
be of considerable benefit, both in explaining the nature of<br />
Government economic policies clearly in rural policy<br />
discussions and in transmitting rural views on national<br />
economic issues to the Government.<br />
In taking this decision, I have had to give full weight to<br />
the importance of the work being done in EPAC and to the<br />
substantially improved output from the office in recent<br />
times. I believe that Mr Miller has got the Office to the<br />
stage of producing a good supply of top-rate papers for<br />
Council's consideration and broader public discussion. That<br />
success is reflected in the series of recently published<br />
Council papers and in the extensive media coverage of many<br />
important economic issues being considered by EPAC.<br />
Nevertheless, the Office's morale and continuing capacity to<br />
maintain this high standard are both matters of fine<br />
balance. This is particularly so given that a number of<br />
staff are contract employees. It is therefore, most<br />
important we, as a Council, pay particular attention to<br />
reinforcing the good work that our staff are now doing in<br />
the period between Mr Miller's departure early this week and<br />
the appointment of successor. </p>
<p>Mr Don Challen, one of the Office's Chief Economists will<br />
act as Director until a new appointment is made. Mr Challen<br />
has been working closely with Mr Miller for over 2 years and<br />
has, on a number of occasions, acted as Director for short<br />
periods. I have no doubt that he will be able to manage<br />
Council's affairs capably until a permanent appointment is<br />
made. The decisions will be advertised as soon as possible,<br />
and every effort will be made to find the best available<br />
candidate to carry on this important work.<br />
As I have said, I have made this decision with some<br />
reluctance, notwithstanding the fact that it constitutes a<br />
promotion for Mr Miller. In no way should it be interpreted<br />
as indicating any dimunition of the role of EPAC, or of the<br />
significance that the Government attaches to it. As I said<br />
to you at the dinner immediately prior to the December<br />
meeting, I now believe that EPAC is beginning to make its<br />
mark as a source of economic advice, and the Government<br />
looks to the Council's contribution to be consolidated and<br />
further extended in the years ahead.<br />
R. J. L. Hawke<br />
Prime Minister </p>
