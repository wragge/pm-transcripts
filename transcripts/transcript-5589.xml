ADDRESS TO N. S. W. STATE LIBERAL PARTY<br />
PRESIDENT'S DINNER<br />
SYDNEY<br />
I am delighted that so many of you are here tonight to support<br />
the Liberal Party. The support of Party members is vital to<br />
the independence as well as the effectiveness of our Party.<br />
Our most important tasks today are to make Australia strong and<br />
competitive, humane and free, and confident in the face of<br />
the future. I believe we are succeeding in those tasks.<br />
All Liberals, and all Australians, can surely see this.<br />
We want to pass on to our children an Australia whose future<br />
is not in doubt and we want to communicate to our children those<br />
values which will enable Australia to fulfil its great promise.<br />
I firmly believe that the Liberal Party has given that lead.<br />
In 1975 we saw the dangers to Australia. We have been determined<br />
that Australia will not go the way of other countries, whose<br />
prosperity has been undermined by bloated bureacracy,<br />
confiscatory taxes, and over-centralised Government. We have<br />
determined not to allow every group to take for themselveseverything<br />
they could, without ever asking what they could put<br />
back for the good of the country as a whole or their own<br />
children. That was the road Australia was on in 1975. It is no<br />
longer on that road. For five years our policies have<br />
consistently asserted that we cannot afford to spend more than.<br />
we produce without the risk of inflation, unemployment and<br />
social division.<br />
To Liberals, the real strength of Australia is its people -their<br />
values., their abilities, their skills and their imagination.<br />
We have maintained since 1975, that the Australian economy<br />
needed policies which would give it the room, and the<br />
encouragement, to grow policies of lower taxes, less<br />
bureaucracy and less costly regulation. We said that with such<br />
policies, Australia would rapidly recover its vigour and<br />
its magnificent future. I think that we are at last putting<br />
behind us the age of unrealistic expectations, when there was<br />
a feeling that people only needed to ask, for Governments to be<br />
entitled to spend. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
This Government will not mortgage the-future of Australia.<br />
Government in Australia is now facing much more frankly those<br />
difficult but inevitable questions of priorities, which are<br />
what Government is really about. For Government to keep.<br />
growing undermines prosperity and all our other<br />
objectives. It is absurd to assume that Government can<br />
spend a larger proportion of the nation's wealth year after<br />
year. If Government is to do more of some things it must think<br />
much more seriously about reallocating resources from one<br />
activity to another. We should not assume that it can<br />
carelessly take more resources from private people to do this.<br />
Government needs to become much more streamlined and efficient:*Ã±<br />
to meet the challenges, and to seize the opportunities, of<br />
the eighties. This is in no . way a doctrine of austerity.<br />
It does not mean that the community as a whole must make do<br />
with less. Responsible Government of the kind I am talking about means<br />
that we are all going to be a great deal better off in the future.<br />
Our tax cut from 1 July this year will put approximately--<br />
$ 500 million more in Australian taxpayers' pockets. Responsible<br />
Government means that Australia is going to be stronger and<br />
more prosperous. It means that Government.--is going to be able to do<br />
much more than in the past to assist those who really need help.<br />
Our decisive rejection of Socialist policies, of endless growth<br />
in bureaucracy, taxes and regulation is bringing about in<br />
Australia the-eb-onomic recovery-f which we-are all aware.<br />
It is nice not to have to argue these days that the economy,<br />
is starting to do well.<br />
People recognise now that Australia is growing quite strongly,<br />
more strongly than other countries such as-Britain or the--<br />
United States -in fact the growth predicted for Australia<br />
this year is faster than for any other advanced industrial country.<br />
Normally, as a trading nation, Australia feels keenly the ups<br />
and downs of world trade. But our policies up to this point<br />
have given us the capacity to move against the tide. While the<br />
economies of some other countries are shrinking, ours is<br />
pushing rapidly ahead. Inflation one of the most insidious,<br />
divisive ills which can afflict a society has been<br />
strongly cut back. Private enterprise has taken heart, and<br />
-in the two years to last December, has provided nearly a quarter<br />
of a million new jobs for Australians. This is far more jobs<br />
than Mr. Hayden's make-work schemes paid for by the taxpayer<br />
could ever have provided. As a result, unemployment is now<br />
falling well and in April this year was the lowest for<br />
four years.<br />
Prosperity, too, can of course have its own problems. We have<br />
to be constantly on the alert against renewed inflation. We<br />
need to make sure that there are enough skilled people to take<br />
advantage of the opportunities growth and development are<br />
bringing. But I would much prefer the problems of prosperity to<br />
those of recession and stagnation. </p>
<p>-3<br />
This change in the outlook for Australia has not come about<br />
by accident. I think people have taken-heart from the fact<br />
that almost for the first time, we are showing in this country<br />
that it is possible to reverse the decline which the Socialist<br />
policies of big spending and high taxes brought about.--<br />
Provided that Governments have the heart and the will to do<br />
what they know to be right there is nothing inevitable about<br />
bigger bureaucracy, more regulation, higher taxes and stagnation.<br />
And never has our direction been made plainer than in the<br />
recent decisions we have announced.<br />
The decisions arising from Sir Phillip Lynch's Committee of<br />
Review, the decisions on health arrangements, and at the recent:<br />
Premiers' Conference, all show unmistakeably our determnination.-<br />
to take advantage of the opportunities Australia now has.<br />
Government should play a constructive and positive role in<br />
Australia's development, not a stifling and oppressive role.<br />
The Lynch Committee decisions are perhaps the clearest<br />
indication of the historic turnaround we are now making toward."<br />
a more modern and streamlined role for Government.<br />
Under Labor, Commonwealth employment grew by no less than 52,000).<br />
We have already cut back the number of Commonwealth Public<br />
Servants under staff ceilings by over 10,000 and we aim to<br />
reduce the number further by some 16,000 or 17,000. Along with<br />
these decisions, I announced a very large number of further<br />
decisions arising from the same review some 350 decisions in all.<br />
These decisions aime at rationalising and streamlining the<br />
functions of the Commonwealth Government, and withdrawing from<br />
functions more appropriate for the States to handle, or which<br />
would be much better undertaken by private enterprise. These<br />
decisions recognised that in recent years particularly Government<br />
regulations-and demands for business to fill in forms, were<br />
becoming too costly and actually creating inefficiencies.<br />
As a result we decided to Abolish the Prices Justification Tribunal.<br />
We decided to give Qantas greater control over its own affairs,<br />
including increased flexibility in setting its own fares. We<br />
wanted Qantas to run its own business without the Department of<br />
Transport breathing down its neck at every turn.<br />
We will be cutting down on the-demand for business to fill out.<br />
forms for Government and all Ministers, Departments and<br />
authorities have been directed to make sure that they are not<br />
demanding unnecessary information from business.<br />
As the economy picks up we also believe that business can stan~ d<br />
much more on its own feet go we have taken some measures to<br />
reduce the level of industry assistance. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
I want-to emphasise that the-Lynch Committee's review was<br />
not just a cost cutting exercise. It gave practical expression<br />
to the way of life we seek for this country, a way of life<br />
which rejects an all-embracing role for, government, which<br />
seeks a streamlined,-* government for the age of growth and<br />
expansion ' that lies ahead, and which relies heavily on the<br />
initiatives and efforts of individuals. The review will,<br />
however, -produce a very useful saving to taxpayers amoilhting.<br />
ultimately to some $ 560 million a year, at a very<br />
conservative estimate.<br />
One of our major objectives has been to reduce unnecessary<br />
duplication and overlap between the Commonwealth and the<br />
States. This is reflected especially in our decisions on<br />
health arrangements. In health, we are ending dual control over<br />
public hospitals and what an absurd arrangement it was to have<br />
two bureaucracies trying to run hospitals. If one cannot do it,<br />
it is certain that two won't.<br />
The expiration of the hospital cost sharing agreements on<br />
June this year ( after a year's extension) has given us the<br />
opportunity to establish a much more rational and sensible way<br />
of providing hospital services. How could you have a sensible<br />
way of handling hospital and health costs when people could get<br />
free treatment at public hospitals no matter how well-off they are.<br />
The aim behind our recent decisions is to make sure that the<br />
disadvantaged are protected so they do not have to pay for health<br />
care which they need and cannot afford, but at the same time to<br />
make sure that the taxpayers do not bear the brunt of the health<br />
costs of-the well-to-do. We believe that all of this is<br />
sensible, and based on -sound _ principles-which-everyone would<br />
wish to see put into practice.<br />
The responsibility for making-sure that Government plays a<br />
sensible and constructive role in the future is not just a<br />
responsibility for the Commonwealth alone. It involves the<br />
States as well as the Commonwealth. It is not generally realised<br />
that State and local governments spend just over half of all the'<br />
money spent by Governments in Australia. But at the same time<br />
they raise less than one fifth of all the taxes. The<br />
Commonwealth raises the rest.<br />
It is easy to let the Commonwealth raise its taxes while the<br />
States can reduce theirs. Indeed Mr. Wran was able to say in<br />
his 1980-81 Budget speech that " for the fifth year in a row,<br />
there will be no increase in the rates of State Budget taxes"<br />
In fact, he gave further tax concessions in relation to death<br />
duties, and payroll tax. But he. is not so happy when the<br />
Commonwealth Government acts to protect the taxpayer, which<br />
is what we were doing in our decisions at the recent<br />
Premiers' Conference. </p>
<p>The taxpayers' pocket is not bottomless-.,-Government cannot go<br />
on asking taxpayers to pay for more and more. And how many<br />
taxpayers believe it is legitimate to raise taxes to fund the<br />
activities of political parties? How can-Mr. Wran teU... me<br />
that he is short of money and that he needs more from the<br />
Commonwealth, when he places high on his priorities the<br />
giving of money to the Labor Party?<br />
What sort of new priority is this, at a time when most<br />
people want Government spending to be cut back? If that is<br />
the measure of Mr. Wran' s social concern, then let me say<br />
that it is not the Liberal Party's.<br />
In asking the Statds to accept restraints on spending,<br />
our major concern is to protect the taxpayer of this country.<br />
We believe that the taxpayers need a fair go. Our policies<br />
are directed to making sure that Governments can perform<br />
their functions effectively while at the same time establishing<br />
the conditions under which taxes could be brought back further.<br />
Our philosophy of Government can open the door to a<br />
magnificent future for Australia. Up to the advent of this<br />
Liberal Government, Governments accepted that they could<br />
raise more and more taxes. They even assumed that this<br />
would be a public good. we are reversing that trend.<br />
There must be a limit to the additional demands that can be<br />
placed by Government on taxpayers. Governments cannot go on<br />
doing more and more things, spending more and more money,<br />
without causin -grievous-damage-to-this-country.-<br />
When I, talk about a turnaround, this is the crux of what<br />
I mean. The turnaround means a halt to unreasonable demands<br />
upon taxpayers. What we have already achieved has given the<br />
lead-to other-countries. -It-provides a basis for genuine<br />
optimism about the future. It shows that the obstacles<br />
to progress in the form of larger bureaucracy, higher taxes<br />
and more stringent regulations can be overthrown.<br />
In the interests of us all, and of our children, and of<br />
future generations, I say that the Liberal cause must be<br />
advanced, promoted and supported throughout this country.<br />
