<p>It is often said that political parties are judged not only on what they have done in the past but also what they plan for the future. </p>
<p>My Government is proud of its record of strong economic management. </p>
<p>Keeping the Budget in balance has allowed us to provide for defence and national security, health, education, roads and the environment and lay out a $10 billion national plan for water security.<br />
 The Australian public has now been waiting 11 years to hear how the Labor Party proposes to keep the $1 trillion Australian economy strong and prosperous into the future. </p>
<p>They are still waiting. </p>
<p>The Labor Party conference over the weekend provided a perfect platform for the Opposition leader to outline a clear and credible plan to maintain the prosperity that Australia has enjoyed for 16 years in a row.  </p>
<p>Economic growth is not a given. It requires careful, responsible stewardship and the willingness to take the tough decisions now to ensure that growth continues for the next generation of Australian families. </p>
<p>Instead of an economic blueprint, the Labor Party spent the weekend working out the best way to turn back the clock and reassert union influence in the workplace, even though just 15 per cent of the private sector workforce now belongs to a union.  </p>
<p>With no debate at all, the Opposition leader caved in, handing the union bosses everything they wanted.   </p>
<p>The only subject up for discussion was uranium mining, an issue that the Liberal Party debated and resolved its position on a generation ago.  </p>
<p>Time has moved on. The Labor Party must catch-up and outline a 21st Century plan to secure Australia's economic future.  </p>
