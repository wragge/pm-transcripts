PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRAN~ SCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, WORLD CONGRESS CENTRE, MELBOURNE, 15 JUNE 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
Js Mr Keating, do you support the Democrats' idea of a code of<br />
conduct for Ministers?<br />
PM: I don't know that it's the Democrats' idea. It's only at<br />
this stage as I understand it, floating around in<br />
dis cussion<br />
JS Do you support the principle?<br />
PM: We've always supported the principle. It is the Senate<br />
which has . voted against disclosure. Every House of<br />
Representatives Member discloses interests and the previous<br />
Prime Minister and myself have insisted that ministers<br />
behave to a code, if not one chiselled in stone.<br />
J: Mr Keating, on superannuation, the Democrats remain<br />
unconvinced that the superannuation guarantee levy won't<br />
cost jobs; what else can you dQ to persuade them otherwise?<br />
PM: The thing is it is the Government which has taken over the<br />
years primary carriage of macro-economic policy.. We started<br />
with superannuation to give workers a decent standard of<br />
living in retirement. We started with that in the middle<br />
19809. Today we are looking at an inflation rate of 1.7 per<br />
cent. We're the ones to best make the judgement, we're the<br />
ones most competently placed to make that judgement. And we<br />
assert, and I think assert without fear of contradiction,<br />
that we can afford payments by employers to superannuation<br />
without a macro-economic risk. That is, without the<br />
inflation rate rising.<br />
J: The employers themselves, the ones who will be making the<br />
payments, they also insist that they will have to shed jobs. </p>
<p>You don't give their concern any credence?<br />
PM: No because what the Government is asking of them would mean<br />
the devotion of even just about roughly 30 per cent of the<br />
productivity improvements which are likely to come through<br />
the economy. So it's a relatively small, affordable,<br />
manageable colt which will give Australian workers a decent<br />
standard of living in retirement and build a pool of<br />
national savings. That's what I think is important, but if<br />
we had taken the view that superannuation would upset the<br />
inflation rate and the future prospects of the economy we<br />
wouldn't have done it in the 1980s and we wouldn't be<br />
sitting now with an inflation rate of 1.7 per cent.<br />
J1 Mr Keating, do you support another interest rate cut?<br />
PM: I'm not here to discuss interest rates.<br />
J1 What do you think of the Herald-Sun campaign Mr Keating?<br />
PM: The Herald-Sun is obviously pamphleteering for the Liberal<br />
Party. Last week they editorialised against the Government<br />
and today they have as their front page lead a story which<br />
comes from the Liberal Party's policy of six months ago on a<br />
prediction about employment. growth which Mr Hewson has<br />
himself disowned. He said it was only a guesstimate,<br />
Fightback wasn't a model, in fact he said in the House of<br />
Representatives, ' repeat Fightback wasn't modelled'. in<br />
other words and when asked on radio about the two million<br />
job., Dr Howson said well it's not real world. So for a<br />
story which is six months oldt not real world, denied in the<br />
House of Representatives, is the front page lead in the<br />
Herald-Sun. I think Victorians ought to reasonably assume<br />
that the Herald-Sun is no longer carrying news to them but<br />
carrying the political views of the Liberal Party of<br />
Australia and that this newspaper has decided to phampleteer<br />
and editorialise for and on behalf of the Liberal Party of<br />
Australia.<br />
Jt Is this coming from the proprietor do you think?<br />
PM: I don't think so. I think it's coming basically from the<br />
Editor and the editorial staff.<br />
J: Mr Keating, if the Democrat's push for a 4 per cent<br />
superannuation levy instead of a 5 per cent, will you accept<br />
that?<br />
PM: I'm not here to discuss that. Now why would I respond to<br />
that in a stand up news conference in a hotel?<br />
J1 Would a ministerial code of conduct Marshall Island<br />
affair.. </p>
<p>PM: No. no we have had that, I've answered that before for you.<br />
Are there any others?<br />
Ja There are mixed signals about the economy and whether it's<br />
recovering, do you think it's time for a cut in interest<br />
rates?<br />
P11: Well you asked me that a minute ago. Look the economy is<br />
recovering, we had the Blusiness Council of Australia<br />
yesterday saying a recovery was one That in the<br />
organisation which speaks for our largest companies, they<br />
said a recovery is on. We've had the national accounts show<br />
2 per cent non-f arm growth for the past three quarters. A<br />
recovery is definitely proceeding. While the recovery is<br />
not proceeding evenly around Australia and it is much to the<br />
lament that it is not proceeding as strongly in Victoria,<br />
the fact is that it is still proceeding and the Government<br />
will just make judgments as time goes by about what things<br />
it should do in the macro-economic settings to maintain that<br />
recovery and strengthen it.<br />
ENDS A. </p>
