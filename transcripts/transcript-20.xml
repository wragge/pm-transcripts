COMMONWEALTH'OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
Rt. Hon. R. MENZIES, M. H. R.<br />
ON<br />
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS<br />
[ From the " 1Parliamentary Debates," 20th March, 1946.1<br />
Mr. MENZIES ( Kooyong-Leader of<br />
the Opposition) [ 5.16].-In the course<br />
of his informative paper the ' Minister<br />
for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt), has, of<br />
necessity, covered a vast field. If debate<br />
is to be useful it is idle for the rest of<br />
us to endeavour to go over the whole of<br />
the ground. I therefore propose, within<br />
the limits of reasonable parliamentary<br />
time, to concentrate upon those aspects<br />
of international affairs-particularly as<br />
they touch the European settlementwhich<br />
are of immediate and urgent importance.<br />
The Minister stated three<br />
basic principles of Australian policy with<br />
respect to Europe. The first of them was<br />
that Australia, as a belligerent in the<br />
European war, is entitled to participate<br />
f ully in decisions relating to the<br />
European peace settlement; and that the<br />
establishment of a just and democratic<br />
peace in Europe is essential to the<br />
security of Britain and all British<br />
Dominions. The second was that while<br />
the leadership of the thre * e major powers<br />
is accepted, other directly interested<br />
belligerents must be brought into consultation<br />
on important peace arrangements,<br />
especially those affecting tcrritorial<br />
adjustments. The third was that<br />
2339. we must consistently maintain the right<br />
of all active belligerents to a full share<br />
in the framing of the peace.<br />
These principles will not provoke contr'oversy<br />
unless they contain an assumption<br />
' that Australia is a completely<br />
separate nation, which may regard all<br />
its international problems from a purely<br />
individual point -of view. If it is true,<br />
as I believe, and the Minister himself<br />
stated, that we cannot contract out of<br />
Europe it is equally true that we must<br />
not contract out of the British Empire.<br />
Great Britain is one of the three major<br />
powers whose leadership is accepted,<br />
largely because of its position at the<br />
head of a family of nations. I want to<br />
emphasize that. It is -all too frequently<br />
forgotten that if Great Britain and each<br />
of the Domninions is to pursue its path<br />
on these foreign matters as if completely<br />
independent of the others, as if they<br />
were completely separate nations, then<br />
not only will such action diminish the<br />
real value of our own voice, because we<br />
lose the benefit of the family association,<br />
but it will niost seriously diminish the<br />
strength which Great Britain itself can<br />
exercise, because its strength is not </p>
<p>merely that of 45,000,000 people in one<br />
quarter of the world, but of a vast<br />
association of people all over the world.<br />
In respect of all international councils<br />
and conferences, therefore, the fullest<br />
pre-consultation should occur between<br />
Great Britain and the Dominions, with<br />
a view to a joint policy. It is no answer<br />
to this to say that a British Empire bloc<br />
is inconsistent with the United Nations<br />
Charter or organization, or that it may<br />
provoke counter-blocs. Honorable members<br />
have read in the press observations<br />
criticizing the idea of an Empire bloc.<br />
I believe that a strong and cohesive<br />
British Empire is vital to the success of<br />
the United Nations, and that the special<br />
association, organic and functional, of<br />
the British Empire countries is so unique<br />
and so utterly distinguished from temporary<br />
alliances or groups, that to refer<br />
to it as a bloc is to ignore its history<br />
and to falsify its true character. The<br />
rest of the world, though it has understood<br />
this association imperfectly, has for<br />
many years recognized it by accepting<br />
Empire preference as not inconsistent<br />
with the most-favoured-nation clause in<br />
international trade treaties. The basic<br />
defect of the Australian Government's<br />
policy or, at any rate, the policy of the<br />
present Minister for External Affairs, is<br />
-in practice and probably also in theory<br />
-that it aims at utter independence of<br />
Australian thought and action-which.<br />
for 7,000,000 people in a remote island<br />
continent is more pretentious than<br />
sensible-as if no special British relationship<br />
existed at all.<br />
I turn now to say something about<br />
the United Nations organization. Last<br />
week the right honorable gentleman rather<br />
took some of us to task-not by name,<br />
but in substance-for having referred to<br />
the United Nations organization as experimental.<br />
I confess freely that on more<br />
than one occasion I have contrasted the<br />
experimental quality of that organization<br />
with the tried quality, over a very long<br />
period . and under all sorts of difficulties,<br />
of the British Empire association. The<br />
United Nations organization is unquestionably<br />
an experiment though it is<br />
one which strives towards an ideal which<br />
is supported by all decent humanity. It<br />
is experimental in the sense that, if used<br />
wrongly or approached in the wrong way, its Council may turn out to be little more<br />
than an angry debating society enjoying<br />
a world audience, but emphasizing and<br />
exacerbating international divisions;<br />
whilst, if used as an instrument of collaboration<br />
with constant emphasis upon<br />
the absolute importance of peace and<br />
international justice and tolerance, it can<br />
help in the deliverance of mankind from<br />
the scourge. Let me elaborate this a<br />
little. We all suffer from the temptation<br />
to treat an international peace organization<br />
as if it were an organic structure,<br />
with legislative and executive arms, able<br />
to legislate, to judge, and to enforce.<br />
There is a further temptation, as we saw<br />
before the war, to treat the problem of<br />
national security as more or less disposed<br />
of by the creation of a league and the<br />
contractual entry into the obligaions of<br />
a charter. This is a dangerous fallacy.<br />
In the present instance the Charter,<br />
whilst it deals with many matters, leaves<br />
untouched the relations between the<br />
Great Powers. They, with some others,<br />
meet in the Security Council in what<br />
is in reality a conference, with facilities<br />
for discussion but with no major obligations<br />
or commitments. What is described<br />
a. " the veto" amounts to nothing more<br />
than this-that in this conference no<br />
major power is subject to compulsion, and<br />
that the only pressure is that of argument<br />
or of world opinion. I pause here to say<br />
that when I refer to the veto I refer to<br />
something which is there. I do not desire<br />
to go back to the discussion as to whether<br />
there should be any recognition of a<br />
veto. That matter was fully thrashed<br />
out at San Francisco. It became clear<br />
that some of the Great Powers would<br />
not find their way into this scheme unless<br />
the power of veto were reserved to them.<br />
Mr. ANwroNRY.--an there be discussion<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-There can be discussion,<br />
but no decisions in the presence<br />
of opposition from the power concerned.<br />
I refer to that as something which is<br />
there-something which the Minister for<br />
External Affairs regrets, since he fought<br />
against it. But it is there, because it was<br />
one of the conditions on which the<br />
Charter itself came into existence. So<br />
long as it is there, meetings of the<br />
Council, and meetings between the Great<br />
Powers, are conferences, and it would be </p>
<p>a fallacy for people to believe that those<br />
meetings will produce, against the will of<br />
any one power, some legislative result or<br />
some executive action.<br />
In brief, we have here a piece of<br />
machinery which the powers may use for<br />
a genuine exchange of ideas, a genuine<br />
investigation of differences, a real cooperation<br />
in an attack upon some of the<br />
national or economic or social causes of<br />
the world's problems, but which equally<br />
they may use for the pursuing of purely<br />
national ends. If the nations come to<br />
such a conference to pursue objectives of<br />
power, or to seek advantages unrelated to<br />
world peace-in brief, to play out a game<br />
of international politics-the machinery<br />
may prove disastrous to world peace, the<br />
delegates becoming the vocal champions<br />
of conflicting ideas and interests, and<br />
small disputes growing into great ones<br />
in the forcing house of publicity and propaganda.<br />
These reflections, which I believe are<br />
realistic, lead to the conclusion that this<br />
new league, like the old, can rise no higher<br />
than its source, its source being the goodwill<br />
of the individual nations composing<br />
it. Its existence, realistically considered,<br />
: bsolves no nation from the obligation to<br />
provide for its own defence, to maintain<br />
a steady and firm course in foreign policy,<br />
or, as I shall point out, to cultivate its<br />
special friendships with such nations as<br />
-ave common interests with it. It is<br />
. ssential for these reasons that we refer<br />
to the United Nations organization as<br />
experimental It must be tried, but<br />
not beyond its strength, and its true nature<br />
must not be mistaken.<br />
If some of us continue to emphasize<br />
that the British Empire is not experimental,<br />
but tried and proved, it is merely<br />
because we know that every nucleus of<br />
peace and non-aggression and good-will<br />
within the international structure is a<br />
mighty source of strength for the United<br />
Nations organization. It is just at this<br />
point that Mr. Churchill's Fulton speech<br />
has been so gravely misinterpreted. To<br />
issue a call to the British and American<br />
peoples for a close fraternal association<br />
in the cause of peace is not to threaten<br />
any nation and least of all the peaceloving<br />
nations.<br />
Mr. WARD.-It has been referred to as<br />
an appeal for a military alliance. Mr. MENZIES.-It was not, and Mr.<br />
Churchill has repeatedly said that it was<br />
not. However, if the Government<br />
believes that it was a call for a military<br />
alliance I begin to understand some of<br />
the things about its policy that I previously<br />
did not understand. I repeat that<br />
to issue a call for a close fraternal association<br />
is not to threaten the peace of the<br />
world. The truth is that mutual understanding<br />
and tolerance in this world are<br />
constantly impeded by a host of circumstances-<br />
differences of racial tradition,<br />
differences of language, differences of<br />
religious outlook, differences of political<br />
institutions, differences in public educational<br />
development, and many more. To<br />
ignore these things while endeavouring<br />
to set up a new world international order,<br />
particularly one in which the postulated<br />
use of concerted international force to<br />
control national aggression, points, however<br />
vaguely, towards the first rudimentary<br />
shape of an international super-<br />
State, would be fatal. The United<br />
Nations organization will not spring fully<br />
grown from the womb of war and bitterness;<br />
it will be a slow growth if it is to be<br />
a strong one.<br />
The real case for close and abiding association<br />
between the English-speaking<br />
peoples is that, by natural evolution from<br />
a large common racial and traditional<br />
stock, they possess a common love of individual<br />
freedom, a common language, a<br />
common religious outlook, common political<br />
institutions, and a similar public<br />
educational development. These elements<br />
were not produced by any treaty,<br />
nor do they need a formil treaty for<br />
their continuance. But they offer a solid<br />
foundation for a special assdciation which<br />
will mean a building of reality into the<br />
United Nations organization itself. It<br />
is indeed unfortunate that anybody in the<br />
United States of America should<br />
perceive in the stating of these<br />
truths the making of some special<br />
c-se for an Anglo-American treaty<br />
with all the legalities and set commitments<br />
which treaties involve. But it is more<br />
than unfortunate, it is tragic; that the<br />
leader of the Soviet Union, whose efforts<br />
in the common struggle and through a<br />
period of splendid mutual assistance have<br />
moved the hearts of beth British and<br />
Americans alike, should find in a plea for </p>
<p>continued Anglo-American association<br />
merely the assertion of a brutal doctrine<br />
of racial superiority-a doctrine for the<br />
defeat of which both nations have poured<br />
out blood and treasure in two great wars<br />
-and a threat of war against all nations<br />
who refuse to acknowledge what he<br />
describes as Anglo-American domination.<br />
It is always difficult to judge in respect<br />
of countries where government is by the<br />
authority of a limited few, where there<br />
is a controlled press, and propaganda<br />
achieves unchecked and uncriticized<br />
power, whether statements of this kind<br />
are made for home consumption or for<br />
literal . acceptance by the world. But as<br />
they have been made, it is necessary that<br />
there should come from both the British<br />
Empire and the United States, through<br />
the mouths of responsible public men of<br />
all parties and of all political opinions,<br />
a good round declaration that we indeed<br />
have no thoughts of aggression. We<br />
desire to live and let live in peace. In<br />
very truth we seek no aggrandisement<br />
territorial or other The one thing we<br />
seek for ourselves and for others is the<br />
right to live free lives in a world of men<br />
who through peace shall have come to<br />
prosperity. It would be idle to pretend that the<br />
world is not at this moment in an apprehensive<br />
and pessimistic mood, and that<br />
the greatest factors producing this mood<br />
are not the policy and the actions of the<br />
Soviet Union. The issue was stated by<br />
the Minister for External Affairs in these<br />
words-The real question is, not whether the Soviet<br />
Union territory and zones of influence have<br />
expanded, but what is the underlying intention<br />
and purpose of the Soviet Union. Is it to<br />
secure the political domination of other<br />
countries, or is it merely to protect Russia<br />
against any repetition of the so-called cordon<br />
sanitaire which united all reactionary influence<br />
in Europe against her during the<br />
period between the two great wars? Is it<br />
aggressive in substance, or defensive in substance?<br />
That is the great question.<br />
There are involved in this question implications<br />
which cannot be accepted. The<br />
chief of them is that extensions of Soviet<br />
territory and zones of influence are to be<br />
regarded as faits accomplis and that if<br />
they are based merely upon a desire for<br />
national defence and the development of<br />
the Russian economy, they may be accepted as internationally legitimate and<br />
proper. Rightly or wrongly, this proposition<br />
is so reminiscent of the case which<br />
w'as made out for Hitler's lebensraum<br />
before the war and the earlier irredentist<br />
movement in Italy that it obviously calls<br />
for the closest examination.<br />
It is curiously ironical that having<br />
made the statement just quoted, which<br />
is the very quintessence of what would<br />
have been called appeasement before<br />
the war, the Minister immediately went<br />
on to condemn in terms the Munich era<br />
of appeasement of Hitler and his Axis<br />
associates In the course of doing so,<br />
a very curious exchange occurred. The<br />
Minister said this-<br />
I repeat that, in the Munich era of appeasement<br />
of Hitler and his Axis associates, there<br />
w'as the greatest inclination on the part of<br />
somne Western democracies to isolate the Soviet<br />
Union, and to hail Hitler as the saviour of<br />
civilization against the so-called Bolshevik<br />
hordes. Earlier, the Minister had very boldly<br />
said, in reply to an interjection by<br />
me, that he could quote some of my<br />
own speeches in support of his contention.<br />
I should like him to do so; in fact I<br />
should like him to find any speech made<br />
by responsible Ministers, in Great Britain<br />
or Australia, which represented Hitler<br />
and his people as the saviours of civilization<br />
against the so-called " Bolshevik<br />
hordes The Minister went on to say-<br />
I am saying that Russia, between the two<br />
wars. was treated as outside the pale and was<br />
not brought into an alliance against Hitler.<br />
Until Hitler actually attacked Soviet Russia,<br />
no arrangement with it was entered into by<br />
the Western powers.<br />
Then, an interjection by the honorable<br />
member for Warringah ( Mr. Spender)<br />
reminded him of the German-Russian<br />
agreement. This is a most curious<br />
account of pre-war history. It leaves out<br />
of the picture altogether the fact that,<br />
at the very moment when British representatives<br />
were in Moscow conducting<br />
negotiations with the Soviet authorities;<br />
an announcement was made on the 21st<br />
August, 1939-a fortnight before the<br />
war-of a German-Soviet pact. We<br />
would indeed be blind to history if we did<br />
not think that the bringing into existence<br />
of that pact had something to do with<br />
the ultimate launching, very shortly afterwards,<br />
of the German attack upon Poland. </p>
<p>At that very moment, the British authorities,<br />
following visits of months before,<br />
were in negotiation with the Soviet<br />
authorities. All this is brushed aside by<br />
the statement that Russia was not brought<br />
into the picture, and that the attitude of<br />
the Western democracies, including Great<br />
Britain, was one of supporting Hitler,<br />
and of being violently opposed to the<br />
Soviet. Having said all these things,<br />
the Minister concluded by saying-<br />
I take the view that the Soviet Union's<br />
policy is directed towards self-protection and<br />
security against future attack. In my opinion<br />
its desire is to develop its own economy and<br />
improve the welfare of its peoples.<br />
The Minister should be aware that, if<br />
lie were to find this very sentence, substituting<br />
Germany for the Soviet<br />
Union in . a speech by a British statesman<br />
after the Anschluss and the absorpon<br />
of Czechoslovakia, he would, in the<br />
light of later events, condemn it as either<br />
feeble or reactionary. This is not to say<br />
that he is prima facie wrong, or that our<br />
policy must be one of hostility to Russia,<br />
or that the parallels of history are to -be<br />
projected too far; but it does render it<br />
necessary to clarify our minds by facing<br />
up to and analysing as clearly as-possible<br />
the state of affairs with which we are<br />
now confronted.<br />
If I have recalled the mind of the<br />
Minister to some recent history no<br />
pology need be made, for in his written<br />
paper as amplified in answer to interjections<br />
in the House he has himself gone<br />
to some trouble to distort history.<br />
The charge that Great Britain, as one<br />
of the Western democracies, showed the<br />
reatest inclination to " hail Hitler as<br />
the saviour of civilization against the socalled<br />
Bolshevik hordes" is sheer nonsense.<br />
That there were some few people<br />
in Great Britain who took this view need<br />
not be denied. But to attribute it as a<br />
policy to Great Britain itself is merely<br />
another indication of a bias in respect of<br />
Great Britain which the Minister would<br />
do well to learn to modify.<br />
But to return to the particular problem<br />
of Russia to-day: I tubmit for the consideration<br />
of the House a series of propositions<br />
which seem to me to be relevant to<br />
such a supremely important matter. In<br />
dealing with or assessing actions or intentions<br />
of a foreign power, particularly one in which political institutions and<br />
philosophy differ so sharply from our<br />
own, there is always the danger of oversimplification.<br />
This danger is to be<br />
avoided. It is not a question of being<br />
pro-Russian or anti-Russian. If we<br />
glibly group other nations into those<br />
which are always right and those which<br />
are always wrong, we shall commit a<br />
childish error, and the end will be<br />
disaster. The Soviet Union has by the<br />
harsh labours of war earned the right to<br />
an understanding hearing and a calm and<br />
objective judgment by the Western<br />
democracies. It is therefore necessary<br />
for us-and that, alas, with imperfect<br />
information-to sort out our ideas about<br />
Russia, avoiding rhetoric and preconceived<br />
ideas, but aiming at realism and<br />
not being afraid of the realistic view.<br />
It is unreasonable to expect Russians to<br />
think in just the same way as we do or<br />
to have a similar background. The<br />
social and political mental atmosphere of<br />
the Soviet Union is, as Communist<br />
literature makes clear, anti-reformist and<br />
pro-revolutionary. The precedent<br />
broadening down to precedent" which<br />
characterizes British constitutional<br />
history is, with small exceptions,<br />
reformist and not revolutionary. It is not<br />
to -be supposed that a people whose<br />
greatest modern political and social<br />
changes have been achieved by direct<br />
action and by revolutionary violence itself<br />
will have any sentimental inhibitions on<br />
the question of establishing an international<br />
political position by direct action.<br />
Our people over centuries have succeeded<br />
in reconciling monarchy with democracy.<br />
The Russians destroyed monarchy to<br />
establish a republic and, abjuring what<br />
they regarded as the weakness of<br />
democracy, have seen the path to their<br />
own concept of freedom through a<br />
dictatorship. But to u. s a dictatorship is<br />
the antithesis of freedomi. The Russians<br />
have sought what they believe to be economic<br />
freedom for the masses through<br />
the power of the State; whilst we have<br />
visualized the only true power of the<br />
State as resting upon the political freedom<br />
of the individual. Each of us thinks<br />
that he is right. And each of us may be,<br />
in his own country. Provided we each<br />
respect the other's ideas, there is room for </p>
<p>both of us in a world of men. But the<br />
condition of adjustment is that there<br />
should be no aggression by either, and<br />
that other nations should be left really<br />
free to make their own choice.<br />
It is, therefore, a condition of true<br />
Anglo-American-Soviet friendship and<br />
tolerance that we should not think in<br />
terms of conflicting ideologies, a practice<br />
which breeds hatreds and may therefore<br />
breed war, but in terms of mutual recognition.<br />
That is to say, if Russia desires<br />
non-interference in Russia's affairs by us,<br />
it is entitled to say so. -If we desire<br />
non-interference in our affairs by Russia,<br />
we are entitled to say so. If smaller<br />
Powers desire non-interference by either<br />
of us, they are entitled to say so. In<br />
brief, there can be no real peace in the<br />
world unless every nation has respect for<br />
the territorial rights of the others.<br />
Certain questions thereupon naturally<br />
arise. Since the war have we-and I use<br />
the word we as describing the British<br />
people all over the world, because for<br />
the whole purpose of this discussion we<br />
are to be regarded as one people-intervened<br />
in the affairs of other countries<br />
against their will? In the case of the two<br />
countries in respect of which British<br />
action has been challenged, namely,<br />
Greece mnd the Netherlands East Indies,<br />
the answer must clearly be in the<br />
negative. The Greek Government itself<br />
made it clear at the Security Council<br />
that Greece desired British troops to<br />
remain, whilst in the case of the Netherlands<br />
East Indies, the work of clearing<br />
out the Japanese and releasing internees<br />
was work which British troops were properly<br />
called upon to do in conjunction<br />
with the Icng-established Netherlands<br />
Easct Indies Government itself.<br />
Now I turn to the other side of the<br />
picture: Has the Soviet Union intervened<br />
in the affairs of other countries<br />
against their will? One has only to take<br />
the map and to realize that already,<br />
with the war in-Europe less than a<br />
year finished, the Soviet Union has<br />
annexed Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania,<br />
East Prussia, East Poland, Carpatho-<br />
Ukraine, Bukovina, Moldavia, and Bessarabia,<br />
to have the clearest answer! And<br />
on top of this, direct Soviet influence<br />
has been established in Eastern Germany, in Hungary, in Roumania, in Yugoslavia,<br />
with demands upon Turkey for<br />
Russian fortifications in the Straits, and<br />
the most recent incident of all, in Persia.<br />
Russia's explanation of all this falls<br />
into two parts: the annexations<br />
are of territories possessing some historic<br />
or racial association with Russia<br />
and are in any event directed,<br />
to adopt words of the Minister<br />
for External Affairs, " towards selfprotection<br />
and security against future<br />
attack"; and the establishing of<br />
spheres of influence outside the annexed<br />
areas is justified-and here I quotr<br />
Stalin's recent statement-by the fac,<br />
that the Germans invaded the Soviet<br />
Union through Finland, Poland, Rouuiania,<br />
Bulgaria and Hungary." This<br />
leads Stalin to the remarkable question,<br />
and again I quote-<br />
Is it to be wondered that the Soviet Union<br />
in its desire to safeguard itself for the future<br />
should make snnie effort to secure itn these<br />
countries gpovernmillt. loyal to the Soviet<br />
nion? On the mere recital of these facts it<br />
is quite clear that the Soviet Union has<br />
abandoned the terms of the Atlantic<br />
Charter, has swept aside the independence<br />
of other nations where it has<br />
thought desirable, and has in fact, as a<br />
result of victory in the war, enormously<br />
extended its boundaries, and its Europea'<br />
authority, while enhancing renarkabl<br />
its military and strategic position in the<br />
world. For the most part, therefore, the<br />
territorial adjustments made during and<br />
since the war have been by unilateral<br />
action on the part of the Soviet Unior<br />
They all have served to strengthen the<br />
position of the Union, and thereforeand<br />
it is a fact at which we must not<br />
blink-to weaken the position of the<br />
Western democracies. The Minister<br />
accepts the Russian view that while all<br />
this is no doubt in sad conflict with the<br />
whole principle of the United Nations<br />
organization, it has been done quite<br />
reasonably for Russia's security. But<br />
security against whom? Does Russia<br />
fear attack by its smaller neighbours? Is<br />
the Soviet Union anticipating and<br />
guarding against an attack ' by a revived<br />
Germany? After all, that question will<br />
not arise unless Germany does once more </p>
<p>become a great military power, and it is<br />
not likely to become that unless the Soviet<br />
Union quarrels with the Western democracies,<br />
and in the quarrel Germany gets<br />
to its feet.<br />
[ Extension of time granted.]<br />
Or, to take the third possibility, is the<br />
anticipated attack from Great Britain<br />
and the United States of America?<br />
Reading Stalin's statement one would<br />
almost think so. These questions well<br />
deserve to be stated. There is no reason<br />
why we should go round corners in this<br />
b1<br />
) usiness. With the best will in the world,<br />
mnd we have the best will in the world<br />
towards the Russian people, we must<br />
bring these questions out and look at<br />
them fairly and squarely. These questions<br />
are im. mensely important because in<br />
dill cases-in each of the three I have<br />
mentioned-the extent of the defence<br />
must be related to the scale of the anticipated<br />
attack. If the Soviet Union is<br />
really setting out to make itself secure<br />
against attack by the other great powers,<br />
what reason is there to suppose that its<br />
annexations will stop where they are<br />
now? After all, to put the matter in the<br />
plainest terms, if the Soviet Union desires<br />
to be secure against attack by the other<br />
two of the Big Three it can do so only<br />
by having more strength in defence on its<br />
1wn account than they have in combina-<br />
. ion for purposes of attack. In other<br />
words, this doctrine by which a nation,<br />
powerfully placed as a result of a victory<br />
in a war, is thought to be entitled by<br />
annexations of territory and political pressure to put itself beyond the reach of<br />
successful attacks by others, and above all<br />
by others who offer no attack, is a doctrine<br />
which gives recognition to world<br />
domination as the prize of victory. All<br />
that can be said is that if the British<br />
Empire and the United States of America<br />
are prepared to sit back and accept the<br />
comfortable theory put forward by the<br />
Minister for External Affairs about the<br />
present Soviet progress, the day will<br />
inevitably come when the world's power<br />
will be out of balance and wheh, through<br />
the strength of an impregnable position,<br />
the Soviet Union will be able to dictate<br />
its own terms to the world.<br />
All these considerations, profoundly<br />
disturbing as they are, lead to one conclusion.<br />
Our natural interest in accelerating<br />
the growth of the United Nations<br />
from something which is an international<br />
conference to something which is a real<br />
international instrument of peace should<br />
not blind us to the fact that the most<br />
urgent of all British problems is the<br />
restoration of British economic and<br />
general power. This is needed so that<br />
the British Empire, in close association<br />
with the United States of America, may<br />
combine in tolerance and goodwill towards<br />
all other men, with an earnest<br />
desire to restore prosperity to all nations,<br />
with the resolute intention of respecting<br />
the political views and aspirations of<br />
other nations, but with, all the time, the<br />
assured knowledge that between them they<br />
have enough strength to defend the<br />
liberties of simple men and women<br />
against attack by tyrannies from whatever<br />
source the attack may come.<br />
