EMBARGO: 7 .00 p . m.<br />
FOR PRESS 29 OCTOBER 1978.<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
This Government's record of tax reform a tax reform that is<br />
soundly based is second-to-none. It stands any structiny.<br />
It passes any test.<br />
For many years Australian taxpayers have been hit to leg because<br />
inflation pushed them into higher tax brackets. This cut their<br />
earnings and boosted the tax flow to Canberra.<br />
That situation was not acceptable to the Coalition Government.<br />
Within months of gaining office, we acted decisively to end<br />
Labour's tax rip-off. We acted to stop the unlegislated tax<br />
grab by Canberra.<br />
We introduced tax indexation. This is a device that automatically<br />
protects incomes against tax increases caused by inflation.<br />
Last year we went further. We introduced what has been described<br />
as the most significant tax reform in Australia's history.<br />
We cut the tax rates and introduced a new and simplified<br />
three-tier tax scale. Now, for the first time in 10 years, the<br />
personal income tax collected by thne Government will fall in real<br />
terms.<br />
The Government's tax reforms have made sure that taxpayers today<br />
pay less than they would be paying if Labor had remained in office.<br />
Even allowing for the impact of the 1.5 percent surcharge that<br />
will come into effect this week, until June 30 next year<br />
taxpayers are still paying less tax than they would be if the<br />
so-called Hayden tax scales still applied. But on top of that,<br />
taxpayers also benefit from the simplified health arrangements<br />
that also start from this week. These have resulted in lower<br />
health insurance contributions.<br />
The facts are clear. Let's look at a taxpayer with a spouse and<br />
dependent child on average weekly earnings of $ 220.38.<br />
Under Labor's 1975 Budget tax scales, in January next year, that<br />
taxpayer would be paying tax of $ 49.85 per week. Under this<br />
Government., he will be paying only $ 40.85 a week and this<br />
includes the 1.5 percent temprorary tax surcharge.<br />
Accordingly, despite the surcharge, the taxpayer on average weekly<br />
earnings is $ 9 a week better off because of this Government's tax<br />
reforms. This figure takes no account of the family allowance<br />
scheme which provides mothers with significantly higher benefits<br />
than the old child endowment. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
The Government's tax reforms even with the surcharge benefit<br />
taxpayers on all levels of income. A non-levy taxpayer with<br />
depandent spouse earning $ 100 a week was paying $ 7.85 a week<br />
in January 1976 when Labor's tax scales were still operating.<br />
Now, the taxpayer on $ 100 a week pays no tax. The same taxpayer<br />
earning $ 150 a week in January 1976, was paying $ 25.60 a week in<br />
tax. Now,, he pays $ 16.30 a week. That's a difference of<br />
$ 483.60 a year. The same taxpayer earning $ 200 in January 1976<br />
was paying $ 44.50. Now he pays only $ 33.85. That's a difference<br />
of $ 553.80 a year. That taxpayer earning $ 300 in January 1976<br />
was paying $ 91.70 in tax. Now he pays only $ 68.95. That's a<br />
difference of $ 1,183 a year.<br />
The significance of this Government's tax policies and economic<br />
strategy is highlighted by comparisons with the tax grab made<br />
during the high inflation period of the last Federal Labor<br />
Government. In 1972-73, the Labor Government collected<br />
$ 4,089 million in income tax from all Australians.<br />
The following financial year this rose to $ 5,490 million a massive<br />
20.1 percent increase in real terms. In 1974-75 still under Labor<br />
the tax grab rose to $ 7,714 million a further 19.9 percent increase<br />
in real terms.<br />
What a stark picture. It represents an 89 percent increase in tax<br />
collected by Labor in two years or 44 percent in real terms.<br />
This year, the Government has reversed that disastrous trend and<br />
is actually reducing our takings by 0.3 percent in real terms<br />
this is equivalent to $ 36 million.<br />
Next Wednesday, when the temporary tax surcharge comes into effect,<br />
Australians also will be covered under a new health care arrangement.<br />
There's no doubt that our decision to simplify health care<br />
arrangements will provide real benefit throughout the-commnunity.<br />
It is a fundamental aim of the Government to provide a high standard<br />
of health care, for all Australians and at reasonable cost.<br />
It's worth recalling how the original Medibank scheme<br />
Medibank Mark I worked. In essence the original Labor scheme<br />
worked on the principle of providing health services to everyone,<br />
without charge. In practice, it is not that simple.<br />
By providing all services without charge or at a nominal charge<br />
Government expenditures increase dramatically. To finance these<br />
services in a non-inflationary manner, it is necessary to either<br />
increase taxes or restrict spending in other areas. The point is<br />
worth dwelling on. The major beneficiaries of Medibank Mark I<br />
were not the poor. Pensioners and their dependents were already<br />
eligible for free health care. Poorer families had their health<br />
insurance premiums subsidised. The beneficiaries were the better<br />
off members of the community Cho no longer needed to pay insurance<br />
premiums. When we came to Government, late in 1975, the increasing cost of<br />
Medibank was clear. If something had not been done we would have had<br />
to either increase taxation or cut back in other health and<br />
welfare programmes. 3 </p>
<p>In other words, the gains of Medibank Mark I to the better off<br />
would have been financed at the expense of the poorest sections<br />
of the community. We were not prepared to see that happen.<br />
We modified Medibank, slowed the escalation in overall health<br />
care costs and protected that section of the community not<br />
as well off. The latest changes built on this achievement.<br />
They continue to protect the disadvantaged. They protect all<br />
Australians against the costs of serious illness, and they<br />
simplify present arrangements. At the same time, they require<br />
those better off in the community to take a greater degree of<br />
personal responsibility for the costs of their health services.<br />
Through our taxation reforms and we have proved we are a tax<br />
reform Government and our health care programme, this<br />
Government continues to demonstrate its concern for the welfare<br />
of all Australians. </p>
