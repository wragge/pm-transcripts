    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>  Today I am announcing changes to the  Ministry that I will be recommending to His Excellency the Governor-General. </p>
<p>
  I am pleased to announce that Greg  Hunt will become the Minister for Health and the Minister for Sport.</p>
<p>
  Greg has previously served as  Minister for the Environment, and Minister for Industry, Innovation and  Science. </p>
<p>
  He has strong policy, analytical and  communication skills developed over a very long front bench career. </p>
<p>
  During his time as the Environment  Minister, he demonstrated an ability to grapple with extremely complex policy  issues and engage a very diverse range of stakeholders and interest groups,  including State and Territory Governments. </p>
<p>
  He is ideally suited to take on the  very important, critically important front line portfolio of health and sport. </p>
<p>
  Senator Arthur Sinodinos will take  over as Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science. </p>
<p>
  This portfolio is critical to  generating the jobs of the future and Senator Sinodinos' extensive public  policy experience over many, many years gives him a strong understanding of the  key drivers of new sources of economic growth and how government can ensure  that its policies deliver the innovation, the investment, the technology that  will secure the future for our children and grandchildren. </p>
<p>
  As Cabinet Secretary, Arthur  restored traditional cabinet processes. That being done, he can now turn his  talents to a front line portfolio. And the Cabinet Secretary function can  return to the Prime Minister's Office as has been the practice of Coalition  Governments in the past. </p>
<p>
  This will reduce the size of the  Cabinet by one. </p>
<p>
  The Special Minister of State,  Senator Scott Ryan, will continue to support the work of the Cabinet as Minister  Assisting the Prime Minister for Cabinet. </p>
<p>
  There will be other changes to the  outer ministry. </p>
<p>
  Ken Wyatt, who has been the  Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care will become the Minister for Aged  Care and the Minister for Indigenous Health. </p>
<p>
  Just as Ken was the first Indigenous  person to be elected to the House of Representatives and the first to be  appointed to the Executive of the Commonwealth Government, he is now the first  Indigenous person appointed to the Commonwealth Ministry. </p>
<p>
  His extensive knowledge and  experience as a senior public servant in Indigenous health, coupled with his  work as an Assistant Minister in this portfolio, makes him an ideal Minister  for this area. </p>
<p>
  As senior minister in the health  portfolio, Mr Hunt will represent the aged care sector in the Cabinet.</p>
<p>
  Dr David Gillespie will continue to  serve in the portfolio as Assistant Minister for Health. </p>
<p>
  Michael Sukkar will be appointed as  Assistant Minister to the Treasurer. </p>
<p>
  These changes will further  strengthen my Ministry by combining experience and new talent. It is a team  that is focused on delivering for all Australians. </p>
<p>
  The new Ministers will be sworn in  by the Governor-General in Canberra on Tuesday.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Will this Ministry last the year?</p>
<p>
  <strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>  This is a very strong ministry. The  Cabinet, as you know, and the Ministry was sworn in about six months ago. These  changes are the consequence of the resignation of Sussan Ley, but this is not a  large reshuffle, as you can see. </p>
<p>
  We have a very strong team and it is  one that is performing outstandingly for the Australian people. I am always  delighted to take the opportunity, however, to advance new talent and that is  what I have done today. I do have to say that I have an extraordinary range of  talent on the backbench in my party room. I have a lot of talent. </p>
<p>
  I have more ministerial talent in  party room than I have places in the Ministry. That presents some challenges  but, from a Prime Minister's point of view, it is a good problem to have. </p>
<p>
  We have got a lot of talent and, of  course, our team are developing that talent, working with it, honing it in a  whole range of capacities as local Members, as Senators, as members and  chairmen of committees and as Ministers and Assistant Ministers.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  How could you justify reducing the  proportion of women in your Ministry?</p>
<p>
  <strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>  As you know, Sussan Ley resigned  from the Ministry and there has been, we have made one new appointment to the  Executive overall at the level of Assistant Minister or Parliamentary Secretary  but I do have a historically large number of women in my Cabinet. I, obviously,  I have done that. I have appointed more women to my Cabinet than any previous  Coalition leader. I am very committed to having strong representation of women  in the Ministry. I have demonstrated that by my actions.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Would you consider a broader  reshuffle?</p>
<p>
  <strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>  The answer to that, very simply, is  that as I said earlier, the Cabinet was sworn in six months ago. It is  performing well. Ministers are all doing their jobs very well. </p>
<p>
  Regrettably, we have had a  resignation that has required me to make some changes. It has given me the  opportunity to make the changes to the Cabinet Secretary function, which are  appropriate but this is not a major reshuffle. It is driven by the consequence  of one resignation. </p>
<p>
  We have got a very good team. They  are working very, very well and it has been - the Cabinet and Ministry were  sworn in only six months ago.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Do you see this as an opportunity  maybe to move on some of the Ministers who may be considered to be  underperforming? This would be a good opportunity to do that?</p>
<p>
  <strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>  I have just announced the changes I  am making.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Labor has begun its attack on  Senator Arthur Sinodinos, calling him ‘dodgy’. Is it problematic appointing  somebody who comes with the baggage that Senator Arthur Sinodinos has?</p>
<p>
  <strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>  The Labor Party should look to their  own performance. I make this observation about Mr Shorten. He hand-picked for  the Senate, Kimberley Kitching. It was his decision. He put her in the Senate.  She is one of his factional supporters in Victoria. </p>
<p>
  The Heydon Royal Commission  recommended that the Director of Public Prosecutions consider laying charges  against her. </p>
<p>
  Mr Shorten has never, ever said what  steps he has taken to satisfy himself that the concerns and the recommendation  of the Royal Commission were without foundation. Unless he can say that, how  can he justify appointing her? Him, his decision, appointing her to the Senate?  That is the question Mr Shorten should be answering.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Will the new Health Minister be  allowed to base himself in Noosa and Hayman Island at taxpayers' expense as he  has done in the past over many a year?</p>
<p>
  <strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>  Can I just say to you, in terms of  this issue of MPs' expenses and travel and accommodation, we have to spend  every dollar of taxpayers’ money with even more care than we spend our own. We  are trustees. We are fiduciaries for the taxpayers' money. That is why I have  set out the most extensive reforms to the management and the supervision of  MPs' parliamentary expenses in a generation.</p>
<p>
  We are going to implement the  recommendations of the review conducted by John Conde and David Tune and we are  going to establish, for the first time, an independent authority to oversee  parliamentary expenses. </p>
<p>
  I came into Parliament at the ripe  old age of 50 after being in business all my life. Much of that time working in  businesses that belonged to me and Lucy. I didn't come into Parliament from a  long political background as a union official or a political staffer or  whatever. I regard these expenses as normal business expenses and they have to  be justified just in the same way as you would justify the expenses to your  boss, to your employer. It is exactly the same principle. </p>
<p>
  We need to have greater  transparency, greater accountability, monthly reporting is going to be very  important. I am going to shake this up, I can tell you. There is a big cultural  change on the way. It is underway already.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Can we take that as a no then, as Mr  Hunt working from Noosa and Hayman Island as he has done in the past?</p>
<p>
  <strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>  Can I just say to you that ministers  travel and politicians travel - it is a big country. I have been in, just this  week, I have been in Toowoomba, I have been in Redcliffe and Brisbane and  travel all over the country. They attend conferences, as indeed business people  do. The important thing that politicians have got to bear in mind, firstly, is  that their use of taxpayers' money has to be manifestly demonstrated to be  necessary for doing their job, in the same way - exactly the same principles  apply as business expenses for someone working for a company or a business.  And, the second thing, they have got to do, because we are public officials, we  have got to demonstrate that it is seen to be so. That is very important. I can  assure you, I come from a background, a business background where people have  to justify the money they spend. That is what is going to happen.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  On one other issue, Rex Tillerson  has said China should be blocked from gaining access to islands in the South  China Sea. A transition official has said that this is, he didn’t mis-speak.  Does Australia agree with the idea of blocking access to the islands and would  we support any measures, further American measurers to push back against China  in the region?</p>
<p>
  <strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>  Our position on the South China Sea  issue is very consistent and very clear. We urge all parties to abide by  international law. We urge all parties to refrain from any actions that can  create or exacerbate tensions. We urge all parties to refrain from the  alteration of any features in the South China Sea and refrain from the  militarisation of any features, islands and so forth in the South China Sea. </p>
<p>
  It is critically important that  territorial disputes in that important part of our region are settled  consensually and in accordance with international law. That is the position we  have taken. It is the position ASEAN takes. It is the position that the United  States' Government has taken. It is the position that Shinzo Abe and I, the  Prime Minister of Japan, reiterated on Saturday.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Is it fair to target pensioners and  the disabled with these Centrelink robo-letters after all the furore that has  gone on over the past fortnight over these letters and the difference between  people having debt and not having debt and being unfairly given letters?</p>
<p>
  <strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>  You are making a series of  assertions there. </p>
<p>
  Let me say, Centrelink has always  sought to find explanations from recipients of Centrelink payments in  circumstances where there is a discrepancy between the income reported by the  recipient to Centrelink and the income reported by their employer. </p>
<p>
  What has been happening, has been  done in the past, of course, and it is quite appropriate. We have, the  Government has, an obligation to ensure that our very extensive and generous  social welfare system is means-tested. That is a very important and an  Australian feature. I might say, it is one of the reasons why income inequality  is less severe in our country than it is in other countries where welfare  payments are not as well targeted. </p>
<p>
  Andrew Leigh, the Labor front  bencher used to write quite a bit about this when he was an academic. </p>
<p>
  The point is Centrelink has a  responsibility where it identifies the discrepancy between what the recipient has  reported and what the employer has reported to seek an explanation and that is  what is being done. To seek an explanation. The letters that go out in the  first instance are simply saying there is a discrepancy. Your employer says you  earn this and you say you earned that. Can you explain what that discrepancy  is? That is entirely responsible and appropriate. Obviously it is important to  make sure that the recipient gets the letter and you have seen the measures  that the Minister, Alan Tudge has announced.</p>
<p>
  <strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>  Just on MH370, Prime Minister, Tony  Abbott has said that he is disappointed that the search has been suspended.  What would you say to him and to the victims' families?</p>
<p>
  <strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>  We grieve with the families of the  victims and we share their deep disappointment that the plane has not been  found. </p>
<p>
  As you know, there has been a  massive search. It has been - it is an unprecedented search. It has been  conducted with the best advice over the areas that were identified as the most  likely to find the location of the aeroplane. </p>
<p>
  It is a shocking tragedy and we  grieve and we deeply regret the loss and we deeply regret that the plane has  not been found. </p>
<p>
  But, as you know, there has been an  agreement between the three countries involved, that at the conclusion of this  program, the search will be suspended. But, as the Minister said this morning,  if new evidence emerged that pointed to another location, then of course the  three nations can consider searching there. But there has never been a search  as extensive as this. It adds to the tragedy that the plane has not been found  but it has been an extraordinary search over a very long period of time. We  grieve with the families and the loved ones of those who were lost. </p>
<p>
  Thank you all very much.</p>
