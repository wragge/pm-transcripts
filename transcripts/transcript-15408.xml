    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that today Prime Minister Abe and I have endorsed an Action Plan to implement the Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation, signed in Tokyo on 13 March 2007.  </p>
<p>The Action Plan identifies a range of cooperative activities to deepen the strategic partnership between Australia and Japan, which is based on shared values and interests and a commitment to regional security.  We have agreed to enhance policy coordination on security issues in the Asia-Pacific and beyond and expand practical cooperation in areas including defence, law enforcement, counter-terrorism, counter proliferation, peace operations and the exchange of strategic assessments and related information.</p>
<p>The Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation ushered in a new era in our relationship with Japan.  Building on the historic collaboration of our defence forces in Iraq and our growing cooperation to address security challenges in our region and beyond, the Joint Declaration provides a valuable framework for expanding our strategic cooperation, including through the establishment of joint foreign and defence ministerial consultations, first held in Tokyo on 6 June 2007.   </p>
<p>The Joint Declaration and Action Plan underline the increasing depth of our strategic partnership with Japan and complement the robust economic and people-to-people links between our countries.  </p>
<p>The Joint Declaration and Action Plan also complement the Trilateral Strategic Dialogue which brings together Japan, the United States and Australia.  I was pleased to take the opportunity of their presence in Sydney for APEC to meet President Bush and Prime Minister Abe together to discuss our security cooperation and other issues of common interest to three of the great democracies of the region.  </p>
