TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
DOORSTOP, TRADES HALL, ADELAIDE, 9 AUGUST 1992<br />
9 On PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, can we ask you about the opposition<br />
by the Left to the sale of gantas, are you expecting<br />
problems getting It through?<br />
PM: Well the Federal Secretary of the Labor Party has<br />
got that matter in hand, it's a process there and I<br />
expect we'll get a reasonable result from it. It's<br />
not eay making changes in Australia, it's the point<br />
I keep laking to Dr Hewaon. The reason we've had<br />
this closed domestic two airline policy which the<br />
Liberals gave us and Oantas flying outside of<br />
Australia and not being able to make it into one<br />
company and then sell it is basically becauae of the<br />
fact that nobody's ever taken these issues on In the<br />
political parties and we are and it's the right<br />
thing to do and I expect that the Labor Party will<br />
respond accordingly.<br />
J; Are you prepared to over-ride the wishes of that<br />
segmet of the Party?<br />
PM: We've got proper processes, we' 12 see where they go.<br />
J: Prime Minister given the disastrous standing of the<br />
Bannon Government in the polls, are you concerned<br />
about how that uvud impact on a Federal election<br />
result?<br />
PM: Political fortunes come and go. people have written<br />
John Bannon of f in the past and he's got up and won<br />
again and I think he will next time. These are not<br />
easy times, the 1980s were a period of growth right<br />
around the world, the 1990s haven't to this stage<br />
been and It's not easy living in an international<br />
environment with low growth and that's a problem for<br />
everybody. But again as I said in the Convention<br />
today that this Government is still making changes,<br />
we've just made revolutionary changes to vocational<br />
education, to airline%, to transport, to television<br />
all within the last couple of months. So we're<br />
pressing on and I think that initiative brings Its<br />
own reward and the Bnnon Government is doing the<br />
same. </p>

J: On the -' Sunday' program this morning Mr Blewatt said<br />
that reiterated that there wouldn't be an Increase<br />
in Medicare levy this term of your Government,<br />
however he didn't rule out that one could be<br />
announced before the next term should you win reelection.<br />
Is that the story at this stage?<br />
PM: It's very close to Budget now and I'm not here to be<br />
basically running through things which people<br />
comprehend to be Budget m'atters.<br />
3: The $ 12 million for-the Indian Pacific, that<br />
guarantees the future of an important passenger<br />
service?<br />
FM: Well It means we are going to rofurbish that<br />
service, it will guarantee Its future. That<br />
refurbishment is going to take place in South<br />
Australia. we're putting another $ 4 million Into<br />
Ilnton on top of the $ 3 million which was<br />
announcein~ the ' One Nation' statement which will<br />
mean that those workshops can undertake and fulfil<br />
that work and so It will be good for South<br />
Australia, but as wall as that provide a first class<br />
passenger seice and therefore hopefully growth<br />
between Western Australia and the East coast. But<br />
of course, AN successfully ran it to date and AN Is<br />
based In South Australia, It will be a good thing<br />
for South Australia.<br />
3; Two key Initiatives that you've flagged, you've<br />
spoken a lot about today the youth summit and olso<br />
the Infrastructure spending, -the two-areas which the<br />
Bannon Government highllghted long ago and which the<br />
Federal Government seems Blow to take up. How much<br />
ground have you lost by wasting that time?<br />
PM: It's not a matter of westing time, it's only<br />
recently that we proposed that there should be a<br />
national training authority and by getting all the<br />
states by c-operation and not by confrontation as<br />
Dr Kewson would do It, we've got the States into a<br />
landmark change. We will now build a vocational<br />
eduatonsystem with TAPE, with technical and<br />
further education, whic h 1 hope will be as good as<br />
any In the world and we'll be able to sit beside our<br />
universities as a alternative system of education<br />
for many kids that just can't get access to<br />
university and it's a good Labor thing to have done.<br />
And we've done it as well with non-Labor States<br />
which is more to their credit. In terms of<br />
Infiastructure, it's always been a cry In South<br />
Australia to provide a standard gauge railway to<br />
Melbourne. I'm happy to say that this Government<br />
Will be the one to have done it, that I wan able to<br />
push that propiusdl through at the right time and as<br />
a result will not only build a new track from </p>

Adelal4e to Melbourne but refurbish the line from<br />
Melbourne and Sydney and from Sydney to Brisbane so<br />
that from Brisbane to Perth via Melbourne and<br />
Adelaide we'll have for the first time in 100 years,<br />
the first time in a century a standard gauge<br />
railway. Thank you.<br />
ENDS </p>
