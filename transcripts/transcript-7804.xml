PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, VICTORY PARK, CASTLEMAINE,<br />
NOVEMBER 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, a long way to come for a<br />
sausage? PM: Well, if that's all I'd travelled for, yes. I guess<br />
it would be but it was a beautiful sausage and lovely<br />
bread and beautiful people.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you shoring up your rural votes?<br />
PM: Well, I'm you see this business about shoring up<br />
up rural votes, it means that I can't go around Australia<br />
until, according to that theory, until say five or six<br />
months before an election. I'm always travelling around<br />
Australia, always and I just am very pleased to be here<br />
again after two years to support my good friend Peter<br />
Cleeland. Great Member.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, have you thought any more abou4-<br />
an election date?<br />
PM: No going around this beautiful country, seeing<br />
all these beautiful people, I mean, fancy having elections<br />
on your mind.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the foreshadowed country<br />
statement that you're going to make. What is it-<br />
PM: The foreshadowed?<br />
JOURNALIST: Country statement that you are going to make<br />
PM: Yes, well the details of that are still being worked<br />
out between some of the Ministers and Departments and<br />
we'll be making that statement within a month I think.<br />
JOURNALIST: And what areas will It cover?<br />
PM: Rural Australia. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
JOURNALIST: In reference to policies?<br />
PM: It will be policies and statements and reviews of<br />
what we have done and what's got to be happening in the<br />
future, yes, matters of a range of interest to all rural<br />
Australia. Issues that have been raised with us by my<br />
Prime Minister's Country Task Force that has been operating<br />
now for a period of time. They have been very useful,<br />
going around and listening to people right around Australia<br />
and they raise with them Issues of concern and where we<br />
think that we can do something to meet those concerns,<br />
we will.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what's your reaction to Dr<br />
Stephen Fitzgerald<br />
, PM: Just a minute. just a minute, the local one f irst,<br />
yes? JOURNALIST: Is it an indication that the Government had<br />
neglected rural Australia?<br />
PM: No, no, on the contrary, we've done very, very much<br />
more to meeting the range of needs of rural Australia<br />
than has been done by previous governments and this has<br />
been acknowledged by people in rural Australia. I mean.<br />
it's not Just the people who are on farms. I mean, the<br />
National Party in the past tended to talk about and not<br />
do a hell of a lot about it at any rate, but the policies<br />
for farmers. Rural Australia is, of course, importantly<br />
farmers, but it's not just farmers. There's all the people<br />
that live in the towns and our range of policies has been<br />
concerned with ensuring a more effective delivery of services<br />
in rural Australia. one of the problems in the past is,<br />
it's just been assumed that somehow or other people in<br />
rural Australia will get the services that are provided<br />
by the Department of Social Security and the Department<br />
of Employment and Training, but that assumption hasn't<br />
been well based. You've got to do special things to make<br />
sure these services are available and we've done that.<br />
Now, what was yours?<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what's your reaction to Dr<br />
Stephen Fitzgerald's comments that Australia's relationship<br />
with China is exaggerated and dangerous?<br />
PM: Well, I'm surprised by Stephen's statement. First<br />
of all, look at the facts. I mean, there's some suggestion<br />
that it's been at the expense of other countries in the<br />
region, and of course, that simply isn't true. I mean<br />
I have Just been, earlier this year, to the region and<br />
our relations are superb. I mean, it's reflected in the<br />
fact that we have been able Just this week in Canberra<br />
to have the Asian Pacific Economic Co-operation Conference. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
They have applauded the initiative of this Government.<br />
Not just in regard to the conference, but in our relations<br />
with the region. The fact that we can have such a conference,<br />
never been done before, done at Australia's initiative,<br />
that of itself, I suggest, explodes the proposition that<br />
our relations with China have been at the expense of countries<br />
in the region. You can't have those two propositions<br />
sitting together that we have somehow prejudiced our relations<br />
with the other countries of the region and have this historic<br />
conference. The two propositions simply do not sit together.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, what have we got in return from China<br />
for our strengthening our relations?<br />
PM: Let me say this, you don't Just in having relations<br />
with a country say ' what am I going to get in return?'<br />
And presumably when Dr Fitzgerald in his, both his professional<br />
diplomatic career and in his business career has been<br />
himself giving the overwhelming proportion of his time<br />
to China, when he was doing that he saw some point in<br />
it. I don't believe he wanted to be the Ambassador to<br />
China, I don't believe he's had a business with China<br />
because he saw it as unimportant. And the importance<br />
of relations with China are not simply in terms of what<br />
you'll get in return, although I suppose in Dr Fitzgerald's<br />
case, in his business capacity he's been seeking, you<br />
know, a return from what he does. But as far as Australia's<br />
concerned we certainly hope that having good relations<br />
will make it easier for developing business, economic,<br />
cultural, commercial relations with China, we hope that<br />
will occur. But the other part of developing friendly<br />
relations with China is the sensible global consideration<br />
that here is a country which constitutes a quarter of<br />
the world's population, which has a vast significance<br />
in the region and potentially for the whole world and<br />
it makes sense for countries like Australia, that China<br />
can trust, we obviously have no designs on China, it's<br />
very sensible for countries like Australia to develop<br />
friendly relations with them, to give them a sense of<br />
welcome in the region and in the world commnunity. And<br />
that's part of what we've been about.<br />
JOURNALIST: Dr Fitzgerald was hopeful that after the<br />
Tiananmen Square massacre that relations could change.<br />
Have they changed?<br />
PM: They're not the same as they were before, of course.<br />
We have in common with a number of other countries, have<br />
not had the same measure of relationship as that we had<br />
before. But we do keep, we obviously do keep relations<br />
and one would be watching, as many countries are, what<br />
the developments are in China. it would be silly for<br />
Australia or for the rest of the world to cut off relations<br />
with China because there are great forces within China<br />
that want to see reform continue there, economic and political<br />
reform. They want to see China continue to open up to<br />
the rest of the world and we must conduct our relations<br />
in a way which both indicate that we can't condone what<br />
I </p>
<p>-4-<br />
happened in June and at the same time indicate that we<br />
want to keep our avenues of communication open. I think,<br />
sensibly, we are doing that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke,....... changed your attitude towards<br />
China, changed the Dr Fitzgerald said?<br />
PM: No, Dr Fitzgerald's comments will have no impact<br />
upon our position at all.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, will the Federal Government continue<br />
to negotiate with the chemists?<br />
PM: Well, if I can use the sporting Jargon, the ball<br />
Is really in their court and it has been accepted by South<br />
Australia and the ACT and it's being further considered<br />
by the other parts of the Guild. I hope they will accept<br />
it because it represents, as I say, a $ 60 million addition<br />
to the outcome from the Pharmacy Remuneration Tribunal<br />
and it provides not Just $ 60 million additional, but it<br />
goes to things that have been important to the chemists.<br />
For instance, they have urged, in my opinion rightly,<br />
urged for a recognition of their professional skills and<br />
importance and it's not just a question of handing over<br />
packages of films and dispensing things. I mean, they<br />
have a professional role in the community, they've rightly<br />
urged and that's been recognised in our package to them.<br />
There are also provisions there for remote allowances<br />
and there are also provisions for restructuring. These<br />
are things that they regard as important. Now, I think<br />
they should pick it up and then come down and sit down<br />
and talk with us. They'll be able then to be in the Trust<br />
that we're establishing to administer that $ 60 million,<br />
we're also promising them that in that context we'll appoint<br />
a representative from their experience on to the Tribunal.<br />
So I hope they come back and if there are some things<br />
edoaro utnhda t. the edges that need some further talking, we can<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you concerned that both the pharmacists<br />
and the Pilots Federation are targetting the marginal<br />
seats? PM: No, I'm not-. because if there's one thing that's qui-te<br />
clear by now after six and a half years in Government<br />
is that we will not be threatened. But when we were in<br />
our first term we were threatened by all sorts of groups<br />
on the basis of the Assets Test. They were going to kill<br />
us in marginal seats. Now the Assets Test was very simple.<br />
We weren't going to allow the interests of a small group<br />
who were already reasonably well protected by the community<br />
to be further advanced at the expense of others. Now<br />
we refused to be intimidated by a massive campaign on<br />
the Assets Test. </p>
<p>Now if the pilots think they're going to conduct a campaign<br />
which intimidates us, well, that's good, it's a democracy<br />
and they can think about that if they want to. I think<br />
it would be much more sensible on the pilots' part if<br />
they asked themselves the question, shouldn't they act<br />
in the same way as all other organisations and workers.<br />
Accept the same principles and that's what the Industrial<br />
Relations Commnission has asked them to do. They said<br />
if you want to be part of the act, well accept what we,<br />
as a Commission, have laid down which is the same for<br />
everyone. Now I think that's what they ought to be thinking<br />
about. I hope they will.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Now, Just a minute. I'll come back to you.<br />
You've got to give someone else a go you know.<br />
O JOURNALIST: Can I ask about bank profits? National Australia<br />
Bank-<br />
PM: Bank profits.<br />
JOURNALIST: That's right. Don't you think it's<br />
considering the high interest rates that National Australia<br />
Bank's recorded highest profits yet?<br />
PM: Well, as has been recognised, one of the reasons<br />
for the considerable increase in bank profits has been<br />
a) the growth in the level of business and the actual<br />
increased productivity which has taken place within the<br />
system. It's not Just a function of high interest rates<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you support the banks<br />
PM: Well, if you want to put words into my mouth you<br />
S do so, I'm not doing that. I'm simply saying that the<br />
profits that have emerged have emerged from a competitive<br />
situation, certainly including high interest rates. In<br />
regard to the mortgage situation, the home mortgage situation,<br />
they've had to pay fairly high rates for the money which<br />
they borrow and which they lend out. Now I'm not here<br />
as an apologist for those level of profits. I think that<br />
the banks ought to look at whether in areas of services<br />
they can provide some of those services at somewhat better<br />
rates. That's their decision, but it's a competitive<br />
environment in which the National Bank has to be up against<br />
others JOURNALIST: Nonetheless. Nobby Clark has described your<br />
monetary policy as a slow lingering death of the thousand<br />
cuts PM: Nobby Clark it can be argued, knows something about<br />
banking. I don't think anyone really puts him high on<br />
the list of economic analysts. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, finally<br />
PM: Finally as far as you're concerned.<br />
JOURNALIST: That's right. No, but I won't bother you<br />
any more.<br />
PM: OK. You haven't bothered me at all. What's your<br />
next question?<br />
JOURNALIST: Thank you.<br />
PM Good.<br />
JOURNALIST: Andrew Peacock's labelling you as yesterday's<br />
man? PM: Yes, well, I suppose one has to take a little bit<br />
of notice of Andrew because he is, you know, one of Australia's<br />
authorities on yesterday's men because he's been one of<br />
them. I mean, he's the recycled leader. I mean, this'<br />
month it's Andrew's turn to lead the Liberal Party, alright,<br />
next month or at the beginning of next year it'll be John's<br />
turn. I mean, they've got a depth of talent haven't they?<br />
Andrew, John, Andrew, John. I mean, he knows about yesterday's<br />
man, he's been there. But let me say this. I've never<br />
felt fitter, more capable and I've never been more excited<br />
about an upcoming election as I am about this and Andrew<br />
will need to ask at the end of the campaign was he up<br />
against a tired man. I'll tell him now he'll be up against<br />
a very, very vigorous man. But Andrew's problems really<br />
not with me. I mean he really ought to be looking<br />
at those people who are saying can we win with Andrew.<br />
And a lot of them are saying no. Well, they are right.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what's your reaction to the events<br />
in West Germany today?<br />
PM: I welcome them and I welcome them very much. I've<br />
had the opportunity, of course, in the recent past of<br />
having long discussions in the Soviet Union. That was<br />
at the end of ' 87 of course, hot just in recent months.<br />
But there was Mr Gorbachev. I understand the nature of<br />
changes that he has in mind and Just a few months ago<br />
I was in Hungary, had discussions with all the leading<br />
figures there, so I do have the, you know, the advantage<br />
of actually knowing the depth of determination that people<br />
have for change. It was inevitable and I've said so before,<br />
it was inevitable that these changes would not just be<br />
confined to the Soviet Union and Poland and Hungary but<br />
they must extend. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
I am pleased at the speed with which they are extending<br />
in East Germany because, after all, there are two things<br />
that are quite clear. Firstly, and they have been for<br />
a long time, that this outdated. irrelevant. counterproductive,<br />
Marxist Leninist economic simply holding<br />
back economic development around the world. Every state<br />
that's practiced it has realised that and that's the core<br />
of change in the Soviet Union and now in Eastern Europe.<br />
The second thing that's equally clear is that you can't<br />
have significant, impactful economic reform without political<br />
reform and the move towards democratic processes and that's<br />
what we are witnessing and we should all be very happy<br />
about it.<br />
JOURNALIST: What do you think you got out of Your discussion<br />
with John the resigned pilot?<br />
PM: Well, at least I was able to convey to John what<br />
the facts are and those facts are very simple. That the<br />
Industrial Relations Commission has said that there are<br />
three conditions that need to be satisfied. If the AFAP<br />
can be considered by the Commission as having any possible<br />
role. Those conditions are that they must lift the embargo<br />
on their members joining the airlines. Secondly, that<br />
they must accept the decisions of the Industrial Relations<br />
Commission and third, they must be bound by the National<br />
Wage Case guidelines. Now, that is the fact and I was<br />
able to convey that to John. I think there probably was<br />
some lack of understanding that those are the conditions.<br />
I mean, that's what I've been saying all along. That you've<br />
got to act in terms of the principles and in accordance<br />
with the requirements of the Commission. That's been<br />
my position all along. The Commission has said that and<br />
if they do that, then the Commission can see whether there's<br />
a place for them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well speaking to him after your discussion<br />
is hoping that perhaps you may be more willing to recognise<br />
S the Pilots' Federation. Are his hopes going to be realised?<br />
PM: You see, the Pilots' Federation exists. I don't<br />
have to recognise it. There is a thing called the Australian<br />
Federation of Air Pilots. It exists. It's existence<br />
doesn't depend upon me. The real question is whether<br />
that organisation can have any place in the rebuilding<br />
of the airline industry. I repeat that the Industrial<br />
Relations Commission has laid down the three conditions<br />
which we have said from the beginning of the in the<br />
Industrial Relations Commission have said. If those conditions<br />
are accepted they will consider whether there's a place<br />
and a role for them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you still say there's no dispute? </p>
<p>PM: Well, it doesn't matter that I say it. The Industrial<br />
Relations Commission says there is no industrial dispute.<br />
I mean, no-one's questioning that. I mean, it's not a<br />
semantic issue. There are still problems and real problems<br />
in the tourism industry and for travellers. There are<br />
still real problems. No-one's ever said it and I've said<br />
that's not the case. But it's not a semantic issue when<br />
you say that the industrial dispute is over. That finished<br />
when they resigned. they don't have employees, they don't<br />
have members employed in the indust ry. At the direction<br />
of and under the decision of the AFAP, their members resigned.<br />
They not only resigned, but they took all their long service<br />
leave. They got out, they disassociated themselves with*<br />
the industry. Now what's been happening is, as the industrial<br />
Commission said, individual pilots are Joining up, signing<br />
contracts. And that is happening and gradually and very<br />
significantly the airlines are being rebuilt. In the<br />
early part of next year they will be providing full normal<br />
service, both airlines. That's what the condition will<br />
be in Australia. Full normal airline services and that's<br />
what's being done now. The only question is will the<br />
AFA? have any part, and the Industrial Relations Commission<br />
said if you accept those conditions we can consider whether<br />
there'll be a role for you. So that's not complicated.<br />
ends </p>
