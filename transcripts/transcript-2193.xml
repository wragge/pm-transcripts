FOR PRESS P. M. No 36/ 1970<br />
SIGNING OF AGREEMENTS FOR THE DARTMOUTH DAM<br />
The Prime Minister and the Premiers of New South Wales,<br />
Victoria and South Australia today signed the two agreements relating to<br />
the construction of Dartmouth Dam.<br />
One agreement amends the River Murray Waters Agreement<br />
to authorise construction of the Dartmouth Dam on the Mitta Mitta River,<br />
a tributary of the River Murray, while the other agreement relates to<br />
the financial arrangements. The opportunity has also been taken to<br />
modernise the original River Murray Waters Agreement parts of which<br />
have been in force since 1915.<br />
The Prime Minister said the way was now clear to introduce<br />
legislation into the four Parliaments to ratify the amendments agreed to.<br />
With Dartmouth, South Australia will get an increased<br />
allocation of almost one quarter of a million acre feet per annum.<br />
A further a~ mendment provides that, in times of drought, all<br />
water available to the River Murray Commission will be shared equally.<br />
Up to now, the sharing has been in the proportions 5: 5: 3 ( 3 being South<br />
Australia). The Dartmouth Dam itself will consist of a central earth core<br />
flanked by rock as an outer shell, forming an embankment of maximum<br />
height of 590 feet, with a crest length of 2, 300 feet and a total volume of<br />
fill of about 20 million cubic yards.<br />
A storage of approximately 3 million acre feet will be<br />
impounded behind this Dam.<br />
The State Rivers and Water Supply Commission of Victoria<br />
will be the Constructing Authority for the Dam and it is expected to retain<br />
the Snowy Mountains Authority as consultants to undertake designs and<br />
prepare contract documents. e / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
In 1963, a bridging-agreement was reached between the River<br />
Murray Commission and the State-of New-South Wales whereby the Commission<br />
became entitled to use some of the water from the Menindee Lakes Storage.<br />
This agreement was to operate for seven years and one of the new amendments<br />
will provide for the use of this water from the Menindee Scheme in<br />
perpetuity. Amongst other things, this will ensure adequate emergency<br />
supplies of water for South Australia within a reasonable distance of that<br />
State. Another amendment provides for the provision of a system of<br />
storage at Lake Victoria with inlet and outlet works that are of a size<br />
that will, in the opinion of the Contracting Governments, ensure the<br />
effect iveness of tihe system of storage in the regulation of the River<br />
Murray ( including operations after the Dartmouth Reservoir has become<br />
effective for the purpose of the Agreement).<br />
The financial arrangements for the construction of the Dam<br />
provide for the Commonwealth, in addition to paying its own share, to lend<br />
to each of the States at the long-term Commonwealth bond rate prevailing<br />
at the time when the loan was made one half of their share of the costs.<br />
Such loans would be subject to the usual interest payments, but repayment<br />
of capital would be deferred for ten years and would take place over the<br />
subsequent fifteen years.<br />
