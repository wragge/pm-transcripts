    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister and Commonwealth Secretary-General, the Rt Hon Don McKinnon, met in Sydney today to discuss arrangements for the forthcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), to take place in Brisbane 6 - 9 October.  </p>
<p>Mr Howard said that as the first meeting of Commonwealth leaders in the new millennium it is a particular pleasure for Australia to be hosting this meeting.  Membership of the Commonwealth brings many benefits to Australia.  It is a forum for working collectively with other nations to advance common foreign, economic, social and development interests.  And many Australians are active participants in the vast network of people-to-people organisations that meet under the Commonwealth banner.  </p>
<p>Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth will open the CHOGM, which will be the most important international meeting held in Australia this year, bringing together nearly a third of the world's leaders.  In the 20 years since Australia last hosted the CHOGM in 1981, an additional 24 countries have joined the Commonwealth, highlighting its continuing relevance and value to members.  Over half the Commonwealth's leaders have already indicated they will come to Brisbane.  </p>
<p>Commonwealth members share bonds of history, culture and language, and a commitment to developing practical solutions to the problems confronting its diverse membership.  The Commonwealth has a creditable record in dealing with issues such as racism, conflict resolution, debt relief and sustainable development and has a particular relevance in the Pacific, through its support for the special concerns of small states.    </p>
<p>In Brisbane leaders will review global political and economic developments in the two years since their last meeting in Durban.  They will also agree on the key contributions the Commonwealth can make in the future, in support of democratic values, good governance, conflict prevention and resolution, and responsible economic management.  The Secretary-General is currently consulting all Commonwealth heads of government, and Australia as CHOGM host, on the agenda for the meeting.  </p>
<p>The theme for the CHOGM will be "The Commonwealth in the 21st Century:<br />
Continuity and Renewal", highlighting the Commonwealth's capacity for renewal in the face of fresh challenges.  A High Level Review Group, of which the Prime Minister is a member, will devise ways to ensure the Commonwealth remains a relevant and potent force in the new millennium.</p>
<p>The CHOGM will showcase Australia, and the Brisbane venue, to approximately 3000-3500 delegates (which includes 1000 national and international media) from around the world.  Approximately 3,300 hotel rooms have been booked for CHOGM delegates and associated visitors and it will provide business opportunities for Brisbane industries such as tourism, hospitality, catering, printing, volunteering, transport and accommodation.</p>
<p>Commonwealth leaders will not be the only people meeting in Australia.  Parallel events such as the Commonwealth Youth Forum, the Commonwealth Business Forum and the Commonwealth People's Centre will reinforce the "people?to?people" links which are a defining feature of the Commonwealth.  The Commonwealth People's Centre will be co-located with the CHOGM venue, the Youth Forum will be held at the Parkroyal, Gold Coast and the Commonwealth Business Forum in Melbourne.</p>
<p>The Australian government is looking forward to hosting this important meeting and working with the Commonwealth Secretary-General to achieve the best outcome possible.</p>
<p>Mr McKinnon, looking ahead to his first CHOGM as Secretary-General, welcomed Australia's strong support for the Commonwealth and its participation in the High Level Review Group, which will map out the future course of the organisation.</p>
