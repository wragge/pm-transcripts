PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
TIME AUSTRALIA SPECIAL BICENTENARY ISSUE<br />
MELBOURNE 11 NOVEMBER, 1987<br />
This special issue of Time is among the first of the vast<br />
number of publications associated with Australia's<br />
Bicentenary. So once again Time has scooped its competitors.<br />
But it is a very important, and very appropriate, initiative<br />
by Time Australia.<br />
Important, because it brings the approach of the Bicentenary<br />
into sharp focus, before an international readership.<br />
And appropriate, because of what Time Australia itself<br />
represents. In Time Australia, we have an example of an outstandingly<br />
successful news venture, based on the world's greatest<br />
magazine, but already becoming identifiably Australian in<br />
character. This is already Time with an Australian accent.<br />
But, of course, the American connection remains strong.<br />
And in this as on the wider level of our relations long<br />
may it continue to be so.<br />
Indeed, we may see in this connection something symbolic of<br />
one of the central facts about the Bicentenary itself.<br />
We all know the direct link of history between the American<br />
War of Independence and the foundation of Australia the<br />
loss of the American colonies as a receptacle for<br />
transportation. But there is an even more fundamental connection between the<br />
America of 1788 and the Australia of 1988.<br />
The theme of this Bicentenary issue of Time is " The World of<br />
1788" d" 4 3 c~ y~ </p>
<p>2.<br />
And in that world of 1788, two events of immense importance<br />
were about to take place the two events which have most<br />
shaped the modern Western world.<br />
In the United States, the Founding Fathers had completed the<br />
Constitution, and George Washington was about to become the<br />
first President of the world's first modern democracy.<br />
And within a year, the watershed event of modern Europe<br />
would occur the French Revolution.<br />
This is the constellation under which this colony here was<br />
born. It's true that no nation could have had more unpromising<br />
beginnings. But our beginning was also a time of a new beginning for the.<br />
Western world the inauguration of the great experiment in<br />
democracy. And this, of course, shaped the next two hundred years,<br />
decisively for Australia, and for the Western world.<br />
It is the democratic experience, which began in the United<br />
States in 1788, which links us directly, in 1988, with the<br />
world of 1788, described in this special issue of Time.<br />
The approaching Bicentenary is, among other things, a time<br />
for reflection.<br />
In particular, it is an occasion to reflect on the impact of<br />
the last 200 years on the original inhabitants of the land.<br />
This special issue contains a great deal of material to<br />
prompt serious thought about both our past and even more<br />
important, our future.<br />
Just a word about the cover painting. Brett Whiteley has<br />
already made a considerable contribution to artistic<br />
endeavour in Australia.<br />
The winner of three of Australia's most prestigious<br />
prizes for art: the Archibald Prize and the Sulman<br />
Prize in 1976 and 1978 and the Wynne Prize in 1977 and<br />
1978; His work is highly visible in the Australian community<br />
and is especially noted for its critical examination of<br />
Australia's place in the modern wortd.<br />
It strikes me as a very appropriate honour that Time<br />
Australia has accorded Brett in commissioning him to<br />
undertake this work for this special issue.<br />
Congratulations Brett. </p>
<p>3.<br />
I'm still trying to find the time to read the whole of this<br />
issue of Time but, and some of you will not be surprised, I<br />
have read with some amusement the article about a cricket<br />
match which might have taken place in 1787.<br />
The article says:<br />
" The rules committee, including the Earl of Tankerville and<br />
the Duke of Dorset, is expected to confirm the<br />
leg-before-wicket rule and the use of three stumps a<br />
sensible measure adopted after Lumpy Stevens, England's<br />
greatest bowler, failed to dislodge a stubborn tail-ender,<br />
despite three deliveries that passed between the wickets.<br />
There will also be a fixed limit on the size of bats, to<br />
counter such imaginative tactics as those used by the<br />
Ryegate player White, who attempted to use a willow as wide<br />
as the stumps."<br />
Jeff Penberthy, I congratulate you and the management of<br />
Time Australia for this excellent production, and thank you<br />
for the creativity and foresight in making it such a fitting<br />
curtain-raiser for the Bicentennial celebrations. </p>
