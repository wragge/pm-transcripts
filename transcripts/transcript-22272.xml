    <content><![CDATA[<p>I will visit United States, Canada and Ireland from 12-25 May 2006.</p>
<p>During my official visit to Washington, I will meet President George W. Bush and look forward to reinforcing with him the strong bilateral relationship between the United States and Australia. We will also consult on critical regional and global issues. I also look forward to meeting senior members of the US Administration including Vice-President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Rice, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and Energy Secretary Bodman. I will also meet Congressional leaders.</p>
<p>I will travel to Chicago where I will deliver a major address to the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
<p> Australia is one of the United States' closest allies and partners, and continues to work with the United States toward the common goals of promoting peace, freedom, and prosperity through fighting terrorism, preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and promoting an open international economic order.</p>
<p>My visit to Ottawa, at the invitation of the Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper, is an excellent opportunity to renew and strengthen Australia's links with Canada.  Australia and Canada have shared histories and values which provide a foundation for more intensive cooperation on common global challenges. I look forward to exploring with Prime Minister Harper ways in which our two countries can expand our bilateral links. I will also address a Joint Session of the Canadian Parliament. Separately, I will meet Canadian business leaders to advance the trade and investment ties between our two countries.</p>
<p>  In Dublin, I will meet my Irish counterpart, Mr Bertie Ahern, and the Irish President, Mrs Mary McAleese, and address the Irish Parliament.  I will deliver a speech to a large gathering of influential members of the Irish business community. The visit provides a valuable opportunity to build on the historically close and increasingly dynamic relationship between Australia and Ireland, and to further pursue our mutual interests in expanding trade and investment, people to people links and practical cooperation in areas such as research and development, information technology and education.   </p>
