PRIME MINISTER 94/ 94<br />
MESSAGE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TO MEMBERS OF THE<br />
NATIONAL MULTICULTURAL ADVISORY COUNCIL, TO MARK THE<br />
COUNCIL'S INAUGURAL MEETING: 26 OCTOBER 1994<br />
I thank you for agreeing to serve on the National Multicultural Advisory<br />
Council. The task ahead is a very important one for members. I look forward<br />
to the Council's contributions to the Government's efforts to achieve further<br />
advances in our multicultural agenda.<br />
We are a truly multicultural society, and deeply conscious of the fact.<br />
Importantly, there is a widespread view in Australia today that multiculturalism<br />
is a positive thing.<br />
However, it would not be wise simply to rest on the achievements of the past<br />
we must build on them.<br />
To do this we need to re-assess our current policies and what our priorities<br />
are for the future.<br />
A re-assessment of our multicultural policies is of central importance to<br />
Australians as we debate the relevant social, economic and political issues of<br />
today including the issues related to national identity.<br />
The formation of the Council comes at a critical time in this debate. I place<br />
great importance on your task of updating the National Agenda for a<br />
Multicultural Australia.<br />
I look forward to hearing your views about the policy relevance of<br />
multicultural issues leading to the year 2000 and beyond and wish you well in<br />
your work.<br />
