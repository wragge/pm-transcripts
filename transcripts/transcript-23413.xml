    <content><![CDATA[<p>It’s an honour to address this Boao Forum, which now rivals Europe’s long-running Davos Forum, and which does so much to showcase the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>I am pleased to be the fourth Australian prime minister to attend, and will be a regular participant in the future.</p>
<p>On this trip to China, I am accompanied by the foreign minister, the trade minister, five state premiers, one chief minister, and 30 of my country’s most senior chairmen and CEOs.</p>
<p>It’s one of the most important delegations ever to leave Australia.</p>
<p>What better way could there be to demonstrate that Australia is open for business: than to visit all three of our largest export partners on the one trip, culminating with the biggest one?</p>
<p>And to conclude free trade negotiations with Japan; sign the free trade agreement with Korea; and, perhaps most hopeful of all, accelerate free trade talks with China?</p>
<p>With a collective GDP of $15 trillion and a combined population of more than 1.5 billion in North Asia alone, the world’s economic and geo-political centre of gravity has decisively shifted towards our region.</p>
<p>The rise from the ashes of war to economic leadership by Japan, by Korea; and by China – most spectacularly of all – has been a transformation unparalleled in human history.</p>
<p>The rest of the world is rightly in awe of the way these countries have lifted hundreds of millions of people into the middle class in just a generation.</p>
<p>This is the greatest and the quickest advance in human welfare of all time.</p>
<p>It’s happened because governments have allowed individuals and families to take more control of their own futures.</p>
<p>It’s been a practical acknowledgement of the inherent capability of every human being.</p>
<p>I am proud that Australian coal, iron ore, gas and services exports have helped to drive this prosperity.</p>
<p>Australia has the natural and human endowments to give the countries of our region the resource security, the food security and the energy security that all seek.</p>
<p>Australia has the capacity and the reliability to be the energy supplier and the food supplier to our region.</p>
<p>After all, Australia is the number one global exporter of coal, iron ore and beef.</p>
<p>We are the world’s fourth largest exporter of gas.</p>
<p>Australia is fifth in the number of universities in the world’s top 100, and hosts the fourth highest number of international students.</p>
<p>On a GDP basis, we have the world’s 12th largest economy, the world’s fifth highest standard of living and the world’s 5th most traded currency.</p>
<p>And we have first class military forces that regularly operate with the world’s best.</p>
<p>Australia is strong enough to be a valuable partner, but not a dominant one.</p>
<p>Last week, I twice visited the Pearce airbase near Perth to thank the aviators searching for the missing flight MH370.</p>
<p>I particularly thanked the airmen from China, Japan and Korea – who are planning and executing missions together – along with their counterparts from Malaysia, New Zealand, Australia and the United States.</p>
<p>This cooperation in a good cause is a powerful antidote to the strategic pessimism that sometimes clouds discussions of our region’s future.</p>
<p>It is yet another demonstration that the countries of our region can achieve so much more together than apart.</p>
<p>Indeed, the comparison of our region’s pre-war and post-war history abundantly demonstrates that we will all advance together – or we won’t advance at all.</p>
<p>Australia’s preference is always to look forwards rather than backwards; to win friends rather than to find fault; to be helpful, not difficult.</p>
<p>Team Australia is here in China to help build the Asian Century.</p>
<p>China, after all, has taken to heart Deng Xiaoping’s advice that “to get rich is glorious”.</p>
<p>And China should be richer still, thanks to Premier Li’s reforms.</p>
<p>To be rich is indeed glorious – but to be a true friend is sublime.</p>
<p>Australia is not in China to do a deal, but to be a friend.</p>
<p>We don’t just visit because we need to, but because we want to.</p>
<p>Our region and our world need peace and understanding based on international law and mutual respect.</p>
<p>Participation in this Forum has helped to build Australia’s strategic partnership with China which has much to offer each country and our region.</p>
