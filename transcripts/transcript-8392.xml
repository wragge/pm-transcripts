TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, HOBART, 23 JANUARY 1992<br />
( inaudible)<br />
PM: I think they have to stick with a Government which has<br />
given Tasmania an industrial future and given Tasmania<br />
a reasonable decent set of financial accounts. I think<br />
it needs to be remembered just how far the<br />
discretionary gap, the gap between discrete spending<br />
and revenue was under Mr Gray's Government. It was 30% 6<br />
and th:-Ls community pays, I think, a real trauma in that<br />
which Premier Field and the Field Government have very<br />
largely now overcome and so in terms of really the<br />
hardest sort of work which is keeping a State within<br />
its capacity to spend and afford it, that sort of hard<br />
grinding work, while at the same time keeping all the<br />
industrial facilities going. That hard grinding work,<br />
Premier Field has done and the message I give to<br />
Tasmanians is hang on to him.<br />
Why didn't you stay longer? Why are you flying in and<br />
flying out not meeting the people?<br />
PM Well, ' I've come down at the first opportunity and I'm<br />
seeing quite a lot of people tonight, 170 I think, and<br />
the Chamber of Manufacturers in Launceston, they're<br />
people as far as I know.<br />
the capital Prime Minister?<br />
PM: And I know about this Hobart/ Launceston thing and I'm<br />
quite happy to visit the Premier here in Hobart and<br />
speak in Launceston tonight and I think people<br />
( inaudible Michael Field and he should stay<br />
( inaudible) </p>
<p>Mr Keating do you suggest that the GST played a part in the<br />
Liberal loss in the NSW by-election? I assume you think<br />
that Federal issues have been postponed?<br />
PM: Well, Dr Hewson's goods and services tax package, apart<br />
from putting his hands into every pocket of every<br />
person in the country for everything they buy, is also<br />
about a 5 per cent reduction in the Commonwealth<br />
payments to the States. That's a $ 40 million reduction<br />
in the income of Tasmania and that's a very large<br />
impost on the State, that would have to be made up by<br />
taxes and charges. This is a State with a relatively<br />
small population and it will mean a very heavy impost<br />
on most Tasmanians. I'm really at a loss as to why the<br />
Leader of the Opposition here, Mr Groom, is supporting<br />
the Figlatback, the Hewson Fightback package when it is<br />
going to rip $ 40 million off Tasmania.<br />
Yes, you would think that Tasmanians would understand that<br />
they would be voting on those Federal issues and...<br />
PM: Well, they certainly will to the extent that the<br />
Coalition has been asking people to endorse the policy<br />
which the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Groom, supports<br />
of taking $ 40 million off the State.<br />
So we had to have a recession, don't we have to have a<br />
fightback?<br />
PM: I don't deny that Dr Hewson has a plan but it is the<br />
wrong plan. A plan that says if we can't really get<br />
honest suggestions that all the things that matter to<br />
Australia, like jobs, recovery, growth, investment,<br />
exports, national efficiency, all of that would be<br />
fixed by tax on your Wheat Bix and your clothes. Does<br />
anyone really think that can happen? While at the same<br />
time blow out the inflation rate/ interest rate out with<br />
it. I mean that's what people have got to understand<br />
what this really means. I mean this is a very nasty<br />
package, wrapped up, a very nasty tax wrapped up with<br />
some tax give-aways which are not as large as the tax<br />
burden which will fail on most Australians.<br />
of Immigration, Graeme Campbell came to say that you<br />
have made a blunder in comments and suggested that anyone<br />
who now knows his<br />
PM: I don't think that's right. I think that it's<br />
important that people understand what population growth<br />
is all about and what it means in national growth and<br />
national demand and on my part I welcome Dr Hewson's<br />
assurance that he will debate this issue, rationally,<br />
sensibly and not return to the sort of themes which<br />
were running in 1988. </p>
<p>any comments you have made?<br />
PM: No, because no, I think this is an important subject to<br />
Australians. People can't pretend that this has<br />
economic: implications and then address them in a throw<br />
away line in a doorstop in a by-election.<br />
How embarrasing has it been, the Solicitor-General's<br />
PM: Well I don't think embarrasing, but the Attorney's<br />
office has made a decision about that and he did not<br />
speak to me nor did he need to.<br />
Did you ever<br />
PM: None whatsoever, I've not spoken to the Attorney about<br />
it either directly or indirectly.<br />
Given that the Opposition hag been pushing the GST so hard<br />
in Tasmania, would this election have been a qood chance for<br />
you to come down?<br />
PM: Well, I. ll be saying some things tonight at quite a<br />
large meeting and talking about what I think are the<br />
real issues of Australian that is, to be on the<br />
recovery, to return to higher rates of employment, to<br />
maintain a low inflation rate and low interest rates,<br />
to build our capital stocks and build more production,<br />
to produce more and therefore reduce the current<br />
account deficit, to make all the factories of Australia<br />
work effEiciently, tLo make sure the transport system<br />
works efficiently, these are the real issues, and the<br />
consumption taxes they put in relation to those<br />
issues -is a tenth order issue. And so what Dr Hewson<br />
has done is taken a tenth order issue and tried to<br />
manufacture it into a first order issue and then sold<br />
it. Well the fact is it is a very nasty number. It is<br />
very nasty for most Australians but worse of all that<br />
it is not about the real thing, it is not about the<br />
issues -that matter. It is not about the things which<br />
will remedy Australia's economic difficulty.<br />
But 62% of Australia say that Dr Hewson is doing it well?<br />
PM: Well that's OK, but I mean again we will make our<br />
point, this-Government has been about reducing the tax<br />
burden of Australians. This is now the second lowest<br />
taxed country in the OECD. And it is a very strange<br />
debate when you have got people believing you can be<br />
popular in saying that Australia has long term<br />
fundamental difficulties, what it needs to remedy all<br />
this is a new tax. And you say really? What we really<br />
need is a new tax? Well it is a novel twist of the<br />
debate and as the issues are opened up, I'm quite sure<br />
Australians will come to weigh much more carefully than </p>
<p>what is your position here?<br />
PM: Well we put a Bill in the Parliament and I think<br />
there is only one issue here, will the Liberal Party<br />
agree to the package of resource security legislation.<br />
in the Senate of the Commonwealth. If they do there<br />
will be an Act. A Bill for an Act, and it will be an.<br />
Act of~ Parliament. If they don't the Resource Security<br />
will go down and its Mr Groom, who I think, and the<br />
Liberal Party, who the questions should be directed to.<br />
We have got our Bill in the Chamber.<br />
Has the Premier asked you to do anything to pave the way for<br />
his gas proposals and the steel proposals for the North West<br />
Coast? PM: He has and I ( inaudible)... . which I think would be good<br />
for Tasmanians and I'm sure he will be pleased to say-a<br />
few words in<br />
Can't we get from you Prime Minister part of this..<br />
PM: He is the PremierletA tell you. It's his proposal.<br />
What did he ask you to do?<br />
PM: Well hie's asked the Commonwealth to share in the costs<br />
of a feasibility study for the Steel mill and I have<br />
given certain undertakings which he'll reveal to you.<br />
Is this the way Tasmania should be going with these 2<br />
proposals? PM: Well at least I think the fundamentals seem to be there<br />
and the way of testing the fundamentals is in the way I<br />
think government to. Tasmanians are always going to<br />
have play to its naturals strengths and these projects are<br />
about draw:' Lng those strengths together and enhancing them<br />
and the Government I think has been very sensible about<br />
doing it, about supporting it.<br />
And so you support<br />
PM: Well -: have done my best to<br />
So totally insignificant in the national picture, are we,<br />
Tasmania'? You consider it an insignificant part of your<br />
Commonwealth picture?<br />
PM: How do come to that point?<br />
I'm asking thequestion, are we important in your plan of<br />
Australia? PM: Absolutely, I mean it is an Australian State, the<br />
population is small but that just means that all we are </p>
<p>seeing is basically the same. I think all of the publi. c<br />
policy and development issues are difficult regardless<br />
of size. In the other States, the numbers might be<br />
larger, but problems are much the same. And all of<br />
Australia is going to have to play to its natural<br />
strengths. In other words, comparative advantage. And<br />
Australia will, as we are doing now, lifting the growth<br />
in trade, playing to our natural advantage. And I<br />
think Tasmania will continue to do more of that in the<br />
future. Because in the end it's natural advantage and<br />
comparative advantage which gives any trading entity a<br />
chance and that is what the Premier is trying to do in<br />
seeking possibilities here for projects which are<br />
comparative or natural advantage.<br />
What are Labor's changes in the next election?<br />
PM: Well I think that the Premier has taken on just about<br />
the toughest: job of any of the States. The fiscal task in<br />
Tasmania was greater than any of the States. And when I was<br />
Treasurer, I can tell you this, the fiscal difficulties of<br />
Tasmania was greater than any of the States and Michael<br />
Field has done more than anybody could ever have imagined to<br />
reoair that yawning gap which Premier Gray left him and the<br />
people of Tasmania. And not only that, been able to balance<br />
the issues and balance the forces in politics so that the<br />
place keeps on developing. I think he has got a very<br />
natural touch in balancing competing issues and demand and<br />
at the same time, a good economic manager. And what the<br />
Opposition are proposing is for the Opposition leader,<br />
somebody who Mr Fraser thought wasn't competent enough to<br />
be a Federal Minister and who is supporting a policy which<br />
claws a heap of money out of the States.<br />
prospect of another hung Parliament?<br />
PM: Obviously I'm not here to give you a cheek by joul<br />
seat by seat opinion about which seats would be won, but the<br />
Government has performed strongly, this is the right answer<br />
for Tasmanians, the Field Government, and I think if ever<br />
there was a Premier who on the basis of sheer hard work and<br />
courage has took, on the tough issues and got on top of them,<br />
has asked for another mandate, it is Michael Field.<br />
