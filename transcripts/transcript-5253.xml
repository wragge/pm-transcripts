PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT THURSDAY, 7 FEBRUARY, 1980<br />
PRIME MINISTER AND PRESIDENT CARTER<br />
THE WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON<br />
President Carter<br />
Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser of Australia, who camne here<br />
a few days ago to consult very closely with me on matters of<br />
common interest to our two countries, particularly the late<br />
developing events centred around the Soviet invasion of<br />
Afghanistan. Following his visit here, Prime Minister Fraser<br />
went to London to meet with the Prime minister of the<br />
United Kingdom Great Britain then went to meet with the<br />
Chancellor of Germany and then the President of France.<br />
Following those visits, the leaders of the European countries<br />
suggested that because his meetings were so fruitful with them<br />
that he might stop by to see me again to give me a report on<br />
their consultations in Europe. I am deeply grateful that<br />
Prime Minister Fraser has been willing to do this. His report<br />
has indeed been helpful. We are grateful also that Australia<br />
because of their courageous stand as an ally of ours in<br />
condemninig the invasion that threatens the peace in South West<br />
Asia and the Persian Gulf region, the fact that as a major<br />
exporter of grain Australia immediately announced that they would<br />
not replace the grain being withheld by our country from the<br />
Soviet Union. I am also very pleased at the close military,<br />
economic and political alliance that exists among Australia,<br />
New Zealand and the United States. There ias a meeting of<br />
Foreign Ministers scheduled in this alliance in July. At the<br />
suggestion of Prime Minister Fraser we have decided to move that<br />
meeting up until the last week in February so that we can<br />
expedite the common discussions among us about the situation in<br />
the Indian Ocean and the regions bordering that sea.<br />
We have had a thorough discussion about the Olympics and what<br />
might be done concerning the Olympics if the Soviets do not<br />
quickly withdraw all their forces from Afghanistan. Prime Minister<br />
Fraser has taken the lead in this discussion and consultation<br />
as well. It is with a great deal of pleasure that I have welcomed<br />
him back here. I would like to ask him, as an honoured guest,<br />
to make a few comments to you.<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
Thank you very much Mr. President. I value very greatly indeed<br />
the discussions that we had a few days ago, and also today.<br />
I had said at the outset that this round of discussions that I<br />
have undertaken, that it is important for the development of<br />
Australia's own policy in the future to know as well as possible<br />
tie mind of the President of the United States, the policies of<br />
this country, and also of principal countries in Europe. We have<br />
no presumnptuous view of the influence of 14 million Australians,<br />
but we are determined to play what part we can in a cause that<br />
is important for free peoples wherever they may be. We are glad<br />
indeed, and thankful, that the United States has responded in<br />
recent days, that the President made and delivered the statement / 2 </p>
<p>JOINT STATEMENT, WHITE HOUSE -2-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
he did in the State of the Union message which should surely<br />
give clear warnings to the Soviets about any further moves<br />
beyond Afghanistan and the clear need, as there clearly is,<br />
to bring greater reassurance to the world by removing forces<br />
from Afghanistan.<br />
There are times when all of us in independent nations have<br />
necessarily to depend on the United States for the kind of world<br />
in which we live. This is the world's greatest free power,<br />
the strongest country in the world. In times of danger, in times<br />
of invasion, as there have been the Soviet invasion of<br />
Afghanistan it is the United States that must set a lead.<br />
The United States has done what is necessary in the preservation,<br />
as Australia believes, of world peace. Because we strongly<br />
believe that what the President has done is right, because we<br />
strongly believe that what the. President has done is necessary,<br />
Australia has moved to support in what ways we * can the actions<br />
of the United States. We will continue to do so in a cause<br />
which is of such great importance for us all.<br />
The United States has also taken a lead over the matter of<br />
the Olympics. I have shown, some days ago, that small document<br />
that has been handed out by Soviet activists in Moscow giving<br />
their view of what the Olympics means and how they are going to<br />
exploit it amongst their own people. They have made it the<br />
Soviets themselves have made it perfectly plain that they<br />
regard the Olympic Games being held in Moscow as a great social<br />
and political event; not at that moment speaking about a great<br />
sporting event which is what it is meant to be. They have also<br />
made it perfectly plain in their own writings and documents that<br />
they would regard the awarding of the Games to Moscow as a mark<br />
of approval of Soviet foreign policy. Against the background of<br />
their own statements, and against the background of their invasion<br />
of Afghanistan, how can free peoples representatives go to<br />
Moscow, and no matter what they themselves might say, allow the<br />
Soviets to say of them that their presence there is a mark of<br />
approval of Soviet foreign policy. That is plainly, in the<br />
current circumstances, what the Soviet Union would in fact be<br />
saying.<br />
Mr. President, I welcome very much the discussions that we have<br />
been able to have. They have been extraordinarily useful to me.<br />
They have given me much if it was needed much greater<br />
confidence that the United States, together with allies in Europe,<br />
is determined to do what must be done, to preserve all those things<br />
which the people of the United States and the people of Australia<br />
hold most dear. 000---</p>
