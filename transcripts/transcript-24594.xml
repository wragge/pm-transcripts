    <content><![CDATA[<p>Admiral, itâs a privilege to be on the ship. It is an honour to be introduced to some of the shipâs company and it is good to be able to say on behalf of the Australian Government and people how grateful we are for your participation in Operation Talisman Sabre and how appreciative we are of the work that the U.S. forces do with our forces right around the world.</p>
<p>It is a very, very important alliance. Itâs a very important relationship and right now we are facing quite significant challenges in many parts of the world but particularly in the Middle East.</p>
<p>So, I am very appreciative of everything our two countries do together.</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>
