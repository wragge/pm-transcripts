AUSTRALIA'S NATIONAL RESOURCES<br />
The First Six Months<br />
under the Liberal-National Country Party Government<br />
An address by the Acting Prime Minister,<br />
Minister for National Resources and Overseas Trade,<br />
and Leader of the National Country Party of Australia,<br />
RT. HON. J. ANTHONY<br />
to the Broken Hill Branch of<br />
THE AUSTRALASIAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY<br />
Thursday, 2' 4th June, 1976<br />
EMBARGOED: Nor for publication before<br />
24th June 1976 </p>
<p>That I am here tonight talking with mining people<br />
is in itself evidence of the fact that there is a new<br />
attitude by government to your industry.<br />
The Government elected last December believes in<br />
and strongly supports free enterprise. We think that the people<br />
who produce things and market them are in the best position to<br />
make the choices, the decisions, the judgements about their<br />
own affairs. At the same time, we believe that a national<br />
government has a duty to look to the national interest. it<br />
has a duty to see that the nation's resources are used and<br />
developed in ways that do not run against that national irnterest.<br />
And certainly this Government has a firm commitment to encourage,<br />
to stimulate, to work with the private sector with those<br />
great mining organisations, for example, which are of such<br />
significance to the national economy, and therefore to the<br />
lives of every Australian. I hope that what I go on to say to<br />
you will show that these ar ' e not just words, but a fair<br />
statement of our attitude to your i ndustry, of our actions<br />
and of our intentions.<br />
The first six months<br />
It is now six months since the Government was elected.<br />
In every field of business endeavour in Australia, I was aware<br />
of the strongest expectation that the new Government would get<br />
things moving. There was also our belief that the stresses and<br />
uncertainties which characterised the previous Government's<br />
relations with the mining industry would disappear; that the<br />
affronts to our valued overseas customers and Potential<br />
investors would cease; that the near-vendettas which had been<br />
waged against individual companies or sectors of industry would<br />
become a thing of the past.<br />
Tonight I want to review progress in the minerals and<br />
energy areas in our first six months of office; to outline the<br />
steps the Government has taken to create an environment which<br />
will provide the positive encouragement that industry i s<br />
entitled to expect from our Government. In those areas where<br />
expectations have not been realised and there are such areas-<br />
I want you to understand why. I also want to explain why action<br />
has had to be delayed in some areas delay which certainly is<br />
not going to be indefinite.<br />
For three years under the previous Government not one<br />
major new project was commissioned, although the Australian<br />
Mining Industry Council indicated that no fewer than 40 major<br />
projects were ready to proceed with a total investment of<br />
$ 8,000 million at 197' 4 prices.<br />
Could I mention the action the new Government has<br />
taken to help advance this much-needed development?<br />
We have given the go-ahead to three major coal<br />
projects in Queensland Hail Creek, Nebo and Norwich Park<br />
with a production potential of 14 million tonnes a year.<br />
The Government satisfied itself, through my visit to Japan in<br />
February, that there was a reasonable expectation of a market </p>
<p>in Japan for this quantity of coal. We approved certain aspects<br />
of contracts that had been in-limbo. And we arrived at equity<br />
arrangements different for each project which provide<br />
adequate local participation but do not inhibit development. -I<br />
will say more on that point later. So these arrangements have<br />
all been concluded and there is no roadblock at the Commonwealth<br />
level to these projects proceeding. These three projects<br />
alone will involve capital investment estimated at $ 1500 million<br />
at today's prices.<br />
Inevitably there is a lag in all major developments<br />
between the settlement of the basic framework and the construction<br />
stage. In the case of Hail Creek, for example, the next step<br />
and one now currently proceeding is a detailed feasibility<br />
study costing over $ 4f million and extending over the next<br />
months. This is probably not unrepresentative, and I<br />
underline this fact: if a company is to embark on a project<br />
involving hundreds of millions of dollars, then despite its<br />
determination, or its customers' determination, or the<br />
Government's determination to see development, there is always<br />
a considerable lead time and massive feasibility studies before<br />
contracts can be acutally placed.<br />
The roads, railways, houses, rolling stock, port and<br />
mining equipment, and all the flow-through benefits into the<br />
entire economy that every Australian wishes to see, just cannot<br />
materialise overnight. And bear this in mind: when many of the<br />
final decisions are being made next year as to whether the<br />
project can proceed, what has happened in the meantime to<br />
Australia's competitive position in the world market will exert<br />
a major influence. On iron ore, again we have moved swiftly to ensure that<br />
much-delayed development can occur. Australian companies are<br />
actively negotiating with the Japanese on the following West<br />
Australian projects: i<br />
* Expansion and beneficiation of Hamersley an<br />
additional 7 million tonnes a year.<br />
* Expansion of Robe River an additional ~ 4 million<br />
tonnes a year ( with a reduced Australian equity<br />
approved by the Government so the development can<br />
prodleed). The development ( and I mention them in alphabetical<br />
order) of th#., new projects of Area C, Deepdale and<br />
Marandoo involving in all a planned initial production<br />
of about 50 million tonnes a year, and of course Mt.<br />
Newman has expansion plans also.<br />
These projects combined would involve a total<br />
expenditure of $ 1800 million. It is expected that export<br />
contracts for some of them will be forthcoming from the Japanese<br />
mills this year. I would explain that the Government is not<br />
setting any priorities as between individual projects, recognising<br />
that this is properly a matter for commercial negotiation.<br />
This is an example of how private enterprise decisions are<br />
encouraged and respected by the Government. I stressed to / 3 </p>
<p>the Japanese in February that Australia is an efficient and<br />
stable supplier, and has the advantage of-geographic proximity.<br />
I said they should consider the economic advantages of increasing<br />
the proportion of iron ore requirements taken from Australia.<br />
As with coal, of course, the new iron ore projects will involve<br />
a considerable lead time.<br />
For both the iron ore and the coal projects, the<br />
Government's decision to introduce a 40% initial investment<br />
allowance has been of assistance in making these projects more<br />
attractive relative to those of our major competitors.<br />
In contrast to the attitude of the last Government, I<br />
have stated repeatedly that the new Government will allow the<br />
limited export of natural gas to assist development of the<br />
North-West Shelf. Proposals for development have now been<br />
received from the North-West Shelf Joint Venture and are being<br />
examined as speedily as possible by both the West Australian and<br />
Commonwealth Governments. Amongst other things, it will be<br />
necessary to examine the proposed level of exports against<br />
Australia's own reasonable future requirements for natural gas.<br />
Up-dated information is being studied, but I am satisfied that,<br />
if we are competitive Japan could be ready for us to supply a<br />
proportion of her uncommitted requirements from the early<br />
eighties. A lengthy lead time is involved for development. The<br />
company is speaking of further evaluation work with a subsequent<br />
total expenditure if the findings are favourable of the<br />
order of $ 2000 million. The company says that, under ideal<br />
circumstances, construction could start with the objective of<br />
gas coming on stream in early 1983. But I expect benefits to<br />
Western Australia and the rest of the nation by way of increased<br />
activity would be experienced well before then.<br />
The Government has also acted on other projects. It has<br />
approved the overseas investment aspects of the Jododex project<br />
outside Goulburn, NSW, while an expenditure programme on the<br />
Agnew Nickel project in Western Australia has been announced.<br />
The Milmerran coal project in Queensland is also the subject of<br />
renewed activity, although the previous Government had not<br />
permitted overseas investment in this area.<br />
In the area of our traditional base metals, some<br />
companies have suffered from lower demand and lower prices caus= esby<br />
the world recession at a time when the costs of o7peration nave<br />
been rapidly increasing. The resultant low returns hnave been to<br />
the detriment of some townships, the companies themselves and<br />
the workers who rely on them.<br />
These hardships, though not universal, have been very<br />
real to those concerned. They are still being suffered. Nothing<br />
short of a significant upturn in world economic activity is<br />
likely to correct the situation. In the meantime, it is obvi , ous<br />
that the companies involved in this situation cannot be expected<br />
to generate significant impetus for fresh development.<br />
Moves to stimulate oil search<br />
The search for oil in Australia is at its lowest level<br />
for more than a decade. In 1972, 100 wells were drilled in this<br />
country. In 1975 there were 23. This has been brought about by </p>
<p>the combination of a number of factors including lac'k<br />
prospectivity, the lack off s-ignificant successes for a niumber<br />
of years, the active discouragement of private exploration by zte<br />
previous Government and by the fact that new discoveries would<br />
be rewarded only at the level of existing production that is,<br />
$ 2.08 to $ 2.23 per barrel, or about one quarter of the present<br />
world price despite, in recent years, both the oil crisis anc<br />
a continuing high rate of inflation.<br />
The price of new discoveries of oil is now related<br />
to import parity the only sensible basis on which! it can be<br />
set in today's circumstances. And the Government has also<br />
given attention to the price of oil in reservoirs alread y<br />
discovered, generally known as " old oil" T. Although some<br />
increases were granted by the previous Government in late 1975,<br />
it is questionable whether they are sufficient to bring about<br />
the maximum possible recovery of oil in known pools. There is<br />
also the related question of the need to encourage those<br />
companies which have already proved -themselves successful<br />
explorers to expand their exploration effort or, at least, to<br />
maintain it at the existing level.<br />
Accordingly, the Government has instituted an<br />
independent inquiry by the Industries Assistance Commission. THis<br />
will recommend an appropriate price for known oil from both the<br />
fields now producing oil and those discovered but awaiting<br />
exploitatio. n. The Government has asked for the report to be<br />
completed by the end of September.<br />
I am confident that the Government's approach to the<br />
oil pricing question is fair, and will provide a much-needed<br />
stimulus to the oil exploration industry. Already we-have<br />
confirmed that all offshore petroleum titles granted by the<br />
States in recent years have the full recognition of the<br />
Commonwealth in the context of Commonwealth legislation. I am<br />
acutely aware that this most depressed of industries is, however,<br />
slow in showing real signs of recovery.<br />
The most sensitive, -the most difficult, the most<br />
important single issue in the area, of national resources is that<br />
o/ f uranium. There is currently proceeding a major Inquiry under<br />
the Environment Protection ( Impact of Proposals) Act the<br />
' Ranger or Fox Inquiry and it would be wrong to canvass uranium<br />
issues in depth until the report of that Commission has been<br />
received and considered by the Government.<br />
I merely want to say this: for over two years any<br />
meaningful activity in this area ceased while the planners<br />
pondered. In the meantime, largely because of the world energy<br />
crisis, the price of uranium has increased from around $ 6 or<br />
$ 7 US per lb. to around $ 140 US per lb. One of the very few<br />
companies with courage to undertake a proving programme<br />
doubled its reserves in this period. The current Australian<br />
reserves position of about 400,000 short tons must therefore<br />
be regarded as conservative indeed.<br />
Should large-scale mining and export of uranium proceed,<br />
then even on conservative assumptions, an export income of<br />
around $ 1000 million per year at current money values can<br />
be envisaged. Some would put the figure higher. If uranium<br />
enrichment should prove possible and economically attractive, </p>
<p>the figure could double. The ura.' nium industry has the<br />
potential to contrK:;' e-to the Australian economy on a scale<br />
which probably ex'; 5that of any other single development.<br />
Irwo or:'-Z3are often put forward: firstly, that by<br />
the year 2000 ab of the western world's electrical<br />
generating capacl. ty7 -1111 be accounted for by nuclear power;<br />
secondly, that earj. y in the next century, fusion or other<br />
technology will jha/' advanced to the stage where the demand for<br />
uranium will be re-;_ t. vely insignificant.<br />
Were it the unique material that it is, the<br />
obvious commercial archwould be to develop and export<br />
uranium while the :. fc~ tfor it lasts. But uranium is not<br />
solely a commercial -Gue although I know some would-like<br />
to think it so. Th' 2 Government has indicated that it will<br />
not take final poli,-. y decisions regarding future uranium<br />
development until it~ has received and considered the report<br />
of the Inquiry. I emphasi: ; e again that we are dealing with something<br />
of enormous potential economic benefit to Australia and an<br />
area of major itrr to our trading partners. It involves<br />
a commodity of such, , ensitivity as to be without parallel.<br />
The issues demand thiat any action by the Government be considered<br />
action; that it be a. rtion which can be explained fully to all<br />
sectors of the comrmunilty; that it have proper regard to any<br />
well-founded concern,-, or requirements. This is not a matter<br />
which can be approached on any basis other than calm, considered<br />
judgements, and we are determined that this will happen..<br />
Priorities must be puit in order<br />
That brings-me to the end of our quick review of some<br />
particular areas. Buit there are some matters of fundamental<br />
importance which concern the whole minerals and energy sector.<br />
There are things such as incentives to capital investment;<br />
the effectiveness of the mining taxation system in Australia which<br />
was so drastically a3ltered under the previous Government; the<br />
ability to generate Anfd attract risk capital; the need to<br />
revitalise explorati. on in every sphere of mining and drilling<br />
activity; the need to work with industry and State Governments<br />
to consciously seek out and, whenever possible, remove obstacles<br />
to future development. These are ,; ome of the broad areas where the mining<br />
industry has every rijght to expect understanding and direction<br />
from this Government. But clearly a specific incentive or series of<br />
incentives to the mininfg industry is not going to achieve any<br />
worthwhile long-term result if our rate of inflation continues<br />
to rear above that oC. -the rest of the developed world. Unless<br />
inflation is contained, it will quickly consume any advantage<br />
received by any particular sector of the Australian community.<br />
Control of inflation has to be the first task of a<br />
responsible Governmont today. I make no apologies for this<br />
emphasis. I have bccn personally involved over many weeks in the<br />
most vigorous and rigorous process of screening and pruning of<br />
expenditures that h13ever been undertaken during all the years<br />
that I have been involved. in government. </p>
<p>We must reduce the deficit, so we had to reduce<br />
spending in the public sector. We must get Australia's house<br />
in order before we can work from a base of greater economic<br />
stability towards the more positive thi'ngs we should be doing<br />
and want to do. If we do not first establish this stable base,<br />
we will only be sabotaging our own future efforts. I say this<br />
to make 6lear to you the difficulties the Government faces<br />
in introducing quickly new measures to stimulate and encourage<br />
the mining industry.<br />
Could I now mention some other areas in which the<br />
Government has been active? In line with its political<br />
philosophy, the Government has taken decis~ ons to divest -the<br />
Commonwealth's interests in Mary Kathleen Uranium, Cooper Basin,<br />
the Wambo Coal Project and uranium exploration in the 3ags3iin .<br />
Uranium prospecting in the Northern Territory will re-turn to<br />
private enterprise. Previously the Atomic Energy Commission<br />
had been given a monopoly. We have been unable perh-aps not<br />
unexpectedly to find a buyer for the Moomba'-Sydney natural gas<br />
pipeline, but I have set in train a study for the restructuring<br />
of the Pipeline Authority.<br />
With the States, we have established the Australian<br />
Minerals and Energy Council, to replace the Australian Minerals<br />
Council. This Council will bring Commonwealth and State<br />
ministers together to consult on the nation's energy needs,<br />
resources and policies., as well as on matters affecting the<br />
minerals industry. We have introduced, as I mentioned earlier, an<br />
investment allowance.<br />
And we have announced, and are implementing, our<br />
policy on foreign investment in Australia. There have been<br />
comments recently on this matter which point to a misunderstancinC<br />
of the true position. There should be no misunderstanding.<br />
The guidelines for foreign investment are quite clea-r.<br />
They have been introduced to give Australians encouragement and<br />
opportunity to participate in Australia's development. They will<br />
not hinder or delay new projects if those projects are in<br />
Australia's interests. The guidelines, as made clear by Mr.<br />
Lynch when he first announced them on April 1 this year, and as<br />
emphasised by both the Treasurer and myself since, and by the<br />
Prime Minister in his statements in Japan, are not rigid and<br />
inflexible. We want, as a general rule, to see at least<br />
Australian equity in new mining projects 75% in the case of<br />
uranium. But we have made it quite clear that if foreign compan-es<br />
genuinely try to secure 50% Australian involvement in projectcs<br />
other then uranium but are unable to do so, then we will not see<br />
worthwhile development held up. A lower level of Australian<br />
equity will not necessarily prevent a project from proceeding.<br />
Of course, in such circumstances we would seek, as appropriate,<br />
satisfactory arrangements for Australian equity to be increased<br />
to at least 50% at a later stage. </p>
<p>There has never been any suggestion that the Government<br />
will apply the guidelines in a doctrinaire way. We were elected<br />
on a policy which included foreign investment guidelines. I am<br />
certain~ that the Australian people do not want to see an<br />
" 1open slather" policy on foreign ownership of Australia's resources<br />
The policy we have announced, and the method of its implementation,<br />
will give Australians encouragement to participate in the<br />
development of their country's resources, but that development<br />
will not be hindered.<br />
I have saii in the Parliament that the question of the<br />
$ 6 per tonne coal export levy will be considered in the Budget<br />
context. I have asked my Department, in co-operation with the<br />
coal industry, to undertake a full analysis of the effects of<br />
the levy on existing and projected coal operations..<br />
The sharp rise in the price of foreign crude oils caused<br />
a great increase in the cost of L. P. G. and naptha. In order to<br />
mitigate this effect, I recently decided that L. P. G. and naptha<br />
used for production of gas and nitrogenous fertilisers should in<br />
future be included amongst the products qualifying for an<br />
allocation of indigenous crude oil. By so doing their price will<br />
in future be related to the price of Australian crudes, with<br />
beneficial effects for many authorities producing town gas, and'<br />
for fertiliser production.<br />
In 1973 the mining industry lost many of the special<br />
features of the taxation system which for many years had operated<br />
in a way that was meant to reflect the reality that a finite<br />
resource industry like mining IS different from the manufacturing<br />
or rural industries. We will shortly be considering the report<br />
from the Industries Assistance Commission on the effects of<br />
taxation and royalty measures on the Australian petroleum and<br />
mining industries. It would be inappropriate to comment further<br />
atthisstage other than to say that the fundamental importance<br />
to the mining and petroleum industries of the issues involved is<br />
well appreciated in government.<br />
Communication channels open again<br />
One of the satisfying things about my role to date<br />
has been the direct and continuous communication with the<br />
industry. This is normal, and when things return to normal,<br />
rarely is attention attracted to it. However, it is a Jfactor to<br />
which I attach a great deal of importance. My Government<br />
any Government is only effective to the extent that its<br />
departmental officers can ad Vise from an informed position. To<br />
be informed, departmental officers must have a rapport with indusltr<br />
which can only come from frequent discussions in an atmosphere of<br />
mutual co-operation. Since we came into office last December, I have taken<br />
steps to re-open the communication pipelines with industry<br />
organisations and individual companies and I propose to extend<br />
this. My department must discuss problems and developments with<br />
industry, and priority will be given to such discussions. To<br />
engender this co-operation with industry, my department will be<br />
seeking out opportunities to talk to company representatives in<br />
their own environment. I know I can anticipate a favourable<br />
industry response as this can only be to our mutual advantage in<br />
the long run. </p>
<p>l T11UW_ LIY11f P11iiL_) U P1j1y U0 L 1 1) k2: : c1 I<br />
Government has been put into practice is the stance taken by the<br />
Government in negotiations whicl&gt; have taken place in recent<br />
months. Let me remind you that in the last few months Australian<br />
iron ore producers have concluded major negotiations for ore<br />
prices in Japan and Europe. Important sectors of the Australian<br />
coal industry have completed their negotiations in Japan and the<br />
remaining negotiations are proceeding.<br />
Unlike previous occasions when price-setting<br />
were involved, the iron ore producers, when reporting the outcome<br />
of their negotiations to the Government, were NOT ordered back<br />
to Japan to do better. Unlike the last occasion, the coal<br />
exporters did not find a Commonwealth minister in Tokyo himself<br />
negotiating the export price for Australian coal and incidently,<br />
in the view of the Australian producers, ' Making a mess of it.<br />
Rather, the processes of commercial negotiations between<br />
responsible Australian companies and their commercial counterparts<br />
overseas have now resulted in deals which were, in the view of<br />
those Australian negotiators, the best that could be obtained.<br />
That view is respected by the Australian Government. In a<br />
tommonsense and co-operative way, the companies and the<br />
Government discussed the issues before the negotiations took<br />
place. These two negotiations involving our major export<br />
minerals heralded a change of style and an increase in<br />
meaningful communication between government and industry. This<br />
change will permit the Australian Government to understand and<br />
help complement the activities of its exporters, rather than<br />
confront them or our overseas customers.<br />
Associated with this much-needed change of style, with<br />
the emphasis now firmly on the side of commercial negotiations,<br />
I have recognised the need to simplify what have been, for the<br />
industry, frustrating and time-consuming procedures. These<br />
procedures were imposed three years ago and have hampered<br />
exporters' efforts in shipping their minerals out of this country.<br />
In the context of minimum government involvement, my department<br />
is at an advanced stage in developing proposals to streamline<br />
the existing export control procedures. In the past few weeks,<br />
I have removed from the controls a number of semi-processed<br />
products and others are currently under review.<br />
. For those remaining minerals where, in the national<br />
interest, government monitoring of exports is vital, I am<br />
simplifying the procedures for exporters and expect to make<br />
a fuller statement on this in the very near future. Although<br />
the details are yet to be finalised by my department and the<br />
other departments and authorities involved, the objective is to<br />
reduce the paper work and administrative effort involved over the<br />
past three years of exporters having to seek ship-by-ship<br />
approvals. With these revised procedures, the Government will<br />
still carry out its responsibilities in ensuring that contract<br />
terms and conditions conform with the Government's policies.<br />
However, this will be done on a basis of the goodwill and<br />
trust to which responsible companies are entitled. This will<br />
enable exporters to have access to long-term export approvals<br />
which will fit in with contract terms and minimise the red<br />
tape and the unnecessary rubber-stamping of approved<br />
contracts every time a ship leaves the country.<br />
Although these changes are basically improvements in<br />
administrative efficiency, they do point to the way the Government<br />
is thinking and acting in this field. They will, in my view,<br />
smooth the way for the industry to get on with the job it knows<br />
best how to do. </p>
<p>So in six months<br />
* We have moved to divest ourselves of the previous<br />
Government's involvement in areas that rightly<br />
belong to private enterprise.<br />
* An initial investment allowance has been introduced.<br />
* The coal export levy and the questions of taxation<br />
treatment for the mining and petroleum industries<br />
are under study in the correct context that of<br />
the Budget.<br />
* Three major new projects in coal have been approved.<br />
* Those in iron ore have been assisted through<br />
discussions in Japan to help restore confidence<br />
in Australia as an assured and stable long-term<br />
source of supply.<br />
* The way in which export controls are used has been<br />
completely changed so as to respect, rather than<br />
usurp, the role of private enterprise.<br />
* We are working with the State Governments in the revived<br />
Minerals and Energy Council and with the West<br />
Australian Government on the development of the<br />
North West Shelf.<br />
And of course we are doing all this against the<br />
background of first getting our domestic situation in order. To havq:<br />
done less than these things in our first six months would have<br />
been to let down those who elected us to change the disastrous<br />
course on which Australia had embarked. To attempt to do more<br />
in this period, and in the economic circumstances of today, could<br />
only have been achieved at the expense of economic responsibility,<br />
or by ignoring the due processes of good government.<br />
I believe this balance signifies good government: a<br />
calm and consistent Government operating within a decision-mak-ing<br />
process of the Cabinet where the effects of any action are<br />
measured and understood in relation to the effects on the<br />
community as a whole.<br />
I would like to emphasise yet again the Government's<br />
philosophy in relation to our natural resources. We seek to<br />
provide an environment which will effectively encourage positive<br />
and concrete development to benefit all Australians. In this<br />
regard we are on the way to achieving significant progress by our<br />
broad policies on matters such as overseas investment; by<br />
keeping the industry fully informed on our attitudes; and by our<br />
commitment to what we consider to be the proper role of<br />
government that is, to encourage and, where necessary,<br />
assist private enterprise, but not to unnecessarily intervene<br />
in its operations. Again I stress that I intend to maintain close<br />
communications with industry so that together we can work as a<br />
unified team to achieve the common and worthwhile objective<br />
of responsible and beneficial development.-<br />
The establishment of this basis, of good government<br />
has been achieved within six months. From this basis the mining<br />
industry can look forward with confidence to well-informed and<br />
sympathetic government'in the years and I hope decadesae<br />
ad. </p>
