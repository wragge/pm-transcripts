TRANSCRIPT FROM DERRYN HINCH PROGRAM, 3AW, MONDAY 9 MAY 1983<br />
HINCH: I am very pleased, because this is the first morning my,<br />
program is going live to Sydney, in the 3AW studios my first<br />
guest'this morning will be the Prime minister of Australia, Mr.<br />
Bob Hawke. It i~ s 2 months since hie came to office and during<br />
that time, some would say unusually for him, he has been keeping<br />
a fairly low media profile and there are some important issues<br />
around this morning<br />
HINCH: Mr. Hawke, Good Morning. I said in my opening comments on<br />
3AW this morning, I thought it would be unusual I would sit here<br />
and use the name Bob Hawke and Richard Nixon in the same breath,<br />
but Nixon many times used the words " national security". He used<br />
it as an excuse to prevent publication of material in the New York<br />
Times, Washington Post. You are invoking the same sort of thing,<br />
of " national security". -Isn't there a big danger in that?<br />
PM: I think there is a big danger in what you are doing of guilt<br />
by association, Derryn. I have the responsibility of making a<br />
judgement, whether the national security of the country is an<br />
issue. I guess you agree that there is such a thing as national<br />
security.<br />
HINCH: Yes, I do. There's a thing called Notices.<br />
PM: Which are voluntary and which are not operative in this case.<br />
SI just assure you that there is no doubt that the national<br />
security of the country is an issue and I realize that in these<br />
sorts of things the people of Australia and indeed the rnecia I<br />
guess in particular have to be prepared to exercise some degree of<br />
trust in the judgement of the Prime Minister and the Government.<br />
I believe that manifestly the people will. in this case. I would<br />
like to be able in some sense to discuss the issue more with you<br />
Derryn and your listeners, but there is just the question of very<br />
grave issues of national security being involved. Also, most<br />
importantly, the case comes before the High Court tomorrow and you<br />
will appreciate that we have got an interim injunction and it would<br />
be quite improper to go into any detail when the matter is gjoing to<br />
be considered by the High Court tomorrow.<br />
H-INCH: I can understand that and that does limit the conversation<br />
somewhat, but issues like. border issues. If say ten years ASIO<br />
was in fact breaking into Billy McMahon's house. If, in fact,<br />
smear and innuendo being disseminated in Washington to the CIA by<br />
ASTO agents, surely now, ten years later, surely don't people have<br />
the right to know that. Doesn't the news paper have the right to<br />
try and publish that? / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
PM: Derryn, I guess you read the whole of the article in The<br />
National Times, did you?<br />
HINCH: Yes, I did.<br />
PM: Well,' you will appreciate that the questions that you are<br />
di7recting to me go to only one part of the article about something<br />
that is alleged to have been done by ASIO quite some time ago,<br />
before the Hope Report. You will remember from your reading the<br />
article that that is not all it says, by any means. It refers to<br />
current matters involving our international relations. Let me make<br />
this point, without, I believe, transgressing. The earlier<br />
restraints which I imposed upon myself, which must properly exist,<br />
let me say this, that if the allegations in the article had gone<br />
only to something alleged to have been done by ASIO many years ago,<br />
there is simply no question that we would'have gone to the High<br />
Court. I wouldn't have been going to the High Court for an<br />
injunction on those circumstances.<br />
HINCH: Are you saying that there is much more and much worse than<br />
the so-called tens of thousands of papers that we haven't seen,<br />
and presumably you have, that there is much worse in that than what<br />
The National Times has already published?<br />
PM: No, I am simply saying if you read the whole of the article<br />
that has already been published.<br />
HINCH: Well, one of the allegations, of course, was about that in<br />
Papua New Guinea and in Indonesia we had a room that could tap<br />
local conversations in New Guinea and Indonesia. There is a denial<br />
this morning saying that Australia was not doing and didn't have<br />
the facilities to do that. If that were true then the information<br />
The National Times has, is fallacious.<br />
PM: I go back to what I said in the beginning of the program,<br />
U-erryn. I am not going to talk in any detail on those matters.<br />
HINCH: Alrigh t, let's talk in a general area. If it weren't for<br />
newspapers like the New York Times and the Washington Post we<br />
would never have found out about the Pentagon Papers, America's<br />
illegal activitie~ s in Cambodia. The Washington Post this morning<br />
has a story about Ronald Reagan giving money in Nicaragua. Those<br />
things would not have come out and national security could have<br />
hidden those things, couldn't they.<br />
PM: Look, your line of questioning, Derryn, which I appreciate,<br />
seems to be premised upon the proposition that there can never be a<br />
situation in which the freedom of the media can in any way be<br />
inhibited. That there is no consideration of national security<br />
which will ever over-ride the r ' ight of the media to publish what<br />
they will. Now, I simply don't accept that. I don't accept let's<br />
take it to an extreme if you like so that we can make this point.<br />
Do you believe that ifDerryn Flinch, or Toohey, or someone else, were<br />
to publish something which would guarantee that the next day the<br />
Soviet Union would drop an atomic bomb on Australia, that your right<br />
to exploratory journalism should enable you to do that and that<br />
there is no consideration of national security which would operate<br />
to stop you doing that? </p>
<p>-3<br />
HINCH: No, I do not.<br />
PM: well then, of course you don't. Now, that means, as soon as<br />
you give me that answer, it means, necessarily, that there is such<br />
a thing as national security which at some point must be invoked<br />
against the necessary rights and freedoms of the media.<br />
HINCH: Yes, but<br />
PM: Now, I listened to you at great length. I didn't interrupt<br />
you in any way. I am simply saying to you, Derryn, that if, in fact,<br />
we do, as you honestly do, concede the point I am making, then<br />
someone is to exercise a judgement. Now, initially, in this case,<br />
I, as the elected Prime Minister of the Government, in consultation<br />
with some of my colleagues, exercised that judgement. We went to<br />
the Chief Justice of the High Court, put our view and asked for an<br />
interim injunction. Now, he has granted that. The High Court will<br />
then hear further argument on the case tomorrow. Now, those are the<br />
appropriate processes. You have got to understand that your x~ ights,<br />
which I cherish, aren't absolute. There are processes in the<br />
community in which the Government and the judiciary have got to be<br />
involved, where there is a counterbalance of interest. If we don't<br />
initiate those counterbalancing considerations which involve the<br />
security of the community and just say to you, you do what you will,<br />
then that's an absurdity.,<br />
HINCH: One which sticks in my mind, though. John Kennedy, when the<br />
New York Times got word of The Bay of Pigs invasion, the New York<br />
Times was asked not to publish it. It did not. After the event<br />
and after the fiasco, Kennedy said he wished the New York Trimes had<br />
published it, had blown it and he wouldn't have gone ahead with it.<br />
PM: I don't know what logical conclusion you can draw from that,<br />
o; ther than this. I will tell you the logical conclusion, the only<br />
thing that follows from that and that is that a Government or a<br />
leader of a Government may make a mistake of judgement. Now, of<br />
course you may make a mistake of judgement. I have said to you,<br />
during the election campaian I said throucihout, that in my time in<br />
Government I will make mistakes. I can assure you that I haven't<br />
made a mistake on this one.<br />
HINCH: Because you are accusing virtually The National Times of<br />
being unpatriotic or not being in Australia's interest, irresponsible,<br />
being these are my words..<br />
PM: They are your words and you will have to answer for them, not me.<br />
HINCH: Mr. Prime Minister, when Gougjh Whitlam was running the<br />
country, one of the thiings that people thoughtmight have helped<br />
bring him down was that he had a recalcitrant public service who did<br />
things to embarrass him Liberals in the public service who tried<br />
to bring him down. Do you believe the same sort of thing could<br />
apply here, that this material has been leaked to The National Times<br />
with your overseas trip coming up to embarrass Bob Hawke, Prime<br />
M in is ter? </p>
<p>-4<br />
PM: No, I doubt it very much Derryn.<br />
HINCH: Well, you are obviously attempting to find the leak.<br />
According to The Age on Saturday there was an attempt to sue the<br />
publisher for damages if they don't reveal who the leak is.<br />
PM: If I wasn't attempting to find the leak the electors of<br />
A-ustralia should do everything they could to throw me out. I would<br />
be grossly irresponsible if I didn't try and do that, but the fact<br />
that I am trying to find it doesn't mean, as the logic of your<br />
question seems to involve, the proposition that it was done to<br />
embarrass me. I think there may be more sinister considerations<br />
than that, but I am not going into those. The fact is that whatever<br />
the reason for it being done the process has got to be discovered<br />
as to what did happen, if it possibly can be.<br />
H Of course, the xerox machine has become the truth serum of the<br />
1980s and it is very hard to plug leaks harder than it would have<br />
been in the past and even Nixon setting up his plumbers unit could<br />
not plug leaks. It is a huge job, isn't it.<br />
PM: In the press statement I released on Friday I emphasised at<br />
the beginning that this wasn't a question of my Government being<br />
embarrassed by the fact that a document was leaked. I think,<br />
throughout the history of democratic government leaks occur. I<br />
don't get upset about a leak as such. My concern is the question of<br />
the national security and that is very much involved in what has<br />
been leaked here. What you must understand is that here there have<br />
been references to documents, of which there were, as it has said,<br />
there were only a couple of copies. This sort of thing is going to<br />
very fundamental issues. Now without accepting, as I said in my<br />
statement on Friday, the proposition that any specifi~ c allegation is<br />
true, because some of what there is in the paper is true, some of it<br />
is not and I am not going to confirm or deny any specific parts,<br />
but there is specific there that anyone, whether it was Derryn flinch,<br />
Bob Hawke, Andrew Peacock, can let me say. I briefed Andrew on the<br />
occasion of the information.' I briefed him at length and he<br />
completely endorses the action that I have taken, so, anyone I<br />
suggest, whether it was Derryn Hinch, Bob Hawke, Andrew Peacock, or<br />
anyone who had a concern for this country, would have acted as I did.<br />
HINCH: Is it true that some of the material not published was in<br />
fact critical of your predecessor Malcolm Fraser and therefore could<br />
have been to your political advantage if you had let some of it run?<br />
PM: Well, I don't know what was not published.<br />
HINCI: Don't you know what is in the other tens of thousands of<br />
pages? PM: Well, how could I. How could I know what is in the other tens<br />
of thousands of pages?<br />
HINCH: Well, I just assumed </p>
<p>5<br />
PM: That Brian Toohey had got in touch with me and said, look<br />
Bob, here is a list, a dossier. Come on, come on, come on.<br />
HINCH: Has he been in touch with you?<br />
PM: No. Of course not.<br />
HINCH: The National Times did not get a comment from you at any<br />
time.<br />
PM: No.<br />
HINCH: Toohey, of course, has been a thorn to the past Government.<br />
Jim Killen, of course, at one stage I think banished him from the<br />
Defence Department, so, do you have any personal thogghts about<br />
Toohey? PM: I would think it better that I didn't express them.<br />
HINCH: Alright. Well, if we move on from that I suppose, because,<br />
as you say, there are restrictions on you for the High Court<br />
tomorrow and, of course, the American Government lost theirs when<br />
they tried against the New York Times. </p>
