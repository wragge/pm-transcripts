Prime Minister Julia Gillard and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of Anzac Warren Snowdon today announced an additional $5 million for the establishment of an Anzac Interpretive Centre on Mount Clarence in Albany, Western Australia.</p>
<p>This Gillard Government funding will ensure the new centre is up and running by November 2014  -  the centenary of the first convoy.</p>
<p>Speaking in Albany, the Prime Minister said it was important Australians understood the role Albany played in our First World War history.</p>
<p>Albany was the gathering point for the first convoys carrying the Australian Imperial Force and New Zealand Expeditionary Force which departed from Albany in November and December 1914.</p>
<p>These troops  -  later collectively to be known as the Anzacs  -  were initially destined for Egypt for training before sailing on to Turkey, landing on the shores of Gallipoli from 25 April 1915.</p>
<p>Sadly, many never returned home.</p>
<p>As we approach the Anzac Centenary, it's fitting we remember the journey they began here on the shores of Albany.</p>
<p>Minister Snowdon said the Gillard Government's support for the construction of the Anzac Interpretive Centre was one of the recommendations of the National Commission on the Commemoration of the Anzac Centenary.</p>
<p>The new centre will offer panoramic views of King George Sound where the convoys gathered.</p>
<p>The centre will house interactive displays to follow the journey of ships that set sail and trace an individual soldier's or nurse's journey.</p>
<p>A number of these displays will also be available on the internet so Australians can access the history of Albany from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Minister Snowdon said the funding announced today was additional to the $250,000 for a scoping study and $1.3 million towards the establishment of the Centre, bringing the total Federal contribution to over $6.5 million.</p>
<p>The Government has also committed $300,000 to assist with a scoping study for a restaging of the convoy that left from Albany in November 1914. </p>
<p>The Government will work closely with the Western Australian Government and the people of Albany on both of these initiatives. </p>
