TEXT OF STATEMIENT BY THE PRIMTE 1MINISTER, M E. G. WIHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
AT THE OPENING OF THE HAV1KESBIJRY BY-ELECTION, 9 REGET<br />
THEATRE, RICH-MOND, VWEDNESDAY 31 JANUARY 1973<br />
The Statc of New South ales has just experienced a crippling<br />
and unnecessary industrial dispute involving the Transport Workers<br />
Union. The conflict involved was basically an intra-union matter<br />
which should not have expanded into strike action affecting the<br />
entire commiunity. The fact that an intra-union matter could grow--<br />
to such proportions arises from a basic defect in our legislation,<br />
a defect which has been knovm for three years and upon which the<br />
previous Federal Government and the State Government, particularly<br />
that of New South Wales, should have overcome some time ago.<br />
The recent dispute involved an application by the New South<br />
Wales union to be represented separately in the arbitration<br />
proceedings and to negotiate directly with the employers. This<br />
dispute could only arise because the State and Federal unions had a<br />
quite separate cxistence in the eyes of the law.<br />
On 25 February 1969 the full bench of the Commonwealth<br />
Industrial Court handed down its judgement in Moore v. Doyle,<br />
par of which read: " A system of trade union organisation is<br />
urgently needed which would enable the one body to represent it's<br />
relevant members in both the Federal and State arbitration systems<br />
and it should be possible for Federal and State authorities to<br />
examine the quostion whether organisations and trade unions can be<br />
provided with such a system We have decided to refer our<br />
judgement in this matter and these remarks to the Attorney-General<br />
for the Commonwealth in the hope that it may be possible, after<br />
consultation between Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General, the<br />
trade unions, both Federal and State, and other interested Government<br />
authorities to arrange for the examination of the important<br />
organisational matters to which we have referred". I should point<br />
out that a member of the court in this diecision was Mr. Justice Kerr,<br />
now the Chief Justice of Newi South Wales*<br />
Four years ago the Court referred this vital matter to the<br />
Federal and State Attorneys-General. During this period a series<br />
of committee meetings and sub-committee meetings has been held.<br />
At a meeting on 16 and 17 March 1972 the working party completed its<br />
work and definite proposals by the Commonwealth were forwarded to<br />
the States on 13 June 1972. Only four States are involved,<br />
South Australia, Western Australia, Queensland and New South W. ales.<br />
Replies were received from South Australia on 23 August, from<br />
Western Australia on 31 August and from Queensland on 8 September.<br />
New South Wales is the only State which has not yet replied to the<br />
Commonwealth proposals.<br />
The recent strike should never have occurred. It would not<br />
have arisen if the previous Federal Government and the State<br />
Government involved had not been so dilatory in remedying this basic<br />
and obvious defect in our laws. The fact that the matter is not<br />
resolved at this time is solely the responsibility of the New South<br />
Wales State Government.<br />
I have now written to all the State Premiers involved seeking<br />
urgent consideration of this basic legal anomaly to ensure that<br />
disputes of this kind will never again erupt -to cause such<br />
inconvenience to the commnunity. </p>
