J7 J, AUSTRALIA-,-<br />
TRANSCRIPT PRESS CONFERENCE SEOUL SHILLA HOTEL 7 FEBRUARY 1954<br />
FROM FILE 828/ 1/ 29<br />
FOR PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS OFFICE IN PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
E AND 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I WOULD SAY AT THE OUTSET HOW MUCH AND<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN PARTY HAVE ENJOYED OUR BRIEF VISIT TO YOUR COUNTRY.<br />
I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING VERY SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS WITH<br />
PRESIDENT CHUN AND WITH YOUR PRIME MINISTER, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER<br />
AND FOREIGN'MINISTER WITH OFFICIALS AND, OF COURSE, ALL OF MY<br />
OFFICIALS HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. ALSO OF APRTICIPATING IN<br />
DISCUSSIONS WITH YOUR COUNTERPARTS.<br />
STHE RANGE OF MATTERS THAT WE HAVE DICUSCED ARE AS FOLLOWS:<br />
FIRSTLY, THE REGIONAL SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS, MOST PARTICULARLY<br />
RELATIONS BETWEEN YOUR COUNTRY AND THE DPRK, AND BROADER REGIONAL<br />
SECURITY CONCERNS WE BOTH SHARE. SECONDLY, WE HAVE DISCUSSED<br />
BILATERAL ECONOMIC RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES AND WE HAVE<br />
AGREED THAT THERE'IS ROOM. FOR AN EXPANSION, I BELIEVE A CONSIDERABLE<br />
EXPANSION, OF TRADE BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES AND WTHIN SUCH<br />
EXPANSION THE OPPORTUNITY OF SOME REDRESS IN THE UNFAVOURABLE<br />
IMABLANCE AGAINST KOREA IN THEIR TRADE RELATIONSHIP. WE BELIEVE<br />
THAT CAN COME MOST PARTICLARLY BY KOREA SEEKING TO EXPAND ITS SHARE<br />
OF THE EXISTING IMPORT MARKET IN AUSTRALIA. THE NUMBER OF CATEGORIES<br />
WHERE WE HAVE VERY SUBSTANTIAL INPUTS, THE SHARE OF KOREA IS VERY<br />
VERY LOW INDEED. SO WE BELIEVE THAT TOGETHER WE CAN MOVE TO ASSIST<br />
KOREA TO OBTAIN SOME EXPANSION IN THAT SHARE.<br />
WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE DESIRE WE BOTH HAVE FOR A FREEING UP OF<br />
INTERNATIONAL TRADE, THE SUPPORT THAT WE GIVE TO A CALL FOR A NEW<br />
MULTILATERAL TRADE NEGOTIATION ROUND. AND IN THAT CONTEXT<br />
PRESIDENT CHUN INDICATED SUPPORT OF KOREA FOR THE INITIATIVE THAT WE<br />
HAVE TAKEN IN TRYING TO MOVE TOWARDS ARRANGING A MEETING OF THE<br />
COUNTRIES IN THE REGION TO ATTEMPT TO SECURE AN AGENDA FOR SUCH A<br />
NEW MTN ROUND WHICH TAKES ACCOUNT OF THE INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRIES<br />
IN THE REGION.<br />
NOW ' THAT IS NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE ACCOUNT OF ALL THE THINGS THAT WE<br />
HAVE DEALT WITH IN OUR DISCUSSIONS YESTERDAY, BUT THEY COVER SOME OF<br />
THE IMPORTANT AREAS. AND NOW I'D LIKE TO TAKiE SOME QUESTIONS<br />
FROM YOU.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( iNAUDIBLE) </p>
<p>WILL I BE DICUSSING IN PEKING THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE<br />
RAISED HERE IN RESPECT OF THE KOREAN S1TUATION. IS THAT THE<br />
GUESTION. YES I HAVE INDICATED THAT I WOULD IN DISCUSS-ON THAT I<br />
WILL INEVITABLY BE HAVING WITH THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP ASOUT REGIONAL<br />
AND GLOBAL SECURITY ( UESTIONS, 1 WILL BE CONVEYING THE VIEW OF THE<br />
LEt HDERSHiP : uF I HIS COUNIRY. AS I'O THE 01HER hAiTTERS IHAT I'LL . E<br />
u'IS'-USSINHG ir CHIN. A CLEARLY i, IHERE'S A BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES<br />
THERE. BECAUSE YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT AUSTRALIA HAS A VERY CLOSE<br />
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA WHICH COMMENCED WITH THE ELECTION OF THE<br />
PREVIOUS LABOR GOVERNMENT AT THE END OF 1972 THE EARLY RECOGNITION<br />
3Y AUSTRALIA OF CHINA. AND THAT RELATIONSHIP WAS BUILT UPON BY THE<br />
PREVIOUS CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT. SO IN THE COURSE OF THE LAST<br />
DECADE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IN A RANGE OF AREAS<br />
OF ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL AS WELL AS POLTICAL. SO ONE OF THE AREAS<br />
THAT WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT IS PRECISELY THOSE CLOSE BILATERAL<br />
RELATIONS, HOW THEY'RE OPERATING AND WHAT OPPORTUNITIES THERE ARE<br />
FOR EXPANDING THEM. WE WILL ALSO CLEARLY BE TALKING ABOUT REGIONAL<br />
ISSUES, NOT THE LEAST IMPORTANT OF WHICH OF COURSE AS FAR AS J<br />
AUSTRALIA IS CONCERNED IS THE OUESTION OF INDO-CHINA. WE WILL BE<br />
" TALKING ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND STRATEGIC<br />
SITUATION AND THOSE ARE THE BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES ABOUT WHICH WE<br />
WILL BE TALKING. AND I BELIEVE THAT IN THAT CONTEXT OBVIOUSLY I<br />
WILL BE REFERING T'O THE MATTERS RAISED HERE WITH ME.<br />
JOURNALIST: ABOUT YOUR DISCL'SSION'WITH THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP<br />
ABOUT THE KOREAN SITUATION, WHAT TO RENOUNCE THE VIOLENCE AND<br />
SBEGIN FACE TO FACE TALKS WITH SOUTH KOREA?<br />
WELL, I DON'T WANT TO OVERESTIMATE THE POWER OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
FROM THE TIME WE CAME TO OFFICE WE HAVE BEEN AT PAINS TO EMPHASISE<br />
THAT WE ARE A SMALL NATION WITH LARGE RESOURCES, BUT A SMALL NATION<br />
OF FIFTEEN AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE. WE DON'T WANT TO EXAGGERATE<br />
THE INFLUENCE THAT WE BRING TO BEAR IN INTERNATIONAL COUNCILS.<br />
BUT HAVING SAID THAT I THINK IT IS TRUE THAT OURS IS A VOICE WHICH IS<br />
LISTENED TO AND THEREFORE WE WILL BE SAYING IN WHATEVER FORUM,<br />
WHETHER IT BE IN BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS WITH IMPORTANT COUNTRIES<br />
LIKE CHINA OR IN INTERNATIONAL FORUMS, WE WILL BE MAKING IT CLEAR<br />
THAT THE REALITY WHICH MUST BE FACED BY THE DPRK IS THAT THERE ARE<br />
TWO GOVERNMENTS ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA AND THAT THE REPUBLIC OF<br />
KOREA IS VERY MUCH A VIBRANT, VIABLE REALITY. IT MUST BE RECOGNISED<br />
AND DEALT WITH. AND THAT THE PROPOSITION THAT HAS BEEN ADVANCED<br />
BY THE DPRK FOR TRI-PARTITE TALKS IS NOT REAL. THAT THERE MUST<br />
BE FACE TO FACE DISCUSSIONS, DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE DPRK AND<br />
THE ROK AND THAT THAT IS THE ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT FOR ANY ULTIMATE<br />
RESOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT ON THE PENINSULA. AND THAT ONCE THAT IS<br />
UNDERSTOODi THERE IS ROOM FOR PERHAPS QUADRIPARTITE DISCUSSIONS OR<br />
EVEN AS HAS BEEN SUGGESTED, A LARGER FORUM, TO WHICH COULD BE<br />
ADDED JAPAN AND THE SOVIET UNION. BUT WHATEVER THAT LARGER FRAMEWORK<br />
THE ESSENTIAL PART OF IT IS THE DIRECT FACE TO FACE NEGOTIATIONS<br />
BETWEEN THE TWO REALITIESi AND THE TWO PRESENT REALITIES, ON THE<br />
PENINSULA. NOW THAI IS THE ESSENTIAL UNDERSTANDING, THE POSITION OF<br />
MY GOVERNMENT. WE'LL PUT THAT, AS I SAY, IN WHATEVER BILATERAL<br />
DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE WITH RELEVANT COUNTRIES OR IN ANY INTERNATIONAL<br />
FORUM. JOURNALIST: MR PRIME MINISTER, YOL ARE TALKING ABOU THE FUTURE OF<br />
ECONOMIC RELATIONS OF KOREA AND AUSTRALIA. WHAT POINT DO YOU THINK<br />
WE CAN PICK UP ON. WE HAVE A DISFAVOUR IN KOREA'S SIDE OF 2 TO 1<br />
AND WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC POLICIES OF AUSTRALIA ON THIS POINT.<br />
AND THERE ARE A LO: T OF IMPORT RESTRICTIONS ON KOREAN MANUFACTURED<br />
GOODS, WHAT IS rHE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S POSITION ON THIS? </p>
<p>P. M. LET ME CL(. RIFY ONE NIISTAKE IN YOUR QUESTION FIRST, THEN I' LL<br />
ANSWER TH OTHER PART OF IT. T HE RE A RE NO--R E ST RI CT IONS 0 N PN<br />
SOODS. WE DON' f DISCRI'IINA'. E AGAINST KO" REA. TO THE EXYE\ J THA<br />
VrOST OTHER COUNtRIES IN THE WRDHV OEEE'ET FPOETO<br />
= R PARTS OF O(' UR DOMESTIC IDlUSTRIES, THE-7Y* ARE NON-DISCRIr1ILNA" ORY<br />
4GAINST COUNTRIES. SO DON'T LET THERE BE ArlY SUGGEISTION THAT W':<br />
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST KOREA BECAUSE WE DON'T*.<br />
AS TO THE c! UESTION OF HoW WE MAY BE ABLE TO ASSIST IN REMEDYING THIS<br />
IMBALANCE WHICH IS OF THE OR-DER OF 3 TO I AGAINST KOREA I' D MAK0 * E<br />
THESE OBSERVATIONS. FIRST9 YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT To SM EXTENT<br />
THAT IMBALANCE REEFLECTS THE DIFFERING STRUCTURES AND DIFFERENT'<br />
MEANS OF OUR ECONOMIES. W4E HAVE BECOME A mAJOR SUPPLIER 01--RAW<br />
MATERIALS FOR YOUR DEVELOPING INDUSTRIESs PARTICULARL Y I N IRON OR'E<br />
AND COAL FOR YOUR INNOVATED IRON AND STEEL COM~ PLEX.<br />
THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE REO; UIRED LARGE---C UAANITIES OF THOSE RAW<br />
MATERIALSi WHICH HAVE ENACBED' YOU TO DEVELOP YOU IRON AND STEEL<br />
INDUSTRY AND EXPORT AS A RESULT OF THAT's THEY' RE NOT OF ITSELF A BAD<br />
THING IN THE INITIAL IMBALANCE THAT EXIqTS EBETWEEN Us. JUST LET llE_<br />
PUT IT TO YOU THIS WAY IF YOU WANTr TO BUILD UP, AS YOU HVE, AN<br />
IRON AND STEEL QOMIPLEX WHICH IS GOING TO ENABLE YOU To HAVE<br />
SUBSTANTIA:. EXPO) RTS TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND AUSTRALIA HAVING ITS 01W. J<br />
IRON AND STEEL INDUSTrRYt THE FACT THAT WE FACILITATE THAT EXPAN\ SIO,'<br />
ON YOUR PART WHICH GIVES YOU THE OPPORTUNITY To WAVE<br />
SUBSTANTIAL EXPORTS To OTHER COUNTRIES BUT NOT OF THAT PRODUCT TOAUSTRALIA.<br />
IN OVERALL TERMS THIS IS VERY MUCH TO THE ADVANTAGE<br />
OF KOREA EVEN THOUGH IN THE INITIAL PROCESS 11T INVOLVES A<br />
SIGNIFICANT INABLANCE BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND KOREA. IN OTHER WO'RDS<br />
THE POINT THAT I'M MAKING IS THAT ANY COUNTRY MAKIING A JUDGMENT<br />
ABOUT ITS TRADING POSITIONi IT'S TOTAL EXTERNAL RELATION).\ SHIPS YOU<br />
SHOULD NOT SIMPLY LOOK AT ONE COUNTrRY AND S. AY, WELL T HERE IS AN<br />
IMBALANCE9 IF IN THE PROCESS OF ACO. UIRING THAT IMBALANCE, IF YOU<br />
LIKE, YOU ARE FACILITATING AN OVERALL ACHIEVEMENT IN YOUR EXTERNAL<br />
RELATIONSHIPS. THAT'S THE FIRST POT NT.<br />
THE SECOND, WHICH FLOWS TO SOM" E EXTENT FOR IT, 1S THIS.<br />
THAT I'VE RElIrNDED OF WIISTERS AND OFFICIALS W TTH W H ON IVE S-POK EN<br />
HERE THAT IF ' MOU LOOK AT THE PARTS OF TRADE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEE-N I<br />
AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN YOU WILL SEE THAT I N THE EARLY STAGES WHERE JAPAN<br />
WAS BUILDING UP IT'S BASIC INDUSTRIES AND WE WERE SUPPLYIN, 1G RAW-.<br />
MATERIALSi THERE WAS THE SAME SORT OF VERY SIGNIFICANT ltI-BALANCE.<br />
NOW AS THRC'UGH TIME THE STRUCTURES OF ECONOMIES CHANCElD THAT GROSS<br />
IMB. PALAN.\ CE-IN TH-JAPAN/ AUSTRALIAN TRADE RELATIONSHIP WAS DIMINISHE'D.<br />
THE THIRD POINT I MAKE IS COMING TO WHAT ARE THE IMMEDIATE SORTS OF<br />
THIN'. GS THAT WE CAN Do. WE HAVE SAI. D TO THE GOVERNMIENT HEREi TO<br />
OFFICIALSi TH4AT lF YOU LOOL( AT AUST. RALIA' S IMPORT PATTERN T;-Eh's ArfE.<br />
