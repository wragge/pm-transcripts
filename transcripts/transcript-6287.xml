VISIT TO THE MIDDLE EAST AND CYPRUS<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Trade<br />
The Hon. Lionel Bowen<br />
The Hon. Lionel Bowen returned over the weekend from a 15 day<br />
visit to Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Cyprus and Saudi Arabia. He<br />
was accompanied by a large delegation. of Australian business<br />
leaders and industry representatives from a broad cross-section<br />
of Australia's commercial interests.<br />
Mr Bowen said the mission had been an outstanding success, in<br />
that it had laid the groundwork for a substantial expansion of<br />
Australia's commercial interests in the area. " The delegation<br />
was extremely well received throughout the visit and it is clear<br />
that there is a great deal of goodwill towards Australia in each<br />
of the countries we visited. I am convinced that significant<br />
new opportunities exist for Australian exporters, contractors<br />
and consultants in the Middle East despite the contraction that<br />
has taken place in some sections of business in the region. The<br />
pace and scale of development continues to be most impressive and<br />
is now focussing on a number of areas in which Australia is well<br />
placed to pick up business. Prospects include projects related<br />
to agricultural and mineral development, hospital management,<br />
engineering work and increasing trade in our traditional exports<br />
of foodstuffs and raw materials."<br />
Important opportunities exist for joint venture arrangements and<br />
for exports of those high technology products in which we are<br />
world leaders.<br />
The Minister said he was especially pleased by the assurance<br />
from the Saudi Arabian Government of a positive response to an<br />
Australian bid for a multi-million dollar contract covering the<br />
management and staffing of hospitals at Makkah, Madinah and<br />
Riyadh. " This would be a new development in Australia's trade<br />
and an important opportunity to display Australian medical and<br />
management skills", Mr Bowen said.<br />
" It is clear that in order to capitalise on these opportunities<br />
it is essential for Australian businessmen to establish and<br />
maintain personal contact with people in the region with whom<br />
they wish to do business and, in many cases, with key government<br />
authorities." </p>
<p>He said " I believe this visit has opened many doors. There is<br />
strong interest in the Middle East in training in Australia, both<br />
in the private sector and in post-graduate training in our tertiary<br />
institutions. A number of Australian companies are already offering<br />
short-term training to people from the Middle East and I will be<br />
encouraging the further development of this, which will ultimately<br />
advance our trading interests."<br />
" During my visit I met with President Mvubarak of Egypt, the Amir<br />
of Bahrain, His Highness Sheikh Isa Bin Sulman Al Khalifa, Crown<br />
Pr'ince and Prime Minister of Kuwait, H. H. Sheikh Sa'ad Abdullah<br />
A1--Sabah, President Kyprianou of Cyprus and a number of senior<br />
government ministers and leading businessm~ en in each of the<br />
countries visited", Mr Bowen said.<br />
He stated " In Saudi Arabia it was notable that, in addition to my<br />
discussions with five Government Ministers, a very large and high<br />
level Saudi Arabian delegation attended the Second Session of the<br />
Aust'ralia/ Saudi Arabia Joint Commission held in Riyadh this week.<br />
I have invited the contacts which we have made at that meeting,<br />
together with those who attended excellent meetings with the<br />
Rivadh and Jeddah Chambers of Commerce, to follow up our visit by<br />
attending the Third Session of the Joint Commission, which will<br />
be held in Australia towards the end of 1984. The text of the<br />
JoiLnt Communique issued after the meeting is attached, together<br />
wit~ h a list of business and industry members of the Australian<br />
delegation." Mr Bowen said " Wh ' ilst in Cyprus I signed an Australian/ Cyprus<br />
Trade Agreement. This Agreement provides a good framework for<br />
the development of commerce between our two countries and represents<br />
a valuable step in the development of our relations with that<br />
country." Caniberra 19 December 1983 </p>
<p>F3OINT COMMUNIQUE OF THE AUSTRALIA/ SAUDI ARABIA JOINT COMMISSION<br />
At the invitation of His Excellency Dr Soliman Al-Solaim, Minister<br />
of Commerce of Saudi Arabia, The Hon Lionel Bowen, MP, Deputy<br />
Prime Minister and Minister for Trade of Australia, paid an official<br />
v-sit to Saudi Arabia from 7-11 Rabi Al-Awal, 1404H, corresponding<br />
to 11-15 December 1983.<br />
2, The purpose of Mr Bowen's visit was to lead the Australian<br />
delegation to the second meeting of the Joint Commission between<br />
Australia and Saudi Arabia, at which bilateral trade and economic<br />
and technical co-operation between the two countries were discussed.<br />
Members of the Australian delegation, which included senior<br />
executives from leading companies and authorities, are listed in<br />
Attachment A. The Saudi Arabian delegation was led by<br />
His Excellency Dr Soliman Al-Solaim, Minister of Commerce, who<br />
was accompanied by senior businessmen and officials from Saudi<br />
Ministries. During his visit to Saudi Arabia, Mr Bowen was also<br />
received by:<br />
H. R. H. Prince Abdulrahman bin Abdul, Vice Minister, Ministry of Defence<br />
H. E. Eng Abdul Aziz Al-Zamil, Minister of Industry Electricity<br />
H. E. Dr Abduirahnan Abdul Aziz Al-Shaikh, Minister of Agriculture<br />
and Water<br />
H. E. Shaikh Muhammad Aba Al Khail, Minister of Finance National Economy<br />
3. The meetings were held in a friendly and cordial atmosphere and<br />
both delegations expressed their sincere desire to promote and<br />
strengthen economic and technical co-operation between the two<br />
countries. Dr Solaim noted with satisfaction that a particularly<br />
healthy atmosphere existed both politically and economically between<br />
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Australia. He considered that the<br />
Joint Commission was important in bringing about this improved<br />
understanding. He stated that Saudi Arabia viewed Australia as a<br />
reliable source of strategic commodities and expressed the hope<br />
that this relationship would continue. ' Dr Solaim went on to<br />
outline the rapid development which had taken place in the trade<br />
relationship over the last five years.<br />
Mr Bowen said that the new Australian Government attached great<br />
importance to close and friendly ties between Saudi Arabia and<br />
Australia. For its part Australia welcomed Saudi Arabia's active<br />
efforts in seeking peace and stability in the Middle East, an<br />
objective strongly supported by the Australian Government.<br />
It was noted that both delegations to the Second Joint Commission<br />
were represented at a very high level. This reflected a strong<br />
desire to see a mutual increase in trade and economic co-operation.<br />
Australia hoped that new opportunities would be created for<br />
manufactured and semi-manufactured prodcIIts, for joint ventures<br />
and for the provision of Australian technical expertise to aid<br />
Saudi Arabian development projects and training programmes. As<br />
one of the most efficient producers and exporters of agricultural<br />
products and raw materials, Australia was keen to promote further<br />
trade in these products. </p>
<p>2-<br />
4. Both Ministers agreed that there was considerable scope for<br />
the development of bilateral trade in the future and the Joint<br />
Commission considered a number of specific issues of interest<br />
to both countries.<br />
Manufactured Products.<br />
S. Dr Solaim noted the growth of Australian exports in<br />
manufactured goods particularly transport equipment and copper<br />
ingots. The Joint Commission also noted that there existed<br />
good opportunities for Australian companies to produce<br />
manufactured goods in joint venture with Saudi entrepreneurs<br />
in the Kingdom.<br />
Building and Construction<br />
6. The Joint Commission recognised the strong capabilities<br />
of Australian manufacturers, contractors and consultants and<br />
the possibilities for co-operation in this area. It is hoped<br />
that contact between Australian and Saudi Arabian contracting<br />
organisations would increase.<br />
Gra ins<br />
7. The Joint Commission noted the importance of Australia's<br />
feed barley exports to the Kingdom and that a good Australian<br />
harvest this year had ensured its ability to meet the Kingdom's<br />
needs. Dr Solaim provided the background to the adjustments to<br />
the Kingdom's barley subsidy system which would lead to greatly<br />
increased imports from Australia in 1984 compared with 1983.<br />
It would also ensure, he noted, a reduction in the trade surplus<br />
at present in the Kingdom's favour.<br />
Meat 8. The Australian side expressed satisfaction with the success<br />
of the agreement between the two nations regarding the transshipment<br />
by air of chilled meat. Australia was anxious for<br />
the growth of trade in carcass meat and packaged meat to continue.<br />
The Australian side noted that a new system of halal meat<br />
cert~ ification and export controls was coming into effect from<br />
I January 1984 and that this system would contribute to the<br />
strengthening of the trade in carcass and packaged meat. The<br />
Australian side noted with satisfaction the entry of the Saudi<br />
Livestock Transport and Trading Company into the l. ive sheep trade<br />
and its facilities to carry reefer containers for meat on its<br />
vessels. Dairy Products<br />
9. The importance of cheese sales in Australia-Saudi Arabia<br />
trade was noted and the Australian side expressed its hope that<br />
-his. trade Would continue to develop. </p>
<p>-3<br />
Fruit The Australian side highlighted the possibilities which<br />
exist for an increase in trade in fresh and canned fruit. This<br />
will be followed up by more detailed discussions in 1984.<br />
Saudi Arabian Exports to Australia<br />
11. Dr Solaim drew attention to the developments taking place<br />
in the Saudi Arabian petrochemical industry particularly in<br />
respect of new products coming on stream in 1984 and 1985.<br />
He expressed the hope that Saudi Arabia could obtain a share of<br />
the Australian market for these products. Dr Solaim presented<br />
Mr Bowen with a letter outlining his views on this proposal.<br />
The Australian side pointed out the pi. resent difficult situation<br />
which exists in the Australian industry, but believed there was<br />
scope to examine areas where trade might be developed between<br />
the two countries. Caustic soda was identified as a major item<br />
in this regard.<br />
Meteorology and Environment<br />
12.. Both sides noted with pleasure the continuing progress<br />
achieved in the implementation of the contract between Saudi<br />
Arabia's Meteorology and Environment ProtectiLon Administration<br />
and the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation. It was noted<br />
that the co-operation would be renewed and extended in 1984.<br />
Medical and Health Services<br />
13. The Australian side welcomed the positive response to the<br />
Australian bid for management and staffing of hospitals at<br />
Makkah, Madinah, and Riyadh. It was also noted that proposals<br />
for other hospital projects in the Kingdom haLd been submitted<br />
by Australia. The Joint Commission also noted the successful<br />
medical training co-operation between Al Kharj Hospital and the<br />
Royal College of Physicians in Sydney and looked forward to<br />
further co-operation in the health services field.<br />
Bilateral Co-operation in Agriculture<br />
14. The Joint Commission noted that Australia was recognised as<br />
a world leader in agricultural development and research and<br />
that Australian institutions could play a particularly vital role<br />
in the education, training and developmnt to be undertaken by the<br />
emerging Saudi Arabian joint stock agricultural companies.<br />
The Saudi Arabian delegation advised that the time was opportune<br />
for the promotion of Australian technology in the field of<br />
agriculture and expressed satisfaction that the first group of<br />
Saudi farmers organised by the Ministry of Agriculture and Water<br />
would be visiting; Australia next year under an arrangement with<br />
the Weist Australian Institute of Technoloy'ls IVAITAID Division. </p>
<p>4-<br />
The Australian delegation drew attention to the holding of two<br />
conferences in Australia in 1984 which could bc of interest to<br />
Saudi Arabia. They are the International Rangelands Conference<br />
in Adelaide from 13-18 Ma)' 1984 and the Third A\ ustralian Remote<br />
Sensing Conference ( Landsat 84) from 21-25 May 1984.<br />
Mr Bowen noted that hie looked forward to a visit to Australia<br />
by the Saudi Arabian Minister for Agriculture and Water,<br />
Dr Al Shaikh, in April 1984.<br />
Standards 1S. The Joint Commission noted the central role of the Saudi<br />
Arabian Standards Organisation in the development of regional<br />
standards and placed particularl value on continuing co-operation<br />
in this field.<br />
Shipping 16. Dr Solaim noted that there was scope for the shipping<br />
specialists of the Kingdom and Australia to co-operate with a<br />
view to reducing frei ght costs. The question of vessels leaving<br />
Saudi ports empty was specifically noted by Dr Solaim.<br />
M ine~ r al1s<br />
17. The Australian side referred to the expertise and skills<br />
which exist in Australia in the production processing and<br />
uti * lisation of minerals and identified the scope which exists<br />
for co-operation between the two countri'es in regard to raw<br />
materials and equipment supply, consulting services, join~ t<br />
venizures, training and technical co-operation. Ini the context<br />
of :. echnical co-operation specific reference was made to the<br />
pro] posals for Australian assistance to the Deputy Ministry of<br />
Mineral Resources in reviewing the operation of its overseas<br />
geo~ ogical surveys. With regard to the supply of minerals the<br />
Australian side outlined the possibility that exists for the<br />
supply of iron ore.<br />
The Saudi side identified the need for significant increases<br />
in the consumption of copper and indicated an interest in<br />
obtaining increased supplies from Australia.<br />
On investment, the development and exploitation of Saudi Arabian<br />
copper deposits was raised and proposed for further joint<br />
discussions.<br />
Other Technical and Scientific Co-operation<br />
I8. The Joint Commission welcomed the discussions between CSIRO<br />
and the Saudi Arabian National Centre for Science and Technology<br />
on co-operation in meteorology, satellite data processing, arid<br />
]. and research, sand done stabilisation ind re-vegetation. </p>
