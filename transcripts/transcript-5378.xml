FOR FRIDAY 13 JUNE 1980<br />
COM: PENSATION ISSUES ARISING FROM ACTIO:; AGCAINST<br />
SOVIET UNION AND IRAN<br />
The Government has considered in detail the question of<br />
compensation for firms, organisations and individuals affected<br />
by our actions taken against the Soviet Union and Iran. Our<br />
actions in these cases have been designed to express Australia's<br />
strong condemnation of the invasion of Afghanistan and of the<br />
seizure and continued holding of the US hostages. The specific<br />
range of measures applied in each of these distinct cases<br />
has been designed to have the maximum impact within the limits<br />
of Australia's capabilities and our desire to act in concert<br />
with our allies.<br />
During the months since action has been taken against the<br />
Soviet Union and more recently Iran, Government statements have<br />
referred to the fact that compensation claims from affected<br />
firms, orqanisations and individuals would be considered<br />
symrpathetically. We have now decided upon the principles which<br />
will underly consideration of claims and the criteria on which<br />
examination will be undertaken.<br />
The essential principles involved which apply to the present<br />
case are those which have been applied in consideration of ex<br />
gratia payments by the Government over the last decade or so:-<br />
paymentls should relate to the necessary financial effects<br />
of Government policy or actions to the extent that effects<br />
are outside the control of individuals;<br />
Sthe policy or-. actions of the Government should either have<br />
adversely affected the reasonable, well-founded expectations<br />
of persons and/ or have had disproportionate effects on<br />
diff-2: et sections of the community; and<br />
offers payment should be restricted to financial<br />
con. s ces which are the direct result of Go: ernment<br />
colit.-or actions.<br />
Firms, c:.'. isa tions or individuals-which consider they have a<br />
justifie: claim should make that claim direct to the Secretary,<br />
Depart of Finance, Canberra. Claims should contain full<br />
documentation and evidence relating to the claim, and must be<br />
lodged wvithin six months from today. Where it is inappropriate<br />
to provide" final claims within that time, interim claims are<br />
required to be lodged. In addition, claims will only be </p>
<p>2<br />
consi: d er for amounts in excess of $ 1,000, except where loss<br />
to individual is demonstrated, and should refer only to<br />
total unrecouped expenditure, not including overheads, nor<br />
orofits foregone or reduced profits. Payments in respect of<br />
effect on trade will be made only where clai. mants have made<br />
ever. ffor to find alternative markets.<br />
In t-case of trade with Iran, claims will be considered only<br />
i : ect of losses incurred in the period to 29 April 1981<br />
re firm contracts w.. ere held on or before 29 April 1930,<br />
on which the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced<br />
th. t a full embargo on trade in items other than food and<br />
e. cir-e would be applied if there was no substantial progress<br />
in th-hostage situation by 17 May. He also stated on 29 April<br />
that no new contracts in such items should be entered into from<br />
the ti-. e of his statement.<br />
Further details regarding the basis on which compensation will<br />
be granted and the information to be supplied can be obtained.<br />
from the Department of Finance. A number of individuals and<br />
firms have already foreshadowed claims and these will be<br />
considered by the Government. These claimants will be informed<br />
if further and more detailed information is needed.<br />
The various actions which we have taken in respect of the<br />
Soviet Union and Iran have been carefully selected to constitute<br />
a measured response directed to specific objections. Where<br />
those actions, taken for foreign policy reasons, have directly<br />
resulted in financial loss to particular individuals or firms,<br />
we propose to consider sympathetically claims for compensation<br />
from such people. We do not wish to see particular individuals<br />
and firms within the Australian community suffer a disproportionate<br />
burden resulting from actions which the Government believes are<br />
in the interests of all Australians. 000---</p>
