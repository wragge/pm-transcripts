PRIME MINISTER CANBERRA<br />
FOR PRESS8 NOVEMBER, 19-75<br />
THE PORT HEDLAND CYCLONE<br />
I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY CONCERN AND SYMPATHY FOR THOSE<br />
WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES IN THE PORT HEDLAND CYCLONE.<br />
I AM RELIEVED TO HEAR THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO LOSS OF LIFE FROM<br />
THE CYCLONE WHICH AFFECTED PORT HEDLAND EARLIER TODAY.<br />
I HAVE ASKED THE SPECIAL MINISTER OF STATE SENATOR WITHERS TO<br />
GO TO PORT HEDLAND TOMORROW, NOT ONLY IN HIS OWN CAPACITY AS<br />
A MINISTER BUT ALSO TO REPRESENT ME.<br />
HE WILL REPORT DIRECTLY TO ME ON THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY<br />
THE CYCLONE.<br />
I AM INFORMED THAT THE PREMIER OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA SIR CHARLES<br />
COURT WENT TO PORT HEDLAND THIS AFTERNOON.<br />
WE STAND READY TO CO-OPERATE WITH THE STATE GOVERNMENT ON THE<br />
APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO RELIEVE HARDSHIP AND DISTRESS. </p>
