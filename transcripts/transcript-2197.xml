AUSTRALIAN MINING INDUSTRY COUNCIL<br />
THIRD ANNUAL DINNER<br />
Canberra, ACT 9 MARCH 1970<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
Mr. President, Parliamentary Colleagues, Distinguished Guests and<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen Thank you, Sir, for your introduction and for the generous<br />
way in which you and the people in this room have honoured the toast to<br />
your guests. I appreciate what you have said. I am sure my fellow guests<br />
appreciate it too, and if through the press of affairs, Sir, it is impossible<br />
for me to make this an annual event, at least I can assure you that both<br />
myself and my colleagues will make quite sure that it is at least a triennial<br />
event for a long time to come.<br />
Sir, although your Council has not been in-existence for a<br />
long term of years, as years go in our national history, I believe it has<br />
already made its mark on Australia, on Government, both State and<br />
Federal, and on the way in which the mining industry is conducted in<br />
Australia. As I stand here before you and see the representatives of<br />
so many companies, my mind's eye leaves this room, as I think perhaps<br />
yours can do, and instead of being here in a hotel in the National Capital,<br />
it moves away to the areas where you and your companies are operating.<br />
It swings thousands of miles North, for example, to Weipa, where, in the<br />
last war the Air Force landed on a lot of little brown pebbles, and they<br />
wondered what on earth it was; and they were landing on bauxite where<br />
there is now an aerodrome on probably one of the largest bauxite deposits<br />
in the world. It comes south to Gladstone, where that bauxite is turned<br />
into alumina for the great benefit of overseas companies: To Kambalda,<br />
Sir, this hot, dry area which has given Kalgoorlie, the city of legend,<br />
a new lease of life. Because after all, it is far more profitable to mine<br />
nickel than gold today, unless of course, you can find some alluvial<br />
deposit where you pick up the nuggets! / 2 </p>
<p>Or to Gove again a great bauxite deposit, or to those<br />
dreaming areas in the North-West of North Australia where for so long all<br />
the experts, all the geologists told us there was no iron ore; it was a<br />
waste of time to look, there just wasn't anything there. This was not<br />
entirely the West Australian Department of Mines' geologists, although they<br />
had a good deal to do with it but there to this area today, where Mt Tom<br />
Price ( with not much Australian equity) but where Mt Tom Price and close<br />
to it, Mt Whaleback have some thousands of million tons of iron ore<br />
reserves. And where a stone's throw away in terms of our national<br />
dimensions, there is the yet unexploited Rhodes Ridge with 3, 000 million<br />
tons of iron ore reserves three times as much as the two great mines<br />
I have mentioned. And where, hiding over the horizon, and known to many<br />
people, so I am giving nothing away, is Mcamey's Monster, yet to be<br />
proved, but again at least as large as Rhodes Ridge.<br />
Leaving aside altogether the deposits at Robe River, leaving<br />
aside the deposits which Broken Hill has taken up recently, we can go from<br />
here to all these frontier areas where the companies which you gentlemen<br />
represent are taking from the soil of Australia riches which were previously<br />
undreamt of an which are the sinews of our growth at present and in the<br />
future. I have mentioned but a few of the new areas being developed,<br />
the new frontiers, and what frontiers they are. Because as you go around<br />
and look at them, here are the pioneers living in air-conditioned houses<br />
provided by the mining company, with electricity, electric refrigerators,<br />
with shopping centres, swimming pools, and thanks to the benevolence of<br />
the Postmaster-General soon to be with television. What a wonderful<br />
way of pioneering that is, particularly for somebody with a memory as I<br />
have of Aladdin lamps which had to be trimmed every night and a kerosene<br />
refrigerator and later an electric generating plant of one's own which<br />
only went when one went out and kicked it. Indeed, these modern facilities<br />
are provided by your companies to see that people will go and vork in these<br />
areas. Of course in some States not all but in some States, much<br />
more than this is done. I was told by a representative of one significant<br />
company that they didn't particularly mind building the railroads and<br />
building the ports and the harbours and building the schools, but they thought<br />
it was a little tough when they were asked to build the gaol:. But they<br />
went ahead and did it anyway! ./ 3 </p>
<p>It is a little hard to believe that all this advance, that all this<br />
minerals explosion really began only some ten years or so ago. Until<br />
1960, there had been a 20-year-old ban on the export of iron ore from<br />
Australia. Indeed, our mineral exports in 1959/ 60 were valued at<br />
$ 168 million. Today they are worth $ 759 million, and before the end of<br />
this decade well before the end of this decade they will be bringing<br />
us in 000 million. What an immense acceleration in what a short<br />
period of time. And to emphasise this, in 1960, our exports of iron ore<br />
were a few hundred dollars. This year they are to be worth $ 142 million.<br />
Coal exports, ten years ago, were worth $ 121 million. Today they will<br />
bring us in $ 142 million.<br />
This is an immense expansion in such a short space of time<br />
by the companies and the enterprises that you gentlemen in this room<br />
represent. And what now? What is going to happen in the future?<br />
It seems to me inevitable that although Japan is our major<br />
trading partner now in the export of iron ore, Europe will supplant it as<br />
soon as sufficiently large ships are able to be brought in to cut down the<br />
cost of freight to Europue. After all, we have got hematite of 64% or<br />
65% 0 iron ore content and they are scratching around at 30% 0 or sonething<br />
of that kind. They have to mine it. All we have to do is to get to the<br />
top of a hill and take the hill away:<br />
And I believe, myself, that before long, the United States<br />
of America must be a strong customer for iron ore of the quality we have.<br />
If US Steel does not come out here and build its own steel plant to use the<br />
ore we have, then our ore will go to the United States in order to make<br />
steel there. It will be cheaper for US Steel to do that than to continue on<br />
the course they are now following in the United States itself.<br />
The openings in front of us, the windows on the future look<br />
on to a vista that is virtually unlimited. Let me, Sir, continue a little<br />
with the importance which I see to Australia of these new enterprises.<br />
At the end of last month, my colleague, the Minister for<br />
National Development, issued a set of new projections for the mining<br />
industry. I have mentioned the $ 2000 million of his projections. / 4 </p>
<p>Stack that up against the projections made by the Vernon Committee which<br />
estimated that mineral exports would be valued at about $ 330 million a year<br />
by 1975. That Committee based that figure on known resources and on<br />
expert predictions. There were a few people around who thought this<br />
estimate a little conservative and said it might be a $ 100 million or so more<br />
than that who could tell? And someone had the temerity to mention that<br />
it might be $ 700 or $ 800 million and this was at once dismissed as a<br />
complete flight of fancy, complete nonsense. But it wasn't a flight of fancy.<br />
It was an underestimation by experts of what we had and of what we could do<br />
with what we had and perhaps this underlines again what I have said that<br />
the future is virtually without limit. We don't yet know all we have got, We<br />
don't yet know what it can bring in for us.<br />
There is always difficulty in planning of this kind. I am told<br />
that the two best-planned cities in Australia are Broken Hill and Kalgoorlie<br />
and the reason that they are the two best-planned cities in Australia is that<br />
the roads were designed so that those using them could turn a camel team.<br />
I have got to bring this to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for<br />
the Interior, in Canberra: But whatever the reasons for it may be, this<br />
indicates that sometimes planning has unexpected results and often<br />
planning underestimates what can be achieved.<br />
Now, Sir, I have been speaking only of the mining industry<br />
so far, But what I have been saying tonight means that the change in our<br />
pattern of trade is obvious as a result of ou~ r mineral developments. Last<br />
year, mineral exports exceeded in value our greasy wool exports from<br />
Australia for the first time, and there we get another pointer to the<br />
dimension in our national affairs played by the mineral explosion.<br />
In five years' time, the value of our mineral exports from<br />
Australia should be greater than the total value of our rural exports today.<br />
And since we have grown from an infant nation to our present state, very<br />
largely if not entirely on the value of our rural exports, what a great<br />
punctuation mark in our national history is here heralded. And that is the<br />
export the overseas earnings side of the question. And I have already<br />
said that the future is unlimited.<br />
But we are talking of mining and what mining can bring into<br />
this country, and largely one has been thinking of raw materials. Not<br />
entirely, of course, because there is to be at Kwinana the new refinery<br />
for nickel, there is now for which I take some personal pleasure to be<br />
in Queensland a smelter which might well be the greatest in the world if<br />
you put a four-pot line instead of a three-pot line, as I hope you will. </p>
<p>But very largely it is the raw materials, the ore and the pellets that are<br />
being exported. But more and more, if we are to make the best use of what<br />
has been discovered, of what has been and is being worked, more and more<br />
I think we should seek to process the materials that are torn from the land<br />
in Australia. I would like to see Australia with a second steel industry. I<br />
am told there is more than one at present, but I don't believe it. I think<br />
there is one which owns some subsidiaries. I would quite like to see a<br />
second steel industry. I want to see aluminium smelters in this country.<br />
I want to see more and more processing of the materials we produce.<br />
And let me illustrate that by giving you some figures. I<br />
have been talking of bauxite. Let's look at what is involved here. One<br />
million tons of bauxite from Weipa or from Gove earns $ 5 million for<br />
export. If it is converted to alumina, the equivalent of its earnings is<br />
some $ 30 million. If that alumina is converted to aluminum, ingot<br />
aluminum, it would be worth $ 120 million, and if, finally, that ingot<br />
aluminum is fabricated into aluminium products then it would be worth<br />
$ 600 million. There really is a premium, gentlemen, on getting $ 600<br />
million or $ 200 million rather than not only a premium in what can<br />
be earned overseas by it, but a premium in the factories that are<br />
Srovided, the smelters that are provided, the jobs that are provided, the<br />
ecentralisation that is provided, if we can more and more get into this<br />
field. I know many companies are already acting along these lines.<br />
The more companies that do this the better it will be for them, and for our<br />
nation. And I believe that the gentlemen in this room would wish to see<br />
that happen and will strive to see it happens.<br />
And if it is to happen, then there is another aspect to which<br />
I think we should all turn our minds. Some of you may have heard or read<br />
that I have a view that the more Australian ownership there is in these<br />
fields the better it is for Australia. Of course we need, and nobody<br />
denies we need, overseas capital in very.* large quantities, both for the<br />
development of the mining section and, more particularly, perhaps, for<br />
the development of the processing section of which I have spoken. And we<br />
cannot but benefit from such an exercise; even if it is 100 per cent<br />
ownership, we cannot but benefit from it. We benefit because we are<br />
virtually 50/ 50 partners since we take some 45 per cent of profits in company<br />
tax. There are some companies who can minimise their profits, of course,<br />
which has some effect on this, but once they really get going and the<br />
opportunity for hiding things is gone, then we take 45 per cent, andso<br />
we are 45 per cent partners in this manner. / 6 </p>
<p>We benefit because of the townships that are built, and<br />
because of the people who are employed, and because of the taxation given<br />
us by those who are employed. We benefit because of the manpower which<br />
comes in and which otherwise we might not get. We benefit because of<br />
access to overseas markets which very big overseas companies have got<br />
sewn up and which we might not be able to enter if we didn't have this<br />
capital here. In all these ways we benefit.<br />
But having said that, and having said that we must not in any<br />
way interfere with this flow, it would be wrong, I think, to say there is<br />
no price that has to be paid for the benefits I have outlined.<br />
There is a price. There is a price to be paid in that the<br />
overseas earnings which companies make are going eventually to be<br />
diminished by the dividends that have to be paid overseas for the fixed<br />
interest loans that have to be paid off. There is a price, perhaps, to be<br />
paid, if there is too great a concentration of overseas ownership, on the<br />
refusal of access to particular markets because of arrangements made<br />
by international cartels. So there is a number of prices to be paid.<br />
Now, Sir, none of these prices is sufficient for us to prevent<br />
the inflow of overseas capital and the benefits which we get from it, but<br />
surely the lower we can keep this price without preventing such inflow,<br />
the better it is for us and for pur country.<br />
And it is for these reasons that my Government has made<br />
it abundantly clear that we look with favour on partnership arrangements,<br />
that we look with favour on overseas companies offering opportunity to<br />
Australian investors to take up equity in those companies. And having<br />
made this known, I am happy to say that significant overseas companies<br />
are taking notice of it and are, more than before, providing these<br />
opportunities. I have no evidence to indicate that having made this known<br />
has in any way inhibited the inflow of capital from abroad. I have plenty<br />
of evidence to indicate that overseas companies are offering more<br />
ownership to Australians if they are prepared to take it up.<br />
And it was for these reasons that we instituted the idea of<br />
convertible notes so that citizens in Australia who have money to invest<br />
but who must have an income to live on from that money, would have the<br />
opportunity to invest it, to receive income from it, and at a later stage,<br />
when a company became profitable, have the opportunity to convert that<br />
into equity. And it was for these reasons that we instituted guidelines for<br />
/ 7 </p>
<p>borrowing in Australia by overseas companies, guidelines which would give'<br />
to overseas companies an incentive to provide equity to Australians because<br />
the greater the equity, the greater the opportunity to borrow in Australia, and<br />
the less interest had to be paid by those who were borrowing.<br />
And now we propose a further step, and that is the setting UP ofC<br />
a corporation to enable Australian companies to compete in overseas fixed<br />
interest borrowing with the gia it companies which now can borrow overseas.<br />
There is no n.-eed to expound upon this to those of you who are in this room'--<br />
because you know it like a book. I have on my right a gentleman whose<br />
company is borrowing large, very large sums of money overseas at quite<br />
high rates of interest to develop Australia, at any rate to smelt in Australia.<br />
The other day, Hamersley had a new float and borrowed large sums of mon--ey<br />
overseas at high rates of interest to further develop Mt Tom Price. Utah<br />
is doing the same. Let us not go any further. We all know that for purposes of<br />
development, companies with complete or partial overseas ownership will<br />
borrow as much inside Australia as they can and the rest outside Australia<br />
or. their business judgment of what will best help to develop their compa.. i-es,<br />
and their business judgment of how they can service the loans they borrow.<br />
And this is made easier to do because on the international markets Alcoa,<br />
General Motors, companies of that calibre can go and establish with no<br />
difficulty their credit worthiness for large loans. What we are seeking to<br />
do by this new step, the latest in the ones we have already taken, is to<br />
establish a corporation in Australia which, by its size, will be able to<br />
be seen by those who have money to lend abroad, to be at least as creditworthy<br />
as General Motors or Alcoa, or other companies of that kind. This<br />
is so that it can, in that way, for Australian comparies who on a business<br />
judgment believe they need it, borrow money at high rates of interest which<br />
they think they can service and thereby be put on the same footing as the<br />
other large companies of which I have spoken. We believe in that way we<br />
will help preserve that Australian equity and reduce the price and we<br />
believe that to reduce the price and to protect as much Australian equity as<br />
possible is a good objective for a government to have.<br />
These steps, I think, will compleme-nt for the benefit of our<br />
nation what you geitlemeri are initiating a-id which is I am sure for the<br />
benefit of our nation.<br />
Sir, both government and industry are, to a great extent<br />
perhaps n-ot to as great an extent as the Council would like but to a<br />
great extent co-operating in the furtherance of the aims of your Cwn:-cil. / S </p>
