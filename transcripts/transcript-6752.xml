PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCHING OF " TRIPLE A"<br />
MELBOURNE, 1 OCTOBER 1985<br />
EDITORS AND AUTHORS OF " TRIPLE A",<br />
DISTINGUISHED GUESTS,<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,<br />
IT IS A GREAT PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY TO LAUNCH YOUR<br />
NEW MONTHLY MAGAZINE ON BANKING AND FINANCIAL<br />
MAN'AGEMENT: " TRIPLE A".<br />
THAT A MARKET NOW EXISTS FOR THIS NEW MAGAZINE REFLECTS<br />
I BELIEVE, MY GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES WHICH HAVE LED TO<br />
THE DEREGULATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL SYSTEM.<br />
THIS HAS, IN TURN RESULTED IN A GROWING SOPHISTICATION<br />
OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR AND THE CONSEQUENT NEED FOR<br />
SOUND AND IMAGINATIVE FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND<br />
COMMENTARY. THE VERY NAME " TRIPLE A" IS AN INTERNATIONALLY ACCEPTED<br />
HALLMARK OF SECURITY AND SOUND MANAGEMENT. RELATIVELY<br />
FEW QUALIFY FOR THIS MUCH SOUGHT-AFTER RATING. IT IS<br />
ONLY BESTOWED ON THOSE WITH A TRACK RECORD OF RELIABLE<br />
PERFORMANCE, OF DELIVERING THE GOODS. I AM SURE THAT<br />
THE STAFF OF THIS PERIODICAL WILL SEEK TO RAPIDLY<br />
ESTABLISH FOR THEMSELVES JUST SUCH A TRACK RECORD..<br />
I PUT IT TO YOU THAT THESE ASPECTS OF " TRIPLE A"<br />
PERFORMANCE ARE ALSO ASPECTS OF MY GOVERNMENT'S TRACK<br />
RECORD: A RECORD, BASED ON A HIGH STANDARD OF SOUND<br />
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT. A RECORD BASED ON IMAGINATIVE<br />
POLICIES WHICH ARE SETTING THE SCENE FOR SUSTAINED<br />
ECONOMIC GROWTH. POLICIES FOR THE PRESENT. POLICIES<br />
FOR THE FUTURE. </p>
<p>A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR " TRIPLE A" RATING IS ANOTHER<br />
TREBLE: THE TRILOGY. THE TRILOGY, ANNOUNCED JUST ON A<br />
YEAR AGO, REPRESENTS A PRECISE AND DEMANDING COMMITMENT<br />
TO BUDGET * ARY RESTRAINT. A COMMITMENT, NO PREVIOUS<br />
GOVERNMENT HAD DARE IMPOSE ON ITSELF.<br />
MANY DOUBTED OUR COMMITMENT, BUT THEY WERE WRONG. WE<br />
HAVE HONOURED THE TRILOGY COMMITMENT IN FULL.<br />
OUR THREE BUDGETS HAVE PROGRESSIVELY REDUCED THE<br />
DEFICIT, BOTH IN DOLLARS AND AS A PROPORTION OF GDP.<br />
INDEED THAT PROPORTION IS NOW HALF THE IRRESPONSIBLE<br />
FISCAL LEGAC) OF OUR NOW DISCREDITED PREDECESSORS.<br />
WE HAVE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO PERSUADE THE STATE<br />
GOVERNMENTS TO EMULATE OUR OWN BUDGETARY DISCIPLINE.<br />
THE RESTRAINT IN STATES' BORROWING HAS BEEN FORMALISED<br />
UNDER AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE<br />
STATES KNOWN AS THE " GLOBAL APPROACH", NOW IN ITS<br />
SECOND YEAR. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE HAS BEEN A DECLINE IN<br />
THE BROADER MEASURE OF PUBLIC SECTOR BORROWING, THE<br />
PSBR, WHICH HAS BEEN CUT BY [ l 1/ 2] PERCENT OF GDP OVER<br />
THE LAST 2 YEARS.<br />
WITH ONE YEAR OF SUCCESSFUL ADHERENCE TO THE TRILOGY<br />
UNDER OUR BELT, AND IN THE SECOND YEAR OF STATES'<br />
ADHERENCE TO THE " GLOBAL APPROACH", BUSINESS KNOWS WE<br />
ARE SERIOUS ABOUT RESTRAINT. THEY CAN GET ON WITH<br />
THEIR BUSINESS OF EXPANDING AND CREATING JOBS WITH<br />
CONFIDENCE THAT RESOURCES WILL NOT BE COMPETED AWAY BY'<br />
THE PUBLIC SECTOR.<br />
AND OUR POLICIES ARE RESULTING IN JOBS, JOBS AND MORE<br />
JOBS. REMEMBER THAT IN THE YEAR BEFQRE WE CAME TO<br />
GOVERNMENT 160,000 JOBS DISAPPEARED AND UNEMPLOYMENT<br />
INCREASED BY OVER A QUARTER OF A MILLION. UNDER LABOR,<br />
IN JUST 28 MONTHS, 430,000 JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED.<br />
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE HAS BEEN A COMPARABLY<br />
IMPORTANT SOCIO-ECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENT IN AUSTRALIA FOR<br />
OVER THREE DECADES. OUR SUCCESS SO FAR PLACES US WELL.<br />
ON THE TRACK TO MEETING THE TARGET OF 500,000 NEW JOBS<br />
IN OUR FIRST THREE YEARS OF OFFICE.<br />
WE ARE HONOURING THE REVENUE SIDE OF THE TRILOGY AT THE<br />
SAME TIME AS IMPLEMENTING THE MOST AMBITIOUS AND<br />
RADICAL TAX REFORM PROGRAM FOR OVER FORTY YEARS. MAJOR<br />
CRITICISMS OF THE OLD SYSTEM ARE THAT IT IS GROSSLY<br />
UNFAIR, THAT IT DESTROYS INCENTIVES AND THAT IT CREATES<br />
INEFFICIENCIES. UNFAIR BECAUSE TAXPAYERS AT SIMILAR<br />
INCOME LEVELS OFTEN PAY WIDELY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF TAX<br />
DUE TO DIFFERING CAPACITIES TO EXPLOIT UNTAXED FRINGE<br />
BENEFITS. DESTRUCTIVE TO INCENTIVES BECAUSE A CRUEL<br />
PERCENT MARGINAL RATE CUTS IN AT LESS THAN TWICE<br />
AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS. AND I NEFFICIENT BECAUSE IT<br />
DISTORTS PRICES, COSTS AND INVESTMENT DECISIONS IN THE<br />
PRIVATE SECTOR. </p>
<p>THESE AND OTHER PROBLEMS HAD TURNED OUR TAXATION SYSTEM<br />
INTO A JOKE: AVOIDANCE AND EVASION HAVE BECOME<br />
NATIONAL HOBBIES. BUT EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT IT IS<br />
NOT ENOUGH TO SIMPLY LEGISLATE TOUGHER PENALTIES. A<br />
NEW SYSTEM, W4HICH IS WIDELY SEEN TO BE FAIR AND<br />
REASONABLE, HAD TO BE INTRODUCED. WE ALL KNEW THIS; WE<br />
ALL TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR REFORMA; BUT TALK IS CHEAP<br />
AND EASY.<br />
THIS IS THE ONLY GOVERNMENT WITH THE COURAGE TO DELIVER<br />
TAX REFORM.<br />
THE NEW TAX ON FRINGE BENEFITS AS UNPOPULAR AS IT<br />
MIGHT-BE WITAt-THE FREE LUNCH BRIGADE IS UTTERLY<br />
NECESSARY IF-. WE ARE TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS<br />
TOWARDS A FAIRER SYSTEM. FURTHER, THE BROADENING OF<br />
THE TAX NET WILL BRING TO AN END THE ERA WHERE SCARCE<br />
NATIONAL RESOURCES ARE MOBILISED TOWARD INDUSTRIES<br />
MERELY TO EXPLOIT TAX LOOPHOLES, NOT BECAUSE THERE IS<br />
ANY INTRINSIC DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. IT WILL ALLOW<br />
US TO SCALE DOWN PROGRESSIVELY THE HIGH MARGINAL RATES<br />
WHICH BITE SO VICIOUSLY INTO INCENTIVES.<br />
ONE REASON FOR THE DIFFICULTY OF TAX REFORM IS THAT<br />
PEOPLE USUALLY EQUATE REFORM PROPOSALS WITH AN OVERALL<br />
TAX INCREASE. THERE IS A WIDESPREAD PUBLIC CYNICISM<br />
THAT GOVERNMENTS ONLY TALK ABOUT TAX REFORM WHEN THEY<br />
WANT MORE MONEY. THIS WAS CERTAINLY TRUE OF OUR<br />
PREDECESSORS. IT IS NOT TRUE OF US. THIS GOVERNMENT<br />
IS DIFFERENT: WE GENUINELY DO WANT REFORM AND WE<br />
GENUINELY DON'T WANT ANY MORE MONEY THAN IS NECESSARY<br />
TO RESPONSIBLY FINANCE EFFICIENT, COMPASSIONATE AND<br />
RESPONSIVE GOVERNMENT SERVICES, SERVICES DEMANDED BY<br />
OUR COMMUNITY. OUR TAX PACKAGE DOES NOT INVOLVE A NET<br />
ADDITION TO GOVERNMENT REVENUES.<br />
ANOTHER IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR " TRIPLE A" RATING<br />
IS THE PRICES AND INCOMES ACCORD WITH THE TRADE UNION<br />
MOVEMENT. FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, THE ACCORD HAS BEEN<br />
A CORNERSTONE OF OUR ECONOMIC POLICIES AND AUSTRALIA'S<br />
ECONOMIC RECOVERY. IT HAS DELIVERED A PERIOD OF WAGE<br />
RESTRAINT AND INDUSTRIAL DISPUTATION NOW AT THE LOWESTLEVEL<br />
IN 17 YEARS. IT HAS UNDERPINNED THE PRESENT<br />
SUSTAINED GROWTH IN EMPLOYMENT 4. ND OUTPUT AND SUSTAINED<br />
LOW INFLATION.<br />
WE HAVE RECENTLY CONCLUDED A NEW AGREEMENT WITH THE<br />
ACTU UNDER THE ACCORD WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT AUSTRALIA<br />
OBTAINS THE MAXIMUM LONG TERM BENEFITS FROM THE RECENT<br />
DEPRECIATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR. </p>
<p>INDEED, BECAUSE OF THE ACCORD, AUSTRALIA HAS ITS BESTCHANCE<br />
FOR A DECADE TO ACHIEVE A SUSTAINED PERIOD OF<br />
GROWTH IN OUTPUT AND EMPLOYMENT WITHOUT PRECIPITATING<br />
RUNAWAY INFLATION. AND THAT IS INDEED OUR AIM. WE<br />
HAVE SET OUR SAILS FOR GROWTH DURABLE GROWTH; GROWTH<br />
WITHOUT DEBILITATING INFLATION. AND OUR " TRIPLE A"<br />
POLICIES ARE DELIVERING JUST THAT.<br />
THE NEW AGREEAENT UNDER THE ACCORD ANNOUNCED LAST MONTH<br />
IS A SIGNIFICANT VICTORY FOR THE CONSENSUS-BASED<br />
APPROACH OF THIS GOVERNMENT, AND FOR THE CENTRALISED<br />
WAGE FIXATION SYSTEM BASIC TO THAT APPROACH. THIS<br />
AGREEMENT OFFERS A SUBSTANTIAL TAX CUT TO ORDINARY WAGE<br />
EARNERS IN THE NEXT BUDGET COUPLED WITH UNION<br />
ACCEPTANCE OF A TWO PERCENTAGE POINT DISCOUNT TO BE<br />
APPLIED TO WAGES IN THE APRIL 1986 HEARING; DELAY AND<br />
MODERATION IN THE NATIONAL PRODUCTIVITY CLAIM; AND A<br />
CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO NO EXTRA-INDEXATION WAGE<br />
CLAIMS. NO WONDER THE RECENT OECD EMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK ENDORSES<br />
AN ACCORD-LIKE APPROACH TO MACRO-ECONOMIC POLICY.<br />
NO WONDER THE OECD FORECASTS AUSTRALIAN PERFORMANCE TO<br />
BE STRONGER THAN ANY OTHER OECD COUNTRY IN 1985 AND<br />
1986.<br />
BUT LET THERE BE NO DOUBT ABOUT OUR COMMITMENT TO<br />
FISCAL RESTRAINT. THIS GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO ACCEPT<br />
THE EXTRA DISCIPLINE REQUIRED TO FINANCE THOSE TAX CUTS<br />
BY CONTAINING BUDGET OUTLAYS SO AS TO ENSURE THAT<br />
FISCAL POLICY REMAINS ON TRACK.<br />
A THIRD CONTRIBUTOR TO THIS GOVERNMENT'S " TRIPLE A"<br />
RATING IS OUR INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM. THIS<br />
PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED BECAUSE THE ECONOMY WE TOOK<br />
OVER IN 1983 WAS TOO TIRED AND TOO INTROVERTED TO<br />
MAXIMISE AUSTRALIA'S PROSPERITY INTO THE NEXT CENTURY<br />
AND BEYOND. AUSTRALIANS WANT INDUSTRIES CAPABLE OF<br />
STANDING ON THEIR OWN TWO FEET WITHOUT DEPENDING FOR<br />
THEIR EXISTENCE ON SUPPORT FROM THE GOVERNMENT.<br />
INDUSTRIES -AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES -OF WHICH WE CAN BE<br />
PROUD. SUCH INDUSTRIES WILL BE EXPORT-ORIENTED AND RECEPTIVE<br />
TO TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS IN PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES.<br />
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IS AN OBVIOUS EXAMPLE OF SUCH AN<br />
INDUSTRY. BUT IF AUSTRALIA IS TO GAIN BENEFITS FROM<br />
OUR OWN NATURAL ABILITIES AND ADVANTAGES IN THIS AREA,<br />
WE WILL NEED FIRMS PREPARED TO EXPLOIT THEM. FIRMS<br />
PREPARED TO TAKE THE RISK. </p>
<p>I MIGHT ADD THAT, IN THIS REGARD, IT IS PLEASING TO SEE<br />
THE LAUNCH OF tTRIPLE A" A NEW PERIODICAL WHICH FULLY<br />
REFLECTS THE GROWING ORIENTATION TOWARDS INFORMATION<br />
AND SERVICE BASED INDUSTRIES.<br />
OUR PROGRAM IS DIRECTED AT FOSTERING CHANGE IN KEY<br />
INDUSTRIES, CHANGE WHICH WILL BE A CATALYST FOR A MORE<br />
SPONTANEOUS RESTRUCTURING IN OTHER AREAS OF THE<br />
ECONOMY. WE HAVE ALREADY MADE AN IMPORTANT START WITH<br />
OUR STEEL AND , CAR INDUSTRY PLANS. BUT BY FAR THE M4AJOR<br />
INITIAL SUCCESS HAS BEEN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR: AND IT<br />
HAS BEEN A CRUCIAL SUCCESS BECAUSE WITHOUT THE CATALYST<br />
PROVIDED BY CHANGE IN THIS SECTOR, THE REACTION<br />
ELSEWHERE WOULD HAVE BEEN EXCEEDINGLY SLUGGISH.<br />
THE SPATE -OF INDIVIDUAL DEREGULATORY MEASURES<br />
INTRODUCED OVER ALMOST TWO YEARS BEGINNING WITH THE<br />
FLOAT OF THE DOLLAR IN DECEMBER 1983 HAS UNLEASHED AN<br />
UNPARALLELED PERIOD OF STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN OUR<br />
FINANCIAL SYSTEM. I BELIEVE THIS PERIOD WILL BE LOOKED<br />
BACK UPON IN YEARS TO COME AS A MAJOR EVENT IN OUR<br />
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.<br />
THIS PERIOD OF CHANGE IS NOW REACHING ITS CLIMAX WITH<br />
THE ENTRY OF THE FOREIGN BANKS. THE FIRST " BANK OFF<br />
THE RANK" WAS THE NEW CHASE AMP BANK, WHICH OPENED ITS<br />
DOORS LAST WEEK. SEVERAL OTHERS WILL FOLLOW SUIT<br />
BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND, AT THIS ' STAGE, WE EXPECT ALL<br />
SIXTEEN TO BE OPERATIONAL BY THE END OF MARCH NEXT<br />
YEAR. THE INCREASED COMPETITION WHICH IS ALREADY EVIDENT WILL<br />
USHER IN AN ERA OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE POLICIES IN<br />
FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION IN THIS COUNTRY. POLICIES<br />
THAT WILL FACILITATE DEVELOPMENT AND RESTRUCTURING IN<br />
OTHER INDUSTRIES. POLICIES THAT WILL ASSIST<br />
AUSTRALIANS TO GROW AND PROSPER.<br />
MONTHS BEFORE THE SUCCESSFUL FOREIGN BANK APPLICANTS<br />
WERE EVEN ANNOUNCED, THE MERE PROSPECT OF ADDITIONAL<br />
COMPETITION HAD PRODUCED MARKED CHANGES IN THE<br />
PRACTICES AND PRODUCTS OF OUR EXISTING BANKS. JUST<br />
IMAGINE THE SHAKE UP WHEN THE ADDITIONAL NEW BANKS<br />
ACTUALLY GET GOING.<br />
SUCH RAPID CHANGE IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM HAS<br />
CATAPULTED THE GOVERNMENT AND PARTICIPANTS IN FINANCIAL<br />
MARKETS INTO A NEW WORLD OF MONETARY AND FINANCIAL<br />
MANAGEMENT. THE AUTHORITIES AND PARTICIPANTS ALIKE<br />
HAVE ALL LEARNT SOME NEW TRICKS. ONE SUCH TRICK<br />
CONCERNS THE INTERPRETATION OF THE MONETARY AGGREGATES<br />
UPON WHICH WE HAVE LONG RELIED FOR INFORMATION ABOUT<br />
MONETARY POLICY AND CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL </p>
<p>MARKETS. ALL PUBLISHED MONETARY AGGREGATES ARE NOW<br />
DISTORTED TO A GREATER OR LESSER DEGREE BY THE<br />
STRUCTURAL CHANGE NOW OCCURRING: CHANGE REFLECTING IN<br />
AN INTENSE BATTLE FOR MARKET SHARE BETWEEN BANKS AND<br />
NON-BANK INTERMEDIARIES; A BATTLE TO INCREASE FINANCING<br />
THROUGH BANKS AND NON-BANK INTERMEDIARIES AS A GROUP<br />
VERSUS DIRECT FINANCING; AND, OF COURSE, A CHANGE IN<br />
STATISTICAL STATUS AS SOME OLD NON-BANKS BECOME<br />
RECLASSIFIED AS BANKS.<br />
IN ORDER FOR US TO MAKE SENSE OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS,<br />
RATHER THAN BE MISLED BY AGGREGATES ARTIFICIALLY<br />
INFLATED BY CHANGING MARKET SHARES, THE MONETARY<br />
AUTHORITIES 4RE PROVIDING MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR<br />
OWN ACTIVITI&amp; S AND INTENTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE<br />
RESERVE BANK'NOW PROVIDES DAILY INFORMATION TO<br />
FINANCIAL MARKETS ON ITS DEALING INTENTIONS. FURTHER,<br />
THE RECENT BUDGET INDICATED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE SIZE<br />
AND APPROXIMATE TIMETABLE OF THIS YEAR'S BOND SELLING<br />
PROGRAM.<br />
OF COURSE, THERE IS MORE THAT COULD, AND WILL, BE DONE.<br />
WE ARE ALL LEARNING. FOR OUR PART, WE WELCOME<br />
SUGGESTIONS FROM THE INDUSTRY. THE CHALLENGE FOR<br />
POLICY RAISED BY STRUCTURAL CHANGE WILL OUTLAST THE<br />
IMMEDIATE PERIOD OF RAPID CHANGE.<br />
EVEN THOUGH THE GAME IS DIFFERENT AND THE RULES HAVE<br />
CHANGED, THE OBJECTIVES OF MONETARY POLICY REMAIN<br />
UNCHANGED. AS THE TREASURER AND I HAVE SAID ON SEVERAL<br />
OCCASIONS IN RECENT MONTHS, THE GOVERNMENT WILL<br />
CONTINUE TO ADMINISTER A FIRM MONETARY POLICY: ONE THAT<br />
KEEPS A TIGHT REIN ON INFLATION BUT, AT THE SAME TIME,<br />
ALLOWS ROOM FOR THE ECONOMY TO KEEP GROWING.<br />
MONETARY CONDITIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THIS OVERALL<br />
APPROACH. BY ANY STANDARD THE PRESENT LEVEL OF<br />
FINANCIAL IN4TERMEDIATION IS VERY HIGH AND IT WOULD BE<br />
RIDICULOUS TO SUGGEST THAT GROWTH PROSPECTS ARE UNDULY<br />
DAMPENED BY OUR MONETARY POLICIES. YET THE PRESENT<br />
LEVEL OF INTEREST RATES SHOWS CLEARLY THAT POLICY IS<br />
F IRM.<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE TRILOGY, THE ACCORD AND THE<br />
INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM ADD UP TO AN IMAGINATIVE<br />
AND EXCITING " TRIFECTA' OF ECONOMIC POLICIES, WITH<br />
THREE PRINCIPLE OBJECTIVES:<br />
FIRST, THAT OF IMPROVING OUR SHORT TERM ECONOMIC<br />
PERFORMANCE. OF ENSURING THAT THE CAPACITY OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY TO GROW AND GENERATE JOBS IS<br />
NOT HOSTAGE TO THE FORTUNE OF THE INTERNATIONAL<br />
BOOM-BUST BUSINESS CYCLE; </p>
<p>7.<br />
SECOND, THAT OF MAINTAINING AUSTRALIA'S<br />
COMPETITIVENESS IN THE MEDIUM TO LONG TERM, SO<br />
THAT OUR CAPACITY TO DEVELOP BY IMPORTING CAPITAL<br />
IS UNDERWRITTEN BY EXPORTS AND NOT BORROWING; AND<br />
THIRD, THAT OF UNDERWRITING OUR LONG TERM<br />
PROSPERITY AND JOB PROSPECTS BY ENSURING THAT<br />
PRIVATE ENTERPRISE IS EQUIPPED TO MEET THE<br />
COMPETITIVE AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGE OF THE<br />
FUTURE.,,<br />
THIS " TRIFECTA" REPRESENTS A " TRIPLE A" STANDARD OF<br />
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT BY THIS GOVERNMENT. AND WE INTEND<br />
TO RETAIN OUR " TRIPLE A" RATING.<br />
I HAVE MUCH PLEASURE IN LAUNCHING THIS NEW PERIODICAL<br />
AND HOPE THAT IT, TOO, WILL RAPIDLY ACHIEVE " TRIPLE A"<br />
STATUS. THANK YOU.<br />
