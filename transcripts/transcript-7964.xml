4 PRIME MINISTER<br />
POft MEDIA 16 MARCH 1990<br />
Liberal-National Party public service changes would cost<br />
taxpayers at least an extra 885 million a year.<br />
Coalition public administration changes would also add<br />
another 2,900 bureaucrats to the public payroll.<br />
The extra costs and increased public service numbers would<br />
result from disputes between the two parties over the carveup<br />
of Ministerial responsibilities.<br />
The Hlawke Labor Government has introduced sweepinig reforms<br />
to public administration.<br />
Public service numbers have been cut, savings have been made<br />
in departmental amalgamations and the bureaucracy has been<br />
forced to meet efficiency targets.<br />
The inability of the Liberal and National Parties to work<br />
together would force these unneeded bureaucrats onto the<br />
public payroll.<br />
Because of their " to the victor the spoils" attitude these<br />
reforms and the savings to tnxpayern will be scrapped.<br />
In an interview in " The Australian" on 18 January Mr Peacock<br />
Indicated he favours returning to " a more traditional<br />
system" with 25 or 26 Departments, compared to the current<br />
number of 18.<br />
While he claims our streamlined system hasn't worked, hie<br />
produces no sensible supporting arguments.<br />
Mr Peacock admits, for example, that the Foreign Affairs and<br />
Trade merger has worked well, but sys he is nevertheless<br />
looking at breaking it up.<br />
From the interview just mentioned Mr Peacock said:<br />
" I think the amalgamation ( of Foreign Affairs and<br />
Trade) figs worked quite well the only one that ha;<br />
worked quite well. In fact, I'd been an oeivocate of it<br />
beforehand. But I have to say to you I nm inclinjed,<br />
norwithutanding how well it's worked, to re-32tamine<br />
whethtir it continues iti that vain".<br />

<p>2.<br />
The reason for dismantling my Government's Departmental<br />
amalgamations has nothing to do with considerations of<br />
government effioiency. It has everything to do with<br />
Coalition jealousies. Mr Peacock cannot manage a system<br />
where a National Party Minister Is running a portfolio with<br />
a Liberal Party Minister in support, or vice versa. it is<br />
this and this alone which is driving him to increase<br />
significantly the number of Departments.<br />
Traditionally, in the Coalition, the Liberals have run<br />
Foreign Affairs, and the Nationals have run Trade. They<br />
cannot break the mould, no matter how beneficial the merger<br />
has been for the country.<br />
Australia's international trade objectives must be an<br />
integral part of foreign policy. The recent Garnaut Report,<br />
among numerous others, demonstrates the necessity of keeping<br />
that linkage. And with the MTN Round drawing to a close<br />
continuity is vital. How can Australia continue its high<br />
MTN profile this year when the main bureacratic vehicle Is<br />
being dismembered?<br />
The Liberals' and Nationals wish to turn the clock back on<br />
the boldest and best reform made In government<br />
administration for decades.<br />
The prevent machinery of government changes are demonstrably<br />
working well in four key respects.<br />
First, they have reduced overlap and thereby saved as at -the<br />
end of the last financial year around $ 85 million and 2,900<br />
Staff. They are not ALP figures they are figures from the<br />
budget papers confirmed by the Department of Fina.... See<br />
page 86, attached, of the 1988-89 Budget Paper No. 1: the<br />
Department of Finance has now confirmed those figures)<br />
To undo the changes would, on beat estimates, add these<br />
costs and staff. However, It 1. s not possible to be more<br />
precise because of the failure of the Opposition t~ o produsce<br />
any evidence that I t has developed a cohiezrent plan fori Lhtt<br />
public service.<br />
As an example of the difficulty of breaking up Departments,<br />
the Department of Employment, Education and Training has<br />
amaf~ lgamated the regional offices which before our machinery<br />
ot-Government changes were separate offices of two<br />
Departments. Under the Liberal and National Parties<br />
separate networks would need to be re-established.<br />
The Department uses the Commonwealth Employment Service for<br />
delivery of some student services ( eg Austudy) In a range of<br />
locations that would not otherwise be available.<br />
All Integrated Departments now have Integi-tted m~ anagemient<br />
information systems that are very costly and disruptive to<br />
replace. The costs of change have increased considerably<br />
Since the era of the " quill pen" </p>
<p>3.<br />
These costa are not picked up in the so called * Economic<br />
Action Plan" and therefore make the Coalition's fiscal hole<br />
exceed $ 7 billion.<br />
Senond, having more than one Minister in a portfolio<br />
enables the senior Minister to concentrate on major policy<br />
and administrative issues and thus enhances Ministerial<br />
control. This benefit would be lost by splitting up Departments. it<br />
would be the reverse of the innovation and strategic<br />
thinking in Government policy Australia needs now.<br />
Third, our reforms have brought together in particular<br />
portfolios broader perspectives and more coherence in policy<br />
advice. For example, the Department of Transport and Communications<br />
arose from an amalgamation of three Departments. Previously<br />
they were lobbied by transport, aviation and communication's<br />
interests respectively, and to a large extent were<br />
' captured' by their constituencies. The combined Department<br />
is now better able to see through narrow interests and<br />
provide co-ordinated advice.<br />
Fourth, the present administrative arrangements offer much<br />
greater flexibility in portfolio operations, and reduce the<br />
amount of disruption through constant change. This is<br />
illustrated by comparing the number of Departments abolished<br />
and created and the number of transfers of functions between<br />
Departments in the Fraser government period with those under<br />
my Government.<br />
Under the previous Coalition government there were 148<br />
substantial changes in a seven year period. In the first<br />
four years of the Hlawke Government, 60 such changes were<br />
made. In the two and a half years since the new machinery<br />
was introduced in 1957, only six chnnges have bean made.<br />
Mr Peacock wants to return to the disruptive and morale<br />
breaking systems of the worst years of coalition government.<br />
Previously there were too many Departments with common<br />
policy interests competing with each other for influence and<br />
cluttering up the policy making and Cabinet processes.<br />
Thes restructuring in 1987 has contributed substantially to<br />
reducing the load on the Cabinet system.<br />
At the tine the new machinery was announced in Parliament on<br />
September 1987, Mr Howard generally welcomed the changes<br />
and particularly the concept of having more than one<br />
Minister sworn to particular departments, describing it as<br />
" a very sensible administrative change". He also spoke<br />
positively of a number of the amalgamations and<br />
consolidations made. </p>
<p>4.<br />
Mr Howard said:<br />
" The concept of having a number of Ministers sworn to<br />
administer a particular department is certainly a<br />
concept that the Opposition supports".<br />
" The old idea that one had to create a shell department<br />
in order to have another Minister performing in the<br />
Same general. area as an existing Minister was an<br />
anachronistic one. I am vary pleased indeed that the<br />
Governm: ent ties been able to put that behind it".<br />
" A number of the amalgamations and consolidations of<br />
Departments that have bean announced by the Government<br />
Ba also welcomed by the Opposition".<br />
He haes spoken publicly since that time In general support of<br />
the new arrangements. Clearly the former Leader felt<br />
himself strong enough to be able to contemplate managing a<br />
situation with Ministers from the different coalition<br />
parties in the some portfolio.<br />
In 19036 1 said I would put a stop to growth in the<br />
Commonwealth public Hervice. Since then public service<br />
numbers have fallen or remained utatic each year.<br />
Numerous scrutinies have reduced public service numbers.<br />
For exbnmple, savings of over 1. 000 have been due to changes<br />
hII Pr0C-,&amp; 8. nq of accounts, travel. the Fl rut flome Owners<br />
Scheme, and pharmaceutical payments.<br />
The Forward Estimates envisage staffing levels of 155, 297<br />
in 1989-90 falling to 149, 352 in 1992-93.<br />
Mr Peacock now seeks to reverse this trend.<br />
A~ ll because he can't control inter-party bickering.<br />
These are not matters of esoteric interest to people<br />
involved in public administration, whether as practicioners<br />
or specialist observers. They go to the heart of efficient<br />
Government and to the development of policies relevant to<br />
the national interest.<br />
The public would pay a very high price for many Coalition<br />
proposals in particular areas of policy. But the action it<br />
would take on machinery of Government would cut away at the<br />
very process of good government itself.<br />
