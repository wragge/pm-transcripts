YOUNG-LBERALCONVENTION,<br />
CANBERRA, ACT FEBRUARY 1971<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me the opportunity-of making a short<br />
apetoch , nt the beginning of the Convention.<br />
It is greatly hea rtening to a Party to see 200 delegates of Young Liberal<br />
organisations from all over Australia coming here to Canberra to discuss those matters<br />
which they feel are of importance to the Party now, and which they believe will be of<br />
importance to the Party in the future. They are matters which, in the short term<br />
comparatively short term they believe, as I do, will lead to a Liberal victory in<br />
1972, and in the longer term, will be of great benefit to the people of Australia in<br />
the decade ahead.<br />
So it is significant and important that this meeting chould be taking place.<br />
But having said that, Sir, I confess to a little disappointment at some of the motions<br />
which are to be discussed by this gathering from all over Australia perhaps more<br />
disappointment at what is not down on the Conference agenda than at what is.<br />
There are many suggestions that taxation in one form or another should be<br />
reduced, that death duties should be abolished, that other taxes should be , looked at, but<br />
there are few constructive suggestions I hope you will forgive me for saying this thetare<br />
few constructive suggestions for really tackling the major problem which faces<br />
Australia now, and yet this is that which above all else I thin:: should be engaging the<br />
minds of Young Liberals.<br />
There can be no doubt that what Australia must do first is to beat the threat<br />
of inflation which now faces it. I don't think that it faces us in a stark way as yet, but<br />
as I said when speaking to the nation, the underlying rate of growth shown in the<br />
last Consumer Price Index, coupled with the large wage and salary increases we can<br />
expect as a result of Arbitration Court and State Wages Tribunal decisions and<br />
over-award payments, make it necessary to ensure that the underlying threat does not<br />
become a real threat. For if it does, then we inside Australia will be the poorer, all<br />
of us. We will not be able to build the number of schools, the number of hospitals, the<br />
number of public amenities which we otherwise would be able to build.<br />
-For if you have a school which is estimated to cost let us say, half a million<br />
dollars and because of direct wage costs and because of indirect costs then the same<br />
school, the same size, the same quality, turns out to cost $ 700, 000, we wilt not be<br />
able to build the same number of school and tht is self-evident. Unlress, of<br />
course, we so mulct, we so ax iL.-private sector in Australia that it loses all incentive<br />
to produce those things on which ultimately the public sector depends. So this inside<br />
Australia is an immense threat to u3; outside it threatens . hat export programme<br />
which is now so well under way in manufactured go. Ils. It poses ' ragc choices to the<br />
primary producer and it bears down immediately and heavily on the pensioner, on the<br />
retired man who is not a pensioner and who is too ofaen thought about too little. / 2 </p>
<p>So this, I believe, is one of the significant the most significant first task<br />
which we have before us. I hope you will discuss this, and I hope you will put your<br />
views as to how this should best be attacked at the root.<br />
There are some things which one can do which ameliorate, which take away<br />
some off the causes, some of the causes in some of the areas where the pressure of<br />
demand is growing most. But what we need is a community agreement of those who<br />
earn wages, who earn salaries, who pay wages, who pay salaries, who consume that<br />
while there is a need and a requirement to increase the living standards of all by<br />
increasing the true wages of all, and that while that must and will be the requirement<br />
of a Liberal Government, yet if one seelks to go too fast and raise wages at a greater<br />
rate than production, then one is self-defeating and doing no good to anybody in<br />
Australia. Well, as you know, we are talking steps in this direction, not the least<br />
being steps let us call them self-denying steps in reducing tile public sector<br />
expenditure that the Commonwealth is to make, And we are also taking steps to see<br />
that State expenditure also does not grow and is reduced.<br />
You often hear this is by way of a parenthesis you often hear attacks<br />
on Commonwealth spending. You read it in leading articles ( Interjection It is<br />
on the agenda:) Well when the matter on the agenda is being discussed, I do hope<br />
that there will be many here who realise that Commonwealth spending at least as<br />
to approximately one-third of the total is not Commonwealth spending at all but State<br />
spending, because it is reflected in the grants, the reimbursemnent grants made to<br />
the States and by the direct purpose grants made to the States.<br />
Too often, and this is really the only point I wish to make, people forget<br />
when talking of the volume of Commonwealth spending, and how it has grown, that in<br />
fact a third of it is not actually Commonwealth spending at all, but the sort of spending<br />
that so many State branches so often say should be increased. The figures, no doubt,<br />
you will all have at your fingertips: But in both these areas, steps are being taken<br />
now. And on the question of reducig the amount which the Commonwealth would<br />
otherwise have spent for its own purposes not for State purposes in this year, there<br />
will be an announcement very shortly showing a significant reduction in what would<br />
otherwvise have been spent. I emphasise " in what would otherwise have been spent"<br />
b ecause while we brought in a Budget at the beginning of this year, we have since<br />
been faced with an increase-of approximately $ 110 million as a result of wage and<br />
salary determinations by the Arbitration Court and by the Commonwealth Public<br />
Service Board. We have been faced with the decision of one of the Houses of Parliament<br />
that during this year the money for the States Receipts Tax should be made available<br />
to the States without there being a tax, and various other costs rising as a result of<br />
increases in costs of materials. / 3 </p>
<p>But that being so, there-will stll-be a very considerable. reduction in<br />
Commonwealth spending, and this has., 1 believe-two advantages, I hope you would<br />
agree with me. One, it does show that we are in; earnest when we talk about the<br />
need to tackle this problem, and, two, it does leave for the private sector more<br />
chance-to get labour and materials for the purposes of the private sector which<br />
again and let us not forget it is that sector from which public spending ultimately<br />
must come. So these will be matters for your concern and your recommendation<br />
and your advice. And other ira tters pale into Borne insignifican~ ce until this is dore<br />
But I hope that we will not let ourselves be swayed by what I think is the<br />
entirely fallacious argument put forward by the ACTU. That is, that wages and salaries<br />
have no effect, or very little effect at all on rises in prices. fLaughter). The<br />
only I know it is almost laughable, but it is seriously put. The only way in<br />
which that could ever be true would be if the additional cost to a manufacturer of rises<br />
in prices and salaries were entirely taken out of the profits that manufacturer was<br />
making. That is the only possible way in vii ich this could happen.<br />
Yet manufacturers and our big firms are not making. excessive profits.<br />
We look at a newspaper and we see a profit for BHP, let us say, which is an enormous<br />
aggregate amount of money. But when you check what the returns on the funds invested<br />
are, you will find, in the form of that company, it is about 6_ 2 ner cent. And you<br />
cannot expect people to invest in this kind of growth in this kin~ d of company at much<br />
less than 6 per cent, If they have saved it, then we believe they should get a proper<br />
benefit from investing it. While I wouldn't undertake to say exactly what a proper<br />
benefit is, I am quite sure that if you look at the returns of our major companies<br />
on funds invested, you will not think they are excessive. And, indeed, if some<br />
organisations, some opposition were to seek to attack these further, then I believe<br />
the danger to Australia would be that people would stop investi-ng in such companies,<br />
that they would look for an easier way to earn their money, that they would go into<br />
tertiary industries, service industries, some other way which ira de it easier and less<br />
destructive and less distracting.<br />
So these are again all matters for your consideration. They will be, I have<br />
no doubt, debated at great length in the Parliament when it meets, and I hope wAth some<br />
benefit. But in overcoming, we will do as we have already done, one or two unpopular<br />
things. I hope that all the Liberal Party and all the Young Liberals will realise<br />
the necessity for such unpopular things and will realise that a transient unpopularity is<br />
as rnflhing compared wm the popularity which would flow to a government which<br />
successfully overcame the problems now before it and,, more importantly than t hat,<br />
is as nothing to the benefit which would flow to the country from such action by such<br />
a government. Sir, you told me to speak for ten minutes or so, and this I have done.<br />
You did indicate that you would like me to speak on the Commonwealth Conference<br />
at Singapore, but there is little more to say on that. I think you have all read about<br />
it and heard . aebout it, may have seer. me speaking on TV about it. It would be<br />
rather a rehash, I think, if I were to sliend any time on this other than to say one<br />
thing. / 4 </p>
<p>The Commonwealth of Nations, in my view, wilil only survive if all those<br />
in it accept the fact that it is not an organisation which can pass any resolutions<br />
binding on all its members, that it should not try to do this, that it should not claim<br />
a consensus binding on all its members, but should continue to be a loose voluntary<br />
organisation, spending most of its time on those areas in which it can agree, rather<br />
than seeking to become a small United Niations. This 1 have said before, ard this<br />
I think I will not labour now.<br />
So, Sir, having put before the Young Liberals what I think the major<br />
problem in Australia is today, I now leave them to debate. May I make this plea?<br />
If people are to come from as far as you have come, many of you, if you<br />
are to debate motions of significance to Australia's future, then it is essential<br />
that you should debate them with knowledge and with facts and Seek to arrive at<br />
a conclusion through discussion, not seek to impose a conclusioin through having<br />
made up your mind before you start. J say this because,, again, in this agenda, there<br />
are matters such as people saying that Australia has not attempted tozaise an<br />
Army by other than National Service. This is not so. 1 am sure there will be people<br />
here who will know it is not so and will be able to argue about it. And, similarly,<br />
there are other matters of the kind.<br />
But looking at the second point on the agenda<br />
" That his Convention calls u~ ion the Federal Liberal Government<br />
to emulate the policies of the British Conservative Government to<br />
substantially curb public expenditure"<br />
I'm not sure about the social services, I will put that aside,,-<br />
" and limit expenditure to all Government Departments to stop the<br />
uncontrolled growth of bureaucracy"<br />
I can only say, Sir, that I must have had a little prescience before this was put<br />
on the Agenda. This was something likze the prescience I apparently had when I<br />
got a telegram from Bert Kelly saying " We urge you strongly to export the rams"<br />
and they went that night!<br />
Sir, I now declare this Conference of tie Young Liberals to be open. </p>
