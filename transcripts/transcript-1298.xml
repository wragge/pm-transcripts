PRD'hE 11INISTER'S TOUR OF SOUTH-EAST ASIA<br />
Statement distributed by the Prime Minister J~<br />
at Press Conference in Saigon. Vietnam APRIL, 1966<br />
This morning sees the conclusion of my official visit<br />
to Vietnam. Later today I visit Ubcn in Northern Thailand where<br />
an Australian Air Force squadron is stationed.<br />
From there I go to Bangkok, and subsequently to<br />
various centres where Australian forces are serving in Malaysia<br />
and Singapore. I am deeply appreciative of the welcome which has been<br />
given to me in Vietnam and of the many evidences of friendship and<br />
warm feeling for Australia which I have experienced.<br />
I have had informative and useful exchanges of views<br />
with the Chairman of the National Leadership Committee, the Prime<br />
Minister and other Vietnamese leaders, as well as with Australian,<br />
United States and other officials.<br />
These contacts, together with the observations I have<br />
been able to make in visits to military and other establishments,<br />
have given me a closer insight into the situation in Vietnam and<br />
into current problems.<br />
Miy conclusions and assessments have strongly confirmed<br />
the earlier judgments on which we have based our policies.<br />
As Prime M1inister of Australia I was able in person to<br />
convey to the Vietnamese Government the admiration and support of<br />
the Government and people of Australia for the South Vietnamese<br />
people in their struggle to preserve their national independence.<br />
Our support for the Republic of Vietnam has included<br />
moral support, international political and diplomatic support, as<br />
well as military and economic assistance.<br />
We, of coairse, have a great interest in the effort of<br />
Vietnam to achieve internal stability.<br />
At the same time, we comprehend that this is no easy<br />
task, and the Government and people of Vietnam may be assured<br />
of our undcrstanding and awareness of the difficulties they face.<br />
This country has for years been under Communist attack<br />
systematically designed to destroy the growth of its institutions<br />
and its structure of administration.<br />
The Republic of Vietnam also has faced great : problems<br />
after the end of colonialism in bringing about national stability<br />
and cohesion. But the will to resist Communist aggression and to<br />
prevent Communist domination is common to all the different<br />
elements othe~ r than the Viet Cong and its so-called liberation<br />
front. </p>
<p>This has been a constant factor throughout a period<br />
of political change.<br />
I have discussed the military situation with the most<br />
senior military and diplomatic figures in the Government, the United<br />
States representation and that of Australia.<br />
All have confidently expressed the view that the<br />
military threat can be successfully dealt with.<br />
There are political difficulties which all recognise.<br />
The task of the United States and Australia and of<br />
other allied countries is to help resist the aggression and ensure<br />
the security of the country while it establishes the basis for an<br />
enduring stability. The aspirations of the Vietnamese people are the same<br />
as those of many other newly independent countries of South and<br />
South-East Asia, namely the right to the full and free exercise,<br />
of sovereignty and national independence.<br />
Each has the right to the forms of Government and<br />
society of its choice and to develop its own approach to the<br />
problems of economic and social developmcnt.<br />
In resolutely waging its own struggle for freedom,<br />
South Vietnam is making a major contribution to the security of<br />
the whole region. The problems of security and development are, of course,<br />
interdependent. Efforts to provide and preserve security by military<br />
means nced to be complemented by muasures designed to raise<br />
stndard~ s of living.<br />
It was with particular interest, therefore, that I<br />
have learned about the Vietnamese Government's revolutionary<br />
development programme.<br />
This is designed to counter the Communist threat to<br />
the villages by providing protection and building a better life<br />
for the pcople in rural areas.<br />
Yesterday morning I visited the revolutionary<br />
development cadre training centre at Vung Tau where teams are being<br />
give n comprehensive training for these tasks.<br />
I was most impressed by the dodication of the<br />
instructing staff and the thoroughness and realism of their<br />
training programmlae. Of special intuercst for me, of course, have been the<br />
visits to Australian military and civilian personnel Sc~ rving in<br />
Vietnam and the discussions I've had with them.<br />
Our present force is small but it is a-highly trained<br />
and effective force, which includcs a body of instructors working<br />
directly with the Vietnamese Armed Forces importing their knowledge<br />
and skills to imiprove the ? Ãµ erformiance of thousands of others. </p>
