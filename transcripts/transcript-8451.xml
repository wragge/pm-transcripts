DOORSTOP, ' LET'S GO AUSTRALIA' LIFE BE IN IT CAMPAIGN, MCG,<br />
MELBOURNE, 11 MARCH 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: I don't know whether you might have seen him, but Ian<br />
Botham is training with the rest of the squad down on<br />
the ground. Do you have a mind to go out and discuss<br />
certain matters with him?<br />
PM: I'll sen~ d Norm down to see him, he's about his weight.<br />
J: YesterdEay Dr Hewson accused you of phoney jingoism. Is<br />
that what we've been hearing?<br />
PM: Well, the thing about " Let's Go Australia", the thing<br />
about this campaign, it is about getting away from the<br />
negative! s. And Life Be In It, I think, has chosen the<br />
right theme for this year, " Let's Go". There's nothing<br />
to hold this country back. Basically we can come out<br />
of the recession into a recovery, and see the place go<br />
into a better decade than perhaps we've had for a long<br />
time. So, there's much to be cheerful about, including<br />
pride in ourselves. If Dr Hewson thinks that's<br />
jingoism, that's his problem.<br />
J: What do you do to keep fit, Mr Keating?<br />
PM: Well I ( lid 25 laps of the Lodge pool this morning. I<br />
was ' be: Lng in it'!<br />
J: How often do you do that?<br />
PM: Every day or so, if I can do it.<br />
J: Is fitness important to the economy, then?<br />
PM: Well it's important to keep the old respiratory system<br />
moving, to keep the blood circulating, keep the mind<br />
sharp. 49. </p>
<p>J: Do you think on the issue of sport, that perhaps<br />
Australians concentrate too much on sport and not<br />
enough on business, on the economy?<br />
PM: Oh no. We've got a nice mix, we've got a good mix in<br />
this country. We have a nice balance between what's<br />
sensible and good for us, what's serious. And we've<br />
built all this ourselves in 200 years, what we see is<br />
what's been built by only a few generations. So we<br />
have had it together for a long time, and we can keep<br />
it together.<br />
J: You said this country was on cruise during the 1980s,<br />
does that include the Government?<br />
PM: No, the country was in the Rip Van Wrinkle years in the<br />
and ' 60s and early ' 70s, and I think it probably<br />
got on the cruise in the ' 80s, and we've now in the<br />
late ' 80s and early ' 90s got it focussing on the need<br />
to be competitive, the need to nurture our growth<br />
resource our people, our kids to produce innovative<br />
products, to sell them to the world, and to understand<br />
the quality of our lifestyle here, and to preserve it.<br />
These are the things, I think, we have to be clear<br />
about to make a success of in the ' 90s pulling it all<br />
together, getting Australia moving, getting Australia<br />
cracking.<br />
J: It has been reported that you are going to visit<br />
Indonesia, do you have<br />
PM: I'll do questions to all that stuff later. OK.<br />
