PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP,<br />
OFFICIAL OPENING OF KURILPA PARK, SOUTHBANK, BRISBANE<br />
THURSDAY 27 OCTOBER, 1994<br />
Well. I'm delighted to be here on this occasion, but most particularly to have<br />
been able to have joined with Brisbane City Council in doing some of the<br />
things that we thought we could do together during the worst of the recession,<br />
to provide some hope and some value to young people, in particular, who<br />
were unemployed or long term unemployed, over the course of the recent<br />
past. And, it's not really part of one's experience that city councils take on<br />
with such fervour, with such a sense of decency and humanity, the interests<br />
of young people in particular and even mature aged unemployed people, to<br />
find tasks for them that lift their self esteem, give them a place in the scheme<br />
of things and, as an end result, achieve something on the way for the city and<br />
the people.<br />
And, this has happened and the collaboration between the Commonwealth<br />
and the City Council has been a matter of great pleasure to me. And, I<br />
congratulate the Lord Mayor on taking this initiative. Because, it's one thing<br />
for the Commonwealth to have the money to do some of these things... we<br />
can't do it unless there is the help and assistance on the ground, the sense of<br />
ambition, locally, for these things to happen. And, I'm delighted to say that<br />
we've seen it with Brisbane City Council. What we have seen here is, I am<br />
sure, just another, further manifestation of the concentration on the river<br />
which we are seeing in Brisbane in recent years certainly since Expo'<br />
some years ago. I think, now, most people in Brisbane regard the river as a<br />
major asset where I'm not sure this would have been true all that many years<br />
ago. And, Kurilpa Park is going to be a further asset to the river and a place<br />
of solace for people to come because cities need some open space and<br />
some breathing space and this is a bit of breathing space another part of<br />
the lung of the city. And, it wouldn't be here without the efforts of these<br />
young people.<br />
The Lord Mayors statistics, I think, are pretty impressive. That is, the<br />
number of trees put into place, the tonnage of garbage which has been taken<br />
away, the lawns, the stonework, the footpaths... all employing, over the<br />
course of it. 2000 people, 700 of whom have found full time employment. So, 2821 </p>
<p>it's a pretty successfui strike rate when one is considering that the young<br />
people mainly young people involved here are amongst the longer term<br />
unemployed. And, that sort of work experience is terrific for them, it makes<br />
the community feel good about itself, but most importantly it makes them feel<br />
good about themselves.<br />
The Lord Mayor was kind enough to congratulate the Government on the<br />
White Paper and I think the White Paper is one of those things... I was saying<br />
last night the attention span of the media is so short these days. When I first<br />
went into Parliament 25 years ago stories would be developed in the print<br />
media and would then be picked up by television. Something like the White<br />
Paper would go for weeks, people trying to digest it. Now, the reverse is the<br />
case; television picks it up for a night, you get a one day follow-up in the print<br />
the next day and that's the end of it. Done. Now, we're still building the<br />
White Paper and I see Neville Bonner has joined us I have just been at<br />
ACOSS where he was present, this morning, saying that we are going to be<br />
case managing 560,000 people this year. We're setting up in what is a world<br />
first, a system of case management where an individual person will be<br />
relating to an unemployed person, unemployed 12 months or more, and<br />
understanding their aptitudes, their educational qualifications, what they'd<br />
like to do and getting a plan in place and a subsidy to get them back into<br />
work. So, you can imagine setting up a system where we are actually, personally<br />
case managing over half a million people. It is going to be an enormous<br />
challenge. But, one that will mark this society out from other comparable<br />
countries where we will not have, and will not accept that 300,000 people<br />
should go on the labour scrap heap while the rest of us move off to<br />
prosperity; that we will keep the country as one, inclusively, inclusive and<br />
together and that we will get the longer term unemployed people back into<br />
mainstream jobs. Now, we've already had tremendous success in the last<br />
year; since the election 413,000 jobs have been created in this country. We<br />
were heading for a target of half a million over three years, we're four fifths of<br />
the way in two thirds of the time, or just over half the time.<br />
But, importantly, 80,000 of the 400,000 jobs have gone to the long term<br />
unemployed. If you were looking at 400,000 jobs in the eighties, that 80.000<br />
would be more like 15,000 or 20,000. So, out of 400,000 jobs, 15,000 or<br />
20,000 might have gone to the long term unemployed. This time, out of<br />
400,000, there are 80,000 which have gone to the long term unemployed so<br />
we are really starting to get them back into the mainstream of the labour<br />
market. And, as the economy picks up and grows and as we bring more<br />
growth to the labour market, hopefully, we'll really start chopping that long<br />
term unemployment back.<br />
The other great thing about the White Paper is that we're saying that we will<br />
not let any person, any young person under the age of 18, slip through the<br />
system. If someone drops out of education we will case manage them back<br />
into it. And, if not into mainstream education secondary education into<br />
TAFE, and if not into TAFE into a subsidised workplace and on the job<br />
2822 </p>
<p>training. In other words we just won't let somebody leave at age 16 and,<br />
basically, drop out. We're going to try and get them back in because I think a<br />
country which does not care about its young people is not a country with a<br />
future. It is as simple as that. So, this is very important to us and the<br />
innovation that we had in there we're now starting to stream kids in years<br />
11 and 12, the last years of secondary school, into TAFE accreditation so<br />
they can actually get their career path set in years 11 and 12 and do things in<br />
secondary school which give them accreditation for TAFE, thereafter.<br />
So, you might ask what this has got to do with the park? They are all a<br />
common theme. That is, we won't leave the unemployed behind<br />
particularly the young unemployed and whether it is work experience under<br />
JOBSKILLS, LEAP or the other labour market programs in the White Paper,<br />
they are things that, I think, a country as wealthy as this should commit itself<br />
to. Now, one may say, " Well, that's entirely reasonable", but not many<br />
people were sticking their hand up in the depths of the recession saying,<br />
' Well, look, we'll take young people on, we'll put our own money in and we'll<br />
do it." Now, Jim Soorley did this and so did his council and we'll be forever in<br />
their debt for it. And, the young people who have got those jobs, whose lives<br />
have been restored will be in their debt. And what pnice? The product of 700<br />
jobs in the economy versus the cost of 700 unemployed people. The obvious<br />
benefit in terms of product of having those people engaged compared to<br />
being unengaged is, of course, manifest. So, not only have they been taken<br />
up but they produced quite a wonderful change in an area such as this and<br />
when this gets to maturity and those trees get larger and it gets a bit of patina<br />
about it, this will be a very lovely space for the city.<br />
And, I'm actually delighted with the way Brisbane is changing. There is<br />
tremendous growth behind Brisbane now, as one of the growth capitals of the<br />
country. The fact that it has a greater Brisbane Council area and is not<br />
broken up by small municipalities means that there can be city planning and<br />
you have a Lord Mayor who understands the potential of Brisbane, the<br />
demands which will be placed upon its infrastructure in the future, and how it<br />
can, with the growth and particularly its temperate climate and its<br />
relationship with the Asia Pacific become a very significant part of<br />
Australia and one where we can do some things with city planning that will<br />
make Brisbane one of the beautiful places in this country. One of the great<br />
joys to me is some of the worst architecture of the sixties and seventies<br />
and we've got more than our liberal spread of it right around the<br />
Commonwealth: there's a great dollop of it here, of course, in Brisbane it<br />
will be mulched in because the sites are more valuable than the buildings.<br />
So, we get a second crack at it. That is something which I think is going to be<br />
terribly good for Brisbane. I was delighted with the Commonwealth Law<br />
Courts just across the river there, that we've been able to add a quality bit of<br />
architecture to the city and a lot of the packing case rubbish which surrounds<br />
it will go as the years go on. And, we'll be able to build some decent<br />
buildings along the river front here and maybe get the height limitations right<br />
and make this a very lovely city. 2 823 </p>
<p>4<br />
At least. I think, we'd like to be involved, with Better Cities to see the<br />
Commonwealth involved with some of these things, which we are now, of<br />
course, in the greater Brisbane area and to see a partnership between the<br />
government of Queensland and the Commonwealth in doing these things, but<br />
in a tripartite relationship with the Council of greater Brisbane. So, there is, I<br />
think, a great optimism about Queensland, a great sense of opportunity, of<br />
the future and a sort of civic pride returning to the place where it is not just<br />
simply a developers' melee but, where the public interest gets a look in<br />
and there is an understanding that there is a greater interest in doing it right.<br />
I certainly salute the Lord Mayor's efforts in this respect.<br />
So, could I thank everyone associated with today, with this project, but more<br />
particularly with the JOBSKILLS and LEAP projects around Brisbane and for<br />
the many people involved in the supervision and design of these projects.<br />
But, most particularly, to those unemployed people who have joined them,<br />
who have benefited from them and who have given something back to the city<br />
as they go off then into permanent employment. And, those who are<br />
unemployed, we'll be case managing them back into a job and back into<br />
training. So, again, congratulations Jim, on a job really well done and I am<br />
delighted that my colleagues and I could be here on this occasion to declare<br />
Kurilpa Park open. Thankyou.<br />
ends.<br />
