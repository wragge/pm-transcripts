AUS A&amp;<br />
FOR PRESS 14 MAY 1978<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The barbaric murder of former Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro<br />
condemned by free people and freedom loving people tnroughout<br />
the world serves as an ugly reminder ot the modern threat<br />
to democracy.<br />
The kidnapping and assassination came at a time when Aldo Moro<br />
had been seeking a consensus throughout the Italian community.<br />
He sought nothing more than the unification of his people<br />
and his nation. The murder of Moro was not just the murder of<br />
one man it was another serious attack aimed directly at<br />
the heart of democracy.<br />
The evil of terrorism in any form must be opposed with all the<br />
vigour at the command of governments everywhere. Free countries<br />
need to reinforce each other in making sure that opportunities<br />
available to terrorists are shut out.<br />
It is clear that political terrorism will remain with us, and<br />
may come to pose even more serious threats to our open society,<br />
our values and our way of life.<br />
Terrorism comes in many forms. There are people who resort to<br />
terror to obtain money or the release of prisoners, or as a<br />
means of bringing about violent and revolutionary change in<br />
society. This kind of terrorist seeks to discredit legitimate<br />
governments by using terror to destroy the consensus between<br />
government and people on which open societies depend.<br />
The terrorist rejects the right of others to hold contrary views:<br />
rejects the rule of law and rejects the values of tolerance<br />
and democracy.<br />
The terrorist is without scruple. He is an extremist, ready to use<br />
any means, and impervious to criticism or restraint. The<br />
terrorist believes no-one is entitled to personal security,<br />
personal liberty or any other form of civil right.<br />
The Australian Government's views on terrorism have been firmly<br />
stated. They are made without qualification, without quibble.<br />
We will not appease those elements in the community who conspire<br />
by acts of terrorism to deny our people their rights, self-respect<br />
and dignity. We will not succumb to the tyranny of self-app~ ointed<br />
minorities who seek to inflict their will on the great majority<br />
of our people by intimidation, violence and terrorism. We will<br />
not permit Australia to be used as a haven for terrorist groups<br />
to plan and conduct operations abroad. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Australia is actively playing an international role to<br />
help combat the evil of terrorism. We are a party to all<br />
major international conventions to combat terrorism. We<br />
support the International Atomic Energy Agency's proposal<br />
for a Convention aimed at strengthening measures against<br />
any crimes involving nuclear material or facilities.<br />
We are supporting the proposal by the Federal Republic of<br />
Germany for an international convention on the taking of<br />
hostages, and at the Commonwealth Heads of Government<br />
Regional Meeting in Sydney, the twelve heads of government<br />
agreed to collaborate more closely to counter terrorism<br />
in our region.<br />
There can be no compromise with terrorism. There can be no<br />
deals, but there can be great resistance.<br />
There is no more potent deterrent to terrorist activities<br />
than the wholehearted and concerted effort by individual citizens<br />
to help the government any government in its irrevocable<br />
opposition to terrorists and all their evil works.<br />
