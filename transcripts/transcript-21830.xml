    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> I would like to express my great sadness about the terrible accident which has affected the Australian women's cycling team in Germany. It's one of those awful tragedies. I extend my sympathy to the families of those who have died and those who have been seriously injured and I think on an occasion like this when an accident occurs overseas, it is always, I guess, in a starker situation and the shock of it is greater, and I extend my condolences and my sincere thoughts to all of those who have been affected by it.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister what kind of assistance will be offered to the cycling team?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well all of the assistance that is always offered on these occasions. We are always ready to help if people need help. The Ambassador, she has done a great job, she was on the spot, she went up to the scene of the accident, she took part in the press conference with the German police, and in every way we will help, and if people need financial or other assistance, it will be provided as it should be.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Can I just ask you whether or not you agree with Rupert Murdoch's assertion that Australia's relationship with the US was at its lowest in fifty years in 1996 when you took power?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well look I don't want to get into a comparison at different points except to say that the relationship now is as good as its ever been and I think it will get even better.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister on the statement from Mr Rumsfeld, was this partly as a result of anything that the Australian Government had sought from the US Government?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, Mark, the Australian Government has been arguing for a long time that the Military Commission process should be brought on. It was held up by the appeals to the American courts and therefore we're very pleased that that appeal has been disposed of. But I warn you if there is another appeal against the decision of the Appeals Court then there might be further delay, but that won't be the fault of the Administration or the Australian Government.</p>
<p>  Thank you.</p>
