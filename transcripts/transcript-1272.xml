STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. HAROLD HOLT:<br />
REPORT OF THE NATIONAL RADIATION<br />
ADVISORY COMMITTEE NOVEMBER 1965<br />
I lay on the table of the House the Report dated<br />
November, 1965 of the National Radiation Advisory Committee.<br />
In pursuance of its function of advising the<br />
Commonwealth Government, through the Prime Minister, on<br />
matters concerning the effects of ionizing radiation on the<br />
Australian community, the N. R. A. C. reviewed during 1965 those<br />
matters studied by the Committee since it presented its<br />
previous Report in July, 1962.<br />
In its present Report the Committee has concentrated<br />
its attention on fallout from nuclear tests. An assessment<br />
is made of the possible effects on health in Australia of<br />
fallout from all tests conducted to date. Proposals by France<br />
to conduct weapons tests in the South Pacific Ocean in the near<br />
future have also been considered and possible effects on health<br />
in Australia evaluated.<br />
On the question of hazards arising from those tests<br />
already conducted, fallout monitoring programmes have continued<br />
over the Australian continent since the Committee's last Report<br />
in 1962, and the Committee has accordingly had at its disposal<br />
a most extensive body of data on the levels of fallout radioactivity<br />
in Australia. The Report presents these facts lucidly<br />
and in lay language. Appendices to the Report give the detailed<br />
technical information. Having reviewed all of the information<br />
available to it, the Committee sees no reason to amend its<br />
previous conclusion that there is no significant hazard to the<br />
2 </p>
<p>e-2<br />
health of the Australian population now or in the future as a<br />
result of past nuclear tests.<br />
The French Government will probably commence later this<br />
year the testing of nuclear weapons on a site being established<br />
for this purpose in the South Pacific Ocean, some 4,000 miles<br />
east of Australia. It is expected that at first the tests will<br />
involve only low yield nuclear weapons but later megaton weapons<br />
will be included. In assessing the possible position in Australia<br />
the Committee had available an analysis of the problem prepared by<br />
the Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee. The National Radiation<br />
Advisory Committee is satisfied that the proposed weapons tests<br />
are unlikely to lead to a significant health hazard in Australia.<br />
I might add that this assessment is supported by the<br />
report received from Professor E. W. Titterton and Mr. J. R. Moroney<br />
of their discussions with the French authorities in Paris last<br />
December in regard to the safety measures being undertaken by the<br />
French. The major programmes for monitoring fallout in Australia<br />
are carried out under the direction of the Atomic Weapons Tests<br />
Safety Committee; much of this work features in the Report now<br />
before you. The National Radiation Advisory Committee, being<br />
familiar with these current programmes and also with those to be<br />
implemented in relation to the proposed French tests, believes<br />
that they are adequate to provide for thorough assessment of the<br />
situation in Australia. The measurement and analysis which must<br />
be made to provide reliable information on these low levels of<br />
radioactivity is an exacting and slow process and, obviously, we<br />
cannot expect useful statements of fallout levels to be made on a<br />
day-to-day basis. However Honourable Members can be assured that<br />
adequate monitoring programmes will be implemented on a continuing<br />
basis to keep a check on the level of radioactive fallout following<br />
future tests.<br />
