PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH HOWARD SATTLER, RADIO 6PR,<br />
PERTH -2 MARCH 1990<br />
E OE -PROOF ONLY<br />
SATTLER: The Prime Minister has arrived, he's on the<br />
campaign trail, he's in Western Australia. Welcome to<br />
the studio Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Thanks very much Howard. Good to be with you again.<br />
SATTLER: The pilots, they were there again today.<br />
PM: they are everywhere.<br />
SATTLER: Are you getting used to them? Do you know them<br />
by name now?<br />
PM: No, no no. I don't know them by name. Just<br />
recognise a few faces here and there.<br />
SATTLER: Are they having any affect at all on your<br />
campaign? Not on you personally but on the perception<br />
PM: All I can say is that wherever I go, into the places<br />
which they are picketing, people just express a<br />
repudiation of both what they tried to do to Australia<br />
with their very very greedy claim in which they were<br />
prepared to destroy the system and of their tactics.<br />
That's the reaction I get everywhere I go. So they are<br />
not the important issue.<br />
SATTLER: The Trades and Labour Council president and<br />
also head of the Electrical Trade Union, John Gandini,<br />
was on the program earlier today and he said the arrest<br />
of a pilot in Perth yesterday would do nothing for<br />
Labor's cause in this election. That's the sort of thing<br />
you didn't want to happen. How would you react to that?<br />
PM: It's got nothing to do with us. The police<br />
SATTLER: I know it's nothing to do<br />
PM: the police have to deal with the law and order<br />
situation. If they found it necessary that's their<br />
decision. It's got nothing to do with us. He wasn't<br />
arrested for long. I believe he was out their amongst<br />
the demonstrators later on in the day.<br />
SATTLER: He is there again today is he? </p>
<p>PM: He was there yesterday.<br />
SATTLER: Was he?<br />
PM: Same day.<br />
SATTLER: Well what about a wider issue and the issue of<br />
how much Australia is in debt at the moment. Yesterday a<br />
figure came out and even though Paul Keating and I think<br />
to a lesser degree yourself have commented on it and said<br />
perhaps it's not the end of the section for Australia,<br />
the timing wasn't too good was it?<br />
PM: Yes, but we can't, and of course wouldn't want to,<br />
fix these things, say to the Statistician well don't<br />
bring out your figures. I mean when I called the<br />
election Howard I knew that there would be a January<br />
figure coming out. And there it is. But the important<br />
thing about it is that in seasonal terms it confirms what<br />
we know and that is that the imports are slowing down.<br />
If you look at the three months to January compared with<br />
the previous three months, a definite slowing down. And<br />
very importantly Howard the thing that excited me I think<br />
most about the figures was that if you take the last<br />
three months and compare them with the same three months<br />
of the 12 months earlier, there's been about a<br />
increase in manufactured exports. That coincides with a<br />
very important report we got earlier this week from the<br />
Bureau of Industry Economics which talks in very glowing<br />
terms about the restructuring of the Australian economy<br />
and the way in which we are now exporting much more<br />
manufactured goods. It's reflecting the very very<br />
substantial increase in investment that's taken place in<br />
the manufacturing industry. So in saying all those<br />
things Howard I'm not trying to say look Australia hasn't<br />
got any problem about it. Of course, and our policies<br />
are directed towards it, but the underlying elements of<br />
the restructuring of the economy are such as to give us<br />
cause for optimism into the medium future.<br />
SATTLER: Yes but what about things like the wool exports<br />
going down. They went down<br />
PM: Yes but that's really like something in the bank. I<br />
mean you have something like half a billion dollars of<br />
wool there that's waiting to go. The indications are now<br />
that the market's picking up. That will go into the<br />
figures in the near future.<br />
SATTLER: There are people continuing to talk recession,<br />
mainly your opponents, but what about someone like<br />
Professor Geoffrey Blainey. I know he's no mate of<br />
yours, no friend of the Government. At the debt<br />
conference last night he didn't paint a terribly<br />
PM: You're right. I'm not going to get into a slanging<br />
match with Geoffrey. </p>
<p>SATTLER: By the way, he didn't do that this morning to<br />
you too. He conceded that you were doing a reasonable<br />
job. PM: Look, the fundamental thing about this country for<br />
which we've got to be eternally grateful, it is a<br />
democracy. Geoffrey has his right to express his views<br />
and there's some things that he feels that, y'know, I<br />
profoundly disagree with, when it comes to things in<br />
the immigration area. He's got his right to have his<br />
views just as the pilots have their right to demonstrate.<br />
But in regard to the fundamentals that I repeat Howard,<br />
you've got to ask yourself is Australia now, seven years<br />
on, better placed to deal with the challenges of a<br />
competitive world than it was before? The answer is an<br />
unequivocal yes. I mean the Bureau of Industry Economics<br />
is not a Labor Party appendage. It's an independent<br />
bureau in the bureaucracy. It has come out, in it's<br />
report this week, and made it quite clear that there's<br />
been this massive increase in investment in manufacturing<br />
industry both in plant and equipment and in buildings,<br />
massive increase in employment. Before when we came in,<br />
the manufacturing industry was dying. I mean the<br />
greatest example of course Howard is the steel industry.<br />
In 1983 BHP was going to close the steel industry. But<br />
we said you can't do that and we've restructured the<br />
steel industry. It's now a significant exporter of steel<br />
right round the world. Our shipbuilding industry was<br />
dead. It now exports the best part of three quarters of<br />
a billion dollars around the world. Now these things<br />
just don't transform an economy overnight. But they are<br />
there, they are happening and we are confident that with<br />
the restraint and co-operation that the workforce has<br />
exercised under us, and will continue to do, we can<br />
tackle these problems.<br />
SATTLER: Would you agree with Professor Blainey we've<br />
all got to work a lot harder to get ourselves out of<br />
trouble? PM: Well always people should work as hard as they<br />
possibly can. But let me make this point about<br />
Australian workers. I say this to all your listeners<br />
because most of them are either themselves workers or the<br />
husbands and wives are workers. What has made me proud<br />
is when I talk to industrial leaders for instance from<br />
Japan, the United States and Europe, who have enterprises<br />
in this country, they say to me quite unequivocally that<br />
Australian workers, given good management, are at least<br />
the equal of any workers in the world. I deeply believe<br />
that. So what is required is certainly we all need to<br />
work as hard as we possibly can, but we've got to cooperate,<br />
we've got to work together, we've got improve<br />
work practices and management practices. That's what's<br />
happening. Just let me give you an example from steel<br />
which sticks in my mind. I was talking with the boss of<br />
BHP steel production just a few weeks ago and he </p>
<p>congratulated us on the change in the environment, the<br />
industrial environment that's occurred since we've been<br />
in and the change in his industry. He said what we used<br />
to do these were his words to me Howard, his exact<br />
words he said our attitude used to be that we expected<br />
our workers to leave their brains at the gate. He said<br />
now we realise that's wrong. He said what we're doing is<br />
we're sitting down and we're talking with them, we're<br />
restructuring our practices and the way we produce<br />
things. And he said our productivity is going up in<br />
leaps and bounds. So it's not just a question of working<br />
hard. That's important but it's a question of working<br />
together effectively.<br />
SATTLER: Prime Minister, there's tremendous pressure on<br />
you and I guess all your senior ministers not to make<br />
mistakes during the campaign because you've got this<br />
whole gaggle of people around you and they latch onto<br />
just about every word you or anybody else, your<br />
opponents, say.<br />
PM: That's their job.<br />
SATTLER: Were you embarrassed by Senator Button's<br />
apparent mistake on overseas export programs and the<br />
funding for them a couple of days ago?<br />
PM: Yes of course. It would be dishonest to say I<br />
wasn't embarrassed. But could I make this point, that<br />
that was a misunderstanding on John's part in a matter of<br />
a few million dollars. He agreed in answer to a question<br />
that there was going to be a net reduction in the<br />
combined plans of a continuation of an old plan and a new<br />
plan that we're bringing in. He agreed in answer to a<br />
question that there would be a combined reduction in<br />
outlays. In fact there's not. Over the three years<br />
there'll be about $ 13-16 million. I say $ 13-16 not with<br />
uncertainty but it's whether you count a $ 3 million<br />
program as a continuation or a new one. Now that was the<br />
order of difference. But there's no embarrassment about<br />
that compared to what the embarrassment ought to be of<br />
our opponents. They are going around making promises of<br />
outlays over $ 6 billion, over $ 6 billion of unfunded,<br />
unaccounted for promises. They say we're going to reduce<br />
expenditure but someone ought to tell Mr Peacock if he<br />
talks about cutting you can't then go and spend what you<br />
save. He has got to account for over $ 6 billion. We<br />
will be hammering through this campaign and so the media,<br />
I believe, will be, certainly ought to be, what about<br />
your $ 6 billion? Where's the money coming from. The<br />
important point is not just a point-scoring exercise but<br />
it goes right to the heart of this question of interest<br />
rates. Because the two things which will determine, two<br />
things will determine whether interest rates come down.<br />
One, whether you've got control over wages. We have<br />
seven percent, and we've always been right in our wages<br />
predictions. Seven percent. Under Mr Peacock there'll<br />
be a wages explosion. And what happens to your budget? </p>
<p>We have for the first time in the history of this<br />
Government run our business, that's the Australian<br />
Government. We've run it in profit against the great<br />
deficit of the Liberals. I've used that surplus to pay<br />
of f the Commonwealth Government's debt. We don't owe any<br />
debt overseas. We are net creditors. But now if he<br />
destroys that surplus with his more than $ 6 billion<br />
blowout and a combination of wages explosion and deficit<br />
blowout interest rates must go up. You ask me about<br />
Button. Sure I was embarrassed by those minimal amount<br />
of dollars that John had not quite got right in his mind.<br />
But it is as nothing compared to these things that I'm<br />
talking about.<br />
SATTLER: Does it matter to the Government if Alan Bond<br />
goes broke? Because he's a man who's got a huge overseas<br />
debt. PM: It's a good question Howard. I want to be as fair<br />
and as dispassionate about that as I can. I don't think<br />
that Australia on balance is helped if a large<br />
entrepeneur like Alan Bond, who has a profile not only in<br />
Australia but around the world, if he goes bust. It<br />
probably, given Australia's size, it does a bit more than<br />
if a big boy in America goes bust because there are so<br />
many more of them. So I would be quite silly and<br />
dishonest if I would try and say to you of course it<br />
doesn't matter, there's not impact. It won't be good for<br />
Australia's image marginally if he were to go bust. And<br />
I'm not saying he will. I mean that's for the courts and<br />
for Mr Bond and creditors and so on to work out.<br />
SATTLER: It's not going to help him with the Attorneys-<br />
General sitting down today to decide whether there's<br />
going to be some sort of major investigation with the<br />
Bond companies is it?<br />
PM: No, but you must appreciate, and I know you don't<br />
expect me to comment upon those matters either in the<br />
courts or which may involve the courts, it's not<br />
appropriate. I'm trying to go to the substance of your<br />
question. The internationally, if Mr Bond were to, and<br />
we're talking hypothetically, to go bust, then it would<br />
have a marginal disadvantage. But if you come to within<br />
Australia, again hypothetically if Alan Bond were to go<br />
bust, the actual enterprises would go on. I mean the<br />
breweries would go on producing.<br />
SATTLER: Maybe John Elliott would get them.<br />
PM: Yes but they'd still be, in employment terms and<br />
activity terms, they'd go on. The same with the media.<br />
So in terms of the internal economy of Australia it<br />
wouldn't make any difference. I think in the<br />
international markets whatever they may think about these<br />
things they would've taken into account in any rate by<br />
now. </p>
<p>CAhLLERs Good morning Xr Hawks, I want to ask how you can<br />
claim that you are leading a united team when you and the<br />
Treasurer can't agree on lower~ ing the top tax rate to the<br />
company tax rate and an an issue an an important as the<br />
environment. We have now got Senator Walsh at a completely<br />
different tackc to Senator Richardson and a prominent Labor<br />
backbencher Mr Campbell saying on air only a few days ago<br />
that Senator Richardson is a disaster arnd ought to be sacked<br />
arnd I wonder why your Party has to concentrate its f ire on<br />
supposed Opposition disunity if you really had been doing a<br />
good job for Australia over the last 7 year.<br />
PM. Well Jeremy let's go straight to the issues raised and<br />
then the Opposition as I am~ very glad you raised then.-On<br />
the top tax rate there Lu no difference between Mr Keating<br />
and myself and however you mayJeremy, try to beat that up<br />
you won't succeed and you will appreciate that the media has<br />
not pursued this issue. I simply said in answer to a<br />
question would there be a poveibility of a reduction in the<br />
top rates My answer was very specific in response to what I<br />
said. if in the next term it appeared appropriate or<br />
responsible then that would bes done but it was not on the<br />
agenda and that is precisely the position of the Treasurer.<br />
There is no difference there now. In regard to the<br />
environment and you talk about Xr Campbell, well I don't<br />
think Xr Campbell will you know take offence. If I make the<br />
observation because I made the observation to him directly in<br />
the caucus where he ha. put himself at odds with every other<br />
single member of the caucus on issues, I pointed out to<br />
Graeme that he doesn't really speak for the Party and he<br />
accepts that. He is an interesting character Graeme<br />
Campbell, he in an individual and he has got lots of very<br />
very good points about him.<br />
SATTLERi Can he survive, that'. what I want to know?<br />
o PM: Well he will win his meat of Kalgoorlie,<br />
SATTLEa. i mean within the Party<br />
PM Yes I think he will. I mean he's a very direct sort of<br />
bloke but there in no doubt that his commitments are<br />
basically to the. Labor Party. Blut very interesting Jeremy<br />
that in this context you raised the question of unity in the<br />
oppo sitioni well here of course you have the position where<br />
there is an absolute lack of not only coordination but there<br />
is the deepest possible hatred between leading figures.<br />
Could I just remind you Jeremy, these are not ay words I am<br />
Just reading from the Sydney Morning Harald of the 31 October<br />
last, and this is under the heading, Howard. see it's pretty<br />
definite isn't it.<br />
YATLj~ " No trust between us two says Howard".<br />
PM: * No trust between us two says Howard".<br />
SATTLERi And that's John Howard, not me. </p>
<p>PM i John Howard. And what he says, he said he admitted<br />
there could be no trust between himself and the man who<br />
replaced him, Mr Peacock. So there you have that absolutely<br />
foundational hatred and distrust between these two people,<br />
you will never have any cohesiveness no capacity for<br />
coordinated action within the Liberal Party while those two<br />
are there. And of course it was reflected yesterday Howard<br />
if I may say so because you have Mr Peacock coming out and<br />
saying yes interest rates will still come down, Mr Howard<br />
just completely repudiating Mr Peacock. He said that the<br />
prospect of any significant fall in interest rates in the<br />
immediate future were silch, a complete and absolute<br />
repudiation by Mr Howard yesterday of his leader and it's no<br />
accident because they hate one another and Mr Howard, to his<br />
credit has said no trust between us.<br />
BATTLERt Who is right, on the issue of interest rates?<br />
PMt Howard in right in respect of the policies of his party<br />
because under the policies of Liberal Party there would be<br />
absolutely no chance of a reduction in interest rates<br />
because if you have an explosion of wages and you have a $ 6<br />
billion blow out in prospect with your deficit because you<br />
haven't promises, interest rates can't come down. We<br />
believe as I said this morning in the markets that the<br />
conditions are still there for a reduction in rates.<br />
CALLER: Mr Prime Minister sit, do you have a pad and pen in<br />
front of you?<br />
PM, Well I have got a pen mate.<br />
CALLERs Now I want you to take note please sir.<br />
SATTLERs How long is this going to go for Ted?<br />
CALLERs I just want to make a few comments.<br />
O BATTLER: Ted, there is a whole heap of people waiting to<br />
talk with the PM, you will have to make it short.<br />
CALLERI Yes, You are not to increase the petrol tax.<br />
BATTLER: You are not to increase the petrol tax, in that<br />
what you are telling him?<br />
CALLERS Yes.<br />
ATTLERi Ok, are you getting your orders there.<br />
CALLER: The petrol tax, for the bicentenary was increased<br />
for 1.5 cents now that has not been removed, now I know you<br />
are going to say that you have spent on a lot of money on<br />
roads, yes sure you have that's because the petrol tax has<br />
been increased but it has not kept up with inflation.<br />
SATTLERi Ok what's your question? </p>
<p>CALZ 3R I Now the auto association have stated that ok, r as<br />
not asking a question I am just making a statement.<br />
SATTLERt Alright we know that, alright let's get the pm to<br />
talk about<br />
PM Let mo, your on the question of roads and and funding.<br />
Let me give you the facts Ted as distinct fr'om the absolute<br />
distortions and misrepresentations that have been undertaken<br />
by many people now. Let me give you the f Acts Ted and have<br />
you got a pen and a pad, if you have Just take these figures<br />
down. in the 7 years under the previous government they<br />
spent * 4# 135.5 million, got that Ted. I have spent Ted,<br />
68,752.6 million now there has been inflation in that period<br />
so apply the Bureau of Transport economics road construction<br />
cost index and that gives us in same dollar terms what Mr<br />
Fraser spent $ 9,005.6 million, I have spent $ 10,649-9. Now<br />
Ted have you got thou. f igures down, that shown that in real<br />
terms I have spent 18.30 more on roads than they did and that<br />
in an annual average terms in real terms meant, it means I<br />
have spent $ 235 million more and it you want to look at the<br />
take the government gets f rom oil you got it in two ways.<br />
You get it at the oil rig, the oil levy and you get it at the<br />
petrol pump in the excise and in my last year I have spent am<br />
a proportion of my take on roads, I have spent 19.42% against<br />
in their last year 19.06%. So I have devoted more of the<br />
revenue from oil to roads than they did and I have spent<br />
18.3% more in real terms on roads# those are the facts Ted<br />
CALLRR: Xr Hawke, a fey of my friends and I Are a bit<br />
worried about foreign investment control and what we would<br />
like to know is just what the difference between Labor anid<br />
Liberal policy on foreign investment control.<br />
PX# very good question Anthony. We have a body called the<br />
Foreign Investment Review Board and the task of that FIRD is<br />
to look at significant overseas investment proposals and to<br />
advise the government as to whether those proposals for<br />
investment in Australia are consistent with the national<br />
interest# and we have used that YIRE it has been useful as a<br />
source of advice and guidance to the government as to whether<br />
proposals are in the Australian national interest and our<br />
position is that we will continue along that path.<br />
We believe that some and quite an amount of foreign<br />
investment in Australia in for the benefit of this and future<br />
generations. A lot of it represents the bringing into<br />
Australia Anthony of know how and technology, expertise which<br />
is going to improve the structure of the Australian economy.<br />
Against our position Mr Peacock's policy is to abolish the<br />
FIRE and I think you have there got it in a nutshell.<br />
SATTLERe in the studio and smack bang in the middle of<br />
an election campaign and of course Monday is a big day,<br />
celebrates 7 years don't you on Monday, is that right?<br />
PX t Yen that's the election anniversary. We have a more<br />
important one on Saturday, Hazel and I celebrate in Alice<br />
Springs, that's tomorrow our 34th wedding anniversary. </p>
<p>BATTLER: I am glad you got that right.<br />
PMi I was right, 34. Married here in Perth, Trinity Church,<br />
St Georges Terrace on March 3 1956.<br />
SATTLBRt Have you got the present?<br />
PM; Beg your pardon.<br />
SATTLERIs Have you got the present?<br />
PMx: It's being organised mate.<br />
SATTLERs Is it?<br />
PHI YOe.,<br />
SATTLERit Today.<br />
PM: Yes, it's being organtised.<br />
BATTLERi Alright well have a good day tomorrow.<br />
PMi Thanks very much.<br />
SATTLERt Double celebration, I think a man called Mr Caesidy<br />
has got a birthday tomorrow too, hasn't he. Some bloke who<br />
PMi Yes he has,<br />
SATTLERs He's not, only<br />
PM: What do you reckon he looks mate?<br />
SATTLERs At the risk of being sued, I won't say. Alright<br />
celebrations all round and I suppose you hope that all that<br />
pales into insignificance besides March 24.<br />
CALLERs I just wanted to say, I wanted to congratulate you<br />
on the way you handled the phone call from the listener you<br />
had in Brisbane regarding the referendum on Asian<br />
immigration.<br />
PMI Thank you. </p>
<p>P~ e ( cont'd) seen it and I found it very disturbing because<br />
as T said there is two parts to this question. There is a<br />
moral thi~ ng I mean I just find it morally repugnant that<br />
Anyone can say that you can distinguish between people on the<br />
basis of their colour, their skcin and the shape of their head<br />
or their eyes and so on is morally repugnant but the very<br />
important thing Howard and you know I don't think this can be<br />
over emphasised is for the future of our kids that we have to<br />
understand that the Asian Pacific region in the fastest<br />
growing part of the world, the most dynamic. We do more of<br />
our trade there individually than with any other sector and<br />
that wiill increase in the future and if Australia is going to<br />
be able to grow and be art of that massive growth in the<br />
region to contribute to it and benefit from it, then the<br />
worst thing that we can possibly do for our kids and their<br />
future is to give those people an indication that we regard<br />
them an second or third class human beings because they will<br />
simply may, rightly as you or I would if we were there, if we<br />
were there we would say,, you want to trade with us, you want<br />
to ' regard us as first class trading people, but we are second<br />
or third class people when it comes to im~ igration, forget<br />
it. That's what they would say.<br />
SATLR That statement you have Just made probably would<br />
have usually incited a call from members of the Australian<br />
Nationalist Movement here in Perth, this is their<br />
headquarters but most of them are in jail at the moment so I<br />
am afraid they probably won't be able to call you.<br />
CALLER Mrt Hawke in ragard. * foreign aid, At the present<br />
time we are giving away 13/ 14 patrol boats built here in WA<br />
to Now Guinea and other parts of the<br />
PMs South Pacific, yes South Pacific.<br />
CALLER: In the meantime we can't even patrol our own coast<br />
of WA.<br />
PM Well Peter I don't really know what the point you are<br />
making is but let me say this to you Peter that we regard<br />
ourselves as having a responsibility to assist the countries<br />
of the South Pacific and that really Peter ranges from Papua<br />
New Guinea and then it goes right across to Western Samoa and<br />
countris, Pili and there are 13 of them now. We take the<br />
view and it a I think basically there is a bipartisan<br />
position here Peter that Australia as the largest nation in<br />
this region has a responsibility to be of assistance to these<br />
countries. This is not just a question of do goodism of a<br />
warm inner glow, if you want to put it in starker terms than<br />
that in terms of your security it also makes sense that We<br />
have good relations with the countries of this region. Nov<br />
what you have got to appreciate Peter is that these countries<br />
have very very limited economies and for all of them fishing<br />
in particular is a significant and for some of them almost<br />
the only part of their economic development they have got and<br />
they have to have some capacity to patrol their fishing<br />
mnnano thrny Arm giijort rn drirmistmt~ hir thn fiahing uossals </p>
<p>PM. ( Cont'd) Of Other Countries and it makes imMinent good<br />
sense that we should assist them to be able to look af ter~<br />
that economic capacity that they have got. And I ans not<br />
aware Peter that there is really any Political difference<br />
with our opponents on this. I would think that the<br />
Opposition will in fact endorse our program, it's something<br />
which is intrinsically sensible for the countries concerned<br />
but also it makes a hell of a lot of good sense f rom<br />
Australia's security point of view.<br />
CALLER. I have just got a question of Xr H~ awke. I would<br />
like to know why you have not been completely honest with the<br />
people of Australia and telling them why the pilots situation<br />
degenerated into what It is nov.<br />
PM You are entitled to accuse me of course of not being<br />
honest about it. I have been absolutely honest Howard if I<br />
could just very very quickly, not only for Neil but for your<br />
listeners recapitulate on the facts. It is now 12 months ago<br />
that the pilots made their decision Neil not me, the pilots<br />
made a decision that actually issued a publication and in it<br />
they said that they were going to take on their employers,<br />
the government, the trade union movement and the Industrial<br />
Relations Commission. They said the guidelines that applied<br />
to everyone else were not for them. They had in f act<br />
received the benefits of vage restraint because in response<br />
to the wage restraint of . workers generally we have given tax<br />
cuts, suaperann~ uation benefits, so the pilots got the benefits<br />
of those. But when it came to their wage claim they said we<br />
are not going to abide by the Coziuision, by the guidelines<br />
we are not going to have a bar of that, we are going to take<br />
prolonged industrial action. Their words for it, they<br />
advised their members to prepare for what they<br />
euphemistically called a NIP, which was a non income period.<br />
It was their directions to their memzber., they said go and<br />
get another job, start a lawn mowing business, be prepared<br />
for a long non income period.<br />
SATTLIR: It's become a bite now.<br />
Mr Well, but bit themselves mate. They were telling their<br />
people this was going to be a long f ight to buot the<br />
employers, the government and the industrial relations<br />
system, the trade union movement they were going to break<br />
outside the guidelines for what they said they were going to<br />
got a 30% increase on top of their average $ 80,000 a year.<br />
That 30% increase, $ 24,000 a year increase represented more<br />
than what a very very large number of people were earning in<br />
a year. Now Neil what I said to them, don't do that. Stay<br />
within the system do what everyone else has done, where-you<br />
have got the benefits from in theme other areas like<br />
superannuation. When they wouldn't do it I said well I am<br />
not going to stand Idly by and see the Australian economy<br />
smashed because if we let the pilots get their 30% as Mr<br />
Peacock would have, if we had let them get their 30% then the<br />
whole system was smashed, all the unions with the power to do<br />
it would go out and after 30% and the economy would have been </p>
<p>( cont'd) smashed an it was in 1981/ 82 when the same thing<br />
happened. Now those are the f acts. In the course of that<br />
the pilots resigned# they weren't sacked they resigned and in<br />
that situation when they resigned in pursuit of that 301 wage<br />
claim then the airlines went about the process of recruiting<br />
other people. Those are the facts, not opinions.<br />
CAZLER: Nr Hawke I would like to may that I think you are<br />
the best government Australia has ever had despite that I<br />
want to make a criticis. zu<br />
PM: r guess I have got to settle for that Greg ok.<br />
CALLERt Well I don't think, the opposition is even worse in<br />
this regard. The thing that really concerns me is this<br />
American thinking in Australia at the moment, deregulation is<br />
a great thing and the question I would like you to look at<br />
after you win the election. If you look at all the economies<br />
in the world that are doing very vells the Asian tigers,<br />
India with a growth rate of about European countries<br />
like Holland, West Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, theme<br />
economies are all highly regulated and the economies that<br />
have deregulated over the last 15 years are the economies<br />
that are going very badly and I think the reason that, I<br />
think the government took a lot of courageous decisions but I<br />
think the nature of the market forces of greed and<br />
everything, the business community have let the government<br />
down anyway and Australia.<br />
M~ To answer that question or those observations in the<br />
detail that they deserve would obviously take longer than we<br />
have got, could I just Howard try and make a couple of points<br />
quickly which I think are relevant. I think you have got to<br />
understand that while we have deregulated in many areas to<br />
allow the forces of competition to operate and I &amp; hnk they,<br />
the best test perhaps of this maybe seen Greg, in that we<br />
have had a rate of economic growth now twice as f ast as it<br />
was under our predecessors and a rate of employment growth<br />
five times faster than under our predecessors. Now<br />
paradoxically that has got something to do with deregulation<br />
but I would also have to concede it's got something to do<br />
with regulation because we have had a wages policy which in a<br />
cense has been regulated, we have had the trade union<br />
movement exercising restraint in return for improvements ini<br />
education, tax cuts and so on so that has been a mixture of<br />
regulation and deregulation but that leads to me to one<br />
point. You talk about greed, * o of the things that has<br />
disappointed me very very much indeed in this pracess that as<br />
we have deregulated except in regard to the wages area whet*<br />
with cooperation from the unions we have had restraint,<br />
business executive, have shown a fair amount of greed. We<br />
have in fact complained to the Buuiftes Council of Australia<br />
and the Federation of Australian Industry that they have<br />
allowed enormous increases in executive remuneration. Now I<br />
can see that in some areas there is a case f or some. But I<br />
certainly do believe that there could have been a degree of<br />
restraint amongst executive., many executives to match the<br />
restraint that's been practised by the trade union movement. </p>
<p>CALLER m There is a couple of things. rsrtly, Concerning<br />
health cars. I have a young son who has orthodontist trouble<br />
and quite honestly we took him up to the dental school and he<br />
had surgery and all the work done. Quite honestly it didnt<br />
cost us a penny and if it hadn't been for Medicare there was<br />
no way I would have been able to afford it which taken me<br />
into the other point which I would like to congratulate you<br />
an for setting up Medicare and I don't think enough people<br />
give you credit and give this government credit for the<br />
health care system that we have got, which leads me into the<br />
point about the wages policy that the Libs seem to be putting<br />
out and the question is where are the differences between the<br />
Liberal wages policy, if any and you can call. it a policy if<br />
that, as against the Labor policy?<br />
PH: Thank you for your comments about health care. Just to<br />
cover that quickly Howard. When we came to of fice there were<br />
2 million Australians an you know who weren't covered and for<br />
whom the prospect of doctors bills or hospital bills<br />
represented a nightmare. We now have a health system which<br />
is universal, no member of any Australian family has to worry<br />
about meeting. those bills and it's fair because you Howard<br />
and I who are on higher salaries compared to the rest of the<br />
community, we pay more and I think you would agree with me<br />
that that is fair. You wouldn~' t disagree with that so it's<br />
univeroal and it's fair. On wages policy you are right there<br />
because I like Howard to just get to your listeners this<br />
point. X don't want us to be theoretical about it and saying<br />
well would it be worse under the Liberal's wages policies<br />
compared with the government's. we can look, we have had the<br />
decade of the 805 now behind us and in that decade Australia<br />
tested the two policies. In the first couple of years they<br />
had the Liberals where they abolished the centralised wage<br />
system and they said open slather. we had a wages explosion<br />
and it destroyed the economy we had the worst recession in<br />
years in this country, unemployment rising, inflation rising.<br />
For the first time ever double digit inflation and double<br />
digit unemployment. Now I said that there is a better way<br />
than that and for the last 7 years we have had wage<br />
restraint, we have doubled * our economic growth, we have had<br />
times the rate of employment growth and in fact our growth<br />
h~ as been that strong that I have had to slow it down a bit,<br />
last year with higher interest rates but they are now going<br />
to be coming off.-Now against that Zace what my opponents<br />
are doing is promising a return to the open slather of the<br />
at which must mean again a collapse of the economy and the<br />
higher interest rates.<br />
SATTLRR# One question I have got to ask you before you go,<br />
please don't take offence. Were you okay during the Great<br />
Debate, my listeners are saying he was so reserved, he was go<br />
quiet, wao he well they said?<br />
PM: I was certainly well, look let me<br />
SATTLERe Have you been asked that before?<br />
PMo Yes I have and Ikiave told people this. What X wanted </p>
<p>PMo ( ont'd) to do in the debate, it really goes back to some<br />
advice I was back in 1959 soon after I had gone to the ACTU.<br />
I was talking to a bloke who is a mate of mine and he was a<br />
television producer, He said really the secret of television<br />
Bob is, in a sense radio but television even more no, in to<br />
be talking to the person you are talking too. Don't think<br />
that you are talking to millions of people you are talking to<br />
one. What I wanted to do in what's referred to as the Great<br />
Debate, I wanted to feel as though I was in someone's<br />
loungeroom talking with them. Now if you are sitting in<br />
someone's loungeroom talking with them Howard you don't shout<br />
and hector.<br />
SATTLERt Beat up on them,<br />
PM: No and I was hoping therefore that you know people<br />
would feel well here's Hawkie, we know he's been around for<br />
years, we know him, at times he can hector a bit and shout<br />
a bit and I have been guilty of that probably haven't done an<br />
well as I should at times. That debate was important and I<br />
wanted people to feel there I was with them talking with<br />
them. SATTLER, And that's why you were so quiet?<br />
PM: I think when I had to be a bit firm I was but T didn't<br />
want to shout and hector.<br />
BATTLERt Left that to your opponent.<br />
PMs I think that happened a bit that way.<br />
SATTLBRs Thanks for coming in today. We appreciate that and<br />
there's a hard slog to go yet, you have got about what 3<br />
weeks to go.<br />
PM: About that Howard, yes. it's always a pleasure to be<br />
with you mate.<br />
SATTLERs Thanks for joining us on the program today and I<br />
have said to all the candidates good luck on the 24 March.<br />
PMt Thanks very much, thanks to you and to your listeners.<br />
SATTLERi Happy anniversary tomorrow.<br />
PM: Thanks.<br />
SATTLERs In Alice Springs.<br />
PM; In Alice Springs.<br />
SATTLER, Yes what a place.<br />
PM: It will be about as hot 4s it was in Perth when we got<br />
married, it was 104 the day we got married.<br />
SATTLER: Things have been hotting up ever since.<br />
