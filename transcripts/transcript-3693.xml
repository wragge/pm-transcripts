SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P,,<br />
AT THE OPENING OF THE FIRST SUBDIVISION<br />
OF THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN LAND COMMISSION,<br />
HAPPY VALLEY, SOUTH AUSTRALIA,<br />
11 APRIL 1975<br />
I HOPE THIS WILL BE THE FIRST OF MANY SUCH OPENINGS<br />
I SHALL ATTEND THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA. IT IS APPROPRIATE<br />
THAT THE FIRST SUBDIVISION OF LAND PURCHASED AND PREPARED<br />
FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT BY A STATE LAND COMMISSION SHOULD<br />
BE HERE IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA. ADELAIDE WAS AUSTRALIA'S<br />
FIRST PLANNED CITY. COLONEL LIGHT, THAT FAR-SIGHTED<br />
SURVEYOR-GENERALWAS AUSTRALIA'S FIRST TOWN PLANNER<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIA HAS BEEN ONE STATE WHERE COOPERATION BETWEEN<br />
GOVERNMENTS IN THE INTERESTS OF OUR PEOPLE HAS ALWAYS -BEEN<br />
PROMPT AND FRUITFUL. IT IS NOW ACCEPTED THAT GOVERNMENTS<br />
EVERYWHERE SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN URBAN PLANNING AND<br />
DEVELOPMENT NOT BECAUSE IT MAY BE SOMEONE'S PARTICULAR<br />
HOBBY HORSE, NOT BECAUSE IT'S FASHIONABLE OR TRENDY, BUT<br />
BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO IMPROVE OUR CITIES<br />
AND MAKE THEM BETTER PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE.. IN...<br />
h<br />
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS SUBDIVISION HAS BEEN A GOOD<br />
EXAMPLE OF COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT. PLANNERS, BUILDERS,<br />
LOCAL RESIDENTS, LOCAL BODIES, HAVE HAD A PART TO PLAY.<br />
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CONSULTED; PEOPLE HAVE SAID WHAT THEY<br />
WANT FOR THEIR NEW COMMUNITY. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
WE ARE GETTING AWAY FROM THE OLD IDEA OF CITIES BEING<br />
BUILT AND PEOPLE BEING MOULDED TO FIT THEM ACCORDING<br />
TO CONCEPTS IMPOSED FROM ABOVE OR FROM FAR AWAY, PEOPLE,<br />
LOCAL PEOPLE, LOCAL NEEDS, ARE CENTRAL TO OUR THINKING,<br />
I FIRST PROPOSED THE IDEA OF LAND COMMISSIONS<br />
IN OUR ELECTION POLICY IN 1972, WE SEE THEM AS THE<br />
ONLY PRACTICAL WAY TO BEAT THE SPIRALLING COST OF<br />
BUILDING LAND. THE PRICE OF LAND IS THE SINGLE LARGEST<br />
COMPONENT IN THE COST OF A HOME, THE LAND COMMISSION<br />
PROGRAM OPERATES ON A VERY SIMPLE AND FUNDAMENTAL<br />
PLANNING PRINCIPLE ADEQUATE LAND SUPPLY IS<br />
NECESSARY TO PREVENT LAND PRICE INCREASES AT TIMES<br />
OF HIGH DEMAND. THIS IS BECAUSE THE NATURE OF URBAN LAND<br />
AS A COMMODITY MAKES IT PARTICULARLY LIABLE TO MARKET<br />
MANIPULATION, PREVIOUS GOVERNMENTS IGNORED THIS<br />
PROBLEM, SOUTH AUSTRALIA HAS COOPERATED IN OUR SCHFME<br />
FROM THE START, OTHER STATES WHERE LAND PRICES ARE<br />
HIGHER THAN HERE ARE STILL DRAGGING THE CHAIN, YET<br />
IN THIS SUBDIVISION WE CAN ALREADY SEE THE BENEFITS OF<br />
OUR SCHEME, I BELIEVE THE BLOCKS OF LAND FOR SALE HERE<br />
ARE ABOUT-$ 1,000 CHEAPER THAN COMPARABLE BLOCKS. 7IN<br />
OTHER PARTS OF ADELAIDE,<br />
PLANNED COMMUNITIES SUCH AS THIS WILL HAVE OTHER<br />
PDVANTAGES APART FROM PRICE, . THERE WILL BE NO UNSIGHTLY<br />
ELECTRICITY POLES, HERE, AS IN ALL OTHER LAND COMMISSION<br />
SUBDIVISIONS IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA, THE VISUAL POLLUTION OF<br />
UNSIGHTLY POLES WILL BE ELIMINATED AS THE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY<br />
WILL BE UNDERGROUND, </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PROVISIONS WILL BE MADE FOR PARKS, RECREATION AREAS<br />
AND PLAYGROUNDS SUCH AS THE ONE THIS PLAQUE WILL<br />
COMMEMORATE. IDON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD ARGUE THAT RAPID<br />
URBANISATION HAS BROUGHT MANY SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC<br />
ILLS TO OUR CITIES. TRANSPORT, SEWERAGE, LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT SERVICES HAVE BEEN MADE MORE COSTLY AND<br />
DIFFICULT. 4I1fDUSTRIES HAVE MET WITH HIGHER COSTS,<br />
THE ' ENVIRONMENT HAS SUFFERED. FOR ALL THESE REASONS<br />
DON DUNSTAN' S GOVERNMENT AND my GOVERNMENT HAVE INITIATED<br />
A SERIES OF POLICIES RELATING TO LAND USE AND LAND<br />
PRICES. THE OBJECT IVE HAS BEEN TO REDUCE-THE<br />
UNFORTUNATE CONSEQUENCES OF TOO RAPID URBANISATION.<br />
THIS YEAR THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
ALLOCATED APPROXIMATELY $ 26 MILLION TO THE SOUTH<br />
AUSTRALIAN LAND COMMISSION BETWEEN ITS ESTABLISHMENT<br />
IN NOVEMBER 1973 AND JUNE 19714, IT HAS PURCHASED<br />
1226 HECTARES OF LAND WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THE<br />
ADEALIDE METROPOLITAN AREA. THIS YEAR IT IS<br />
IMPLEMENTING A FURTHER PROGRAM TO ACQUIRE OR<br />
PURCHASE 21432 HECTARES FOR URBAN DEVELO'PMENT AND 11173<br />
HECTARES FOR MAJOR METROPOLITAN OPEN SPACES, IN<br />
ADDITION THE COMMISSION HAS ENGAGED THE. SERVICES OF<br />
PROFESSIONAL CONSULTANTS IN THE FIELDS OF PLANNING,<br />
ENGINEERING, SURVEYING AND VALUING. IN THIS WAY IT HAS<br />
HELPED SUSTAIN DEMAND FOR THESE SERVICES THROUGH THE RECENT<br />
PERIOD OF DECLINE IN BUILDING ACTIVITY. </p>
<p>-3ATHE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS A FINANCIER TO<br />
THE LAND COMMISSION BUT IT HAS A MUCH WIDER ROLE THAN<br />
THAT, MANY AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES AND<br />
PROGRAMS HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE PROVISION OF<br />
CAPITAL WORKS IN URBAN DEVELOPMENT THE P. M. G.,<br />
DEFENCE INSTALLATIONS, EMPLOYMENT, OFFICES, ROADS,<br />
UNIVERSITIES, HOSPITALS, SEWERAGE PROGRAMS, PART<br />
OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY IS THE<br />
EFFICIENT COORDINATION OF ALL SERVICES PROVIDED BY<br />
STATE AND AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS. THE LAND COMMISSION<br />
IS A STATE ORGANISATION, STATE-RUN AND STATE-MANAGED:<br />
BUT EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT THERE IS A PLACE FOR<br />
JOINT EFFORT BY THE AUSTRALIAN AND SOUTH AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENTS IN SHAPING THE BROAD STRATEGIC POLICIES<br />
WITHIN WHICH THE COMMISSION FUNCTIONS,<br />
THE LAND SUPPLY SHORTAGE IS LIKELY TO<br />
BECOME CRITICAL, PARTICULARLY IN SYDNEY AND MELBOURNE.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS THE WILL TO ACT BUT THE<br />
STATES MUST ALSO PARTICIPATE. NEW SOUTH WALES HAS<br />
SIGNED A FINANCIAL AGREEMENT, AND THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING TO THAT STATE TO ACT-FIRMLY ON<br />
A LARGE SCALE TO PREVENT FURTHER LAND PRICE INCREASES<br />
IN SYDNEY. IN VICTORIA THE GOVERNMENT HAS AGREED TO<br />
SET UP AN URBAN LAND COUNCIL'BY 30 JUNE THIS YEAR AND<br />
ACTION ON THAT PROMISE IS URGENTLY NEEDED, ,/ 4 </p>
<p>DON'T IMAGIN4E THAT LAND COMMISSIONS ARE AL. L THAT<br />
CONCERN US IN THIS FIELD. IN MAKING AUSTRALIA A BETTER<br />
PLACE TO LIVE IN WE AIRE JUST AS CONCERNED WITH RURAL<br />
AREAS AS WITH CITIES. OUR NEW DEPARTMENT OF URBAN AND<br />
REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT DEALS AS MUCH WITH THE WELFARE'OF<br />
REfGlNS. AS IT DOES WITH CITIES, WE HAVE REACHED<br />
AGREEMENT WITH THE STATES ON THE BOUNDARIES OF 76<br />
REGIONS WHICH TH. E GOVERNMENT WILL USE AS THE BASIS<br />
OF ITS PROGRAMS. LAST YEAR WIE APPROVED THE FIRST<br />
DIRECT GRANTS EVER MADE BY AN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO<br />
LOCAL COUNCILS GRANTS TOTALLING $ 56 MILLION THROUGHOUT<br />
AUSTRALIA, WE ARE PUSHING AHEAD WITH GROWTH CENTRES,<br />
INCLUDING MONARTO IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA. WE HAVE<br />
SAFEGUARDED THE NATIONAL ESTATE, THE UNIQUE AND<br />
BEAUTIFUL THINGS, NATURAL AND MAN-MADE WORTH KEEPING<br />
IN OUR COUNTRY. LAST FINANCIAL YEAR 101. NATIONAL ESTATE<br />
PROJECTS WERE APPROVED AT A TOTAL COST OF $ 2.5 MILLION<br />
WE ARE PROVIDING ASSISTANCE FOR.-ADELAIDE'S WATER<br />
TREATMENT SCHEME. WE ARE CATCHING UP FURTHER WITH THE<br />
SFWERAGE BACKL. OG IN THE MAJOR CITIES. IN THE LAST<br />
FINANCIAL YEAR $ 38 MILLION WORTH OF APPROVED WORKS WERE<br />
CARRIED OUT. A TOTAL OF $ 110 MILLION IS BE1ING MADE<br />
AVAILABLE FOR WORKS STARTED THIS FINANCIAL YEAR. OUR<br />
URBAN LOCAL ROADS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE<br />
QUALITY OF RESIDENTIAL STREETS AND WILL INCLUDE A NUMBER<br />
OF INNOVATIONS TO LIFT THE ENVIRONMENT STANDARDS OF ROADS<br />
IN URBAN AND PROVINCIAL CENTRES. </p>
<p>I CONGRATULATE THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN LAND COMMISSION<br />
AND THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ON COMPLETING THIS<br />
FIRST SUBDIVISION, WITH GOVERNMENTS WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP<br />
WE CAN ACHIEVE FAIRER LAND PRICES FOR THE HOMEBUILDER AND A<br />
MORE CONGENIAL AND EFFICIENT ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS. </p>
