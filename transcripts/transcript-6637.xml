E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH MIKE WILLESEE 4 JUNE 1985<br />
MW The lurks, the perks, the 1ion-taxcable fringe benefits v-ould<br />
go or stay if the companies could afford to pay taxc on them. Hiave<br />
You asessed how many companies might go to the wiall on this popo-. al?<br />
PM I don't believe any compan~ ies will go to tho wall un( c. er2 Ch i P<br />
proposal Mike, its the sort of tkjing we have talked about with sxono<br />
repesetatives of the busineal ' onmmunity. They have conved ou<br />
that they think its the appropriate way of going about it. Its tho<br />
&amp; pproach that was adopted in Hew Zealand Mike, and we balicve that<br />
it is a sensible way oi doing it.<br />
DZI-Isn't it the easy way out?: Even cowardly to put tho burden<br />
on the corapani-es?<br />
P14 No, its neither easy or cowardly, -it is we beliova the<br />
sensible way of doing it. There~ ll be a difference in reactions,<br />
some will say they will absorb itt others will say well wo'll1 tran-. ate<br />
into a cash benefit and you are coing to be in a situation v!<br />
very significantly reduced mdrgina1 rates-for employees so they<br />
C. will do better out of it,<br />
Mil But in this particular one~ yuhv o h xilye otn:<br />
benefits, and not paying tax on them. You say thats wr~ ong, rihouald<br />
change, but they're not going to pay. The company will.<br />
P14*~ Wl all I'm saying Michael, its not just something twe, conjur-cd<br />
up~, and said Oh isn't this a cle~{ er idea, we had cliscussion-with<br />
roprosentativaes of einployers, an4 there is not actuallytri~ ra<br />
aprobation by employers, but we 0ave crt, inly had rprejentatives " r </p>
<p>c o I<br />
employers saying to us they think'thiG is a sensible route to<br />
follow. Its one that has been adoptod in Now Zealand aftcar very<br />
serious consideration and discuss~ on over there, we belinve this iu<br />
a fair and equitable way of handling it.<br />
M11~ so its not just a m'atter of: emlployee5 having meore votcs than<br />
company e s<br />
PH4 N-Io, cortainly not.<br />
IW Vell officially, politician~ of . course get the bast-taxz freae<br />
porks of all. Woaild they still g6t them?<br />
PM N~ o the same rule would applV to politicians as to othe! r cpe<br />
I'm a little bit disapointed that' in the discussion that has devel. opnd<br />
today, there ~ xsbeen some nuggebtion that via iight bz doing<br />
it because there is some potentidi benefit for ourselves, I jus~ t<br />
simply want to cay this, I had intended at an early stage to say it<br />
and I say it now, that when Paul eating and I were discus. sing those<br />
matters quite early in the piece, iwe saw that as a result of thp<br />
bringing in of the package there gould be a, benefit to ourselveo<br />
in reduction of the higher marginal rates, both Paul and I Ocided<br />
that in regard to any net benefit that would accrue to us vwe wouY&amp; n ' t<br />
accept them. Any thing that woulc4 come to us would go to ca' 41tz ty<br />
bacause wa, I'm not trying to qrai~ stand about that, I don't uant . i<br />
issue in any way mnuddied by any suiggestions that you are trying to CD<br />
something to beniefit yourself.<br />
M What about members of parlitment and their electoral allowanucs<br />
* which are quite substantial? V4ha<br />
P14 Mhat's been said in the iihi e paper, is that where you have cu<br />
arbitrated provision then that wi~. l be not covered by the: se pzroPoc:,:<br />
and that will apply equally to ner~ ers of parliament as to Penyonie In<br />
thn torkforce twho have that sort 6f benefit.<br />
Wore </p>
<p>cont 3<br />
IMW Doesn't that make it much ipre difficult to Cell this PrOocal<br />
PH1-Xdn think so.<br />
M1-When companies are disa vantaged, but politicians von't be.<br />
PM N~ o, that'n not the right sort of comparison, what you are<br />
Baying is that therc are a whole lot of people in the eom~ nun:. ty<br />
I-ike who have arbitrated allowanoza,, they have been the result o f e<br />
independent, arbitral decision ar~ d in those cases it it; Gaid, innd<br />
ite appropriate not to touch thos'e. The ma~ jor haornorrha. rl f t<br />
revenue system Mike is in the private sector ihere, and t his 16 wh,, at<br />
the private sector itself tells you that they are malting up cneatiOn<br />
in packages which are in part a sialary but then they have allth4: e<br />
other things Thke* payment of edul'ation, housing, and* all that: GOrt<br />
of thingo<br />
b" 74-Yes, no doubt about that, here is no doubt at all, but Guxrely<br />
the sa-me applies to politicians, btyou are now going to izitae<br />
PM We are not differentiating,; I don't know how many timar, 1<br />
to say it, I'm saying that exactfy the sam~ e rule will appl. y to PoliticUz,.<br />
as t* o the rest of the community. Exactly the same rules.<br />
F-0 The company says, well eitl cr I can afford to pay the e~ taand<br />
I will pay it to keep these bett~ r paid executives happy or thcq<br />
wion' t and they won' t get it and hey can make a decision as to %-whelaer<br />
they stay or not.. Politicians w Lil get it.<br />
PM Politicians will-have the cante rules applied to them as in z-he<br />
rest of the community where therfe are arbitrated decisions wherc it<br />
is simply not a question of an arbitrary decision, by some employor<br />
but where there have been indepeftdent tribunals saying that in<br />
respect of the employment of thi class of person, this sort of<br />
allowance should be made, f-yhether' its a politician or any one b-lse<br />
w-here thcore. has that independent: deci sion made, then the r,; amc<br />
rules u ill apply to avorybody. i~ o-u I have setid thtat 3 n<br />
Cont.... </p>
<p>c6nt 4<br />
I think that ought to be enough to establish the point.<br />
U, -Prime, M~ inister v: hat do you think your proposal realljy ill do<br />
to stop talt avoidance?<br />
PM TWell there are these things' to be said. In the broaConing of tli<br />
tax base, the direct tax base, th~ cre will be a closing of v a be<br />
of sh~ elters w~ ll~ k~ h have been used for the purpose of tax avc.*. Canco.<br />
The closing of oZ those shelteras 2ill meanl the enC: of avoio':. ncol IZ<br />
those areas. The necond thing is: that if the broad based conslm, tis) n<br />
tax is brought:' in -* hose increasing numbers of people in the coxmunity<br />
who buy the usual clever lawyers. nd accountants have avoRi ed t hs<br />
payment of any tax on their inco and also in the absence of a'<br />
consumption tax aren't paying any, tax on the spending of that inccri<br />
They will be caught up there by t~ ue 121410 consumption tax,,, t' * xcy % ilY<br />
be paying taX so that's the second point.<br />
V24 Can I just take it a p6int ~ t a tim3 because that is very<br />
important. Are you conceding tha~ t if you .&gt;~ J-catch tLhe.: a on the<br />
tax they should be paying, at leapst get them for 12! j%,<br />
PM That's not the only point, ' What 10m saying is that I 1helieve<br />
that the ordinary Mr fMrs Austratia object to the point vwizere ' roi<br />
so many of them are paying in recspect of the marginal Ooll,-r t11-. t<br />
they earn that the* are paying vi-tualiy half of every inargineal<br />
dollar out in tax. 46 cents in eVery marginal dollar. going. Ilhsre<br />
we will be able to provide a net benef it for the majority o. C nunstralizinz<br />
is. because of two things. I wie tAll be broadening the direct tax<br />
base. Removing shelters and so oi so more revenue will be coming i<br />
and secondly you'l11 be getting tl~ is dividend througlh the cozmu to'<br />
tax from thosze people who at t! lie inoment don't pay any tax t all.<br />
So from those two sources you'll' be anble to get the situation I : 1ic-<br />
2 </p>
<p>for the person on average earnin4s pw;: ducces this situation. They 11<br />
got 31 dollars a week cut in taxc&amp; 3, they will pay an ext: ca ~ 6J<br />
because ok the increases in price's and associated2 Twith t'ie broad,'--_ cd<br />
consuamption tax so in not telms, ithat average weekly ealm. inrg ' All La<br />
$ 16 a weelk better of.' We're able to do those th~ ings eus<br />
we are bringing in a tax on those' w%. ho currently are avo-!. C1i,. 1q it.<br />
M1 Do you think you have a-ny Feal. 1stic proposition?<br />
Gotting those people who are dodg'Ing the 60 cents ra2te or tha net, 1<br />
cents rate, and picking them uonly the l21Aj:-Kte you po:~<br />
Eyou have any realistic chance p'f piching them up cleanily and<br />
malting them pay the lot?<br />
PiA Well, I think to the exntent; that there is aSpart of<br />
package a reduction in the fop marginal rate from 60 to 50 that: o'-<br />
itself will tend to reduce evasioni and avoidanCe; it viillt not cut<br />
it out entirely. L<br />
Is that really your advice 11crom the businesu conrnuniAJ'y?<br />
PMe Yes, that well, let me pu~ it this way, I mean J. the<br />
mz'-) rginal rate is 90 cents in the 2ollar there is a very ve: 7y h i h<br />
incentive to avoid, if its dow-n tob i0 much less. Sc) clen2zly I<br />
think the ireduction in marginal rates on balance have an effect;' o-2<br />
reducing the tendency to evacjion 1, ind avoidance.<br />
Primre M~ inister there seem tobe somne anoinalies, in th3 cz o:<br />
tax replacing o-ther sales tax wheke luitury goods nia rcome in<br />
and basic necessities will be imore ex: pensive alnost you can get a<br />
icheaper Rolls Royce and pay miore: for your mince neat and 1.-: cead.<br />
PM But you will be having very' very much more in your pa. y pacP.-c k<br />
or in your social welifare reccipt You' 1ll be having Paore w-onsy*<br />
to pacy that increased price in nc ter-ms after you have pai the<br />
increased price out of your higheIr pay packet or your h~ g,: zr </p>
<p>Cont 6<br />
welfare packet. You will be bet cr of You and your treasuzr<br />
have obviouily worked very hard Ito propose compensation for th2<br />
poor who might be disadvajitaged V.' ndc'r this set of pro,-o! saln.<br />
Would you consideor compensation orbusinersezs wh~ ich 1wiay be r-uied<br />
as a result?<br />
P--We don't belIieve businesses will1 be ruined. as a rc,-ult. There<br />
ino evidence to suggest that tIhey will be. If 96u. have zat<br />
System tihi?_ h isj more econoraid th-A'n efficient. and if you 3. ncrec-DSe<br />
the amount of money which i. going to be available to the oralna 7y<br />
taxA paVyer, the ones with the hichnt propensity to consumia theyj<br />
will in fact, be able to buy maore poods and services in real tormc.<br />
If the commrunity as a whole is pAt in that position, then in ecozomic<br />
tenas thn busineos community will, bhe better of.<br />
MWLets take an isolz -ed pockegt, say an up markcet restaurant0<br />
which many people believe have e . isted on expens&amp;:-accountsz. Noty<br />
t-hey have got 121-% to add to thei Ir prices and they may have &amp; toaically<br />
decreased cuotomcrs.<br />
Well, Mike if you're sayin4 that looking at the Australian<br />
-tax system as a whole and trying 4to get a fairer system for avcragn<br />
Mr M-r s Australia where they are, paying or every mvarginal doilzir<br />
in tan, and where we are going tc; produce the situation vhere t~ kcy<br />
are $ 14 a w-, eek better off where pensions and social security people<br />
are going to ba better of that wp nhouldn't do those t~ lngG be-cauca<br />
we might hurt a few up market r-eskiaurants I tell you where I CM-;. e<br />
M N-o there iqs no suggestion o~ f that, I was asking if-you vo~ ild<br />
consider compensation for any butsinesses,-esecially s~ mall bus inc<br />
which you mnight out?<br />
More </p>
<p>PH 1) don't balieve that wo. tiilL wipe out cmall buzsinL--sen0. E<br />
in fact you've got the situation Theire those ulmarket restaUranto<br />
have been able to operabte on the :, asis that Imir and I. Irs Lvzge<br />
Australia is paying for their prop -ts through too much tax, and<br />
the poople on expcnse accouAits agibning able to go along thezo. at<br />
the cost to average Nr 1i-ro Aus ti: alia then, I bclieve, thzt the<br />
people who go al6ihg to Lhese upp-' r Ix., acket restau-cants that you<br />
tlUgabout tyill sitill b able o cvrvive be cauce oZ r-1,-<br />
x-ant to go there as they still wa\ It to then they will pay. ~~ sr<br />
in other countries where you have. , consumption tares and so on<br />
taxes on nervices, you still ; iave&amp; five star restaurants.<br />
You propose a form of death~ duty, I know it vill bc very ailci<br />
in the early yenrs,<br />
K-Uell that's your assertion 1its not a correct one.<br />
-W You are proposing that if silmeone dies there will be a ta~ n on<br />
the gain<br />
PI--I am scying that there f-rill ' be a capital gains tax w~ aich till<br />
not be a death duty.<br />
D I~ W Alright, I'll accept your wc rds, but if someone<br />
P14 Its not just m~ y word, its 4clear uinderstanding of znyono<br />
i nvolved in the tax system. * A ca ita1 gains tax on the part of : Zn<br />
estate which is, may I remind youp not on the nominal value of the3<br />
of whats going to bn subject to a ~ tax, but will be on real gainro, not<br />
juttaxng fo inflatn, that inot a death duty.<br />
Yes, look I urnderstand the jain, you are going to have a cu%.<br />
off point and you say tihatever qainz there are after this, les<br />
inrlation0that will be subjocted to this tax. A lot o'f peoL3iC<br />
undarstaiid that, as a lot of people understood the asscets test, b~ it<br />
U-you coul~ dn't dispel the spectre of the assets tes-t, how, will </p>
<p>you soll wha~ t will appear to inan people to be a form of Cdeath<br />
duty? PM Well, it * iill only appcar fpeople like yourself who knbetter<br />
keep referring to it as st ch. You knou its, iotr anad you<br />
would do a great dervice to the o~ sponsible debate in the crufunitvif<br />
it was described as a capita. : gains tax which it is, Wtts 1-h<br />
proposal and not a death duty. . u t let rae say thio, I have faith<br />
* in the capacity of the 21ustraliar community to loolk at this<br />
package as a whole . Let me rem nd you that virtually every other<br />
rmntry in the tWPqf-Prn 1* WrrMr hanI rajDital gains~ toy tllcW) I 1-iro i t<br />
not basically as a form of great:~ n nrosreeu acn<br />
but they have it bacause there i~ a realisAtion that it io c. necessary<br />
instumet i yo ar gong to hi~ ve a whole armoury availabet<br />
the coimunfty to help fight tax vodn( and evasion and its because<br />
I believe the community wants to istamp out tax avoidance and] evasion<br />
that they will accept that this ecry mild capital gains taX is<br />
appropriate to protect the community as a whole. Particularl. y w' en<br />
they know that it is not going tbe a capital gains tan which<br />
applies to the private home.<br />
11--Prime 14iiister its your qoxernment, this is what yourcyv:: ri<br />
want. Do you bclieve it will ha pen?<br />
PVI Well Mlichael, let me say t, is, that when I introduced this<br />
process during the last election cam~ paign I said there were 9<br />
princ.-3ples and the ninth and ina sense the most imyaortant<br />
principle wias this, that no tax. eforn proposal could b3 r'rohc<br />
into the community unless it had fairly broad co-.-vnunity acccptan!:. c.<br />
We have initiated a process in which the comm0unity is going t. o hawl%<br />
a great opportunity to be involv d in the debater the diccu!: sion,<br />
culminating in the sum7fmit. Ibojaieve Lhat the Co,. i. iunity w, 1.111<br />
6~ r 0 </p>
<p>see thiG basic point Miko and t. L s c-. A'at I a3% eGryv c o1 o I~ lY<br />
Vellow Australian ran and Womien tio cnderstand. Thc p2,-cnznt<br />
tax system is in decay and the p odccs of decay is hurting avcK. co<br />
E-Lr and l4Is Australia. A w-althyo Lcn person tho czan affodd tLo<br />
taxc accountant, the tax law-yer tq dodge and avoid is the ono whici<br />
is benefitd. Now I believe thaij oretinary t-fr A M Ao t~ aa Qnt.<br />
1 fairer system and a more eff-i dient system. I bakiiov that t 1 Y<br />
tiill reCpnd positively to this lproposal.<br />
iz~ j in short you are saying th~ t yo believe that this will<br />
rl -I helieve so because I do 1ave faith in the Australian pvublic.<br />
K -J Than% you very much Prime rLinister<br />
