7&gt; . CI<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
NEW AUSTRALIAN AID FOR HIVIAIOS PROJECTS IN AFRICA<br />
In the Commonwealth Action Program issued after today's CHOWM retreat at<br />
Queenstown, Commonwealth Leaders noted the threat which HIVIAIDS poses to<br />
large parts of the younger population of many Commonwealth countries and urged<br />
that further resources be committed to combating its spread.<br />
During this discussion, which I introduced, I announced an additional Australian Aid<br />
Program of $ 10 million over four years for HIV/ AIDS care and prevention in Africa.<br />
This funding is additional to the $ 7.8 million currently being spent on ten HlV/ AIDS<br />
prevention and care projects in southern and eastern Africa.<br />
The HIV/ AIDS pandemic is having a devastating human, social and economic<br />
Impact on Africa, which now has 70 per cent of the world's AIDS cases. In<br />
Zimbabwe alone, the Health Minister estimates that 100,000 people will die of<br />
AIDS over the next 18 months.<br />
International assistance and cooperation is an Integral part of Australia's national<br />
HIV/ AIDS strategy. We believe that Australia's experience and expertise,<br />
especially In AIDS education strategies can usefully be shared with other countries.<br />
Like existing Australian aid projects for HIV/ AIDS care and prevention. the new<br />
funding I have announced will be channelled through international organisations,<br />
Australian NGOs and indigenous groups.<br />
The additional resources will enable Australia to fund UNICEF initiatives in this<br />
area in South Africa and Kenya in addition to our support for current projects In<br />
Zimbabwe, Malawi and Namibia.<br />
They will also enable the continuation of core funding to the Southern African<br />
Network of AIDS Organisations ( SANASO), which links 100 NGO and community<br />
organisations involved in HI V/ AIDS prevention and care.<br />
Australian aid expenditure on HIVIAIDS projects to the end of 1995/ 96 is estimated<br />
at $ 53 million.<br />
