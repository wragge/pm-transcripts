LIBRN<br />
MR. MOORE: Eighteen months ago Mr. Holt became Prime Minister.<br />
And just a few days ago he returned from his fifth series of<br />
meetings with President Johnson and his third meeting with Mir.<br />
*. ilson. ell in mid-term, so to sneak Four Corners looks oack<br />
over the first eighteen months of Mr. Holt's office and examines<br />
his policies at home and auroad.<br />
Prime Minister, I think if one was tempted to give a<br />
label however brief, to your period of office it's very tempting<br />
to call you a " foreign affairs Prime Minister. Now what's your<br />
comment on that?<br />
PRIIM MINISTER: 7vWell, I've never lost sight of the importance<br />
of the home front. No politician certainly one who's been there<br />
as long as I have, can afford to do that unless people are finding<br />
themselves doing well through the economy, their social progress.<br />
They don't want the kind of government tnat can't give them these<br />
thins. But my interest in foreign affairs I think has been<br />
overlooked by neople who have seen me through seven years as<br />
Treasurer and have ignored the fact that I've been the first<br />
Australian to chair at least four significant international gatherings<br />
the snly Australian in respect of three of those.<br />
MOORE: . Hell, certainly, Sir, since you came to office<br />
you've probaoly done more in the foreign affairs field and had<br />
more newsoaper publicity about your doings in the foreign affairs<br />
field than any Prime Minister we've had.<br />
P. M. Yes well some of that is exnlained by the need<br />
to make direct personal contact with leaders like President Johnson<br />
and Prime Minister Harold ilson, and also what seemed to me to be<br />
Australia's increasing involvement in Asia made it necessary that<br />
I should spend a lot of time early in my period of office in some<br />
of these countries of such importance to us.<br />
MOORE: I wonder, Sir if I could get straight into that<br />
then now. It seems to me that although in some ways you've merely<br />
carried forward trends that were there before you came to the office<br />
of Prime iinister, what has happened since you ve been Prime<br />
Minister is what one might call a firmin o our priorities, and<br />
I would like to look at these. And the four priorities of our<br />
foreign policy that I'd like to look at in order are: our<br />
relations with the United States, with ritain, with the Commonwealth,<br />
and lastly in your own special interests so far, in Asia. Now, I<br />
wonder if we could look first of all at our relationships with the<br />
United States. It's been often stated by you and your Ministers<br />
that this is a corner-stone of our foreign policy, and in fact, in<br />
the last election a great deal was said about this and what has<br />
been mentioned repeatedly, and I'm sure you're sick of it, but I'd<br />
like to bring it up just again, is your phrase " All the way with<br />
LBJ". Now some of your critics have said that this meant a total<br />
commitment to the United States, but you've gone on to point out that<br />
you restricted this to America's policy in Vietnam. Now what I would<br />
like to ask you is, how far do we go with the United States, just<br />
how committed are we? / 2 </p>
<p>. ell, first I think we realise how much we have in<br />
common in our international oojectives. . e oelieve in much the<br />
same sort of society, world order, as the United Stites of America.<br />
The Unitei States has taken an increasing interest itself in the<br />
South East Asian and Pacific region and in the Asian region<br />
generally, much more so than earlier in its own history. Our<br />
association with the United States in, say SEATO, in ArZUS, these<br />
are powerful elements in australia's own security. Now quite rightly,<br />
as you say, I have used the phrase " All the way with LAJ' in<br />
relation to our involvement in Vietnam, because frankly I jelieve<br />
Australia has an even , reater stake in the outcome in Vietnam than<br />
has the United States.<br />
MOORE: Sir, sorry. Outside Vietnam how far do we go<br />
with L3J? ell, where our interests are in line one with<br />
the other, and in most things they are in line one with the other,<br />
that's an entirely realistic apnreciation. lut there are some<br />
directions. For example, we differ from them in that we've<br />
recognised Outer Mongolia. Ie have diplomatic relations with<br />
Cambodia. In fact, we represent American interests in Cambodia<br />
and Cambodian interests in South Vietnam, which makes us a pretty<br />
good bridge around that area.<br />
MOORE: Do you see any sorry, any division in American<br />
policy and Australian policy towars Communis China, say?<br />
P. M. I think not. '. e've had the same meneral attitude<br />
in relation to the recognition of Communist China. That doesn't<br />
mean zur minds are closed to this possibility, but it does mean that<br />
the conditions have to Je right, and there has to be an acceptance<br />
by China of certain international obligations, certain international<br />
codes of conduct. There also has to be, of course an arrangement<br />
which will assure the future of Taiiwan. out I dont think there's<br />
all that difference anyhow in the attitude of our two governments.<br />
MOORE: On the question of our trading with Communist<br />
China, say, is that a serious.....<br />
P. M. aell that is, that is a si: nificant point of<br />
difference. I've said in America that at some time there has to<br />
be an accommodation with China. It's unrealistic to imagine the<br />
world going on indefinitely with seven hundred million people kept<br />
as it were in coventry, but..... and trade, diplomatic exchanges<br />
cultural exchanges, the exchanes for sportin events, the visits<br />
by journalists and things of this sort can all help to build bridges<br />
. ut nothing more effectively so than trade.<br />
MOORE. Do you find that American leaders use this same<br />
kind of language when they talk about China, about the need for closer<br />
experience of each other<br />
P. M. I find they do nrivately, out the official policy<br />
of the Government, up to the nresent time, has not favoured trade.<br />
But I think there is trend anyhow in that direction.<br />
MOORE. INow, Sir, I wonder if we could look at the other<br />
side of our relations with the United States, the economic relations<br />
between the two countries? Now it's being suggested that in so far<br />
as it appears that the United Statos Government is bartering their<br />
tobacco for our wool in the tariff question that the United Jtates<br />
Government is not as sympathetic economically towards us as it might<br />
De in view of our overall alliance. :. hat's your comment on this?<br />
P. M. 4ell, once you get to trading questions you find<br />
domestic politics having a very big influence on the decisions of / 3 </p>
<p>the government. I ointed out quite vigorously in the United<br />
States, as I have here, that Australia is a very Pig purchaser<br />
of American ' oods I believe the most ranidly grovlng market<br />
that the United States has. I pointed out on my last visit that we<br />
buy ' 68 ner canita in velue of American goods and they buy less<br />
than ner cabita of Australian goods, and there's a very heavy<br />
balance of trade in their favour. I'm sure thtt in the President<br />
we have a friend who wishes to be helpful in these trade directions,<br />
but he, of course, has to look to a 3enate, and a Senate in which<br />
the smaller states, the rural rroducing states have just as much<br />
voting strength as a LC York Stacte r the Ste of California.<br />
And to the extent thau he can be helpful, I'm sure he will and<br />
that his administration could be helpful.<br />
MOOE. ell could I look at the, what I ima: ine are<br />
somewhat similar problems for yourself in Australia? gow do you,<br />
or is there a need for you, to wei'h un the desires of the<br />
Australian tobacco grower a : ainst The ustralian woolgrower? Is<br />
this a real problem for you?<br />
-ell, every nrimary industry is a real problem<br />
for us. I've been pointing this out in Englsand on their'Common<br />
Market application. It ma ue that it represents a small<br />
percenLa'Le relative of trace, but in a vast continent where you<br />
ave sca tered communities some derendent almost entirely on a<br />
particular form of production you can't treat any form of production<br />
as unesser: tial. Certainly it s essential to those people essential<br />
to the balanced develonment of the continent. So we pointed out in<br />
America, where it is the one country in the world industrialised<br />
that imposes a suostantial duty on raw wool. 3ut tobacco in certain<br />
districts of Australia is of importance to us. Jut even so we've<br />
been prepared to move a good way on tobacco to come to a deal with<br />
them.<br />
MOOirE. God. No-the last noint I'd like to deal ; ith<br />
in this area is our militar1 purchases from the United States. The<br />
Christian Science Uonitor tnis week su ested that the Australian<br />
Government was in danger of losin' coni-l1 of its overall budget,<br />
the argument being that such a sutstantial part of our overall<br />
budget is devoted to defence purchases from the United States<br />
which in a way are denendent on the cost structure of the United<br />
States over which you have no control, Now, what's your comment<br />
on this?<br />
P. M. I think this is a passing phase. You see we've<br />
doubled the defence vote and in the course of that there's been a<br />
very heavy equinping pro: raume, particularly for such thinrs as<br />
aircraft, destroyers, sutmarines wihich we're gettin. from the U. K.<br />
and th: re is this hs; . s e ouild up th. equipmcnt of th Syrvices.<br />
ut once . e've ' e min ud to -cquiru thseo things and . c'ro spr ading<br />
th2 p'yL. Jnts out ovcr lon period of years, thun I thinki there will<br />
be less prssure on us cerdnly on our overseas purch-. ses. It may<br />
inter: st you to know tA . t ustrin our. ch: ses for defnrce doubled in<br />
the lst twelve months. e are looking more to our hom,; Ti. rk; t for<br />
such thing-s As we can produce here.<br />
MOOR1. but in the American purch-se, Sir, are you worried<br />
at all about the apparent risini costs, and the fact that the costs<br />
have never seemed to oe identifiable in the F111 anid the Charles<br />
Adams destroyers?<br />
P. M. giell, of course it trou; les us but we can understand<br />
the difficulty that any country . which is an initiator of a particular<br />
defence weanon finds in statir, at all precisely the cost which<br />
will have to be paid. The United Kingdom is in the same nosition as<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>we are, and we are still satisfied that we are acquiring the best<br />
fighting aircraft in the world.<br />
MOORE. Now, Sir, I'd like to move on to our relations with<br />
the United Kingdom, with Dritain, at this stage what is your<br />
assessment of Britain's intentions Last of Suez?<br />
. ell, you asked first about our relations. I just<br />
want to make it clear that our relations with the United Kingdom<br />
fundamentally remain unaltered they're uasic. They're a<br />
relationship of kinship, of mutual interest and re ard and those<br />
relations remain fundamentally unaltered. But if the U. K. enters<br />
the Common Ma1rket that must affect the emphasis it places on its<br />
dealings with the rest of the Commonwealth, and if it removes its<br />
military presence substantially l: ast of Suez. That must have some<br />
bearing, too, on the degree of intimacy of the relationship and the<br />
closeness of our cooperation together. So that when you ask me<br />
now what my assessment is of their intentions there is no doubt that<br />
Britain intends a substantial wJithdrawal of forces phased over a<br />
period of years. One o-the question marks has been whether it<br />
will retain a oresence, and I don't want to -o t-o deeoly into the<br />
outcome of my bwn discussions in the United ingdom and they're<br />
taking Cabinet decisions on those matters over the next week or so.<br />
But I like to think that the United Kin dom will retain a presence<br />
in the Singanore/ Malays ian area and that there will be continuing<br />
co-operation between Australia, New Zealand, and other Commonwealth<br />
forces with the United Kingdom there.<br />
MOORE. Sir, assuming tha-t a presence in some form does<br />
remair there, but on the other hand that there is a substantial<br />
reduction of forces, what should ue the policy of the Australian<br />
Government? I mean, would we be tempted to try to fill the vacuum<br />
so created in terms of manpo'wer and equipment or is there some<br />
alternative policy completely for us?<br />
P. M. Yes. Iell first, perhans we should make it clear in<br />
relation to the reduction of forces that there was a bi. build-up<br />
of British forces to meet the confrontation issue, and everybody<br />
knew that after confrontation there would je a run down. The ouestion<br />
is to what degree, and how soon that run down occurs. Now Ausfralia<br />
and New Zealand would naturally expect that as they grow in population<br />
and economic strength they will ue playing an increasing part in<br />
contributing to the security of the area. But the details of this<br />
have yet to be worked out. Clearly they can't be worked out until<br />
we know firmly what the British intentions are.<br />
MOORE. How soon would you expect to know firmly enough to<br />
make a decision?<br />
F. M. U. ell, I'd exnect us to know their broad intentions<br />
within a matter of veeks.<br />
MOORE. Before our Budget?<br />
F. M. Yes, out I wouldn't say that it would have a bearing<br />
on the forthcoming Budget because there s no intention on the part<br />
of the United Kingdom, on anybody's , art in their Government so far<br />
as I can discover, to run their forces down so rapidly that we have<br />
to have a dramatic chan-e. I w7ould hope to see a review say 1970, 71<br />
of their position. I t ink it's unwise to commit yourself too far<br />
ahead in this changing world. </p>
<p>OORE. Sir th is week oth,, Tun Abdt 1 R azak and Lee Kuan Yew<br />
hPave called for Autralis and iNew Zeland to have disoussions with<br />
MJalaysia and Singapore in an endeavour to, I think build up some<br />
consortium of forces to replace an eventual British withdraiwal.<br />
How seriously does your Government take this possibility?<br />
. e look to a growing-contribution by the countries<br />
of the area themselves to their own security and I think they accept<br />
this. At the same time Australia and Zealand wweouwl d form part,<br />
I would believe, of ny general security arran3ement made in<br />
relation to the area, just as I would inmaine the United States<br />
would, and other countries wvho h: ive indic-ted support around<br />
the area in the p1st. But wie can't be precise on the details of<br />
this. I've already said we would exnect to have to make a rowing<br />
contribution to security in the area as a whole. But in Asia at<br />
this time there's a meetin; of kASPAC, nine countries are rre sented<br />
there, and they all have an interest in the security of the area.<br />
MOORE. Sir, now I'd like to tarn rather more briefly<br />
to our relations with the Commonwealth, the iritish Commonwealth.<br />
You were reported as saying that at the Prime Ministers' Conference<br />
last year you were disannointed that so much more time was given up<br />
to Rhodesia than to Vietnam, and you went on to give your reasons<br />
why. Now this could be looked ait in one of two ways. Either we're<br />
out of step with the Commonvelth, or the Commonwealth is out of<br />
step with us. Now , RAhich is it?<br />
th t. ell, we had an eight day conference scheduled. Six<br />
days the first six days, were devoted entirely to Rhodesia. It<br />
wasn t just the dispronortion of time to Vietnam, it was the<br />
disproportion of time to the affairs of the remaining nine tenths<br />
of human kind, and this is where I made my protest. I said,<br />
having re ard to the time avlilable to us, we ought to be turnin<br />
to some ot these other questions, including Vietnam, which wasn'<br />
merely of interest to Australia. After all Ualaya, ialaysia,<br />
oingapore were also represented there and the United I( in; dom has<br />
an interest, although not militarily involved, in the outcome.<br />
1MOOiE. . ell in view of this obvious difference within the<br />
Common-: eulth as to the priorities of Rhodesia and Vietnam last year<br />
anyway, in view of this and the possibility that this could continue,<br />
will you in fact attend another Prime Ministers' Conference?<br />
P. M. Yes been a Commonwealth man all my<br />
public life. I do hold the view that the modern Commonwealth is likely<br />
to have less emphasis in our planning and policy making in the future<br />
than the old Commonwealth did in the nast w1here we were able to come<br />
towether pretty closel on matters of'policy. ut the concept of a<br />
muTti-racial Commonwealth is worth preserving. After all, if fe<br />
can't cooperate usefully and constructively Ã± or neaceful purnoses<br />
at any rate, then what prosnect is there for the United 1Natins?<br />
MOORE. Do you feel there is enough for us to have in cotimon<br />
to make up for the oovious aisag; reement over the importance of<br />
Vietnam md all that means?<br />
P. M. Yes, and I do know that the countries of Africa in<br />
particular, and some of the newer Commonwealth countries attacA great<br />
importance to their membership of it.<br />
MOOpRE. ood Sir. Iow I'd like to move on to Asia if I could<br />
briefly again first You've sugested t-hat in talking about asia, and<br />
you visited ten countries there, thit it's a mistake to see Asia as a<br />
unity. That in a sense, it's merely a geographical expression. That<br />
/ 6 </p>
<p>there are as, in fact, s many Asias is there are countries and as<br />
many Asian opinions as there ire countries. This would su_ est<br />
tha in turn we should have not so much an Asian policy bui a<br />
number of Asian policies directed towards specific countries.<br />
Now your critics su est, though that on the whole we have only<br />
one and that is tht our Asian policy is our Vietnam policy.<br />
. ihat's your comment on that?<br />
P. M. :: ell, first of all, we do have a number of policies in<br />
relation to individual countries. I didn't mean we have different<br />
policies for the same country. But our policy with Cambodia,<br />
which is neutral and tends to the Socialist camp; with Laos,<br />
which is neutral but tends to the . estern camn that is a very<br />
different line of policy, say, to what we have in Taiwan, what<br />
we have in Korea, certainly to what we have in Vietnam. but<br />
all of these countries have marked dissimilarities, even of<br />
physical appearance certainly of rolicy attitudes. This is<br />
Why I've stressed that we've got to get ourselves into the frame<br />
of mind thit there are greater differences of policy, of physical<br />
apnearance, of general mental and social attitude to be found<br />
there than there are in Europe, for example. just don't think<br />
of the Europeans as the same sort of people.<br />
MOOE. Could I put this argument another way then? I think<br />
what is often suggested by your critics is that our policies are<br />
much oetter defined towards the smaller, perhaps more vulnerable<br />
and dependent countries in the area than bur policies are defined<br />
towards the oigger boys Japan and Indonesia and so on. The<br />
argument goes on to say ': ell, the ra:: son why we take so specific<br />
an interest in the smalier dependent countries is because it suits<br />
our Vietnam policy, and the argument then roes on to say that it's<br />
about time that we took a more detailed policy towa rds Japan and<br />
Indonesia.<br />
P. M. ', ell, of course, we do have tery detailed policies with<br />
Japan out these are princioally on the trade side because Japan<br />
hasn't been involved in defence or military ore-oaration over recent<br />
years. but Vietnam looms so large for us, not merely because we re<br />
helping to safeuard a small country which is under agressive attack<br />
or errorism, subversion and matters of that sort. This is important,<br />
but it's not the fundamental thing aoout the Vietnam conflict. '. hat<br />
is fundamental there is the shape of Asia, indeed the shar. e of the<br />
free world for the future. If you were to have a Communist domain,<br />
nbt necessarily a Chinese Communist domain but a Communist domain<br />
as we very well might have had if we hadn't intervened in Korea and<br />
then followed that up by the intervention in Vietnam. If you'd<br />
h-d that right down through South-East Asia from China southlwards,<br />
and Derhais even penetrating as I'm sure it would have if the checks<br />
hadn't been apnlied, into Indonesia, then it would have been a very<br />
different kind of world with which we'd oe dealing in the years to<br />
come. . hat we are doing here by these policies is allo. independent<br />
countries to develoo their resources, to ;. in economic growth, to<br />
co-operite. I mentioned ASPC, there was a shining example. -C. FS,,<br />
the Asian Development oink. In a variety of ways the countries of<br />
Asia are co-operating in a manner they've never done through the<br />
centuries.<br />
MOOiE. This week, Sir, Mr. C: uot Lodge was reported as saying<br />
that United States troons could ue in Vietnam for ahot er 25 years.<br />
Do you think Australian trooos should be?<br />
P. M. ', ell, a lot of people speculate. Some say it's all<br />
going to oe over in 2 years, some say another thing. I don't think<br />
anyoody can say with firmness because it's not merely a military<br />
result which will determine this. I've maintained all along that / 7 </p>
<p>a military result will not Je sufficient of itself. It would leave<br />
the way cpen for continuing 6uerilla campaign of the sort we had<br />
to face in IEalaysia.<br />
MOORE. But is the figure of 20 or 25 more ye-rs i ridiculous<br />
one, do you think?<br />
P. M. I would certainly hope it w-; s quite unrealistic. But I<br />
do remember that it took us 15 years to clean up the situation in<br />
Malaysia and tha-t w: s far less extensive, much less complex. On<br />
the other hand, the forces involved were very much smaller than is the<br />
case in Vietnam. No I think the Iorth Vietnamese will find the cost<br />
too heavy much earlier than that, and quite apa-rt from the military<br />
results obtained, there will oe a r-alisation at some point of time<br />
and who can say when, when they decide the game is not worth the candle.<br />
MOOIL. NIow, Sir, I'd like to come at last home to domestic<br />
affairs. It seems to me that this ear, more than any other year<br />
there is a crisis in at least the thinking about CommonwealthState<br />
relttions in Australia. That the federation is under more critical<br />
andlysis than evsr before, nd there are some su gestions that in<br />
fact federation his broken down, in fact, in astralia. That the<br />
St tes are simply the financial i -ents ind none too efficient at<br />
thit, of the Commonelth. Now, how stands the federation.<br />
P. M. : ell, you're speaking a week after a Premiers' nference,<br />
: nd the Loan council meetings, and that's never really the uest time<br />
to . e calmly anailysing the st lte of Commonqealth/. 3tate rel. tions,<br />
because as you know w. e go through these motions each time a-nd certain<br />
results occur. I've found some papers now which sa-id we were too<br />
tight-fisted to begin with and, when they've anal sed what hanpened<br />
last week saying that the ommonwealth h's provide too much mney for<br />
the States. 3o that's a matter of judgment. 3ut could I come really<br />
to the crux of ohat you're saying? I believe in a federal system.<br />
I believe thit in a country as vast n-ird sparsely settled as hustralia<br />
ou must have some decentralised activity of government and rather<br />
han have this come through a jottleneck in Canoerra, it's better that<br />
each State should h: ve its ol.' n governmental odministr.; tion. But there<br />
should ee then close co-operation with the central administration, and<br />
far from the federation breakin. down this is growing as I could point<br />
out in a number of specific insTarnces.<br />
MOORE. * ut isn't one of thie chtr'es made that in fact there is<br />
now a bottle-neck in Canberra, that it's just a matter of bad nujlic<br />
administra: tion to h: ave one overnment collectin taxes and another<br />
government spending it? . ho's responsible for what?<br />
I don't think that creates the cottle-neck. 2ottle-necks<br />
develo out of policy not out of rroviding the funds for neople.<br />
Each St te can make 1 s own -olicies. But there is this much point<br />
in what you're putting, that the electorate is demanding a muc<br />
greater Commonwealth particination in matters which were formally<br />
urely matters within'the constitutional province of the states.<br />
alth, educ . tion, and matters of that sort, 1which were primarily<br />
St. te matters are now regarded as ceing directly of interest for<br />
the Commonealth. Ard, indeed, we're nrnviding vTst sums -s you know<br />
in both these directions. i<br />
S 3But isn't nart of the trouile too that the electorate<br />
or some elements of it, are wanting to know which government do they<br />
blame for either as they reird, inadequrate services or, on the other<br />
hand, increased taxes?<br />
. ell, in my exnaerience they know which government to ./ 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
blame. It's al: avs the Commonwealth Government, because they say<br />
the Commonwealth Government's got the money and the State Governments<br />
aren't slow to point out to tiose who importune them that they can't<br />
provide the money because the Commonwealth won't give it to them.<br />
But I think thoughtful people appreciate that a Federal system is<br />
necessary in this continent. And it's up to us to make it work, and I<br />
would assure you that we do that in very many directions. There are<br />
conferences at the Ministerial level on a scale which never existed before<br />
in different departments of Government.<br />
MOORE. Sir, now I wonder if we could turn to a orief -ccount of<br />
your Parliamentary record since you've been Prime Minister? The<br />
first thing about it, of course, is the undoubted triumph at the<br />
last Federal election, your first election as Prime iMinister when<br />
you came back with a record majority and that's an undouDt-d<br />
riumph in anyone's terms. On the other hand, since then some<br />
peole are detecting some black clouds on the horizon and I'd like<br />
to go very quickly through the three which normally stand out, and<br />
ask for your comments on them. First of all the fact that you<br />
at present have a reuellious, to put it mildly, Senate. People are<br />
suggesting that this shows a less of control by the Government over<br />
the Government's business. Your comment on that.<br />
P. M. Jell, first we have a minority in the Senate. e lost<br />
by death two Senators which we couldn't replace on the rresent electoral<br />
system. So we are in a minority in any event. Secondly, the Labor<br />
Party regiments it vote in th-e enate. Our Senators try to behave<br />
as they think Senators should and occasionally depart from the<br />
policies of rovernment. out taking in view the fact.....<br />
MOORE. But you do have some rebellious Senators of your own?<br />
P. M. W ell, I don't know what your definition of rebellious is.<br />
There are one or two I think wvho interoret their indenendent role<br />
rather toe lioerally for themselves. But enerall sneaking<br />
the Senators support the Government, but leave to themselves the right<br />
to dissent where they think this is justified. If the Labor Senators<br />
would behave in the same spirit the Senite would work much more along<br />
the lines that it was intended to work. Jut of course theirs is a<br />
regimented vote. but while you have the pro'ortional basis of voting<br />
for the Sen-te there will always be a trouble for governments from<br />
an almost evenly divided Senate.<br />
MO RE. You don't feel that it would have been po sible for the<br />
Government to have negotiated a w:: ay through its problem in the Senate?<br />
I mean, is it the mere fact that you are in a minority or could you<br />
have with some more diplomacy, or finesse, or whatever the word is,<br />
achieved your end?<br />
P. M. ; ell, there are not many matters of major moment that the<br />
Senate has prevented us from putting through. You've had the recent<br />
instance of the postal charges, out that raises other issues and I'm<br />
not surprised th:. t Mr. Calwell got very angry at ; what he regarded as<br />
a breach of L'oor practice and principle on this matter.<br />
MOORE. Sir, could I now turn to the Vozyaer debate, where it's<br />
sometimes been suggested that this showed that the Party had lost some<br />
of its control over its members, and you were reported saying,<br />
admittedly only reported as saying, that you were led to say, tat you<br />
would rather lead a solid Party of 20 than a rajule of 00. Now did<br />
you say anything like that?<br />
P. M. This was not in relttion to the Voyager matter. Jut I would<br />
say it iwas over that general . eriod but not in relation to that, oh no.<br />
/ 9 </p>
<p>It T5s on the occasion though, wasn't it?<br />
No I didn't object at all to the line tken by<br />
our own mnembers on the Voyager matter, and I think I can say quite<br />
fairly that on the morning on which I armounced the Government's<br />
decisions to the House, Ye h-d a snecial Party meeting and I've<br />
never known the party more united than it was at tha-t point of time.<br />
I ias very haprpy with the atmosphere in the Party.<br />
MOORE. That wasn't on the morning on which you were<br />
reported to have said.....<br />
P. M. No. No.<br />
MOORE. ! lell, now the Nexus iReferendum and its defeat.<br />
Did you take this is a Personal affront to your position as<br />
Prime Minister? 1o more so than I took the nine to one vote for<br />
the ARori ines proposals as an overwhelming endorsement of the<br />
Government. No, peoole voted, I think the vote on the Nexus was<br />
not based on very solid information and revealed a prejudice<br />
against more politicians. That was the cry that was put up, although<br />
in substance it was likely to have just the reverse effect.<br />
MOORE. You don't sea it then : s in any . ay a defict for a<br />
Prime inister th-it he can't carry a referendum in wihich he h s the<br />
support of the Leader of the Opposition?<br />
P. M. ell, a lot of Prime inisters would feel. themselves<br />
rebuffed if they took that attitude. There have -en very few<br />
refe-endum nroposals adopted throunh the histo of the Federation<br />
but ,7e felt we hd to give the pu ic the onnor unity of deciding this<br />
before we tackled the task of redistrioution. The vital t-ask because<br />
the electorates are so ill . ala; nced even in the same State and in the<br />
same city areas.<br />
MOORE. Now, Sir could we turn very briefly to relations<br />
between the Coailition Farties. Low a lot of peodle lot of thins<br />
have ceen said recently nd headlines made about an alle., ed rift<br />
within the Party and it's often su,, gested that the Liberal Party is<br />
out to et rid of the Country Party and rule in its own right. Now,<br />
what's in this? ell, nothing as far as I'm concerned, because it's<br />
my own pelief that as far thead zs I can see there should oe in the<br />
interests of good government in Australia a coalition oetween the<br />
Liberal Party and The Country Party. I've made this quite cleair to<br />
my colleagues and to Mr. cwen. Mr. McEwen and I are old colleaues<br />
we've been together in Parliament for more than thirty years. ve<br />
been in governments together for just on twenty years as fellow<br />
Ministers, and we can usually sort our way through our problems. 3ut<br />
we're competitors for votes let's face it, we're separite Parties,<br />
we're out to get the best of what we can for the electorate and they<br />
are, and they have a difficult problem in a neried in ' which the urban<br />
growth is tending to outstrip the rural : rowth of maintaining cn<br />
identity and I can understand some of te thin. s that go on inside<br />
the Coun ry Party.<br />
WMORL. And inside the Liberal Party? Are there no tensions<br />
there? P. M. ell ag'ain vie are competitors and some Liberals<br />
of course, tend to take more extreme views of where we should stand<br />
in relation to thle Country Party than others, but over the whole field,<br />
MO * RE </p>
<p>-1<br />
rjlations are as good and -hen you trace it back over the period of<br />
the coalition, I think remarkabl good and may I just conclude<br />
on that by sayin I find in nrac ice I have fewer problems arise in<br />
relations with te Country "&gt; rty than I do with some of my colleagues<br />
in what is non a very large Libera. l Party.<br />
MOORE. Sir at the beginning of this discussion I sugjested<br />
that one mi-ht descrioe you as a " Foreign Aff irs" Prime Minister. If<br />
it was put To you, how would you de3cri e government Holt-style?<br />
P. M. I don't think there should be a smecial emphasis placed<br />
on neople's view as to foreign affairs or home a-ffairs. I've said<br />
at the outset what hlipens on the home front is vital and overwhelmingly<br />
important but placedias Australia is, of course, so do our foreign<br />
policies become of great importnce to us. but if you ask me what<br />
is my general approach.<br />
MOORE. .; hat is your style of government? How would you<br />
surmarise it?<br />
P. M. ell, I put it to President Johnson that I tried to<br />
be firm fair forthrifhtfand friendly if you like a fair deal<br />
Government. Ae told me that his objectives were rogress reace and<br />
prosperity I said 11, let's marry them together, and we've ot<br />
it made", and I would descrioe m own approach in those terms an<br />
I think you avoid a , reat deal o the complexity of government when<br />
people accept you as bein fair and understand that you'll be firm<br />
and forthright, but also now tAt you'll be trying to be friendly.<br />
MOORE. rime Minister, thank you for giving us your time.<br />
P. H. Thank you. </p>
