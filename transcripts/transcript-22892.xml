<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what range of emotions does a Prime Minister experience on a night like tonight?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, a tremendous pride that our country is hosting this magnificent event. It is a wonderful occasion for all Australians, for all Australians, but it is also a wonderful occasion for the world because the Olympic Games brings young men and women from all corners of the world together, may the Games be contested vigorously and strongly but in the true spirit of sportsmanship, and to those 628 wonderful young men and women representing Australia, you will have 19 million Aussies cheering their heads off for you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Could Australia be better showcased than tonight, right here?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it is certainly marvellous, and itâs great and I hope the whole country enjoys it. Good luck.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have a good night, thank you.</p>
