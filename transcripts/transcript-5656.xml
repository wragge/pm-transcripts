EMBARGO: 6: 00 pm<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY,' 2' 7 SEPTEMBER,* 1981<br />
ADDRESS TO THE NATION<br />
During the next few days, the leaders of 41 countries<br />
will be arriving in Australia to attend the.<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. This meeting is<br />
held once every two years, -and this, will be the first time<br />
ever that Australia has acted as host.<br />
In recent years these conferences have been held in places<br />
as dispersed as Zambia, Britain, Canada, Jamaica and Singapore.<br />
Now it is the turn of the Pacific and of Australia.<br />
These leaders will be comifng from'" a' 11 parts of the world: from<br />
Africa and Europe, from North America and the Caribbean, from<br />
the Indian sub-continent, from South East Asia and the Pacific.<br />
They will represent an enormously diverse range of countries:<br />
countries as old as Britain and As new as Vanuatu and Belize;<br />
as populous as India with its 700 million and as small as some<br />
of the island states who number their people by the thousand.<br />
The leaders of some of the richest countries in the world, as<br />
well as some of the poorest, will be present. Together they<br />
will represent a quarter of the people living on this earth.<br />
How important it is for them may be gauged from-the fact<br />
that they are prepared to allocate a whole week of their time:<br />
for it. There is no other international meeting of any kind<br />
which brings together so many Heads of Government for so loncf.<br />
It will be a week of hard work on serious issues.-issues of<br />
the utmost importance to Australia.<br />
Of outstanding importance is the need to improve relations<br />
between the developed and the developing countries of the world,<br />
and to alleviate world poverty. Over a thousand million people<br />
in the worlid have an annual income of less than $ 200 Australi~ an.<br />
I ask you to reflect on what this means. It means constant<br />
hunger and, for many, starvation. It means living without any<br />
of the normal services which you and I take for granted; water<br />
supplies, roads, electric power, medical services, education<br />
and decent housing. It means living without hope. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
These conditions result not only in great hardship; they also.<br />
cause instability and tension, and they-frustrate the economic<br />
advancement of the whole world. For Australia, changing them is<br />
not only a matter of humanitarian concern, but one of self-interest<br />
enlightened self-interest. You cannot have a stable world while<br />
poverty on this scale endures. Economic take-off in the<br />
developing world would also provide more markets for the products<br />
of the developed world.<br />
Our approach to these matters at the conf erence will be specific!<br />
and practical. We shall be discussing proposals to deal with the<br />
problems of food and energy, of trade and aid. And we shall be<br />
working to mobilise the international political will necessary<br />
for progress.<br />
The conference will also be discussing questions related to<br />
southern Africa. Africa may seem far away to some, but if this<br />
century has taught us anything,. it has taught us that seemingly<br />
remote conflicts, unless attended to it time, can threaten the<br />
peace of the world and cost Australian lives. We have learnt<br />
bitter lessons about the danger of things just being allowed to<br />
take their course, lessons carved on the honour rolls of every<br />
Australian city and country town.<br />
The largest single group Gf.. . t. ries-i -th--nomonwealt r hsfrom<br />
Africa. Their history has been polluted and poisoned by<br />
racialism, which deems men inferior or superior according to the<br />
colour of their skins and nothing else. Let us be clear and frank<br />
about this. We are no-t talking simply about racial prejudice as<br />
a social fact. That is bad enough and it is deplorable that it<br />
exists to some extent in most countries. But whereas we and most<br />
other civilised states seek to combat such prejudice, and even -to<br />
compensate for it by positive discrimination in favour of the<br />
disadvantaged, in South Africa the whole weight of the state and<br />
of the law is used to perpetuate it and to strengthen it. That<br />
of course, is a fundamental difference.<br />
Namibia takes on special significance in this context, because it<br />
is South Africa, the home of apartheid, which is frustrating its<br />
independence. That frustration must end and I have no doubt that<br />
the conference will want to advance the course of Namibian<br />
independence. This conference is of vital importance to us in another respect.<br />
Australia on the edge of the Pacific, has paid a great deal of<br />
attention -to the newly independent island states. These face<br />
special probl , ems: isolation, smallness, scarce physical resources<br />
and a shorta~ ie of human skills and experience. Despite their best<br />
efforts these factors make progress hard. Many cannot afford to<br />
maintain embassies throughout the world and their contacts are<br />
therefore limited. This meeting will give them an opportunity to have<br />
their views heard, to have other people understand their needs and'<br />
priorities. It is appropriate that a meeting held in the Pacific<br />
and in Australia should do so. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
From what I have said I think you can see the importance that<br />
Australia attaches to the Commonwealth is not a matter of sentiment,<br />
of habit or historical loyalty. I say again, it is a matter of<br />
enlightened self-interest. In the Commonwealth, there is an<br />
instrument which we, together with our fellow members, can use to<br />
combat the elements of insecurity, instability and conflict in the<br />
world. We have an obligation to our nation and to our children to<br />
,, see that it is so used.<br />
With this particular conference the Commonwealth assumes an added<br />
importance for us as a nation. The conference will bring some 2,000<br />
people to the conference centre at the Exhibition Buildings,<br />
including delegations and officials, from Commonwealth countries,<br />
and correspondents from all parts of the world. Many of these<br />
would never. come here but for this conference.<br />
I know there are some inconveniences. We have tried to explain the<br />
problems with traffic. You undT;; rstand -the need for security and.<br />
these are needs that cannot be avoided in this modern world. we<br />
already know that Australia is not immune from terrorist attack and<br />
we have to take every possible precaution. But I ask you to bear<br />
with us for the few days of the conference, knowing that we are doing<br />
everything we can to minimise the inconvenience.<br />
During this time, there will be an internationa. spotlight turned on<br />
US. Journalists will not just be reporting on the conference,' they<br />
will be reporting on Australia: what they see of it and think of:<br />
its people, what their feelings are about Melbourne and Canberra.<br />
The conference facilities that will be provided will be as good aLs,<br />
if not better than, those provided for any Commonwealth conference.<br />
But the way visitors are treated in their contact with Australiansin<br />
hotels, shops, taxis and restaurants; speaking to Australian<br />
journalists, or just asking for help in the street will be at<br />
least as imortant in determining what impressions they will carry<br />
with them when they leave Australia.<br />
Melbourne, in particular, will be Australia's front window on this<br />
occasion. it is indeed a great opportunity for a great city and I<br />
am sure Melbourne will do Australia proud.<br />
I know you will see this occasion as a great opportunity for<br />
Australia; an opportunity to convey to the world that we are a<br />
friendly and aware people who genuinely believe in the equality of<br />
nations. I hope it is an occasion you all feel a part of and take<br />
pride in. 000---</p>
