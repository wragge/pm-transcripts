TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH THE HON KIM<br />
BEAZLEY, MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS,<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE 8 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: I'll just make a few comments and then be available for<br />
question. I think in this area of telecommunications<br />
perhaps more than any other industry illustrates the<br />
commitment of this Government, because there's no doubt it's<br />
the industry of the 21st century and it's quite clearly one<br />
that's going to boom in our region. The decisions that<br />
we ' ye taken are going to have a very considerable impact on<br />
the AustraliLan economy as they'll first make our own<br />
domestic telecommunication industry significantly more<br />
efficient and that in turn must have a beneficial effect on<br />
all of our industries. It will certainly equip us to<br />
compete internationally for business in this very rapidly<br />
expanding market. It will encourage investment in a clever<br />
country industry and without question is going to bring<br />
massive private capital investment and its associated<br />
technical expertise into Australia. I think it's beyond<br />
argument that the changes that are involved in what I've<br />
announced today represent the most substantial reform to any<br />
industry in the history of this country. The benefits for<br />
consumers that will flow from the changes that have been<br />
announced are significant and numerous. It's anticipated,<br />
as I said irt the Statement, there'll be an up to forty<br />
percent reduction in STD prices on major trunk routes.<br />
There'll be the most rapid possible access to new<br />
technologies, their choice of telephone company, with better<br />
service quality and a quicker response for telephone repair.<br />
Overall, what it will mean will be a greater choice f or<br />
Australian consumers. Now obviously what we've had to<br />
announce in telecommunications is the most important of the<br />
announcements that we've made. And I think it is<br />
significant to understand the range of the areas of the<br />
economy that have been covered in the Statement as well as<br />
telecommunications which permeates the whole of our economy.<br />
We've announced the development of reforms in the aviation<br />
industry, rail, road and developments in the waterfront in<br />
the shipping area. So you can see that here is a further<br />
delivery by the Government of reform, which when you strip<br />
all the jargon away which is associated with some of these<br />
discussions, simply means as I said in the Parliament that<br />
the Government is delivering on reform which will mean<br />
better, more efficient, cheaper services for consumers and </p>
<p>will create the infrastructure which will enable Australian<br />
industry to be more competitive and more efficient. Kim, do<br />
you want to say anything<br />
BEAZLEY: I'd just add a few things to what the Prime<br />
Minister's had to say particularly in the telecommunications<br />
area. You have a fairly good explanation before you I think<br />
in the book. But I think on any objective test that the<br />
implementation of these reforms would see probably the most<br />
competitive telecommunications industry anywhere. There are<br />
enormous barriers to entry for competitors in the<br />
telecommunications industry and what this has done is to<br />
address those barriers to introduce a competitor, it has<br />
done a great deal more than that. There is a very<br />
substantial liberalisation in the area of the establishment<br />
of private networks and because of that unlimited resale<br />
option. With an immediate lifting of the limitations on<br />
that in the area of common interest group network resale.<br />
There is as many competitors in the cellular mobile area as<br />
the technology will efficiently take, as Austel has talked<br />
about, with the provision for a review on that in 1995 if<br />
technologies tell us that more can be done in that area.<br />
And in the area of cordless telephones there is unlimited<br />
licensing provision associated with it. There isn't any<br />
country that in practical terms permits this level of<br />
competition across the board. Go to the United States local<br />
loop they are still monopolies. You go to Japan and they<br />
talk about tier two carriers where there's competition in<br />
Japan a tier two carrier is a private network, what we would<br />
mean by a private network. This is the most, in practical<br />
terms, the most competitive set of arrangements. In New<br />
Zealand they've privatised Telecom but there is no capacity,<br />
there's no legal, there's no system which brings into play<br />
equal access and the price arrangements associated with<br />
that. So that until that happens competition is meaningless<br />
and that is so for a number of other areas which are<br />
ostensibly deregulated. I think there really is a<br />
requirement to get a detailed comprehension of this to<br />
understand the extent to which this is really a very<br />
substantial set of reforms.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, what sort of consortium have you<br />
envisaged going into the third mobile licence and could they<br />
by foreign owned?<br />
BEAZLEY: It's difficult at this stage to tell. I think the<br />
basic objective of the Government in all these areas, which<br />
was portrayed at the Federal Conference of the Labor Party,<br />
is to secure over time major Australian ownership. That<br />
would apply to the additional competitor in regard to<br />
cellular mobile licences as well as to the second entrant.<br />
What we're really going to establish over the next five or<br />
six months or so prior to the conclusion of the legislative<br />
process in Parliament which is when we're going to be able<br />
to go finally to tender, via a process of expressions of<br />
interest and then request for proposals, exactly what is the<br />
nature of the interest in the marketplace in what we are<br />
doing. And of course we will be watching very closely and </p>
<p>the sorts of~ bids that come in and the sorts of views that<br />
are expressead to us, and even more closely when we go into<br />
the tender phase, the capacity of would-be competitors to<br />
Australianise themselves and what are the cost penalties<br />
involved in Australianising themselves at a particular pace.<br />
So we, in this area, it is enormously complex. What we can<br />
do is give answers in way stations, if you like. This is a<br />
very big way station but I think you will see as you read<br />
this, there's an awful lot still being subject to review in<br />
order for us to establish clarity to move to the next phase.<br />
And we require more dialogue, I believe, with the people who<br />
are interested in this process before we could give<br />
definitive answers to that type of question.<br />
JOURNALIST: two additional mobile phone licences and<br />
won't that have the impact of reducing the income stream for<br />
the potential competitor to Telecom and therefore reduce the<br />
potential for competition?<br />
BEAZLEY: Two additional can be a little bit misleading.<br />
One of course will be held by the network competitor, so<br />
it's one on top of that. It has, yes it has a capacity to<br />
reduce the price of the competitor to the Government.<br />
There's no question of that, but there will be a load of<br />
other factor7S involved in making that calculation. The<br />
Department of Finance is currently going through the terms<br />
and conditions on which we ought to be selling Aussat and<br />
we'll be taking into account all these sorts of factors in<br />
arriving at what we would consider a reasonable reserve<br />
price so to speak. But on the other hand, as it<br />
simultaneously reduces the value in one sense of the<br />
competitor, it also of course creates another value in<br />
itself, and that's not being issued for free. And I would<br />
think that on the swings and roundabouts it would end up not<br />
to our disadvantage.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you have any idea what the impact of that<br />
and opening up resale will have on the value of Aussat?<br />
BEAZLEY: There are mixed views on the issue of resale.<br />
Resale conducted effectively by the carriers are seen by<br />
some of them as a very good way of making better use of<br />
their own network. It depends very much at the price at<br />
which that iLs delivered. I have noted in my discussions<br />
with would-be competitors of Telecom a very mixed attitude.<br />
Some have said they don't want any form of private network<br />
resale, some of them think it's a terrific idea it would<br />
enable them to enhance the value of their investment. We<br />
want to ensure that resale does operate in such a manner<br />
that allows the competition to take place effectively.<br />
Hence Austel, as you will note from these documents, has a<br />
requirement on it to go away and take a look at this to<br />
ensure that what does emerge from resale enhances overall<br />
the introduction of network competition.<br />
JOURNALIST: What reaction do you, expect from the unions to<br />
the decision to completely open up the network from 1997? </p>
<p>BEAZLEy: I think there has always been an assumption around<br />
for some considerable time that the duopoly has to conclude<br />
at some period. We're talking about two Parliaments away.<br />
I don't cont~ end for one moment the unions agree with these<br />
decisions. They made their position amply clear at the<br />
Federal Conference of the Labor Party on what their views<br />
were and beforehand and have done so since. I think that<br />
they would continue to maintain those views.<br />
JOURNALIST: So how could you guarantee that the<br />
interconnection arrangements will be able to go ahead by the<br />
end of next year.<br />
BEAZLEY: Well, the whole variety of factors involved in<br />
getting thos~ e interconnection arrangements right and I don't<br />
think you should pretend that they're going to be -or I<br />
should pretend, you don't have to pretend anything -I<br />
should pretend that they're going to be easy, they're not.<br />
They're techinically extraordinarily difficult. And arriving<br />
at the right pricing arrangements is also extraordinarily<br />
difficult. I think from the point of the unions there is<br />
this to be said. There is no doubt that one of the effects<br />
of increasing competition is a massive exponential increase<br />
in communications usage. We've had arguments over the years<br />
whether or riot opening up telecommunications produces better<br />
services to the customer. I belief it does and I support<br />
the people who argue that it does. But there is one<br />
unarguable point from everywhere where competition has been<br />
entered into by a government even in quite limited forms.<br />
And that is that there is exponential increase in the usage<br />
of telecommunications, so the market expands. We have a<br />
small exampl~ e from Telecom's experience and that was in the<br />
paging system area where Telecom defended its monopoly as<br />
you expect Telecom always until recently would have.<br />
Telecom dropped from a hundred percent of the paging system<br />
market down to sixty, the market increased three hundred<br />
percent. That's a little area, I do admit, but you can<br />
expect those sorts of increases across the board. So what<br />
you say to t: he unions is this you, instead of becoming<br />
effectively a public service union in a public entity, you<br />
become a communications union in the most rapidly growing<br />
area of industry in terms of contribution to our GDP-You<br />
have presented yourselves with the opportunity, from being a<br />
moderate to large size union in the Australian context of<br />
being the Australian union giant. That's what you'll become<br />
and for your members you have what you have never had<br />
before. That is a market in telecommunications workers.<br />
Now these are very substantial benefits for the unions.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, when you say in the Statement<br />
we will ensure that untimed calls continue to be offered to<br />
households, does that imply in any way that timed calls will<br />
also be Offered to households in other sorts of packages?<br />
PM: As far as my statement is concerned it intends to<br />
convey no more than what it says, and what it says is<br />
precise. That is what the situation will be. They'll<br />
continue to be offered. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: That does mean that you might time local calls<br />
BEAZLEY: It's a question of what Telecom is directed to do.<br />
As far as we're concerned we are directing Telecom to<br />
provide untimed called for household consumers under the CPI<br />
minus x formula in keeping with the promise made by the<br />
Prime MinistE. r that everybody benefits from these changes.<br />
It has to be said that the capacity to separate out, to all<br />
intents and purposes, timed calls in the local loop from<br />
untimed calls; in other words business and households<br />
situations is not easy, and I would think fairly unlikely<br />
to be pursued by Telecom, even if a capacity is opened up<br />
because the Government didn't provide a direction in that<br />
area. So I think in many ways the sort of fears that have<br />
been expressed in those areas really are a chimera.<br />
JOURNALIST: in terms of the competitor to Telecom. Are<br />
you saying that they will be<br />
BEAZLEY: Wel~ l it's up to the competitor how it chooses to<br />
conduct its affairs in these areas but it would be pretty<br />
stupid if it offered itself a offered a worse deal than<br />
that providedi by Telecom to any particular group.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, in your statement you say that in<br />
selling AUSSAT the Government will ensure there's a strong<br />
Australian participant leading to majority Australian<br />
ownership. Will there be any formal time limits on<br />
achieving that or any formal sell-down requirements for the<br />
new carrier?<br />
BEAZLEY: None have been determined, at this stage, but it<br />
is possible that that would be done.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
0 BtEhAeZ LtEeYn: d er Thparto cewsosu. ld be determined by the time we went to<br />
JOURNALIST: question Minister. What's the timing<br />
process for the third mobile?<br />
BEAZLEY: It would not come into place until after the<br />
second carrier had been awarded. In other words, we would<br />
not give the third cellular mobile operator an opportunity<br />
to leap ahead into the market of the second carrier.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you expect that to be pretty much<br />
simultaneous or that there would be a significant gap<br />
between the second and the third?<br />
BEAZLEY: There wouldn't be a significant gap.<br />
JOURNALIST: immediate resale that there's a high risk<br />
that the second player in the infrastructure in setting<br />
the scale of the resale value. </p>
<p>BEAZLEY: I think that it is very important the way in which<br />
AUSTEL finally comes down with the terms of conditions that<br />
it sets for r-esale. I think it would be most undesirable<br />
were the set of events that you outline there to take place.<br />
We would be expecting of AUSTEL, as they determine these<br />
conditions, to ensure that in the way in which they're<br />
determined there is still major incentives on the new<br />
carrier to develop their own infrastructure.<br />
JOURNALIST: talk about price..<br />
BEAZLEY: The pricing related too to the amount the<br />
infrastructure that goes along with the establishment of a<br />
private network all those sorts of issues.<br />
JOURNALIST: -Mr Hawke, you said the fee which Telecom would<br />
have to pay fEor OTC would be set in consultation with the<br />
new player. Why is that? Doesn't that new entity have a<br />
won't it be motivated to maximise the price that Telecom<br />
would have to pay thereby constraining Telecom's ability to<br />
compete? PM: I can't even hear the question. Could you speak up?<br />
JOURNALIST: You said in your statement that the level of<br />
the fee that Telecom will have to pay for OTC would be<br />
established in consultation with the new entity? Page 6.<br />
PM: It didn't say with the the new entity being the<br />
merged entity not the competitor.<br />
JOURNALIST: So you're not saying that the OTC price<br />
PM: A fee will be paid to the Government as a result of the<br />
merger of Telecom/ OTC that level of that fee will be set by<br />
the Government in consultation with the new entity. That's<br />
the new entity.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: It's all right.<br />
JOURNALIST: What would be the price for OTC be like?<br />
PM: I beg your pardon.<br />
JOURNALIST: What would the OTC sale price be like to<br />
Telecom? PM: Well that's the matter to be determined.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you said in Parliament that you<br />
expect it would be a job of expansion not contraction.<br />
Could you see that as an incentive for unions albeit<br />
reluctant. By how much would you expect jobs to expand?<br />
Have you got any sort of round figures? </p>
<p>PM: No I haven't got any figures. Perhaps Kim has. But I<br />
mean, the comments he made before are relevant to it. I<br />
mean, experience everywhere shows that where you have the<br />
increase in competition you have this massive increase in<br />
the use of new service and new technology that is available.<br />
All the experience, including the experience that we've had<br />
here, in regard, I think it was the pager service that he<br />
referred to,. all the experience shows that there will be an<br />
increase in employment opportunities. I don't know, Kim,<br />
whether you've got any figures on it at all but I think<br />
that's true everywhere and certainly we can say with<br />
confidence it'll happen here.<br />
BEAZLEY: I1:' s impossible to tell at this stage but the<br />
sorts of numbers of people, I'm being advised, that the<br />
would be competitors who're already taking on board, in<br />
their Australian establishments, to put themselves simply in<br />
a position 1: o bid for this process, I think is a pretty fair<br />
indication that employment is going to increase<br />
exponentially. You've got I mean, one particular company<br />
already has close to a thousand employees in this country.<br />
One of the regional I think that you think of Telecom<br />
having a workforce of some, if you add OTC into it, some<br />
86,000 86--87,000. You've got a new competitor coming in<br />
you have to see that the new competitor would be very likely<br />
to very rapiLdly expand to get up to being in a position to<br />
provide a reasonable service. So there is absolutely no<br />
question that as a result of these various initiatives and<br />
as a result to of the technological change and the growing<br />
importance of telecommunications employment over the next<br />
years is going to increase exponentially in the<br />
communications area.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, do you think there should be major<br />
shake-up with the management of Telecom?<br />
BEAZLEY: I think that what will arise from the merged<br />
entity is going to be a much more offensive business<br />
organisation. It will need to be because of the fact that<br />
it now experiences competition. I do think that that<br />
structure of the company that will emerge as a result of<br />
deliberations that are taken by the interim board will<br />
reflect some changes in Telecom's business organisation.<br />
I'm not expecting a shake-up, as you describe it, of Telecom<br />
management iLn the sense that you speak of it. I'm talking<br />
I'm thinking of it in the context of practices of business<br />
behaviour. JOURNALIST: Will OTC retain any structural integrity within<br />
the new structure or not?<br />
BEAZLEY: Well that's to be determined and OTC is not simply<br />
just an overseas provider of communications. It has a raft<br />
of other business activities. So it would be very difficult<br />
to say at this point exactly what it would look like after<br />
the interim board has had a chance to have a look at the<br />
whole struc-ture. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: How important is structural separation to the<br />
ultimate level of competition that or the speed with which<br />
competition will be introduced into the industry?<br />
BEAZLEY: Thtat is the question of structural separation<br />
is, as you'll notice from this paper, a matter to be<br />
considered by the interim board and by, ultimately by, the<br />
Government. My own view is that what is critical to<br />
competition is accountancy separation.. That AUSTEL proceeds<br />
immediately to work on that. I think the other question is<br />
not as important as that.<br />
JOURNALIST: How long before we can see dramatic reductions<br />
in STD prices?<br />
BEAZLEY: There are going to think in if experience,<br />
our experience to this point under the threat of competition<br />
is to be replicated, and the experience elsewhere, prices<br />
could well be start to fall before competition is<br />
introduced. But I would think that the falls are likely to<br />
be quite substantial very quickly once a competitor gets<br />
anywhere near like getting up and moving.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
BEAZLEY: None to this point. That's a matter for we have<br />
given, in accordance with the Conference decision, Telecom<br />
the permissiLon within the price-capping formula to do some<br />
deaveraging and rebalancing. But that is a matter yet to be<br />
worked out effectively between AUSTEL, the competitor and<br />
Telecom. JOURNALIST: What about the freedom from Loan Council<br />
restrictions? Telecom is not getting that. Won't that<br />
unfairly handicap it against a competitor and also<br />
industrial relations freedom?<br />
BEAZLEY: I think that there is a substantial requirement<br />
for Telecom to have additional capital as a result of the<br />
many things it will do under this framework. Within the<br />
framework of the Government's decisions, to this point of<br />
time and the way in which the public sector borrowing<br />
requirement is examined, the fact that Australian and Qantas<br />
are being sold is very important. It takes them out of the<br />
Loan Council arrangements. The amounts freed roughly<br />
conform to t~ he amounts required by Telecom in this area. So<br />
I do think that, fortuitously, the combination of these two<br />
factors will probably address Telecom's requirements without<br />
us having to contemplate the Loan Council issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: Doesn't that underline the stupidity of the<br />
Loan Council requirements? Some and ownership<br />
subsequent BEAZLEY: NC). I mean, if you're taking ownership out of the<br />
public sector into the private sector quite clearly the<br />
public sector borrowing requirement is quite important. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: The bottom line for the economy in terms<br />
there's no difference at all.<br />
BEAZLEY: I'm now out of my territory and I don't intervene<br />
in other Ministers' territories.<br />
PM: I'm quite prepared to answer. The simple fact is that<br />
in terms of the conventions that are applied to us by those<br />
who determine our definition of requirements. What we are<br />
doing is in accordance with them. In other words, if the<br />
no question about the fully publicly owned enterprise that's<br />
required to be within the, by definition, must be within the<br />
public secto~ r borrowing requirement. If there is a majority<br />
public ownership then the definitions that are applied to us<br />
by the statistician in accordance with international<br />
convention i~ s required that it be included. As long as we<br />
all understand that that's what's involved you can, you are<br />
able, in your analysis to then understand, over a period of<br />
time, what's happening to the levels of demand upon the<br />
community saLvings from that sector. There's no difficulty<br />
in f ollowinqr that.<br />
JOURNALIST: understand the definition<br />
PM: I can see the point that there is an artificiality<br />
about it. It's not an artificiality of our imposition.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Beazley, will the recent decision by the<br />
AUSSAT board not to take up an opportunity to use satellite,<br />
new satellite, technology to enable it to operate in the<br />
South East Asian market provide a barrier to its becoming a<br />
more, an effective international competitor in the way<br />
you've described here?<br />
BEAZLEY: I don't think so. Basically because there's a<br />
very substantial unused capacity on INTELSAT and also a<br />
whole new set Of fibre optic cables being run through the<br />
same area. I mean, I think, in a sense you look at AUSSAT<br />
under the oJld terms and conditions of how AUSSAT used to<br />
operate. AUSSAT will now have, as Telecom/ OTC will have,<br />
the capacity to lease operations off the international<br />
satellite system and fibre optic cable system. And I think<br />
that any deficiencies in regard to their own satellites will<br />
be of minimal importance. I think they made a reasonably<br />
sensible cal. culation in the cost benefit analysis terms of<br />
developing their own capacity in that regard rather than<br />
being able to0 lease it.<br />
JOURNALIST: on the Qantas being able to buy up into<br />
the domestic: airlines?<br />
BEAZLEY: Well I must say that I would very much take the<br />
view and the whole issue of this of course is in the hands<br />
of the Minister for Finance at the moment and he's doing<br />
scoping studies and looking at the best possible return and<br />
all those sorts of things for the Government. But I would<br />
take the view that the best price for Australian would be<br />
realised ancd the most equitable outcome achieved by </p>
<p>maintaining strict separation between international and<br />
domestic aviation. At least for the life of this<br />
Parliament. A logical consequence of that would be that<br />
Qantas would not acquire shareholding in Australian and<br />
maintain its; status as the single overseas passenger<br />
carrier. Likewise, I think, that's probably quite important<br />
to Qantas' value as well. So while one wouldn't rule that<br />
out completElly, until those scoping studies were finished, I<br />
didn't, and the Prime Minister and others, haven't laboured<br />
mightily in the field to produce a situation where we can<br />
sell the domestic airline and stay out of Government<br />
ownership irk a domestic market to buy ourselves back into<br />
it. PM: I'M glad Kim said that. It just seems to me a very<br />
strange sort: of situation as he says, to have laboured<br />
mightily which is, as usual, an understatement on the<br />
Minister's part to get rid of what I see as the absurdity<br />
of a government running a domestic airline, do all that and<br />
then come back in the other way. It doesn't seem to me to<br />
make very much sense.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, why is the sale of AUSSAT being<br />
handled by a taskforce based in Mr Beazley's Department<br />
instead of going through the Department of Finance's regular<br />
avenue? PM: Because, there's a very simple truth, and that is that<br />
what we're about is setting up a competitor in the<br />
telecommunications industry, a competitor to Telecom/ OTC.<br />
It happens to be the case that the vehicle that's being used<br />
for the creation of a competitor is Aussat. But the<br />
essential operation is not selling Aussat, I mean that's<br />
not the essential. The essential thing is the creation of a<br />
competitor. Now in that sense it's most appropriate that<br />
the be in the department which is concerned with<br />
telecommunications. However, we acknowledge, and the<br />
Minister happily acknowledges, that the Department of<br />
Finance has a legitimate interest when as part of that<br />
process of setting up a new competitor you are disposing of<br />
an asset that the Department of Finance should be involved.<br />
So that's the basic answer. If we were setting up the<br />
competitor by means of not using Aussat, you were putting<br />
Aussat, OTC and Telecom together, you weren't selling<br />
Aussat, woul. d Finance be involved? The involvement of<br />
Finance is i~ n a sense an incidental, but an appropriate<br />
incidental. They are entitled to be involved and should be<br />
involved. But the essential thing in this exercise is the<br />
setting up o~ f a competitor and if you're setting up a<br />
competitor in the telecommunications industry the<br />
appropriate department, portfolio to have a major<br />
responsibility is the Department of Transport and<br />
Communications. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, getting back to airlines, in<br />
your StatemfEtnt you say that the foreign investment changes<br />
you've outlined offered clear opportunities for the New<br />
Zealand carrier to enter the Australian market. What </p>
<p>11.<br />
precisely do you mean, do you talk about operations or only<br />
equity? PM: I'm sorry? The opportunities for<br />
JOURNALIST: The opportunities for the New Zealand carrier,<br />
I presume AiLr New Zealand, to enter the Australian market.<br />
PM: Yes, I'm just coming to where the words begin this<br />
is page fift~ een.<br />
JOURNALIST: Page seven, fourth point.<br />
PM: Yes, well it's my page fifteen. I haven't got the..<br />
It means, not Look, let me answer it first by pointing<br />
to what we've said before that which is most relevant. The<br />
page where we talk about during the life of this Parliament<br />
we are going to leave the arrangements that exist in place.<br />
The only implication for that section there is not that you<br />
will be able to have Air New Zealand coming in and<br />
operating, but they will have an opportunity to invest.<br />
It's the investment opportunity that you talk about. We are<br />
not, and I was trying to find the passage in the speech but<br />
you know where it is you can look it up yourself, where we<br />
are not changing the basic operational arrangements. For<br />
the reason that I said in the Parliament, that, there are<br />
two reasons that were referred to in the speech as you will<br />
recall. Firstly, that you can't, it doesn't very sensibly<br />
when you're moving into deregulation, to create a situation<br />
where you're going to make more difficult the viability of<br />
people who have just entered and undertaken significant<br />
capital expenditures. So you wouldn't do it for that<br />
reason. And secondly, I refer to the fact that in disposing<br />
of your total interest in Australian Airlines and your<br />
partial interest in Qantas, you don't want to be changing<br />
the goalposts while'people are in the process of acquiring<br />
those interests. For those two reasons we've made the point<br />
quite specifically in the speech and in the decisions of<br />
Cabinet we wouldn't be changing the basic structures beyond<br />
the significant changes that we've made. And that refers,<br />
as I say, to investment opportunity.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you put a figure on the value of the Loan<br />
Council funds that would be freed up by the sale of the<br />
airlines? BEAZLEY: I: E you took the two of them out just take last<br />
year's performance and of course they vary year on year<br />
it'd be about seven hundred million.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about the number of Telecom shareholding<br />
in Aussat and the Government's involvement?<br />
BEAZLEY: Yes well, as the Prime Minister said, it's<br />
determined at a value some date last month<br />
PM: Twenty-fourth of October. </p>
<p>BEAZLEY: Twenty-fourth of October, Finance is working all<br />
that out.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
BEAZLEY: ( inaudible)<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you see any conflict in the fact that Mel<br />
Ward was Aussat when they made that decision?<br />
BEAZLEY: I think probably that was a decision which on<br />
balance may well have increased the value of Aussat as<br />
opposed to lowering it as far as the Government was<br />
concerned and I think that Mel Ward would be as<br />
understanding as anyone else that Aussat now doesn't have to<br />
compete simply with its own technology. The Aussat will do<br />
as it pleases, the establishment of the links it wants to<br />
internationally and use whatever services other people<br />
provide JOURNALIST: consortium can we expect ( inaudible)<br />
BEAZLEY: Very difficult at this stage. It could be as high<br />
as four and I think there will probably be a higher number,<br />
half a dozen to eight companies, that would be interested.<br />
That is, overseas is interested. And it'll probably<br />
come down to a smaller number.<br />
PM: OK? Thanks.<br />
JOURNALIST: the statement by Mr Dawkins yesterday did<br />
you speak to him about that before or afterwards, and what<br />
is your attitude to his going outside his portfolio and the<br />
context of what he said?<br />
PM: I had a yarn to him before he made the statement and<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I didn't use the words that I authorise it. I had a<br />
yarn to him beforehand. It was his statement, not mine.<br />
Don't really get knicker-knotted about that as under some<br />
JOURNALIST: you authorised him later<br />
PM: It's your word authorised. He'd made arrangements to<br />
make a speech at the National Press Club. He'd made those<br />
arrangements and I don't have a situation where if Ministers<br />
are going to be making a speech somewhere that they come and<br />
get my authorisation to make speeches. He had made his<br />
arrangements to talk at the National Press Club. I spoke to<br />
him beforehand, it wasn't a question of authorising him to<br />
speak, he'd made the arrangements and I had a discussion<br />
with him in company with the Treasurer.<br />
JOURNALIST: we're a third world economy.. </p>
<p>6 13.<br />
PM: Beg your pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you agree with his observation that we're a<br />
third world economy with first world aspirations?<br />
PM: I don't think we're a third world economy, no.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does this statement go against your principle<br />
that Ministers should not range outside their area?<br />
PM: He related his concerns to the question of employment,<br />
he hung his observations on that peg and in that sense the<br />
Treasurer and I were prepared to go along with him making<br />
the speech. I would think you were getting towards a pretty<br />
fine line.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you initiate this meeting with Mr Dawkins?<br />
0 PM: Yes I asked to speak to him, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think you persuade him from saying some<br />
of the things that he said<br />
PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: No, I didn't seek to persuade him.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's your view of the main thrust of what he<br />
had to say?<br />
PM: In what area? He was talking about factions, he was<br />
talking about the economy, which is the more important?<br />
JOURNALIST: Additional government intervention to assist<br />
export industries.<br />
PM: I'm not going to discuss those things here, we'll<br />
discuss those matters in the Cabinet.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the ALAC meeting which I think starts<br />
in about fifteen minutes, are you anticipating any<br />
suggestion from the union movement as to changes to the<br />
Accord in the wake of yesterday's inflation figures.<br />
PM: I'm not anticipating any.<br />
JOURNALIST: What was your response to<br />
PM: you know this hypothetical business doesn't wash<br />
with me<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well we'll see. I've got enough things to deal with,<br />
actual things, without spending my time answering </p>
<p>14.<br />
hypothetical questions from you. If the matter arises with<br />
the trade union movement, I and my colleagues will deal with<br />
it. I'm not going to spend my time contemplating what we<br />
might do if<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: OK, alright then.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I'm simply saying that if they raise the question,<br />
both the Treasurer and I and relevant Ministers will listen<br />
to what they've got to say. We always do listen to what<br />
they've got to say. But I'm not anticipating that they will<br />
raise it and if they do raise it I'm certainly not going to,<br />
before they do, in here have some speculation about what our<br />
reaction will be.<br />
0 JOURNALIST: Will you be faced with the attitude though that<br />
you have a deal and that's the end?<br />
PM: We've got a deal and the most important part of that<br />
deal is the seven percent national aggregate wage outcome<br />
and that is something to which I believe the ACTU is<br />
committed and to which they'll adhere. OK, and now I'd<br />
better get to the ALAC.<br />
ends </p>
