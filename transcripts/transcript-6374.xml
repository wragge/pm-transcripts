PRIME MiNiSTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
NAMING OF THE LOCOMOTIVE " BOB HAWKE"<br />
ADELAJDE 18 APRIL 1984<br />
I am greatly honoured to have been chosen to give my name toa<br />
one of the new range of " BL" class locomotives. I have<br />
noted with particular satisfaction that one of Australian<br />
National's earlier locomotives was named after one of my<br />
predecessors, that dedicated railway man and great<br />
Australian, Ben Chifley.<br />
I understand that these locomotives are a new, improved<br />
model with state-of-the-art refinements which lead to<br />
greater fuel efficiency and improved hauling power traits<br />
which seem eminently in keeping with the leadership that my<br />
Government is giving to the nation.<br />
Clyde Industries is to be congratulated on the production of<br />
this fine series of locomotives; they are the latest in a<br />
long line of successful diesel-electric locomotives which<br />
have given excellent service to Australian railways over the<br />
last 30 years.<br />
I understand that the locomotives Eire the result of a very<br />
successful association with the ElE. ctro-Motive Division of<br />
General Motors in an arrangemnent which involves Clyde<br />
adapting the basic technology of the latest United States<br />
developments to meet the exacting conditions encountered in<br />
Australian railway operations.<br />
It is with products such as the " BL" class Of locomotive,<br />
and the dedicated efforts of its employeeS, that Australian<br />
railways will continue to play an important and crucial role<br />
in the transport services of thc nation.<br />
The railway industry in Austrlaia has a proud history of<br />
service to the country. In the early years, it helped to<br />
open up the country and aided in the development of our<br />
great, mainly export oriented, rural industries. In more<br />
recent times, railways have played a key role in assisting<br />
the development of recently discovered major mineral<br />
deposits and in the provision of efficient and reliable<br />
transport links over the long distances between our major<br />
centres of population. </p>
<p>2.<br />
The Government's overall transport strategy is to ensure<br />
that the nation has a balanced system, wit h each mode<br />
undertaking those tasks for which it is best equipped.<br />
Australia, with its vast distance and heavy dependence on<br />
exports needs an efficient and economic tiransport system, if<br />
it is to improve its competitiveness and r-ealise the<br />
community's aspirations for higher living standards.<br />
The Australian National Railways Commission, which was<br />
established in July 1975 has an important role to play in<br />
the Government's transport strategy.<br />
The Commission, which is now trading as ' Australian<br />
National', t is jesponsible for around 8,000J kilometres of<br />
track about of the total Australian network. It employs<br />
about 10,000 s~ aff on both intra-and-inter-state passenger<br />
and freight services and commands assets of the order of<br />
$ 600 million. It is a big enterprise in any sense of the<br />
te rm<br />
Despite ( or perhaps because of) its size, life has not been<br />
easy for Australian National. The nature of the far-flung<br />
and disparite system it has been charged with operating has<br />
posed major problems for its management. These fundamental<br />
constraints have been exacerbated in recent years by the<br />
general economic downturn and natural disasters, such as<br />
drought. As a result, Australian National recorded an<br />
operating loss of $ 109 million last financial year. While,<br />
with the improvement in the economy and the breaking of the<br />
drought, there has been a significant improvement in<br />
operating results in the current year, Australian National<br />
still has some way to go to achieve what could be regarded<br />
as a satisfactory long-term operational profile.<br />
Strenuous efforts are being made to improve efficiency.<br />
Greater emphasis has been given to marketing, especially the<br />
acquisition and development of profitable new traffic, and<br />
to measures to match the supply of capacity more closely<br />
with the demand for rail services. Close consultations with<br />
unions are an integral and indispensable component of such<br />
efforts to improve efficiency and enhance the long-term<br />
competitiveness and employment security cf Australian<br />
National<br />
M~ y Government is determined that its railway, Australian<br />
National, should be equipped materially and managerially to<br />
operate efficiently in the very competitive transport<br />
market. To this end, Australian National has just. been given a<br />
modern legislative charter with flexibility to operate in a<br />
commercial manner while retaining proper accountability to<br />
the Parliament. </p>
<p>Strengthening the existing arrangements for the promotion<br />
and operation of freight services is also under review by<br />
the Railways of Australia Committee, the promotional and<br />
co-ordination body of the Government railways.<br />
Australian National's position as a line haul carrier<br />
between other railway systems also brings with it some<br />
complications. It is vital to Australia National's<br />
interests that the interstate rail transport system is well<br />
marketed and operated and has adequate capacity to meet the<br />
demands place on it.<br />
My colleague, Peter Morris, advises me that, through the<br />
Australian Transport Advisory Council, he and his State<br />
counterparts are looking to develop a range of investment<br />
and complementary operational measures for improving the<br />
national mainline network.<br />
In this regard, the question of cost recovery between the<br />
various modes continues to plague the transport planners and<br />
decision-makers in Government.<br />
I note that this is one of the issues that the National Road<br />
Freight Industry is currently addressing. I trust that the<br />
findings of the Inquiry will assist those responsible to<br />
determine an appropriate allocation of reSources between the<br />
competing modes that will enable the transport services to<br />
be provided at the lowest economic and social cost to the<br />
na t ion<br />
The remaining areas of railways operations covering<br />
metropolitan passenger services, long distance country and<br />
interstate passenger services and less than car load ( LCL)<br />
freight services are a major problem for rail authorities<br />
and Governments.<br />
There is clearly a need to rationalise services where large<br />
losses are being made. However it is not always easy to<br />
discern where the public interest lies and what services<br />
should be retained as a public service obligation.<br />
Although the rail passenger services in the major cities,<br />
such as Melbourne and Sydney, are not financially selfsupporting,<br />
it is hard to envisage those cities operating<br />
effectively in the long term without their suburban rail<br />
systems. I have great sympathy for the rail industry as it grapples<br />
with the future of this range of services at the same time<br />
as it addresses the need to reduce the large railway<br />
deficits which are a severe drain on the budgets of all<br />
Governments. I wish the industry well in its attempts to<br />
increase its competitiveness and share of the transport<br />
rnarket as any improvements, irrespective of their success in<br />
increasing rail's share, improve the welfare of all<br />
Australians. I would like to conclude now by formally naming this<br />
locomotive the " Bob Hawke". 0. </p>
