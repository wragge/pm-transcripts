SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
R. G. MENZIES AT CO iRA ON THURSDAY, 3RD<br />
NOVEMBE R, 126o<br />
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Wallace Meares and<br />
ladies and gentlemen:<br />
I think I should begin by thanking the Mayor for his<br />
very flattering remarks at the beginning of the meeting.<br />
Everything he said about other people was quite true.<br />
Itll discount what he said about me for cash at 50% ( Laughter)<br />
and still feel quite happy about it. Sir we're very, very<br />
grateful to you indeed for your generosity.<br />
I am delighted to have the chance of supporting<br />
Wallace Meares. Perhaps I ought to make one or two things<br />
quite clear at the beginning. He is my candidate: he is the<br />
Liberal Party candidate for Calare. And I hope he wins. And<br />
I'll be very, very disappointed if he doesn't.<br />
But everybody who votes for him should take infinite<br />
pains to see that the second preference goes to the candidate<br />
of the Country Party which is a partner of mine, and has been<br />
now, for 11 years, in the Government of Australia.<br />
And in the sama way, if there are Country Party<br />
supporters here I urge them to see that their second<br />
preferences don't go astray.<br />
There is always, in a by-election, a little<br />
disposition on the part of enthusiasts, when you have three or<br />
four candidates, to have little disputes on the side. I just<br />
want to remind you, that for a longer period than has ever<br />
been recorded in the history of the Commonwealth, I have been<br />
the leader of a Government which includes a majority, of<br />
course, of Liberals, having regard to our numbers, and a<br />
minority of Country Party ministers; and we have lived in<br />
complete amity and, I believe, to the great-advantage of the<br />
people of Australia. Now don't let that be interfered with<br />
in Calare. There is no reason why it should be.<br />
Wallace Meares is a Liberal and has been a member of<br />
the Liberal Party since I had the great honor of taking steps<br />
to found it 16 years ago. And of course I want him to T-in.<br />
And without being a prohpet, or the son of a prophet, I think<br />
he will. ( Applause)<br />
All I want to remind you about is this. It is worth<br />
recalling and retaining this fact. There is a good deal of<br />
argument about whether members ought to be in their<br />
electorate or whether some member has boon out of his<br />
electorate, or whether the man on the land is adequately<br />
represented. I hope everybody realises that if ' lallace Meares<br />
wins this seat when he wins this seat to be more accurate on<br />
Saturday he will be of all the men who have represented<br />
Calare in the Federal Parliament, easily the most experienced<br />
in the practical work of a farmer on the land. ( Applause)<br />
So, you wouldn't be able to say about him what you<br />
might say about me if you felt that way disposed, " Wfell he's<br />
only a city slicker". Bocause he's not a " city slicker".<br />
He is I was going to say " earthy" of the soil, except that<br />
that, of course, would be a better description of my friend<br />
Khrushchev ( Laughter) than. it -Jould be of J4allace Meares.<br />
Now, I do bog of you to remember that. I think that<br />
we want more and more people in Parliament who not by way of </p>
<p>theory, but by way of hard and intelligent experience,<br />
understand the great rural problems. Because we have great<br />
rural problems. I'm going to say something about that a little<br />
later on. But at this stage, might I just remind you that the<br />
prosperity, of Australia, thi very high prospority almoBto<br />
threatening to become a boom at present, that prosperito is<br />
still, to a vital extent, bound up with the success of the<br />
great, rural exporting industries. And, if they fail, either<br />
in terms of market, or in terms of price, or in terms of<br />
costs of production, then the prosperity of Australia could<br />
become a pretty sketchy thing, pretty quickly.<br />
So don't let us take anything for granted. And lot<br />
us understand that Parliament, if it is to be rich enough in<br />
talent to discharge its responsibilities, must at all times<br />
contain somebody of this kind representing a seat of this kind.<br />
I think you have a great opportunity hero, and I am sure that<br />
you will take it.<br />
Now, I wonder if, for not too long a time, I might<br />
talk to you a little about what I believe to be the main tasks<br />
of Government and a little about how we try to approach them.<br />
I think that it is a good opportunity for putting yourself in<br />
my position, so to speak, looking at the world, looking at<br />
your own country, knowing, inevitably, a groat deal about the<br />
problems of the world and the problems of the country, what<br />
is our objective. Because if we have an objective, if we know what we<br />
are after, and we are normally intelligent, and above all<br />
things honest and industrious, we will make headway towards<br />
those objectives. Well0, externally, we want security. I made a long<br />
speech I'm not going to repeat it, or even summaries it<br />
at Orange the other night. But I understand, Mr. Chairman,<br />
that somebody, as usual, wanted to know afterwards, " What that<br />
had to do with us?".<br />
I hope that Australians, who have been involved twice<br />
in a great war ahich began many thousands of miles away, will<br />
not fall into the error of thinking that the affairs of the<br />
world are not our concern.<br />
Because they are: they are our vital concern just<br />
as much our concern as they are the concern of the people who<br />
happen to be living in France or in Great Britain, or in the<br />
United States of America.<br />
And what we have done as a Government has been to<br />
take every stop within our power to improve our external<br />
security by getting and holding great and powerful friends.<br />
When . e came into office the relations between<br />
Australia and the United States of America were, to put it<br />
quite simply, very poor. All that had happened with my<br />
predecessors had been that they had succeeded in having a<br />
quarrel with the United States over Manus Island, and had<br />
refused the United States the opportunity of establishing a<br />
powerful base as close as that to Australia, and out stocks<br />
were, quite frankly, pretty low.<br />
I venture to say that our stocks today are the<br />
highest that they have ever been with the United States.<br />
( Applause). So high, that the two most important engagements<br />
to which we are parties in relation to our external security<br />
ebrace the United States each time. </p>
<p>0 3.<br />
You have the ANZUS Pact a pact between the United<br />
States, Australia and New Zealand. AIe promoted it. And we<br />
ultimately secured it.<br />
When you consider what a long period of time there<br />
was in . merican rodern history, when that country was<br />
isolationist; when you remember that in the First Ular, and in the<br />
Second, they had a period of neutrality before they became<br />
involved, because of this tradition of standing aloof from the<br />
conflicts of the world;<br />
when you remember those things you will realise what<br />
a great thing it was in time of peace, to got the United<br />
States to join in with Australia and New Zealand in what is,<br />
in substance, a pact of mutual security in the Pacific.<br />
This is a fact frequently overlooked. 3ut as an<br />
item of foreign policy I regard it with some pride as one of<br />
our greatest achievements.<br />
And similarly, we have the South-2ast Asian Treaty.<br />
And there we have a combination of countries Pakistan,<br />
Thailand, Philippines, United States, Great Britain, Franco,<br />
Now Zealand, Australia. This is a barrier in the path of the<br />
advance of Comnunism in the north and north-west of Australia<br />
of enormous potential importance.<br />
I say " potential" becauso, as yet, it has to grow,<br />
it has to develop its strength. And anybody who imagines that<br />
Communist China has no territorial ambitions, that aggressive<br />
Communism in South-East [ isia has gone to sleep, has gone to<br />
sloop himself. Because as we stand, or sit, hero tonight there are<br />
Communist disturbances in Laos; there are always a few<br />
troubles in Cambodia; there is a growing throat in North<br />
Vietnam to South Vietnam the old French Indo-China of our<br />
school maps Communist activities in Singapore; powerful<br />
Communist movements in Indonesia.<br />
These are of tremendous significance to us. I should<br />
not sleep comfortably at nights in the face of these events if<br />
I had not, with my Govern iant, gone to infinite pains to help<br />
to establish the South-East asian Treaty and the ANZUS Pact.<br />
( Applause) Now, Sir, I say no more about that because as I tell<br />
you i I have been warned that people are not interested. I<br />
don't believe it. I don't believe it. I think what I have<br />
been talking to you about is perhaps the most vital matter,<br />
today, in our lives.<br />
But let us turn away from that, external security.<br />
Let us turn to our internal affairs. Now, our internal<br />
policies inevitably find themselves confronting two great<br />
problems, enormously difficult ones to reconcile.<br />
First of all the problem of developing the country.<br />
And second, the problem of how to prevent a great<br />
movement of development from producing such inflationary<br />
pressures that prices and costs go into the sky.<br />
This is the practical business of governmentof a<br />
Commonwealth governient. </p>
<p>4 It is quite true that every now and then one he2rs,<br />
or reads, how si. plo it is. It is extroi:: uly simple except<br />
to people : ho understand it. But as a problen of Gov-ernment,<br />
it is the all absorbing one. It far surpasses any particular<br />
application. I was asked this afternoon by a highly intelligent<br />
citizen of this tomn, what could be done about the small<br />
farmnr. The answer to that is not some particular answer<br />
about a particular farr, or a particular group of farmers.<br />
The answer to that is, " Ho-w can we so handle our oneroral policy<br />
that the country develops, our narkets increase, our<br />
population rises, but our costs don't . ot out of hand?"<br />
I don't profess that this problem is solved. 3ut<br />
looking back over the last ten years I can ronenbor, i hope<br />
not without pride, going t: rough a feow pretty sticky patches<br />
on this matter, and co. ing out with the country in pretty<br />
good shapeo. But it is not easy and it is not to be laughed off<br />
by people who don't know about it.<br />
You take the problem of diveloplent. in the<br />
last ten years . re have had : roll over a iliion . i., rants to<br />
Australia, w. ll over a million. It is almost fantastic to<br />
think what that has involved.<br />
People of my generation in this hall tonight -ill<br />
remember how, in our y:) uth, we used to read :-bout the United<br />
States of America and the great lmovements of population into<br />
the United States fromn urop, In tcrns of percentago on the<br />
base population are have had a greator -moveaunt into Australia<br />
than the United States of america had in the reoat flush days<br />
of iigration in the 19th and the first ten years of this<br />
century. And this, of course, produces at once an asset and<br />
a liability. Ain asset, because lwe have had moro and nore<br />
scores of thousands of people willing to . ork, willing to work<br />
in heavy industries, rilling to work to develop industries in<br />
Australia. And at the sa. e ti, O, of course, the sa e people<br />
have sot up doieands for houses, schools and hospitals wrhich<br />
are not very easy doeands to meet because there is a limit to<br />
manpower and a limit to natorials, and sometines, though<br />
people don't believe it, a limit to noney.<br />
Now, Sir, that rovmenant of irligration has been<br />
phenomenal in its effect. I rent to a big factory, not in<br />
Coura I regret to say, but in one of those bloated cities<br />
further down, a very big factory. And I said, " How many<br />
new Australians, as we call theia, employed here?". Sixty<br />
per cent of those neployod were no . australians. They have<br />
made, and are makingr a tremendous contribution to our<br />
development. But at the sa.. o time there is a constart<br />
pressure on aterials, a pressure on manpower.<br />
In New S,) uth *: ales and in Victoria today -we have<br />
obvious ove-full employeont. And that ioeans a rapid turnover<br />
of labour and less efficiency and highor costs. So that you<br />
have the problem all the timeo you must develop the country,<br />
but you are not to ruin the currency and value of the<br />
currency in the country in the process.<br />
The development itself has becun, I think, phonomenal.<br />
We're a very choeerful people in australia, and that's a very<br />
good thing. Je're very optinistic. This is Cup leek and I<br />
niy safely say that e are v'ery optimistic people. ( Laughter) </p>
<p>( Applause) We are broad-minded. oJ don't mind whether the<br />
New Zealandurs come over : nd take all the prizes. We're<br />
cheerful people. But, we have one defect of our cheerfulness; we do<br />
rather want to have everything at once. If it's Television,<br />
well we want to have television now. If it's something<br />
else, we want to have the best, and we must have it now.<br />
Well ten million people doing as veoll as we are in<br />
Australia still can't have everything that 180 million people<br />
in the United States could produce, or become entitled to.<br />
eJjou st go on getting the bst that we can.<br />
And I must say that I am astonished as I look back<br />
over the last ten years to soe the enormous development that<br />
has gone on in the country. But of course whatever it may be<br />
there will be somebody who has, particularly if ho is in<br />
Opposition, some reason to complain.<br />
Why, back in 1949, when we were coming up the<br />
straight to the 1949 winning election, blackouts were the<br />
regular thing, particularly in the big cities; there was a<br />
tremendous shortage of coal, a tremendous shortage of power.<br />
All those shortages had become as familiar as the<br />
town clock. People had learned to live with them, just as a<br />
dog learns to live with a flea. ( Laughter) I thought the<br />
Mayor was going to rebuke . me; but he agreos with me.<br />
What is the position today? The dovelop. ent of<br />
production has been enormous, but the production of power has<br />
gone on in Australia phenomenally beyond anybody's<br />
imagination, and we are at long last a substantial exporter of<br />
coal to other countries.<br />
Those are dramatic changes. And I do want everybody<br />
to realise they don't happen by accident. They will happen<br />
only if there is a bit of sensu, and a bit of judgaent, and<br />
determination among those who are responsible for the general<br />
direction of affairs.<br />
Over the same period we have had wonderful<br />
developments in Australia by the importation of capital. I<br />
want to say a word about this, the importation of capital in<br />
Australia. I don't moan borrowing by Governcmnt; though<br />
nobody has any reason to complain about the value of the<br />
money that we have borrowed overseas for Australian development.<br />
Because unless we had done what they told us was impossible,<br />
our prodc-ssors, and borrowed hundreds of millions of<br />
dollars, a lot of the developmental work done in Australia<br />
would not have been done at all, for sheer shortage of<br />
equipment. But putting all that on one side we have had a flow<br />
of private investment capital into this country without<br />
which we could not possibly stand where we do today in terms<br />
of prosperity. A few years ago I was able to say to people<br />
that private capital was coming into . ustralia at the rate of<br />
œ 100 millions a year. In the last 12 months it has come in<br />
at the rate of œ 200 millions a year.<br />
These are enormous sums of money. The only person<br />
who would think that rwas, as we say, " chicken feed", would be<br />
the leader of the Opposition making a speech on the Budget.<br />
( Laughter, applause) </p>
<p>IAnd<br />
the result of ill this has booeen, of course, the<br />
most treondous irrigation of enterprise in the country.<br />
Wherever you go in Australia, particularly, I agree, in the<br />
manufacturing field, and so on, but sometios in other fields<br />
than that, you will find the result of this invostmont some<br />
of it from the United States, perhaps 40O of it, and about<br />
of it from the United Kingdom.<br />
Now, isn't that valuable? I wouldn't lieto soee<br />
anything happon that cut it off. It is valuable in two ways.<br />
First of all it actually does provide the wear-with-all to<br />
expand. And in the second pliace, it is the most glorious<br />
proof that people, shrewd people, hard-haded people outside<br />
of Australia, have confidence in our stability, our integrity,<br />
and out future. ( Applause) That is the 3reat importance of<br />
this nratter. And anybody who wants to noss that up, anybody who<br />
wants to lower the reputation of the Governnont for integrity<br />
and stability in the world, or for that matter mine, is not<br />
doing miuch of a service to Australia. Because, iherever I go<br />
in these places, it is a certainty that at somne stage somno of<br />
the nest influential non in the invest* ment world will mak a<br />
point of speaking to ne nd saying: "\ Io are all fascinated by<br />
the way in which ustralia hbs preserved an even kool, and has<br />
developed at such spod at the sam ine".<br />
That always gives ; e gr] oat pleasure. And I hope it<br />
gives all Australians great pleasure.<br />
. And yet, since this is a by-election, and since I<br />
ams told on not very , ood authority that the Labor Party<br />
expects to win it, it night be desirable for you to consider<br />
what the Labor Party says on this point. Because, for the<br />
last two years in the Federal P-rliame nt it has mado no bones<br />
about it. It is aainst invostnoint from overseas. It takes<br />
the groatest exception to it. If it finds that one company,<br />
like the General Metors-Holdens, not to advertise one<br />
particular car, cones here, establishos a motor car industry,<br />
and makes a lot of 1.. Dney, and pl ughs back most of it into<br />
expansion into australia, they rave about it on the Opposition<br />
Benches. ? It's a scandall Jo ought not to allow this kind<br />
of thing. Those people bringing their own money hero actuallyr<br />
daring to mnako profits in Australia and taking son of the<br />
profits out! This is anti-iustralian activity'.<br />
I had groat fun at the last Geoneral Election: I went<br />
down to Geolong ta that very distinauishod enterprise, the<br />
Ford Company, at Gclong where they are always kind enough to<br />
allow i. e to make a spoch from the tail-end of a lorry.<br />
( Laughter) ( ind there are worse places than that too, if you<br />
keep the engine running). ( Laughter)<br />
4nd, just at that tino my then opponont my then<br />
Leoader of the Opposition, had " gone to tirn" I think is the<br />
expression, in a big way about overseas capital. And<br />
addressing about fourtcon hundred em. ploycos if the Ford works,<br />
I just said to then: " Do I take it that you are in favour of<br />
preventing overseas capital being invested in Australia;<br />
going back homo to mother without a job?". Jll, of course<br />
it is too ludicrous. I werlcome investmont frol overseas. -s far as I an<br />
concerned it is difficult to sooee how we could have too . iuch of<br />
a . ood thing. And don't forgot this: where a iman's<br />
treasure is, there shall his he. rt be also. </p>
<p>And if other countries, groat and powerful, and<br />
rich countries have some of their treasure in . ustralia, who<br />
an I to be displeased about it? Because they will have an<br />
interest in this country, and in its security, and in its<br />
future, and in its prosperity, that perhaps no other would<br />
provide so quickly.<br />
And yet Labor doesn't like it. How it is going to<br />
replace this capital, whore it is going to get it, it doesn't<br />
say. Because although I have the deepest affection for then<br />
as individuals, the follows sitting opposite no in the House<br />
why shouldn't I? I have a deep affection f. r then but they<br />
don't know anything about these problems. They are willing to<br />
shrug off a couple of hundred million pounds cumin fromr<br />
' ther countries, but when you say, " Well, what about it;<br />
where are you going to get it?" all they can think of is that<br />
you go to the Commonwealth Bank. ( Laughter)<br />
Just let mn say one more matter about internal<br />
probleos which has caught my eye in the course of this byelection.<br />
I think, and I speak as an experienced politician,<br />
that if you are disposed to be inconsistent you really ought to<br />
have a good nreoory; you ) ught to try to reonmbor what you<br />
said on some occasion; you ought even to try to roemeber what<br />
your Party did when it had the chance.<br />
Now, I don't want you to listen to the tiresome<br />
rominiscencos of an old politician, but in 1946 to 1949, well<br />
after the war, I was the Leader of an Opposition which<br />
nunbored 17 in a Housu of 74. So that we woren't, numrically,<br />
very strong. But we had a handsone majority at the end of ' 49.<br />
But there we were, a misorable, sall well sall,<br />
if not miserable Opposition. And, at that tin, the Labor<br />
Party was in office with this handsorme majority, able to do<br />
whatever it wanted to do; nothing to prevent it from putting<br />
its financial or economic ideas into practice; nothing to<br />
prevent it, at that time, if it had wanted to, for example,<br />
from taking the whole of the Petrol Tax money and distributing<br />
it to the States for roads.<br />
But it didn't. ; And so I road with great interest a<br />
placard, or whatever you : ight call it, of the respected *, LP<br />
candidate for Calaro who says this, I must read it to you:<br />
" Last year the Liberal and Country Party Gjvernonnt<br />
pretended it had a generous plan for road assistance to<br />
the States. The fact is, however, that at the end of the<br />
planned five-year period, the Federal Government will have<br />
collected in Federal tax about œ 100 million more than it<br />
will have paid to the States in road grants. Labour<br />
believes ( this is in double type) that all petrol tax<br />
should be made available for road use. For better roads<br />
in Calare, vote Labour on the 5th Nove: ber"<br />
Now I've read it to you. That is a free advertisonont,<br />
you see. ( Laughter) But I read it to you because I want<br />
to demonstrate to you what utter nonsense this is.<br />
First of all, it' all right to talk about us<br />
" pretending" that we had a generous plan. I don't rind telling<br />
you that not only did we have a goenrous plan, but we put it<br />
into operation. And the effect of it is that over the next<br />
five years the States will get from the Comno. nwcalth for road<br />
purposes, irrespective of Federal T-x revenue, œ 250 million<br />
instead of the œ 150 million that it wiuld h:. ve been on past<br />
figures. </p>
<p>In other words we put into operation a plan which<br />
adds, over a period of five years, œ 100 million to an already<br />
very substantial sun going to the States for roads. Fifty<br />
million pounds a year frou the Coomronwealth is not a bad sun.<br />
So I reject the idea that we hven't carried out our ideas.<br />
But do lot rnoe -o back to what did I say it was?<br />
' Labour believes that all petrol tax should be uade available<br />
for road use". I wonder when they cane to believe it.<br />
( Laughter) I sat in Opposition in the Federal Parliaeont for<br />
ight years. It rnight not have soe cdI long to you, but it<br />
seoccod an awful long tine to le eight years in Opposition,<br />
looking at a Government that had a copper-bottom majority, and<br />
looking at a Governeont which for four or five year s fter the<br />
war had all the opportunity in the wrorld of putting its<br />
beliefs into operation.<br />
So, I got the figures taken out. In 1946/ 47, that's<br />
the financial year, in their time, : ith a full majority, they<br />
collected œ 16 million odd from Tax and they distributed to the<br />
States, œ 4 million odd. That was odd wasn't it? ( Laughter)<br />
" tre believe that you ought to have the lot we stand for<br />
this but this year let us off with a quarter of it".<br />
So they collected œ 16 million and paid œ 4 million.<br />
The next year they collected œ 16 million and they paid œ 6<br />
million. The following year they collected œ 17 million and<br />
they paid œ 7 million. The following year œ 19 million and they<br />
paid œ 9 million. The highest percentage of the Petrol Tax that the<br />
Labor Government ever distributed to the States for roads was<br />
47%, This year my own Government, collecting œ 58<br />
million, distributes œ 44 million, or 78% ( Applause)<br />
And now this qtimistic gentleman who is a candidate<br />
for the ALP comes along and says, " Ah, yes, well it's a pity<br />
that when we had the chance we paid 47%; and it's a pity now<br />
you come to mention it, that we have to admit that you pay<br />
78%; but give us our chance . and we'll pay over the lot".<br />
I don't know if it's supposed that if the ALP won<br />
Calare, if I may indulge mysolf in a flight of fancy, the<br />
effect of this will be to alter the whole history of road<br />
legislation. It's a great pity that people don't know about<br />
these things. The whole of this roads grant was thrashed out by<br />
us with the States, all of the States, some of them are Labor,<br />
some of them are not, only two years back, rather less than<br />
that I think. And we said at that time, ' Jo don't want to<br />
be tying what you get to a particular tax because, after all,<br />
we might for some reason or other want to reduce a particular<br />
tax and if you are only to get a percentage of it, you will<br />
find your road expenditure is reduced. VIe would much<br />
prefer to forget all about the source of the money we pay<br />
you, and put down a five-year plan so that every shire engineer<br />
whose shire or municipality gets a share of this from the<br />
State, will know where he stands; and every State will know<br />
where it stands'. </p>
<p>You can't have a road policy that lasts for six<br />
months or has to be changed every year. . e saw this, and we<br />
put it to them: " Let's have a five-year scheme . on this matter,<br />
with a provision that will give you an increasing amount each<br />
year of the five".<br />
: de made certain arrangements about the distribution<br />
of the amounts between the States; we put in the whole<br />
proceeds of another tax that had been proposed on certain<br />
vehicles. And, in the result, as I say instead of getting<br />
these varying, and sometimes, in earlier years, sketchy<br />
amounts, the average amount to be found over the period of five<br />
years is œ 50 million œ 250 million over a period of five<br />
years. I venture to say that if anybody had gone to an<br />
election just before we made this agreement, and had said on<br />
behalf of a Commonwealth party, " My policy is to find œ 250<br />
million for the States for roads over the next five years", it<br />
would have boon received with enormous applause all over<br />
Australia. So that if that is an issue in Calare I wish our<br />
opponent joy of it, because he won't get very much comfort<br />
from it. Now, Sir, the other matter that I i½ antod to say<br />
something about is the problem of reconciling development with<br />
control of inflation. there is a great deal of<br />
inflationary pressure going on. I announced on behalf of the<br />
Government back in February, four points of a policy.<br />
One was that we would go into the Arbitration Court<br />
in broach of all our own precedents, and resist an increase in<br />
thne basic wage. And we did that most deliberately. o<br />
submitted to the Arbitration Commission a fully documented<br />
case on it; and the Commission unanimously agreed with us and<br />
made no change. Because coming on top of a very large<br />
increase in the basic wage in the previous year, and a very<br />
large increase in margins, do you remember? towards the<br />
end of that year, we felt that this would put such a strain on<br />
the economy that costs would be going up, and that they would,<br />
as usual, come right back hor. m to the man on the land who for<br />
the most part can't pass them on.<br />
Well we announced that; we did it. And we did it<br />
with success. i-e said that we were not going to budget for a<br />
deficit; that in a time of inflation you should budget for a<br />
surplus because you ought not to be increasing the supplies of<br />
money when the supply of goods is not increasing at the same<br />
rate. And so we budgeted for a surplus.<br />
11e said that we would get rid of import licensing.<br />
That was a bold stroke. The main purpose of it was to<br />
increase the supply of goods available so as to damp down the<br />
inflationary pressures, to match high purchasing power with<br />
more and more goods, and services to be bought.<br />
We put all these propositions up and they have all<br />
gone into operation. L4ell it can't be said that so far they<br />
have had a hundred per cent of success because, unfortunately<br />
for the country, the market for -rool has boen far from<br />
satisfactory. And wc live so much on wool that fluctuations<br />
in that . ronderful commodity will perhaps determine the whole<br />
economic color of the country. </p>
<p>0 But we are always watching those thinrs. Jo are<br />
constantly alert to know whether this change, or that change<br />
may have to be made in order to restrain a wild boom of<br />
inflationary growth.<br />
As for the Opposition and, after all, you must<br />
remember that elections present a choice you not like<br />
me and I don't blame you but if you dislike the other man<br />
more you probably vote for no. That s; ems reasonable.<br />
( Laughter) Perhaps that is how I have got in so many times<br />
in the past. But you are always bound to say, " what's the<br />
other man going to do about this kind of thing?".<br />
I tell you there is no symptom that the Australian<br />
Labor Party recognises the existence of an inflationary trend,<br />
is interested in the costs of production of our great<br />
comnodities. Not a sy ptom.<br />
Because every time that they condescend to speak<br />
about these matters, which is usually on the Budget, their<br />
proposals for new expenditure on the part of the Conmronwealth<br />
are so phenomenal that today's inflationary pressure would be<br />
a mere circumstance if they were adopted.<br />
It's an old, and perhaps dull expression to say that<br />
what the people require of a national government is a sound,<br />
financial outlook, a steady financial outlook, and a clear<br />
objective of preventing the country from pricing itself out of<br />
the markets of the world upon which it so vitally depends.<br />
Now, on all these matters you may say to no, " Yes,<br />
there are some aspects of life on which I night claim to have<br />
expert knowledge and a great deal of expert experience". But<br />
we will always be better off, in Parliament, always, if we<br />
can turn to a nan with vigour and experience, and practical<br />
knowledge of a great number of these problems 2nd say to him,<br />
" Cone in and have a talk with mno nd tell me what you think<br />
about this matter".<br />
And that is why, Sir, coming down here tonight, or<br />
coming up here, I felt delighted to think that I night just<br />
have one more opportunity of saying , rord on behalf of a man<br />
whom I regard as one of the outstanding country candidates<br />
I have ever supported on the platform, </p>
<p>11.<br />
Question: Mr. Chairman I would like to direct a question to<br />
the Prime Minister which is in three sections. The first one<br />
deals with Bank credit, or rather the lack of it, I should say.<br />
I should like to ask the Prime Minister if he can inform us<br />
what instructions, if any have been given to the Trading Banks<br />
as related to primary producers in particular? And also if<br />
any similar instructions have been given to Hire Purchase<br />
companies?. If not is it your intention, Sir, to give such<br />
instructions?<br />
Chairman: I think it's mther a long question. It's going to<br />
be one that no one is ever going to be able to remember.<br />
All right, I'll let it go at that.<br />
Prime Minister: I don't quarrel with it at all. The question<br />
as I understood it fell into two parts. First of all bank<br />
credit to primary industries and what directives have been<br />
given on that matter?<br />
The Reserve Bank has, right through the piece<br />
urged upon the Trading Banks that they should continue to find<br />
proper advances for their rural customers. And in order to<br />
give some further protection to those customers, as you<br />
probably know, Sir, the interest rate chargeable by the banks<br />
on overdrafts has been calculated on an average so that<br />
advances for rural purposes can be at the lowest rate of<br />
interest and not at the highest.<br />
That directive stands. It may very J1ll be that we<br />
shall have to take some steps to strengthen it. But that<br />
depends on some examinations that we happen to be making at<br />
this very tine. I've been engaged in them myself, to an<br />
extent, this week.<br />
But you may take it from me, on behalf of the<br />
Government, that we think that whatever movements in creditpolicy<br />
may occur, and whatever restrictions nay have to be put upon<br />
advances and of course they have to be put from time to time<br />
there should allways be preferential treatment for those<br />
industries which are the export industries of the nation.<br />
That is a clear statement of what we believe to be the<br />
position. In the second part of your question you asked me<br />
whether similar directions are given to the hire purchase<br />
companies. I regret to say they are not within our jurisdiction.<br />
They do not fall within the banking system. They can't<br />
receive directions from the Reserve Bank, and they can't<br />
receive directions from us. The hire purchase companies are<br />
operating under State law and under State control. The whole<br />
position of the Hire Purchase companies is, as I don't need to<br />
tell you, very complex. But certainly no Cormonwealth<br />
Government can deal with the problem in a satisfactory way.<br />
( Applause)<br />
Question: Mr. Chairman I should like to direct another question<br />
to the Prime Minister, one about which many of us are<br />
concerned, and that relates to the question of overseas balance.<br />
Of course you are no doubt aware Sir that having regard to the<br />
existing drift in these balances it is likely that they<br />
constitute a force of some œ 400 millions. Assuming that that<br />
basis is correct would you please, Sir, tell us what action your </p>
<p>12.<br />
Government is going to take in this matter?<br />
Prime Minister: Now, Sir, with very groat respect I don't<br />
propose to toll you that. Of course everybody knows who<br />
studies these natters that there has been a down turn, a down<br />
movement in the overseas balances. But for no to got up,<br />
casually, on a platform, and say what I am going to do about<br />
that over the next few months when it is plainly a natter<br />
that is going to involve the closest examination by the<br />
Cabinet would be completely irresponsible. And if any<br />
candidate tells you that he knows the answer I wish you would<br />
write a letter to me about him.<br />
Question: Is it a fact that the Bureau of Agricultural<br />
Economics put out certain figures regarding the income<br />
derived from capital invested by primary producers? Do you<br />
consider that those figures are high enough to encourago<br />
primary production development at the rate that has been<br />
maintained over the past?<br />
Prime Minister: Sir, I hope you will excuse me for not<br />
carrying in my mind any figures that have been taken out by<br />
the Bureau. But if the figures were taken out by the Bureau<br />
of Agricultural Economics they have a very strong chance of<br />
being right. I quite arec.<br />
And there is no doubt about it, that for v rious<br />
reasons that we cre familiar with there was, over the last<br />
couple of years, a very serious fall in rural income. That is<br />
a matter that h. s given us great deal of concern.<br />
We have adopted various expedients in the past to<br />
help, so far as we c. n. But, of course we rego: rd it as<br />
serious. But I don't regard it as something which will<br />
induce me to adopt a calamity outlook on the future of the<br />
country. I don't thin: there is any occasion for that.<br />
There is occasion for a lot of hard thinking and flexible<br />
Spolicy, and doing what you can, where you can. But on the<br />
whole I am an optimist about the future. ( Applause)<br />
SQuestion: I should like to ask the Prime Minister another<br />
question. If ry omeory servos me correctly, at one star,<br />
Sir, you said ' bettor', this may not be the exact words, ' to<br />
give self-governmont' something of that sort ' too early<br />
rather than too late'. Sir, I wish to ask you, having regard<br />
to developments in the Congo and the lack of confidence, I am<br />
sorry to say, in those words of yours in relation to Now<br />
Guinea, can you do anything to allay that lack of c) onfidence<br />
which has developed in New Guinea we fool, and I in p:. rticular<br />
feol, Sir, as a result of that statement which I believe you<br />
made? Prime Minister: lecll, Sir, I ca. n ease your mind at once. I<br />
am sure you read the wrong newspaper. ( Laughter) i am sure<br />
you did. Now, let us be fair about this matter. If you have<br />
any interest in what I s'. id it happens to h-ve boon printed<br />
in a pamphlet typed from a tape-recording machine, so that<br />
there is no chance of being mis-reported, and it was put on<br />
the table of Parliament some time ago, and if you are<br />
interested in this matter I'm sorry that you haven't taken<br />
the opportunity of getting a copy of it. But if you will be<br />
good enough to ive me your address zfterwards, I will see that<br />
you get a copy of it; I'll have it posted to you. </p>
<p>13.<br />
What I said about Now Guinea was this: that we<br />
obviously could not go out of Now Guinea in a hurry. I have<br />
said repeatedly, though you haven't noticed it, that nobody<br />
could do a greater disservice to Now Guinea than to create an<br />
atrosphcre that we are leoving quite soon.<br />
Because Now Guinea can't reach a period of proper<br />
self-governnont development without the aid of export people<br />
and moncy, particularly fron this country. And that to cut<br />
off investrents by foolish pronises of being out in a few<br />
years would be folly. Nobody has said this nore clearly than<br />
I have, publicly. And it is all in print. I nust send you a<br />
copy of it. What I did say and this is the piece that is torn<br />
out of context that you referred to, and was torn out by one<br />
newspaper in particular, with its usual desire to danage me<br />
was that if some tine in the future the country of Now Guinea<br />
and Papua had reached a stage of devolopment in which we had<br />
just the slightest hesitation in our minds as to whether it<br />
was just too early or just too late. the experience in nest<br />
countries, modern countries, indicated it was better to be a<br />
fraction too early, and give then self-government with<br />
friendship than to be too late, and give them self-govcernment<br />
with hatred. And that I believe is jolly good sense. ( Applause)<br />
And I have never had any occasion to alter it. ( Applause) </p>
