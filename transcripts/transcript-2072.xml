FIVE POWER CONFERENGJ! ." C<br />
Parliament House, Canberra. K<br />
19 june, 1969<br />
OPENI: NG ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MiNISTER-, MIR jOIN GORTON<br />
Gentlemen: What am doing now is outside the Conference proper but<br />
it is something which gives me great satisfaction to do. That is, in the<br />
first place, to have the opportunity to welcome here in Canberra, the<br />
capital of Australia, distinguished Prime Ministers, Foreign Ministers<br />
and Defence Ministers and those who have come with them, and to say<br />
that we are fully conscious of the honour which is done us by your travelling<br />
to confer in our country.<br />
1 think we have come together because we have a common<br />
interest a common interest in the economic progress of the region<br />
in which we live and in which we ha-ve been, and I trust will continue to be,<br />
interested. I believe we all think the economic progress of this region<br />
must be reflected not only in bank statistics or statistics as to the<br />
holding of foreign exchange or matters of that kind, but must be reflected<br />
in an improved standard of living of the individual citizens who make up<br />
the countries of the region.<br />
And 1 believe that all of us think and I certainly think that<br />
this kind of progress can best occur ( now that the situation is completely<br />
changed from what it was previously because of the British decision to<br />
withdraw), that this progress can best occur as a result of continuing<br />
stability within the region, and as a result of all countries present,<br />
including Britain, contributing to military forces which can help to defend<br />
the region against external attack.<br />
Stability within the region, that sine qua non, that requirement<br />
for the proper progress of the region, will depend on the absence of<br />
attacks or threatened attacks by any nation within or close to the region<br />
against any other nation within or close to the region. It will depecnd on<br />
the dim-inution and ultimate elimination of racial tensions in nations<br />
within the region. It will depend on the creation of communities in each nation<br />
in which all citizens have, and are seen to have, the same opportunities<br />
for advancement in any chosen field of endeavour which the individual<br />
may wish to enter. And it will depend on growing and more widelyshared<br />
prosperity. 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
The defence of the region against outside attack external<br />
attack will depend, I think, on the full acceptance of the fact that the<br />
defence of Malaya and Singapore is indivisible, and on the acceptance of<br />
the requirements the general planning, the provision of assistance, and<br />
the acceptance of the req uirements which flow from the acceptance of<br />
that basic fact. Our own approach, our Australian approach is, I hope and<br />
believe, well known. We wish to co-operate with countries in our region<br />
and to help when we can in all the ways in which we can*. I believe that<br />
in fact we are doing so, though there is always room for argument as to<br />
whether we are doing so to the extent which others might wish. Still, . we<br />
are doing so, and for the reasons I have given.<br />
One of the ways in which we decided to do so is by the ret ention<br />
of some Australian forces in the area, a visible presence, a continuing<br />
visible presence, a presence which has been described not by me but<br />
I see the validity of the description as something which may appear to<br />
others -at any rate to be the tip of the iceberg. We are retaining ground<br />
forces which will, for the best military, logistic and financial reasons<br />
and for great reasons of commonsense, be based in Singapore, provided<br />
Singapore wishes them to remain in the area; forces which will not,<br />
however, be confined to operations or exercises in Singapore, forces<br />
which are there under the concept that defence against external attack<br />
is, as far as Singapore and Malaya are concerned, in our view indivisible.<br />
And we are retaining, as you know, air forces which will be<br />
based in Malaya, provided the Malaysian Government wishes us to<br />
remain in Malaysia, and provided, in the case of our ground forces tha<br />
the Government of Singapore wishes us to remain ! u the best place to<br />
base our troops, namely, Singapore.<br />
These forces have the objective of assisting and I emphasise<br />
the word assisting in defence against external aggression or subversion<br />
which can be clearly seen to stem from -without the region and can be<br />
clearly seen to be supported by external regimes. And our forces are<br />
there for no other purpose. The maintenance of i ' nternal order in any<br />
country or the involvement in internal quarrels in any country are not,<br />
and will not be, our business.<br />
I don't envisage that this meeting will arrive at the acceptance<br />
of firm m-ilitary plans for operations or that it will attempt to lay down<br />
firm conditions, and spelt-out circumstances under which the various / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
forces which are available to assist against external aggression will<br />
be used, Indeed, I think it will be better for this not to be done and<br />
not to be attempted to be done,' but rather that general understandings<br />
will be reached and actual decisions on the use of forces left to be made<br />
on each country's judgment of circumstances as they may . arise in the<br />
future. But I do believe and hope that this meeting will advance<br />
further the general concept of Five Powers being interested in providing<br />
assistance for a most significant region against attacks which may<br />
develop against that region from outside. I hope this meeting will<br />
advance planning on such things as radar control of aircraft; advance<br />
planning on such things as the joint exercises which may, and I sincerely<br />
hope will, continue to take place after the end of 1971.<br />
1 also hope this meeting will advance still further the idea<br />
that not from Australia, New Zealand or Great Britain alone, but that<br />
from Singapore and from Malaysia as well, there will be a capacity<br />
for joint opposition to any external threat which may arise and a full<br />
acceptance of the fact that the countries in the region I include<br />
ourselves and New Zealand in my mind will jointly exercise; will<br />
jointly be prepared to resist ( again in each case subject to the judgments<br />
of each individual around this table or rather of each government<br />
represented by the individuals around this table) any external threat<br />
which may arise. I do not think that I should, in making brief opening comments<br />
at this meeting, make any long speech. But given conditions of<br />
brotherhood inside the countries of the region, given conditions of<br />
progress because of stability inside the countries of this region, then<br />
we, all of us, have a duty to try to see to the best of the ability of<br />
each of us, that this progress and this stability is not endangered from<br />
w itho~ ut. If the task, as is possible who can tell what the future<br />
holds if the task, as is possible, might at some future time become<br />
great, greater than the resources all of us are able to put together to<br />
counter, then we would hope and expect that there would be others that<br />
would come to our assistance. But whether that be so or whether it be<br />
not, if this conference does advance further concrete practical plans for<br />
how to operate, how to command, how to control joint forces, then I<br />
think it will have made a step forward. Not the only step because the<br />
protection of existing regimes or the protection of governments of individual<br />
countries, including mine, is not dependent in the last resource on 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
force but rather on the judgment of all the individuals that make up<br />
those countries that they are well off comparatively and are therefore<br />
prepared to fight to retain that comparative position if it is threatened<br />
but one significant step.<br />
This, I think, is what this meeting is about, and I wish it<br />
God-speed in its deliberations. I believe that because of the calibre<br />
of those sitting around this table, either leading the countries which<br />
they represent or playing the most significant part in the defence<br />
plans of the countries which they represent, that there is every hope<br />
that this conference will achieve what it sets out to achieve That in<br />
great degree is up to you.<br />
And the measure of the success which you achieve in the next<br />
two days will be shown by events which occur in the next ten or fifteen<br />
years in the countries to our North and be shown by the effect on the<br />
world because there will be a significant effect on the world, including<br />
Europe of what happens in the next ten or fifteen years in this region.<br />
I wish you gentlemen the best of luck and I believe that not<br />
only my own prayers and the prayers of Australians, but that indeed the<br />
prayers of all whether they be Moslems, whether they be Buddhists,<br />
whether they be Christians, whatever they be, are with you in your<br />
deliberations, and I trust will sustain you ii them. </p>
