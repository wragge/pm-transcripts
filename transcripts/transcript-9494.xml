PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
RECOGNITION FOR WWII DEFENDERS OF DARWIN AND VETERANS OF<br />
THE SYRIAN CAMPAIGN aQ.. 0/ i 01 Iqv()<br />
I am pleased to announce that defenders of Darwin during the Japanese<br />
bombing, and previously unrecognised Australian servicemen who took part<br />
in the Syrian Campaign are to receive campaign awards.<br />
As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War 11i, t is<br />
fitting that these two groups of Australian veterans will at last receive their<br />
due recognition and that Australia will thereby reclaim some of the history of<br />
her involvement in World War 11.<br />
Her Majesty The Queen has, at my request, approved the expansion of<br />
conditions under which two campaign stars, the 1939-45 Star and the Africa<br />
Star, are awarded. Eligible veterans should be able to receive their awards<br />
by Anzac Day this year.<br />
Expanding the conditions for the awards was one of the recommendations of<br />
last year's Committee of Inquiry into Defence and Defence-related Awards<br />
chaired by General Peter Gration AC OBE.<br />
The Committee considered there were parallels between the intense air war<br />
fought over Darwin and the Battle of Britain and Malta. Australian aircraft<br />
were often outnumbered and expected to repel an enemy believed at the time<br />
to be intent on invading Australia, and like Malta, Darwin was isolated,<br />
difficult to supply and under prolonged attack.<br />
Personnel who served in the Darwin area during the time of the Japanese<br />
bombing ( 19 February 1942 12 November 1943) and who meet eligibility<br />
requirements will receive the 1939-45 Star, a medal which they have been<br />
seeking for 50 years.<br />
It is fitting that approval to issue this medal has occurred so recently after<br />
Australia remembered the 261 people who were killed in air raids on Darwin<br />
which began on 19 February 1942. 13/ 95 </p>
<p>2<br />
The committee also recommended that all Australian servicemen who<br />
participated in the Syrian Campaign ( 8 June 11 July 1941) and who did not<br />
otherwise receive the Africa Star should now receive the medal.<br />
Because of its brevity, the Syrian Campaign had been excluded as qualifying<br />
service for the award. The Committee of Inquiry found that the intensity and<br />
importance of the campaign more than compensated for its brevity, and the<br />
Government has now taken steps to ensure that the Africa Star will be<br />
awarded to the campaign's veterans.<br />
