CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
INSTITUTE OF MUNICIPAL MANAGEMENT NATIONAL SEMINAR<br />
CANBERRA 30 MAY 1988<br />
For well over 100 years local government has been an<br />
integral element of the way Australians govern themselves.<br />
over that time there have been enormous changes in the role<br />
and functions of local government, and in its relationship<br />
with the other two tiers of the national structure of<br />
government. Today there are over 800 local government bodies, over 8,000<br />
elected representatives and some 170,000 people employed by<br />
local government bodies throughout Australia. Local<br />
government accounts for over 5 per cent of all public sector<br />
outlays and 4 per cent of total taxation revenues.<br />
So it is timely for a seminar such as this to address the<br />
fundamental questions about the direction and the future of<br />
local government.<br />
And I am delighted that I was able to accept your invitation<br />
to address the seminar, because I welcome this as an<br />
opportunity to express once more the commitment of my<br />
Government to local government.<br />
I think it is true to say that no other Federal Government<br />
has enjoyed-~ so close and constructive a working relationship<br />
with local government as we have since we were first elected<br />
in 1983. r.<br />
That is because we were determined from our first days in<br />
office to build a relationship with local government based<br />
on a recognition of your legitimate and, indeed, crucial<br />
role in the system of government in Australia, and based on<br />
proper support of your ability to carry out and develop that<br />
role. I am happy to say that the positive attitude extended by the<br />
Federal Government has been fully reciprocated.<br />
I do not pretend that we have agreed on every issue. 0J068361 </p>
<p>2.<br />
That would be an unrealistic expectation and probably an<br />
undesirable outcome.<br />
But I do say that we have been able to work together<br />
constructively on a number of issues of direct relevance to<br />
both of us. Where we have disagreements we have been able<br />
to express them frankly.<br />
I know some of you have been concerned about cuts to funding<br />
for Local Government in the May Statement.<br />
But I want to make it clear that, within the overall fiscal<br />
restraint which was necessary, I ensured that Local<br />
Government was treated relatively favourably.<br />
If the same cut had been applied to Local Government's<br />
recurrent funding as has been applied to the States', the<br />
forward estimates would have been cut back by some $ 28<br />
million in 1988/ 89. We have in fact held the cut. to<br />
million. Similarly while there has been a general cut in road funding<br />
reflecting high levels of expenditure at the peak of the<br />
National Highways program, funds for local roads have been<br />
maintained in real terms.<br />
Today, however, our mutual commitment to local government<br />
faces a great test.<br />
The Federal Government has decided to ask the Australian<br />
people to change the Constitution to extend formal<br />
recognition to local government.<br />
We believe this move is right in principle. We believe it<br />
is right in timing.<br />
And we believe it has broad support right across the<br />
Australian community. We know it has the overwhelming<br />
support of local government organisations throughout<br />
Australia. The Opposition parties however have decided to oppose the<br />
referendum It might hdae been possible today, had there been bipartisan<br />
support for this referendum, to use the opportunity provided<br />
by this seminar to look forward to the future to discuss<br />
the new and exciting era awaiting a local government system<br />
which had at last achieved due recognition in the<br />
Constitution. But because of the refusal of the Opposition to support the<br />
referendum, we have to focus today on a less edifying, but<br />
now vital, threshold question: how can we make sure we win<br />
the referendum. 006837 </p>
<p>The answer is: we can win because we can persuade the<br />
people of Australia that constitutional recognition of local<br />
government is a thoroughly deserved expression and an<br />
important expansion of the democratic-structure by which we<br />
rule ourselves.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
In 1901, when the Australian people became an independent<br />
nation under the Constitution, Australia was a smaller,<br />
simpler society, based on a smaller economy and requiring a<br />
less sophisticated political structure for the management of<br />
its day to day affairs.<br />
The province of Local Government then was largely confined<br />
to servicing property, through the provision of roads and<br />
and drainage and garbage collection.<br />
The following 80 years have seen a growth in the functions<br />
and public expectations of all levels of Government which<br />
matches the growth in population and complexity of<br />
Australian society as a whole.<br />
In that time successive Federal Governments have had<br />
increasingly to take a national perspective in developing<br />
and implementing their policies.<br />
The States too, despite being responsible for administering<br />
the system of Local Government, have encountered their<br />
difficulties in reconciling the need to apply consistent<br />
policies with the specific requirements of individual<br />
communities. These developments have left a gap between these Governments<br />
and-the people at the community level.<br />
In the last twenty years, it has been the Local Councils<br />
which have moved to fill this gap, taking responsibility for<br />
community services and forming an invaluable link between<br />
the community and the higher levels of Government.<br />
The services provided today by modern Local Government<br />
reflect the need~ s and complexities of modern Australia.<br />
They continue o'f course to do the basic property tasks-such<br />
as providing roads. But they now also provide and sponsor a<br />
much wider range of services to meet the needs of their<br />
communities. These-include * social and welfare services, town planning and<br />
environmental control, recreation and sporting facilities<br />
and cultural activities.<br />
That massive transformation alone would suggest that the<br />
time is ripe for a reconsideration of a Constitution which<br />
was drawn up iry the last century and which ignored local<br />
government. </p>
<p>The campaign to recognise local government is a campaign to<br />
ensure the Constitution is relevant to the fundamental<br />
realities of our contemporary Federal system.<br />
As the American founding father Thomas Jefferson said on the<br />
issue of constitutional refolrm: " some men look at<br />
constitutions with sanctimonious reverence, and deem them<br />
like the Ark of the Covenant, too sacred to be touched.<br />
They ascribe to the men of the preceding age a wisdom more<br />
than human, and suppose what they did to be beyond amendment<br />
we might as well require a man to wear the coat that<br />
fitted him as a boy, as civilised society to remain ever<br />
under the regime of their ancestors."<br />
The growth in the sophistication and size of local<br />
government shows that it certainly needs a new<br />
constitutional coat.<br />
The Commonwealth Government is doing its best to-see you get<br />
it. Indeed, Federal Labor Governments have a great record in<br />
recognising and supporting the immense contribution which<br />
Local Government makes to the Australian community.<br />
Through the development of the Australian Assistance Plan in<br />
the. early 1970' s came the acceptance that the Commonwealth<br />
could make direct payments to Local Government<br />
In 1986, my Government introduced the Local Government<br />
( Financial Assistance) Act as the principal conduit of<br />
Commonwealth funding for local government.<br />
This was the first piece of Commonwealth legislation to<br />
require local government to be consulted over the allocation<br />
of resources a-precursor of the referendum proposal which<br />
would extend the first constitutional recognition.<br />
Under the Act, Local Government in 1988/ 89 will receive some<br />
$ 650 million dollars in direct general assistancefrom the<br />
Commonwealth. we also beoame the first Federal Government to appoint a<br />
minister specifically responsible for local government.<br />
Tom Uren, as you all know, was a passionate advocate of the<br />
cause of local government and earned respect across the<br />
political spectrum for his tireless dedication to the<br />
promotion of local government's service to the community.<br />
Since Tom's retirement from the Ministry, Senator Margaret<br />
Reynolds has taken up the responsibility with an enthusiasm<br />
and commitment that reflects her own long experience in<br />
local government before entering Parliament.<br />
And under the new administrative arrangements I established<br />
after the last election, local government matters are<br />
brought to the direct attention of Cabinet by Clyde Holding,<br />
who is also an informed and persuasive advocate of your<br />
cause. yA, </p>
<p>It has been the determination of all these ministers that<br />
local government be involved in a genuine partnership with<br />
the Commonwealth and the States.<br />
As I said at your eighth national , conference in 1984, we<br />
seek and we need the cooperation of local government in the<br />
great tasks of community development and economic<br />
reconstruction which are before us.<br />
To this end we invited local government representatives to<br />
participate in the National Economic Summit, which we saw as<br />
an invaluable and essential means of involving the entire<br />
community in understanding and resolving the issues that<br />
face us.<br />
The care and diligence that went into local government's<br />
work at the Summit, and subsequently in the Economic<br />
Planning Advisory Council all attest to your real capacity<br />
to play a role in national policy making.<br />
Another element of the Government's support has been the<br />
establishment of the Office of Local Government.<br />
The Office's existence is a recognition of the need for<br />
Commonwealth support for Local Government to be more than<br />
just financial that there needs to be direction and<br />
theoretical underpinning for those involved in it.<br />
That office has become a respected source of information,<br />
advice and support, a focus for local government in<br />
approaching the Commonwealth, and a valuable element in<br />
improving the coordination of Commonwealth programs<br />
affecting local Government.<br />
As part of the process-leading to the referendum on<br />
recognition of Local Government, the Office of Local<br />
Government put two submissions to the Constitutional<br />
Commission strongly arguing the case for recognition.<br />
All these elements of growth in Local Government's role<br />
attest to the general recognition that it has become an<br />
indispensable part of the Government of Australia. It is<br />
this growth which has resulted in the call for formal<br />
Constitutional recognition of local government.<br />
Since 1979, four States have moved to grant the formal<br />
recognition which Local Government deserves by recognising<br />
them in their Constitutions. Only Queensland and Tasmania<br />
now do not afford this recognition.<br />
Recognition of Local Government in the Commonwealth<br />
Constitution is a natural progression and a logical<br />
complement to these moves at the State level. 0 0 6 8 4() </p>
<p>Proposals for constitutional recognition have been argued as<br />
far back as 1975, and before that the Whitlam Government had<br />
asked, in a referendum, for the power to deal directly with<br />
local government in financial matters which would have, in<br />
effect, afforded constitutional recognition.<br />
The call1 for recognition has attracted support across the<br />
political spectrum such as the-motion carried in favour of<br />
recognition at the 1985 Constitutional Convention in<br />
Brisbane with bipartisan support.<br />
The Federal opposition included constitutional recognition<br />
of local government as part of its election platform for the<br />
1987 elections.<br />
As recently as February of this year, the Opposition Leader,<br />
John Howard, expressed his support for a constitutional<br />
recognition of local government..<br />
In a letter to the Attorney-General, Lionel Bowen, Mr Howard<br />
expressed his full support for the suggestion by a municipal<br />
council in his electorate " for a chapter to be inserted in<br />
the Constitution dealing with local government".<br />
And the Liberal shadow ministry urged its backbench to<br />
support the local government referendum as well as the<br />
freedom of religion referendum.<br />
But this support had vanished by the time the Opposition<br />
came to respond in Parliament to the Government's referendum<br />
bills. The opposition decided to oppose the referendum not because<br />
of any matter of principle.<br />
They have not found the proposition wanting on its merits.<br />
They oppose it simply for the sake of opposing it a case<br />
study in political opportunism.<br />
They oppose it because, having decided to oppose two of the<br />
referendums, they decided to oppose the other two, including<br />
the local government one in the patronising belief that the<br />
Australian y oters could not discriminate among the four<br />
proposals. They opt to campaign with consistency " no" to all<br />
referendums even at the cost of campaigning against<br />
measures they actually support.<br />
Their intemperate language reveals that the Opposition<br />
parties know little about the fundamental importance of the<br />
referendum proposal.<br />
If it succeeds, the referendum will insert a new section,<br />
Section 119A in the Constitution. This section will provide 006841 </p>
<p>for each State to provide for the establishment and<br />
continuance of a system of local government<br />
for local government bodies to be elected in accordance<br />
with the laws of the State<br />
for local government bodies to be empowered to<br />
administer, and to make by-laws for, their respective<br />
areas in accordance with the laws of the State.<br />
The Opposition's assertion that the new section is mere<br />
tokenism ignores the real significance of the<br />
consititutional change we propose.<br />
It is important first to local government, which has long<br />
awaited acknowledgement of its very existence.<br />
It is important for the Constitution, that it should more<br />
accurately reflect the reality of the Federal system.<br />
It is important for the Australian system of public<br />
administration that we make the fullest and best use of the<br />
existing machinery of government.<br />
Above all it is important for Australian democracy that we<br />
accept the fact that local government bodies have authority<br />
derived from the communities that elect them, to whom they<br />
are accountable and which they represent.<br />
The real test of what is and is not " tokenist" for Local<br />
Government should not be what comes out of the tortured<br />
internal processes of the Liberal Party but what Local<br />
Government thinks of the proposal itself.<br />
And you and like-minded organisations have made it clear you<br />
support it fully.<br />
So the Opposition parties are endeavouring not only to<br />
patronise the Australian voters they are also patronising<br />
Local Government.<br />
Constitutional recognition of local government will<br />
unambiguously confirm the position of local government as an<br />
element of the Australian system of representative democracy<br />
and as an integral part of the Nation's structure of public<br />
administration. The Constitutional Commission put it this<br />
way in its May 1988 report:<br />
" Recognition in the Australian Constitution in the form<br />
proposed will give local government the necessary status<br />
as a third sphere of government, and the necessary<br />
standing to enable it to play its full and legitimate<br />
role in the structure of government in Australia, and as<br />
an equal partner in consultations about the allocation<br />
of responsibilities and resources within that<br />
structure:" 006842 </p>
<p>8.<br />
It must be appreciated that th e referendum does not diminish<br />
the States and does not add to Commonwealth powers.<br />
The proposition does not give the Commonwealth Parliament<br />
power to establish local gov ernment bodies in the States.<br />
It expressly recognises that the form and structure of local<br />
government is a matter for the States.<br />
Ultimately, the referendum seeks to enshrine the position of<br />
local government as one of three tiers of Government in a<br />
smoothly running Federal system each tier with its own<br />
powers and responsibilities and each tier dedicated to<br />
improving the quality of services it delivers to its<br />
constituents.<br />
A " yes" vote by the Australian people will establish once<br />
and for all the status of local government and its right to<br />
advise and be consulted by State and Commonwealth<br />
authorities on relevant matters.<br />
Indeed, because Local Government is the closest to the<br />
community of any level of government, the other tiers stand<br />
to gain considerably from listening to local government<br />
advice. Local government is ideally placed to recognise ' duplication<br />
of services and inefficiencies by state and commonwealth<br />
departments. It can recognise more easily poorly designed programs and<br />
poor coordination..<br />
And in many cases it can assist in the design and delivery<br />
of programs at. all levels of government to maximise<br />
efficiency. If the referendum is not carried, then the knowledge, advice<br />
and assistance which local government has to offer may be<br />
overlooked and set aside. All Australians would be the<br />
poorer. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Local Government in this country has traditionally been less<br />
about party politics and more about getting things done for<br />
the community. Its bipartisanship has been one of the great.<br />
aspects of our national life.<br />
In its approach to this referendum, the Liberal Party has<br />
got things the wrong way around: they're putting party<br />
politics ahead of the interests of the community.<br />
It disappoints me that-it has not been possible to sustain<br />
the bipartisan support for Local Government right through<br />
the referendum campaign. 006843 </p>
<p>9.<br />
Australians have an unfortunate tradition of voting against<br />
referendum questions which lack the support of both the<br />
major Parliamentary parties.<br />
But I have a great confidence that in our Bicentenary year<br />
the Australian people will d. ispense with that tradition, by<br />
voting for all four referendums. They are simple, sensible<br />
and essential reforms.<br />
But to achieve this, it will be necessary for everyone in<br />
local government to go out and argue what we all know to be<br />
true: that the time has come for Local Government to<br />
recieve its proper recognition in the Constitution of<br />
Australia. 006844 </p>
