PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
DINNER IN HONOUR OF HIS EXCELLENCY SHRI RAJIV GANDHI<br />
PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA CANBERRA 14 OCTOBER 1986<br />
Mr Prime Minister, Mrs Gandhi, Ministers Shanker and Panja,<br />
High Commissioner Ansari, Parliamentary Colleagues, Honoured<br />
Guests. It is my very great pleasure to welcome tonight a leading<br />
statesman, the Prime Minister of India, one of the world's<br />
great democracies, a man who in less than two years has<br />
brought a new vitality and purpose to international<br />
relations. Since coming to office, in tragic circumstances, Mr Prime<br />
Minister, you have brought to your position a commitment to<br />
facing the realities of our time.<br />
At home you have sought to face squarely and vigorously the<br />
problems pose by technological and structural change.<br />
Abroad, v have gained the respect of the international<br />
community : cr your decisive action on a range of issues in<br />
multila-.1 forums the Comnonwealth, the Non-Aligned<br />
moveme:: e United Nations.<br />
We fir-at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting<br />
at Nass. October last year when we had to confront the<br />
rapidly riorating situation in Southern Africa, the<br />
incres'. :. pp) ression by the So-th African security forces<br />
and the-.'. nuing intransio. nce of the Softh African<br />
Govern;-c countenance Teaningful political change.<br />
We mert in London, to consider what further action was<br />
require" he Commonwealth in the light of the Eminent<br />
Perscnf.' c-Report and the further deterioration of the<br />
situa-s! Southern Africa. I know, therefore, from my<br />
own exp:--the wisdom of your counsel and the depth of<br />
your co-: i sion and your convictions. </p>
<p>Our efforts, as Commonwealth leaders, to confront the South<br />
African problem have since been supplemented by actions<br />
taken by the major economic powers the United States,<br />
Japan and the European Community. Your leading role in the<br />
Non-Aligned Movement has further spurred international<br />
realisation of the need for action if a peaceful solution to<br />
this, one of the major moral problems facing the world, is<br />
to be achieved.<br />
Our efforts have clearly shown that the moral force which<br />
countries such as ours can bring to bear over the rather<br />
more self-centred political and economic interests of major<br />
powers can be an important force for world prosperity and<br />
freedom.<br />
Although India as a non-aligned country and Australia do<br />
not share identical approaches to foreign policy, we do<br />
share the firm belief that the major powers alone are not to<br />
be the arbiters of the world's destiny and that others have<br />
a constructive role to play.<br />
No one has more clearly demonstrated this fact than you, Mr<br />
Prime Minister. Your active involvement in some of the most<br />
difficult international issues facing us all has enhanced<br />
the respect in which India is held. Whether in efforts to<br />
resolve the Gulf War, in your previous capacity as Chairman<br />
of the NAM, or as Prime Minister of India, in pursuing the<br />
cause of disarmament in the Mexico Declaration, you have<br />
demonstrated that it need not be only the superpowers which<br />
can influence the international environment.<br />
We are both immediately concerned to promote peace and<br />
security in our region. Australia has welcomed the<br />
establishment of the South Asia Association for Regional<br />
Cc-operation and India's constructive involvement in it.<br />
ialia firmly supports your mediatory role in attempting<br />
ao '. ing about a peaceful political solution to the communal<br />
in Sri Lanka.<br />
r part, Australians have ovei :: he years increasingly<br />
to see our future in the As: a/ Pacific region.<br />
S. as I have frequently said it is vitally important to<br />
.. r : re that Australia continue to enmesh our economy<br />
: e rapidly expanding economies of East and South East<br />
-hat we accept oJi full responsibilities in the South<br />
S: and that we cont ribute actively to the political and<br />
1c wellbeing of the area.<br />
are also a courrnry on the Indian Ocean, concerned<br />
v : ecional stability to our west. Australia also has a<br />
s, interest in political harmony and economic growth for<br />
countries and peoples of South Asia, of which India is<br />
Es an; important part.<br />
I </p>
<p>3.<br />
And like India, Australia's foreign policy has more than a<br />
regional dimension. We too are concerned about global<br />
issues which fundamentally affect prosperity and peace,<br />
issues such as the establishment of a more open and fair<br />
international trading system and the creation of conditions<br />
conducive to meaningful arms control.<br />
At a time when India and Australia are extremely<br />
disappointed at the failure of the Reykjavik meeting I<br />
pledge the continued efforts of our Government to the<br />
pursuit of effective arms control and disarmament, which are<br />
central to the aspirations of both our countries.<br />
We hope that it will be possible to build upon the<br />
substantial neasure of agreement which we understand did<br />
emerge at Reykjavik in order to achieve significant<br />
reductions in nuclear weapons, leading to their ultimate<br />
elimination.<br />
Mr Prime Minister<br />
For over forty years now Australia and India have, as active<br />
Commonwealth members committed to the principles of<br />
democracy, worked well together towards reasonable and<br />
viable solutions of international and regional issues in<br />
many forums.<br />
Your visit here gives us the opportunity to readdress our<br />
bilateral relationship, a relationship which has the<br />
potential to serve, especially, the economic interests of<br />
the people of both our countries.<br />
After some years of neglect, I am glad to say that since the<br />
two of us have been in Government, there have been renewed<br />
efforts to expand our relationship, particularly in<br />
developing tne potential fox economic co-operation between<br />
oui two countries.<br />
This interest has been stimula:. ed, first and foremost, at<br />
Government level. Australia's Foreign Minister, Bill<br />
Hayden, visited lniia in May &gt; 55, a visit followed by that<br />
of the Minister for Trade, John Dawkins, in December. Mr<br />
Pant, the Indian Minister for S-eel and Mines, visited<br />
Lustralia earlier : his year.<br />
. our visit crowns : hese exchannes and I take this<br />
pportunity to say that I look forward to making an official<br />
visit to India ar an appropria-e time, to follow up my<br />
atrendance at the Commonwealth meeting in New Delhi.<br />
The result of these visits has been to bring home to<br />
7overnment and the business community on both sides the<br />
practical opportunities which exist for closer and more<br />
active co-opera. i on. Many of Australia's largest businesses<br />
are now actively involved, or interested in becoming<br />
involved, in areas as diverse as banking and investment,<br />
ship-building and port develo). rrent, optic fibre and coal<br />
technology. </p>
<p>4.<br />
Your visit here has provided an impetus for us to pursue<br />
this potential. During your stay business leaders from both<br />
our countries many of whom I am happy to see here tonight<br />
will be forming the Australia-India Business Co-operation<br />
Committee, an6 a revised Science Agreement which will<br />
facilitate projects which could have commercial application<br />
will also be signed. I am pleased, too, that a delegation<br />
of members of this Parliament will be visiting India next<br />
month on a fact-finding mission, which will further enhance<br />
the scope for our co-operation.<br />
Australia is increasingly aware of the potential of the<br />
Indian market. We believe that Australian technology is<br />
immediately adaptable to Indian needs. We both appreciate<br />
the necessity, in a world where political decisions<br />
increasingly defy economic rationality, to find new markets<br />
with old friends.<br />
In our discussions over the next two days we will have the<br />
opportunity to discuss these issues further, to set the<br />
stage for a new 2ra in our relationship, a relationship that<br />
can be much more than friendly, cordial and problem-free.<br />
We can no longer permit our cricketers to set the pace for<br />
us, although the historic tic they achieved the other day in<br />
Madras provides a model for equality and mutual benefit in<br />
international relations.<br />
In our geographic proximity, our strides in economic growth<br />
and development, and the traditions and values we share lie<br />
the ingredients for closer, more dynamic co-operation.<br />
It has been almo3t 20 years since a Prime Minister of India<br />
came to Australia on a bilateral visit. That has been too<br />
long a aan for t. o good fiiends.<br />
Your vlsi! is Therefore especially welcome, not only to my<br />
Government bit to the people of Australia who see in you a<br />
contempozary, pogress-ve, and, if I may say frankly,<br />
couragc'us leadr of a reuntry whose diversity, culture and<br />
potential have long capraied our imagination. </p>
