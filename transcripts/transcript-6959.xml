TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH JOHN HEWITT, 2MMM 12 JUNE 1986.<br />
JOURNALIST: How are you this morning after waking up and<br />
receiving quite a lot of criticism from all sides of the fence,<br />
it seems?<br />
PM: I'm durable, John. Obviously I would be less than honest is<br />
I said I wouldn't have liked a more fulsome reaction. I must say<br />
that this morning I've been on a lot of radio programs around<br />
Australia, as has Paul Keating, I must say the reaction has been<br />
very, very much better on the sound media. It has been much more<br />
positive.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, it has been said that you were prepared,<br />
and I noted in the newspapers, to gamble with the unions on wage<br />
discounting. Do you see it as being, or having been a gamble,<br />
particularly with the union reaction, the ACTU reaction to wage<br />
discounting. PM: No I'm not engaged in gambling John. I don't mind a small<br />
punt on the weekend, but I don't gamble with the Australian<br />
economy. The fact is that the world, by its reduced prices for<br />
our exports, has cut our national income by 3 per cent. I can't<br />
wave that fact away. It is a fact and we've got to take account<br />
of it. We can't just keep on trying to maintain existing<br />
standards by borrowing more overseas. That will quickly reduce<br />
this economy to nothing. So what we've got to do is adjust our<br />
standards, work harder so that we can lift our growth further and<br />
improve our standards in that way. The necessary part of that<br />
reducing of standards at this stage must come to some extent<br />
through the wages and salaries area. So it is not a gamble, it<br />
is something that has got to happen.<br />
JOURNALIST: of course there hasn't been any wage rise this year<br />
and at this stage the unions have appeared to be wanting to do as<br />
much as they can, but do you think perhaps employers are being<br />
too greedy in their criticism this morning?<br />
PM:-Well they are certainly, the spokesmen who are being quoted,<br />
being less than fair and less than accurate in their reading.<br />
Let me make these points, you're right in saying there has been<br />
restraint by the trade union movement. Let me give you a couple<br />
of statistics. under my Government the average rate of earnings<br />
increase in the Australian community has been 6 per cent per<br />
annum. Under our predecessors 11 per cent. In this period of<br />
strong economic growth in the last three years if we hadn't had<br />
the centralised wage system and if people had been out there </p>
<p>using their muscle and trying to get more they could have got it,<br />
and everyone knows that, and the business community knows it.<br />
There has been restraint and it should be recognised. I<br />
certainly recognise it. Unfortunately, as I say, the rest of the<br />
world is paying us less. Our national income is down and there<br />
has to be further adjustment. It gives me no pleasure to say to<br />
wage and salary earners in this country that there has got to be<br />
a further adjustment for the time being, but it would give me<br />
less pleasure if that wasn't done because I know that the<br />
alternative would be a massive decline in our exchange rate,<br />
rising interest rates and growing unemployment. That is the<br />
alternative. That is the way the economy would adjust if we<br />
don't do it sensibly and constructively and co-operatively in the<br />
way we are. Now you rightly go, John, to the responsibility of<br />
the business community. We don't have the same mechanisms as we<br />
do in the Arbitration Commission for wages and salaries to get<br />
the business community to do the right thing. They have to<br />
exercise their responsibility on three fronts. They are firstly,<br />
in regard to their own remuneration, directors and executives<br />
have to exercise exactly the same restraint in real terms as we<br />
expect of wage and salary earners, Secondly, they have to<br />
exercise restraint in their pricing policy. Price increases must<br />
be kept to a minimum. Thirdly, they have got to exercise<br />
responsibility in investment. Their profitability has been<br />
returned under the policies of this Government to the levels of<br />
the late 60s and early 70s, better than anything under the<br />
previous government. They've got the capacity and the<br />
opportunity to invest and invest in an environment where there<br />
will be an appropriate wages outcome. They've got to do that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, I noted in the speech last night that you<br />
called on Australians to tighten the belt and, in not as many<br />
words, said basically the honeymoon is over and the world<br />
situation means that we've all got to tone it down a little bit.<br />
we experience in getting to our audience that a lot of the<br />
listeners don't understand a number of economic terms, how big a<br />
problem, firstly, is that for you in putting across your message<br />
that people maybe don't have as good a grasp as you would like of<br />
the world situation? And secondly, is there a general feeling in<br />
Australia that we should have it easy?<br />
PM: Well let me go to both those points. Your first one is a<br />
very, very good point John, if I may say so. I understand that<br />
where we talk about a drop in our terms of trade that may be a<br />
bit difficult to understand that is why I tried to say last<br />
night, in simple terms, the world is paying us less for what we<br />
sell them and that has reduced our national capacity by 3 per<br />
cent. Let me just give you an indication of what that has meant.<br />
These massive drops in the prices for our major exports, if I<br />
could put it this way and I think this is in pretty simple terms,<br />
three years ago if we were talking about importing a medium sized<br />
car to do that we had to export 240 tons of iron ore, to import a<br />
medium sized car. Today as a result of the reduced prices we<br />
would have to export 309 tons of iron ore, or 28 per cent more<br />
iron ore we'd have to expect to get that product. If you take<br />
alumina, three years ago we'd have to export 30 tons of alumina,<br />
now we have to export 49 tons or 64 per cent more. We'd have to<br />
export 25 per cent more wool. We'd have to export 40 per cent </p>
<p>more wheat to get the car. Now that is a pretty simple and<br />
straight forward way of explaining it I think. Now that is why<br />
we've got to try and diversify our export base so that we've got<br />
more exports, absolutely and relatively in the areas of<br />
manufacture and services, which won't be so subject to the<br />
dramatic price reductions as has occurred in our rural and<br />
mineral products. In regard to the second question, do you think<br />
Australians are complacent and take it too easy? Well I think<br />
that the right answer is that in that whole period since the war<br />
there has been a sense in which we have been the lucky country.<br />
There has for a long period been a gradual decline in the terms<br />
of trade and the relative prices for our exports compared to what<br />
we pay for imports, but so often something has turned up which<br />
has got us out of the problem. Straight after the war the world<br />
was devastated and they wanted all our food products and our wool<br />
and so on, paid massive prices. we had the Korean War, the same<br />
sort of thing. we had the first mineral boom, then the second<br />
mineral boom. But a country can't keep on thinking that luck is<br />
going to come to its aid. It is not. So therefore together we<br />
have to address this problem and together try and make sure that<br />
we work harder and that business is more imaginative in expanding<br />
its base. I wonder if just on that last point, so that your<br />
listeners can understand that this is not just theoretical words<br />
from a Prime Minister, just let me briefly read to you a letter<br />
which I received just a few days ago, 6th June, from a company in<br />
Victoria. Just two or three bits from it " Dear Prime Minister,<br />
thanks to the Government's support in investing through our<br />
export and research and development grants, we are now in a<br />
position to build a $ 70 million plant late in 1986. Due to this<br />
support 250 new jobs will be created immediately and when the<br />
plant is completed this will increase a total of 500 jobs within<br />
four years". He says this " we have created now a new<br />
technology which is being sold worldwide for millions of dollars<br />
and this technology is now a market leader overseas"''. Now that<br />
is one relatively small company in Victoria. My point to the<br />
nation last night, in referring to the achievements of people<br />
like Deek and Joan Sutherland and Ben Lexcen and Bertrand, was to<br />
say the sort of things that brought them to the top can be done<br />
in manufacturing industry and service industry. And we can beat<br />
the rest of the world in those areas. And this letter which I<br />
just quoted from to you is a clear and classic example of what I<br />
mean. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, I agree with you and I think obviously<br />
there is a need for us to be able to compete with overseas<br />
markets and countries and simply to get people here buying<br />
Australian made hi-tech equipment, rather than imported gear, but<br />
is the Government going to get behind that in any big way as far<br />
as research, development that sort of thing?<br />
PM: We have already and we're going to do it more. The taxation<br />
concession of 150 per cent for new technology developments is<br />
amongst the most generous in the world. we're going to give<br />
further incentives, particularly to firms in the technology area.<br />
We're going to provide them with assistance in export drive,<br />
export education. These things are going to be done, are already<br />
being done as you can see from this letter. We're going to do<br />
even more in that area. The point I want to make is that if </p>
<p>business will respond in the way that this particular company has<br />
and we multiply that hundreds of times, as I believe we can, then<br />
we are well on the way to meeting the fundamental problem we've<br />
got. while we've got, as it is now, the best part of 40 per cent<br />
of our exports being rural products, another substantial<br />
proportion of them being mineral products, then we're always<br />
going to be at the mercy of a world which will cut those prices.<br />
Therefore, while we've got to support our rural industries and<br />
our mineral industries, we've got to get a bigger, stronger<br />
Australian manufacturing and services base because I know, not<br />
just from this letter but from my experience within Australia and<br />
overseas, I get just as much pride and I want the rest of<br />
Australia to get just as much pride when they see an Australian<br />
company tackling the rest of the world and beating them. We can<br />
do it. And that is the sort of thing we've got to do.<br />
JOURNALIST: We've got to support them as well.<br />
PM: John you couldn't be more correct. And one way in which<br />
ordinary Australians can do it is to buy Australian more than<br />
they do. Another program I did earlier this morning John, I said<br />
you look at it, Australia has got a population of 16 million<br />
people. Now if for every man, woman and child in one year we<br />
spent $ 100, each of us, on buying Australian rather than where we<br />
bought overseas products, that's $ 1.6 billion that we turn<br />
around, that we're not paying out overseas, that we're paying<br />
here to support further Australian industry. That's putting it<br />
very low. It wouldn't take very much for each one of us to<br />
substitute our purchasing to the tune of $ 100 per person per<br />
year. Now that would have a very big effect. if you double that<br />
and say $ 200 you're talking about over $ 3 billion. And you're<br />
starting in that way to have quite a significant impact on this<br />
basic problem we've got.<br />
JOURNALIST: Exactly. Mr Hawke, just finally, I've had a cable<br />
dropped in front of me that Mr Howard has challenged you to a<br />
television debate on the economy. Now I realise it may be<br />
something you'd want to think more about, but would you be<br />
prepared to do that?<br />
PM: Of course I'm not going on with these gimmicks. Let me make<br />
this point. A very simple one. Mr Howard and his opposition<br />
have had every opportunity in the Parliament to raise and debate<br />
economic matters. It is the unanimous judgment of the gallery<br />
and everyone who has watched this Parliament that they have<br />
failed dismally to address themselves to these issues. If they<br />
can't do it over the course of the weeks and months that are<br />
available to them in this Parliament, then we're not going to<br />
provide this opportunity to engage in such a gimmick. I'll go<br />
about the business of doing what we've done, -of running this<br />
economy. We had to rescue this economy from the disastrous<br />
mismanagement of John Howard. He handed over to me and to Paul<br />
Keating an economy in its worst state of crisis for 50 years<br />
the worst. The highest levels of unemployment and inflation<br />
together 50 years. In the last 12 months before I came to<br />
office another quarter of a million out of work. Now for this<br />
man, who in Government was the worst failure in the history of </p>
<p>this country, who has been an even worse and more unprincipled<br />
failure in Opposition, to talk now about him having some right to<br />
be regarded seriously in this area is a joke.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke I certainly hope that what you are doing<br />
does work and I think perhaps at this time criticism is not going<br />
to help the situation, so I hope the Government overcomes that<br />
and every single Australian can get the place working again. And<br />
thank you very much for talking to us.<br />
PM: John, I wonder if you could just allow me one minute?<br />
JOURNALIST: Certainly.<br />
PM: Firstly, I want to thank you and say of the sound media, the<br />
radios generally today, how very positive and responsive they<br />
have been. You are a very good indication of that and I thank<br />
you for it. The second thing, I'd just like to make one point<br />
because I know that you have a very large proportion of the<br />
younger age group amongst your listening audience. If I could<br />
just address myself very briefly to this question of what I'm<br />
saying about wanting to get the opportunity for the unemployed,<br />
particularly the younger unemployed, to get involved in some area<br />
of community work.<br />
JOURNALIST: Certainly I in fact had that in front of me and I<br />
put a bit of paper in front of it. Certainly, go right ahead.<br />
PM: John, the point here is that this is not something of the<br />
Government trying to impose something that I believe the<br />
community and young themselves don't want. During my work on<br />
Priority One in which your station was so helpful, may I say, I<br />
had the opportunity, which I think no other Prime Minister has<br />
created for himself, of getting around the country and listening<br />
to and talking to the young people, including the young<br />
unemployed. And one thing that came through more overwhelming<br />
than anything else was this: that if there are not jobs<br />
available, and of course that's what they want, but if there are<br />
not they wanted the opportunity of doing something in the<br />
community. They didn't want to be isolated from the community<br />
and have the only relationship with the community is when they<br />
picked up the dole cheque. They want to be able to do something.<br />
So what I'm about is to try in co-operation with voluntary<br />
organisations and the State governments and local governments and<br />
trade unions, I'm about trying to create a bank, if you like, of<br />
community work which will be available so that young people can<br />
for a couple of days a week do something for and within the<br />
community. That's what they want. It is what the community<br />
wants. We're not trying to impose something that neither the<br />
community nor they want. I believe that there will be a better<br />
relationship between the Australian society and its young<br />
unemployed in particular if there is a greater association<br />
between them than just the sterile relationship of the dole<br />
cheque. That's what we're about and I think that is good for the<br />
young people themselves and it's good for the community. It<br />
doesn't mean, in any sense, that we're cutting down on our<br />
attempts to create more jobs for them. We've well surpassed my<br />
promise of half a million new jobs in the first three years. </p>
<p>6<br />
We're going to go on trying to create more jobs. We're going to<br />
try and create more education places. We're going to create more<br />
traineeships. We're going to create more training programs in<br />
other areas. But we've got to be honest and recognise that even<br />
while we create more jobs, while we create more traineeship<br />
opportunities there are still going to be a number of young<br />
people particularly, and I don't exclude the elder people<br />
entirely either, but there are going to be still a substantial<br />
number of people who are not going to be able to be picked up in<br />
those areas. So it is there that I want to give them some<br />
greater sense of hope and purpose and association with our<br />
society. That's what it is about.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, thank you very much.<br />
