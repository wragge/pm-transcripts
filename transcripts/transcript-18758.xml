<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard today congratulated Terry Mills and the Country Liberal Party on their win in the Northern Territory election.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister also congratulated Paul Henderson, who has been an outstanding Chief Minister for the people of the Northern Territory since 2007.</p>
<p>Paul has been a dynamic and courageous leader at a time of enormous expansion and change.</p>
<p>He leaves the position of Chief Minister with an outstanding record of achievements in health and education, including a huge boost for education for remote Indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Importantly, he leaves an economy in superb condition, with an unemployment rate of just 4 per cent, down from 7.4 per cent, the envy of the developed world.</p>
<p>Above all, Paul worked so hard to secure the $34 billion INPEX Total Ichthys Project, the second biggest commercial investment in Australian history.</p>
<p>This project will deliver jobs and prosperity for Territorians for years and decades to come, and that's a fitting legacy for Paul Henderson to be remembered by.</p>
<p>It's been an honour to work with Paul during my time as Deputy Prime Minister and Prime Minister. He has been a complete professional who always put the needs of Northern Territory families first.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government has a big reform agenda in areas such as health, education, infrastructure and stronger futures for Indigenous Australians and we will continue to build on these reforms with the new Mills Government.</p>
