    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister of Australia Kevin Rudd and Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma, today announced that the next Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) will be held in Perth, Western Australia from 28 to 30 October 2011.</p>
<p>CHOGM is held every two years and is the highest consultative and policy making mechanism of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said that as a committed and active member of the Commonwealth, Australia is delighted to be hosting CHOGM for a third time - Melbourne in 1981, Coolum in 2002 and Perth in 2011.</p>
<p>Commonwealth members share a strong commitment to the fundamental principles of democracy and development, good governance, the rule of law, and the protection of human rights. CHOGM is a unique opportunity for Commonwealth leaders to work together to address significant global challenges.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister noted that "Australia and in particular Western Australia, looks forward to welcoming Commonwealth leaders and delegates to Perth for what I am confident will be a successful summit."</p>
<p>The principal venue for the meeting will be the Perth Convention and Exhibition Centre.</p>
<p>Mr Sharma observed that CHOGM brings together leaders representing around one quarter of the world's countries, and one third of the world's population.</p>
<p>"It is the opportunity for Commonwealth leaders to discuss the national and global challenges of our times, to exchange views and best practice, to find paths to peace and prosperity for all, and to deliberate on how this exceptional organisation can serve the world better", the Secretary-General said.</p>
<p>"The Commonwealth community is delighted and grateful to be hosted once again by the people and government of Australia. The Commonwealth is all about governments and people who share the same values and principles, and the will to support each other. CHOGM therefore brings together our political leaders but also civil society, young people, the business community, and many others who share the vision of this global summit in Perth being a Commonwealth meeting for a Commonwealth of its times," he added.</p>
<p>The agenda for the meeting will be set nearer the time. Leaders will focus on a wide array of issues of collective interest to the 54 member nations of the Commonwealth.</p>
