TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
CLOSING REMARKS, PREMIERS' CONFERENCE; PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
JULY 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Well thank you very much, Marshall Perron. I might just recap on a few<br />
points that Premiers and Chief Ministers have raised and then we might then<br />
retire to the cabinet room. We have a lunch scheduled for 12.30 pm that we<br />
can vary. So, at a conclusion to my remarks, I think we may, well it is really<br />
your option whether w e go to the cabinet room, or have lunch a little earlier and<br />
then return to the cabinet room, or go to the cabinet room first.<br />
Could I lust begin by addressing some general comments. A few remarks were<br />
made about the one day meeting being a farce. Well I think this belles a<br />
tremendous amount of work by officials, as you know the Commonwealth and<br />
State Treasury and central agency officials have now met consistently about<br />
this subject for some time, particularly in the national fiscal outlook statement,<br />
which is a joint statement of the Commonwealth and the States. It is the first<br />
time that It has ever been produced, it is the first time any Commonwealth<br />
Government has put estimates of receipts out into the medium term and<br />
therefore estimates of deficit or surplus, as the case may be, when I became<br />
Treasurer and John Dawkins became Minister for Finance in 1983, the then<br />
Coalition Government didn't even publish forward estimates of outlays, much<br />
less forward estimates of receipts, and forward estimates of the budget<br />
balance, or let alone give any commentary on the profile of the receipts or the<br />
outlays, or influences on the receipts or the outlays on the way through.<br />
I don't know of any federal Government, -any national governmfent in the world<br />
which publishes these sort of documents. So, the notion that this Is a day of hit<br />
and miss type of things, is wrong. I mean it Is a tip of a very large iceberg and<br />
there has got to be a point where the executive authority of the Commonwealth<br />
and the States Is brought to bear to decide things. But that Is not taken without<br />
undue consultation and understanding of the Issues which both the national<br />
fiscal statement, the new loan council arrangements and the FitzgeraldReport<br />
itself which backgrounds savings in the broad. </p>
<p>All of that means this is easily the best informed Premiers conference meeting,<br />
ever. I think that we should understand just how much progress has been<br />
made in trying to get a better understanding between us all about where our<br />
fiscal needs are.<br />
The Treasurer was just telling me the offer document went to States on<br />
Thursday as well, not Friday. So there was a number of days there to consider<br />
the distillation of the Commonwealths work In respect of the meeting.<br />
Let me just brefly comment at least on some of the points that have been<br />
made. John Fahey made the point In his opening remarks about the need for<br />
certainty in fiscal finance and arrangements between the Commonwealth and<br />
the States. We have tried to provide that in arrangements over periods of time<br />
where we thought we could see some medium term horizon, and this is the last<br />
year of a three year real terms guarantee, and we will try and devise some<br />
method where the States can have some Idea of where we think we are<br />
heading for the future. The problem with It Is the difficuity of getting the balance<br />
between certainty on the one hand and the need for flexibility on the other, In<br />
my opening remarlks I mentioned the question of the change In the world<br />
forecast and Jeff Kennett picked me up on this point about the OECD, but I will<br />
come to that in a moment, The OECD growth rates for ' 92 changed from a<br />
positive 2.7 per cent to a negative That's nearly a four per cent change in<br />
the forecast, and In 1993 from 4.3 per cent In forecast in ' 91 to .3 this year,<br />
again, for the second year in a row a 4 per cent change In the forecast.<br />
The OECD, I will come to Jeff Ken netts point, it is not a matter of we<br />
Australians comparing our growth rates to the OECD, It Is a commentary on the<br />
weight of the OECD economies in world output. They represent more than half<br />
world output, and much of Australia's prosperity. We now have commodity<br />
prices last this low In the middle eighties and I think from memory the last time<br />
they were that low was the depression. We got very low commodity prices<br />
because the US economy is down, the German economy has been in<br />
recession, and the Japanese economy has been In recession. And so with<br />
these very dramatic changes In the balance of world output, therefore we need<br />
always the flexibility to adjust our own budgetary positions. And so I think the<br />
reason while none of us, certainly on the Commonwealth side, wanted to deny<br />
States certainty about having some predicability in their revenues, we always<br />
do need that capacity to be flexible in the face of quite mammoth changes like<br />
these. These are very large changes. The fact that we are still growing at<br />
per cent -as a-developed-economy with theQOEOD shifting balance of growth,<br />
shifting to the negative for ' 92 and barely positive for ' 93 means that we are not<br />
doing too badly. But we have got to do much better, of course, for the point<br />
which John Fahey also made and that Is respect of unemployment, where of<br />
course rates of growth under about 3 per cent barely start cutting Into<br />
unemployment at all. </p>
<p>3<br />
Could I just mention, Jeff Kennett mentioned, that we should meet to discuss<br />
national outcomnes and to Improve ourselves. I mean, I don't think we should<br />
underestimate our progress, as I said In my opening remarks we are 30 per<br />
cent more competitive than we were In the middle 80s. We are now hugely<br />
competitive in terms of our exports and Import replacement by virtue of lower<br />
inflation, our wage costs, and a shift in our productivity. And as that Mcklnsey<br />
study showed and pointed out so eloquently a week or two ago the big shift in<br />
manufactured exports and elaborately transformed manufactures Is occuring<br />
not because, amongst other things, because the competitiveness or the<br />
economy, but the big shift Is In attitudes within businesses and the striking thing<br />
about that result was that the survey revealed that It was the 90 per cent of<br />
businesses that were not exporting which had exactly the same products,<br />
exactly the same opportunities and exactly the same availability of<br />
competitiveness, but we are not doing it because of attitudinal Issues. And that<br />
is our big problem getting this attitudinal shift on the part of business to look at<br />
the world as their market and not lust Australia.<br />
But in terms of our competitiveness we have been Improving quite markedly.<br />
I am always quite receptive to proposals of doing things, more things, together<br />
and I think we should. But can I just say and I do not want this to be too<br />
negative a remark about Jeff Kennett's comments, but last Friday we had one<br />
of the most depressing outcomes of any Commonwealth/ State meeting. At the<br />
meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers for Education and Training a<br />
decision was taken to defer action on major reforms and refer them back to the<br />
States and Territories. This is on the Implementation of a national curriculum. In<br />
schools and I am sure many of you know that the question of key<br />
competencies and the national curriculum In schools Is germane to the<br />
adopting of an Australian vocational certificate. which of course, Is underpinning<br />
our major reform In vocational education. One has got to ask oneself what kind<br />
of country we may be if outside of the tertiary sector of education, at the<br />
vocational area we can't get to a point where a vocational standard in technical<br />
and further education In those thousands of jobs which will be needed to power<br />
the economy along outside the tertiary area where we can't get to a national<br />
certificate for a student who wishes to participate In Industry In those terms.<br />
The more obvious thing why would we want any child not to be able to continue<br />
their education in one State coming from another to find that there Is a dramatic<br />
shift or change In the curriculum.<br />
Apparently the reason these decisions were taken was because the<br />
conservative States decided the States rights issues had to be dealt with. Jeff,<br />
I do not mind * being enjoined to do things nationally, -but If we can not even g~ ve<br />
our kids a national curriculum after five years of work on this between the<br />
Commonwealth and the States to pull out now because of some notion about<br />
States rights when the States have been absolutely the drivers in a national<br />
approach here, then you do wonder where we can ever get to anywhere cooperatively. </p>
<p>4<br />
But the general view that we should work co-operatively Is coming through, our<br />
nlational fiscal outlook, it is coming through the COAG meetings and we are.<br />
registering important gains, but I think we have got to keep the spirit going. We<br />
have all talked about Asia here today, anyone who has been to Asia particularly<br />
In the last year or two knows what tremendous opportunities are there for<br />
Australia and the notion that we should be bickering about educational<br />
standards or something between States of Australia and not approaching these<br />
markets as a unified national force is of course, folly in the long run.<br />
Can I say a couple of other things then addressing concerns which were raised<br />
by Queensland and Western Australia also South Australia, the ACT, the<br />
Northern Territory and Tasmania about fiscal equalisation.<br />
The Commonweaith Government in the last decade has remained committed to<br />
fiscal equalisation. We remain committed to fiscai equallsatlon. That is not to<br />
say that the Grants Commission should not from time to time examine the<br />
methodology and the relativlties between States and It has taken that<br />
opportunity and that Is why we seek to try and adopt a Grants Commission<br />
Report when that opportunity is taken. That is why we have sought to give<br />
expression to the current change In methodology and relatlvities coming from<br />
the Grants Commission report.<br />
We are one nation and to see ourselves as States and therefore to see only<br />
areas of advantage and comparative disadvantage Is I don't think the way to<br />
view the country and the fiscal equalisatlon has played an Important role In<br />
binding the federation together and keeping some of the smaller States<br />
committed to being part of national fiscal solutions, giving their communities a<br />
standard of living they might not otherwise enjoy.<br />
There is a view, and a very strong view from New South Wales and Victorla,<br />
and I understand the view particularly when the value of the tariff to those<br />
States has fallen and It has fallen notwithstanding the point which was made<br />
earlier about Western Australia. The fact is New South Wales and Victoria<br />
have been through a substantial adjustment to their Industrial base through<br />
protection, declines In protection, and one hopes that these Grant<br />
Commissions relativities at least understand that point and that the shift In the<br />
relativities are fair to the change of position of the various States.<br />
Can I just say a number of States took Up the question of the-Medicare<br />
agreement and Its Influence on the current outcome. At the time of signing the<br />
agreement we gave an-Indication to'States how much they would be better or<br />
worse off from the Impact of the change to Financial Assistance Grants and the<br />
Health Fund Grants Implicit in the Medicare agreement. And In that<br />
Queensland was to lose $ 47 miliion; Western Australia $ 70 million; South<br />
Australia $ 73 million; Tasmania $ 11 mlillion; and the Northern Territory $ 42<br />
million. In fact as a result of in the ' offer document' those numbers have<br />
Queensland losing $ 21.6 million; Western Australia $ 32.4 million; South<br />
Australia $ 68.5 million; Tasmania $ 1 million and the Northern Territory gaining </p>
<p>$ 36 million. The difference Is that Queensland is $ 25.4 million better off than<br />
expected to be; Western Australia is $ 37.6 million better off than expected to<br />
be; South Australia $ 4.5 million; Tasmania $ 12 million; the Northern Territory<br />
$ 78.4 million; the loser In this Is the ACT which loses $ 27.5 million and that is<br />
why we have already put special financial assistance in for the ACT and I have<br />
also In conversation with the Treasurer and the Chief Minister said that we will<br />
consider additional special assistance as well.<br />
But on the expectation versus the ' offer document' there are substantial gains in<br />
there. We thank those Premiers and Chief Ministers who did make a reference to the<br />
real terms guarantee, we think It was Important to keep that certainty, for the<br />
Commonwealth to keep Its word on those things and that we can therefore at<br />
least consider our respective responsibilities In the context of a pool which is<br />
maintained In real terms.<br />
There were many other Issues which were raised that are not appropriate here<br />
to deal with In detail. I hope I have touched on the broad ones and couid I with<br />
those words thank you for participating In the opening public session of the<br />
Premiers' Conf erence and now invite Premiers, Chief Ministers and Treasurers<br />
to the Cabinet Room.<br />
Thank you. </p>
