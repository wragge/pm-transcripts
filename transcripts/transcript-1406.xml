FOR PRESS P. M. No. 100/ 1966<br />
TALKS WITH PREMIERS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
The Prime Minister said this morning that he would<br />
discuss with Sir Henry Bolte and Mr. Askin the timing of<br />
a meeting with them and the other State Premiers.<br />
Mr. Holt said he had no wish to retreat from any<br />
earlier undertaking to hold talks with the Premiers of New<br />
South Wales and Victoria. However, as requests had now<br />
been received from all the State Premiers, it seemed<br />
preferable to meet together rather than hold a series of<br />
. separate conferences.<br />
Mr. Holt pointed out that at his press conference<br />
yesterday he had said he would propose February as a<br />
meeting date but that if Sir Henry or Mr. Askin saw<br />
problems in this he would have no wish to breach any<br />
undertaking with them.<br />
