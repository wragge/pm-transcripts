PRIME MINISTER<br />
WIK JUDGMENT<br />
I am disappointed that yesterday's High Court decision in the Wik case<br />
failed to clarify satisfactorily uncertainties concerning the effect of native title<br />
on pastoral leases.<br />
The decision appears to have overturned one of the fuindamental principles on<br />
which the community's understanding of native title had proceeded.<br />
W~ hile all pastoral leases granted prior to 1994 remain valid, and their<br />
provisions prevail over conflicting native title interests, the nature and extent of<br />
co-existence effectively depends on the inconsistency between rights conferred<br />
on the pastoralist by the relevant legislation and by the lease itself, on the one<br />
hand, and the native title rights and interests on the other hand.<br />
The stated assumption of the previous government in framing the Native Title<br />
Act was that pastoral leases extinguished native title because they conferred<br />
exclusive possession. Pastoralists could not therefore be affected by native title<br />
claims, and mining development on such leases would be unaffected.<br />
This was also the basis of the argument put by the Commonwealth to the High<br />
Cowrt in the Wik case.<br />
Also, the Coalition's policy on native title, put at the last election, was<br />
influenced in part by those same assumptions and beliefs.<br />
Yesterday's decision reversed those assumptions. In the process, it raised both<br />
ambiguities and questions which must be addresssed and resolved.<br />
In his second reading speech of 16 November 1993, the then Prime Minister<br />
emphasised that ' pastoral or agricultural leases will extinguish native title".<br />
Notwithstanding such promises made to them by the previous government,<br />
numerous pastoralists have since found themselves as respondents to native title<br />
claims and parties to native title mediations. Mining development over land<br />
covered by pastoral leases has also been delayed by the unintended need to go<br />
through the right to negotiate processes of the Native Title Act.<br />

<p>-2-<br />
The judgment therefore has obvious ramifications for the Native Title Act as<br />
currently framed. It raises questions well beyond those which the<br />
government's current amendments were proposed to address. Those<br />
amendments, due to be debated in the Autumn sittings, continue to have great<br />
merit. They have stand alone value.<br />
The government will urgently consult State and Territory governments and<br />
other interested parties about whether the Native Title Act needs to be further<br />
amended in light of yesterday's judgment.<br />
It is essential from all perspectives that there exists public confidence in the<br />
processes of the Native Title Act for managing the interface between the<br />
common law of native title and the existing land tenure system in Australia.<br />
I hope that all parties, both government and non-government, will reflect<br />
carefully on the implications of the judgment and possible policy responses.<br />
