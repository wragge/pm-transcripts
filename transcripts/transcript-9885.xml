PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
VISIT TO SINGAPORE<br />
I will pay a short visit to Singapore on 17 January 1996 to meet<br />
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and to deliver the Singapore Lecture.<br />
I am honoured to have been invited by the Institute of Southeast Asian<br />
Studies to present this lecture, which will give me an opportunity to talk<br />
about Australia's relations with the region around us and the challenges<br />
now facing Asia and the Pacific.<br />
I am looking forward to visiting Singapore again and to continuing my<br />
discussions with Prime Minister Goh about regional and bilateral issues.<br />
As I announced today at the Australia-Malaysia Society launch I will<br />
also be visiting Kuala Lumpur on 15 and 16 January. It will be my<br />
first visit to Malaysia as Prime Minister.<br />
