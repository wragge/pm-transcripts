    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Joining us today to discuss the state and future of his nation's economy</p>
<p> is Australia's Prime Minister, John Howard. Prime Minister Howard,</p>
<p> good to see you, thank you very much for joining us today.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hello. Nice to be with you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How have you done it, coming back from the troubles that beset all</p>
<p> these countries in Asia over the last couple of years?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think what's happened is that we have been able to avoid the</p>
<p> downturn in Asia because of basically two things. We made a lot of</p>
<p> changes to our economy which strengthened it. We got our budget into</p>
<p> surplus, we have reformed our labour market. A few years ago we reformed</p>
<p> our financial system and cut our tariffs and the other thing is that</p>
<p> we have managed our exchange rate policy very well and as a combination</p>
<p> those things have enabled us to shift a lot of our markets away from</p>
<p> Asia. For example, in 1998 our export growth to the United States</p>
<p> grew by 34 per cent and we have also been able to build our exports</p>
<p> to Europe as well. So it's been a combination of those things. But</p>
<p> the most important thing has been the fact that we did get our domestic</p>
<p> economic house in order and with very low inflation and a strong fiscal</p>
<p> position and a freer labour market we've been able to boost our productivity.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Now, by the same token though people who are still worried about the</p>
<p> dependence that you have on commodity exports and the like, that your</p>
<p> resource rich country but during times of commodity deflation as we've</p>
<p> seen in the last two years there's great vulnerability both in your</p>
<p> currency and in certain sectors of the economy. How do you combat</p>
<p> that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I would have thought the fact that we've been so strong and</p>
<p> successful over the last couple of years demonstrates that that is</p>
<p> not the constraint that people argue. If it had have been then we</p>
<p> wouldn't have done nearly as well over the last couple of years. Sure,</p>
<p> we'd like stronger commodity prices. We do rely a lot on our exports</p>
<p> of minerals and of farm produce but we rely on other things as well.</p>
<p> And the fact that we've been able to weather the Asian storm really</p>
<p> stare it down quite effectively despite low commodity prices indicates</p>
<p> that it's not really the constraint and the negative that some people</p>
<p> imagine.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Now, some foreign investors, some foreign companies have steered clear</p>
<p> of Australia particularly in financial services because of some punitive</p>
<p> tax rates, corporate tax rates up around 36 per cent, the capital</p>
<p> gains tax, I guess, at the high end is 47 per cent or above. You are</p>
<p> making some moves to lower those tax rates. How likely is it that</p>
<p> you'll be successful in that effort?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we've just completed the transformation of our indirect tax</p>
<p> system and delivered big personal tax cuts in a huge revamp of our</p>
<p> tax system and that went through Parliament a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p> We are now turning our attention to business taxation and the very</p>
<p> things that you have mentioned, namely the corporate tax rate, the</p>
<p> capital gains tax regime, they are going to be right at the core of</p>
<p> that examination and we'll be taking decisions on those issues very</p>
<p> soon. And I am aware that some of the existing taxation arrangements</p>
<p> do act as a disincentive particularly in the capital gains tax area</p>
<p> and we are obviously serious about trying to remove impediments as</p>
<p> much as they can be achieved.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is Parliament friendly at this time?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we don't control the Upper House, our Senate. But I would hope</p>
<p> that the Opposition parties in the Upper House would see that it's</p>
<p> in Australia's interests to make this country, our country, as attractive</p>
<p> as possible for overseas investors. And I am optimistic but we'll</p>
<p> be able to put forward some sensible reforms in the corporate and</p>
<p> capital gains tax area and win the support of the Opposition parties.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Let me ask you a little bit about gold because there was an announcement</p>
<p> from your country some months back about disgorging its holdings of</p>
<p> gold from the central bank that helped to precipitate an even further</p>
<p> decline in the price of gold. Do you have any more gold to sell or</p>
<p> is Australia out of that business at the moment?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am not going to predict whether we are in or out of it. That's</p>
<p> a matter ultimately for the Reserve Bank which is the holder of our</p>
<p> gold reserves. But the decision that was taken to which you refer</p>
<p> was obviously in our interests because it protected the value of our</p>
<p> reserve holdings and what the Reserve Bank of Australia did was essentially</p>
<p> no different from the activities of central banks in other parts of</p>
<p> the world.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But do you need to hold onto any gold that you have or are you among</p>
<p> others who believe that it's really not an asset to be owned at this</p>
<p> point?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am not going to respond to that question beyond what I have</p>
<p> just said.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>All right. Prime Minister Howard, good to see you. Thank you very</p>
<p> much for spending time with us today.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
