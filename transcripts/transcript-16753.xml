    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr Tony Negus APM, as Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (AFP).</p>
<p>Mr Negus' appointment will formally commence on 7 September 2009.</p>
<p>Mr Negus has had a distinguished 27 year career with the AFP, working in community policing, federal investigations, human resources, training and protection.</p>
<p>Currently, Mr Negus serves as Deputy Commissioner Operations, a position he has held since October 2007, with responsibility for high tech crime operations, border activities, international liaison networks, economic and special operations, forensics and the International Deployment Group.</p>
<p>Mr Negus holds a Masters Degree in Public Policy and Administration and a Graduate Diploma in Executive Leadership.  He has also completed the Executive Leadership Program at Harvard University and is a member of the Australian Institute of Company Directors (AICD).</p>
<p>In June 2005, Mr Negus was named in the Queen's Birthday honours list and awarded the Australian Police Medal (APM).</p>
<p>The Government is confident that Mr Negus' leadership skills and experience equip him for the many challenges of his new role.</p>
<p>The Government would like to acknowledge the contribution of Commissioner Mick Keelty APM in leading the AFP since 2001.</p>
<p>Mr Keelty has demonstrated outstanding leadership during a period of significant growth in the size and complexity of the AFP's operations in Australia and abroad. He has also led the AFP through a challenging period, including events such as the 2001 September 11 terrorist attacks, the Bali bombings, the Jakarta Embassy bombing, the Indian Ocean Tsunami disaster and the 2003 Canberra bushfires.</p>
<p>He has played a key role in driving greater cooperation and coordination in law enforcement operations with a number of Commonwealth and State authorities, and has forged important relationships with law enforcement partners throughout the region.</p>
<p>Mr Keelty leaves a lasting legacy at the AFP and in law enforcement generally, both in Australia and the region.</p>
