Prime Minister Julia Gillard today reaffirmed the Government's ongoing commitment to the Australian War Memorial, announcing an additional $8m per year to support its ongoing operations.</p>
<p>The increased financial support is the result of a comprehensive review ordered by the Prime Minister on funding arrangements for the Australian War Memorial.</p>
<p>The review and funding increase reflect the Gillard Government's ongoing commitment to maintain this esteemed cultural institution.</p>
<p>The new funding will increase the Memorial's operational budget by $8 million per year - on top of the Memorial's regular annual funding which is currently $38 million.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Warren Snowdon, visited the Memorial today and praised its outstanding contribution to Australian society.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government is investing in the future of the Memorial so it can continue to deliver its core activities and, importantly, prepare for the Centenary of the Anzac landings and other important military anniversaries.</p>
<p>The new funding will ensure the Memorial can adequately respond to increased demands for these events as well as supporting general enquiries, multimedia and educational programs, research centre services and professional historical advice.</p>
<p>Today's announcement also includes a one off payment of $1.7 million to begin the redevelopment of the Memorial's First World War galleries.</p>
<p>It is fitting and appropriate that in the lead up to the Centenary a permanent and enduring exhibition is developed for the First World War  -  this funding will ensure this legacy.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister also announced today that Minister Snowdon will take on a new role as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of Anzac.</p>
<p>Minister Snowdon will advise the Prime Minister on the best possible program of commemorative events for the Centenary. </p>
