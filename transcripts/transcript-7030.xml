PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF BUILDING PROGRAM FOR CAMBDEN PHARMACEUTICALS<br />
WERRIBEE 6 NOVEMBER 1986<br />
DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN<br />
OVER RECENT MONTHS A COMMON THEME IN THE SPEECHES I HAVE<br />
BEEN INVITED TO MAKE HAS BEEN THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE AS<br />
A NATION. THE THEME IS SIMPLE: AUSTRALIA MUST TAKE ON AND<br />
BEAT THE BEST IN THE WORLD IF WE ARE TO RESTORE AND THEN<br />
IMPROVE OUR LIVING STANDARDS.<br />
TODAY, I AM VERY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO SAY, IS AN OCCASION<br />
WHERE WE DON'T NEED TO TALK SO MUCH ABOUT THE CHALLENGE, BUT<br />
ABOUT HOW IT'S BEING MET. WITH CAMBDEN PHARMACEUTICALS, IT<br />
IS NOT A CASE OF WHAT SORT OF PRODUCTS WE SHOULD DEVELOP FOR<br />
THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET, BUT WHAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IN<br />
RESPONSE TO THE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO AUSTRALIAN<br />
INDUSTRY.<br />
THE BUILDING PROGRAM BEING LAUNCHED TODAY WILL SEE<br />
MILLION WORTH OF PLANT AND LABORATORIES CONSTRUCTED FOR THE<br />
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURE OF CAMBDEN PRODUCTS.<br />
BY ANY MEASURE THAT IS PROOF OF CAMBDEN'S CONFIDENCE IN ITS<br />
CAPACITY TO GROW IN COMPETITION ON TOUGH INTERNATIONAL<br />
MARKETS. CAMBDEN'S BELIEF IN ITS ABILITY TO TAKE ON THE BEST IN THE<br />
WORLD AND SUCCEED IS UNDERLINED BY ITS EXPECTATION THAT MORE<br />
THAN 80 PER CENT OF ITS SALES WILL BE EXPORTED. WITHIN FIVE<br />
YEARS THE COMPANY BELIEVES EXPORT SALES WILL REACH $ 100 Mi.<br />
WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED HERE SHOULD STAND AS AN EXAMPLE TO<br />
MANY OTHER AUSTRALIAN COMPANIES AND WORKERS.<br />
I'M SURE MOST OF YOU HERE HAVE HEARD THE INSPIRING'STORY OF<br />
HOW, NOT TOO LONG AGO, BRUCE WALLACE WAS RUNNING A PHARMACY<br />
IN COBURG. BUT, AFTER DEVISING IN A BABY'S BATH A NEW<br />
PRODUCT CALLED PSORIN, HIS COMPANY HAS NOW DEVELOPED TO THE<br />
STAGE WHERE IT HAS ALREADY SIGNED CONTRACTS WORTH $ 17.5<br />
MILLION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. </p>
<p>2.<br />
WHILST I AM RELUCTANT TO LOSE SUCH CREATIVE ENERGY FROM<br />
WITHIN MY ELECTORATE OF WILLS WHEN CAMBDEN MOVES HERE TO<br />
WERRIBEE, I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT THE EXAMPLE OF THIS DYNAMIC<br />
PERFORMANCE WILL INSPIRE OTHERS TO FOLLOW IN GENERATING NEW<br />
GROWTH WITHIN THE REGION.<br />
CAMBDEN PHARMACEUTICALS DEMONSTRATES THE ATTRIBUTES<br />
NECESSARY FOR AUSTRALIAN FIRMS TO BE SUCCESSFUL OVERSEAS:<br />
CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELVES, YOUR PRODUCT AND THOSE AROUND<br />
YOU; READINESS TO WORK WITH GREAT APPLICATION AND DEDICATION;<br />
EAGERNESS TO USE THE BEST AVAILABLE ADVICE AND<br />
TECHNOLOGY; PREPAREDNESS TO FOREGO PRESENT SATISFACTION FOR GREATER<br />
LONG TERM REWARD; AND<br />
TOTAL COMMITMENT.<br />
SINCE THE SLUMP IN THE WORLD PRICES OF OUR TRADITIONAL<br />
AGRICULTURAL AND MINERAL EXPORTS THERE HAS BEEN A RAPID<br />
RECOGNITION OF THE NEED FOR MORE COMPANIES LIKE CAMBDEN IN<br />
AUSTRALIA TODAY. WE MUST HAVE EFFICIENT, EXPORT-ORIENTED<br />
INDUSTRIES, PARTICULARLY MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES.<br />
I MAKE THE FOLLOWING SIMPLE OBSERVATIONS TO ILLUSTRATE THIS<br />
NEED: FIRST, THE FASTEST GROWING ECONOMIES OVER THE LAST<br />
DECADE OR SO HAVE BEEN THOSE WHICH HAVE PLACED GREATEST<br />
EMPHASIS ON EXPORT-ORIENTED STRATEGIES; AND<br />
SECOND, WHILE SERVICES AND MANUFACTURERS HAVE BEEN THE<br />
FASTEST GROWING COMPONENTS OF WORLD TRADE, AUSTRALIA'S<br />
SHARE OF THIS TRADE HAS DECLINED STEADILY SINCE THE<br />
EARLY SEVENTIES. </p>
<p>THE LARGE AND FUNDAMENTAL DEPRECIATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
DOLLAR HAS BOOSTED THE PRICE COMPETITIVENESS OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
INDUSTRY TO LEVELS UNSEEN SINCE THE 1960' S.<br />
THIS GREATLY ENHANCED COMPETITIVENESS HAS CREATED<br />
OPPORTUNITIES THAT MANY OF OUR BUSINESS MANAGERS HAVE NEVER<br />
EXPERIENCED BEFORE. THE tORE ENTERPRISING OF THOSE MANAGERS<br />
AND ENTREPRENEURS ARE SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO<br />
THEM AND CONVERTING THEM INTO EXPORT SALES AND SUCCESS ON<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN MARKET AGAINST IMPORTS.<br />
A FEW MONTHS AGO I VISITED THE NUCLEUS PLANT IN SYDNEY,<br />
WHICH IS ACHIEVING GREAT SUCCESS ON OVERSEAS MARKETS IN<br />
SELLING ITS NEWLY DEVELOPED BIONIC EAR AND HEART PACEMAKERS.<br />
THAT SORT OF SUCCESS IS BEING REPEATED HERE TODAY BY<br />
CAMBDEN. COMMON TO BOTH THESE VENTURES IS INNOVATION, BASED ON<br />
LOCALLY PERFORMED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. INNOVATION IS A<br />
FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT IN MAINTAINING OUR COMPETITIVENESS AND<br />
CONVERTING IT INTO EXPORT SALES AND SUCCESS AGAINST IMPORTS.<br />
THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE WILL NO LONGER NEED FOREIGN<br />
TECHNOLOGY. ON THE CONTRARY, THE CHALLENGE IS TO OBTAIN THE<br />
BEST FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY AND TO COMBINE IT WITH THE BEST<br />
AUSTRALIAN TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP PRODUCTS THAT EMBODY<br />
EXCELLENCE IN DESIGN AND QUALITY.<br />
INCREASINGLY ALL COMPANIES WILL HAVE TO INNOVATE IN ORDER TO<br />
SURVIVE. IN THE PAST, A BUSINESS STRATEGY WHICH<br />
CONCENTRATED ON FULLY DEVELOPED AND SOMEWHAT CONSERVATIVE<br />
PRODUCTS FOR THE DOMESTIC MARKET HAS BEEN RELATIVELY<br />
PROFITABLE AND RELATIVELY LOW RISK IN AUSTRALIA. BUT<br />
AUSTRALIA CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO RELY ON SO SHORT-SIGHTED A<br />
STRATEGY. WHILE INNOVATION ALSO INVOLVES RISKS THESE MAY BE<br />
GREATLY OUTWEIGHED BY THE RISKS INVOLVED IN FAILING TO<br />
INNOVATE. </p>
<p>AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, CAMBDEN'S APPROACH IS REFRESHING<br />
A STRATEGY BASED ON UTILISING AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH FACILITIES<br />
TO CREATE NEW PRODUCTS FOR WORLD MARKETS. CAMBDEN HAS<br />
RECOGNISED THE POTENTIAL REWARDS THAT WILL FLOW TO A COMPANY<br />
WHICH IS WILLING TO OFFER FUNDING, FACILITIES AND PERSONNEL<br />
FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SPECIALISED MANUFACTURING.<br />
TANGIBLE EVIDENCE OF YOUR COMMITMENT TO FOSTERING AUSTRALIAN<br />
RESEARCH IS CAMBDEN PHARMACEUTICAL'S PROVISION OF $ 100,000<br />
TO THE CSIRO DIVISION OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS TO ASSIST IN THE<br />
PURCHASE OF A CONVERGENT BEAM ELECTRON MICROSCOPE. I<br />
UNDERSTAND THAT THE DIVISION AND CAMBDEN EXPECT TO EMBARK ON<br />
A NUMBER OF COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH PROJECTS. I CAN ONLY<br />
AGREE WITH THE CHIEF OF THE DIVISION, PROFESSOR CHADDERTON,<br />
THAT CAMBDEN'S CONTRIBUTION DISPLAYS GREAT FORESIGHT AND<br />
CONFIDENCE IN OUR RESEARCH CAPABILITIES.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT IS CONSTANTLY SEEKING TO IMPROVE THE<br />
INTERFACE BETWEEN INDUSTRY, PUBLIC RESEARCH CENTRES AND OUR<br />
HIGHER EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS. BUT WE ARE ALSO<br />
ADDRESSING OTHER SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO INNOVATION AND<br />
INCREASED INVESTMENT IN R D.<br />
FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE PROVIDED INCENTIVES TO STIMULATE<br />
PRIVATE SECTOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT; IN PARTICULAR THE<br />
150% R D TAX INCENTIVE WHICH HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE FROM 1<br />
JULY 1985 AND THE COMPLEMENTARY GRANTS FOR INDUSTRY RESEARCH<br />
AND DEVELOPMENT SCHEME. THESE INCENTIVES ARE AIMED AT<br />
DIRECTLY STIMULATING FIRMS TO UNDERTAKE MORE AND LONGER TERM<br />
INVESTMENTS IN R D PROJECTS.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT HAS SUPPORTED CAMBDEN'S WORK THROUGH THE<br />
GRANTS FOR INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SCHEME AND<br />
THROUGH EXPORT GRANTS, AND THE VICTORIAN ECONOMIC<br />
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION HAS EXTENDED A $ 1M LOAN TO CAMBDEN.<br />
AND I MUST SAY, CAMBDEN'S RESPONSE TO THESE INCENTIVES HAS<br />
BEEN MAGNIFICENT. WHEN THE PLANT IS COMPLETED IT IS<br />
EXPECTED TO EMPLOY 250 PEOPLE, RISING TO ABOUT 500 WITHIN<br />
FOUR YEARS. </p>
<p>THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY CAN ONLY BE THE POORER IF WE DO NOT<br />
EXPLOIT EFFECTIVELY THE OPPORTUNITIES PROVIDED BOTH BY<br />
AUSTRALIA'S GREATLY IMPROVED COMPETITIVENESS AND OUR<br />
CAPACITY FOR APPLIED RESEARCH. NOW IS THE TIME TO BE BOTH<br />
FORWARD LOOKING AND OUTWARD LOOKING.<br />
AS CAMBDEN DEMONSTRATES, THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE THERE: BOTH<br />
THE RESEARCH TALENT AND INCENTIVE, AND THE OVERSEAS MARKETS<br />
FOR INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS.<br />
YOURS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A COMPANY WHICH RECOGNISED THAT, WITH<br />
OUR SMALL PHARMACEUTICAL MARKET, GROWTH CAN BE ACHIEVED ONLY<br />
BY CONCENTRATING ITS EFFORTS ON INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. IT<br />
HAS RECOGNISED THAT TO GROW WILL REQUIRE INNOVATION AND A<br />
SUBSTANTIAL COMMITMENT TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. IT HAS<br />
RECOGNISED THAT IN THE QUEST FOR NEW AND BETTER PRODUCTS IT<br />
PAYS DIVIDENDS TO USE ALL THE EXPERTISE AVAILABLE IN<br />
RELEVANT AREAS. IT HAS RECOGNISED THAT OUR PUBLIC RESEARCH<br />
INSTITUTIONS ARE A VALUABLE BUT ESSENTIALLY UNTAPPED<br />
RESOURCE, TO BE ASSISTED AND NURTURED, AND THAT EFFORT IS<br />
REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT THE OUTPUT OF THE INSTITUTIONS IS<br />
NOT WASTED BUT EXPLOITED TO THE BENEFIT OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
THIS ENTERPRISE IS BY NO MEANS ALONE IN HAVING THESE<br />
ATTITUDES. BUT REGRETTABLY CAMBDEN PHARMACEUTICALS IS NOT A<br />
TYPICAL AUSTRALIAN COMPANY. I HOPE THAT WILL CHANGE IN THE<br />
NEAR FUTURE, AS OTHER COMPANIES TAKE THE LEAD SHOWN BY<br />
CAMBDEN AND OTHER INNOVATIVE, EXPORT-ORIENTED COMPANIES. IN<br />
THE MEANTIME I HOPE CAMBDEN FULFILS ITS AMBITIONS AND I WISH<br />
THE MANAGEMENT AND THE STAFF AT CAMBDEN EVERY SUCCESS. </p>
