    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>So many happy riders on the train and people getting ready to ride on the train. Now we don't want to hold up any more riders on the train.</p>
<p>It is a great piece of infrastructure, as I said at the outset. It is transformative, it is key to the development of our cities, mass transit infrastructure and of course it improves the amenity and liveability of this part of Brisbane. It is a fantastic development. So, really proud to be playing such an important role in it. As I said earlier, it’s a great example of collaboration between state, federal and local government.</p>
<p>Premier, did you want to say something?</p>
<p><strong>QUEENSLAND PREMIER:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, thank you. It is a wonderful day for the community and the people of the Redcliffe peninsula. They have been waiting for over 100 years for this to happen. As I said from the outset, we work best when we all work together. When the Federal Government, the State Government and the council works together we can achieve so much, not just for our state but for our nation. So it's wonderful to have the Prime Minister here. But today is a day for the community of the Redcliffe Peninsula. Today is their day.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>Cross River Rail, what’s holding up the money for Cross River Rail?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>We've received a business plan. The Urban Infrastructure Minister received a business plan. It's gone to Infrastructure Australia. It is being assessed. There is a lot of work to be done on it. In particular, the State Government and the city government, the city government obviously have to come to a landing on the project design that they agree on.</p>
<p>It is very important that infrastructure like this is well planned, and that it is integrated into the planning of the whole city, of the whole region. Allan Sutherland has done a great job here in Moreton Bay doing that.</p>
<p>So there is a way to go, but as you know I am an absolutely unadulterated, passionate supporter of public transport and a frequent user of it.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>[Inaudible] funding though, surely that doesn’t rely [inaudible] money?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well it's important to do the work first. Now I don't want to be disagreeable on such a happy day, but if you take spending taxpayers' money seriously - and I know all of the politicians here do - you've got to do your homework carefully. Writing out cheques, which is all your taxes, without doing the homework is a good way to waste money. We are going to be very careful about it. As you know, we practice what we preach. We collaborate between state, federal and local government. The last time Anastasia and I were at a train was the Gold Coast Light Rail, which again was a collaboration between federal, state and local government. So in this regard I have a good track record in Queensland.</p>
<p><strong>QUEENSLAND PREMIER:</strong></p>
<p>We have done our homework, we have the business case with the Prime Minister and what we have seen is that with the Gold Coast Stage 2 Light Rail, the Prime Minister worked collaboratively with the State Government and with the council. Today we've seen the product of that and I hope that we can work together in the future for projects such as the M1.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>As you know the history of the M1 financing, under both Labor and LNP, federal governments and state governments for that matter, has been 50-50. That's the basis on which it is proceeding.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>[inaudible], New South Wales, New South Wales.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well it's a metropolitan road. It is an urban road and as you know, that has historically been funded 50-50.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister how concerned are you about the Newspoll results which shows you’ve lost support in [inaudible] since the election?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>We just keep on focusing on doing the job, governing and delivering. Today is a day of delivering. I will have one more question.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>[Inaudible] royal commission into the banking sector, are you confident the hearings in Canberra will [inaudible].</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>The hearings in Canberra will be very important. You’ve got to remember, this will be the first of what I expect to be many years of the Economics Committee hearing from the banks, it’s not going to be a one-off hearing. It is very important to have a change to the culture of accountability so that appearance before the people's representatives, in the people’s house in Canberra, is part of the banking calendar. This is going to be a very important way of ensuring greater accountability. I think it will give the banks the opportunity to explain their position, just as the Reserve Bank of Australia does before that same committee.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister were you asked by a second country about Kevin Rudd if Australia [inaudible] nominated as Secretary General and if so what was your response?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>On Mr Rudd, I see there are varying accounts in the newspapers. If Mr Rudd wants to be nominated by another country, that’s a matter between him and that other country.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>[Ends]</strong></p>
