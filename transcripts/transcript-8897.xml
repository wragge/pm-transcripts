STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
I have today written to the Premiers and Chief Ministers informing them of how<br />
the Commonwealth Is proceeding on the Mabo Issue.<br />
We are proposing Commonwealth legislation which will provide the framework<br />
for certainty In land management and a just and workable approach towards<br />
native title. I have Invited the Premiers and Chief Ministers to co-operate. A<br />
complementary Commonwealth State approach remains our preferred<br />
course. I am prepared to consult on the proposed legislation bilaterally with<br />
Premiers/ Chief Ministers who have accepted the fundamental premises that<br />
native title is a reality which must be recognised, Identified and dealt with justly,<br />
and that the objective Is a national approach, not fragmentation across the<br />
country. Consultation will also continue at officials level.<br />

My dear Premier<br />
Since our discussions at COAG, I have naturally given thought to how we<br />
should proceed on the Mabo issue.<br />
It has long been clear and I think that there is no disagreement about this<br />
that legislation will be required to deliver certainty and fairness in terms<br />
of land management.<br />
It remains my firm view that thc resolution of the Mabo issue is a national<br />
imperative and that we should be striving for a coherent approach across<br />
Australia. Thus I favour a legislative approach which integrates State and<br />
Territory responsibili ties for land management with Commonwealth<br />
responsibilities for setting a framework of standards and principles. You<br />
will recall that the various documents which were put on the table at<br />
COAG referred to a " national" legislative framework and that, in the final<br />
event, I referred explicitly to Commonwealth legislation.<br />
Accordingly, the Commonwealth will now focus on developing draft<br />
legislation, while continuing to address the wider Mabo issues.<br />
Notwithstanding some of the obviously strong disagreement ' s at<br />
Melbourne, we will be taking into account views expressed and progress<br />
made there. j~ 4. i<br />

We will fulfil our responsibilities to set a framework which recognises the<br />
need for just treatment of native title, workable ways of managing land<br />
throughout Australia, and the wellbeing of the economy.<br />
But we continue to seek, if possible, a complementary approach with the<br />
States and Territories. State and Territory law, processes and institutions<br />
would apply if they measure up to the requirements established in the<br />
Commonwealth bill.<br />
In essence, the following are the main matters the Bill will cover<br />
recognition, protection and appropriate ways of dealing with<br />
native title<br />
provisions to facilitate the validation of existing grants<br />
principles or bench marks for future dealings in land which<br />
impact on native title<br />
establishment of Tribunals for the registration of claims, and<br />
for their determination<br />
parameters in relation to compensation.<br />
I am preparcd to consult on the proposed legislation. My preferred<br />
outcome is to achieve a solid package, in co-operation. By the same<br />
token, individual jurisdictions will do the national interest rno service with<br />
attempts to go it alone.<br />
Suggestions have been made for a further discussion at the Premiers'<br />
Conference in early July. I think it is hard to judge at this stage whether it<br />
w6uld be fruitful to list the item on the conference agenda.<br />
I have askcd Commonwealth officials to meet with State counterparts to<br />
see what common ground can be reached and to help inform the<br />
preparation of our draft bill.<br />
I am myself prepared to talk bilaterally to Premiers/ Chief Ministers over<br />
the next couple of weeks provided the fundamental premises are accepted<br />
that * native title is a reality which must be recogniscd, identified and dealt<br />
with justly; and q. </p>
<p>~ TEL 3<br />
the objective is a national approach, not fragmentation of the<br />
approach across the country.<br />
We can then, I suggest, judge closer to the event whether it would be useful<br />
to aim for afirther formal discussion of Mabo.<br />
