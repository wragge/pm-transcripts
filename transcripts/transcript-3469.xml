PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
SURFER'S PARADISE<br />
18 NOVEMBER, 1974<br />
PRIME MINISTER: For the benefit of the news persons from the<br />
South, I should introduce you to Mrs. Marian Reed, the candidate<br />
for the Gold Coast State Electorate, and Bill Darcy, the M. L. A.<br />
for Albert. Needless to say, if Queensland's Parliament was<br />
composed on a democratic basis there would be twice as many<br />
members from this area because the electorates are the most<br />
populace in the* State.<br />
One of the refreshing things about visiting Queensland<br />
is that I'm able to read the Queensland papers first, and read<br />
the Southern ones later in the day. I must say that it was<br />
enlightening to read the Sunday Mail yesterday and the Courier<br />
Mail today. A front page box in the Sunday. Mail warned its<br />
readers that Sir Gordon Chalk had admitted wanting to be Premier<br />
instead of Mr. Ejelke-Petersen, his National Party coalition.<br />
partner. What's more he said he'd make a better job of it. This<br />
doesn't surprise me because I've said the same things myself.<br />
Given a choice between the outgoing Premier's obstructionism<br />
and his outgoing Deputy's untried potential for co-operation in<br />
the Askin/ Hamer manner, any Australian Prime Minister would say<br />
it was time for a change. Any sensible Australian Prime Minister<br />
would want that change to be in Perc Tucker's favour. I am<br />
confident that it can be.<br />
It was still interesting to read the interview Sir<br />
Gordon Chalk gave in today's Courier Mail. It just underlined<br />
all those obvious ambitions of the underrepresented Liberals in<br />
the outgoing State Government. And yet, as I said, given a<br />
choice between the two coalition partners I would go for the Liberal<br />
potential for co-operation, rather than the demonstrated Country<br />
Party obstruction. You'll notice that I keep calling it the<br />
Country Party, I can't quite get into the habit of calling it the<br />
National Party. And just when I was getting into the habit over<br />
the weekend, I find that the National Conference of this Party<br />
held in all places in Canberra, the centre itself, decided that it<br />
./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
was going to be the National Country Party.<br />
And then, of course, they also said some kind thin gs<br />
about their Liberal partners in the various State Parliaments.<br />
Perhaps I might draw your attention to the things which Sir<br />
Gordon Chalk said in the Courier Mail this morning. Sir<br />
Gordon, if he were Premier, would not be so rock-hard about:<br />
Canberra. He says: nWe've got to get round the table with these<br />
fellows and see how-many arguments we can win. We've got a<br />
Labor Government in Canberra, we've got to get rid of it, but<br />
we're stuck with it for the time being. We must have a softer<br />
line with Canberra. We have to live with them." And again: ' I've<br />
never been guilty of criticising my Premier, but what worries me<br />
is that, to him, Canberra can do nothing right. -Therehas got to<br />
be something good in Canberra, it just can't be all that bad.<br />
I'm very opposed to Canberra's political philosophy, but if<br />
Queensland and the Commonwealth are to go ahead.-there has to be<br />
some basis for harmony. How to achieve Queensland harmony with<br />
Canberra, I admit I'm not quite sure, but given the opportunity<br />
I feel I might be able to bring about a better understanding."<br />
Now, I might say a couple of local matters here. You<br />
will have noticed that the Regional Employment Development Scheme<br />
is examining proposals which come from local government bodies<br />
to promote employment locally and to do jobs which will have<br />
enduring value. Last Wednesday, at the weekely meeting of the<br />
ministers concerned, they finalised the proposals which came from<br />
the Gold Coast City Council. The Gold Coast -4t~ l Council had put<br />
in avery great number of proposals and of course they all had to<br />
be examined, but nevertheless, we are now able to go ahead with<br />
nine projects amounting in all to about $ 46,000, and I won't read<br />
them out to you, I think it would suit you best if I handed them<br />
out to you. Now the projects which are preferred are those which<br />
will give a great deal of employment. The emphasis is on<br />
-employment rather than just on materials. The Scheme will be<br />
administered by the Southport office of the Commonwealth<br />
Employment Service.. Excluding supervisory and specialist personnel<br />
all labour requirements will be drawn from persons . elegible for<br />
unemployment benefits. In selecting the labour required, preference<br />
will be given to persons with dependents who have been unemployed<br />
a/ </p>
<p>-3-<br />
for the longest time. Married persons workin part-ti~ t u on<br />
short-time will not necessarily be disqualified, however, from<br />
employment on projects. All persons employed under the schcm<br />
will be work tested for suitable employment at not less than<br />
monthly intervals and their continued employment on a project<br />
at Australian Government expense will be conditional on there<br />
being no such alternative employment. This will ensure that<br />
projects don't compete for labour with regular employers.<br />
Proposals for projects that may recieve assistance may emminate<br />
from such bodies as Local Government Authorities, Community<br />
Groups, Special Purpose Groups, Business Enterprises, or State<br />
Departments. There's another couple of matters that I might<br />
mention to you. It is unfortunately true that the Gold Coast<br />
area is the least satisfactorily sewered part. in Australia. There's<br />
only 20% of the premises which are sewered, yet it is the most<br />
rapidly growing urban area in Australia. And accordingly it is<br />
one of those areas where a State Government should move quickly<br />
with proposals, because the Australian Government has extended the<br />
whole scheme, the urban sewerage proposals, from the State<br />
capitals to places of the population of the Gold Coast or less.<br />
So that the sooner proposals can be made, by the State Government<br />
and local authorities, the sooner the money can flow. There is<br />
still dispute, of course, as to how to dispose of the effluent.<br />
Now, there can be no question that it is now possible to dispose<br />
of it in the most healthy and satisfactory because the<br />
Australian Government is making that possible.<br />
The concluding thing I want to raise of local interest<br />
is the question of public transport between the Gold Coast and<br />
Brisbane. It is of vourse, now seen to be the folly which we<br />
said it was all along, to discontinue the railway between<br />
Coolangatta and later Southport and Beenlea. I think Sir Gordon<br />
Chalk was the Minister for Transport in 1961 when the line to<br />
Coolangatta was discontinued and in 1964 when the line from<br />
Southport to Beenlea in turn was discontinued. And folly on folly,<br />
of course, they have now sold much of the track. Now the Gold<br />
Coast is easily the largest city in Australia which does not have<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
public transport by rail with other places. AnOe as I said<br />
earlier, it is the most rapidly growing area in Australia.<br />
So we would be happy as a Government, Federally, to consul~ t<br />
with the State Government on this proposal. There again,<br />
it is something which the Federal Government cannot do on its<br />
own. The Constitution prevents the Federal Parliament building<br />
any railway without the consent of the State Government. And<br />
accordingly, it does require co-operation with a State<br />
Government before this can be done. But it is very clear, that<br />
this distance, this population is ideal for having public transport.<br />
It can be quicker, safer, and cheaper than public transport by<br />
buses and it also provides an alternative for individuals. if they<br />
prefer to go by public transport instead of driving their own<br />
cars. PRIME MINISTER: Are there any questions you would like to ask me.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, after you finished reading the Courier<br />
mail this morning, did you notice * in the National Press reports<br />
that Sir Charles. Court in Western Australian has written to<br />
mining companies telling them that if they accept financial<br />
help from the Government they could not expect to get mining<br />
leases on or off-shore in Western Australia. Do you have any comment<br />
on that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I only know what I saw in the paper and it is very<br />
short. I don't want to, I haven't seen any of the letters that<br />
Sir Charles Court wrote, so I'm rather reluctant to comment about<br />
them. -It is quite an " fliin,. -company wih<br />
interests in Australia has to consider the attitude of the<br />
National , Government, because men, materials, money, coming into<br />
Australia, any materials going out of Australia do so under<br />
arrangements made with the Australian Government. State Governments<br />
do not have any authority in those matters. My Government has,<br />
tight from the outset, set out to. see, two things: that there was<br />
an increasing Australian control over natural resources,<br />
including mining resources, and secondly that there was a propor<br />
return on exports of mineral products from Australia. No Statc'<br />
has benefited more from this policy than Queensland.' Alrnady one<br />
hundred million dollars more has been got for export of minerals </p>
<p>from Queensland than would have been got under the arrangements<br />
which were in operation before my Government -3licted.<br />
Butt there's been a review of a very great number of these<br />
contracts and that review will mean that about eighteen hundred<br />
million more available for Queensland exports than would have<br />
been got under the arrangements which were there before we came<br />
in.<br />
You mention also off-shore matters, This is a matter before the<br />
High Court . In our view the attitude which Mr. Gorton' s<br />
Government took and which my Governmenthas taken will be upheld<br />
by the Court and this means that matters off-shore will in fact<br />
be'determined by the Australian Government. Up till now, the<br />
rivalry between State Governments in mineral matters-has been<br />
very much to the disadvantage of the people in the industry,<br />
because State Governments were competing with each other to<br />
provide exports at the very best terms for the overseas<br />
companies. They were cutting each others throats. Now the whole<br />
of Australia, including the States concerned, are benefiting<br />
very much more * from the co-ordinated National approach which<br />
my Government has been able to bring in.<br />
QUJESTION: Mr. Prime Minister, Sir, I announce myself ( unclear),<br />
from Gold Coast Mirror. Now, what the Gold Coast has many records,<br />
and one is that it now has the highest proportion of pensioners<br />
living in its population, of any part of Australia, in fact I<br />
think the figure is 23%. Now in view of the fact that many<br />
pensioners are living on savings that they've accumulated throuc. Out<br />
their lifetime may you tell us, Sir, what exactly is the<br />
position concerning the unearned income tax, that was propose-. 1<br />
in your September budget. Is in fact this tax on thrift tobc<br />
proceeded with and become Federal Law, because I feel it woula be<br />
a very bad move and hitting the people who are defenceless an'-,<br />
least able to help themselves in these times of rapidly rising<br />
inflation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If the new law was taken in isolation then-, Lnere:.;<br />
might be that consequence for some retired people. But, of<br />
course, this is not the only piece-of legislation. ' Most of these<br />
people would have had no hope of pensions under the arrangement </p>
<p>-6-<br />
which applied before my Government was elected. My Goverinent<br />
has now made it possible for people who are seventy-five or<br />
mor6 to receive pensions whatever their other income or<br />
property may be. To take an extreme case, a millionaire of<br />
seventy-five, can now get a full-age pension. As from next<br />
April the same will apply to everybody who, is seventy or more,<br />
and then, of course, later on it will be for everybody who is<br />
sixty-five or more. The net result is therefore, that people<br />
of those age groups will get a full pension irrespective of<br />
their incomes or their property. This will be a very great<br />
benefit to everybody who is retired. Furthermore, the age<br />
pension is being increased in its value. When we came in., the<br />
age pension was worth 20% of average weekely earnings; it's now<br />
worth about 24% ' and it's going to be brought up to 25%, so there<br />
can be no question that there will be indexation of pensions.<br />
we are determined that people who are least able to bear the<br />
consequences of inflation,-will be given every assistance to<br />
maintain their standard of living. That obviously includes pensions.<br />
QUESTION: Yes * Sir, with due respect, Sir, I fully appreciate<br />
that situation, but I did ask what is the position of the<br />
proposal to tax, to put an unearned income tax on unearned<br />
income that many pensioners are now living on and will continue<br />
to live on, because life savings have arrived at out of taxed<br />
income. Now, you did say there would be a 10% surcharge, in<br />
effect, on unearned income, which must come from bank deposits and...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Over' certain income, yes. People don't keep<br />
bank deposits on incomes effected because they don't get anything<br />
for bank deposits, savings bank deposits of those amounts. No,<br />
our attitude is it's a perfectly reasonable attitude that people<br />
shouldn't have to pay so much tax on what they earn, as they<br />
should pay on what they don't earn. But, the proposal is, of<br />
course, going ahead.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Prime Minister, in the press this morning there<br />
was a report to the effect that you said that you were havia,.<br />
just as much trouble as John Gorton in getting the Queenslnz-<br />
Government to update its aboriginal policies. Could you tell<br />
us,, Sir, why you don't put into effect the powers you had under<br />
the 1967 referendum to legislate?<br />
I, </p>
<p>-7-<br />
PRIME MINSISTER: Well, we are going to do so. We have, of<br />
course, being trying to do these things by negotiation wi-' i. the<br />
States. It's clear that negotiations are useless with the<br />
type of Government Queensland's had up to this stage. We<br />
haven't had to bring in such legislation with respect to any<br />
of the other States. New South Wales, Victoria, and now<br />
Western Australia, no the other order, but all those three Liberal<br />
States have made agreements with the Australian Government with<br />
respect to Aboriginal rights. There has been no difficulty at all,<br />
no legislation was needed therefore, but negotiations have not<br />
succeeded with the Queensland Government. So, I think we might<br />
have to resort to legislation there.<br />
QUESTION: Frank Holmes, ( unclear), Mr. Prime Minister. The<br />
State Government providea the Gold Coast City Council with a<br />
subsidy towards beach restoration as an aid to tourism.<br />
Your Government hasn't ( unclear) this, is it likely to introduce<br />
similiar aid in future?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There would have to be a very much more persuasive<br />
case than hitherto has been put. The fact is that you can't expect<br />
the taxpayers as a whole to come in and compensate Councils for<br />
their own follies. The beach along here has been eroded because<br />
people have built on sand-dunes. That is not the fault of the<br />
Australian Government.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, your opening comments with Sir Gordc.--<br />
Chalk, in dealing with him up to now, how have you found him as<br />
Deputy Premier and Treasurer?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: In a personal way, he's a very good comnz-. anion<br />
As you'd all know. Nevertheless, he is saddled with the attitude<br />
o~ f the outgoing Premier.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Prime Minister, you hold up Mr. Hamer, Victoria,<br />
as one of the co-operative members. Does it disappoint you that<br />
Mr. Hamer has rejected your application to allow the Evert Royal<br />
Commission to deal directly with Victorian agencies. As I understand<br />
it Mr. Hamer has now written back to you'saying, no the<br />
Commission will have to deal through the Premier.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I thought he was rather defencive about<br />
the matter. As you know hewever, this is not necessarily my .( 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
request or my initiative. It was an initiativa taken by'-i.<br />
Parliament, the private members on both sides. I think<br />
mover was a Liberal private member, and the seconder was one<br />
of the Labor private members, and the motion was carried on a<br />
non-Party vote, that there. should be a Royal Commission<br />
composed of, I forget how many it said, but it was to be<br />
several Royal Commissioners. It was not to be a sole Royal<br />
Commission. This was carried last year, I think it was, and<br />
accordingly it's a Parliamentary initiative. Under those<br />
circumstances, the Government should try to carry out what the<br />
Parliament has resolved so it's, but only a Government, of<br />
course can appoint a Royal Commission, only the Government can<br />
advise the Governor-General. So this Royal Commission c omposed . of<br />
Justice Elizabeth Evert, and Archbishop Felix Arnott, and Mrs.<br />
Anne Deveson, has been established by the Government because the<br />
House of Representatives passed the resolution that there should<br />
be such a Royal Commission. In those circumstances, I would have<br />
thought that Premier Hamer could have been a bit more forthcoming.<br />
It~ s not however, a Government matter.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Bjelke-Petersen opened his<br />
Government's campaign at Southport. You are here today, Mr.<br />
Bjelke-Petersen * is back here tomorrow. Therefore the camlpaign<br />
for the seat of Albert appears to have developed into something<br />
of a personality leadership matter. Do you think that mig'It be<br />
reflected in the ballor boxes. Do you hope it wii be?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, I don't think the resul in Albert will<br />
depend on the particular leaders alone, I suppose that has<br />
some impact, naturally. But, I think it will turn on the member.<br />
Bill Darcy has worked here, his wife has to, for very many years,<br />
and he was a very well known sporting figure and public figure<br />
before he was elected to the Parliament. He did very well, you'll<br />
remember on the old boundaries at a bi-election in 1970, and he<br />
got in at the last general election in-1972. And he's worked<br />
very well for the electorate. I would have no doubt that we'll<br />
retain Albert. His services deserve his return.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Prime Minister, could you tell us why Australia<br />
voted to expell'South Africa from the United Nations?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Because, South Africa was incorrigible. South </p>
<p>-9-<br />
Africa had defied the United Nations for years . ci she was<br />
not in the least contrite and in those circ7umstncs, like<br />
nearly everybody else, we voted in the Security Council as<br />
we did. Your not quite correct to say that we voted for<br />
expulsion, because that is not the Security Council's job,<br />
but we did vote in the Security Council, for a recommendation<br />
to the General Assembly which does it.<br />
QUESTION: On that question, Sir, it looks now as though<br />
South Africa is going to resign. It appears very likely. If<br />
that happens and she's no longer a member of the United Nations<br />
would your Government ( unclear) continue reciprocal trade at the<br />
level at which it's been going on?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We willcarry on trade with South Africa on the<br />
condition that the world itself accepts for that trade. We no<br />
longer officially promote trade with South Africa, as you know,<br />
but a very great number of other countries, significant countries,<br />
still do. And of course it would therefore, be quite ineffective<br />
for Australia, by herself, to just ban trade. But at any rate,<br />
there are no international arrangements for banning trade with<br />
South Africa We are urging companies with headquarters in<br />
Australia, which have subsidiaries in South Africa, to improve<br />
the condition of their African employees. We're following the<br />
p:, actice there of the United States and Britain.<br />
QUESTION: When can we expect pensions to reach 25% of average<br />
weekly earnings and how will yon thienhold th: t re ( unclear)?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would expect it to reach that nex-. t yea-, itvery<br />
nearly did when they were put up, I think it was about<br />
24 at the time when they were put up in July, wasn't it.. and i<br />
took effect from August; wasn't it, and they will he main-. ained<br />
there in accordance with the undertaking I gave on behalf of the<br />
Party when it was elected to Government, at six monthly intervals.<br />
Every Spring and Autumn.<br />
QUESTION: Will this be by Government decision or by ( unclear)<br />
indexation, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not sure. / 1O </p>
<p>QUESTION: Prime Minister, this area has one of the highest<br />
registered levels of unemployment. Do you believe that there<br />
is still a need for further measures to support those recently<br />
announced to reactivate the economy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Let me see how these are working. Did you<br />
notice the full-page advertisement by General Motors-Holden<br />
today. I think that is typical of the attitude which business<br />
will now take Get on with the job. I commend it to you.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Whitlam, there was a report in this morning's<br />
paper by an opposition spokesman that there will be 350,000<br />
unemployed by next February. What's your comments on that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wouldn't comment on that.<br />
QUESTION: Yesterday you said you used every Constitutional power..<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It takes a few months for anything that you do<br />
to have its full effect. We have acted in the ways in which we<br />
think will have, the quickest effect, but there's no doubt that<br />
the general period December, January, February, are those when<br />
traditionally unemployment figures, the number of people seeking<br />
jobs, is greatest.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, does that mean that you should have acted a few<br />
. months earlier?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think anybody knew the figures would be<br />
so bad as they were revealed on Friday week. Nobody.<br />
QUESTION: Not' even Mr. Cameron who says that he was predicting<br />
it at the beginning of this year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There were no figures to justify what Mr.<br />
Cameron was saying at that time.<br />
QUESTION: What's going to happen if there is 350,000 unemployed<br />
people... PRIME MINISTER: Well, look let's see... 71l </p>
<p>-11-<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Whitlam, Sir, last-week Mr. Hawke said the whole<br />
world was heading for tremendous economicrecession. Everyone<br />
is~ entitled to their own view. Do you believe that Australia<br />
with its unrivalved natural resources, in fact Australia, to<br />
coin a phrase, could in fact be the ' white Arabs', but won't<br />
adopt the same tactics, as you've made quite clear. Do you<br />
believe that this continent and this country could well pull<br />
out of any difficulties faster than most countries in the world?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We're going through a terribly difficult period.<br />
All the countries like us. The most difficult period for forty<br />
years. For more than forty years. And while it's true, as you<br />
say, that Australia has very great natural resources, Australia<br />
is still a very great trading country. It's no-use having all<br />
the cattle and minerals we have if-we can't sell them. And<br />
-you just can't, no trading country can isolate itself, there's very<br />
few countries, there's no developed country whi~ ch is a bigger<br />
trading country than Australia. And accordingly, it's impossible<br />
for us to isolate ourselves from what's happening with the<br />
three great groups with which we have most of our trade,'-Japan,<br />
Unites States and Western Europe. Three-quarters of our trade<br />
is with those three big blocks and they've all got the same<br />
troubles as we-have.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Prime Minister, This may be an unpolitical<br />
question... ( unclear)<br />
PRIME MINISTER: In the event which you speculate abou~ t,<br />
I would be optimistic that the vote in Queensland for the Australian<br />
Labor Party Will be such as to make even MrX. Bjelke-Petersen<br />
realise that there's nothing to be gained by continued<br />
obstruction. That he might as well get into step with all the<br />
Premiers.. I'm not saying that the Liberal Premiers are very fond<br />
of the Australian Government, but at least they are prepared to<br />
co-operate on the basic things which we've initiated. There's<br />
been no trouble, well., there was some delay, but nevertheless,<br />
you now have the necessary framework-of co-operation with the<br />
other Premiers. Take this area where we're meeting n. ow, the<br />
Morton distrc-. When we came in, we said to the Queensland<br />
Government that we were anxious to co-operate with them in </p>
<p>-12-<br />
developing three regional areas: the Moreton recaion, theritr<br />
region, you know, Capricorn from Rockhampton and so on, and the<br />
Townsville region. We've been unable to make arrangements with<br />
Queensland on any of those three regions. In every other State<br />
we are already far advanced with arrangements, and in many cases,<br />
Albury-Wodonga being the outstanding one, the arrangements have<br />
been put in legislation by the three Parliaments concerned.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Prime Minister, could you tell me if it's a fact<br />
that Commonwealth Police recently had to investigate a note from<br />
the boys of the Southport School which contained a threat to your<br />
life? PRIME MINISTER: I didn't know about it.<br />
QUESTION: Your secretary does.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, he hadn't told me. There-are two things.<br />
Anybody in my position must be getting such threats. I don't<br />
see them. And the other thing is, nobody publicises those<br />
things because it, somebody else will get the bright idea.<br />
Nobody in my position publicises these things.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, there was a demonstration on . Saturday<br />
at. your meeting by unemployed people, and there's another one<br />
outside today. I understand from reports that you can expect the<br />
same tonight. Are these demonstrations helping to ( uncl~ ear) your<br />
mind on questions of unemployment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: They are very helpful indeed. They came, the<br />
ones up in Brisbane had driven up in buses from the South Co,. st,<br />
the same bus is outside now About unemployment, of cours(',<br />
the amazing thing is that the State Government usced to pay<br />
unemployment benefits. I think there was provision for two and<br />
a half million wasn't there. Now, they've cut them out.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. PriJme Minister, your laughter doesn't indicate<br />
your laughing at unemployment.. your laughing-. at the demonstrators...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course not. I have nothing but contempt<br />
for those people that exploit these particularly where supporters<br />
of a Premier whose discontinued arrangements for unemployment ./ 13 </p>
<p>-13-<br />
benefits which ha-e been made by his State for vcory many years,<br />
as far hack as one can remember. At this tinmc!, of all timies,<br />
he goes and discontinues the arrangements,~ 1 think that'--<br />
contemptible. QUESTION: Prime Minister, this is probably the first timo in<br />
some months that you've mixed so much with ordinarv electors<br />
-iat's riet.: the iaif; ion fiom t'le rt~<br />

PRIME MINI, ; iER: Well, I just can't copj with tlh,-hospitality<br />
that's be~~ thrust upon me in the places. No, I, as always<br />
I get a veiv cordial reception in Queenslanil, atter all ther s<br />
no Southern politician who knows it so well. Ne-er has en<br />
and I would think that I would be better receivt.-.-1 all ovte. r<br />
