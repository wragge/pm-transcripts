    <content><![CDATA[<p>Thanks very much, Sam.</p>
<p>Itâs a real thrill for me to be here with my friend Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, and my friend Colin Barnett, the Premier of Western Australia.</p>
<p>It is fitting that the Prime Minister of Japan and the Prime Minister of Australia should be here together on this site, on this occasion, because almost nothing here in the Pilbara would have happened without the cooperation of Australia and Japan.</p>
<p>The iron ore industry of the Pilbara is the result of a historic collaboration, a historic partnership between Australian mining knowhow and Japanese capital and technology. I want to thank Sam Walsh and everyone associated with Rio Tinto for their contribution to the wealth of our country, but I also want to thank Rioâs Japanese partners, particularly Mimura-san of Nippon Steel and Iijima-san of Mitsui because none of this would have happened, could have happened, without this rich and collaborative partnership which has now extended for about a half a century.</p>
<p>This partnership has had two defining characteristics.</p>
<p>First, itâs been a long term partnership. It was made possible by the readiness of Nippon and Mitsui and the other Japanese customers to enter into long term contracts with Australian suppliers.</p>
<p>Second, itâs been built on trust. Trust by Rio, trust by Nippon and Mitsui that each side of this partnership would keep its word that everyone involved in this partnership has been a person you could rely on.</p>
<p>That is what I hope will always characterise the relationship between Australia and Japan; trust, good faith, confidence Â­- that we will do what we say we will do.</p>
<p>It was my privilege and pleasure to spend five hours in the plane with my friend Shinzo Abe on the way from Canberra to the Pilbara. Apart from enjoying Shinzoâs company two things struck me on this trip, first the vastness of our country and second the richness of our country. This leads to one overwhelming conclusion â the potential of our country and the potential of our partnership. As far as I can make out, Shinzo, you are the first Japanese Prime Minister to visit the Pilbara since 1974 when Prime Minister Tanaka came to this country. I hope it wonât be 40 years till the next Prime Minister comes, but whenever the Prime Minister of Japan comes to this part of Australia he is a most welcome friend.</p>
