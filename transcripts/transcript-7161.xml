PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 7 APRIL 1987<br />
Today I launched Phase Two of the Australian Made campaign at the<br />
Greensborough Shopping Centre in Melbourne.<br />
The Australian made campaign launched last August as part of a<br />
national drive to increase consumer awareness and preference for<br />
locally made products has shown that Australians want to buy<br />
local products and that local manufacturers are capable of<br />
producing goods which are competitive in price and quality with<br />
imports. The campaign has succeeded in changing entrenched attitudes<br />
towards imports, with 67 per cent of Australians now buying local<br />
products most of the time.<br />
As a measure of the success of the first phase of the campaign,<br />
more than 800 manufacturers have signed up with the Advance<br />
Australia Foundation to use the Australian made logo.<br />
Australian Made Phase Two is being supported by a national print<br />
media advertising campaign designed to point to the benefits of<br />
using the Australian made logo and its acceptance by consumers.<br />
In response to consumer demand for products to be clearly<br />
identified as Australian* made, a direct mail campaign to 10,000<br />
manufacturers is being conducted.<br />
Retailers are also showing their support for the Australian made<br />
cdmpaign with major promotions similar to Greensborough being<br />
held around Australia on a regular basis.<br />
Administration of the campaign will continue to be through the<br />
Advance Australia Foundation which will control issue of the logo<br />
and protection against misuse of it. </p>
