Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Innovation Minister Senator Kim Carr today announced a new $249 million package designed to help Australian industries become more competitive and create new job opportunities.</p>
<p>The Industry Transformation Research program and cadetshippackage includes:</p>
<p> * 	More than 1,000 engineering cadetships over the next four years so students can get the work experience they need to kick-start their careers in manufacturing and other Australian industries.<br />
 * 	Newresearch training centres that will provide quality industrial doctoral and postdoctoral training for up to 600 PhD students each year.<br />
 * 	Newresearchhubs bringing researchers and industry representatives together to design and engineer commercially and technically viable solutions to some of our most pressing industrial problems.</p>
<p>These new measures are part of the Labor Government's commitment to a more competitive and research focused manufacturing sector creating quality jobs and building the industries of the future.</p>
<p>Australiais endowed with top quality researchers and top quality industry  -  this new alliance bringing the two together just makes good sense.</p>
<p>As a result, Australia's research effort will be better aligned with the needs of Australian industry.</p>
<p>This Government has provided researchers with the best research infrastructure the country can afford  -  now we can give these cadets the best training experiences too.</p>
<p>Manufacturers will have the benefit of additional research expertise and knowledge to tackle difficult problems in key sectors such as metals, food, energy, textiles, building and automotive.</p>
