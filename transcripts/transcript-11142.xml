<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what's better, the GST passed by the Senate or</p>
<p> Australia winning the World Cup?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh gee, don't put me on the rack. Oh well, you know my passions</p>
<p> about cricket and it was tremendous. But the GST going through the</p>
<p> Senate is the end of what I guess is a almost a 25 year odyssey. I've</p>
<p> been trying now myself for something close to 20 years to get fundamental</p>
<p> tax reform in this country and it is now I think within real reach.</p>
<p> I can't imagine that the legislation as amended will be rejected</p>
<p> in the House of Representatives where the Government has a healthy</p>
<p> majority. So I want to express my gratitude to the Senate leadership</p>
<p> of my own Government, to Robert Hill, to Rod Kemp and to Ian Campbell</p>
<p> for their work. I want to thank the Australian Democrats for the faithfulness</p>
<p> of the commitment they made after we'd reached an agreement.</p>
<p> They were straight-forward and direct in their negotiations. We have</p>
<p> a better tax system and as a result we'll have a stronger economy.</p>
<p> And I'm proud that once again the Government has been able to</p>
<p> do things. We are a Government that does things. Unfortunately our</p>
<p> opponents knock and say no and I think the Australian public's</p>
<p> getting tired of that. They're tired of Oppositions that bag</p>
<p> and criticise and nark rather than occasionally getting behind the</p>
<p> Government and saying well we agree with that, even though we'd</p>
<p> like to replace them we agree with that. And I think the Australian</p>
<p> public's well of patience for that is starting to run a little</p>
<p> dry.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How important to you is it after a quarter-of-a-century in politics</p>
<p> to see tax reform come to fruition?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's very important personally because I'd known for 20</p>
<p> years that we've needed fundamental reform of our tax system.</p>
<p> You go into public life to do things for the betterment of the country,</p>
<p> not to have a white car and the perks such as they may or may not</p>
<p> be of office, but to actually do things to achieve something. And</p>
<p> I feel a sense of achievement about this like virtually none other,</p>
<p> and it's a great sense and it's a great feeling. And I guess</p>
<p> when it finally goes through the House of Representatives I'll</p>
<p> know finally and for sure it's over, although I get a sneaky</p>
<p> suspicion we might get it through the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is it a testament to your true Australian grit?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look I'll leave it for others to make observations about my</p>
<p> personal commitment or otherwise. But I've certainly been trying</p>
<p> a long time and I have a tremendous sense of personal achievement</p>
<p> and my party has too. And I want to thank Peter Costello very warmly</p>
<p> for what he's done because Peter has carried the detail of it</p>
<p> and he's carried it very well and he's carried it with great</p>
<p> persistence and great skill and great flair. And it thank him very</p>
<p> warmly for the role that he's played behind me.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What's your priority now Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the priority now is to go on governing well for the people of</p>
<p> Australia. And we've got the business tax reform plan coming</p>
<p> out soon, and there will be other few things around the corner. I've</p>
<p> always got a few surprises. I think part of political life is to have</p>
<p> the odd surprise and we go onto the Federal Council meeting of the</p>
<p> Liberal Party at the weekend which will celebrate the great Liberal</p>
<p> family and it will be an opportunity for us to talk about the future</p>
<p> and to throw forward to the remainder of the Government's second</p>
<p> term.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>PM, you're heading abroad in seven days.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I am.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>....so what sort of message does today's decision by the Senate</p>
<p> send out to our trading partners?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it sends a very clear message to the rest of the world that this</p>
<p> is country and this Government is serious about economic reform. It's</p>
<p> serious about being competitive. We have stared down the worst of</p>
<p> the Asian economic downturn but we're showing that today's</p>
<p> strength is a product of yesterday's reform. Today's reform</p>
<p> will deliver tomorrow's strength. And what this means is that</p>
<p> in a few years time the Australian economy will be even stronger because</p>
<p> we'll have a more competitive tax system.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And your new found ally in the Senate, how do you see that working</p>
<p> with the Democrats...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We will deal with the Democrats in good faith on each individual issue.</p>
<p> I don't make blanket predictions. It's ridiculous to do</p>
<p> so. I have found in relation to tax that they are a group of men and</p>
<p> women who deal directly and honestly and candidly and on other issues</p>
<p> we'll reach agreement, on others we won't. I don't</p>
<p> have any starry eyed delusions but equally I have a determination</p>
<p> to do what I can to secure there support on important issues.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think the Democrats have an obligation to sell the GST now</p>
<p> throughout its implementation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's the Government's responsibility to sell, as you put</p>
<p> it, the GST because it was our proposal and we don't shirk from</p>
<p> that and we will make the resources available to ensure that the Australian</p>
<p> public is fully aware of the enormous benefits and the enormous advantages</p>
<p> as well as a way in which this new proposal operates. One more question.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you have empathy for some of the political flak that the Democrats</p>
<p> have been taking over the GST and also the environment legislation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think they've handled themselves very well, very well indeed.</p>
<p> We all endure political flak. I think I can spell the work myself.</p>
<p> Thank you. Goodnight.</p>
