EMBARGO: 5PM UDAY<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S WEEKLY BROADCAST L<br />
THE REAL THREAT TO MEDIBANK<br />
SUNDAY 7 SEPTEMBER 1975<br />
IN MY BROADCAST LAST WEEK I MADE THE POINT THAT<br />
WHILE MR FRASER KEEPS TALKING ABOUT THE NEED TO CUT<br />
GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE, HE NEVER SPELLS OUT CONVINCINGLY<br />
O WHERE THE CUTS WOULD COME FROM IF THE LIBERALS HAD THEIR<br />
WAY) I SAID LAST WEEK: " IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH IMAGINATION<br />
TO SEE W ERE THE REAL CUTS WOULD BE MADE... THEY WOULD COME<br />
__.-FROM OUR PROGRAMS FOR BETTER HEALTH SERVICES AND HOSPITALS,<br />
FOR ADEQUATE SOCIAL SECURITY)
FOR MR FRASER'S ECONOMIC POLICIES ARE THE POOR, THE NEEDY,<br />
THE SICK11 I SUPPOSE I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THE LIBERALS MORE<br />
CREDIT FOR FRANKNESSy AT THE VERY MOMENT I WAS ISSUING<br />
THIS WARNING MR CHIPP LET THE CAT OUT OF THE BAGk. HE SPELT<br />
O OUT QUITE CLEARLY AND UNMISTAKABLY IN BRUTAL AND<br />
UNEQUIVOCAL TERMS THAT IF THE LIBERALS GOT BACK INTO<br />
OFFICE THE FIRST THING THEY WOULD DO WOULD BE TO KILL<br />
MEDIBANKk THERE WAS NO HEDGING OR QUALIFICATION ABOUT IT..<br />
I'*<br />
MEDIBANK WAS A " MONSTER'.. MEDIBANK WOULD BE DISMANTLED)<br />
THE OPPOSITION WOULD RETURN TO A SYSTEM OF PRIVATE<br />
HEALTH INSURANCE" THOSE WERE MR CHIPP'S OWN WORDS AND<br />
THEY WERE QUOTED IN ALL THE PAPERS LAST WEEKEND. ./ 2 </p>
<p>NOW MR CHIPP IS NOT JUST AN OPPOSITION<br />
BACKBENCHER AIRING HIS PRIVATE THEORIES.-HE IS THE<br />
OPPOSITION'S OFFICIAL SPOKESMAN ON SOCIAL SECURITY<br />
WE MUST ASSUME THAT IN SOME THINGS AT LEAST HE KNOWS.<br />
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. WE MUST ASSUME THAT WHEN HE<br />
TALKS ABOUT MEDIBANK HE IS EXPRESSING THE OFFICIAL<br />
POLICY OF THE OPPOSITION,-AND IN FACT HE IS STILL<br />
THEIR OFFICIAL SPOKESMAN ON THESE MATTERSk. IT IS<br />
TRUE THAT HIS OPPOSITION COLLEAGUES ISSUED ALL SORTS OF<br />
QUALIFYING STATEMENTS AND DENIALSX) MR FRASER DID<br />
HIS BEST TO COVER UP AND TALKED ABOUT WAYS OF " AMENDING"<br />
MEDIBANK " AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME" K IT IS TRUE<br />
THAT MR CHIPP WAS HUMILIATED AT HIS PARTY MEETING ON<br />
TUESDAY AND FORCED TO DENY WHAT HE'D SAID ON SATURDAY.,<br />
BUT THE DAMAGE HAD BEEN DONEr-WE WERE GIVEN THE CLEAREST<br />
INDICATION YET OF THE OPPOSITION'S INTENTIONS, THEIR<br />
HATRED OF MEDIBANK, AND THE SORT OF " ECONOMIES" THEY<br />
WOULD MAKE IF GIVEN HALF A CHANCE. / 3 i </p>
<p>31<br />
IT IS SIMPLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR MR FRASER TO<br />
DENY WHAT HIS COLLEAGUE SAID AND HOPE THE WHOLE ISSUE WILL<br />
BLOW OVER) WHEN IT COMES TO MEDIBANK THE LIBERALS<br />
JUST CANNOT BE TRUSTED) Y YOU ONLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THEIR.<br />
RECORD IN THE LATE 1940s AS A RESULT OF THE CHIFLEY<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES, EVERY STATE IN AUSTRALIA HAD<br />
A FREE HOSPITAL SCHEME. WHEN THE LIBERALS GOT IN, THEY<br />
BROKE OFF THESE AGREEMENTS WITH THE STATES IN THE EARLY<br />
1950S AND MADE PEOPLE PAY FOR THEIR HOSPITAL TREATMENT<br />
IN STANDARD WARDS). THE ONLY STATE THAT KEPT ITS FREE<br />
HOSPITALS GOING WAS QUEENSLAND AND THAT WAS DUE TO A<br />
STATE LABOR GOVERNMENT NOW, OF COURSE, EVEN THE PRESENT<br />
DISCREDITED QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT HAS ACCEPTED THE<br />
MEDIBANK SCHEMEk( THEY HAVE FALLEN INTO LINE WITH ALL<br />
THE OTHBR STATES WHO FOUGHT MEDIBANK FOR SO LONG) BUT<br />
WHATEVER THE STATES MAY SAY OR DO, WE CAN BE SURE THAT IF<br />
THE LIBERALS IN CANBERRA GOT A CHANCE TO DESTROY MEDIBANK<br />
THEY WOULD DO SO, THEY HAVE DONE IT BEFORE; THEY<br />
WOULD DO IT AGAIN, ./ 4 </p>
<p>THE OPPOSITION AND THE PRESS TALK BLITHELY<br />
ABOUT MEDIBANK BEING A FACT OF LIFE, THE SAME<br />
POLITICIANS AND NEWSPAPERS THAT KEPT ON DENOUNCING<br />
MEDIBANK WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO SET IT UP NOW<br />
POINT UNASHAMEDLY TO ITS VIRTUES* DOES ANYONE<br />
SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT THE OPPOSITION, WHICH FOUGHT<br />
MEDIBANK TOOTH AND NAIL FOR SO LONG* COULD SUDDENLY<br />
BE TRUSTED TO KEEP IT GOING? THEIR STATEMENTS<br />
ARE A TISSUE OF CONTRADICTIONSk AT FIRST MR CHIPP<br />
S. DENIED THAT HE HAD THREATENED MEDIBANK AT ALLk THEN<br />
HE MODIFIED THIS TO SAY THAT ONLY THE HOSPITAL<br />
O SIDE WOULD BE DROPPED( So FIRST WE HAD THE IMPRESSION<br />
THAT IT WOULD ALL BE DROPPED, THEN THAT NONE OF IT WOULD<br />
BE DROPPED, AND NOW THAT ONLY THE HOSPITAL SIDE WOULD<br />
BE. DROPPED)( ONLY A WEEK BEFORE HE WAS CONTRADICTING HIS<br />
SHADOW MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITY, ONLY A WEEK BEFORE<br />
MR CHIPP WAS FORCED TO RECANT, MR FRASER HIMSELF REACTED<br />
TO OUR BUDGET PROPOSALS WITH THE OBSERVATION<br />
A STUPIDLY. INACCURATE OBSERVATION, AS IT<br />
O HAPPENS THAT IF IT WEREN'T FOR MEDIBANK, THE BUDGET<br />
DEFICIT WOULD BE ONLY HALF AS GREAT), CAN ANY RATIONAL<br />
PERSON DOUBT THAT THE DESTRUCTION OF MEDIBANK IS VERY MUCH<br />
IN THE MINDS OF THE OPPOSITION? WHENEVER THEIR GUARD<br />
IS DOWN THEY MAKE THEIR INTENTIONS CLEAR. m </p>
<p>THE RECORD OF LIBERAL OBSTRUCTION AND HYPOCRISY<br />
OVER MEDIBANK HAS BEEN UNBELIEVABLEA THEY FOUGHT IT<br />
AT EVERY STAGE WHEN THE LEGISLATION WAS GOING THROUGH<br />
PARLIAMENTK( THE PEOPLE HAD TWICE ENDORSED THE PROPOSALS<br />
AT THE ELECTIONS IN 1972 AND 1974, YET THE OPPOSITION<br />
VOTED AGAINST THE BILLS, EVEN AT THE SPECIAL JOINT<br />
SITTING OF PARLIAMENT WHICH WAS HELD AFTER THE DOUBLE<br />
DISSOLUTION-NOW THEY TALK ABOUT MEDIBANK BEING A FACT<br />
OF LIFEk, EVEN AFTER THE MEDIBANK BILLS WERE PASSED<br />
THE OPPOSITION BLOCKED A BILL FOR A SPECIAL LEVY TO<br />
HELP FINANCE THE SCHEMEK YET NOW THEY GO ON ABOUT THE COST<br />
O THE GENERAL BUDGET) NOW THEY SAY THAT AFTER ALL<br />
THEY MIGHT JUST MIGHT LET THE LEVY PASS IF WE<br />
PUT IT UP AGAINX THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANTe<br />
BUT ONE THING IS CERTAIN: IF THE LIBERALS GOT<br />
BACK INTO OFFICE MEDIBANK WOULD BE DEMOLISHEDK<br />
ONE OF THE GREATEST SOCIAL REFORMS IN AUSTRALIAN HISTORY<br />
WOULD BE DISMANTLED) HEALTH CARE, THE RIGHT OF ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS, WOULD AGAIN BE A SOURCE OF WORRY AND EXPENSE<br />
AND INCONVENIENCE A BURDEN TO THE NEEDY AND<br />
A PRIVILEGE TO THE WEALTHYX </p>
<p>ONE WAY AND ANOTHER IT'S BEEN A REVEALING WEEK<br />
IN POLITICSX EVEN IN LITTLE THINGS WE'VE SEEN THE OPPOSITION<br />
PARTIES IN THEIR TRUE COLOURS)( THE SAME MR-CHIPP, FOR<br />
EXAMPLE, WAS REFUSING A WOMAN SENATOR THE RIGHT TO PLAY IN A<br />
PARLIAMENTARY CRICKET TEAM, OTHER LIBERALS WERE BUSY ATTACKING<br />
ANOTHER WOMAN IN CANBERRA A WOMAN APPOINTED ON HER MERITS<br />
BY THE PUBLIC SERVICE BOARD TO A NEWWIDELY ADVERTISED POSITION<br />
ON THE BOARD'S STAFF) HER CRIME WAS THAT HER HUSBAND ALREADY<br />
HAD A SENIOR PUBLIC SERVICE POSITION, SO APPARENTLY SHE<br />
WASN'T ENTITLED TO A JOB OF HER OWNX THEY'VE BEEN WHINGEING<br />
ABOUT A WOMEN'S CONVENTION IN CANBERRAX THEY'VE BEEN SABLERATTLING<br />
OVER TIMOR,, K IN QUEENSLAND WE'VE SEEN THE UTTERLY<br />
DEGRADING PERFORMANCE OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND PREMIER<br />
OVER THE SENATE VACANCY BLACKENING THE NAME OF A RESPECTED<br />
CITIZEN UNDER PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGE, DESTROYING DEMOCRATIC<br />
CONVENTIONS, DEFYIN6 THE WISHES OF THE LIBERALSIN CANBERRA7<br />
AND SPLITTING THEIR OWN DISCREDITED COALITION IN THE PROCESS)(<br />
IN NEW SOUTH WALES WE'VE SEEN THE LEWIS GOVERNMENT PLANNING<br />
DRASTIC CUTS IN SUBURBAN TRANSPORT SERVICES AND EDUCATION)(<br />
THERE IS NO ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION FOR THESE CUTSX MY<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS REPEATEDLY OFFERED TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY<br />
FOR NEW SOUTH WALES RAILWAYS AND HAS MADE AVAILABLE UNPRECEDENTED<br />
SUMS FOR URBAN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND EDUCATION) ,/ 7 </p>
<p>I LEAVE YOU WITH IEE* THOUGHT: IF THE<br />
LIBERALS ARE PREPARED TO SLASH THESE ESSENTIAL<br />
SERVICES WHEN THEY HAVE THE MONEY FOR THEM, IMAGINE<br />
WHAT MR FRASER AND MR ANTHONY WOULD DO IN THE SACRED.<br />
NAME OF CUTTING GOVERNMENT EXPENDITUREX THERE'D<br />
BE NO END TO THE SLAUGHTER OF ESSENTIAL PUBLIC SERVICES.-<br />
HEALTHEDUCATION, HOUSING, TRANSPORT, WELFAREX THE<br />
DESTRUCTION OF MEDIBANK WOULD BE ONLY PART OF THE STORY(<br />
WE SHOULD KEEP THESE THREATS IN MIND WHEN THE LIBERALS<br />
ASSURE US THAT MEDIBANK IS A " FACT OF LIFE." </p>
