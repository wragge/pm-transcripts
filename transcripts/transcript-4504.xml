FOR PRESS 27 SET1~ 1bffvR 1977<br />
ADORESS AT OPENJINGOF Sfl1NAM RETIRKf4EtT VILLAGE, BRISBANE<br />
It was with great pleasure that I accepted the Reverend Ray Hunt's<br />
invitation to open Sinnamon. Retirement'Village.<br />
During~ the past two years, 1, have taken advantage of opportunities<br />
as -they arose to familiarise myself with the -varied welfare activities<br />
. conducted ! ay agencies which now form part of the NewUniting Church<br />
of Australia. These agencies provide many types of wide-ranging<br />
programms serving the social and spiritual needs of the<br />
community.. I have been impressed by the sense of? genuine<br />
commitment and the very effective action displayed by these,<br />
and other,. voluntary agencies.<br />
The opening of Sinnamon Retirement Village is furthier illustrative<br />
of the church's continuing commitment to rmeeting the needs of the<br />
aged in Brisbane.<br />
* This compiax,. which will provide accommodation for-three hundred<br />
. aged-people and twelve resident staff,-is the product-of a<br />
partnership between the Wesley CentrallMission and the Commonwealth<br />
Government. Indeed, this village has attracted one of the largest<br />
Commnwelthgrants $ 4.5 million ever, provided for a project<br />
of its kind; and further consideration will be-given to Increasing<br />
the grant under the Aged Pensions Hostels Act when full costs are<br />
known and have been submitted to mycolage the M4inister for<br />
Social Security.<br />
.1 Government's social welfare philosophy placesgetepai<br />
on co-operative effort by community groups.+ We believe that<br />
interaction by individuals, groups and government at all Levelsis<br />
absolutely necessary for an effective approach to social welfare.<br />
* As a Government, we see' one -of our mAJor* roles as enhancing the<br />
* ability of-the voluntary welfare sector to provide services-and<br />
facilities to those members of the community in need. it is-these<br />
sier-vices that provide one very. Important back-up to the'<br />
Commonwealth's programme of support for individuals. : Our*<br />
roles are complementary.<br />
There are many areas in which Government services-can never-hope to<br />
match the services which voluntary agencies can provide. Vlntr<br />
agencies have an inherent flexibility which makes. them well placed<br />
* to meet mvany of thie special needs9 of the aged &amp; nd disadvan~ taged in<br />
a complex industrial soc iety. </p>
