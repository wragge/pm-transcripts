? ROME M WSTER<br />
FOR PRESS 10MARCH 1978<br />
THE BROOKLYN ABBATOIR<br />
The Pr ime Minister, Mr Fraser, and the Premier of Victoria,<br />
Mr Hamer, today announced that their respective governments<br />
* had agreed to guarantee a commercial borrowing by<br />
Cooperative Farmers and Graziers Direct Meat Supply Ltd.<br />
of $ 9 million. The guarantee is to be provided on<br />
a 50-50 basis by the two governments.<br />
The guarantee will enable C. F. G. to raise a commercial loan<br />
of $ 9 million which, together with other funds, will enable the<br />
Cooperative's creditors to be paid.<br />
C. F. G. has been in the hands of the Receiver since 1975.<br />
The Brooklyn Abbatoir, its principal asset, is in the process<br />
of being sold.<br />
The Directors of C. F. G. have indicated that with the aid of the<br />
guarantee they will oppose the sanctioning of the proposed<br />
sale by the Supreme Court of Victoria.<br />
The Cooperative is presently trading profitably and neither<br />
Government thought it desirable that it should be forced to<br />
go into liquidation. Both Governments are confident that<br />
the Cooperative will continue to trade profitably and will<br />
trade itself out of its past problems.<br />
The Brooklyn works is-one of the largest and most modemn in<br />
Australia. Both Governments are anxious that it continues<br />
to operate profitably and in the overall interests of the industry. </p>
