ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING, ACADEMIC SESSION, OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN COLLEGE OF GENERAL PHICTITIONERS, AT<br />
WILSON HALL, UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE<br />
ADMISSION OF SIR ROBERT PJENZIES AS AN HONORARY<br />
FELLOW: J OF THE COLLEGE 9TH OCTOBE__ 126+<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. Sir Robet -le<br />
Your Excellency and Sir<br />
This shors how wrong one may be, because I came<br />
here tonight saying to myself, " His Excellency the Governor<br />
will make a speech and I'll be able to pick up a crumb or<br />
two, and then my old friend, Sir Victor Coppleson, he will<br />
speak." Not he. silent as the tomb, and therefore all<br />
that is left for me to do is to say thank you very much, Sir.<br />
I appreciate this honour, and in a strange, odd<br />
fashion, you know, I have rather earned it. Would you<br />
mind if I developed that theory a little?<br />
As you know, in the course of a life of a man<br />
like me, one acquires certain things by merit and other<br />
things by favour, I managed to get a degree or two in<br />
this university by working for them and in later years I<br />
have been given a series of unearned honours which give me<br />
the most immense satisfaction. For eximple, I am a surgeon.<br />
Never let anybody entrust himself to my scalpel, but I am<br />
still a surgeon. dhenever my general practitioner looks at<br />
me, or even my expert specialist consultant who is going to<br />
make a speech tonight, I like to remind them that I am a<br />
surgeon and I am also a physician, and also, you don't think<br />
I am boasting this is a simple narractive of fact I am<br />
a gynaecologist and obstetrician, though -hether as a<br />
patient or a practitioner has never been made quite clear.<br />
I seem to remember that I am an architect, but not-responsible<br />
for everything you see. I am a builder, I am a scientist.<br />
This is a boasting record, but I mention it to you firstly<br />
to say I didn't earn any of them and, secondly, to make<br />
you understand after all these events that I am now so<br />
superbly qualified to become a general practitioner.<br />
Now Sir, I have been lucky enough in my life<br />
not to encounter professionally the medical profession too<br />
much. I used to have a bit of fun in a clean way at the<br />
bar in my time, cross-examining doctors, who are very easy<br />
to cross-examine, much easier than when you are their gatient,<br />
and I haven't been their patient all that much, but I ave<br />
d. ived long enough to have the most tremendous regard for<br />
what goes on in the medical world and I have lived long<br />
enough to have a particular regard for the work done by the<br />
general practitioner, because the general practitioner, as<br />
His Excellency said, he is the family doctor, he is the man<br />
you know, he is the man who knows you, knows the family,<br />
who can speak intimately and yet with authority and he is<br />
the man who, over a long period of time, has been the first<br />
diagnostician when he comes to handle something in the family<br />
or in the family circle. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
I find it hard to believe, Mr. Chancellor, when I<br />
look back on my time here and on your time here when we who<br />
were students of the law certainly understood that we were<br />
much more intelligent than the iue9, ical students, I find it<br />
hard to believe how many of these scamps who were medical<br />
students in my time have now become the most trusted family<br />
advisers. And they have, and that proves, of course that it<br />
is a jolly good thing to get it out of your system atsome<br />
time or another, because I venture to say that there are more<br />
millions of people in Australia who owe a debt to the family<br />
doctor than there are any corresponding number who o'., re a debt<br />
to any other particular group in the community<br />
I have been exercised, as I know you have in this<br />
College, exercised about what is going to happen in the future,<br />
because in my own lifetime, which goes back before the turn<br />
of the century, all sorts of astonishing things have happened<br />
in the medical world. I have no doubt that at the time when<br />
I was born, the true function of a physician was to keep his<br />
patient quiet and allow nature to take its course. I have<br />
no doubt that not long before I was born and before all the<br />
subleties of anaesthesia were being got to be understood,<br />
surgery was a chancy thing; in fact, it is only in the memory<br />
of some men still living that antiseptic surgery gave place<br />
to aseptic surgery.<br />
It is really an astonishing thing for somebody like<br />
me to realise that in his own lifetime the greatest discoveries<br />
affecting mankind have not been i ' n the field of destruction<br />
as some people think, but in the field of preserving life as<br />
more people ought to think. Because of all these things the<br />
work of the biochemb-sts, the work of the microbiologists, the<br />
extraordinary developments of drugs and techniques in the<br />
specialised fields, it must become increasingly difficult for<br />
a general practitione-r whose day begins at any hour of the<br />
early hours of the morning and whose day ends at about the<br />
same time, It must be difficult for him to feel that his<br />
tremendous job of dealing with people in the broad and dealing<br />
with people in the particular has to be performed against a<br />
background of knowledge with which he must feel, occasionally,<br />
he is losing touch,<br />
Now this is a problem I thinkc that I, as an outsider,<br />
understand. Do we want general practitioners merely for an<br />
instrument for passing patients on to great specialised experts?<br />
I hope not. Or do we want the trusted family doctors skilled<br />
in understanding, skilled in diagnosis, to preserve hs position<br />
byr keeping up, in the broad and in the particular, his knowledge<br />
of the new developments in medicine, so there is not an<br />
unbridgeable gulf between What he knows he understands and<br />
wrhat he knows is understood by the most refined specialties<br />
in the medical and surgical xworld? If I were a family<br />
practitioner this is what I would want to feel. Yes, of<br />
course, there are great specia'Lised experts who know more than<br />
I do in their particular field-they ought to, because I have<br />
to cover at the beginning at least, all fields. But I do<br />
iwant to Lelieve that every year I know more and more about the<br />
new discoveries, that 1 am every year becoming competent to<br />
understand these latest developments and to know what it is<br />
that my highly qualified specialist will be talking about, @ 0900 * 0/ 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
This is tremendously true. Jeare not having a<br />
great gulf betw,, een the specialist and the general practitioner,<br />
because if we do, the general practitioner will begin to feel<br />
more and more tbat he merely begins something and that the<br />
skill, the expertise, must belong to other people. If I<br />
were a specialist in some branch of medicine, I wrould want to<br />
know that general practitioners every year knew more and<br />
more about the kind of thing that I was concerned with, and<br />
I am sure that the general practitioners would want that<br />
too, That means, as I understand it, the reason that<br />
this College has been established I heard about this<br />
before it was established. Wy own family doctor used to<br />
address me very earnestly on this subject when he had me<br />
at what you understand to be a disadvantaget and even<br />
from the beginning I can see quite clearly that a College<br />
of General Practitioners, which is going to include within<br />
its scope educational work, refresher courses, lectures and<br />
practice in matters which are new, is going to do something<br />
even more tremendous for the whole body of medical knowledge<br />
and of practice, and so Sir, surgeon though I may be, I<br />
think this is one of the great moments of my life. I have<br />
been a general practitioner in other fields for a long time.<br />
It is a very great honour to become a general practitioner<br />
in the field of medicine. </p>
