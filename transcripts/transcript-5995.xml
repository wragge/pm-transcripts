FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 23 JANUARY 1983<br />
COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT REINTRODUCES SYETP IN THE STATES<br />
The Commonwealth Government has agreed in principle<br />
to reintroduce SYETP ( Special Youth Employment<br />
Training Program) into State Government authorities<br />
and instrumentalities for 1983.<br />
The Western Australian Government has already begun<br />
to implement an initiative which will take advantage<br />
of the Commonwealth Government decision made in<br />
December. Discussions at officer level are being<br />
held with other State Governments with a view to<br />
commencement of programs in their States as soon as<br />
possible. The Government believes it is most important in<br />
current circumstances to provide further opportunities<br />
for employment and in particular to increase the<br />
skills of young people. o000---</p>
