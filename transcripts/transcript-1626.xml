PRESS : RELEASE RA P. M. iNo. 75/ 1967.<br />
POSTAL DISPUTE<br />
Prime Minister's Reply to Mr. Monk<br />
Following Cabinet consideration of the two telegrims<br />
received from the President of the Mr. Monk, the Prime<br />
Minister, Mr. Holt today sent a telegram to Mr. Monk in these<br />
terms ( full text of telegram follows)<br />
The Government last evening considered your telegrams of<br />
last Friday and Monday.<br />
The Postmaster-General and Minister for Labour and National<br />
Service will be ready to meet with representatives of the A. C. T. U.<br />
and the postal unions concerned next week at a time to be arranged<br />
with you. As Mr, Bury and Senator Anderson stated on 4th July, the<br />
Government, believing that the public requires Saturday services,<br />
intends that appropriate services will oe provided.<br />
As to penalties, you will recall that Senator Anderson, as<br />
Acting Postmaster-General met with the three unions on 19th June<br />
and undertook to examine the claims they submitted. Yet within days<br />
threats of stonna: es were published. I; hen the Minister sought<br />
assurances that there would be no stoppage he received evasive replies<br />
except from the Postmasters' Association.<br />
Following Cabinet's consideration of developments, the<br />
Minister on 27th June, i. e. before the 1st July stoppage, ublicly<br />
indicatea Cabinet's view that the unions' claims coula not oe<br />
considered under threat of a stoppage and Cabinet's direction that<br />
if a stoppage did occur disciplinary action would be taken under the<br />
Public Service Act.<br />
Notwithstanding the continuing threat of a stoppage I<br />
myself telegraphed Mr. jenaud on 29th June that Mr. Bury and Senator<br />
Anderson would meet the three unions concerned provided the U. P. C. T.<br />
and the cancelled the proposed stopnage. The text of this<br />
telegram was conveyed on the same day to Messrs. Slater and B3ker.<br />
Despite all the Government's efforts to have this whole<br />
matter discussed in a sensible fashion, a stoppage did occur on<br />
1st July. The course taken could mean only one thing namely<br />
that the leaders of the A. P. and the I. P. C, T. were bent on a<br />
direct confrontation \. ith the Government. were however " lad to<br />
note that a lare numoer of their members did not support tne stoppage.<br />
Relevant to all this, I must remind you, is the agreement<br />
of 8th Aril, 1964, to which you and Me:; srs. aters and Slayer were<br />
signatories. The relevant passage reads<br />
" For their part, the A. C. T. U. and the A. P. U. : ill not<br />
suonort any stoopa5e of work on an industrial issue in<br />
future but will negotiate and failing agreement, will go<br />
to aroitration. In the event of the men stopning work<br />
the A. C. T. U. and the U. agree that the orescribed<br />
penalty nrovisions of the Act will je appropriately applied."<br />
It so happens that the fines will not have been deducted<br />
by the time the Miinisters meet you. You and your colleagues will thus<br />
have the opportunity to make to the Ministers any further representations<br />
you wish on the question of penalties.<br />
CA1JERLA. 19 JULY, 1967. </p>
