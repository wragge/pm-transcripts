AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY AT 8. OOP'<br />
SPEECH TO THE STATE COUNCIL OF THE ALP, ADELAIDE, 13 SEPTEMBER 1984<br />
MR PRESIDENT,, MR PREMIER, DELEGATES, FELLOW MEMBERS,<br />
I NOTICE.. DELEGATES; THAT ONE OF THE ITEMS ON<br />
THE AGENDA FOR TONIGHT'S COUNCIL. IS INFORMATION REGARDING<br />
THE CLOSE OF NOMINATION AND PRESELECTION DATES FOR THE<br />
THRITEEN SOUTH AUSTRALIAN SEATS FOR THE HOUSE OF<br />
REPRESENTATIVES; AND I NOTE THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY ENDORSED<br />
YOUR SENATE TEAM.<br />
NOW DELEGATES, I REGARD THAT AS ANOTHER SPLENDID<br />
EXAMPLE OF THE FORESIGHTEDNESS AND READINESS ON BEHALF<br />
OF OUR CAUSE WHICH HAS LONG MADE THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN<br />
BRANCH ONE OF LABOR'S STRONGEST IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
AND I KNOW, THAT WHENEVER THE NEXT FEDERAL<br />
ELECTION COMES, SOUTH -AUSTRALIA WILL MAKE ANOTHER GREAT<br />
CONTRIBUTION TO WHAT I AM CONVINCED WILL BE ANOTHER<br />
GREAT AND HISTORIC VICTORY FOR OUR LABOR PARTY AND OUR<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENT THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA. ,/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
AN'D THAT CONTRIBUTION WILL DERIVE ITS STRENGTH<br />
FROM THREE MAIN SOURCES:<br />
THE CALIBRE OF THE MEMBERS AND CANDIDATES;<br />
SECOND, THE SUPPORT AND LOYALTY AND HARD WORK<br />
OF THIS BRANCH AT EVERY LEVEL;<br />
AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, THE RECOGNITION BY<br />
THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA 0OF WHAT HAS BEEN<br />
ACHIEVED, AND WHAT CAN BE ACHIEV/ ED, BY A STRONG<br />
FEDERAL LABOR GOVERNMENT, A STRONG STATE LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENT, WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP FOR RECOVERY,<br />
RECONSTRLUCTION AND REFORM, NOT ONLY FOR<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIA, BUT FOR ALL AUSTRALIA.<br />
I SAID, DELEGATES, THAT THIS WILL BE AN HISTORIC<br />
\ VICTORY FOR OUR PARTY AND OUR GOVERNMENT.<br />
AN4D I DON'T USE THOSE WORDS AS A BIT OF RHETORIC,<br />
BECAUSE DELEGATES, THESE ELECTIONS, WHENEVER THEY<br />
ARE HELD, WILL CERTAINLY SET THE COURSE FOR AUSTRALIA FOR<br />
THE REST OF THIS DECADE; AND BECAUSE CF THE CRUCIAL NATURE<br />
OF THE NEXT THREE YEARS, AND THE CRITICAL NATURE OF THE<br />
DECISIONS OUR GOVER[ NMENTS AND OUR COMMUNITY WILL HAVE TO MAKE<br />
IN THOSE YEARS, THE OUTCOMIE WILL REALLY SET THE COURSE OF<br />
Au1STRALIA RIGHT INTO THE 21ST CEN4TURlY. s_,/ 3 </p>
<p>AND IT WILL BE OUR TASK, AS A PARTY AND<br />
GOVERNMENT DURING THE NEXT CAMPAIGN, TO REINFORCE THAT<br />
REALISATION THE REALISATION OF THEIR HISTORIC AND<br />
CRITICAL CHOICE IN THE MINDS AND CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF<br />
EVERY AUSTRALIAN, AND I WAN4T TO SAY, DELEGATES, THAT IN THAT TASK<br />
THE TASK OF RAISING TO THE FULLEST POSSIBLE AWARENESS AN: D<br />
COMPREHENSION, O1N THE PART OF THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
ABOUT WHAT IS REALLY AT STAKE IN THE: SE ELECTION4S<br />
I WANT TO TELL YOU DELEGATES, THAT VIE HAVE FOUND POWERFUL<br />
ALLIES ALLIES WHO ARE ALREADY ASSISTING OUR CAUSE AND<br />
OUR CAMPAIGN BY THEIR EVERY ACTION AND THEIR EVERY UTTERANCE.<br />
IMEAN OF COURSE DELEGATES, THE OFFICIAL<br />
OPPOSITION THE PEACOCK-HOWARD-SINCLAIR OPPOSITION:<br />
AND IT WILL PROVE TO BE ONE. OF THE GREAT PARADOXES<br />
OF AUSTRALIAN POLITICAL HISTORY THAT' THIS PATHETIC,,<br />
DIRECTION-LESS OPPOSITION~ THE WORST AND WEAKEST IN LIVING<br />
MEMORY WILL OPERATE BY ITS DEFAULTS AND FAILURES<br />
AS A POSITIVE GOOD FOR AUSTRALIAN AND THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLEr,<br />
I I L </p>
<p>FOR THERE IS NOTHING WHICH COULD BRING HOME<br />
SO CLEARLY AND POWERFULLY TO THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE<br />
JUST HOW MUCH IS AT STAKE AT THESE ELECTIONS,<br />
HOW CLEAR THE CHOICE IS, HOW VITAL THE ISSUES ARE,<br />
HOW APPALLING THE ALTERNATIVE IS, THAN THIS OPPOSITION.<br />
AND DAY BY DAY, BY ~ THEIR CONDUCT,, THEIR TACTICS<br />
AND THEIR POLICY STATEMENTS, THEY ARE MAKING IT<br />
CLEARER AND CLEARER.<br />
IF THERE IS ONE THING MORE HELPFUL TO US AND<br />
OUR GREAT CAUSE THAN THE TORPOR, AND SILENCE, AND ABSENCE<br />
OF POLICY WHICH CHARACTERISED THIS OPPOSITION IN THE<br />
FIRST FIFTEEN MONTHS,, IT IS THE SQUALOR AND CLAMOUR<br />
AND THEIR POLICY STATEM," ENTS OF THE PAST THREE.<br />
HAS THERE BEEN ANY SPECTACLE SO NAUSEATING AS<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN TORY PARTY IN ITS DESPERATE SEARCH FOP<br />
AN ELECTION ISSUE THE UNSPEAI. kABLE IN PURSUIT OF THE<br />
CONTEMPTIBLE. s </p>
<p>UNTIL A FEW WEEKS AGO WE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT<br />
THAT OUR CHIEF CAMPAIGN WEAPON WOULD) BE THE CONTRAST,,<br />
AT EVERY POINT,, BETWEEN OUR RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT<br />
AND THE FRASER-PEACOCK-HiOWARD-SINCLAIR LEGACY.<br />
BUT THEIR RECENT CONDUCT -NOT LEAST THEIR<br />
DECLARATIONS OF WHAT THEY CALL THEIR POLICY<br />
ADDS A NEW AND SHARPER DIMENSION TO THE STRUGGLE.<br />
NOW THEY ARE NOT JUST SADDLED WITH THE DEAD<br />
WEIGHT OF THEIR OWN PAST RECORD AND WE WILL NEVER<br />
LET THEM ESCAPE FROM IT, NEVER LET THE PEOPLE OF A~ USTRALIA<br />
FORGET IT. [ HEY HAVE SADDLED THEMSELVES WITH A WHOLE NEW<br />
RANGE OF POLICIES AND ATTITUDES WHICH WOULD NOT ONLY<br />
UNDO THE GREAT WORK OF THE PAST EIGHTEEN! MONTHS, BLIT<br />
WOULD FORCE AUSTRALIA BACK INTO-THE COURSE OF DIVISION<br />
AND DISRUPTION WHICH THE PEOPLE REJECTED SO DECISIVELY<br />
IN MARCH 1983, AND WILL ASSUREDLY REJECT AGAIN, EVEN<br />
MORE DECISIVELY,, AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY.<br />
o s/ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
BY THEIR OWN ACTIONS, THEY HAVE ENSURED THAT<br />
THE CONTEST, WHEN IT COMES, WILL NOT ONLY BE ABOUT<br />
THEIR APPALLING PAST AGAINST OUR PERFORMANCE AND<br />
ACHIEVEMENTS, AND OUR INTENTION OF BUILDING ON THOSE<br />
ACHIEVEMENTS FOR A BETTER, FAIRER ACSTRALIA, THEY<br />
HAVE ENSURED THE CLEAREST POSSIBLE CHOICE FOR THE<br />
PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA AND FOR THE FUTURE OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
THE FACT IS DELEGATES, THAT E\' ERY TIME THEY<br />
LURCH IN S[ ARCH OF A PHONEY ISSUE, EVERY TIME THEY<br />
PURPORT TO PRODUCE ANOTHER POLICY, THEY NOT ONLY EXPOSE<br />
THEIR UTTER INADEQUACY, BUT HIGHLIGHT THE MAGNITUDE<br />
OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEV'E IN OUR FIRST TERM<br />
SO FAR, AND THE EVEN GREATER MAGNITUDE OF WHAT WE SHALL<br />
BE ABLE TO ACHIEV'E AND THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA WILL BE<br />
ABLE TO ACHIEVE IN OUR NEXT TERM.<br />
THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA NOW DON'T ONLY<br />
HAVE TO JUDGE AS THEY ASSUREDLY WILL BETWEEN OUR<br />
RECORD AND THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT'S RECORD,<br />
THEY NON KNOW THE ALTFERNATIVE THAT IS OFFERED<br />
FOR THE FUTURE. S17 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
i HE PEOPLE N~ ON ' T JUST JUDGING ALTHOUGH<br />
THEY WILL MAKE THAT JUDGMENT:<br />
BETWEEN A GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS CREATED<br />
A QUARTER OF A MILLION NEW JOBS IN LESS THAN<br />
TWO YEARS., AGAINST PARTIES WHOSE POLICIES IN<br />
GOVERNMENT PRODUCED THE LOSS OF A. QUARTER OF<br />
A MILLION JOBS IN LESS THAN ONE YEAR;<br />
BETWEEN A GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS RESTORED<br />
AUSTFRALIAN ECONOMIC GROWTH TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL<br />
FOR FIFTY YEARS THE STRONGEST GROWTH OF ANY<br />
OF THE OECD COUNTRIES AGAINST PARTIES WHO1<br />
ACHIEVED THE SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR A COUNTRY<br />
LIKE AUSTRALIA -ZERO ECONOMIC GROWTH,<br />
THEY WON'T JUST BE MAKING A JUDGMENT ABOUT<br />
A GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS HALVED rHE INFLATION RATE;<br />
WHICH HAS ACHIEVED A SIGNIFICANT FALL IN<br />
INTEREST RATES;<br />
WHICH HAS REVIV'ED THE HOUSING INDUSTRY,<br />
ESPECIALLY IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA., AS WE HAVE BEEN<br />
ABLE TO DO I14 CO-OPERATION WITH THE BANNON<br />
GovE RNME NT. / 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
THEY WON'T ONLY BE MAKING A JUDGMENT ABOUT<br />
A GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES HAVE BEEN<br />
REDUCED TO THEIR LOWEST LEVEL FOR S:: XTEEN YEARS.<br />
THEIR JUDGMENT WON'T BE BASED ONLY ON THE<br />
COMPARISON AND CONTRAST BETWEEN PRESENT AND PAST.<br />
BECAUSE, DELEGATES, THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA<br />
NOW KNOW THE OPPOSITION HAS TOLD US THAT IF THEY<br />
HAD THE REMOTEST OPPORTUNITY, THEY WOULD DISMANTLE<br />
ALL THE MACHINERY, REVERSE ALL THE POLICIES AND DESTROY<br />
THE WHOLE BASIS NOT ONLY THE NEW STRUCTURES<br />
BUT THE CHANGED ATTITUDES WHICH HAVE PRODUCED<br />
THIS REMARKABLE RECOVERY AND THIS TRANSFORMATION IN<br />
THE PROSPECTS FOR AUSTRALIA. / 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA KNOW IT, THE BUSINESS<br />
COMMUNITY KNOWS IT, THE UNIONS KNOW IT.<br />
THIS OPPOSITION NOW WqANTS TO ABOLISH ALL<br />
THE CONSULTATIVE AND PLANNING MECHANISMS WHICH HAVE<br />
BROUGHT INDUSTRY AND UNIONS AND GOVERNMENTS TOGETHER<br />
IN THE GREAT DRIVE FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND ECONOMIC<br />
GROWTH. THEY WANT TO ABOLISH THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
MANUFACTURING COUNCIL.<br />
THEY WANT TO ABOLISH ALL THE INDUSTRY ADVISORY<br />
COUNCILS. THEY WANT TO ABOLISH THE ECONOMIC PLANNING<br />
ADVISORY COUNCIL.<br />
THEY WANT TO SELL OFF THE COMMONWEALTH BANKING<br />
CORPORATION IGNORING THE INTERESTS OF ITS MORE THAN<br />
TEN AND A HALF MILLION ACCOUNT HOLDERS,<br />
THEY ,' ANT TO SELL OFF THE AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY<br />
DEVELOPIiENT CORPORATION.<br />
THEY WAiT TO GET Ri2 OF THE-PRICES SURVEILLICE<br />
AUTHORITY. </p>
<p>AND OF COURSE, THEY WOULD PROPOSE To EXTEND<br />
THIS EXERCISE IN MASS VANDALISM TO THE WHOLE RANGE OF<br />
SOCIAL REFORMS, LIKE MEDICARE, WHICH, APART FROM<br />
THEIR INTRINSIC VALUE AS MEASURES OF JUSTICE AND EQUITY.,<br />
ARE INTEGRAL TO THE ACHIEV'EMENT OF OUR GOVERNMENT'S<br />
BROADER ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL OBJECTIVES.<br />
AT THE VERY HEART OF THE RECOVERY, AND AT THE<br />
VERY HEART OF OUR HOPES FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A SUSTAINED<br />
RECOVERY WITHOUT A NEW BURST OF INFLATION, LIES THE<br />
PRICES AND INCOMES ACCORD.<br />
YET EVERYTHING THAT UNDERPINS THE ACCORD<br />
THE MECHANISMS WVHICH I HAVE JUST MENTIONED AND ABOVE ALL., P<br />
CENTRALISED WAGE FIXING ARE SLATED) FOR DESTRLICTION<br />
AT THE HANDS OF THESE ECONOMIC SABOTEURS THESE<br />
DISCREDITED MEN WHO, HOWEVER MUCH THEY MAY WISH THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE TO0 FORGET THE PAST, WOULD DOOM THEM<br />
TO REPEAT THE PAST, AND ENDURE A REPETITION OF THE<br />
PAST, WITH ALL ITS WASTE, INU'USTICE, UNEQUAL HARDSHIP,<br />
AND DIVISIVENESS, 9:,/ 111 </p>
<p>-11-<br />
AND I HAVE 110 DOUBT, DELEGATES, THAT THE<br />
HIGHLY FAVOURABLE RESPONSE TO THE BUDGET GOES BEYOND<br />
THE FACT THAT IT IS SIMPLY THE BEST AND FAIREST BUDGET<br />
PRODUCED, CERTAINLY IN MORE THAN A DECADE.<br />
THE RESPONSE GOES BEYOND TH1E FACT THAT THE<br />
BUDGET ENCAPSULATES AND CON õ OLIDATES THE ACHIEVEMENTS<br />
OF THE PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS.<br />
I AM CONVINCED THAT PART OF: THAT RESPONSE LIES<br />
IN THE GROWING REALISATION AROUND AUSTRALIA NOT LEAST<br />
IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY OF THE APPALLING AND<br />
DESTRUCTIVE ALTERNATIVE IMPLICIT IN THE POLICIES<br />
7<br />
SO FAR ANNOUNCED BY THE OPPOSITION,<br />
DELEGATES, WHEN YOU SEE OUR SUPPOSED OPPOSITION<br />
TROTTING OUT THESE DISASTROUS POLICI ES ONE BY ONE,<br />
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN, AS I'VE HAD OCCASION TO SAY IN<br />
PARLIAMENT IN RECENT DAYS, YOU CAN HARDLY BELIEVE<br />
YOUR LUCK, BUT THERE ARE OTHER TIMES IWHEN YOU CAN HARDLY<br />
BELIEVE YOUR EARS: / 12<br />
1.2 </p>
<p>-12-<br />
WHEN AN IAN SINCLAIR TALKS ABOUT ETHICS<br />
AND PROPRIETY;<br />
OR WHEN A HOWARD THE HOWARD WHO DUMPED<br />
ON US A DEFICIT OF $ 9.6 BILLION WHICH WAS<br />
DELIBERATELY CONCEALED FROM THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE 1983 CAMPAIGN<br />
LECTURES US ABOUT THE DEFICIT;<br />
OR WHEN A PEACOCK OR ANY MEMBER OF THE<br />
PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT HAS THE GALL TO TALK<br />
ABOUT TAX REFORM AND TAX AVOIDANCE,<br />
DELEGATES, LET THERE BE NO DOUBT IN ANYC'NE'S<br />
MIND THAT TAXATION WILL BE AN ISSUE IN THE COMING<br />
ELECTION. WE ARE DETERMINED THAT IT SHALL BE SO.<br />
AND HERE AGAIN IT WON'T BE JUST A MATTER OF<br />
COMPARING OUR RECORD WITH THEIR RECORD IN GOVERNMENT.<br />
WE'LL BE EXPOSING THEIR R-CORD IN OPPOSITION.<br />
13 </p>
<p>-13-<br />
BECAUSE THEIR PROTECTION OF THE TAX AVOIDANCE<br />
INDUSTRY IN OPPOSITION, THROUGH THEIR NUMBERS IN THE SENATE,<br />
HAS BEEN EVERY BIT AS BAD AS THEIR RECORD IN GOVERNMIENT,<br />
IN RECENT DAYS, WE HAVE HAD IN CANBERRA THE<br />
UNBELIEVABLE SPECTACLE OF THIS OPPOSITION WAVING AROUND<br />
DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE WORK OF ROYAL COMMISSIONER<br />
COSTIGAN AND SPECIAL PROSECUTOR REDLICH.<br />
AND THE SUGGESTION, BREATHTAKING IN ITS ABSURDITY,<br />
IN ITS INVERSION OF THE TRUTH AND PERVERSION OF REALITY<br />
WAS THAT WE WERE INDIFFERENT, OR WORSE, IO COMPLETING<br />
OR FOLLOWING THROUGH THE WORK OF THOSE INVESTIGATIONS.<br />
NOW WHAT IS THE REALITY?<br />
THE WHOLE THRUST OF THE COSTIGAN REPORTS IS<br />
SUMMED UP IN A SINGLE DEVASTATING PARAGRAPH CONTAINED<br />
IN MiR COSTIGAN'S INTERIM REPORT No. 3, DATED<br />
18 DECEMBER 1981,<br />
AND COMMISSIONER COSTIGAN SAID THIS:<br />
" THE COMMISSION'S INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE FEDERATED<br />
SHIP PAIN'TERS AND DOCKERS' UNION HAS LED IT, TO THE<br />
SURPRISE OF MAr,! Y TO THE TAX AVOIDANCE INDUSTRYo" / iL </p>
<p>-it'-<br />
NOW DELEGATES, LET ME EMPHASISE THE NEXT<br />
SENTENCE AND REMIND YOU AGAIN OF THE DATE DECEMBER 1981:<br />
" THIS INDUSTRY HAS DEVELOPED IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
PARTICULARLY OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS, AT A<br />
RATE FAR IN EXCESS OF ANY OTHER INDUSTRY AND HAS<br />
BROUGHT WITH IT PROFITS COMPARABLE ONLY TO THE<br />
HEADY DAYS OF THE VICTORIAN COLD RUSH."'<br />
LET ME EMPHASISE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE RYMARKS,<br />
BECAUSE THIS REVELATION IS THE WHOLE FOUNDATION OF THE<br />
SUBSEQUENT WORK BY M'R COSTIGAN AND HIS STAFF AND LET ME<br />
REMIND YOU DELEGATES, OUR GOV'ERNMENT MASSIVELY INCREASED<br />
THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THE COMMISSION,<br />
As COMMISSIONER COSTIGAN SAYS, THE TAX AVOIDANCE<br />
INDUSTRY BECAME THE GREATEST GROWTH INDUSTRY IN AUSTRALIA<br />
IN THE YEARS 1976 TO 1981 THAT IS, EXCLUSIVELY IN THE<br />
YEARS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF WHICH PEACOCK-HOWARD-SINCLAIR<br />
WERE SENIOR MEMBERS.<br />
IT WOULD BE WELL FOR THE REPUTATION AND<br />
CREDIBILITY OF THIS OPPOSITION, IF THEIR PROTECTION OF THE<br />
TAX AVOIDANCE IN~ DUSTRY HAD ENDED WHEN THEIR owi' GOVERNMENT<br />
ENDED IN MARCH 1983. </p>
<p>BUT WORSE WAS TO COME.<br />
BECAUSE DELECATES, WHATEVER THEY MIGHT<br />
ATTEMPT TO SAY ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PERIOD<br />
FROM 1976 TO 1981, THIS OPPOSITION CAN NEVER ESCAPE<br />
ONE PARTICLE OF ITS ABSOLUTE RESPONSIBILITY FOR<br />
USING ITS NUMBERS IN THE SE1\ ATE, IN COLLABORATION WITH<br />
SOME OF THE DEMOCRATS, TO THWART AND FRUSTRATE<br />
KEY ELEMENTS OF OUR ANTI-TAX AVOIDANCE LEGISLATION,<br />
IN IARCH 1983 WE UNDERTOOK, IN THESE WORDS,<br />
TO " WIPE OUT THE TAX EVASION AND AVOIDANCE INDUSTRY<br />
IN THIS COUNTRY". AND WE HAVE HONOURED THAT PLEDGE TO THE LIMIT<br />
OF OUR POWERS ONLY THIS WEEK, PAUL KEATING ANNOUNCED THE<br />
RESULTS OF THE FIRST REAL REVIEW AND REFORM OF PENALTIES<br />
AND PROCEDURES TO PREVENT TAX EVASION AND AVOIDANCE<br />
SINCE BEFORE WORLD WAR II,<br />
BUT IN THE SENATE, A COMBINATION OF LIBERALS,<br />
NATIONALS AND SOME OF THE DEMOCRATS, HAVE FOUR TIMES<br />
REJECTED OUR CRUCIAL LEGISLATION AGAINST TAX AVOIDANCE,<br />
.,/ 16 </p>
<p>-16-<br />
THE RESULT IS THAT ' THE AUSTRALIAN TAXPAYERSTHE<br />
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF ORDINARY, DECENT,<br />
LAW-ABIDING AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS HAVE BEEN CHEATED<br />
OF $ 500 MILLION. LET THEM NEVER FORGET THAT.<br />
AND LET THE TAXPAYERS AND THE PENSIONERS OF<br />
AUSTRALIA NEVER FORGET IT; AND NEVER FORGET THAT<br />
THIS COMBINATION OF LIBERALS, NATIONALS AND SOME OF<br />
THE DEMOCRATS, HAVE ALLOWED A HANDFUL OF MALEFACTORS<br />
OF GREAT WEALTH TO MILK THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY<br />
OF AT LEAST $ 500 MiLLION.<br />
IN THE BUDGET, WE WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE TAX<br />
CUTS OF $ 7.60 A W,, EEK FOR THE AVERAGE TAXPAYER,<br />
BUT THAT LOST $ 500 MILLION WOULD HAVE<br />
ALLOWED A TAX CUT ! N ONE YEAR OF A FURTHER $ 412.<br />
17 </p>
<p>-17-<br />
AND DELEGATES/ I DON'T THINK YOU CAN HAVE<br />
A CLEARER ILLUSTRATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ELECTION<br />
FOR HALF THE SENATE WHICH HAS, BY THE CONSTITUTION,<br />
TO TAKE PLACE SOON AND WHICH, FOR ALL THE MOST LOGICAL<br />
AND PERSUASIVE REASONS IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST, WILL BE<br />
HELD CONJOINTLY WITH AN ELECTION FOR THE HOUSE OF<br />
REPRESENTATIVES. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE MAXIMISE OUR VOTE IN<br />
THE SENATE ELECTIONS; AND ENSURE THAT THE VOTE FOR THE<br />
SENATE REFLECTS AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE, AS NEARLY AS<br />
POSSIBLE UNDER OUR SYSTEM, THE VOTE AND THIE WILL OF THE<br />
PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA, AS REFLECTED IN THE ELECTIONS FOR THE<br />
PEOPLE'S HOUSE, THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,<br />
AND THAT IS A SPECIAL TASK THE TASK OF<br />
MAXIMISING THE SENATE VOTE WHICH WILL DEVOLVE UPON THE<br />
ORGANISATION, THE BRANCHES, THE RANK AND FILE OF OUR<br />
PARTY. BECAUSE WE KNOW, WE OF THE LABOR PARTY KNOW,<br />
FROM LONG EXPERIENCE., JUST HOW MUCH IS AT STAKE IN THE<br />
BEST POSSIBLE SENATE RESULT. / 18 </p>
<p>-18-<br />
DELEGATES, DO NOT THINK FOR A MOMENT THAT THERE<br />
IS ANYTHING COINCIDENTAL OR ACCIDENTAL ABOUT THE NEW<br />
TACTICS BEING ADOPTED BY THIS DESPERATE AND DISCREDITED<br />
OPPOSITION. INDEED, THERE IS NOTHING NEW AT ALL ABOUT<br />
THESE TACTICS. WE HAVE SEEN IT ALL BEFORE, WHENEVER OUR<br />
GREAT CAUSE HAS VNONDBY FAIR, OPEN AN4D DEMOCRATIC MEANS,<br />
THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA AGAINST THE<br />
FORCES OF REACTION AND CONSERVATISM.<br />
BUT DELEGATES, IN 19814 A QUITE NEW DESPERATION<br />
NOW MOTIVATES THIS OPPOSITION,<br />
FOR THE PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS WE HAVE BEEN<br />
ABLE TO UNITE THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA AROUND CERTAIN4 GREAT<br />
GOALS AND COMMON OBJECTIVES IN A WAY THAT HAS. NEVER -REFORE<br />
BEEN ACHIEV'ED BEFORE IN PEACETIME,<br />
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BRIN4G KEY SECTIONS OF THE<br />
COMMUNITY TOGETHER, TO WORK TOGETHER, TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOA"'^ LS:<br />
./ 19 </p>
<p>-19-<br />
PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE MEASURE<br />
OF SUCCESS IN ACHIEVING TOGETHER THESE SPECIFIC<br />
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL GOALS, HAS BEEN THE CREATION OF<br />
A NEW-FOUND SPIRIT OF CC-OPERATION, CONFIDENCE AND<br />
SELF-CONFIDENCE IN THE NATION A NATION NEWLY-CONFIDENT<br />
IN ITSELF, CONFIDENT IN ITS DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS,<br />
CONFIDENT IN ITS LEADERSHIP, NEWLY-CONFIDENT IN ITS<br />
FUTURE, 1T IS ON THE BASIS OF THIS CO-OPERATION AND<br />
MUTUAL CONFIDENCE, THAT LABOR LABOR IN THE NATION AND<br />
LABOR IN THE STATES IS BUILDING A BETTER, FAIRER<br />
FUTURE FOR AUSTRALIA,<br />
AND OUR POLITICAL ADVERSARIES WELL KNOW THAT IF<br />
THEY ARE TO MAKE ANY HEADWAY AT ALL, EITHER IN THE SHORT<br />
TERM OR THE LONGER TERM, THEY MUST UNDERMINE THIS NEW<br />
SPIRIT OF CO-OPERATION, CONCILIATION AND CONFIDENCE,<br />
WHICH WE ARE CREATING IN THIS NATION,<br />
THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT AND PURPOSE OF THE<br />
POLICIES WHICH THEY ARE NOW PUTTINS FOkWARD POLICIES<br />
WHICH, AS 1 HAVE SAID,. COULD ON~ LY VESULT IN THE<br />
DESTRUCTION OF THE WHOLE FABiRIC OF NATIONAL RECOVERY,<br />
NATI ONAL RECONCI1LI AT ION AND NATI ONAL R~ ECONSTRU1CTI ON,<br />
120 </p>
<p>AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT AND PURPOSE OF<br />
THE TACTICS OF DENIGRATION WHICH THEY HAV'E NOW ADOPTED)<br />
IN THESE LATTER DAYS OF THEIR DESPERATION,<br />
NOT, AS I SAY, TACTICS WHICH THEY HAVE ADOPTED<br />
FOR THE FIRST TIME. BUT WE MUST MAKE SURE IT IS<br />
FOR THE LAST TIME.<br />
DELEGATES BY OUR UNREMITTING EFFORTS BETWEEN<br />
NOW AND ELECTION DAY, BY EXPOSING THEM FOR WHAT * rHEY ARE,<br />
IN THE EYES, THE MINDS, THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PEOPLE<br />
OF AUSTRALIA WE MUST ENSURE THAT THESE TACTICS AND<br />
THEIR PERPETRATORS NEVER AGAIN HAVE A PLACE IN THE<br />
GREAT AFFAIRS OF THIS NATION.<br />
IN THAT TASK, I KNOW WITH ABSOLUTE CONVICTION,<br />
THAT I CAN RELY ON THE SUPPORT, LOYALTY AND DEDICATION<br />
OF THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN GOV'ERNMENT, THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN<br />
BRANCH, THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN UNIONS, THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN<br />
RANK AND FILE, WITHOUT STIN4T BECAUSE YOU KNOW,<br />
YOU ALL KNOW, AS I KNOW, THAT UPON OUR SUCCESS IN THIS TASK,<br />
DEPENDS ALL THE BEST HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS OF OUR GREAT<br />
CAUSE,, AND IN A W1AY THAT HAS NEVER BEEN SO TRUE IN THE<br />
HISTORY OF AUSTRALIA, THE CAUSE AND ' THE HOPES OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN NATIO14 AND PEOPLE. </p>
