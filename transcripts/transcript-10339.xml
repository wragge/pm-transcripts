TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THlE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
RADIO INTERVIEW WITH PAUL BE VAN ON<br />
ABC RADIO 2NC, NEWCASTLE<br />
E O E<br />
( tape starts)<br />
PRESENTER: . some programmes. Could you elaborate on that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes well what I also said in the Parliament was that we would match what the New South Wales<br />
Government contributed.<br />
( Tape break)<br />
I don't think the proposal that Mr Carr has put up is the most efficient way ( inaudible) of the New<br />
South Wales Government's money and $ 10 million of federal money and at least $ 5 million of BHP<br />
money. There is a better way in our opinion of doing it and because thle full impact of the<br />
retrenchments won't be felt for a little while yet, although some impact will be felt fairly soon, we<br />
Ought to spend a few weeks working out the most intelligent way of dispersing the money but I want<br />
to make it very clear to your listeners and to all of the people of the Newcastle area that we are very<br />
concerned about the social and community impact of the BHP decision. I have to be honest and say<br />
that I can't reverse it any more than Mr Carr can reverse it or any more than Mr Keating would have<br />
been able to reverse it if he was still Prime Minister or Mr Beazley. We shouldn't pretend that<br />
something like this can be reversed but we can help as governments to ease the impact, to help people<br />
into other activities and to make programmes and resources available in that process.<br />
Now that is what I am willing to do and I will say it again, we will commit the same resources as the<br />
New South Wales Government. I want the people of Newcastle and the people of the Hunter region<br />
to understand that. We just want to do it in a different way. I don't want to have a political fight with<br />
Mr Carr. He's a Labor Premier, I'm a Liberal Prime Minister but the livelihood of Australians is at<br />
stake here and we should really keep politics out of it.<br />
PRESENTER: Even though you are from different sides of the fence, will you be working with...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I will work with Mr Carr. I saw him last week and I genuinely don't believe that the proposals he's put<br />
forward are the best way of spending the money and...<br />
PRESENTER:<br />

<p>13 May J997 litp:// www~. ila. gov. au/ piic/ pressrel/ 2tic. litiiil<br />
What would you...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
One of the things that I am going to do is to get our, I've got a Major Projects Facilitator on my staff<br />
and i'm going to get him to see what major projects might be brought forward to have some beneficial<br />
effects in the area. There are some activities within the Department of Employment that could perhaps<br />
receive additional resources. Now what you really have to do is to talk to the business people in the<br />
region. You've got to talk to the unions, you've got to talk to the civic leaders and work out with the<br />
limited resources available what is the most intelligent way to spend the money. Now I am quite happy<br />
to do that in co-operation with Mr Carr. I am happy to nominate a Commonwealth representative on a<br />
joint Commonwealth-State committee. I am quite happy to talk to and work with the unions. I can't<br />
deliver miracles. I won't promise that but I just say again we are not the least bit reluctant about<br />
making resources available. We will match dollar for dollar what the New South Wales Government is<br />
committing. We just want to do it a little differently and I just ask Mr Carr not to politicise this. And<br />
here we are on opposite sides of the political fence but we should work together on this particular<br />
issue. PRESENTER:<br />
When you are looking at programmes that you can put funding into to help with this sort of situation,<br />
aren't you bound to a certain extent by the dismantling that's already gone on under the Coalition<br />
Government? For instance, Skilshare has been reduced by<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
But there are other programmes.<br />
PRESENTER: Working Nation has been virtually, totally dismantled.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Please, with respect, don't try and distort what I have said. I have said that our resources will be there.<br />
I mean, you can't sort of get around that. We're going to make some resources available. There are<br />
some progranmmes that exist and one in particular relates to regional unemployment, areas of particular<br />
regional unemployment difficulty. It would be possible for example to supplement that particular<br />
programme. There has been a very successful placement programme I understand operating in the area<br />
in relation to the tourist industry. It would be possible perhaps to continue that. There are a number of<br />
options. PRESENTER: An interesting point there is that these people... a couple of things... First off, the last round of<br />
retrenchments at BHiP would have seen the shedding of their more skilled workers, no insult to the<br />
people who are still there.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I understand.<br />

PRESENTER: You are going to have people who have been at the BHP for a longer period of time, less skills.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I understand.<br />
PRESENTER: They're not going to be getting jobs in tourism.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I'm not pretending.. look, the last thing anybody in my position or Mr Carr's position or Mr<br />
Beazley's position should do is to sort of promise that the waving of the magic wand can achieve<br />
miracles. It can't but what I'm saying to you and I'm saying to your listeners is that we are prepared<br />
within limits to assist. I amn happy to work with the New South Wales Government, I am happy to<br />
work with business men and women in the Hunter and with the unions to identify the most intelligent<br />
way of using the limited resources that will be made available. There's no point in people yelling at<br />
each other, there's no point in people trying to score political points. I am not blaming the unions, I am<br />
not blaming the previous Government. I am not, I mean, the fact is that we have a difficult problem<br />
that we have to come to terms with.<br />
PRESENTER: You specifically did blame the previous government in Parliament today though and there was an<br />
awful lot of political point scoring going on...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
If I am told by the Ministers in the former Government that this particular closure is my fault, when<br />
you bear in mind that in the 13 years that thle former Government was in office, BHP's workforce<br />
declined from 54000 to 23000, I repeat that, 54000 to 23000, you might expect me in the heat of a<br />
Parliamentary exchange to defend myself<br />
PRES ENT ER:<br />
At that time the previous ALP Government injected $ 45 million in 1983 into the economy to try to<br />
compensate. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I am just telling you that is the fact. Look, you bring up..<br />
PRESENTER: You're saying $ 10 million.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, you bring up this question of blame. I don't want to get into political blame but if I am attacked<br />
obviously I will defend myself and I will point out that under the previous Government BI-P's 3 f 606/ 30/ 1977: 37: 14<br />

workforce around Australia declined from 54000 to 23000.<br />
PRESENTER: But they did work to try to compensate that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You say they worked, it obviously wasn't very effective. Now look, don't drag me into sort of a<br />
political exchange oil this but if you force me to I will defend myself by quoting figures that are<br />
uncomfortable for the former Labor Government. From the moment that BHP made its<br />
announcement, Mr Beazley and Mr Crean have tried to sort of blame all of it on us. Now look, that is<br />
ridiculous. We've been in office for 13 months. They were in office for 13 years and I don't think<br />
people who were listening to this programme are really very interested in an exchange between you<br />
and me about...<br />
PRESENTER: You're quite right.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You've started asking me, and I don't really want to go down that track but if..<br />
PRESENTER: Neither do 1.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
If you take me down that track I'm going to defend myself because I'm not going to have the<br />
reputation of my Government unfairly reduced but what Bob Carr and I have got to do is work<br />
together. He's put forward $ 10 million. I have said we will match that. I think BHP should contribute<br />
some more and I will talk to the company about that. I don't think what the Premier has put up is the<br />
most intelligent way of spending the $ 25 or more million. I would like to talk to him about other ways<br />
of doing it and I am quite happy in that process to talk to the business leaders and to talk to the<br />
unions... PRESEN TElR:<br />
This proposal that has been put to you is for a foreign trade zone at the Steel River site which BH-P<br />
has made available, about a hundred hectares is zoned as standard land. The foreign trade zone will<br />
allow various tax breaks to try to entice industry into this area. Will you be giving support to that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we've had a look at that and there are two problems with it. The first problem is that under the<br />
Constitution we're told, you can't discriminate in your tax measures between states or different parts of<br />
states and it's highly dubious as to whether it would be constitutional because other state governments<br />
would challenge us giving a tax advantage to a part of New South Wales.<br />

Although I understand a similar scheme exists in the Northern Territory at the moment.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Thle Northern Territory has a different status because it's not a state. Now I haven't completely ruled<br />
that out but that is the initial problem because you will get other depressed areas of Australia, you will<br />
get, 1 mean there are areas of Tasmania for example that have a higher level of unemployment than<br />
Newcastle and the Hunter Valley and they will come to me and say, can we have the same thing and<br />
you will get other states that may not have those depressed areas saying, well we're not going to agree<br />
and we're going to take it to the High Court. Now I am not ruling that out completely.<br />
PRES ENTER:<br />
I think they would have difficulty in justifying their position is as bad as ours though.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I am talking about the law. I am not talking about the comparative economic position. I am just saying<br />
to you that if thle Constitution says you can't tax one part of the country more heavily or more lightly<br />
than another part of the country and then you go ahead and do it, the part of the country that doesn't<br />
get the advantage will take you to the court. That's, I'm just stating a fact of life between governments<br />
so I haven't completely ruled that Out, Paul but I am just saying that that is one of the threshold<br />
difficulties. It is one of the things that we are prepared to look at but you asked me the question. That<br />
is one of its sort of preliminary difficulties. Look, what I ask in this is that we have got, we haven't got<br />
a lot of time but we've got some time to approach the thing in a calmer way and not try to apportion<br />
political blame because that's not going to achieve anything. That's not going to save one job, it's not<br />
going to reverse one corporate decision and if we're going to have a non aggression pact on political<br />
blame I will be a willing signatory but if somebody has a go at me and tries to land all the blame for a<br />
13 month old Government, particularly from a 13 year old Government, I will naturally try and defend<br />
mny Government.<br />
PRESENTER: Look to the future security and avoid the political cost of.. another thing, another vital role that the<br />
Federal Government can play here is working with the BHP to ensure that it satisfies its commitments<br />
to this area. Some of those will be what it can provide by way of mopping up afterwards in the<br />
employment situation. Will you be working closely with BHP on those, on that obligation?<br />
PRIME M[ NISTER:<br />
Yes. PRESENTER: And cleaning up the site as well is another good question.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes well, I mean, there are, I can't give a tick to everything that people might want in that area but in<br />
principle yes.<br />

Prime Minister, thank you very much for your time. I know it's a very busy night for you.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And I certainly intend in the next little while to visit Newcastle and to talk first hand.<br />
PRESENTER: Will you come in and join us here in 2NC studios?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I will certainly try.<br />
PRESENTER: The invitation is there, Prime Minister.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Thank you. I will certainly try and do that.<br />
PRESENTER: Thank you very much for your time. John Howard, Prime Minister of Australia.<br />
