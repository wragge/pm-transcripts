SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.<br />
AT THE ALBURY TRADE FAIR SATURDAY 21 JULY, 1973<br />
I am glad of the opportunity to visit the Albury Trade<br />
Fair ( this year entitled " New Cities Expo ' 73" 1) and speak to you<br />
tonight. The scope and quality of the Fair and certainly its<br />
title are an encouraging symbol of what we hope to achieve in<br />
this, our first growth centre4<br />
I first spoke at Albury more than three years ago. At<br />
the opening of the 38th Annual Conference of Rotary International<br />
I suggested that Albury/ Wodonga would be a perfect place for a new<br />
city. When we were elected we wasted no time in setting about to<br />
fulfil that promise. It is just six months since I met with the<br />
Premier of Victoria, Mr. Hamer, and the Premier of New South Wales,<br />
Sir Robert Asking here, and we agreed on the proposal to create<br />
a new Australian city.<br />
There is, of course, no such thing as an " instant" city.<br />
In sensitive planning areas pat solutions must be suspect. However,<br />
although some of you may feel that there has been little tangible<br />
evidence of the new project, if you examine what has been done over<br />
this time, you will realise that w~ e have built a very sound base on<br />
which the area will grow.<br />
My colleague, the Australian Minister for Urban and<br />
Regional Development, Tom Uren, outlined our achievements to you on<br />
Thursday night. One of the most satisfying of these is the way in<br />
which the three governments have worked in such harmony on the<br />
project. He also explained the organisation which will be set up<br />
to undertake the planning and development of the growth complex..<br />
hope that this wil~ l have answered any questions or doubts you will<br />
have had on this subject.<br />
The Ministerial Council made up of Mr. Uren, the New<br />
South Wales Minister for Decentralisation and Development, Mr.<br />
Fuller, and the Victorian Minister for State Development and<br />
Decentralisation and Development, Mr. Byrne, has agreed that the.<br />
development organisation will be established before the end of this<br />
year. I support this timetable and the Australian Government will<br />
do everything within its power to see that enabling legislation<br />
is passed in the forthcoming session of the Australian Parliament.<br />
The Australian Government believes that the last election<br />
was won largely because of the apalling lack of foresight which has<br />
led to the congestion and strangling snarl of unplanned growth in<br />
our cities, By the creation of Albury/ Wodonga; by the development<br />
of other new cities and growth area, by concentrating on alleviating<br />
the problems of people in the worst hit western areas of Sydney<br />
and Melbourne; by the creation of land commissions and by making<br />
federal money more immediately available to local, government, we<br />
believe we will be able to bring order back into the lives of urban<br />
dwelling Australians. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The Australian Government cannot do the job on its own,<br />
particularly in view of constitutional limitations on its power.<br />
To carry out projects such as Albury/ Wodonga the Australian<br />
Government has to work in close co-operation with the States and<br />
local instrumentalities. The new Department of Urban and Regional Development will<br />
have the responsibility for developing and implementing a national<br />
urban and regional development strategy as a major policy area of<br />
the Australian Government. It will also have the responsibility for<br />
negotiating with, advising and helping state and local governments<br />
in the preparation and implementation of urban and regional plans.<br />
With the chief co-ordination and policy-making role in<br />
the area of urban and regional development lying with the Department,<br />
it will be the Cities Commission which will be chiefly responsible<br />
for the physical development of Albury/ Wodonga. The Commission is<br />
also under the control of the Minister for Urban and Regional<br />
Development and is linked to the Department.<br />
One of the main ways in which the Australian Government<br />
will be helping the States in the development of Albury/ Wodonga<br />
is with money. It will finance land acquisition and land<br />
development by interest-bearing advances although in the long<br />
term I believe that this growth complex will be self-supporting.,<br />
At present we cannot expect New South Wales and Victoria<br />
to switch resources quickly to Albury/ Wodonga in fields like<br />
education and health while there are backlogs elsewhere in the<br />
States. Certain existing municipal services will need to be<br />
supplemented and in this respect special federal grants or longterm<br />
loans will be made available in the early years. Nevertheless<br />
in keeping with the tripartite nature of the enterprise, the<br />
Victorian and New South Wales Governments will be providing services<br />
to keep pace with the accelerated growth of Albury/ Wodonga beyond<br />
this initial phase.:<br />
The development of Albury/ Wodonga has been accorded high<br />
priority by the Australian Government this year and this will be<br />
reflected in the forthcoming budget.<br />
We reali~ e, of course, that in the development of any new<br />
area there are a multitude of problems to be overcome. With<br />
planning and co-operation between the Australian Government, the<br />
Governments of the two States of Victoria and New South Wales and<br />
local government in the regions, we are confident we will overcome<br />
them. One of the problems which has been aired frequently in<br />
the press and by people in the area is the problem of the rising<br />
price of land. To deal with one aspect of this, the Premiers of<br />
Victoria and New South Wales and I agreed after a meeting at<br />
Albury/ Wodonga on 25 January that the price of land to be acquired<br />
for the purposes of the project would be based at the market level<br />
of prices prevailing at 3 October last year. This means that the land<br />
which the Governments will acquire is stabilised not frozen at<br />
that price. Any necessary adjustments will be made for general<br />
land price changes during the period up to the date of purchase,<br />
caused by factors apart from the announcement of the development </p>
<p>-3-<br />
of the area. In this way we have ensured that no profit is made<br />
merely because the area is to be developed, but that those whose<br />
land is to be acquired will not suffer because of this. Legislation<br />
to implement this decision was introduced into the Victorian<br />
Parliament -in June and will be debated in the Upper House in the<br />
spring session of Parliament. New South Wales expects to introduce<br />
complementary legislation within the same session.<br />
Officers from the Cities Commission have recently been<br />
investigating the whole land question in Albury/ Wodonga. They have<br />
been looking into land availability, the extent to which land is<br />
changing hands : in Albury/ Wodonga and the pressures on existing land,<br />
housing and social infrastructure. We must find out what the facts<br />
are before we can contemplate what action is to be taken.<br />
Today no-one debunks the idea of decentralisation.<br />
However, some people are still dubious about the idea of the<br />
development of inland cities. Australians, they say, want to live<br />
on the coas-t, and they point to the growth in the coastal cities.<br />
It has always been beyond me how people who have to travel for two<br />
hours through weekend traffic to get to the crowded city beaches<br />
can claim to be living on the coast. Whatever relaxation and<br />
regeneration they can claim from this trip to the sea must be<br />
dissipated in the tedious crawl through the traffic to get there<br />
and back. Many Australians liv ng in large " coastal" cities<br />
cannot truly be said to be living by the sea. It takes them as<br />
long to reach the sea as it takes the citizens of that first<br />
successful Australian inland growth centre Canberra. We expect<br />
with the development of Albury/ Wodonga to dissipate this great<br />
coastal cringe and return to something of the feeling of the early<br />
settlers who set off to populate the inland of this vast tract of<br />
earth they had come to occupy.<br />
Much has been said of the advantages of choosing Albury/<br />
Wodonga for our first designated growth centre; its positions on a<br />
major inter-capital link; its present state of development; its<br />
happy incorporation of two States. But I feel that few people yet<br />
realise the advantages to its present and future residents in terms<br />
of what is offering in the surrounding inland countryside. At the<br />
risk of sounding like a tourist guide I suggest that those who might<br />
flinch at the thought of leaving the recreational facilities of their<br />
" 1coastal" cities might consider the enormous scope for activities<br />
like fishing, climbing, walking, ski-ing, canoe-ing and sailing<br />
offered by Albury/ Wodongals proximity to some splendid mountains,<br />
rivers and Lake Hume. For those with an interest in Australian<br />
history nearby towns like Beechworth in Victoria have preserved and<br />
still have in use an almost overwhelming number of buildings<br />
classified by the National Trust. Now that the Government has<br />
established a committee of inquiry into the national estate chaired<br />
by Mr. Justice Hope we would hope that the respect for history<br />
prevailing in such towns will be given an opportunity to prevail<br />
through the rest of Australia, And for those who like their<br />
pleasures somewhat more full-bodied there are of course the<br />
vinyards of the Rutherglen and Glenrowan areas* </p>
<p>-4-<br />
It is this accessibility to a variety of activities which<br />
makes Albury/ Wodonga a satisfying place, in addition to the simple<br />
advantage of living in a smaller and well-planned community.<br />
Compare this with the isolation from most of the benefits of the<br />
city suffered by people living in the sprawling outer suburbs of<br />
Sydney and Melbourne suburbs which are increasingly the only<br />
ones available to young couples who want to buy their own homes.<br />
We spoke of quality of life in the last national<br />
elections. We belieye that the creation of Albury/ Wodonga, along<br />
with other growth centres, will prove a step which will vastly<br />
improve the quality of life of thousands of Australians over the<br />
next few decadeso </p>
