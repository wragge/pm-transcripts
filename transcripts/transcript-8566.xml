TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
ADDRESS AT THE FREMANTLE PORT AUTHORITY, PERTH<br />
JUNE 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
Pam ( Bcggs), Prcmicr Carmen Lawrence, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
I am very plcascd to be here today. I have taken an interest in at least coming to<br />
the port site of the various ports around Australia to get a better minds cyc vicw of<br />
exactly what is happening, where developments arc, where they need to bc and<br />
how to make our port system more cornpctitivc. And because wc have as a theme<br />
of thc ' Onc Nation' package, linking the ports to the rail systcm and as Pam says<br />
creating a rail highway around Australia, a standard-gauge highway and the big<br />
link of course in that being from Adelaide to Melbourne and then improving the<br />
track from Melbourne to Sydney through to Brisbane. That such a system does<br />
provide opportunitics for Western Australia, for Frcmantle for a landbridging<br />
operation across Australia through Melbourne and up through to Sydney or if you<br />
like, as well through Broken down to Sydney.<br />
We're still going through an important phase of the great post-war change In<br />
Australia which began with the removal of exchange controls and the floating of<br />
the exchange rate in 1983. The things which started to pccl back the layers of<br />
management and protection of Australia so that the areas of comparative advantage<br />
were able to excel themselves in this economy and where the focus was taken off<br />
the areas of comparative disadvantage.<br />
I've said over the last day or so in Western Australia and I'll say again, that in the<br />
areas of comparativ. e advantage inmining and agriculture and services in<br />
commodities where we clearly have an advantage, national economic policy has<br />
favoured those areas so it's therefore not a surprise that the two states which have a<br />
great preponderance of thesc industries Western Australia and Queensland arc<br />

now recovering more quickly and growing more strongly than some other regions<br />
of Australia. But to really make it all work, we've got to break the major economic<br />
barriers down and improve the efficiencies of the country and that includes from<br />
the port side right through to plants and services and it mcans in this case, trying to<br />
lift the valuc of the port/ rail interface, the quality of thc port, the efficiency and<br />
productivity of ports and at the same time try and rejuvenate the rail systerns'so<br />
we've got a better balance betwccn sea freight, rail and road so that there's a more<br />
mature system out therc to servie the country as a trading entity.<br />
I'vc said before and it's worth saying again, we are always criticised by the<br />
-Coalition for the speed at which these changes were occurring and T make the<br />
obvious point, if they were so urgent why did they leave them for forty years? My<br />
colleague John Hewson who was advising John Howard, I don't remember him<br />
running any rear guard actions along port productivity or Port reform or manning<br />
levels or ship crewing levels or fixing up the run-down rail infrastructure of<br />
Australia or repairing and putting competition into the road trade system with rail<br />
or In the telecommunication system or any of these things. It has been left to thc<br />
Labor Party to try and crack all these micro-economic nuts and we're In the<br />
process of trying to crack this one now. And in relation to the rail freight system,<br />
that is the national railway, we are trying to conclude ageenficids industrial<br />
agreemcnt with the trade unions for the National Rail Freight Corporation so that<br />
we can start to see the ' One Nton' money flow from next week. From the<br />
beginning of the financial year in the course of the next couple of months, to start<br />
to see the rail improvcments around Australia in a system which is fundamentally<br />
going to be more competitive and where we can see the yield coming from those<br />
efficiencies as we improve the infrastructure that wherc we have efficiency in<br />
staffing across the rail system of Australia.<br />
So that's why I think the. Fremantle landhridgc projpct-study Is Important. That is<br />
the government of Western Australia has undertaken the study as to the prospect of<br />
landbridging in thc new rail system across the continent and particularly accessing<br />
Melbourne and Sydney via Melbourne as well as via Broken Hill. This study is<br />
conclusive in the sense that it believes that such a systcm that Fremantle can<br />
succeed as a landbridging port and a landbridging policy can operate cffectively<br />
from Western Australia across Australia as the first port for much traffic from the<br />
region near Western Australia and where for cargoes in demand that have time<br />
constraints and the rest on them that thcre is a real possibility of cutting down sea<br />
freight times and also port clearance times in the larger ports by landbridging out<br />
of Frcmantlc.<br />
One of the things that Western Australia is now doing and will continue to do is<br />
get that. balanc into its primary exports sector with a larger scrvicc sector. And<br />
the city of Perth largely is a service city and it serves the grcit agricultural and<br />
mining industries of this State and we want to see it develop and proliferate as a<br />
service centre also in things like freight. And in doing so it provides more ballast<br />
to employment in Perth and hopefully by getting an efficient transportation system<br />

it will mean that Western Australia can play its role as a service centre to South-<br />
East Asia, to Indonesia, to Malaysia, to Singapore and all the countries in the<br />
region where the sophistication of Australian services can be provided from thc<br />
city of Perth and from Western Australia generally.<br />
FIn hoping that as we pull the threads of this great change in the rail system<br />
together under the ' One Nation' package and get the greenflelds agreement in place<br />
and start the reconstruction of the Adelaide-Melbourne line, cleaning up the<br />
access through the hills, lifting the bridges out of Fremnantle all the way to<br />
Kalgoorlie so that we can put double stacked containers on rail, that wc Can start to<br />
bring up the efficiencies that makes the rail system competitive with other forms of<br />
transport, shipping included. That may not be designecd to gladden the heart of<br />
shipping companies, but at least it will mean that there may be opportunities and<br />
probably be more opportunities for shipping and landbridging across Australia for<br />
cargoes in demand.<br />
So, can I say that I'm very pleased that the Wustcrn Australian Government has<br />
taken the issue up and now have plans in place to spend the ' One Nation' money to<br />
fulfil the commitment to landbridging and that this study which is part mid parcel<br />
of that which concludes in favour of landbridging that we will see it come to pass<br />
and that the efficiencies which we are seeing coming from thc changes to the<br />
waterfront productivity levels to crew manning on the coast to improvements in<br />
the efficiency of the rail system will lead to a kind of transportation system In<br />
Australia which reflects what it should have always been a more cfficient one for<br />
the kind of trading country we are.<br />
So it is with much pleasure that I launch the project, announce the study, publish<br />
the study and conclude by congratulating Pain as the Minister, but particularly the<br />
Premier for the farsightedness of the Western Australian Governmecnt in finding a<br />
place for Western Australia in the great freight network of Australia and calling<br />
Fremantle first in the great long run across the continent.<br />
Thank you. </p>
