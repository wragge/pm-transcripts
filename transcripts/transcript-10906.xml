    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>Well thank you very much Michael. To Ron and Barbara Walker, my friends,</p>
<p> to the Premier of Victoria Jeff Kennett, the Lord Mayor of Melbourne,</p>
<p> Your Grace, Professor Morrison, my ministerial and Parliamentary colleagues,</p>
<p> and members of the Sisters of Charity, ladies and gentleman.</p>
<p>It is a double privilege, or pleasure, to be here this morning. It's</p>
<p> an opportunity for me to open a centre that will improve the quality</p>
<p> of life of hundreds, indeed thousands of people, predominantly but</p>
<p> not only from Victoria, over the years ahead. It is another illustration</p>
<p> of what Australia does very well and that is to combine the resources</p>
<p> of the government and the public sector more broadly defined, and</p>
<p> those in the community and welfare sector, and the business community,</p>
<p> to achieve outcomes that will improve the quality of life in the community.</p>
<p>And it's also a pleasure for me to be here this morning to publicly</p>
<p> honour the contribution to the community of Ron and Barbara Walker</p>
<p> because for the reasons that Barbara has explained, and also for reasons</p>
<p> for which many in this audience know in relation to Ron, this is a</p>
<p> marvellous illustration of their great capacity to help the community</p>
<p> in which they live.</p>
<p>But it's also an opportunity for me to honour on behalf of the</p>
<p> Government the great service to the Australian community of the Sisters</p>
<p> of Charity, and the health care activities of the Catholic Church</p>
<p> more generally. The name St Vincent's of course is synonymous with</p>
<p> healing and caring and medicine throughout Australia. And there would</p>
<p> over the years literally have been millions of Australians whose lives</p>
<p> have been helped and enriched in hospitals bearing that name and in</p>
<p> the work of the Sisters of Charity. And I do want to say on behalf</p>
<p> of the Government how much that work is appreciated and how much we</p>
<p> value the involvement in the broad health care sector of Australia</p>
<p> of the volunteers, the religious sector and the private sector generally.</p>
<p>You can't have a good health care system in Australia without</p>
<p> both the public sector and the private sector. I think you may have</p>
<p> heard that remark made a little bit over the last few weeks and I</p>
<p> won't dwell very heavily on it. But today is a sort of....you've</p>
<p> got us all here. You've got the Federal Government, you've</p>
<p> got the State Government, you've got the Sisters of Charity,</p>
<p> you've got the medical profession, and you've also got some</p>
<p> many many conspicuous and generous members of the business community</p>
<p> here in Melbourne that have contributed so much.</p>
<p>Today of course we've heard in a very moving way Barbara's</p>
<p> own experiences and I pay tribute to her personal courage as I do</p>
<p> to the philanthropic generosity of Ron Walker who has done so much</p>
<p> to help so many causes. We have an opportunity to open a marvelous</p>
<p> new facility that will improve the quality of life of so many Victorians.</p>
<p> It's an opportunity to reflect on how eminent Australia is in</p>
<p> so many areas of medical discipline. We have I think 0.3% of the world's</p>
<p> population but we contribute something like 2.3% of medical research.</p>
<p>Australian names are well known in medical achievement and although</p>
<p> we are wont on occasions to dwell on some of the imperfections in</p>
<p> our health care and our medical system, I think it is important on</p>
<p> an occasion like this to recognise just how good we are and how many</p>
<p> eminent people we have, and how many world firsts Australia has delivered,</p>
<p> and how much so many countries around the world can learn from what</p>
<p> we do in this area.</p>
<p>The association that the pain management centre will have with the</p>
<p> Bernard O'Brien Microsurgery Unit of course will be a very important</p>
<p> association. And its placement as part of the broader St Vincent's</p>
<p> family will mean it is, as the years go by, it will become a very</p>
<p> important part of the health activities of the City of Melbourne.</p>
<p> Barbara told us of her own personal experiences [tape break] as well</p>
<p> as a very fine and capable and compassionate health minister spoke</p>
<p> of his own professional experience of the advances that have been</p>
<p> made in this field, and the contribution that this centre will make</p>
<p> to the alleviation of suffering and the contribution that this centre</p>
<p> will make as time goes by will further add to the reputation of St</p>
<p> Vinent's. I want to thank all of those who so far have supported</p>
<p> this centre. The Government itself has been pleased to make a contribution</p>
<p> of a quarter of a million dollars towards the centre and I note that</p>
<p> there are many in this room who have been responsible for supporting</p>
<p> it in a very generous fashion and I hope that continues and I again</p>
<p> commend the energetic efforts of Ron Walker in chairing the fund raising</p>
<p> activities and bringing his usual energy and usual commitment to any</p>
<p> project with which he is associated.</p>
<p>I have the opportunity, I welcomed all of those who were participating</p>
<p> in the great sporting tournament, the President's Cup, of remarking</p>
<p> just how well Melbourne did events of that kind. Can I again take</p>
<p> the opportunity of remarking how well this city combines the commitment</p>
<p> of people who hold public office, people who work in the volunteer</p>
<p> sector, and people who are active and successful in the business community</p>
<p> in supporting causes that are important to the civic life and of the</p>
<p> quality of life generally of the people of Victoria and the people</p>
<p> of Melbourne. And today is another example of that and I think the</p>
<p> support that is evident here today bodes very well for future support</p>
<p> for this centre.</p>
<p>I thank all of those associated with, the medical staff, the nurses,</p>
<p> the doctors, the students, the teachers, all associated with these</p>
<p> activities. I wish you well. I have great pleasure in declaring the</p>
<p> Barbara Walker Centre for Pain Management open. I do again pay a personal</p>
<p> tribute to Ron and Barbara who've done so much for this city</p>
<p> and of course have done so much for this magnificent project. I wish</p>
<p> it well and I know it will have your tremendous support. Thank you.</p>
