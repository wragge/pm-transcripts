EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
ROBERTSON/ DOBELL ELECTORATES DINNER<br />
GOSFORD 13 DECEMBER 1986<br />
Federal parliamentary colleagues Barry Cohen and Michael Lee,<br />
Ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Around the middle of next year we will have cause to celebrate<br />
the achievement of a new milestone in this Government's history.<br />
It is probably putting it too high to assert that this milestone<br />
is of international or even national importance. But it is<br />
certainly of considerable significance to the people of Gosford<br />
and district and I could not let slip this opportunity to mention<br />
it tonight.<br />
As I'm sure you all know, Barry: Cohen was first elected to<br />
Parliament as the member for Robertson in 1969.<br />
In the years that have intervened all of us in the Labor Party<br />
nationally and in the electorate of Robertson have had cause to<br />
be grateful that he chose politics in favour of the glittering<br />
promise of life of the pro golfing circuit.<br />
In those years since 1969, Barry Cohen has given the electors of<br />
Robertson great service.<br />
And as the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Environment he is<br />
giving great service to the Federal Government.<br />
Now about this milestone: next August, Barry Cohen will become<br />
this electorate's longest serving member.<br />
The electorate of Robertson was one of the original seats in the<br />
first Federal Parliament of 1901. before Barry Cohen, only one<br />
member for Robertson and a conservative at that had lasted<br />
more than 17 years. Next July, that record tumbles.<br />
So tonight, perhaps a little prematurely but nonetheless<br />
sincerely, I want to congratulate Barry on setting a new<br />
parliamentary record.<br />
Just as importantly, the electors of Robertson deserve praise for<br />
their political wisdom and consistency in electing and<br />
re-electing him over the years. </p>
<p>There is an appropriate symmetry in this dinner being held<br />
jointly by the ALP branches in the electorates of Robertson and<br />
Dobell. For Robertson, as I have said, is one the oldest electorates in<br />
Parliament while Dobell is one of the newest, having been created<br />
in the 1984 redistribution.<br />
And Barry Cohen is one of the longer serving members of the ALP's<br />
parliamentary wing while Michael Lee, the member for Dobell, is<br />
one of the newest and youngest.<br />
I want to say that in his first term in Federal Parliament<br />
Michael Lee has proven himself a very articulate and effective<br />
representative of his electorate.<br />
His presence, and the presence of so many other young and able<br />
Labor Party members, both inside and outside the Federal<br />
parliament, I believe guarantees a bright future for our Party.<br />
There is of course every reason for us to be confident that the<br />
Labor Party will continue to offer Australia effective and<br />
relevant leadership for many years to come.<br />
Look at our track record and look at the alternative offered by<br />
the Liberals.<br />
Our track record is one of achievement and continuing reform and<br />
confident economic management at a time of great economic<br />
difficulties. Their promised alternative is instability, and a return to the<br />
Fraser/ Howard formula of bashing the unemployed, dividing the<br />
community, assaulting the trade union movement and undermining<br />
our national system of Conciliation and Arbitration.<br />
We are convinced of the merits of consultation and cooperation.<br />
They seem determined to set out once more on the rocky and barren<br />
path of confrontation.<br />
I do not want to minimise the problems we still face as a nation<br />
in ensuring economic prosperity.<br />
As we approach the end of 1986, we can look back on what has in<br />
many ways been a turbulent and difficult year for many<br />
Australians. But we can look forward with a degree of cautious optimism to<br />
1987. The sacrifices that were forced on the nation by international<br />
economic adversity have not been in vain.<br />
I believe there is a new spirit abroad in Australia.<br />
A new determination to look critically at the way we have<br />
done things in the past, so as to find ways of doing them<br />
better; I </p>
<p>A new willingness to seize opportunities and make the most of<br />
them for Australia; and,<br />
most hearteningly, a new recognition that all of us<br />
business, governments, wage earners have to do with less<br />
for a time in order to spread fairly the burden of adjustment<br />
now, and to set the best basis for secure economic growth.<br />
And that is why I have been saying these past weeks that we can<br />
enter 1987 with cautious optimism.<br />
The foundations have been laid over the past three and a half<br />
years. Now with the sharp realignment of the currency, we are<br />
able to emerge from a period of turbulence into a period of<br />
renewed competitiveness. Barring unforeseen external factors,<br />
and, I must stress, given continued restraint, Australia can<br />
restore its long term economic stability and prosperity.<br />
This process of readjustment is not an easy transition for<br />
Au st rali a.<br />
But I take comfort from the certain knowledge that a Labor<br />
Government is equipped to manage this readjustment in a<br />
compassionate and caring fashion.<br />
I take no great pleasure as a Labor Prime Minister from<br />
deliberating in the Cabinet room on ways of cutting back Federal<br />
expenditure. As a former trade union leader I take no great joy<br />
from presiding over a period of real wages decline.<br />
It would have been easier if we could have said yes to all the<br />
programs and projects we wanted to get off the ground.<br />
There would have been more short-term political gain in<br />
pretending as conservative governments in this country for<br />
decades pretended that Australia could prosper without hard<br />
work. But responsibly, we could not have side-stepped the need for<br />
tough decisions.<br />
We accepted the unpalatable but necessary disciplines in wage<br />
fixing, monetary policy and in the budget.<br />
And we set about the task of reorienting the nation's economic<br />
institutions and fostering the growth of dynamic, outward-looking<br />
industries which can take on the world's best and win.<br />
But in the process we have not forgotten our obligation to<br />
protect the underdog and those who have traditionally looked to<br />
our Party for help and security.<br />
We have created 670,000 new jobs since coming to office.<br />
we have assisted more than 200,000 people to buy their own homes.<br />
We have lifted funds for public housing by 42 per cent in real<br />
terms. </p>
<p>We have encouraged more children to improve their qualifications<br />
by staying at school rather than prematurely joining the work<br />
force.<br />
We have brought in a better and fairer health insurance system.<br />
And we have reformed the taxation system to make it more<br />
equitable and more efficient.<br />
We have not as would our opponents if, God forbid, they were in<br />
office deliberately fuelled unemployment, or favoured the<br />
well-heeled special interest groups, or allowed the sharp tax<br />
avoiders to rort the taxation system.<br />
We have not followed the prescription of the Leader of the<br />
Opposition in advocating an 18 month wage freeze. Nor have we<br />
supported his position in 18 of the last 20 National Wage Cases<br />
that there be no increase at all in wages.<br />
Only last week we were treated to a bitter insight into the<br />
methods of the Liberal Party and their ideological outriders in<br />
the New Right.<br />
An article in Business Review Weekly finally lifted the lid on<br />
the scandal that is the Liberal Party's industrial relations<br />
policy.<br />
According to that magazine, a coterie of New Right members and<br />
fringe supporters is working hand-in-glove with the Liberal<br />
leadership to produce a policy that is the most radical set of<br />
changes ever contemplated to our national system of industrial<br />
relations.<br />
The New Right treats the Liberal Party with breathtaking disdain,<br />
as is illustrated by one comment from a small business leader. He<br />
is quoted by this magazine as saying:<br />
" We say to Brown" that is Neil Brown, the Liberals' industrial<br />
relations spokesman ' How's that policy going? Have you<br />
toughened up the wimps in the party room yet?"<br />
This genial figure is quoted further as saying: " If we are going<br />
to support the policy we want to see it.'"<br />
And he admits: " I go to Brown's office and he comes to mine. And<br />
I talk to Howard if I think Brown's not helping us. A word in the<br />
right place often does wonders."<br />
The Liberal Party it seems, is so lacking in political wit and<br />
wisdom that it is willing to abdicate its responsibility for<br />
policy formulation to outsiders outsiders whose views of<br />
industrial relations are so far removed from the real world that<br />
the Confederation of Australian Industry castigates them for<br />
indulging in what it called " escapist fantasies".<br />
We saw further evidence of this rampant escapism when the<br />
so-called Australian Federation of Employers presented its<br />
submission to the National Wage Case this week. </p>
<p>It called for a basic wage of $ 171.30 a week a brilliant<br />
proposal indeed which would put basic wage earners actually below<br />
the poverty linel<br />
Well a word in the right place does often do wonders. And the<br />
word the Liberals should utter now is " No" to this appalling<br />
proposal. If the Liberals were truly concerned about the welfare<br />
of the Australian family, they would dissociate themselves from<br />
this proposal, as it would place millions of Australian families<br />
in financial jeopardy.<br />
But they have been silent perhaps through fear of upsetting<br />
that coterie of outsiders writing their industrial relations<br />
policy. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I have said that we can approach the coming year with cautious<br />
optimism as far as the economy is concerned.<br />
There are still tremendous difficulties ahead indeed for a long<br />
time ahead.<br />
There will still be the need for tough decisions.<br />
There will still be a need for restraint.<br />
But the qualities of maturity and willingness to adjust which the<br />
Australian people displayed during 1986 provides the firmest<br />
possible foundations for my confidence about putting our record<br />
before them.<br />
I have no reservations, no doubts, no inhibitions, about the<br />
capacity of the Australian people to make a sound judgement when<br />
the time comes about their government, about the alternative and<br />
about the future they want for themselves and their families.<br />
