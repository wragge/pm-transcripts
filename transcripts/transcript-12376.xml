<p>E&amp;OE..................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Prime Minister, Professor Peter Davis, Jenny Shipley the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Speaker, ministerial members from New Zealand, ladies and gentlemen. It is, for me, and for Janette, a particular pleasure to be back in New Zealand again. This is the third of my bilateral visits to New Zealand in the time I';ve been Prime Minister, and added to that was the very crucial meeting of APEC in New Zealand at the end of 1999.</p>
<p>I do, as both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition said, attach particular significance to our relationship. I said last night at our High Commissioner';s residence, that amongst the more memorable experiences I had last year as Prime Minister was to join your Prime Minister on Gallipoli on the 25th of April on ANZAC Day to take part in the ANZAC commemoration, and to dedicate a new memorial. And the most astonishing thing about that experience for me was to move amongst some 12,000 - 15,000 young Australians and New Zealanders who were making what was visibly a pilgrimage to that very special place in the world that means more to us, our two peoples, than any other place on earth. And therefore it is a very important thing to honour in association, not only in symbolic and emotional ways, as we did by going together to Gallipoli, but it';s also important to honour it in a practical ongoing sense. The history of a relationship is very important, the sentiment and the emotions of a relationship are very important, but so is the modern day flesh and blood of it. You need both. You need the history and the emotions but you also need the common sense, coincidence of interests.</p>
<p>And in my discussions with Helen Clark over the last two days, as was the case in my discussions with Jenny Shipley and Jim Bolger before her, we';ve concentrated on the modern day reality. It';s a modern sophisticated relationship built on common needs, common values and common interests. The economic relationship now is deepening by the month. The new social security arrangement is a win-win for both of our countries. We have dealt in a common sense fashion with a problem that had to be addressed. And I';m sure that it will be seen by the people of our two societies as the most practical and sensible way of dealing with a challenging issue. </p>
<p>I want to take the opportunity, in the presence of this gathering, of recording my immense gratitude on behalf of the Australian people and the Australian Defence Force, of the contribution made by New Zealand to our deployment in East Timor. It made a very heavy call on your armed forces, and it was a very considerable commitment for a country of your size. And I want you to know that it is deeply and continually appreciated in Australia. And I can';t speak too warmly of the positive and approving way in which General Cosgrove, and others who served with him, spoke of having the New Zealanders by their side from the very beginning of the deployment.</p>
<p>We have a lot in common. We';ve shared a lot of history, we';ve shared a lot of contests, sporting and otherwise, and will do a lot more of those into the future. Can I in that context express my thanks for the words of condolence that were conveyed by both your Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition concerning the death of Sir Donald Bradman last night. In many ways he was the most remarkable figure that Australia has produced in the last 100 years, he had an impact on our country that is difficult to properly calculate, not just his sporting prowess but what he meant to our society at a time of despair and economic suffering during the years of the depression. And I do express on behalf of the Australian people and the Australian Government your very kind acknowledgment.</p>
<p>Thank you again for having both of us. We know many New Zealanders, both here and in Australia. We hope that in the years ahead, whoever has the responsibility of occupying various political positions in our two societies, that the relationship will continue to grow and continue to deepen. In the end it is driven by, not only ties of history and sacrifice in war and harmony in peace, but it';s also driven by shared values and shared commitment to democracy, decency, tolerance and openness. They';ve always been hallmarks of our two societies and may it long be the case into the future. </p>
<p>And I, as Prime Minister of Australia, invite you to join me in again honouring a very important toast, and that is a toast to the friendship between the people of Australia and the people of New Zealand.</p>
