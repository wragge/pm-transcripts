FOR PRESS P. M. No 33/ 1970<br />
PREMIERS' CONFERENCE FEBRUARY 1970<br />
COMMONWEALTH'S OFFER NEW FINANCIAL AGREEMENT<br />
The Commonwealth today offered the States new bases for<br />
improving State revenues in a new financial agreement.<br />
The Commonwealth agreed in principle that there should be an<br />
increase in the basic amount of money on which increases in State revenue<br />
grants are calculated and offered to discuss this with the States. The<br />
Commonwealth however, rejected the proposal that the rate of growth should<br />
be tied to the rate of growth of income tax collections.<br />
The Commonwealth also agreed in principle that there should<br />
be a change in the betterment factor so that the State revenue grants should<br />
grow more quickly year by year. This too will be discussed with the States.<br />
The Commonwealth suggested that it should, progressively<br />
over the term of the next agreement, assume full responsibility for a<br />
proportion of State debt suggesting for purposes of illustration a figure<br />
of one billion dollars.<br />
The Commonwealth also suggested that in order to prevent<br />
State debt growing as fast as it otherwise would do the Commonwealth<br />
should provide a portion of the loan programme as, in effect, revenue<br />
grants rather than loans.<br />
The Commonwealth indicated it could not agree to vacating<br />
part of the personal or company income tax field and said that in its<br />
opinion income tax rates in these fields should be uniform and that personal<br />
income tax rates should be decreased from their present levels. However<br />
it undertook to join with the States in examining any proposals made by the<br />
States for an alternative field of growth tax.<br />
