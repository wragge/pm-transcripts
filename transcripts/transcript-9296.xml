PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SEX DISCRIMINATION ACT<br />
SYDNEY, 29 JULY 1994<br />
It's a great honour to be with you to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Sex<br />
Discrimination Act.<br />
When this Labor Government enacted the Sex Discrimination Act ten years<br />
ago, it did so against opposition that was vocal, hostile and ignorant.<br />
This Act was one of the most fiercely contested legislative measures in<br />
Australian political history.<br />
But then again, this seems to be the way of politics in this country: on the big<br />
issues the ones which carry real weight it is always, and only, the Labor<br />
Government that is capable of taking the bold policy step.<br />
The Sex Discrimination Act stands as one of the most significant pieces of<br />
legislation in our history.<br />
But when the Bill was first brought to the House, it was pilloried as the<br />
brainchild of radical feminists radical feminists supposedly intent on<br />
destroying the nuclear family, creating a unisex society and, most dangerous<br />
of all, defying the laws of nature.<br />
Women would be forced into the workforce where they would wreak havoc<br />
because of what one Senator described as " compulsory close cohabitation"<br />
with men.<br />
I should add this enlightened Senator went on to express the grave concern<br />
that husbands would be surrounded by glamorous women intent on<br />
seduction. Of course, the Sex Discrimination Act did not force women into the workforce<br />
women have always been in the workforce.<br />
What the critics at the time failed to understand was that women themselves<br />
were embracing change. </p>
<p>The dramatic changes in women's lives weren't being forced upon them by<br />
the Government or the women's movement, it was the women themselves<br />
who demanded more choices, better opportunities and freedom from<br />
discrimination. But ground breaking legislation always brings out the high emotions in those<br />
who want to remain locked in the closets of the past.<br />
You only have to go back to last year and the racism and fear drummed up<br />
over Mabo.<br />
And we should always remember that when the Native Title Act was returned<br />
to the House of Representatives for final passage the people's house<br />
the Leader of the Opposition branded that day " a day of shame".<br />
If we didn't have the Tories still with us today, it would probably be hard to<br />
believe the Sex Discrimination Act caused the controversy it did just ten years<br />
ago. The Act's underlying purpose was and remains very simple: to end<br />
discrimination on the basis of sex, marital status or pregnancy, and to<br />
promote community respect for the principle of the equality of men and<br />
women. Since the Act's inception, more than 7,000 complaints have been lodged<br />
the overwhelming majority of these employmyiitnf-elated:<br />
And, contrary to predictions that the Act would only benefit an elite group of<br />
women, complaints have come from all spheres of employment.<br />
The Act has been used by young women many complaining of sexual<br />
harassment by older women, Aboriginal women and women from non-<br />
English backgrounds.<br />
The Act has also been used by men.<br />
But numbers of cases or complaints can never fully capture the impact of this<br />
Act. This Act has helped bring about a change in Australia's cultural<br />
infrastructure.<br />
The values, it encapsulates, have found vocal expression in the working lives<br />
of women and men, in all areas of activity and in all workplaces.<br />
One journalist described it well when she referred to the " accidental<br />
feminists" those women who do not consciously identify with the feminist<br />
movement but who articulate feminist expectations and aspirations. </p>
<p>These women, who tend to shy away from the " IF word", ardently support<br />
equal pay and equal opportunity.<br />
So, despite a remark from a member of the Liberal Party ten years ago that<br />
" this Bill means nothing at all", the women of Australia know that this Act<br />
means a great deal.<br />
But this Act can't be effective in isolation it must co-exist with other social,<br />
economic and political strategies for improving the status of women.<br />
That's why the Government has consistently supported strategies such as the<br />
provision of affordable, quality child care; the payment of family assistance<br />
directly to women caring for children; greater access to superannuation;<br />
affirmative action for women in employment; and better access to training and<br />
education. On this tenth anniversary, I think it's appropriate that we pay tribute to the<br />
many women and men who fought hard for the sex discrimination legislation<br />
and who, in the ten years since, have supported the Act and continued the<br />
fight for equality.<br />
But I'm sure no one will mind if I signal out for special attention the pivotal<br />
role played by the trio of Susan Ryan, then the Minister Assisting the Prime<br />
Minister for the Status of Women, Anne Summers, Head of the Office of the<br />
Status of Women at the time the Bill was debated, and Chris Ronalds who<br />
was the legal consultant to the Office of the Status of Women.<br />
Their work in conceiving, drafting and guiding the Bill through Parliament<br />
earned them the label " Ryan's ruthless juggernaut".<br />
At the time, I suspect it was meant to be an insult, but it soon became a<br />
badge of pride, an apt description of the fierce and unrelenting determination<br />
and energy of three women who wanted to make a difference, to change the<br />
social order for the better.<br />
In all this, it is important to emphasise that their battle for the rights of women<br />
is part of a broader vision for a more egalitarian and socially just Australia<br />
a vision this Labor Government shares.<br />
This is a crucial point: by arguing for equal rights and equal opportunity,<br />
women are not pleading for special favours, they are fighting for a better<br />
Australia for both women and men.<br />
The Sex Discrimination Act is often portrayed as radical and ground breaking<br />
legislation.<br />
And so it is. </p>
<p>' p 4<br />
But it is also a very pragmatic document.<br />
Ten years ago, the Government had to concede a number of issues to get the<br />
legislation passed.<br />
The strategic victory at the time was to enact the legislation, to ensure we<br />
had in place a solid foundation on which we could build.<br />
And that's what we have done.<br />
In 1992, in responding to the Lavarche Report Halfway to Equal, the<br />
Government made a number of significant amendments to the Sex<br />
Discrimination Act. We also foreshadowed other amendments.<br />
Today, I am pleased to announce a further five proposals to improve the<br />
effectiveness of the Act. I<br />
First, the Government believes it is necessary to make a strong legislative<br />
statement that clearly expresses our commitment that sex discrimination and<br />
sexual harassment will not be tolerated in our society.<br />
To this end, a Preamble will be inserted into the Act incorporating a general<br />
prohibition on discrimination and a statement proclaiming the equality before<br />
the law of women and men.<br />
Second, to combat discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy, potential<br />
pregnancy will be explicitly proscribed as a ground of discrimination and the<br />
reasonableness defence in relation to direct discrimination on the grounds of<br />
pregnancy will be removed.<br />
These amendments will afford better protection to women in public life and<br />
send a clear message that this type of discrimination will not be tolerated.<br />
Third, we will extend the definition of the proscribed ground of marital status<br />
to cover the identity or occupation of the complainant's spouse.<br />
Discrimination on the grounds of spousal identity predominantly affects<br />
women and is unjustifiable except in very narrow circumstances.<br />
Fourth, we will simplify the definition of indirect discrimination and place the<br />
onus on the respondent to justify the reasonablenes -s of tii-discriminatory<br />
requirement. Tackling indirect discrimination is a key element in the elimination of<br />
discrimination because the barriers to equality are often the result of<br />
apparently neutral practices. </p>
<p>However, due to the complexity of the Act's test for indirect discrimination and<br />
the lack of public understanding on this issue, there have been only 11 such<br />
complaints in the Act's ten year operation. I hope that these amendments will<br />
raise awareness of this provision.<br />
Fifth, the exemption extended to the Australian Defence Force for the<br />
employment of women will be narrowed so as to only apply to combat duty.<br />
In making this amendment, I'm happy to say the Government is' sirnply<br />
reflecting the change which has already occurred in the Australian Defence<br />
Force.<br />
Women can now serve in all Defence Force positions except those involving<br />
direct physical combat.<br />
This has opened up many employment and career opportunities. Back in<br />
1984, around 10 per cent of Defence Force positions were open to women.<br />
Today, women can be employed in over 65 per cent of the positions in the<br />
Army and over 90 per cent of those in the Navy and Air Force.<br />
The sixth and final amendment concerns the special measures provision.<br />
This provision recognises that there are situations where exact parity of<br />
treatment between men and women cannot eradicate discrimination and that<br />
extra steps are often required to facilitate equality.<br />
Unfortunately, the rationale for this provision has often been misunderstood<br />
by the community and narrowly interpreted by courts and tribunals.<br />
To remedy this, the amendment moves the ' special measures' provision out<br />
of the " Exemptions" Division of the Act and relocates it in Part 1 dealing with<br />
definitions of discrimination.<br />
It is hoped that this shift will foster recognition that such special measures do<br />
not constitute discrimination but are a key part of the process of ensuring<br />
equality.<br />
The Sex Discrimination Act was a landmark piece of legislation when it was<br />
passed. But like most laws, it needs to be scrutinised to ensure it is in tune<br />
with current realities. It is good law, but we want to make it better.<br />
The amendments I have announced today have the dual purpose of attacking<br />
the structural inequalities that continue to exist and making the Act more<br />
accessible. No doubt these proposals will encounter opposition as the original act did.<br />
We must resist that opposition as we did then. </p>
<p>I 6<br />
I congratulate the thousands of women and the many men who fought<br />
for the introduction of this Act.<br />
I congratulate the thousands of women who have used the Act to redress<br />
discrimination.<br />
And I urge all Australians to support the Act in our stand for the full equality of<br />
women and men.<br />
Thank you. </p>
