    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the Governor-General has approved appointments to the Council for the Order of Australia including two new members.</p>
<p>The Council is independent of government and meets twice a year to consider nominations and to make recommendations for awards in the Order of Australia to the Governor-General. The Council consists of members appointed by the Governor-General on my recommendation, representatives of each State and Territory and three ex officio members. The appointments are for two years.</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Peter Sinclair AC RAN (retd) will continue as chairman of the Council which next meets on 22 August 2000.</p>
<p>Members of the Council who have been reappointed are:</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Peter Sinclair AC        Former Governor of NSW<br />
The Hon Sir James Killen KCMG        Barrister and former Federal Minister<br />
Dr George Santoro AM               Former President, Australian Medical Association (Victoria Branch)<br />
Mrs Marjorie Turbayne OAM        President, Australian Capital Territory Australia Day Council<br />
Dr Margaret Valadian AO MBE        Director, Aboriginal Education Centre, Wollongong University</p>
<p>Ms Kerri-Anne Kennerley, Media Presenter, has been recently appointed and her appointment continues.</p>
<p>New members are Major General Digger James AC MBE MC (retd), former National President of the Returned and Services League of Australia and Mrs Marina Darling, Managing Director of the CapoNero Group. General James and Mrs Darling replace Mr Allan Border AO and Mrs Sara Henderson who have served on the Council since 1996 and I would like to express, on behalf of the government and myself, our appreciation for the important contribution they made to the work of the Council.</p>
<p>I am delighted that these distinguished Australians have agreed to give of their time to this important role. They bring to the Council a breadth of experience and achievement which all Australians can respect and admire.</p>
