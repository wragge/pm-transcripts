AUST RALIA~-<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 15 JUNE 1982<br />
DR RICHARD ST BARBE BAKER<br />
S I was saddened to learn of the death last week of<br />
Dr Richard St Barbe Baker, the noted Canadian authority<br />
on trees.<br />
Dr St Barbe Baker was Senior Patron of the Australian Year<br />
of the Tree Campaign which I launched on World Environment<br />
Day earlier this month.<br />
Dr Baker was also well known as the founder of. the international<br />
Men of the Trees movement. He had visited Australia several<br />
times most recently in March 1982, after he had accepted the<br />
Patronage of the Australian Year of the Tree.<br />
I<br />
AI-Australians wi l note with: sadness the passing of<br />
Dr St Barbe Baker and acknowledge his long devotion to tree<br />
planting throughout the world. The Australian Year of the<br />
Tree campa-Lgn is a fitting memorial to his efforts. </p>
