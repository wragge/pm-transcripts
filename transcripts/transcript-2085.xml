PRESIDENT THIEUS STATEMENT ON FREE ELECTIONS<br />
IN VIETNAM<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The statement which President Nguyen Van Thieu<br />
has made today is a most important one. It demonstrates<br />
strikingly his willingness to do his part in clearing the way for<br />
a political solution that will end the fighting and at the same time<br />
let the people of South Vietnam determine their own future.<br />
President Thieu has indicated that in free elections,<br />
the N. L. F. would be allowed to contest the polls if they renounce<br />
violence and pledge themselves to accept the result of the election.<br />
The N. L. F. could be represented in the arrangements for the<br />
conduct of the elections. An international body would supervise<br />
the elections and make sure that they were held under conditions<br />
fair to all. President Thieu's government is prepared to discuss<br />
with the other side the timetable and the modalities under which<br />
the election will be held. The President has also pledged that<br />
there would be no reprisals or discrimination after the elections.<br />
His government has declared that it will abide by the results of<br />
the election whatever those results might be.<br />
This is a very significant statement removing<br />
obstacles which certain people in other countries have seen in<br />
the way of a peaceful outcome.<br />
President Thieu's political initiative today, and<br />
President Nixon's speech on 15 May, demonstrate the sincerity<br />
of the Republic of Vietnam and its allies in seeking for a just<br />
and lasting peace in accordance with the wishes and interests of<br />
the Vietnamese people. kt is up to the other side to respond.<br />
