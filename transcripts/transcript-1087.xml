KEVJ MAYORAL DINNER 3DA-PRILs 196j<br />
Oeech by the Prime Ninister the R S_ rRoert Menzie s<br />
Mr. Mayor, Councillor Stephens and Parliamentary Colleagues,<br />
Your Honours and Gentlemen<br />
Man and boy, I have been coming around as Member for<br />
Kooyong for thirty-four and a half years. I suppose I must<br />
have attended a pretty high percentage of the Kew Mayoral<br />
Dinners in that time and I am delighted to find that Councillor<br />
Stephens has follow0red a great tradition because on not one<br />
occasion can I ever remember not hearing something about the<br />
grievances from which my native State suffers. ( Laughter)<br />
And yet I have still. come around. Apparently there must be<br />
some balancing factors somewhere.<br />
He has put some questions to me which I don't think<br />
I will endeavour to answter except in one or two particulars.<br />
As he spoke, I thought I would like to put a question to him.<br />
I think while he was up he might have explained on behalf of<br />
the Board what its trouble was with the Government of Victoria<br />
about the ring road. ( Laughter) This is one of the few matters<br />
which I can observe from on high because nothing gives us any<br />
greater satisfaction in life than to see the other fellow in<br />
trouble. But I desist. I wouldn't dream of putting that<br />
question to him. I think that's a matter that he might thrash<br />
out with Dick Hamer in the Mayor's Room which seems to have a<br />
rather attractive connotation about it the Mayor's Room or<br />
is it a dry Qupboard?<br />
I just want to say one thing about Tullamarine.<br />
You know, really, this is one of those problems on whichyou<br />
can't win. If somebody decides that something ought to be done<br />
about a new jet airport at Tullamarine, there are screams of<br />
rage and anguish from Sydney which appears to be under the<br />
impression that the abolition of Mascot is under immediate<br />
consideration. ( Laughter) And as far as Tullamarine is<br />
concerned, well, we started this; there is a lot of work that<br />
has been going on on the runways.<br />
The volume of work, the volume of airlines traffic in<br />
Australia is multipl-, ing at an enormous rate. That is something<br />
that is worth remembering. And what was at one stage<br />
contemplated as an adequate terminal turns out before long to<br />
be quite inadequate for the enormous and growing volume of<br />
business, All I can say is that if I were a Victoriar as<br />
indeed I am, and a Melbourne man as indeed I am I think I<br />
would be prepared to wait a little longer to get a very much<br />
better air terminal rather than have one that was inadequate<br />
from the viord go. This happens all the way round.<br />
We, exercising our authorities, decided to buy a great<br />
aircraft now called the F1i1A which was the TFX. It was a<br />
matter of some controversy, you will remember, at the time.<br />
All right, well we had a date for delivery. -e accepted that<br />
date. 4e have since agreed to extend that date for a year not<br />
because we couldntt get the aircraft by that date but because<br />
our experts told us that all the teething troubles taat a new<br />
aircraft has will be very much better adjusted and modifications<br />
made in the United States of America, and if we wait for a year,<br />
we will have a much better aircraft and have much less adjustment<br />
and therefore much less loss of service when we take delivery ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
of the plane, and we said " Yes" and that is something I recommend<br />
to Councillor Stephens for his consideration. That's all,<br />
I was interested in what he said about oil, offshore<br />
oil because contrary to the belief that I entertained until<br />
I came here tonight, I thought the State of Victoria was<br />
extraordinarily prosperous. I owe that knowledge to all my<br />
Victorian Parliamentary colleagues. It is quite true there is<br />
a conference about off-shore oil drilling and it is very necessary<br />
because there is a great argument which would be difficult even<br />
for the most distinguished lawyers to resolve as to where the<br />
State jurisdiction begins or ends and where the Commonwealth<br />
jurisdiction begins or ends because some of the drilling may be<br />
inside territorial waters as we narrowly define them within the<br />
three-mile limit, and some may now be on what we are now calling<br />
the Continental shelf and it is eminently desirable that people<br />
who are going to drill for oil and who are going to lay out<br />
vast sums of money in it should have some security of title,<br />
that they should know that they had a valid licence without<br />
being confronted some day by the proposition, " dell, youtve<br />
got a licence from the State and not from the Commonwealth<br />
and therefore it's no go." Or " You got a licence from the<br />
Commonwealth and not from the State and therefore itts no go." 1<br />
So, as sensible people, we are conferring with the<br />
States through their Law Offices, to see whether we can't<br />
determine some working principle under which the States themselves<br />
who have Mines Departments and the like will, of course,<br />
administer whatever scheme is worked out but under which the<br />
people who are going to lay out their money will know that they<br />
have a secure title. As some of this may be within the threemile<br />
limit and a great deal more of it may be outside the threemile<br />
limits I think we have been fairly sporting on this matter.<br />
vie have said, " Let's pool our constitutional resources. Dot<br />
let us have a lot of litigation and argument. Let us agree on a<br />
system of licensing and let us divide the royalties fifty-fifty." 1<br />
NowT that seems to me to be a very fair proposition and I hope<br />
that in Brisbane it will be accepted.<br />
But there was one other matter that was raised and<br />
I did make up my mind when I was coming here tonight that I<br />
wrould like to say something about it, You know, the Commonwealth<br />
Government may have a very far-reaching responsibility. In<br />
the public eye, their responsibilities frequently exceed their<br />
pow--ers because tlheir powiers can be extremely limited in various<br />
respects. For example, it would be in a broad way true to say<br />
that it is the Commonwealth Parliament and Government that has<br />
the responsibility for overall economic and financial policy.<br />
This is true. But that authority or responsibility is affected<br />
very obviously by. the fact that there are large tracts in the<br />
economic and financial field which we can't touch.<br />
For example, we have a system of industrial arbitration<br />
in Australia which is the creation of the Constitution and<br />
uhich really can't be destroyed except by an Act of Parliament<br />
which repeals it. Nobody contemplates that. And therefore we<br />
await the result of arbitral proceedings just as eagerly as other<br />
people would because we know that whatever the result may be, it<br />
may very well have a material effect on the whole of our<br />
financial and economic policy for the year or ovrer a period of<br />
years, So there are great limitations. oe* .6.3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
There are bodies which have been established which<br />
impinge on the Commonwealth's authority in exactly the same way,<br />
Mr. Mayor, as you well know as a banker that although we have<br />
some authority over banking and bank interest rates and the like,<br />
we don't appear to have any authority over what have been called<br />
fringe banking institutions which are not quite banks but which do<br />
collect and use very very large sums of money including a large<br />
quantity of short-term money in Australia, dJell, this is a<br />
limitation on our jurisdiction and I am bound to say on our<br />
behalf that I think on the whole over these last dozen years we<br />
have managed to create and sustain an economic and financial<br />
climate which has helped to produce great prosperity in this<br />
country. ( Applause) And my old friend then put the question and this is<br />
really what I wanted to say a little about, about the South East<br />
of Asia, and in particular what goes on in Vietnam. It is<br />
necessary I think to remember a few facts on this matter because<br />
although ihese worls like North Vietnam and South Vietnam and'<br />
Cambodia and Laos now come rather trippingly to the tongue, these<br />
are after all a modern development, speaking in terms of political<br />
boundaries, because we are dealing with what used to be called<br />
Indo-China. Somebody said to me only this morning, " How many North<br />
Vietnamese are there in South Vietnam?" 1 And I S3id " Well,<br />
you might as well ask me how many Yorkshiremen are living in<br />
the Home Counties in England because we are not dealing with<br />
ide ntifiably different people."' But when the settlement<br />
occurred and when great troubles broke out and when the Committee<br />
of Control was established, a line was drawn along the 17th<br />
parallel with a provision in the terms of the peace or of the<br />
cease-fire that there should be a complete cease-fire and<br />
that there should be a completely demilitarised zone for<br />
five kilometres on each side of the parallel. And if all that<br />
has foundered, I just want to remind you that in my opinion it<br />
can't be attributed to any default or aggression on the part of<br />
the people or governments of South Vietnam,<br />
The aggression has been quite in the other direction,<br />
and it has been made all the more effective because pockets of<br />
what they now call the Viet Cong have been established some of<br />
them deep into South Vietnam, some of them very very close to<br />
Saigon and some of them e~ ng into Cambodia, and these are<br />
Cormlurllst pockets whose main object is to destroy the Government<br />
of South Vietnam and therefore open the door to conquest of the<br />
South by the North, by Hanoi, and therefore as I venture to say,<br />
ultimately by Peking.<br />
Now this is a tremendously serious problem because let<br />
me point out to you that if Vietnam fell as a whole, Thailand<br />
would be under tremendous challenge with a long and difficult<br />
frontier to defend and how long Thailand might be expected to<br />
last under those circumstances is anybody's guess, And our<br />
friend Prince Sihanouk there are no Press here, are there? in<br />
Cambodia has rather made it clear that given peace and quiet,<br />
he is quite prepared to be under the Communist rule just as much<br />
as any other. Now this is a very serious problem and the Government<br />
of South Vietnam invited the United States of America to do<br />
something about it, They were well entitled to do that just as<br />
they were entitled to ask us because we are parties to the South<br />
a&amp; as** </p>
<p>East Asian Treaty. aJe were one of the sponsors and we belong<br />
to it and the obligations under the jouth-East Asian Treaty are<br />
several as q~ ell as joint. It is worth remembering that.<br />
South Vietnam though it isn't a party to the South East Asian<br />
Treaty is what is called one of the protocol states. In other<br />
words, an attack on it is regarded as something that brings into<br />
existence the machinery of the South East Asian Treaty Organisation,<br />
Therefore we, partly as a matter of obligation, and<br />
partly as a matter of right, are taking some small part in the<br />
operations in Vietnam and the Americans are taking a very large<br />
port in the operations in Vietnam, but it is the fashion now<br />
of extreme people in AustraJ~ ia to fasten on to the United States,<br />
to raise questions " What are they doing there? Jhat has it<br />
got to do with the United States?" If the United States paid<br />
any attention to this thing and left, then * South Vietnam would<br />
be a memory in a fortnight. That's all. And the whole of<br />
South East Asia would be in imminent danger of falling into the<br />
communist hands, What would happen under those circumstances<br />
in relation to Malaysia you can well understand because Malaysia<br />
is an integral part of South-East Asia and therefore vulnerable<br />
if it is entirely surrounded by and attacked by people who have<br />
very superior forces somewhere in the background. All I can say is<br />
I am jolly thankful America is taking an interest in South<br />
Vj~ tnam. It would be a very sad day for us if the United States<br />
were not. It is worthwhile when we hear these critics say, " Jell.,<br />
why do the Americans take a hand in South Vietnam?" does 0<br />
anybody believe that they want to annex the country? You know,.<br />
I have heard more nonsense talked about imperialism and colonialism<br />
and neo-colonialism, and I suppose neo-imperialism, than would<br />
fill volumes. It is all rather silly and rather nauseating.<br />
They don't want to have South Vietnam as a colony, I cant<br />
imagine any more uncomfortable position than to be the Colonial<br />
Minister in an American Administration with Vietnam as one of your<br />
colonies, This doesn't make sense,<br />
Well are they there simply to attend to their own<br />
defence in a limited and local sense? Of course not. Whether we<br />
can live without a relatively free South-East Asia is a major<br />
question for us but a relatively minor question, if you like,<br />
for the United tates of America. This grudging habit of mind,<br />
this great temptation all the time to be questioning the Americans<br />
and their motives and so on and if one of us defends it, one is<br />
told, well you are jusZ squaring off with the Americans"<br />
Squaring off with I repeat: Why are they there?<br />
Why are they losing men? TJhy are they sustaining battle casualties<br />
and bombing outrages and all these things? Why are they spending<br />
millions and millions and millions of money in the defence of<br />
South Vietnam? The answer is quite simple.<br />
Because they know that though South Vietnam may be of<br />
minor importance to them, it has a particular significance for<br />
the defence of the free world, for the defence of a world w. hich<br />
still retains some religious principles and faith and doesn't<br />
want to be overrun by a lot of materialistic and atheistic<br />
Communist powers. And they know that. The Americans have had<br />
wisdom, I think, on this matter. They have made it quite clear<br />
that to them freedoma is not divisible so that you yield it there<br />
and preserve it there. They believe that the great issue in the<br />
world is: How far those people who are now free will continue<br />
to be free. This is a tremendous and an imaginative and a<br />
generous outlook on their part. We sometimes think they are not<br />
000 0 </p>
<p>very imaginative about certain matters. I believe th'ey have<br />
been imaginative on this to the nthc power. They know, They<br />
see the world as a whole. They see the menace of an aggressive<br />
communism as a whole and they have made up their minds that where<br />
they have in the world people who are free and who want to live<br />
their own lives and have no ambition except to live at peace and<br />
cultivate their oun gardens they the United States of America<br />
will put themselves in t he Iront of the defence. IC find this<br />
admirable, Admir.. ble. And I have indeed great occasion I as<br />
you have, to be thankful that that is their point of view.<br />
Now that, I think Sir, is my answer to the question<br />
about South Vietnam. The whole of this South East Asian<br />
business is completely bedevilled by all sorts of cross currentp<br />
and special issues. There is the attitude of Indonesia which<br />
I think is unthinking and wild and really irresponsible but<br />
still it is an attitude which has put our people into battle,<br />
which has put thousands and thousands of British troops alongside<br />
Malayan troops into the defence of Malaysia. These are not good<br />
things. These are not happy things, but we can't be happy all<br />
the time, We are an astonishingly happy people and we have every<br />
reason to be. 4' e are jolly well off. Ie are very well provided<br />
for, There has been a revolution in our economic position in<br />
modern times in Australia and we have every reason to be thankful<br />
for it. All these things have to be bought for some price and one<br />
price that has to be paid is that we can't have all this comfort<br />
and satisfaction to ourselves and leave it to the greatest power<br />
in the world, the United States, to defend us, because ultimately<br />
that is what it comes to in these countries, and then give<br />
ourselves the luxury of saying, " Well, I wonder what they are up<br />
to. You know, the Ameñ icans they oughtn't to be there. They<br />
ought to cease fire. 4hatever the other man does, they are to<br />
stop.", This doesntt make sense. Or when they are confronted,<br />
by an enemy which is quite ruthless penetrating and uncommonly<br />
successful, they ought to say, " W'ell, now, wait a moment. tUe<br />
i. rould like to come and negotiate with you." It is like<br />
negotiating with a burglar when he was well inside the house, and<br />
making a composition with him " Well, you can have all the<br />
jewellery as long as you leave me the banknotes." 1 This is<br />
I think, a hopelessly impractical idea. Of course we want Z<br />
see peace. ' Je never will see peace in this part of the world<br />
until the communists are persuaded and persuaded by force if<br />
necessary that they are not going to overrun decent, innocent<br />
people outside their ambit.<br />
WJell now, Sir, I think that is all I wanted to say<br />
except to tell you that I have had quite an interesting time<br />
tonight because I have seen about four men here tonight whom I<br />
hadn't seen for donkeyts years. All of them are contemporaries<br />
of mine to within a few months and I &amp; mf happy to say that I found<br />
them all looking asto nishingly young. They thought so too<br />
and I waited anxiously to be told that I did but none of them had<br />
the gall to say that. However, we parted temporarily as very<br />
good friends. Sir, I am delighted to be here. Thank you very much<br />
indeed. You always entertain us magnificently and I am now<br />
going to sit down and listen to Dick Hamer tell us all about the<br />
Ringstrasse. </p>
