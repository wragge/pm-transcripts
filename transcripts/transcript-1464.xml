FOR PRESS : 61/ 021 P. M. No. 2/ 1967<br />
U THANT'S JUDGMENT ON VIET NAM<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
While U Thant, speaking at his first full-dress press<br />
conference since his re-appointment, did so with the authority of the<br />
Secretary-General of the United Nations, his comments, challenging the<br />
contention that Viet Nam is strategically vital to Western interests and<br />
security are those which derive from his personal judgment. There will<br />
be many in positions of authority who do not share this judgment and this<br />
certainly includes my own Gove-i ment. We consider that the outcome in<br />
Viet Nam is vital to the security of the countries of South-East Asia and the<br />
Pacific and indeed of Asia generally.<br />
VWe are convinccel that other free countries of this region<br />
also believe this. I would include in this list Korea, the Republic of China,<br />
Thailand, the Republic of Viet Nam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore,<br />
New Zealand and Australia. It is my own belief that this view is also<br />
widely held in Japan, India and Indonesia.<br />
The issue in Viet Nam is a basic factor affecting the<br />
prospects for peace, prosperity and progress and true national independence<br />
in this area of the world. It has been justly asserted that peace and<br />
prcolperity are each indivisible. An issue which affects directly or indirectly<br />
the well-being of so many of the world's people must be vital in any<br />
realistic sense to the western world.<br />
17 communist expansion in South-East Asia had been allowed<br />
to proceed unchecked, I personally question whether the overthrow of<br />
communism in Indonesia would have occurred. With much of Asia under<br />
communist control and the sub-continent of India under threat, could the<br />
western world have remained inactive? But for massive and effective<br />
military and civil assistance from friendly countries outside the region,<br />
the countries of South-East Asia would either have to carry a crippling<br />
defence burden, frustrating to their plans of development and social improvement,<br />
or live under constant threat of external danger or internal subversion<br />
and terrorism. The free countries of this region want the western world<br />
to know that we regard the contribution made in particular by the United<br />
States to the security and progress of this area as fundamental to our<br />
prospects of security and national growth.<br />
It is our judgment that in accepting these burdens, the<br />
United States is also performing a service vital to the prosperity, security<br />
and well-being of the entire free world.<br />
