SHEPPT ON, Victoria<br />
? Lth NOVEMBER, 126 </p>
<p>8 MONDA&amp; YO 20th NOVEMBER 1961.<br />
As I address the Australian people tonight I'm conscious<br />
that I speak with a dual capacity. I speak for the Government, as<br />
Mr. Menziest partner and Deputy Prime Minister. At the same time and<br />
without any sense of rivalry, I speak as Leader of the Australian<br />
Country Party. For 12 years the Liberal Party and the Country Party have<br />
* joined in partnership to compose the most long-lived, and the most<br />
stable Government our Country has ever had,<br />
Mr. Menzies is a very great Australian a world figure.<br />
He's given leadership to this country during itts most dranatic<br />
period of industrial and, economic development.<br />
There's never been the slightest note of discord in our<br />
partnership. Compare that with the deep cleavages within the Labor<br />
. Party. This great partnership is dedicated to the pursuit of the<br />
very broadest national policies, not narrow sectional ones.<br />
Tonight I am to speak of the policies of our partnership<br />
and the objectives we still aim at, and in particular of the<br />
specialised contribution which the Australian Country Party brings<br />
to the good Government, development and the general well-being of<br />
Australia. When policies are being spoken of at election timne, the<br />
formula for composing an or'thodox speech can become a very simple<br />
one : to denounce the opposing party and its policies, and to<br />
outline an attractive list of proposals, and then beg to be elected.<br />
Ilm not going to do that.<br />
I shall speak of course of the principles which will<br />
always guide us. 2. </p>
<p>.2.<br />
And I shall stress how in our every action wetre dedicated<br />
to the principle of partnership and co-operation for the coto~ on goal<br />
of national progress and national security; partnership between the<br />
political parties, comprising the Governnmcnt; partnership between<br />
town and country; between primary and secondary and service industry;<br />
and partnership between Australia and our great Allies and trading<br />
partners around the world.<br />
I shall refer to the Opposition only to bring out a point<br />
of comparison.<br />
POLICY OBJEC TVES.<br />
Above all we're determined that this country shall be<br />
free and remain free. And scarcely less important we want<br />
Australians individually to enjoy the maximum of freedom to shape their<br />
own lives within their own country.<br />
Communism is the ultimate denial of personal freedom.<br />
Therefore we denounce Communism. The Country Party was the first<br />
political organisation in Australia to demand that Communism be banned,<br />
Secondly, we recognise that the doctrines of Socialism, as<br />
embraced by the Australian Labor Party, with the whole concept of<br />
economic, industrial, and personal controls is contradictory to our<br />
idea of maximum personal freedom. So we oppose Socialism as being a<br />
contradiction of our concept of a free and self reliant Australian<br />
nation. We support the United Nations as the international<br />
instrument seeking to establish a world of law and peace, and we<br />
reinforce our own strength by contributing in every manner to the<br />
cohesion of the Q ueen's Commonwealth? and by Treaties and understandings<br />
with our great friend, the United States, and our partners<br />
in S. E. A. T. O. and A. N. Z. U. S. alliances to safeguard our part of the<br />
world* / 3 </p>
<p>We want to be strong; we want to be free; we want to<br />
be secure; so we abhor CGomunism abroad and at home. And we<br />
vigorously oppose Socialism in Australia*<br />
To have our country strong and robust, there's nothing<br />
more important than that there should be a widespread sense of<br />
pride in the country. So we aim to avoid disunity. N~ ational<br />
cohesion and economic strength are greatest where there is full<br />
equality of opportunity. ' f4tree constantly broadening the<br />
opportunity for better education, and contributing by health policies<br />
to the prospect of avoidance and cure of illness and disability.<br />
Some Australians will want their security in jobs; others will want<br />
to make their own employment in farm or business. Our policies cover<br />
Oboth. Thatts our idea of a real land of security and<br />
opportunity. That's the' kind of Australia wetre aiming to build*<br />
I've been illustrating our policy objectives by talking<br />
about what we see and plan for our fellow 10J million Australians<br />
0their security and their happiness*<br />
ECONOMIC FACTORS.<br />
0 But let me now turn to the economic facts of life upon<br />
which security and prosperity really depend. ', Ie live in a<br />
competitive world maybe an envious world. And 10 million<br />
Australians of our day have the job of developing a Continent. The<br />
population of Australia must be built up fast7 and with the right<br />
type of people. How better could I illustrate what we want to do than to<br />
point out in the 12 years of this Government the Australian<br />
population has grown with the aid of a record migration programme<br />
from 7,900,000 people in 1949 to lO 2 million people today. And<br />
today we find in every walk of life our new fellow Australians<br />
con tributing most valuably to the progress of the nation. / 0 </p>
<p>.4e<br />
The Country Party wants the maixiiuum number of migrants to become<br />
landowners and bring stability, pride and skill to land o,,; nership.<br />
Our policy is to aid that.<br />
Where some displacement from employment has occurred it<br />
has been in the course of building a base sounder than ever before<br />
for real maximum employment opportunities, I undertake that we will<br />
pursue industrial policies which do provide a job for everyone* ' 7e<br />
know that jobs must come from expanding industry.<br />
A real job is found in industry not in a politician's<br />
* speech. There's no comparable instance in history where such a<br />
0proportion of people from outside have been added to the national<br />
population without creating friction or minority or nationalistic<br />
groups. During the life of our Government the unsurpassed skill of<br />
the Australian agriculturalist, backed by his scientific and technical<br />
0 advisers, has raised agricultural output by nearly half with<br />
practically no addition whatever to the rural workforce,<br />
The average Australian farrier produces twice as much food<br />
as his counterparts in the United States and the United Kingdom. But<br />
this very efficiency in production does reveal that the land<br />
industries are not the place where new jobs can be found for the<br />
millions. But there must be jobs, and factories and service industries<br />
must provide them* I have been pointing this out for years,<br />
Manufacturing industries need adequate policies of tariff<br />
protection. There's evidence that that has been sustained for today<br />
there are 41/ 1 more factories in Australia than when we ca-lue to power,<br />
and the value of factory production is running at a rate 31 times<br />
greater than it was 12 years ago, and there are about three quarters<br />
of a million more jobs* </p>
<p>Incidentally increased employment in secondary activities<br />
increases the farmers best market the home market.<br />
Australia's rate of industrial expansion is phenomenal.<br />
My colleagues and I have worked without stint for 12 years to bring<br />
about a balanced development and a secure Australia. Tell not let up.<br />
As a by-product of our growth, and economic and political<br />
stabilityg industrialists throughout the Free World are increasingly<br />
coming to Australia as a new base for their operationso and so adding<br />
to the broadness of our industrial base and to the up-to-dateness of<br />
Wur technical skills, making new products we previously imported.<br />
Now our Government is putting it with ever increasing<br />
Sirectness to manufacturers, that they must also export to contribute<br />
to the nation's economic needs as well as to their own.<br />
Last year we faced a real problem. There was concentration<br />
upon speculative and non-essential activity with offers of very high<br />
interest rates, inflation of costs and values a threat to our stable<br />
* and solid base for expansion.<br />
Over a period our export prices had been declining. If last<br />
0year there had been the 1953 level of prices, the greatly increased<br />
quantity of our exports would have earned us Å 400 million more than we<br />
actually received. That in a nutshell is the situation which led us last year<br />
to introduce the economic policies which have been distasteful, and<br />
let me be frank. hurtful to many. But today we're confident that<br />
these inflationary and speculative pressures at home have been arrested.<br />
A policy about expanding Australia would be empty and<br />
meaningless words without an assurance that sufficient overseas funds<br />
will be earned to provide the import needs of Australian factories. </p>
<p>6-.<br />
This is essential for maximum employment. Without it migration could<br />
not be sustained. This is why we had to act last year to curb<br />
speculative spending and at the same time we've worked tirelessly to<br />
offset low prices for primary products.<br />
Take examples the Japanese Treaty has contributed<br />
enormously to holding wool prices, and wie stand ready to discuss with<br />
the wool industry its desires for the future as soon as the results<br />
of the present enquiry have been studied by the industry and the<br />
Government. The wheat industry has been protected by the Stabilisation<br />
Plan, fair prices at home and overseas negotiations.<br />
0 For the dairy industry, its Stabilisation Plan, with<br />
Government subsidising both the industry and the consumer at home, and<br />
* the Goverument doing all possible to sell to best advantage overseas.<br />
Both the wheat and the dairy plans will ba renewed as they<br />
expire, but after consultation with the industries and the State<br />
Governments. The sugar industry is sustained by a fair home price and<br />
overseas agreements. Indirectly the groat canned fruit industry is<br />
protected by an arrangement with the sugar industry.<br />
Beef producers have eivjoyed high local prices through<br />
the support of the Long Term Mcat Agreement and the negotiated entry<br />
to the United States high price market. The benefits of Government<br />
help as mentioned have been worth scores of millions of pounds in<br />
each case to the wool industry, to the dairy industry, and to the<br />
beef industry. Under our policies Tobacco growing has been raised to an<br />
important and profitable industry, with the result of very fast<br />
expansion in recent years.<br />
This year much leaf has not been bought at the auctions.<br />
We will work with the Industry to ensure that there is established<br />
a market at fair prices to growers for leaf acceptable to Australian<br />
. smokers. Many other crops tobacco, peanuts, cotton, fresh<br />
fruit, deserve and have received our consideration as has of course,<br />
the dried fruit industry. All contribute valuably to production,<br />
save imports, and provide employment. </p>
<p>In these fields particularly our fellow New Australians<br />
are demonstrating their skills and willingness to work hard.<br />
FTUR1E OBJECTIMES. ? Te aim to continue in the future what we've done in the<br />
past to support the rural industries and I include mining.<br />
The special tax depreciation allowvances for rural<br />
industries will be renewed by our Government for a further period*<br />
We've established the Development Bank, Today it has<br />
resources of capital and money borrowed for re-lending totalling<br />
* about Å-50 million. It will be quite especially the job of' the Country<br />
Party to see that this great new institution will be kept in necessary<br />
funds to enable it to function.<br />
The Country Party is.. pledged to-mnaintain-and-s-pport the<br />
interests of country people and it is pledged to do this for no<br />
narrow sectional reason. It's pledged to do it because the prosperity<br />
and expansion of the farma sector forms the very basis of national<br />
prosperity and expansion.<br />
We'll maintain the concept of partnership with both<br />
primary and secondary industry in export development.<br />
Our Trade Comissioner Service is being expanded<br />
continuously, Government funds to support overseas trade publicity are<br />
at record levels@ Of major importance it'll be my job to press negotiations<br />
with overseas countries to help our trade. Here, I think it is not<br />
unfair to recall that every Labor spokesman in the Federal<br />
Parliament spoke against the Japanese Trade Treaty, But this Treaty<br />
has proved of monumental importance in supporting our exports, as<br />
well as improving relations between the Australian and Japanese<br />
peoples and Governments. </p>
<p>.8.<br />
Anclthe-safeguards provided to protect Australian<br />
manufacturing industry against Japanese competition have proved to be<br />
adequate. Such a major departure from previous pnlicy as the<br />
concluding of the great Treaty with Japan cannot be undertaken by<br />
people devoted to narrow sectional interests. Only a Government such<br />
as ours will, strike out boldly and think in terms of' a new departure<br />
when circumstances demand its<br />
Efficient Australian agriculture doesn't carry a<br />
* workforce of millions. For millions of jobs to sustain our migration<br />
as well as for the young people growing up, manufacturing activity in<br />
Australia must be strong and expanding, We will prAvide adoquate<br />
0protection for it. Last year our Government supplemented the well tried<br />
Tariff Board system with the new arrangement enabling a temporary<br />
tariff to be proclaimed after 30 dayst enquiry.<br />
Already important industries, such for example as the<br />
WBruck Mills at' Wangaratta, have enjoyed the protection of this.<br />
The great consultative bodies on e~ or and<br />
W cur established by our Government provide a meeting point<br />
where Government, manufacturers and farmers are constantly sitting<br />
around the same table joining in planning the best for our country.<br />
To encourage export, novel taxation incentives have<br />
been devised. Under them, the cost of searching for and deveoping<br />
a market overseas is predominantly borne by the Government. Success<br />
in achieving increased exports to a certain formula brings a reward<br />
ef complete freedom from all pay roll tax liability. </p>
<p>.9.<br />
Recently I announced that we'd successfully negotiated<br />
the establishment of' two new shipping services to South America.<br />
We believe we will feel justified in supporting the<br />
establishment of warehouses to carry Auistralian goods for sale, in a<br />
number of important centres around tho world,<br />
' Ae look to the steel industry to become a more important<br />
and continuous export earners And our decision to reconstruct the<br />
railway line from the great iron ore deposits near Kalgoorlie to<br />
Fremantle is related to this.<br />
Likewise, having found enormous mnarkets for Australian coal<br />
in Japan, we're now as a Goverment financially helping the ' State<br />
Governments of New South W'ales and Queensland to improve harbours and<br />
port facilities* In the same line of thinking wetve undertaken to aid the<br />
construction of important roads right across North Australia so that<br />
beef cattle may be brought economically to the meatworks on the coast<br />
or to the fattening areas.<br />
My own Country Party has long advocated decentralisation.<br />
I'm in no doubt that if in appropriate areas New States were brought<br />
into existence, this would represent a major contribution to<br />
decentralisation. WAe believe decentralisation to be good, and safer,<br />
for the whole country and we'd like to see the family growing up in<br />
the country to be able to stay together by being able to find jobs in<br />
the country towns and its industries.<br />
COMMONMAKT But whether we live in the town or the country there's<br />
one recent development which must deeply concern all of us.<br />
Three months ago the United Kingdom decided to apply to<br />
join the European Common Market., If she does join it, it'll be one<br />
of the great events of history. Her action projects an absolutely / 10.0 </p>
<p>.11.<br />
economy. And I put it to you that matters of such complexity and<br />
importance affecting the future prosperity of everyone of us, can<br />
best be handled by a Government as broadly representative and<br />
as balanced in its interests as the present coalition between<br />
the Liberal and the Country Parties.<br />
Tonight Itm giving an account of 12 yearst work, of<br />
the phenomenal growth of our country in that period.<br />
It's the story mf transformation into a modern nation.<br />
The transformation from long years of slow population increase<br />
into a dramatic period of population growth. The transformation<br />
of rural industries from conditions where so often they provided<br />
only a precarious livelihood into a situation of Prosperity and<br />
stability with amazing advances in productive capacity.<br />
Today 72% of the people are voluntary subscribers<br />
to a national health scheme. In 1949 Government funds DrAvided<br />
fÅ 300,000 worth of life saving drugs and pharmiaceutical benefits.<br />
And last year under our Government Å-28 million was provided for<br />
this purpose. This is the story of the transformation of a country<br />
where there used to be continuous tension between Government and<br />
industry into one where a new concept of partnership has been<br />
deliberately developed and is operating.<br />
The transformation of a country ridden by Socialism<br />
into a country where people are free to shape their own way of<br />
life with the broad aid of Government not under the tight<br />
control of Government, This has had results. Australians now own the<br />
biggest proportion of homes to population in the world<br />
of the nationts families are home owners. Our Government<br />
has provided Å C780 million for housing./ 1. </p>
<p>.12.<br />
We've seen the transformation from a Federation where in<br />
1949 the State Governments were allotted Å-208 million from<br />
Commonwealth revenue and Commonwealth Loans that year, to the<br />
current position where last year they received Å 5 93 million.<br />
And Australia is now the tenth greatest trading nation in<br />
the world, and the Australian voice is heard, and increasingly<br />
heeded, in the world's highest Councils.<br />
Ours is a country where savings bank deposits have more<br />
than doubled; where the production of steel has more than trebled;<br />
where wool production has increased by 50%. It's a country whose<br />
motor car ownership has been extended from 1 car to every 7 people<br />
12 years ago to today 2 cars for each 7 people. Where television,<br />
under plans already approved, will in a few years' time be acCcsible<br />
to more than 90% of our people. Where aged and invalid pensions<br />
and other social services are provided, not at the yearly rate of<br />
million as in 1949 but at the present rate of Å 358 million a<br />
year. The 1950ts have been for Australia a great and historic<br />
period of unbelievable growth and prosperity.<br />
For the Liberal-Country Party Government, the 1950' s<br />
have been a period of remarkable achievement. We are fully<br />
confident that this perofrmance will be equalled during the 1960' s.<br />
By adhering to some general policies which produced the dramatic<br />
expansion of the 1950' s I believe that by 1970 our population<br />
will increase by another 2 million people, to give us about 12jmillion<br />
Australians. I foresee then another million jobs<br />
million Jobs by 1970. An increase in private investment by<br />
about a third to a level of Å-2,000 million a year.<br />
I see an increase in rural production taken at today's<br />
values of from Å C1350 million worth to Å C1600 million worth by 1970.<br />
I can see the value of work done in our factories increased by<br />
and I predict a rise of two-thirds in the value of our<br />
mineral exports. / 13-. </p>
<p>.13.<br />
What is our policy, you ask?, That is our policy.<br />
It will produce results like that. It's there to be seen; to be<br />
felt; to be experienced. It's not a policy of small devices. It's<br />
a policy of broadq imaginative thinking not one to favour a section<br />
at the expense of others* A policy to serve and benefit equally<br />
and I repeat equally the whole nation. A policy of broad national<br />
co-operation such as can only be achieved by a partnership in<br />
Governmentt of parties representing every section of the community.<br />
It's not a policy which has a beginning and an end. Itts a policy<br />
which has no end, for there will be no end to our planning and our<br />
work to develop this wonderful country of ours and keep its people<br />
* free, prosperous and happy.<br />
We really are working to try to shape Australia as we<br />
* believe the Australian people want it shaped. Wetre certain the<br />
prosperity and growth of Australia is inseparable from the stability<br />
of the country industries. So we're sure that the Country Party will<br />
continue to make its full contribution to the continuing success of<br />
our Government and to the welfare of all Australians, no matter who<br />
0 they are; whether they live in the town or the city; or work on a<br />
farm or in a factory.<br />
All I ask now is that you give our Government and the<br />
Country Party the opportunity to continue to make our contribution<br />
in our day to the security, health, happiness, and prosperity of all<br />
Australians new and old, </p>
<p>.14.<br />
For the continued development and prosperity<br />
of a free Australian people, we ask you to return our Government<br />
to office. For the House of Representatives vote for Government<br />
candidates the Country Party and Liberal Party candidates.<br />
Do not forget the importance of the Senate on<br />
this occasion. We must have a majority there to be really in power.<br />
Vote for the Senate candidates of the Country<br />
Party and the Liberal Party who stand as Government supporters. </p>
