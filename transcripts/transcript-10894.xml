<p>Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen. His Grace, the Archbishop of</p>
<p>   Melbourne, said that God had had a pretty good Convention. Can I</p>
<p>   say that, without in any way wishing to belittle the Almighty's</p>
<p>   success, can I say that I think Australia has had an even better</p>
<p>   one. I think what this Convention has demonstrated is the truth</p>
<p>   of a proposition that I have always held very dear and that is the</p>
<p>   things that unite us as Australians are greater than the things</p>
<p>   that divide us.</p>
<p>I ask myself what have I learnt out of this last two weeks? I have</p>
<p>   learnt something that I wasn't so sure of at the beginning,</p>
<p>   and that is that I have no doubt that Australia can conduct a referendum</p>
<p>   on this issue with vigour, with passion and with meaning and yet</p>
<p>   in a way that doesn't undermine or fracture the essential values</p>
<p>   of our society.</p>
<p>I have learnt out of this Convention that this Australian way we</p>
<p>   have of doing things is special and is unique. I haven't experienced</p>
<p>   anything like this in all the years I have been in public life.</p>
<p>   The bringing together of so many people in different ways, with</p>
<p>   different backgrounds, with different contributions, with different</p>
<p>   views was something that at the beginning one might have thought</p>
<p>   was fraught with danger, that anything could have happened, that</p>
<p>   anything could have emerged.</p>
<p>In terms of the positions that were taken I suppose at various</p>
<p>   stages, that appeared possible. But in a great display of civility</p>
<p>   and good humour and with great integrity in many areas, it was possible</p>
<p>   for us to really let out what has been a moment in Australia's</p>
<p>   history and a moment that I am sure that everybody has treasured.</p>
<p>I have been a Member of this Federal Parliament now since May of</p>
<p>   1974 and I have been immensely privileged to come to the highest-elected</p>
<p>   position in this country and to be given the greatest honour that</p>
<p>   can ever become the lot of any Australian man or woman and that</p>
<p>   is to be the Prime Minister of our wonderful country.</p>
<p>I would have thought therefore that the sense of excitement and</p>
<p>   exhilaration is something that I had enjoyed it all. But there was</p>
<p>   something about this gathering and the look on peoples faces, and</p>
<p>   I share Geoffrey Blainey's response to the look on the faces</p>
<p>   of those like Malcolm Turnbull and Neville Wran and Janet Holmes</p>
<p>   a Court, not people who on this issue I identified with very closely,</p>
<p>   but obviously you have an enormous enthusiasm for it and felt a</p>
<p>   sense of exhilaration and happiness that what they had worked to</p>
<p>   achieve had in fact been achieved.</p>
<p>Could I also pay particular tribute to Lloyd Waddy and to Kerry</p>
<p>   Jones as the leaders of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy.</p>
<p>   I know the difficulties that they have endured in putting forward</p>
<p>   a cause which, for a long time, received very little support or</p>
<p>   recognition in commentaries on this issue. I know their lack of</p>
<p>   resources. I know what was said and suggested at the beginning about</p>
<p>   their propensity to strategically vote. I salute their immense integrity</p>
<p>   in the way in which they have handled themselves throughout this</p>
<p>   entire debate.</p>
<p>The reason that this has been a success and the reason why it has</p>
<p>   captured to a very significant degree the interest and the imagination</p>
<p>   of the Australian people, is that despite our differences we all</p>
<p>   smell the same Eucalypt, we all know the same dust and we all feel</p>
<p>   the same salt in the same ocean. And, of course, those things that</p>
<p>   are dear to one side of the argument are equally dear to others.</p>
<p>And what has struck me more than anything else about this whole</p>
<p>   Convention and about the whole debate is the integrity of the Australianism</p>
<p>   that has been expressed by all of the delegates. And I will go away</p>
<p>   from this Convention an even more idealistic Australian, one with</p>
<p>   an even greater passion to allow our democracy to flourish. We will</p>
<p>   have a vote next year. The Australian people will decide the outcome</p>
<p>   of that. And we will all accept the verdict of the Australian people</p>
<p>   with grace and goodwill, all of us, whatever the result may be.</p>
<p>Can I say that it was always my fervent wish that this issue could</p>
<p>   be resolved in the sense of it not being on the agenda when we celebrated</p>
<p>   the Centenary of our Federation. If Australia is to become a republic,</p>
<p>   it ought to be become a republic on the 1st of January 2001. If</p>
<p>   Australia is not to become a republic at that time, let it be off</p>
<p>   the agenda for the celebration of the Centenary of our Federation</p>
<p>   so that we can share together the jubilation and the gratitude and</p>
<p>   the affection that we feel for what this country has meant to us</p>
<p>   over the last 100 years.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean to say that the issue, if it is rejected</p>
<p>   next year, will not necessarily return. It is in the nature of a</p>
<p>   democracy that is always open to the people. But the celebration</p>
<p>   of 100 years of the Australian nation, with all its achievement</p>
<p>   and acknowledging all of its blemishes. And can I say on that point,</p>
<p>   that one of the things which has enriched this Convention has been</p>
<p>   the contribution of the representatives of the first Australians,</p>
<p>   the Indigenous people.</p>
<p>And I hope in a small way, to you Lois and Gatjil and Nova, and</p>
<p>   to Pat and George and to Neville, I am sorry, and to David, I hope</p>
<p>   that is in some way a sign and a signal from all of us that you</p>
<p>   do occupy a very special place in our community. </p>
<p>I think we can look forward, with great hope and in a very positive</p>
<p>   way, to the conduct of this referendum. This Convention has spoken</p>
<p>   very clearly. It will be the intention of my Government, if it is</p>
<p>   returned at the next election, to hold the referendum before the</p>
<p>   end of 1999. In the meantime, in the nature of things, other issues</p>
<p>   will flood back to the stage of public debate and I imagine that</p>
<p>   there will be a period in which the debate on this issue might go</p>
<p>   slightly on to the backburner, particularly so far as some of the</p>
<p>   more active political players are concerned. But that, once again,</p>
<p>   is in the hands of the Australian public. </p>
<p>We won't back track on the commitments that we have given</p>
<p>   and I have given in the name of my Government. I said before the</p>
<p>   last election that we would have a Convention. I promised the Australian</p>
<p>   people a vote before the year 2000. I said at the opening of this</p>
<p>   Convention that if a clear view emerged about a republican model</p>
<p>   the Australian people would have a referendum. I repeat my promise</p>
<p>   that that is what will occur. I repeat again that my Government,</p>
<p>   the members of the Liberal Party of Australia and therefore in practice,</p>
<p>   the members of my Government, will be allowed an open or a free</p>
<p>   vote during that election campaign.</p>
<p>I am proud of the fact that my Party, the Liberal Party of Australia,</p>
<p>   allowed a conscience vote on this issue. I don't say that to</p>
<p>   criticise the other Party, I simply say it as a mark of the maturity</p>
<p>   of my Party that we did that. This is an issue that is </p>
<p>a-typical, that is different. It doesn't follow the normal</p>
<p>   conventions and cannons of political behaviour and I am very proud</p>
<p>   of the Liberal Party being mature enough and strong enough to allow</p>
<p>   people an open and free vote on this issue.</p>
<p>I want to say to you, Ian, that you have adorned the proceedings</p>
<p>   of this Convention in a way that has won everybody's admiration.</p>
<p>   There is nobody and I say nobody - and I am not normally noted for</p>
<p>   modesty on these things - in this room, whose parliamentary skills</p>
<p>   and whose management skills, in a Chamber such as this, are as consummate</p>
<p>   as yours, Ian, and you have demonstrated that.</p>
<p>And to you Barry, you brought with your particular role, as National</p>
<p>   President of the Australian Labor Party, but also because of who</p>
<p>   you are and the character that you are and what you mean to many</p>
<p>   people in Australia, you brought an added quality as Deputy Chairman</p>
<p>   of the proceedings. And I also salute, very warmly, the contribution</p>
<p>   that you have made.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Nick Minchin, in particular, who has carried</p>
<p>   the ministerial burden. Nick has got two specific responsibilities</p>
<p>   in my Government, and many others, but the two he has got have been</p>
<p>   fairly lively of late. One has been the Constitutional Convention</p>
<p>   and the other has been native title and he has worked very hard</p>
<p>   and he has been a great source of support and strength to me, in</p>
<p>   this. And I would also like to thank on my own personal staff, Catherine</p>
<p>   Murphy, who has been of particular help to me and to Nick, and who</p>
<p>   has kept me informed.</p>
<p>Can I join in thanking the Secretariat and in particular, Bill</p>
<p>   Blick from my Department who has headed up the Secretariat. And</p>
<p>   to Lyn Barlin, whose work as Clerk I admired immensely, and I am</p>
<p>   delighted that he has been able to help us out.</p>
<p>There is not a lot more I can say. I am really so happy that we've</p>
<p>   been able to hold something so different, so special and that we've</p>
<p>   come through it better Australians. We are all the happier for the</p>
<p>   experience. The memories that I will take away from this include</p>
<p>   the lovely Grace sung last night by George and his wife, which was</p>
<p>   a beautiful touch and a reminder of the special diversity of our</p>
<p>   country. </p>
<p>The immense intelligence and dignity and bearing of the younger</p>
<p>   delegates to the Convention with their variety of views. But not</p>
<p>   to forget the age cohorts at the other end of the range were also</p>
<p>   very well represented and their contribution was considerable and</p>
<p>   we are greatly in their debt.</p>
<p>It has been a very special experience. I have loved every minute</p>
<p>   of it. I feel privileged to have been the Prime Minister who brought</p>
<p>   it about and I think it has brought us all together as Australians,</p>
<p>   whatever the outcome referendum may be, in a very, very special</p>
<p>   way. Thank you very, very much.</p>
