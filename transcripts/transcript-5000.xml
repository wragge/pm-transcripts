PRIME~ MINISTER; 2<br />
FOR PRESS 26 MARCH 1979<br />
SILVER JUBILEE<br />
OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCE<br />
It is a great pleasure to be with you today, the occasion of<br />
the Silver Jubilee of the Australian Academy of Science.<br />
The Jubilee comes at a critical time. The world is in the<br />
midst of a scientific revolution, a revolution which is<br />
changing the organisation of society as profoundly as the<br />
industrial revolution changed the world which preceded it.<br />
The pessimists see science and technology as juggernauts out<br />
of control. The optimists look forward to an age of well-being<br />
unprecedented in human history. Proper understanding by the<br />
community of science and technology is essential if we are to<br />
make the most of this revolution.<br />
Organised bodies of scientists, like the Australian Academy of<br />
Science, therefore have special responsibilities not only for<br />
the promotion of excellence in science, but for promotion of<br />
scientific understanding in the community at large.<br />
The. Academy, which was founded in 1954 with the support of the Commonwealth<br />
Government, under Sir Robert Menzies, has accepted a number of responsibilities<br />
on behalf,* of scientists and science in Australia. The Academy's charter,<br />
confered by Queen Elizabeth, laid down the major formal responsibilities for<br />
the Academy, which were " to promote, declare and disseminate<br />
scientific knowledge, to establish and maintain standards of<br />
scientific endeavour and achievement..".<br />
These Jubilee celebrations are a reaffirmation of its dedication<br />
to these responsibilities, and a time to look back on the<br />
Academy's 25 years of achievements. They are also a time to<br />
pause and look ahead towards the next 25 years and the role of<br />
such an Academy in those promising but difficult times.<br />
The Academy has met its obligations well. It has acted as the<br />
able representative of Australian science in international<br />
affairs and has promoted bilateral exchanges, notably with<br />
the People's Republic of China. It has brought many overseas<br />
scientists to Australia, particularly by its organisation of<br />
international conferences. It has participated in events like<br />
the International Geophysical Year, and supported the proposal<br />
for a large optical telescope in Australia, which led eventually<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
to the Anglo-Australian agreement to jointly build and operate<br />
a 3.9 metre telescope. It has interpreted the promotion of<br />
scientific knowledge, not only in relation to scientific<br />
excellence in the narrow technical sense but in the wider<br />
community sense. It has conducted, and published, inquiries<br />
concerned with topics as diverse as hydrology, Antarctic<br />
research, solar energy, fats in the diet, national parks,<br />
climatic change, and the quality of the environment.<br />
The Academy has conducted national workshops, and has standing<br />
committees in areas both of scientific and public interest. It<br />
has made submissions to Government inquiries and provided<br />
technical advice. The discussions which ultimately led to<br />
the Australian Science and Technology Council were initiated<br />
by the Academy in 1967 with a report entitled " Science Policy<br />
Machinery in Australia", and ASTEC is now headed by a former<br />
President of the Academy, Professor Geoffrey Badger.<br />
In this age of great opportunity and of challenge for the,<br />
world and for Australia we must be in the forefront of acquiring<br />
scientific knowledge and converting this knowledge to practical<br />
effect. our scientists have made outstanding contributions to their<br />
discipline. The quality of Australian science stands high on<br />
any measure, whether it be the prizes and honours conferred,<br />
the scientific outputs, the reputations and prestige of our<br />
research institutes and research schools. But we need to do more<br />
to match this record with success in the application of<br />
our scientific knowledge. Sometimes our scientists, our<br />
technologists, our businessmen, do not communicate and build<br />
on each other's talents as much as we would have hoped.<br />
The recent ASTEC Report " Science and Technology in Australia, 1977-78"<br />
for instance, suggests that we could have done more to capitalise<br />
on the output of Australian research and use the results as<br />
the basis for technological innovations in our industries.<br />
The Government would like to see Australia's scientists improve<br />
their links with the rest of the Australian community. Close<br />
contact should be established between Government departments,<br />
research institutions, industry and the academic world.<br />
My Government's strategy has been designed to achieve this, and<br />
we have instituted a permanent Australian Science and Technology<br />
Council, a comprehensive review of the CSIRO, and a number of<br />
other measures such as our programmes to determine the most<br />
effective means of obtaining the benefits of new technology.<br />
The Academy has, for its part, been promoting the applications of<br />
science in industry through its standing committee, the" Science<br />
and Industry Forum". The Forum is valuable, not only for its<br />
inquiries and published reports, but because it brings together<br />
scientists, technologists and managers to exchange points of view.<br />
Understanding the changes which science may bring about requires<br />
education at various levels and the Academy has given attention<br />
to this important aspect of science. </p>
<p>3<br />
The activities associated with the Jubilee provide a picture<br />
of some of the more general ways which the community can gain<br />
an understanding of scientific developments. They include<br />
sponsorship of a school science exhibition, and an essay<br />
competition on " science and society", public lectures on topics<br />
like technology and employment, and conservation, a young people's<br />
symposium, the showing of scientific films, and the admirable<br />
exhibition in this building. They are to be followed by a series<br />
of scientific symposia intended to make use of the Academy's<br />
broad representation over the whole of science. Shortly,<br />
with the close co-operation of the sister academies of technology<br />
and of the social sciences a two-day workshop " Science and<br />
Technology for Development" will be held.<br />
The Academy, over the last 25 years, has most creditably acquitted<br />
its responsibilities and has made important contributions to<br />
national goals and aspirations. What of the next 25 years?<br />
The distinguished scientists who are members of the Academy<br />
must continue with their special role in the development of<br />
Australia. They have a role in stimulating scientific<br />
discoveries and a role in continuing to bring science to the<br />
Australian people.<br />
The Academy is also well placed to make a major contribution in<br />
advising the Government, for example, by contributing to the<br />
Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia, which<br />
is being chaired by Professor Rupert Myers. Although partly<br />
supported by a Government grant the Academy is an independent body.<br />
In a democracy such as ours, there is always a need for<br />
independent identification and investigation of problems.<br />
Independence ensures that the Academy will put forward considered,<br />
constructive advice and the Government looks forward to<br />
the future contributions by the Academy.<br />
I hope that the Academy will continue to interpret its Charter<br />
very broadly, to the advantage both of science in Australia<br />
and the whole Australian community. I congratulate the<br />
Academy on its past record and wish it well for the<br />
next 25 years. 000---</p>
