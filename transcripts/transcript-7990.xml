TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW, SYDNEY WITH MIKE GIBSON,<br />
CHANNEL 10, SYDNEY, 22 MARCH 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
GIBSON: Welcome back. In two days time the Federal<br />
elections of 1990 will be over and with me, the man who<br />
may well be Labor Prime Minister for a record fourth<br />
term, Mr Hawke, good evening.<br />
PM: Thanks Mike.<br />
GIBSON: A couple of days to go, how do you feel?<br />
PM: I feel good, Mike. I feel well and I feel relaxed,<br />
not cocky or complacent but I believe I've given it my<br />
best shot and I hope I've done what the people want me to<br />
do, that's two things, to talk about my policies and<br />
explain what I think the weaknesses are on the other<br />
side.<br />
GIBSON: You're a lot more relaxed than you seemed to be<br />
when you kicked off.<br />
PM: Well I was relaxed at the beginning. I think I<br />
remember that people tried to run a story about the fact<br />
that I complained about a whole lot of microphones on a<br />
podium as though that was some real issue. They just<br />
misunderstood it completely. I was very relaxed and<br />
joking with people about that but apart from that I don't<br />
think there's been any real hiccups. I've felt good.<br />
GIBSON: Andrew Peacock was very relaxed earlier on.<br />
He's looking lately, particularly that outburst with<br />
Paul Kelly the other day. </p>
<p>PM: Well it wasn't good. I think we've had a paradox in<br />
this campaign. The Liberals started off, the whole<br />
concept has been there are questions that must be<br />
answered. But the whole campaign has been a<br />
contradiction when he with me in the debate he<br />
couldn't ask me any questions and he spent the whole of<br />
the campaign dodging the Press in terms of facing up to<br />
the questions they want to ask. I don't think that's<br />
wise on their part. I mean if they really say they've<br />
got the answers then he should be prepared to face up to<br />
questions from the people who are there on behalf of the<br />
Australian people to ask those questions.<br />
GIBSON: You've had a few Liberal adversaries now, John<br />
Howard and going back to Malcolm Fraser. How does Andrew<br />
shape up against those two?<br />
PM: I think you'll agree that in this campaign I haven't<br />
got into personalities against Peacock. I've tried as<br />
hard as I can to concentrate on the issues.<br />
GIBSON: Would you like to have?<br />
PM: No. I don't like it. I'd rather talk about issues<br />
but let me say this. The comparison, of course,<br />
Fraser and Howard, I've got to say that I think honestly<br />
that both Mr Fraser and Mr Howard applied themselves much<br />
more vigorously to getting on top of economic matters.<br />
Whether you agreed with Malcolm Fraser, which I didn't,<br />
or John Howard, which I didn't basically on their concept<br />
of the Australian economy of what should be done, at<br />
least they did work. They could talk about it and<br />
respond to questions put to them in a way which revealed<br />
that they knew what they were talking about, even if you<br />
didn't agree with their final judgement. Andrew<br />
Peacock's been in public life for over a generation. He<br />
was Shadow Treasurer when he was there before he knocked<br />
Mr Howard off again and he quite clearly hasn't applied<br />
himself to understanding the fundamentals about the<br />
Australian economy and that's the difference I find<br />
between Mr Peacock and his two predecessors.<br />
GIBSON: You became Prime Minister fairly quickly. Has<br />
it been all you expected?<br />
PM: Just about. I think the one thing, Mike, that's<br />
been a little bit different is I hadn't really<br />
appreciated the way in which it's virtually impossible to<br />
have a private life and I don't complain about that. I<br />
think that this is the greatest country in the world and<br />
to be its leader is just an indescribable honour. It<br />
does mean that particularly if you're serious about the<br />
job, that you've virtually got no private life, had to<br />
realise just how much that was true but that's not a<br />
complaint. GIBSON: Has it changed you at all, the job? </p>
<p>3.<br />
PM: Yes, it's made me a lot wiser. I mean I work very<br />
hard. I read an enormous amount of information which I'm<br />
privileged to get about our own economy, about our own<br />
society and particularly also about world events and our<br />
regional events and I'm just very much better informed<br />
and a wiser person than I was when I became Prime<br />
Minister. GIBSON: Whatever the outcome Saturday, I guess the one<br />
certainty would seem to be that we're going to get a<br />
record number of people voting for the alternative<br />
parties. What's that say about you guys?<br />
PM: Well I think the major element that it says is about<br />
the world. I mean if you wanted to look at the world<br />
over the last five to ten years, the most striking<br />
feature Mike, has been the rapid increase in interest in<br />
the environment. It goes right across age barriers, it<br />
goes right across income barriers, right across social<br />
barriers and in Australia it's true too of people, more<br />
people saying our major interest is the environment and<br />
they are going to cast a lot of primary votes for the<br />
Democrats or Green candidates because they want to say<br />
that's the issue which mainly concerns them. Now my<br />
responsibility is to say to them if you're really are<br />
concerned about the environment your first vote but<br />
on the 25th its either going to be Bob Hawke or Andrew<br />
Peacock and Bob Hawke's record on the environment leaves<br />
Peacock and the National Party for dead. I mean we've<br />
saved the Franklin. The Liberals and the National Party<br />
opposed. I saved the Daintree Rainforest from logging.<br />
They opposed that. I saved the Kakadu from mining. They<br />
opposed it. I saved the Tall Forests of Tasmania. They<br />
opposed it. So these people that are going to be voting<br />
one environment as it were, they must cast their second<br />
preference for Labor.<br />
GIBSON: Are these the people who in fact are going to<br />
get you in though, I mean these preferences.<br />
PM: Well, I think preferences are going to be important.<br />
I mean we're going to get a lot of primary votes, yes,<br />
preferences are going to be important, Mike.<br />
GIBSON: How are you going to sleep tomorrow night. I<br />
mean I know I'd have a few beers on the eve of a big one.<br />
You don't do that anymore.<br />
PM: No, I haven't had a drink for a decade but I sleep<br />
well, I mean once my head hits the pillow I go to sleep.<br />
GIBSON: And then once this minor interruption's over you<br />
go on with the more serious business of<br />
PM: Well, I must say that during the campaign I haven't<br />
been able to think on Saturdays about the horses in the<br />
way I normally do. I try and put a couple of hours in on<br />
a Friday night but I've certainly been interrupted. </p>
<p>GIBSON: Before we go, on a sporting note you've had<br />
quite a victory today with Greg Norman?<br />
PM: Well Greg, talking about Greg, he's a mate of mine<br />
but more importantly than that he's a great Australian.<br />
He really is a great Australian, he loves this country<br />
and he willingly agreed, proudly agreed, to provide his<br />
services free and you know what fee he could command if<br />
he wanted to. He's agreed to provide his services to<br />
Australia through the Australian Tourist Commission to<br />
promote Australia as a tourist destination overseas and<br />
you know I just, I love him for it.<br />
GIBSON: These last minute polls, any butterflies for<br />
you? PM: No, this last minute poll shows us winning closely<br />
but I do not think about polls even if they, as they all<br />
do, basically show us winning. I don't take anything for<br />
granted and I'll be working right up until tomorrow night<br />
and then rely on the good sense of the Australian people.<br />
GIBSON: Thanks for your time.<br />
PM: It's been a pleasure Mike, thank you.<br />
ends </p>
