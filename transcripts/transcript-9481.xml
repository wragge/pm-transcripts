ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
TO THE CHINESE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE " AUSTRALIA AND ASIA:<br />
THE NEXT STEPS", PERTH, WEDNESDAY, 15 FEBRUARY 1995<br />
It is a real pleasure to be at this coffee shop forum and to see so many<br />
people here.<br />
This is now a Perth institution. And I hope groups like it will soon be an<br />
Australian institution. Because all of you here are participants in a great and<br />
important enterprise the shaping of our involvement with Asia.<br />
I have said before that this engagement with Asia is not a take-it-or-leave-it<br />
affair for Australia. Asia is not a target of convenience for us. It is not a<br />
fashion, or a flavour-of-the-month, or a political gimmick.<br />
I have long believed that Australia's relationship with Asia has to lie at the<br />
very centre of our external interests.<br />
I am convinced that we came perilously close in the 1960s to marginalising<br />
ourselves in the world. The White Australia Policy and the barrier of<br />
protection and regulation behind which our industry and financial institutions<br />
slumbered were all of a piece. Both were the product of the same defensive<br />
and inward-looking cast of mind.<br />
Just in time, I believe, we saw the need to open ourselves out to the world, to<br />
break through all those protective barriers which held Australia's economy<br />
and our minds in check.<br />
A sea change has since taken place in the views of all sorts of Australians<br />
and I am very glad of it.<br />
It has been common in some quarters to hear Australia's interest in Asia<br />
portrayed as a simple example of economic determinism: the charge,<br />
crudely, that our policies have been foisted on us by the realities of our<br />
markets. </p>
<p>Of course it is true that our economic links with Asia are vital. The<br />
percentage of our exports going to Asia has risen from around one third in<br />
1965 to about 63 per cent in 1993. And Asia's importance to us will continue<br />
to grow.<br />
But it is a profound error to see that as the whole story. For me and for this<br />
government our interest in Asia has a much broader focus and a much wider<br />
purpose. Success in the efforts we make in Asia will affect not just Australia's<br />
prosperity but our security. As the Government's recent White Paper on<br />
defence made clear, strategic partnership with regional countries will be an<br />
increasingly important part of our security policy.<br />
And, more than that, closer engagement with Asia is already helping to<br />
transform Australian society: the face of our society, as anyone who has<br />
looked around the streets of our major cities knows. But also the heart of our<br />
society.<br />
Asian culture and Asian values will, in a very short time I believe, begin to<br />
work their impact on mainstream Australian culture just as earlier waves of<br />
European migration have done.<br />
It is not surprising that this Chamber, which is part of this whole process, has<br />
flourished here in Perth.<br />
On this side of the continent, more than almost anywhere else in Australia, a<br />
strong sense exists of Asia's proximity and its relevance.<br />
Western Australia has long provided the sinews of our great trading links with<br />
Japan and China. Over a quarter of our exports to Japan and more than<br />
per cent of our exports to China come from this state.<br />
And both Japan and China have major investments here, ranging from mining<br />
interests to food.<br />
We should never lose sight of the importance of our traditional commodity<br />
exports, but it is also important to keep the economic relationship moving into<br />
new areas.<br />
We need to continue the push into manufacturing exports, services, tourism<br />
and investments.<br />
But for success to come in these areas we will need to depend much more on<br />
personal contacts, on the creation of denser networks of contact across all<br />
areas of our society business, education, government, culture.<br />
The role of groups like yours will be critical to this process. </p>
<p>Your 450 members and supporters have already formed contacts with a<br />
whole network of Chinese Chambers of Commerce and business groups<br />
throughout Asia.<br />
You have taken business missions to Vietnam, Indonesia, Laos, Hong Kong<br />
and China and have hosted incoming groups from countries in the region.<br />
And in the long tradition of Chinese philanthropy you have also been trying to<br />
put something back into Australian society with your Foundation to support<br />
exchanges of junior executives in the region.<br />
In other words, your Chamber is an outstanding example of the advantage<br />
that cultural diversity gives Australia.<br />
It used to be argued that the appropriate image for Australia's policies<br />
towards newly arrived migrants was that of the melting pot, simmering away<br />
the differences of our ethnic communities until they became part of one great<br />
Australian soup.<br />
But if we need a culinary metaphor for Australia's approach to migrants in our<br />
society, a much better one is the Chinese wok, in which all the ingredients<br />
retain their own distinct identity but become part of a harmonious and<br />
balanced whole.<br />
Contemporary Australia thrives on difference. It imposes few conformities<br />
beyond the one that says the first loyalty of all Australians is to Australia and<br />
to its fundamental democratic values including, especially, tolerance.<br />
One of the most significant productivity reforms this country can make is to<br />
make full use of the knowledge and energy of all our ethnic communities.<br />
To take an example relevant to all of you in this room, the East Asia<br />
Analytical Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which the<br />
Government established to increase our store of expertise on Asia will soon<br />
be publishing a comprehensive report on Chinese business networks in Asia.<br />
The report will provide a compendium of information for Australian business<br />
people to help them use these networks to do business in China.<br />
The report points out that overseas Chinese are the largest source of<br />
investment in China. Around 98 per cent of all foreign investment in<br />
Guangdong province, for example, is from Chinese investors living overseas.<br />
Clearly, one of the best ways of getting into China is by having an overseas<br />
Chinese partner.<br />
I know your members have been involved in the preparation of this report and<br />
will recognise the sense of its conclusions.<br />
Groups like yours are critical to developing commercial relationships, and<br />
State Governments also play a complementary trade and cultural promotion </p>
<p>role. But in the end there are some things that only the Commonwealth<br />
Government can do and that it must do well if Australia's national interests<br />
are to be properly protected.<br />
It alone can establish the environment of trust with neighbouring governments<br />
within which business can flourish; it alone can create the structures which<br />
will support the development of a more prosperous, more secure region.<br />
And that task has been central to the Government's foreign policy efforts over<br />
the past couple of years. It has been a period as busy and productive as any<br />
Australia has experienced.<br />
I wanted to take the opportunity this evening to reflect on how far we have<br />
come over the past twelve months or so and to look ahead to the next stages.<br />
Because our agenda in Asia is far from finished.<br />
With the end of the Cold War, the structure of the international system has<br />
changed as profoundly as at any time in modern history. Technological<br />
developments, particularly with information and communications, have<br />
magnified the force of that change.<br />
And although the changes have been most immediately obvious in Europe,<br />
with the break-up of the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc, developments in<br />
Asia are in some ways more remarkable. The economic growth of Asia is one<br />
of the dominant themes of the late 20th century.<br />
In the twenty years from 1970, East Asia's share of world GDP rose from 12<br />
per cent to 25 per cent. It is inevitable that over time this economic shift will<br />
bring with it strategic changes as well.<br />
To take the most obvious examples: China's weight and influence in the<br />
world will inevitably increase; Japan will continue to seek a political influence<br />
more commensurate with its economic importance ( one reason we support its<br />
permanent membership of the UN Security Council); the inevitable<br />
reunification of Korea will change the political dynamics of Northeast Asia;<br />
and Vietnam's membership of ASEAN will just as significantly affect<br />
relationships in Southeast Asia.<br />
In these circumstances, it is vital that we have in place structures which give<br />
Australia and the region a sense of certainty, which keep countries talking<br />
about their common concerns, which provide a framework for the containment<br />
or management of tension.<br />
That is why I have placed such importance on APEC, which encompasses all<br />
the most important regional economic and trade links.<br />
And it is why I suggested in 1992 that we should give APEC a bit of<br />
horsepower by establishing meetings between the leaders of the APEC<br />
economies. </p>
<p>President Clinton took up this idea in Seattle in 1993 and then President<br />
Soeharto hosted a second meeting last November at which leaders of all<br />
eighteen APEC economies were present.<br />
That meeting at Bogor, and the visionary Declaration of Common Resolve<br />
which it produced, has permanently changed the nature of our region. It has<br />
cemented APEC's status as the key regional body and has ensured that we<br />
maintain a trans-Pacific approach to the region. This avoids the danger of<br />
the world dividing into three contending blocs in Europe, Asia and the<br />
Americas. The central element in the Bogor declaration is a firm commitment to free<br />
trade and investment in the region by 2010 for industrialised countries and<br />
2020 for developing countries. This will create a dynamic and integrated<br />
market of 2 billion people.<br />
The leaders' meeting also decided to expand the trade and investment<br />
facilitation program, on which a good deal of progress has already been<br />
made. This will become increasingly important as tariffs decline and services<br />
trade is liberalised.<br />
Also at the regional level, we began last year the process of discussing<br />
possible links between the ASEAN Free Trade Area and the Australia-New<br />
Zealand Closer Economic Relations arrangement, following a suggestion<br />
from the Thai Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Supachai, which I discussed during<br />
my visit to Thailand in April.<br />
In the security area, Australia has played an important role in the<br />
establishment of the ASEAN Regional Forum which held its first Ministerial<br />
meeting last year. The ARF engages the countries of the broader region for<br />
the first time ever in a dialogue about security issues.<br />
And we made similar progress in our bilateral relations with regional countries<br />
over the past twelve months.<br />
To take just a few examples.<br />
With China, in addition to a steady stream of high-level Ministerial visits, we<br />
had a visit in November from Mr Qiao Shi, the Chairman of the National<br />
People's Congress and the third most senior member of the Communist<br />
Party. In June, the largest ever Chinese trade and investment delegation<br />
came to Australia.<br />
Qiao Shi's remarks at the end of his visit that Australia-China relations have<br />
" extremely good potential" are ones I can only endorse. China is now our 6th<br />
largest trading partner and China has more foreign investment in Australia<br />
than in any other country. </p>
<p>Both Hong Kong and Taiwan, the other two Chinese economies represented<br />
in APEC, remain very important to Australia. Taiwan is our seventh largest<br />
trading partner and Hong Kong our tenth largest. The Government is<br />
committed to building our commercial relationship with both. The Australian<br />
Commerce and Industry Office in Taipei has been expanded and last year my<br />
colleague Michael Lee made an unofficial visit as Tourism Minister. Hong<br />
Kong will lose none of its importance to Australia after 1997.<br />
I visited Tokyo for the second time as Prime Minister in September last year.<br />
Japan remains, of course, overwhelmingly Australia's largest economic<br />
partner. I was struck by the fundamental nature of the political and economic<br />
change Japan is undergoing. As this change progresses, Australia's broad<br />
policy dialogue and partnership with Japan will become even more important<br />
to both of us.<br />
I have said before that there is no relationship more important to Australia<br />
than that with Indonesia.<br />
I visited Indonesia twice in 1994 and the Austral ia-I ndonesia Ministerial<br />
Forum, which President Soeharto and I established during my first visit to<br />
Jakarta, met for a second time.<br />
Our purpose with the Forum has been to broaden the relationship into new<br />
areas of activity.<br />
And it is quite clear that this is happening. In areas like energy, defence,<br />
education, health, trade unions, transport and communications, the<br />
environment, science and technology even sport we have never found so<br />
many areas for cooperation.<br />
Our trade has trebled over the past six years to more than $ 3 billion and we<br />
are one of the top ten investors in Indonesia. A number of West Australian<br />
companies Clough Engineering, the John Holland Group, Heytesbury<br />
Holdings, Environmental Solutions International are all major forces in the<br />
Indonesian market.<br />
The very successful Australia Today Indonesia ' 94 promotion, at which 200<br />
Australian companies and the West Australian Government were<br />
represented, was another step in broadening the relationship.<br />
We were also very glad to receive Vice President Try Sutrisno in Australia<br />
last September, the most senior Indonesian to visit Australia since President<br />
Soeharto in 1975.<br />
Our burgeoning relationship with the Republic of Korea reached a new high<br />
point with President Kim Young Sam's visit to Australia last November.<br />
Korea has just passed the United States to become Australia's secondlargest<br />
export market. </p>
<p>President Kim and I have been determined to find ways of consolidating and<br />
broadening this relationship.<br />
Among the outcomes of his visit were an agreement to establish a joint fund<br />
to support technology projects in areas such as the information superhighway<br />
and clean energy.<br />
We also agreed to upgrade science and technology cooperation and to hold<br />
a Ministerial-level symposium to look at long-term energy issues, one of the<br />
issues at the core of our relationship. We are also committed to building up<br />
people-to-people contact between Korea and Australia.<br />
The relationship with Singapore also made rapid progress last year. Prime<br />
Minister Goh visited Australia in September and I was able to meet him again<br />
at the APEC summit in Jakarta.<br />
We established during his visit here a high level Singapore-Australia<br />
Business Alliance Forum to assist business and investment in both countries<br />
and also in third markets.<br />
And both governments have put money into a fund to support feasibility<br />
studies for joint participation by our companies in third markets.<br />
Prime Minister Goh and I agreed to look at ways of further encouraging<br />
Singaporean investment in tourism especially ( and I was very pleased to<br />
support this) in providing opportunities for young Singaporeans to come to<br />
Australia. Already the number of nights spent by Singaporean visitors in<br />
Western Australia grew by 33 per cent in 1993-94.<br />
Links between Australia and Malaysia are also growing. Our two-way trade<br />
increased by 26 percent in 1993-94 to reach almost $ 3 billion. And our<br />
exports have been growing by an average of 17 per cent over each of the<br />
past five years.<br />
One of the particular strengths of our relationship has always been in<br />
education. More than 100,000 Malaysians have been educated here no<br />
doubt some of them are in this room tonight and this provides a broad base<br />
of understanding and goodwill which is unique in our regional relationships.<br />
Malaysian companies, including the Malaysian Mining Corporation, are active<br />
players in the Western Australian economy.<br />
And local companies such as SBF Shipbuilders, John Holland and high-tech<br />
companies like Working Systems, are performing well in the Malaysian<br />
market. I had a couple of useful meetings with Prime Minister Mahathir at the APEC<br />
meeting last November. Each of us saw considerable potential for further co-</p>
<p>operation between Australia and Malaysia, particularly in areas like the<br />
environment and in scientific and technological research. I would like to see<br />
some practical steps forward on this during the year.<br />
Our relationships with Thailand, Laos and Vietnam also offer substantial<br />
opportunities to Australia. I visited all three countries in April 1994 and have<br />
since had further discussions with Prime Minister Chuan, when we met again<br />
at the APEC meeting in Jakarta. And I was glad to be able to talk to<br />
Vietnamese Foreign Minister Cam during his visit to Australia last week.<br />
We have now opened a new Consulate in Ho Chi Minh City which will help<br />
expand the commercial and consular services we can offer Australians there.<br />
So we have been making very good progress on all these fronts. But the task<br />
does not end. This year's agenda is equally heavy.<br />
In the APEC forum, the challenge this year is to put real flesh on the<br />
commitments entered into at Bogor.<br />
We have already set the end point for APEC trade and investment<br />
liberalisation comprehensive free and open trade in goods, services and<br />
capital. So, unlike the lengthy trade negotiations in the Uruguay Round, we<br />
will not be haggling about the extent to which we will reduce barriers.<br />
What we will be addressing at our Osaka meeting and what we expect to<br />
come out of the meeting is a comprehensive action agenda for getting to<br />
free trade and investment<br />
This action agenda will set out the key principles to guide APEC trade<br />
liberalisation and put up some signposts along the way to 201 0/ 2020<br />
No one pretends this will be easy. But I am confident that the hard<br />
commitments we made in Bogor will be translated into action.<br />
Japan, as this year's APEC chair, will have a key role in this task and officials<br />
have begun a whole series of preparatory meetings.<br />
Australia is ready to assist Japan in whatever way we can over the next 12<br />
months.<br />
At Osaka, we want to be able to announce some commercial ly-relevant<br />
results on issues of concern to business such as standards harmonisation<br />
and conformance and customs simplification<br />
Australia strongly wants APEC trade liberalisation to feed into and fuel further<br />
global trade liberalisation<br />
So I hope APEC leaders will spell out at Osaka how they will accelerate the<br />
implementation of their Uruguay Round commitments so that by the time </p>
<p>World Trade Organisation ministers meet in Singapore, probably in late 1996,<br />
APEC will have established a very solid trade liberalisation agenda.<br />
And I hope that the rest of the world will enthusiastically take up the<br />
challenge. Next month, the first informal consultations between Australia and New<br />
Zealand and the ASEAN countries about possible links between CER and<br />
AFTA will be held in Jakarta. Our first step will be to explore with the<br />
ASEANs how we can promote investment links and closer business ties and<br />
develop practical trade facilitation measures.<br />
I also want to explore in the year ahead ways in which Australia can<br />
consolidate our co-operation with our Southeast Asian neighbours in areas<br />
like science and technological co-operation, and medical education. A great<br />
deal is already happening in these areas, but I believe more can and should<br />
be done to strengthen these ties and to ensure that we are drawing on the<br />
mutual advantages we can offer each other. I will be working on some<br />
specific proposals.<br />
Bilaterally, we have a heavy agenda of follow-up work with individual<br />
countries. I will be meeting Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong again in Singapore on<br />
March for a further round of discussions about regional developments and to<br />
monitor the progress we have been making with the bilateral relationship.<br />
Our defence relations with Singapore, for example, are a first-rate example of<br />
strategic partnership with regional countries at work. On Friday, I will visit the<br />
Singapore Airforce Flying Training School at Pearce RAAF base, and we<br />
have other areas of possible defence co-operation with Singapore under<br />
discussion. This year is the fiftieth anniversary of Indonesia's independence. Australia<br />
played a role in that process through the international support the Australian<br />
Labor Party Government gave to the independence struggle.<br />
The Indonesian people have much to be proud of. Over the past quarter of a<br />
century, Indonesia's economic growth rate has averaged almost 7 per cent<br />
per annum, and the number of Indonesians living in poverty has decreased<br />
from over 60 per cent of the population to just 13 percent. This is expected to<br />
fall to 6 per cent by 1999. We will want to mark this important anniversary in<br />
an appropriate way.<br />
China is likely to go through a leadership transition this year. When Deng<br />
Xiaoping dies, a degree of uncertainty will no doubt enter Chinese politics.<br />
But Australia and Australian business need to be clear that we are engaged<br />
with China for the long haul. </p>
<p>Its importance will only grow. But doing business there will be an<br />
increasingly complex task. The reforms which Deng Xiaoping unleashed<br />
mean that the simple days in which businesspeople could deal with the<br />
central government have gone. More and more decisions have been<br />
devolved from the state to the private sector and from the centre to the<br />
regions.<br />
That is why it is important to sustain the ties we have in China. More than<br />
100 Chinese corporations and organisations have opened representative<br />
branch offices in Australia and the number is increasing rapidly. We need to<br />
encourage that and the reverse process of Australian investment in China.<br />
I want to say something about India, too. There is probably a clearer sense<br />
here in Perth than anywhere else in the country of the potential for closer<br />
economic links with India.<br />
The Government is enthusiastic about building this relationship. India's<br />
economy is growing around 6 per cent annually and our own exports have<br />
grown by about $ 300 million in the past five years.<br />
I was planning to visit India myself next month, but domestic developments in<br />
India have unfortunately forced the visit's postponement.<br />
Even so, Senator McMullan has been in India this week, leading a<br />
trade mission with a very strong West Australian component, and Senator<br />
Evans is also planning to visit later this year. So we will be keeping up the<br />
momentum. For this reason, I am pleased to announce that we will be holding a major<br />
promotion in India in the second half of 1996.<br />
We will be putting our finest arts, scientific, technological and educational<br />
achievements on show in order to build Australia's profile in India and<br />
promote our trade and investment links. India's selection as the venue for<br />
this promotion underlines the importance Australia attaches to the bilateral<br />
relationship. More broadly, there is growing interest in exploring possible areas of cooperation<br />
around the whole Indian Ocean rim and the Government will be<br />
holding an important conference here in Perth in June to look further at these<br />
options. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Foreign policy can no longer be isolated from other aspects of public policy.<br />
Australia's success internationally depends not just on skilful diplomacy but<br />
on our having in place the right economic policies to make our country strong<br />
and competitive, and the right social policies to ensure that we make the best </p>
<p>use of all our people and that our children are educated with the knowledge<br />
and skills they need.<br />
On all these fronts we are making significant progress.<br />
Economically, we are the fastest growing of all major industrialised<br />
economies and forecast to remain so throughout this year. Business<br />
investment is expected to grow by 24 per cent in 1994-95 and the profit<br />
share has seldom been higher.<br />
And despite this growth, underlying inflation has remained steady at around 2<br />
per cent.<br />
Employment is expected to grow by 3 3/ 4 per cent in 1994-95 an increase of<br />
300,000 jobs through the year.<br />
This is an enormously strong foundation on which to build sustainable growth<br />
and it makes us an increasingly attractive partner in growth for the countries<br />
around us.<br />
We need also to ensure that we are making the very best use of our people.<br />
I have already spoken about the need to unleash the economic capacities of<br />
our ethnic communities. We will be discussing this whole issue more broadly<br />
in April when, as part of our contribution to the 50th anniversary celebrations<br />
of the United Nations, we will be hosting in Sydney a major international<br />
conference on Global Cultural Diversity.<br />
We have also put in place major reforms to Australia's training system to<br />
ensure that our work force is prepared for the new, more intensively<br />
knowledge-based, world we are moving into.<br />
That is why the Commonwealth Government is spending $ 68 million under<br />
the National Languages Strategy to improve the teaching of Asian languages<br />
in Australian schools, focussing in particular on Chinese, Indonesian,<br />
Japanese and Korean.<br />
The demand is already there. Between 1987 and 1991 enrolments in<br />
Australian languages increased by 86 per cent. In 1969, 429 primary and<br />
secondary students were studying Chinese; the figure today is more than<br />
25,000.<br />
All this is very good news for our children's future in Asia.<br />
Finally, another dimension of our domestic policy which will shape our<br />
international standing relates to our constitutional arrangements and national<br />
symbols. </p>
<p>In my view, it is important that Australians are able to represent ourselves<br />
overseas in ways that are appropriate to the twenty first century. I have no<br />
doubt that this means moving to have an Australian as our head of state.<br />
In its report released just last month, Western Australia's own Constitutional<br />
Committee considered the changes needed to provide for this. It should be<br />
no surprise that the committee confirmed that there need be no concern that<br />
any changes would affect Western Australia's position in the federation.<br />
I take issue with those who say that this question does not matter in our<br />
dealings with Asia.<br />
Of course our current constitutional arrangements do not prevent our<br />
business people from making deals or the Government from developing<br />
cordial and productive relations with our neighbours. And the reason we<br />
need to make these changes is because they are important to our sense of<br />
ourselves as a people, not because of the sense others have of us.<br />
But it is totally wrong to imagine that the fact that we share with a number of<br />
other countries a Head of State who resides in Europe does not have an<br />
impact on the attitude which our Asian neighbours have about the<br />
fundamental direction of this country.<br />
The Singapore Straits Times, for example, wrote recently that one of the<br />
things Australia had done right in its drive towards becoming an integral part<br />
of the region was ' preparing the people for a constitutional break with the<br />
British sovereign to become a republic' President Kim Young Sam of Korea<br />
made the same point in an interview after his return from Australia.<br />
We have, of course, many foreign policy interests outside Asia, many<br />
relationships of substance and importance. In a globalised world, that it is as<br />
it must be. I am looking forward, for example, to visiting Germany and the<br />
Netherlands early next month.<br />
But, as I have said before, the simple truth for Australia is that unless we<br />
succeed in Asia, we succeed nowhere.<br />
The challenges we face are great. But it is as exciting an enterprise as<br />
anything Australia has ever been involved with. And on its outcome depends<br />
nothing less than the future of this country as we enter the twenty first<br />
century. Australia's Asian community will be a key to that process. But I want to<br />
emphasise that I do not see this as the only role of that community, or the<br />
sole preserve of that community.<br />
What is needed, above all, is for Australians of Asian background to take<br />
their full place in all aspects of our national life in politics, in the arts, in </p>
<p>St 13<br />
entertainment and communications, in business and the professions. This<br />
process is already well underway, but it has further to go.<br />
Only when it is complete will we be able to say that the contribution of the<br />
Chinese and other Asian communities to Australian life matches its enormous<br />
potential. ends </p>
