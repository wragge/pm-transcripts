    <content><![CDATA[<p>The first issues paper to inform the White Paper on the Reform of the Federation was released today.</p>
<p>Since Federation, the Commonwealth Governmentâs role has increasingly overlapped with activity which is traditionally the responsibility of the States and Territories.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this has been necessary. Sometimes, this overlap has seen reduced accountability to voters, duplication of activities and blame-shifting.</p>
<p>The White Paper on the Reform of the Federation will seek to clarify roles and responsibilities to ensure that, as far as possible, the States and Territories are sovereign in their own sphere, so that voters know who is responsible for what.</p>
<p>The issues paper has been developed in consultation with the States and Territories and the Australian Local Government Association and sets out key matters the White Paper will consider.</p>
<p>This includes the allocation of roles and responsibilities within the Federation, federal financial relations, governance arrangements and performance reporting.</p>
<p>Australians are encouraged to provide feedback on key areas like education, health, housing and federal financial relations.</p>
<p>Issues papers to be released later in the year will explore each of these matters in more detail.</p>
<p>A Green Paper outlining specific reform options will be released in the first half of 2015. Public submissions will be invited on the Green Paper. The White Paper will be delivered by the end of 2015.</p>
<p>The issues paper is available via the Federation White Paper website <a href="http://www.federation.dpmc.gov.au/">www.federation.dpmc.gov.au</a>.</p>
