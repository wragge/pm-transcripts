COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. W. McMAHON, M. P.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
ON<br />
Relief of Non-Metropolitan Unemployment<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 2 December 1971]<br />
Mr McMAHON ( Lowe-Prime Minister)-<br />
by leave-I wish to inform the<br />
House that I have written to each of the<br />
State Premiers seeking agreement to the<br />
introduction as soon as possible of a<br />
scheme of Commonwealth grants to the<br />
Sta-les for employment-creating activities in<br />
non-metropyolitan areas where such -action<br />
is desirable for social and economic<br />
reasons. Te Government has been concerned,<br />
as I know the State governments<br />
have been, at the difficulties confronting<br />
some of our rural industries-wool, in particular-<br />
and the communities dependent on<br />
them. We are, of course, with the cooperation<br />
of the State governments, where<br />
appropriate, already providing massive<br />
assistance to the industries in quest-ion.<br />
Indeed, as the House will know, I have<br />
had correspondence recently with some of<br />
the Premiers on these matters and particularly<br />
on the problem of unemployment in<br />
non-metropolitan areas.<br />
The Government is determined to meet<br />
and overcome the problems facing the<br />
rural industries that are in difficulty. But<br />
that will take time, and we believe that<br />
meanwhile there is a need to take temporary<br />
measures for the alleviation of unemployment<br />
in non-metropolitan areas, with<br />
the social problems associated with that.<br />
This is a particular aspect of the difficulties<br />
facing our rural populations and one which<br />
is of increasing concern to us. Much of this non-metropolitan unemployment<br />
is of a structural kind and, therefore,<br />
requires particular rather than<br />
general economic measures to deal with it.<br />
As the health of the rural industries concerned<br />
improves, this will contribute over<br />
a period to the alleviation of non-metropolitan<br />
unemployment. The current rural<br />
reconstruction scheme and the retraining<br />
programme and rehabilitation assistance<br />
associated with it will make a useful contribution.<br />
But all these measures will take<br />
time to become fully effective and, in the<br />
meantime, the stubborn economic and<br />
social problem of rural unemployment<br />
seems likely to continue unless specific<br />
short term action is taken to deal with<br />
it. Following my return from overseas the<br />
Treasurer ( Mr Snedden) had discussions<br />
with me about this matter, and subsequently<br />
Cabinet has considered the problem<br />
and possible responses to it. A<br />
measure which we believe would have a<br />
quick and direct impact on the problembut<br />
without significantly impeding the long<br />
term adjustments necessary to meet changing<br />
economic conditions in rural areas-is<br />
the provision of funds for employmentcreating<br />
activities in affected non-metropolitan<br />
areas and I have written to the Premiers<br />
proposing a scheme of grants for<br />
this purpose. </p>
<p>The details of the scheme would, of<br />
course, be determined in consultation with<br />
the States. In -broad terms, however, the<br />
Government envisages an arrangement providing<br />
for grants for employment-creating<br />
activities to be made to the States for the<br />
period up to 30th June 1973, subject to<br />
review after 30th June 1972 in the light of<br />
the then prevailing conditions.<br />
The objective of the scheme would be to<br />
make a significant impact on the level of<br />
unemployment in non-metropolitan areas.<br />
Thus, grants would be made for the purpose<br />
of reimbursing expenditures on additional<br />
labour-intensive activities of a productive<br />
kind which might be undertaken<br />
by State, semi-government and local government<br />
authorities to provide employment<br />
for those unemployed in non-metropolitan<br />
areas. Recent grants made to some States<br />
under the drought relief arrangements to<br />
enable the employment of persons who<br />
were unemployed as a result of drought<br />
might be taken as a broad indication of<br />
the type of scheme the Government has in<br />
mind. Obviously, since the details of the<br />
scheme remain to be settled with the Premiers,<br />
it is not possible at this time to put<br />
any precise figure on what the cost of the<br />
scheme might be in the balance of this<br />
financial year. Details will, of course, be<br />
given as soon as they can be worked out.<br />
and, on the assumption that the proposal<br />
will meet with the approval in principle of<br />
the Premiers, the Treasury will be moving<br />
speedily to arrange the necessary discussions<br />
between Commonwealth and State<br />
officials. The chief costs involved are, however,<br />
likely to be wage costs, plus some lesser amount-perhaps up to 25 per cent<br />
of the total-for the purchase of materials<br />
and, perhaps, equipment. A figure of $ 2m<br />
a month or thereabouts might approximate<br />
the kind of broad order of cost we have in<br />
mind but having said that, I must add that<br />
there are numerous uncertainties about<br />
such a figure at this stage. Much will<br />
depend not only on our discussion of the<br />
details with the States but on the extent to,<br />
and the speed with, which they can give<br />
effect to the proposals. In this latter regard<br />
I may mention also that we would envisage<br />
the Department of Labour and National<br />
Service being closely associated with the<br />
scheme at the ground roots level. But, for<br />
all the reasons I have indicated, we do not,<br />
at this stage, have a closed mind on the<br />
question of the precise amount to be<br />
provided during the balance of this financial<br />
year even though we have in mind<br />
something of the order already mentioned.<br />
On the assumption that these proposals<br />
will be acceptable in principle to the Premiers<br />
we shall require to bring forward to<br />
the House early in the autumn session legislation<br />
to authorize the necessary grants to<br />
the States. Meanwhile, however, temporary<br />
arrangements will be made for the financing<br />
of the scheme in the interim. I believe<br />
that that would, in all the circumstances,<br />
meet with the approval of the House. This<br />
proposal, of course, demonstrates the Government's<br />
readiness to respond to changing<br />
circumstances. Designed as it is to meet<br />
the emerging social and economic problem<br />
of unemployment in non-metropolitan<br />
areas the scheme will, I believe, be warmly<br />
welcomed by the House and by the community<br />
at -large.<br />
