FOR PRESS: PM Io. 5 '! 971<br />
UI~ DEPENDErTF ENQUIRY INJTO REPATRIATION SYSTEM<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. William McMahon<br />
From time to time, representations have been made to the<br />
Government, particularly by the Returned Services League of Australia, to<br />
have an enquiry into the rationale and principles of the Repatriation system.<br />
In response to these requests, and following discussions with my<br />
colleague, the Minister for Repatriation, Mr. Mac Holten, we have now<br />
decided that an independent enquiry should be set in train.<br />
I am sure that all the ex-servicemen's organisations will welcome<br />
this decision, as also will the critics of the system, most of whom have<br />
expressed a preference for an-indepe. det non-parliamentary enquiry rather<br />
than the one which the Government had earlier directed to be carried out by<br />
the Repatriation Department.<br />
The exact terms of reference of the enquiry will be settled as<br />
soon as practicable, after which consideration will be given to the selection<br />
of a suitable person to conduct the enquiry and to the appointment of people<br />
to assist him. It is probable that certain evidence will be taken in public, but<br />
this will depend to some degree on the terms of reference which are ultimately<br />
decided upon, and on the general framework of the enquiry.<br />
These matters and others w ll be the subject of a separate statement at<br />
a later date by the Minister for Repatriation.<br />
The Government feels that the course of action it is now adopting should<br />
meet the wishes of most of those people in terested in the problem of war<br />
compensation for those who have disabilities related to war service.<br />
