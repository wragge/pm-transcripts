FOR PRESS AWAjRD FOR GALLANTRY<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Ministerp<br />
The Rt. Hon. John McEwen<br />
The Acting Prime Ministerp The Rt. Hon. John McEwen,<br />
announced today that Her Majesty, The Queen, had awarded the<br />
British Empire Medal for gallantry to Mr. William James<br />
Beadman, of Canberra.<br />
Mr. Beadman, a bus driver for the Department of the<br />
Izterlor in Canberra, hod been responsible for the rescue<br />
of Mr. Bruce David Shields from drowning in Lake Burley<br />
Griffin on November 26 last year.<br />
He had unselfishly placed his own life in danger in<br />
entering the Lake, which had been made rough and ohoppy by<br />
high winds, Mr. McEwen said. Mr. Beadman had shown gallantry<br />
of a high order in entering the rough water.<br />
The official report stated Mr. Beadman had been driving<br />
his bus over Kings Avenue Bridge when he saw three people<br />
struggling in the Lake near an overturned rowing shell.<br />
The three Mr. Shields, Mr. Colin Leslie Panton and<br />
his nine-year-old son, Colin Stuart Luke Panton were<br />
returning from a rowing exercise early in the morning of<br />
November 26 when their boat was swamped in the rough water<br />
which had developed.<br />
All three were thrown into the water when the boat<br />
rolled over.<br />
The report said that Shields managed to cling to the<br />
boat, but Panton let go to help his son.<br />
Shields tried to manoeuvre the boat towards them,<br />
but the force of the wind was too great and he saw father<br />
and son separate.<br />
Shields then saw a man ( Beadman) removing his clothes<br />
on the Lake shore and saw Beadman swimming towards the other<br />
two, but they vanished below the surface before he reached<br />
them. Beadman then came over to Shields at the boat and under<br />
Beadman's instruction, the two managed to reach the shorq<br />
with the boat.<br />
The wind was blowing the waves against the Lake wall,<br />
creating a strong back current.<br />
In the prevailing conditions, it was quite probable<br />
that Shields also would have drowned if Deadman had not gone<br />
to his rescue. / 2 </p>

BACKGROUND Mr. Deadman has been employed at the Department of<br />
the Interior's Transport Section since 1936.<br />
He was at one time a Ministerial car driver, but for<br />
the past fifteen to eighteen years, has been a bus driver<br />
bringing children to school from the Kowen area.<br />
He was also selected, because of his aptitude, to take<br />
handicapped children to and from the Koomarri School in<br />
Canberra. Mr. Beadman was President of the Canberra branch of<br />
the Transport Workers' Union for twelve years until<br />
relinquishing this office about three years ago.<br />
