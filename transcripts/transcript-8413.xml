SPEECH NOTES: BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
TO THE INAUGURAL MEETING: COUNCIL FOR ABORIGINAL<br />
RECONCILIATION, CANBERRA, 21 FEBRUARY 1992<br />
Mr Chairman, members of the Council I have taken this<br />
opportunity to welcome you here for this inaugural meeting<br />
and to say one or two things which I think ought to be said.<br />
There is a big challenge ahead of you a challenge which<br />
has pretty well defeated us for 200 years.<br />
But I think this is a good time to take it on. I think there<br />
is a new willingness among Australians to embrace change,<br />
and there is certainly a willingness in this government to<br />
make changes.<br />
You'll see some of that in the economic statement next week.<br />
As long as I'm in this position you're going to see changes.<br />
And one of the big changes I want to see is change * in the<br />
status of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. At<br />
present it is awful. For many Aboriginal people it's a<br />
tragedy. It debilitates our nation it debilitates our<br />
culture, our reputation and our self-esteem. It undermines<br />
our ambitions to be a good society.<br />
I'm one of those people who think it can be fixed.<br />
I think most Australians these days recognise that having<br />
come here and taken over the place from the Aboriginal we<br />
can't now sneer at those of them who have ended up<br />
demoralised and destitute.<br />
These days most Australians recognise that and if they<br />
forget it from time to time, it doesn't mean that they can't<br />
easily be persuaded to the cause of improvement. That's one<br />
reason why we can make changes.<br />
Most AustraliLans I think also recognise the unarguable fact,<br />
the big fact the fact that Aboriginal Australians and<br />
Torres Strait Islanders were the first Australians and<br />
that they are no less Australians for that.<br />
That's the fiLrst building block. That's a strength. it<br />
means that ifE other things were equal there would be no<br />
question about the status of Aborigines. They have an </p>
<p>absolute status, and an absolute right to be in the<br />
mainstream, not the margins. The thing is to make the other<br />
things equal.<br />
The government is open to suggestion about the best way to<br />
make this happen. The door's open. You're the best people to<br />
judge, and we want to hear from you.<br />
But, let me tell you, as a politician there are always<br />
those who are happiest spending their time arguing the toss.<br />
On these sorts of bodies you can spend your time debating<br />
fine principles and finer points. You can talk about ideal<br />
outcomes from now until the end of the century. You can<br />
spend a decade in debate and deliberation.<br />
Or you can do something.<br />
I suggest you aim at doing something. Something real.<br />
Make real improvements. Concrete improvements in health<br />
and education for instance. Building blocks of change.<br />
I believe in fact I'm quite certain that the best way to<br />
improve relations between Aboriginal Australians and non-<br />
Aboriginal Australians and the best way to provide a basis<br />
for reconciliation is to close the gap in living conditions.<br />
At present the gap is huge. It has to be closed in the end<br />
it has to be diminished to the point where no one can point<br />
to someone and say the reason for that person's poverty, or<br />
illness, or alcoholism is that he or she is Aboriginal.<br />
I think most: Australians want that to happen. And I think<br />
they also recognise that it will only happen if the energy<br />
and commitment is coming from the whole community non-<br />
Aboriginal and Aboriginal. There's no question that the<br />
Aboriginal community has got to deliver a lot of the<br />
initiative, and be active players in this.<br />
I said before that I think there is a shift in the mood of<br />
Australia that people are open to change. I think that's<br />
true in their attitude to your concerns.<br />
I don't mean. that they simply want to see a problem solved.<br />
They do want to'see that: but I also think non-Aboriginal<br />
Australia is now much more sympathetic and much more<br />
knowledgeable. We're generally much better educated about Aboriginal<br />
culture and history, much more aware of the civilisation<br />
which existed here before Europeans came, much more<br />
knowledgeable about what has happened since and much more<br />
concerned about what is happening now. </p>
<p>It's not true of all non Aboriginal Australians of course<br />
there is still a certain amount of ignorance and prejudice<br />
in this country, but, like I said, there's no future in<br />
dwelling on the negatives, no point in dwelling on the<br />
people who find it harder to see. Concentrate on the ones<br />
who see best and the rest will be persuaded by the things<br />
they see you do.<br />
So again, if you'll forgive a little political advice<br />
that's what you've got to work on, your strengths, and the<br />
strengths which are waiting to be tapped. It's about<br />
creating and catching a wave.<br />
For my part, I am absolutely committed to this. It's a huge<br />
challenge, and hugely significant in the determination of<br />
Australia's future.<br />
But if we the government, ATSIC and this council if we<br />
set ourselves progressive goals and work towards them<br />
urgently, we can begin to destroy that gap in living<br />
standards, we can begin to make life better for Aboriginal<br />
people and Torres Strait Islanders, and if we do that it<br />
will be a lot better for non-Aboriginal Australians as well.<br />
And when people see what is being done, more and more will<br />
come to believe in what can be done and they'll want it to<br />
be done.<br />
Mr Chairman I have the greatest faith that you and your<br />
Council can do it. I look forward to seeing you regularly<br />
and seeing the signs of your progress. I wish you well. </p>
