Fax from PRIME MINISTER<br />
UNFAIR DISMISSALS<br />
I have today written to the Premiers and Chief Ministers to follow-tip my<br />
Government's decision that businesses with 15 or fewer employees should<br />
be exempt from the federal unfar dismissal provisions in respect of new<br />
employees until they have been continuously employed for 12 months.<br />
I have asked for the Premiers' support in implementing complementary<br />
changes to their own industrial relations legislation. It is very important<br />
that the benefits for employment, particularly of young people are<br />
maximised by ensuring that as many of the states and territories as possible<br />
adopt our approach to unfair dismissals in respect of small businesses.<br />
With State and Territory co-operation it will be possible to ensure that at<br />
least 80 per cent of small businesses with employees benefit from the<br />
Federal Government's initiative. I<br />
At the State level we already have a head start because Victoria, which<br />
referred industrial relations matters to the Commonwealth last year, will<br />
automatically gain the benefits of the change to the Commonwealth<br />
regulations on unfair dismissal. Small businesses in the ACT and the<br />
Northern Territory will also automatically gain the benefits of this change<br />
at -the Commonwealth level.<br />
Many of the state leaders have previously indicated their support for<br />
reforms of the unfair dismissal laws and I look forward to their early cooperation<br />
on this importat national industrial and employment matter.<br />
