EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN<br />
Statement bythe Prime Minister,. Rt Hon. ReG. MenzLes)<br />
The four Government women S; ators Senators RankinW( Q)<br />
Robertson, Buttfield, and Nedgwood ( Vic.) today<br />
made representations to me on matters affecting the conditions of<br />
employment of women in the Commonwealth Public Service, Their<br />
representations dealt more specifically with proposals which they<br />
first raised last year and again a few weeks -go, and on which<br />
Senator Buttfield already has a question on the Notice Paper of<br />
the Senate, The proposals fell into three categories:<br />
Equal pay for women for work of equal value<br />
Equal opportunity for women<br />
Elimination of the marriage bar in respect of women<br />
who are parmanent officers in the Commonwealth<br />
Public Service<br />
The four Senators advanced strong arguments in respect<br />
of the three matters and I have promised that the points raised<br />
in our discussions will be brought before the Cabinet.<br />
On the question of equal pay for women for work of<br />
equal value I pointed out to the four Senators that the<br />
discrimination which existed at the present time related only to<br />
the base rates of payment and that where margins for skill were<br />
involved there was no discrimination on the basis of sex.<br />
I also pointed out that the Government had always been<br />
most reluctant to interfere in the function of industrial<br />
tribunals to determine tho question of base rates.<br />
With respect to the continued employment of women after<br />
they had married I pointed out that the High Council of Public<br />
Service Organisations had expressed the view last year that<br />
because of the employment situation and other considerations there<br />
should not be any change in the present attitude of the Public<br />
Service Board, I told the Senators that some of the suggestions they<br />
had made warranted further examination and that I would seek<br />
information from the Public Service Board to place before the<br />
Cabinet for a thorough discussion of the issues.<br />
CANBERRA April, 1962. </p>
