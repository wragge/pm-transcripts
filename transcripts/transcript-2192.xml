FOR PRESS P. M. No 35/ 1970<br />
CENTRAL QUEENSLAND POWER HOUSE<br />
The Prime Minister and the Premier of Queensland today<br />
issued the following statement:-<br />
" Last September the Prime Minister announced the Commonwealth<br />
Government's willingness to help finance a proposed power house<br />
in Central Queensland.<br />
It was believed that the establishment of this power house would<br />
attract very significant industrial development to the Gladstone<br />
area.<br />
At the time of the announcement the Commonwealth said that<br />
it was prepared to lend up to $ 80 million for that part of the<br />
power station which would meet the initial needs of that<br />
industrial development.<br />
Final arrangements for this loan have now been made<br />
between the two Governments and officers will meet next<br />
week to draw up an agreement for the provision of the finance.<br />
Legislation will be introduced as soon as possible thereafter".<br />
