STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
NATIONAL STRATEGIES CONFERENCE FINDINGS c<br />
Today I wish to announce the publication of Shaping Our Future, the<br />
proceedings of the National Strategies Conference of last year.<br />
The themes emerging from this benchmark review of our long-term goals<br />
show that the priorities and concerns of Australians are recognised and are<br />
being acted upon by this Government.<br />
The necessary strategic direction for shaping a rewarding future for Australia<br />
is being firmly set in place by our past, present and future policies.<br />
I commissioned the National Strategies Conference convened on November<br />
24-25 1994 by the new Economic Planning Advisory Commission ( EPAC)<br />
with the aim of defining national ambitions and opportunities, and considering<br />
long-term strategies.<br />
According to the EPAC overview, a basic vision for Australia that emerged<br />
was of a country that is both creative and productive and inclusive and<br />
ecologically sustainable. There was broad agreement on these as national<br />
goals, and these are endorsed as goals by this Government.<br />
Also according to EPAC, key future priorities for the achievement of these<br />
goals were defined at the Conference as the following.<br />
" consolidation and enhancement of Australia's emergence as a Global<br />
Nation; further development of Australia's capacities as an Innovative Nation in<br />
each of the economic, social and environmental spheres;<br />
reinvigoration of the commitment to a Sustainable Australia through<br />
ecologically sensitive activities and policy development; and<br />
redefinition of a Social Charter to provide for social security, personal<br />
and community development and civic engagement'. 4647 </p>
<p>The proceedings of the Conference evoked a great sense of optimism. Many<br />
participants spoke of Australia's great potential and opportunity. Australia<br />
was seen as having the promise to be a role model for other countries. For<br />
young Australians this is the most important message of all.<br />
