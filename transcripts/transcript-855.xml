    <content><![CDATA[<p>In my Policy Speech IÂ announced, amongst other Government Proposals, a decision to give aÂ subsidy to young people under the age of 35 of Â£1 for every Â£3Â saved towards home buildingÂ or purchase.</p>
<p>Questions of detailed administration in respect of the proposed subsidy have been and are being broughtÂ to my attention,</p>
<p>These are matters similar to those which always ariseÂ when new and imaginativeÂ Government proposals are brought forward. At this stage I say this</p>
<p>"The Government'sÂ proposal willÂ be administered sympathtically andÂ liberally. Our idea at all. times will be to helpÂ rather than hinder,Â to include people in the benefits rather than hinder than to exclude themÂ ",</p>
<p>14thÂ November, 1963.</p>
