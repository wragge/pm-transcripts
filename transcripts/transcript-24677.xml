    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today marks the one hundredth anniversary of the Battle of Lone Pine.</p>
<p>It was on the evening of 6 August 1915 that the ANZACs struck against entrenched Turkish positions at Lone Pine, Gallipoli.</p>
<p>Within 20 minutes, most of the enemy front line had been captured.</p>
<p>However, four days of bitter hand-to-hand fighting ensued.</p>
<p>Some 800 Australians were killed and 1500 were wounded in and around the trenches.</p>
<p>The Turkish casualties were almost three times ours.</p>
<p>A century on, the Battle of Lone Pine holds a lasting place in the Australian memory.Â </p>
<p>Our soldiers fought for their mates; for their country, empire and king; and ultimately for the ideal that people and countries should be free.</p>
<p>They stood for duty, loyalty, honour and mateship.</p>
<p>The Battle of Lone Pine was the only success of the August offensive at Gallipoli. Seven Australians earned the Victoria Cross for their actions in the assault.</p>
<p>During that battle, and throughout the Gallipoli campaign, our forebears faced trials scarcely imaginable to those they had left behind.</p>
<p>On this centenary, we pay tribute to all who fought in the Battle of Lone Pine.</p>
<p>We draw strength from their example and we honour the fallen.</p>
<p>Lest we forget.</p>
