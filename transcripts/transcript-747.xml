COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
SPEECH 13Y<br />
Rt. Hon. SIR ROBERT MENZIES,<br />
M. P.,<br />
ON<br />
UNITED STATES NAVAL COMMUNICATION<br />
STATION AGREEMENT BILL 1963.<br />
[ From the " Parliamentary Debates," 22nd May, 1963.]<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES ( Kooyong-<br />
Prime Minister) [ 8.50].-When I remember<br />
that not so long ago the Leader of the<br />
Opposition ( Mr. Calwell), like myself, was<br />
a little out of action, I feel that I ought to<br />
congratulate him on having come back in<br />
such magnificent form. It is a long time<br />
since I heard him to such advantagefor<br />
my side. He really was in very good<br />
form. Mr. Stewart.-Where is the Minister for<br />
External Affairs?<br />
Sir ROBERT MIENZIS-It is all right;<br />
I am still in office.<br />
Mr. Stewart.--Where is he? Put him up!<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-41e is still<br />
here, and I am still here; and I am speaking.<br />
You do not mind, do you? Come, Frank,<br />
do you mind?<br />
Mr. Stewart.-No, but I want to hear<br />
Gar. Mr. Ward.-He has gone out to get his<br />
medal. Mr. SPEAKER.--Ordert<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-The Leader<br />
of the Opposition has really waxed very<br />
eloquent to-night. He follows in the footsteps<br />
of one of his senior members who<br />
4751/ 63. explained to us earlier, in -the second-reading<br />
debate, that the House would not be<br />
divided on the-question of the communication<br />
centre and that therefore the motion<br />
for the second reading would go through<br />
without division; but that in committee and<br />
at the third-reading stage there would be<br />
amendments. It is very interesting to note<br />
that, after the next division, the Labour<br />
Party, which wants to be able to go out and<br />
say, We are really supporters of the<br />
establishment of this communication<br />
centre will have voted four times against<br />
it and only once for it.<br />
Another interesting thing is that, although<br />
we were told that the whole of the serried<br />
ranks of -the Labour Party-now so happily,<br />
if precariously, united on this matterwould<br />
be put into the battle, so far the<br />
divisions on this bill have shown a majority<br />
for the Government not of one but of seven<br />
and of five. What has become of the<br />
Opposition? Has the will of the Opposition<br />
weakened? Where are our wandering boys<br />
to-night? Why, with a majority of seven<br />
or five I could live an awful long time in<br />
this office. But, Sir, here it is; for the<br />
fourth time we are going to be asked to<br />
divide. What about? I will answer that<br />
question first technically and then in<br />
substance. </p>
<p>First of all technically, I say to the people<br />
of Australia who no doubt are following<br />
our proceedings with rapt interest-or we<br />
think so-that Standing Order No. 237<br />
deals with the third reading of a bill. After<br />
all, this Parliament is governed by its own<br />
Standing Orders. My distinguished friend<br />
the Leader of the Opposition, made a somewhat<br />
obituary reference to Sir Thomas<br />
Erskine May, the author of May's Parliamentary<br />
Practice who, he said, lived a<br />
long time ago. He suggested that this is an<br />
antiquated idea. I am surprised, because<br />
our Standing Orders were not written by<br />
Sir Thomas Erskine May who<br />
lived a long time ago; they were<br />
written by the Standing Orders<br />
Committee, with the approval of the members<br />
of this House, and they were revised<br />
only the other day. So there is nothing<br />
dead about our book of Standing Orders.<br />
This is the last and final edition of our own<br />
Standing Orders. I remind honorable<br />
members opposite that in Standing Order<br />
No. 237, dealing with the motion " That<br />
the bill be now read a third time" this is<br />
the provision-<br />
The only amendment which may be moved to<br />
the question is by omitting " now" and adding<br />
" this day six months", which, if carried, shall<br />
finally dispose of the Bill<br />
Let us understand this. Supposing -that in<br />
a passion of eloquence or by persuasive<br />
oratory my distinguished opponent had<br />
persuaded a couple of people on this side<br />
of the House to stay away or one person<br />
on this side of the House -to cross the floor<br />
and vote with him, the carrying of this<br />
amendment would have killed the agreement<br />
' and there would be no radio communication<br />
centre established at all.<br />
It ill becomes an opposition to say, Well,<br />
of course, we moved it this way because<br />
we know that it will not be carried ". That<br />
would be humbug, surely. Therefore, we<br />
must be able to test members of the Labour<br />
' Party by saying that they moved this amendment<br />
hoping that for some reason or<br />
another it would be carried. If they care<br />
to deny that, if they care to say publicly that<br />
it was all a bit of flim-flam and that they<br />
-moved the amendment hoping and ' believing<br />
that it would not he carried, then we can<br />
judge them and so can the people of Australia.<br />
But if they are prepared to stand<br />
up and say. We moved this hoping that in some fashion it would be carried then<br />
let them admit publicly that the carrying<br />
of their amendment would kill not only this<br />
bill but the establishment of the communication<br />
station.<br />
, Mr. Reynolds.-What rubbish!<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES-It is of no use<br />
saying rubbish I do not need to talk<br />
about rubbish to you.<br />
Mr. Allan Fraser.-We are seeking decent<br />
treatment-Mr. SPEAKER.-Qrde r! The honorable<br />
member for Eden-Monaro will remain silen't.<br />
Mr. Allan Frasr.-I am sorry.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-The honorable<br />
member -for Eden-Monaro always feels<br />
a little troubled when somebody puts the<br />
cold hand of reason on him because he is<br />
not a rational man. I shall repeat my point.<br />
I know that I will not persuade some of my<br />
friends opposite, although I suspect that one<br />
or two of them already agree with me, ' but<br />
I think it ought to be made clear to the<br />
people of Australia somehow or another that<br />
this amendment, if carried, would dispose<br />
of -the bill and that the bill having been<br />
disposed of, this communication centre<br />
would not be established.<br />
Of course, ' there are some ' honorable<br />
members opposite who imaigine that if this<br />
agreement were disposed of we could, in<br />
due course, at leisure and with some comfort-<br />
or they could after another election<br />
-have a pleasant negotiation with the<br />
United States of America. How unrealistic<br />
this is. The fact -is that the United States<br />
has not all that time to ' burn. When it wants<br />
to establish a communication centre. it wants<br />
it soon. When its Congress is asked to vote<br />
for proposals of this kind, the members<br />
Of Congress want to know that ' the proposal<br />
will contribute to the safety of the free<br />
world and' that it will go ahead. Yet this<br />
poor, ' bemused Opposition puts -itself on<br />
record with an amendment which, if carried,<br />
Would mean the destruction of the bill and<br />
the destruction of the agreement. Sir, anybody<br />
with a most elementary knowledge of<br />
the procedures of Parliament could not<br />
doubt for onc moment that that is the<br />
Position. </p>
<p>All I want to say on this point-because<br />
there has been a long debate and there is<br />
not much to be added to it-is that this<br />
amendment is the fourth attempt by the<br />
Opposition to destroy this proposal by<br />
destroying this bill and this agreement. The<br />
only other thing I want to say is this: This<br />
afternoon and, indeed, yesterday a careful<br />
campaign was conducted by the Opposition<br />
to suggest that Labour members alone are<br />
interested in the rights of Australia, the<br />
sovereignty of Australia and our right to<br />
determine our future. I do not want to be<br />
preached to by these people about this matter<br />
because, as a matter of fact, in the last war<br />
it was I who, as the head of the then govearnment,<br />
stipulated that the Second Australian<br />
Imperial Force which was going to the<br />
Middle East was not to be submerged in<br />
other formations; that it was to be under<br />
Australian command; and that it was to be<br />
in contact with the Australian Government<br />
whenever it wanted to be. This is an old<br />
practice. Nobody can claim a monopoly in<br />
this. It was established twenty years before<br />
I and those who sat in government witb<br />
me re-established it at that time.<br />
But, Sir, this is a case in which the Labour<br />
Party, however it may cloak its intention,<br />
wants to establish a proposition in the name<br />
of our own sovereignty that this signalling<br />
station is not to be used by the United<br />
States, except with the express approval of<br />
the Australian Government under circumstances<br />
in which the United States is at war.<br />
That is what the Opposition members are<br />
saying. Mr. Cahvlwell.-No, they are not.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.--Of course,<br />
they are. The Leader of the Opposition is<br />
rather handicapped in debating this. He<br />
began his speech in the second-reading<br />
debate by saying, in effect, that there was<br />
joint control. It now turns out that he<br />
agrees with us that there is no joint control.<br />
There is a power to consult. Therefore, he<br />
has gone to all this trouble and called all<br />
these divisions to try to produce the joint<br />
control which a few days ago he said already<br />
existed. We must be alive to the circumstances of<br />
the times. Australia is not a nuclear power.<br />
The United States is the greatest of the<br />
nuclear powers, much to our comfort. The existence of a nuclear deterrent in the<br />
United States and in Great Britainalthough<br />
at present to a much smaller<br />
extent there-is the condition by which we<br />
live. I repeat that. The problem that has<br />
to be considered is whether we want to<br />
have a deterrent that does not deter,<br />
whether we want to have a deterrent that<br />
cannot be used at the right time and in the<br />
right place. Picture the position to the<br />
north and west of Australia. Go west into<br />
the Indian Ocean, south of Communist<br />
China and south of Communist Russia. The<br />
United States is the great power that has<br />
the deterrent weapon in the air, from submarines<br />
and otherwise. I put this to everybody<br />
as a matter of plain common sense.<br />
Suppose the Communists decided that they<br />
would attack. Nobody would be so silly<br />
as to think they would send a courteous<br />
letter giving notice. When the Communists<br />
think that the time has come, they will act,<br />
and from that moment it will be a matter<br />
of minutes before the instruments of detection<br />
ascertain what they are doing and<br />
where their missiles are going. In<br />
those circumstances, literally with ballistic<br />
missiles in the air, we are told that there<br />
must be political consultation before the<br />
United States can retaliate from the Indian<br />
Ocean in order to render unprofitable the<br />
attack by the Communist powers.<br />
Sir, this is bedlamite nonsense. Why talk<br />
about a lot of theoretical matters when the<br />
fact is that it will be a matter of mere<br />
minutes before, the word having come<br />
through, the President of the United States<br />
will have to send a message to his own<br />
naval forces deployed in this part of the<br />
world, " You are to strike". We are told<br />
by the Labour Party that in those circumstances<br />
we must stipulate that before the<br />
United States authorities can send a message<br />
from our soil which might impair our<br />
neutrality they must have a political discussion<br />
with us. If I were running one of<br />
these great Communist countries, I could<br />
wish for nothing better than to see the most<br />
powerful enemy of communism hamstrung<br />
by having to engage in consultations of this<br />
kind before the return blow could come.<br />
We do not want the blow or the return<br />
blow. No honorable member of this House<br />
has any monopoly of humanity. We are </p>
<p>men with families and we are men concerned<br />
with the future of our country. Of<br />
course we do not want to have this<br />
diabolical disaster come on the world. But<br />
the best way of guaranteeing that it will<br />
come is to impair the efficacy of the counterstroke<br />
after the stroke comes. In other<br />
words, the best way to destroy our future<br />
is to put an impediment in the way of the<br />
great Western nuclear power-the great<br />
home of freedom for this purpose and the<br />
great protector of so many free nations in<br />
the world-and prevent it from being able<br />
to make its retaliation both certain and<br />
swift. A retaliation that is not certain and<br />
swift is not a retaliation at all.<br />
I beg honorable members opposite to<br />
come up to date on this matter. We are living in a world in which a war, if it came,<br />
would not leave a matter of months to do<br />
things and to prepare as in the past. If a<br />
war came, and it was a war on the global<br />
scale, it would have reached its peak in a<br />
day or two days. The first massive blows<br />
would have been delivered in minutes, not<br />
days. Sir, I am an Australian and I am<br />
proud of my country. I would not willingly<br />
abandon any of the rights of my country.<br />
I am a great believer in them. But, in the<br />
name of a theoretical protection of<br />
Australia's rights, to abandon Australia's<br />
real interests, to leave this country defenceless<br />
in a war of this kind and to leave<br />
Australia, as I said earlier, as the prize of<br />
victory is something that I will not accept,<br />
that my colleagues will not accept and that<br />
the people of Australia will not accept.<br />
