EMBARGOED UNTIL 6.00 PM<br />
FOR MEDIA 1 December 1985<br />
The Government has offered to provide two Hercules C130A<br />
transport aircraft to assist in the airlift of food supplies to<br />
famine areas in Africa.<br />
The aircraft would be provided through the International Disaster<br />
Emergency Committee ( IDEC)/ Australian Council for Overseas Aid<br />
( ACFOA) for use in the Sudan and/ or Ethiopia.<br />
The offer is in response to a request made by Live Aid organiser,<br />
Bob Geldof, during his visit to Australia in October. The Live<br />
Aid Oz for Africa appeal was a fantastic effort. Those involved<br />
in organising the appeal performed magnificently. The Government<br />
is pleased to be able to support the campaign in this way.<br />
The Government has agreed to meet the costs of making the<br />
aircraft flight-worthy and ferrying them to Africa. This is<br />
estimated to be between $ 1.1 and $ 1.7 million.<br />
The aircraft are expected to be fully operational in Africa by<br />
February next year.<br />
The Government is providing about $ 35 million in relief food aid<br />
to Africa this year and is also providing assistance for long<br />
term development in Africa through bilateral technical assistance<br />
and agricultural research. </p>
