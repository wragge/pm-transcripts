Takyou for inviting Tamie and me to share with you this<br />
18th anniversary dinner, celebrating as it does the founding<br />
of this marvellouscet.<br />
~~.--This-i-s.-your eighteenth year of operation. The Hebrew word<br />
for 1.8 is " chai1 which also means " life" and I cannot think of<br />
A better word to describe this centre. it serves the local.<br />
Jewish cormunity from early childhood to old age, and is a<br />
focus for your religious, cultural, Focial and sporting<br />
8 ivities, It serves as' a prime examiple of commiunity involvement,<br />
not only to the Melbourne Jewiih comzntnity, but to the comua-Iit. y<br />

You have shown what dedicated individuals can do ~ yusing<br />
Vtheir initiative and enterprise -qualities which my government<br />
seeks to foster by its policies.<br />
Realisation of Australia's potential for development depends<br />
I ~' on such initiative and enterprise. It cannot depend upon even<br />

<p>If governmnents take unto themselves nmorre political<br />
and economic power, and use it, there is less opportunity for<br />
decision-maXlng by individuals and families, Por the total<br />
Sum Of political and economic power is fin~ ite, th~ us the more<br />
power the government exercises, the less there is for individuals.<br />
Trhe greater the exercise of government power, the greater t he<br />
infringement upon the individual.<br />
Conservative, or liberal, governmento see% to create the<br />
circumstance where people not only can..-but will waflt. to do<br />
things for themselves. That is ) iot to say. that there is not a<br />
role for gocvernment in hze-lpingtheneedy, the diSadvantaged,<br />
Of course there is. And no gove rnment worthy of the name woul-d<br />
dispute that proposition.<br />
Btit governments ougqht not seek to do things that people want<br />
to do for themselves, thiat. peop~ le can elo for thenselves, for there<br />
are Tmany things that people do far better. t1hap. governments.<br />
and we are comitted to encouraging and1 stim~ ulating enterprise<br />
andl initiative. We are determined to continue to promot a<br />
environment in which individual capacities, individual choices<br />
and individual decision-nakiny are given the maximum possible<br />
scope. Over 100 years ago, John Stuart K4ill rentarked in' his essayv on<br />
liberty, moSt cogent -reason f6r restricting interference<br />
of governarent, is the! great evil. of adding unnecessarily---ts<br />
power" I 5 uppose all I air saying is8 that there can be no real<br />
political freedom without economic and social freedom.<br />
It is only possible to achieve real political freedom when<br />
individuals like your8elves are not constrainled by an.. unnecessarily<br />
interferingq government and when taxation does not pl ' aceaac rippling<br />
burden on effort and initiative, Only by giving due recognitiUonai<br />
and encouragement to the talents of the Australian people and<br />
allowing; theiAr full utilisation is true and lasting economic<br />
Prosperity attainable..',<br />
We have taken action on many fronts to achieve our objectives.<br />
Our corxnitrn'ent to individual enterprise involves an empbha<br />
on ' restraining taxation. Governments do not create wealth.<br />
When they promise grand procjrarwues, they are prbomirinj to<br />
tax you and then spend your money. Individuals should bie left<br />
as free as possible to choose where and how they spend their<br />
money, money which is the result of their enterprise, their<br />
effort and their initiative.<br />
Ti. </p>
<p>. I 7 Since coming into office, we have reformed the taxation scales<br />
and we will reduce taxes consistent with the proper demarndg<br />
of government. Our emphasis on~ restraining taxati6TF-5-1-sii1T~ h<br />
part of our, commitment to smaller government.<br />
We have imposed limits on the overall growth In the staff of<br />
public service departments and authorities while continkling-<br />
. to allocate additional staff where nieeded. For exanple, since<br />
we' came to office, the number of Commonwealth emplpyees in areas<br />
subject. to staff ceilings has been reduced by over 10,00.<br />
Yet, in areas where it can be shown that there is a clear case<br />
for additional staff, such &amp; s in the Department of Social Security,<br />
3,000 more peoplehave been engaged to ensure that. those in<br />
need receive the attention to which they are entitled. At the<br />
sae. time, the most rigorous tests have been applied to proposals<br />
for expenditure. However, controlling the size of the.-p41blc--<br />
sector is not just a matter of restraining st~ f f numbers and<br />
administrative costs.<br />
: 1t is also necessary to re-exami. ne the functions of government.<br />
As I announced on November 6, the Government has established a<br />
committee of senior ministers to review the functions of all<br />
Coraionwealth departments and other associated agenckez-. The<br />
review is yet one more step in the Government's continuing<br />
commiJtmnent to restrain the size of the public sector to avoid<br />
intrusion into areas of activity capable of being performed<br />
ef ficiently by the private sector, without reducing the quality<br />
of those services which are properly provided by the Commonwealth.<br />
3 Central to the Government's policy that the public sector<br />
should be reined in so as not to restrict private sector<br />
dynamism is the belief that in most cases the best results<br />
can be achieved by allowing freedom of choice in the mnarket<br />
place. For, a classic example of this econott. ic fteedoin'in.<br />
action, one need looR' n6 further than the local supermlarket.<br />
Tlhere, shoppers exercise their free choice select th-:<br />
they want demonstrate economac freedom and in that way ensure<br />
that markets provide the goods and services that they, the<br />
customers, want and thereby determining which products, stay<br />
on. the market, and which producers will prosper or fail.' Only<br />
by giving markets flexibility can Austra. ial resources be<br />
allocated in ways that give the highest returns. Only a<br />
competitive and growing economy can give returns that--'<br />
encompass profits and incomes and in this way preserve inidividual<br />
choice1 the cornerstone upon which economic freedom rests. / 4<br />

K I;, What-can a government do to create such an environment?<br />
It can, * as we have done, assist industry to replace obsolete<br />
machinery by providing investment allowances and in that way<br />
enable industry * to meet the demands of the market place.*<br />
It can'also encourage businesses to plough back its profits,<br />
as we. have done by reducing taxes on small businesses and as<br />
we are committed to do -to reduce those taxes still further.-<br />
Inl this way we enable businesses to expand,' and offer firther.<br />
* choices to the consumer,. And finally, a governmnt can enable<br />
people to determine the level of income they woald'like to<br />
receive in retirement, . as we have done by of ferinj superanrnuati~ on<br />

These are some pxamples of a liberal philosophy in actiozi, a<br />
philooophy Which the record shows, is brinigirig Auatralia back<br />
on to the road to prosperity. our commritmnent to strengthen<br />
the foundations of the economy has involvecl a constant<br />
do~ rward pressure on inflation.<br />
PAlthougti it hasn't . been painless, our su-stained fight agAins t<br />
inflation has recorded notable successes. In the -' 12 months<br />
to the Septe-mber * quarter, Australian consumer-prices rose by<br />
10.2 percent, still too much, but 2.5 percentage points les<br />

U I. You might wonder why, with employment growing so stro) ngly,<br />
the unemployment rate is not falling rapidly. The answer is<br />
I 00--<br />
4X. I<br />
In addition to -normal population growth, al greater proplortion<br />
Of the Working age popul. ation is coming back into the workfo:, Ce,<br />
lured no doubt by tIjob o-V-xtunities-ow--vailable.<br />
If the proportion of the population in the workforce ha,<br />
stayed the same over the past year instead of increasing?<br />
unemployment would have dropped by a further 96,500.<br />
More jobs are being created daily, indeed, in the-year to<br />
September 1.980, over 800 jobs were created every working day.,<br />
and we are providingextensive L iinJ P= 4z. es to help generate"'<br />
the skills needed in the jobs market of the 1980s.<br />
Although unemployment remains dispiritingly high a -concern<br />
to families and to business and government -our policies are<br />
working, we are on the right track.<br />
In puxsuing these policies, the Government is determined<br />
that the economic gaitaae~ ihn-~ laspotential<br />
are shared amongst all Australians for economric wealth is not.<br />
an end in itself. 4<br />
it is'the means whereby individuals can have the maximum<br />
choice in their way of life. it enables the community, both<br />
privately and through government-agencies, to help those<br />
who are i real need, And i t-provides a -MrmTouidation upon<br />
which future generations of Australians can build.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, those who founded thia centre had their<br />
eyes on the future. It stands as a memorial to those who had th e<br />
foresight, energy and generosity of purpoge and purse to bu il1d<br />
it and as a comm~ andrnent to those who come aftax-. to never losa,<br />
sight of the values abdTE-rdit-ons which have enabled the<br />
Jewish people to enrich every corunity of which they have<br />
been a part.<br />
David Ben-Gurion once said on a visit to Californlia,<br />
" I envy your deserts not just because they are deserts, but<br />
because you can affoxdts~ keepth* ade-serts"-.-<br />
Eighteen years ago the Jewish residents of these north<br />
eastern suburbs of Melbourne faced a aewish religious anid<br />
cultural " desert". They could not afford to keep it a. desert.<br />
Their whole' history embroidered as it was with thetar<br />
and blood of countless millions and tempered,_ like * steel, by<br />
the' holocaust cortadd-them--to akethatdesert bloom,<br />
And bloom it has.<br />
Tamile and I' are deeply honoured that you have allowed us to<br />
share-this important celebration with you. Thank you once again:<br />
for inviting us. </p>
