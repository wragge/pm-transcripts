PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 8 MARCH 1977<br />
EMBARGO: against delivery<br />
. WELCOMING SPEECH TO THE QUEEN<br />
Your Majesty, we are all delighted and honoured to have you,<br />
Queen of Australia, with us on this twenty-fifth anniversary of<br />
your accession to the throne.<br />
It is already clear, we believe, that your reign has been one<br />
of the most significant and successful in our history. You have<br />
performed your Constitutional duties with wisdom, grace, assurance,<br />
and dignity. Because of the strength and continuity which your<br />
reign has given us, it is easy to forget how great have been the<br />
changes during the past twenty-five years.<br />
Most of the former British colonies have achieved independence.<br />
The membership of the British Commonwealth has increased from<br />
eight . o thirty-six and it has proved itself with you at its head<br />
to be a significant force for peace and cooperation in the world.<br />
Australia too, has changed in that period, just as the Commonwealth<br />
is a multi-cultural group of varying traditions, we also have<br />
become a multi-cultural society. We have been enriched by the<br />
culture and tradition of large numbers of Australians, who have<br />
come from Italy, Greece, The Netherlands, Germany, Eastern Europe,<br />
Asia and elsewhere, all seeking a better and more equal future<br />
here. Australia has clearly benefitted as a result.<br />
We are a diverse nation, yet we are a united nation. Our ability<br />
to accept and adapt to change is in large part made possible by<br />
our adherence to the best of our traditions and one of the most<br />
important of those is the Constitutional Monarchy.<br />
To celebrate and commemorate your Jubilee, we wish to make you a<br />
gift. It is not a gift to be delivered to you tonight. Indeed,<br />
it might fairly be said that the gift is still a twinkle in the<br />
eye. For we, the people of Australia, are to give you a<br />
thoroughbred racehorse. W. thin the past month, a champion Australian<br />
stallion, " Without Fear", has been joined with six mares and in<br />
due course, the outstanding foal amongst the progeny will be<br />
selected, trained, and presented to you. Knowing your interest<br />
and expertise in these matters, we trust that you will welcome<br />
this gift. I hope that " Without Fear's" progeny has the ultimate<br />
success of carrying your colours to victory.<br />
I am sure that all Australians will take a keen interest in the<br />
development of the foals. </p>
<p>2.<br />
It i s an odd irony that, today. when wormen. strive for eqpuillitv<br />
in all things that we can look to Elizabeth I and Elizabeth I I<br />
as two of Britain's outstanding-monarchs. As in many othcer<br />
things, the Monarchy has given the lead to contemporary sociely.<br />
All Australians thank you for the twenty-five years past and<br />
wish you well for all the years to come.<br />
The second Elizabethan era has been superb. It has given us<br />
strength, stability and inspiration.<br />
To mark your Silver Jubilee, we intend to establish a Trust<br />
which will foster community leadership by making awards to young<br />
people. Your Majesty: the warm welcome you have already received expresses<br />
the feelings of the Australian people toward you. You arc the<br />
first Monarch to take the title, Queen of Australia we could<br />
never have hoped for better.<br />
The good wishes of all Australians are with you on this tour.<br />
