FOR PRESS 22 MAY 1977<br />
ADDRESS AT THE CENTRAL METHODIST MISSION, SYDNEY<br />
It is a great pleasure for me to be here and participate in<br />
your annual mission rally. I am particularly pleased to have<br />
this opportunity to applaud the work which your mission has been<br />
carrying out for the past 93 years, and for the innovations<br />
and ingenuity that the mission has demonstrated in caring for those<br />
in need in this city.<br />
The life-line centre, established here in 1963, and subsequently<br />
emulated in many centres around the world, has given new hope<br />
to thousands.<br />
The 23 homes, hospitals and service agencies which the mission<br />
manages throughout Sydney provide residential care for over<br />
a thousand people, and a wide variety of assistance to many<br />
others, every day and night of the year.<br />
It is developments such as these and I would add,<br />
the whole concept of operating a mission through a theatre<br />
which effectively refute the suggestion that the Australian<br />
christian churches are moribund.<br />
The Federal Government, this mission and the many other<br />
voluntary social welfare agencies in Australia, are partners<br />
in the task of providing effective and prompt help to the<br />
disadvantaged and underprivileged in our community.<br />
Our roles are complementary. There are many areas in which<br />
government services can never match the service which<br />
voluntary agencies can provide. The large government<br />
bureaucracies that are associated with social welfare often<br />
cannot by their very nature have the flexibility to meet<br />
the needs-of the poor and disadvantag~ ed in a complex industrial<br />
society. Their needs are not confined to material aid. Many people<br />
are most in need of warm and understanding advice how<br />
best to cope with the complexity of our society, to assist<br />
them in overcoming feelings of powerlessness in the face of<br />
large institutions. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
The rules which regulate government organisations limit<br />
their ability to provide the personalised assistance necessary<br />
in coping with these problems. Government organisations can,<br />
because of their size and apparent impersonality actually<br />
heighten people's sense of their inability to cope.<br />
The most personal assistance provided by voluntary organisations<br />
is essential in overcoming problems of this kind. The voluntary<br />
work which organisations such as your own undertake, has the<br />
enormous strength that it is undertaken out of a genuine<br />
and personal commitm ent to a cause, and no amount of money<br />
could buy the dedication and commitment which organisations such<br />
as this mission can mobilise.<br />
We have sought to give maximum possible encouragement and<br />
assistance to voluntary agencies with their sense of commitment<br />
and sensitivity to each individuals problems. This mission,<br />
for example, has received capital grants of $ 220,000 for two<br />
centres which assist handicapped persons the Pinaroo Hostel<br />
and the David Morgan sheltered workshop -together with<br />
substantial annual subsidies towards staff salaries.<br />
The Government has also paid over $ 40,000 towards the running of<br />
the Francis Street hostel for homeless men, and has undertaken<br />
to grant over $ 1 million for your exciting new venture a<br />
centre for the homless at Darlinghurst. This very week<br />
Departmental officers have been discussing with the mission<br />
details of the tenders received to build and equip the centre.<br />
What we must strive to achieve is-the most effective cooperation<br />
and interaction between us. We must also all be prepared<br />
to look at what our real objectives are and see that our<br />
programmes actually do serve their objectives, that they do<br />
assist those in need.<br />
For a government department, or for a voluntary agency<br />
such a seemingly sensible and deceptively simple exercise<br />
is in a practice extremely difficult. There is a tendency<br />
for programmes to continue unchanged because they are there, we<br />
are used to them, continuation does not disturb vested interests<br />
nor disrupt established work-patterns.<br />
Somtimes a programme plods on when, if subjected to impartial<br />
analysis, it should be changed, to ensure that those most<br />
in need get priority in assistance, and as the need of those the<br />
programme was designed to help, change. We have acted to<br />
redirect the thrust of a number of our programmes towards<br />
those most in need, and to ensure that such assistance actually<br />
reaches them.<br />
In the area of children's services, the programmes of the<br />
previous government were primarily directed to funding pre-schools.<br />
Yet it was clear that the most urgent need of low income families<br />
was the provision of full day care for working mothers.<br />
The failure to provide such care is to allow many children to have<br />
unsuitable care while their mothers are at work or no care<br />
at all. / 3 </p>
<p>Accordingly, we changed the direction of our programmes<br />
to give greater emphasis to the provision of full day care<br />
facilities. In the provision of legal aid, we -found that inadequate aid was<br />
being received by the poorest in our community. We acted to<br />
tighten the means test and redirect funds to those most in need<br />
of assistance. To ensure that this programme was fully<br />
effective, we increased total spending on legal aid by 23%<br />
this year.<br />
We have also made many changes in the administration of the<br />
Department of Social Security to enable it to provide<br />
a more efficient and sensitive service to its clients.<br />
These changes particularly assisted those whose circumstances<br />
were such that they needed immediate payment of benefits,<br />
and those who had difficult in obtaining benefits due to them,<br />
through problems of language.<br />
It will sometimes be necessary for government to grasp the<br />
nettle and replace an entire programmne by another more<br />
effective one. A classic example as the former system of<br />
providing tax deductions for dependent children. Such<br />
deductions could only be used by taxpayers who had sufficient<br />
income against which to set off the full deduction permitted.<br />
Significant numbers of the poorest in our community could<br />
not avail themselves of this subsidy. We acted to replace that<br />
system by a new programme of family allowances, under which cash<br />
payments are made directly to every mother in Australia.<br />
This has been of greater assistance to 300,000 poorer families<br />
with 800,000 children, including in particular many single parents,<br />
migrants and aboriginal families.<br />
A further advantage of the family allowance scheme is that it<br />
gives the mother who receives the monthly cheque complete discretion<br />
how to use the funds provided. This increases her independence<br />
and her ability to make effective choices about the welfare of<br />
her family.<br />
While making major changes we have also heeded the warning<br />
the Henderson Report offered Australian governments against:<br />
" Falling into the inflationary trap of attempting to carry out<br />
so many social reforms or other public expenditures at once that<br />
they accelerate an inflationary spiral that does more to damage<br />
poor people than the assistance provided by the reform."<br />
We have also sought to continually review the manner in which<br />
social welfare programmes are carried out. In less enlightened<br />
days, many, programmes for the poor, the sick and the homeless<br />
were well-intentioned but demeaninga for the recipients.<br />
Doling out soup through an iron grille to homeless men may well<br />
have great merit in staving off starvation for those fed; a<br />
regular weekly hand out may provide the basic necessities;<br />
but neither jin itself is sufficient to meet the needs of people<br />
for independence. What is required now are programmes which<br />
help to increase dignity and scif-resnect, which provide<br />
warm and relevant advice on how to become independent, not<br />
breed a debilitating dependence on those who provide the service. / 4 </p>
<p>Wherever necessary those benefitting from our programmes<br />
should have a choice in the way such benefits are used.<br />
Responsibility for the important decisions in an individuals life<br />
should be placed where it belongs,-with that inidividual<br />
and not with any social welfare agency or government department.<br />
It is often difficult to devise programmes which meet this<br />
objective. Governments must be prepared to experiment and<br />
exercise some ingenuity in finding a scheme that<br />
really works. I shall mention two such experimental programmes<br />
which we are presently in the course of trying out. We are at<br />
the moment preparing to launch the housing assistance<br />
voucher experiment. This programme will assist low income earners<br />
by paying to them, in cash, subsidies towards the cost of their<br />
family's accommodation. It is up to them how they use such<br />
subsidies they may rent housing commission flats, or they<br />
may prefer private accommodation. The choice and the responsiblity<br />
is left to the recipient.<br />
Another experimental programme is our migrant resources<br />
centre in Melbourne. Instead of the government bureaucracy running<br />
the centre, we have contracted out this responsibility to a<br />
voluntary organisation, the Greek Welfare Society. Early<br />
indications are that the centre is working well and that some<br />
other ethnic groups see the centre as a possible-model for their<br />
own operations.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the cooperation of voluntary<br />
associations and government provides the best basis for providing a<br />
system of social welfare that meets the needs of contemporary society.<br />
The Government has shown its readiness to try new methods of<br />
tackling the constantly changing problems in our community.<br />
None of us can afford to oppose innovation and new ideas when<br />
existing programmes are not fulfilling their desired objectives.<br />
It has been a strength of this mission that you have shown a<br />
willingness continually to rethink the work you are performing.<br />
The steady stream of new proposals which the mission has<br />
devised in recent years, such as the new Darlinghurst Centre,<br />
provides ample evidence of this. Your willingness to adapt<br />
will again be put to the test next month when, as part of the new<br />
Uniting Church, the mission changes it name and coordinates its<br />
work even more closely with the activities of the many other<br />
agencies operated by the Uniting Church. For the past<br />
years, your superintendent Alan Walker has led your mission<br />
through a difficult period to even greater strength and effectiveness.<br />
I congratulate him on his new appointment as Director of<br />
World Evangelism for the World Methodist Church, and I wish his<br />
successor every success it will be a hard act to follow.<br />
