    <content><![CDATA[<p>His Excellency the Governor General has accepted my recommendations for the following appointments to the Ministry. They are consequent upon the resignation of Senator Santo Santoro. </p>
<p>The Honourable Christopher Pyne MP will become Minister for Ageing.  He has been a hard working Assistant Minister and Parliamentary Secretary in the health portfolio and I am confident he will do an excellent job as Minister for Ageing. </p>
<p>The Government has legislation in the Parliament to improve the quality of aged care services and it is important that this program be implemented. </p>
<p>The Honourable Teresa Gambaro MP, Parliamentary Secretary in the Immigration and Citizenship portfolio will become Assistant Minister.  She merits promotion to Assistant Minister having previously been an effective Parliamentary Secretary in both the defence and foreign affairs portfolios. </p>
<p>Senator Brett Mason has proven a strong representative of the people of Queensland and has been an effective contributor in the Parliament.  He will become Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing. </p>
<p>Arrangements for the swearing in will be announced shortly. </p>
