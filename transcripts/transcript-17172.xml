    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government will invest $560 million in new or upgraded cancer centres in regional and rural communities across Australia.</p>
<p>With some cancers, patients from rural areas are up to three times more likely to die within five years of diagnosis than their urban counterparts.</p>
<p>Regional Cancer Centres will enable regional Australians to receive care closer to home and their community.</p>
<p>This initiative is central to the Government's $1.3 billion investment in improving cancer infrastructure announced in the 2009-10 Budget.</p>
<p>Cancer affects thousands of Australian families every year - 100,000 new cases of cancer are diagnosed every year, and around 40,000 people die each year from various forms of this disease.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, today led a series of announcements in new cancer and patient accommodation facilities for regional communities across the country.</p>
<p>At Townsville Hospital, the Prime Minister announced $67.5 million to enhance the Townsville Cancer Centre to improve access to comprehensive services for people in North Queensland.</p>
<p>The funding will provide three radiotherapy bunkers, two linear accelerators, a PET/CT scanner and 26 additional chemotherapy chairs. This will double the existing radiotherapy bunkers at Townsville Hospital to six, and increase the number of linear accelerators to five.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister also announced $2.6 million for Mt Isa Hospital, to provide a new building to house enhanced tele-oncology and chemotherapy treatment services and provide space for three new chemotherapy treatment chairs.</p>
<p>Other Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries will be making announcements at regional cancer facilities across Victoria, NSW and Western Australia:</p>
<p>     * The Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon is in Victoria today to announce $42 million for the Ballarat Regional Integrated Cancer Centre, $1.5 million for patient and carer accommodation in Albury-Wodonga and $9.5 million for state-wide enhancements to existing regional cancer services in Victoria, to benefit areas including Bendigo, Traralgon, and Albury-Wodonga;</p>
<p>     * The Minister for Rural Health, Warren Snowdon is in Tamworth to announce $31.7 million for the New England and North West Regional Cancer Centre;</p>
<p>     * The Parliamentary Secretary for Disability and the Victorian Bushfire Recovery, Bill Shorten is in Gippsland to announce $23.5 million for an extension to the cancer centre and accommodation facilities; and</p>
<p>     * The Parliamentary Secretary for Western Australia, Gary Gray is in Bunbury to announce $23.47 million for cancer upgrades at the St John of God Hospital and $22.29 million for strengthening regional cancer services in Albany, Northam, Narrogin, Geraldton and Kalgoorlie.</p>
<p>Each of these projects have been assessed and approved by the independent Health and Hospitals Fund Advisory Board.</p>
<p>The Government will announce the remaining successful Regional Cancer Centre projects over coming weeks.</p>
<p>Regional Cancer Centres are major part of the Rudd Government's plan to deliver better cancer care for all Australians - irrespective of where they live.</p>
<p>Last year's budget included an investment of $560 million for a network of new and enhanced regional cancer centres.</p>
<p>This investment will fund around 20 regional cancer care projects around the country - including approximately eight new regional cancer centres, seven upgrades to existing facilities, and four patient accommodation projects.</p>
<p>The Government will announce the remaining successful projects in the near future.</p>
<p>Since coming into office, the Government has committed over $2.3 billion in cancer infrastructure, medicines, screening and research.</p>
<p>Today's announcement reinforces the benefit of the Federal Government stepping up to the plate and providing funding for health services across Australia.</p>
<p>Under the National Health and Hospitals Network, the Rudd Government would provide 60 per cent of the funding for capital upgrades for public hospitals.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government's plan will see health services funded nationally and run locally to deliver better health for local communities. </p>
