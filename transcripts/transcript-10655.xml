<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Welcome Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hi Kerri-Anne  it's good to be on your show again.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Great to have you with us. Well it really is like the main event</p>
<p>   Mr Howard. It's a bit like the Melbourne Cup to me  a</p>
<p>   lot of preparation, a long, hard race. What do you think your biggest</p>
<p>   handicap will be?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I guess the reluctance of some people to change, but the change</p>
<p>   that we're offering is good for the whole country. The reason</p>
<p>   I want to change our tax system is that I believe that a new tax</p>
<p>   system for a new century will make Australia a stronger country,</p>
<p>   it will help boost our exports, it will help us compete in a difficult</p>
<p>   world environment, it will give low and middle income people more</p>
<p>   incentive to work and to save and it will just produce a fairer</p>
<p>   system all round, because I think all of your viewers probably feel</p>
<p>   deep down that the present system is unfair, it's old-fashioned,</p>
<p>   it's not working very well. We've tried to tinker with</p>
<p>   it in the past but that hasn't really fixed it up and at long</p>
<p>   last the Government has come along and given a comprehensive plan</p>
<p>   for change and I think it is, most importantly of all, it is good</p>
<p>   for the country and Australians if they think something is good</p>
<p>   for their country and they think it's fair to them, then they</p>
<p>   will back it.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>If one is using racing analogies it seems you jumped out of the</p>
<p>   barrier quite well. Reading the editorials this morning, how did</p>
<p>   you feel?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well to use a cricket analogy we've had a very solid start,</p>
<p>   we haven't lost a wicket yet and we're building for a</p>
<p>   big score. I mean the sporting analogies are very appropriate. Look,</p>
<p>   I think it's had a good reception because it's a very</p>
<p>   comprehensive plan and it's a very fair plan. We've laboured</p>
<p>   long and hard to make sure that low income people are protected,</p>
<p>   there's a lot in it for retired people and getting rid of things</p>
<p>   like provisional tax, introducing a 30 per cent tax rebate for private</p>
<p>   health insurance  those sorts of things are particularly good</p>
<p>   and it's very very good for families. But I don't take</p>
<p>   the Australian people for granted. They expect of me that I will</p>
<p>   go around the country, I'll talk to them about it, I'll</p>
<p>   answer questions about it and I'll explain the detail of it.</p>
<p>   I'm enthusiastic about it Kerri-Anne because I believe it is</p>
<p>   good for Australia and that's the main thing that's driving</p>
<p>   me. I want to devote myself over the weeks and months ahead to explaining</p>
<p>   this plan because I think if we can get this in, it will be the</p>
<p>   next thing that helps set Australia up for the 21st century.</p>
<p>   We've got rid of that big deficit, we've got interest</p>
<p>   rates at their lowest levels for 30 years, we've created 300,000</p>
<p>   new jobs over the last couple of years. The next thing we've</p>
<p>   got to do is to fix our tax system and I am really so committed</p>
<p>   to it because I think it will be so good for the whole country.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>You talk about being enthusiastic for it  it is all about</p>
<p>   the sell. Can you sell your socks off, because while you're</p>
<p>   selling a package a lot of people are seeing a new tax. Can you</p>
<p>   sell it Mr Howard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the Australian public will decide, nobody else, whether they</p>
<p>   want to support it or not. And it's not a new tax, it's</p>
<p>   a whole new system.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>But doesn't that come from an inspiration. People need to</p>
<p>   be inspired to know that this is a whole package, not just a tax,</p>
<p>   but that's what people are hearing and seeing.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Kerry Ann, I believe that the way it's been structured,</p>
<p>   that people will see it as a total plan and not just a GST, not</p>
<p>   just a tax cut, or just this or that, but that they will see over</p>
<p>   the days and weeks ahead, they will see that a government has been</p>
<p>   willing to tackle the whole thing. And I mean, we've not only</p>
<p>   re-written the tax scales, we've created a fairer system, we've</p>
<p>   given a very big boost to the bush, we've taken $4.5 billion</p>
<p>   off the cost of Australian exports. Right at the moment, the thing</p>
<p>   that Australia needs as much as anything else is to sell more overseas</p>
<p>   and if you can bring in a tax system that reduces the cost of our</p>
<p>   exports, we'll sell more of them and we'll do better.</p>
<p>   I mean they're the sort of things that we've been wanting</p>
<p>   for a very very long time and they're delivered under this</p>
<p>   system.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>But it is pretty difficult to sell it. Other people, Mr Howard,</p>
<p>   have tried before. John Hewson for instance really came a cropper</p>
<p>   when he tried to sell his tax, in fact, I'm sure you remember</p>
<p>   this very well known piece of footage. </p>
<p>Journalist: "If I buy a birthday cake from a cake shop</p>
<p>   and GST is in place, do I pay more or less for that birthday cake?"</p>
<p>Hewson: "Well it will depend whether cakes today in that</p>
<p>   shop are subject to sales tax or they're not, firstly, and</p>
<p>   they may have a sales tax on them. Let's assume that they don't</p>
<p>   have a sales tax on them and that birthday cake is going to be sales</p>
<p>   tax free, then of course, you wouldn't pay, it would be exempt,</p>
<p>   there would be no GST on it under our system. To give you an accurate</p>
<p>   answer I need to know exactly what type of cake to give a detailed</p>
<p>   answer".</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>And that detailed answer went on for a few minutes and we talked</p>
<p>   about candles and we talked about everything. What did you learn</p>
<p>   by Mr Hewson's experience.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I can tell you the price of birthday cakes will go up between</p>
<p>   2 and 4 per cent under the plan, it depends on the particular type</p>
<p>   of cake.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>I've got one right here.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It will go up by between 2 and 4 per cent but you'll have</p>
<p>   more money in your pocket with which to buy it.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>As simple as that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>As simple as that. You'll be better off because you'll</p>
<p>   get a tax cut or you'll get a pension increase or you'll</p>
<p>   get an additional amount of money through the increased family benefits,</p>
<p>   and you'll be better off and other things will come down in</p>
<p>   price. I mean a motor car for example, now carries a 22 per cent</p>
<p>   wholesale sales tax. I mean, the price of the average family motor</p>
<p>   car will come down in price and there are a lot of things now that</p>
<p>   will be cheaper, other things will be dearer. The reason some things</p>
<p>   will be cheaper is they now carry very high sales taxes which are</p>
<p>   hidden and motor cars are a very good example  22 per cent</p>
<p>   is a lot more than 10, and if you're running a business you'll</p>
<p>   have uniformly cheaper fuel. Every litre of fuel you buy to run</p>
<p>   your business will be seven cents a litre cheaper and all of that</p>
<p>   will help business operate a lot better and all of that will generate</p>
<p>   more jobs. And the tax cuts have been deliberately designed to help</p>
<p>   people in the lower and middle income area to get the greater benefits,</p>
<p>   particularly if they have children.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>There are so many aspects to this package it is difficult to try</p>
<p>   and analyse them today but for instance did you and your people</p>
<p>   look at other examples and their applications of this type of tax</p>
<p>   , for instance, New Zealand. Did you look at how that worked there</p>
<p>   and what the hiccups might have been?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, we looked to some degree, but every country is different.</p>
<p>   I mean we have designed a tax system for Australia, to take Australia</p>
<p>   into the 21st century. We're not slaves to any particular</p>
<p>   overseas model, but we knew that if you wanted to get a proper indirect</p>
<p>   tax system that was fairer than the present one, it needed to apply</p>
<p>   to virtually everything. I mean it won't apply to doctors'</p>
<p>   bills or dentists' bills, it won't apply to child care,</p>
<p>   it won't apply to nursing homes or retirement hostels or to</p>
<p>   hospital treatment. It won't apply to that. It won't apply</p>
<p>   to education, it won't apply to child care  those things</p>
<p>   are out of the question. You've got to have virtually everything</p>
<p>   else in otherwise you are really left with the inadequacies of the</p>
<p>   present system.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Do you think you will be surprised, as New Zealand was, and they've</p>
<p>   said how they underestimated the enormous revenue from the black</p>
<p>   economy, do you think you'll be surprised?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There's no doubt in the world the Australian tax payer will</p>
<p>   benefit from the cash economy being brought into the net of the</p>
<p>   GST - there's no doubt about that and in New Zealand that was</p>
<p>   the experience and I'm certain the same thing will happen here</p>
<p>   in Australia. One of the reasons we're able to provide people</p>
<p>   with personal tax cuts is that under the new system, people who</p>
<p>   are now escaping through loopholes and through the cash economy</p>
<p>   will be caught up and the money they now have to pay  which</p>
<p>   they should have been paying in the past  can help pay for</p>
<p>   your tax cuts.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>And when the electorate, who has heard in the past, L-A-W law,</p>
<p>   we've heard non-core promises, the electorate is cynical, do</p>
<p>   you think that's fair that we should be cynical?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there is a difference between this and L-A-W law. L-A-W law</p>
<p>   referred to the fact that before the 1993 election Mr Keating promised</p>
<p>   tax cuts and opposed a GST. After he was elected, he took aways</p>
<p>   the tax cuts and he put up indirect taxes, which was his own GST.</p>
<p>   On this occasion, I'm laying out in front of the electorate</p>
<p>   before the election my proposal for a total tax change, including</p>
<p>   a GST, and there's a very, very big difference.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Well, Mr Howard, thank you very much for your time. You've</p>
<p>   got an enormous schedule ahead of you and we do appreciate your</p>
<p>   moments with us on Midday.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thanks for having me. Very nice to talk to you again.</p>
<p>KENNERLEY:</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, the Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard.</p>
<p> ENDS</p>
