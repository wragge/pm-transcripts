    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the Australian Government will contribute $25 million to assist in the building of the new grandstand on the old Hill site at the Sydney Cricket Ground.  The Federal Government expects the NSW Government to fully match its contribution.</p>
<p>The SCG is one of the finest sporting venues in the world.  The new grandstand, which will replace the Doug Walters Stand and fill the void between the Churchill and O'Reilly Stands, will make the SCG even better by improving spectator facilities and increasing ground capacity.</p>
<p>The SCG has a long and proud history.  It has played host to a number of significant national sporting events, including the 1938 Empire Games, now the Commonwealth Games, and Australia's first rugby union international against Great Britain in 1899.  </p>
<p>It has also witnessed a number of Australia's greatest cricket moments and this month hosts the last Test matches of Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Justin Langer.</p>
<p>I am pleased that the Australian Government will be helping to ensure that the SCG remains a world-class venue for national and international sporting events.  </p>
