TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, ORIENTAL HOTEL,<br />
SINGAPORE, 17 OCTOBER 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Malcolm Fraser went through last night<br />
on his way to Kuala Lumpur exuding confidence about<br />
winning the election for Secretary General. Is he<br />
being a bit too optimistic<br />
PM: No, I believe that, as I've said, that Mr Fraser<br />
is slightly in front. I thought that before I came.<br />
The discussions that I've been able to have since I've<br />
been here have confirmed that impression.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think the vote will wait for the<br />
Langkawi retreat, or do you think that<br />
PM: That's a matter that needs to be discussed when we<br />
get there. Expressing my own view, let me say I think<br />
it would be better from the Commonwealth's point of<br />
view and I'm not just saying in terms of our<br />
interests but I think it would be better from the<br />
Commonwealth's point of view if the matter were decided<br />
from the outset, because otherwise it seems to me that<br />
it would just permeate the conference right through;<br />
there'd be lobbying going on and I think even the<br />
contributions of some people on particular issues may<br />
be coloured by their perceptions of how it may affect<br />
the vote and so on. I wouldn't think anyone's<br />
interests are served by delaying it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is your feeling that as a whole the<br />
African countries would show a general leaning towards<br />
General Anyaoku?<br />
PM: You would assume that, if you look at it in<br />
regional terms, there would be a tendency for the<br />
Africans to want an African, and that's understandable<br />
I believe,. generally speaking. But the facts are that<br />
there isn't a solid block of African support for the<br />
Chief, and we know that we have some African support.<br />
I think that has two elements of significance. First, </p>
<p>2<br />
( PM Cont) just in a straight numbers sense, that there<br />
are some votes in Africa. Secondly, I think that that<br />
fact of itself will have an influence on some others.<br />
There would be some I believe who would take the view<br />
that if there was a total African consensus, that that<br />
is something that would have to be taken into account,<br />
but the fact that some Africans would be supporting Mr<br />
Fraser would make them feel that they are free to cast<br />
their vote for the one they think in all the<br />
circumstances is the better candidate, that is Mr<br />
Fraser. JOURNALIST: Do you believe a secret ballot would in<br />
fact help those Africans who want to support him, to<br />
vote for Mr Fraser<br />
PM: Let me make this point; I think there is<br />
absolutely no question that it must be a secret ballot.<br />
I think any alternative is absolutely unacceptable<br />
because in the end it is only in a secret ballot that<br />
people can be absolutely confident in expressing the<br />
real view that they hold. Secondly, that we all want<br />
and if this sounds something of a paradox I know but<br />
in the end we want something which, if not being a full<br />
consensus, is close to a consensus in that if there is<br />
a secret ballot and one or the other wins, then we all<br />
want to be able to say, " Well that's it, and we are all<br />
behind the outcome". I've made it quite clear, and I<br />
repeat from Australia's point of view, that if there's<br />
a ballot and the chief wins then he has Australia's<br />
unqualified support, and we will say so and we will<br />
mean it. Now it's much easier for every Head of<br />
Government to take that position after a secret ballot.<br />
It's somewhat more difficult if you've actually got a<br />
show of hands, and that person shows his hand up for<br />
the other bloke, and that person had his hand up for<br />
the person who wins, it's much more difficult in those<br />
circumstances for you know, the reality of a consensus<br />
position to be taken.<br />
JOUNRALIST: As to financial sanctions against South<br />
Africa, do you believe the British will support you in<br />
this?<br />
PM: I haven't had the opportunity yet of talking to<br />
Margaret Thatcher, and I'll obviously be talking to her<br />
up there before the matter comes on. I just want to<br />
repeat the broad position. I think it would be<br />
churlish not to recognise that some change has occurred<br />
with the new President. It just would be churlish not<br />
to recognise that fact. But on the other hand the<br />
fundamentals have not changed, and what I would hope we<br />
could do would be to recognise that the changes that<br />
have occurred which ought to be recognised, have not </p>
<p>( PM Cont) emerged by accident. In my judgement, they<br />
have emerged because there has been pressure, pressure<br />
from the Commonwealth basically but from others as<br />
well. I think what the Commonwealth has to do is to<br />
try and convey to the regime in South Africa that what<br />
has happened is but a beginning and that there has to<br />
be a commitment to fundamental change to the move<br />
towards a democratic, non-racial South Africa. That's<br />
the objective, that's what has to be achieved, and our<br />
very grave responsibility as a meeting of Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government is to take account of all the facts<br />
and to so formulate our decisions that we maximise the<br />
earliest possibility of a move towards such a<br />
democratic, non-racial South Africa.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has your suggestion of an early resolution<br />
of the Secretary General's issue, has that fallen on<br />
fertile ground with the talks you've had in<br />
PM: Of the people to whom I've spoken the logic of<br />
that has recommended itself.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, if that takes place Mr Hawke, when<br />
would you expect the ballot to go ahead?<br />
PM: Well, I don't wish to pre-empt what the decision<br />
will be. What I'm doing in response to your proper<br />
questions is indicate what the most logical'position<br />
is. Neither Chief Anyaoku or Malcolm Fraser are<br />
advantaged or disadvantaged it seems to me by having<br />
the decision taken at the outset by a secret ballot.<br />
The Commonwealth on the other side is advantaged by<br />
being able then to go ahead and consider all its other<br />
important items without this matter overhanging. I<br />
just hope that the logic of that would would recommend<br />
itself to my colleagues. But I want to listen to what<br />
they have to say, if there is some argument that they<br />
may have that hasn't occurred to me against that, well<br />
I'll be open to hearing that argument.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, if I could change the tack<br />
slightly. Are you concerned of John Kerin's criticism<br />
of the Kakadu decision?<br />
PM: London Convention, comrade. London Convention,<br />
L-C-C.<br />
JOURNALIST: London Convention if I asked you if you<br />
have a'comment on Dr Hewson's attack on the press for<br />
the coverage of the tax policy.<br />
PM: I hope I won't sound sexist in this, but I find<br />
your attempt to break the London Convention somewhat<br />
more appealing and compelling than old Peter Harvey up </p>
<p>( PM Cont) the background, but I am non-sexist, I<br />
haven't got one rule for an ugly old fellow and another<br />
one for a beautiful young lady. The London Convention<br />
still applies.<br />
JOURNALIST: How did your talks go this morning, Mr<br />
Hawke PM: The talks I've had now I've been here less than<br />
twenty four hours they've been very, very productive.<br />
I've found them very useful.<br />
JOURNALIST: How much attention will this Cole<br />
Ovenden Report get here, at CHOGM?<br />
PM: It will obviously get a very considerable degree<br />
of report, it deserves to because it is the product of<br />
a very great deal of hard, intelligent work and it's<br />
recommended itself to a wide range of people and it<br />
will obviously receive a great deal of attention.<br />
JOURNALIST: much support for the Antarctic<br />
initiative at the CHOGM meeting?<br />
PM: Well, it's not of itself going to be a major<br />
issue. The environment in general will be, and<br />
obviously within our consideration the environment,<br />
we'll make a reference to that, but it won't as I say<br />
of itself be a major issue I think. Thank you.<br />
JOURNALIST: Thank you Sir. </p>
