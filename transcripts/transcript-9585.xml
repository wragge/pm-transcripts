TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH AT LUNCH HOSTED BY THE AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF<br />
MANAGEMENT, PERTH, MONDAY, 15 MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
I very much welcome the opportunity to talk to you as most of you are<br />
members of the Institute and to talk about the economy and the growth<br />
prospects we find ourselves with and the, Budget. Because, this is an<br />
important Budget, they are all important but, I think, this is particularly<br />
important given the fact that we have succeeded in engendering quite a lot of<br />
growth back into the Australian economy and the aim of the game is now to<br />
keep it going at a sustainable rate, with low inflation and so that we can reach<br />
our target which we have set for ourselves of five per cent unemployment by<br />
the year 2000.<br />
That means a lot of investment and a lot of investment means a call on<br />
savings. Part of our problem has been, for many years now, that because in<br />
the 1970s the increase in wages and costs, the broken profits of the period<br />
and the big call by the public sector right through the 1970s dislocated<br />
Australian private investment. We ended up for a decade, with a very low<br />
level of investment and so that hole in the capital stock meant that we have<br />
never ever got beyond the period since where we can grow at more than<br />
about four and a half per cent without the demand spilling into imports. We<br />
can get the economy up and running and it is really quite fast for a western<br />
style economy such as Australia to grow at four and half to five per cent. But<br />
after that, we get a spill into imports, and that is because there is not enough<br />
plant and equipment, not enough strength in the capital stock for us to be<br />
able to grow at five and six per cent and yet satisfy the production here in<br />
Australia. So, the aim of the game from here on is to add to that capital stock. Now, we<br />
have got a big boom in investment in the late 1980s, in the second half of the<br />
1980s, but not all of it went into plant and equipment. Quite a lot of it went<br />
into central business district towers, office towers and other things which<br />
have been sub-economic and it is only now that they are starting to fill up and<br />
(! t </p>
<p>starting to produce a rate of return. In other words, we carried a big call on<br />
our savings for not a commensurate increase in our productive capacity.<br />
Now, this time it is different. You will notice that plant and equipment<br />
investment in the last year was running at around 26 per cent. In the last<br />
Budget we put the forecast in at 14 per cent. All the pundits said ' oh, too<br />
optimistic, Budget built on all this optimism'. It turned out the rate of growth in<br />
plant and equipment was about twice what we estimated and the economy<br />
grew by even more than the Treasury had estimated. So, we are now seeing<br />
a very large investment phase, but this time it is going to be adding materially<br />
to our productive capacity where as the late 1980s cycle didn't so do.<br />
The aim of the game now is to keep it all going and to keep that additional<br />
capacity coming into our capital stock so as to bring unemployment down to<br />
five per cent. This is a particularly important economic and social objective<br />
because Australia has, I think, one of the opportunities, let me say it has<br />
been one of the few countries in the world, where we have a quite fully<br />
employed society and where we are more cohesive as a society, where our<br />
values are as intact as they can be, that is our egalitarian values, and that we<br />
move along as a society together. That the policies of inclusion matter and<br />
that we regard it as a matter of national importance and national policy that<br />
we have as many people getting a right to a job as possible. These were the<br />
tenets we put together in One Nation in 1992, but indeed they have been the<br />
policies we have followed since 1983. That is, there has always been a<br />
premium on growth and on employment.<br />
This is not true of many countries. In western Europe, employment is the<br />
number that falls out the bottom of the system, it is a residual. And, the<br />
growth is also a number that happens to fall out the bottom of the system.<br />
Government's don't target growth. If you look at the West Australian<br />
economy it is growing even more rapidly than the national economy and that<br />
is because the whole of national economic policy is focussed towards growth<br />
and the states that have had the tariff monkey lifted from their back, that is<br />
Western Australia and Queensland are growing even faster than the national<br />
economy. I was in Lower Saxony, Germany, about a month ago, this was where we had<br />
the CeBIT fair and Australia was the guest country at the largest technology,<br />
electronics fair in the world, and the Premier of Lower Saxony, Premier<br />
Schroeder, met me and he was saying, we were having a talk about his<br />
economy. He said ' look, we have got tremendous community spirit in Lower<br />
Saxony. Everybody puts their shoulder to the wheel, it is a community effort.'<br />
He said ' we are facing big problems because the main industry of the State is<br />
Volkswagon at Wolfsburg and because of the continuing productivity of the<br />
motor industry we are getting more output for fewer people. So, we have all<br />
decided to work a four day week, the whole of the State is working a four day<br />
week.' I said to him ' but, why don't they pick up other jobs, I know you<br />
employment growth isn't what ours is, but isn't there enough?' He said ' well,<br />
we have only got, basically, three quarters of one per cent employment </p>
<p>growth'. Now, in the last year in Australia we have had 4.2 per cent<br />
employment growth. We have had four to five times as much and that is why<br />
we have actually got a chance now. We have seen unemployment come<br />
down from 10.5 per cent to just over 8 per cent last week and we are<br />
forecasting 8 this year, but we want to get to five per cent by the year 2000.<br />
That will mean that this country is stronger, socially it will be much stronger<br />
and, of course, there will be much greater levels of wealth. But you all know<br />
in this room, that employment comes from investment and investment comes<br />
from a set of variable which include profits, return on capital, the level of the<br />
inflation rate, the competitiveness of the exchange rate, it comes from all<br />
these things and it comes from national savings. The central point of last<br />
Tuesday's night Budget was to improve and augment national savings.<br />
When I first started speaking to you I talked about that 1970s problem of a<br />
dislocation of private investment. What happened in the 1970s is the public<br />
sector spending at the Commonwealth level went out from 23 per cent to<br />
about 27 per cent under the Whitlam government and they went from 27 per<br />
cent to 30 per cent under Malcolm Fraser and John Howard. When I became<br />
Treasurer in 1983 Commonwealth Government spending was 30.5 per cent<br />
of GDP and the year I resigned the Treasury it was at 23.5 per cent. It was<br />
down 7 percentage points of GDP which in today's dollars is about $ 30-35<br />
billion a year.<br />
But, that big call in the 1 970s meant that it, essentially, suffocated the<br />
capacity of Australian business to borrow and to invest. Now, you know, that<br />
one of our principal problems now is that we are running a current account<br />
deficit, on average, of around 4.5 per cent of GDP. At the moment it is<br />
running around 5.5 per cent, but it averages around 4.5 per cent in the 1980s<br />
and early 1990s. In the 1960s and 1970s it averaged around 2.5 per cent,<br />
but then we had no debt. We had no debt because every year we had<br />
private capital investment equal to about 2.5 per cent of GDP. In a country<br />
this big there is always something going on whether it is ports, wharfs,<br />
railways, mines or whatever it might be, manufacturing industry, and there is<br />
always a level of private equity investment. That generally equalled our<br />
current account deficit so, we could go on running a current account of about<br />
per cent of GDP, but not build up any debt. What has built the debt up for<br />
Australia is that extra two percentage points of GDP which is $ 10 billion a<br />
year in today's dollars. GDP is about $ 500 billion, 2 per cent of it, is as I said<br />
earlier, around $ 10 billion.<br />
The problem and the challenge for us is to put in a savings change to meet<br />
that two per cent and this is what we did last Tuesday night and in the doing<br />
of it, making higher rates of investment in the future sustainable, higher rates<br />
of growth sustainable and higher rates of employment sustainable. You<br />
remember Ralph Willis saying that we went from a deficit of 2.8 per cent of<br />
GDP to a Budget surplus of $ 700 million. The shift overall is around, if we<br />
look in the next year or two out, the shift is around about four per cent of<br />
GDP. In other words, we are in surplus this year, next year we are in even </p>
<p>larger surplus, the year after that we are running a surplus of $ 7 billion. So<br />
basically, we have got a change there of about four percentage points of<br />
GDP and I will just do this little bit of arithmetic with you because there are a<br />
lot of numbers in this, but it is quite easy to follow. The savings problem is<br />
two per cent points in size. So, we have got to get a two percentage points<br />
fix into the system. We have got, essentially from the Budget, a four<br />
percentage point change and then the other great change in the Budget was<br />
to build on the reforms we had introduced in earlier years to award or national<br />
superannuation. This, I think, we can genuinely say is the most<br />
comprehensive savings change or plan the country has ever had.<br />
You know that the Government, in 1985-86 under the Accord Mark V, we<br />
introduced there three percentage points of savings by the workforce, of<br />
income put away as savings in superannuation or as we called it ' award<br />
superannuation'. That was moving up towards five per cent when we<br />
introduced the superannuation guarantee charge or the SGC as it is known.<br />
That takes contributions by employers on behalf of employees under the<br />
wage arrangements, up to nine per cent of wages and salaries by the year<br />
2002. But, I think, most of you in this room would know, to get a mature<br />
contribution to superannuation, something that adds a very substantial long<br />
term benefit to retirement incomes, you need to be around about 15 per cent<br />
of a wage and salary.<br />
In the Budget we did two things. We said that we will be supporting the<br />
inclusion and awards of three per cent of employee contributions and we will<br />
pay the second round of the One Nation tax cuts into the same<br />
superannuation accounts. So, in other words, as a result of last Tuesday<br />
night's budgetary change, there will be a further six percentage points of<br />
wages on top of the nine which exists under the Superannuation Guarantee<br />
Charge. Put the two together and you have got fifteen. So, by the year 2002<br />
everyone in the country will be putting 15 per cent of their wages and salaries<br />
away. This is going to produce an enormous shift in savings. When John<br />
Dawkins and I were sworn in as Ministers in 1983 we had $ 40 billion in<br />
superannuation funds. This year we have got $ 186 billion and by the year<br />
2020 the Treasury estimates we will have $ 2000 billion. We will have $ 2<br />
trillion in superannuation funds by 2020.<br />
Our national debt at the moment is $ 160 billion. Already we have a greater<br />
level of savings in superannuation at $ 186 billion, greater now than our<br />
national debt, but that will grow. This will do a number of things about<br />
retirement incomes. Let's take someone on average weekly earnings now on<br />
$ 33,000, at the end of their working lives, they will build in today's dollars a<br />
lump sum of $ 470,000 and they will have an ongoing annuity in retirement of<br />
$ 30,000 a year. So, they are on $ 33,000 a year now, in 1995-96 dollars, they<br />
will have $ 470,000 as a lump which payed out as an annuity ends up at<br />
$ 30,000 a year. Someone on twice average weekly earnings, around<br />
$ 60,000, will end up with a lump of $ 670,000 and an ongoing annuity<br />
payment of $ 52,000 a year. </p>
<p>So, this is a great change to retirement incomes and to savings. When my<br />
generation, the baby boom generation, is 65 there will be half as many retired<br />
aged people as there is today and 10 years after that or 15 years after that<br />
there will be twice as many retired age people as there is today. The problem<br />
will then be; how does the cohort at work carry this huge group of people, this<br />
aged group in retirement at that point without an erosion of the basic pension<br />
or a massive change to taxation levels? Well, there is only one way start<br />
now to put a scheme together. We started in 1985-86 and what you are<br />
seeing on Tuesday night, in a sense, is the culmination of those changes with<br />
another six percentage points added. This is not simply a great change in<br />
social policy, but it is also a great change in savings.<br />
Let me go back to the calculation, the two percent again. Remember I said<br />
the current account is two percentage points of GDP, larger than we can<br />
afford it to be. We have put a four percentage point change in on the Budget,<br />
but that savings pool from superannuation is going to be worth four<br />
percentage points of GDP by 2020. So, by 2020 we have got an eight<br />
percentage point change in four in the Budget, four on superannuation but<br />
the problem is more immediate than 2020. So, let's say, look at it in the year<br />
2000, which is what we in this room are immediately interested in. Where is<br />
the current account going to go in the year 2000, five years from now. In five<br />
years from now those superannuation changes will be worth two percentage<br />
points of GDP, the Budget will be worth four. But by then, some of that four is<br />
cyclical, some of it is structural. If the cycle changes at any time and the<br />
cyclical part starts to turn down, let's say ' let's put a discount into that and call<br />
it two to three per cent'. Two to three per cent on the Budget and two on<br />
superannuation. That comes to four to five per cent and that is what we did<br />
last Tuesday night. We put a four to five per cent of GDP savings change in<br />
for a two percentage point current account problem.<br />
That is why the Budget is so central to the maintenance of this recovery<br />
because the recovery can only be built on investment and we can't have the<br />
investment without the savings otherwise it will spill over into overseas<br />
savings, into overseas borrowings, into overseas debt.<br />
So, the Budget in that sense, was a great change and one that is designed<br />
to, you remember in the latter part of last year we had three quick interest<br />
rate adjustments and that slowed the economy off from the growth rate of<br />
then 6.5 per cent which was unsustainable back to something around four per<br />
cent which is what we have now. In other words, we don't need this Budget<br />
to restrain domestic demand. What we need this Budget for is for a medium<br />
term change in savings because we have got the slowing from the monetary<br />
adjustments. As a consequence, last year we sold $ 21,000 million worth of<br />
commonwealth bonds. The bond selling program was $ 21 billion. As a result<br />
of the Budget changes, the bond selling program this year will be $ 6 billion.<br />
So, there is a $ 15 billion reduction this year over last year in the bond selling<br />
program. You know you don't have to be an econometrician or a financial<br />
market person to know that if you take $ 15,000 million of demand off the<br />
Australian savings pool, there is going to be a lot less paper around than </p>
<p>there was therefore if there is less of it, the price of it rises and if the price<br />
goes up with the bond the yield comes down. The yield, of course, is the<br />
interest rate.<br />
So, as a consequence of the Budget, the bond market fell by one percentage<br />
point. From just over 10 to just over nine for 10 year bonds in the last week<br />
or so and that is the cue, I think, that some of the other people the banks<br />
and others have taken in the financial markets. In other words, by getting<br />
the Budget back into surplus quickly and decisively, we have taken an<br />
inordinate pressure off the financial markets which is reflecting itself in that<br />
shift in bond yields. In other words, what the Government is after is<br />
sustainability. We have had three years of growth since the recession. The<br />
Treasury in Statement Two is forecasting sustainable growth for three years,<br />
for three years out. In other words, if we take three years from now we are<br />
talking about 1998, if we look from 1983 to 1998 we will have had growth<br />
right through the period bar for 18 months which was in 1991-92, in the<br />
recession. It is going to be a very long period of growth, but after the<br />
recession, of course, low inflationary sustainable growth and not pushed<br />
along by a bubble of bank lending and indiscriminate lending of the kind we<br />
saw in the later 1980s, now a far more abstemious financial sector with low<br />
inflation, secure profits, a much more flexible labour market with enterprise<br />
bargaining; in short a much more sustainable level of growth into the future.<br />
That is what the Budget was about, but it was not just about that change in<br />
the balance, but as I said, that huge change in savings coming of<br />
superannuation. Now, I have got John Howard running around the country<br />
talking about chicken little, the sky is falling in, we have had five minutes of<br />
sunshine, la de da de da. But, the truth of the matter is we have already had<br />
three and a half years of growth and the Treasury is saying we will have<br />
sustainable growth around these levels through the forecast period and the<br />
forecast period is 1995 to 1998. So, after the recession, we have had three<br />
and a half years of growth and we are heading for six. We had 90,000 job<br />
growth last month. We have had the largest fall in unemployment in the last<br />
year since we have been keeping the records. The Government's principle<br />
commitment in the election was to reduce unemployment. We said we would<br />
aim for a target of 500,000 in three years. Well, in two and a quarter years,<br />
we are already at 650,000. We got to the half a million mark in two thirds of<br />
the time that we thought and not only that, we are now reaching into the long<br />
term unemployed because 100,000 of them have gone back into the labour<br />
market or where in any such period in the 1980s maybe only 10,000 would<br />
have gone back into the labour market because what happens, when the<br />
labour market picks up the school leavers the new entrants to the workforce<br />
go into jobs, those who are longer term unemployed generally get left behind.<br />
But, Working Nation, that statement I introduced on behalf of the Government<br />
last year, the case management and labour market programs is now getting<br />
into the long term unemployed, getting them trained and giving them a job<br />
subsidy and getting them back permanently into the labour market. </p>
<p>This is going to mean, where in the 1980s with all that growth we got<br />
unemployment down to about 6.5 per cent, but we couldn't get any lower no<br />
matter how hard we pushed with employment, we couldn't get any lower<br />
because we couldn't train the people. Working Nation is actually going into<br />
that body of long term unemployed people and training them and getting them<br />
back out so that means that the five per cent unemployment target becomes a<br />
real possibility for us.<br />
In western world terms, there are very few countries with that prospect facing<br />
them. That is, to be able to say we would be able to keep up higher rates in<br />
investment and higher rates in employment. Because if we need to fill that<br />
capital stock I first mentioned we would need even greater levels of<br />
investment than we have today. It is not just today's investment levels, but<br />
something greater than today's. That is going to call on savings and that is<br />
why we needed the Budget change and the superannuation change together<br />
because if we are to relieve that pressure on the current account, we are not<br />
just simply relieving it in a static scenario. We are relieving it, but as we<br />
relieve it we will then build up greater demands for investment because the<br />
confidence effects will be greater, the needs for employment will be just as<br />
great and so as we get more successful success breeds success and so<br />
we will have even more investment. We have got to be able to pay for that in<br />
savings too. So, we needed a big change, a really big change in Tuesday's<br />
night Budget and that is what we gave you a large change on the Budget<br />
balance and a large change in superannuation.<br />
All of this, I think, means that as we move down towards the year 2000 we are<br />
going to be able to see a further great change to the nature of Australia. This<br />
is the first time in our history where we have been located at the foot of the<br />
fastest growing markets in the world. Normally, for us, traditionally for us,<br />
those markets have been in Europe or North America. They are now here at<br />
our doorstep in the Asia-Pacific and to have that great opportunity we have<br />
got to be stripped down, competitive and be in a position to go and get after<br />
it. But you can't get after it without investment and you can't get after it<br />
without investment if you are relying on the rest of the world for savings.<br />
Can I just say there is a lot of gloomy stuff around about savings and you can<br />
see how the Government is taking it seriously, but we are taking it<br />
constructively. We are not out there with slogans and with incantations. We<br />
are in there with some serious policy. But, I think, you need to remember we<br />
have got $ 160 billion of off-shore debt, but in the period since the<br />
Government removed exchange controls in 1983; you see before 1983 you<br />
couldn't invest off-shore, the Reserve Bank wouldn't give you the tick under<br />
the managed system to invest off shore. But in the period since 1983 to now,<br />
we have now got $ 135 billion of off shore assets. So, we have got $ 160<br />
billion of net debt, but we have got $ 135 billion of off shore assets. So, you<br />
look at all these big companies like BHP and Boral and Brambles and the<br />
TNTs of this world, they have all invested in North America, in Europe, in the<br />
Asia-Pacific, and as a consequence we have now got a very large stock of<br />
investments off-shore. </p>
<p>So, all these things have taken in the minds of the financial markets when the<br />
assess Australia. They don't just look at our current account debt, they look<br />
at our assets off shore, but they more importantly, look and see what we are<br />
doing in the longer run about savings. They say ' is this a serious country?<br />
Yes, it has broken the back of inflation, but it got itself into a whole in the<br />
1970s. Has it got itself out of it? Has it done the things to add to savings and<br />
keep its competitiveness up.' Now, I think, after Tuesday night the answer to<br />
that is a resounding yes. But, it wasn't just Tuesday night. It was also the<br />
1993 Budget which John ( Dawkins) presided over as Treasurer and took a lot<br />
of stick for in getting fiscal policy back into shape at that time and it was the<br />
Budget's in the 1980s where we pulled, as I said, outlays down from 30.5 per<br />
cent of GDP to 23.5 per cent.<br />
Tuesday night was a big change in Australian public policy for the<br />
maintenance of a long-run, low inflationary, high investment recovery. So,<br />
when Richard Court tells you it is happening because the buses are running<br />
on time or it is happening because he has got some project starting, all that<br />
helps but it is principally happening because of the national government's<br />
policies. It is principally happening because of the change in<br />
competitiveness coming off the exchange rate, wages and productivity and<br />
we are just signing up another Accord with the ACTU which will maintain<br />
moderate wages growth into the future and protect that inflation rate. It is<br />
worth remembering that Australia, today, is 40 per cent more competitive than<br />
1983. Not 4 per cent or 14 per cent, 40 per cent. That is why Western<br />
Australia is growing so strongly. It is coming off the big wage adjustments of<br />
the 1980s which turn that big nominal depreciation of the exchange rate into<br />
a real depreciation. I like the States we are doing quite a lot with the States<br />
now at COAG, you can see it with the Hilmer changes I like the States to do<br />
well. Victoria is starting to go ok and there has been some sensible things<br />
done in fiscal policy there.<br />
But a Lloyd Webber show and Grand Prix is not going to remake the Victorian<br />
economy any more than making the buses run on time or ticking off real<br />
estate developments is going to change things here. What is going to<br />
change things is the big pulse of national public policy. The only thing that<br />
ever changes anything and when you look at the Government, people say<br />
' well, you have been in office 12 years, don't you think it is time for a<br />
change?' I say ' what other government would be putting a savings change of<br />
this quality and this dimension in, having this conversation with the workforce<br />
to get people to put 15 per cent of their income away as savings, what other<br />
government has done that? What other government has been able to break<br />
the back of inflation and keep it there by the introduction of an enterprise<br />
bargaining system in the labour market?' I have mentioned John a couple of<br />
times, the last thing I did was on Friday was open another university at<br />
Sunbury in Victoria. In 1983 only three children in ten completed secondary<br />
school. This year it is eight in ten and we have added, as that eight in ten,<br />
that massive through put has spilled out then into tertiary education, we have </p>
<p>added about 65 per cent of places to universities in a big revolutionary<br />
change in the 1980s which John ( Dawkins) presided over.<br />
As a consequence, we have established about 18 universities of the size of<br />
the principal state universities to the system and we are now building, in One<br />
Nation, the TAFE system through the Australian National Training Authority<br />
so that vocational education sits up beside tertiary education to provide the<br />
horse power for the product innovation Australia is going to need to<br />
participate in this world economy and to participate to the full.<br />
I have got John Howard chasing around yak, yak, yak, yak on radio stations<br />
around the country. I have got Costello like a crow on a fence carking at<br />
every, picking the eyes out of every bit of good news that comes along and<br />
Howard saying ' well, you know, test my credibility with the Prime Minster's.' I<br />
say ' but hang on, what are you talking about? What have you ever done?'<br />
Does anyone know of one thing that John Howard did as Treasurer that<br />
mattered, seriously to this economy except other than increasing the levels of<br />
outlays to GDP? I mean, he is now trying to remake himself by denying all<br />
the policies he was associated with in the 1980s when he was Opposition<br />
leader. I said ' well, hang on, I have been around during this period with a<br />
Cabinet that has international ised the Australian economy, which has<br />
changed its competitiveness by 40 per cent, which has revolutionised the<br />
product markets, which as knocked the tariff wall over, which has totally<br />
changed the face of Australian education, which is now changing the culture<br />
of Australian management. We have had 50 per cent, we have nearly<br />
doubled exports. Exports were at 13 per cent of GDP, they are now at 22 per<br />
cent. That is what we have been doing and we have had 26 per cent<br />
employment growth since 1983.' When you talk about credibility, you are<br />
talking about someone who has got another set of things on the other side of<br />
the ledger to compare himself with. But there is this side of the ledger and<br />
then there is that side of the ledger. There is nothing else other than a few<br />
empty incantations. Howard has only had three policies.<br />
One is throwing tax benefits up to top end families. The other is kicking the<br />
life out of low wage earners below about $ 24,000 a year. I mean, what a<br />
great objective to have in public life. Say ' well, I want to get after those<br />
characters on $ 23,000 a year and shake the living hell out of them.' And, the<br />
third thing is to put in a GST. They are his three policies. They have never<br />
been any different. The same three. He had a chance on Budget night to get<br />
up, we are within a year of an election, he had the Budget reply to get up and<br />
say ' hang on, there is the Government, it has put down this big change in<br />
savings, big change in the Budget balance, they have introduced Working<br />
Nation, Creative Nation et cetera, this is what I think should the be shape and<br />
nature of Australia.' Nothing, just a bucket of abuse, a bucket of rhetoric and<br />
in the end nothing else.<br />
So, I don't believe the Australian people looking at this recovery and its<br />
quality, not just the recovery, but the low inflation high productivity nature that<br />
it has, and the linkages this government has made in Asia with APEC or our </p>
<p>role in the GATT, are going to walk away and say ' well, here we are with what<br />
has been the fastest growing western world economy with low inflation, we<br />
will turn our back on that for John Howard, Tim Fischer, Peter Costello and<br />
Alexander Downer that sparkling front bench of theirs that sparkling little<br />
front bench of theirs. And now, of course, we have got Dr Nelson who has<br />
been in the Labor party for 17 years, that is his claim to fame. The Liberal<br />
party these days is like a business club. You join at the door. They say ' oh,<br />
you want a safe seat in Parliament, ohh come in, come in. You want to be a<br />
member of parliament in one of our best constituencies, just step this way.':<br />
opportunism and brigandry, the stock and trade of a party without any guts<br />
and without any substance.<br />
The message I want to give to you is this that this is a very large savings<br />
change coming from a government which has fundamentally altered the<br />
nature of Australia to an externally orientated competitive trading economy,<br />
but where when we let our guard down in the 1970s and let our capital stock<br />
drop and at the same time with double digit inflation, punctured a whole in the<br />
propensity of Australians to save, we have tried to repair the problem by the<br />
public sector coming back strongly into surplus and making up for those<br />
paucity in private savings by a set of savings arrangements through<br />
superannuation which will guarantee us a lift in savings when we really need<br />
it.<br />
That is why, I think, the Budget was well received and why I hope you think<br />
that it is a good document and one that will sustain the recovery into the<br />
future. Thank you.<br />

<p>QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION<br />
Q: Prime Minister, in light of the recent Karpin Report ( Enterprising<br />
Nation), can you comment on how you rate Australian managers now?<br />
PM: The old tariff barriers, the tariff walls produced a lot of easy profits and<br />
when we had a less discerning securities market and stock exchange,<br />
boards of directors could get away with over valued assets or under<br />
valued assets and, essentially, modest profit performances. There<br />
was not a lot of pressure for distribution of dividends, but most of the<br />
manufacturing sector was protected by the tariff walls, its profits came<br />
from the tariff walls. This produced a lot of sloth in the structure of<br />
management in Australia and this has changed, of course, in the last<br />
years or so with the tariff barriers coming down, with development<br />
for the first time, really, of a sector of internationally traded services<br />
which we have, and until we removed exchange controls, ever had and<br />
that development has meant that we have developed whole new<br />
sectors in the financial services, in education services, tourism, et<br />
cetera which did not exist and they are internationally traded services,<br />
so you have to be internationally competitive to be in it. The mining<br />
industry had international competitive pressures on it because it had to<br />
sell into an international market place against other countries, but most<br />
of the manufacturing, of course, was protected by tariffs.<br />
Like everything else, competition is a great thing and competition<br />
works and much of what the government has done over 15 years, over<br />
12 years is to introduce competition by way of imports with lower<br />
tariffs, by way of competition generally in Australia, by now getting the<br />
State and Commonwealth sector utilities out there and competing,<br />
introducing competition into things like airlines and<br />
telecommunications and what have you and by and large the<br />
opportunities to success particularly in the turnaround of our<br />
competitiveness and also the pressure which has come from the<br />
recession has produced a lot of productivity changes and a great sea<br />
change, I think, in management.<br />
I think David Karpin was talking about not simply an improvement in<br />
management, the capacity to manage, but also in genuine<br />
entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship got a bad name in the 1980s<br />
when we had the world awash with money and people borrowing it,<br />
buying up assets for, largely, non-productive purposes. That is not<br />
what we have always thought that an entrepreneur was about. We<br />
thought an entrepreneur was about building industries and building<br />
businesses and seeing opportunities in market niches and exploiting<br />
them. I think we are developing a class of managers and<br />
entrepreneurs now as we are going about. I think, any commentary I<br />
want to make is we haven't got enough of them and we need more<br />
such people and, I think, the fact that the country is now so open and </p>
<p>so near particularly South-east Asia that we are seeing South-east<br />
Asian entrepreneurs coming to Australia and our entrepreneurs going<br />
there and this flux that this is setting up is producing a more<br />
entrepreneurial spirit in Australia because I certainly believe we need<br />
it. You will always need the people to make the business decisions to<br />
make the world go round and we have tried to give business an<br />
environment in which to do that. High profits, a competitive exchange<br />
rate, a competitive country in all, a competitive tax system, all of these<br />
things are important as back drops to that sort of essential<br />
entrepreneurial activity.<br />
So, I think, David Karpin's point is yes, it has improved a lot, but of<br />
course, we all know it had to, but we have still got quite a way to go<br />
and I think I endorse that too.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, last week I saw Cheryl Kernot's comment that of the<br />
billion worth of asset sales that were projected for this year only<br />
million had in fact been achieved. Is that in fact correct and how<br />
confident are you that the $ 5.5 billion projected for next year will in fact<br />
also be achieved?<br />
PM: I am fairly confident because we have floated some of these larger<br />
assets off in the past. We sold a quarter of the Commonwealth Bank<br />
in 1991, I think it was, then we sold subsequently another quarter of it<br />
and that is by far and away the biggest of the sales and now, of<br />
course, it is a company listed on the stock exchange and it is priced<br />
every day and part of the arrangements that we are now making with<br />
the Commonwealth Bank Board is that the Board's considering<br />
purchasing some of the shares back so that it makes the digesting of<br />
the sale even easier to the market. So, I think, that is something that is<br />
well within our grasp. Qantas was to be in this year, we have been<br />
improving Qantas's underlying profitability and picking the right<br />
moment to sell it. It is not just a matter of saying ' well, we had it in for<br />
last year'. It is a matter of whether we sell an asset, but we pick the<br />
right moment in the market to actually sell it and, I think, we are better<br />
off selling it this year than last and that was a judgement we made<br />
about the middle of last year and at the same time its underlying<br />
profitability is improving. So, I don't think there is a problem there.<br />
They are the main ones, and of course, next year we will have some of<br />
the airports.<br />
So, we have had, I think, a reasonably successful period with asset<br />
sales. If we don't sell them often it is because we take a decision to<br />
delay them for market reasons not because we can't sell them or in<br />
same way we have misjudged the quantities or amounts. By and<br />
large, they are fairly conservative estimates. But, can I just say that<br />
next year, the Budget is in surplus without the asset sales anyway.<br />
The quality of this change here is such that free of asset sales, the<br />
Budget will be in surplus anyway. But, as a person from Moody's </p>
<p>made the point on the radio last week, it doesn't matter whether the<br />
asset sales are in or not. He said all we look for is the bottom line.<br />
And, the reason they look to the surplus and not try to disaggregate it<br />
is for the reason I said earlier, $ 21 billion worth of bonds we sold last<br />
year, this year we will be selling $ 6 billion. It doesn't matter what the<br />
source of it is, we are going to be selling $ 6 billion not $ 21 billion and<br />
therefore the pressure off interest rates only is so much more obvious.<br />
I think, that is what the financial markets will be looking for. The main<br />
thing for us is that we have got the Budget comfortably back into<br />
surplus and we reckon next year we will be running a surplus of about<br />
$ 4.1 billion and the following year we will be running a surplus of<br />
around $ 7 billion.<br />
Q: Mr Keating, let's suppose Treasury gets it wrong in respect of forecast<br />
on growth and the numbers aren't quite so big as they are forecasted<br />
and let's say the weapon of superannuation doesn't yield the<br />
difference of two per cent that is needed for the savings, how does<br />
your Government plan to address next year, subject to you being in<br />
power, of course, the balancing of the Budget once the national assets<br />
have been sold off?<br />
PM: I thought I answered that in the previous question. That is, next year<br />
without the assets we will still be in surplus, but we are in surplus on<br />
rates of growth which are far less than the ones we have had at the<br />
moment. You see, in the year to September, when the September<br />
quarter national accounts came out for the year to September, the<br />
economy was growing at 6.5 per cent. We had 8.5 per cent for gross<br />
national expenditure and 6.5 per cent for GDP. Because spending<br />
was greater than product, it was spilling into imports and we know that<br />
we know that we can't sustain a rate of growth around 6 1/ 2 per cent of<br />
GDP. Well in this year we are forecasting 3 3/ 4 per cent. That is a<br />
long way from 6 1/ 2 per cent, you see. So we have already got a very<br />
heavy change in there. We have portended, forecasted, quite a heavy<br />
reduction in activity as a consequence of those monetary adjustments<br />
late last year. So, by and large, these are, at their best, only forecasts<br />
and forecasts can be wrong. But, by and large, these ones now in a<br />
growth phase, there is less risk to them in a growth phase and as well<br />
as that they are quite conservative. So I don't really see that we run<br />
any great risk of those numbers not being achieved.<br />
At any rate, the superannuation changes are already in place. I mean<br />
on 1 July this year, the metre ticks over to 6 per cent. So the large<br />
companies will be paying 6 per cent in, another 1 per cent in on super<br />
and the smaller companies then turn over at 5 per cent. From the year<br />
1 July 1997-98, we start the 1 percentage point change on employee<br />
contributions from superannuation and in 1998/ 99 we'll be putting in<br />
the first 1 per cent from the tax cuts away. So you know there is going<br />
to be a fairly big kick along to savings in all of this, even if to the<br />
decimal point the Treasury estimates were not to be achieved because </p>
<p>what has happened to us in this last year is we have hugely<br />
succeeded them.<br />
I mean in last year's Budget debate they were saying oh, oh, oh, the<br />
Government's got this very upbeat assessment of 14 per cent for<br />
investment. Well as I said to you earlier, we did 26 per cent this year<br />
and we have come out of the year greater than our growth forecasts.<br />
So, by and large, I think we have taken the conservative side of the<br />
estimates.<br />
Q: Mr Keating a lot is said of us, or Australia, being part of Asia Pacific<br />
and competing with Asia Pacific. But it seems to me that the company<br />
tax rate is going from 33 to 36 per cent, while the company tax rates in<br />
our competing countries in South East Asia are actually decreasing.<br />
Could I have your comments on that please?<br />
PM: Well, I mean, I think Singapore is around 33 per cent, where we were<br />
last year until we put this change through. I mean that is the sort of<br />
general level of rates in this part of the world. But most of these<br />
countries are not running an OECD style economy, you know, with a<br />
general quality of services we have in a continent this large.<br />
You see one thing worth bearing in mind here is that we are now the<br />
second lowest taxed country in the western world. We are a decimal<br />
point higher than the United States, who are the lowest, and we are<br />
also the second lowest spending country of the 27 member states of<br />
the OECD. We are the second lowest by a decimal point, again,<br />
above the United States. So we are delivering a lot of high quality<br />
services in health, education, roads, transport for a fairly small public<br />
sector. But a number of things have changed in the revenue equation for us.<br />
It was for good policy reasons that we wore away the tariff wall.<br />
But that loss of customs duty is this year costing us $ 5-6 billion and<br />
next year will cost a full $ 6 billion and it will have an ongoing cost of<br />
$ 6-7 billion a year, every year, because we are just not getting the duty<br />
because the barrier doesn't exist anymore.<br />
The company tax change from 39 per cent to 33 per cent, the two<br />
investment allowances and the accelerated depreciation package<br />
which I had in that statement Investing in the Nation which we<br />
published in February 1993 is now costing the Budget $ 3 billion a<br />
year. So if we are losing $ 6 billion a year on tariffs and $ 3 billion on<br />
companies, that is $ 9 billion, and Bass Strait is now running down<br />
quite dramatically, quite sharply, at those very large, formerly efficient,<br />
performing reservoirs in the Gippsland Basin are now into a secondary<br />
recovery. So we are losing about a billion a year, over the last five<br />
years, out of that. So you can say with just those changes alone, we </p>
<p>are losing $ 10 billion a year or 2 per cent of GDP. Now it has got to<br />
come from somewhere.<br />
So what we decided to do was to put the company tax rate to<br />
36 per cent, which is still well and truly competitive within the OECD.<br />
In fact, it is on the bottom of the OECD, sort of, band of rates and still<br />
reasonably competitive with the countries we trade with in Asia.<br />
The other thing that I think is worth bearing in mind, is that Australia is<br />
one of the few countries in the world which provides for dividend<br />
imputation. We actually let private companies distribute and we give<br />
them an imputed credit for the company tax paid. This is also now<br />
delivering a benefit to shareholders of the order of $ 3-4 billion.<br />
So, at the last election those great lions of business in the Liberal<br />
Party wanted to stick the company rate up from 39 per cent to 42 per<br />
cent. We have reduced it from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. So in the<br />
last year they would have had a 42 per cent company rate, we had a<br />
33 per cent company rate and we are moving it to 36 per cent. So, in<br />
other words, we are getting from companies $ 300 million this year and<br />
$ 1500 million next year.<br />
In the climate of very high profits, the profit share in GDP, the<br />
proportion of national income going to profits this year, has no historic<br />
precedence. So if the companies can't pay another 3 percentage<br />
points on the company rate, who can? I mean the people on wages<br />
under $ 30,000. I mean who is it? And so that is why we have thought<br />
it was the right thing to do.<br />
Q: ( inaudible).<br />
PM: Well APEC has a certain congruity to it. It is the countries who have<br />
trading and strategic interests together and it is in the Pacific rim, it is<br />
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation. It covers the two largest<br />
economies the United States and Japan who have, of course, a huge<br />
trade problem between them. It covers the largest emerging economy,<br />
China, and it covers some of the fairly developed economies, like<br />
Korea and, of course, the South East Asian, or ASEAN, economies.<br />
Now from Australia's point of view, we trade with Japan. They are our<br />
largest trading partner. Korea is our second largest trading partner.<br />
We have a fairly big trade with the United States. We have strategic<br />
relationships with the United States. The United States has strategic<br />
relations with China, with Korea. So there is a congruity about APEC.<br />
And I think the risk always with APEC is that it gets extended on a sort<br />
of good-neighbourly basis, so well why not let the old Soviet far east<br />
in. You know, the Russian far east, or India, or Peru. Well I think we<br />
run the risk then that it is neither one thing nor another. It is not an<br />
Asia Pacific body and these are countries that don't have the </p>
<p>preponderance of their trade with the Asia Pacific. So I think it would<br />
be wise for APEC to be fairly cautious about its membership into the<br />
future for that reason.<br />
Can I just say on the point about this other proposal, the East Asia<br />
Caucus proposal. I mean I think our view has been that ASEAN is an<br />
obvious sub-group of APEC and we are now having discussions with<br />
the leaders of ASEAN about Australia, at some point, having a role<br />
with AFTA, the ASEAN Free Trade Area, and in that way you would<br />
have NAFTA being a sub-group of APEC, that is the North American<br />
Free Trade Agreement. You would have Australia/ New Zealand CER<br />
being a sub-group of APEC. You may have, potentially,<br />
Australia-AFTA being a sub-group of APEC and then you would have<br />
the other bloc economies, China, Korea, Japan.<br />
So we think that sort of structure, basically, covers off the trade and<br />
strategic interests in the area and I think, by and large, that has been<br />
the view of most of the member states of APEC.<br />
Q: ( inaudible).<br />
PM: The question was for those who couldn't hear, it was about tax treaties<br />
with Asian neighbours to avoid convoluted tax arrangements. Well,<br />
you know, Australia we did have a foreign tax credit system. But in<br />
such a system everyone has to account the rates of tax let's say<br />
they are an international company. They have got companies in<br />
Europe, companies in North America, businesses in Asia. You have<br />
got to take the tax rates that apply in all these, aggregate it, bring it<br />
back, we give you a credit for it and then you pay up to the corporate<br />
rate or not.<br />
When we reduced the company rate to 39 per cent, it was so close to<br />
the average of the OECD countries some at 38 per cent, some at<br />
36 per cent we thought we would remove this huge burden on<br />
business of keeping this constant accounting going for<br />
1 or 2 percentage points of difference. So we developed what we call<br />
a white list of countries. If you invest in the countries which are on the<br />
white list, you can bring your dividends home, no foreign tax credit<br />
system, simple repatriation. If you are not on the white list, you are on<br />
the other list, and the other list of countries which includes tax havens.<br />
But in some countries which have very concessional corporate tax<br />
rates and they have them for development reasons, we have a concept<br />
called tax sparing and in our double tax agreements, we recognise tax<br />
sparing. For instance we recognise tax sparing with Malaysia, we<br />
recognise it with Indonesia.<br />
In other words, if somebody wants to invest in those countries and take<br />
the benefits of their concessional rates for a particular period of time, </p>
<p>17<br />
then we will give them a tax sparing credit. But if they want to invest in<br />
Hong Kong and it is just a name on the wall of an accountant's door,<br />
we have an active and passive income test.<br />
So if you're Pioneer Concrete and you have been in Hong Kong<br />
making concrete for 36 years, you pass the active income test. But if<br />
you're pushing income through Hong Kong and you are just a plate on<br />
a Hong Kong accountant's door, well then you don't pass the active<br />
income test and therefore we tax you on an accruals basis when you<br />
come home. Now what can be fairer than that?<br />
