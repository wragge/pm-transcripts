The Government has today commissioned a White Paper on Australia in the Asian Century. </p>
<p>The shift of economic and strategic weight to Asia has never been more rapid or more profound for Australia's interests than it is now.</p>
<p>The White Paper will provide a national blueprint for Australia at a time of transformative economic growth and change in Asia. It will help Australia navigate the Asian Century  -  to seize the opportunities it offers and to meet the challenges it poses.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Paper will consider:</p>
<p> * 	the current and likely future course of economic, political and strategic change in Asia, encompassing China, India, the key ASEAN countries as well as Japan and the Republic of Korea;<br />
 * 	the domestic economic and social opportunities and challenges of the Asian Century for Australia;<br />
 * 	opportunities for a significant deepening of our engagement with Asia across the board, including in the economy, science and technology collaboration, clean energy, education, business-to-business and people-to-people links and culture;<br />
 * 	the political and strategic implications of the Asian Century for Australia; and<br />
 * 	the role of effective  economic and political regional and global cooperation.</p>
<p>Dr Ken Henry AC, former Secretary of the Treasury, will lead the project, which will be informed by extensive public consultation. </p>
<p>The White Paper will lead to specific initiatives for implementation during this term of Government.   The White Paper will also provide a framework for medium to longer-term policies to increase Australia's engagement with Asia and maximise the economic and other net benefits to Australia of the Asian Century.</p>
<p>A Committee of Cabinet will be established to oversee the development of the White Paper.  This committee will include external advisers.</p>
<p>The White Paper will be considered by the full Cabinet in the first half of 2012 and will be released during the middle of the year.  </p>
