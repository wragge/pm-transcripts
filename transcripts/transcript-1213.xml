FOR PRESS P. M. No. 96/ 1965<br />
DEAMTH OF VICE-ADMIRAL SIR HASTINGS HARRIEGTON<br />
Tribute by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies<br />
The death of Sir Hastings Harrington, so<br />
unexpected, is a great loss.<br />
After distinguished service in the Royal<br />
Australian Navy, Admiral Harrington entered upon his duty<br />
as Australian Commissioner-General to the Montreal Exposition.<br />
This, I know, he found tremendously interesting, and in my<br />
last discussion with him little more than a week or ten<br />
days ago, he was in his usual acute frame of mind, and<br />
there was certainly nothing to suggest what lay ahead.<br />
His service to Australia will be his lasting<br />
memorial. To his widow and family, I extend the sympathy<br />
of every member of the Government,<br />
CANBERRA, 17th December, 1965. </p>
