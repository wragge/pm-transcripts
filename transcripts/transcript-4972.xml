PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 27 FEBRUARY, 1979<br />
INTERVIEW WITH-MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, MR. PEACOCK<br />
FROM ABC'S<br />
Question: Mr. Peacock, would you concede that today's statement had a<br />
strong pro-Chinese emphasis?<br />
Mr. Peacock:<br />
I would not concede that at all. There is no need to concede it.<br />
We :' ve called, in the statement, for China to withdraw from Vietnam<br />
which has been a consistent attitude of ours reflected in all<br />
our statements. To the extent that we have been able to identify<br />
common interests with China in the region, we said we want to<br />
involve ourselves with China and that shouldn't be forgotten<br />
either. Question: But you have made it quite clear in the statement that you<br />
see the causes for the current conflict being in the treaty between<br />
Vietnam and the Soviet Union and Vietnam' s invasion, as you call it,<br />
of Kamnpuchea?<br />
Mr. Peacock:<br />
I'm saying that these, in the Chinese mind, were what incited<br />
the Chinese into Vietnam. It doesn't justify the invasion though.<br />
Question: H-ow much was today's statement influenced by the future of<br />
Australia's trading relationship with China?<br />
Mr. Peacock:'<br />
It wasn't in mind at all.<br />
Question: What was the intent, then of today's statement?<br />
Mr. Peacock:<br />
The intent was just as it has been seen, by everybody but yourself,<br />
namely, to give an appreciation of how the Australian Government saw<br />
events unfolding throughout the world. Very significant changes<br />
through the change of Government in Iran, through the events that<br />
have occured in Africa, through the instability in areas surrounding<br />
Iran and then moving across to our region, IndoChina and what<br />
occured in both Kampuchea and Vietnam. / 2 </p>

Question: How much effect do you think your statement is going to have on<br />
the two parties involved in the dispute in SouthEast Asia at<br />
the moment?<br />
Mr. Peacock:<br />
This is only one element of what the Government has been doing.<br />
The primary aim of the statement was not to have a direct effect,<br />
an immediate effect on the parties itself. It was to inform<br />
the Australian people. So far as our overtures to Vietnam<br />
and China are concerned, they have been carried out both in the<br />
United Nations and our discussions when the Ambassador was here<br />
and in Hanoi, and through our own missions in Hanoi and our<br />
mission in Peking.<br />
Question: In real terms, how much do you think we can achieve?<br />
Mr. Peacock:<br />
I have indicated in the statement, we can't have a pivotal role<br />
in solving this, but I have indicated because the events are<br />
occuring in our own region, we have a duty to play some forward<br />
role in trying to restrain parties from broadening the conflict<br />
and that's been the nature of the aim of the Government<br />
throughout. 000---</p>
