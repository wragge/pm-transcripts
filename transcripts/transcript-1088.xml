FOR PRESS AIR-LINES DISPUTE<br />
Statement by the Prime Ministter t. he J nHo. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
As certain legal aspects of the current air-lines<br />
dispute in New South Wales are before the Court, I will<br />
confine myself to the political differences. Commonwealth<br />
Ministers have met State Ministers in an attempt to secure<br />
agreement. By courtesy of the Premier, I have had a conference<br />
with the Commonwealth Attorney-General and the State Attorney-<br />
General, in order to clarify my own mind as to the nature of<br />
certain differences of interpretation of the judgments in the<br />
recent air-lines case.<br />
In the result, and after Cabinet discussion, I now<br />
state the attitude of the Commonwealth Government.<br />
Vle think that our first duty is to ensure the<br />
safety, efficiency, and regularity of air navigation as a whole<br />
in Australia. le do not think that this duty can be performed<br />
by looking at one service in isolation, as if no adjoining<br />
or intersecting services existed. If effective control of<br />
air navigation and i high record of safety are to be maintained<br />
in relation to a complex of international, interstate and<br />
intra-state flying services, we be. l. ieve that it would be<br />
completely unsound to look at each type of service separately,<br />
as if the others did not exist, or to deal with individual<br />
services within one of these classifications as if other<br />
individual services did not exist. In the public interest,<br />
there must be somre overall pattern and regulation.<br />
; e think that this is true in relation to New South<br />
Wales intra-state services, which have as one terminal the<br />
Kingsford Smith Airport at Miascot, which is also the principal<br />
airport for international services and a main airport for<br />
inter-state services.<br />
The paramount interest to be served by the New<br />
South sales intra-state air services is that of the people<br />
in the country and in provincial cities and tons. Each of<br />
the two competing intra-state services, Ezst-West Airlines and<br />
Airlines of has played its part in serving that<br />
paramount interest. '! hatever re-arrangement of routes may<br />
be made from time to time should be so made, within the limits<br />
of safety and efficiency, as to enable each to carry on<br />
profitably and thereby maintain its operational efficiency.<br />
To solve the proolem, we beiieve that a completely<br />
objective and co-operative approach is essential.<br />
To this end, we have proposed that a Commonwealth<br />
expert and a State expert should confer with each other, with<br />
a right in them to appoint an umpire in case of differences<br />
of opinion. The object of the conference would be to survey / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
and allocate various routes and services, and to bring in<br />
recommendations to both Commonv. realth and State Governments.<br />
For our part, we will stand ready to accept these recommendations,<br />
As every facility would be provided for speedy investigation<br />
and conference, we should be able to anticipate a result within<br />
two months. The Government of New South iales has, as I<br />
understand it, not rejected the conference idea outright but<br />
makes acceptance of it conditional upon East-Mest flying a<br />
service between Sydney and Dubbo meanwhile. This the Commonwealth<br />
is not able to grant. For its part the Commonwealth<br />
would prefer that pre-existing arrangements should be restored.<br />
This would mean that over the projected period of the<br />
conference, Airlines of New South ales,-the holder of the<br />
Commonwealth licence for the route, would fly a direct service<br />
between Sidney and Dubbo as it has ( until recently) done for<br />
many years. The Government of New South Jales has been reported<br />
as wishing us to agree to a proposition that, in the meantime,<br />
each of the two co-mpanies should take turn, month and month<br />
about, in conducting the Dubbo service.<br />
Our advice is that this is not practicable, since<br />
the movement in and out of staffs and facilities involved<br />
would be grossly expensive and wasteful, and could scarcely<br />
be regarded as giving effective results to the people of<br />
Dubbo, who are primarily concerned.<br />
Under these circumstances, we cannot accept this<br />
proposal. But we repeat our own, and hope that, in the<br />
interests of all concerned, it will be accepted and acted<br />
upon with all expedition.<br />
CANBERiA,<br />
4th April, 1965. </p>
