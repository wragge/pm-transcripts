Press Statement No. 548<br />
27 August 1975<br />
NEW MEMBERS OF* THE AU'STRAL'IA COUNCIL AND * ITS'CONSTITUENT BOARDS<br />
The Prime Minister today announced the names of<br />
new members orf the Australia Council and its constituent boards.<br />
Mr r/, Iitam said that on 30 June 1974 he had<br />
implemented the principle of an annual rotation of membership<br />
for the new orcanization and normally one third of the membership<br />
positions would have been filled now. When the Australia-Council<br />
Act was proclaimed in March last, however, it was necessary for<br />
the members to be appointed immediately to the Council and<br />
Boards. Because of the need to preserve some continuity of<br />
experience in the Council and Boards at that time the Prime Minister<br />
had invited those members who were due to retire on 30 June 1975<br />
to accept re-appointment to 30 June 1976. However, some members<br />
had been unable to continue and a number of vacancies had occurred<br />
in the Council and on the Boards.<br />
The Prime Minister said the new appointments included<br />
people who had put their names forward in response to a public<br />
request by the Council for people wishing to serve in this way.<br />
He expressed his thanks to the many hundreds of people who had<br />
offered their services and said these names would be kept on a<br />
permanent register f or future reference when new vacancies occurred.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that he wished to express his gratitude<br />
to the retiring members. " Without the generosity and enth'usiasm<br />
of these people we would not have succeeded in generating-the I.<br />
degree of activity and wide interest in the arts which have become<br />
apparent over the last two-and-a-half years."<br />
