PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 6 SEPTEMBER 1979<br />
OPENING OF CANEGROWERS' EXECUTIVE BUILDING<br />
INNISFAIL, QUEENSLAND<br />
Australia is moving ahead. I would like for a moment or two<br />
to try and put into perspective the progress that I believe<br />
we have made over the last three to four years, because<br />
sometimes the changes are not well understood.<br />
Factory production is up more than four per cent over the past<br />
year. Profitability is up right around Australia. It could be<br />
better, but it has improved significantly over previous years.<br />
Private foreign investment for the last year was the best since<br />
1971-72. There are so many things to be done in Australia<br />
that I welcome foreign investment, especially in partnership<br />
with Australian concerns.<br />
In the June quarter, prospective expenditure approved by the<br />
Foreign Investment Review Board totalled $ 1,400 million of new<br />
investment and new proposals being undertaken in this country.<br />
That is a record for one quarter. It shows that other people<br />
are prepared to show their confidence in the well being of<br />
the Australian economy with their dollars. In one sense that<br />
might be the most substantial vote of all.<br />

some for bad. I think everyone wanted an increase in<br />
beef prices.<br />
I don't know that anyone thought they would rise quite as much<br />
as they did. Obviously there are inflationary consequences.<br />
No one really wanted the increase in oil prices but then<br />
no one foresaw the political turmoil in Iran which has cut<br />
2 million barrels a day from world oil supplies.<br />
While there are these increasing inflationary pressures here,<br />
they are overseas as well. Before, when inflation around<br />
the world started to move up, Australia compounded the<br />
inflationary problem, and our inflation rate became worse than<br />
most OECD countries. Now we are significantly better placed.<br />
Inflation in the United States, on the basis of the last<br />
. six months projected onto an annual bas'is would be growing<br />
at about 14%. In the United Kingdom it is over' 15%. The OECD<br />
countries are just a fraction under 12%. Australia is at<br />
around John Howard has made it quite plain that there<br />
will be upward pressures in the last part of this calendar year;<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
and, then, on the advice available to us, the downward thrust<br />
should reassert itself throughout next year. That is the<br />
ad'vice we were given and that is the basis of present planning.<br />
But I do believe that Australia has contained better than most<br />
countries, the increased inflationary pressures that are so<br />
damaging for farmers and exporters. 1l1hereas before, our<br />
inflation became worse than the averaccs in many other countries,<br />
now it is significantly lower. While that remains, the<br />
competitive position of our exporters, of our primary producers<br />
and of our manufacturers, will continue to improve. Another<br />
way of looking at this is by comparing the rate of price<br />
acceleration in Australia with that in other countries. In<br />
the United States inflation is rising at the rate of 28%;<br />
in the United Kingdom it is 38%; in the OECD area as a<br />
whole, 26%; Germany up to 92%; and Australia TIhat is a<br />
better performance than most, and one that we ought<br />
to recognise.<br />
Farm unit costs in 1974/ 75 which I can well remember,<br />
better as a farmer than as a politician, because they hurt<br />
very much as a farmer increased by 30%. In 1978/ 79, in<br />
spite of some problems, farm unit costs increased by 7%<br />
overall, and that is the lowest increase since 1971/ 72.<br />
As a result, the dollar has strengthened. Competitiveness<br />
has been restored. We were able to award against Australian<br />
and wider competition a contract to a Cairns firm for the<br />
building of patrol boats. That is a wonderful thing.<br />
Two years ago Defence put forward a proposal to pay $ 70 to<br />
million for a major supply ship for the Navy, built<br />
in France. we said, look what about Australian firms; to<br />
which the response was that it would cost so much more and<br />
the subsidy would be enormous. We said, well find how much<br />
it will cost, see how much the subsidy would be, because we<br />
would be prepared, if necessary, to give some subsidy to<br />
0 Australian firms. A short while ago Jim Killen received the<br />
tender price from Australian firms, from Vickers, and no<br />
subsidy was needed. It can be built for millions of dollars<br />
less than the world's best.<br />
it is time we understood that we can do these things in this<br />
country. We can compete with the best; and we can very<br />
often beat the best competition from any nation. If we<br />
understood that better, we might have more pride in our own<br />
achievements the kind of pride that is exhibited by the<br />
Canegrowers in erecting this building and showing confidence_<br />
in the future of your own industry.<br />
I have already been talking about what is going to work for<br />
this country what will provide employment for this country:<br />
becoming more competitive; being able to sell more; being able<br />
to have our rural industry more profitable, and our manufacturing<br />
industries being able to compete in world markets. These are<br />
the kinds of initiatives that can provide the jobs and<br />
* opportunities that Australia needs.<br />
over the last twelve months, civilian employment has risen<br />
more than 60,000, * the first increase * in civilian employment<br />
. for a long while. There are a number of reasons for it<br />
including major new investments.-* In coal there has been </p>
<p>-3-<br />
announced 2 billion dollars worth of investment<br />
in the committed or final feasibility stage of<br />
development around Australia, much of it in tLhis State. In<br />
bauxite, alumina and aluminium there is $ 4 billion of<br />
investment in the firmly committed or firna ;: cdibil. ity stage<br />
with another $ 2.7 billion in the cx,:-lir. at ion stage. Now<br />
these investment developments occurriLng right across Australia<br />
are providing tremendous opportunities for employment for<br />
many thousands of Australians. This again is the result of<br />
policies which make us very competitive, which have Australia<br />
moving forward with confidence.<br />
But there are some undesirable aspects and dangers ahead. I<br />
have mentioned inflation. I have mentioned the need to create<br />
jobs of the right kind. There are some dangers that have been<br />
caused by international developments. We did not foresee<br />
what was going to happen in Iran. We'cannot, with any<br />
guarantee, say that there will be continuing political stability<br />
in oil producing and exporting countries. But I do believe<br />
that the pressures that have occurred '.. ave been better contained<br />
in Australia than many other places, to the advantage of<br />
Australian exporters and primary producers. The last Budget<br />
continues the application of these policies.<br />
Sometimes we are accused of not restraining Government<br />
expenditure. In the few years before 1972 it grew at just<br />
under 5% in real terms and I thought that was too much. After<br />
1972 it grew by an average of more than 10% in real terms<br />
reaching 25% in 1974-75 and I am certain that was too much.<br />
over the last three to four years it has grown by less than<br />
one per cent a year this is all in real terms. I think it is<br />
the first time that expenditure has been controlled by the<br />
Commonwealth in that way maybe in the history of the<br />
Commonwealth. It is certainly the first time in a couple of<br />
decades. There have been staff ceilings imposed on the growth of the<br />
0 Public service and rigid control over Government expenditure,<br />
although in one or two important areas we have had to provide<br />
additional funds. This year alone there is $ 280 million<br />
more for Defence, because Defence needs more money spent on it.<br />
Many people in North Queensland would share that view<br />
Ten years ago, there were 176 social security beneficaries<br />
for every 1,000 people in the workforce. Today there are<br />
276 for every 1,000 in the workforce. That is largely a<br />
function of an ageing population, even though we are a young<br />
country. Nobody has suggested that the payments to those<br />
people should be cut merely because they are a larger burden<br />
on those who do work. Nevertheless, additional sumns have<br />
to be found.<br />
The Budget deficit as a percentage of the gross domestic<br />
product is estimated to be under 2% this year. This is a<br />
lower percentage than Japan, the United Kingdom or Canadaand<br />
the lowest percentage for many years in Australia. It is<br />
important for a country to live within its means. You cannot<br />
go on borrowing excessively year after year. A4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
The reduction in the deficit, as a percentage of what we<br />
produce the gross domestic product means that the<br />
borrowing requirement of the Government to meet the gap<br />
between revenue and expenditure, is less than it has been<br />
for many years. That puts less pressure on interest rates<br />
in the market. That is one of the reasons, I believe,<br />
why the business and financial world has accepted the last<br />
Budget so wholeheartedly as something that will take Australia<br />
forward with strength. It is one of the main reasons why the<br />
Budget has truly been accepted as an anti-inflationary Budget.<br />
There are aspects in the Budget which are designed specifically<br />
to support industry and to build on past years. The taxation<br />
arrangements for small companies, for private companies, have<br />
been modified, with the retention allowance increased over<br />
. the period of this Government from 50% to 70%. Anyone<br />
running a private company will not have missed the importance<br />
of that. Export expansion grants have been vastly increased,<br />
from $ 20 million to $ 170 million. Part of that increase is picking<br />
up a backlog in payments. A large part of it, however, is<br />
because of the increased competitiveness of Australian exporters<br />
getting out into markets which earlier they had thought were<br />
quite beyond them. These, again, are the signs of a growing<br />
and strengthening Australia. If manufacturers can get irnto<br />
the world markets, it means they have to produce more. If<br />
they are going to produce more, it means they will employ more;<br />
and that again is what we want. Many of our policies are<br />
designed to achieve just that objective.<br />
For the rural community, the anti-inflationary thrust of the<br />
Budget is one of its most important aspects. But it does also<br />
provide additional support for rural industries. It is worth<br />
noting that in effect the special depreciation allowance for<br />
storage facilities for grain, hay or fodder has been<br />
re-introduced and farmers will understand what that means.<br />
I well know that rural industries w~ ould want those special<br />
0 depreciation allowances re-introduced to cover the wider range<br />
of investments that were possible on previouqs occasions. But<br />
on. top of what we have done through<br />
tax averaging, through income equalisation deposits, through<br />
the Primary Industry Bank that has been operating so<br />
successfully we have provided the speciall depreciation<br />
allowance in the limited area which I mentioned. The water<br />
resource programme is being expanded this year and that is<br />
important.<br />
Energy and the problem of oil and oil pricing has been mentioned<br />
today. Because it is so important, and because I am also<br />
a primary producer and I do understand what it means, I want to<br />
take a moment or two to explain why I believe that we are<br />
following the only policy that is possible. I do not withdraw<br />
from my invitation at the outset; if there are views that you<br />
and this industry want to put to us, I would want to listen<br />
to those views. </p>
<p>But there is a reason, there is a purpose, an objective behind<br />
the energy policy, which we are certain is in the best interests<br />
of Australia and of Australials energy users. There are three<br />
main aspects of this policy: Conservation, the development of<br />
alternative sources of energy and exploration and development<br />
of oil and gas reserves. Whether we like it or not, the decision<br />
to go on to import parity pricing was a major element in this<br />
policy. Conservation without a pricing policy to go with it<br />
would not mean very much. I don't think anyone wants to go back<br />
to the days of ration tickets and the associated black market.<br />
Price is the only way that will lead to the conservation of<br />
scarce energy sources without rationing.<br />
I believe the most effective way to encourage the development<br />
of alternative sources of energy, is to give a price incentive<br />
to do so. If you want greater exploration and development,<br />
then securing adequate returns for the explorers and developers<br />
may be the only way. Since the introduction of our pricing<br />
policy, Esso and BHP have committed upwards of $ 1,000 million<br />
to a programme of oil exploration and development. That would<br />
not have happened without the pricing policies that we<br />
introduced. We are encouraging conversion to other forms of energy. The<br />
Budget continues this thrust by extending the share capital<br />
rebate to apply to on-shore petroleum exploration as it has<br />
applied to off-shore exploration. That should encourage and<br />
also be a great incentive to greater oil search. The conversion<br />
of industrial equipment from oil to other forms of energy is<br />
also fostered in the Budget by allowance for accelerated<br />
write off.<br />
I know that the sugar industry is highly mechanised, and that<br />
fuel supply is vital, and an important element in costs. I also<br />
know that there have been some problems with stocks, and with<br />
distribution, but as I am advised, little disruption to<br />
harvesting. The 1979 fuel demand has been well above normal levels-That<br />
may have contributed to the difficulties.. Demand for distillate<br />
in Queensland was up by over 17% in the first half of the<br />
year compared with the first half of 1978. That might be due<br />
to rural industries doing better, and to the demand just growing,<br />
but it is a substantial increase.<br />
The difficulties were exacerbated by the breakdown of a ship,<br />
and some problems at the Ampol refinery in Brisbane. The Navy<br />
therefore, released a further 2,300 tonnes of distillate to ease<br />
the problem. 100,000 tonnes will be brought into Queensland,<br />
north of Gladstone,' between now and the end of the year. / 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
There have also been problems with avgas. In Queensland, and<br />
I don't think many people would knowthis, demand has increased<br />
26% in the first half of this year compared with the first<br />
half of last year. That 26% extra fuel was actually delivered.<br />
It has been used. There has been a distribution problem and some<br />
severe shortages in certain areas. But 4,500 tonnes has<br />
arrived in Queensland over the last week. We are hopeful that<br />
the position is containable and will be eased.<br />
We are particularly concerned about the special needs of farmers<br />
during crucial times of the year harvesting, spraying, sowing.<br />
If people want distillate and cannot get it, that is not good.<br />
We cannot have a situation where an industry, a vital industry,<br />
is held up because of lack of fuel supplies at a particular<br />
time of the year. That is well understood. The agricultural<br />
sector therefore will be amongst our highest priority, if any<br />
form of allocation should become necessary. But our objective<br />
is to try to see that an allocation system as such is not<br />
necessary, by being able to match supplies to the demand.<br />
We have established a National Petroleum Advisory Committee<br />
to advise the Government on allocation, if that is forced upon<br />
us if there are further political difficulties in the Middle<br />
East. I don't think anyone could avoid that situation. If<br />
another 2 million barrels were taken out of supply by political<br />
acts of some kind then that is obviously going to pose<br />
difficulties to Australia and many countries. We don't expect<br />
that, we don't foresee it, but I just make the point that it<br />
happened once before. If that kind of instability occurs again<br />
there will be real problems. Don Eckersley, the National<br />
President of the National Farmers' Federation, will represent<br />
rural industries on that Advisory Committee.<br />
If we tried to have a situation in which you had a different price<br />
for the same product it would lead to enormous difficulties<br />
and would plainly lead to problems of identification and problems<br />
of black marketing, from one industry to another. A two price<br />
system could be very difficult to sustain.<br />
It is also worth pointing out that a year ago we introduced a<br />
fuel price equalisation scheme. The first stage of that<br />
scheme has equalised freight to within four cents a gallon.<br />
The commitment is to reduce the freight differential to two<br />
cents a gallon. The present system costs us about $ 50 million<br />
a year. To take it to the next step as we are committed to do<br />
during the course of this Parliament would crkst about an<br />
additional $ 100 million a year, or something ctlo-se to that.<br />
That, therefore is a significant effort to try to equalise the<br />
high cost of freight to people in the remoter parts of Australia.<br />
We . don't have within our control the retailers' margins in those<br />
areas of Australia. You will often find that petrol and distillate<br />
prices are much higher in remote areas because a retailer's<br />
margin is very much higher. If you wanted to do something about<br />
that you would have to go to Brisbane and not to Canberra. 17 </p>
<p>The sugar'industry I know has been through some difficulties.<br />
There are always risks from weather, from international prices<br />
and in particular the dumping policies of certain countries.<br />
But there are encouraging signs. The Korean long-term contract<br />
of 1.2 million tonnes is better than the previous one; 9pand in<br />
1979/ 80 some reduction in world stocks is expected. Indeed<br />
this year is the first time in many years in which production<br />
is expected to be less than consumption. So perhaps the<br />
industry is going to achieve a long term balance of the kind<br />
that is very much needed.<br />
The International Sugar Agreement, we agree, is of great<br />
importance to the industry. Australia will be persevering<br />
with this to try to make sure that not only the United States but<br />
also the European Community will ultimately join. You might be<br />
interested to know that a Bill providing for United States'<br />
ratification and for a domestic support programme has now<br />
passed the necessary preliminary stages of the United States'<br />
Congress. Congress is in recess at the moment and it has not yet<br />
been introduced into the House of Representatives.<br />
If the United States' processes are grinding forth too slowly,.<br />
they are at least moving in the right direction. Mr. Gundelach<br />
with whom we have been negotiating in the Multilateral Trade<br />
Negotiations said to us privately, and has since said publicly,<br />
that if the United States joins the International Sugar Agreement,<br />
then in his view the European Economic Community will also<br />
join the Agreement. That, of course, would be of enormous<br />
advantage to the sugar industry in this State.<br />
You know better than I that Europe spends $ 800 million in export<br />
subsidies on sugar about $ 350 a tonne.<br />
All in all, they have spent $ 12,000 million in subsidies of<br />
one kind or another, about $ 4,000 or $ 5,000 million subsidising<br />
the export of commodities that compete quite directly with<br />
exports from Australia. That just shows<br />
I how important our trade offensive into Europe has been. Some<br />
have said we should forget it. But it is too important to us.<br />
It is not something that we can, should or will put aside.<br />
Until we can get Europe to participate with greater<br />
responsibility in international trade we will keep up the<br />
pressure wherever we can.<br />
As a result of what we have done over the last three years the<br />
problems of the European policies are now better understood in<br />
Europe and much more criticised in Europe than they have ever<br />
been. I think that inevitably at some stage there will have to<br />
be a change. With sugar, what we have to try to do is to get<br />
America and then Europe to join the International Sugar Agreement.<br />
Ethanol has sometimes been suggested as a fuel substitute and<br />
there could well be long-term prospects for that if fuel prices<br />
continue to rise. We are spending nearly million on research<br />
at the present time. in about 18 months it will be possible<br />
to make a better assessment of ethanol production in Australia.<br />
/ 8<br />

The sugar industry is of enormous importance to the future<br />
of Australia. It plays a significant part in this district<br />
and obviously this district is vastly dependent on a<br />
profitable sugar industry. It is of great importance<br />
to Queensland.<br />
I am honoured to have been asked to be here at the opening<br />
of this building with you. I have very great confidence both<br />
in the future of this industry and in the future of Australia.<br />
