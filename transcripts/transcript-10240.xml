NE W PARLAMENTARY SECRETARY<br />
I am pleased to announce the appointment of Senator Chris Ellison as<br />
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services. He<br />
replaces Senator Bob Woods who has announced his intention to resign from<br />
Parliament. Senator Ellison will also assist the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice in<br />
certain selected areas.<br />
The new Parliamentary Secretary, who represents Western Australia in the<br />
Senate, was elected to Parliament in 1993. Hie has served on a range of Senate<br />
and Joint Parliamentary Commn-ittees. He played a particularly active role for the<br />
then opposition in debate on the former government's Native Title legislation late<br />
in 1993.<br />
1 congratulate Senator Ellison. I am sure that he will discharge his new<br />
responsibilities with great skill and energy.<br />
