FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 2/ 1959.<br />
EXPERT COMMITTEE ON COAL<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister, Rt. Hon. J. McEwen, M. P.<br />
The Commonwealth Government has decided to establish<br />
an Expert Committee to advise it on all aspects of research into<br />
the uses of coal. This decision is in line with the announcement<br />
by the Government in its Policy Speech that it would assist the<br />
expansion of such research. Arrangements for setting up the<br />
Committee have been worked out between my colleagues Mr. Casey<br />
Minister for External Affairs ( as Minister in charge of C. S. I. R. O.)<br />
and Senator Spooner ( Minister. for National Development, and whose<br />
portfolio includes the Joint Coal Board). The Committee will<br />
report to Senator Spooner.<br />
The Committee will make a complete review of research in<br />
Australia and overseas and will consider both the short and long<br />
term aspects. In recommending to the Commonwealth Government<br />
those lines of research which should be initiated or further<br />
encouraged, the Committee will give special consideration to those<br />
which offer promise of leading quickly to an increased demand for<br />
coal, although, of course, it is not to be expected that this could<br />
be achieved overnight.<br />
The amount of research that has been done and is being<br />
done in ' Australia on the uses' of coal is considerable far greatothan<br />
is generally appreciated. The Government considered therefor<br />
that, before launching out on any new research or intensifying<br />
existing research, it would be wise to take stock of current work<br />
both in Australia and overseas. The" Government proposes that this<br />
review should be the starting point foy future research policy so<br />
far as" the Commonwealth is concerned. "' It is convinced that the nev<br />
arrangements. are of the greatest importancq to. the coal industry c..<br />
Australia and that great benefits will accrue from the work of. the<br />
Committee The Commonwealthhas been. fortunate in obtaining the<br />
consent of. the following men to serve on. theCommittee;-<br />
