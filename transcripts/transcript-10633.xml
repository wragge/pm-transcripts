    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................................................................</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory</p>
<p> and I have called this news conference so that I can announce the</p>
<p> decision of the Commonwealth Government that the Northern Territory</p>
<p> is to become the seventh State of Australia.</p>
<p>We have taken this in-principle decision and the goal very simply</p>
<p> is a new State for a new century. And the goal is that the Northern</p>
<p> Territory should become a State of the Commonwealth on the 1st</p>
<p> of January in the year 2001. It will thereby become the first State,</p>
<p> new State admitted to the Federation in 100 years and I doubt that</p>
<p> in the lifetime of any person at this gathering we will see a similar</p>
<p> announcement. It is an historic decision by the Commonwealth Government.</p>
<p> It follows the commitment that was given in the 1996 election campaign.</p>
<p>We will facilitate at a Federal level the holding of a referendum</p>
<p> on Statehood within the Northern Territory at the time of the next</p>
<p> Federal election. I have asked the Minister for Territories, Mr Somlyay,</p>
<p> to chair the deliberations on behalf of the Commonwealth in negotiating</p>
<p> the terms and conditions of the Constitution of the new State of the</p>
<p> Northern Territory. I have no doubt that this will help to revitalise</p>
<p> and reinvigorate the Australian Federation. The Northern Territory</p>
<p> enjoys an enviable economic growth rate. It has a very healthy population</p>
<p> rate. It contributes more than double on a per capita basis to the</p>
<p> export income of the entire nation and I regard today's announcement</p>
<p> as a very, very important investment in the future of Australia into</p>
<p> the new millenium.</p>
<p>I would like to congratulate Mr Stone as the Chief Minister of the</p>
<p> Northern Territory for the vigorous, yet constructive and understanding</p>
<p> way in which he has pursued the long cherished goal of Statehood on</p>
<p> behalf of Territorians. So I am very proud indeed to announce that</p>
<p> the Commonwealth Government is committed to this very important development</p>
<p> in the growth of our nation and the revitalisation and the reinvigoration</p>
<p> of the Federation. And I congratulate those in the Territory who have</p>
<p> worked so hard to bring this about and I have little doubt that the</p>
<p> negotiations that will go on over the weeks and months ahead will</p>
<p> successfully end in the putting forward of a Constitution which will</p>
<p> be acceptable not only to Territorians but to the rest of the Australian</p>
<p> people. I should indicate that the Commonwealth's desired method</p>
<p> of admitting the new State to the Federation is under Section 121</p>
<p> of the Constitution whereby an Act of the Commonwealth Parliament</p>
<p> can create a new State. I might also mention that the other States</p>
<p> have indicated to the Commonwealth their in-principle support for</p>
<p> the decision that I am announcing today and I believe that it will</p>
<p> be widely applauded by all but the mean in spirit and narrow of vision</p>
<p> so far as the development of the Australian nation is concerned.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>CHIEF MINISTER STONE:</p>
<p>Well certainly Statehood would ensure that Territorians have the same</p>
<p> rights that other Australians take for granted.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>CHIEF MINISTER STONE:</p>
<p>Well such as, to give you a small example, the way that our vote is</p>
<p> counted in a referendum. It is counted as a majority of the people,</p>
<p> it is not counted as a majority of the States. But it would also ensure</p>
<p> that we have the legislative base to legislate for ourselves in an</p>
<p> unrestricted way.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]... marginal seat of mining royalties or... (inaudible)...?</p>
<p>CHIEF MINISTER STONE:</p>
<p>The Commonwealth receives the uranium royalties. We would seek to</p>
<p> be treated on the same basis as other States in South Australia. They</p>
<p> receive the uranium royalties so we would have the expectation of</p>
<p> that revenue stream. Now no doubt the Commonwealth would simply make</p>
<p> an adjustment in other areas and that would be a satisfactory arrangement</p>
<p> to us Prime Minister.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is that something that the Prime Minister has discussed with you yet?</p>
<p>CHIEF MINISTER STONE:</p>
<p>Well these are the matters that need to be discussed and negotiated</p>
<p> in the time ahead. Today really is a moment of history for the Commonwealth</p>
<p> and it is a moment of fulfillment for territorians but we still have</p>
<p> a way to go as we make ourselves and take ourselves down the path</p>
<p> to January of 2001.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(Inaudible)</p>
<p>CHIEF MINISTER STONE:</p>
<p>Well, I believe there is a way through that accommodates everybody's</p>
<p> concerns and that way through, ironically, has been presented by the</p>
<p> Native Title Act which is a Commonwealth piece of legislation but</p>
<p> administered effectively now by the States and the Territories and</p>
<p> there is no reason why the Aboriginal Land Rights Act could not remain</p>
<p> a Commonwealth Act and yet be administered by the Northern Territory</p>
<p> State.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what about these questions of for example uranium</p>
<p> royalties and also control of national parks.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look all of these things will be discussed. I have no doubt that</p>
<p> we can reach a very happy arrangement. The Federation has got a lot</p>
<p> of life left in it and it is going to enjoy reinvigoration.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] and the flag?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the Australian flag remains exactly the same.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] ... federation star won't have to change?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's a very interesting proposition.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What about the name?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The name?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>CHIEF MINISTER STONE:</p>
<p>Well, the State of the Northern Territory is no more perhaps contradictory</p>
<p> than New South Wales.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we need to talk about that. Obviously you can't have 12</p>
<p> and I think that has been understood from the word go. One formula</p>
<p> that has been discussed is that at the time of Statehood you might</p>
<p> go to three with a formula for adding as population rose. That is</p>
<p> one possibility but I am prepared to sit down and talk to Mr Stone</p>
<p> about that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] extraordinary power to 180, 000 Australians to...(inaudible)...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's no more extraordinary, if you call it extraordinary,</p>
<p> than the present situation where you have an equality of Senate representation</p>
<p> from the States irrespective of population. See, the original federal</p>
<p> compact was that the smaller units of the new federation surrendered</p>
<p> power to the centre which they knew through the popular vote would</p>
<p> be dominated by Melbourne and Sydney, and the eastern seaboard, and</p>
<p> in return they sought and obtained equality of State representation.</p>
<p> Now you have to honour, to some degree, that but I don't think</p>
<p> it's realistic to have 12 Senators. I don't think anybody</p>
<p> from the Territory is seriously seeking that and it has not been something</p>
<p> that will be on the agenda.</p>
<p>CHIEF MINISTER STONE:</p>
<p>Yes, I could indicate that in all of our discussions to date, and</p>
<p> we've never sought 12 Senators, no one seriously has ever put</p>
<p> that proposition from the Northern Territory, that if we had a beginning</p>
<p> point of three and then a formula locked into population growth so</p>
<p> that when we reached the least populist State, for example, Tasmania</p>
<p> at 450,000, that there would be adjustments along the way. Now, that</p>
<p> would seem to be an imminently fair and equitable approach but it</p>
<p> would take 30 years based on our even rapid population growth to reach</p>
<p> that of Tasmania.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(Inaudible) would you seek to have the power to ... the federal</p>
<p> Land Rights legislation or would that we only ....(inaudible)..?</p>
<p>CHIEF MINISTER STONE:</p>
<p>No, look I believe that the perfect compromise that should meet everybody's</p>
<p> concerns, and this includes the land rights and the very important</p>
<p> Aboriginal constituency in the Northern Territory, would be for the</p>
<p> Aboriginal Land Rights Act to remain with the Commonwealth</p>
<p> Parliament but to be administered by the new State of the Northern</p>
<p> Territory. That would be consistent with the way that the Native</p>
<p> Title Act works.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So the power would remain in your....(inaudible)?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The power of amendment would in those circumstances, but you would</p>
<p> obviously, because there would be a partnership involved in it you</p>
<p> wouldn't act in a way that was indifferent to the concerns of</p>
<p> the new State. I think what Mr Stone has said, which he raised with</p>
<p> me this morning, is a very very worthwhile imminently sensible way</p>
<p> of dealing with this issue. It recognises that the day-to-day management</p>
<p> of these matters ought to rest with the Territory and not with the</p>
<p> Commonwealth, equally because there are concerns about national approaches</p>
<p> and so forth in these areas if it were to remain an Act of the Commonwealth</p>
<p> Parliament, it would meet those concerns and I think it's an</p>
<p> intelligent compromise which I'm favourably disposed to but I</p>
<p> want to get some advice on it. But I like it and I thank Mr Stone</p>
<p> for making such a sensible proposition.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) ... Senators from other States based on population?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't have anything in mind on that at the present time.</p>
<p> I've got a few other things I want to get out of the way before</p>
<p> I start looking at things like that and I don't know that I'll</p>
<p> turn my mind to that issue in the foreseeable future. It's pretty</p>
<p> hard to make any changes in that area.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) legislate that that could be changed without reference</p>
<p> to the people...</p>
<p>CHIEF MINISTER STONE:</p>
<p>Could I just perhaps comment on that Prime Minister? We've not</p>
<p> sought to change this flag and these fellows haven't sought to</p>
<p> change that flag which is more important in the sense of where Territorians</p>
<p> are coming from.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) Federation star.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yep, well I understand, well, we'll have a think about that but</p>
<p> I mean I don't think Shane is going to feel that his, you know,</p>
<p> virility as a Territorian is challenged by the continuation of the</p>
<p> existing federation star - let me put it that way.</p>
<p>CHIEF MINISTER STONE:</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible).. legislate to pass the euthanasia laws without...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Is that question directed to me or Mr....to me? Well the goal would</p>
<p> be that the new State would have essentially the same powers as the</p>
<p> existing States and obviously that's something, that issue will</p>
<p> come up in discussions. And bear in mind that the Act that was passed</p>
<p> by the Commonwealth Parliament was not an Act sponsored by the Government,</p>
<p> although I personally supported it and my view has not changed and</p>
<p> I don't think is likely to change. I think it's also fair</p>
<p> to say that the composition of the Parliament of the Northern Territory</p>
<p> has probably changed and attitudes on that issue may well have changed</p>
<p> since it was last before the Territory Parliament. That is something</p>
<p> that will come up. You've got to remember that once you go down</p>
<p> the path of Statehood the ideal is that the Territory should have</p>
<p> essentially the same powers as other States otherwise there's</p>
<p> no point in doing it. You don't sort of give a State half the</p>
<p> authority of the other States.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) ... bounce back in the Newspoll today?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'll take that question first.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST</p>
<p>What does the Northern Territory Statehood mean for the Budget in</p>
<p> terms of the change to outlays and revenue and how will the Northern</p>
<p> Territory....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm sure...look the Northern Territory, like the other jurisdictions</p>
<p> of the federation will be greatly strengthened and greatly benefited</p>
<p> and greatly enhanced under the tax plan that's going to be announced</p>
<p> on Thursday.</p>
<p>CHIEF MINISTER STONE:</p>
<p>Could I just add to that? I'm understanding the intent of your</p>
<p> question. We have been funded as a State for eight years so we take</p>
<p> our chances at Premiers' conference along with everybody else.</p>
<p> And there's no special formula for the Northern Territory. For</p>
<p> eight years we've been funded as a State so it costs nothing</p>
<p> to the Australian tax payer, nor to Territorians, to become a State.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is there any chance that the NT will be ...(inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well far from it. No, the NT will not be worse off.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]...Are you thinking of opening the door for changes</p>
<p> to federal funds, change to the .....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm not sure I understand your question.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh no I was making an observation. I mean, the legal mechanism to</p>
<p> deliver statehood would be via an Act of the Commonwealth Parliament</p>
<p> which the Government will sponsor under Section 121 of the Constitution.</p>
<p> We won't be sort of making Statehood for the Northern Territory</p>
<p> formally conditional on each of the other States ticking off on each</p>
<p> provision of the Territory's constitution. Once we've ticked</p>
<p> off on it and if the Commonwealth Parliament supports it, then the</p>
<p> Northern Territory will become a State. But I was expressing the view</p>
<p> that the development and the movement towards Statehood would be acceptable</p>
<p> to the rest of the Australian community. And I think the rest of the</p>
<p> Australian community will have a very positive view about Statehood</p>
<p> for the Northern Territory. They will see it as eminently sensible,</p>
<p> they recognise the distinctive character of the Territory and I think</p>
<p> people will regard it as the most natural thing in the world to have</p>
<p> a new State for a new century.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Why has this taken nearly a hundred years?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Shane and I can only answer for the last two or three years</p>
<p> together, but it has come further in the time that we have occupied</p>
<p> our current positions than perhaps in some earlier years, although</p>
<p> I do remind you that the first federal politician to seriously commit</p>
<p> a federal Government to Statehood for the Northern Territory was Malcolm</p>
<p> Fraser in the lead up to the 1975 election campaign.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister perhaps I should put my question this way. Do you think</p>
<p> the announcement of Statehood for the Northern Territory has contributed</p>
<p> to the bounce back in the polls or do you think....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Glenn I don't know. You understand my notorious reticence when</p>
<p> it comes to polls. I saw that with interest and we'll just sort</p>
<p> of see. I think you are seeing a recognition in the Australian community</p>
<p> develop that there's the Government that's offering something,</p>
<p> there's the Government that has got a plan for the future and</p>
<p> then you've got our traditional opponents, the Labor Party who</p>
<p> just say no to everything and our other opponents on the periphery</p>
<p> who also say no to everything but sort of say that on occasions in</p>
<p> different languages.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>...are you concerned about the Australian Broadcasting Authority's</p>
<p> problems with the ads that you ...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. No.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How will you overcome that...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, very easy. You just follow the law.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>...disclaimer at the end of the advertisements?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the law will be followed and we've got advice on that,</p>
<p> and everything is perfectly in order. May I say in relation to this</p>
<p> that I find this business about us running advertisements on this</p>
<p> plan quite extraordinary. I mean, this is the biggest change to the</p>
<p> Australian taxation system since World War II and perhaps earlier</p>
<p> than that, and the Australian public is entitled to have the detail</p>
<p> and for the Labor Party who has spent equivalent amounts of public</p>
<p> money in advertising things with a tenth or twentieth of the detail</p>
<p> or the significance of this plan have got the nerve to moralise to</p>
<p> us about the quite legitimate expenditure of public money to explain</p>
<p> something that people want to know something about. People want to</p>
<p> know about this. They want to know how they are affected. They want</p>
<p> to know how they are benefited and how they are helped and how their</p>
<p> parents are helped and their children are helped, and their community</p>
<p> is helped. I think it is an utterly legitimate expenditure by the</p>
<p> Commonwealth. It will be done in accordance with the law. I make no</p>
<p> apologies at all for doing it, and I find the utterances of Senator</p>
<p> Faulkner and Mr Beazley on this pathetic.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It's clearly an essential part of the election campaign isn't</p>
<p> it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there's no campaign. I mean, you may know when the election</p>
<p> is, I don't.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>.... What is an acceptable amount of time for people to ingest</p>
<p> and understand a tax package before an election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have said before Glenn that I have no intention of dropping the</p>
<p> tax package and then running straight off to an election. There will</p>
<p> be adequate time allowed for people to have the plan explained to</p>
<p> them. There will be information made available so that people understand</p>
<p> how it will work. As to when the election is going to be held I don't</p>
<p> know. And I certainly haven't made any de</p>
