PRIME INISTE<br />
FOR MEDIA 27 December 1991<br />
KEATING MINISTRY<br />
I have today recommended to the Governor-General a number of<br />
changes to the Ministry. The swearing-in is scheduled for<br />
today.<br />
Details of the Ministry are attached.<br />
It is a talen~ ted and experienced team which is well placed<br />
to undertake the task of building confidence in Australia<br />
and getting economic recovery underway.<br />
The Governmnent's key tasks, will be jobs and economic growth.<br />
As I said on becoming Prime Minister, I believe that we can<br />
emerge from the recession with a much stronger economy than<br />
ever before. The nineties hold very great promise for all<br />
Australians. Mr Dawkins will be Treasurer.<br />
Other key changes will be the appointment of Mr Willis as<br />
Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley as Minister for Employment,<br />
Education and Training, Dr Blewett as Minister for Social<br />
Security and Senator Richardson as Minister for Transport<br />
and Communications.<br />
I am pleased to welcome two new members to Cabinet Mr<br />
Griffiths and Senator Collins.<br />
Mr Griffiths will be sworn in as Minister for Tourism in<br />
charge of a new Department of Tourism, which is to operate<br />
as a separate portfolio in recognition of the importance and<br />
special needs~ of that industry to the economy and regional<br />
Australia. tie will continue as Minister for Resources in<br />
the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio.<br />
Reflecting the importance of micro-economic reform, Senator<br />
Collins, as Minister for Shipping and Aviation, will be a<br />
second Cabinet Minister within the Transport and<br />
Communications portfolio. 4079 </p>
<p>U-'<br />
2<br />
Mr Kerin will become Minister for Trade and Overseas<br />
Development within the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio<br />
reflecting the importance of trade matters to rural and<br />
regional Australia. The portfolio will be represented in<br />
Cabinet by the portfolio Minister, Senator Evans.<br />
Other changes are: Mr Simmons will now be Minister for<br />
Local Government and Minister for Family Support; Ms Fatin<br />
will be appointed Minister for the Arts and Territories;<br />
the Minister for Higher Education and Education Services, Mr<br />
Baldwin, will in addition be Minister Assisting the<br />
Treasurer; tho Minister for Science and Technology, Mr Free,<br />
will now be Minister Assisting the Prime Minister generally<br />
in addition to science matters.<br />
The appointment of Parliamentary Secretaries provides a<br />
means of assisting Ministers in the administration of their<br />
departments and developing new talent. I have decided<br />
therefore to appoint four additional Parliamentary<br />
Secretaries: Mr Laurie Brereton, Mr Peter Duncan, Mr Gary<br />
Johns and Stephen Martin. Details are included in the<br />
attached Ministry list.<br />
Public Services Changes<br />
I have kept or ganisational changes to departments to a<br />
minimum, the only changes recommended to the Administrative<br />
Arrangements Order being the movement of responsibility for<br />
Tourism, from the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and<br />
Territories portfolio to a new separate portfolio.<br />
