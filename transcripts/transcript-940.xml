FOR PBF&amp; SS P. m. 40o1964<br />
RESIGNATION OF SIR WILLIAM SPOONER<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert<br />
Menzies<br />
The front page story in the i'Sydney Morning<br />
Herald" referring to the resignation of Sir William Spooner<br />
is entirely false and in all its implications malicious,<br />
The story states that " only two months ago he<br />
refused Sir Robert's offer to appoint him Australian<br />
Ambassador to Washington", and that I resented his " refusal".<br />
This is completely untrue, since no such offer was made.<br />
It was, I thought, pretty well understood in Cabinet<br />
circles that Sir William had no ambitions to go to Washington.<br />
In any event, I knew three months ago, when he first<br />
approached me, that he wanted to secure relief from his<br />
Cabinet work. It would have been very strange for meo, under<br />
these circumstances, to have endeavoured to talk him into<br />
taking on the exceedingly arduous labours of Ambassador<br />
to Washington. The whole basis of this story is false.<br />
Furthermore, the story is wickedly unjust to<br />
Sir William Spooner. I would have thought that an honourable<br />
man with fifteen years of continuous Cabinet service,<br />
interrupted by very few holidays of any kind, might be<br />
entitled to reach the conclusion that he would like to go<br />
Lack to private life without being gratuitously pursued<br />
by the groundless allegation that he had been dismissed.<br />
CANBERRA, 3rd June, 1964. </p>
