12 March 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
SPEECH TO LUNCHEON AT ECHUCA, VICTORIA<br />
E O E<br />
This is quite a meeting. It's a big tent and I don't often speak under big tents but<br />
they're quite a, it's quite, I don't think I've been on the site of a land claim under a tent<br />
on a river bank before. I've been in a lot of unusual places in my almost 23 years in<br />
politics but it is a great delight to be here. I think I am sort of the first Prime Minister<br />
of Australia who has paid an intentional visit to this electorate and I am delighted to be<br />
here, delighted to be welcomed into the electorate of Murray by your new, very<br />
effective, very energetic, highly intelligent and highly articulate Federal Member,<br />
Sharman Stone. She really is doing well.<br />
If she thought the second of March was a good night, I can tell you, there was another<br />
bloke, no, there was another fellow, another Liberal who thought it was too and it was<br />
a great night and it's a night that really, and I said it then and I will say it again, it's a<br />
night that really belonged more than to me or to Sharman, but it really belonged to all<br />
those hundreds of thousands of supporters of the Liberal and National parties<br />
throughout Australia who, year in and year out, worked so damn hard to elect a<br />
Coalition Government and for one reason or another we kept getting it wrong and<br />
stumbling or shooting in the wrong direction and then finally it all came together and<br />
we finally did win. We didn't win with a whimper but we won very strongly on the<br />
second of March and we have a tremendous opportunity and I still feel the sense of<br />
excitement that we no doubt all experienced on that occasion and all of my colleagues<br />
still have that sense of excitement and that sense of commitment and that sense of<br />
mission to try and bring about some significant changes. And one of the things we do<br />
try very hard to do and my being here today and in Pakenham yesterday along with all<br />
the members of the Cabinet is to end for all time the notion that the world revolves<br />
around Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne. It really doesn't.<br />
One of the things I am quite determined to do is to take the Cabinet I lead to the<br />
people of Australia. We had a Cabinet meeting in Pakenham yesterday and we're<br />
going to have Cabinet meetings all around the regions as well as the state capitals of </p>
<p>Australia so that at the end of our three years in Government we will not only have<br />
talked the rhetoric of listening to the regions of Australia, we will have acted out the<br />
reality of listening to the regions of Australia. What I did yesterday and what I am<br />
doing today is really the beginning of a very long journey over the next couple of<br />
years, a journey of listening to the Australian people, especially in the regions, hearing<br />
about their concerns, often agreeing with them, sometimes disagreeing with them but<br />
hopefully, at the end of that process being able to govern well in their interests as well<br />
as in the interests of all of the Australian people.<br />
Now we inherited an Australian economy that had some good features but it also had<br />
some bad features. It had relatively low inflation but it had very high interest rates and<br />
in the 12 months that we have been in power, we have seen that inflation rate come<br />
down a little further which is welcome and we have seen some quite substantial falls in<br />
interest rates. We inherited an Australian economy that had a very high level of<br />
unemployment and that high level of unemployment was the product of policy failures<br />
over a long period of time and that high level of unemployment is still with us and I<br />
didn't expect that it would be gone. I didn't even expect that a dent would be made in<br />
it in 12 months.<br />
( Tape breaks)<br />
. the last year the level of business investment has been higher and for the next year it<br />
is prospectively higher still than it has been at any time over the last 25 years. Now not<br />
all of that is being felt evenly in Australia. A lot of that investment is concentrated in<br />
the mining industry and in areas of the construction industry and the major cities and<br />
some of it in the tourist industry, and I know that when politicians talk about big<br />
investment figures, if you live in an area of Australia where there's not a lot of<br />
investment, you sort of are a bit sceptical and you are entitled to be a bit sceptical<br />
because all of those figures are nationally expressed.<br />
So to get unemployment down you have to get the economy growing and it's got to<br />
grow stronger than it is at the present time. It's growing at about 3.5% which is pretty<br />
high by world standards. There aren't many better but it needs to grow at somewhere<br />
between 4 and 4.5% to begin to make really solid inroads into the level of<br />
unemployment. And that is why you have to take out of the economy all of those<br />
things that stop people doing sensible investment and taking sensible business<br />
decisions. And one of the things that we promised we would do is we would change the industrial<br />
relations system of this country. And I am very happy to say that Laurie Brereton's<br />
stupid, job-destroying unfair dismissal law is finally a thing of the past and that was got<br />
rid of only at the beginning of this year, not because I didn't want to get rid of it earlier<br />
but it took us a while to get it through the Senate.<br />
Remember it? We don't control it. I mean, I keep reading about how we do now<br />
because of Brian Harradine and Mal Colston. Well, I mean, they vote better than the<br />
Democrats but I tell you what, it still takes a lot of effort to get anything through the<br />
Senate but there's nothing we can do about that. The mathematics of Senate elections<br />
are such that you have an even number of Senators retiring in each state every three </p>
<p>years and it is absolutely impossible to get four out of six. You have to get about<br />
when I went to school anyway, 65% of the two party preferred vote to get four out of<br />
six. It used to be fairly easy to get three out of five because that's an odd number but<br />
that was all changed in 1983 and we're stuck with this situation and we have to live<br />
with that and we have to try and get around it and we've done rather well. We've<br />
done better than I thought we would be doing three or four months into the<br />
Government's first year. We managed ultimately to get the Industrial Relations bill<br />
through and we ultimately got the Telstra sale through and that of course, that<br />
particular piece of legislation, the Telstra sale is of enormous importance to regional<br />
Australia because out of the proceeds of the sale of one third of Telstra which we<br />
conservatively estimate will yield about $ 8 billion, that's the figure in the budget, out<br />
of that we're putting $ 1.2 billion into the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia, and as<br />
Sharman said, that will be the greatest ever capital investment in the environmental<br />
rebuilding of this country any government of any political stripe has ever committed.<br />
Now out of that $ 1.2 billion we're going to dedicate $ 163 million to clean up the<br />
Murray-Darling basin. And that is something that has been needed to be done for<br />
years and years and that is why we put so much store on that Natural Heritage Trust<br />
and I can't for the life of me understand how the Australian Democrats who claim to<br />
be the greenest of the green and how the Australian Labor Party could possibly vote<br />
against the sale of Telstra and therefore effectively vote against the establishment of<br />
the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia. But that fund over time will do more in a<br />
constructive way to regenerate the Australian environment than any other set of policy<br />
decisions that any government has ever undertaken. And of course it will have<br />
employment implications in regional Australia. Most of the money from the Trust will<br />
be spent In regional Australia rather than in the cities and that in turn will have<br />
employment consequences.<br />
To return to my employment theme, we need to get the economy moving more rapidly<br />
in order to generate more jobs but we also need to tackle the unemployment problem<br />
in other ways. We need and we are now delivering a modern training and<br />
apprenticeship system for this country. Apprenticeships have declined alarmingly in<br />
Australia over the last ten years and David Kemp has developed a modern<br />
apprenticeship and training system that will arrest that decline. No longer will<br />
traineeships and apprenticeships be driven by the industrial requirements of industrial<br />
awards. Traineeships and apprenticeships will be developed to suit the interest and the<br />
convenience of individual employers and the young men and women that they take on<br />
to their payrolls.<br />
And the third area where we are adopting an approach which I believe will make a<br />
contribution, on its own it won't solve the problem and I don't represent that it does<br />
but we plan to introduce a work-for-the-dole scheme in Australia. Now for years and<br />
years whenever this was raise people would say, oh you can't do it. It's against the<br />
ILO, it's against this, it's against that. The reality is that it's not against the ILO it<br />
never has been and it's not sweated labour. What is wrong in a community that is<br />
willing to look after people when they don't have a job, which it is the obligation of<br />
any civil society to do, what is wrong with saying in an appropriate form that those<br />
people so looked after should be asked to do something in return for the support that<br />
they receive from the rest of the community. It is the principle that I have described </p>
<p>the principle of mutual obligation. We have an obligation to look after people who<br />
need help and in return they have an obligation to give something back at an<br />
appropriate level. I think that is a sound principle of the Australian fair go.<br />
Now the people who are involved in these schemes will be paid award rates of pay.<br />
They won't be asked to work for a dollar or two dollars an hour, they'll be required to<br />
work the amount of time necessary to work out, according to the relevant award, the<br />
value of their dole. Any suggestion that that is unfair, it's anti-Australian, that it's<br />
conscripted labour that is absolute nonsense. And I want to know precisely where the<br />
Australian Labor Party stands on this issue. When it was first announced they said it<br />
was stupid, then they had another think and thought to themselves well maybe it's not<br />
and maybe we'll let it through. Yesterday we had Mr McMullan saying well we're<br />
against, we'll try and amend it but ultimately we'll let it through. And this morning I<br />
understand Mr Beazley has attacked it and says it's unfair. Well I just have one very<br />
simple question for Mr Beazley there is a core element in our proposal and that is to<br />
change the Social Secuitly Act so that people can be required to do work in return for<br />
the dole. And I want a simple answer from Mr Beazley, will he or will he not vote in<br />
favour of that particular amendment? I mean, that is the test of whether you're for or<br />
against this scheme. I just want to know what the answer to that is. But I don't<br />
pretend and I don't want anybody in this audience to pretend or to imagine that I see<br />
the work for the dole scheme as being the answer to unemployment I don't. I see it<br />
as being part of the answer along with a lot of other things. But the biggest way, the<br />
biggest contribution that we can make to getting unemployment down in Australia is to<br />
give the small business community of this country a much fairer go. That is the key,<br />
that is the key.<br />
Now I talked a lot about small business during the election campaign and I continue to<br />
talk a lot about small business because I believe that small business can hold the key<br />
and can provide, more than anything else, an answer to the medium and longer term<br />
economic problems of Australia. You are entitled to ask, particularly the men and<br />
women in this audience who are in small business, you are entitled to ask what have<br />
you done over the last year to deliver on your promises to smnall business. And can I<br />
start by saying that I understand why a lot of people in small business would still be<br />
feeling a bit unhappy. I don't pretend that everything has magically changed in a year<br />
it hasn't. We've started to do the job, we've started to make changes but anybody<br />
who tells you that in 12 months you can wave a magic wand I mean, there was one<br />
of my predecessors who claimed credit for the drought breaking and I knew a State<br />
Premier who reckoned he made it rain but the reality is that in 12 months you can<br />
make a start and we have made a big start.<br />
To start with in the area of small business we changed the industrial relations system as<br />
I mentioned and we got rid of the unfair dismissal laws. From the first of July this year<br />
any person in small business in Australia will be able to sell his or her business for an<br />
amount up to $ 5 million, invest that $ 5 million or a lesser amount into another<br />
business, any other business, and not have any liability for capital gains tax as a result<br />
of that sale. That represents a major change. I mean, we said we would introduce<br />
roll-over relief for small business. We've not introduced roll-over relief we're<br />
introducing mega roll-over relief with that particular proposal. I mean, it is a fair more<br />
generous proposal than what we put forward at the time of the election and it is </p>
<p>designed to suck more capital into small business. It's designed to do that. We made<br />
some changes to the provisional tax uplift factor that has improved the cash flow of<br />
small business by about $ 180 million over the past 12 months and in a couple of weeks<br />
time I will respond in detail to the report of the Bell Committee that inquired into the<br />
amount of red tape and regulation effecting small business in Australia and I will be<br />
making a number of other announcements in that response that I believe will be of very<br />
significant benefit to the small business community.<br />
So we are very focused on the needs of small business. We are very committed to<br />
improving the climate under which small business operates in this country and it's<br />
something that we will nag away at during the whole of our first term in Government<br />
because if we can really create a fundamentally more benign climate for small business<br />
in Australia then we I think will go a powerful way towards effectively addressing<br />
Australia's unemployment problems. Because big companies are into downsizing,<br />
governments of necessity need to make efficiencies at all levels and it's at the small<br />
business level, the micro level of the economy where businesses are coming into<br />
existence at a rapid rate, some of them expanding very rapidly, some of them not doing<br />
so well. It's in that whole area where I believe that we're going to get our greatest<br />
employment growth.<br />
Now ladies and gentlemen, Sharman mentioned in her speech the concerns of this<br />
district and, indeed, the concerns of many other parts of Australia about some of the<br />
problems thrown up by the native title issue. I don't think any government could have<br />
a more complex issue than responding effectively and fairly to the decision of the High<br />
Court in the Wik decision. I made it clear when that decision was brought down that<br />
all of the options were on the table, including significant legislative change to existing<br />
Acts of the Federal Parliament. The two things I said that weren't on the table was,<br />
firstly, we were not going to try and overturn the original Mabo decision because I<br />
accept that Native Title as such, the concept of Native Title is something that has come<br />
to Australia and it is a concept that should be respected. But it is the extent of it, it is<br />
the operation of it and, in particular, the operation of it as expressed through the<br />
existing Native Title Act which presents so much of the problem. I want to produce an<br />
outcome that delivers justice and security. I want to produce an outcome that respects<br />
the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country. But I also<br />
want to produce an outcome that returns to the pastoralists and the farmers of<br />
Australia the sort of security and predicability that they imagined for two hundreds that<br />
they had and in reality has been taken away by the decision of the High Court. Now, I<br />
thought it was a strange decision and may I say on the subject of responding to court<br />
decisions it has never been out of, dare I say court, but it's never been out of order to<br />
criticise a decision of the High Court. And it's always been the role of the Parliament<br />
if it thinks fit to change the law as currently interpreted by the courts. And this idea<br />
that you can't ever interfere with the law as interpreted by the courts is a very strange<br />
notion and has no support or no logic in any proper understanding of the anglo-<br />
Australian legal system under which we operate.<br />
Now, I hope to be in a position if it is possible to produce an agreed outcome but I<br />
think that will be very difficult to achieve although I am endeavouring to do so and I<br />
am spending a lot of time talking to all of the relevant parties, but one way or another I<br />
hope by about Easter we'll either have an agreed outcome or I'll be in a position to </p>
<p>recommend to my colleagues in the Cabinet the sort of course of action that we need<br />
to take.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen there are lots of things that we could talk about at a gathering<br />
like this. It is a gathering, not exclusively, but predominantly of people who join in<br />
common cause in the weeks leading up to March of last year to secure first and<br />
foremost of course a Coalition Government in Australia and can I take the opportunity<br />
of acknowledging and saying what a great privilege and great honour it is to be in<br />
Coalition with Tim Fischer and his colleagues in the National Party. Tim Fischer is a<br />
great bloke to work with, he's a very fine Australian, he's a very good deputy Prime<br />
Minister and an outstandingly energetic trade Minister and he makes a great<br />
contribution to my Government and I'm delighted to have him as a close colleague and<br />
friend.<br />
But you also here in the electorate of Murray and particularly most of the people in<br />
this audience, you worked so hard to get Sharman elected, you worked hard to get a<br />
Government of Liberal values, a Government of the values of the National Party, and<br />
our values on most things as two Coalition parties are very close indeed. Over the last<br />
year we have delivered on all of the essential commitments that we made to the<br />
Australian people. We said we'd have a family tax initiative, we delivered every last<br />
dollar of it on the first of January. We said we'd have a Natural Heritage Trust and<br />
now thankfully it is through the Senate. We said that there would be Capital Gains<br />
Tax relief for small business and it is being over delivered on the first of July. We said<br />
there would be tax subsidies for private health insurance and they will be delivered on<br />
the first of July as promised and we said that in so many other areas we would deliver<br />
on our commitments and we have.<br />
But that is only the down-payment, that is only the beginning. And we I hope have a<br />
number of years ahead of us as a Coalition Government. But I want to promise you<br />
that one thing we won't make the mistake of doing is that we will never take your<br />
support for granted, and we will never take the support of the Australian people for<br />
granted. Australian people are great, as we all know, we are great levellers. We have<br />
a very sceptical appreciation of somebody when he or she believes that in some way<br />
they hold a position of authority through some kind of divine gift and not as a gift of<br />
the Australian people. I've seen many governments and many political leaders before<br />
me be cut down by the Australian people because they have got out of touch and one<br />
of the things that I am determined to do is that I won't get out of touch and that my<br />
Ministers won't get out of touch and that my members of Parliament won't get out of<br />
touch and that means that we have to do what we are doing today and what we are<br />
doing when Parliament is not sitting and that is getting out of Canberra, out of Sydney<br />
and Melbourne and getting around the rest of Australia listening to peoples' concerns,<br />
explaining what we are on about, articulating the values of the Government and<br />
listening to peoples' concerns. We are an enthusiastic bunch of people. Can I say<br />
thirteen years is an awfully long time to be in opposition. It is an eternity. I'll never go<br />
back to it. I mean, it is just terrible. And I know that there are lots of people in this<br />
gathering who shared every moment of those 13 years of agony of frustration and I<br />
admire the patience and the tolerance and the understanding and the charity that you<br />
displayed towards the political representatives of the Liberal and National parties over<br />
that period of time because you must have felt let down and disappointed if not even </p>
<p>more strongly so over that period of time. But that is behind us, we have this<br />
marvellous opportunity to sensibly shape Australia as we go into the next millennium<br />
and it is an Australia built on the sort of things that all of us hold in common. It is an<br />
Australian society that does reward effort, that is built on the notion of mutual<br />
obligation. You can't hold a society together unless we look after each other, but<br />
looking after each other involves both rights and responsibilities and that of course is a<br />
very very important principle to understand and as we look towards the turn of the<br />
century we naturally think of the regeneration of our environment, that this<br />
tremendously valuable asset we have in the Australian environment does need care, it<br />
does need nurturing, it does need regeneration and it does need investment and long<br />
term investment and I am very proud to say and I'll finish on this, that my government<br />
is the first government in the history of Australia to make such a long term<br />
commitment of capital and a long term policy commitment to the regeneration and the<br />
re-invigoration of the Australian environment and the people and the area of the<br />
Murray Darling Basin of Australia will be the principle beneficiaries of that visionary<br />
policy and in the years to come, I believe the initiative of the Natural Heritage Trust<br />
will be seen as the great post-war environmental initiative of any government in the<br />
history of Australia.<br />
Thank you. </p>
