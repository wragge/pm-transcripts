EMBAL OED UNTIL 7.15 P. M. 10TH NOVEMBER, 1966<br />
NATIONAL BROADCAST NO. 1<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. HAROLD HOLT<br />
Security is the theme of this broadcast security<br />
not only for the nation, but for the individual.<br />
Nationalsecurity is linked with the adequacy of<br />
our defence forces and the strength of our alliances.<br />
Security for the individual depends on how<br />
successfully the economy is conducted and how justly the<br />
national wealth is distributed.<br />
As to national security. We have a small population<br />
living in a vast continent. We cannot hope to<br />
do by ourselves alone all that is necessary to preserve<br />
that security. This is so even if we tried to turn<br />
Australia into an isolated fortress and abandoned<br />
vigorous development.<br />
' We have fortified ourselves by joining with others<br />
in building a mutual security system through treaties<br />
such as SEATO and ANZUS.<br />
The Labor Party says that Australia should withdraw its<br />
forces from South Vietnam. They condemn the participation<br />
there of national servicemen who are enabling<br />
us to maintain our Regular Army Units in Australia and<br />
overseas at the strengths recommended by our military<br />
advisers. Under the ANZUS Treaty the United States, New<br />
Zealand and ourselves have undertaken to resist aggression<br />
directed against any one of us. You can form your own<br />
judgment as to how much value would remain in this<br />
Treaty if Australia were to walk out on these friends and<br />
allies. They would never have the same confidence in<br />
Australia again. I am sure the effect on America, in<br />
particular would be most destructive. Even if the<br />
Treaty continued in a formal sense, we could never again<br />
place the same reliance on it for our safety.<br />
These matters are sure to be discussed extensively<br />
at my public meetings so I should like to deal now with<br />
some aspects of domestic security which concern every<br />
household. You have a vested interest in the strength<br />
and welfare of Australia. An expanding Australia with<br />
a strong, soundly-based economy, should be capable of<br />
consistently giving full employment to its people. This<br />
contributes greatly to your security.<br />
Regular employment and good w. ages are basic to<br />
the security of the family. Australia has a record in<br />
this respect unsurnassed amonrst the free Deoples of<br />
the world. There has been only one month in the seventeen<br />
years in which we have been in office when<br />
registrations for employment touched three per cent. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
For most of our period of office, the registrations have<br />
hToe vehraeved asbuocucte ssofneu llpye r abcesnotr. b edw iatdhd ijtoio onvsa caton cithees wpolreknftoirfcuel.<br />
from migration and our own natural increase. This has<br />
helped us to become a nation of home ovmers with the<br />
highest percentage of home ownership anywhere recorded.<br />
Only the United States and Canada surpass us in<br />
the percentage of motor vehicles to the population.<br />
There are other important indicators of the solid<br />
base to the security of the individual citizen. Our<br />
people hold more than seven and a half million life<br />
insurance policies, having a total value of more than<br />
fifteen thousand million dollars. At the end of August<br />
they held $ 5 356 million in the Savings Banks and had,<br />
at the end of September, more than 5,000 million on<br />
deposit with the Trading 3anks. These figures spell<br />
continuing prosperity, and in no country is that<br />
prosperity more widely shared.<br />
It would be an act of national folly to hand over<br />
to a socialist party a country so soundly conducted and<br />
which has enjoyed these fruits of a free enterprise<br />
philosophy; and to hand over to a socialist party so<br />
demonstraiy incapable of governing itself that it is<br />
clearly incapable of effectively governing the nation.<br />
( This talk will be broadcast by the A. J. C.<br />
Network at 7.15 Thursday, 10th November.<br />
It is the first of six five minute broadcasts<br />
to be made by ' Mr. Holt during the election<br />
campaign. The broadcasts will be heard in<br />
all States.) </p>
