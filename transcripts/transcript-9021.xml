PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
LAUNCH OF THREE HOUSES. GLENN MURCUTT BY E. M. FARRELLY<br />
SYDNEY 3 NOVEMBER 1993<br />
I am delighted to bc here today to launch this fascinating book by Elizabeth Farrelly<br />
on the work of Glenn Murcutt.-<br />
My delight is all the greater because the launch is taking place here at Tusculum,<br />
which some or you may bc aware is one of my favourite buildings in Sydney.<br />
You may also be aware that its architect, John Verge, is in my view one of the great<br />
Australian architects. As is Glenn Murcutt, of course.<br />
There is a happy convergence between the work of the two, and indeed with the<br />
launch of the book today. For among his many outstanding commissions, Glenn was<br />
responsible for the completion of the one remaining fragment of the John Verge villa<br />
" Engehurst" in Ormond Street, Paddington.<br />
And, as his biographer says, Glenn's solution to completing the fragment later served<br />
as the model for the Rall-Fastaway house, one of the three which are the subject of<br />
the present volume.<br />
The timing of this book is very appropriate. It comes when Australians are concerned<br />
as never before about the role of planning and development in this country. A role on<br />
which Glenn Murcutt has always been most forthright.<br />
I was interested to discover from this book that a perception of Glenn Murcutt as a<br />
peculiarly Australian romantic in his approach to building design has cared him<br />
headlines such as " The Outback Warrior" in the overseas press.<br />
As another Australian with romantic inclinations who also on occasion attracts the<br />
talents of foreign headline writers, I can sympathisc with him about the infinite<br />
capacity of such people to be spectacularly wrong or their ability to go for the<br />
superficial rather than the reasoned analysis.<br />
Such an approach to her subject matter would be unimaginable in Elizabeth Farrelly's<br />
case, and we are all the richer for it.<br />

<p>While this work will undoubtedly be a major contributor to a debate of continuing<br />
importance for architects. Elizabeth has also provided the rest of us with a volume<br />
which presents scrious issucs in a way which neither patronises or mystifies the lay<br />
reader. And that is particularly important For thc issues which the architecture of Glenn<br />
Murcutt throws up are ones that are ultimately the concern of all Australians.<br />
The houses which are the subject matter of this book. the three iconic houses, as<br />
Elizabeth describes them, are for many Australians, quintessentially Australian<br />
houses. They are. houses which make a statement about thc sort of country we live in. To use<br />
Glienn's own words, houses which arc his response to the genius of the place to a<br />
land of incredible strcngth combined with unimaginable delicacy.<br />
These three houses encourage us to think about where. we have come from and about<br />
where we are going. They challenge us to contemplate the possibility ( if anarchitecture,<br />
and, in wider terms, an approach to urban design, in which aesthetic and<br />
functional considerations live in harmony.<br />
More and more Australians are coming to realise the importance of urban design to<br />
the attainment of the quality of lifc to which we aspire.<br />
We are, I believe, coming to understand that what makes Australia such a privileged<br />
place to live is in danger of being lost through poor planning through the imposition<br />
or an alien schema, as Glenn Murcutt describes it.<br />
And his remedy is spot on " The land appeals for care and we need to become friends<br />
with the landscape and not be threatened by it."<br />
I might add that we need to temper our approach to the development of our landscape<br />
with an eye to the long term future, rather than exploit it as an easy source of<br />
immediate profit. In terms of development, greed is never good.<br />
This prescription is as applicable to the city fringe as it is to the city centre; as<br />
relevant to the planning of development along our coastline as it is to the preservation<br />
of our inland waterways.<br />
Devclopment is not just a problem for the city or the bush, depending on where you<br />
live. Its a matter for consideration wherever it occurs in Australia.<br />
Recognising the dimensions of the issue sometimes appears to be the furthest thing<br />
from the minds of those who should most be aware of it our planners and<br />
developers. And even when they see a problem, at times we justifiably despair that<br />
they will ever come close to finding an appropriate solution.<br />
It is no secret that developers and planners are Glenn Murcutt's least favourite people.<br />
Local authoritics, he says, are " so often stupid, absolutely stupid and unreasonable.<br />
800' ON 9V': IT Å“ 6^ ON' 2 -131 </p>
<p>Our building regulations inventorise mediocrity and our councils administer and<br />
police such conservatism."<br />
To quote Elizabeth. " he laments the wholesale slaughter of our city by developers, but<br />
sees this process as complete, describing Sydney city centre as a gagglc of rubbish..<br />
junk and rubbish." He sees the countryside in terms of the " destruction of the flora<br />
and the displacement of the fauna with the blessing, if not active collusion of our<br />
subdivision regulations."<br />
This is a dccply pessimistic picture. But one hard not to share at times.<br />
While Glenn has generally chosen to respond to this situation by withdrawal from<br />
working in the city and by refusal to participate in the design of large scale works<br />
( although I'm delighted that this did not prevent him from working to redesign the<br />
Customs H-ouse) this is not an option which I bclieve is availablc to the<br />
Commonwealth Government.<br />
On the contrary. I believe it is imperative that we become a lot more involved in these<br />
issues, which have hitherto been the almost exclusive preserve of the other levels of<br />
Government. This is why I am announcing today that I have established a Task Force on Urban<br />
Design. In reviewing the quality of urban design in Australia, the Task Force will focus on<br />
ways in which the day to day working, residential and recreational environment of<br />
most Australians might be enhanced by more thoughtful attention to design.<br />
Its not just a Matter of building new and impressive structures to amaze and delight<br />
us, although there will be a place for that where and when appropriate. Who, for<br />
example, could now imagine Sydney without the Opera House. whose anniversary we<br />
are currently celebrating?<br />
And its certainly not a matter of confecting facades, as Glenn describes it.<br />
Nor is it just a matter of preserving our built heritage buildings such as Tusculum<br />
important though that is.<br />
Rather it's a matter of focussing on the total picture. Of looking at towns, suburbs,<br />
regions even, and dctcrmining how they might work better, while at the samne time<br />
preserving those unique characteristics with which their communities identify.<br />
It's about developing on the community scale what for Glenn Murcutt has always<br />
been crucial in his design of houses a scnsc of place.<br />
It's about better relating whcre people work to where they live. It's about getting the<br />
children to schools which they look forward to going to. It's about being able to go to<br />
the shops without having a car or waiting for hours for public transport which may or<br />
may not arrive. It's ahout having the right housing mix for the location, and proper<br />
oo eon, . j onnflnm Oft-TT ( 9' AkJ cI </p>
<p>health and recreational facilities. And allowing our elderly citizens to enjoy their<br />
retirement. It's about making better use of existing infrastuceture, rather than a process of endless<br />
urban sprawl.<br />
We will probably see the usual knee jerk rection to this task force.<br />
Don't bc, surprised if you hear talk about a new ) U RD. It will be a typical example<br />
of the usc of misinformation by those who benefit from the status quo those who<br />
feel that their immediate intere. sts are threatened<br />
And don't be surprised if you hear us accused of making people conform to a boring<br />
bureaucratic standard.<br />
Nothing of course is further from our minds.<br />
What we want to do is to put a bit of poetry into the souls of our town clerks-and shireengineers<br />
to get our planners and architects to come up with ideas with a sense of<br />
the miraculous, to focus on the wider questions of urban form rather than restricting<br />
themselves to narrow interpretation of land use regulations.<br />
Nor arc wc looking for a stultifying conformity of planning correctncss. As Elizabeth<br />
points out in her book, for Glenn Murcutt there is no contradiction between<br />
disparateness and harmony in his approach to designing houses " harmony is about<br />
disparate sounds which when put together make a pleasing whole not monotony,<br />
not sameness."<br />
But there is a different point, not sameness or monotony but uniformity.<br />
I have long held the view that grandeur of form most commonly or obviously<br />
emerges from uniformity perhaps a variegated uniformity but a consistency.<br />
It seems that these days this is the one thing we arc supposed to most forthrightly<br />
eschew. Any sense of this other meaning of sameness, a sameness which involves<br />
variations on a theme.<br />
These days the inculcation is that individuality is everything that no whim or fancy<br />
should be subjugated to a commnon purpose or even the greater glory of a greater<br />
whole. The grandeur which emerges from a mountain view is-generally a commentary on its<br />
uniformity or scale. As is say a coastal view with the juxtaposition of the sea with<br />
its consistent mass meshing with the. uniformity of the beach or even a forest.<br />
The same is true of architecture whether it is the massing on the canals of St<br />
Petersburg, or the variegated uniformity of Bath or the disparate harmonies of the<br />
pia7as of Venice, or the egg carton classicism of thc Greek Islands or even Paddo<br />
and Carlton. </p>
<p>In each case thc architect's whims and fancies have been played out lie the shadows<br />
on a mountain rather than the re-definition of an excavation.<br />
Architects too can profit spiritually in signing up to schemes greater than most are<br />
individually capable of devising.<br />
Working within an environment should be regarded as the done thing more often than<br />
not-The Task Force, I am pleased to say. is composed of people with a bit of magic in<br />
their makeup, and I thank them for donating their time to this task. Thecy are all busy<br />
professionals in their varied fields. What brings them together is thcir common<br />
interest in seeing uis do things better, and their conviction that we ought to be able to<br />
do so through a process of education rather than by spending money.<br />
I want in particailar to thank the Convenor or tihe Task Force, John Mant. who is<br />
unstinting in his scrvice.<br />
The Task Force should have a report ready for us early in the New Year, and-both<br />
Brian H-owe, who has a crucial role in this matter, and I look rorward to recciving it.<br />
in 1962, just after Glenn Murcutt graduated, one of the doyens of Australian<br />
architccture, Robin Boyd, wrote that, in relation to architecture, the Australian public<br />
appears ready to encourage new ideas for the first time In short, Australian<br />
building may have grown up."<br />
Since then, Glenn Murcutt has done Australia proud. His many awards both<br />
domestically and internationally attest to his success. It is crucial that we learn from<br />
him. That is why the book which is being launched today is so important.<br />
Especially when it is written by a person who is such an eminent architectural<br />
commentator, and an elected public official with such a strong commitment to the<br />
betterment of our built environment.<br />
Fspecially when it is written with such insight and clarity.<br />
It gives me much pleasure to welcome the publication of Three Houses Glenn<br />
Murcutt by Elizabeth Farrelly. I urge you all to read it.<br />
Thank you..<br />
