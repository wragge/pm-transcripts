SPEECH TO THE STATE ZIONIST COUNCIL ON THE OCCASION<br />
OF THE 34TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF ISRAEL<br />
In 1948, wh~ en the State of Israel was founded, it seemed<br />
that the dream of Jewish people everywhere was at the point<br />
of realisation. That dream was the<br />
attainment of' peace and justice, after centuries of deprivation.<br />
Israel's crea~ tion seemed to offer at last the great fulfilment<br />
of " a haven for the Jewish people". But in the few decades<br />
since the achievement of that independence in 1948, Israel has<br />
had to fight four wars to maintain it.<br />
There could be no more bitter reminder of how hard it can<br />
be to secure a goal which most Australians take for granted,<br />
the goal of national survival, of national security and safety. ThroughLit the<br />
34 years of its history, Israel has lived in ' an envi ronmaent of continuous<br />
threat s to its very existence.<br />
Few Australians have experience of living under--such a threat,<br />
most of us can only try to imagine what it must be like. : But<br />
our . appreciat-ion of the magnitude of Israel's difficulties<br />
is no less intense for that. That appreciation lies at the<br />
heart of Aust~ ralia' s unreserved support for Israel's right<br />
to exist over the last 34 years. Our belief in this right<br />
has remained central to our Middle East policy throughout these!<br />
years and this policy will not change.<br />
It is now app roaching five years since President Sadat.<br />
visited Israel and made his historic address to the Knesset,<br />
thus opening up the period of Israel-Egypt rapprochement which<br />
has given so much hope for the future. Through that visit, and<br />
through the IEsraelis' willingness to respond, the stage was<br />
set for reso: lving the hatred, bitterness and suspicion<br />
engendered by the conflicts since the Second World War.<br />
That resolution is nowhere near fully accomplished. But<br />
the curtain on the first act is coming down as Israel completes<br />
its voluntary withdrawal from the Sinai under the Camp David<br />
Agreements with Egypt.<br />
This voluntary withdrawal, coming at this time, means that<br />
future generations will attach a very special significance to<br />
the 34th anniversary of -Israel which we all celebrate . tonight.<br />

This withdrawal will return to Egypt all the Egyptian<br />
territories occupied by Israel during the 1967 war. It is<br />
an action which has required great courage and great wisdom<br />
on the part of the Israeli Government and people. The<br />
territories were the gains of war, and they have been put to use<br />
as the coin of peace.<br />
With high levels of tensions elsewhere on Israel's immediate<br />
borders, in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, Israel has had to maintain<br />
high courage indeed to implement this peace on its border<br />
with Egypt. Egypt has been the only Arab neighbour with whom<br />
it has so far been possible for Israel to establish a treaty<br />
of peace. But let us hope that this year's anniversary'of<br />
Israeli independence will not only mark the end of a chapter in<br />
the search for peace in the Middle East. Let us hope it will<br />
also be remembered as the opening of a new chapter in this<br />
search, for peace, a search which is important to all countries,<br />
including Australia.<br />
I believe Australia can take pride in the fact that our<br />
participation in the peace process has been real, and that we<br />
have done what we can to advance a cause so close to all our<br />
hearts. We have contributed a contingent to the Peacekeeping<br />
Force, over 100 men, as well as equipment.<br />
The establishment of that force has been a crucial element,<br />
a decisive element, in the willingness of both Israel and<br />
Egypt to find and implement peace.<br />
There are two things which I would like to say about our<br />
participation in the Sinai Peacekeeping Force. Many people<br />
here will recall how fashionable it was after the* United<br />
Nations was frustrated as a peacekeeping agency by the attitude<br />
of the Soviet Union, to denounce the continued efforts of<br />
Israel," Egypt and the United States to maintain the momentum<br />
of peac6. The Australian Government had to consider the<br />
question of cur participation in the Peacekeeping Force against<br />
a chorus of scepticism about the Camp David peace process.<br />
There was widespread doubt and cynicism about President<br />
Reagan's request that Australia join the multinational<br />
force. and -a good deal'of alarm in some places aboutwhLat might<br />
be involved.<br />
When we took our decision last October, making it conditional<br />
on significant European participation, we had no certainty that<br />
wide-ranging participation would eventuate. But we-felt that<br />
a country lik e Australia could make a significant contribution,<br />
that we couldI help -icourage other countries * to take part so that the f orcE<br />
could be put into) being. We felt the risks of failure were o6utweighed<br />
by the positiLve gains to be achieved.<br />
Our decision involved making a judgement against an uncertain<br />
future. There are risks, especially in a democracy, in coming<br />
to decisions which have to be based on assessments which cannot<br />
be proved, blut in an uncertain world, taking such-risks is. sometimes<br />
well justifiEd. Henry Kissinger, who played a key part in<br />
building up confidence between Egypt and Israel, recently<br />
made a comment which is very relevant to this. " Often", he<br />
said, " expertise consists of management of the familiar-#. while<br />
society needs a vision of a future that no one has yet<br />
experienced". </p>
<p>-3<br />
As everyone knows, the Australian Government's judgement<br />
and decision on the Peacekeeping force has been confirmed<br />
by events. A wide cross-section of the international community<br />
has become involved, and the members of the Peacekeeping-<br />
Force are now taking up their positions from El Arish to<br />
the straits of Tiran. There is little doubt that Australia's<br />
decision was a catalyst in achieving the genuinely multinational<br />
force which was clearly vital for success. It is a matter<br />
for satisfaction that little of the cynicsm of earlier days is now<br />
to be heard.--<br />
There have been futher gains as well. As a consequence<br />
of the wide participation in the force, a number of Israel's<br />
friends have gained a better aw.. areness of the risks Israel has taken<br />
8f the -courage Israel has shown. Since the European governments--reached their<br />
agreements with Israel to join the force, President Mitterrand<br />
and Lord Carrington both visited Israel. Both held discussions<br />
which were constructive and gave reassurance to the Israelis<br />
that European policy goes beyond the development of dialogue<br />
with the Arabs. They obtained in turn a clearer understanding<br />
of the imperatives of security for Israel.<br />
All of this should be of comfort to Israel, and it is<br />
certainly gratifying to Australia, for there can be<br />
genuine advances in perceptions of problems and attitudes<br />
to their solution as a result of such meetings and discussions.<br />
This leads me to a further aspect of Australia's approach<br />
in relation to our support for the peacekeeping force.<br />
our concern from the start has been f orw. ard-looking and<br />
the Camp David Accords contain two parts. The first deals<br />
with the return of the Sinai, and only a very few years<br />
ago it would have been hard to believe that the success<br />
which is now imminent could cone so quickly.<br />
The other part deals with autonomy for the<br />
inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza after the establishment<br />
of an elected self-governing authority. As I have noted on<br />
other occasions, these two parts of the accords are not<br />
separate: they are interconnected two parts of a total<br />
and very carefully negotiated package at Camp David.<br />
Recent outbreaks of violence in cities on the West Bank<br />
show how close to the surface are the tensions that<br />
exist in that territory. The aspirations of the Palestinians<br />

to be found for Israel to give appropriate recognition to them.<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
We believe, as Mr Street said during his recent visit to<br />
Israel, that the legitimate rights of the Palestinians<br />
include a homeland alongside Israel, and the right<br />
to participate directly in decisions affecting their future.<br />
This of course is not recognition of the PLO.<br />
Indeed, while the PLO refuses to recognise Israel's.. right to<br />
exist, there can be no consideration by Australia of the question<br />
of recognising the PLO. If the PLO genuinelywants peace,<br />
they will change their policies, they will recognise<br />
Israel's undoubted right to live within secure and<br />
recognised borders. Their denial of Israel's right to<br />
exist is provocative. It does nothing to open the<br />
door to peace. Without willingness by the PLO to face the<br />
reality of Israel's rights, there will be little with<br />
which to build on what has already been achieved. </p>
