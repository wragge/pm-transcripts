PRIE HINISTER'S TOUR OF SOUTH-EAST ASIA 661/ 067<br />
The following is text of Speech by<br />
Vietnamese Prime hinister Ky and the Australian<br />
Prime Minister, Mr. Holt's reply. 22ND APRIL. 1966<br />
Speech by Prime Minister Ky<br />
On behalf of the Government and the people of Vietnam,<br />
I have the honour of welcoming you to this country.<br />
Your visit of today has a very special significance<br />
since it takes place at a time when we exert ourselves to repel<br />
Communist invasion and build a new society for Vietnam with the<br />
staunch support and assistance of your country especially with<br />
the participation of the gallant Australian soldiers.<br />
It is more than an evidence of friendship, or a reason<br />
for strengthening unity between cur two countries.<br />
Your visit has the value of a pledge a pledge to<br />
stand in the forefront of the cause of justice, freedom and human<br />
happiness. Such a pledge is all the more valuable since it has<br />
come voluntarily, is fostered by a vigilant spirit and motivated<br />
by altruism. The people of Vietnam will never forget what the former<br />
Prime Minister Robert M1enzies once said: " The Republic of Vietnam<br />
is one of the frontiers of human freedomn', and therefore to<br />
abandon that country now would mean a Communist takeover and<br />
imperil neighbouring countries in South-East Asia.<br />
Also, your Excellency, allow me to say that the five<br />
points that you yourself defincu recently concerning the problem<br />
of Vietnam are indicative of the chivalrous spirit of the people<br />
of Australia. The valiant and brave soldiers that Australia has<br />
generously sent here to share the fighting and 1, ictories with us<br />
for the past year and who will be strengthened soon let alone<br />
Australian aid under various other forms are the materialisation<br />
of the ideals I mentioned earlier.<br />
' Je, the Vietnamese people, very highly appreciate such<br />
friendship built on sacrifice and generosity.<br />
, Ve will never betray the friendship of our friends and<br />
allies. With the trauitional and indomitable spirit of the<br />
Vietnamese people, with the resolute determination to win of the<br />
present generation, with the strong support of our allies, we will<br />
fight to repel invasion, tc achieve entire freedom, to give our<br />
people a new and happy life ana also to bring a substantial<br />
contribution to consolidation of world peace.<br />
This, we believe, will be the most efficient way of<br />
showing our gratitude to our friends for their support in this<br />
critical hour of our history. </p>
<p>Speech by Australian Prime Minister,<br />
Mr. Harold Holt<br />
Your Excellency, I am very appreciative of this warm<br />
welcome that you have given me on behalf of the people of your<br />
country. Australia's friendship with your country is well<br />
established and I think you know of our admiration for the gallant<br />
resistance which the people of South Viet Nan have been making<br />
against the Communist aggression which has threatened you for so<br />
many years. have seen this not merely as a resistance in order<br />
to preserve your own national integrity, but we have seen it as a<br />
resistance which is in the interest of a free people, no: t only<br />
throughout South-East Asia but indeed free people throughout every<br />
part of the world.<br />
I For as long as Communist aggression persists, as long<br />
as the Chinese philosophy of Communist domination persists, then<br />
free people everywhere throughout the world will be threatened,<br />
and you have been in the forefront of this resistance.<br />
r e, with the United States which is making such an<br />
enormous contribution for security here, and other allies who are<br />
lending assistance to you are proud that there is an Australian<br />
force and other Australian elements here in your country making<br />
the contribution of which you have spoken in terms of such<br />
appreciation. we hope, your Excellency, that as our enlarged force<br />
reaches your country that we will be able to join with you not<br />
| merely in the military tasks, of overriding importance though they<br />
be, until peace and stability has been restored here, but while<br />
our troops are with you we hope that they will be giving you<br />
assistance also in other important fields of civic administration<br />
S-in health and sanitation, in education, in transport, in road<br />
construction, in a variety of positive and helpful ways which can<br />
enable you or assist you to build that better South Viet Nam<br />
which I know is your own personal aspiration and the objective of<br />
the people of your country.<br />
It is perhaps of interest to your people to realise<br />
how close we have become to each other as a result of the<br />
improvements in modern transport.<br />
To me it is something of a revelation that I could be<br />
answering questions in the House of Representatives in Canberra<br />
yesterday morning up until 11.15 an. here I an the next day in<br />
company with you and able to convey our greetings directly to the<br />
people of your country.<br />
We recognize with you that the tasks ahead here will<br />
be difficult anc. they may be long, but we share your own determination<br />
and resdlution and that of the United States of America, to<br />
see that freedom is preserved in this country and that by tne<br />
force of that example the forces of freedom will be encouraged to<br />
make their own resistance wherever Communist aggression may<br />
threaten. WVe believe that you are performing a great service to<br />
the free people of the world, and I express on behalf of my fellow<br />
countrymen our gratitude and appreciation to you.<br />
