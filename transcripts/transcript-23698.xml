    <content><![CDATA[<p>Young Australians will be able to help deliver important local conservation outcomes with the first round of 196 Green Army projects formally launched today.</p>
<p>Over the next three years, 1500 projects will roll out across the country, mobilising 17-24 year olds to join the largest ever team of young Australians to support environmental action.</p>
<p>The first year of the Green Army will see 2,500 young people work on 250 projects across Australia. This will build to 15,000 by 2018/19.</p>
<p>The Green Army was a key Coalition election commitment and with $525 million funding over the next four years, the Green Army is one of the Government's major environmental initiatives.</p>
<p>The projects announced today include community-led projects that support practical, grassroots environment and conservation activities while providing meaningful training and skills to young people in the region.</p>
<p>Green Army projects include koala habitat restoration; protecting national heritage places; revegetating river catchments, coastal foreshores, rainforests and wetlands; constructing boardwalks; working closely with traditional owners and restoring culturally significant sites; pest animal management; upgrading walking tracks; and monitoring threatened species.</p>
<p>Participants will be eligible to receive an allowance and can gain Certificate I or Certificate II qualifications in areas such as land management, park management, landscaping or horticulture.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government has engaged five highly experienced environmental, recruitment and employment organisations to recruit Green Army participants and help manage Australiaâs largest ever environmental movement.</p>
<p>Conservation Volunteers Australia will oversee a number of projects in every state and will be assisted by organisations including Greening Australia. Landcare Australia Limited will assist Manpower Services (Australia) Pty Ltd.</p>
<p>Other Services Providers include Job Futures Limited, Workskil Australia Incorporated, and Campbell Page Limited together with Skillset Limited.</p>
<p>These Service Providers will be responsible for managing work health and safety, training, paying allowances and overseeing project management.</p>
<p>Young Australians interested in joining the Green Army can apply through the appointed service providers for each state and territory. Contact details are available online at:<br />
