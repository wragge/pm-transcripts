AUSTRALIA-MALTA AIR SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS<br />
The Acting Prime Minister Mr Kim Beazley, and the Deputy Prime Minister of Malta,<br />
Dr Guido de Marco announced today that Australia and Malta had agreed to open<br />
negotiations immediately on an Air Services Agreement between the two countries.<br />
The Ministers expressed their hope that an Air Services Agreement could be concluded<br />
expeditiously, so that scheduled direct air links between the two countries could be<br />
established for the first time.<br />
Professor Guido de Marco said that this was a very pleasing outcome from his visit to<br />
Australia. It was further evidence of the close working relationship between the<br />
Australian and Maltese Governments.<br />
Mr Beazley said that the prospect of direct air links would be of particular interest to<br />
the many Australians of Maltese origin, who play an important role in maintaining<br />
close relations between both nations. The business community, especially exporters,<br />
also stood to gain from the new market access which direct air links might provide.<br />
