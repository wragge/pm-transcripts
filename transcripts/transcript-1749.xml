FOR PRESS: VLAR PM. No. 2/ 1968<br />
ABANDONMENT OF PORTSEA SEARCH<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon John McEwen<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr McEwen, announced today that<br />
the organised search for the late Mr Harold Holt would cease tomorrow<br />
( Friday) following advice given yesterday by the Victorian Government.<br />
The Victorian Government said the Chief Commissioner of<br />
police, after consultation with representatives of other organisations<br />
participating In Portsea Searcil advises that It Is the opinion of all<br />
concerned that It Is quite hopeless to pursue search further.<br />
It was with the deepest regret, said Mr McEwen, that the<br />
Commonwealth Government had agreed that there was no purpose in<br />
continuing the search any longer. Every area where any clue to Mr Holt's<br />
disappearance might be found had b een searched thoroughly many times.<br />
The search over the past eighteen days had extended westward<br />
to Barwon Heads and eastward beyond Cape Schanck. It had covered<br />
extensively Cheviot Bay and other ocean beaches, the Point Nepean headland<br />
and the bayside beaches in proximity to the Rip.<br />
The Search operation had been co-ordinated by the Victorian<br />
Police and had included the Navy, Army and Air Force, civil aircraft,<br />
a number of Commonwealth and State organisations, volunteer forces and<br />
members of the general public.<br />
Everything had been done in an effort to establish the fate of<br />
Mr Holt. A helicopter search and beach patrols had been maintained<br />
this week but would now be withdrawn on Friday.<br />
" I take this opportunity once again", said Mr McEwen, " of<br />
publicly thanking all those who responded so promptly and have given<br />
their time to this exthaustive and continuous search."<br />
