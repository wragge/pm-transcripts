PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
SIR ROBERT MULDOON<br />
I sent today the following condolence message to the New<br />
Zealand Prime Minister on the occasion of the death of<br />
Sir Robert -Muldoon:-<br />
I was saddened today to learn of Sir Robert<br />
Muldoon's death.<br />
Sir Robert will be remembered as a significant<br />
national leader who played a prominent role in<br />
regional affairs. He also contributed greatly to<br />
our important bilateral relationship. He was a<br />
strong advocate of the Closer Economic Relations<br />
agreement, which has been of such benefit to both<br />
our countries.<br />
I should be grateful if you could pass my<br />
condolences, and those of the Australian<br />
Government and people, to Lady Muldoon and Sir<br />
Robert's family.<br />
The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe, will represent the<br />
Australian Government at the funeral for Sir Robert which<br />
will be held on Friday morning in Auckland.<br />
