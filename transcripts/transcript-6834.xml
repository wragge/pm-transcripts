TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE AT THE LODGE FEBRUARY 9, 1986<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard is claiming to have given the Labor<br />
Government a kick in the shins Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: My shins are in the very best of shape. The outstanding<br />
loser out of Saturday is John Howard. Just look at the three<br />
areas where the people of Australia had something to say. And<br />
look at it in terms of Mr Howard and the Federal Liberals. First<br />
of all Scullin, where even with the donkey vote they could only<br />
get a five per cent swing, which is well within the normal<br />
by-election experience, achieve 22.7 per cent of the total vote<br />
and with the donkey vote. A massive rejection of Mr Howard's<br />
concentrated campaigning in the electorate. Western Australiaa<br />
disastrous day for the Liberals. In the Lower House they lost<br />
three seats to the Nationals, one seat to us. And they lost<br />
seats in the Upper House to the Nationals and the Labor Party.<br />
And Mr Burke and his team are to be congratulated on increasing<br />
their vote. A complete repudiation of the Federal Liberals. And<br />
in Tasmania, Mr Gray held office. It looks as though the number<br />
of seats will be the same probably. But Mr Howard was repudiated<br />
during the election. Mr Gray told him to keep out, he treated<br />
him like a leper. He didn't want the Federal Liberals in<br />
Tasmania. So, whichever way you look at it, a very, very black<br />
day for John Howard and the Federal Liberals. And I congratulate<br />
Mr Burke particularly in Western Australia for this historic<br />
achievement a return of the Labor Government, successive<br />
victories for the first time in 30 years there.<br />
JOURNALIST: What conclusions can you draw from the resurgence of<br />
the National Party in Western Australia?<br />
PM: I think you have to say this, that there is concern in the<br />
bush, and understandable concern about the position in which they<br />
find themselves. But they repudiated the Liberals and there is<br />
some sort of a protest vote there. Of course, what you have got<br />
to understand is the relationship between the Nationals and the<br />
Liberals in Western Australia is a poisonous relationship and so<br />
I think understandable that there was some sort of swing in the<br />
bush. But as far as the federal picture is concerned, no comfort<br />
for the major party there. And I don't think the National Party<br />
generally would be sensible to take any comfort from the present<br />
position because in my travels around the country I don't believe<br />
that the rural interests of this country see the National Party<br />
as their saviours. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Do you think there is any message there though for<br />
the Federal Government?<br />
PM: I can only, in these circumstances, pick up from Mr Howard.<br />
Mr Howard said give Mr Hawke a kick in the shins. Now, it was<br />
said in regard to Scullin that it had to be a swing of at least<br />
per cent to be any adverse message. They were battling to get I<br />
five per cent and that was with the donkey vote. As far as<br />
Western Australia is concerned an improvement in our overall<br />
position. And Tasmania has been out of the mainstream of, if you<br />
like, of federal politics now since 1983. what you have got to<br />
face up to now is what I have been saying for some time. I said<br />
clearly following the South Australian results. The Liberal<br />
Party is in total disarray in this country. It has been<br />
repudiated by, the electorate. It hasn't won an election in<br />
mainland Australia since 1980. The Liberal Party is on the nose<br />
with the Australian electorate because they are irrelevant, they<br />
insult the intelligence of the Australian people. In election<br />
after election they come out with their irrelevant, ideological<br />
nonsense which has nothing to do with the real interests of<br />
Australian men and women. And while they continue to behave in<br />
this way they will be treated as they consistently are as an<br />
irrelevancy, an ideological, divided irrelevancy in the<br />
Australian political scene.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why can't the Labor Party do better in Tasmania?<br />
PM: Well, we suffered badly in 1982-83 down there over the dam<br />
issue. And that has been a residual factor. Mr Gray has been<br />
able to capitalise on the divisions that that caused within<br />
Tasmania and within the Labor Party. Now, I am confident however<br />
that, as far as the next federal election is concerned, we will<br />
be able to improve our position. I mean, after all if you have<br />
got no seats in the House of Representatives, you have got<br />
nothing but room for improvement. I think we can do that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you really wouldn't want the result in<br />
country Western Australia to be reflected in a federal election<br />
though in country seats, would you? So what will you be doing to<br />
ensure that doesn't occur?<br />
PM: Well, there are a number of things. I have asked Mr Kerin<br />
to prepare a submission for Cabinet to analyse what are the<br />
possible areas in which we can do something more to assist rural<br />
Australia. Secondly, I have started myself now to go out and<br />
meet individual Australian farmers. And I must say as a result<br />
of the experience I had during this week where I was able to sit<br />
down and basically listen rather than talk to, listen to farmers,<br />
their wives and their children, I certainly have got a sharpened<br />
sense, if you like, of the tragedy that exists out there. They<br />
understand that there are limits to what the Federal Government<br />
can do in this area. But I must say that when those submissions<br />
from Mr Kerin come before the Cabinet, we will be looking at them<br />
sympathetically to see what more we can do. You have got the<br />
tragedy, as I say, of very, very efficient Australian rural<br />
producers suffering now basically as a result of the corruption<br />
of international markets which has ruined the price situation<br />
for them. That means that they concentrate even more<br />
particularly on their internal cost structure. We have got to<br />
see what we can do to help them in that area. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Having regard to the nature of the campaign in<br />
Western Australia, how would you see the future of Aboriginal<br />
land rights legislation from here on?<br />
PM: well this is a matter which will be brought before the<br />
Cabinet by Mr Holding in the near future and as I said over<br />
there, I believe that we are going to be able to reach a<br />
situation where the interests of the State as well as of the<br />
Federal Government will be able to be accommodated. I said that<br />
in Western Australia and I believe that has been accepted there.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, interest rates and petrol prices are<br />
fairly significant costs for farmers. Is there anything you can<br />
do for them in those two areas?<br />
PM: Well, I have got nothing to add to the answer I gave before<br />
and I'll just repeat it. When Mr Kerin brings his submissions<br />
which will be basically concerned with the cost structure of<br />
farmers, we'll be looking to do what we can. I am not saying<br />
anything in advance of the Cabinet consideration of that<br />
submission.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, are you disappointed in the performance of<br />
Mr Wriedt in Tasmania?<br />
PM: I think Mr Wriedt had a very difficult job and I think he<br />
did as well as he could in the circumstances.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you believe he would survive a challenge?<br />
PM: Well, it is not for me to intrude. I don't know whether if<br />
there were another nomination Mr Wriedt would may not<br />
be a concept. I simply don't know and because I don't know I not<br />
going to proffer an opinion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you like to make a comment on the Philippines<br />
election? PM: Well, I don't know that I can say anything very penetrating<br />
on it. I have been kept informed by my own people and what they<br />
are saying is that you are just getting these different<br />
assessments. I would say on the basis of what has been put to me<br />
that it looks as though Mrs Aquino has polled well and has polled<br />
well enough to win if the elections allowed to run its fair<br />
course. That seems to be evidence as it is put to me.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, have you had any information on<br />
whether or not they have polled......<br />
PM: Well, my sources within Foreign Affairs are, over the<br />
weekend, analysing the information that's available in from a<br />
number of sources. All I would say is in a preliminary sense the<br />
indications that everyone has got not just those in official<br />
positions here. It seems to be that it hasn't been an entirely<br />
fair election.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you welcome an Aquino victory?<br />
PM: Well, let's wait and see the outcome. I mean I have made my<br />
comments about the present situation in the Philippines and it<br />
has incurred some cancellation of landing rights, I believe.<br />
