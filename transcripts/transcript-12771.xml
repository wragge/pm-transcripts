I am pleased to announce that the Commonwealth will make available an additional contribution of $1.6 million over four years for winter sport training and talent identification.<br />
The additional commitment to winter sports will assist with the development and training of athletes for international winter sports events, including both the Winter Olympics and Paralympics.  It will be provided under the Backing Australia';s Sporting Ability programme.<br />
The outstanding achievements of Australia';s Olympians and Paralympians at the recent Salt Lake City Winter Games again demonstrated the great skill and dedication of our young sporting men and women across a wide range of sports.<br />
The additional resources for winter sports will help provide our most talented athletes with the training and support required to allow them to continue to compete and make their mark at the highest level of international competition.</p>
