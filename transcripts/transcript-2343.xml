NEW YEAR MESSAGE TO THE NATION<br />
From the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
New Year's Day is a fitting time to take stock to note what Australia<br />
has achieved; and to consider what improvements and new achievements are re eded.<br />
We have finished the old year greater in numbers and with more material<br />
development than ever before. Most of us enjoy a standard of living and a way of<br />
life that few other countries in the world can equal. But many improvements are<br />
needed. Australians engaged in many rural industries are in economic straits<br />
due to no fault or dereliction of their own. Helping to solve this national problem<br />
must be our great task in the New Year.<br />
We are threatened, too, with the risk of money inflation illusory increaseo<br />
in money wages which will buy no more unless more is produced to buy an inflation<br />
which in the long run benefits no one and hurts everyone in the Nation. Combating<br />
this will be another great task in the New Year.<br />
If we all think in terms of producing more during each hour worked so that<br />
there will be more to divide between the worker, the einployer, the old, and the<br />
nation's demand for improved social action and further development of all kinds<br />
then the New Year can see us beating inflation and improving real living standards.<br />
We must push ahead with the task of further developing our natural<br />
resources with the highest possible degree of Australian ownership. We must encourage<br />
the growing public interest in the preservation of our environment. We must continue<br />
to attack poverty wherever it is found and it is not found only among some of those<br />
who draw pensions. We must continue to encourage self-expression and creative activity<br />
in the arts. We must continue to help our less fortunate neighbours. I believe<br />
these are the goals the nation should strive tw wards in the New Year.<br />
There will be discussion, and divided opinion on how best to move towards<br />
this achievement. I hope that such discussion will be rational, restrained and<br />
productive and that whatever the conflicting views on how to attain our goals there<br />
will be little division in the Nation as to the proper goals for which we should strive.<br />
If we can do this, then I believe the New Year will see our further advance<br />
as a nation and will prove to be that what I wish you all<br />
A Happy New Year.<br />
CA NBERRA<br />
