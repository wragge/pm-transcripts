STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ON NAMIBIA<br />
6 MARCH 1989<br />
Madam Speaker,<br />
I seek to leave to report to the House on recent events in<br />
Namibia and Australia's role in assisting the implementation<br />
of UN Security Council Resolution 435 of 1978, providing for<br />
the withdrawal of South African military forces from Namibia<br />
and the holding of elections under UN supervision and<br />
control<br />
As announced by the Ministers for Defence and Foreign<br />
Affairs and Trade on 2 March 1989, a contingent of three<br />
hundred Australian engineers will leave shortly for Namibia.<br />
They will form part of a United Nations Peacekeeping Force<br />
in Namibia that will help bring independence to Namibia<br />
after more than one hundred years of rule by foreign powers.<br />
The settlement of the long and complex issue of Namibian<br />
independence is an important international event. It is an<br />
event in which Australia has played, and will continue to<br />
play, a substantial part.<br />
During my recent visit to India, I noted that there had been<br />
much talk during the 1970s and early 1980s about an arc of<br />
instability stretching from southern Africa, through the<br />
Persian Gulf, through Afghanistan and South Asia and on to<br />
Indochina. We see now, if not an arc of peace, than at<br />
least an arc of peace-making. It is a process, facilitated<br />
by an improvement in superpower relations and aided by the<br />
constructive role of the United Nations, that is finally<br />
bringing the treasured goal of independence within sight of<br />
the people of Namibia.<br />
My Government recognises that the problems in southern<br />
Africa constitute one of the major challenges facing the<br />
international community. We have sought, through the United<br />
Nations, the Commonwealth and our own diplomatic links with<br />
countries in the region, to find peaceful solutions to the<br />
complex set of problems that trouble that region.<br />
In recent times, there has been little cause for optimism in<br />
southern Africa. The offensive doctrine of apartheid<br />
remains entrenched in South Africa's social, political and<br />
economic life. Civil wars with drastic human consequences<br />
continue in Mozambique and Angola. The Front Line States of<br />
southern Africa including fellow Commonwealth members such<br />
as Botswana, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe continue to be<br />
vulnerable to economic and military destabilisation. The<br />
question of Namibia, in many ways, encapsulated a number of<br />
these problems. </p>
<p>2.<br />
The fact that Namibia is now on the way to independence<br />
demonstrates that concerted international action, the<br />
determination of the region, and the goodwill of individual<br />
players can combine to bring solutions to longstanding<br />
problems in the region. For a southern Africa torn by<br />
attrition, deprivation and tragedy, recent moves on Namibia<br />
offer a glimmer of hope.<br />
The problem of Namibia has been with the international<br />
community for close on 70 Years. South Africa was appointed<br />
mandatary over the former German colony of South West Africa<br />
by the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, in circumstances<br />
similar to Australia's own mandate over Papua New Guinea.<br />
This mandate was confirmed by the League of Nations.<br />
After the Second World War, the League of Nations was<br />
superseded by the United Nations, and the mandate system by<br />
the trusteeship system. Alone of the former mandatary<br />
powers, South Africa refused to submit a trusteeship<br />
agreement for South West Africa, or Namibia, as it is now<br />
known. In 1966, the UN General Assembly resolved that South<br />
Africa's role in Namibia should be terminated, and that the<br />
responsibility for the territory should be assumed by a<br />
UN-appointed Council for Namibia. Despite these decisions,<br />
South Africa continued to govern Namibia against the wishes<br />
of the United Nations, and claimed sovereignty over it in<br />
the face of widespread international condemnation.<br />
South African rule has been opposed from within Namibia<br />
since 1957 by the South West African People's Organisation,<br />
SWAPO. SWAPO commenced an armed struggle in 1966, and was<br />
supported in this by Namibia's neighbour to the north,<br />
Angola, when it achieved independence in 1975.<br />
South Africa responded by supporting an insurgency against<br />
the Government of Angola, and by direct attacks against<br />
Angolan Government forces inside Angola. Angola sought<br />
Cuban involvement and as many as 50,000 Cuban troops have<br />
been deployed there at any one time. This involvement, with<br />
substantial Soviet backing, became a significant source of<br />
East-West tension.<br />
It has taken years to begin to untangle this mess. In 1978<br />
the UN agreed on a plan for a settlement contained in UN<br />
Security Council Resolution 435, but intransigence on all<br />
sides prevented that plan from being implemented. Then last<br />
year, in the context of reduced East-West tensions, the<br />
log-jam started to break up. South Africa agreed to<br />
withdraw its forces and to allow Namibia its independence,<br />
while Angola agreed to the withdrawal of Cuban forces and<br />
the removal of African National Congress camps from its<br />
territory. The signing of the Brazzaville Protocol on 22<br />
December last year by South Africa, Cuba and Angola has at<br />
last formalised the acceptance by South Africa of the 1978<br />
UN settlement plan. D q </p>
<p>Last month the UN Security Council agreed that the<br />
transition to independence for Namibia would begin on<br />
1 April 1989. Over the 12 months from that date the UN will<br />
monitor the withdrawal of foreign forces, oversee the<br />
drafting and adoption of a Constitution, and supervise the<br />
installation of a new Government after general elections.<br />
A vital element in this plan is the United Nations<br />
Transition Assistance Group, UNTAG. It will monitor the<br />
ceasefire and troop withdrawals, supervise elections, and<br />
support the maintenance of law and order in Namibia until<br />
the new government of independent Namibia is ready to take<br />
over. The scale of these tasks is reflected in the size of the<br />
force. UNTAG will have civilian, police and military<br />
elements. The military element will consist initially of<br />
4,650 personnel including three infantry battalions, with<br />
scope for expansion to 7,500 should the circumstances<br />
demand.<br />
Australia is providing the engineering component of UNTAG.<br />
our contingent of 23 officers and 277 other ranks will<br />
provide engineering and construction support to the UN<br />
effort. Such support will be sorely needed. Namibia is a<br />
large, arid, sparsely-populated and underdeveloped country<br />
which has been a war zone for many years. our engineers<br />
will build roads, bridges, airstrips and camps for UNTAG.<br />
They will have the very serious task of clearing mines which<br />
have been laid by the various contending forces along the<br />
border between Angola and Namibia.<br />
This is of course not the first time Australian personnel<br />
have been involved with a peacekeeping force in Africa; we<br />
participated in the Commonwealth force that monitored<br />
Zimbabwe's transition to independence in 1980. In that<br />
process, as in others before and since, Australian defence<br />
forces played a constructive role in what can be a difficult<br />
and sometimes dangerous process.<br />
Members of the Australian contingent will serve in Namibia<br />
for tours of six months, after which they will be replaced<br />
by a fresh contingent from Australia. The UN plans to<br />
complete Namibia's transition to independence within a year,<br />
but delays in this complex process are possible, and we may<br />
be called upon to stay longer than a year.<br />
The bulk of the Australian contingent will be based at<br />
Grootfontein in the north of Namibia, near the border with<br />
Angola. Elements of the contingent could be required to<br />
deploy into neighbouring countries to support UNTAG<br />
operations there.<br />
This is a very large and important commitment for Australia,<br />
comprising almost half of the Army's construction<br />
engineering capability. Careful planning, including the use<br />
of Reservists, has been required to ensure that<br />
high-priority engineering tasks closer to home can still be<br />
performed. </p>
<p>I am pleased to say that it has been possible to minimise<br />
the impact of the deployment on support to the operational<br />
deployment force, exercise Kangaroo 89, and the defence<br />
cooperation program in the South Pacific, where our<br />
engineers build wharves, airstrips and other essential<br />
infrastructure. It has to be understood that the political and military<br />
situation in the border region where the bulk of our men<br />
will be deployed will remain uncertain and outbreaks of<br />
fighting cannot be ruled out. members of the Australian<br />
contingent will travel often on minor and remote roads.<br />
They will be responsible for the dangerous work of clearing<br />
mines throughout the country. Threats are also posed by<br />
disease and the harsh environment.<br />
Against these dangers should be set the fact that our<br />
service personnel are experts in their profession; they are<br />
well trained and will be armed for self-defence.<br />
I can assure Honourable Members that the safety of the<br />
Australian contingent is uppermost in my mind. To ensure<br />
that we are kept fully informed of developments that may<br />
affect the well-being of the Australian contingent, the<br />
Government has decided to establish a temporary Australian<br />
Liaison office in the Namibian capital of Windhoek for the<br />
duration of the 12 month independence process. The Office<br />
will provide the Government with first hand reporting on<br />
political and military developments in the territory, during<br />
what at times is likely to be a difficult process. The<br />
Office will be headed by an experienced diplomat with many<br />
years background in African affairs.<br />
The Government has also ensured that members of the<br />
Australian contingent be adequately compensated for the<br />
hardships and dangers they will face through a comprehensive<br />
and generous set of conditions of service, including the<br />
payment of special allowances. In addition, the Treasurer<br />
will be seeking an amendment to the Income Tax Assessment<br />
Act to exempt the pay and allowances earned by Defence Force<br />
personnel while they are on tour with UNTAG. Repatriation<br />
benefits appropriate to the tasks and hazards encountered<br />
will also be provided.<br />
madam Speaker, our contribution to UNTAG and our involvement<br />
in the Namibian settlement makes Australia party to what may<br />
be one of the United Nations' most substantial achievements<br />
for many years. we have been involved in this process from<br />
the start. Australia has been a member of the UN Council<br />
for Namibia since 1974. we pledged our support for UNTAG at<br />
the inception of the UN plan for Namibia in 1978. Australia<br />
also made an important contribution to UN deliberations<br />
about Namibia during our recent term on the UN Security<br />
Council in 1985-86. </p>
<p>Our participation in UNTAG also builds on the constructive<br />
role successive Australian Governments have played on<br />
southern African issues. I pay particular tribute to the<br />
achievements of my predecessor Malcolm Fraser in this<br />
regard. Our decisive contribution to the attainment of<br />
independence by Zimbabwe, Australia's leading role in the<br />
Commonwealth on southern Africa affairs, our bilateral aid<br />
support for the member countries of the Southern African<br />
Development Co-ordination Conference all speak of a firm<br />
commitment to peace and stability in that region. Our<br />
involvement in the Eminent Person's Group was only one<br />
demonstration of our longstanding determination to work<br />
constructively to bring about an end to the repugnant<br />
policies of apartheid.<br />
I believe that the Namibian settlement, together with the<br />
resolution of the Iran-Iraq war and the end of Soviet<br />
military intervention in Afghanistan, marks a renewal of<br />
faith in the UN as an effective participant in international<br />
affairs after many years of cynicism and apathy about its<br />
role. The UN belongs on the centre stage of world affairs,<br />
not in the wings, and it is very encouraging that more and<br />
more countries are recognising this. I take this<br />
opportunity to pay tribute to the efforts of Martti<br />
Ahtisaari, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative<br />
on Namibia, for his important role, and those of the late<br />
Bernt Carlsson, the UN Commissioner for Namibia, who was<br />
tragically killed in the Lockerbie air disaster.<br />
I would like to think that Namibia's transition to<br />
independence will proceed to plan and that there will be no<br />
major setbacks. But such things are never certain. Our<br />
effort in Namibia will be the largest peacekeeping<br />
commitment in which this country has ever participated. It<br />
may also be the most difficult. I am sure that all<br />
Honourable Members of this House, and the people of<br />
Australia join me in wishing our troops well in their<br />
endeavours. We do so in the knowledge that they will make<br />
an outstanding contribution to the future peace and<br />
prosperity of an independent Namibian people and a more<br />
stable region. </p>
