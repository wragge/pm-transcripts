ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR-INTER-GOVERNMNNT RELATIONS<br />
The Premier of Queens'land today informed the Premiers'<br />
Ccnference that his Government had agreed to join the<br />
Advisory Counci-for Inter-Government Relations.<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, and the other Premiers welcomed<br />
Queensland's decision to become a member. " The Council has<br />
been incomplete without Queensland membership", Mr Fraser said.<br />
The Advisory Council for Inter-Government Relations is an<br />
essential feature of . the Federalism policy of the Commonwealth<br />
Government. The Advisory Council was established in 1976 with<br />
the object of improving inter-government co= operation.<br />
It receives references -from the Premiers' Conference to keep<br />
under consideration and review issues_ for inter-government<br />
co-operation and-to recommend ways and means for improving<br />
inter-government co-operation. To date the Advisory Council<br />
has been given two references. The first is to examine the<br />
relation-ships which ought to exist between the three spheres<br />
. of government. The second is an exanination of inter-changes<br />
of" personnel between the three spheres of government.<br />
PredlTiinary reports on each reference have been published.<br />
M*: bers of the Council are currently engaged in conducting<br />
p-blic meetings throughout Australia to discuss submissions<br />
on the relationship reference.<br />
The Conference also agreed to a request from the Council for<br />
a i~ increase in its Budget from $ 300,000 to $ 375,000.<br />
This increase in funding will ensure that the Council is able<br />
tc maintain and improve its contfibution to inter-government<br />
r-ticns in Australia. o0o---</p>
