    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government is providing 2.9 million Australians in regional and rural areas with around $4 billion in extra support to help with cost of living pressures and sustain economic growth.</p>
<p>The initiative is part of the Rudd Government's $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy that will strengthen regional economies and households, given the risk of a deep and prolonged global economic slowdown.</p>
<p>Pensioners, carers and families living in rural and regional Australia will benefit from additional financial assistance from 8 December.</p>
<p>Almost one million families in regional and rural Australia who receive Family Tax Benefit A will receive a lump sum payment of $1,000 in respect of each eligible child in their care.</p>
<p>The payment will also be made for each dependent child who attracts Youth Allowance, Abstudy, or a Veteran's Children's Education Scheme payment.</p>
<p>Around 1.9 million pensioners living in regional and rural Australia will get a down payment on longer term reforms because we recognise their need for early support.</p>
<p>Pensioners living in regional and rural communities will receive a one-off payment of $1,400 if they are single or $2,100 if they are a couple.</p>
<p>Recipients of the following payment will be eligible:</p>
<p>     * Age Pension;</p>
<p>     * Carer Payment;</p>
<p>     * Disability Support Pension;</p>
<p>     * Bereavement Allowance, Wife Pension, Widow B Pension, Partner Allowance, Widow Allowance;</p>
<p>     * Special Benefit;</p>
<p>     * Veterans' Affairs Service Pension; and</p>
<p>     * Veterans Income Support Supplement.</p>
<p>As well, those receiving Carer Allowance will receive $1,000 for each eligible person in their care.</p>
<p>The Government's economic package also includes help for self funded retirees in regional and rural areas seriously affected by the decline in the value of their investments.</p>
<p>In all 130,500 Commonwealth Seniors Health Card holders living in regional and rural Australia will receive a payment of $1,400 if they are single or $2,100 if they are a couple.</p>
<p>For the first time, lump sum payments are being extended to include 391,000 Disability Support Pensioners under the age of 65 living in non-metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>All payments will be tax exempt and not included for income-testing purposes.</p>
<p>Thousands of Australians in regional Australia will also benefit from the Rudd Government First Home Owners Boost.</p>
<p>     * First home buyers who purchase established homes will have their grant doubled from $7,000 to $14,000;</p>
<p>     * First home buyers who purchase a newly constructed home will receive an extra $14,000 to take their grant to $21,000.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government initiative is designed to stimulate housing activity and give first home buyers a better chance in the housing market.</p>
