E. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 3 APRIL 1984<br />
PM: Well ladies and gentlemen, thank you. I wanted to meet<br />
with you particularly in respect of the decision that I made<br />
that Stewart West should return to the Cabinet which decision<br />
was unanimously endorsed by the Caucus this morning. If I*<br />
can just briefly recapitulate and recall that last year, 3 November,<br />
Stewart expressed the view that he could not accept the decisio-n<br />
in respect of uranium taken by the Cabinet. He was quite<br />
straightforward about that and accepted that on the basis of<br />
Cabinet solidarity that would mean that he would have to leave<br />
the Cabinet. With regret I accepted that position. I have beE~ n<br />
of the view that Stewart should return to the Cabinet. I<br />
discussed the matter with him and he indicated to me now that<br />
unequivocally he accepts the principle of Cabinet solidarity.<br />
on that basis I believe that the Cabinet should re-acquire his<br />
services in the Cabinet and I repeat I put that to the Cabinet<br />
yesterday and the Cabinet unanimously agreed as did the Caucus<br />
this morning.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, will this Cabinet solidarity extend to<br />
the National Conference of the Party? Will you expect that Mr.<br />
West should abide by the Cabinet decisions on uranium at the<br />
Conference? PM: I don't know whether Mr. West is going to be at the Conference.<br />
In that sense it is quite hypothetical. But I understand that<br />
Stewart has accepted the decision of the Sovernment that has been<br />
made. JOURNALIST: If you are at the Conference Mr. West will you abide<br />
by the principle of Government solidarity?<br />
WEST: Well the principle of Government solidarity I have<br />
accepted. I always did accept that in the community and the<br />
principle of Cabinet solidarity between the Cabinet and the<br />
Caucus is of course accepted. It is not known whether I will be a<br />
delegate or not at the Conference. I may be part of any on-going<br />
discussions on this or any other matter. I accept the<br />
principle of Cabinet solidarity and Mr. Hawke has re-iterated that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. West, why do you accept the principle now when<br />
you apparently didn't accept the principle back in November? </p>
<p>2.<br />
WEST: Well the uranium question was a very difficult question<br />
for me personally, as is well known. The decision on uranium<br />
as far as the Cabinet and the Caucus and the Government is<br />
concerned has been made and of course all Ministers of this<br />
Government are expected, and I accept that, in the public arena<br />
to abide by the decisions of the Government as they are made<br />
within the proper democratic processes decision making processesas<br />
outlined in our Cabinet memoranda.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does this mean you have said that you were wrong<br />
last year?<br />
WEST: Well, I was wrong within the concept that Cabinet solidarity<br />
ought to be maintained. Obviously I accepted at the time th~ at if<br />
I didn't abide by Cabinet solidarity that I would have to be stood<br />
down from the Cabinet and that is precisely what occurred and<br />
knew that that would occur when I took the decision that I did..<br />
I believe, as I have said, that the decisions that are properly arrive(;<br />
at within the Cabinet/ Caucus decision making process under a system<br />
which the Caucus and the Cabinet and the Ministry have endorsed<br />
ought to be complied with and of course I have always done that.<br />
The point was at the time that I didn't abide by Cabinet<br />
solidarity on the uranium issue within the Parliamentary Party<br />
and once that decision was taken there was never any question -that<br />
any Minister including myself would support it publicly in the open<br />
arena. JOURNALIST: Mr. West, is it fair to say that this indicates t*-iat<br />
the uranium question is largely a fait accompli that is at the<br />
conference in July that the Government's ( decision will be passed<br />
by the conference?<br />
WEST: I am not saying that it is my duty to pre-empt what the<br />
conference might do. My own view is that there be a continuing<br />
rational discussion on the issue within the Party as there ought<br />
to be within the confines of the Party leading up to the<br />
Federal Conference.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does your return to Cabinet, Mr. West, signal<br />
a change in attitude on uranium by you?<br />
WEST: It doesn't signal any change in my beliefs. It certairly<br />
signals that I accept that I or any significant section of thE<br />
Party wishes to be part of the Government, part of the Cabinet.,<br />
that we accept solidarity in the context that that is the<br />
decision of the Cabinet, the Minister and. the Caucus and that I<br />
act within those guidelines.<br />
JO0URNALIST: Can I clarify the point with either of you about<br />
the rules for Conference. Cabinet solidarity does not apply,<br />
surely in any vote at National Conference! an internal decision<br />
making organ of the Party, does it?<br />
WEST: The Cabinet solidarity to which we are referring is the<br />
s olidarity in the Federal Parliamentary L1abor Party that also<br />
applies in the open public arena. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: What about Conference?<br />
WEST: Well that's a hypothetical question. I don't know whethE~ r<br />
I will be a delegate and I certainly would expect, as I have<br />
said, that a rational discussion on any issue would occur with in<br />
the Party, but I accept that it is not my role as a Government<br />
Cabinet Minister to be putting any position. in the public arena<br />
that is contrary to Government policy.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, could you clarify the rules on this<br />
matter? PM: Could I clarify what?<br />
JOURNALIST: The rules on whether Ministers are bound at<br />
Conference to support the Cabinet decision.<br />
PM: Once the question of a decision. is for the supreme policy<br />
making body of the Party, I would imagine that people there as<br />
delegates could have the opportunity of expressing their views,<br />
but how Ministers will operate on this matter I think will be a<br />
matter for particular discussion within thE! Ministry. In other<br />
words we will have a discussion about this before the Conference<br />
and I am not going to by answer here pre-empt the view that we may<br />
adopt on that issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you think that Cabinet was<br />
weakened over the last five months by not having a representative<br />
of the left wing faction?<br />
PM: Yes, I think it would have been better-for the operation of<br />
the Party if Stewart could have been there and Stewart would quite<br />
readily concede at the time of the discussion that we had which<br />
was a totally amicable one I just put that point of view quite<br />
specifically to him and he understood it, but he felt strongly<br />
at the time and I accepted it. The answer to your question is<br />
yes, I think it would have been bett~ er and I am glad for three<br />
reasons, if I may say personally to have Stewart back. Secondly,<br />
in regard to the factional consideration that you allude to,<br />
Laurie. Thirdly, let me say this, I think the portfolio is a<br />
very important one and I have had some points of view put to me<br />
from within the migrant community that they regretted the fact that<br />
their portfolio having been in the Cabinet was no longer there.<br />
And I'm glad for that reason as well. So, for the three reasons<br />
I am pleased that Stewart is back in the Cabinet.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, you said it was your own decision to have<br />
Mr. West back. Was that a spontaneous thing that occurred to<br />
you, or did people have a yarn to you from within the Caucus<br />
beforehand? PM: There had been some discussion with me going over a period<br />
o; f time. I just don't know how far back, but quite some time<br />
back, but I wasn't under any pressure at all on this dand I was<br />
thinking about it the other day and I thought the time had come<br />
so I had some discussion directly with Stewie and we I don't<br />
know what you are laughing about, I just thought it would be a<br />
bit much of a shock to his system if I announced it without telling<br />
him. I wanted to check that he wanted to come back, you see. 14 </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr. West, has the administration of Immigration and<br />
Ethnic Affairs suffered while you were outside the Cabinet?<br />
WEST: No, no of course not. I think that on the contrary<br />
that it won't suffer now, but it certainly being in Cabinet<br />
imposes some extra strain and responSibility, obviously. But I<br />
think if I might be allowed to say this that it is generally<br />
conceded by particularly the ethnic communities that we have done<br />
very well across the whole area of ethnic affairs legislation and<br />
implementation of programs and the way we have handled the<br />
immigration program generally and I think we have done very well<br />
and I am quite certain that all of the migrant leaders and<br />
ethnic communities across Australia will welcome the Prime<br />
Minister's decision and I am very proud of it actually becaLse I<br />
do see the need for those people to be represented in Cabinet<br />
and I see the need, as I said at question time, for the widest<br />
possible representation of all heard in the Party to be represented<br />
in Cabinet and quite frankly if I can conclude on this note, tbhe<br />
uranium question was always a vexacious problem in that regard<br />
because I always saw the need to be interested and putting<br />
representations on all of the broad range of questions that this<br />
Government is concerned about and obviously if myself and a whole<br />
range of views in the Party want to be represented in Cabinet<br />
to put views upon economic matters, on industry matters, on<br />
taxation reform matters, well then obviously I have to accept the<br />
fact that Cabinet solidarity if you want to be involved in that<br />
decision making process, then I accept that absolutely.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. H-awke, if at National Conference Ministers are<br />
tied to the principle of Cabinet solidarity, don't you think that<br />
that would inhibit proper discussion about proposed changes to<br />
the platform, seeing that is the purpose of conference?<br />
PM: I have already answered that question, Paul, and it was a<br />
very clear answer I gave -that I can see the issues arise<br />
that you claim in your question and we will. have a discussion in<br />
the Ministry before the Conference as to what is appropriate<br />
course of action.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, on the issue of uranium generally.<br />
Do you as Mr. Dawkins I want to get his words right suggested<br />
last week that the mood or the within the Party is one more<br />
of open of mining rather -than of winding down the industry?<br />
PM: I don't want to go too far in pre-empting the discussions<br />
w_ 7hich will go on before the conference and at the conference,<br />
but I think it is fair to say that there is a discernable change<br />
in the context of the debate and I would say no more than this<br />
that I think and what I have seen, what has been said to me from<br />
a number of quarters that the position that the Government<br />
has decided upon here at the end of last year that that position<br />
will be contained within any decision that is made at the<br />
conference. I don't see, in other words, the uranium debate<br />
being the devisive issue that it has been in the past. By that<br />
I'm not saying that there won't be debate and strongly put points<br />
of view. I think, however, that one of the big achievements of<br />
the approach that we adopted last year here in the<br />
Parliamentary section of the Party was the move to a much more </p>
<p>rational basis of discussion about this issue. I think that<br />
will be reflected at the conference.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. West have you seen Senator Walsh's draft<br />
policy on uranium and if so do you agree with it?<br />
WEST: I said, and I agree with the Prime Minister, that I<br />
anticipate that there will be a rational discussion on that<br />
issue and on other issues in the lead up to the national<br />
conference within the proper confines of the Party apparatus<br />
and decision making structure and that has got to occur and<br />
quite frankly that is what I expect that there will be a<br />
rational discussion on a contentious issue and I believe and<br />
accept what was said by the Prime Minister, that it is not<br />
in anyone's interest to make a Roman holiday of obvious<br />
disagreement reaching across Australia on contentious issue<br />
at the national conference. Clearly there will be divisions<br />
of opinions, but we have the committee structure and we have<br />
the proper decision making structure in place where a rational<br />
discussion can occur and the delegates at the conference can<br />
take a decision on that issue and indeed on any other issue<br />
within the confines of the national conference structure.<br />
PM: One thing we can be certain of we will have a much more<br />
rational discussion about uranium policy than the Opposition<br />
has about wages policy.<br />
WEST: That is right.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. West , have you discussed your return to<br />
the Cabinet with the members of your left faction and if you<br />
have, have you made it quite clear to them that if in future<br />
there is a conflict between principle of Cabinet solidarity<br />
and your own commitment to the anti uranium cause then the<br />
form of principle will prevail?<br />
WEST: Yes, let me be quite unequivocal. I am absolutely<br />
certain that all of my colleagues, including those in the<br />
area that you refer to, are completely supportive of my decision<br />
to accept the invitation of Cabinet, Caucus and the Prime<br />
Minister to return to the Cabinet. They take the same view as<br />
I do, that it is not acceptable for the portfolio that I hold<br />
and further that the people whose views I right share in the<br />
Party should be not represented in a Cabinet of 14 or 15 in the<br />
Labor Government of Australia and that there are other issues<br />
to consider besides uranium on which they want their voice to bE!<br />
heard. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, on the Ministry generally. What is<br />
your view about a Minister who has a Government flat in<br />
Canberra and also is entitled to a travelling allowance of<br />
$ 86 a day while living in Canberra?<br />
PM: Well, let me say two or three things about that. I don't<br />
k-now why we should be as elliptical as we are. Usually people<br />
are more direct than that. We are talking about Mr. Uren. He<br />
is entitled as a Minister to Government hcusing. The fact he<br />
has it is in accordance with a policy which was established in<br />
1956 and has been supported and followed by successive governmerits<br />
/ 6 </p>
<p>since 1956. 1 am informed that since 1956 25 Ministers have<br />
had tenancies in their names. Now, the fact is that in<br />
respect to this particular portfolio he is required Mr. Uren<br />
is required to spend a very considerable amount of his time<br />
in the ACT and that of course is even when the Parliament is<br />
not sitting. I understand that he pays standard rent for h~ s<br />
dwelling. It is $ 113 a fortnight and. the faLct is, according<br />
to my understanding, that Mr. Uren acquired and retains his<br />
accommodation strictly in accordance with the long established<br />
rules in relation to housing in the ACT for Ministers. Now,<br />
let me say on this that in relation to travelling allowance,<br />
Ministers who maintain a residence in Canberra, including Mr.<br />
Uren, claim the travelling allowance when away from their<br />
principle place of residence in another State and they do it<br />
when on official business and they do it for a maximum of fdur<br />
days a week and I don't think I need to remind you that that<br />
represents a very considerable improvement over the situation<br />
under the previous government when, for instance the Member for<br />
Corangamite could claim travelling allowance for 327 days in a<br />
year and the former Leader of the National Party continued to<br />
claim travelling allowance while living in a Government home<br />
financed by a low interest loan. So, the attitude of Mr. Uren<br />
and his actions, I repeat, is consistent with policy followed<br />
since 1956 and 25 Ministers have had a tenancy in their name<br />
and in fact the maximum of four days a week which has been<br />
followed by Ministers in my Government is significantly an<br />
improvement on previous practice. The final point I would make<br />
about Mr. Uren is this. If there is one person in the<br />
Parliament who consistently has had a commitment to the concept<br />
of the responsibility of governments to make adequate<br />
provision for public housing it is Mr. Ureri. He doesn't have<br />
to lower his colours to anyone in the Parliament. It is well<br />
known I have had my differences at times with Tom Uren on issues,<br />
but I make it quite clear that more than anyone in the<br />
Parliament, he has played a prominent role in securing a<br />
position of Government commitment to significant increases in<br />
financing public housing. To be precise, this Government in it, 3<br />
first year of office made a decision to increase the funds for<br />
public housing by 50% and that was the largest increase in public<br />
housing ever made by any Government and in our preparation for<br />
Government, Mr. Uren played a very significant role in the<br />
development of that policy.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, you mentioned the Opposition wages policy.<br />
It is an area where you have had a bit of experience. Can<br />
you give us your opinion of the new wages policy?<br />
PM: Can I first of all give you some observations on how they<br />
get there. I mean, I think this is as interesting as the policy<br />
itself is the way they got there. Now, we have had well over a<br />
year now in which they have been flagellating around trying to<br />
find something which they can call a policy and we read in the<br />
press you people assiduously discovered that they had a meeting<br />
and it was six all and the whole question of the policy of the<br />
opposition in regard to wages depended on Mr. Ralph Hunt. Now, we<br />
/ 7 </p>
<p>0 7.<br />
all have an affection for Mr. Hfunt, including myself. I have<br />
a great affection, but I don't think any of us would feel<br />
that Mr. Hunt's depth and depth of knowledge of economics<br />
and industrial relations was a proper repository finally<br />
for determining the Opposition policy. So, there they weremeeting<br />
was it yesterday or the day before. And they<br />
couldn't get anywhere and Andrew went rushing in and said I've<br />
got to have a policy by one o'clock, otherwise I'm a pumpkin.<br />
And so they said, alright, we'll find a pol~ icy by one o'clock.<br />
And so Mr. Howard stopped saying to Mr. Macphee that is stupid.<br />
And Mr. Macphee stopped saying to Mr. Howard that is stupid.<br />
And they seemed to-find the parts out of each of their<br />
propositions which they thought was the least stupid, wrapp,@ d<br />
them up together and said that is a policy. Now, I simply want<br />
to say in terms of analysing their policy, that is a hell of a<br />
way of getting there. And indeed I was surprised before that<br />
I could, as Prime Minister, be in a more satisfied position about<br />
the Opposition and wages policy than I was when they didn't have<br />
one. But I must say that now I'm even more satisfied that they<br />
have got one because the policy " up with which they've come"<br />
is amazing. I mean the business community are laughing at it.<br />
The trade union movement are laughing at it. Every commentator<br />
is laughing at it because it means all things to all men which<br />
in the end means it can't work. It won't work. It is a<br />
prescription for chaos and I'll have great pleasure at the<br />
appropriate moment let me say this the only hope that they<br />
have is that they don't change it. Now that they've gone through<br />
this traumatic process which I have described in complete accuracy<br />
and no embellishment, I only plead with them now that they've gone<br />
through that, that they don't change it that they adhere to it<br />
because between now and the election, whenever that will be, I<br />
will have great pleasure in analysing it's inadequacies in<br />
considerable detail.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, could I invite you to repeat the<br />
comments that you made to the Caucus meeting about the ABC this<br />
morning. PM: Yes you can.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, could you expand on the remarks that you<br />
made? PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why not?<br />
PM: Because you know that Caucus is a sacred place. That what:<br />
happens in the Caucus is like a confessional box, almost. I<br />
have never been in a confessional box and I don't think the<br />
chances are great that I ever will, but we regard it as a sacre~ d<br />
place and I don't think, despite the tendency of my colleagues<br />
apparently to break the rules of the confE! ssional, it is not<br />
something that I intend to do. / 8 </p>
<p>' p JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what are your views which you<br />
talked about the strategic bases document and do you think<br />
the on-going debate about it has weakened Mr. Scholes position"<br />
PM: No, let me make the position quite clear about the<br />
9-rategic bases. The thing of co ncern there is the leaking . of<br />
the document. The actual documLent itself the accuracy of<br />
which of course I neither confirm or deny as you have heard me<br />
say but what is in the purported document is not a matter of<br />
very considerable concern. As I have said, the document that<br />
was considered by the Cabinet represents a putting forward of<br />
points of view analysis by various bureaucrats. It doesn't<br />
represent the adoption of any policy prescriptions by the<br />
Government. So the actual policy position of the Government is<br />
not affected by the disclosure. I have made my point about %. he<br />
inadequacy and certainly the total bias of the way in which<br />
the release was made and people can clearly make up their own<br />
mind about that the mischievous nature of it, but coming to<br />
the latter part of the question about Mr. Scholes, no, I<br />
don't think Mr. Scholes' position has been weakened.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, are you satisfied in your mind that the<br />
problem of the disposal of nuclear waste has been solved or<br />
do you think it really matters?<br />
PM: Well, they are not alternative questi~ ons as you put them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well answer the first one.<br />
PM: Please?<br />
JOURNALIST: Please.<br />
PM: I don't think anyone would say, including Senator Walsh,<br />
That you can say in respect of the next question of the<br />
disposal of nuclear waste that is completely solved. I think<br />
rather what I would say that there seem to have been important<br />
advances made which offer hope that we may be able to deal with<br />
the question, but I certainly wouldn't say unequivocally that<br />
we can assert that the problems of waste disposal have been<br />
irrovacably solved. But now I will direct myself to the other<br />
question which wasn't an alternative although you put it as such.<br />
Of course the question of the disposal of nuclear waste matters.<br />
There is no-one I think in any point of the debate on the<br />
question of uranium who would say that it doesn't matter. Of<br />
course it matters. </p>
