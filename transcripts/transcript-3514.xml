QUEENSLAND HOSPITAL GRANTS<br />
Following a question to Dr Everingham in the<br />
House of Representatives today, the Prime Minister has<br />
released details of new Australian Government grants<br />
to ease Queensland's hospital problems.<br />
Mr Whitlam said he had written to Mr Bjelke-<br />
Petersen on 30 November giving details of decisions<br />
arising out of the most recent meeting of the Joint<br />
Hospitals Works Council for Queensland.<br />
The Queensland Minister for Health has been<br />
advised that an initial. Australian Government Grant<br />
of $ 5.151 million has been made available for the<br />
approved hospital program in Queensland for 1974/ 75.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that of this sum, $ 2.678 million<br />
was for hospital projects already being planned or<br />
constructed. Among projects that could be assisted are<br />
Stage II of the Cairns Hospital, construction of a<br />
medical and services block at Rockhampton, extensions<br />
to Mt Isa Hospital and new obstetric facilities at<br />
Mt Gravatt as the first stage of a new teaching hospital.<br />
A grant of $ 200,000 towards construction of a new<br />
dental hospital in South Brisbane has been included for<br />
this financial year. This does not include $ 14,000<br />
for Sandgate Medical and Dental Clinic which is not in<br />
the hospital grounds.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that $ 1.023 million would be<br />
provided towards psychiatric services. A main feature<br />
would be accommodation for intellectually handicapped<br />
persons at the Rockhampton-and Baillie Henderson ( Toowoomba)<br />
Hospitals and Basil Stafford Training Centre at Brisbane.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that many Queensland hospitals<br />
were in need of substantial upgrading and re-equipping, and<br />
$ 520,000 had been allocated for major equi pment purposes and<br />
$ 400,000 would go towards ward refurbishing.<br />
General hospital projects under construction such<br />
as a new ward block at Southport Hospital and new outpatient<br />
facilities at Chermside will benefit from the remaining funds. </p>
