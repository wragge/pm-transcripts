COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. W. McMAHON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
FUTURE OF AUSTRALIAN FORCES IN VIETNAM,<br />
AND NATIONAL SERVICE<br />
( Ministerial Statement)<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 18 August 1971]<br />
Mr McMA4HON ( Lowe-Prime Minister)-<br />
by leave-Sir, I announce tonight<br />
that the combat role which Australia took<br />
up over 6 years ago in Vietnam is soon to<br />
be completed. In 1965, when Australia first<br />
sent troops to that country, the continued<br />
survival of the Republic was in dire jeopardy.<br />
The scale and weight of enemy<br />
attacks were increasing, and North Vietnam's<br />
intervention was becoming ever<br />
more brazen. It seemed only a matter of<br />
time before Hanoi and the Vietcong, which<br />
supported Hanoi's cause, would take over<br />
the country by main force in defiance of<br />
the 1954 Geneva Agreements.<br />
Beyond the immediate threats within<br />
and against Vietnam there was a militant<br />
China-a China which was giving direct<br />
moral and material aid to North Vietnamn<br />
and which had in the recent past occupied<br />
Tibet and fought with India, a China<br />
whose ambitions and policies in the area<br />
were causing great concern. Nor was that<br />
all. The independence of Laos and Cambodia<br />
were in precarious balance. Insurgent<br />
activity in border areas of Thailand had<br />
already begun. Sukarnoist Indonesia was<br />
committing violence against its near neighbours,<br />
with the then powerful Indonesian<br />
Communist Party exercising major<br />
influence over Indonesian policies.<br />
14322/ 71 This, then, was the situation in 1965.<br />
This was the background against which the<br />
Australian Government decided to commit<br />
Australian forces to the aid of South Vietnam.<br />
That decision was made in the<br />
national interest pursuant to our obigations<br />
under the Manila Treaty and at the<br />
invitation of the Republic of Vietnam. Its<br />
purpose was to help, jointly with the<br />
United States and others, to sustain and<br />
develop the confidence of the Government<br />
and the people of the Republic; to help<br />
defend it; to develop its capacities to deal<br />
with both overt aggression and externally<br />
promoted insurgency; and to enable it to<br />
make its own decisions about its future in<br />
a context of greater security. That purpose<br />
has now been substantially achieved.<br />
Today the picture is different-in East<br />
Asia, in South East Asia, and not'least in<br />
Indo-China itself. The aggression by North<br />
Vietnam has been slowed and its plans for<br />
over-running the South frustrated. Security<br />
throughout the country has improved<br />
remarkably. Successive pacification programmes<br />
have extended the physical control<br />
of the Vietnamese Government over<br />
the countryside. Political, economic and<br />
social advances have been made notwithstanding<br />
that the war has absorbed so<br />
much of the people's time and energies. </p>
<p>Above all, the armed forces of the Republic,<br />
with considerable help from the allies,<br />
have grown in size and developed their<br />
skills, cohesion and effectiveness. This has<br />
enabled them progressively to take over<br />
responsibilities from allied forces and at<br />
the same time to conduct operations<br />
against North Vietnamese forces in Cambodia<br />
and to disrupt their supply ines<br />
in southern Laos.<br />
To this changed and improved situation<br />
Australia has made a significant contribution.<br />
Australian forces of all arms have<br />
played an honourable and effective part in<br />
their areas of operation. They have been<br />
worthy of this country. They have been<br />
honoured by our Alles. The main Australian<br />
effort has been in the general area<br />
surrounding Saigon and in particular in<br />
Phuoc Tuy Province. There, the security<br />
situation has markedly improved. The<br />
enemy has largely lost the initiative. The<br />
Vietnamese territorial forces have been<br />
steadily developing their capacity. And in<br />
the last year have gradually expanded their<br />
own areas of operations. The enemy is still<br />
there of course, and some setbacks may<br />
yet occur. But it is our view, shared by the<br />
Government of the Republic, that the<br />
existing relative strengths are such that the<br />
territorial forces should be able to handle<br />
the likely contingencies.<br />
In these changing and improving circumstances,<br />
the Australian Government<br />
has been giving close consideration to the<br />
future of the Australian forces in Vietnam.<br />
It has for some time been our policy to<br />
withdraw our forces progressively as and<br />
when in our judgment, and after consuftation<br />
with the Republic of Vietnam and the<br />
United States, the situation has allowed it.<br />
In coming to this judgment we have on<br />
each occasion considered several factors,<br />
including whether the forces and administration<br />
of the Republic have been ready<br />
and able to assume increased responsibility<br />
for local security.<br />
We now judge that the circumstances<br />
are such that further effect can be given to<br />
our withdrawal. policy. I have recently<br />
been in correspondence on this subject<br />
with the President of the Republic of Vietnam,<br />
and also with President Nixon and<br />
Sir Keith Holyoake. I am now able to<br />
announce that the Government has decided<br />
to withdraw all remaining Australian combat<br />
forces from Vietnam. The forces will begin withdrawing in the next few months,<br />
giving the Vietnamese time to adjust their<br />
force dispositions. HMAS ' Brisbane', due<br />
out of service in Vietnamese waters early<br />
in September, will not be replaced. Most<br />
of the combat elements will be home in<br />
Australia by Christmas 1971. Shipment to<br />
Australia of stores and equipment will be<br />
completed in the early months of 1972.<br />
The Government has already pledged<br />
that, as the withdrawal of our forces proceeds,<br />
we will provide other appropriate.<br />
forms of military assistance as well as economic<br />
aid. We have accordingly approved<br />
an aid package for the Republic of Vietnam<br />
totalling $ 25m, to be spent over the<br />
next 3 years. The package will include civil<br />
projects of an economic development character<br />
as well as defence aid in the form of<br />
military training and equipment. Seven<br />
million dollars have been set aside for this<br />
assistance in the current financial year.<br />
This figure will be progressively increased<br />
during the two succeeding years.<br />
We are also discussing with the Vietnamese<br />
Government plans to retain in the<br />
Republic some military training and advisory<br />
elements, for example instructors at<br />
the jungle warfare training centre in Nui<br />
Dat, if they are wanted and if satisfactory<br />
arrangements can be made. We hope that<br />
-these elements will continue to work in<br />
close association with the United States<br />
effort in this field.<br />
Finally, I express the Government's conviction<br />
that -the decision I have announced<br />
tonight is a mark of the success which has<br />
attended our policies and actions in Vietnam<br />
over the years. This does not mean<br />
that security in the area is yet fully<br />
achieved. The Government of South Vietnam<br />
will continue to face serious problems,<br />
aggravated by the continuing and<br />
flagrant North Vietnamese aggression in<br />
Cambodia and interference in Laos. South<br />
Vietnam is confident that it can overcome<br />
these problems if it continues to receive<br />
appropriate assistance. The Australian<br />
Government shares that confidence. It is<br />
the Government's earnest hope that the<br />
war can be brought to an early end by<br />
serious negotiations, -that peace and stability<br />
will soon prevail throughout the area,<br />
and that the countries of Indo-China-not<br />
excluding North Vietnam-will be able to<br />
devote their energies with the help of<br />
others to worthwhile productive efforts. </p>
<p>I now turn to national service. The present<br />
form of national service was introduced<br />
towards the end of 1964. Against<br />
the background of the situation at that<br />
time, which I have described, the Government<br />
decided that the strength of the<br />
Army needed to be increased from its then<br />
low level of some 23,000. It was apparent,<br />
notwithstanding pay rises some months<br />
earlier, that this could not be achieved in<br />
time by voluntary means alone. Accordingly,<br />
in November 1964, the then Prime<br />
Minister announced the introduction of the<br />
present national service scheme. Further<br />
developments in the situation led to the<br />
commitment in 1965 of major Australian<br />
Army units to Vietnam. In 1966 national<br />
servicemen were sent there. We now have<br />
a different situation.<br />
There is improved political stability in<br />
South East Asia. We have decided to withdraw<br />
our forces from Vietnam. These factors<br />
have implications for the composition<br />
of our defence forces. The major portion<br />
of our defence manpower is obtained by<br />
volunteer recruitment. The Navy and the<br />
Air Force are both entirely volunteer<br />
forces. On the other hand for the full time<br />
Army, where the numbers are larger, more<br />
than one-third of the strength has had to<br />
be obtained in recent times by other than<br />
voluntary means to ensure an Army of the<br />
size we need. The extent of our defence<br />
manpower is measured not simply by the<br />
size of our Regular forces, but by the<br />
totality of the Regular, Citizen and<br />
Reserve forces. Fully trained former<br />
national servicemen in the Reserve are of<br />
particular significance. Reviewing the situation<br />
the Government has concluded that<br />
there can be some reduction in the number<br />
of men serving full time in the Army. The<br />
Government accordingly proposes to<br />
reduce the full time strength of the Army<br />
by some 4,000 in the immediate future. It<br />
has decided to do this by reducing the<br />
period of full time national service from 2<br />
years to 18 months.<br />
The present total liability of 5 years' service<br />
for national servicemen will remain<br />
unchanged. But henceforth more of this<br />
service will be rendered in the Reserve-<br />
31 years instead of 3 years as at present.<br />
National servicemen will be required to<br />
serve only 18 months full time. There will<br />
be complementary reductions in the period of part time service in the Citizen Forces<br />
which is at present available as an alternative<br />
to full time national service. These<br />
men will now normally serve a period of<br />
years in the Citizen Forces. The number of<br />
men to be called up each year under the<br />
national service scheme, about 8,000, will<br />
be unchanged. At present, with 2 years'<br />
full time service, this means a total of<br />
some 16,000 full time national servicemen<br />
in the Army at any one time. With only 18<br />
months' full time service, the number of<br />
full time national servicemen serving in the<br />
Army at any one time will fall to a-bout<br />
12,000. Correspondingly the total strength<br />
of the full time Army will fall by<br />
4,000-from about 44,000 to 40,000. This<br />
reduction in strength will1 not affect the<br />
present organisation of the Army into 9<br />
battalions. Some will be on a reduced<br />
-basis. The Government has given careful consideration<br />
to the effect of these changes on<br />
personnel already serving. We wish to<br />
ensure that the transition will -be orderly<br />
and that as far as possible inequities are<br />
avoided. It has been decided that serving<br />
national servicemen who have completed<br />
18 months service will be discharged<br />
broadly in accordance with their length of<br />
service. This will be done over a period of<br />
some 3 months commencing late in<br />
October or early in November. Legislation<br />
giving effect to the Government's decisions<br />
will be introduced as quickly as possible. I<br />
am sure the Parliament will wish to give<br />
priority to it. In deciding on this reduction<br />
in national service, careful account has<br />
been taken of the strategic situation confronting<br />
us. While as I have said there<br />
have been improvements in many aspects<br />
of the situation in South East Asia, there<br />
are many continuing elements of insecurity<br />
and some new ones. At the same time, we<br />
see changes in the defence posture of our<br />
close allies, particularly the United States.<br />
These do not affect the fundamental character<br />
of our alliances. We must maintain -a<br />
defence capability that is evident * both to<br />
friendly countries and to potential enemies,<br />
and which we could develop in adequate<br />
time should more immediate threats arise.<br />
National servicemen will still constitute a<br />
substantial proportion of our Army-some<br />
12,000 in a total full time Army strength<br />
of about 40,000. </p>
<p>The Government will review force levels<br />
as necessary as part of the 5-year defence<br />
rolling programme. It is important against<br />
the strategic outlook for the 1970s and the<br />
1980s to have the right balance of equipment<br />
and men in the defence forces as a<br />
whole. Close attention will continue to be<br />
given to all practicable means of increasing<br />
voluntary recruitment. Before the introduction<br />
of national service in 1964 there were<br />
improvements in pay but their effect on<br />
recruitment was only marginal. Since then<br />
there have been substantial improvements<br />
not only in pay but in other conditions of<br />
service, for example, the provision of many more married quarters and much<br />
improved barrack accommodation. The<br />
Government's establishment of the Kerr<br />
Committee, and the decisions it has<br />
already taken on the findings of that Committee,<br />
are further important steps. The<br />
Government will continue to ensure that<br />
conditions of service in our armed forces<br />
are as attractive as they can reasonably be<br />
with the aim of ensuring that the proportion<br />
of volunteers will be as large as practicable.<br />
