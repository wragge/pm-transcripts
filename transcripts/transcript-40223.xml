    <content><![CDATA[<p>A wave of superfast broadband connections is about to hit the Woy Woy Peninsula as nbn makes services available to more than 30,000 local homes and businesses.</p>
<p>Robertson MP Lucy Wicks was joined by the Prime Minister, the Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP, at Ettalong Beach today to encourage locals to take full advantage of the door opening to Australia’s new digital era.</p>
<p>“This is one of the first sites in NSW to be switched on to vectored VDSL, and residents should jump on board,” Mrs Wicks said. </p>
<p>“Access to superfast broadband at affordable prices can be revolutionary for small businesses, households with students and people working from home”.</p>
<p>The nbn’s new generation broadband promises to be fast and reliable, enabling households and smalls businesses to be more productive and better connected for years to come. </p>
<p>nbn’s FTTN services will deliver maximum wholesale speeds to retail services providers of up to 100Mbps (download) and up to 40Mbps (upload).</p>
<p>The rollout on the Central Coast is gathering pace thanks to nbn’s simplified network construction.  The Coalition’s multi-technology mix largely removes the need for in-home rewiring or civil works on private property. </p>
<p>The only additional equipment required is a modem suitable for the super-speed vectored VDSL which internet providers can send to their customers on request for free.</p>
<p>Under the Coalition Government’s broadband policy, nbn has shaved years off construction time while still delivering superfast broadband to more than nine million premises nationwide over the next three years.  </p>
<p>In 2016, nbn is aiming to offer faster broadband to between 60,000 and 100,000 premises each month.</p>
<p>Residents and businesses in more than 20 suburbs can begin ordering superfast internet and phone services through their existing provider or make the switch to a different retailer as the nbn is a wholesale network. </p>
