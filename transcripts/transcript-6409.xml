CHECK AGAINST DELIVE40A. STA,', EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
PRIME -MINISTER<br />
Statement to the Parliament by the Prime Minister: Arms<br />
* 1 Control, Disarmament and Australia -6 June 1984<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
On this day 40 years ago, allied forces landed on the<br />
.4beaches of Normandy to launch the final phase of the<br />
destruction of Nazism. Within a year, those forces, Soviet<br />
forces to the East, and the resistance movements in the<br />
occupied countries had liberated the people of Europe and<br />
brought peace to a devastated continent.<br />
Shortly afterwards, the allies went on to achieve victory in<br />
the Pacific and so brought an end to the carnage of the<br />
Second World War. But that end was only achieved after the<br />
victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had opened humanity's eyes<br />
to the existence of a new and uniquely destructive<br />
instrument of war -the nuclear weapon.<br />
Since the end of the Second World War, we have witnessed<br />
great changes in intednational a fairs t'he -no'stpositivebo<br />
which has been the virtu end of colonialism and the<br />
emergence to independenc Uand nationhood of hundreds of<br />
millions of people, many of them in the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
Certain essentials of the post-war system, however, continue<br />
to form the basis of the present world order. The United<br />
States and the USSR, the two powers which emerged<br />
pre-eminent from the war, have gone on to achieve<br />
unchallenged status as superpowers. Moreover, the system<br />
has managed for four decades to avoid a further outbreak of<br />
global conflict or open warfare between -the major powers.<br />
We can all be thankful that since 1945 nuclear weapons have<br />
not again been fired in war.<br />
But if the peace has been kept between East and West, the<br />
4East-West relationship has been at the best of times uneasy<br />
and difficult, and frequently tense and dangerous.<br />
Stability in Europe has not been matched in many parts of<br />
the developing world, where local wars have caused great<br />
misery to millions of people. Repression and the denial of<br />
human rights persist in many countries. And for forty years<br />
the peoples of the world have lived with the nightmare of<br />
nuclear weapons, whose number and destructive power have<br />
grown enormously.<br />
East-West relations at present are at a very low ebb. Arms<br />
control negotiations between the super powers are in great<br />
difficulty. Their relationship is pcrmeatcd with suspicion.<br />
The rhetoric surrounding it is potentially very dangerous. </p>
<p>At the same time, the international arrms race is proceeding<br />
apace at the staggering cost of some 700 billion dollars<br />
annually or well over a million dollars a minute.<br />
This represents a scandalous waste of resources and human<br />
ingenuity. None of us needs to be told how the world,<br />
particularly the poorer countries, could benefit from a<br />
redirection of this military expenditure into peaceful and<br />
productive development.<br />
Some 80 per cent of the expenditure on arms is * on<br />
conventional weapons. In the thermonuclear age, we can<br />
easily overlook the horrifying destruct-ive power which now<br />
hides behind that anodyne term. The bloodshed in the Gulf<br />
War and the destruction of sophisticated modern warships in<br />
the Falklands war should remind us of its sinister<br />
implications. But above all, it is the rapid technological development and<br />
build-up of nuclear weapons which, combined with the<br />
deterioration in East-West relations, has quite<br />
understandably created the current mood of anxiety and anger<br />
among ordinary men and women around the world as well as<br />
here in Australia.<br />
On Palm Sunday, a few weeks ago, some 250,000 Australians<br />
marched in our cities to support the cause of peace,<br />
disarmament and a'rms control. They marched to express the<br />
increasing concern felt about the threat of nuclear war.<br />
Those who marched kiA# Australia joined the countless others<br />
who have marched recentl in Western Europe and the United<br />
. J States. There is also 46d oubt that, if the Governments in<br />
the USSR and Eastern Europe permitted genuine freedom of<br />
expression, there would be millions on the streets there, as<br />
well. The concern of the marchers for peace, the strength of their<br />
feelings, and the very weight of their numbers must be takeninto<br />
account by all Governments.<br />
I have made it clear that we see a very sharp distinction<br />
between nuclear weapons, which we abhor, and nuclear energy<br />
for' ' peaceful purposes, which we support, and I shall return<br />
to this theme in the course of this stetement.<br />
But we certainly understand and identify with the<br />
aspirations of the Australian people for peace and<br />
disarmament and these aspirations inspire our policies. </p>
<p>Academician Andrei Sakharov, a key figure in the development<br />
of Soviet nuclear weapons, whose present plight was the<br />
subject of an important motion passed unanimously by this<br />
House last week, is an outspoken advocate of the need for<br />
arms control agreement between the superpowers.<br />
Pointing out that thermonuclear war cannot be considered a<br />
continuationg , fpoilt ics by other means, according to the<br />
Clausewitz +_" but rather a means of nuclear suicide,<br />
Dr Sakharov has identified the consequences of nuclear<br />
conflict in stark terms which will move concerned people on<br />
both sides of the ideological divide, as follows:<br />
" 1A complete destruction o f c it iesa, industry,<br />
transport and systems of education, a, poisoning of<br />
fields, water and air by radioactivity, a physical<br />
destruction of the larger part of mankind, poverty,<br />
barbarism, a return to savagery, and a genetic<br />
degeneracy of the survivors under the impact of<br />
radiation, a destruction of the material and<br />
information basis of civilisation".<br />
Although Australia might appear remote from the areas of the<br />
globe where any nuclear war might mainly be fought, it would<br />
be unrealistic to suppose that Australia would not be<br />
profoundly affected by such a conflict.<br />
The Government believes that it is therefore in Australia's<br />
vital interests, as a country which wants both to survive<br />
and to be a constructive member of the international<br />
community, to do allV &amp; e can do to minimise the'-prospects for<br />
nuclear conflict. i<br />
We have a modest and realistic evaluation of our influence<br />
on the super-powers and the other major powers but we will<br />
use it whenever we can. The recent overseas visit by the<br />
Minister for Foreign Affairs, who will speak in this debate,<br />
is an effective example of what we are about.<br />
The nuclear weapons states alone do not have the right to<br />
determine the destiny of mankind. The fact that their<br />
calculations or indeed their miscalculations could have<br />
terrible consequences for the rest of us gives us the<br />
responsibility before our people to be heard on these<br />
fundamental issues.<br />
In approaching this responsibility, the Government<br />
unequivocally rejects the attractive but unrealistic idea<br />
that unilateral disarmament would be an effective, way to<br />
bring about an end to the arms race.<br />
We proceed from the fact that Australia is an aligned nationand<br />
that our security is supported by co-operative measures<br />
under the auspices of ANZUS. The Labor Party takes pride in<br />
the fact that the foundations of our alliance wth the United<br />
States were laid by the great John Curtini, when this country<br />
faced the gravest threat to its survival in 1941. </p>
<p>As an-independent ally of the United States, Aust ajiat<br />
year init iated a thorough and successful review o r AriiUt<br />
We are satisfied that the Treaty continues to support our<br />
fundamental security interests, without absolving Australia<br />
from the primary obligation to provide for our own national<br />
defence. Honourable Members will recall that Secretary of<br />
State Shultz commented that the review had been an excellent<br />
idea and most worthwhile.<br />
Our membership of the alliance in no way inhibits us from<br />
pursuing the issues of arms control and disarmament. On the<br />
contrary, as-my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs,<br />
said on 18 January 1984:<br />
" We work unabashedly through international fora for<br />
arms control and disarmament, n u cle ar and<br />
conventional. Our involvement with the United<br />
States gives u s much greater claim to be heard on<br />
these matters internationally.<br />
There is much greater weight behind o u r<br />
declarations on this subject precisely because we<br />
are sensible enough to support the only effective<br />
nuclear restraint system at the moment, deterrence,<br />
but intelligent enough to worry about the<br />
escalation, the excessive armouries, to want<br />
something better and to work for it openly and<br />
energetically."<br />
We intend to continue to pursue these issues vigorously with.<br />
both super powers. ,4f allies of the U. itdSaesd o<br />
to press their concerns ab t arms control on the USSR, the<br />
Soviet Leaders may be t pted to sit back and permit<br />
one-sided pressure to build up in Washington. Mr Hayden's<br />
vigorous advocacy of these issues in Moscow and the response<br />
he was given by Mr Gromyko demonstrate that our alliance<br />
with the United States is no barrier to Australia's voice<br />
being heard in the Soviet Union.<br />
r and senior Ministers of the Government have held<br />
discussions on these matters with President Reagan and other<br />
leading members of the Administration. We will take these<br />
discussions further with Secretary of State Shultz when he<br />
visits Canberra next month.<br />
Arms control was a major item on the agenda ofmy<br />
discussions with Premier Zhao in Peking in February. I have<br />
raised the matter with President Mitterrand and Mr Hayden<br />
has done the same in his recent talks with French Foreign<br />
Minister Cheysson. </p>
<p>Since coming to power, this Government has given a priority<br />
to arms control and disarmament issues unmatched by any of'<br />
its predecessors. We have done this, a8 I have indicated,<br />
because of our concern at the level of international tension<br />
in recent years, our appreciation of the difficulties<br />
bedevilling relations between the superpowers and our<br />
recognition of the very legitimate anxieties which these<br />
developments have aroused among the Australian people.<br />
The Government believes that we should not allow ourselves<br />
to be overwhelmed by a sense of global pessimism or imminent<br />
disaster. We are aware that the issues posed by the politics and<br />
technology of arms control and disarmament are,<br />
extraordinarily complex. There are no ' quick fixes'<br />
available. Arms control and disarmament cannot be imposed<br />
on any nation, let alone the nuclear powers. Progress can<br />
only be achieved through agreement between the countries<br />
concerned. The Government believes that what is required are realistic,<br />
concrete and balanced measures that have at their heart a<br />
recognition of the national security interests involved.<br />
We are guided by three basic principles:<br />
security for all states at thE! lowest possible<br />
level of armament<br />
-stability ,~ the nuclear* balance; an~<br />
adequate verifdlation arrangements.<br />
As a member of every global disarmament body, Australia is<br />
promoting treaties to end nuclear testing and to ban<br />
chemical weapons, and measures to prevent an arms race in<br />
outer space. We are also doing what we can do to strengthen<br />
measures against-the spread of nuclear weapons.<br />
For countries such as Australia, there is no substitute for<br />
the hard slog of multilateral diplomacy designed to engage<br />
the interests and support of the superpowers. The<br />
appointment of Australia's first Ambassador for Disarmament<br />
has significantly improved the effectiveness of our efforts<br />
in this regard.<br />
The Government's policy framework was laid down on 22<br />
November 1983 when Cabinet took the following policy<br />
decisions on arms control and disarmament:<br />
to promote measures to halt and reverse the nuclear<br />
arms race; </p>
<p>( ii) to uphold the international nuclear<br />
non-proliferation treaty;<br />
( iii) to promote a comprehensive and verifiable ban on<br />
nuclear testing;<br />
( iv) to develop the concept of a nuclear free zone in<br />
the South Pacific;<br />
to support the achievement of an agreement to ban<br />
chemical weapons;<br />
( vi) to support the process of negotiation and the<br />
achievement of balanced and verifiable arms control<br />
agreements;<br />
( vii) to take an active role in pursuing arms control and<br />
disarmament measures wherever possible;<br />
( viii) to affirm Austrnilia's readiness to join a consensus<br />
to hold an inte,.-national conference on the Indian<br />
ocean zone of pr.-ace question.<br />
Since coming to office t'r~ e Government has taken steps to<br />
strengthen Australia's public and private institutional<br />
capacity, to ensure that its commitment to peace and<br />
disarmament will be backed by a high degree of professional<br />
competence. I have mentioned our appointment of an Ambassador for<br />
Disarmament, whose t~ l1e is to represent Australia in<br />
international forum6", especially the Conference on<br />
Disarmament in Geneva. gilithin the Department of Foreign<br />
Affairs there has been a major strengthening of capacity to<br />
handle disarmament issues through the deployment of<br />
additional personnel to the Disarmament and Arms Control and<br />
the Nuclear Policy areas.<br />
The Government attaches great importance to the analytical<br />
and creative role of academic institutions.<br />
Mr Hayden announced in March 1984 that decisions had been<br />
taken to provide funds on a seven year basis to enable a<br />
peace research centre to be established at the Australian<br />
National University.<br />
Its purpose will be to provide a nucleus for serious and<br />
scholarly research into the whole field of peace,<br />
disarmament and arms control. Australia has also<br />
contributed financially to the United Nations Institute for<br />
Disarmament Research ( UNIDIR) which aims to raise the level<br />
of research into disarmament and arms control problems. </p>
<p>7.<br />
In addition the Government has made a voluntary contribution<br />
to the World Disarmament Campaign, the purpose of which is<br />
to inform, educate and to generate public understanding and<br />
support for the objectives of the United nations in the area<br />
of disarmament.<br />
In 1986, which has been designated by the United Nations as<br />
the International Year of Peace, the Government intends to<br />
S: commemorate the Year with a program of appropriate<br />
activities. Of the many -initiatives we have taken in the field of arms<br />
control, I draw particular attention to our efforts on<br />
behalf of the Non-proliferation Treaty and a comprehensive<br />
. test ban treaty.<br />
I stress again, as I did when tabling the ASTEC Report, the<br />
Sparticular and fundamental significance which the Government<br />
attaches to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. We regard the NF'T<br />
as the most important multilateral non-proliferation and<br />
arms control agreement in existence. We will continue to do<br />
everything in our power to strengthen international<br />
; i adherence to the Treaty.<br />
In the House on 31 May, I drew attention to the ASTEC<br />
Report's findings that, if international tensions are to be<br />
reduced and the prospects of a peaceful global environment<br />
enhanced, the importance of national and international<br />
energy security cannot be overemphasised. The Report noted<br />
Fi that disruptions in the supply of resources of any sort have<br />
been a cause of into? national tension aind, through human<br />
history, have led to war. The Inquiry concluded that<br />
Australia, through bein ta reliable, long-term supplier of<br />
uranium, is in a position to contribute significantly to<br />
international energy security.<br />
iThe Report expressed the concern that we must all share that<br />
the prevention of nuclear war is of the greatest importance<br />
to all humanity. It also pointed out that should a country<br />
decide to embark on a nuclear weapons program, it was most<br />
unlikely to use a civil reactor to do so for technical and<br />
economic reasons.<br />
i. It concluded that Australia would best be able to make a<br />
significant contribution to non-proliferation and world<br />
peace if it were actively involved in the nuclear fuel<br />
cycle. </p>
<p>In this context, let me recall for Honourable Members what<br />
academician Sakharov, whose credentials as an advocate for<br />
arms control and disarmament are, as I have said, exemplary,<br />
said in 1977 about the civil use of nuclear power:<br />
" It is difficult to explain to a nonspecialist<br />
( although it is actually true) that the nuclear<br />
reactor of a nuclear power station is nothing like<br />
an atomic bomb The development of nuclear<br />
technology has proceeded with much greater<br />
attention to the problems of safety techniques and<br />
pre-servation of the environment than th e<br />
development of such branches of technology as<br />
metallurgy, coke chemistry, m in in g, c he m ical1<br />
industry, coal power stations modern<br />
transportation, chemicalization of agriculture.,<br />
etc. Therefore, the present situation in nuclear<br />
power is relatively good from the point of view of<br />
safety and possible effect on the environment " 1<br />
The House may recall that, when the great debate took place<br />
in this country at the beginning of the last decade on<br />
whether Australia should subscribe to the Nuclear<br />
Non-proliferation Treaty, opponents of the Treaty argued<br />
that we would need a nuclear weapons capacity to repel the<br />
survivors of an atomic war in the Northern hemisphere.<br />
To the great credit and benefit of this country, that<br />
argument did not prevail. The Coalition Government signed<br />
the Treaty in 1970 and the previous Labor Government moved<br />
-rapidly-to ratify i, ,, in-January 1973.<br />
I now reiterate that thAt Labor Government categorically<br />
rejects any nuclear weapons option for Australia.<br />
Another of Australia's primary objectives in contributing to<br />
curbing the nuclear arms race has been to promote a<br />
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty ( CTB) which would<br />
outlaw all nuclear tasting by all states in all environments<br />
for all time.<br />
Australia has been active on this issue both in the United<br />
Nations and in the Conference on Disarmament, and in<br />
bilateral discussions with the nuclear weapons states.<br />
The conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear te~ st ban treaty<br />
would help to put strong pressure on France to cease its<br />
testing program in the Pacific. A universally adhered-to<br />
treaty would also help inhibit the spread of nuclear weapons<br />
by making it impossible to test nuclear explosive devices<br />
including the so-called peaceful nuclear explosions. it<br />
would also help to limit the development of new nuclear<br />
weapons and the improvement of existing nuclear weapons.<br />
Y4 </p>
<p>In addition to advocating the test ban in international<br />
meetings and in bilateral exchanges with other governments,<br />
Australia has played a major role in aeeking to solve<br />
procedural obstacles to the re-convening of a committee of<br />
the Conference on Disarmament on this issue.<br />
To this end Australia and New Zealand sponsored a resolution<br />
at the United Nations General Assembly in 1983 with the ain<br />
of promoting a formulation for a mandate for the committee,<br />
that would receive general agreement. This resolution<br />
achieved a large measure of support and, unlike competing<br />
resolutions on the same topic by Mexico and the Soviet<br />
Union, it attracted no negative votes.<br />
Our efforts had some influence in the encouraging<br />
development that the United States abstained on this<br />
resolution, after voting against a similar resolution the<br />
: 4 year before.<br />
Notwithstanding a number of major difficulties which have to<br />
date prevented agreement, we are continuing patiently and<br />
assiduously to pursue this objective and to seek to build on<br />
the modest progress already achieved.<br />
In further support of the test ban objective, an Australian<br />
expert from the Bureau of Mineral Resources is participating<br />
in the Group of Seismic Experts which is considering<br />
questions relevant to a global scientific network to monitor<br />
a test ban. Australia's geographic situation means we have<br />
an important potential role in such a qiobal network.<br />
A major purpose of eour efforts in the multilateral<br />
disarmament field is to/ tiring influence to bear on the<br />
bilateral relationship of the United States and the USSR.<br />
Australia has consistently urged the United States and the<br />
Soviet Union to seek agreements to limit and reduce their<br />
nuclear stockpiles and has supported their negotiations to<br />
this end: the Strategic Arms Reduction talks ( START) and the<br />
talks on intermediate-range Nuclear Forces ( INF). It was a<br />
great disappointment to the Government when these<br />
negotiations were suspended by the Soviet Union and the<br />
Government has expressed on many occasions its hope that<br />
they-will be resumed as soon as possible. Australia is not<br />
of course a party to these negotiations but the Government<br />
is doing what it can to encourage resumption-of these<br />
negotiations and to break down the barriers of mistrust and<br />
suspicion. In the Government's view, adequate and effective provision<br />
for verification is a crucial precondition for progress in<br />
arms control negotiations. Another fundamental requirement<br />
is the maintenance of effective and stable deterrence<br />
between the superpowers and the contribution which that<br />
makes to a climate of confidence. Without this there can be<br />
no progress. </p>
<p>There are special reasons why our role in this is and will<br />
remain something more than modest. We contribute positively<br />
to verification and stable and effective deterrence. Our<br />
standing in these matters derives not only from our policy<br />
commitments and objectives but From the presence of, and the<br />
important role played by, the Australian-United States Joint<br />
Defence Facilities on our soil.<br />
At its highest levels, the United States Administration has<br />
been consulted on and has acceded to issuance of the<br />
following statement:<br />
Australia-United States Joint Defence Facilities<br />
Since coming to office the Government has<br />
determined to act upon its undertaking to provide<br />
the public with a statement on the general purpose<br />
and functions of the defence facilities we operate<br />
jointly with oi-t American ally.<br />
Successive Governments have maintained secrecy<br />
about the facilities at Pine Gap and Nurrungar.<br />
this sometimes arouses concern about the sorts of<br />
activities we might be becoming involved in, and<br />
about possible dangers to our security. Our<br />
Pa rt y'Is Platform, therefore, C allIs on th e<br />
Government to make known to the public the general<br />
purpose and functions of the f a c iIi t ies and any<br />
change to these.<br />
When the Mg isters ' for Def enc.. and Foreign Af fairs<br />
were in Wa ' shing on in July last year they took the<br />
opportuni ty tcoV raise these matters with the U<br />
Secretary of Defence, Mr Weinberger, and relevant<br />
authorities in the Pentagon.<br />
We are concerned that such a statement should not<br />
damage our own and our allies' interests and<br />
accordingly the Government does not intend to act<br />
unilaterally and in disregard of international<br />
assurances about preservation of secrecy given by<br />
our predecessors for over a decade. Nevertheless,<br />
there is a good deal that can be said to provide<br />
reassurance to the Australian people.<br />
The facilities are not military b. a-ses. There are<br />
no combat personnel or combat equipments there, no<br />
military stores or workshops, no plant or machinery<br />
or laboratories for research, development,<br />
production or maintenance of any weapons or combat<br />
systems of any type. </p>
<p>Timely knowledge of developments that have military<br />
significance is very important and can be critical<br />
for the security o f the US and its allies,<br />
including Australia. Effective deterrence and<br />
hence avoidance o f c o n fIic t depend o n th is<br />
S im il1a rly effective measures f or m ili t a ry<br />
restraint and for the control and reduction of<br />
armaments depend upon reliable assessments of<br />
military developments. Arms limitation<br />
arrangements between the United States and the<br />
Soviet Union specifically provide for verification.<br />
The-general purpose of the facilities that we<br />
operate a t Nurrungar and P in e Gap w it h th e<br />
Americans i s t o contribute t o all o f these<br />
objectives. Among the functions performed are the provision of<br />
early warning by receiving from space satellite: 3<br />
information ab o ut m iss ilIe launches, and th e<br />
provision of information about the occurrence of<br />
nuclear explosions, which assists in nuclear test<br />
ban monitoring and supports nuclear<br />
non-proliferation measures. Disclosures of other<br />
technical functions of the classified facilites<br />
would involve damage to both US and Australian<br />
interests and cannot be justified.<br />
The purpose and functions of the joint defence,<br />
facility at North West Cape have already been made!<br />
public. It is a communicaticons relay station for<br />
-ships and p~ imarines of the United States-Navy andV<br />
the Royal" Australian Navy and serves as a key<br />
element in atc omplex system of communications<br />
supporting the global balance. As indicated in the<br />
statement which the Minister for Defence tabled in<br />
Parliament o n 3 November 1983, agreement wa s<br />
reached with the United States Government on new<br />
arrangements to ensure that the Australian<br />
Government would be able to make timely judgements<br />
about the significance for national interest of<br />
developments involving North West Cape.<br />
These new arrangements are now in force. The<br />
Government is sa t is f ied that Australia's<br />
sovereignty in the operation of the joint defence<br />
facility at North West Cape is now adequately<br />
protected. 11. </p>
<p>12.<br />
Some people express concern about possible risks to<br />
our security from those facilitea. The Government<br />
takes the view that the joint facilities directly<br />
contribute to the security that we enjoy every day<br />
and that this tangible -benef it outweighs the<br />
possibility that risks might arise at some future<br />
time from our hosting the facilities. For many<br />
years our intelligence and defence authorities have<br />
assessed the risk of nuclear war as remote and<br />
improbable, provided effective deterrence is<br />
maintained. Australians cannot claim the full protection of<br />
that deterrence without being willing to make some<br />
contribution to its effectiveness. I t is important<br />
to support stability in the strategic relationship<br />
between the superpowers and our co-operation in the<br />
joint facilities at North West Cape, Pine Gap and<br />
Nurrungar does this.<br />
As to the specific risk of nuclear attack on theso<br />
facilities in the event of nuclear war it is not;<br />
possible to be categoric; we cannot enter the minds<br />
of possibly hostile foreign military planners. The<br />
Government believes that hosting the facilitiev<br />
does bring with it some degree of added -risk of'<br />
nuclear attack. But the maintenance of effective<br />
deterrence including through early. warning has as<br />
its' purpose the avoidance of ' war between the<br />
nuclear powers. Such * a war would inevitably affect.<br />
all natio, I2 including Australia, and itsavinc<br />
is' edsentfal for the security of-* the Australian<br />
people.-The -preservation of, peace between the nuclear<br />
powers has-for ' many. years been dependent upon a<br />
situation * of* * stable deterrence.-Maintaining, and<br />
where-possible enhancing, the stability;* of that<br />
de terrent relationship-is the objective of this<br />
Government in these matters. Deterrence can be<br />
pursued through any means of convincing's potential<br />
aggressor that he would face unacccoptable costs,<br />
but stability requires discrimination and<br />
restraint. We do not believe there can be a winning side in a<br />
nuclear war. The notion of a nuclear first strike<br />
designed to disarm an adversary would be<br />
destabilizing were it to gain credence.<br />
Nor can there be any assurance that nuclear<br />
conflict between the super-powers could be limited.<br />
This Government's voice on su~ ch matters will be<br />
directed towards supporting doc * trines which eschew<br />
moving beyond the requirements of stable deterrence<br />
towards postures more appropriate to waging nuclear<br />
war in some limited and controlled way. </p>
<p>13.<br />
While we recognise that in present global.<br />
circumstances a unilateral move away from a policy<br />
of maintaining stable deter'rence is not a realistic:<br />
option, the Australian Government is committed to<br />
working for measures to stabilize the strategic<br />
balance, on which stable deterrence depends, and tc<br />
curb arms competition. Through equitable and<br />
verifiable measures for arms control and reduction,<br />
we seek to limit qualitative improvements in arms<br />
and to reduce the-forces involved.<br />
The -Government does not intend to comment further<br />
upon speculation or assertions about the joint<br />
facilities at Pine Gap and Nurrungar. Enough has<br />
been said, however, to correct some serious<br />
misunderstandings and to provide the reassurance<br />
that people properly seek.<br />
Finally, let me emphasise again that these<br />
facilites are jointly managed and operated by the<br />
Australian and American Governments. All functions<br />
and activities require, and have, the full<br />
knowledge and concurrence of the Australian<br />
Government. Vle monitor this and we are satisfied<br />
that the operations of the facilities in no -way<br />
derogate from Australian sovereignty.<br />
Mr Speaker, as I have indicated, the United States<br />
Administration has been consulted on the statement I have<br />
just made and has acceded to its issuance. The Government'. s<br />
wish to make this st-E' ement met with understanding and<br />
co-operation from the UI. jS. Administratia.<br />
This has enabled me to make today to this parliament the<br />
most comprehensive public statement on the facilities yet<br />
made by an Australian Prime Minister or Minister.<br />
The lack of public-information until now on the purposes of<br />
the facilities has not assisted public understanding of the<br />
vital issues involved. It is to be regretted that the<br />
previous Government did not make the necessary effort to see<br />
that the Australian people viere properly informed. This has<br />
helped build up an unwarranted mystique about them and<br />
encouraged a tendency in certain sections of the media and<br />
elsewhere to discuss Nurrungar and Pine gap in a speculative<br />
and provocative manner.<br />
Some Australian groups and individuals call for the closing<br />
of the joint defence facilities. The Government recognises<br />
many of such calls as being sincerely made. We regard them<br />
as misguided but not hostile in intent. </p>
<p>14.<br />
I do not expect that such calls will now cease. But I ask<br />
those making them to consider very seriously the<br />
implications of what they are demanding. As I havo<br />
indicated, the removal of the joint facilities would hinder<br />
U. S. efforts to maintain effective and atable deterrence and<br />
would damage the capacity of the United States for<br />
monitoring and verification, so striking a very serious blow<br />
at the prospect of arms control agreements between the<br />
super-powers. Such a development would dash the hopes of<br />
ordinary men and women around the world for peace and<br />
disarmament. Moreover, I draw particular attention to the early warning<br />
function mentioned in the statement I have just made, and to<br />
the significance of that function for the avoida* ence of<br />
nuclear war. In an uncertain and suspicious international<br />
climate, no action should be taken which would reduce<br />
stability or increase the risk of war through<br />
miscalculation. Mr Speaker,<br />
As we contemplate the momeintous events of 40 years ago, we<br />
can be profoundly thankful for the efforts and sacrifices of<br />
those who participated in D-Day. They fought for a cause<br />
which was incontrovertibly-right. They helped creato a<br />
world which has managed since to avoid the horror of global<br />
conflict.. We might also think for a moment of those who had fought<br />
with equal bravery in. rrhe Great War, believing that that<br />
would prove to be thi'war to end wars. The bloodshed at<br />
Gallipoli, in particulargsi4ias left an indelible impression<br />
on the Australian national consciousness.<br />
Vie may also recall the indignation and pity which the<br />
horrors of that war aroused among the young men who went to<br />
fight on the Western Front. The great English poet, Wilfred<br />
Owen, notwithstanding his winning the Military Cross a month<br />
before he died in battle in 1918 at the age of 25, was a<br />
passionate opponent of viar. The title of one of his poems,<br />
" Anthem for Doomed Youth", sums up the tragedy of that<br />
generation. In letters to his family early in 1917, Owen wrote that " No<br />
Man's Land is pockmarked like a body of foulest disease and<br />
its odour is the breath of cancer No Man's Land under<br />
snow is like the face of the moon, chaotic, crater-ridden,<br />
uninhabitable, awful, the abode of madness". He described<br />
" the universal pervasion of ugliness. Hideous landscapes,<br />
vile noises everything unnatural, broken, blasted;<br />
the distortion of the dead, whose unburiable bodies sit<br />
outside the dug-outs all day, all night, the most execrable<br />
sights on earth". </p>
<p>I,<br />
That was one poet's vision of the First World War. Should<br />
there be a nuclear war, the whole world will be a No Man's<br />
Land. There will be no ao to sing the anthem for our young<br />
generations, if vie are unable to prevent global conflict.<br />
Such a conflict, which. God forbid, would indeed be a war to<br />
end war -it would threaten the extinction of humanity.<br />
It is precisely to prevent such a catastrophe that so many<br />
Australian people have taken up the cause of peace and<br />
disarmament. And it is precisely to achieve the same end<br />
that the Government has, from its perspective, developed its<br />
policies on arms control and disarmament to which it will<br />
continue to devote its highest priority. </p>
