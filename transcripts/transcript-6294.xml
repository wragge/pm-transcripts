TO THE NATIONAL SCIENCE SUMMER SCHQOL<br />
CANBERRA<br />
16 JANUARY 1984<br />
EXCELLENCY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,<br />
I WAS DELIGHTED TO RECEIVE THE INVITATION TO JOIN YOU<br />
AT THIS OPENING OF THE FIRST NATIONAL, SCIENCE SUMMER SCHOOL,<br />
THE INITIATIVE IN BRINGING TOGETHER SO MANY STUDENTS<br />
FROM ALL PARTS OF AUSTRALIA AND OVERSEAS IS BOTH TIMELY<br />
AND NEEDED. A GATHERING OF SO MANY STUDENTS FROM SUCH DIVERSE<br />
AREAS AND BACKGROUNDS MUST BE AN ENRICHING EXPERIENCE FOR<br />
ALL INVOLVED. IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE I HAVE FOUND SUCH GATHERINGS<br />
PROFOUNDLY IMPORTANT FOR THOSE WHO ARE OPEN TO IT,<br />
HORIZONS CAN BE LIFTED, NEW WORLDS REVEALED AND THE CHALLENGE<br />
OF THE FUTURE DEFINED.<br />
THIS GATHERING SHOULD BE NO EXCEPTION. / 2 </p>
<p>PARTICIPANTS CAN EXPECT TO MEET MANY LEADERS OF<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY AND WILL LEARN A GREAT DEAL ABOUT<br />
AUSTRALIAN AND WOR. LD SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL<br />
DEVELOPMENTS1 YOU WILL HAVE AN UNPARALLELED OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN<br />
OF THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT AND SCIENCE AS THEY AFFECT NOT<br />
ONLY YOUR EVERDAY LIFE BUT ALSO YOUR FUTURE,<br />
FROM THIS SUMMER SCHOOL YOU SHOULD ALL EMERGE<br />
BETTER EQUIPPED TO PLAN EFFECTIVELY FOR YOUR EDUCATIONAL<br />
AND VOCATIONAL FUTURES.<br />
THAT THE CANBERRA DEVELOPMENT BOARD AND NATIONAL<br />
SCIENTIFIC BODIES SUCH AS THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCE, THE<br />
ACADEMY OF TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCE, ANZAAS, THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, AND CSIRO IN CO-OPERATION WITH ROTARY,<br />
THE SCIENCE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION, THE QUEEN ELIZABETH 11 TRUST,<br />
AND THE DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION IN STATES AND TERRITORIES<br />
, HAVE ALL CO-OPERATED SO EFFECTIVELY AND MADE THIS SUMMER<br />
SCHOOL POSSIBLE IS DESERVING OF THE HIGHEST PRAISE.<br />
ALL THOSE INVOLVED MUST BE COMMENDED FOR THEIR<br />
EFFORTS. AUSTRALIA NEEDS CO-OPERATIVE ACTION OF THIS KIND. </p>
<p>3-<br />
WE NEED TO MAR. HIALL -) UR HUM4AN FPESOURCES AS<br />
EFFECTIVELY AS WE CANA<br />
THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED BY THIS SUMMER<br />
SCHOOL TO ALERT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO WHAT WE AS A<br />
NATION MUST DO TO SECURE A HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS FUTURE<br />
FOR OUR PEOPLE IS INVALUABLE,<br />
THE SUCCESS OF THIS EXERCISE WILL BE MEASURED<br />
BY THE HEIGHTENED AWARENESS OF ALL INVOLVED AND BY<br />
THE QUESTIONS. IMPRESSIONS AND IDEAS GENERATED IN<br />
EACH PARTICIPANT'S MIND BY THE UNIQUE EXPERIENCE EACH<br />
IS PRIVILEGED TO SHARES<br />
ISHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF MANY OF YOU CAME<br />
AWAY FROM THIS SUMMER SCHOOL IMPRESSED BY THE SPEED<br />
AND COMPLEXITY OF THE CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH<br />
CONTEMPORARY SCIENTIFIC ANDi TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS<br />
THE CONSEQUENCES OF MANY OF THESE CHANGES ARE<br />
STILL ONLY VAGUELY APPRECIATED BY MANY IN OUR COMMUNITYTHE<br />
CONFUSED AND SOMETIMES FEARFUL RESPONSE WE SOMETIMES<br />
SEE ONLY SERVES TO UNDERLINE THE NEED TO RAISE THE LEVEL<br />
OF COMMUNITY UNDERSTANDING OF THE TECHNICAL AND SOCIAL<br />
ASPECTS OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY4 A A A </p>
<p>-L4-<br />
ICAN THINK OF NO BETTER PLACE TO START THAN HERE<br />
WITH AND THROUGH YOU THE YOUNGER GENERATION.<br />
THROUGH YOU I WOULD BE HOPEFUL THAT TRULY<br />
AUSTRALIAN APPROACHES AND SOLUTIONS MIGHT BE DEVISED.<br />
THERE IS A FINE BALANCE TO BE STRUCK HERE.<br />
ADVANCES IN MICROELECTRONICS HAVE BEEN VAST AND<br />
MANY PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY IN~ YOUR AGE GROUP, HAVE HAD LITTLE<br />
DIF FICULTY IN ADAPTING TO AND-ACCEPTING THE NEW PR ODUCTS<br />
AND~ PROCESS, FOR OTHERS HOWEVER MANY OF THE NEW DEVELOPMENTSWHILE<br />
PERHAPS BRINGING* SOME BENEFITS HAVE BROUGHT NEW<br />
PROBLEMS WHICH SHOULD BE RECOGNISED BY THE COMMUNITY<br />
AT LARGE. IWAS STRUCK RECENTLY BY COMMENTS OF A MR JOSEPH KROGER,<br />
PRESIDENT OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AT SPERRY CORPORATION,,<br />
QUOTED IN TH1E. AUSTALI. AN; HE OBSERVED THAT:<br />
" AS BREAKTHROUGH PILED UPON BREAKTHROUGH ( IN 1983),<br />
IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT THE MUCH VAUNTED COMPUTER<br />
REVOLUTION IS HAVING AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A<br />
MORE PROFOUND EFFECT UPON OUR DAILY LIVES THAN ANYONE<br />
EVER DREAMED... </p>
<p>" WE HAVE PROGRESSED FROM COMPUTERS THAT CALCULATE<br />
AND STORE DATA TO COMPUTERS THAT ALMOST REASON<br />
. AND CERTAINLY SOLVE PROBLEMS, THE IMPLICATIONS<br />
( OF EXPERT SYSTEMS) FOR PROBLEM SOLVING IN SUCH<br />
DIVERSE FIELDS AS MATHEMATICSj . SCIENCE AND<br />
ENGINEERING ARE STAGGERING, COMBINE THESE SYSTEMS,"<br />
SAID MR KROGERJ " WITH MECHANICAL CREATURES THAT<br />
OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY ROBOTS AND YOU'VE<br />
ADDED A WHOLE NEW DIMENSION TO THE WORKPLACE,<br />
THE HOME, THE SCHOOL AND PRACTICALLY EVERY OTHER<br />
INSTITUTION,"<br />
COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING, COMPUTERASSISTED<br />
DIAGNOSIS OF DISEASE AND THE PRESCRIPTION OF<br />
TREATMENT AND THE USE OF COMPUTERS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF<br />
BOTH PERSONAL AND BUSINESS ACCOUNTS, ARE APPLICATIONS<br />
WITH WHICH MOST OF US ARE FAMILIAR TO THE POINT O<br />
BEING " BLASbt" ABOUT THEM.<br />
WHAT IS LESS OFTEN RECOGNISED IS HOW THE COSTS<br />
ASSOCIATED WITH COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY HAVE FALLEN IN THE<br />
RECENT PAST, MR KROGER MAY HAVE BEEN EXAGGERATING<br />
BUT HE WAS PROBABLY NOT FAR WIDE OF THE MARK WHEN HE<br />
OBSERVED: vo/ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
" COMPARED TO THE COST OF A GOOD TRANSISTOR<br />
YEARS AGO ( SOMEWHERE BETWEEN $ 1 AND<br />
A MORE POWERFUL TRANSISTOR IN A NEW COMPUTER<br />
CHIP COST THE EQUIVALENT OF ONE-HUNDREDTH OF<br />
A CENT. HAD THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY,"<br />
HE CONCLUDED, ItBEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN A SIMILAR<br />
RATIO OF IMPROVED PRICE-PERFORMANCE, YOU AND<br />
I COULD BUY A ROLLS-ROYCE FOR $ 2.50 AND GET<br />
OVER 2 MILLION MILES TO THE GALLON."<br />
WHAT THIS ALL MEANS IS NOT THAT WE CAN EXPECT<br />
DRAMATIC ECONOMIES IN THE MOTOR-VEHICLE INDUSTRY<br />
( ALTHOUGH THE MANUFACTURERS IN THAT INDUSTRY WOULD BE<br />
AMONG THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT THEIR ADOPTION OF ADVANCES<br />
MADE POSSIBLE BY THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS GOING TO BE<br />
CRUCIAL TO THEIR LONG-TERM COMPETITIVENESS AND SURVIVAl),<br />
BUT THAT ALL OF US CAN ASSUME RELATIVELY EASY ACCESS TO<br />
THE PRODUCTS, PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS ASSOCIATED WITH<br />
COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY,<br />
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT WE MUST ALL LEARN TO<br />
ADJUST TO THE REALITIES OF THE COMPUTER AGES </p>
<p>-7-o<br />
PERSONALLY I SEE THIS AS BEING CRUCIAL TO OUR<br />
FUTURE PROSPERITY AS A NATION.<br />
MY GOVERN~ MENT WAS ELECTED TO GET AUSTRALIAN MOVING<br />
AGAIN;' TO STEM AND THEN TO REVERSE THE DECLINE IN<br />
EMPLOYMENT; TO RAISE THE LIVING STANDAR~ DS OF AUSTRALIANS;'<br />
AND TO RESTORE AUSTRALIANS' SENSE OF THEIR NATION AS A<br />
FAIR AND EQUITABLE SOCIETY,<br />
IF WE ARE GOING TO SUCCEED, THEN WE MUST SECURE<br />
STRONG AND STEADY ECONOMIC GROWTH OVER LONG PERIODS.<br />
THE PROGRESSIVE INTRODUCTION OF PRODUCTIVE<br />
NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS AN ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITE FOR THE<br />
ACHIEVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF HIGH GROWTH RATES.<br />
NONE OF US CAN AFFORD TO BE COMPLACENT IN THE FACE<br />
OF A RECENT SURVEY BY THE EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT FO WHICH<br />
PORTRAYED AUSTRALIA AS A RICHLY ENDOWED ECONOMY SHOWING<br />
LITTLE INNOVATIVE FLAIR AND POOR PRODUCTIVITY LAGGING<br />
BEHIND COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE OVERCOME THE HANDICAP OF<br />
SCARCE RESOURCES WITH A HIGH-QUALITY WORKFORCE1 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
AUSTRALIA SIMPLY CANNOT HOPE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY<br />
( AND THEREFORE TO GROW VIGOROUSLY) IN CIRCUMSTANCES<br />
WHERE 25 PER CENT OF MACHINE TOOLS NN USE IN AUSTRALIA<br />
ARE UNDER TEN YEARS OLD COMPARED TO MORE THAN<br />
PER CENT IN JAPAN,<br />
BOTH AUSTRALIAN MANAGEMENT AND LABOUR MUST BEAR<br />
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS PARLOUS SITUATION.<br />
MUCH GREATER EMPHASIS MUST BE PLACED ON INDUSTRIAL<br />
REISEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, SECONDARY PROCESSING AND ON<br />
WORKER PARTICIPATION IF WE ARE TO GET AHEAD IN AN<br />
INTENSELY COMPETITIVE WORLD.<br />
THE TASK BEFORE US IS TO MAKE TECHNOLOGY WORK<br />
FOR AUSTRALIA. THERE IS NO ESCAPING THE FACT THAT INDUSTRIAL<br />
INNOVATION IS ESSENTIAL TO AUSTRALIA'S FUTURE WELL-BEING,<br />
NOT ONLY IN NEW INDUSTRIES, BUT THROUGHOUT ESTABLISHED<br />
INDUSTRIES AS WELL.<br />
OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITHIN<br />
OUR OWN REGIONj ARE UNDERTAKING NEW LONG-TERM INVESTMENrSj<br />
ADOPTING NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND APPLYING NEW<br />
TECHNOLOGIES, 1.1/ 9 </p>
<p>-9<br />
AUSTRALKA'S LOCATION IN THE MOST DYNAMIC,<br />
FORWARD-LOOKING PART OF THE WORLD IMPOSES ON OUR INDUSTRIES<br />
A NEED TO DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES NEW PRODUCTS AND<br />
PROCESSES IF WE. ARE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY,<br />
THE UPGRADING OF AUSTRALIA'S TECHNOLOGICAL BASE<br />
IS ESSENTIAL IF OUR COMPETITIVE PERFORMANCE IS TO BE<br />
IMPROVED, AND THAT IS WHERE YOU ALL COME IN.<br />
WE ARE COUNTING ON YOUR GENERATION TO BRING THE<br />
FLAIR, UNDERSTANDING AND TECHNICAL ABILITIES NEEDED<br />
TO ENSURE THAT VE CAN MATCH AND SURPASS THE BEST THE<br />
REST OF THE WORLD CAN PRODUCE,<br />
THE CHALLENGE IS A TOUGH ONE BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY<br />
VITAL TO THE QUALITY OF AUSTRALIA'S LONG-TERM PROSPECTS<br />
THAT IT BE MET,<br />
THIS IS NOT TO UNDERESTIMATE THE DIFFICULTIES,<br />
THERE ARE, FOR EXAMPLE, CONSIDERABLE SOCIAL<br />
IMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. ,. 1/ 10 </p>
<p>-1o-<br />
WE HAVE ALL HEARD HOW NEW TECHNOLOGIES WILL<br />
HELP-OUR WORK AND LEAD TO INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY AND<br />
LEISURE TIME.<br />
AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE SEEING AN INCREASING<br />
NUMBER OF INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES CENTRED ON THE INTRODUCTION<br />
OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. IN SOME CASES THIS IS DUE TO IGNORANCE OF HOW THE<br />
NEW PROCESS IS TO OPERATE,<br />
IN MANY INSTANCES,, HOWEVER, IT IS THE RESULT OF<br />
WELL-FOUNDED FEARS THAT EXISTING JOBS WILL BECOME REDUNDANT<br />
AND CONSEQUENTLY THERE WILL BE INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT ! N<br />
THOSE OCCUPATIONS, IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT THE GOVERNMENT PLACES A<br />
VERY HIGH PRIORITY ON THE TRAINING AND RETRAINING OF<br />
WORKERS TO FILL THE NEW JOBS WHICH WILL BE CREATEDJ BY<br />
TECHNOLOG ICAL ADVANCE@<br />
WE ARE ALSO VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE NEED TO MONITOR<br />
THE IMPACT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES ON WORKERS'I HEALTH',<br />
Too OFTEN IN THE PAST, PROCESSES HAILED AS GREAT<br />
ADVANCES HAVE LATER BEEN SHOWN TO BE HAZARDOUS, IN SOME<br />
CASES DEADLY, TO0 THOSE WORKING WITH THEM. 1. / l </p>
<p>-11-<br />
My GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED TO ENSURE THAT THIS<br />
SHOULDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN,<br />
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO<br />
LEAD TO EVEN GREATER INEQUALITIES IN OUR SOCIETY<br />
BETWEEN THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND AND CAN WORK WITH THE NEW<br />
; TECHNOLOGIES AND THOSE WHOSE JOBS ARE DESTROYED BY THEM.<br />
IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A COMMUNITY TO ENSURE<br />
THAT THIS DOESN IT OCCUR AND THAT BENEFITS ARE SHARED BY<br />
ALL MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY,<br />
I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT OUR BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR<br />
MEETING THE CHALLENGES OFFERED BY TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE<br />
LIES IN CONSULTATION AND DISCUSSION BETWEEN ALL CONCERNED<br />
BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS, EMPLOYERS, WORKERS AND THE COMMUNITY<br />
GENERALLY. ONLY IN THIS WAY IS IT LIKELY THAT THE COSTS AND<br />
BENEFITS OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE FULLY UNDERSTOOD AND<br />
DISTRIBUTED EQUITABLY THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY.<br />
IF WE ARE TO KEEP UP WITH THE PACE OF CHANGE,<br />
AUSTRALIA'S WORKFORCE IN THE FUTURE WILL HAVE TO BE<br />
INCREASINGLY FLEXIBLE, ABLE TO ADAPT READILY TO NEW<br />
TECHNOLOGIES, o,,/ 12 </p>
<p>-12-<br />
TO ENSURE TIS YOUR EDUCATION AND TRAINING MUST BE<br />
CAREFULLY GEARED TO CONTEMPORARY AND FUTURE NEEDS.<br />
THIS IS ESSENTIAL IF YOU ARE TO REALISE YOUR<br />
POTENTIAL AS INDIVIDUALS AND TO MAXIMISE THE BENEFIT TO<br />
SOCIETY OF YOUR CAPABILITIES.<br />
OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM WILL HAVE FAILED IF IT DOES<br />
NOT EQUIP YOU WITH THE BROAD SKILLS AND UNDERSTANDING<br />
NECESSARY TO COPE WITH TP'E PROCESS OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE.<br />
THIS IS OF OBVIOUS RELEVANCE TO ALL OF YOU GATISERED<br />
HERE TODAY. BUT I ALSO HAVE IN MIND OTHERS IN YOUR<br />
GENERATION WHO ARE PERHAPS LESS FORTUNATE THAN YOURSELVES.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT IS INTENS ELY AWARE THAT CHANGES IN<br />
SOCIAL* UQHE~ j IN TECHNOLOGY AND IN ' THE ECONOMIC SITOATION<br />
HIAVE ALL HAD THEIR EFFECT ON YOUNG PEOPLE.<br />
WE ARE VERY AWARE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY<br />
EXPRESSING THEMSELVES IN A NUMBER OF: WAYS AND AREAS THAT<br />
DIFFER FROM THOSE OF THE EARLY SEVENTIES AND THAT THIS IS<br />
HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ATTITUDES AND ASPIRATIONS. </p>
<p>INCREASINGLY I SEE YOUNG PEOPLE ACTIVELY<br />
CONCERNING THEMSELVES WITH SUCH AREAS AS ENVIRONMENTALISM,<br />
THE STATUS OF WOMEN, THE PEACE MOVEMENT, THE RIGHTS OF<br />
ABORIGINALS, ALTERNATIVE LIFESTYLESJ THE NEEDS OF<br />
STUDENTS AND THE UNEMPLOYED.<br />
IN MANY CASES YOUNG PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED MORE WITH<br />
THE NATURE OF PERSONAL AND COMMUNITY RELATIONSHIPS THAN<br />
WITH THE FORMAL STRUCTURES IN WHICH SUCH RELATIONSHIPS<br />
HAVE TENDED TO OPERATE IN THE PAST. THEY SEEM<br />
PARTICULARLY CONCERNED TO PARTICIPATE IN DECISION-MAKING<br />
AND TO DEMOCRATISE PROCESSES SUCH AS EDUCATION,<br />
EMPLOYMENT AND TRAININGI<br />
THESE TRENDS, WHILE PERHAPS PUTTING PRESSURE ON<br />
ESTABLISHED ATTITUDES AND INSTITUTIONSj ARE ENCOURAGING.<br />
THEY REFLECT THE VITALITY OF OUR YOUTH AND SUGGEST<br />
A GENUINE INTEREST IN THE QUALITY AND CHARACTER OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN LIFE.<br />
PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY THEY HIGHLIGHT A REFUSAL<br />
TO ACQUIESCE IN THE STATUS QUO AND A GENUINE COMMITMENT<br />
TO BUILDING A BETTER LIFE FOR THEMSELVES AND THOSE<br />
AROUND THEM.<br />
WE NEED SUCH COMMITMENT. ./ 14 </p>
<p>14-<br />
IN THIS REGARD I FOUND IT INTERESTING THAT SOME<br />
RECENT RESEARCH SUGGESTED THAT., WHILE YOUNG PEOPLE TEND<br />
TO SEE A GOOD DEAL OF THEIR SCHOOL EXPERIENCE AS<br />
IRRELEVANT TO THEIR REAL NEEDS, EMPLOYMENT WAS SEEN AS<br />
IMPORTANT AND DESIRABLED<br />
CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEFj THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE<br />
OF A WEAKENING OF THE " WORK ETHIC" AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE<br />
WHO RATHER ASSOCIATED EMPLOYMENT WITH PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT<br />
AND SELF-ESTEEM.<br />
CONSCIOUS OF THIS, AND DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT<br />
CONTINUING VERY HIGH RATES OF YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT AND<br />
DEEPLY WORRIED ABOUT THE LONGER-TERM IMPLICATIONS OF<br />
ALARMINGLY LOW PARTICIPATION RATES IN AUSTRALIA' S UPPER<br />
SECONDARY AND TERTIARY EDUCATION. THE GOVERNMENT HAS<br />
EMBARKED ON A MAJOR REVIEW OF ITS YOUTH POLICIES AND<br />
PROGRAMS&amp; WE ARE LOOKING VERY CAREFULLY AT WAYS IN WHICH THE<br />
NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE CAN BE BETTER MET, INCLUDING<br />
ALTERNATIVE POLICIES, PROGRAMS AND ARRANGEMENTS IN EDUCATION,<br />
TRAINING, EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME SUPPORT.<br />
I EXPECT THE RESULTS OF THIS REVIEW TO BE<br />
AVAILABLE BY HID-YEAR&amp; , s </p>
<p>IN IHE MEANTIME I WOULD URGE ALL THE STUDENTS<br />
AMONG US HERE TODAY TO CONSIDER VERY CAREFULLY NOT ONLY<br />
THE USE TO WHICH THIEIR PARTICIPATION IN THIS SUMMER<br />
SCHOOL CAN BE PUT, BUT MORE GENERALLY, TO REGARD THEIR<br />
FUTURE EDUCATION AS A. MEANS OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS,<br />
EQUIPPING THEMSELVES, THE YOUNGER GENERATIONj AND HENCE<br />
THE NATION, TO SURVIVE AND COMPETE IN THIE ERA OF NEW<br />
TECHNOLOGY, IN THE PROCESS I WOULD HOPE THE EDUCATION SYSTEM<br />
ITSELF IS ADAPTED AND GEARED TO MAKING GENUINE PROVISION<br />
FOR OUR NATION'S REAL NEEDS AT THE SAME TIME AS<br />
OFFERING TRULY SATISFYING EXPERIENCES TO ALL THOSE<br />
CONCERNED. WE OWE THIS TO OURSELVESi WE OWE IT TO OUR<br />
STUDENTS. TO0 THE EXTENT WE ARE SUCCESSFUL WE WILL BE A<br />
MORE PROSPEROUS, SUCCESSFUL NATION. </p>
