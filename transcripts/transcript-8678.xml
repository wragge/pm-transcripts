TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH PRIME MINISTER BY SHARMALA KANDIAM, FRIDAY BACKGROUND.<br />
SINGAPORE BROADCASTING CORPORATION TELEVISION, FOR TRANSMISSION AT 9.30 PM<br />
SINGAPORE TIME ON 25 SEPTEMBER 1992<br />
YB r Int with Paul Xeating<br />
Mr PM, you made it clear that you believe that<br />
Australia's destiny ] ieas in Asia and the<br />
Pacific. how are you going to make the<br />
Auitralians believe that they're part of Asia?<br />
A Well, most of our -rade is already with Asia<br />
abt 60-70t of our exports are to the Asia<br />
Pacific area. We have a lot of relations<br />
already with the region tourism, travel,<br />
investment. So it sort of happened naturally.<br />
I think that what we want to do if anything,<br />
ie simply concentrate the effort. We're still<br />
running a current account deficit that is<br />
our trade accounts arv in surplus but the<br />
overall external accounts are not so if we<br />
want to grow our export mktr, these are tne<br />
places to do it and be more part of the<br />
region in a cultural sense as well.<br />
Q Do you see some difficulty in doing that?<br />
A Not really. Australia is a very multi<br />
cultural society We are providing a world<br />
lesson in toleranoce and the settling of many<br />
ethnic communities as part of our migration<br />
programme in my own constituency, I have a<br />
very large Lebanese-Muslim population, I have<br />
a very large Vietnamese popn, communities<br />
ar well as Greeks and Turks. It's a very<br />
multi-cultural place and I think Australians<br />
find relations with the region pretty easy.<br />
Q They can't say there's no raciam in Australia?<br />
A Well, there's less than in most countries.<br />
There's always some in some corner. But the<br />
tolerance with which Australians have settled<br />
a large programme it is the largest<br />
migration programme per capita certainly in<br />
the Western world you can't do that without<br />
a high deget of tolerance. ' 4 </p>
<p>TEL 2<br />
Q So you feel there's a high understanding of<br />
Asians and oC the Asia Pacific in Australia.<br />
A The natural growth of tourisi and trade J9<br />
taking Australiang into all the parts of the<br />
Asia Pacific area, indeea all parts of the<br />
world, So It's a vory International place<br />
Australia and I think a lot of the parochial<br />
character Australia had in say pro-war or<br />
immediately poat-war has largely dissipated.<br />
Q QQne thing that probably wd make AsiAn<br />
countries real more kindly towards Austral. ia<br />
is the idea of Australia becoming a republic<br />
is that likely to happen you thinkl<br />
A Inevitably, I think It will happen. It's like<br />
all things it will change change comnes in<br />
its own natural way. The country's now more<br />
clearer abt itself, abt its destiny -it's not<br />
a derivative of any other society -it was<br />
once, it's not anymore. I tflirU that's the<br />
impt thing.<br />
Is this the majority feeling?<br />
A Oh yes. The constitutional forms matter but<br />
they don't matter as much as the inner being,<br />
the inner feeling, the Inner confidence and I<br />
think the Auatralians are very confident abt<br />
themselves, abt their own identity and that<br />
they are projecting and I think that's what's<br />
impt.<br />
Q Australia was instrumental in the formation of<br />
APC do you feel that there's some tangible<br />
benefit alroady?<br />
A I think it's a bit early to say there's some<br />
tangible benefit from it but I think it's a<br />
good concept. There isn't the institutional<br />
structurea in the Fa(; If ic tho A~ ia P area<br />
that there aro in til N Atlantic, European<br />
area. And one of the principal features abt<br />
APEC one of the things it can do is to keep<br />
the US engaged in the Asia P area, which I<br />
think is a very inpt thing to do from a<br />
strategic pt of view, Crom a trade and<br />
cultural pt of view and as well as that,<br />
provide a forum where Japan and the US can<br />
work their problems out but a forum which<br />
is also truly representative of the Asia P<br />
area. So APEC I think has great promise. And<br />
Sipore I might say mas done well in being the<br />
inatitutional base for APEC, which I'm sure<br />
will provide much more growth ag time goes on.<br />
0 What shd be done to institutionialise it more<br />
what kind of things do you aee happening?<br />

<p>TEL: 25. Sep. 92 17: 44 No. 026 P. 03/ 04<br />

A Well I think in time -tht Otattes represented,<br />
shd be represented at head of govt<br />
periodically so it has the politloal<br />
horsepower that it needs to get what will be<br />
essentially a trade liberalising job don.<br />
Ministers And ministerial represontn is fine<br />
as far as it goes. But the authority which it<br />
will need, r think it can beat sought from<br />
heads of govt.<br />
Are You getting backinig for this plan?<br />
A Pretty substantially, yes -but again, V ye<br />
got no deadline on it Iust think it' o a<br />
good thing to do and it will mean that we<br />
can sharpen up the f ocus of APEC as we move<br />
through itB history.<br />
Q In torms of you'Ve talked abt how lot of<br />
your trade now is with Asia. The Asian<br />
countr. 1,6 in many ways, they're doing pretty<br />
well what can Australia bring to them?<br />
A It can bring a lot of technology. We havea<br />
deep pure research baise, although that's now<br />
being applied and I thinX you can start to<br />
see that in the things we're doing<br />
collaboratively now with S'pore investors,<br />
with other countries, in areas where we have a<br />
technological edge or where we khave a natural<br />
advantage like food or food processing or<br />
ininerals or minarals beneficiation, or metals,<br />
or in some other specialist technologies like<br />
waste management, telecoms these are all<br />
areas.* For instance, we have a joint venture<br />
with a S'porean company in milJk products which<br />
are being distributed through the region<br />
these sort of things we can do,<br />
Q<br />
Q You've just come from Japan? How do you read<br />
your trip to Japan?<br />
A Well, Jlapan has been a large invastor in<br />
Australia. Japan is our largest trading<br />
partner we have a $ 6 million trade surplus<br />
with them. They've been large investorG over<br />
a long period of time we're starting to<br />
be,; oirte an investor in Japan and the two<br />
countries ar-e getting closer together.<br />
Q Is there any domestic resistance to Japan in<br />
Australia? </p>
<p>TEL: 25. Sep. 92 17: 44 No. 026 P. 04/ 04<br />

A Not very much. Obviously Aomo of the wartime<br />
meiories as they do in S'pore but by and<br />
large, Australians knQw that our balance of<br />
trade has shifted many yrs ago from Europe and<br />
N America even though we do still trade<br />
Substantially with N America the weight of<br />
the change has gone towards N Asia and SE Asia<br />
and the growth really is in SE Asia.<br />
Q Q Australia and S'pore have had a good defence<br />
relationship do you see any new things<br />
happening in that area<br />
A I think like all good and close relationships<br />
they tend to get better and we'll be doing<br />
more things in fact, this very week we have<br />
participated with 8 ahips in a joint exercise<br />
and I'm visiting one or two of the ships<br />
tomorrow. So it's Just another eg of the<br />
continuing close cooperation, not just in<br />
exercise but in personnel exchanges. in the<br />
general sides Of derence I think this<br />
defence arrangement will work well and<br />
I think Australia and s'pore have been of<br />
it.<br />
Thank you very much. </p>
