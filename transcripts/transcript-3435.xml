We have been told that things are<br />bad overseas but surely Australians only care about what is happening<br />here and the-trust that they have in their own leadership?<br />PIRIME MINISTER: I don't agree that all Australians oxily worry about.<br />whnt goes on at home. I think more and more Australians realise<br />that what happens in Australia must be affected alsoby -what happens<br />in other countries.<br />STONE: Yes, but again we don't know what the conditions are there;,<br />we don't know how they are handling the situation over there.<br />We do know that unemployment i8 rising here and inflation is rising<br />here, and so far the Government has not seemed to, offer any deifinite<br />solution. PRIMIE MINISTER: There is no simple solution. If there was, obviously<br />we would have adopted it. But people do have a fair idea what goes on<br />in America or B~ ritain or Western Europe or lIn Japan and thdy know<br />that Inflation is worse in Japan or in Britain than it Is here and<br />they know that unemployment is worse in all three areas, than it is<br />here.,<br />STONE: Yes, I started off by saying that it was a feeling but then<br />are you willing to concede that there is reasonable grouid for<br />assuming that the situation is at least sonmvwhat messy and that our<br />leadership is In some doubt about how to handle it?<br />P'RIME MINISTER: Yes, inevitably. As I say, there is no simple, pasy,<br />popular solution and that is the experience of people in government in<br />the three areas that. 1 have mentioned and in all the comparable countrie-S<br />that you can i,:. ention.' Leadership in politics; is under. challenge<br />everywhere in the weste-rn world.<br />STONE: Going back to your leadership, it seems that every poll is now<br />showing a very sharp drop in popularity and a very -sharp rise in the<br />number of people dissatisfied with what you are'doing. How does that.<br />affect you?<br />PRIMIE MINISMTR. I notice that the papers this morning said that I was<br />more popular than myy competitors, so we are all dropping. And I don't<br />thing you will find a poll in any western country where the head of<br />government is popular, has a popular majority, I am better than my<br />competitors, that is all that I can say at the moment.<br />STO( NE: But that's cold comfort.<br />P'URE MINISTER: Mty word ' it Is.<br />STONE: Particularly for a Prime N. inister w~ o is I wouldn't say<br />0 gotistict. l, but certainly has a great deal of s~ lf-conrid ence, you</p>
<p>called yourself the beat Foreign Minister, one of the great Prime<br />Ministers. H-ow does this make you feel to 8ay Dohwt 1iha an<br />per cent of the people t0hink you are doing a good job?<br />' HIMLE MINISTER: Well, to be precise, I've said I waa the hest<br />Foreign Minister for 20 years I was mentioning since Evatt.<br />I mean let's get it, precise.<br />STONE: O. K. But isn't it, in a way a personal tragedy for you thoti<br />ft man3 who doea exude so much self-zonfidence has not been able to<br />instill that kind of confidence into the public'?<br />PP-114E MINIS'MR: Yes, yen. I think this is disappointing, frustratin i<br />of courfse it in but I must say the fate of everybody el: e in evafrq<br />western country# in every webtern democracy, the current leader cop<br />it. the same way.<br />STONE: But perhaps for different reasonb. Let's just take again yol<br />case apecifically. There does seem to be a gap between what. you<br />promised in the wayv of' leadership * and what you're delivering. . Dir-iL1<br />-the (-lection periods we heard mainly about Gough. Whitlam " You e~ qn<br />depend on him." Now we seem to be hearing only about the four (; In<br />Cairns, Crean,. Came-ron find Caucus sending -as different messageI3,<br />You've tended -to fade into the background.<br />I'RI114T M INI. STER: Well, can Lyou be precise ( in any one of those?) 1n Yf-I<br />my Govvrnment has achieved a very great, des. l indeed. 11-18 achieved<br />more in the 23 months than I think our predecessors did in most<br />in 2: 3 years; t. hat we have done a very grc-al deal. But the vo~~.<br />Aituation throughout the western world is more bewildering than it<br />h a. s heen for over 410 years.<br />ST( JNE: But I'm on a different point now, I'm even willing to conct<br />ihait your Government. 4has aeh~ eved a great deel. We're ta) ing.:, ahnul<br />image now and the image that. comes across, I think, to the public " is<br />that we're hearing an awful lot about D~ r Cairns1 an awful lot b<br />Mr Cameron? an awful lot, about Caucus, we see them on tele vision<br />the press, ' we're seeing less and less of you.<br />PRI 1F. M4 NTSUE~ R You're seeing me now,<br />STO"': Yea we are. it's beenl a long ti me.<br />TPR !\ 11NI1J T2 I': don't remember when youl~ me.<br />STONE: Wpll I think the invitation we won't go into those si~-<br />thiriga. 4,1 he fact is, wouldn't you say, just looking your nc-ws<br />every inorning nd looking at, your television met, that. we do 6pe fin W<br />lot of D~ r Cuirns. and Mr f. ameron, for example.<br />11RIMF. IINISTERi: Quite propc-:' ly, quite Properly.<br />STONE: But I mean are you happy....<br />PRIME MINIST'ER: I mean, you're talking in quite gent-ra~ ispi terms,<br />You say Cal . cus and Connor atnd LCreon and Ctimeron anid ' Caiirns. 1 mean,<br />What precisely do you mean? I meant let's come to,..<br />STONE-: I'm talking about the physical number oftie..<br />FIRMS MITNILSrPR.: Yes.</p>
<p>-3-<br />STONE: that people like Dr Cairns and Mr Catoeron, and I mervtio]<br />those two specifically, show up on television, ohow up in the newspaj~ O-vC<br />saying something about the econamy.<br />PRIME MINISV1EU: Every Tuesday t. hat I'm in-Canberr, I give a press<br />c onference; that Is, everybdy in the Parliamentary Press Gallery<br />can ak me questions once a week. Now. it'. s true that I can' t, obviox<br />gi-ve much other time for press conferences, but I do, Imn thie first<br />head of' government-in Australia to regularly have a pressa conference,<br />STONE: ' Well, just to sum it up at thst, particular issue.-Are you<br />happy to see some of your senior Ministers appear on television a~ ndthe<br />press as often as they do giving various opinions about what migl<br />or might not happen in the economy?<br />PRIME MINISTER: I want my colleagues to Ibe known to the pub I ic I. ha i<br />ture. I think sometimes they'll respond to requests for kerbside<br />opinions too readily and I als0 think that this is played up in ikea,<br />which obscures the public knowledge or understanidlng of how govcrnmer<br />must opera-te.<br />STONE: Can I bring up a persistent ruimour? I'm not trying to preteriathat<br />it's credible, hut it is a rumour that has exis~ e&amp;: that the<br />reason why Pr Cairns has emerged In such prominence is that you d6n' 1<br />r-eally care that much, or aren't really thay interested in economic<br />matters. PRIME MINISTER: I suppose I would have discussions on economic mattef<br />at least twice a week with academica or officia~ s or emoployee bodies<br />businessmen: at least vice a week. Many times it would be more ofitc--v<br />than that. I would be discussing economic matters more than kny O'tHIEV'<br />matters constantly.<br />STONE; This rumour, I might say has been used to explain away youir<br />number of overseas visits. It has been suggested that. you feel T'erscOstamore<br />cotnfortabl'e as a statesman dealing in Foreign AffairA than youeW0o<br />an a politician wrestling with domestic matters.<br />PHIMP, M'INISTIER. I have to make anybd aas IrmVa .-aste<br />trips overseas. Now th-ere again, can we lie precise about. the I<br />there have been four times when I have been away a fortnight onti I<br />haven't been away longer than a fortnighit and which of thos<br />I aakt do you think the Prime MiniAter shoult'ts have uildertak~ en?<br />Now, I know this is -said a very great deal, sct let me be, prE'cise.<br />The-. was las-t August meeting of the Commonwealth Heiids of GOovc-rnmc&amp; r-.#<br />in Ca~~ taa.

Then, in October, the-re vas<br />return visit, ., nly the second viait, of the Japanese/ Australlian<br />Ministerial Ieeting. Five Japanese Ministers came down to Australia<br />the end of ' 72.

Does anybody say that we shouldn't., am<br />Government, ha-ve shown our irit&amp; c. s' in maintaining close relatic-un<br />Japan?

Then a couple of weoeks ago I went to the United<br />Nations and I called on the new President and the re-elected Prime<br />Mfinister of' Canada.</p>

Whut do you think you accomplish on-theae trips? For<br />inst-ance, we heard that Dr ' Kissinger issid, perhaps to a member of tlie$<br />Australian party, that the only time he'd ever visit. Autralia ja if"<br />was on the way to somewhere and the only plaoc hie could think of vouiGlt<br />be the South Pole.

Could we 1talk now about the Labor Caucus? Are you proud of, lksperformance<br />of the Latbor Caucus in these troubled times? 7<br />TIRTME MINISTER: On balance, yes. Obviously they make mistakes I woulaL<br />hfive regarded from time to time, but let's be more precise there. You<br />tal-king In very generalised terms.<br />STONE: Well without coaching you, what I'd like you to do is in two o<br />thrte quick sentences I-ell the audience just -what benefit you see in<br />bai a Labor Cauculs that can overrule the decisions of the Prime Min,*'"<br />andQ net orbee they've been announced.<br />PRIME VINISTER: The Caucua comprises the Members of Parliament wbo've.,<br />becien e. % s Labor candidates, arid obviously we should get together'<br />&amp; owe do, once , week ometimes more often -to dccde how we'll % vol,<br />ins the two Houtheh of Parliament. Now, you isay the Caucus can overthrow,.<br />thte P-rimne Minister and Ca;. net.<br />STONE: Overrole their decisions...<br />PRIME MINISTER: Well, 0K. They've done it twice. Theuy dijid it. (, ncet<br />last yet.-r Rnd once thisi year, and thesfe have been in that time, at leaa('<br />two thousand deeisionn thiat the Cabinet has made. Now that's a~ pretty.<br />good record. They have reversed C( Lbinet decisions ob two ocuasiona our<br />of' over two thousand.<br />STONE: Yes, Now many times have the delayed decisions that You thOugi-Y<br />should be brought about right away, and they've-said no, hold on?<br />PRIME MINISTrER: I cen t. think of any. I can't thirik of bny case.<br />STONTE: Or modified decisions.</p>
<p>6-<br />RIME, MINISTER: I can't think.

I mectt<br />these are things that are always personalis~ ed. and dramritiiiedt but in fac-f..<br />the Cabinet is ela~ ted by the Caucus and the present -Cabinet. hs.. beeu. J<br />twice elected, by the Vanc ug without change. So you npedn't think I'm<br />particularly worried alt a record like that,<br />STONE: No. but, at the same time the record may not. reveal what ja<br />actually hatppening in...<br />PRIME MINIS'PER1 Tit preCiMO.<br />), RIM' MINISTER: L~ et's be precise.-<br />8TONE: Well, precioely, are there meaisures that you would have~ liked<br />I-ring to help the * economny, to help Axistralia, which you f'eel you) couldi<br />get through Caucuis and thiereforp, perhaps, revised them?<br />)'~ N~ MINISTFR: E'very decision that theG Cabinet -has made, and has got.<br />through, with two exceptions...<br />PRIME MINIST'ER: * Yea, but wait a minute, I'm a member of the Cabinet a<br />tik yCabinet decisions. I'm Dot going to reveal detailgsof Caietdiscussions.<br />You wouldn't expf-ot me to do that.<br />STONE: No, no, but I can...<br />P'RIME MINISTER; You know the argument always used to be, befoure we c. i if e<br />into of1' iev, t-hal. a Labor Government would be under direction fromi people<br />who weren't members of Parlium( ent. Now apparently,,-the obe~ tion<br />is that it's underAirevoion f'rom people who arc-members of' Parliament.<br />STONE: TeR, hut there, you know there's quite a fee~ lirg, I thinik, that<br />* peppiv wbo don't understand Caucus..,.<br />PRIM JK'STEIW.

Nobo~ y v~ e B~ ut. eve ryN4odye<br />who is a rnmher.<br />8 KE: Yea but Fian you say as Prime Minister that there is no stop you<br />would have taken without, the Caucus? I'll rephrase that again, because<br />I said it very~ badly. But .&gt; tI'm trying to sky is thait there are ; Stc r<br />you would have taken except for Catuctis not, approving.<br />PRIME 1INISTPRh There'a one instance thf~ t is known. beft're I comte 1~ cK.<br />let ine say that of' those two matters where the Cabinet devci. ioz-i 1weis<br />modified bt, Caucus, one was a year ago about taxation benefits for P C apt-C<br />in the gold-mining Industry and the other wfks concerning the higher<br />income tax on unearned income and that took place a r~ onth ago.
