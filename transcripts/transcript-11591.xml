    <content><![CDATA[<p>As Chairman of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) I can advise that the final report of the National Review of Pharmacy Regulation, chaired by Mr Warwick Wilkinson AM, has been forwarded to COAG.</p>
<p>The Reviewâ€™s main recommendations relate to:</p>
<ul><li>State and Territory legislation which restricts the ownership of pharmacies, and the practice of pharmacy, to registered pharmacists, and</li>
</ul><ul><li>Commonwealth restrictions on the location of pharmacies approved to dispense benefits under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</li>
</ul><p>A response to the Review will be released in due course.</p>
<p>The Review was established by the Commonwealth, States and Territories to meet their commitments under National Competition Policy. It commenced in June 1999 and a preliminary report was released on 24 November 1999.</p>
<p>Copies of the final report are available on the Internet at:<br /><a href="http://pandora.nla.gov.au/external.html?link=www.health.gov.au/haf/pharmrev/">http://www.health.gov.au/haf/pharmrev/</a></p>
