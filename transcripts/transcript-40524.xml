    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian and New South Wales governments have committed to a generational deal to deliver almost 100,000 jobs, more housing and better transport for outer Western Sydney in the first City Deal for New South Wales – the  nation’s largest ever planning and investment partnership.</p>
<p>Today, we entered into an agreement to deliver City Deals across New South Wales. The Memorandum of Understanding sets out how we will work together to make the State’s cities, metropolitan and regional, more liveable for the communities and businesses that they serve.</p>
<p>The Western Sydney City Deal provides a model for these future deals, and will drive a new economy in the emerging Western City that incorporates the areas immediately around the Western Sydney Airport, and the broader region.</p>
<p>An expected 9,000 jobs will be created by the Western Sydney Airport by the early 2030s and a further 60,000 jobs in the coming decades. Through joint Commonwealth, State and local government investment, tens of thousands of jobs will be established in the surrounding region.</p>
<p>These jobs will be in aviation related services, but also in sectors like security, education and training, catering, retail, warehousing, administration, communications and ICT.</p>
<p>Rapid growth in health, education, and in logistics and advanced manufacturing in outer Western Sydney and southwest Sydney, offers great potential for new job precincts.</p>
<p>Construction of the airport will generate $1.9 billion for the local economy, with a further $400 million across the rest of Sydney. </p>
<p>The Western Sydney City Deal pledges to;</p>
<ul><li>target additional infrastructure investment to increase public transport and reduce traffic congestion, so people can spend more time with their families</li>
<li>deliver more jobs closer to homes and services, with a focus on youth and indigenous training and skills development.</li>
<li>increase housing through better planning and density done well, and streamlining approvals across all three levels of government</li>
<li>support clean air, green spaces, vibrant arts and cultural initiatives.</li>
</ul><p>The population will reach 1.4 million people by 2036, so we will help build the additional 180,000 new homes and create the new jobs required to support this population growth. We will leverage our investments and use the strength of coordination across governments and the private sector to achieve these targets.</p>
<p>Western Sydney will be an exemplar 30-minute city – which means we have to attract the 30 per cent of workers who currently commute for work to jobs closer to home.</p>
<p>Strong collaboration across governments, local councils, the private sector and local communities is essential to the success of City Deals, with the selection of future deals to be undertaken through a competitive process.</p>
<p>A mayoral roundtable will be held on the Western Sydney City Deal in coming weeks, to include representatives from all local governments in the west and southwestern districts of Western Sydney.</p>
