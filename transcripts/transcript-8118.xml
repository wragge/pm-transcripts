FOR MEDIA 7 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
Prime Minister's Message for International Literacy Day,<br />
8 September 1990<br />
On the occasion of International Literacy Day in<br />
International Literacy Year I call on the nation to work<br />
together for literacy development. Our future depends on<br />
becoming a clever country. No educational skill is more<br />
fundamental than literacy. Literacy development needs to<br />
occur throughout a person's lifetime. We all have more<br />
complex reading and writing demands placed on us as society<br />
becomes more technologically advanced.<br />
The school system in Australia is one of the best in the<br />
world and we will continue to improve it. Most of us<br />
develop enough of a literacy base during childhood to learn<br />
the extra skills we need as adults. However, some of us<br />
experience difficulties during childhood and need to have<br />
another chance when we become independent adults. Some of<br />
us do not come from an English-speaking background and need<br />
to develop literacy skills in English.<br />
We all have a part to play in literacy development.<br />
Responsibility lies not only with the education sector but<br />
also with parents, community groups and industry. Australia<br />
will also play its part in assisting with literacy<br />
development in those regions of the world faced with greater<br />
difficulties than our own. </p>
