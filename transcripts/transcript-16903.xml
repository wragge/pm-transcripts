    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister today announced that the Gold Coast has received approval for 543 new homes worth $144 million under Stage Two of the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan Social Housing Initiative.</p>
<p>This brings the total number of new social housing dwellings on the Gold Coast to 571 homes, worth $152 million, following the announcement of Stage One projects earlier this year.</p>
<p>The 28 new homes under Stage One have started construction and are expected to be completed by the end of 2009.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made the announcement during his address to the Master Builders' Australia annual national conference at the Gold Coast.</p>
<p>Across the country, the Government estimates that the social housing component of the stimulus plan is supporting more than 15,000 jobs.</p>
<p>This new investment is one part of the Rudd Government's program to increase the stock of affordable homes in Australia by 80,000 by mid-2012.</p>
<p>For Queensland, the Social Housing Initiative involves 4,038 new properties at a cost of $1.085 billion.</p>
<p>The stimulus plan also includes a $5 million investment in maintenance and repair work for 1,217 homes on the Gold Coast. Renovation and repainting jobs increase the quality of the housing stock and lengthen its life.</p>
<p>Locations, numbers of dwellings and funding under the Social Housing Initiative are current and are subject to variations during the tender process.</p>
