<p>KBS:</p>
<p>First of all, I am sure Korean People consider it very significant and meaningful that the Korean War Memorial has been dedicated here in Canberra.</p>

<p>What is your feeling about that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it’s a very important and a very precious day, particularly for the 17 thousand Australians who served in Korea during the Korean War.  There were almost 340 of them killed in action.  Of course out of that war, there has emerged a very strong and modern nation, the Republic of Korea which is a good friend of Australia’s and I am looking forward very much to visiting Korea in a few weeks time and I will have an opportunity to convey to your President and your government the feeling about the relationship between our two countries.</p>
<p>KBS:</p>
<p>I understand that your Government has made efforts to reopen diplomatic relations with North Korea. I want to ask you what is current negotiation and when will it be concluded?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we support very strongly the moves that are being made by your President to open communication and dialogue with North Korea. As far as our own position is concerned, we are continuing to study developments very closely but we applaud everything that your Government has done.  We think it’s very forward looking and it’s very beneficial.</p>

<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I will be visiting South Korea.</p>
<p>KBS:</p>
<p>What is at the top of the agenda?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well the very close relationship between our two countries. The trade relations, the economic relations, the people to people links, all of those things are very important.</p>
<p>KBS</p>
<p>As you know we in Korea underwent an economic crisis for last two years. Now we are recovering very strongly. How do you thoughts on the Korean economy recovery and to promote a bilateral trade relationship?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We respect very much the recovery of the Korean economy.  We gave help to Korea when it needed help and we are very pleased to see Korea’s very rapid recovery and that is very good for Korea and it is also very good for Australia, because Korea is a very good customer of Australia and we want that to remain the case.</p>
