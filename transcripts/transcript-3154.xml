PRIME MINISTER<br />
VISIT TO SOUTH-EAST ASIA 14 February 1974<br />
" I have come to the end of a most important visit to<br />
six nations of South-East Asia Malaysia, Thailand, Laos, Burma,<br />
Singapore and the Philippines. My visit served two basic purposes.<br />
It enabled me to explain at first hand the aims and purposes of the<br />
Australian Government's foreign policy and to hear the views of our<br />
friends and neighbours on issues of common concern. It also enabled<br />
me to set in train official negotiations on a wide range of practical<br />
issues, especially in the area of trade.<br />
The results have given me unqualified satisfaction. There<br />
are no outstanding differences between Australia and her neighbours<br />
in the region. our foreign policies are fully understood and warmly<br />
approved. The Australian Government has established and our<br />
neighbours have recognised a genuine and continuing interest in<br />
South-East Asia. We are now seen as a steadfast and interested<br />
partner a true participant in the destiny of the region.<br />
There can be no turning back from this commitment.<br />
I was struck throughout my visit by the warmth and cordiality<br />
of the reception given to me and my officials in each of the countries<br />
we visited. I encountered a genuine affection for Australia and her<br />
people and a positive and heartening response to the changes and new<br />
directions in Australia's foreign policies.<br />
One result of my visit has been a series of decisions in<br />
favour of trade and cultural agreements between Australia and the<br />
countries of South-East Asia. We have agreed to update our trade<br />
agreements with Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines and to open<br />
negotiations for a trade agreement with Laos.<br />
I was able to explain the benefits of our new policies on<br />
Australian investment overseas and our plans for trade concessions<br />
for developing countries. These initiatives were warmly welcomed<br />
in all the countries I visited. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
In a number of countries I was asked whether Australia could<br />
supply, usually on a long term basis, commodities of basic importance<br />
to their economies. Favourable responses have already been given<br />
concerning sugar, wheat and rice to Malaysia, and coal to Burma.<br />
Contacts are continuing concerning the supply of steel, nitrogeneous<br />
fertilisers and liquid petroleum gas to Asian markets. I have made<br />
clear in each country I have visited that the increased flow of two-wa3<br />
trade is one of our prime objectives in our relations with South-East<br />
Asia. During my trip I took the opportunity to talk to students<br />
and their leaders and gained a valuable understanding of their<br />
concerns and aspirations.<br />
I assured the Governments of the region that while Australia<br />
still retained her natural interest in the defence and security of<br />
South-East Asia, we saw our future involvement in the region and<br />
indeed the best hope for the nations of the region itself in terms<br />
of growing co-operation and mutual assistance in the peaceful and<br />
productive areas of trade, economic assistance and social development<br />
based on the needs and wishes of the people.<br />
Most important of all, perhaps, in my talks with political<br />
leaders and in my public speeches, I was able to lay to rest any<br />
lingering suspicions of Australia as a racist country. I trust<br />
that Australia's old racist image has been buried forever.<br />
Australia is now closer in spirit and objectives to the<br />
nations of South-East Asia than ever before. On the basis of new<br />
and enriched understandings, and a common acceptance of the inevitability<br />
of change in the wake of cold war rivalries and out-dated<br />
ideological obsessions, our country will establish new and lasting<br />
friendships with our neighbours.<br />
