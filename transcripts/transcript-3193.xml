Press Statement No. 207<br />
21 March 1974<br />
AMENDMENT OF THE NORTH WEST CAPE AGREEMENT<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, as Acting Minister<br />
for Foreign Affairs, and the United States Ambassador,<br />
Mr. Marshall Green, today signed and exchanged Notes relating<br />
to amendments to the 1963 Agreement on the North West Cape<br />
Naval Communication Station. The exchange of Notes represents<br />
the first step by the Australian and United States Governments<br />
in giving effect to the arrangements reached as a result of the<br />
negotiations conducted by the Minister for Defence, Mr. Barnard,<br />
with the United States Government in Washington in January.<br />
Three amendments are contained in the Notes. The first<br />
provides for the Station to be operated as a joint facility by<br />
the armed forces of the two Governments. The second will have<br />
the effect of reducing exclusive land rights at North West Cape;<br />
the United States would retain exclusive rights to a communications<br />
building only. The third limits the Australian Government's<br />
financial responsibility for its participation in the joint facility.<br />
The Prime Minister said the Government proposed, following<br />
consideration by the Cabinet, to introduce the necessary amending<br />
legislation to the United States Naval Communications Station<br />
Agreement Act ( 1963). It was intended that this be done, if<br />
practicable, during the current sittings of the Parliament.<br />
The amended Agreement would come into force after legislation<br />
had been enacted and instruments notifying the approval of the<br />
two Governments exchanged.<br />
