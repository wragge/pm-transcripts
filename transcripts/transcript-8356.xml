SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ALP CENTENARY DINNER<br />
CANBERRA 25 NOVEMBER 1991<br />
In this remarkable year, there have been extraordinary<br />
developments, in the world and in Australia, which have<br />
given an added significance we might almost say, an<br />
historic symmetry to the fact that we celebrate the<br />
Centenary of our great Party in this year of 1991.<br />
To grasp the significance, we should recall the real meaning<br />
at the heart of the events we celebrate.<br />
Central to everything is the commitment made by the trade<br />
union movement one hundred years ago to advance its cause<br />
the betterment of the condition of the working men and women<br />
of Australia, their families and dependents through the<br />
parliamentary system, through parliamentary democracy,<br />
through the ballot box.<br />
And in this year, around the world, but most of all in the<br />
heartland of international communism itself, we have had an<br />
epic vindication of the course our forebears chose, the<br />
commitment they made, and which generations of Labor men anc<br />
women have kept.<br />
But at home, we are experiencing developments which<br />
constitute no less a striking vindication of our cause, and<br />
which underline the enduring relevance of our commitment, a!<br />
we enter our second century as a party, and prepare our<br />
nation f or the 21st century, as the Governent of Australia<br />
And there has been no time in my own experience when the<br />
fundamental values which we represent, and which we strive<br />
to build into the Australian society, have been offered a<br />
more complete or more direct challenge by our political<br />
opponents. This is not something that occurred just last Thursday.<br />
And nobody who has been listening, with even half an ear, t<br />
my warnings throughout the past 18 months, should have been<br />
remotely taken by surprise last Thursday either by the<br />
thrust of the Leader of the Opposition's Statement, or by<br />
its specifics.<br />
I spelt it all out at the Centenary Conference in Hobart<br />
last June.<br />
3236 </p>
<p>I said then that, beyond our tasks in government of<br />
maximising, for the people of Australia, the gains which<br />
will come with sustained low-inflation economic recovery,<br />
our task of continuing to build a more competitive<br />
Australia, we had, as a Party, another task.<br />
I said that that task was to ensure that the Australian<br />
people have no illusions or misunderstandings about the<br />
fundamental choice they will have to make in 1993.<br />
Because, I said,<br />
" This Liberal opposition is unlike any that has<br />
preceded it in the forty-odd years since the foundation<br />
of that Party. Collectively in its leadership, it<br />
represents the most ideological and the most divisive<br />
alternative presented to the Australian people in the<br />
post-War era. And in its program it is, more than any<br />
before it, obsessively determined to entrench privilege<br />
at the expense of fairness and compassion."<br />
And later in that speech I came to the specifics. I said:<br />
" Delegates, let me be quite blunt and to the point<br />
this Opposition is planning the most concerted attack<br />
in the history of this; nation on the living standards<br />
of the poor, the underprivileged, the aged and low-and<br />
middle-income families;. The centrepiece of this attack<br />
is to be their broad-based consumption tax, a fifteen<br />
per cent tax on all goods and services and it would<br />
do so in a profoundly regressive way."<br />
So there in June, I gave a perfectly accurate prediction of<br />
their proposals.<br />
This Opposition has embarked on an unprecedented onslaught<br />
on the unemployed, upon the aged, upon the invalid, upon<br />
Aboriginal Australians, upon the disadvantaged and upon<br />
families in need.<br />
This Opposition has committed itself to a new inflationary<br />
course, to re-fuelling infl. ationary expectations and to<br />
throwing away the historic gains against inflation, made<br />
with so much pain and difficulty.<br />
This Opposition has declared its determination to return to<br />
confrontation and entrench privilege.<br />
And this is what they call " fighting back'.<br />
If those words mean anything, they have put them in the<br />
wrong order.<br />
Because they mean back to fighting, back to divisiveness,<br />
back to polarisation of the community, back to industrial<br />
confrontation. 3237 </p>
<p>But certainly, friends, in the days and weeks and months to<br />
come, we in the Government, all of us in the Labor Party,<br />
will be working unrelentingly to expose this so-called<br />
package, not only for its appalling inequities and the<br />
dangers it poses for the Australian economy, but on the<br />
grounds of the ideology of deliberate community division<br />
which it embraces and promotes.<br />
In the task of exposure, we will focus on what are supposed<br />
to be its selling points the so-called compensation for<br />
the tax on everything you buy, and the so-called income tax<br />
cuts. I need hardly spell out that the whole question of<br />
compensation arises only because of the loss, the hardship,<br />
the sacrifice the community would be asked to bear, under<br />
this utterly unnecessary tax on necessities.<br />
When it is all stripped away, that is the bitter pill that<br />
the Opposition is asking Australians to swallow and the.<br />
so-called compensation is its coating.<br />
Then, we are told that the Leader of the Opposition has run<br />
us all through the computer, and come up with his model of<br />
Australia. And he has claimed that he has targetted the tax<br />
cuts to workers.<br />
Well, let's take a look at it.<br />
According to his own schedules, those earning up to S20,000<br />
would receive a gain in after tax income of For those<br />
on $ 30,000, or around average weekly earnings, the gain<br />
would be For those on $ 50,000, a gain of 12.4%.<br />
For those on S75,000, two and a half times average earnings,<br />
the gain would peak at a massive 14.7%<br />
In 1990-91, less than two per cent of Australians earned<br />
S75,000 or more.<br />
But, friends, how are these grossly inequitable tax cuts to<br />
be paid for?<br />
Not, it now appears, just from, or even mainly from the<br />
consumption tax, this tax on everything you buy.<br />
Delivery of the income tax cuts would depend upon<br />
billion in spending cuts.<br />
Now, the facts are that after nearly nine years of the most<br />
rigorous reviews of public sector spending, our Labor<br />
Government has made Australia one of the lowest taxing<br />
countries in the OECD. We now have one of the leanest and<br />
most efficient government sectors in the OECD.<br />
We know after nearly nine years of the most stringent<br />
reviews of government spending that there is no room for the<br />
sort of massive attack on government spending that Dr Hewson<br />
is now proposing, without seriously attacking people's<br />
living standards.<br />
3238 </p>
<p>4<br />
After nearly nine years of paring the public sector to the<br />
bone, we know that further substantial cuts would mean<br />
cutting into the bcne itself. And worst of all, it would<br />
mean devastating cuts in the most essential services, the<br />
area of greatest need, with the real burdens falling upon<br />
the most vulnerable groups in our community.<br />
Yet without this implausible S10 billion of further cuts,<br />
there is simply no way these much-vaunted tax cuts could<br />
ever be delivered.<br />
Friends, tonight is not the occasion to examine the<br />
Opposition's package in all its flawed detail.<br />
But, just to give you the flavour of what we have in store<br />
for them, and as an indication of how quickly gaping holes<br />
will appear, let me just take the case of petrol prices.<br />
There is a most serious flaw in Dr Hewson's figuring which<br />
could mean that Australian motorists would save not the S12<br />
per tankful he has dishonestly trumpeted to the electoratebut<br />
something less than $ 2.<br />
Motorists would see falls of no more than 2-3 cents a litre<br />
the sort of price cut you can get during the regular<br />
discounting wars.<br />
Dr Hewson has chosen not to factor into his package the<br />
effect on fuel prices of new road-user charges for road<br />
funding. Yet he clearly commits himself to these new road<br />
funding arrangements, and indeed is quite lyrical in the<br />
package about the importance to Australia of an efficient<br />
transport system.<br />
Dr Hewson's failure to riake any such allowance for road-user<br />
charges in his calculati. ons and in his policy design must<br />
mean he cannot deliver on his promised petrol price cuts.<br />
Nor can he, in this respect, deliver on significantly<br />
reduced business costs in this area, which he made so<br />
critically important in his presentation.<br />
But even more serious are the ramifications of his flaw on<br />
his CPI calculations and, indeed, on the fundamental<br />
credibility of the whole package. Dr Hewson has a number of<br />
choices if he wants to clear up this dilemma.<br />
He can ditch the road-user charging concept and thus<br />
abandon his professed commitment to micro-economic reform.<br />
Or he can admit his error and thus admit that he can't<br />
deliver o n big petrol price cuts, and that his CPI figure,<br />
underpinning so much in his package, is plain wrong, which<br />
in turn throws out all his calculations to compensate people<br />
for the effects of his consumption tax.<br />
We wait with interest.<br />
But, friends, we will not be merely exposing the flaws,<br />
inequities, contradiction and loopholes, in these proposals. 323 " 1 </p>
<p>We will be opposing the whole concept of a new tax in terms<br />
of the great priorities now on this nation's agenda the<br />
priorities that we, the Labor Government, have set as our<br />
agenda. And we will show how disastrously wrong the Opposition have<br />
got their priorities.<br />
A consumption tax would not help sustainable economic<br />
growth; it would refuel inflation, and would<br />
necessitate much tighter monetary policy and higher<br />
interest rates<br />
A consumption tax would not create jobs; it would cost<br />
jobs A consumption tax would not help the elderly; it would<br />
disadvantage them among the worst of any section of the<br />
community A consumption tax would exacerbate the problems already<br />
facing rural Australia<br />
A consumption tax would be a massive disadvantage for<br />
our fastest growing industry, the tourist industry,<br />
with all its potential for job growth<br />
A consumption tax would not protect Australian<br />
families; its main burden would fall on the families of<br />
Australia.<br />
But, my friends, let me make this clear.<br />
The task of demolition, necessary as it is, comprehensive as<br />
it must be, will not be the single thrust of our response in<br />
the weeks and months to come.<br />
Our attack will be in the context of our forward program,<br />
the unfinished business we have undertaken on behalf of the<br />
people of Australia. It will be placed in the context of<br />
the working through of the fundamental reforms initiated,<br />
this year, by the March Statement, the Special Premiers<br />
Conference, the Budget, and the November Statement.<br />
And this is what Australians can look forward to from the<br />
Government in the months ahead:<br />
the implementation of recently announced decisions<br />
which will generate sustainable jobs, in major resource<br />
and manufacturing projects;<br />
the announcement, and implementation, of details of<br />
projects to improve Australian cities;<br />
details of legislation to improve superannuation<br />
coverage for all Australians;<br />
3240 </p>
<p>next year, the finalisation of the ecologically<br />
sustainable development process, which will ensure that<br />
soundly based environmental considerations become a<br />
normal part of all government and private sector<br />
decision-making;<br />
the finalisation of the Government's industrial<br />
relations reforms, to see Australia's industrial<br />
culture re-oriented to increased productivity and<br />
therefore prosperity as well as to underwrite our<br />
long-established concern for equity in the wages<br />
system; further developments in microeconomic reform, including<br />
major initiatives in communications;<br />
our commitment to move towards removing pensioners from<br />
the personal income tax system;<br />
finalising agreement with the States and Territories on<br />
a major injection of funds into the TAFE system;<br />
the $ 1 billion savings to business from taxation<br />
measures announced earlier this month;<br />
the continuing reforms in transport, especially on the<br />
waterfront; the continuing pressure we are exerting internationally<br />
to have other trading nations liberalise their trading<br />
arrangements, to provide expanded markets for Australia<br />
exports of goods and services.<br />
Meanwhile, we will produce a detailed analysis of every<br />
facet of the Opposition package.<br />
And, above all, friends, above all for this Labor<br />
Government, our response will be placed squarely in the<br />
context of our continuing commitment to achieve sustained<br />
growth with low inflation, and the restoration of job<br />
growth. That will be our real reply to this meretricious public<br />
relations exercise our opponents have launched. And that<br />
will be our real message to the people of Australia, in the<br />
first and second years of the second century of the great<br />
Australian Labor Party, as we head towards the fifth term of<br />
this great Labor Gover: nment. </p>
