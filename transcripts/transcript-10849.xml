    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce the creation of an End of War List for the</p>
<p> Vietnam War which will see 78 members and former members of the Australian</p>
<p> Defence Force receive Australian gallantry and distinguished awards</p>
<p> denied to them at the conclusion of hostilities.</p>
<p>This is an issue which governments have avoided for a quarter of a</p>
<p> century. The coalition made a commitment at the last Federal election</p>
<p> to establish an End of War List for the Vietnam War and today my government</p>
<p> is honouring that promise.</p>
<p>I should like to take the opportunity to express my thanks to the</p>
<p> Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, Bronwyn Bishop</p>
<p> and to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Bruce Scott who have</p>
<p> worked tirelessly to resolve this long-standing issue.</p>
<p>A review by the Department of Defence has identified 78 persons who</p>
<p> were recommended for awards at the highest level in Vietnam. In 50</p>
<p> cases the nominations were rejected and in 28 cases, lower level awards</p>
<p> were substituted.</p>
<p>It is no longer feasible to award the British honours originally recommended.</p>
<p> The persons concerned will be offered the most appropriate Australian</p>
<p> award including the Distinguished Service Medal, the Medal for Gallantry,</p>
<p> the Commendation for Gallantry and the Commendation for Distinguished</p>
<p> Service.</p>
<p>The next step is for the individuals to be contacted. This process</p>
<p> is underway.</p>
