EMBARGOED UN4TIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
RECEPTION rOR CAPTAINS or TALL SHIPS<br />
SYDNEY -21 JANuARY 1988<br />
I am delighted to meet the Captains and crew of the Tall<br />
Ships representing foreign governments, and the Ambassadors<br />
and High Commissioners to Australia of those governments,<br />
and to have this opportunity of expressing my appreciation<br />
and that of the Australian government and people for your<br />
participation in our Bicentennial celebrations.<br />
When the Bicentennial Authority proposed to the Govern ment<br />
the idea of a Tall Ships event to commemorate and honouxr<br />
Australia's maritime heritage'and our continuing dependence<br />
on the sea, we knew that the success of the event would<br />
depend ultimately upon the-willingness of other governments<br />
to send their sal 1-training vessel1s to join in our<br />
celebrations, to give the event international standing, and<br />
to add those elements of drama and spectacle which only the<br />
large sailing ships can bring.<br />
But the event Tall Ships Australia 1988 brilliant<br />
spectacle though it is has a deeper significance related<br />
to Australia's identity as a modern nation, its place in the<br />
contemporary world and its hopes for the future.<br />
First, the event symbolizes Australia's diversity as a<br />
nation built on migration. We celebrate that diversity.<br />
Since the early 19th century Australia has attracted people<br />
from other lands in search of a new way of life, new freedom<br />
and new opportunities.<br />
And for most of the first century, they all came by sail.<br />
Secondly, the event symbolises Australia's wish to reach out<br />
in friendship to all nations.<br />
The readiness of your governments to send you on a long and<br />
hazardous journey around the world to reach us is testimony<br />
to the international friendships we prize-so highly. 004009 </p>
<p>It is quite remarkable to reflect that Tall Ships Australia<br />
1988 has a greater number of international participants than<br />
Op sail ' 76 orl&amp; nised as part of the Bicentennial<br />
celebrations of the United States of America.<br />
But, perhaps most important of all, is the fact that the<br />
Tall Ships event brings together the young people of so many<br />
nations in a spirit of goodwill, friendship, co-operation<br />
and adventure.<br />
These are qualities we Australians value.<br />
They give us hope for a brighter future for the youth of the<br />
vo d.<br />
So I am especially pleased to welcome the 17 represeptatives<br />
of the trainee crews here today.<br />
You and the hundreds of other young seafarers have now faced<br />
the age old challenge of the sea which demands<br />
self-discipline, team work, self-reliance and endurance.<br />
Your voyage to Australia has been a tough test. You have<br />
responded to the challenge in a way which does credit to you<br />
and your generation.<br />
We salute you as Ambassadors of goodwill.<br />
Tall Ships Australia ' 88 has also provided us with a<br />
reminder of the perils faced by those who go down to the sea<br />
in ships.<br />
India's ship Varuna was, as you know, damaged in the G~ reat<br />
Australian bijE7<br />
While we lament her misfortune, we salute the courage and<br />
tenacity which has brought her to Sydney to take pTart in the<br />
Srand finale of the Event, the Grand Parade of Sail on<br />
I am personally delighted that Varuna will be flying Indiarg<br />
flag on that day which is the niE-t-1onl day for two nations.-<br />
india and Australia.<br />
I wish you all a safe passage home and hope that the memory<br />
of the event will live in your hearts as it assuredly will<br />
in ours.<br />
In this spirit we salute you and I ask you to convoy our<br />
thanks to your Governments, and to your ships' companies.<br />
Yours is a magnificent contribution to our Bicentenary, one<br />
that people of Australia will long remem~ ber. 004010 </p>
<p>it gives me much pleasure now to present to the Captain of<br />
each of the seventeen ships a memento of yorprf ia o<br />
in Tall ships Australia ' 88 and with it te thanks of the<br />
Australian people. 004011 </p>
