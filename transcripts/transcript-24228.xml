    <content><![CDATA[<p>This week I go to New Zealand for the annual Australia-New Zealand leadersâ€™ meeting. Australia and New Zealand are family thanks to shared history, deep integration and the ability to work seamlessly together.</p>
<p>On 27-28 February, Prime Minister John Key and I will discuss a range of bilateral and international issues, including combating terrorism, foreign fighters and the situation in Iraq.</p>
<p>At the Auckland War Memorial Museum, I will lay a wreath to mark the 100th anniversary of WWI before attending the 10th Australia-New Zealand Leadership Forum, which brings together business, government and community leaders to discuss how to develop our bilateral partnership.</p>
<p>To celebrate our co-hosting of the Cricket World Cup, I will attend the Cricket World Cup Australia-New Zealand match. I look forward to meeting New Zealand firefighters who have battled bushfires alongside their Australian counterparts in our times of need.</p>
