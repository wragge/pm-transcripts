    <content><![CDATA[<p>  I am pleased to announce increased Australian funding in support of the<br />
   Commonwealth's developing country members.</p>
<p>  First, Australia will increase its contribution to the Commonwealth Fund<br />
   for Technical Cooperation (CFTC) by 10 per cent each year for the next three<br />
   years. This will take Australia's contribution from $7.2 million in 1999-2000<br />
   to $9.5 million by 2002-03.</p>
<p>  Australia supports the CFTC as the Commonwealth's main vehicle for strengthening<br />
   good governance in Commonwealth member countries. In particular, we value<br />
   its work in supporting democratic and legal institutions. The Fund is the<br />
   Commonwealth's main development programme and also covers fields such as<br />
   economic and debt management, trade and investment, human resource development<br />
   and public sector reform.</p>
<p>  Second, at Edinburgh in 1997, the Commonwealth's Trade and Investment Access<br />
   Facility (TIAF) was established at my initiative with an Australian grant<br />
   of $1.5 million over three years. Britain, Canada and New Zealand also gave<br />
   the initiative strong support. It has been successful and Australia will<br />
   continue its support with an annual grant of $500,000 a year for the next<br />
   three years. TIAF helps Commonwealth developing countries manage the impact<br />
   of globalisation and make better use of the WTO to pursue trade and investment<br />
   opportunities.</p>
<p>  Third, Australia will fund a special training programme for trade negotiators<br />
   from Africa. The programme will help African countries, including non-Commonwealth<br />
   members, maximise their benefits from the new WTO trade round. The programme<br />
   will cost $300,000.</p>
<p>  Fourth, Australia will provide $3 million over six years in order to extend<br />
   to 2006 the Australia-South Pacific 2000 Sports Programme. The programme<br />
   was due to end in 2000, but has been extremely successful in encouraging<br />
   sports development in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>  Lastly, in the IMF/World Bank context Australia announced in September an<br />
   additional $35 million for the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries<br />
   Initiative (HIPC). A number of the countries involved are Commonwealth members.<br />
   The HIPC initiative will help provide relief from indebtedness which, matched<br />
   with essential policy reforms, can give developing countries a chance to<br />
   achieve sustainable growth.</p>
<p>  These initiatives reflect the government's strong support for the Commonwealth<br />
   as an institution which can make a unique contribution to strengthening<br />
   good governance and supporting sustainable development.</p>
