KU-RING-CAT MUNICIPAL COUNCIL LUNCHEON<br />
It is a pleasure for me to be here in Ku-ring-gai today and<br />
an honour for me to be present at this luncheon. Ku-ring-gai,<br />
of course, contains some of the most beautiful areas on the<br />
North Shore. And one of the finest and most popular national<br />
parks in the State, and I've no doubt that the Ku-ring-gai<br />
Council is also one of the finest and most popular councils<br />
in the State.<br />
As you are no doubt aware, His Royal Highness Prince Charles<br />
is presently visiting Australia. His father, Prince Philip,<br />
recently recounted a story about local government which, being<br />
a farmer, I can't resist repeating. Prince Philip speaking<br />
of his visit to New Zealand with Queen Elizabeth 25 years<br />
ago said: " It was in the days before the widespread use of<br />
milking machines. By the end of that visit I reckon<br />
we had shaken hands with every local government<br />
councillor in New Zealand.<br />
As most of them appeared to be dairy farmers I can<br />
only say I came away with a profound sympathy for<br />
New Zeal-and cows."<br />
But whatever the occupation of councillors, they always give<br />
willingly of their time to their council duties. And they<br />
certainly get plenty of recognition from their constituents<br />
whenever a flat development, or a road widening proposal is<br />
mooted. I have always admired the unstinting work performed by<br />
councillors and I would like to speak briefly today about<br />
my Government's Federalism policy, particularly as it relates<br />
to local government and the Ku-ring-gai area. Our Federalism<br />
policy aims for co-operation between governments rather than<br />
conflict, for partnership, not domination. In recent years,<br />
there has been a dramatic change in the relationship between<br />
the Commonwealth, State and local government. The introduction<br />
by my Government of the new tax sharing arrangements in 1976 has<br />
given local government a greater degree of financial security<br />
than it ever had previously. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
The Whitlam Government had moved towards a limited funding<br />
arrangement for local government. But this was based on a<br />
compulsory grouping of councils into artificially created<br />
regions as decreed by Canberra, and a distribution of funds<br />
to them on an ad hoc basis each year.<br />
The Liberal Party could not agree to that. Under this<br />
Government the distribution of general revenue assistance to<br />
individual councils is no longer determined in Canberra, but<br />
by State Grants Commissions.<br />
This year, the New South * Wales Grants Commission recommended<br />
the distribution of over $ 65 million in tax sharing grants<br />
to local authorities in the State. As you know, the special<br />
virtue of these grants is that being untied, the purpose to<br />
which they are applied is left to each council to decide.<br />
This year the Ku-ring-gai Municipality received $ 454.000, so<br />
that over the last three years the Ku-ring-gai Municipal<br />
Council has received almost $ 1.3 million in untied Commonwealth<br />
funds. Overall, assuming there is no reduction this year in the level<br />
of road grants passed on to councils by the States, and that<br />
seems a reasonable assumption, the total level of Commonwealth<br />
assistance to local government provided in the three Budgets<br />
since my Government took office is likely to be of the order<br />
of $ 920 million. Of this considerable amount, the untied<br />
tax sharing grants represent nearly $ 485 million. This record<br />
is one of which I and-my Government are justifiably proud,<br />
and I'm sure you prefer to have the right to decide how it<br />
should be spent, rather than have the Commonwealth directing<br />
you. At the moment, local government receives a 1.52%~ share of the<br />
Commonwealth's net personal income tax receipts, and it is<br />
part of our platform that we will increase the share to<br />
two percent by 1980-81.<br />
Speaking of platforms, you may be interested to know how it is<br />
thought that te-rm came into political use. I'm told that in<br />
one part of Ancient Greece it long was the custom that when<br />
a man proposed a law in the popular assembly he did so. on~ oa<br />
platform with a rope around his neck. If the law was passed,<br />
they removed the rope; if it failed, they removed the platform.<br />
I commend this idea to any council that wishes to limit the<br />
number of speakers in a debate.<br />
Mr Mayor, having said that, I think I should make this speech<br />
a brief on. Thankyou once again for your warm welcome.<br />
